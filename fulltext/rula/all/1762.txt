FATIGUE DAMAGE CHARACTERIZATION OF BRAIDED AND WOVEN FIBER REINFORCED POLYMER MATRIX COMPOSITES AT ROOM AND ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

John Montesano Doctor of Philosophy, Aerospace Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto (2012)

ABSTRACT
The use of polymer matrix composites (PMC) for manufacturing primary loadbearing structural components has significantly increased in many industrial applications. Specifically in the aerospace industry, PMCs are also being considered for elevated temperature applications. Current aerospacegrade composite components subjected to fatigue loading are over designed due to insufficient understanding of the material failure processes, and due to the lack of available generic fatigue prediction models. A comprehensive literature survey reveals that there are few fatigue studies conducted on woven and braided fabric reinforced PMC materials, and even fewer at elevated temperatures. It is therefore the objective of this study to characterize and subsequently model the elevated temperature fatigue behaviour of a triaxial braided PMC, and to investigate the elevated temperature fatigue properties of two additional woven PMCs. An extensive experimental program is conducted using a unique test protocol on the braided and woven composites, which consists of static and fatigue testing at various test temperatures. The development of mechanicallyinduced damage is monitored using a combination of nondestructive techniques which included infrared thermography, fiber optic sensors and edge replication. The observed microscopic damage development is quantified and correlated to the exhibited macroscopic material behaviour at all test temperatures. The fiber dominated PMC materials considered in this study did not exhibit notable time or temperaturedependent static properties. However, fatigue tests reveal that the local damage

iii

development is in fact notably influenced by temperature. The elevated temperature environment increases the toughness of the thermosetting polymers, which results in consistently slower fatigue crack propagation rates for the respective composite materials. This has a direct impact on the stiffness degradation rate and the fatigue lives for the braided and woven composites under investigation. The developed analytical fatigue damage prediction model, which is based on actual observed damage mechanisms, accurately predicted the development of damage and the corresponding stiffness degradation for the braided PMC, for all test temperatures. An excellent correlation was found between the experimental and the predicted results to within a 2% accuracy. The prediction model adequately captured the local temperatureinduced phenomenon exhibited by the braided PMC material. The results presented in this study are novel for a braided composite material subjected to elevated temperature fatigue.

1 Introduction

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Motivation
In recent years, the application of advanced polymer matrix composites (PMC) has notably increased in many industries due to their superior strengthtoweight and stiffnessto weight ratios compared to traditional monolithic metallic alloys. The significant advancement in PMC technology has led to practical applications in aerospace, automotive, marine and civil structures. Particularly in the aerospace industry, PMC materials have become the material of choice for primary load bearing components, which is exemplified by considering modern commercial transport aircraft such as the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787. An overview of the usage of composite materials in the Boeing 787 commercial aircraft is shown in Figure 1, which consists of an airframe structure that is comprised of 50% composite materials by weight and 80% composite by volume [1]. The obvious benefit in using composite materials for aircraft structures is the significant reduction in fuel consumption due to the decrease in aircraft structural weight. The established acceptance of these materials in the aerospace industry and their importance for future development of more efficient aircraft is apparent. Currently, fiber reinforced polymeric composite components are overdesigned due to the many uncertainties associated with these advanced materials and due to their complex microscopic behaviour. A better understanding of composite material mechanical behaviour is consequently necessary to optimize the material in order to ensure sustained widespread usage.

Polymeric composites are typically comprised of a reinforcing constituent material embedded in a polymer matrix constituent material, which combine to form a heterogeneous and anisotropic material. The polymer matrix can be either thermosetting or a thermoplastic, which influences not only the mechanical properties but also the material manufacturing process. The reinforcing material can be in the form of particles, short fibers or continuous fibers. Some types of commonly used continuous fibers include carbon, glass, Kevlar and boron. Composites consisting of layered unidirectional continuous carbon fiber reinforced polymer plies have been largely employed for primary load bearing applications in the aerospace industry. Despite their substantial use, a number of manufacturing and performance disadvantages have been identified with unidirectionalply PMC laminates. This has consequently prompted the recent development of textile PMC materials, including woven, stitched, knitted and braided fabric reinforcements. Compared to conventional laminates, fabric reinforced PMC materials present a number of clear advantages [2, 3]. Some of these advantages include having better overall throughthethickness strength properties including superior impact damage resistance and delamination resistance, balanced inplane performance, improved fatigue performance and lower notch sensitivity. In addition, producing complex shaped parts can be easier to manufacture and generally have a much lower

1 Introduction manufacturing cost due to the conformability of textile fabrics coupled with the use of an out ofautoclave manufacturing technique such as resin transfer moulding (RTM). The automation of the textile fabrics may further reduce manufacturing costs, eliminating tedious manual lay up which renders textile composites as costcompetitive alternatives for component manufacturing. In spite of the indicated advantages, the use of some textile composites such as braided PMC materials is only limited to a few applications in the aerospace industry to date. One of the issues restricting their wider use is that there have been few studies conducted which characterize the material behaviour, thus limiting the available mechanical performance data of braided PMC materials. It is therefore imperative to better understand the mechanical behaviour of braided composite materials that results from their complex microstructure. Furthermore, continuous carbon fiber reinforced polymeric composite materials are gaining substantial consideration in the aerospace industry for elevated temperature applications such as supersonic vehicle airframe and propulsion system components. A schematic of the components of a turbofan jet engine is shown in Figure 2, with the indicated zones for potential application of composite material components. This class of materials may be adequate replacements for their metallic counterparts for manufacturing aircraft components exposed to longterm temperatures in the 150  350°C range. A new generation of high glasstransition temperature (Tg) polymers has enabled this early stage development. Commercially available polymers such as PMR15 [4], bismaleimide (BMI) [5] and a number of additional high temperature polyimide resins have been used or are being considered for fiber reinforced composite materials to manufacture jet engine components or supersonic vehicle airframe components. The integration of composite materials into the propulsion systems of modern commercial and military aircraft has not experienced a great deal of advancement. This is mainly due to the demanding temperature regime that engine components must withstand during standard operation. Clearly, there is a requirement to better understand the mechanical behaviour of this class of PMC material at elevated temperatures.

In addition, the concept of a structural material failing in service when subjected to a repeating or cyclic stress with a magnitude much lower than its fracture stress is a phenomenon that has been on the agendas of many researchers for well over 100 years. Failure in materials such as metals or composites that occurs under dynamic loading conditions over a substantial period of time is called a fatigue failure. In the aerospace industry, there are many examples of structures subjected to cyclic loads such as the repeated pressurization and depressurization loading on the skin of an aircraft fuselage, the vibration of an aircraft component due to dynamic flight loading, the rotation of engine turbine blades and the rotation of compressor components. In fact, fatigue loading accounts for a large percentage of service failures due to mechanical causes. With respect to polymeric composite materials, understanding the microscopic damage development caused by cyclic loading is of paramount importance for developing damage tolerant materials, or for predicting the fatigue life of a structural component. For braided PMC materials, there is a requirement to better understand the influence of fatigue loading, the effects of elevated temperatures, and the influence of the associated damage development on the exhibited material behaviour. Currently, clear design criteria similar to those that are employed for fatigue of metallic alloys have not been well established for composites in general.

1 Introduction

1.2 Objectives
The main objective of the study is to investigate the fatigue behaviour of a braided carbon fiber reinforced resin at elevated temperatures, and to provide a better understanding of the effects of both temperature and cyclic loading on the material behaviour. The characterization of damage development and the corresponding material behaviour during both static and fatigue loading, at both room temperature and elevated temperatures, is considered in detail. The critical microscopic damage modes and the development of damage are considered and correlated to the exhibited material behaviour. A corresponding fatigue damage model is also developed for the braided material, and used to predict the degradation of the material properties during cyclic loading. The predicted results of the fatigue damage model are then compared to the observed experimental damage development. The analytical damage model is based in part on the obtained quantitative damage observations, and thus developed accordingly. In addition, consideration for the effects of cyclic loading of other woven composites at elevated temperatures is investigated to provide a basis for discussion and comparison to the aforementioned braided composite material.

1.3 Scope
Polymeric composite material behaviour is a function of not only the type and size of the reinforcing fibers, but also their geometry. As a result, material properties of unidirectionalply, wovenply and braided composites will significantly differ. Consequently, various techniques are required to analytically determine the material properties of the different types of fiber reinforced composites. The direction of loading relative to the local material coordinates will also greatly influence the material behaviour. Chapter 2 contains an overview of the typical conventions associated with the various types of fiber reinforced composites, as well as a review of equations necessary to predict the material properties. Although a number of fatigue studies have been conducted on PMC materials, few studies have been conducted on braided composites, and fewer studies have been conducted at elevated temperatures. Braided composite materials exhibit complex microscopic deformation and damage development due to cyclic loading. An elevated temperature

5

1 Introduction environment will undoubtedly influence the development of microscopic damage development. Also, damage development in braided and woven composites are distinct from that observed in conventional unidirectional laminates, which requires new fatigue damage models to be developed. A comprehensive literature survey of existing PMC material fatigue studies, elevated temperature studies, damage characterization studies, and developed fatigue damage models is presented in Chapter 3. Fatigue testing that includes damage characterization generally requires a highly accurate and calibrated experimental setup, and a well planned test procedure. Nondestructive techniques are typically employed to monitor damage development throughout testing. In addition, testing at elevated temperatures introduces difficulties which often requires a slightly modified test protocol. The experimental testing details for the static and fatigue tests conducted on the braided PMC material will be discussed in Chapter 4, while the detailed test results will be presented in Chapter 5 for both room temperature and elevated temperature. Development of the fatigue damage model, as pertaining to the braided composite material, will be presented and compared to the experimental data in Chapter 6. Additional results for other woven laminates will also be discussed in Chapter 6. An overall discussion of the experimental characterization and damage modeling results will be presented in Chapter 7. Finally, concluding remarks and a list of the contributions of this study will be presented in Chapter 8, which will also outline areas for future work.

2 COMPOSITE MATERIALS
Continuous fiber reinforced polymeric composite materials may consist of various forms of fiber geometries which influence both the microscopic and macroscopic behaviour of the material. The following sections present the conventions used for various types of continuous fiber reinforcements, the relevant methods required to determine the respective material properties, and a considerations for fiberdominated and matrixdominated material behaviour of continuous fiber reinforced PMC materials.

2.1 Fiber Geometric Conventions
Polymeric composite materials reinforced with continuous fibers can be classified either as laminates consisting of individual twodimensional layers of fibers (or fabrics), or as three dimensional composites consisting of a single reinforcing fabric layer with fibers in the through thickness direction. Common examples of polymeric laminate twodimensional fiber arrangements and polymeric composite threedimensional fabrics are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. The corresponding warp direction is indicated in all figures, as well as the material coordinates in the longitudinal, transverse and throughthickness directions labelled 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Note that the yarns labelled in many of the images in the figures consist of a bundle of many fibers.

Conventional laminates employed in aerospace applications typically consist of stacking unidirectional plies, such as that shown in Figure 3 (d), with each ply oriented at a particular angle, , with respect to the xdirection of the laminate. Figure 5 shows a schematic of a four

2 Composite Materials ply unidirectional laminate with the inply angles indicated (i.e., the angle between longitudinal material direction, 1, and the laminate xdirection). Unidirectionalply laminates are typically manufactured from unidirectional layers that are preimpregnated with the polymer matrix in an autoclave or by compression moulding. More recently, twodimensional fabric layers such as those shown in Figure 3 (a)(c) have also been utilized to manufacture multiply laminates. The fabric layers are typically all oriented in the same orientation with the material longitudinal direction, 1, parallel to the laminate xdirection, although the plies may be oriented with an angle  relative to the laminate xdirection. These fabricply laminates are often manufactured by placing the dry fabric layers into a mould and using a RTM technique. They can also be manufactured from preimpregnated layers in an autoclave. Finally, threedimensional fabric composites such as those shown in Figure 4 (a) and (b) have also been utilized for some applications. These dry fabrics are typically placed in a mould and a RTM technique is used for manufacturing the components. These types of composites are typically employed in applications requiring very high outofplane strength, such as components subjected to impact loading.

The fabric shown in Figure 3 (a) is a woven fabric with a plain weave, while the fabric shown in Figure 3 (b) is a triaxial braided fabric with a 2x2 braid pattern. The triaxial braided composite fiber geometry consists of fiber yarns oriented along the warp directions which are ideally straight, and braider yarns oriented in the ± directions which are

2.2 Material Properties
In order to determine material properties for fiber reinforced PMC materials, the material properties of the constituents, fiber geometry, fiber (or ply) orientation, and fiber volume fraction of the composite must be known and considered. This requires a study of the constituent materials and their geometric arrangement, which is known as micromechanics. Mechanical tensile properties of some common reinforcing fibers and some conventional metallic alloys are listed in Table 1, while typical tensile properties of polymers are listed in Table 2 as reference.

For unidirectionalply laminates, the properties of the individual plies or lamina are first considered. The laminae are typically assumed to be orthotropic due to the unidirectional orientation of the fibers. Mechanical properties such as the longitudinal modulus, transverse modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio can be found using a well established homogenization technique such as the rule of mixtures or the HalpinTsai equations. For the approximation of the lamina longitudinal modulus (E11o), it is assumed that the fibers and matrix undergo the same strain magnitude during loading [6]. For a fiber volume fraction denoted as Vf, the modulus is defined as:

E11o = E11f Vf + Em 1  Vf 

(1)

The fiber axial tensile modulus is defined as E11f, while the matrix modulus is defined as Em. The lamina transverse modulus (E22o) can be found using the HalpinTsai equations.

2 Composite Materials Once all the lamina properties are known, the equivalent laminate properties can then be determined based on the orientation and stacking sequence of the individual plies. The individual orthotropic plies are typically assumed to be in a state of plane stress. If the plies deform in a linearly elastic manner, the relevant stressstrain relations are given as [6]:
 1 ½ ªQ11 Q12 0 º  1 ½ ° ° « »° ° ®  2 ¾ = «Q12 Q22 0 » ® 2 ¾ ° ° « 0 ° ° 0 Q66 » ¯ 12 ¿ ¬ ¼ ¯12 ¿

(4)

The stress and strain terms in Equation (4) are written in terms of the material coordinate system shown in Figure 3 (d). The stiffness matrix terms Qij are functions of the engineering constants for the lamina. Equation (4) can be transformed to account for the orientation of the individual plies with respect to the laminate warp direction using the orientation angle . Equation (4) can then be written in terms of the laminate (or global) coordinate system (see Figure 5), as is defined by Equation (5). The transformed stiffness matrix terms Qij are functions of Qij [6].

(5)

Classical laminate theory (CLT) can then be employed to define the stressstrain relations for a general laminate using the transformed stiffness matrices, ª ¬Q º ¼ , of the kth plies. The laminate stressstrain relation in vector and matrix notation is defined by:

(7)

For twodimensional fabric laminates, the equivalent lamina properties are often difficult to determine using a simple homogenization technique, such as the rule of mixtures, due to the complex geometry of the reinforcing fabric. As a result, more advanced analytical techniques are often employed to determine the equivalent lamina and laminate properties. If the fabric layers do not all have the same orientation, the homogenization technique can then be combined with CLT to determine the equivalent laminate engineering constants. Similar homogenization techniques are typically adopted for approximating the mechanical properties of threedimensional fabric reinforced composites. These techniques are based on a continuum approach and they assume that the material exhibits statistical homogeneity at the macroscopic scale. A representative volume element (RVE) of the composite microstructure is typically defined in order to perform the homogenization. The review of continuum homogenization approaches conducted by Herakovich [7] discusses many commonly employed homogenization techniques such as Voigt approximation, Reuss approximation, the method of cells, the selfconsistent method, the MoriTanaka method and the micromechanical approach using finite element analysis. One commonly employed analytical homogenization technique is the method originally developed by MoriTanaka [8], which was subsequently adapted for application to composite materials [9, 10]. More recently, this technique was applied to textile composites [11]. The fiber yarns in textile composites are effectively represented by a series of inclusions within the matrix. The geometry and size of the fictitious inclusions are defined based on the actual textile fabric geometry, and a series of geometrical tensors are defined. These tensors are used along with the fiber and matrix material properties to define the composite mechanical properties, such as the tensile modulus. Full details of the technique as applicable to textile composite

13

2 Composite Materials materials can be found in [12]. It is also common to employ numerical homogenization techniques which are based on the finite element method (FEM). These techniques explicitly model the micromechanical RVE and use the constituent material properties with appropriate boundary conditions to approximate the composite mechanical properties [7, 12].

2.3 Fiber and MatrixDominated Behaviour
The mechanical behaviour of composite materials is not only a function of the constituents and their arrangements, but also of the type and direction of loading. In this study, the type of loading considered is inplane tensile loading, thus the discussion will be limited accordingly. The direction of applied loading relative to the orientation of the fibers will determine whether the composite exhibits fiberdominated behaviour or matrixdominated behaviour. Fiberdominated behaviour suggests that the fibers have a greater influence on the polymeric composite stressstrain response, while the opposite is true for matrixdominated composite behaviour. For example, a unidirectional PMC laminate with all plies oriented in the same direction, which is parallel to the loading direction as shown in Figure 6 (a), will clearly exhibit fiberdominated behaviour. The same would be the case for a PMC wovenply laminate with the loading condition shown in Figure 6 (b). Fiberdominated materials typically exhibit linear stressstrain behaviour [13]. Conversely, the same wovenply laminate with the warp fiber direction, 1, oriented at an angle  to the applied load as shown in Figure 6 (c) will likely exhibit matrixdominated behaviour. In this case, the properties of the matrix and perhaps the strength of the fibermatrix interface cohesion will dictate the stressstrain behaviour (which would typically be nonlinear), the development of damage and the fracture behaviour of the material [14].

Carbon fiber reinforced PMC materials that exhibit fiberdominated mechanical behaviour are less susceptible to the effects of an elevated temperature environment. This is due to the fact that the carbon fibers are fairly stable at elevated temperatures. Note that the degradation of the matrix constituent will likely cause changes in its localized deformation behaviour, which may result in slightly altered macroscopic mechanical properties for fiberdominated composites. Conversely, the mechanical response of matrixdominated carbon fiber reinforced PMC materials is more vulnerable to environmental effects due to the deterioration or reduction of the matrix material properties [15]. The degradation of the matrix constituent will directly influence the composite mechanical behaviour, the degree of which depends on the specific matrix material and the actual testing temperature.

3 Literature Survey and Background

3 LITERATURE SURVEY AND BACKGROUND
The following sections present an indepth literature survey and the applicable technical background regarding a number of aspects relevant to this study. First, a review of general fatigue theory will be introduced, followed by a literature survey of fatigue studies conducted on PMC materials. Next, a review on the influence of elevated temperature on polymer materials will be presented, followed by a literature survey of elevated temperature fatigue studies conducted on PMC materials. Since damage characterization is a central topic in this study, a discussion on fatigue damage characterization of various PMC materials will be presented, with a subsequent review of various damage monitoring techniques employed for PMC materials. Finally, a detailed literature survey on various types of fatigue models developed for PMC materials will be presented.

3.1 General Fatigue
As indicated in Chapter 1, structural components may fail when subjected to repeated loading well below the material ultimate strength, which is an important phenomenon for aerospace applications. This is true for almost all existing materials including metallic alloys, polymers and continuous fiber reinforced composite materials. Failure due to fatigue loading is caused by progressive localized damage which is induced by the fluctuating stresses (or strains). Fatigue loading in terms of fluctuating stresses will be considered in this discussion and within this study. Fatigue failure is typically initiated at a high stress concentration location caused by 16

3 Literature Survey and Background a discontinuity, or, on the microscopic scale, at a location of a material defect. There are three main components of the applied load that will determine the extent of fatigue damage in materials. The first is the magnitude of the maximum applied stress that the material is subjected to, which may include stress concentrations due to notches or singularities in the material. This is typically measured in terms of a stress ratio R (= min / max). The second is the magnitude of the fluctuation in the applied stress or the stress range, and the third is the total number of repeated cycles, n. Note that other factors such as ambient temperature and moisture can also influence the material fatigue damage characteristics. Also note that for composite materials, the fiber type and geometric arrangement of the fibers will also influence the fatigue behaviour [16]. Typical repeated stress cycles have a fluctuation with a magnitude of r, a stress amplitude of a, and a mean stress of mean. An ideal repeated stress cycle for tensiontension fatigue is shown in Figure 7. If the mean stress is equal to zero, the cycle is deemed completely reversed. The repeated stress cycle illustrated in Figure 7 is for an ideal case, where in some practical applications the stress cycles are typically random. However, for most fatigue studies including this study, this is the repeated stress cycle that is considered.

The stresslife or SN curve is the most basic way to represent the fatigue data in terms of stress as a function of the number of cycles to failure (Nf). Maximum stress, max, is typically plotted, however minimum stress or stress amplitude are occasionally plotted as functions of the log(Nf). Typical SN curves are shown in Figure 8, where the various curves represent

17

3 Literature Survey and Background different values of mean stress. An increasing mean stress has the effect of lowering the number of cycles to failure for a constant max as shown. It is also clear that with a higher applied repeated stress, the number of cycles to failure will be much lower which represents the highstrain lowcycle fatigue (LCF) region on the SN curve. Fatigue loading with a lower applied repeated stress will require more cycles before failure occurs which represents the low strain highcycle fatigue (HCF) region as indicated in Figure 8. Most materials exhibit different damage development and damage mechanisms in the HCF and LCF regimes, which ultimately controls failure for cyclic loading. The review by Harris [16] discusses these mechanisms for fiber reinforced PMC materials. For some metallic alloys, the SN curve becomes horizontal at a certain limiting stress, which is deemed as the material endurance limit or fatigue limit. Below this limiting stress, the material can theoretically endure an infinite number of cycles without failure. This of course is an ideal situation, where even materials with fatigue limits can fail under cyclic loading with a stress below the limit if the material is also subjected to a high temperature or humid environment. Figure 9 depicts the SN curves for common steel and aluminum alloys. As shown, steel typically has an endurance limit, while most nonferrous alloys like aluminum do not have this limit [17]. Composite materials are typically not found to have a fatigue limit, however most fatigue studies are discontinued without cycling at lower stress levels, thus it is uncertain whether a true fatigue limit actually exists for many composites [16].

For metallic alloys, determining the fatigue response and fatigue life for a component from available SN curves has become common practice in many industries, including the aerospace industry. An SN curve is often represented by an empirical logarithmic or power law relationship between the applied stress and the number of cycles to failure [18]. In addition, linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) is often employed for metallic components to perform damage tolerance analysis in the aerospace industry. At the outset, researchers that studied the fatigue behaviour of nonmetallic materials such as polymeric composites employed the same methods to predict fatigue life [19]. Although for some polymeric composites the same empirical methods used for metallic components may be satisfactory (i.e., analyses based on experimental SN curves or LEFM), the fact is that damage mechanisms are significantly different for composite materials [16]. Therefore, there was (and still is) a requirement for developing common practice procedures for reliably predicting the fatigue behaviour and the fatigue life for PMC materials. As a result, other mechanical parameters such as the evolving material stiffness became indicators of fatigue damage development and criterion for fatigue failure prediction [20, 21]. A literature survey with focus on a number of studies conducted on fatigue of fiberreinforced PMC materials will be presented in the subsequent section.

3 Literature Survey and Background

3.2 Literature Survey on PMC Fatigue
Conventional composites consist of two (or more) distinct constituent materials or phases at the macroscopic level, which are combined to form an inhomogeneous and anisotropic material. As a result, continuous fiber reinforced polymeric composites exhibit markedly different material behaviour relative to homogeneous and isotropic materials such as metallic alloys. This in turn makes it difficult to determine the fatigue properties and predict fatigue failure of continuous fiber reinforced PMC materials. Early research showed that fiber reinforced PMC laminates were superior to metals based on a fatigue life comparison [16]. In fact many researchers falsely believed that these composite materials did not suffer from fatigue failure, which initiated the use of composite materials for many industrial applications. After appreciable inservice use of composite structural components, it eventually became common knowledge that composite materials do not have the same fatigue failure mechanisms as metals. As a result, over the past four decades a number of studies have investigated the uniaxial inplane fatigue behaviour of various unnotched unidirectionalply continuous fiber PMC laminates, including unidirectional, crossply, angleply and quasiisotropic layups [20  50]. Most of these studies focussed on glass fiber or carbon fiber reinforced thermosetting epoxies. In recent years, a number of studies have focussed on the fatigue behaviour and characterization of continuous fiber reinforced wovenply laminates [51  58], as well as other fabric reinforced laminates [59  63]. It should be noted however that there are few studies currently available in the open literature that have focussed on the fatigue behaviour and damage characterization of braided fabric composites [13, 6468]. The following paragraphs will discuss the details of a number of the aforementioned fatigue studies. Some of the initial fatigue studies on unidirectionalply PMC laminates focussed on developing SN curves and strength criteria for specific composites. Hashin and Rotem [22] developed macroscopic fatigue failure criteria for an elementary lamina, while Reifsnider and Gao [35] developed more general fatigue failure criteria. These and similar studies did not focus on the developing damage during cyclic loading, which is important to understanding and predicting fatigue behaviour of PMC laminates. It is well established that the complex damage patterns observed in unidirectionalply laminates consist of matrix cracks, fiber fractures, fiber

20

3 Literature Survey and Background matrix interface debonding, interply delamination cracks and their respective interactions. As a result, a number of researchers focussed on relating the observed damage or a damage parameter to the mechanical properties of the laminates. One of the initial approaches was to relate the strength of the material, or the residual strength, to the evolving damage state. Studies by Broutman and Sahu [23], Hahn and Kim [24], Rotem [27] and more recently Whitworth [44] investigated the residual strength of glass or carbon reinforced polymers. Since it was observed that fatigue induced damage progressively increased as the number of load cycles increased, the strength of the laminate would naturally decrease with increasing damage. A schematic of the strength degradation, or residual strength, for a laminate is shown in Figure 10. The hypothesis is that once the residual strength decreases to the magnitude of the maximum applied stress, failure occurs. The schematic process depicted in Figure 10 may be a realistic representation of the composite residual strength. Although the residual strength is a meaningful indicator for determining the extent of fatigue damage in composites, determining its magnitude requires destructive evaluation of test specimens which is not a practical approach.

Another approach adopted by many researchers is to relate the residual stiffness of composite laminates to the evolving damage states. As PMC laminates accumulate fatigue induced damage, the stiffness typically decreases due to the added compliance in the laminate caused by the opening of the internal crack faces. Since Salkind [69] originally suggested that

21

3 Literature Survey and Background changes in stiffness may be an appropriate measure of fatigue damage in composites, numerous researchers have investigated the effectiveness of residual stiffness as a measure of fatigue damage. Studies by Hahn and Kim [20] and O'Brien and Reifsnider [25] investigated the usefulness of the secant or dynamic modulus as an indicator of fatigue damage. Additional studies by Hashin [29], Hwang and Han [31], Whitworth [32, 33, 43], and Yang et al. [34] among others have considered the degradation of the fatigue or dynamic modulus as indicators of fatigue damage. Unlike the residual strength, the residual stiffness is a parameter that can be monitored nondestructively and thus be used to continuously track fatigue damage development. The residual stiffness can in fact be related to the residual strength as was investigated by Whitworth [32], which renders the residual stiffness as a practical indicator of fatigue damage. In more recent years, other mechanical properties of cyclically loaded PMC laminates that can be monitored nondestructively have been investigated to determine whether they are appropriate indicators of fatigue damage development. Ellyin and ElKadi [36] investigated the mechanical energy input during fatigue loading of glass/epoxy laminates. More recently, a similar study was conducted by Shokrieh and TaheriBehrooz [48] on both glass/epoxy and carbon/epoxy laminates. Giancane et al. [50] monitored the energy dissipated on a cycleby cycle basis for crossply laminates, and correlated that with the development of fatigue damage. Petermann and Schulte [47] studied the evolution of the mean strain for angleply laminates and concluded that the mean strain was a more meaningful indicator of fatigue damage development. VanPaepegem et al. [70] investigated the effectiveness of the Poisson ratio as an indicator of fatigue damage development in unidirectional and crossply laminates. In these studies, as well as the presented studies that considered the residual stiffness, an attempt was made to nondestructively monitor a particular material property and correlate that with the fatigue damage development. The material properties such as the residual stiffness are effective indicators of the evolving hysteretic material behaviour. A schematic of the typical evolution of a composite material stressstrain curve during stresscontrolled tensile cyclic loading is shown in Figure 11. As shown, the slope of the stressstrain curve (i.e., dynamic stiffness) decreases from the initial cycle with a value of E(1) to a value of E(m) during cycle m,

Note that the fatigue modulus of cycle k, Efatigue(k), is also shown for reference as this was considered by some researchers [31]. Shifting of the stressstrain curve (i.e., ratcheting deformation) has also been observed to occur in PMC materials during stresscontrolled cyclic loading under a positive mean stress [49]. It is evident that the mean strain continuously increases during cycling, as is indicated by the mean strain for cycle m, mean(m). The increasing mean strain is not only a consequence of the stiffness degradation, but also in part due to stressstrain ratcheting. In fact, the evolution of the fatigue modulus also accounts for both stiffness degradation and ratcheting in its definition. Stiffness degradation is typically a result of damage accumulation. Ratcheting can be caused by damage accumulation resulting from crack faces not closing perfectly upon unloading [71], and potentially creep deformation [47]. Therefore, monitoring the fatigue modulus or the mean strain includes combined effects of fatigue damage and potential creep deformation. Also, the area enclosed by the stressstrain ellipses (i.e., energy dissipated) tends to change during cyclic loading [50]. Energy dissipated during cyclic loading also may be a result of both the damage development and local viscous deformation behaviour of the polymer matrix [72]. It should be noted that the evolving material hysteretic behaviour not only depends on the type of reinforcing fibers and their arrangement, but also on the loading parameters and the environmental conditions (e.g., ambient temperature or humidity).

3 Literature Survey and Background For the studies conducted on wovenply and other textile fabric reinforced PMC materials, the dynamic stiffness is often considered as an indicator of fatigue damage accumulation [57, 59]. Studies by Pandita et al. [51] on plain wovenply glass/epoxy laminates, and by Quaresimin [52] on 2x2 twill wovenply carbon/epoxy laminates investigated the stiffness degradation during cyclic loading which was qualitatively correlated to the damage development. Tate and Kelkar [13] and Kelkar and Whitcomb [66] investigated the stiffness degradation and damage development in biaxial braided carbon/epoxy composites. Few similar studies on any other types of braided composites are available in the open literature. In fact, a comprehensive fatigue study on triaxial braided carbon reinforced PMC materials has not been published in the open literature.

3.3 Elevated Temperature Behaviour of Polymers
The use of composite materials for elevated temperature applications has considerably increased in recent years. Metalmatrix composites (MMC) and ceramicmatrix composites (CMC) have been successfully used for supersonic aircraft and space vehicle airframes, and for propulsion system components due to their excellent resistance to the effects of heat. As indicated however, the integration of polymeric composite materials into the propulsion systems of modern commercial and military aircraft has not experienced a great deal of advancement. A new generation of high glass transition temperature (Tg) polymers have been developed since the 1980's, which have been recently considered for jet engine composite component design. These elevated temperature PMC materials are candidates to replace MMC or CMC for components with service operating temperatures in the 150°C  350°C range. Elevated temperature exposure of these PMC materials will undoubtedly add additional material property degradation effects, as well as the potential influence of local creep deformation on the fatigue damage mechanisms for longterm exposure. Understanding the behaviour of the polymer matrix at elevated temperatures is crucial for understanding the fiber reinforced composite behaviour at elevated temperatures, which is important for investigating the stiffness degradation (among other material properties) and its relationship to damage development during cyclic loading.

24

3 Literature Survey and Background According to their molecular structure and behaviour, polymers are typically classified as being either thermosetting or thermoplastic. The main difference between these types of polymers is that thermosetting polymers have crosslinked molecular structures that contain strong covalent bonds, whereas thermoplastics consist of branchedchain molecules with weak intermolecular bonds [6]. Thermosetting polymers are created by an elevated temperature chemical reaction (i.e., curing or crosslinking) that is irreversible. Thermosetting polymers are more often used to manufacture composites in the aerospace industry, thus the following discussion will focus on thermosetting polymers. Some examples of conventional thermosetting polymers often used for manufacturing fiber reinforced composites are epoxies, polyesters, phenolics and silicone. At room temperature, thermosetting polymers typically exhibit glassy (brittle) behaviour, whereas at elevated temperatures near their Tg they typically begin to exhibit rubbery (viscoelastic) behaviour. This is exemplified through a schematic plot of the logarithm of the modulus as a function of temperature as shown in Figure 12. At temperatures well below the Tg, thermosetting polymers have an almost constant modulus. The modulus begins to notably decrease as the glasstransition temperature is approached. Note, however, that there is typically a small reduction in the modulus due to the highly crosslinked molecular structure of thermosetting polymers. The timedependent or ratedependent behaviour of thermosetting polymers is schematically illustrated in the stressstrain plots of Figure 13 (a). Some thermosetting polymers can also exhibit the timedependent or viscoelastic stressstrain behaviour depicted in Figure 13(a) at temperatures well below their Tg [73]. Typical creep behaviour of polymers is illustrated in Figure 13(b), which is the strain response over time of a polymer with a constant applied tensile stress.

In order to improve the elevated temperature capabilities and increase the service temperature limits of thermosetting polymers, the Tg can effectively be increased. As indicated, a number of high Tg thermosetting polymers have been developed in recent years. One of the commercially available polyimide resins that was initially developed by NASA is PMR15 [74], which has been employed in some aerospace structural applications. Due to the successful development and wide regard of PMR15, additional polyimide resins were subsequently developed for high temperature composite applications. NASA also developed AMB21 [75], DMBZ15 [76] and RP46 high temperature resins. These thermosetting polyimide resins have

26

3 Literature Survey and Background similar properties and temperature capabilities as PMR15, but without the hazardous carcinogenic compounds. Dupont developed a thermoplastic polyimide Avimid K3B, which has been considered for supersonic transport aircraft [77]. A number of additional polyimide resins such as R116, PETI5 and PIXA have also been considered for PMC components on supersonic aircraft [5]. Finally, a number of high temperature BMI resins have also been developed and used in the industry. Common BMI resins include 5250 and 5260 developed by Cytec Engineered Materials, as well as F6552 developed by Hexcel Corporation. These BMI resins were designed for high temperature applications, as well as for processing using RTM [78] which is an advantage over many polyimide resins. A list of the glass transition temperature ranges for conventional epoxies, BMI and polyimide thermosetting polymers is shown in Table 3, which also includes the Tg for some specific resins. As shown, the glass transition temperature range, and thus the service temperature range, is significantly higher for BMI and polyimide resins relative to conventional epoxies. Although a number of high temperature polymers and their respective fiberreinforced composites have been developed, there has been little use of these materials in high temperature primary load bearing aerospace applications. The subsequent section outlines some noteworthy studies focussed on elevated temperature fatigue of fiber reinforced PMC materials.

3.4 Literature Survey on PMC Elevated Temperature Fatigue
Most PMC elevated temperature studies available in the open literature focus on temperaturedependent material property degradation during static or isothermal aging

27

3 Literature Survey and Background conditions. There are few studies that consider fatigue loading at elevated temperatures, as is indicated in the review by Montesano et al. [79]. High temperature exposure during cyclic mechanical loading undoubtedly augments the matrix material behaviour and the development of damage mechanisms due to the potentially complex thermomechanical interactions. Additional property degradation mechanisms such as physical and chemical aging may also continuously alter the composite properties with time, specifically impacting the polymer matrix behaviour. The influence of the timedependent material behaviour on the fatigue damage mechanisms will be more significant at severe operating temperatures. This may in fact also be the case at temperatures well below the Tg of the polymer matrix for particular composites [80]. Although the temperature sensitivity of the polymer matrix ultimately governs the microscopic behaviour of a fiber reinforced PMC material, the macroscopic cyclic behaviour at elevated temperatures is still primarily dictated by the arrangement of the reinforcing fibers relative to the loading direction. Therefore, the degree of influence that an elevated temperature environment has on the composite behaviour is strongly, but not entirely, dependent on whether the material exhibits fiberdominated or matrixdominated behaviour (see Figure 6). This will be further discussed in the following paragraph. Some studies that focussed on the elevated temperature tensile fatigue behaviour of unidirectionalply PMC materials have been reported during the last two decades [5, 8190]. Most of these studies consider carbon/polymer laminates with various layups such as unidirectional, crossply, quasiisotropic and angleply. Studies by Uematsu et al. [83] and Sjogren and Asp [86] correlated the growth of delamination cracking with temperature for unidirectional composites subjected to cyclic loading. Both studies concluded that elevated temperatures accelerated delamination crack growth rates, and that the influence of temperature was mainly manifested through localized viscoelasticity at the crack tips. A similar study by Gregory and Spearing [88] also reported that fatigue delamination crack propagation rates were higher at elevated temperatures, but the quasistatic fracture toughness was in fact higher for the laminate at elevated temperatures. A similar study by Uematsu et al. [90] was later conducted with a PMR15 unidirectional composite. They found that there was absolutely no creep or timedependent effects on the composite behaviour during fatigue at 300°C. It

28

3 Literature Survey and Background should be noted that in all four studies, double cantilever beam and/or flexure test specimens were used to propagate delamination cracks. It is therefore unclear from the literature whether or not delamination cracks will have the same influence during uniaxial cyclic loading. A study by Shimokawa et al. [5] on quasiisotropic BMI laminates and by Sun et al. [87] on unidirectional and crossply epoxy laminates showed that fatigue tests at elevated temperatures had minimal effects on the resulting SN curves when compared to the SN curves obtained for the same laminates at room temperature. The specimens in these studies exhibited fiberdominated behaviour. A similar study by Branco et al. [82] on glass/phenolic unidirectional composites reported that an elevated temperature environment had a slight influence on the exhibited stiffness degradation. A study by Kawai et al. [85] on a series of unidirectional (onaxis) and angleply (offaxis) polyimide and epoxy laminates revealed that temperature notably influenced the SN curves for the offaxis tests, but did not notably affect the SN curves for the onaxis tests. It was also reported that matrix ductility was enhanced at elevated temperatures, but fibermatrix bonding was weaker. Clearly, the fiberdominated composites are not nearly as influenced by the elevated temperature relative to the matrixdominated or offaxis composites. Few elevated temperature fatigue studies on wovenply laminates have been reported in the literature [15, 72, 9193]. Gyekenyesi et al. [91] studied the elevated temperature fatigue behaviour of a satin woven carbon/polyimide laminate, while Shimokawa et al. [93] studied a plain woven carbon/epoxy laminate. Both studies concluded that the elevated temperature environment had minimal influence on the fiberdominated laminate fatigue behaviour. A similar study by Kawai and Taniguchi [15] on onaxis and offaxis plainwoven carbon/epoxy laminates reported that the offaxis specimens were significantly influenced by elevated temperatures, while the influence was notably less for the onaxis specimens. A study by Montesano et al. [72] on offaxis satin woven carbon/BMI laminates also reported a strong influence of temperature on the stiffness degradation, ratcheting and energy dissipation behaviour during cyclic loading. Similar to the unidirectionalply laminates, the offaxis woven ply laminates are notably influenced by elevated temperatures due to their matrixdominated configurations. Note that until the present date, there are no studies in the open literature that

29

3 Literature Survey and Background focus on elevated temperature fatigue of any type of braided PMC material. Since the general material behaviour and microscopic damage development will vary for a braided composite compared to either unidirectionalply or wovenply laminates, a study on braided composites is consequently required. Details of the development of fatigue damage for various types of PMC materials will be discussed in the following section.

3.5 Fatigue Damage Characterization Theory
For many homogeneous and isotropic materials such as metallic alloys, the damage processes that lead to fatigue failure are well established and understood. For metallic alloys, it has been commonly observed that fatigue damage occurs in four main stages: crack initiation, stage I crack growth, stage II crack growth, and rapid crack growth leading to ultimate ductile failure [17]. Crack initiation in a metallic alloy can be caused by the existence of secondphase particles or microvoids. Although the macroscopically applied stress may be elastic, local plastic deformation will cause dislocations to slip. Dislocation pileups can occur at the location of these secondphase particles or microvoids, which causes high localized stresses and the formation of microcracks. Stage I crack growth or slipband crack growth involves the deepening of the initial crack on planes of high shear stress (i.e., intergranular crack propagation). Stage II crack growth involves the growth of a well defined crack in the direction normal to the loading axis (i.e., transgranular crack propagation). The final stage involves the propagating crack reaching a critical length so that the remaining section cannot support the load, which leads to rapid crack propagation and ultimately component failure. Although micro cracks initiate in metallic alloys subjected to cyclic loading, one main crack eventually forms and propagates which leads to failure. Methods based on LEFM are typically employed to predict the crack propagation rates during cyclic loading [17]. For inhomogeneous and anisotropic materials like continuous fiber reinforced polymeric composite materials, the fatigue damage processes are much more complex. Microscopic damage is observed to be widespread or diffused throughout the materials [16], and not only locally in the eventual fracture region as is observed in metallic alloys. Damage commences after only a few load cycles, thus there is gradual stiffness loss in the damaged areas of the

30

3 Literature Survey and Background material which leads to a continuous redistribution of localized stress during cyclic loading. The accurate prediction of the fatigue behaviour, and thus the fatigue life, is consequently a difficult task. Moreover, many different damage mechanisms are observed in PMC materials which are strongly dependent on the type of fiber arrangement and the particular layup for laminated composites. The interaction of damage modes can also significantly influence the crack development states and ultimately the fatigue performance. In addition, the reinforcing fibers may act to mitigate cracking in the matrix material, which will also directly influence the fatigue behaviour. For this reason, fracture mechanicsbased methods are typically not applicable to fiber reinforced PMC materials. Since fatigue damage is cumulative in PMC materials, damage mechanicsbased methods are typically employed. Schematic plots of the quantitative damage development as a function of the number of loading cycles for monolithic and composites materials are shown in Figure 14. As indicated, cracking during the early part of cycling for metallic alloys occurs with a very low growth rate, after which a single dominant crack begins to propagate. In composite materials, damage begins to accumulate extensively early on during cycling and continues through until specimen failure occurs. This is a direct consequence of the local heterogeneity of composite materials and the mismatch between the fiber and matrix constituent material properties. The matrix constituent typically has a much lower strength compared to the reinforcing fibers. Thus, upon the initial application of a cyclic load local cracking in the matrix occurs throughout the composite. Local stress concentrations at the fibermatrix interfaces also cause interface crack initiation upon the application of loading. The mechanisms of fatigue crack growth and initiation are quite complex in composite materials. In order to understand why fiber reinforced polymeric composite materials fail when subjected to cyclic loads below their ultimate strengths, an in depth characterization of their physical microscopic damage development processes is imperative. Regardless of the reinforcing fiber arrangement, all fiber reinforced PMC materials will exhibit three basic modes of localized damage: cracking in the matrix constituent, fracture of the fibers and fibermatrix interfacial debonding [16]. A schematic of these common localized damage modes is shown in Figure 15 (a)(c). Fracture of individual fibers can typically be characterized as nonprogressive due to their sudden fracture behaviour. This is due to the brittle nature of many conventional

31

3 Literature Survey and Background fibers such as carbon or glass which deform elastically until they reach their respective failure strains. Matrix cracks and interfacial debonding cracks are progressive in nature, and their propagating length depends on the number of applied loading cycles. As indicated, polymer matrix materials are much weaker than their reinforcing fibers, thus local stress concentrations which cause high local strains in the matrix during cyclic loading initiate cracking. Interfacial debonding cracks are a result of high shear stresses at the fibermatrix interfaces due to the mismatch of the fiber and matrix material properties. Additional damage modes and the interaction of these damage modes will depend on the specific fiber arrangement, as will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

3 Literature Survey and Background Damage characterization of unidirectionalply PMC laminates has been somewhat well established over the past few decades. The study by Salkind [69] was one of the first reported studies which characterized fatigue damage in fiber reinforced PMC laminates. In addition to the localized modes of damage such as matrix cracking, fiber fracture, and interfacial debonding (see Figure 15), additional damage modes include interply cracking (i.e., delamination) between adjacent plies caused by shear stresses at the ply interfaces. The orientation of the matrix cracks within the laminate plies depends upon the orientation of the ply with respect to the loading direction. Plies oriented along the loading direction tend to develop matrix cracks normal to the fibers in the transverse direction, as well as splitting type cracks along the fiber direction (often at the fibermatrix interfaces). Plies oriented transverse to the loading direction develop matrix cracks in the transverse direction along the direction of the fibers (often at the fibermatrix interfaces), while offaxis plies also typically develop matrix cracks that initially propagate perpendicular to the applied load and then along the fiber directions. Matrix cracks within all the plies of laminates typically develop during the early stages of cycling, often after the very first loading cycle [94], and are generally the first form of damage observed in a laminate along with fibermatrix interfacial debonding. In a multiorientation laminate, the transverse and offaxis plies will typically exhibit significantly more cracking relative to the on axis plies. Matrix cracks will often propagate until they reach a fibermatrix interface and either cause the failure of the fiber for a weak fiber [95], or continue to propagate along the fiber matrix interface as an interfacial debond due to high shear stresses. Matrix cracks typically extend through the entire thickness of a ply and are generally unable to propagate into the adjacent ply, particularly if that ply orientation is different. These arrested cracks generate high localized stresses at their tips, which provide favourable conditions for initiating interply delamination cracks [6]. An image of extensive matrix cracking in the transverse plies of a cross ply laminate are shown in Figure 16 (a), while Figure 16 (b) shows the propagation of a delamination crack initiated at the tip of a matrix crack in a transverse ply.

The progression of fatigue damage in unidirectionalply laminates typically begins with extensive matrix cracking in offaxis and/or transverse plies during the initial stage of cycling, which is accompanied by the growth of interfacial debonding cracks. Additional fibermatrix debonding cracks will then form, as well as interply delamination cracks, which initiate and propagate during the second stage of cycling which is a long portion of the laminate fatigue life. Splitting type cracks will also form during the latter part of the second stage of cyclic loading, weakening the onaxis plies. This eventually leads to a localized region of high crack accumulation which induces local fiber fracture, which ultimately causes the final failure event during the third stage of cycling. It was in fact reported by Highsmith and Reifsnider [26] that many laminates, including crossply laminates, reach a state of damage saturation by the end of the first stage of cyclic loading, which was deemed a characteristic damage state (CDS). Matrix cracks within the transverse plies gradually propagate and eventually arrest at the ply interfaces and at fiber locations. When these transverse cracks reach a state in which the crack spacing is consistent, the CDS has been achieved. Thereafter, the existing cracks within a transverse ply act to reduce the stress locally which inhibits any further crack development within the ply. As a result, delamination cracks between adjacent plies begin to propagate after the CDS is attained. A schematic of the discussed development of fatigue damage for crossply laminates is shown in Figure 17. The events corresponding to the aforementioned three stages of cyclic loading and to the damage parameter profile are indicated. Note that the laminate

The study by Cain [96] discussed damage scenarios for particular unidirectionalply laminate layups. Also, the study by Hahn and Kim [20] discussed the overview of damage development in quasi isotropic laminates and the firstply failure phenomenon. In both studies, the damage mechanisms discussed in the previous paragraph contribute to the overall laminate damage development and failure events.

3 Literature Survey and Background Fatigue damage characterization of wovenply laminates has not been as widely studied as for unidirectionalply laminates. The orientation of the crimped woven fiber yarns in the warp and weft directions undoubtedly influences the development of fatigue damage and the type of damage mechanisms observed. The specific type of weave pattern (i.e., plain weave, 2x2 twill weave, satin weave) will also influence the progression of fatigue damage. As with unidirectionalply laminates, localized matrix cracking, fiber fracture and interfacial debonding are also observed in wovenply laminates (see Figure 15). However, the development of these localized cracks does significantly change for woven laminates. Some studies that focussed on the onaxis tensile fatigue behaviour of woven laminates have shown that extensive cracking in the weft (or transverse) yarns and notable intraply debonding (or metadelamination) between adjacent fiber yarns are commonly observed damage mechanisms [51, 52]. Cracks in the weft yarns are observed to be a combination of series of local matrix cracks and fibermatrix interfacial debonds, which have formed into a continuous crack propagating along the fiber yarn axis and through the thickness of the yarn [51, 97]. The initiation of cracks within the weft yarns are due to the high localized stresses at the fibermatrix interfaces and the stress concentrations within the matrix. Since the weft fiber yarns are normal to the applied load, weft yarn cracks tend to propagate as mode I cracks (i.e., opening mode). Weft yarn cracks were also observed to propagate into adjacent matrixrich zones, and also combine with weft yarn cracks in adjacent weft yarns [97]. The intraply debonding cracks are mainly observed to initiate at the tip of weft yarn cracks, and are due to the high stress concentrations at the crack tips. These cracks propagate as mode II cracks due to the shear stresses generated between the warp and weft yarns at the yarn crossover locations. Few interply delamination cracks and warp yarn cracks were observed for onaxis woven laminates, while fiber fractures only occurred prior to failure [52]. A study by Montesano et al. [14] also found that there were few delamination cracks throughout the duration of cyclic loading for a satin woven laminate, but reported notable cracking in the warp yarns propagating like splitting type cracks. A schematic of the expected development of fatigue damage based on the discussed damage mechanisms for onaxis plain woven laminates is shown in Figure 18. Note that the crack scenarios shown in Figure 18 are with respect to a plane perpendicular to the weft yarns (i.e., parallel to the

36

3 Literature Survey and Background applied tensile load). Studies on tensile fatigue of offaxis woven laminates [51, 52, 97] have reported that cracking occurs in the offaxis warp and weft yarns, while fiber yarn reorientation leads to localized delamination and ultimately fiber fracture.

Although braided fabric resembles woven fabric, the damage mechanics concepts of woven composites cannot be directly applied to braided composites. This is due to the fact that woven fabrics contain fiber yarns in only the warp and weft directions (i.e., 0 and 90 directions), whereas braided fabrics contain yarns that are oriented in the +/ directions, as shown in Figure 3 (a) and (b) respectively. For the case of braided composites, very little work has been reported on fatigue damage characterization and the correlation between the evolving microscopic damage and macroscopic properties such as stiffness. Studies by Tate, Kelkar and Whitcomb [67] and Kelkar and Whitcomb [66] characterized the fatigue behaviour of biaxially braided carbon/epoxy composites. The studies reported that notable stiffness degradation was exhibited by the biaxial braided composites; however, the studies did not report any details of the observed microscopic damage mechanisms. A similar study by Huang et al. [68] on biaxial braided carbon/epoxy composites reported that splitting in the braider

37

3 Literature Survey and Background yarns and delamination was found at the fracture surface when the biaxial braided composites were subjected to certain maximum stresses. However, the study only reported observations made at the fracture surface and did not attempt to characterize the progression of damage during the tensiontension fatigue tests. A study by Burr and Morris [64] on twodimensional triaxial braided graphite/epoxy composites reported that during tensiontension fatigue testing in the warp direction, cracks within the braider yarns and cracking in the matrix richregions were the first visible damage mechanisms. At latter stages in cycling, the axial yarns began to disbond from the surrounding constituents, which occurred until specimen failure which involved rapid fracture of the axial fiber yarns. There was however no direct correlation between the observed damage development and the exhibited stiffness loss. Clearly, additional research is required for characterizing tensiontension fatigue damage development in triaxial braided composites. A depiction of the observed or expected damage modes in triaxial braided composites loaded in the warp direction can still be made at this stage based on the limited observations reported in the literature. Since braider yarns are oriented in an offaxis direction, damage within these yarns during tensile fatigue loading will include cracking in the matrixrich zones and fibermatrix interface debonding within the yarns. This is due to the high stress concentrations in the matrix and at the fibermatrix interfaces within the fiber yarns. These type of cracks have been extensively observed in braided composites subjected to tensile static loading [98, 99], and are schematically shown in Figure 19 for a 2x2 triaxial braided composite. The braider yarn cracks would tend to propagate as mixed mode I and mode II cracks along the braider yarn axis, due to the local perpendicular tensile loading and shear loading on the crack faces. Cracks in the braider yarns are in fact a combination of a series of local matrix cracks and fibermatrix interfacial debonds, which have formed into a continuous crack propagating along the fiber yarn axis and through the thickness of the yarn [99] as shown in the figure. Cracking in the warp yarns may also occur, which is analogous to splitting type cracks in unidirectional laminates. Note however that due to crimping of the warp yarns caused by the braiding process, cracking in the warp yarns may be limited in appearance. This in fact was observed by Masters and Ifju [99]. Local cracking at the braider yarn and warp yarn interfaces (i.e.,

38

3 Literature Survey and Background debonding) have also been reported in the study by Burr and Morris [64], and are shown schematically in Figure 19. These may in fact be initiated at the locations of the braider yarn cracks due to the high stresses at the crack tips [100]. Interfacial debonding cracks will propagate as mixed mode II and mode III cracks due to the high shear stresses at the warp yarn and braider yarn crossover locations. The development of large delamination cracks, or large scale debonding, between the braided layers is another potential damage mechanism. The study by Ivanov et al. [100] reported that there was no preferential role of the edges in inducing damage and there were no largescale delaminations observed during tensile static loading. This in fact was also reported in the study by Masters and Ifju [99]. Cracks may also develop in the resinrich zones between fiber yarns, which is shown in the figure. The main damage modes identified in triaxial braided composites are: (i) cracks propagating within the braider yarns in the matrix and at the fibermatrix interfaces, (ii) matrix cracks propagating within the resinrich zones between fiber yarns, (iii) cracks propagating at the interfaces between adjacent fiber yarns, and (iv) cracks propagating within the warp yarns. These damage modes will hereafter be referred to as braider yarn cracks, matrix cracks, interface cracks, and warp yarn cracks, respectively. Since fatigue damage characterization for a triaxial braided composite is one of the main focuses in this study, additional discussions will be presented in Chapter 5.

3 Literature Survey and Background The evolution of damage in textile fabric reinforced composites is notably more complex compared with unidirectionalply laminates as was shown in Figure 18 and Figure 19. The influence of the observed damage mechanisms on the textile composite material properties (such as stiffness) during cyclic loading is an area of research that requires much needed attention. In order to investigate the damage development during cyclic loading, non destructive techniques must be employed. The following chapter presents a number of non destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques that have been adopted by many researchers, with an emphasis on the techniques to be used in this study.

3.6 Literature Survey on Damage Monitoring Techniques
Damage monitoring or damage detection is one of the biggest challenges in determining the damage events that lead to failure in composite materials. There have been numerous destructive and nondestructive techniques applied for detecting damage in PMC materials. Applying these techniques during fatigue loading presents additional difficulties, while fatigue testing at elevated temperatures poses even more complications. The subsequent paragraphs provide a literature survey on NDE damage monitoring techniques that have been employed for PMC materials, and their relevance for fatigue testing at elevated temperatures. Extensive detail will be provided for the particular NDE techniques used in this study. Many techniques exist that can detect actual damage in PMC materials such as matrix cracks, while other techniques simply monitor material properties in order to follow the evolution of damage. As discussed in Section 3.2, residual strength measurements and monitoring of the residual stiffness can be used as indicators of damage during cyclic loading. Also, monitoring the electrical resistance of components can yield insight on the evolving damage state of a material. For detecting the actual damage mechanisms, various optical, acoustic, radiographic, thermographic, and local strainbased methods have been successfully employed for PMC materials. One of the first established techniques for monitoring damage development in PMC materials was xray radiography, which has been adopted in many fatigue studies [101105]. To employ xray radiography, a liquid penetrate such as iodine must be injected into the sample every time an xray image is obtained. This requires damage

40

3 Literature Survey and Background propagation from a surface or an edge, which is why this technique is often employed for notched test specimens. This is however limiting because if the liquid penetrate does not reach the damage 'cavities' or if the damage zone is not known a priori, damage may go undetected. There are also obvious health risks if using a toxic penetrate, and through xray exposure. In spite of its limitations, xray radiography has been employed to successfully detect matrix cracking and delamination in crossply and quasiisotropic laminates [103, 104]. Another well established NDE technique is ultrasonic scanning, including cscanning and ascanning, which have also been extensively employed for many fatigue studies [106109]. These techniques require either pulseecho or throughtransmission coupled transmitter/receiver sensors to be placed on the specimen surface(s). The transmitted or reflected acoustic waves will undergo a change in amplitude if damage is present in the material. These ultrasonic techniques were successfully employed for detecting matrix cracking and delamination in laminates, but the poor resolution of the obtained images makes it difficult to distinguish certain damage modes which limits the usefulness of this technique. One of the main drawbacks with radiographic and ultrasonic NDE techniques is that they cannot be employed insitu since the test specimen must be removed from the test apparatus for the methods to be used. As a result, additional NDE techniques were developed for PMC materials with insitu capabilities such as light microscopy (LM), acoustic emission (AE), infrared thermography (IRT), and edge replication (ER). Light microscopy has been effectively used to visualize matrix cracks and delamination zones in a number of studies [59, 60, 110113]. The technique effectively involves illuminating the sample on one surface which allows light to penetrate through it, while using a high resolution microscope and camera to capture images of the opposite surface. Although light microscopy can be very effective in visualizing actual cracks, its application is limited to glass fiber reinforced PMC materials with a relatively transparent matrix. It has not been used for detecting damage in carbon fiber reinforced PMC materials, and may be difficult to apply in a high temperature environment without pausing the test. AE has also become an established NDE technique for PMC materials, being successfully employed for detecting fatigue damage in PMC materials [58, 113115]. Sensors are coupled to the specimen surfaces in order to detect acoustic noise emitted during the development of

41

3 Literature Survey and Background damage processes. Although all forms of damage have been reported to be detected using AE, the sensitivity of the sensors to ambient noise (including the loading machine) make characterization of the unfiltered signals very difficult. Also, distinguishing the different forms of damage from the varying acoustic intensity levels is very difficult. Equally difficult is the task of coupling the sensors to the specimen surface in a high temperature environment. Another technique that can be employed to continuously monitor fatigue damage development insitu for any type of material in a noncontact manner is IRT. A number of studies have successfully employed IRT techniques to monitor damage development in PMC materials [56, 60, 113, 116118]. IRT is a measurement technique that relies on the use of an infrared (IR) camera to provide a timedependent contour map of the surface temperature (i.e., thermographs) of the material under investigation. This technique involves decoding temperature information which results from the IR radiation emitted by an object. Post processing software is typically employed to process the captured images. There are two main types of IRT techniques regularly employed for composite materials: active thermography and passive thermography. Active thermography involves actively heating the specimen to monitor the temperature gradients during heating or cooling using an IR camera. Since damage initiation and propagation events during both static and cyclic loading are associated with the release of energy in the form of heat, passive thermography is an alternate approach that has gained considerable attention for damage detection of composites subjected to cyclic loading [56, 60, 113, 118]. Passive IRT is an effective tool for indirectly monitoring damage development in realtime over a large surface area. One of the main drawbacks with passive IRT is that smallscale damage cannot always be detected, which is limited by the pixel resolution of the IR camera. The passive approach is ideal for cyclic loading because the resulting hysteretic heating allows for a timedependent temperature variation which can be monitored with the IR camera. The recorded images can then be analyzed to determine the material fatigue strength or to understand damage initiation and development. Analyzing thermographic images can however be a challenge since the detected temperature rise may be due to a number of different factors. For composite materials subjected to cyclic loading, intrinsic energy dissipation caused by internal irreversible mechanisms such as damage development and local

42

3 Literature Survey and Background viscous heating of the matrix will be detected as heat dissipation by the IR camera. A passive IRT technique is employed in this study, and will be further discussed in Chapter 4. An additional well established NDE technique for detecting damage development in composite materials is ER. Replication techniques have been successfully employed insitu to monitor fatigue damage developed for PMC materials in many studies [96, 119]. ER provides a local imprint of the actual damage state from the specimen edge, and a chronology of damage throughout the loading process. A major drawback is that the test must be paused in order to apply the technique. A second drawback is that damage in the specimen interior cannot be detected using ER. The method involves the use of a thin transparent film covered by acetone which is applied to the polished edge of a test specimen. The material microstructure and associated damage is then imprinted on the film (or replica), which can be subsequently inspected using an optical microscope or a scanning electron microscope (SEM). This technique was also employed in this study, thus further details will be presented in Chapter 4. In order to monitor the local strains associated with microscopic cracking, insitu micro scale strain measurements have been employed as an indirect gage of damage development in composites. One commonly employed technique is digital image correlation (DIC) which is a noncontact technique, while a second technique that has been extensively employed for PMC materials is the use of surfacebonded or embedded fiber optic sensors (FOS). Since in the present study FOS were used, the subsequent discussion will focus on their theory and application. Numerous studies have reported successful detection of various modes of damage in PMC materials such as matrix cracking, delamination and fiber fracture using FOS [120123]. The main drawback with FOS is that they detect local damage only and do not provide an overall map of damage. This can however be remedied by using a network of FOS on or within the test specimen. An optical sensor that is often employed for damage detection in composites is the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor. A comprehensive overview of the theory of FBG sensors and their application to PMC materials was reported by Selezneva [124], thus only the relevant details will be presented here. The fundamental principle for a uniform optical FBG sensor located in a single mode coated glass optical fiber is illustrated schematically in Figure 20 (a). The gratings used in this

43

3 Literature Survey and Background study have a constant or uniform pitch () and length (L), and an index of refraction denoted by neff. When a broadband light source is transmitted through the core of the fiber towards the grating with a certain wavelength denoted by in, light of a certain wavelength is transmitted (tr), while light with a different wavelength is reflected (ref). The reflected light will have the spectrum shown in Figure 20 (b), with a central or Bragg wavelength denoted by B. The Bragg wavelength for the reflected spectrum is defined by: B = 2neff 

(8)

Any change in either neff or  will cause the Bragg wavelength to shift, which will facilitate in determining the strain and temperature environment to which the optical fiber is subjected to. The shift in the Bragg wavelength (B) due to both strain () and temperature (T) is obtained by [124]:

The terms P11 and P12 are Pockel's coefficients of the stressoptic tensor,  and  are the glass fiber Poisson's ratio and coefficient of thermal expansion respectively. For an isothermal environment (i.e., T = 0), the strain acting along the grating can be determined for a glass fiber using Equation (10) [124].

Uniform FBG sensors were successfully employed by Montesano et al. [72, 125] for both room temperature and elevated temperature cyclic loading of PMCs, and were shown to sustain the high cyclic loading and the elevated temperature environment without degradation. In terms of their damage monitoring capabilities, FBG sensors offer the option of not only monitoring the local strain variation, but also to monitor the variation of the reflected light spectrum. When an FBG sensor is subjected to a nonuniform strain field, its wavelength spectrum becomes distorted. Since local cracking in the vicinity of an FBG sensor can cause

44

3 Literature Survey and Background localized nonuniform strain fields, FBG sensors can in fact be used to detect damage [120]. An example of a distorted wavelength spectrum is shown in Figure 20 (c), which is referred to as chirping. Additional details of damage detection capabilities of FBG sensors, with a review of additional studies employing FBG sensors for damage detection in PMC materials can be found in [124].

Posttest destructive inspection of specimens is done for verification of the damage modes observed using a NDE technique, and for further characterization of the specimen material damage. This allows for a detailed look at the extent of damage and the type of damage in the specimen, but obviously does not provide insight on the progression of damage. A destructive technique such as sectioning of the specimen or deplying of the specimen is typically employed prior to inspection allowing for explicit visual access of the damage zones or the failure surfaces within the specimens. Use of SEM or an optical microscope is commonly employed for PMC materials. Posttest inspection often allows for detection of smallerscale damage such as fiber fracture and fibermatrix debonding, which are not detectable by most of the NDE methods presented.

45

3 Literature Survey and Background Although all NDE methods presented have their advantages, the drawbacks for each method were also discussed. This is summarized in Table 4, which indicates the applicability of each method for the listed categories. As is evident in the table, in order to fully characterize the damage development for a material subjected to cyclic loading, a combination of techniques is required. In an ideal case, the combination of 'local' and 'global' NDE techniques will be sufficient. The local technique will assist with identifying particular damage modes and counting cracks to quantify the crack density development, while a global technique can yield an overall map of damage throughout the component continuously. If these techniques are coupled with post mortem SEM observations to verify damage modes, a complete picture of the damage development progression during a fatigue test will be attained. For this study, the local NDE techniques employed include ER and the application of surfacemounted FBG sensors. The global NDE technique used is IRT, and for post mortem damage verification SEM was used. This is a unique combination of techniques for fatigue damage monitoring of PMC materials. Once the damage development is understood and quantified with the use of the aforementioned techniques, the empirical data can be used to either define or validate a damage prediction model. The following section provides a detailed literature survey of existing fatigue damage prediction models for PMC materials.

3.7 Literature Survey on Fatigue Models
As was shown in Sections 3.2 and 3.5, the fatigue behaviour of fiberreinforced PMC materials is a complex phenomenon. The added complexities due to an elevated temperature environment were discussed in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. As a result, there has been great effort by researchers in the past few decades to develop methods for modeling the development of fatigue damage, predicting failure, and predicting the fatigue life of PMC materials. In the aerospace industry, however, issues concerning the durability and fatigue behaviour of composites still remain. This is mainly due to the lack in understanding of the importance of different damage mechanisms involved, and the lack of widely accepted generic models. As a result, many of these research efforts are being continued to date. A classification of existing fatigue models can be made based on the classification of fatigue criteria made by Sendeckyj [126]. According to Sendeckyj, fatigue criteria can be classified into four main categories: macroscopic strength fatigue criteria, criteria based on residual strength, criteria based on residual stiffness and criteria based on actual damage mechanisms. Existing fatigue models for fiber reinforced PMCs can therefore be classified into three main general categories, which include: (a) macroscopic strength models based on experimental SN curves and not actual damage mechanisms or damage accumulation, (b) residual strength/stiffness models based on damage accumulation, and (c) progressive damage models which are based on specific measurable or observed damage mechanisms. These fatigue models can be either empirical, semiempirical, phenomenological, statistical, mechanistic or deterministic in nature regardless of their classification. The following paragraphs provide a review of existing fatigue models which is separated into the three aforementioned categories. Although the following review is not completely exhaustive, fatigue models that are deemed noteworthy are presented. A complimentary review conducted by Degrieck and VanPaepegem can be found in [127]. Note that the notation of the original study was maintained for the presented equations in this section, thus the parameters in these equations are not included in the nomenclature or in any other section of this report.

3 Literature Survey and Background
3.7.1 Macroscopic Strength Models

Macroscopic strength models do not account for damage accumulation and do not consider specific damage mechanisms in their formulation (e.g., matrix cracking and fiber fracture). Rather, these models quantify failure based on specific macroscopic failure criteria, or determine the composite fatigue life based solely on a fixed loading condition. In either case, these models use corresponding experimental testing data in the form of SN curves. Hashin and Rotem [22] developed one of the first macroscopic fatigue failure criterion for fiber reinforced composites. The fiber and matrix constituents each have a separate failure mode, with each failure criteria based on a fixed stress state in the material. They postulate that failure of one constituent implies failure of the composite material. The failure criteria are defined as follows:
 A = u A § T · §  · ¨ u ¸ +¨ u ¸ =1 © T ¹ ©  ¹
2 2

(11)

The terms with superscripts are ultimate allowable stresses, and are determined from experimental testing of offaxis unidirectional specimens. These terms are based on maximum or minimum cyclic stress levels, the number of loading cycles, and number of cycles to failure (Nf). The model is however only valid for laminates with unidirectional plies. Reifsnider and Gao [35] proposed a similar model based on the average stress formulation of unidirectional composites (derived from the MoriTanaka method), which accounted specifically for the constituent material properties and the bonding nature between the fibers and matrix. The failure criteria are given by:
 f = u f § m · §  m · ¨ u ¸ +¨ u ¸ =1 © m ¹ ©  m ¹
2 2

(12)

48

3 Literature Survey and Background The terms in the brackets denote average stress values, while the ultimate allowable

stresses depend on the stress ratio, R, and number of cycles which must be determined experimentally. The model is valid for unidirectionalply laminates of various ply orientations. Ellyin and ElKadi [36] developed a fatigue criterion for unidirectional laminates which relates the total mechanical energy input and the 'damage' due to cyclic loading. The prediction of fatigue life is based on an assumed fixed stress state and corresponding material constants ( and ) which are found experimentally. The fatigue life is found using the expression in Equation (13), where the term on the leftside is the total energy input due to mechanical loading (i.e., the stress state).
W = N f

(13)

Fawaz and Ellyin [128] proposed a semilog linear relationship between the applied cyclic stress (S) and the number of cycles (logN) for unidirectional laminates:
S = mlogN + b Sr = mrlogN + br

(14)

The subscript r denotes a chosen reference line, where the relation between the parameters m, b, and mr, br are based on ply orientation, stress ratio R and the state of stress. The objective is to determine m and b for a given cyclic loading state and material, where the SN curve can then be determined using Equation (14). Jen and Lee [129] proposed a modified version of the well known TsaiHill failure criterion for plane stress multiaxial fatigue loading of unidirectional fiber reinforced laminates. The failure criterion is expressed as:
§ · §  xx · §  xx · 2 §  xx · M ¨ xx ¸ + M2 ¸  M11M22 ¨ ¸ + M12 ¨ ¸ =1 22 ¨ © 11 ¹ © 22 ¹ © 11 ¹ © 12 ¹
2 11 2 2 2 2

(15)

49

3 Literature Survey and Background The coefficients Mij are based on the stress state and the fiber orientation, while the experimentally determined fatigue strengths, ij , are based on the number of load cycles and the stress ratio, R. Philippidis and Vassilopoulos [130] also proposed a multiaxial fatigue failure criterion for unidirectional and woven laminates, which is similar to the quadratic TsaiWu failure criterion for static loading. The failure expression is given by:

Fiji j + F i i 1 d 0

(16)

The components of the failure tensors Fij and Fi are functions of the failure stresses (i.e., functions of the number of cycles, the stress ratio, R, and the loading frequency). Thus, the failure stresses are found based on the SN curves of the corresponding material and loading condition. The criterion is general enough to consider a laminate with an arbitrary stacking sequence, however experimental testing is required for all stacking sequences. Bond [42] developed a semiempirical model to predict fatigue life of unidirectional and woven fiber reinforced laminates subject to variable amplitude loading. The fatigue life can be calculated based on the applied cyclic stress, and the model has the form:

max = blogN+ c

(17)

This relation represents the SN curve for the composite, where b and c are functions of the stress ratio, R. Bond found that there was a satisfactory correlation between the predicted and experimental data. Recently, Sarfaraz et al. [131] developed a semiempirical hybrid SN curve formulation for constant amplitude fatigue of composite materials. It is stated that the common semi logarithmic and power law fatigue SN models have drawbacks, whereas the presented model combines both inefficient models to improve modeling accuracy in both LCF and HCF regimes. The model which is a hybrid semilogarithmic and power law fitting function is defined by:

ª º 1  = CNf D + « » ªA +Blog(Nf )  CNf D º 2 ¬ ¼ « ¬ 1 + Nf / Ntrans  » ¼
50

(18)

3 Literature Survey and Background The parameters A, B, C and D are regression parameters for the individual semilogarithmic and power law fitting functions, while Ntrans is the transition number of cycles which is defined as the shortest lifetime among the examined sample of fatigue data.
3.7.2 Residual Strength/Stiffness Models

Residual strength or stiffness models are based on the concept of cumulative damage or damage accumulation. These models do not account for specific damage mechanisms in their formulations, but rather define an analytical damage parameter based on the deterioration of observable macroscopic material properties (i.e., strength or stiffness). The early concept of damage accumulation was introduced by Miner [132] for metallic alloys, where the damage accumulation parameter, D, was defined as a function of the life fraction for multistage fatigue loading. The formulation, often referred to as Miner's rule, is given as:

D=¦
i

ni Ni

(19)

A number of similar cumulative damage models were subsequently developed for metals and composites by Marco and Starkey [133], Henry [134], Howe and Owen [135] and Hashin and Rotem [136]. The developed residual strength and residual stiffness models are based on the same concepts.
3.7.2.1 Residual stiffness models Residual stiffness cumulative damage models use the degradation of the material

stiffness to determine the cumulative damage and/or the fatigue life of a composite. Since stiffness is used as the damage metric, this allows for nondestructive testing of specimens [20, 25]. One of the early residual stiffness models for unidirectional composites was proposed by Hwang and Han [30, 31]. A fatigue modulus concept was introduced, where the fatigue modulus is determined based on a power function of the number of loading cycles (n) and the applied stress (r). The degradation rate of the fatigue modulus (F) and the cumulative damage (D) are determined from the following expressions:

51

3 Literature Survey and Background

dF / dn = Acnc1 D= r ª Fo º 1» « 1 r ¬ F(n) ¼
(20)

The parameters A and c are material functions, Fo is the initial fatigue modulus, and failure occurs when the damage parameter is unity. Whitworth [32, 33] proposed a residual stiffness model for unidirectionalply laminates in which the degradation of the material stiffness is based on the number of cycles (n), the applied stress level (B) and material parameters a and H. The expressions for the evolving stiffness and the corresponding damage parameter are defined in Equation (21), where D=1 denotes failure.

E(n)a = E(0)a  H[E(0)  B]a ª H(1  S)a º n D= « a » ¬ 1S ¼ N

(21)

Yang et al. [34] proposed a residual stiffness model for unidirectional laminates. The model assumes that the residual stiffness degradation rate is a power function of the number of loading cycles (n):

dE(n) = E(0)Qvnv1 dn

(22)

The variables Q and v depend on the applied stress, load frequency, stress ratio and ambient temperature. Yang et al. [137] later employed this model with the concept of the fatigue modulus to develop a similar model for prediction of fatigue modulus degradation. These models were used within a statisticallybased model for predicting specimen stiffness loss undergoing both lowcycle and highcycle fatigue loading. Hansen [117] proposed a fatigue model for impactdamaged woven fiberreinforced composite laminates. A damage parameter () is introduced and based on the number of cycles (N), the effective strain (e) and constants (A and n):

52

3 Literature Survey and Background

§ ·  = A ³ ¨ e ¸ dN  0© o ¹
N

n

(23)

The effective strain is based on the cyclic loading stress level. The damage parameter is used to scale down the material modulus using the expression E = Eo(1  ). This fatigue model was implemented into a finite element (FE) analysis model to predict the stiffness reduction of the corresponding test specimen. VanPaepegem and Degrieck [138] employed a stiffness degradation model for woven composites, while also implementing the model into a FE algorithm. The rate of the damage parameter (D) is defined as:

 A()c dD ° = ® (1 D)b dN ° ¯ 0

tension compression

(24)

The parameters A, b and c are material constants, and  is the cyclic stress amplitude. The material modulus is reduced by the commonly adopted expression E = Eo(1  D). Tate and Kelkar [13] developed a residual stiffness model to predict the fatigue life and residual stiffness of a biaxial braided composite subjected to tensiontension fatigue. The expression relating the fatigue modulus (E(n)) to the number of cycles (n) is:
 ª § § n · ·º ° ½ ° E(n) = E(N) ®a «ln ¨ ln ¨ ¸ ¸ » ¾ + c ° ¬ © © N ¹ ¹¼ ¿ ° ¯

(25)

The fatigue life is denoted by N, while E(N) is the fatigue modulus at failure, which are both determined from experimental testing data (i.e., SN curves). The empirical parameters a and c are assumed to be independent of stress ratio and loading frequency. Over the past decade, a number of additional nonlinear cumulative damage models have been developed to predict fatigue damage accumulation of PMC laminates [61, 139141]. The definition of the cumulative damage parameter fitting function in each study is found through the correlation of the evolving parameter (D) with an experimentally obtained damage index

53

3 Literature Survey and Background (Dexp), which was defined by measured stiffness values. As a result, these models are deemed stiffness degradation models. One noteworthy example is the model developed by Mao and Mahadevan [139]. An experimentally obtained damage index based on the initial stiffness (Eo) and the stiffness at failure (Ef) was used, which is defined in Equation (26). The cumulative damage model also defined in Equation (26) was equated to the experimental damage index, and the material parameters q, m1 and m2 were found for a particular maximum applied stress level.

3.7.2.2 Residual strength models Residual strength models use the degradation of the initial material strength to

determine failure or the fatigue life of a composite. These models have a natural failure criterion, in which failure occurs when the residual stress reduces to the level of the applied cyclic stress. Unlike the residual stiffness models, tracking the residual strength of a composite must be done via destructive testing. For this reason, many of these models are incorporated within statistical models to predict the probability of fatigue failure or strength degradation. Residual strength models are either based on the sudden death approach or the wearout approach, used for LCF and HCF respectively. One of the earliest residual strength models was developed by Broutman and Sahu [23] for unidirectional composites. They found that the residual strength is a linear function of the number of cycles spent at a particular stress level. The expression used to correlate residual strength and the cumulative fatigue damage for twostage loading is given by Equation (27), where failure occurs when the damage parameter is unity.

(27)

54

3 Literature Survey and Background Hahn and Kim [24] also developed a linear model relating residual strength and the number of load cycles. The model predicts failure when the residual strength reduces to the level of the maximum applied load (i.e., D=1). The expression describing the rate of change of residual strength (F) is defined in Equation (28). The parameter A is based on the applied stress, while m is a material constant. This expression is used in a cumulative damage model which incorporates the life (L) and the applied rupture stress (a).

dF = AFm dt Fsm+1  m+1   a D= m + 1 L( a )

(28)

Yang and Jones [142] proposed a nonlinear residual strength model for twostage loading in unidirectional laminates. The expression for residual strength (R) is:
ª§ n ·  § n ·  º R(0)v   v R(nB )v = R(nA )v  «¨ B ¸  ¨ A ¸ » c c  º « R(0)   ¬© N ¹ © N ¹ » ¼ª ¬ ¼

(29)

The parameters v, c and  are material constants and based on the applied stress (). Caprino and D'Amore [143] proposed a fatigue model for random fiberreinforced thermoplastic composites. A power law is proposed for continuous decay of the residual strength (n) during cyclic loading, and is defined in Equation (30). The stress amplitude is  = max  min, and the constants ao and b are based on the loading conditions and the material. With the initial static strength (o) and stress ratio (R), the model for strength degradation is also defined in Equation (30). Fatigue failure occurs when n = max, which allows for estimation of the fatigue life. This model was implemented into a statistical model for strength degradation prediction.

dn = a0 nb dn a  o  n = o max (1  R)(n1b  1) 1b

(30)

55

3 Literature Survey and Background Whitworth [44] developed a residual strength model for unidirectional laminates based on a previously developed residual stiffness model [43]. The residual strength (SR) is related to the fatigue life (n) by the expression in Equation (31).The maximum cyclic stress is S, the ultimate tensile stress is denoted by SU, and , h, m, c1 and c2 are constants. Equation (31) is used to determine the residual strength during fatigue loading, and can be used to determine the fatigue life (i.e., if SR = S). This model was then implemented into a statistical residual strength model. ª º « »   « » SU  S   SR = SU « »n m/c2  º½ « ° 1 ª§ c1 SU · ° »  1» ¾  1 » « exp ® «¨ ¸ h S © ¹ « » ° « ¬ ¼° ¯ ¿ » ¬ ¼

Post et al. [54] developed a residual strength model for fiberdominated wovenply laminates which is applicable for composites subjected to variable amplitude fatigue loading. The postulate of the model is that the residual strength in the critical plies of the laminate dictates failure of the material. The normalized remaining strength (Fr) in the critical plies is given by:

ª n 1 ½ º 1/ j Fr(n) = 1  « ³ ®1 Fa(n)  ¾ dn» 0 N(Fa) ¯ ¿ ¼ ¬

j

(32)

The term Fa is the normalized maximum applied stress on the critical plies, N(Fa) is the fatigue life, and j is a fitting parameter. Failure occurs when Fa > Fr. The normalized maximum applied stress is determined using an empiricallydetermined stiffness, E(n), while the fatigue life is found using an experimental SN curve. This model is incorporated into a statisticallybased simulation model to predict residual strength degradation.
3.7.3 Progressive Damage Models

Progressive damage models introduce specific damage mechanisms (e.g., matrix cracking, fibermatrix debonding, delamination, fiber fracture, yarn cracking) in order to simulate the

56

3 Literature Survey and Background development of damage in order to describe the deterioration of the composite component. These models are based on a physical interpretation of the actual underlying damage mechanisms, which cause macroscopically observable degradation of the material properties. The damage criterion is often based on micromechanical formulations, and are often used in the context of the FEM. These models can be classified into two subcategories: (i) models that predict damage growth, and (ii) models that correlate damage growth with material property degradation.
3.7.3.1 Models that predict damage growth Models that predict actual damage growth consider one (or more) specific damage

mechanism, and determine the physical change in that damage mechanism with increasing loading cycles. These models are typically of the form of the wellknown fracture mechanics based Paris Law for crack propagation in homogeneous materials (i.e., da/dn). Notched laminates are typically employed to initiate the specific damage type required, allowing for clear observation of the damage growth area for comparison with predicted results. More recently, explicit micromechanical models have also been developed to explicitly predict damage development using the FEM. Bergmann and Prinz [144] developed a model for predicting the growth of delamination area in unidirectional laminates. The equation representing the growth of the interply delamination area (Ai) subjected to N loading cycles is:

dAi = c  f(Git )n dN

(33)

The energy release rate due to delamination growth is denoted by Git, where c and n are empirical factors determined from corresponding tests. Feng et al. [145] developed a model for predicting matrix crack growth in unidirectional laminates, using maximum strainenergy release rate (Gmax) along with empirical material constants in the model formulation. The modified Paris law has the form:

dA = DGn max dN
57

(34)

3 Literature Survey and Background The damage area (A) is caused by matrix cracking, while N is the number of loading cycles. A FE model was used to determine Gmax, and the fatigue life (Nf) was approximated based on a critical damage area at failure (Af). A similar model was proposed by HernaffGardin et al. [39], where the progression of damage due to matrix cracking in crossply laminates was predicted. The propagation expression for crack surface area (S) during fatigue cycling (N) is denoted by Equation (35). The strain energy release rate due to cracking is denoted by G, while A and n are empirical constants.

(35)

Shivakumar et al. [55] proposed a delamination growth model to predict the fatigue life for fiberreinforced wovenply laminates. Their expression for determining the delamination area growth rate (da/dn) is also analogous to a fracture mechanics approach, and is given by:

§G da = A ¨ Imax dn © GIR

· ¸ ¸ ¹ D2 · · ¸ ¸ ¹ ¸ ¹ · ¸ ¹

(36)

The empirical parameters A, m, D1 and D2 are determined from various fracture tests and tensiontension fatigue tests. The maximum energy release rate is expressed as GImax, while GIR is the interlaminar fracture resistance which causes the growth rate of the delamination area to decrease; this is caused by for example matrix cracking and fiber bridging for unidirectional composites. The threshold energy release rate GIth is a minimum value below which da/dn is nearly zero. Note that GImax, GIth, and GIR are all determined from experimental test data and empiricallybased equations. In addition, many micromechanical models (i.e., explicit model of fibers and matrix) have been developed within the framework of FE simulation models to explicitly simulate the

58

3 Literature Survey and Background progression of specific damage mechanisms in PMC materials [146149]. These models employ the concept of a repeated unit cell (RUC), in which a small representative volume of the bulk material is included in the threedimensional simulation model. These models tend to drastically oversimplify the geometry of the RUC and the locations of the damage initiation zones. In addition, most of these models only consider static loading; however, a recent study by Shi and Zhang [150] successfully simulated the development of a single matrix crack near and a single interface crack at the location of a reinforcing fiber.
3.7.3.2 Models that correlate damage growth with residual mechanical properties Models that correlate damage growth with material property degradation often employ

numerical simulation models (e.g., FE analysis) to simulate damage progression, predict material property degradation and to predict the fatigue life of a component. The composite material is typically treated as a homogenous material for the analysis, where the degraded material properties are introduced into the constitutive equations via any number of numerical or phenomenological methods. Some studies considered analytical micromechanical representations of the stress fields in the vicinity of cracks, and incorporated the modified stresses into the constitutive equations to reduce the mechanical material properties. Other studies incorporate the effects of certain damage mechanisms directly into the formulation of the global constitutive equations. One of the first fatigue models that correlated matrix cracking with stiffness loss in fiber reinforced laminates was the onedimensional shearlag model developed by Highsmith and Reifsnider [26]. The saturation of transverse matrix cracking in the offaxis plies yielded near uniform crack spacing after a certain number of loading cycles, and was experimentally observed and correlated to the specimen stiffness reduction. These observations were then implemented into the analytical constitutive equations to model material stiffness loss via the stiffness tensor. This model effectively considers the local state of stress caused by damage and uses this to predict the global behaviour of the composite. A number of similar local stress state based models were developed in many additional studies, which are known as variational approaches [29, 40, 151, 152]. Variational methods consider certain damage mechanisms, often only matrix cracking, and their effects on the local stress fields. The local stress fields are then

59

3 Literature Survey and Background used to reduce the material properties such as stiffness. The influence of local cracking is introduced indirectly into the governing equations by stress perturbation functions. Wang et al. [153] developed a fatigue damage model for a shortfiber PMC. Randomly oriented matrix cracking was considered as the primary damage mechanism. An analytical damage model was developed, based on statistical probability crack density functions for damage progression. A crack density function that was based on the crack lengths, orientations and densities was incorporated into the composite constitutive equations in the form of an effective damageinduced compliance tensor in order to degrade the stiffness of the material during numerical simulations of cyclic loading conditions. The influence of the local damage state was introduced directly into the global constitutive equations to model stiffness degradation, which is notably different than the presented models that consider the local stress state. A similar study by ElMahi et al. [38] proposed a similar model in which matrix cracking in PMC laminates was correlated to the stiffness through a crack density function, which was employed to directly reduce the material axial stiffness component and used in a FE analysis. An earlier study by Poursartip et al. [154] defined a damage parameter (D) which was based on the delamination area observed in PMC laminates. The parameter was then correlated to the stiffness of the laminate using a semiempirical expression. BartleyCho et al. [155] investigated ply cracking in quasiisotropic laminates under constant amplitude fatigue and block loading, and subsequently developed a model to predict the development of ply cracking. The ply level stresses were determined from the applied laminate stress, and a plylevel empirical failure function was assumed which was a function of the number of loading cycles. The crack density development (crack) in plies with different orientations was derived from an empirical fitting function, which is defined in Equation (37). The parameters b and f are material parameters which are found from fitting of the experimental data. The corresponding reduced plylevel stiffness parameters (Cij) are then found from the crack densities, as is shown in Equation (37). The updated plylevel stresses, which are based on the current crack densities, were then used to evaluate the failure function.

A similar study by Gagel et al. [59] investigated ply cracking in noncrimp laminates subjected to tensiontension fatigue loading, and developed a similar model to predict the degradation of axial stiffness based on observed crack densities. The crack densities in the different plies were defined from empirical data as functions of the number of loading cycles. The definition of the crack density () for an arbitrary ply is presented in Equation (38), where the parameters mp and np are linear functions of the maximum applied stress. The crack densities were then used to define a cumulative damage parameter, and the axial stiffness was consequently determined from that damage parameter. An analytical expression for the normalized axial stiffness reported in the study is shown in Equation (38), which is a function of the crack density for a 45 ply.

Many similar studies focussed on directly introducing the effects of local damage mechanisms into the global constitutive equations to degrade the mechanical properties. One model that was developed by Reifsnider [156, 157] correlated stiffness degradation and strength degradation to particular damage mechanisms in unidirectionalply laminates. The so called critical element method effectively divides the material into critical and subcritical elements. The critical elements are for example 0 plies at the ply level or the fibers at the micromechanical level, and the subcritical elements can be the offaxis or transverse plies at the ply level and the matrix at the micromechanical level. The model assumes that the mechanical properties of the subcritical elements degrade due to the evolution of damage, which is represented through analytical expressions and/or empirical parameters within the

61

3 Literature Survey and Background constitutive equations. This consequently reduces the strength of the critical elements. The critical elements will fail if local strength criteria are met, while failure of the critical elements is assumed to cause complete failure of the laminate. Sendeckyj [126] reported that the critical element method is inconsistent with the experimental observations of many PMC laminates. Other methods that include the effects of damage directly into the global constitutive equations are based on selfconsistent schemes, such as the model proposed by Laws et al. [158]. A scalar damage parameter based on matrix crack density was formulated and implemented into the homogenized composite material linear elastic constitutive equations to reduce the material stiffness. The scalar crack density damage parameter () that was used in the study is defined in Equation (39). The parameter defines the average number of cracks with length 2a in a square section with side length of 2a. The parameter has a value between 0 and 1 as was observed experimentally. The cracked stiffness tensor (L) is also defined in Equation (39), and is a function of the uncracked material stiffness tensor (L2) and the damage parameter ().

(39)

Additional models that incorporate the effects of damage directly into the global constitutive equations are based on the pioneering work of Kachanov [159], which is referred to as damage mechanics or continuum damage mechanics (CDM). Models based on CDM consider the effects of particular damage mechanisms, which are represented by scalars, vectors or tensors within the constitutive equations. Damage is homogenized within the bulk material and is considered as a set of internal variables. This concept is contrary to fracture mechanics which treats damage as a set of internal surfaces within the material; however, damage mechanics is more suitable for composite materials based on the discussion presented in Section 3.5. The formulation of the 'damaged' constitutive equations is based on the concepts of irreversible thermodynamics in that damage events are irreversible microscopic processes within the bulk material. The damage parameters are typically incorporated within the material stiffness tensor, and thus the degradation of the mechanical properties are directly modeled. The 62

3 Literature Survey and Background damage parameters are typically determined from experimental data, but can also be defined by analytical expressions or from micromechanical analysis. Some of the notable studies that developed fatigue prediction models based on CDM are those by Talreja [160162], Allen et al. [163, 164], Coats and Harris [165, 105], and Ladeveze et al. [166169]. Another fatigue prediction model for notched PMC laminates was the socalled generalized residual material property degradation model developed by Shokrieh and Lessard [170173]. The model did not consider specific damage modes, but did employ specific 'failure modes' within the fatigue simulation. Hashintype polynomial fatigue failure criteria were employed in the model to check for sudden material property degradation, and are based on specific failure modes within the plies and the number of loading cycles. The failure modes considered were fiber tension, fiber compression, fibermatrix shearing, matrix tension, matrix compression, normal tension and normal compression. The gradual degradation of the residual strengths and stiffness properties during cycling (prior to sudden failure) was approximated using corresponding semiempirical expressions. These expressions are functions of the number of loading cycles, empirical fitting parameters, the loading conditions and the number of cycles to failure which is determined from SN data. The generalized residual material property degradation model was implemented within the context of a threedimensional FE model which assumes an orthotropic material. An algorithm was developed to simulate cyclebycycle fatigue damage development.
3.7.4 General Discussion

A number of fatigue prediction models have been presented in the preceding sections, the summary of which is included in Table 5. It can be argued as to which model, or which category of models, are the most applicable for a certain type of composite. The development of the varying types of fatigue prediction models does however illustrate an important point: one common fatigue modeling approach has not yet been established or accepted. While each category of models have their own advantages and disadvantages, it is in the opinion of the author that a fatigue prediction model should incorporate the underlying damage mechanisms within its definition. Accounting for specific damage mechanisms in a prediction model allows for a quantitative representation of the progressive damage in a composite structure, which is

63

3 Literature Survey and Background important not only for fatigue prediction but for damage tolerance analysis in aerospace structures. Specifically, the models based on damage mechanics are attractive because they are more applicable to composites compared to models that are based on the principles of fracture mechanics (see Section 3.5). Cumulative damage models may be effective if they can be based, to some degree, on the observed damage mechanisms for a particular material.

3 Literature Survey and Background It can be gleaned from the review that few models have been developed or have been employed for prediction of elevated temperature fatigue of PMC materials. One of the notable models is the macroscopic strength model developed by Miyano et al. [92] that considers the influence of creep on fatigue. Another is described in the work by Case et al. [84], which employed the aforementioned critical element method to predict fatigue damage development for a PMC laminate at elevated temperatures. The final notable model was that employed by Kawai and Taniguchi [15] to predict the cumulative damage in onaxis and offaxis laminates at both room temperatures and elevated temperatures. In addition, few of these models have been developed for braided composites. Since the evolution of damage in braided composites is very complex and not fully understood, the corresponding prediction of the effective material properties for braided materials containing damage is not well established, especially at elevated temperatures. The complex geometry of braided fabric reinforcements and the number of geometric variables makes the use of certain presented models even more difficult.

The first section presents a description of the composite materials under investigation, with specific overview of the microstructural arrangement of the constituents. The second section describes the preparation of the braided composite material test specimens, while the third section presents an overview of the experimental protocol. The fourth section includes a discussion on the damage monitoring methods used in this study, while the fifth section describes the test procedures employed. The final section presents the relevant data analysis used in this study.

4.1 Material Details
The main focus of this research is to investigate a specific braided composite material, thus the details of this section will have that focus. An alternate objective of this study is to analyze two additional wovenply laminates, which will also be described in brief in Section 4.1.2.
4.1.1 Triaxial Braided Composite

The composite material under investigation is a triaxial braided fabric reinforced thermosetting polymer resin, which was shown schematically in Figure 3 (b). The braided fabric is manufactured using fiber yarns that each consist of 6,000 carbon fibers (6K). The T650/35 carbon fibers used to manufacture the braided fabric are commercially available from Cytec

66

4 Material and Experimental Details Industries. The braided fiber yarns are oriented in the 0/+60/60 directions, as shown by the image of the dry braided fabric in Figure 21. The braid pattern is a regular 2x2 braid, which consists of each +60 braided yarn alternating over two 60 braider yarns and under two 60 braider yarns (and vice versa) as shown. The 0 or warp yarns are aligned in the regions between the interlacing braider yarn crossover locations and are ideally noncrimped. The percentage of fiber yarns in the warp direction is 20%, while the percentage in each of the 60 and +60 directions is 40%. Note that the name and specific details of the thermosetting polymer resin are proprietary and cannot be disclosed as requested by the industry partner Pratt and Whitney Canada. The mechanical properties of the constituent materials are summarized in Table 6.

The flat composite panels were manufactured by EDO Fiber Innovations Inc. by stacking dry layers of the braided fabric in a mould after stitching the periphery of the stacked braided layers. A RTM technique was used to inject the resin into the mould. Note that the 67

4 Material and Experimental Details manufacturing parameters are also proprietary and cannot be disclosed as requested by the industry partner. The composite panels had final dimensions of approximately 360 mm in the warp direction and 350 mm in the transverse direction. All panels were subsequently inspected for manufacturing defects by Hansen Aerospace Laboratory Inc. using a thrutransmission immersion ultrasonic cscan method. For all the manufactured panels, no visible defects were reported. In addition, untested or virgin samples of the material were also inspected by SEM to confirm that there were no manufacturing defects. SEM images of the virgin samples illustrating details of the composite microstructure are shown in Figure 22. As is seen in the photomicrographs, there are no voids in the resin and the fibers are entirely consolidated. Note that the localized dark regions in the photomicrographs are the sectioned ends of the carbon fibers and not resin voids. In total five panels were manufactured, where the fiber volume fraction (Vf) and thickness for each panel are listed in Table 7 (as provided by the manufacturer). It should be noted that the slight variation in the panel thickness, and thus Vf, was due to the variation in the RTM manufacturing process. Although the braided fabric was consistent for each manufactured panel, the amount of resin squeezed out of the mould during curing differed slightly for each panel which caused the variation in the cure thickness. This is demonstrated schematically in Figure 23, albeit exaggerated. This has been commonly observed for many panels manufactured using RTM, and may result in slight scatter in the mechanical testing data [66].

4.1.2 WovenPly Laminates

Two types of woven composites were investigated in this study. The first is an eight harness satin (8HS) woven fabric reinforced BMI laminate. A schematic of the 8HS weave pattern is shown in Figure 24 (a), with the warp yarns in darker contrast and the weft yarns in lighter contrast. The fiber yarns each consisted of 3,000 (3K) T650/35 carbon fibers, with an equivalent number of ends and fills in the warp and weft directions, respectively. The flat composite panels consisted of 7 layers of the 8HS woven fabric, all oriented along the warp direction. The panels were manufactured using a RTM technique. The second composite is a fourharness satin (4HS) woven fabric reinforced polyimide laminate. A schematic of the 4HS weave pattern is shown in Figure 24 (b), with the warp yarns in darker contrast and the weft yarns in lighter contrast. The fiber yarns each consisted of 6,000 (6K) IM7 carbon fibers, with an equivalent number of ends and fills in the warp and weft directions, respectively. The polyimide resin used was RP46. The flat composite panels consisted of 10 layers of the 4HS woven fabric, all oriented along the warp direction. The panels were manufactured using a compression 69

4 Material and Experimental Details moulding technique, as described in [174]. The fiber volume fraction for the satin woven laminates investigated in this study were approximately 5456%.

4.2 Specimen Preparation
The manufactured triaxial braided composite panels were manufactured into 12 specimens each (i.e., total of 60 specimens) by cutting the panels along their warp direction using an abrasive waterjet cutting technique. A schematic of the cutting pattern for a braided panel along with the panel and specimen dimensions is shown in Figure 25 (a), where each specimen has nominal dimensions of 355 x 25 mm as shown. The specimens were each numbered according to the panel they were cut from and their sequence along the panel; e.g., specimen B111 was cut from panel 1, and was from the location on the panel shown in Figure 25 (a). The edges of all the cut braided specimens were subsequently wet sanded with 180grit and then 320grit paper for improved edge quality. The specimen width of 25 mm ensured that the ratio of specimen width to the braided fabric unit cell width was at least 2:1 (see Figure 21), as is recommended in ASTM standard D6856 [175]. All braided test specimens were subsequently equipped with tapered aluminum end tabs to eliminate potential issues with gripping induced failure. The end tabs were manufactured from 3 mm (1/8") thick by 25 mm (1.0") wide 6061T6 aluminum alloy bar. The static test specimens were equipped with 76 mm long tabs with a 10° taper, while the fatigue test specimens were equipped with 57 mm long tabs also with a 10° taper. All manufactured end tabs were lightly filed after machining to remove any burs, and the end tab mating surfaces

4 Material and Experimental Details (i.e., to the specimen) were sanded with 320grit paper. The geometry of the end tabs for the fatigue test specimens is shown in Figure 25 (b). The end tab and specimen geometry are in accordance with ASTM Standard D3039 [176]. For the room temperature tests, the end tabs were bonded to the composite specimens using a room temperature curable adhesive, Loctite 496. For the elevated temperature tests, the end tabs were not bonded to the specimens due to exposure to the elevated temperature environment. Friction due to gripping forces were sufficient to ensure that there was no relative slippage between the end tabs and the elevated temperature test specimens.

The 8HS woven BMI test specimens were also cut from flat panels, along the warp direction, using an abrasive waterjet cutting technique. The resulting test specimen nominal dimensions were 300 mm by 25 mm. Analogous to the braided specimens, the 8HS woven BMI specimen edges were sanded subsequent to cutting and similar aluminum end tabs were also employed. The 4HS woven RP46 test specimens were cut from flat panels, along the warp direction, using a wet diamond blade. The resulting specimen nominal dimensions were 280 71

4.3 Experimental Setup
All mechanical tests were conducted in the Facility for Research on Aerospace Materials and Engineered Structures (FRAMES) at Ryerson University using an MTS 322 test frame. A calibrated MTS 244.31 hydraulic linear actuator provided the uniaxial stroke, a calibrated MTS 661.22C01 force transducer with a 250 kN capacity provided the force feedback, and a calibrated MTS linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT) provided the displacement feedback. An MTS TestStar IIm digital controller/data acquisition unit connected to a Windows operated PC was used for controlling the tests and acquiring all relevant data. Additional equipment and sensors employed for mechanical testing were dependent on whether the tests were conducted at room temperature or an elevated temperature environment. Section 4.3.1 discusses further details for the room temperature test apparatus, while Section 4.3.2 presents a description of the elevated temperature test apparatus. Although the discussion in the subsequent sections refers to the braided composite specimens, the experimental setup was the same for the 8HS woven BMI and 4HS woven RP46 laminate specimens.
4.3.1 Room Temperature Setup

For the room temperature tests, the MTS 322 test frame was equipped with MTS 647.25A01 hydraulically operated wedge grips (force capacity: 250 kN dynamic, 333 kN static). A photograph of the typical room temperature experimental setup is shown in Figure 26. Alignment of the test frame grips was verified by using a steel sample that consisted of three bonded strain gages. Minimal outofplane and inplain bending was observed (<2%), which was in accordance with ASTM standard D3039 [176]. For the room temperature tests, a number of techniques were used to measure strain during both static and fatigue tests. For all the static tests, axial and transverse surface bonded resistance strain gages, a clipon extensometer and FBG optical sensors were used to monitor strain. Although this was redundant, the objective was to calibrate the three types of strain sensors with one another, as was similarly done by

72

4 Material and Experimental Details Montesano et al. [125]. For the fatigue specimens, a clipon extensometer was used for all tests, and FBG optical sensors were used for a number of these tests. Vishay EA06250AE350 strain gages were used to measure axial strain and longer CEA06500UW350 strain gages were used to measure the transverse strain, both of which were bonded to the specimen surface with MBond 200 adhesive. As specified in ASTM Standard D6856 [175], the strain gages were chosen to have a gage length greater than the length of one unit cell of the braided geometry. A photograph of one of the static test specimens showing the bonded strain gages is shown in Figure 27 (a). Polyimide coated FBG sensors with grating lengths between 5 mm and 10 mm, and Bragg wavelengths in the range of 1530  1580 nm were employed in this study. The FBG sensor gage lengths were smaller than one unit cell of the braided geometry, and were intentionally chosen as such in order to detect microscale strains. The FBG sensors were also bonded to the specimen surfaces using MBond 200. An MTS 634.12F24 extensometer with a 25 mm gage length and supplied mounting clips was used for the tests. A photograph of a gripped test specimen equipped with the MTS extensometer and a surface bonded FBG sensor is shown in Figure 27 (b). The strain gages were each connected to separate P3 strain gage indicators (see Figure 26), which were both connected to the MTS TestStar IIm through an analog input. The extensometer was connected directly to the MTS TestStar IIm, which was calibrated specifically for the data acquisition unit. This ensures the strain gage and extensometer data is synchronized with the force and displacement data through the data acquisition unit with a consistent timestamp. The FBG sensors were connected to a Micron Optics si425 interrogation device (connected to a separate PC), which provides the light source and records the reflected light wavelength. The si425 was independent of the MTS data acquisition unit, thus posttest interpolation algorithms were utilized for synchronizing the FBG data with the remaining test data. An Ando Aq6331 optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) was also employed for a number of tests to capture the entire FBG sensor wavelength spectrum. For the fatigue tests that employed FBG sensors, a ktype thermocouple adhered to the specimen surface was used to monitor the specimen surface temperature rise due to selfgenerated heating. The slight change in the surface temperature was used to correct the FBG signals in order to extract the actual mechanical strains.

4 Material and Experimental Details
4.3.2 Elevated Temperature Setup

For the elevated temperature tests, the MTS 322 test frame was equipped with custom clamptype mechanical grips. Alignment of the test frame mechanical grips was verified by using the same steel sample as was used for the hydraulic grips, again with minimal outof plane and inplane bending (<2%). An ATS 3610 environmental chamber with an integrated Watlow EZZone controller was used to maintain the elevated temperature environment. The mechanical grips protruded into the chamber to ensure that the entire test specimen was subjected to the heated environment. The dualthermocouple chamber provided convective heating to efficiently mix the air, which ensured the temperature along the length of the specimen was consistent within ±1C and that the temperature in the chamber was consistent for the duration of the test within ±0.5C. Prior to testing, the temperature was rampedup at a rate of 5C/minute from room temperature to the target test temperature. Once the target test temperature was reached, the specimen was allowed to condition for at least 60 minutes to ensure thermal stability before beginning each test. For a number of tests, a Ktype thermocouple was adhered to the specimen surface using Kapton tape to ensure the specimen temperature was in fact the same as the ambient air within the chamber. A photograph of a gripped test specimen within the environmental chamber is shown in Figure 28 (a), and a photograph of the operating environmental chamber is shown in Figure 28 (b). To monitor the axial strain, an Epsilon 35550100020 HT uncooled capacitivetype high temperature extensometer with a 25 mm gage length was used. The extensometer was surface mounted on the specimen and operated within the high temperature environment (see Figure 28 (a)). The Epsilon extensometer was connected to a calibrated 3603 signal conditioner, which was connected through an analog input on the MTS TestStar IIm to ensure synchronization with the force and displacement data. For some tests, Vishay WK06250BG350 strain gages were used to measure axial strain, and were bonded to the specimen surfaces using MBond 610 high temperature adhesive. These strain gages were connected to the same P3 strain indicators shown in Figure 26. In addition, similar polyimide coated FBG sensors used for the room temperature tests were employed for some elevated temperature static and fatigue tests, where the same aforementioned interrogator and OSA were also employed. For the fatigue

75

4 Material and Experimental Details tests that employed FBG sensors, the aforementioned surface adhered ktype thermocouple was also used to monitor the specimen surface temperature rise due to selfgenerated heating. The slight change in the surface temperature was used to correct the FBG signals in order to extract the actual mechanical strains. Note that for all elevated temperature tests, once the specimen was conditioned at the test temperature for the required time, the strain was zeroed to ensure only mechanical strains were measured.

4.4 Details of Damage Monitoring Techniques
The fundamental details of the damage monitoring techniques employed in this study were presented in Section 3.6. As indicated, FBG sensors and ER were used to detect local damage modes, track progression of different damage modes, and count cracks. IRT was used to develop a global map of damage and to observe the general development of damage throughout the specimen. These three techniques are considered NDE techniques. Finally, post
mortem destructive SEM analysis was used to confirm the damage modes observed using ER, to

determine the extent of damage and the distribution of damage, and to inspect for additional

76

4 Material and Experimental Details smallscale damage modes. These techniques were employed for both static and fatigue tests, at both room temperature and elevated temperatures. Note that these techniques were used for a number of static tests, and a number of fatigue tests at various maximum applied stresses, but were not employed for all conducted tests. The details of the equipment and the procedures for applying these techniques will be discussed in the following paragraphs. Uniform FBG sensors were bonded on the specimen surfaces to measure local strains, where an optical interrogator and an OSA were used to facilitate their use, as described in Section 4.3. The interrogator continuously recorded wavelength data with a frequency of 50 250 Hz. The data was then used to determine the local strains, as well as the number of peaks in a chirped FBG signal. These signals could then be related to the stressstrain data at a particular strain level for a static test, or a particular loading cycle for a fatigue test and correlated to a certain damage event. On the other hand, the OSA was used to record the entire wavelength spectrum to achieve the same objectives. Due to the slow 'sweeping' capability of the OSA, tests had to be paused in order to capture the spectra. In this study, static tests were paused at particular strain levels during quasistatic loading, while fatigue were paused after a certain number of loading cycles (i.e., various predetermined cyclic intervals). The same processes were used for all test temperatures, and the elevated temperature environment was uninterrupted for those tests. An ER technique was used to track damage development during both static and fatigue testing. The specimens used for extracting the replicas, which were originally wet sanded with 180grit and 320grit paper, were subsequently wet polished with 600grit and 1200grit paper, and finally with 1micron diamond paste using an extender fluid on a felt polishing cloth. This ensures that the microstructure of the constituent materials on the specimen edge where the replicas were extracted is clearly visible under microscopic investigation. During the tests, the replicas were taken by generously wetting a 125 m thick cellulose acetate film with acetone using a cotton swab. The film, which was secured to a rubber pad, was then pressed firmly against the polished edge of the specimen for approximately 6090 seconds which allowed time for the acetone to properly dry. This process consistently resulted in clear replicas of the microstructure and the associated damage. The rubber pad was used since it readily moulds

4 Material and Experimental Details around the specimen edge, providing a uniform pressure on the replication area for a superior edge replica. The replicas were subsequently observed using an optical microscope. Edge replicas were extracted at or near the center of the specimens. For determining crack densities, the number of cracks in an area of 10 mm2 was considered (see Appendix A.1 for more details). Both static and fatigue tests were required to be paused in order to extract the replicas. For the room temperature static tests, the tests were paused after particular strain levels were attained and the replicas were extracted. For room temperature and elevated temperature fatigue tests, the tests were paused after a certain number of loading cycles (i.e., various predetermined cyclic intervals) to extract the replicas. Note that for the elevated temperature fatigue tests, the specimen was cooled to extract the replicas and subsequently reheated to continue cycling. This was done at each predetermined cyclic interval. The specimens were cooled at a very slow rate (~ 2C/min) in order to avoid any 'thermal cyclic' effects on the test specimens, and were heated with the same rate originally used (i.e., 5C/min). This did not have a significant effect on the material behaviour, which was confirmed by comparing the fatigue lives and stiffness degradation profiles with the specimens that were continuously cycled without extracting the replicas. IRT was utilized to record temperature data from the surface of static and fatigue loaded test specimens. A FLIR SC5000 IR camera with a pixel resolution of 320x240 and a temperature sensitivity of <20 mK was used in a passive approach to monitor the loaded specimen surface temperature. This enabled the detection of the thermal emissions caused by damage initiation and/or propagation within the composite during both static and fatigue loading. The commercial software Altair was used in conjunction with the IR camera to capture the specified thermographic images. For the static tests, images were captured in a realtime video with a frame rate of 50 Hz, which allowed for realtime capture of damage progression. For the fatigue tests, images were captured in a sequential video with a frame rate of one frame per cycle (or every 10th cycle for some tests). This enabled tracking the temperature profile as a function of the number of loading cycles, and to detect damage development during cyclic loading by comparing the sequence of obtained thermographic images. In order to facilitate this for the fatigue tests, the IR camera was synchronized to the MTS TestStar IIm digital controller. An

78

4 Material and Experimental Details analog voltage signal was generated by the load data in the MTS controller and was sent as input for triggering the image sequences for the IR camera. These images were triggered at the same point for each particular cycle (i.e., when the maximum stress was attained). This was necessary in order to eliminate any variation in temperature due to reversible thermoelastic heating which is caused by cycling between maximum and minimum cyclic stresses [118]. A schematic of temperature variation due to thermoelastic heating and heat dissipation during cyclic loading is shown in Figure 29 (a), while a schematic of when the IR camera is triggered to extract images during each cycle is shown in Figure 29 (b). The IRT technique was utilized continuously and insitu without interrupting the tests. In order to use IRT for the elevated temperature tests, the observation window glass of the environmental chamber was removed (see Figure 28), which was necessary to allow the emitted IR waves to reach the camera. A photograph of the room temperature setup utilizing the IR camera is shown in Figure 30.

Finally, the destructive technique employed in this study was microstructure characterization using a SEM. The test specimens that were inspected post mortem were sectioned into small samples using a wet diamond saw, mainly in the crosssectional or axial sectional planes of the test specimens. The cut samples were then mounted in a cylindrical mould and a coldcuring epoxy was used to create a puck with the embedded sample. The inspection edge of the sample was visible at the surface of the puck, and was subsequently wet sanded with 180grit and 320grit paper, followed by wet polishing with 600grit paper, 1200 grit paper and 1micron diamond paste using an extender fluid on a felt polishing cloth. The inspection edge was then goldcoated in a Denton Vacuum Desk IV (CTC Parker Automation). The samples were all examined under a JEOL JSM6380LV SEM, while some samples were inspected using an optical microscope. For examining the fracture surfaces using the SEM, no preparation was required. It should be noted at this stage that for the braided composite, SEM examination was also used to confirm that damage was in fact widespread throughout the specimen width and thickness. SEM examination of all tested samples revealed that visible damage on the edges was consistent with damage in the interior of the specimens (i.e., there

80

4 Material and Experimental Details was no edgeinduced damage). This observation allowed for effective use of the aforementioned ER technique, the results of which will be presented in Chapter 5.

4.5 Test Procedures
Although tests were conducted at both room temperature and elevated temperatures, the tests were all conducted under isothermal conditions. The test procedures presented in the subsequent paragraphs were similar regardless of the test temperature. The room temperature recorded for those corresponding experiments was approximately 25C, while the elevated test temperature for the braided and woven/RP46 specimens was (Tg, temperature for the woven/BMI specimens was 205C. Uniaxial ultimate static tensile tests were conducted in displacement control with a constant displacement rate of 2.0 mm/minute, in accordance with ASTM Standard D3039 [176]. For static tests that were paused for edge replica extraction, once the replicas were obtained during the displacement dwell, loading was resumed under the same displacement rate. Uniaxial tensiontension fatigue tests were conducted in load control with a constant amplitude sinusoidal waveform, a stress ratio of 0.1 and a loading frequency of 5 Hz in accordance with ASTM Standard D3479 [177]. Various maximum stresses were used for the fatigue tests. The test specimens were allowed to cycle until failure occurred or until a predetermined number of cycles was reached. For fatigue tests that were paused under a zeroload dwell for extracting edge replicas, a displacementcontrolled static test up to the maximum cyclic load followed by unloading down to the minimum cyclic load was conducted after the replicas were obtained. This provided another means for measuring the evolving specimen stiffness, as is suggested in ASTM Standard D3479 [177]. Cycling was resumed after the intermediate cyclic test was completed. Note, for all static and fatigue tests that employed ER, the interruption of the tests did not cause any changes in the material behaviour. This was confirmed by comparing the results of those tests with the tests that were uninterrupted. An alternate type of test was conducted for a few specimens utilizing the IR camera in an attempt to determine the fatigue threshold of the composite. The method was originally developed by Risitano [178] for metallic materials, and will hereafter be referred to as
wet

81

4 Material and Experimental Details Risitano's method. The main points for proper application of Risitano's method are summarized in Appendix A.2. Note that only one test specimen was utilized for this test procedure. The method employed here consisted of cycling the specimen with a constant amplitude sinusoidal waveform in load control (R = 0.1, f = 10 Hz) for blocks of 7,000 loading cycles. The test begins with the first loading block subjected to the lowest peak stress level (e.g., 35% UTS  ultimate tensile stress) for 7,000 cycles. Once the 7,000 cycles are completed, the specimen is allowed to 'cool' back to ambient temperatures under a zeroload dwell (recall the surface temperature increases due to loading). The next loading block then begins under the next peak stress, and this procedure continues at incremental peak stresses (e.g., 40% UTS, 45% UTS, 50% UTS, etc.) until the specimen fails.

4.6 Data Analysis
The raw data acquired during both static and fatigue tests included the time, LVDT displacement values, load transducer load values, extensometer strains, and for some static tests the strain gage strains and FBG wavelengths. The axial stresses were calculated from the recorded forces and the average specimen crosssectional area. The extensometer provided an analog signal in units of voltage, which were converted to strain values by the MTS TestStar IIm digital controller based on the manufacturer calibration data. The strain gages also provided an analog signal in units of voltage, but the P3 strain gage indicators were not initially calibrated to the MTS controller. The calibration curves for the P3 indicators were subsequently determined and coded within the MTS controller to provide strain in units of mm/mm. For the FBG sensor wavelength data, Equation (10) was used to determine the corresponding strains. For the static tests, data was stored with a frequency of one data point every 0.1 seconds for the duration of the test. The axial modulus (E11) was determined by fitting a linear regression to the axial stressstrain data within the axial strain range of 0.1%  0.6% as specified in ASTM Standard D3039 [176]. The major Poisson's ratio (12) was determined by fitting a linear regression to the transverse strainaxial strain data within the axial strain range of 0.1%  0.6%, also specified by ASTM Standard D3039 [176].

82

4 Material and Experimental Details For the fatigue tests, additional data output was required in order to monitor the material hysteretic behaviour during cycling, which was in the form of continuous stressstrain data and 'peakvalley' data periodically recorded at specified cycles. For the fatigue tests that were paused to extract edge replicas, the intermediate static test data was stored with a frequency of one data point every 0.1 seconds during both loading and unloading. To determine the dynamic stiffness, E(n), for a particular loading cycle n, a regression on the axial stressstrain load/unload data was conducted. A schematic of the regression fit for E(n) for a particular cycle,
n, is shown in Figure 31. The mean strain and the strain range are determined from the

maximum and minimum strains for a particular loading cycle, and defined by:
max (n) + min (n) 2

mean (n) =

(40)

(n) = max (n)  min (n)

(41)

The ratcheting strain, r, can also be quantified by considering the minimum strain for a particular loading cycle, and its difference relative to the minimum strain prior to the first loading cycle.
r = min (n)  min (0)

(42)

Finally, the energy dissipated per unit volume, Ed(n), during one loading cycle can be determined by quantifying the area between the cyclic stressstrain curves as shown schematically in Figure 31. Although it may be difficult to directly calculate the energy dissipated on a cyclebycycle basis from experimental data, storing a sufficient number of data points per cycle during testing can yield fairly accurate predictions [50]. In this study, 80 data points were found to be sufficiently accurate for calculating the dissipated energy per cycle. This was done by numerically integrating the stressstrain data cyclebycycle to obtain the area between the corresponding curves.

5 BRAIDED MATERIAL TEST RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The experimental results and the corresponding analysis for the triaxial braided test specimens will now be presented. Initially, the room temperature tensile static and fatigue test results will be outlined and discussed, followed by the elevated temperature test results. Additional creep test and aging results for the braided composite will then be presented in Section 5.3. Detailed discussions of the relevant experimental results will be presented within each corresponding section.

5.1 Room Temperature Results
5.1.1 Completed Test Overview

The main initiatives for the room temperature tests were to determine the material properties, develop a fatigue SN curve, characterize the development of damage during both quasistatic and cyclic tensile loading, and to relate the observed microscopic damage mechanisms to the exhibited macroscopic material behaviour. The room temperature results and observations also provided a basis for the elevated temperature experiments. In total, four ultimate static tensile tests were conducted. Two of these tests included the use of ER while IRT was employed for one test. For the tensiontension fatigue tests, a minimum of two and a maximum of four tests were conducted at each maximum applied stress level. ER and IRT were

85

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis employed for a number of fatigue tests at each maximum applied stress level. Also, two additional tests were conducted to determine the braided composite fatigue threshold using Risitano's thermographic method [178].
5.1.2 Static Results

The results of the room temperature static tests outlined in Section 4.5 will be presented. Initially the material stressstrain behaviour and static properties will be shown, followed by a detailed characterization of damage and analysis of the fracture surface.
5.1.2.1 Material behaviour A typical stressstrain plot for an ultimate static test is shown in Figure 32 (a). At room

temperature the material exhibits a bilinear response with an average ultimate tensile stress (UTS) of 393 MPa and a transition stress of approximately 240 MPa, which corresponds to 61% UTS. The transition strain was found to be approximately 0.765%, while the failure strain was 1.38%. The presented static bilinear behaviour for the braided composite is analogous to that exhibited by some statically loaded quasiisotropic polymeric laminates [7]. The axial modulus (E11) and secondary modulus after transition of the braided composite were found to be 31.13 GPa and 25.2 GPa, respectively, which corresponds to an instantaneous drop in stiffness of approximately 20% at the transition. A plot of the transverse strainaxial strain is shown in Figure 32 (b); the axial strain was obtained using a surfacemounted extensometer while the transverse strain was obtained using a bonded resistance strain gage. The major Poisson's ratio (12) was determined to be 0.286, which instantly reduced to 0.234 after the transition. The main material parameters for each tested specimen are summarized in Table 8, with the average values also included. As shown, the scatter in the data is negligible with less than 2% deviation from the average values. Figure 33 illustrates the static axial stressstrain plots for test specimen B108 using both the measured extensometer and strain gage strain values; this particular test specimen was equipped with both a surface mounted extensometer and a bonded strain gage. The extensometer strain values produce a smooth stressstrain profile through the transition, while the strain gage strain values exhibited a slight variation in the signal during the transition. The

86

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis strain sensors both produced smooth stressstrain profiles before and after the transition `region'. The variation in the strain profile during the transition region is due to the difference in the gage length of the strain gage and extensometer, which are 6 mm and 25 mm respectively. The strain gage has detected a variation in the local strain which is caused by a local variation in the test specimen deformation, but was not detected by the extensometer. Additional details regarding this local phenomenon will be presented in the subsequent section.

5.1.2.2 Damage characterization A microscopic investigation was conducted to track the development of damage from

crack initiation up until final specimen failure, as well as determining the cause of the exhibited transition behaviour. To assist with the detection of damage development, FBG sensors, edge replication and IRT were all employed. In addition, post mortem SEM, including an analysis of the fracture surface, was utilized to determine the final failure mechanisms. Two of the tested static specimens were suited with surface bonded FBG sensors. Recall that chirping of FBG sensor wavelength spectra is a direct result of a nonuniform strain field along the grating length, which can be caused by local damage in composites. An indication of the degree of FBG sensor chirping is a measure of the total number of detected wavelength peaks, which can qualitatively be associated with local damage. Figure 34 illustrates plots of the number of wavelength peaks and the axial stress during a static test. Initially, only one wavelength peak is detected for the FBG sensor (i.e., no chirping). Once the transition stress is reached after approximately 75 seconds, the first sign of chirping is detected and subsequently followed by significant chirping for the duration of loading up until specimen failure after 132 seconds. This confirms that at the transition stress a significant amount damage suddenly initiated and/or propagated. This is in alignment with the detected strain gage signal variation when the transition stress was attained.

Two of the conducted static tests involved the use of ER to monitor crack development on the specimen edge as the applied stress increased. Recall that the tests were paused at predefined stress levels to extract the edge replicas, after which the loading resumed until the subsequent stress level was attained. This process was repeated until specimen failure occurred, providing a chronology of damage events in the material from initial crack development to final specimen failure. Figure 35 shows a series of images taken of obtained edge replicas using an optical microscope with a 60X magnification. The fiber yarns oriented in the loading axis (i.e., 0 direction) are indicated in the image. The offaxis braider yarns are the darker regions, while the lighter regions are the resinrich zones. The unloaded (virgin) material contained no damage as shown in Figure 35 (a). The three main observed damage modes are illustrated in the photographs of Figure 35 including braider yarn cracks, fiber yarn interface cracks and matrix cracks in the resinrich zones. Damage initiated at lower stress levels as shown in Figure 35 (b), where the majority of visible cracks were smallscale matrix cracks at the braider yarnmatrix interfaces and cracking within the ±60 braider yarns. There were however few cracks at these stress levels. As loading progressed up until a load level of 225 MPa, slightly more braider yarn cracks developed as shown in Figure 35 (c). The observed damage was found to be distributed throughout the specimen, although at this stage in loading the number of cracks per braider yarn was typically limited to one. Note also that at this stage

89

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis in loading there were no cracks in the 0 yarns and no indication of largescale fiber yarn debonding, which is analogous to delamination in conventional laminates and will hereafter be simply referred to as largescale debonding. Once the loading level exceeded the transition stress, the number of observed cracks significantly increased instantaneously and they were widespread with consistent density throughout the specimen length. Again, the majority of cracks observed were throughtheyarnthickness cracks within the braider yarns with many fiber yarns containing more than one crack. In addition, there was also evidence of some cracking in the 0 yarns at this stage. The number of interface cracks between adjacent braider yarns and at the braider yarnmatrix interfaces also slightly increased after the transition stress was exceeded, although these were localized cracks as shown in Figure 35 (d). There was still no indication of any largescale debonding cracks or cracking at the braider yarn and 0 yarn interfaces. As the loading increased beyond the transition stress, the braider yarn crack density slightly increased until just prior to final failure. The chronology of damage development is shown by the crack density plot (i.e., number of cracks/mm2) in Figure 36 (a). Three equivalent size zones along the length of the specimen edge were used to determine the average crack density. The three main observed damage mechanisms including braider yarn cracks, yarn interface cracks and matrix cracks are included in the plot. Figure 36 (b) shows a schematic of these three main damage mechanisms observed during static testing. It is illustrated in the plot that the braider yarn crack density increases at a gradual rate during the initial stages of loading. When the transition stress is reached, there is a sudden increase in the braider yarn crack density. Beyond this stage, there is only a slight increase in the crack density up to final failure. The braider yarn cracks are clearly the dominant damage mechanism during tensile static loading, having a much higher density compared to the other observed damage modes. Photomicrographs of the failed specimen crosssection obtained by SEM are shown in Figure 37 (a) and (b), where the 0 yarns are outlined for clarity in Figure 37 (a). The damage mechanisms observed on the ER films are confirmed by the SEM photomicrographs, where damage is widespread throughout all of the braider yarns. There are no largescale debonds or cracks in the 0 yarns as shown, where in fact the 0 yarns seem to arrest the throughthethickness braider yarn cracks as seen in Figure 37 (b) and the optical

90

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis photograph of the specimen axialsection shown in Figure 37 (c). Although the 0 yarns have crimped during manufacturing, there are no indications of any fiber straightening up to specimen failure. The adjacent braider yarn interface cracks are confirmed to be localized as shown, which have resulted from localized shear strains at the crossover locations between +60 and 60 fiber yarns. This type of localized shearing mechanism between braider yarns was observed for similar geometrical triaxial braided polymeric composites [99].

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis It is clear that the exhibited stressstrain behaviour is dominated by the observed damage development mechanism in the braider yarns. It can be gleaned that during static loading prior to the transition stress level, there are a number of smaller braider yarn cracks that are possibly not yet through the entire yarn thickness and not propagated along the entire length of the braider yarns. When the transition stress level was attained, these small braider yarn cracks instantly propagated along the braider yarn axis, and possibly many cracks within a braider yarn at different locations along its length instantly coalesced. This was the cause of severe FBG sensor chirping (see Figure 34 (a)). This ultimately caused the braider yarns to be less effective in resisting axial stresses and transverse deformation. As a result, a portion of the stress was redistributed to the 0 yarns and the axial material compliance instantaneously increased. This is analogous to the `first ply failure' phenomenon exhibited by some quasiisotropic laminates, which exhibit similar stress redistribution upon the loss of the load carrying capability of the transverse or offaxis plies [20]. The transverse compliance also instantaneously increased which was in part due to a reduction in local shear deformation resistance and slight rotation of the braider yarns. This was observed by the localized interface cracks between the +60°/60° braider yarns. In addition, the observed cracks in the braider yarns would tend to cause the yarns to separate in the direction normal to the yarn axis which would also contribute to the increased compliance in both the axial and transverse directions. To further confirm the discussed damage development states, IRT was employed for one static test specimen to continuously monitor the specimen surface temperature in realtime up to failure. Figure 38 (a) through (d) presents a series of thermographs extracted from a video that was captured using the IR camera at the indicated stress levels. The contours shown in the thermographs are in fact the rise in temperature (i.e., T), not the absolute temperatures. The realtime thermographs confirm that the temperature peaks consistently occurred within the braider yarns, which correspond to extensive cracking in those fiber yarns. Strains are typically higher in the braider yarns in triaxial braided composites, which would result in extensive cracking in these yarns [99]. It is also confirmed that the density of braider yarn cracks was much higher during the latter stages of loading and that damage was widespread throughout the specimen length. The initiation of damage in the braider yarns is indicated by the sudden

93

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis temperature increases in the braider yarn regions (i.e., the lighter regions in the thermographs) at lower stress levels (see Figure 38 (a)). As loading progressed the initiated cracks began to propagate along the braider yarn directions and additional cracks continued to form, which maintained higher temperatures within the damaged braider yarns and/or caused more sudden temperature increases, respectively. As the transition stress was attained, the sudden onset and propagation of braider yarn cracking was captured as shown in Figure 38 (c). As the stress level approached the ultimate, the braider yarns all showed indications of cracking, which is consistent with the post mortem SEM observations. The IR camera has successfully captured the progressive damage states within the braider yarns during static loading. In order to more clearly illustrate the temperature variation between the braider yarns and the resinrich zones of the test specimens, an additional test was conducted using the lockin thermographic feature of the IR camera. Lockin thermography is useful for establishing local stress concentrations on materials based on the principle of thermoelasticity [179]. To facilitate this, a test specimen was cycled at a low stress level of 120 MPa with a loading frequency of 5 Hz and a stress ratio of 0.1. This allowed the test specimen gage section to obtain a constant surface temperature, which was required for the lockin feature of the IR camera to accurately perform. An obtained thermograph of the specimen is shown in Figure 38 (e). The high temperatures exhibited by the braider yarns are clearly regions subjected to higher local stresses when compared to the resin rich zones between the braider yarns. This further supports the damage observations obtained through SEM and from the edge replicas, as well as the occurrence of instantaneous braider yarn crack development at the transition stress which caused increased material compliance. The fracture surfaces of ultimate tensile static test specimens were also investigated to determine the final damage states which led to the observed test specimen failure event. Figure 39 (a) is an image of the fracture surface, while Figure 39 (b)(c) are photomicrographs of the fracture surface obtained by SEM. The area affected by the fracture is very localized as shown. The fracture line has propagated along the +60 braider yarn axis, which resulted in fracture of the 0 and 60 fiber yarns. The material stressstrain behaviour revealed that there was no significant elongation prior to failure indicating brittlenatured fracture, which is clear in Figure 39 (a). The presence of fiber pullout is revealed by the brushy appearance of the

94

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis fracture surface and confirmed in Figure 39 (b) by the bare fibers, which is a characteristic of brittle fracture. Furthermore, there was little indication of largescale debonding and evidence of localized matrix fallout in the fracture region which is also a characteristic of brittlenatured fracture. The fractured braider yarns tended to separate into smaller bundles as shown in Figure 39 (c), which is due to the existing cracks that developed in the braider yarns during loading. The separation of the 0 yarns due to splitting cracks reveals that cracking in these yarns occurred just prior to fracture; these type of cracks were not observed at locations in the specimens further from the fracture surface. Prior to failure, the braider yarn crack density reached a threshold after which local fiber breakage and matrix cracks significantly developed in and around these yarns at the eventual fracture location. At this stage the 0 yarns were supporting the entire applied load, which resulted in localized splitting and weakening of these yarns. This subsequently led to more local fiber fracture, which ultimately resulted in fracture of the 0 yarns at final failure instantaneously. Note that there was only evidence of slight localized fiber yarn rotation at the fracture surface as is clear in Figure 39 (a). In addition, the obtained thermographs further confirmed that the fracture zone was in fact localized, and was preceded by a high accumulation of local high temperature 'hot spots' (i.e., local damage development).

5.1.3 Fatigue Results

The results of the room temperature fatigue tests outlined in Section 4.5 will now be presented. Initially the developed SN curve will be presented, followed by an overview of the exhibited material behaviour, a detailed characterization of damage development, and finally a discussion focussed on correlating the microscopic damage observations with the exhibited material behaviour.
5.1.3.1 SN data Fatigue tests were conducted for a number of maximum applied stresses within the range

of 50%85% UTS until specimen failure occurred or until a predefined runoff was reached. The corresponding stresslife (SN) curve for the braided composite is shown in Figure 41, where the average fatigue life values for each maximum applied stress are shown in the plot. Note that due to the limited number of test specimens available, a statistical analysis of the SN data was not conducted and therefore omitted. The ordinate of the plot is the ratio of the maximum applied stress over the static ultimate tensile stress (max/Su), while the abscissa is the number of cycles to failure (Nf) on a logarithmic scale. The data point on the ordinate corresponds to the static strength of the material. A runoff of 107 cycles was defined in this study as is indicated on the plot for stress levels of 50% and 60% UTS, which did not amount to failure for any test specimens cycled at these maximum applied stresses. For composite materials a semi logarithmic relationship is often found to fit the SN data, which was the case for the SN data presented in Figure 41. The corresponding relationship determined from a numerical regression analysis is defined in Equation (43). Note that data for the test specimens cycled for 107 cycles without failure were not included in the regression. The data correlation factor, R2, of 0.9930 illustrates that the SN data has an excellent fit defined by the semilogarithmic relationship. The numerical coefficients of Equation (43) for the braided composite at room temperature were found to be A = 0.0507 and b = 1.00.

The SN data suggests that there may in fact be a fatigue limit for the braided composite material, or more accurately a high cycle fatigue strength (HCFS), which may exist in the range of 6065% UTS (235255 MPa). From the results of many fatigue studies available in the literature it appears that conventional polymeric composites do not typically have a fatigue limit, but instead damage progresses during the entire life of the material which causes failure even at very low applied stresses [16]. This was previously discussed in Section 3.1. It has been recently shown that some polymeric composites do exhibit a fatigue threshold or HCFS, which may be due to a damage saturation state at lower applied stresses hindering the onset of failure [181]. This may not necessarily be a true fatigue limit but a new 'finite life region' that is distinct from the main slope of the SN curve, as shown in Figure 41. This is in fact a characteristic of the triaxial braided composite material under investigation. To confirm the existence of a HCFS, Risitano's thermographic approach for rapidly determining the fatigue limit was adopted [178]. This method was used successfully to determine the HCFS of a woven carbon fiber laminate [52], and a noncrimp glass fabric laminate [181]. The tests were conducted using a loading frequency of 10 Hz, as discussed in Section 4.5. Note that although the loading frequency is different when compared to the fatigue tests that were conducted to develop Figure 41, the resulting HCFS determined from the thermographic approach will not alter by varying the loading frequency. Figure 42 is a plot

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis of the absolute surface temperature as a function of the number of loading cycles for a test specimen, which was obtained using the IR camera. The maximum applied stress for each cyclic subtest is indicated for each profile in the plot. Note that 7000 loading cycles were applied at each maximum applied stress, which was sufficient for attaining a constant temperature plateau. The temperature profile eventually stabilized which is evident for all indicated stress levels. The same location was used for each stress level to create the temperature profiles shown in Figure 42, which was at the eventual failure location of the test specimen. Figure 43 shows a sequence of surface temperature profiles, after stabilization, within the gage section for the indicated maximum applied stress levels. Up to a cyclic load of 55% UTS, there is uniform temperature across the specimen surface. As the load increases there is a clear region where the temperature is higher (i.e., a hot zone), which is where the specimen ultimately failed. Using each corresponding stabilization temperature, the temperature increase (Tstab) is plotted as a function of the maximum applied stress in Figure 44. The maximum stress magnitude at which the dissipated heat rise becomes greater is evident in the plot, which shows the characteristic bilinear profile employed for this thermographic technique. This corresponds to an approximate HCFS of 64% UTS (252 MPa), which is within the range obtained by plotting the SN curve of Figure 41. This confirms that a HCFS for the braided composite material exists, and has been accurately obtained using thermography.

The accuracy of the thermographic technique for determining the HCFS of the braided composite necessitates further investigation into the successful outcome of the approach. It is known that intrinsic energy dissipation in composites during cyclic loading, which may be caused by different modes of cracking or local matrix deformation, results in a corresponding dissipation of heat every cycle [56, 97]. If the energy dissipated per cycle is considered, a correlation between the temperature rise and the energy dissipation can in fact be made. The energy dissipated per unit volume of material during one loading cycle (i.e., hysteresis) can be

100

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis determined by quantifying the area between the loading and unloading stressstrain curves (see Section 4.6). By comparing the energy dissipated during a particular cycle during the temperature stabilization range (e.g., cycle 5,000) for each maximum applied stress, a correlation between the energy dissipation and the maximum applied stress was established. A plot of the energy dissipated per unit volume as a function of the maximum applied stress is shown in Figure 45 (a). A similar bilinear profile was obtained as found in Figure 44. A HCFS value of 63% UTS (248 MPa) was found for the composite material, which is similar to that obtained using the thermographic approach. A plot of the energy dissipation per unit volume versus the increase in temperature at stabilization is shown in Figure 45 (b). The relation between the temperature rise and the energy dissipated per cycle is in fact linear, with a data correlation factor, R2, close to 1. This supports the hypothesis that the dissipated heat measured with the IR camera during cycling is in fact due to the intrinsic energy dissipation of the material, which is an important finding in this study.

The established HCFS is a distinctive characteristic of the braided composite material under investigation. It should also be noted that the HCFS is also approximately equal to the exhibited static transition stress (see Figure 32). This implies that the fatigue threshold represents a transition in the damage state, or perhaps a change in damage propagation on different size scales (i.e., microscale to macroscale). This is a likely scenario considering the

101

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis notable instantaneous change in braider yarn crack density during static testing when the transition stress was exceeded. Consider the cyclic stressstrain behaviour of the braided composite during the first loading cycle. Figure 46 (a) and (b) illustrate loadunload stressstrain plots for the first loading cycle of test specimens that were cyclically loading with a maximum applied stress of 70% UTS (275 MPa) and 50% UTS (195 MPa), respectively. The specimen cycled at 275 MPa (i.e., greater than the HCFS) exhibited significant ratcheting and energy dissipation in the first cycle, where the bilinear stressstrain behaviour is evident on the loading portion of the curve. This degree of ratcheting and energy dissipation was not demonstrated for any subsequent loading cycles for the duration of cycling. The specimen cycled at 195 MPa exhibited far less energy dissipation and negligible ratcheting during the first loading cycle as shown in Figure 46 (b). There is clearly a distinction in the exhibited stressstrain behaviour and thus the damage state for test specimens cycled with maximum applied stress that are greater than or less than the HCFS. Analogous behaviour was observed with quasiisotropic laminates, where cyclic loading with a maximum applied stress greater than the static first ply failure stress resulted in offaxis plies failing during the first loading cycle due to excessive damage [20]. For the braided composite, the HCFS is a critical damage state above which significant cracking occurs after the first loading cycle which likely accelerates crack development and ultimately leads to specimen failure. When the maximum applied stress is below this critical damage state, failure does not occur. This has resulted in notably different material behaviour depending on whether the maximum applied stress is greater or less than the HCFS or critical damage state, which will be investigated further in the subsequent section.

5.1.3.2 Material behaviour The variation in hysteretic behaviour exhibited by polymeric composite materials during cyclic loading is the product of various microscopic mechanisms, such as cracking and localized matrix deformation. The main forms of hysteresis variation typically include stiffness degradation, ratcheting, and evolving energy dissipation as outlined in Chapter 3. Plots of the normalized dynamic stiffness, E(n)/Eo, as a function of the number of loading cycles, n, for test specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses of 50%, 60%, 65%, 70% and 80% UTS (195, 235, 255, 275, 315 MPa) are shown collectively in Figure 47 (a). Note that the dynamic stiffness, E(n), was normalized by the initial dynamic stiffness, Eo, for all plots. The same plots are included in Figure 47 (b), which only shows the initial 100,000 loading cycles. All test specimens cycled to failure demonstrated a threestage stiffness degradation response, which is typically exhibited by many conventional crossply and quasiisotropic laminates [25, 34]. This was characterized by rapid stiffness degradation during the first stage, followed by gradual stiffness degradation during the second stage, and finally rapid degradation in the third stage leading to specimen failure. For the test specimens with maximum applied stresses of 195 MPa and 235 MPa, there is a distinct difference in the stiffness degradation profile. This was characterized by initial rapid stiffness degradation, followed by a much more gradual degradation for the duration of the test. The majority of the stiffness loss occurred during the first stage for all samples tested, regardless of the maximum applied stress magnitude. For the samples cycled to 103

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis failure, the final stage of rapid stiffness degradation occurred during the last 5% of the sample life. This resulted in a relatively low magnitude stiffness drop prior to failure. There was more stiffness degradation after a comparable number of cycles as the maximum applied stress increased as is illustrated in Figure 47 (b). This is an expected result since there would be a further advanced damage state at higher maximum applied stresses. The specimens cycled with maximum stresses greater than the HCFS also exhibited notably more stiffness degradation compared with the runoff specimens after a comparable number of cycles. For example, after 10,000 loading cycles the 195 MPa and 235 MPa specimens exhibited a residual stiffness between 9495%, while the residual stiffness for the 255315 MPa specimens was below 92%. There is a clear gap in the residual stiffness magnitude after a particular number of loading cycles between the specimens cycled with maximum stresses below the HCFS and those cycled above. If the specimens cycled to failure are considered, there was more stiffness degradation at failure for the specimens cycled with lower maximum applied stresses. This is illustrated in Figure 48 which shows a plot of the normalized stiffness as a function of the normalized number of cycles, n/Nf, which also illustrates the three stages of stiffness degradation. Since stiffness can be correlated to a particular damage state, it is expected that the 255 MPa test specimens will have more damage at failure compared to say the 315 MPa specimens [59, 60]. For example, the 315 MPa test specimens failed after approximately 50K cycles with a residual stiffness of 87%, presumably as the residual strength reduced to the maximum applied stress. This was a result of the critical damage state at that particular applied stress level that caused failure. The 255 MPa test specimens on the other hand failed after approximately 6.5M cycles with a residual stiffness of 81%. These specimens reached a residual stiffness of 87% (i.e., equal to the residual stiffness at failure for the 315 MPa specimens) much earlier on in cycling. This particular damage state did not cause failure for the 255 MPa test specimens because the residual strength was still higher than the maximum applied stress, thus damage continued to progress and the stiffness continued to degrade. Once the critical damage state for this particular stress level was attained, the residual strength was equal to the maximum applied stress and the specimen failed (i.e., after 6.5M cycles). This illustrates that less damage is required to cause failure at higher stresses, and therefore a

104

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis constant critical stiffness (or a critical damage state) cannot be used as an indicator of failure. If the critical stiffness is defined as a function of max, failure may be predicted using this approach. This will be considered in the subsequent paragraph. The stiffness degradation rate during the second stage of cycling and the total average stiffness degradation rate can yield qualitative information on the damage development rate during cyclic loading. Plots of the secondstage stiffness degradation rate (dE(n)/dn|2) and the total average stiffness degradation rate (Etotal/Nf) as functions of the maximum applied stress ratio (max/Su) are shown in Figure 49 (a) and (b), respectively. The stiffness degradation rates clearly increase with increasing maximum stress. A regression on the plotted data illustrates that a power law function is a suitable fit to the data, with R2 values close to 1 as shown in Figure 49. This is an important finding for the braided composite material, which implies that there is a mathematical relationship between the progressive damage state and the maximum applied stress. A similar relationship between the damage rate (i.e., the stiffness degradation rate) and the maximum applied stress was found for a quasiisotropic carbon fiber/epoxy laminate [154] and for a biaxial braided composite [66].

As discussed in Chapter 3, the mean strain is an indirect measure of both stiffness degradation and strain ratcheting, and is in general another indicator of the evolving hysteretic material behaviour. A plot of the measured mean strain, mean, as a function of the number of loading cycles, n, for test specimens cycled with the indicated maximum applied stresses are shown collectively in Figure 50 (a). The same plots are included in Figure 50 (b), which only shows the initial 100,000 loading cycles. Similar to the stiffness plots for the specimens that were cycled to failure, the mean strain follows a threestage evolution consisting of rapid

106

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis increase during the early stage, followed by a gradual increase for the majority of the specimen life, and finally a rapid increase prior to failure. The mean strain rate during the second stage of cycling increased as the maximum applied stress increased, and was found to be related to max by a power law function as shown in Figure 51. In order to isolate the degree of strain ratcheting for each applied maximum stress level, the mean strain and strain range () can be graphically compared [57, 47]. Figure 52 (a) and (b) show combined profiles of mean and  on a semilogarithmic scale for test specimens cycled at 195 MPa and 275 MPa, respectively. For each maximum applied cyclic stress level, the mean strain rate was higher in magnitude compared to the strain range rate during the early stages of cycling. However, for the subsequent duration of cycling, the mean strain and strain range profiles evolved identically until specimen failure. This implies that during the early stages of cycling notable strain ratcheting occurs, however, ratcheting subsides afterwards and is negligible for the duration of cyclic loading. Recall that strain ratcheting of composite specimens subjected to stress controlled cycling with a positive mean stress may be due to damage evolution, as well as creep deformation and fiber reorientation [47, 72]. The stiffness degradation plots of Figure 47 reveal that there is rapid stiffness degradation during the early stage of cycling, which is an indication of significant damage development. This suggests that the initially exhibited strain ratcheting is primarily due to damage accumulation and to a lesser extent creep deformation, while the negligible strain ratcheting that occurred for the duration of cycling is also due to damage. This will be discussed further in Section 5.1.3.4.

The evolution of the energy dissipation (i.e., the area contained within the cyclic stress strain ellipse) is another measure of the evolving hysteretic material behaviour during cyclic loading. Plots of the energy dissipation (Ed) for the indicated maximum stresses are shown on a semilogarithmic scale in Figure 53 (a). For all applied cyclic stress levels, the energy dissipated during the first loading cycle was considerably high. During the subsequent loading cycles Ed rapidly decreased in magnitude until reaching a plateau, after which Ed was approximately constant or decreasing at a very gradual rate. The cyclic energy dissipation maintained this plateau for the majority of cyclic loading. Figure 53 (b) shows similar plots on a linear scale for

108

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis specimens cycled with maximum stresses of 195 MPa and 275 MPa. For the specimens cycled to failure, the dissipated energy increased slightly during the cycles prior to failure as shown in Figure 53 (b). The evolution of Ed implies that the severe onset of damage and the potential local viscous matrix behaviour during the first few loading cycles contributed to the initially high dissipated energy exhibited by the test specimens. As cycling progressed, the dissipated energy rapidly decreased since the degree of damage and local viscous matrix behaviour began to subside. For the duration of cyclic loading, Ed remained fairly constant which implies that the local viscous effects and/or evolving damage attained a constant rate. For the specimens cycled to failure, the increase in Ed prior to fracture was due to the rapid accumulation of damage leading to the final failure event. The results from Figure 52 showed that strain ratcheting occurred during the initial stages of cycling, which supports the fact that any potential viscous or creep behaviour only occurs during the initial few loading cycles. Thus, the dominant mechanism contributing to the presented energy dissipation evolution is in fact fatigue damage development. A study by Cain [96] on offaxis unidirectional carbon fiber laminates found that the energy dissipation evolution was similar to that shown for the braided composite material of this study (i.e., rapid decrease, then constant throughout the duration of cycling). It was also stated that strain ratcheting caused by creep only occurred during the first few loading cycles [96], which supports the observations of this study. Montesano et al. [72] also found a similar energy dissipation evolution for an offaxis wovenply laminate. It was stated that the initial energy dissipation was due to local viscous effects and fiber reorientation, which eventually subsided for the duration of cyclic loading. This also supports the observations made in this study for the braided composite material. An interesting observation established for the braided composite material is that there exists a correlation between the magnitude of the dissipated energy during the 'plateau' and the maximum applied stress level. A plot of the plateau energy dissipation values as a function of max is shown in Figure 54. A power law function fits the data well as shown by the data correlation factor in the plot. This illustrates that for the majority of cyclic loading, there is a 'constant' driving force causing energy to dissipate which is a function of the maximum applied

Plots of successive stressstrain curves for the indicated cycles during the early stages of cycling for specimens loaded at 235 MPa and 275 MPa maximum applied stresses are shown in Figure 55. Specimen B107 exhibited relatively little energy dissipation during the first cycle, with decreasing dissipation as indicated by the areas within the stressstrain ellipses. This behaviour was typical of all test specimens cycled with maximum stresses below the HCFS. Specimen B103 exhibited significant energy dissipation during the first cycle, with rapidly

110

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis decreasing dissipation thereafter until the plateau. This behaviour was typical for all test specimens cycled with maximum stresses above the HCFS. The small areas of stressstrain ellipses shows there is very little viscous effects or creep throughout the duration of cycling, except for the first cycle for the higher max test specimens. There is however notable strain ratcheting as illustrated in the plots of Figure 55, which confirms that strain ratcheting is in fact mainly due to damage development. This is due to the fact that the developed crack faces do not close perfectly upon unloading, causing the apparent strain ratcheting behaviour [71, 182]. As was illustrated in Figure 52 and confirmed in the plots of Figure 55, the majority of ratcheting occurs during the initial few loading cycles.

To further confirm that there is negligible timedependent behaviour exhibited during cyclic loading, consider the plots of stresstime and straintime shown in Figure 56. When a material that exhibits timedependent or viscoelastic stressstrain behaviour is cyclically loaded with a sinusoidal waveform, a phase lag occurs in time between the stress and the strain [73]. There is no such lag shown in Figure 56 after approximately 175,000 loading cycles, which was the case for all maximum applied stress levels for the duration of cycling. Thus, this further confirms that the energy dissipated by the material during cyclic loading is mainly due to the development of fatigue damage.

5.1.3.3 Damage characterization A microscopic investigation was conducted to track the development of damage during cyclic loading and to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the exhibited material behaviour and ultimately failure. To this effect, a series of tests were conducted at each maximum applied stress to characterize the damage evolution in the material. This involved extracting edge replicas and IR thermographs, post mortem SEM observations, and analysis of the fracture surfaces for the test specimens cycled to failure. The corresponding results for the microscopic investigation will now be presented. Figure 57 shows a series of images of the extracted edge replicas for a test specimen cycled with a maximum stress of 235 MPa, which were taken using an optical microscope with 60X magnification. These tests were paused at various predetermined cyclic intervals to extract the replicas during a zeroload dwell, after which cyclic loading resumed (see Section 4.4). During the early stages of cycling, throughtheyarnthickness braider yarn cracks were the main modes of damage uniformly distributed throughout the specimen edge. As cyclic loading progressed, the number of braider yarn cracks continuously increased. Note that the braider yarn cracks propagated at the fibermatrix interfaces within the braider yarns. Localized matrix cracks and localized braider yarn interface cracks were also observed, but there were few in comparison to the number of braider yarn cracks. The braider yarn crack density eventually 112

Strain (%)

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis reached a saturation state, after which the existing and newly initiated interface cracks between adjacent braider yarns and around the 0 yarn peripheries grew in length. The cracks around the 0 yarns propagated in the loading direction along the yarn axes, while the interface cracks between adjacent braider yarns propagated in a plane in both the loading direction and the direction perpendicular to loading. The majority of the interface cracks initiated at the braider yarn crack tips due to the localized high stress field at the crack tips (e.g., see Figure 57 (c)). Few cracks developed in the 0 yarns throughout most of cycling. During the latter stages of cycling, the interface cracks grew significantly in length and interacted with one another and with the braider yarn cracks as shown in Figure 57 (e)  this was significant by 500,000 loading cycles. Figure 58 presents axial and crosssectional photomicrographs obtained using SEM for the same test specimen after cycling for 107 loading cycles without failure. The images confirm that the majority of damage is cracking within the braider yarns, even after 107 loading cycles. The propagation of the 0 yarn periphery cracks along the yarn axes and around the yarn cross section is also illustrated in the photomicrographs of Figure 58. The long yarn interface cracks and the notable interactions between the various observed damage modes are confirmed by the SEM photomicrographs. The progression of damage for all the specimens cycled with maximum stresses below the HCFS was similar to that described in the previous paragraph, however the damage progression rate increases at higher stress levels. An image of an edge replica and the sectioned cross section for specimen B201 cycled at 195 MPa for 3.5M cycles without failure are shown in Figure 59. Comparison of Figure 57 (e) and Figure 59 (a) show that after a comparable number of cycles, the specimen cycled with a lower stress exhibits notably less damage. In fact, specimen B201 (195 MPa) does not contain very long yarn interface cracks after 3.5M cycles, which was observed for specimen B107 (235 MPa) after the same number of loading cycles. The growth of the interface cracks for specimen B201 was delayed due to the lower applied stress field. The number of braider yarn cracks is comparable for both specimens. Braider yarn cracks were evenly distributed throughout the specimen width and length, and were the main observed damage mode.

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis Figure 60 shows a series of images of the extracted edge replicas for a test specimen cycled with a maximum stress of 275 MPa, which were taken using an optical microscope with 60X magnification. During the early stages of cycling, braider yarn cracks were the main modes of damage uniformly distributed throughout the specimen edge. As cyclic loading progressed, the number of braider yarn cracks increased reaching a saturation state very early during cycling (see Figure 60 (b)). Localized braider yarn interface cracks were also observed much earlier and in greater quantity, but there were fewer in comparison to the number of braider yarn cracks as was found with the lower stress level specimens. The existing and newly initiated interface cracks between adjacent braider yarns and around the 0 yarn peripheries grew in length after braider yarn crack saturation. Few cracks in the 0 yarns developed throughout most of cycling, even up to failure. During the latter stages of cycling prior to specimen failure, the interface cracks grew to be very long and significantly interacted with one another and with the braider yarn cracks as is evident in Figure 60 (d). SEM photomicrographs of the same test specimen sectioned after failure are included in Figure 61, which confirm the observations made from the edge replicas. It should be noted that the damage state observed at the fracture surface consisted of more interface cracks. These cracks were also 'wider' in appearance which is attributed to the outofplane deformation of the fiber yarns at the fracture surface, and is evident in Figure 61 (c). The damage development in all specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses greater than the HCFS is analogous to this description.

The specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses below the HCFS had braider yarn crack densities of 3  6 cracks per yarn after saturation, as was observed by the edge replicas and the SEM photomicrographs. The specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses above the HCFS had slightly higher braider yarn crack densities of 47 cracks per yarn after saturation. The obtained edge replicas were also used to plot the evolving crack density profiles for the three main observed damage modes: braider yarn cracks, interface cracks and matrix cracks. Note that all the obtained edge replicas were extracted on the specimen edges near the specimen center. For the test specimens that were cycled to failure, the replicas were taken at

118

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis a distance of 50100 mm from the fracture surfaces. Two corresponding plots for specimens cycled with max of 195 MPa and 275 MPa are shown in Figure 62. Three equivalent size zones along the length of the specimen edge were used to determine the average crack densities. As mentioned, the number of braider yarn cracks is notably higher than the number of interface or matrix cracks for all specimens regardless of the maximum applied stress level. The braider yarn cracks reach saturation after approximately 70,000 cycles and 5,000 cycles for the 195 MPa and 275 MPa specimens, respectively. It is clear that there are more braider yarn cracks for the 275 MPa test specimen after saturation, which is attributed to the increased damage during the initial loading cycle (see Figure 46).

To further confirm the occurrence of braider yarn crack saturation, IRT was employed to monitor the surface temperature of the cyclically loaded test specimens and to visually capture thermal spikes caused by braider yarn cracking. To demonstrate the observations made using thermography, the results for a test specimen cycled at 275 MPa will be presented. A plot of the temperature profile for a location on the specimen surface within the central region of the gage section is shown in Figure 63; a data point was captured every cycle to generate the plot. The temperature profile follows a similar trend as the corresponding braider yarn crack density plot in Figure 62 (b). In fact, the saturation of the braider yarn cracks corresponds approximately to the same number of cycles that temperature 'stabilization' occurs. Note that

119

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis the temperature does not actually plateau, but gradually increases for the duration of cyclic loading after stabilization. This was found for each maximum applied stress level employed in this study for the braided composite test specimens. This confirms that braider yarn crack saturation occurs, and that the initial development of braider yarn cracks is mainly responsible for the initial temperature rise (i.e., heat dissipation). Note that local viscous matrix heating due to mechanical cycling will also contribute to the initial temperature rise [56]. A series of IR thermographs obtained of the same specimen are shown in Figure 64; the images depict the temperature rise and not the absolute temperature. Beginning from the first few loading cycles, the hot spots are evident within the braider yarns whereas the surrounding matrix regions exhibited slightly lower temperatures. This was evident until approximately 1050 cycles, after which the matrix region temperatures were slightly higher than the temperatures within the braider yarns. This corresponds to the temperature stabilization point in Figure 63. After additional cycling, the braider yarns and the matrix regions had almost identical temperatures and a 'smeared' temperature hot zone existed as shown in Figure 64. This was likely due to the growth of the interface cracks and additional local viscous matrix heating. In addition, the widespread nature of damage was also confirmed by the IR thermographs for all maximum applied stresses.

Figure 64. Captured IR thermographs during indicated cycles for specimen B203 (275 MPa).

The edge replicas, IR thermographs and SEM results for all maximum applied stress levels revealed that similar to the static tests, braider yarn cracking was the dominant damage mechanism during the early stages of cycling. These cracks were distributed throughout all braider yarns across the sample width and thickness, and along the length of the samples. Most braider yarns contained multiple cracks for all maximum applied stress levels. The braider yarns, analogous to offaxis plies in a conventional laminate, are subjected to higher stresses and thus exhibit cracking during the early stages of cyclic loading. In addition, significantly more braider yarn interface cracks and matrixrichzone cracks were observed when compared to the static test specimens, although there were few interface cracks in comparison to the number of braider yarn cracks observed. For all maximum applied stress levels, braider yarn cracks initiated and propagated along the braider yarn axes during the first stage of cycling beginning from the first cycle, eventually reaching a saturation state after which the braider yarn crack density rate was more gradual. The rate of braider yarn crack development during this early stage of cycling increased as max increased, and saturation of the braider yarn cracks occurred after fewer cycles at higher stress levels. The vertical alignment of the braider yarn cracks (see Figure 57 and Figure 58) suggests that cracks propagate at the same rate at different locations throughout the thickness of the specimen. In addition, the rate of the braider yarn crack density during the second stage of cycling, after saturation, increased as the maximum applied stress increased. During the initial stages of cycling, a number of localized interface cracks developed 121

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis between adjacent braider yarns and at the braider yarn and 0° yarn interfaces. As indicated, these cracks typically initiated at the tip of braider yarn cracks as shown in Figure 58, which would be caused by the localized high stress fields at the braider yarn crack tips. Once braider yarn crack saturation was attained, these localized interface cracks began to propagate, becoming significantly longer and interacting with one another by the latter stages of cycling. The interface crack propagation rate was fairly gradual during the duration of cycling. This can be partially attributed to local shear deformation that occurred at the braider yarn interlace locations and at the braider yarn crack tips, and possibly due to the straightening tendency of the 0° yarns. This would cause interface cracks to propagate under higher localized shear stress fields. At lower stresses the interface cracks were allowed to grow much longer in length, while at higher stresses the interface cracks were shorter in length but reached critical lengths which caused specimen failure. For the specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses below the high cycle fatigue strength, there were very few 0 yarn cracks after a runout of 107 cycles, suggesting the majority of these cracks occur prior to failure. Interactions between interface cracks were minimal initially, gradually increasing as loading progressed, and more significant after millions of loading cycles. Up to a runout of 107 cycles, the accumulation of interface damage and the corresponding interaction of damage modes was not sufficient to cause specimen failure. For the specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses above the high cycle fatigue strength, a number of matrix and interface cracks developed during the very early stages of cycling due to a higher applied stress. During the latter stages of cycling, the number of interface and matrix cracks reached a high density which resulted in significant crack interactions. At this stage in cycling and at the eventual local fracture zone vicinity, the braider yarns and the matrix lost their load carrying capacity. Load was redistributed to the 0 yarns causing some splitting type cracks in these yarns. After only a few more loading cycles, the 0 yarn fibers began to break which eventually led to fracture of the fiber yarns and specimen failure. An image of the fracture surface for a 275 MPa fatigue test specimen is shown in Figure 65 (a). The fracture zone is slightly larger compared to the static test specimens, however, it is still fairly localized. The fracture line has propagated along the +60 and 60 braider yarn axes,

122

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis which resulted in fracture of the 0 fiber yarns, as well as some +60 and 60 fiber yarns. Although as mentioned there was slight indication of fiber rotation, there was no significant elongation prior to failure indicating brittlenatured fracture, which is clear in Figure 65 (a). The presence of some fiber pullout is revealed by the brushy appearance of the fracture surface and confirmed in Figure 65 (b) by the bare fibers, which is also characteristic of brittlenatured fracture. The degree of fiber pullout was however less than that observed for the static test specimens. Furthermore, there was some indication of largescale debonding and evidence of matrix fallout in the fracture region; however, the affected zone was very localized. Outof plane deformation caused by largescale debonding occurred during final fracture causing more interface and matrix cracking with a wider appearance in the crosssectional plane (see Figure 61 (c)). Inspection of the internal damage state at locations further from the fracture surface revealed no largescale debonding cracks, which confirms that largescale debonding occurred only at fracture. This suggests that the fatigued specimens developed more extensive accumulation of localized matrixdominated failures prior to fracture, which resulted in localized largescale debonding and slight fiber rotation during the final fracture event. Note that since the fracture surface is localized, these failure events occurred in the final few cycles instantaneously leading to failure, which explains why there was not much 0 yarn splitting or fiber rotation. The observed damage development occurred in three distinct stages including initial braider yarn crack growth up to saturation, gradual interface crack growth, and final rapid crack interaction and accumulation leading to fiber fracture and ultimately failure. complimentary details can be found in [180].

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis 5.1.3.4 General discussion: microscopicmacroscopic correlation The results for the room temperature fatigue tests presented in Sections 5.1.3.2 and 5.1.3.3 provided a characterization of the braided material on both macroscopic and microscopic scales, respectively. The following discussion will focus on the correlation between the microscopic damage characterization and the resulting material behaviour exhibited by the braided composite. The plots in Figure 47 illustrated a threestage stiffness degradation response for the test specimens cycled to failure, with an initial rapid drop in stiffness for all tested specimens regardless of the maximum applied stress. The corresponding microscopic damage characterization also revealed that damage progressed in three stages for all maximum applied stresses, where initially braider yarn cracks were the dominant damage mode, followed by growth of the fiber yarn interface cracks and gradual increase in braider yarn crack density, and finally rapid accumulation and interaction of all damage modes leading to failure. The evolving interface cracks and their interactions ultimately led to load redistribution and specimen failure during the latter stage of cycling, however the initial stage was dominated by the braider yarn crack development and partially by interface crack initiation. Braider yarn crack surfaces propagated along the braider yarns as mixed mode I and mode II cracks, while interface cracks at the braider yarn interfaces propagated along the yarn peripheries as mixed mode II and mode III cracks (See Figure 19 in Section 3.5). Figure 66 (a) and (b) show combined plots of the braider yarn crack density obtained from the edge replicas and the dynamic stiffness degradation for specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses of 195 MPa and 275 MPa, respectively. The saturation of the braider yarn cracks approximately corresponds to the initiation of the second stage of the stiffness degradation profile for all stress levels. Recall that interface cracks will also contribute to stiffness degradation. This shows that the braider yarn cracks are the main cause of rapid stiffness degradation during the initial stage of cycling, which was also confirmed by the IR thermographs and the temperaturecycle profiles. This is further demonstrated by the plots of the normalized stiffness and the braider yarn crack density shown in Figure 66 (c) and (d), which illustrate that the stiffness is directly proportional to the braider yarn crack density until braider yarn crack saturation occurs. This is a significant finding in this study. Note that each data point in the plots correspond to a specific loading cycle, whereby the 124

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis stiffness magnitude and the braider yarn crack density corresponding to the particular loading cycle are the data pairs in Figure 66 (c) and (d). Also note that the interface cracks partially contribute to the initial rapid stiffness degradation, but are not accounted for in the plots. The interface crack initiation during the early stage rapidly increases like the braider yarns, and thus the contribution of the interface cracks to the stiffness degradation is constant during this phase which is another reason why the slope is linear up until braider yarn crack saturation. Beyond braider yarn crack saturation, stiffness degradation continues, but there is a more gradual increase in the braider yarn crack density. This implies that different mechanisms (i.e., fiber yarn interface crack growth) are also responsible for the additional stiffness degradation exhibited during stage II of cycling. This may be more the case for lower stresses, but less of a factor for higher stresses. To elaborate, consider the presented plots in Figure 66 (c) and (d) for specimens B201 and B103 cycled at 195 MPa and 275 MPa, respectively. For specimen B201 the stiffnesscrack density data points significantly deviate from the data regression line shown on the plot after braider yarn crack saturation, while for specimen B103 there is notably less deviation from the regression line. In fact as the maximum applied stress increases, this deviation decreases. This is due to the fact that at higher stresses the braider yarn crack density rate is higher during the second stage of cycling, thus contributing more to the stiffness degradation, while at lower stresses the interface crack growth contributes more to the stiffness degradation during the second loading stage.

Consider the growth of fiber yarn interface cracks during stage I and stage II of cyclic loading. Combined plots of the normalized stiffness profiles and 0 yarn interface crack average length profiles for specimens cycled with maximum stresses of 195 MPa and 275 MPa are shown in Figure 67 (a) and (b), respectively. The interface crack lengths have notable growth rates during the initial stages of cycling, which confirms that the interface cracks contribute somewhat to stiffness degradation during the initial stage of cycling. Note that since the interface crack density is much lower compared to the braider yarn crack density as shown in Figure 62, the contribution of the interface cracks to stiffness degradation during the initial cycling stage is notably less compared to that of the braider yarn cracks. Plots of the normalized stiffness as functions of the 0 yarn interface crack average lengths are shown respectively in

126

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis Figure 67 (c) and (d) for the same test specimens. In order to determine the average crack lengths, a number of similar length 0 yarn interface cracks were monitored for each acquired edge replica. The length of these sets of cracks were averaged for each replica, which corresponded to a particular loading cycle. The average crack lengths were then plotted against the corresponding normalized stiffness for the specific loading cycle, which make up the data pairs in the plots of Figure 67 (c) and (d). For the specimens cycled with maximum stresses below the HCFS, during the initial stage of cycling prior to braider yarn crack saturation, the interface crack growth rate is proportional to the stiffness degradation with a much steeper slope. If the development of the braider yarn cracks during the first stage of cycling is considered, the stiffness degradation is clearly not solely due to the interface crack growth during this stage. After braider yarn crack saturation, the stiffness degradation is also directly proportional to the average crack length with a more gradual slope. This suggests that the interface crack growth causes a more gradual reduction in stiffness degradation, which is confirmed by recalling the limited braider yarn crack development during this stage in cycling for the lower stressed specimens. Also, damage development during this stage of cycling caused a gradual increase in temperature (see Figure 63), which further confirms that the propagation of the interface cracks causes gradual stiffness degradation. For the specimens cycled with maximum stresses greater than the HCFS, the stiffness degradation is directly proportional to the average crack length for the duration of cycling as shown in Figure 67 (d). The notable difference is due to the fact that the higher stressed specimens continue to exhibit significantly more braider yarn crack growth after the saturation state, which has significantly more influence on stiffness degradation compared to the interface crack growth. Therefore, interface crack growth and the corresponding crack interactions are the main causes of stiffness degradation during the second stage of cycling for the lower stress specimens, while continued braider yarn crack growth mainly contributes to stiffness degradation during the second stage of cycling for the higher stress specimens. This was also clear from the plot in Figure 66 (d). Recall that the stiffness degradation rate during the second stage was notably higher in magnitude for the specimens cycled at stress levels greater than the HCFS, which ultimately caused these specimens to fail. There was clearly advanced damage progression during the

127

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis second stage of cycling for the specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses greater than the HCFS. Also recall that the braider yarn density was higher for the specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses greater than the HCFS (see Figure 62), and continued to increase at a higher rate after saturation. This is the main cause of the higher magnitude stiffness degradation rate during the second stage of cycling, which ultimately led to failure.

Regarding the exhibited energy dissipation behaviour, it was shown that regardless of the maximum applied stress level the energy dissipated per cycle (Ed) was highest during the first few loading cycles. The magnitude of Ed rapidly dropped and reached a plateau for the majority

128

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis of cyclic loading. In fact for each applied stress level, the number of cycles required to reach the energy dissipation plateau corresponds to the number of cycles in which braider yarn cracks saturation occurs. This further confirms that the initial high Ed is due mainly to braider yarn crack development. For all maximum applied stresses the braider yarn crack density rate became progressively lower as the number of cycles increases, up to the saturation state. This would result in the specimen having the highest energy dissipation during the initial few loading cycles, after which Ed rapidly drops as the braider yarn crack density rate drops approaching the saturation state. This can in fact be partially attributed to the characteristics of the matrix which exhibits high thermal stability due to a highly crosslinked molecular structure, which would therefore limit any selfgenerated viscous heating. IR images obtained at various cyclic intervals for all cyclic tests revealed that the temperatures in the braider yarns were consistently higher when compared to the resinrich zones. Also, as the maximum stress increased, the energy dissipation level during the plateau increased. At higher stresses the braider yarn crack density was higher due to the higher crack driving forces, thus resulting in higher energy dissipation during the second stage of cycling. Although local viscous matrix behaviour will cause some energy dissipation during cyclic loading, it was illustrated that this was minimal in comparison to the energy dissipated due to the observed cracks development and only exhibited during the early stage of cycling. Although the evolution of Ed during cyclic loading is analogous to that exhibited by metals that strain harden during fatigue [96], the braided composite material exhibited stiffness degradation. As indicated, the initial high magnitude of energy dissipation was mainly due to crack development. The dissipated energy progressively decreased as the braider yarn crack saturation point was reached since the braider yarn crack development rate also progressively decreased, after which Ed remained constant. This is the cause of the exhibited Ed evolution shown in Figure 53. Regarding the exhibited strain ratcheting behaviour, as was shown in Figure 52 the majority of strain ratcheting occurs during the first stage of loading for all applied stress levels. Since the rapid increase in the braider yarn crack density occurs during this cyclic loading stage, the strain ratcheting was mainly due to crack development (recall that this was due to the fact that the crack faces do not close perfectly upon unloading). In fact, during the conducted tests

129

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis that were paused to extract edge replicas for damage monitoring, there was virtually no recovery during the zeroload dwell. Even short dwells were shown to display some sort of recovery for materials that exhibit some degree of viscoelastic behaviour [20]. This further confirms that any strain ratcheting due to creep was minimal throughout cycling.

5.2 Elevated Temperature Results
5.2.1 Completed Test Overview

Similar to the room temperature tests, the main initiatives for the elevated temperature tests were to determine the material properties, develop a fatigue SN curve, characterize the development of damage during both quasistatic and cyclic tensile loading, and to relate the observed microscopic damage mechanisms to the exhibited macroscopic material behaviour at the constant ambient test temperature of (Tg, wet  28)C. In total seven ultimate static tensile tests were conducted. For the tensiontension fatigue tests, a minimum of five tests were conducted at each maximum applied stress level. ER and IRT were employed for a number of fatigue tests at each maximum applied stress level, while FBG sensors were also employed for one test at each stress level. Also, two tests were conducted to determine the braided composite HCFS using Risitano's thermographic method.
5.2.2 Static Results

The results of the elevated temperature static tests conducted at a temperature of (Tg, wet  28)C as outlined in Section 4.5 will be presented. Initially the material stressstrain behaviour and static properties will be presented, followed by a detailed characterization of damage and analysis of the fracture surface. Comparisons to the room temperature results will be made and discussed throughout the section. 5.2.2.1 Material behaviour A typical stressstrain plot for an ultimate static test is shown in Figure 68 (a), while in Figure 68 (b) room temperature and elevated temperature stressstrain plots are combined for comparison. Contrary to the room temperature tests, at the elevated test temperature the material exhibits a linear stressstrain response to failure. The average ultimate tensile stress

130

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis (UTS) was 369 MPa, which corresponds to 94% of the average room temperature UTS, and the average failure strain was 1.24%. The axial modulus (E11) of the braided composite at the elevated temperature was found to be 30.10 GPa, which corresponds to 97% of the room temperature modulus. The main material parameters for each tested specimen are summarized in Table 9, with the average values also included. As shown, the scatter in the data is negligible with less than 2% deviation from the average values. The elevated test temperature only has a slight influence on the composite strength and modulus. Although a similar study on a triaxial braided material is not available in the open literature, the study by Shimokawa et al. [5] on carbon fiber/BMI quasiisotropic laminates also revealed that the material properties were only slightly degraded at elevated temperatures.

The static tests that generated the results shown in Table 9 were conducted in displacement control with a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min. Two additional static tests were conducted at different crosshead speeds to examine the potential ratedependent behaviour of the material. The results of these tests are summarized in Table 10, with the corresponding displacement rate indicated. Although the higher and lower displacement rates resulted in slightly higher and slightly lower modulus values, respectively, the deviation of the material properties are less than 5% and considered to be within the scatter of the data. Thus, the

5.2.2.2 Damage Characterization A microscopic investigation was conducted to track the development of damage from crack initiation up until final specimen failure, as well as to determine the cause of the exhibited stressstrain behaviour. To assist with the detection of damage development, FBG sensors and IRT were employed. In addition, post mortem SEM and an analysis of the fracture surface was conducted to determine the final failure mechanisms. Similar to the room temperature static tests, the specimens that were furnished with FBG sensors were analyzed to determine the degree of sensor chirping. Figure 69 illustrates a plot of the FBG sensor wavelengthtime profile for the duration of the static test. The wavelength value is linearly rising as shown, without any chirping for the duration of the test until specimen failure. This indicates that there was no major damage event or critical damage state as was shown for the room temperature specimens (see Figure 32). Since the slope of the elevated temperature stressstrain curve is similar to the slope of the initial portion of the room temperature stressstrain curve (i.e., prior to transition), it can be concluded that the braider yarns are in fact fully effective until failure

132

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis for the elevated temperature tests. This suggests that the braider yarn crack density is significantly lower during the elevated temperature static tests, which will be confirmed subsequently. Analysis of the obtained IR thermographs for the elevated temperature static tests, analogous to those presented Figure 38, revealed that there was minimal braider yarn cracking for the duration of loading. Crack development, or temperature hot spots, were observed in the thermographs just prior to specimen failure and only at the fracture surface location. This further proves that braider yarn cracking was minimal and less influential for the duration of loading.

In order to confirm the damage state after specimen fracture, two static test specimens were sectioned both at the fracture surface and 75 mm from the fracture surface for inspection. SEM photomicrographs of the crosssectional samples 75 mm from the fracture surface are shown in Figure 70 (a) and (b), while similar photomicrographs for the cross sectional samples at the fracture surface are shown in Figure 70 (c) and (d). The images confirm that there is little damage throughout the specimen, at locations both near and further from the fracture surface. The damage that was observed consisted of braider yarn cracks and local braider yarn damage as shown in the photomicrographs. As was observed for the room temperature specimens, all braider yarn cracks propagated at the fibermatrix interfaces. An image of the fracture surface for specimen B301 is shown in Figure 71 (a). The area affected by the fracture is very localized as shown. The fracture line has propagated along the +60 braider

133

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis yarn axis as was the case for the room temperature specimens, which resulted in fracture of the 0 and 60 fiber yarns. The material stressstrain behaviour revealed that there was no elongation prior to failure indicating brittlenatured fracture, which is clear in Figure 71 (a). The presence of some fiber pullout is revealed by the slight brushy appearance of the fracture surface and confirmed in Figure 71 (c) by the bare fibers, which is a characteristic of brittle fracture. Furthermore, there was little indication of largescale debonding and evidence of localized matrix fallout in the fracture region which is also a characteristic of brittlenatured fracture. A closer inspection of the 0 yarns and the braider yarns at the fracture surface reveals that there are notably fewer braider yarn cracks and less splitting in the 0 yarns (see Figure 71 (b)) compared to the room temperature specimens. Prior to failure, few braider yarn cracks formed near the eventual fracture zone, however, local fiber breakage and matrix cracking developed in and around these yarns instantly. At this stage the 0 yarns were already loaded to their limit, which resulted in some localized splitting and further weakening of these yarns. This subsequently led to instantaneous fracture of the 0 yarns and ultimately specimen failure. Note that there was very little evidence of localized fiber yarn rotation at the fracture surface as is evident in Figure 71 (a). As indicated previously, the obtained IR thermographs confirmed that the fracture zone was in fact localized and was preceded by localized damage development (i.e., local high temperature hot spots). It is clear that the exhibited stressstrain behaviour is not dominated by damage mechanisms in the braider yarns, as was demonstrated for the room temperature specimens. The elevated test temperature is mitigating the initiation and propagation of braider yarn cracks for the duration of static loading, which is the cause of the variation in the stressstrain behaviour at the different test temperatures. This may be a result of the polymer resin material fracture properties at the elevated test temperature, and the influence of the temperature dependent resin modulus (i.e., softening) on the braided fiber local deformation behaviour. Although it was shown that the braided composite material does not exhibit any time dependent or ratedependent behaviour at the elevated test temperature, the polymer resin undoubtedly exhibits some degree of change in stressstrain behaviour [73]. A plot of the storage modulus for the thermosetting polymer resin as a function of temperature is shown in

134

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis Figure 72. The plotted data was obtained from various samples of the resin using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) [183]. It is clear from the plot that the resin undergoes notable softening at the indicated temperature of (Tg,

reduction of the storage modulus. Although the modulus of the braided composite material only reduced by 3% at the elevated test temperature, softening of the resin has a greater impact on the mechanically induced damage development.

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis Static testing of crossply and quasiisotropic carbon fiber/BMI laminates by Kobayashi and Takeda [184] revealed that matrix crack growth rates and crack densities were significantly lower at elevated temperatures. It was also revealed that at elevated test temperatures, local matrix deformation was observed. This suggests that the braided composites may be exhibiting a similar toughening mechanism at elevated temperatures due to the softening matrix, which as a result is slowing down the crack propagation rate and limiting crack initiation. The constraint of the fibers on the resin combined with increased local matrix 'ductility' may be alleviating the local stresses in the braider yarns which consequently may also be mitigating braider yarn crack development. A similar mechanism was reported by Gregory and Spearing [88] for a graphite/epoxy composite cyclically loaded at elevated temperatures. In order to further investigate this localized phenomenon, samples of the neat resin material were statically loaded until failure at both room temperature and (Tg, wet  28)C. The corresponding stressstrain plots for the neat resin were developed by Crochon [183] and are reproduced collectively in Figure 73. The plots reveal that at room temperature the neat resin exhibited linear stressstrain behaviour until failure. At the elevated test temperature, the neat resin exhibited slight nonlinearity with some elongation prior to fracture. In both cases, the fracture surface was perpendicular to the loading direction. A closer inspection of the fracture surfaces of the neat resin specimens reveals that the elevated temperature specimens undergo a more ductile fracture process. This was characterized by a smoother appearance of the resin at the local fracture zones, which is an indication of increased resin toughness. This suggests that the resin fracture toughness may have increased at the elevated test temperature. It should be noted that crosslinked thermosetting resins typically exhibit brittle fracture behaviour. However, the elevated test temperature, although lower than the Tg, may be still be alleviating some of the molecular crosslinking in the resin to a certain degree. This may therefore result in localized 'crazingtype' behaviour at the crack tips, which has been observed in thermosetting resins by Sue et al. [185] among others. This may be the mechanism causing increased fracture toughness of the polymer matrix and slower crack propagation rates, which would otherwise require higher driving forces for crack development. Also, this type of fracture behaviour may

137

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis be accompanied by local viscoelastic effects near the crack tips which would influence the crack propagation as well. As a result, the braided composite exhibits a greater resistance to cracking at the elevated test temperature due to the increased toughness of the resin and the potential changes in the load distribution between the fibers and the matrix caused by softening of the resin. Thus, cracks do not initiate at lower stresses during static loading, but are hindered until the stress reaches a threshold (i.e., critical crack initiation level is attained). At this threshold stress level, the cracks initiate and propagate quickly causing rapid development of local damage and instantaneous failure. This may explain the cause of the localized fracture region for the composite. An understanding of the presented matrix fracture and deformation behaviour will undoubtedly provide important microscopic information for analysis of the elevated temperature fatigue behaviour of the braided composite, which will be presented in the subsequent section.

5.2.3 Fatigue Results

The results of the elevated temperature fatigue tests outlined in Chapter 4.5 will now be presented. Initially the developed SN curve will be presented, followed by an overview of the exhibited material behaviour, a detailed characterization of damage development, and finally a discussion relating the microscopic damage observations with the exhibited material behaviour. Comparisons to the room temperature results will also be made throughout the section.

138

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis 5.2.3.1 SN data Fatigue tests were conducted for a number of maximum applied stresses within the range of 50%80% UTS until specimen failure occurred or until a predefined runoff was reached. The corresponding stresslife (SN) curve for the braided composite is shown in Figure 74 (a), where the average fatigue life values for each maximum applied stress are shown in the plot. A runoff of 5x106 cycles was defined for the elevated temperature tests, and is indicated on the plot for a stress level of 50% UTS, which did not amount to failure for a number of the test specimens cycled at that maximum applied stress. Note that some specimens cycled at 50% UTS failed before the runoff limit, although these were deemed gripinduced failures. A semilogarithmic relationship was also found to fit the elevated temperature SN data in Figure 74 (a). The corresponding relationship determined from a numerical regression analysis is also defined by Equation (43), with numerical coefficients of A = 0.1019 and b = 1.20. Data for the test samples that were cycled for 5x106 cycles without failure were not included in the regression. The data correlation factor, R2, of 0.9957 illustrates that the SN data has an excellent fit defined by the semilogarithmic relationship. The combined room temperature and elevated temperature SN curves are shown in Figure 74 (b). The elevated temperature environment resulted in a notable reduction in the fatigue lives at comparable applied maximum stresses. Although the elevated temperature did not significantly alter the static material properties, the fatigue lives are notably lower in comparison.

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis Recall that the room temperature fatigue data revealed the existence of a HCFS that was approximately equal to the bilinear static transition stress. The damage states associated with the various stress levels were distinct and correlated to the exhibited material behaviour. For the elevated temperature static tests, it was revealed that the material stressstrain behaviour was linear until failure. Thus, the existence of a HCFS at elevated temperatures may not necessarily exist even though some specimens cycled at 50% UTS did not fail after being cycled up to the defined runoff. To confirm the existence of a HCFS, Risitano's thermographic approach for rapidly determining the fatigue limit was also employed at the elevated test temperature. The tests were conducted using a loading frequency of 10 Hz, as discussed in Section 4.5. A similar procedure that was used to determine the room temperature HCFS was employed for the elevated temperature tests. A plot of the specimen surface temperature profiles for a specimen is shown in Figure 75 (a), while a plot of the stabilization temperature rise as a function of the applied stress is shown in Figure 75 (b). The maximum stress magnitude at which the dissipated heat rise becomes greater is clear in the characteristic bilinear plot. This corresponds to an approximate HCFS of 58% UTS (214 MPa), which is greater than the applied stress that resulted in no failure after a runoff as shown on the SN curve of Figure 74 (a). This confirms that a HCFS exists for the braided composite material at elevated temperature.

Once again, the established HCFS is a distinctive characteristic of the braided composite material under investigation. This is another significant contribution in terms of the application of the thermographic technique for determining the HCFS. Although the elevated temperature static tests did not reveal a transition to a more advanced damage state, the existence of a HCFS suggests that during cyclic loading the maximum applied stress level dictates whether or not failure will occur. An important observation was made by comparing the temperature profiles for the room temperature specimens (Figure 42) and the elevated temperature specimens (Figure 75)  the temperature rise for the elevated temperature tests is significantly lower. Consider for example the Tstab of the room temperature and elevated temperature specimens subjected to a maximum applied stress of 80% UTS, which were 12.7C and 5.1C respectively. The temperature rise for the room temperature specimens was approximately 2.5X greater than the elevated temperature specimens. This implies that the amount of dissipated energy is significantly lower at elevated temperatures, which is a result of reduced damage development. The softening of the polymer matrix at the elevated test temperature would cause additional local viscous energy dissipation, however the temperature rise is significantly lower. This proves that the energy dissipation, measured as dissipated heat by the IR camera, during the early stages of cycling for the elevated temperature specimens is mainly due to local viscous heating of the resin and partially due to damage initiation and propagation.

141

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis An investigation of the developing damage state for the elevated temperature specimens will be presented in Section 5.2.3.3. To further elaborate this point, consider the loadunload stress strain curves of the first loading cycle for specimens cycled at 258 MPa (70% UTS) and 185 MPa (50% UTS), as shown in Figure 76 (a) and (b) respectively. There is much less energy dissipation compared to the first loading cycle of the room temperature specimens (see Figure 46). If the damage state was similar at the two test temperatures, then the energy dissipation should be higher for the elevated temperature tests, which is clearly not the case. Thus, there must be less damage development at the elevated test temperature. In addition, there is notably less dissipation and strain ratcheting for the specimens cycled with a maximum applied stress of 185 MPa compared to the specimen cycled at 258 MPa. This suggests that there is an advanced damage state at the higher stress levels (i.e., max  HCFS) for the elevated temperature tests. This provides further support for the existence of a fatigue limit.

5.2.3.2 Material behaviour Plots of the normalized dynamic stiffness, E(n)/Eo, as a function of the number of loading cycles, n, for test specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses of 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% UTS (185, 221, 258, 295 MPa) are shown collectively in Figure 77 (a). Note that the dynamic stiffness, E(n), was normalized by the initial dynamic stiffness, Eo, for all plots. The same plots are included in Figure 77 (b), which only shows the initial 100,000 loading cycles. The elevated temperature specimens also exhibit a threestage stiffness degradation which is distinct from 142

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis the room temperature specimens. This is characterized by a gradual stiffness degradation during the first stage of cycling which is a linear function of the number of loading cycles, followed by a second stage in which the stiffness degradation becomes increasingly more gradual, and finally rapid stiffness degradation during the few cycles prior to failure (if applicable). For the specimens cycled to failure, the final rapid stiffness degradation occurs during the final few loading cycles as shown in the plot of Figure 78. There was also more stiffness degradation after a comparable number of cycles as the maximum applied stress increased, while for the specimens cycled to failure there was more stiffness degradation after failure as the maximum stress decreased. This is evident in Figure 78, and was also observed with the room temperature specimens. As shown in Figure 77, the stiffness for the 50% UTS specimens is constant during the initial stages of cycling prior to degradation initiation (in fact the stiffness appears to rise slightly). On the contrary, for all other specimens cycled with higher maximum stresses the stiffness began to reduce much earlier during cycling (instantly for the 80% UTS specimen). This further supports the fact that the specimens cycled with max  HCFS exhibit an advanced damage state. The stiffness degradation for the elevated temperature specimens is notably dissimilar from that exhibited by the room temperature specimens. Combined plots of stiffness degradation at both room and elevated temperatures for maximum applied stresses of 50% and 70% UTS are shown in Figure 79 (a) and (b), respectively. The relatively gradual stiffness degradation rate during the initial stage of cycling for the elevated temperature specimens is evident in the plots. Also, the stiffness degradation rate for the elevated temperature specimens eventually becomes steeper relative to the room temperature specimens as is shown in the plots, which is a result of the evolving fatigue damage development. The room temperature specimens experienced greater stiffness degradation after a comparable number of loading cycles, although the fatigue lives were notably higher. This will be discussed in greater detail in Section 5.2.3.3.

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis The stiffness degradation rate during the initial stage of cycling and the total average stiffness degradation rate also yielded qualitative information on the damage development rate during cyclic loading at the elevated test temperature. Plots of the firststage stiffness degradation rate (dE(n)/dn|1) and the total average stiffness degradation rate (Etotal/Nf) as functions of the maximum applied stress ratio (max/Su) are shown in Figure 80 (a) and (b), respectively. The stiffness degradation rates clearly increase with increasing maximum stress. A regression on the plotted data illustrates that a power law function is a suitable fit to the data, with R2 values close to 1 as shown in Figure 80. This is an important finding for the braided composite material, which implies that there is a mathematical relationship between the progressive damage state and the maximum applied stress at the elevated test temperature. A similar power law relationship was found for the room temperature specimens. Note that although the initial stiffness degradation rate for the room temperature specimens was significantly higher, the total average stiffness degradation rate for the elevated temperature specimens was notably higher which was a result of increased damage development during the second stage of cycling and the shorter fatigue lives. The result of Figure 80 (a) further suggests that knowledge of the stiffness degradation rate during the initial stage of cycling can be used to predict the fatigue life of the material, which is another important finding.

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis A plot of the measured mean strain, mean, as a function of the number of loading cycles, n, for test specimens cycled with the indicated maximum applied stresses are shown collectively in Figure 81 (a). The same plots are included in Figure 81 (b), which only shows the initial 100,000 loading cycles. The mean strain follows a threestage progression, characterized by a slight but rapid increase during the first stage, a gradual increase during the second stage which is for the majority of cycling, and a rapid increase prior to failure. The initial rise in the mean strain is significantly lower compared to the room temperature specimens for all stress levels, which suggests that there is little damage or strain ratcheting during the early stage of cycling at the elevated test temperature. Recall that for the room temperature tests there was significant damage and corresponding strain ratcheting during the early stages of cycling. It was also observed that the mean strain rate during the second stage of cycling increased as the maximum applied stress increased. A plot of the stage II mean strain rate as a function of the maximum stress is shown in Figure 82. Similar to the room temperature test specimens, a power law function was found to fit the data through a numerical regression with excellent correlation, as shown by the data correlation factor in Figure 82. The mean strain rate during the second stage of cycling is notably higher than the mean strain rate for the room temperature test specimens for all applied stresses. This implies that the elevated temperature specimens exhibit more damage development during the second stage of cycling, which is expected when observing the stiffness degradation plots in Figure 79. Another important observation is that the overall mean strain increases by a larger magnitude for the room temperature specimens, which corresponds to the larger exhibited stiffness degradation relative to the elevated temperature specimens. Figure 83 (a) and (b) show combined profiles of mean and  for test specimens cycled at 185 MPa and 258 MPa, respectively. For each maximum applied cyclic stress level, the mean strain rate was higher in magnitude than the strain range rate during the early stages of cycling, while for the duration of cycling the mean strain and strain range profiles evolved identically until specimen failure. This implies that during the early stages of cycling strain ratcheting occurs, however, ratcheting subsides afterwards and is negligible for the duration of cyclic loading. Recall similar strain ratcheting behaviour for the room temperature specimens. For

146

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis higher applied stress levels, the magnitude of initial strain ratcheting reduces to a negligible amount as shown in Figure 83 (b). The stiffness degradation plots of Figure 77 reveal that there is gradual stiffness degradation during the early stage of cycling for lower applied stresses. This suggests that the initially exhibited strain ratcheting is partially due to creep deformation (albeit minimal) for specimens with lower applied stress, while strain ratcheting that occurred for the duration of cycling is due mainly to damage development. This will be discussed further in Section 5.2.3.4.

Figure 83. Strain range and mean strain profiles for max of (a) 185 MPa, (b) 258 MPa.

A plot of the energy dissipation (Ed) for the indicated maximum stresses is shown on a semilogarithmic scale in Figure 84 (a). For all applied cyclic stress levels, the energy dissipated during the first loading cycle was slightly higher. During the subsequent loading cycles Ed rapidly decreased in magnitude until reaching a plateau, after which Ed was approximately constant or decreasing at a very gradual rate. The cyclic energy dissipation maintained this magnitude for the majority of cyclic loading as shown. Figure 84 (b) shows similar plots on a linear scale for specimens cycled with maximum stresses of 185 MPa and 258 MPa. For the specimens cycled to failure, the dissipated energy increased slightly during the cycles prior to failure. The evolution of Ed implies that the onset of damage and/or the potential local viscous matrix behaviour during the first few loading cycles contributed to the initially higher dissipated energy exhibited by the test specimens. Recall that there was no stiffness degradation during the first stage of cycling for the 50% UTS specimens, while for the higher stress specimens the stiffness degradation was gradual. Also recall that strain ratcheting only occurred during the initial stage of cycling, the degree of which subsided as the maximum applied stress decreased. This suggests that the initial drop in Ed is due to in part by the slight creep deformation exhibited by the composite. The initial drop in energy dissipation for the 50% UTS specimens is significantly lower than the other specimens, which confirms that the degree of creep strain evolution is minimal. The initial drop in energy dissipation for the higher stress specimens is slightly higher, and can be attributed to crack initiation during the early stages of cycling for

148

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis these specimens. The Ed plateau was reached after comparable number of cycles for each stress levels, which further confirms that the energy dissipated during the initial few loading cycles was in part a result of minor creep behaviour. As cycling progressed, the dissipated energy reached a plateau since the degree of local viscous matrix behaviour began to subside. For the duration of cyclic loading, Ed remained fairly constant which implies that the local viscous effects and/or evolving damage attained a constant rate. For the specimens cycled to failure, the increase in Ed prior to fracture was due to the rapid accumulation of damage leading to the final failure event. Thus, the dominant mechanism contributing to the presented energy dissipation evolution is in fact fatigue damage development, as was the case for the room temperature specimens. The energy dissipation profiles are in fact analogous to those exhibited by the room temperature specimens. The main difference is that the initial rapid drop in Ed is significantly lower for all specimens cycled at elevated temperature, which is due to the more gradual damage progression during the initial stages of cycling. The magnitude of Ed during the second stage of cycling for each applied stress for the elevated temperature specimens is higher in magnitude compared to the room temperature specimens. This was a result of increased damage development during the second stage of cycling.

Plots of successive stressstrain curves for the indicated cycles during the early stages of cycling for specimens loaded at 185 MPa and 258 MPa maximum applied stresses are shown in Figure 86. Specimen B402 exhibited little energy dissipation during the first cycle, with slightly decreasing dissipation as indicated by the areas within the stressstrain ellipses. This behaviour was typical of all test specimens cycled with max  HCFS. Specimen B412 exhibited more energy dissipation during the first cycle, with rapidly decreasing dissipation thereafter until the plateau. This behaviour was typical for all test specimens cycled with max  HCFS. In general, the small areas of stressstrain ellipses shows there is very little viscous effects or creep throughout the duration of cycling, even for the first cycle. There in fact was no lag between the stress and strain, as was similarly shown for the room temperature specimens (see Figure 56). There is little strain ratcheting for all maximum stress levels as illustrated in the plots of Figure 86, which confirms that strain ratcheting is in fact mainly due to the gradual damage development. As was illustrated in Figure 83 and confirmed in the plots of Figure 86, the majority of ratcheting occurs during the initial few loading cycles. The degree of ratcheting is notably less relative to the room temperature specimens, which again is due to the more gradual damage development during cycling.

5.2.3.3 Damage characterization A microscopic investigation was conducted to track the development of damage during cyclic loading and to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the exhibited material behaviour and ultimately failure. To this effect, a series of tests were conducted at each maximum applied stress to characterize the damage evolution in the material. This involved extracting edge replicas and IR thermographs, post mortem SEM observations, and analysis of the fracture surfaces for the test specimens cycled to failure. The corresponding results for the microscopic investigation will now be presented. In order to use the same edge replication technique for extracting the edge replicas, the elevated temperature test specimens were gradually cooled to room temperature over a three hour period while the test frame was in a loadcontrolled zeroload dwell. Once the replicas were extracted, the environmental chamber was gradually reheated and the test specimen was allowed to condition at the test temperature as discussed in Section 4.4. A sequence of images of edge replicas extracted from a specimen cycled with a maximum stress of 185 MPa are shown in Figure 87. During the early stages of cycling, the only damage mode observed was braider yarn cracking as shown in Figure 87 (a). At this stage, the braider yarn crack density was relatively low and there were no yarn interface cracks observed. As cyclic loading progressed the number of braider yarn cracks increased at a consistent rate, while localized matrix cracks and braider yarn interface cracks were also observed as shown in Figure 87 (b). There were few 151

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis interface and matrix cracks in comparison to the number of braider yarn cracks observed at this stage. Unlike the room temperature specimens, the braider yarn crack density did not reach a saturation state, but continued to increase throughout cycling with a relatively gradual rate. The interface cracks eventually began to increase in length after 106 loading cycles, while the braider yarn crack density continued to increase as shown in Figure 87 (c). Much later during cycling, the interface cracks around the 0 and braider yarns were notably longer and crack interaction was significantly higher as shown in Figure 87 (d). The cracks around the 0 yarns propagated in the loading direction along the yarn axes. The interface cracks between adjacent braider yarns propagated in a plane in both the loading direction and the direction perpendicular to loading. The majority of the interface cracks initiated at the braider yarn crack tips due to the localized high stress field at the crack tips (e.g., see Figure 87 (c) and (d)). Few cracks developed in the 0 yarns throughout most of cycling. Figure 88 presents crosssectional photomicrographs obtained using SEM for the same test specimen after cycling for 5x106 loading cycles without failure. The images confirm that the majority of damage is cracking in the braider yarns, even after 5x106 loading cycles. The propagation of the 0 yarn periphery cracks around the yarn crosssection is also illustrated in the photomicrographs of Figure 88 (a) and (b). The long yarn interface cracks and the notable interactions between the various observed damage modes are confirmed by the SEM photomicrographs. Note that the braider yarn cracks within the braider yarns and the yarn interface cracks propagated at the fibermatrix interfaces, as highlighted in Figure 88 (c). There was also evidence of matrix fallout near the crack faces as shown in Figure 88 (d). Although this was caused by post test sectioning of the specimens, this did not occur for any of the room temperature specimen SEM samples, which proves that there was deterioration of the fiber matrix interface strength and/or the local matrix properties due to the high temperature environment. A study by Cain et al. [186] illustrated that during room temperature fatigue testing of offaxis unidirectional laminates, cracking in the offaxis plies occurred at the fiber matrix interfaces. This was confirmed in another study on unidirectionalply laminates by Koyanagi et al. [187], which also illustrated that for elevated temperature fatigue tests cracking at the fibermatrix interface was accompanied by local matrix damage. It was however stated

152

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis that fibermatrix interface strength was not temperaturedependent in that study. A study by Montesano et al. [72] also found analogous differences in the fibermatrix interface crack behaviour in offaxis woven laminates cycled at room and elevated temperatures. For the braided composites it appears that a similar mechanism occurred, which has undoubtedly influenced the propagation rate of braider yarn cracking at the fibermatrix interfaces. This is in line with the observations of increased fracture surface ductility for the neat resin presented in Section 5.2.2.2.

A sequence of edge replicas extracted from a specimen cycled with a maximum stress of 258 MPa are shown in Figure 89. A notable increase in the braider yarn crack density occurs much earlier during the early stages of cycling as shown in Figure 89 (a). The braider yarn cracks are still the main damage mode observed, which was the case for all maximum applied stress levels. The braider yarn crack density increases at a faster rate consistently for the duration of cycling, while the yarn interface cracks begin to grow after fewer loading cycles. As the maximum stress increases, the interface crack lengths become longer much earlier in cycling. Interactions between braider yarn and yarn interface cracks also occurred much sooner. Figure 90 presents crosssectional photomicrographs obtained using SEM for the same test specimen

154

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis after cycling to failure. The observed damage modes were confirmed, as well as the observation that all cracks propagated at the fibermatrix interfaces (see Figure 90 (b)). At a crosssection near the fracture surface, the number of interface cracks and their respective lengths has increased and the interactions between cracks has also increased. The interface crack `widening' effect due to outofplane fiber yarn deformation at the fracture surface is evident in Figure 90 (c), which was also observed with the room temperature fatigue test specimens. In comparison to the specimens cycled at lower maximum applied stresses, the braider yarn crack density was lower and the number of interface cracks and their respective interaction was also lower after specimen failure. A similar observation was found for the room temperature specimens. This is attributed to the fact that at higher max, fewer cycles are required to reduce the residual strength to the level of the applied stress.

The obtained edge replicas were also used to plot the evolving crack density profiles for the three main observed damage modes: braider yarn cracks, interface cracks and matrix cracks. Two corresponding plots for specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses of 185 MPa and 258 MPa are shown in Figure 91. Three equivalent size zones along the length of the specimen edge were used to determine the average crack densities. For all maximum applied stress levels, the braider yarn crack density rate was gradual and the crack density was consistently rising for the duration of cycling. The crack density for each braider yarn was 23 cracks for all applied stress levels. The interface crack density rate was approximately constant for the duration of cycling, while the matrix crack density was relatively low and only slightly rising for all maximum applied stress levels. As mentioned, the number of braider yarn cracks

156

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis was notably higher than the number of interface or matrix cracks for all specimens regardless of the maximum applied stress level. The evolution of the braider yarn and yarn interface crack density rates were notably distinct from that observed for the room temperature specimens. Recall that for the room temperature specimens the braider yarn crack density rapidly increased initially up to a saturation state, after which the crack density increased with a more gradual rate. Combined plots of the braider yarn crack densities for specimens cycled with maximum stresses of 50% UTS and 70% UTS, at both room and elevated temperatures, are shown in Figure 92 (a) and (b), respectively. Recall that the 50% UTS specimens did not fail up to the runoff, while the 70% UTS specimens were cycled to failure. At the elevated test temperature the braider yarn crack development is more gradual during the early stages of cycling, but more consistent throughout cycling. The interface crack density also increases gradually, as does the interface crack length for the duration of cycling. Also, the crack density rate increases as the maximum applied stress increases.

IRT was also employed for some of the elevated temperature fatigue tests to monitor the surface temperature of the cyclically loaded test specimens and to visually capture thermal variations caused by cracking. To demonstrate the observations made using thermography, the results for a test specimen cycled at 221 MPa will be presented. A plot of the temperature profile for a location on the specimen surface within the central region of the gage section is shown in Figure 93; a data point was captured every cycle to generate the plot. The temperature profile follows a similar trend to that obtained for the room temperature specimens with a significantly lower temperature rise, which was found for all test specimens cycled at the elevated test temperature. This is a result of less damage development during the initial stage of cycling which limited the amount of heat dissipation from the specimen surfaces. This further suggests that the observed initial strain ratcheting caused by creep and viscous heating of the matrix due to mechanical cycling were the main contributors to the initial heat dissipation. In fact, the temperature profile reaches the secondary stage after approximately 20,000 loading cycles, which corresponds to the initiation of the plateau region in the energy dissipation profile. This further confirms that initial strain ratcheting behaviour is mainly due to creep and partially due to damage (albeit very little initial strain ratcheting was observed). During the secondary stage, the temperature profile slightly rises due to the development of damage.

158

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis The limitation of the heated environmental chamber prevented the IR camera from being too close to the specimen surface. Although the temperature rise during cycling was captured accurately, the thermograph resolution was limited to the pixel resolution of the camera, which at that distance from the specimen surface was not high. As a result, the resolution of the temperature variations between the braided fiber yarns and the matrixrich zones on the thermographs was not always clear (recall that the thermographs obtained for the room temperature specimens were clear). A number of the specimens tested did however yield satisfactory thermographs, including those presented in Figure 94 for specimen B410. Note that the presented images are maps of the temperature rise and not the absolute temperature, which are analogous to the thermographs in Figure 64. During the early stages of cycling, the temperature is 'smeared' over the entire surface and the resolution of the braider yarns is not clear. As the number of loading cycles reach approximately 20,000, the hot zones correspond to the braider yarns as seen in Figure 94. As loading progressed, the hot spots associated with the braider yarn cracks were consistently clear. The point in cycling after which the braider yarns were associated with the hot zones in the thermographs corresponds to the secondary stage of the temperature profile shown in Figure 93. This illustrates that the heat dissipated due to braider yarn cracking occurs after approximately 20,000 loading cycles, which also corresponds to the point in cycling after which the stiffness began to drop (see Figure 77 (b)). This proves that the stiffness began to degrade when the braider yarn crack density reached a critical point during cycling.

The edge replicas, IR thermographs and SEM results for all maximum applied stress levels revealed that braider yarn cracking was the dominant damage mechanism. Braider yarn cracks were distributed throughout most braider yarns across the sample width and thickness, and along the length of the samples. Many braider yarns contained multiple cracks for all maximum applied stress levels. Although braider yarn cracks rapidly developed during the early stages of cycling up to a saturation state for the room temperature specimens, the development was more gradual initially and more consistent throughout cycling for the elevated temperature specimens. The interface crack development was also notable, however there were few interface cracks in comparison to the number of braider yarn cracks observed. The braider yarn and yarn interface crack density rates increased as max increased. A number of localized interface cracks initiated later on during cycling and gradually developed between adjacent braider yarns and at the braider yarn and 0° yarn interfaces. As indicated, these cracks typically initiated at the tip of braider yarn cracks, which would be caused by the localized high stress fields at the braider yarn crack tips. Much later during cycling, these localized interface cracks began to propagate, becoming significantly longer and interacting with one another by the latter stages of cycling. This can be partially attributed to shear deformation which occurred at the braider yarn interlace locations and at the braider yarn crack tip locations, and possibly due to the straightening tendency of the 0° yarns, which would cause interface cracks to propagate under higher localized shear stress fields. Note that braider yarn crack growth, interface crack growth and crack interactions occurred earlier during cycling as the maximum applied stress increased. Although cracks propagated at the fibermatrix interfaces, there was evidence of a

160

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis weakened or 'softened' matrix and/or fibermatrix interface degradation as was evident in Figure 88, which have influenced the crack density and crack propagation rates. This is one of the main mechanisms that caused the variation in the crack development between the room and elevated temperature specimens. For the specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses below the high cycle fatigue strength (i.e., 50% UTS), there were very few 0 yarn cracks after a runout of 5x106 cycles, suggesting the majority of these cracks occur prior to failure. Interactions between interface cracks were minimal initially, gradually increasing as loading progressed, and more significant after millions of loading cycles. Up to a runout of 5x106 cycles, the accumulation of interface damage and the corresponding interaction of damage modes was not sufficient to cause specimen failure. For the higher stress specimens, the propagation of interface cracks and their interactions occurred much sooner during cycling. During the latter stages of cycling the number of interface and matrix cracks reached a high density in the vicinity of the eventual fracture zone, which resulted in significantly more crack interactions. At this stage in cycling at the fracture zone vicinity, the braider yarns and the matrix lost their load carrying capacity and the load was redistributed to the 0 yarns causing some splitting type cracks in these yarns. After only a few more loading cycles, the 0 yarn fibers began to break which led to rapid fracture of the fiber yarns and ultimately specimen failure. Note that there were fewer splitting type cracks in the 0 yarns compared to the room temperature fatigue specimens cycled to failure. A photograph of the fracture surface for specimen B403 (295 MPa, 80% UTS) is shown in Figure 95 (a). The fracture surface has similar characteristics as the room temperature fatigue specimens. The fracture zone is localized but larger than that of the static test specimens, the fracture line has propagated along both the +60 and 60 braider yarn axes, and fracture is brittle in nature as shown in Figure 95 (a). An IR thermograph of the fracture surface was captured during the final loading cycle and is shown in Figure 95 (b). The heat spikes associated with the fracture line propagation along the +60 and 60 braider yarn axes is clear. The presence of some fiber pullout is revealed by the brushy appearance of the fracture surface and confirmed by the observed bare fibers in the 0 yarns, which is also characteristic of brittle natured fracture. Note that there was notably less fiber pullout for the braider yarns, relative

161

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis to the room temperature specimens, as shown in Figure 95 (c). Furthermore, there was some indication of largescale debonding and evidence of matrix fallout in the fracture region; however, the affected zone was very localized. Outofplane deformation caused by largescale debonding occurred during final fracture causing more interface and matrix cracking with a wider appearance in the crosssectional plane (see Figure 90 (c)). Inspection of the internal damage state at locations further from the fracture surface revealed no largescale debonding cracks, which confirms that largescale debonding occurred only at fracture. This suggests that the fatigued specimens developed more extensive accumulation of localized matrixdominated failures prior to fracture, which resulted in localized largescale debonding. The observed damage development was notably distinct from the threestage development for the room temperature specimens. Braider yarn and yarn interface cracks developed more gradually throughout cycling until prior to fracture, at which point the final crack interaction and accumulation instantly led to failure.

5.2.3.4 General discussion: microscopicmacroscopic correlation The results for the elevated temperature fatigue tests presented in Sections 5.2.3.2 and 5.2.3.3 provided a characterization of the braided material on both macroscopic and

162

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis microscopic scales, respectively. The following discussion will focus on the correlation between the microscopic damage characterization and the resulting material behaviour exhibited by the braided composite. The stiffness degradation plots presented in Figure 77 illustrated that the stiffness degradation was more gradual and consistent throughout cycling. The corresponding microscopic damage characterization also revealed that damage progressed with a more gradual rate as shown in the braider yarn crack density profiles of Figure 91. Compared to the room temperature specimens, the initial damage development was significantly lower. This was confirmed by the specimen surface temperature profiles which resulted in a significantly lower temperature rise (or heat dissipation). However, the braider yarn cracks were found to be the dominant damage mechanisms throughout cycling. The evolving interface cracks and their interactions led to rapid specimen failure, but for the majority of cycling the braider yarn cracks were the main contributors to the exhibited stiffness degradation. The stiffness and crack density profiles in the plots of Figure 77 and Figure 91 evolved with similar rates and will now be analyzed. Figure 96 (a) and (b) show plots of the normalized stiffness as a function of the braider yarn crack density obtained from the edge replicas for specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses of 185 MPa (50% UTS) and 258 MPa (70% UTS), respectively. Unlike the room temperature specimens (see Figure 66), the braider yarn crack density is directly proportional to the stiffness degradation for the duration of cycling for all maximum applied stress levels. This shows that the braider yarn cracks are the main cause of stiffness degradation for the entire duration of cycling, which is another significant finding in this study. Recall that interface cracks will also contribute somewhat to stiffness degradation. Notice in the plots that initially the stiffness is approximately constant for a certain number of cycles; note that the number of cycles after which stiffness degradation begins decreases as max increases. This shows that for the braided composite at elevated temperature, the braider yarn crack density must reach a particular threshold before stiffness degradation occurs. This threshold braider yarn crack density was approximately 2.0 cracks/mm2 for all stress levels in this study, which occurred sooner during cycling at higher stresses due to the higher crack driving forces. This again is due to the increased resin toughness at elevated temperatures, which causes a reduction in the

163

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis crack density propagation rate due to local crack tip damping, causing more gradual stiffness degradation compared to the room temperature composite specimens. It should be noted that the observed cracks were consistently at the fibermatrix interfaces and that the fracture surfaces were similar in appearance to the room temperature specimens (i.e., brittle natured). However, the crack growth rates were mitigated due to the elevated temperatures and caused by local crack tip effects. The softening of the resin may also be limiting the stress concentrations within the braider yarns due to the altered local deformation behaviour and a change in the load distribution between the fibers and the matrix. This may be another mechanism causing a slower braider yarn crack density propagation rate and less braider yarn damage compared to the room temperature specimens. The interface crack density development was also gradual throughout the duration of cycling for the elevated temperature specimens. As shown in Figure 91, the interface crack density increases with approximately a constant rate, which is notably distinct from the room temperature specimens. In addition, the lengths of the interface cracks for the elevated temperature test specimens also increased with approximately a constant rate. Thus, the interface crack development rate consistently caused the same effect on the stiffness degradation rate of the specimen as already indicated. Consequently, the stiffness degradation was directly proportional to the braider yarn crack density in Figure 96 and not deviating from the main slope (as was shown for the room temperature specimens; see Figure 66). Since the interface crack density is significantly lower than the braider yarn crack density, it can be further assumed that the majority of the stiffness degradation was caused by the braider yarn cracks.

Regarding the exhibited energy dissipation behaviour, it was shown that regardless of the maximum applied stress level the energy dissipated per cycle (Ed) was highest during the first few loading cycles. The magnitude of Ed rapidly dropped and reached a plateau for the majority of cyclic loading, as was shown for the room temperature specimens. Note however that the initial drop in Ed was significantly lower compared to the room temperature specimens, which is a result of the limited quantity of damage that developed during the early stages of cycling at (Tg, wet  28)C. For the elevated temperature specimens, there was slight selfgenerated viscous heating which progressively decreased during the initial few cycles which contributed partially to the dissipated energy during that stage in cycling. Also, since the magnitude of the Ed plateau is higher for the elevated temperature specimens for all max, damage develops with a higher rate during this stage of cycling, which was in fact the case (see Figure 92). Although the dissipated energy profiles are similar for both the room and elevated temperature specimens, there are notable microscopic behavioural differences that cause the analogous Ed behaviour. Regarding the exhibited strain ratcheting behaviour, as was shown in Figure 83 slight strain ratcheting occurs during the first stage of loading for all applied stress levels. Since the crack development was gradually increasing during cycling, initial strain ratcheting was partially due to local viscous effects or creep. In fact, during the conducted tests that were paused to extract edge replicas for damage monitoring, there was virtually no recovery during the zero

165

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis load dwell as was the case for the room temperature tests. This further confirms that the strain ratcheting due to creep was minimal throughout the duration of cycling, even at the elevated test temperature.

5.3 Creep and Aging Results
5.3.1 Completed Test and Analysis Overview

Although not the focus of this study, a series of creep tests and aging experiments were conducted in order to further establish whether or not there were any potential time dependent or physical aging effects on the braided PMC material. These tests were conducted to provide some insight on the influence of the elevated temperature environment on the material behaviour; additional details on the creep behaviour of the braided composite can be found in [12]. One test specimen was aged for a duration of 48 hours at a constant ambient temperature of (Tg,
wet

+ 35)C, then subsequently loaded statically to failure at room

temperature. Four test specimens were utilized for creep testing at different applied stress levels at the constant ambient test temperature of (Tg, wet  28)C. In addition, both untested (i.e., virgin) and tested material samples containing fatigue damage were aged for various durations at (Tg, wet + 35)C, and subsequently inspected using SEM. These results will now be presented in the subsequent sections.
5.3.2 Creep Results

A total of four creep tests, each at a different constant stress level, were conducted at the elevated test temperature of (Tg,
wet

 28)C. The loadcontrolled tests consisted of

instantaneously applying the desired stress and subsequently holding the stress constant for the test duration. Since a stresscontrolled tensiontension fatigue test may exhibit creep deformation under the application of a positive mean stress, the mean stresses corresponding to the fatigue tests with max of 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% UTS were employed as the constant creep stresses. The creep stresses used were therefore 27.5%, 33.0%, 38.5% and 44.0% UTS (102, 122, 142, 162 MPa). Recall that the stress ratio for all elevated temperature fatigue tests was set to 0.1. Plots of straintime profiles for all four tests are shown collectively in Figure 97 for a time interval of 5 hours. Even at the highest constant stress, there is very little creep

166

5 Braided Material Test Results and Analysis strain. In fact, there is slight creep initially and no indication of creep after approximately 300 seconds. The creep strain is in fact only 0.01% in magnitude at the highest stress level. This confirms that the exhibited strain ratcheting observed during both the room temperature and elevated temperature fatigue tests was mainly due to fatigue damage accumulation, and that any creep effects can in fact be neglected.

5.3.3 Aging Results

The specimen that was aged for a duration of 48 hours at a constant ambient temperature of (Tg, wet + 35)C was statically tested to failure at room temperature. Note that the aging temperature is notably higher than the elevated test temperature used for the static and fatigue tests that were presented in Section 5.2. This was done in order to provide an extreme ambient condition for observation of the potential effects of aging on the material behaviour. The stressstrain plots for the static test of the aged specimen (B205) and the non aged specimen (B108) are shown in the plot of Figure 98. The stiffness of the composite increased slightly (0.8%), although it is within the scatter of the room temperature static data. The strength however decreased by 5%, which is likely due to the advanced crack propagation rate caused by the increased brittleness of the matrix due to aging [183]. The changes in the material properties caused by physical aging would have less of an impact at the temperature of (Tg, wet  28)C. Thus, the effects of physical aging can in fact be neglected.

To analyze the influence of aging on a material sample with and without damage, virgin material samples and samples containing fatigue damage were aged for 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours at (Tg, wet + 35)C, and subsequently inspected using SEM and an optical microscope. The samples containing fatigue damage were cut from test specimens that were cycled at room temperature at a low stress (50% UTS) for 3x106 cycles in order to generate a significant amount of damage. After aging, the sample edges and surfaces were inspected to determine whether there was any aging induced damage (or damage propagation). Also, some samples were sectioned in order to determine whether there was any aging induced damage within the sample interior. SEM photomicrographs of the surface of a nonaged virgin sample and a virgin sample aged for 48 hours are shown in Figure 99 (a) and (b), respectively. After 48 hours of aging, there was little aging induced damage, except for some local cracks along the fibermatrix interfaces on the sample surfaces as shown in Figure 99 (b). No cracks were observed on the specimen edges or within the specimen interior for all the aged samples, regardless of the aging time. SEM photomicrographs of the interior crosssection of samples containing fatigue damage that were nonaged and aged for 48 hours are shown in Figure 99 (c) and (d), respectively. Existing cracks did not propagate and new cracks did not form under aging conditions for all samples examined. The cracks surfaces were not observed to be altered by aging. The effects of aging on existing damage within the samples was found to be minimal, can therefore be neglected at the lower test temperature of (Tg, wet  28)C.

6 FATIGUE DAMAGE MODELING DETAILS
Details of the fatigue damage model development will be presented, along with an overview of the observed and measured damage mechanisms for the braided composite material. Comparisons of the model prediction results and the experimental data will also be shown. Some relevant test results for two onaxis woven laminate composites will also be analyzed in this chapter, with a relevant discussion pertaining to the applicability of the fatigue damage model. Finally, an overview focussed on the implementation of the developed fatigue damage model into a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) based constitutive model will be discussed.

6.1 Braided Composite Damage Development Discussion
The development of the fatigue damage model relied on quantitative measurements as well as qualitative observations from the experimental microscopic damage characterization of the braided composite material at both room and elevated temperatures. A relevant discussion regarding the damage observations for the room temperature fatigue tests will first be presented, followed by a similar discussion for the elevated temperature fatigue tests.
6.1.1 Room Temperature Fatigue Damage

Recall that the room temperature fatigue specimens exhibited a threestage stiffness degradation profile, where there was an initial rapid drop in stiffness as shown in Figure 47. The

170

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details development of damage also followed a similar trend as was presented in Figure 62. The stiffness degradation during the initial stage of cycling was then directly correlated to the braider yarn crack density, as was shown in Figure 66. During the initial stage of cycling, stiffness degradation was dominated by braider yarn cracking, however interface cracking did contribute somewhat to the initial rapid stiffness degradation. During the second stage of cycling, interface cracks contributed to gradual stiffness degradation for all applied stress levels, but braider yarn cracking was more dominant as the maximum applied stress increased. The degree of cracking within the matrixrich zones and within the 0 yarns was relatively minimal and considered negligible for the duration of cycling, and thus will be neglected in the model development. It was observed that the braider yarn and interface crack densities followed an increasing logarithmic profile as the number of loading cycles increased. This was due to the more gradual increase in braider yarn and interface crack densities after the braider yarn crack 'saturation' state. A combined plot of the braider yarn crack densities, by, as functions of the logarithm of the number of cycles, log(n), for four maximum applied stress levels is shown in Figure 100. The linear regression fit line is also shown for each indicated maximum applied stress in the plot, where the R2 correlation values are all between 0.91  0.96. A summary of the regression coefficients, a1, corresponding to the plots in Figure 100 are included in Table 11. By inspecting the regression coefficients, a linear correlation can in fact be made with max, which is illustrated in the plot of Figure 101 and defined by Equation (44). The braider yarn crack density can therefore be approximated by Equation (45) for any max. a1 = 0.0145 max 1.4783 by = a1 log(n) (44) (45)

A similar correlation between the regression coefficients, a2, which are summarized in Table 11, and max was made. This is illustrated in the plot of Figure 103, and defined by Equation (46). Thus, the interface yarn crack density can be approximated by Equation (47) for any max. a2 = 0.0009 max + 0.1695 int = a2 log(n) (46) (47)

Note that although the plots of the interface crack densities consider the number of cracks observed from the edge replicas, the increasing crack length is actually accounted for within the crack density measurements. Further details can be found within Appendix A.1.

6.1.2 Elevated Temperature Fatigue Damage

The elevated temperature fatigue specimens exhibited a notably different stiffness degradation profile compared to the room temperature test specimens as was presented in Figure 77. As a result, a notably different crack density propagation rate was observed as was shown in Figure 91, which was due to the altered matrix properties at the elevated test temperature. The stiffness degradation rate was gradual for the duration of the tests, and was also directly correlated with the braider yarn crack density progression for the test duration (see Figure 96). The braider yarn crack development was the dominant cause of stiffness degradation for the duration of cycling. Interface crack development was also fairly gradual throughout cycling and notably contributed to stiffness degradation during the latter stages of cycling. Recall that there were few interface cracks during the early stages of cycling. Similar to the room temperature specimens, the degree of cracking within the matrixrich zones and within the 0 yarns was relatively minimal and considered negligible, and thus will be neglected in the model development. Due to the fact that the braided composite was loaded in the warp direction, the material exhibited a fiberdominated stressstrain behaviour at the macroscopic level and was not significantly influenced by the elevated test temperature. However, the crack initiation and propagation rates were notably influenced by temperature due to local effects of the resin

174

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details material. This change in crack propagation or local damage development behaviour at elevated temperatures is manifested through the variation in the crack density profiles. It was observed that the braider yarn and interface crack density development was increasing such that a power law function could be used to represent the crack densities. This is not surprising due to the fact that the elevated temperature specimens exhibited a more gradual increase in crack density development compared to the room temperature specimens. A combined plot of the braider yarn crack densities, by, as functions of the number of loading cycles, n, for four maximum applied stress levels is shown in Figure 104. The power law function regression curves for each indicated maximum applied stress are also included with the plots, where the R2 correlation values are all between 0.96  0.99. A summary of the regression coefficients, a1 and a2, corresponding to the plots in Figure 104 are included in Table 12. By inspecting the regression coefficients, correlations can in fact be made with the maximum applied stress, which is illustrated in the plots of Figure 105 and defined by Equations (48.a) and (48.b). The braider yarn crack density can therefore be approximated by Equation (49) for any max. a1 = 0.00001499 max 2  0.0034 max + 0.1218 (48.a)

6.2 Analytical Fatigue Damage Model Development
As indicated in Section 3.7, fatigue damage models can be classified in one of three categories: models that do not account for actual degradation mechanisms, but use SN curves to define macroscopic strength criteria; residual strength/stiffness models; progressive damage models based on actual irreversible degradation mechanisms (e.g., matrix cracking, delamination, etc.). Analytical fatigue damage accumulation models are often based on residual stiffness measurements [139141], but can alternately be based on actual damage mechanisms [59, 155]. The model developed in this study is an analytical fatigue damage accumulation 177

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details model that is based on measurements of actual observed crack modes, thus, is classified under the third category of fatigue damage models as a damage mechanicsbased model. The data analysis on the crack density development presented in the previous section for the braided composite material will be employed within the definition of the analytical fatigue damage model. Analytical fatigue damage accumulation models are often defined in terms of the number of loading cycles (or the normalized number of cycles  n/Nf), and are typically fitted to a specific experimental stiffnessbased damage index [139]. These nonlinear damage models do not provide any consideration of the actual damage state of the material. Since many polymeric laminate composite materials exhibit a typical threestage stiffness degradation evolution, and thus a threestage damage degradation evolution (see Figure 17 in Section 3.5), these established damage accumulation models have been effectively employed for various unidirectional, crossply and quasiisotropic laminates. With the presumption that the material under investigation exhibits this typical threestage response, the damage accumulation models may be applicable. The braided material under investigation in this study did not exhibit a typical threestage response at the elevated test temperature, as it did during room temperature fatigue loading, due to the local influence of temperature on the crack propagation behaviour. This was further illustrated in the damage analysis that was presented in Section 6.1. As a result, a nonlinear fatigue damage accumulation model may not be applicable for braided composite materials (and perhaps other textile fabricreinforced polymeric composites). Since the development of different crack types was altered due to the elevated temperature environment, one modeling approach would be to break down the material degradation simulation into different materialdegradationcausing damage components (i.e., braider yarn cracks and interface cracks). This would provide a sound physical connection between the damage model and the actual damage states exhibited by the braided material. This is an important step since the evolution of damage and the corresponding prediction of effective material properties for braided composite materials containing damage is not well established in the literature. Therefore, a damage mechanicsbased analytical fatigue

178

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details damage accumulation model was developed in terms of braider yarn and interface crack density, which is applicable for the braided material at both room and elevated temperatures. The damage model is defined as a function of the observed braider yarn and interface crack densities, and as a consequence as a function of the maximum applied stress. Since it was observed that damage was evenly widespread throughout the test specimens, using the crack densities in the damage model is in fact an accurate representation of the material damage state. The analytical fatigue damage model is given by Equation (52). The accumulated damage,
D, is defined as the additive decomposition of the damage parameters d1 and d2, which

represent damage due to braider yarn cracking and damage due to interface cracking, respectively.
D = d1 + d2

(52)

The key is to define the damage parameters d1 and d2 in terms of the braider yarn (by) and interface (int) crack densities, respectively. Note that the model defined in Equation (52) can also include the effects of additional damage modes (i.e., d3, d4, etc.). The damage parameters in this study are defined by Equations (53.a) and (53.b).
d1 = 1 by1

(53.a) (53.b)

d2 = 2 int2

The braider yarn and interface crack densities were defined by Equations (45) and (47) for room temperature fatigue, and Equations (49) and (51) for elevated temperature fatigue. The scalar coefficients 1 and 2 are simply scaling parameters that are independent of stress, and in fact equal (i.e., 1 = 2 = ) for a particular test temperature. The scalar exponent coefficients 1 and 2 are functions of the maximum applied stress level, and vary with the test temperature. These coefficients do not greatly influence the magnitude of the accumulated damage, but slightly influence the rate of damage accumulation. A summary of the damage model scalar coefficients are presented in Table 13 and Table 14 for both room temperature and elevated temperature fatigue, respectively. As shown, the

179

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details exponent coefficients, 1 and 2, are similar in magnitude for all stress levels and for both temperatures. Upon further inspection, 1 and 2 are in fact linear functions of the maximum applied stress for both temperatures. For the data in Table 13, combined plots of the exponent coefficients are shown in Figure 108, while the linear correlations in terms of stress are defined by Equations (54.a) and (54.b). For the data in Table 14, combined plots of the exponent coefficients are shown in Figure 109, while the linear correlations in terms of stress are defined by Equations (55.a) and (55.b). 1 = 0.0021 max + 2.4178 2 = 0.0025 max + 2.3125 1 = 0.0046 max + 0.5152 2 = 0.0068 max + 3.7063

Therefore, the application of the fatigue damage accumulation model for the braided composite material subjected to any particular maximum applied stress level requires the calculation of the corresponding braider yarn and interface crack densities, as defined by Equations (44)(47) or Equations (48)(51), for each loading cycle (n). Next, the damage model scalar parameters defined by Equation (54) or Equation (55) must be determined for the applicable max. Finally, the damage accumulation for each loading cycle can be determined from Equation (52). Note that the fiberdominated braided composite did not exhibit significant

181

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details macroscopic material property changes due to the elevated test temperature. However, the effects of temperature were observed through the crack development and are therefore present in the damage model by the different functions that are used to define the crack density rates. The different crack propagation rates, and thus different progressive damage states, at the elevated test temperature caused the difference in the observed macroscopic fatigue behaviour. The application of the damage model for the braided composite material with comparisons to experimental data will be presented in the subsequent section.

6.3 Comparison with Braided Composite Experimental Data
In order to validate the predictive capabilities of the presented fatigue damage model, an experimentally obtained macroscopic damage index must first be defined. Although it is difficult to quantitatively define 'fatigue damage', monitoring the stiffness evolution during cyclic loading is often conducted. If the fundamental concepts of damage mechanics are considered, damage may be defined as follows [159]:
AD Ao

D=

(56)

where AD is the effective damaged area, and Ao is the total area of a representative element. The concept of effective stress (  ), as defined by Equation (57) [159], can be used to scale the actual nominal stress  with the damage, D. Then, employing the principle of strain equivalence [61] yields a stiffnessbased damage index which is defined by Equation (58). This is a suitable experimental damage index which will be used to correlate with the damage model predictions.
 1D

=

(57)

D = 1

E Eo

(58)

The experimental results show that the final stiffness when fracture occurs (Ef) is not zero, thus the damage index defined in Equation (58) ranges from 0 to 1Ef/Eo. It is sometimes convenient

182

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details to define an alternate form of the damage index, such that the accumulated damage ranges from 0 to 1. An example of a commonly employed damage index is defined by Equation (59). Eo  E Eo  E f

D=

(59)

In the following paragraphs, the predictions of the analytical damage model defined by Equation (52) will be compared to the experimental stiffnessbased damage index defined in Equation (58) for validation. Combined plots of the predicted accumulated damage and the experimental damage index are shown in Figure 110 (a)(d) for the braided composite material at room temperature subjected to the indicated max. The model correlates very well with the experimental data for all maximum applied stresses. The model captures the aforementioned initial rapid increase in damage development due to braider yarn cracking and local interface crack initiation during the first stage of cycling. The gradual development of damage after braider yarn crack saturation during the second stage of cycling is also well captured by the model. This is further elaborated by considering plots of the individual damage model terms d1 and d2, for the 70% UTS fatigue damage prediction as is shown in Figure 111. It is clear that the first damage parameter, d1, contributes to the majority of damage during the initial stage, while the second damage parameter, d2, contributes less. During the second stage, both d1 and d2 contribute to the overall damage accumulation. Recall that the scaling parameters, 1 and 2, were the same, thus the damage model is capturing the accurate development of the two main crack mechanisms  braider yarn and interface cracks. Similar plots for the braided composite at elevated temperature are shown in Figure 112 (a)(d), also with excellent correlation between the model predictions and the experimental data. The model captures the distinct damage development observed at the elevated test temperature. A plot of the individual damage model terms d1 and d2, for the 60% UTS fatigue damage prediction is shown in Figure 113. The first damage parameter contributes entirely to the damage accumulation during the early stages, while the gradual increase of the second parameter begins to contribute to the overall damage accumulation during the latter stages of

183

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details cycling. Again, the damage model is capturing the accurate development of the two main crack mechanisms  braider yarn and interface cracks.

The corresponding stiffness loss due to the observed damage was presented for both the room temperature and elevated temperature braided composite tests in Figure 47 and Figure 77, respectively. The stiffness degradation can be predicted by a number of analytical and numerical methods, including by defining a direct relationship between the crack density and the stiffness degradation [59]. The damage accumulation (D) predicted by the damage model can also be directly utilized to predict the stiffness degradation for the braided composite. One approach is to adopt the definition of Equation (58) and set the dynamic stiffness (E) equal to (1D)Eo, then use the damage accumulation values, D, predicted by the damage model to determine the evolving stiffness. This approach was employed in this study and will now be presented. Plots of the predicted and experimental normalized stiffness degradation for the indicated stress levels are shown in Figure 114 and Figure 115, for the room temperature and elevated temperature tests respectively. As illustrated in the plots, the correlation between the predicted stiffness degradation and the experimentally obtained stiffness degradation are excellent for all stress levels, and at both test temperatures. Consider the plots in Figure 114 (a) after 500,000 loading cycles, where the predicted normalized stiffness is 0.9170 and the experimental is 0.9173, yielding an error of 0.03%. After 3,000,000 loading cycles, the predicted stiffness is 0.892 while the experimental value is 0.9008, yielding an error of 1.0%. For the plots in Figure 115 (b) after 20,000 loading cycles, the predicted stiffness is 0.969 and the

186

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details experimental is 0.9793, yielding an error of 1.1%. The error between the predicted values and the experimental values is consistently low at less than 2%, which is deemed acceptable. Note that the final stage of rapid damage increase, and thus rapid stiffness decrease, prior to failure is not captured by the presented results. The braider yarn crack densities during the final stages of cycling were not extracted since it was difficult to time the extraction intervals of the edge replicas prior to failure. The presented model would however capture this final stage of stiffness degradation if the crack densities prior to failure were known and defined. Since this stage of cycling was found to be relatively brief for both room temperature and elevated temperature tests, the presented prediction results are deemed to be acceptable for the triaxial braided composite.

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details In addition to the presented analytical damage accumulation prediction model, a number of the aforementioned nonlinear analytical damage models based on stiffness degradation were also considered in this study. A model similar to that developed by Lemaitre and Plumtree [188] was modified and used for the braided composites. The damage accumulation parameter, D, is defined by Equation (60). The model material parameters, b1 and b2, were found to be functions of the maximum applied stress for the room temperature specimens, which was originally presented by Montesano et al. [189].

The results were promising for the room temperature specimens, but the model was not sufficient for the elevated temperature tests as will be presented here. Consider the tests conducted at both room temperature and elevated temperature with a maximum applied stress level of 70% UTS. Plots of the experimental damage index and the predicted accumulated damage using Equation (60) are shown in Figure 116 (a) and (b) for the room temperature and elevated temperature tests, respectively. The damage index used in Figure 116 was defined in Equation (59), and the damage parameters are plotted as functions of the normalized number of cycles. The model predictions were excellent for all room temperature test specimens as shown in Figure 116 (a). Since for the room temperature test specimens the damage development occurred in a more conventional threestage progression, the model faired well with similar accuracy to the damage accumulation model defined by Equation (52). For the elevated temperature test specimens, the model predictions were not as close to the experimental results as shown in Figure 116 (b). The errors were in access of 5% for some predictions points. Although the error is still quite low, the predictions of the damage model defined by Equation (52) were slightly better. In either case, the accuracy of the presented damage accumulation model in Equation (52) has been illustrated. Additional results for the damage model defined by Equation (60) can be found in [189].

6.4 Modeling Considerations for Woven Composites
Although the focus of this chapter is on the development and validation of the presented fatigue damage model for the braided composite, a discussion on the fatigue behaviour of two onaxis woven laminates will be presented. As was indicated, the braided composite did not exhibit notable viscoelastic behaviour at the macroscopic level, but local resin viscous behaviour was shown to influence the crack propagation rates. This may in fact be a characteristic of fiberdominated composites. To this end, an investigation into the onaxis fatigue behaviour of two fiberdominated composites will provide a relative comparison with the studied triaxial braided composite. This will facilitate the justification for the choice of the type of fatigue damage model developed, which may be suitable for other fiberdominated PMC materials. Two onaxis woven laminates were tested at both room temperature and elevated temperatures for relative comparison of the exhibited material behaviour and damage development with the braided composites. The first material studied was an 8HS woven carbon fiber reinforced bismaleimide laminate [14], while the second was a 4HS woven carbon fiber reinforced polyimide laminate [174]. A description of the respective composite laminate

189

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details constituents and the fiber geometries was presented in Section 4.1. Details of the exhibited fatigue behaviour of these woven laminates will be discussed here.
6.4.1 EightHarness Satin Woven/BMI Laminate

Results of the onaxis room temperature static and fatigue tests for the 8HS woven/BMI laminate were originally presented in [14]. Additional static and fatigue tests were conducted at elevated temperatures using the same experimental protocol described in Sections 4.3 and 4.4. The static and fatigue test procedures were similar to those presented in Section 4.5. The ultimate tensile static stressstrain plots for the two test temperatures are shown collectively in Figure 117. Like the braided composite, the stressstrain behaviour was linear at both test temperatures. The modulus reduced slightly from 70.2 GPa at room temperature to 69.1 GPa at 205C, which was only 1.6% lower. Also, the ultimate tensile strength only reduced by approximately 7% at the elevated test temperature. The fiberdominated material behaviour is evident from the ultimate static test results. A similar observation was reported for an 8HS woven carbon fiber/AMB21 laminate tested at both room temperature and 255C [91].

The uniaxial tensiontension fatigue tests presented here were conducted with a max of 65% UTS for both test temperatures. The stiffness results and damage observations for the conducted tests will now be presented and discussed. Both the room temperature and elevated temperature tests revealed that the material exhibited notable stiffness degradation, as is

190

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details shown in the normalized stiffness degradation plots of Figure 118. The room temperature specimens exhibited notably more stiffness degradation after a comparable number of cycles. For example, after 300,000 loading cycles the room temperature specimens showed a reduction in stiffness of 13.3%, while the stiffness reduction for the elevated temperature specimens was only 7.05%. The stiffness degradation rate was more gradual at elevated temperatures, which is evident by analyzing the plots in Figure 118. Similar to the braided composites, the 8HS woven/BMI laminates exhibit less stiffness degradation at elevated temperatures. It should be noted that for both room temperature and 205C specimens there was only minor strain ratcheting observed throughout the duration of each test. Moreover, the energy dissipated per unit volume (Ed) per cycle was fairly consistent throughout the duration of cycling regardless of the test temperature. This implies that damage accumulation is the main cause of energy dissipation, and that damage development is somewhat consistent throughout the duration of cycling. The main damage mechanisms observed for each test specimen via posttest SEM observations, regardless of test temperature, were throughthe yarnthickness cracks in the weft yarns and intraply yarn debonds [14]. Some local matrix cracks were also observed in the resinrich regions. Therefore, due to the differences in the stiffness degradation profiles, the crack propagation rates for the 8HS woven/BMI laminate are confirmed to be slower at 205C.

6.4.2 FourHarness Satin Woven/RP46 Laminate

Results of the onaxis room temperature and elevated temperature static tests for the 4HS woven/RP46 laminate were originally presented in [174]. Additional fatigue tests were subsequently conducted and those results will be presented here, along with the reproduced static test results. Static and fatigue tests were conducted at room temperature and at an elevated temperature of (Tg, wet  28)C using the same experimental protocol and procedures described in Sections 4.3  4.5. The ultimate tensile static test stressstrain plots for the two test temperatures are shown collectively in Figure 119. Like the braided composite and the 8HS woven/BMI laminate, the stressstrain behaviour was linear at both test temperatures. The modulus was approximately equal at both test temperatures (78.5 GPa), and the room temperature tests exhibited slightly higher ultimate stresses at fracture. The fiberdominated material behaviour of the 4HS woven/RP46 laminate is evident from the ultimate static test results.

The uniaxial tensiontension fatigue tests presented here were conducted with a max of 50% UTS for both test temperatures. The stiffness results and damage observations for the conducted tests will now be presented and discussed. Both the room temperature and elevated temperature tests revealed that the material exhibited very little stiffness degradation, as is shown by the normalized stiffness degradation plots of Figure 120. Note that this may be due to the lower maximum applied stress. Nevertheless, similar observations were made as with the

192

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details braided composites and the 8HS woven/BMI laminates, where the stiffness degradation is lower at the elevated test temperature. Little ratcheting was observed for both test temperatures. The energy dissipated per unit volume (Ed) per cycle for the elevated temperature tests was constant for the duration of cycling, while Ed was slightly higher initially and then constant for the duration of the room temperature fatigue tests. For the room temperature tests, the initial higher Ed was likely due to the initial rapid stiffness drop. This suggests that the energy dissipation was due primarily to the development of fatigue damage, which was consistent throughout cycling. The main damage mechanisms observed for each test specimen via posttest SEM observations, regardless of test temperature, were throughthe yarnthickness cracks in the weft yarns and intraply yarn debonds [174]. Some cracking in the warp yarns (i.e., splitting) was also observed. Therefore, due to the differences in the stiffness degradation profiles, the crack propagation rates for the 4HS woven/RP46 laminate are confirmed to be slower at the elevated test temperature.

6.4.3 General Discussion

For both fiberdominated woven laminates studied in this section, the relative material behaviour observed at room temperature and elevated temperature was analogous to the observations made with the braided composite. The stiffness degradation rate during cyclic loading was consistently lower at elevated temperatures, even though the material properties were only slightly influenced by the elevated temperature environment. This suggests that the 193

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details two fiberdominated woven laminates undergo similar local resin deterioration at elevated temperatures, which effectively decreases the crack propagation rates. This provides additional support for the experimental results obtained for the braided composite material. This subsequently provides further support for the type of damage model developed in this study, and its relevance for predicting room temperature and elevated temperature fatigue damage development for fiberdominated composites.

6.5 Implementation of Damage Model in a CDM Framework
Although the developed analytical fatigue damage model is suitable for predicting damage development and stiffness degradation of composite materials, the damage model can be subsequently implemented into a set of 'damaged' constitutive equations for fatigue damage simulations of composite components. Some details of the theory of CDM and the implementation of this procedure will be presented. The premise of damage mechanics (or CDM) was introduced in Section 3.7 and is based on the concept of evolving microscopic changes in materials, which cause progressive deterioration of their bulk mechanical properties [159]. Consider for example damage accumulation during fatigue loading of composite materials, which causes stiffness and strength degradation as discussed in Section 3.2. CDM allows for the consideration of the microscopic damage state of the material in order to predict the macroscopic changes in the mechanical properties. The damage parameter defined by Equation (56) is introduced as a representation of the effective surface density of defects, assuming that the microscopic damage is uniform over the material component and small in size compared to the dimensions of the component. Thus, when the damaged component is loaded as shown in Figure 121, the concept of an effective stress can be introduced which was defined by Equation (57). In CDM, the effective stress is used to define the strain response of the damaged material [190]. Defining the damaged area, AD, for a representative volume is of course difficult and likely impossible, thus the damage parameter, D, can be approximated by a suitable cumulative damage formulation. The damage accumulation models developed in this study, and defined by Equations (52) and (60), would be suitable choices for the braided composite material.

The concepts outlined in the previous paragraph form the basis for developing damaged constitutive models within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics. The

thermodynamics of irreversible processes is based on energy concepts and the evolving local states within a material. Within this framework, the constitutive equations for a mechanical system are effectively derived from the basic principles of thermodynamics. The thermodynamic state of a material that involves irreversible internal dissipation can be defined by external state variables which are measurable quantities (e.g., stress or strain, and temperature), and internal state variables which are nonmeasurable quantities (e.g., local damage). For mechanically loaded composite materials, the microscopic development of the various forms of damage are considered irreversible processes. The well known ClausiusPlanck entropy inequality form of the second law of thermodynamics is employed to impose a restriction on the formulation of the internal dissipation terms [191]. Therefore to characterize a continuous media within the thermodynamic framework, a thermodynamic potential  (which is analogous to a strain energy function) must be defined. The thermodynamic potential is a scalar function of the external and internal state variables of the thermodynamic system (i.e., ( or , D) for isothermal conditions). An example of a thermodynamic potential developed by Ladeveze [166] for damaged elastic unidirectionalply composite materials is shown in Equation (61).

6 Fatigue Damage Modeling Details Note that Equation (61) is written in terms of the tensor terms and not the tensors themselves, and is for an orthotropic material subjected to a plane stress state. The thermodynamic potential, which is based on the previously defined effective stress concept, includes two scalar damage variables, d and d', which represent specific modes of damage. The cumulative damage models developed in this study (i.e., d1 and d2, or D) could be used as input within a similar thermodynamic potential. Note that the damage parameters presented in Equation (61) effectively scale the material stiffness terms (i.e., E2, G12). The constitutive equations that govern the behaviour of a damaged material can then be defined from the thermodynamic potential function () using the following expression.

Note that Equation (62) is in fact a general set of equations for any type of material behaviour (e.g., linear elastic, plastic, viscoelastic) that includes the effects of irreversible damage. In other words, Equation (62) represents nonlinear material behaviour caused by irreversible damage, regardless of the bulk material constitutive behaviour. Note that for a constitutive model with many scalar damage parameters, it is often common to represent the scalar damage parameters in the form of a tensor [162, 163]. Specifically regarding fatigue of composites, the damage variable evolution laws must also be defined. This is where the evolution of the cumulative damage parameters (i.e., dD/dn) is incorporated within the CDMbased constitutive formulation. The framework for developing a CDMbased constitutive model for composite materials with evolving damage was presented, however the application of this technique is beyond the scope of this study and is left for a future study.

7 Overall Discussion and Summary

7 OVERALL DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
The experimental results presented in Chapter 5 and the fatigue prediction model results presented in Chapter 6 will be the basis for the discussion in the subsequent paragraphs. First, a general discussion on the exhibited braided composite static properties will be presented, followed by a detailed discussion on the braided composite fatigue behaviour. Finally, a discussion on the developed fatigue damage prediction model will conclude the chapter.

7.1 Braided Composite Static Tests
The uniaxial tensile displacementcontrolled quasistatic tests conducted on the triaxial braided composite material revealed that the elevated temperature environment did not significantly alter the measured macroscopic material properties (i.e., E11 and Su). A similar observation was also made for the two wovenply laminates studied. The braided composite did not exhibit any ratedependent or timedependent behaviour either. However, the local damage development was notably different for the room temperature and elevated temperature specimens. Recall that the room temperature braided specimens exhibited a bilinear stressstrain behaviour. This was the result of an instantaneous increase in the braider yarn crack density at the transition stress, which thereafter rendered the braider yarns ineffective in supporting additional applied load causing increased material compliance. This was observed through extracted edge replicas, FBG sensor chirping and IR thermographs. This is analogous to firstply failure observed with some quasiisotropic laminates. This type of damage 197

7 Overall Discussion and Summary development was not observed with the elevated temperature test specimens. In fact, there was little damage up until ultimate failure, which was further confirmed by post mortem SEM observations. As a result of significantly reduced braider yarn crack development and the lack of a stress relieving mechanism in the braider yarns, the braider yarns were fully effective until specimen failure which resulted in the exhibited linear stressstrain behaviour. An additional investigation on neat resin test specimens revealed that the thermosetting resin modulus notably reduced at elevated temperatures, while a slight increase in the resin 'ductility' was also observed. The increased resin ductility combined with the constraint of the reinforcing braided fibers on the resin resulted in 'tougher' resin fracture behaviour at elevated temperatures, which acted to mitigate the onset and development of microcracks in the composite. In addition, the potential change in the local load distribution between the resin and the fibers, caused by the softening resin, may have further contributed to slowing crack development at elevated temperatures. These were the main mechanisms responsible for the notable change in the braided composite microscopic damage development. Although the composite material properties and fracture surface characteristics were similar at both test temperatures, the local influence of temperature on damage development was revealed. It should also be noted that there were few yarn interface and matrix cracks for the duration of all static tests.

7.2 Braided Composite Fatigue Tests
The uniaxial tensiontension stresscontrolled fatigue tests conducted on the triaxial braided composite material also revealed that the elevated temperature environment had a notable influence on the development of microscopic fatigue damage. This resulted in a notable difference with the SN data obtained at the two test temperatures, as was presented in Figure 74 (b). The SN curves were both represented by a linear relationship between the maximum applied stress ratio (max/Su) and the logarithm of the number of cycles to failure (logNf). At higher applied stresses (i.e., LCF regime) the number of cycles to failure for both test temperatures were somewhat comparable, while at lower applied stresses (i.e., HCF regime) the number of cycles to failure were notably lower for the elevated temperature tests. In both

198

7 Overall Discussion and Summary cases, a HCFS was established and confirmed using the thermographic technique (i.e., Risitano's method). At room temperatures, the HCFS represented a transition in the damage state of the material, where cycling with maximum applied stresses above the HCFS resulted in significant damage after just the first loading cycle. This is evident by considering the high energy dissipated during the initial few loading cycles that was caused by excessive crack development, which is evident by the plots in Figure 53 and Figure 55. This was not observed for the specimens cycled with maximum applied stresses below the HCFS. At the elevated test temperature, the HCFS also represented a transition from a slightly lower damage state to an advanced damage state at stresses above the HCFS (see Figure 84 and Figure 86). Also, the HCFS was lower in magnitude at the elevated test temperature. In terms of the dynamic stiffness degradation, the room temperature specimens exhibited rapid degradation during the first stage of cycling, followed by gradual degradation during the second stage, and rapid degradation during the third stage prior to failure. The threestage stiffness degradation profile is also commonly exhibited by many crossply and quasiisotropic laminates. The elevated temperature specimens exhibited a more gradual stiffness degradation during the first stage of cycling, but a higher degradation rate during the second stage. In fact, the stiffness degradation for the elevated temperature specimens was more gradual for the entire duration of cycling. The notable difference in the stiffness degradation profiles was mainly due to the influence of temperature on the microscopic fatigue damage development, even though the macroscopic static material properties were only slightly altered by the elevated test temperature. For the room temperature specimens, damage developed in three distinct phases: (i) initial rapid development of braider yarn cracks up to a damage saturation state along with initiation of localized yarn interface cracks, followed by (ii) gradual development of braider yarn cracks and growth of yarn interface cracks, and finally (iii) severe interaction of different matrixdominated damage modes leading to load redistribution and weakening of the warp yarns, fiber fracture and ultimately specimen failure. At the end of the first stage of cycling when the braider yarn crack saturation state was attained, the notable cracking within the braider yarns caused stress relief within these yarns and therefore less braider yarn crack development thereafter. The damage development was

199

7 Overall Discussion and Summary confirmed by extracted edge replicas, obtained IR thermographs and post mortem SEM observations. For the elevated temperature tests, the damage development rate was significantly lower during the initial stages of cycling, but more consistent for the duration of cycling. This was confirmed from the extracted edge replicas and further confirmed by the infrared thermographs. Braider yarn crack development occurred during all stages of cycling, while yarn interface cracks only began to grow significantly during the latter stages of cycling. For both test temperatures, the braider yarn cracks were the dominant damage mechanisms observed due to the higher stresses within the braider yarns. The yarn interface cracks were also influential damage mechanisms, but there were fewer in quantity relative to the braider yarn cracks. Moreover, the development of the braider yarn and yarn interface cracks was directly correlated to the exhibited stiffness degradation for both test temperatures, as was presented in Figure 66 and Figure 96. These results demonstrated that braider yarn and interface cracks were the main contributors to stiffness degradation for the duration of cycling. The main cause of the altered damage development (and associated stiffness degradation) exhibited by the braided specimens is the influence of temperature on the local resin behaviour. Softening of the resin at the elevated test temperature increased the resin toughness and likely reduced the stress concentration within the braider yarns due to a change in the local load distribution between the fibers and the matrix. This consequently slowed the development of microscopic crack development in the braided composite. This was particularly noticeable during the initial stage of cycling for the elevated temperature test specimens cycled at lower applied stresses; the crack development was slower and there was a delay in the stiffness degradation response. The reduced damage development rate during the elevated temperature fatigue tests was also evident by the temperature rise captured with the IR camera, which was significantly lower for the elevated temperature specimens. In addition, for both test temperatures the same braider yarn crack density caused the same stiffness degradation during the earlier stages of cycling (see Figure 66 and Figure 96). Recall that the braider yarn cracks were the main cause of stiffness degradation during this stage of cycling. Thus, this illustrates that the measured stiffness loss was only caused by damage accumulation at both test temperatures. Thus, the hypothesis that the elevated temperature environment

200

7 Overall Discussion and Summary simply changes the crack propagation rate is in fact accurate. Similar observations were also presented for the two fiberdominated wovenply laminates studied. It should be noted that for the same maximum applied stress, the room temperature specimens exhibited more stiffness degradation after a comparable number of cycles. This was a peculiar result considering that the elevated temperature specimens have notably lower fatigue lives for all applied stress levels. This can be explained by the fact that the mechanisms causing stiffness degradation for the major part of cycling differ from those that result in ultimate failure during the final stage of cycling. Although braider yarn and interface cracks result in stiffness degradation throughout the duration of cycling, the final failure event is initiated by additional local matrix cracks and yarn interface failures as was detected by inspection of the fracture surfaces and well as by the infrared camera. Once the saturation of these damage modes occurs, load is redistributed to the 0 yarns since the matrix and the braider yarns are less effective in supporting load. This causes the warp yarns to weaken due to developing splitting cracks, which subsequently leads to fiber fracture within the yarns as cycling progresses. This eventually results in fracture of the warp yarns, which ultimately leads to specimen failure. In addition, local damage observations revealed that although the braider yarn and yarn interface cracks developed along the fibermatrix interfaces, at elevated temperatures these cracks were accompanied by additional damage in the resin due to the deterioration of the resin or the fibermatrix interfaces. These modes of damage are matrix dominated and the braided composite is more susceptible to these damage modes at elevated temperatures. Thus, although the damage state within the braider yarns under a particular applied stress is less advanced after a certain number of cycles at the elevated test temperature (which did not cause failure at room temperature), the failure event occurs due to the increased local matrixinduced damage which ultimately causes localized weakening of the 0 fiber yarns. This also explains the lower HCFS exhibited by the elevated temperature test specimens. In addition, consider that there were fewer interface cracks at failure for higher applied stresses, and that the fatigue lives in the LCF regime were comparable for both test temperatures. This illustrates that for the LCF regime, fewer interface cracks led to less matrix induced damage development and therefore similar resulting fatigue lives at both

201

7 Overall Discussion and Summary temperatures. This further supports the stated hypothesis regarding the fatigue lives. This also reveals that the failurecausing mechanisms were slightly different for LCF and HCF regimes, and that there were different exhibited residual strength developments. It should also be noted that the failure event for all fatigue tests conducted was rapid, which did not allow for significant stiffness degradation during the last stage of cycling (especially at elevated temperatures). This type of fracture behaviour was also found to occur with biaxial braided PMC test specimens [66]. It should also be noted that for both test temperatures, the exhibited ratcheting behaviour was mainly due to damage development (i.e., opening crack faces not fully closing upon unloading) since very little creep was observed. This was confirmed by a series of creep tests at the elevated test temperature, and by the fact that there was significantly less ratcheting during the elevated temperature tests. If the material exhibited creep deformation, this would have caused an increase in ratcheting deformation at elevated temperatures. The opposite was in fact observed, which was due to less damage development at elevated temperatures. This is a direct result of the fiberdominated braided composite behaviour. Matrixdominated PMC materials would tend to exhibit drastically different damage development and macroscopic material behaviour, with notable creep or timedependent behaviour as well as potential fiber yarn reorientation phenomenon [72]. In fact, the characteristic local damage development for the braided composite and the associated macroscopic hysteretic behaviour may be typical of other fiberdominated PMC materials. The fiber geometry seems to dictate the type of damage modes present, while the matrix material influences the rate of propagation of these damage modes. This is an important discovery that assists in better understanding the damage and deformation mechanics of other similar fiber reinforced PMC materials. This insight may lead to a generalized fatigue damage model for fiberdominated PMC materials in the future. However, it should be noted that some studies on fiberdominated unidirectionalply PMCs [5, 82, 85, 87] have reported that the influence of elevated temperatures on the corresponding SN data is less significant than that shown for the braided composite. It should also be noted that the tested 8HS woven/BMI and 4HS woven/RP46 laminates exhibited similar temperature influence as that presented for the

202

7 Overall Discussion and Summary braided composite specimens. There is no doubt that the type of resin and the specific test temperature must be considered and analyzed in great detail in order to confirm this argument. Another important finding of this study is that the average stiffness degradation rate (i.e., E/Nf) is a function of the maximum applied stress, at both test temperatures. This is due to the fact that the braider yarn and interface crack development rates are also functions of the maximum applied stress as shown in Figure 100 and Figure 104. As the maximum stress increases, the stiffness degradation rate increases and the crack development rates increase. This could be useful quantitative information for the design of components made from this braided composite material. Regardless of the applied stress magnitude (i.e., LCF or HCF regime), the stiffness degradation rate follows a power law function. In addition, a critical stiffness may be defined as a function of the maximum applied stress which can be used to predict the fatigue life. The correlation between the average stiffness degradation rate and the maximum applied stress can be used to facilitate the prediction of the fatigue life. A final point is that the braided composite exhibited excellent fatigue performance at room temperature. For example, at a maximum stress of 70% UTS the fatigue life was >106 cycles. At elevated temperatures, the braided composites also exhibited excellent fatigue properties. Although there are few high temperature studies available in the literature, a comparison of room temperature SN data from studies conducted on other carbon fiber/resin composites loaded in the fiberdominated direction can be made. Some of these studies investigated quasiisotropic, crossply or unidirectional laminates [27, 37, 41, 48, 85, 115], woven laminates [52], noncrimp fabric composites [62], and biaxial braided composites [66]. A comparison in terms of the fatigue lives corresponding to a maximum applied stress, which is defined as a fraction of the static UTS, suggests that the investigated triaxial braided composite of this study performs better, if not comparable, to other fiberdominated carbon/resin composites when subjected to tensiontension fatigue loading with a stress ratio of R = 0.1. Also, the existence of a HCFS, which is not common for polymeric composites, further illustrates the excellent fatigue properties of the triaxial braided composite.

7 Overall Discussion and Summary

7.3 Fatigue Damage Model
The developed damage model presented in Chapter 6 was based on the experimentally obtained braider yarn and yarn interface crack densities. This provided a means to capture the influence of the elevated temperature environment on the crack propagation rate, and directly incorporate those effects into the analytical damage model. As indicated, the static material properties were only slightly influenced by the elevated test temperature, thus the effects of temperature were manifested through the slower crack propagation rates. Also, since the same damage mechanisms developed for the duration of cycling at both test temperatures, cumulative damage is governed by the same evolving crack densities at both test temperatures. Note that since the developed fatigue prediction model is based on actual damage mechanisms, it is classified in the third category of fatigue models (see Section 3.7). Few similar models based on crack density evolution have been developed in the open literature [59, 155], neither of which consider elevated temperature fatigue. In terms of predictive capability, the developed fatigue damage model was able to accurately capture the damage development at both test temperatures when compared to a stiffnessbased experimental damage index. The predicted stiffness degradation results for all stress levels, and both temperatures, showed excellent correlation with the experimental data. The accuracy of the prediction model in determining the residual stiffness was consistently within 2% of the corresponding experimental data. Also, since the damage model is based on crack density evolutions, its capability to predict damage accumulation (or residual stiffness) at both LCF and HCF regimes was demonstrated. This is one of the main advantages for a fatigue prediction model that is based on actual damage development parameters. In addition, the cumulative damage model allowed for the investigation of the two damage parameters, d1 and d2. The influence of each parameter on the damage development (and residual stiffness) can be isolated in order to define the corresponding affect on the material behaviour. This is an advantage for implementation of the damage model within a CDMbased constitutive model (see Equation (62)), where the individual damage parameters may be incorporated within the constitutive model separately.

8 Conclusions and Future Work

8 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
An investigation focussed on the tensile static and fatigue behaviour of a triaxial braided carbon fiber reinforced thermosetting resin composite, at both room temperature and elevated temperature, was conducted in order to gain a better understanding of the intricate material behaviour. The exhibited material behaviour during both static and fatigue loading was correlated to the observed microscopic damage mechanisms. The corresponding analytical fatigue prediction model was subsequently developed, the results of which were compared to the experimental data. Two additional satin woven carbon fiber reinforced thermosetting resin composites were similarly investigated to provide a comparative analysis with the triaxial braided material. The subsequent sections list the notable conclusions of this study, the main contributions made through this research, and recommendations for future work.

The most notable conclusions that can be drawn from this study are summarized by the following points: x The tensile static properties of the triaxial braided carbon fiber reinforced resin material, such as the axial modulus and ultimate strength, exhibited minimal temperature dependence. It was also confirmed that there was virtually no time or ratedependent

205

8 Conclusions and Future Work stressstrain behaviour for both temperatures considered. This was due to the fact that the braided composite was loaded in a fiberdominated direction. x The development of microscopic damage during static testing was however significantly influenced by temperature. A bilinear stressstrain behaviour was clearly exhibited at room temperature, which was a result of extensive braider yarn matrix cracking at the transition point. Linear stressstrain behaviour was characteristic of the braided composite during elevated temperature tests, which revealed little damage development throughout loading. The 'softening' of the thermosetting resin matrix constituent at the elevated test temperature combined with a change in the local load distribution between the fibers and resin, resulted in reduced microscopic damage development. x The elevated temperature environment had a notable influence on the tensile fatigue behaviour of the braided composite, particularly in terms of the exhibited residual stiffness. The stiffness degradation rate was notably lower at elevated temperatures, which was a result of slower crack propagation rates caused by softening of the matrix. The main observed damage mechanisms were braider yarn cracks and yarn interface cracks. x The fatigue lives in the HCF regime were notably lower at elevated temperatures. This was attributed to different matrixdominated mechanisms which caused failure to occur sooner at the elevated test temperature. This was a result of increased localized cracking at the fibermatrix interfaces, within the matrix rich zones, and the associated matrix damage, which was more prominent at elevated test temperatures. These damage mechanisms caused the warp fiber yarns to weaken sooner, which resulted in shorter fatigue lives. x By comparing the fatigue SN data of the triaxial braided composite with other fiber dominated carbon fiber/resin composites, the fatigue behaviour of the investigated braided composite is either superior or equivalent. The existence of a high cycle fatigue limit supports this claim. x The developed damage mechanicsbased analytical fatigue prediction model, which was defined using evolving damage parameters representative of actual damage mechanisms,

206

8 Conclusions and Future Work was able to predict damage development and stiffness degradation with an excellent correlation to the experimental data. The model is suitable for predicting damage development and the associated material property degradation. x The investigated woven carbon fiber/resin laminates exhibited analogous static and fatigue microscopic damage behaviour and macroscopic material behaviour as the triaxial braided composite. This supports the claim that the exhibited elevated temperature behaviour may be characteristic of many fiberdominated carbon fiber composites.

8.2 Contributions
The main contributions made through this study are summarized by the following points: x An indepth characterization of the static and fatigue behaviour of a braided composite, in terms of correlating microscopic damage mechanisms to the stiffness degradation, is a novel contribution to the open literature. The critical damage modes that caused stiffness degradation, and those that led to failure have been identified. A better understanding of the local damage development, the local deformation behaviour and the failure mechanisms of braided composite materials was achieved. x The high temperature characterization of the braided polymeric composite is also unique and another significant contribution of this study. This study is the first of its kind in the open literature. A better understanding of braided composite fatigue behaviour and the effects of temperature on fiberdominated thermosetting matrix composites was achieved. x The development of the fatigue damage model for a braided composite at elevated temperatures is another novel contribution. The type of damage model, which was based on observed damage mechanisms, has never been developed for an elevated temperature study. In addition, the fatigue damage model may be applicable to other fiberdominated composites. x The combination of techniques employed to monitor damage development, using local damage detection techniques (fiber optic sensors, edge replication) coupled with a global

207

8 Conclusions and Future Work damage detection technique (thermography), is a novel contribution. This has never been achieved for an elevated temperature study, especially not the use of thermography and fiber optic sensors at elevated temperatures. x x x This is one of only a few studies that used the thermographic approach (i.e., Risitano's method) to determine the high cycle fatigue strength for a polymeric composite material. This is the first fatigue study conducted on composite materials to capture actual damage development and to identify critical damage states using infrared thermography. A comprehensive review of reported elevated temperature fatigue studies conducted on polymeric composites in the open literature was presented, which has never been achieved. x A list of publications and manuscripts currently in progress, as related to this research, is included in Appendix A.3.

8.3 Future Work
Although notable contributions were made in this study, additional work can be performed to further advance the knowledge base of this emerging research area. The following points are a summary of recommendations for future work: x Obtain a proper crack count during the final stages of cycling prior to fracture in order to provide input for the fatigue damage model, which will allow for prediction of the entire fatigue life. An indepth study of the failure events must be conducted to achieve this. x Further verification of the crack development states and the crack propagation rates through use of another noncontact fullfield realtime nondestructive evaluation technique that can clearly detect different damage modes  especially at elevated temperatures. x Testing the capability of the developed damage prediction model with additional braided and woven composite materials for further validation. Additional tests with the two fiber dominated woven laminates studied here can be conducted to this end. This would

208

8 Conclusions and Future Work provide further support for this class of fatigue damage model, which may eventually lead to wider acceptance in the aerospace industry. x The implementation of the developed damage model into a damage mechanicsbased constitutive model for finite element simulation of fatigue damage development in composite components can be done. This was in fact outlined in this study. x A full experimental test program on the triaxial braided composite could be conducted at a few intermediate test temperatures. This will provide further comparison of the material properties and damage development at the intermediate temperatures. In terms of the fatigue damage prediction model, results from the elevated temperature tests can be used to relate the model parameters to not only the maximum applied stress, but to the test temperature as well. x A similar experimental test program can be conducted on a material comprised of the same triaxial braided carbon fiber fabric with a different matrix material (e.g., RP46) to verify if the exhibited material behaviour and damage development is characteristic of braided materials, or the specific resin constituent. x A similar experimental test program can be conducted on the same braided carbon fiber/resin composite material in a matrixdominated loading configuration. A comparison of the matrixdominated material response to the presented fiberdominated braided composite material behaviour can be made, and would be valuable.

APPENDICES A.1 Crack Density Evaluation Details
This appendix subsection will explain the approach used to count the number of braider yarn and interface cracks for establishing crack densities from the obtained edge replicas. Recall that the edge replicas were extracted at numerous cyclic intervals throughout a single test, and were utilized for various stress levels and for both room temperature and elevated temperature fatigue tests. The replicas were also extracted for the room temperature ultimate static tests. To assist with the explanation of the braider yarn crack density counts, Figure A1 shows an edge replica extracted during a fatigue test. In the same figure a schematic representation of braider yarn and interface cracking is also shown. Two common crack patterns that were consistently observed are illustrated in Figure A1. The first crack pattern is the propagation of a single apparent crack through multiple adjacent braider yarns of the same orientation (i.e., all yarns +60, or 60) as indicated by the circle in the edge replica image. Although this may seem like a single crack, the crack actually propagated through two braider yarns, thus would be counted as two braider yarn cracks. This is the accurate approach because both cracked braider yarns would contribute approximately the same degree of stiffness degradation, thus both 'cracks' should be accounted for in the braider yarn crack density. The second crack pattern is the propagation of a long interface crack along the periphery of the 0 yarns, in the warp direction, as indicated by the ellipse in the edge replica image. These type of cracks were often observed to initiate between a 0 yarn and a braider yarn, and found to propagate along the 0 yarn direction through the interface of another braider yarn. Also, these cracks were often initiated as two separate cracks at the interfaces between a 0 yarn and two separate braider yarns, then combined to form one apparent crack as cyclic loading progressed. In either case, since the interface crack has propagated though the interfaces of two braider yarns as shown in the edge replica image, this would actually be considered as two cracks in the interface crack density count. Therefore, as the crack lengths increased during cycling due to propagation/interaction, this effect was actually accounted for within the interface crack density count.

A.2 Risitano's Thermographic Method
The method assumes that the recorded temperature variation caused by cyclic loading of a test specimen is a measure of the heat dissipation due to intrinsic energy dissipative mechanisms (see Section 3.6). The test specimen is cycled for a limited number of cycles at a given maximum stress level in order to produce stabilization of the rising surface temperature caused by heat dissipation. This is repeated for many stress levels at a constant loading frequency, where the schematic of temperature variation versus cycles for various stress levels is shown in Figure A2 (a). For each stress level, the corresponding temperature increase from initial to stabilization (Tstab) can be plotted at a function of the applied stress as shown schematically in Figure A2 (b). Then, from the plot it can be seen that when the threshold point is reached the temperature increase is greater and the fatigue limit or HCFS can be determined. The hypothesis is that when the fatigue limit is exceeded, the heat dissipation drastically increases because of the increase in the degree of intrinsic energy dissipation [178].
