Abstract CORRELATION OF PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD PROPERTIES TO PAD-CRATER DEFECTS UNDER MONOTONIC SPHERICAL BEND Brian Gray Master of Applied Science Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University, 2012 The restriction of lead in solder has caused a change in base materials used to make electronics--the result of which has been a new failure mode known as pad-crater. The susceptibility of six commercially available printed circuit board (PCB) laminates to pad-crater by spherical bend test was determined. The correlation of PCB laminate tensile properties, Vicker's hardness (VH) of the resin, and weave dimensions showed an inverse relation between susceptibility to pad-crater and VH. Spherical bend testing of pure G10 laminate showed the orthotropic nature of laminates must be accounted for when modeling spherical bend. Comparison of bare PCB spherical bend test results showed the warp and weft direction have different strain responses for some materials. Comparison of strain energy of printed circuit board assemblies and bare PCB subjected to spherical bend showed the additional stiffness added by the ball grid array is almost identical for PCB laminates with different tensile properties.

Introduction

The European Union restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) outlined in Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament restricts the use of lead (Pb) in solders to less than 1000 ppm [1]. This restriction has caused a shift in electronics assembly away from tin-lead (PbSn) eutectic solders to solders comprised of tin (Sn), silver (Au), and copper (Cu)­commonly referred to as SAC solder. The switch to SAC solders has had a far reaching effect across all aspects of electronics including reliability, quality, and base materials. The new SAC solders have a solidus temperature of 217°C and, as with noneutectics alloys, they have mushy zones before becoming liquidus at temperatures ranging from 217°C to 227°C, depending on the alloy [2]. In comparison, PbSn

eutectic solder melts at 183°C. PCB processing temperatures during reflow are typically 30°C to 40°C above the melting temperature of solder used to form solder joints. As such, processing temperatures for PCBs reach between 220oC to 230oC with SnPb solder, and 250°C to 260°C with SAC solder. The increased reflow temperatures

associated with SAC solders has forced PCB manufacturers to change their epoxy resin formulations to increase cross linking thereby increasing material glass transition (Tg), and change curing agents from dicyandiamide (dicy) to phenolic novalec [3]. The

increased reflow temperatures necessitate the addition of fillers (ceramic particles) to reduce out-of-plane coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the PCB, thus reducing the stress on plated copper through vias [4]. Vias, which are copper plated holes in the PCB, are required to move electrical signal between layers of the PCB. The net effect of these changes is a harder and more brittle base resin material [5]. In comparison to

1

SnPb solder, SAC alloys in general have higher Young's modulus (E) and their Young's modulus increases with strain rate rate. Figure 1 shows hows the different failure modes of a BGA ball as per IPC/JEDEC 9702 9702, Monotonic Bend Characterization of Board-Level Board Interconnect [6].

Figure 1: IPC9702 BGA Failure Mode Diagram

[6]

With SnPb eutectic solder, the predominant failure mode of BGA sol solder der joints were modes 6 and 7. With the introduction of lead lead-free free SAC solder, the failure mode shifted to pad-crater­mode 4 as per Figure 1 [6]. pad-crater is shown in Figure 2. An example mple cross section of a BGA

Pad-crater has no associated electrical failure unless it is catastrophic and occurs across many signal pads. Pad-crater cracks have been shown to propagate slowly under thermal cycling; rather, the primary cause of crack propagation is isothermal stress [7]. If a pad-crater crack propagates across the signal pad, then all thermal and mechanical stresses will be borne by the copper signal trace. Due to copper's relatively low Young's modulus, this

loading condition will almost certainly result in severing of the copper signal trace. If the crack propagates into the PCB, there is a risk of conductive anodic filament (CAF) growth between two copper features inside a PCB. CAF is an electrochemical failure mechanism that occurs in the end-user environment which results in unintended electrical conductivity between two copper features in a PCB [8].

[9]

For CAF to occur, three conditions must be present in a PCB: a crack between two copper features, moisture ingress into the crack, and voltage potential between the two copper features [7]. Multiple investigators have shown that pad-crater can travel below 3

the first layer of glass weave in a PCB [9,10] with one example shown in Figure 3. A crack as shown in Figure 3 in a PCBA with high density interconnects could easily occur between two copper features close to the PCB surface. A crack of this kind would provide a path for moisture ingress, making two of the three requirements for CAF present. The deleterious effects of moisture ingress into a PCB can work to weaken the strength of the PCB in four different ways. Moisture present in resin of a PCB can replace the ­OH bonds in the matrix, thereby breaking down the cross link bonds [11]. When water occupies free volume in the matrix, the molecules tend to coalesce which puts stress on the matrix [11]. The resin glass interface also breaks down in the

presence of moisture [12] and cracks in the E-glass fiber are known to propagate faster in the presence of moisture [13]. Pad-crater mitigation techniques including dimensional changes to BGA corner pads and polyimide films between the signal pads and PCB have been investigated and have shown no appreciable increase in PCBA level surviving strain [9, 14]. Strain energy release rates (Jci) for crack propagation of SAC solder and one lead-free PCB laminate showed Jci rates to be higher for SAC solders [15,16]. Unless material changes are implemented to make Jci values lower for solder than PCBs, thereby moving the failure point back to the solder where there is an associated electrical fail, pad-crater will prevail as the predominant mechanical failure mode.

1.1 Overview Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA)
A PCBA is a PCB with attached application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), integrated circuits (ICs), resistors, capacitors and other electric components to make a finished electronics product. PCBAs are found in everything from cell phones to

communication servers. In a cell phone, a PCBA may weigh roughly 100 grams and an internet backbone communication server PCBA can weigh over 15 kg with heat sinks attached. Regardless of size, a PCBA has a base PCB to which electrical components

are attached with solder. A schematic of a PCBA is shown in Figure 4 complete with components typically attached.

Figure 4: Printed Circuit Board Assembly

Assembly of a PCBA starts with a bare PCB. The PCB is screened with solder paste over the areas where solder joints are required. The solder paste is a mixture of small solder spheres, flux, and flux carriers. After screening, the PCB is populated with

electronic components by pick and place equipment. Once all components are placed

5

on the PCB, it travels through an oven where it is subjected to a thermal profile that allows the flux carrier to evaporate, the flux to clean the surface to be soldered, and the solder spheres to become liquidus so they coalesce to form a solder joint. The solder joint serves as both a mechanical and electrical connection between the PCB and the component, and also provides a path for heat to dissipate away from the component.

1.2 Literature Review
There are no published studies that compare multiple PCB laminate material properties to their susceptibility to pad-crater when subject to monotonic spherical bend. Comparative spherical bend of different PCB laminates mounted with a ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) was shown to be an effective measure of a laminate's resistance to pad-crater, but no investigation into material properties was conducted [17]. Factors affecting a PCB laminate's susceptibility to pad-crater include thermal reflow history, exposure to moisture, PCBA construction, and temperature at the time of mechanical loading [10]. Investigations into pad-crater have primarily focused on correlation of joint level testing to PCBA level pad-crater, four-point bend testing, and pad-crater mitigation techniques. The principle of all joint level testing is to apply a load to a signal pad until failure. Joint level testing involves clamping the PCB at the edges with the test pad being the only point of applied load. Joint level testing can be divided into three

categories: pin pull, bump pull, and shear. Figure 5 shows a schematic of all three test methods. Pin pull can be further divided into hot pin pull (HPP) and cold pin pull (CPP), and the test method involves attaching a copper pin to the test pad and pulling the pin

6

until pad failure. CPP occurs close to room temperature and HPP occurs at elevated temperatures to simulate end user conditions.

Figure 5: Bump Pull, Shear and Pin Pull

Bump pull can also be divided into hot and cold bump pull (HBP & CBP). Bump pull involves applying load through a solder sphere (bump) attached to the test pad. The bump is clamped by a special gripper that induces considerable deformation on the solder sphere, and then load is applied to the pad until failure. The large deformation induced by the grippers on the solder bump makes correlation of results to PCBA level pad-crater complex [18]. The pull angle for both pin and bump pull can be varied to simulate PCBA level loading, but one author has reported no difference in pad strength with change in pull angle, and another has reported an increase in cohesive pad crater over adhesive (see Figure 14) with decrease in pull angle from normal to the plane of the PCB surface [19, 20]. Shear testing applies a shear force with a blade to a solder bump and can drive failure in the PCB and the solder pad interface depending on the solder composition and PCB finish. Industry groups are using this method for correlation to pad-crater, but

7

their work is not published. Shear testing has been used to compare board finish and solder alloy's propensity for pad-crater during drop testing [21]. The advantages of joint level testing are that it is economical, repeatable, and results can be generated in short time. The drawbacks are that it cannot account for pre-stress that typically exist in PCBAs due to CTE mismatch between components and the PCB after assembly reflow. Furthermore, joint level testing provides the strength of a particular solder joint to a certain load that is directly applied to the solder joint. The results of such an assessment do not represent the actual end loading conditions found in a PCBA in the end user environment. In a real application, the loads are the remote boundary conditions of a PCBA, and these loads are transferred to the local area of the solder interconnects by PCB and/or modules on the PCB. As such, an investigation of the pad-crater failure must take into consideration the PCB behavior as well as the factors that determine the behavior. One study attempted to overcome these

drawbacks of pad level testing by applying a constant bending load to a PCB before pin pull testing. The results of this showed that the peak load to failure decreased with increased board strain [22]. Four-point-bend testing in accordance with test method IPC/JEDEC 9702 [6] is a commonly used industry standard for comparatively testing PCB laminates under bend load. Figure 6 shows a diagram of a four-point-bend test with a test PCBA. The outer anvils are stationary while the inner anvils travel at a specified speed and displacement to apply load to the PCBA. The result is a constant unidirectional bending moment

8

applied to the PCBA between the inner anvils. Electrical continuity of the highlighted solder joints in Figure 6 are monitored throughout the test to determine failing strain.

Figure 6: Four-point-bend test diagram

With PbSn solder, four-point-bend testing provides a comparative method for determining the failing strain under constant unidirectional bend since the failure is in the solder joint. With lead-free solders, where PCB laminate failure precedes electrical failure, its shortcomings become apparent. The constant unidirectional bend moment applied by the four-point-bend test is not typical of assembly or end-user conditions, and the solder joints under test reinforce each other which over estimates the failing strain. In response to the shortcomings of joint level and four-point-bend testing, the electronics industry developed the spherical bend test method [23]. This test,

performed at the PCBA level, is based on the ring-on-ring test method typically used on glass and ceramics to find surface defects [24]. Spherical bend test method deforms a 9

PCBA into a hemispherical shape which applies a bi-directional bending moment to the corner solder joints. There is no reinforcement of the corner solder joints by

neighbouring solder joints, and spherical bend is more representative of assembly and end user conditions. As such, spherical bend-testing provides the most accurate

estimate of a PCB laminate's resistance to pad-crater defects. Hsieh et al. [25] first published results of spherical bend in comparison to four-point-bend and concluded that spherical bend was a more conservative test method for pad-crater, and also more realistic test that simulated PCBA loading during in-circuit-test (ICT). The electronics industry traditionally used principal strain as the metric for determining process strain limits for PCBAs, but Lei et al. [26, 27] showed that principal strain as a metric for PCBA strain limits has a high degree of variation and is sensitive to bend mode. Principal strain is an indication of the maximum surface strain at the PCB surface, and does not necessarily correspond to the direction of maximum bend [26, 27]. Diagonal strain, or the strain coincident with the minimum bend radius for the spherical bend-test has been shown to have the best correlation to pad-crater defects, so it is the strain used for all analysis in this paper [27]. A SEM image of a test PCB laminate is shown in Figure 7 with the ceramic particles (fillers) highlighted. As the figure shows, the ceramic particles vary in size and are evenly spread throughout the resin. A SnPb eutectic PCB laminate would not have these ceramic particles due to the lower reflow temperature. Roggeman et al. [20] compared the crack path for filled and unfilled resin systems using hot bump pull and showed that for unfilled resin systems, the crack path travels into the PCB to the first

10

level of E-glass weave (see Figure 14) and for filled resin systems, the crack path is shallow and just below the copper (see Figure 14). Cyclic testing of the same PCB with hot pin pull showed filled resin systems to be 10 times more resistant to crack propagation [20].

Figure 7: PCB Laminate G, SEM at 600x magnification, 10keV

A comparison of filled phenolic and unfilled dicy resins by hot pin pull showed the failing pin force for dicy cured epoxy to be about twice that of filled phenolic [19]. The addition of fillers to the phenolic resin and not dicy makes the comparison indirect, but it represents their end use condition. Mukadam [7] et al. compared the micro-indentation hardness of PCBs as received and after three times reflow to 220°C and 260°C with results showing that micro-indentation hardness increased significantly with increased reflow temperature. Increased hardness does not necessarily translate into higher Young's modulus (E), but it suggests increased susceptibility to shear and flexural forces in the PCB [7]. 11

CAF was first discovered as a failure mode in the 1970s during accelerated life testing, but was not widely reported until recently [28]. Increased processing

temperatures exacerbate the CTE mismatch between the resin and the E-glass weave which puts more stress on the bond between E-glass and epoxy [8]. Pad-crater

presents the opportunity for crack initiation point and combined with the weakened bond between the E-glass the epoxy matrix, one could logically conclude pad-crater increases the risk of CAF.

1.3 Objectives of Thesis
Pad-crater defects are a localized failure phenomenon that is affected by both local and global parameters of the PCBA structure and its constituent material properties. The literature review showed that there are no published studies relating PCB material properties to their susceptibility to pad-crater at the PCBA level. Instead, the

electronics industry has chosen to primarily perform joint level and four-point-bend testing, and correlate the results to PCBA level pad-crater despite their shortcomings. A correlation between PCB laminates' resistance to pad-crater and its material properties would provide a better understanding of which material properties should be controlled to minimize pad-crater. Finite element modeling of PCBAs with solder as the point of failure afforded simplifications in the PCB model since it was not the region of interest. With the failure moving from the solder joint into the PCB, accurate modeling of PCB behaviour is a prerequisite for modeling pad-crater failure. Due to the short time the spherical bend test has been employed, there have been no published investigations into the effect of

12

altering the boundary conditions of spherical bend, or the strain energy for PCBAs versus bare PCBs. Bend testing of pure laminate and two different bare PCBs at two different spherical bend boundary conditions is presented. Also, strain energy of two different PCBAs in comparison to bare PCBs is presented.

Chapter 2: Constituent Materials of Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA)

2.1 Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
PCBs are a composite material comprised of cotton paper or E-glass reinforcement with resin providing the matrix material. Copper is also present in the form of signal traces and power/ground planes. In layers of the PCB that carry signals, there is a limited amount of copper because the traces are narrow and can be ignored at a macroscopic level.

Figure 8: PCB pressing process

In layers with power and ground planes, copper can often occupy 80% or more of the layer so for modeling and theoretical analysis, the effect of the copper must be considered. This paper investigates pad-crater in PCBs made from lead-free compatible PCB laminates and E-glass weave with ceramic particles. PCBs are manufactured by combining layers of E-glass weave, resin and plated copper, and pressing them together in the presence of heat as shown in Figure 8. The heat promotes cross linking and flow of the resin. 14

2.1.1 Resin Systems The transition from PbSn eutectic solders caused a change from dicy cured epoxies because they cannot survive the higher processing temperatures of SAC solders, and their susceptibility to water absorption [29, 30]. Increased sensitivity to water

absorption is driven by the increased water vapour pressure between SnPb and SAC processing temperatures.

Figure 9: Water Vapour Pressure vs. Temperature

Figure 9 shows water vapour pressure vs. temperature with SnPb and SAC processing temperatures highlighted [31]. The near doubling of water vapour pressure can cause internal damage to the PCB such as delamination with dicy cured epoxies.

Resins compliant with SAC reflow temperatures have more cross linking which increases their glass transition temperature (Tg) reducing the overall CTE. While

increased cross-linking produces stronger resins, they are also more brittle, which likely contributes to their susceptibility to pad-crater [30]. Further reduction of the CTE is

15

accomplished by the addition of ceramic particles [32]. Examples of SAC compliant resins are tetrafunctional epoxy, phenol novalec, epoxy-polyphenelene (PPO), polyphenelene-ether (PPE), among others. Figure 10 shows the molecular structure for tetrafunctional and phenol novalec resins.

Figure 10: Tetrafunctional and Phenol Novalec Resin molecular structure

[33]

Phenol novalec and tetrafunctional based resins have dielectric constant (Dk) and dissipative factor (Df) properties that make them suitable for lower frequency applications, and have Tg ranging from 125°C to 190°C [34]. The test PCB laminates that fall into this category have Tg equal to 170°C. PPO and PPE are low loss materials and are used for higher frequency applications where transmission rates exceed 3 giga bits per second (Gbps) [35]. The test PCB laminates that fall into this category have Tg values ranging from 210°C to 215°C. Brominating epoxy resins has been the typical path to the necessary flame retardancy in PCBs [36]. One common path to incorporating bromine into the resin structure is to use halogen containing tetrabromobisphenol A (TBPPA) [36]. 16 RoHS

legislation does not currently restrict TBPPA, but the anticipation of a restriction has caused the development of halogen-free PCBs. laminate was therefore included. 2.1.2 E-Glass Fabric Weave A tow is an untwisted collection of fibers which, when arranged in a pattern, forms a fabric. For PCBs, the E-glass material is a plain weave fabric and as a fabric, it has two directions known as warp and fill. A phosphorus based halogen-free PCB

Figure 11: Plain Weave Fabric Types as per IPC4611A

[37]

The warp direction is the direction in which every second tow is oscillated up and down while fiber tows are inserted or filled into the fabric. Since in the warp direction tows are moved up and down during the manufacturing process, they tend to oscillate more than the fill tows. This can lead to slightly different properties depending on material

direction. Figure 11 shows three examples of E-Glass fabric typically used in PCBAs. Eglass weaves are constructed in accordance with IPC4412A in terms of glass content and number of weaves per unit length in the warp and fill direction. There are many considerations for selecting the base material for a PCB; electrical performance and reliability ultimately drive material selection. Multiple layers of E-glass weave between signal layers are often used to reduce the risk of CAF and weave processes used to construct the fabric can affect the Dk and Df properties. 17 The fiber

weave effect (FWE) is a factor which affects digital signal transmission over 3 Gbps and it is directly affected by the non-homogenous nature of E-Glass weave [38]. E-glass weave can be processed to make the glass more evenly spread which reduces its nonhomogeneity and reduces FWE [38]. Two additional benefits of spread glass are

increased area for resin to bond to the E-glass and more continuous material properties at a microscopic level [38]. Vendors may or may not twist the bundles of E-glass for manufacturability which can greatly affect the microscopic properties of the PCB [39]. Bonding of the organic resin system to the inorganic E-glass weave is typically achieved with an organosilane compound which aids in wetting [40].

2.2 Solder, Copper, PCB and G10 Properties
Published values of Young's modulus (E) for SAC solders range from 45.9 GPa to 46.5 GPa [41, 42] and for SnPb eutectic solder E values range from 38.5 to 39.2 GPa at room temperature [43]. Both SAC and SnPb eutectic have increasing E with strain rate, although the effect is more pronounced with SnPb solders [44]. Published bulk copper properties for E is 128.7 GPa [45]. The copper that is present in a PCB has been electroplated and investigation of this type of copper's E value has ranged from 88-112 GPa with the average being 100 GPathe value used throughout this paper [46]. The E values for all PCB and G10 laminate calculations are the average value from the tensile testing. The poisson ratio () for both PCB and G10 calculations is 0.34 [47].

2.3 Ball Grid Array (BGA) Component
A BGA is an electronics package used to attach an ASIC to a PCB.

Figure 12: Ball Grid Array Package with lid removed

The BGA is essentially a miniature circuit board with a silicon die attached to one side and a high density array of second level interconnects (SLI) in the shape of solder spheres on the other. Figure 12 shows the bottom side, detached BGA lid, and top side of the test BGA. The BGA is 31 x 31 mm2 with a pin count of 937. The copper lid in Figure 12 shows the thermal interface material in the middle and the black adhesive used to attach the lid to the BGA substrate around the edges. The BGA provides the highest density of solder connects per unit area. Its drawbacks are that it lacks the

compliance provided by a package with gull wing leads such as a Quad Flat Pack (QFP), and the BGA provides no opportunity to repair solder defects so it must be completely removed in the event of a process defect. A cross-section of the PCB with the attached BGA is shown in Figure 13.

19

Figure 13: Attached BGA Cross section, 20x magnification

2.4 Pad-Crater
This paper defines two crack propagation paths for pad-crater. One crack path is directly below the signal pad and is considered to be an adhesive failure of the resin to the copper signal pad. The second crack path travels from the edge of the signal pad This crack path is

down through the resin layer to the first layer of fiber glass weave.

initially a cohesive failure of the resin and then becomes an adhesive failure of the resin to the E-glass weave. Both crack paths are shown in Figure 14. Some do not consider the adhesive failure to be pad-crater [7], but from a reliability perspective either crack path presents a risk to an electronic product's long term reliability.

20

Figure 14: Pad-crater crack paths

As observed by others, the initiation of a pad-crater crack happens well before any electrical connection is broken so it is possible to ship electronics products to the field with latent defects [7, 9, 10, 14].

Chapter 3: Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA), Bend Testing, and PCB Laminate Properties and Characteristics The PCB base material with stack-up, assembly process, and bend testing are presented in the following sections. presented. Also, the test methods for PCB laminates are

3.1 Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA)
3.1.1 PCB Stack-up & Technical Data Six commercially available PCB laminate materials typically used in

telecommunication products were all constructed to the same stack-up specifications.

Figure 15: Left: Test Vehicle Stack-up. Right: Example PCB @ 25x magnification under bright field

Figure 15 shows a stack-up schematic of the PCB with weave types along with an actual cross-section image of one PCB. The PCB stack-up is symmetrical about the core.

Two copper weightings present in the PCB are ½ oz. and 1 oz. and nominal thicknesses of copper are 17.1 µm and 34.3 µm, respectively [48].

22

The available material properties of the PCB are shown in Table 1.

Ideally more

material properties would be available, but for proprietary reasons the suppliers keep most information such as precise resin composition, E-glass surface treatments, among others, confidential.
Table 1: PCB Laminate Material Properties

The test laminates resin systems are phenolic based, PPO epoxy blend, PPE, and halogen-free.

3.1.2 PCBA Assembly Parameters The stencil used for screening solder paste on the PCBs was stainless steel and 0.127 mm (0.005") thick. Test PCBs had a high temperature organic solder protectant (OSP) finish and the stencil opening was 1:1 with the 0.53 mm (0.021") signal pad.

Figure 16: Reflow of PCBA

Figure 17: PCBA test vehicle

To simulate a two-sided process, the PCBs were subjected to a bottom side reflow with no component attach. After bottom side reflow, the PCBs were screened by a DEK 265 screen printer with a no-clean Type III solder paste with SAC 387 (Sn, 3.8% Au, 0.7% Cu) alloy. The test vehicles were subjected to the reflow profile in Figure 16 and a sample PCBA is shown in Figure 17. After reflow, PCBAs were kept at 40°C and less 24

than 5% relative humidity until they were bend tested in order to minimize the effects of moisture absorption for all testing.

3.2 Bend Testing
3.2.1 Spherical Bend Test IPC/JEDEC 9707, Spherical Bend Test Method For Characterization of Board Level Interconnects [23] was developed in response to the shortcomings of four-point-bend and solder joint level tests, as discussed in Chapter 1. A schematic of the spherical bend test with a PCBA is shown in Figure 18.

Figure 18: Left: Spherical Bend Test Fixture Schematic, Right: Bend Test Fixture.

During a bend test, the eight support pins are stationary and support the PCBA as the opposing indentor is driven into and flexes the PCBA into a hemispherical shape. The speed and the amount of board deflection are varied to match the conditions the test is intended to simulate. All testing was performed at 3.81 mm / second (9 in. / min)

which induces a board level strain rate of approximately 3000 µ / second. Load was

25

applied to test PCBAs by an Instron 5567 Materials Tester.

Linear variable

displacement transducer (LVDT) from Transtek (part number 0351-0006) was used to independently measure PCBA displacement for PCB laminates D, M and G. A Futek LCF450 pancake load cell (part number FSH00953) was used to provide input load for PCB laminates D, M and G. PCB laminates A, B and J did not have independent

measurement of load and displacement. An upgrade to the test fixture at the midpoint of the testing is the reason for additional data on PCB laminates D, M, and G. 3.2.2 Test Methodology The test vehicles were subjected to monotonic spherical bend testing in accordance with IPC/JEDEC-9707, Spherical Bend Test Method for Characterization of Board Level Interconnect [23] and PCB level strain was measured in accordance with

IPC/JEDEC-9704, Printed Wiring Board Strain Gage Test Guideline [49].

Figure 19: Spherical Bend Test Methodology

Each corner of the BGA is considered to be a test due to the symmetric nature of the test set-up. Since the PCB laminate failures precede electrical opens, the test vehicles were subjected to progressively larger deflections to define three zones: all pass, mixed pass/fail, and all fail. Figure 19 shows a graphical explanation of the bend test 26

methodology. The peak diagonal strain was used as the passing or failing strain for Weibull analysis. 3.2.3 Strain Measurement and Calculations Ideally, measurement of strain response of a solder joint up to failure would provide good criteria for determining the strain envelope for a PCBA, but BGA solder joints are small and not easily accessible which makes direct measurement of strain economically impractical in industry settings. In the absence of solder joint level strains, PCB level strains adjacent to a solder joint are measured as an indicator in accordance with IPC/JEDEC 9704 [49]. For all strain measurements, linear strain gage CEA-06-125UN-350 and triaxial strain gage C2A-06-031WW-350, both from Vishay Precision Group, were used. Strain was measured with National Instruments NI-9237 strain blocks and bridge excitation voltage of 5.0 volts was used to maximize signal to noise ratio. The frequency of strain

measurements was 5000 Hz and custom software written in Labview was used to control the hardware. For a rectangular rosette, the principal strains were calculated as per equation 3-1.

, = 

The principal strain angles were calculated as per 3-2.

Equation 3-2 returns the minimum or maximum principal strain angle because tan 2 = tan (2 + 90). Further data reduction is needed to determine more information about (1­3) to properly determine the maximum principal strain angle [50]. 27

Strain rates were calculated by applying signal windows with a length of 60 data points consecutively over the strain response. determined by least squares method. 3.2.4 Daisy Chain Continuity The electrical continuity of a BGA component can be used to monitor the integrity integr of the conductive paths. Typically this is done through a Daisy Chain and for a BGA The conductive path The strain rate of each window was

alternates between the BGA and the PCB so failure at either will cause an open circuit. Figure 20 shows a schematic of a daisy chain in a BGA component with a power supply (V) and voltmeter (VM).

Figure 20: Daisy Chain Circuit

The power supply provides a cons constant tant current power source and the measured voltage across the conductive path is divided by the current to calculate the resistance (Resistance = Volt / Current).

28

For all experiments, a constant current of 0.1 amps with 5.0 V peak was applied to the daisy chain circuit by a HP 6632A power supply and daisy chain resistance was measured with NI-9239 A/D converter. Custom software written in Labview was used to control the measurements and daisy chain resistance was calculated by dividing the applied voltage by 0.1 amps to get resistance of the circuit. A resistance increase of 20% was considered an electrical failure. 3.2.5 Dye and Pry for detection of Pad-Crater failure The process of finding pad-crater cracks involves submerging a PCBA in Dykem Steel Red Layout Fluid and cycling in a vacuum chamber to 27 mmHg (3.6 kPa) vacuum. The applied vacuum draws air out, and liquid into any existing crack. After the vacuum cycle, the PCBA is placed in an oven at 60oC for 30 minutes to dry the dye to the PCBA. The BGA component is then removed by prying it away from the PCB. The drawbacks

of this process are that the pry event is violent and causes significant damage to the PCB, the crack must have had access to the liquid during the vacuum process, and the crack must have existed on a 2D plane that is visible after the pry event. For all of its

drawbacks, dye and pry is a widely used process for detecting pad-crater defects in the electronics industry.

3.3 PCB Laminate Properties & Characteristics
3.3.1 Tensile Properties of PCB Laminate The tensile properties were measured as per ASTM standard D638M--10, Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Plastics [51], with dumb bell coupons as shown in Figure 21 and corresponding dimensions shown in Table 2.

The dumb bell coupons were cut from test PCBs so there is resin, E E-glass glass and copper present as shown in Figure 15 15. Cross-head head speed was 5 mm / min and tests were run to 2000 µ. 3.3.2 Micro-indentation indentation Hardness The micro-indentation indentation of PCB boards was made in accordance with E 384-10, 384 Standard Test Method for Micro Micro-indentation Hardness of Materials [52 52]. A Buehler

Micromet ® 5103 103 was used to apply an indento indentor r force of 10 grams with a test duration of 10 seconds, a protocol used by other investigators [7]. measured a minimum of 32 times. The samples amples were prepared from test boards by cutting away portions of the boards adjacent to the BGA signal pads. The samples were then potted and ground with Leco 1 µm diamond grit (part number 810 810-870) 870) to remove the solder mask and expose the resin. Care was as taken to ensure the grit did not contain any water which might have Each PCB laminate was

Figure 22: Buttercoat thickness schematic

The thickness of the buttercoat--the resin rich layer between the first layer of E-glass weave and the top of the PCB--was measured as the minimum distance between the tow and the top of the board as shown in Figure 22. The tow dimensions a, b and f were measured as the distance between the outermost E-glass strand, even if it was slightly separated from the tow.

Chapter 4: Results, Analysis and Discussions

4.1 PCB Laminate Properties
4.1.1 Young's Modulus (E) Results A probability plot of the Young's modulus (E) for all PCB laminates is shown in Figure 23. E was determined by secant method because the stress-strain curve was not linear for all tests.

Figure 23: Probability Plot of Young's Modulus

Points at 250 µ and 2000 µ were used for the secant method because they represent the failing range for all PCB laminates. Figure 23 shows the normal probability plots with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of all E values with mean, standard deviation, sample size, Anderson Darling, and P values shown. The minimum sample size of five

was reached for all samples as per ASTM D638-10 [51].

32

4.1.2 Young's Modulus (E) Analysis The PCB laminate with the lowest mean E value was J at 20.08 GPa, and it was the third most resistance laminate to pad-crater. PCB Laminate A and D had highest E values of 23.68 GPa and 25.47 GPa respectively, and they represent two of the three least resistant laminates to pad-crater. Two sample t-test shows that PCB laminates A and D are statistically different from the other laminates to a confidence level of 0.05. PCB Laminate B, the most resistant to pad-crater, had an E value of 21.53 GPa, which is almost identical to the second worst performing laminate G at 21.12 GPa. The measured E values for the test coupons include the plated copper from the PCB. The theoretical E of the PCB laminate only can be calculated as follows [54]:

 =  +  

 =  (  +   ) 

4-1

Where P is load, A is area, E is Young's modulus, and  is elongation. By rearranging terms of equation 4-1, the E of the PCB laminate can be calculated:



 -    = 

4-2

The E values for the PCB laminate were calculated with the assumption that the copper in the PCB has a Young's modulus of 100 GPa [46] and the thickness of the PCB laminate equaled the measured thickness minus the nominal copper thickness. The normal probability plots of all theoretical E values are shown in Figure 24 with 95% CIs. The order of PCB laminate E values did not change with the removal of the copper. PCB laminate D showed the largest variation in E values with a standard deviation of

33

1.221 GPa. In Figure 24, the samples from the same PCB have been circled with like lines for PCB laminate D.

Most notable is the * samples from the same PCB with Young's Modulus values that range from 15.2 to 18.8 GPa. For these samples, the thickness ranged from 2.3 mm This variation in sample To further

investigate the variation of PCB laminate D results, load vs. strain curves for all tests and probability plots of peak load were plotted and are shown in Figure 25 and Figure 26. As can be seen from these figures, there is little variation between the samples as shown by the load vs. strain curves and the normal distribution of the peak loads. Consequently, the high E values of PCB laminate D are real and not the results of dimensional variation of the samples.

34

Figure 25: Load vs. Strain of Young's Modulus Tests, PCB Laminate D

Figure 26: Normal Probability plot of peak load to 2000 µ of PCB laminate D

The PCB laminate with the highest E value, laminate D, was also the only PPO resin blend. A relationship between PCBA level strain and Young's modulus can be reasoned by considering two PCB laminates of Young's Modulus values of E1 and E2, where E1 >> E2 . For the E2 laminate, the presence of the BGA provides a significant increase in 35

stiffness which forces the deformation to outside the BGA. The increased stiffness in the BGA area keeps the combined BGA/PCB section relatively flat, which makes radius RE2 small.

Figure 27: Spherical Bend for E1 and E2 (E1 >> E2)

The relationship between surface strain and the bend radius of a plate or beam is inverse (   1 / radius of curvature). Conversely, for E1 laminate where the BGA does not provide a significant increase in stiffness, the bend radius inside and outside the BGA shadow area would be closer in value, and as a consequence, larger. This

relationship between radius of curvature and PCB E values is illustrated in Figure 27. For the three laminates that had LVDT measurements of board deflection, a comparison of strain slopes can be made. The PCBA level strain as a function of

displacement was determined by least squares linear regression for PCB laminates D, G and M. The R2 for all linear regression was > 97%, showing the model is a good fit. The normal probability plot with 95% CI of slope values (µ / mm) is shown in Figure 28. As the figure shows, PCB laminate D is statistically different than G and M.

36

Figure 28: PCB Laminate D, G & M Slope (µ / mm deflection)

Figure 29: 95% Confidence Interval of PCB Laminate D, G & M mean µ / mm slope vs. mean E

A plot of the 95% confidence intervals of the average µ / mm slope vs. average E value for PCB laminate D, G and M is shown in Figure 29. As can be seen from this plot, there is clearly an inverse correlation between the µ / mm slope vs. PCB laminate average E. This inverse correlation confirms the reduced radius of curvature at the strain gage location for PCB laminates with lower E values. 37

4.2 Spherical Bend Test
For the spherical bend testing, pure laminate G10, bare PCB, and PCBAs were tested. The G10 pure laminate is a plain weave laminate without any copper or vias present. Two bare PCBs from the six test PCB laminates were reflowed without PCBAs from each test laminate were tested to

component attached and bend tested.

determine fail free, mixed fail, and all fail zones. Finally, the Weibull analysis of all six PCBA pad-crater results was performed. All testing was performed at 3.81 mm / sec cross head speed. For pure laminate and bare PCB, cross-head travel was 1.0 mm. 4.2.1 Pure Laminate 4.2.1.1 Test Set-up

The strain gage layout for the G10 board is shown in Figure 30.

Figure 30: Laminate Strain Gage Layout with strain channels and gage numbers

The strain gages were placed 32 mm from the center of the board. Lines of symmetry for fixture orientation have been added to Figure 30 to show the strain gage location relative to pin supports. In order to investigate whether or not the eight support pins

38

can be modeled as a simple continuous support, tests were conducted at 0o and 22.5o sample orientation as shown in Figure 31.

Figure 31: 0 and 22.5 sample orientation

4.2.1.2

Pure laminate Results

Figure 32 shows the max principal strain (PS) angle of gage 1 (123) and gage 2 (456) vs. displacement, and as can be seen from the plot, the PS angle asymptotically approaches the circumferential strain direction (0° for gage 1, and 90° for gage 2).

Figure 32: Max Principal Strain angle of 123 and 456 for pure laminate

39

For the 22.5° sample orientation, both gages initially show more variation from the  direction.

Figure 33: Pure Laminate Spherical Bend Test Comparison of strain (gage 1) and load vs. displacement at 0°and 22.5°

Figure 34: Pure Laminate Spherical Bend Test Comparison of strain (gage 2) and load vs. displacement at 0°and 22.5°

Figure 33 and Figure 34 show gage 1 and 2 strain responses vs. displacement for 0° and 22.5° sample orientation. Comparison of the responses shows that in general, the magnitude of gage 2 (456) is less than gage 1 (123) for both sample orientations.

40

The variation in strain response is almost negligible for gage 2 between sample orientations, but for gage 1, it is considerable, especially at 3. This could be the result of slight differences in the distance in the gages from the center of the applied load, and errors in gage placement. The more likely reason is reduction in stiffness Q for orthotropic material from on-axis to off-axis orientation. Note that gage 2's axes are aligned to the plain weave, and gage 1's bisects the plain weave. 4.2.1.3 Pure Laminate Analysis

The maximum and minimum principal strains are shown in Figure 35 for 0° and 22.5° sample orientation.

Figure 35: PS max and PS min vs. displacement for Pure Laminate

In both orientations, gage 1 (123) response is larger than gage 2 (456), despite the fact that both gages are the same distance from the center of the G10 sample. Transformation of in-plane stiffness for orthotropic materials can be calculated by equation 4-3 [55].

41

 =    +   + 2   + 4  
Where m = cos() and n = sin().

4-3

A complete set of material properties for G10 was unavailable so for comparison purposes, FR4 published properties were used to calculate the transformation of stiffness for orthotropic material and the results are shown in Figure 36 [25]. The on-

axis stiffness varies from 20.8 GPa at 0° to 19.5 GPa at 45°. This reduction in stiffness can explain the increased response of gage 1 since 1 and 3 are oriented at 45° to the direction of weave.

Figure 36: Transformation of stiffness for plain weave laminates

Plain weave laminate can be treated as an isotropic material due to the balanced nature of its properties [45]. Equations 4-4, 4-5, and 4-6 are the theoretical

displacement, radial, and circumferential stress for a simply supported circular plate

42

with a concentrated load at the center [56]. A poisson ratio equal to 0.34 was used for these calculations [47]. The distance from the neutral axis is z, the distance from

center of the plate is r, and a is the radius of the support. These equations are based on the assumption that there is zero shear and are applicable for plates with small transverse displacements.

Inspection of equations 4-5 and 4-6 reveals the only difference between the two equations is the (1-) term in 4-6 which ensures that  is always greater in magnitude than r. Since  and r are mutually orthogonal, maximum PS angle will always be in the  direction. This result is confirmed by the PS angle results previously shown in Figure 32. A comparison of theoretical and measured values using the above equations for gages 1 and 2 is shown in Table 3. Theoretical values in the Table 3 were As Table 3 shows, there is

  3+  = 2     +   ( -   ) 16  1+ 3   =  1 +       3   =  1 +     + 1 -

good agreement between theoretical and measured strain values for µ at gage 2. The percentage difference for r at gage 2 is consistent at -14% and -12% for 0° and 22.5° orientation. For gage 1, there is a significant error for , especially at 22.5° orientation. The increased error is likely due to increase radius of curvature when the gage is located between two support pins. This increased radius of curvature can also help to explain the reduction in r error from 19% to 9% between 0° and 22.5° 43

orientation at gage 2.

The positive difference in µr at gage 1 and negative difference

at gage 2 can also be explained by variation in G10 stiffness shown in Figure 36.

4.2.2 Bare PCB Spherical Bend Test at Sample Orientation 0° and 22.5° 4.2.2.1 Test Set-up

Bare board response of the PCB was investigated with two rosette strain gages as shown in Figure 37 for PCB laminate A and B.

Figure 37: Bare PCB Strain Gage Layout

Placement of gage 1 was identical to the placement of all PCBA testing and the gage 2 was on the bottom side of the PCB at the edge of the BGA shadow. Testing of gage 1 at sample orientation 0° and 22.5° and gage 1 and 2 at 0° was performed. Comparison 44

of the response of gage 1 at sample orientation 0° and 22.5° is presented.

Also,

comparison of gage 1 and gage 2 responses to theoretical values is presented at sample orientation 0°. 4.2.2.2 Results and analysis for sample orientation 0 and 22.5 for gage 1

The strain and max PS angle responses for PCB laminate A and B are shown Figure 38 and Figure 39 respectively for gage 1.

Figure 38: Comparison of rosette strain gage 1 for 0° and 22.5° fixture orientation, PCB Laminate A

As can be seen for both fixture orientations, the PS max angle for gage 1 is in the  direction (-45). PCB laminate A shows a consistent difference in strain response at This could be due

gages 1 and 3 for both orientations and PCB laminate B does not.

to differences in material properties in the warp and fill direction for PCB laminate A. PCB Laminate B (Figure 39) shows bilinear behaviour with the diagonal strain initially being negative, and the change in response occurs at roughly 0.12 mm deflection. Laminate B is the best performing laminate and this initially negative strain could apply

45

less stress to the corner BGA solder joints.

For both laminates, there is negligible

difference in the magnitude of strain response for either fixture orientation.

sample orientation Using equations 4-4, 4-5, and 4-6, the theoretical strain at gage locations 1 and 2 were calculated using the mean Young's modulus test values for PCB laminate A and B. All calculations were made assuming the same material properties inside and outside the BGA shadow area. Load input value P for equation 4-4 was taken from LVDT load measurements to determine theoretical displacements. The measured  were

calculated by transformation of rectangular rosette strains 1, 2 and 3 by equation 4-7 [57].

Plots of theoretical and measured strain responses vs. displacement for PCB laminate A and B are shown in Figure 40 and Figure 41, and a summary of peak responses is shown Table 4.

Comparison of theoretical and measured deflections for input force shows good agreement with laminate A, but B shows a -14% difference. For gage 1 on both

laminates, measured  is larger than the theoretical and measured r is lower than the theoretical. This suggests the r response of the weakened BGA shadow area is not balancing the  response as happened with the G10 material. The theoretical solution is not sufficient to describe the response of the bare PCB with a weakened BGA shadow area. For gage 2, both PCB laminate A and B r responses become non-linear, with laminate B's r being initially bilinear. This results in a percentage difference of -118% and -200% between the theoretical and measured values for laminate A and B respectively.

Figure 41: Laminate B bare board, theoretical & measured strain vs. load, gage (1) & (2)

The  responses are linear at gage 2 for both A and B, but the theoretical values are smaller than the measured values. There are likely two phenomena contributing to the non-linear responses: material non-linearity of the laminate and geometric non-linearity of square BGA shadow area in spherical bend.

Only one rosette is required to determine PS angle at corner A1 due to PCBA symmetry. Sample strain and max PS angle responses are shown in Figure 43 and strain rates in Figure 44 for one test on PCB laminate D. These responses are typical of all tests that were performed on the six test laminates.

The negative values represent suspensions and the positive values represent failures. BGA corners that did not fail were considered as suspensions and treated as such for calculation of  and  values of the two parameter Weibull distribution. Waloddi

Weibull's original derivation of the Weibull distribution was premised on the idea that if a system is considered to be a series of chain links and any link in the chain fails, then 51

the system has failed. In such a system, if P represents the probability of one link failing, we can let Pn represent the probability of failure of any link in the chain. Conversely, (1-Pn) or (1-P)n represents the probability of none of the chain links failing [58]. Using this weakest chain link premise, Weibull stated that if 1-Pn = e-n (x) then

all that is required to do is define a function  (x) [58]. Weibull's original CDF is shown in equation 4-8 [58]:

referred to as characteristic life),  is the shape parameter, and x represents the time to failure. The Weibull distribution, due to its derivation, represents the failing distribution of the weakest links in a system [58, 59]. Time x) may be revolutions of a bearing,

strain, hours of operation, kilometers traveled, among others. Equation 4-8 represents the three parameter Weibull distribution and for this paper, the two parameter which removes the delay parameter from the CDF as shown in equation 4-9 was used to analyze failing strain at BGA corners.

Rearranging the CDF shown in equation 4-9 results in equation 4-10 as shown below and provides a method to linearize the Weibull distribution:

Before using the Weibull distribution, the following must be noted:

1. F(x) is the median rank (MR) of the position of a failure in the distribution.

MR

is calculated by finding the most likely position of the failure by setting the cumulative binomial distribution equal to 0.50 and solving for MR [60]. 2. This method for ranking the failures automatically ensures some correlation since failures are ordered from shortest to longest time to failure. Because of this, higher correlation values are required for Weibull. 3. Although there is no mathematical derivation proving the applicability of the Weibull distribution, it is widely used because it works well, especially in life data analysis [61]. For the Weibull analysis of failing and surviving strains, the suspensions were accounted for when calculating median rank position in the distribution. Whether or

not to include suspensions is sometimes debated, but this author sides with those who believe that the suspensions are part of the total population and to not account for them results in the characteristic life () being underestimated. the x-axis (RRX) was used with Type I (time) confidence bounds. Figure 45 shows the probability plots (strain vs. unreliability) of all PCB laminates. The probability plot shows the Weibull distribution is a good fit for the failure data. For linear regression, the correlation coefficient () shows the strength of a relationship between two variables and ranges in value from -1 to 1. The closer  is to -1 or 1, the stronger the relation. Rank Regression on

Since there are two parameters,  and , in the Weibull distribution, confidence intervals are a function of these two parameters.

As the figure shows, PCB laminate B has a much higher  value than the other laminates. The  values represent the 62.3% failure of the population and should correlate well to a PCB laminate's resistance to pad-crater. 54

Table 7 shows the B0.1 lives for all laminates, and Figure 47 shows a graphical representation of Table 7. As can be seen from Figure 47, PCB laminate B is still the best performer, but at lower strain levels the difference is much smaller.

4.2.6 PCBA Strain Energy The energy to displace the PCBA is calculated using equation 4-11 11, where F is applied force by the load transducer, and d is the displacement of the PCBA as measured by independent linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT). (LVDT)

The strain energy of deflection is the sum of all the energy terms from equation 4-11 as shown in equation 4-12.

PCBA for one test of each laminate. Laminate B and A's E values were measured to be 21.53 and 23.68 GPa respectively, and their nominal B0.1 0.1 lives were 1168 µ µ and 533 56

µ respectively. As can be seen from the plot, the laminate with the higher E value requires more energy to displace.

Figure 48: Strain energy of bare PCB and PCBA displacement, Laminate A & B

A comparison of difference in strain energy with and without BGA component for laminate A and B is shown in Figure 49. As can be seen in Figure 49, the additional stiffness the presence of the BGA adds to the two PCBs with different E values is almost identical. This suggests that the strain energy is driven primarily by the area outside of the BGA shadow.

4.3 Micro-Indentation Hardness
4.3.1 Test Results A sample micro-indentation is shown in Figure 50 and although the indentation may be difficult to see, when viewed through the microscope, the corners of the indentation are easily determined. Statistical analysis of all micro-hardness showed

that the three parameter Weibull distribution was the best fitting across all the testing as determined by the correlation coefficient . The , , , and  results for all

hardness testing are shown in Table 8. The three parameter Weibull distribution may seem unlikely, but there are some underlying reasons it works well including the presence of filler in the resin and the undulation of the E-glass fabric weave which may affect results.

The three parameter Weibull probability plot of all hardness testing is shown in Figure 51 with the three most and least pad crater resistant laminates highlighted. As

can be seen from the plot, the three parameter Weibull distribution fits the data well and the better performing laminates have lower  values.

The effect of ceramic fillers on the hardness measurements is unknown, but it is conceivable that if the Vicker's indentor pushed directly onto a ceramic particle, the measurement would be affected. All laminates had either values excluded from the

measurements because they were outliers, or were bimodal. The reason for this is presently unknown, but given the undulation of the tows of the fabric weave, it is possible that the higher values are due to the VH indentor contacting the fabric weave resulting in artificially small indentation which results in higher hardness values. Figure 53 shows histogram plot of Laminate J with normal distribution overlaid.

4.4 Tow a Measurements
4.4.1 Results The normal probability plots with 95% CIs of tow dimension a (see Figure 22) in both warp and fill direction are shown in Figure 55 and Figure 56 respectively. PCB laminate J is the most distinct from all test laminates because it has the smallest mean tow a dimension in both warp and fill direction at 132.1 µm and 250.1 µm respectively, and it is the third most resistant to pad crater. Comparison of the most and least padcrater resistant laminates B and D shows there is no correlation to tow a. In the fill direction, laminate B and D have mean a values of 413.3 µm and 347.6 µm respectively. In the warp direction, laminate B and D have mean a values of 198.9 µm and 216.9µm respectively. Laminate B and D have larger tow a in both warp and fill directions than J, yet they represent the best and worst performers. 62

4.5 Buttercoat thickness
4.5.1 Results and Analysis Figure 61 shows the one standard deviation interval plot of all laminates in order of least to most resistance to pad-crater from left to right. As the figure shows, there is no relationship between buttercoat thickness and susceptibility to pad-crater. Laminate J was the only laminate to have unspread glass as indicated by it having the lowest tow

a dimension in the fill and warp direction. Research has shown spread glass showed a

65

50% reduction in 1080 glass weave thickness as compared with unspread glass weave. [39]. The reduced thickness of E-glass weave should correlate into thicker buttercoat, or conversely, a thin buttercoat for unspread glass. This result is confirmed by PCB laminate J's thin buttercoat.

4.6 Correlation of Young's Modulus & VH to laminate susceptibility to PadCrater
This section presents linear regression analysis of all measurements made to susceptibility to pad crater. 4.6.1 Results and Analysis Least squares regression analysis of mean E values for laminate only vs.  (B62.3%) VH values is shown in Figure 62. The correlation () between mean E and  VH is 0.636, and R2 is 40.5% for the linear regression. Given that all the boards were made

66

from the same stack-up, up, the only variable between t the he laminates is the resin. This suggests mean E and  VH values are not necessarily correlated.

Figure 62: : Scatter plot with regression of E vs.  (eta) VH

Figure 63 shows the scatter plot with least squares linear regression for nominal  (B62.3%) and B0.1% strain lives vs.  (B62.3%) VH for each PCB laminate. laminate The  is

-0.885 and the R2 is 72.9% for nominal strain  vs. VH . For B0.1% strain lives vs.  VH, the R2 is 55.2% and  is -0.801. Clearly the relationship between  strain lives vs.

VH  is better. The inverse relation  strain lives and VH  suggests that decreasing the VH of the buttercoat translates as less susceptibility to pad-crater crater under monotonic spherical bend.

Chapter 5: Conclusions Pad-crater has been an unintended consequence of an environmental initiative which has made critical the understanding of base material properties and their susceptibility to pad-crater. It has also necessitated a better fundamental

understanding of a PCB laminate's response to spherical bend. For the materials studied: · There is no correlation between Young's Modulus (E) and susceptibility to padcrater. · Comparison of µ / mm of deflection slopes under spherical bend showed an inverse relationship between PCB mean laminate E and slope values. · Spherical bend of pure laminate as per IPC/JEDEC 9707 [23] cannot be idealized as a point load on a simple circularly supported plate with the assumption of isotropic material properties. Test results showed the orthotropic nature of the laminate affects the strain response. · Spherical bend of bare PCB as per IPC/JEDEC 9707 [23] cannot be idealized as a point load on a simply circularly supported plate. Measurements inside and

outside the BGA shadow area show material and geometric non-linearities at work. The weakened area of the BGA shadow must be accounted for when

modeling. · There were no electrical opens on any PCBA spherical bend test confirming that pad-crater precedes electrical failure.

69

·

When PCB surface strains at a BGA corner are assumed to indicate solder joint strains under spherical bend, the two parameter Weibull distribution fits the failure data well.

·

Comparison of strain energy for bare PCB and PCBA subjected to spherical bend showed the additional stiffness a BGA adds to a PCB is almost identical when comparing two laminates of different E values. Put another way, strain energy is driven primarily by the PCB area outside the BGA shadow.

·

Three parameter Weibull distribution is the best distribution for Vicker's hardness values of PCB laminate resin (buttercoat).

·

There is no correlation between laminate susceptibility to pad-crater and tow a dimension or buttercoat thickness. Laminate J, the coarsest E-glass weave,

showed that pad-crater can travel through openings in the weave. · · Spread glass weaves result in thicker buttercoat. The R2 values for least squares linear regression of  (B62.3%) VH vs. mean E equaled 40.5%. The correlation  between these same variables was 0.636.

The low R2 suggests there is insufficient evidence of a linear relationship between  VH and mean E. · Linear regression of  (B62.3%) strain lives vs.  (B62.3%) VH had a  of -0.885 and R2 of 72.9%. Linear regression of B0.1% strain lives vs.  VH had R2 of The relationship between  strain lives and  VH is

55.2% and  = -0.801.

better and suggests reducing the hardness of the resin increases a PCB laminate's resistance to pad-crater.
