Abstract RECENT ADVANCES TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENANTIO- AND DIASTEREOSELECTIVE PALLADIUM CATALYZED NITROGEN ARYLATION REACTIONS by Augusto Matarazzo Molecular Science Master of Science, Ryerson University, 2011

A non-commercially available ligand, (R)-2(Dicyclohexylphosphino)-2'-methoxy-1,1'binaphthyl), (R)-Cy2MOP, has been synthesized and demonstrated to be very effective in the palladium catalyzed intramolecular desymmetrization of di-nitrogen malonamides. Additionally an enantio- and diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction has been developed through the desymmetrization of 2-(2-bromobenzyl)-N1,N 3-bis(2-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-2-methylmalonamide using palladium/Cy2MOP as the catalyst system to produce N,1-bis(2-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-3methyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-3-carboxamide in excellent yield, with high enantioand diastereoselectivity (99 %, 88 % ee). This serves as the first example of its kind whereby an enantio- and diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction occurs in a single step from the preferential N-arylation of prochiral di-nitrogen malonamides. Application of the palladium/Cy2MOP catalyst system in the intramolecular desymmetrization reaction also resulted in the formation of six membered ring benzomorpholinone and seven membered ring benzodiazepineone heterocycles. Furthermore several synthetic routes towards the synthesis of five membered ring oxindoles are thoroughly discussed. Lastly the synthesis of a precatalyst was also attempted using Cy2MOP and Pd(II)Me2TMEDA.

1 Introduction 1.1 Stereochemistry Stereochemistry is a branch of chemistry that deals with the three dimensional structure of molecules.1 Stereoisomers are isomers that have the same connectivity but differ in their three dimensional orientation.1 1.1.1 Chirality A molecule is said to be chiral if it is nonsuperimposable on its mirror image.2 An example of a chiral molecule is shown in figure 1.

Figure 1: The two enantiomers of 2-bromobutane A molecule can possess three different types of stereogenic elements: a chiral centre, chiral axis or chiral plane. 1.1.1.1 Central chirality The presence of a tetrahedral carbon atom attached to four different groups usually makes a molecule chiral.1 The carbon atom which is attached to the four different groups is called a chiral carbon or a chiral centre.1 An example of a molecule that exhibits this type of chirality is shown in figure 1. 1.1.1.2 Axial Chirality Axial chirality results from the non planar arrangement of four groups in pairs about a chiral axis.3 A chiral axis can be generated due to restricted rotation around a single bond, pi bonds or rings and is usually observed in allenes, biphenyls and binaphthyls.3 Some examples of axial chirality are shown in figure 2. 1

Figure 2: Axial Chirality

1.1.1.3 Planar Chirality Planar chirality results from the arrangement of out of plane groups with respect to a plane.3 The most common class of molecules that possess chiral planes are bridged aromatic molecules3 in which a linker-chain, extending above or below the chiral plane, restricts rotation in the molecule. An example of a molecule exhibiting planar chirality is shown in figure 3.

Figure 3: Planar Chirality

1.1.2 Stereoisomerism Stereoisomers are isomers that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms but differ in the three dimensional orientation of their atoms in space.1 Stereoisomers can be subdivided into two classes: enantiomers and diastereomers. 1.1.2.1 Enantiomers Enantiomers are a pair of stereoisomers that are nonsuperimposable mirror images.1 An example of a pair of enantiomers is shown in figure 1. The chemical properties of enantiomers are identical when reacting with achiral molecules and differ when reacting with chiral molecules, 2

i.e. a reaction that forms enantiomers from achiral starting material will form a racemic mixture of enantiomers unless there is some chiral influence on the reaction (for example a chiral catalyst).1 The physical properties of enantiomers are identical except for the direction in which they rotate plane polarized light.1 1.1.2.2 Diastereomers Diastereomers are a special type of stereoisomer that are not mirror images of each other but differ in their spatial arrangement of atoms.1 Diastereomers often have different chemical reactions and different physical properties.1 Furthermore some reactions produce only one diastereomer and not the other and some reactions only occur with one diastereomer and not the other.1 Diastereomers can be divided into two categories: cis-trans stereoisomers, i.e. the stereoisomers differ in the placement of groups on one side or the other of a double bond (see figure 4), and stereoisomers with multiple stereogenic elements, i.e. two chiral centers, a chiral center and a chiral axis, a chiral centre and a chiral plane, etc. (see figure 5).1

Figure 5: Diastereomers of ephedrine 1.1.3 Stereoselective Reactions Stereoselective reactions can be broadly defined as reactions that favor the production of one enantiomer or diastereomer over another.2 Stereoselective reactions include enantioselective reactions and diastereoselective reactions. The enantiomeric excess is a measure of how much of an excess of one enantiomer is in a mixture of enantiomers and is calculated using the equation shown in figure 6 (presuming, in this case, that the (R)-enantiomer is the major product).

! Reaction 1.2 The Buchwald ­ Hartwig

The Buchwald-Hartwig reaction is a palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of an aryl halide with a nitrogen nucleophile resulting in the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond.4-12 This reaction is a very useful synthetic tool for the construction of arylamines. A general Buchwald-Hartwig reaction is shown in figure 6.

Figure 7: A General Buchwald-Hartwig reaction

In 1995 both Buchwald and Hartwig independently reported the intermolecular coupling of aryl halides with secondary amines using a small amount of palladium, a base and P(o-Tol)3 as a ligand (scheme 1).13,14

Scheme 1: Intermolecular coupling of aryl halides with secondary amines 1.2.1 Mechanism of the Buchwald ­ Hartwig Reaction The mechanism of the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction has been extensively studied and is well understood.15-20 A general mechanism of the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction is shown in scheme 2. Upon formation of the active palladium(0) complex, palladium inserts into the carbon halogen bond in a step called oxidative addition. Palladium then coordinates to the nitrogen atom of the amine and ligand exchange occurs with bromine, a base is also added to alleviate the positive

5

charge generated on nitrogen. The last step of the cycle is a reductive elimination which produces the coupled product and regenerates the catalyst thus enabling the cycle to repeat.

Scheme 2: General mechanism of the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction 1.2.2 Chiral Bisphosphine Ligands in the Buchwald-Hartwig Reaction In these early experiments, especially when P(o-Tol)3 was used as a ligand both Buchwald and Hartwig reported a significant amount of by-products arising from !-hydride elimination (scheme 2, bottom left). Soon after in 1996 Buchwald demonstrated that the amount of byproducts could be substantially reduced by employing Pd2(dba)3

(tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0))/BINAP as the catalyst system (scheme 3a).21 Similarly in 1998, Hartwig also reported a reduction in !-hydride elimination products by using a ferrocene based racemic, chiral, bulky, electron-rich phosphine ligand (scheme 3b).22

Scheme 3b: Incorporation of chiral bisphosphine ligands in the Buchwald/Hartwig reaction Although many of the ligands used in these transformations are chiral, only a few groups have tried to exploit the chirality of the ligand to develop an enantioselective variant of the BuchwaldHartwig reaction.

1.2.3 Retention of Chirality in Buchwald-Hartwig Reactions Palladium-catalyzed intermolecular and intramolecular coupling of amines with aryl halides has proven to be an efficient method for the synthesis of various aniline derivatives.23 In a paper written by Wagaw et al. enantiomerically enriched aniline derivatives were prepared by coupling aryl bromides with enantiomerically enriched amines (scheme 4a).23 The authors also report the intramolecular coupling of amines with aryl halides as shown in scheme 4b.

Scheme 4a: intermolecular coupling of an amine with an aryl halide

Scheme 4b: intramolecular coupling of an amine with an aryl halide

It is important to note that a new chiral centre is not formed in the products of the above reactions, the original stereochemistry is retained.

In a paper written by Frost & Mendonca, palladium catalyzed arylation of amines is used to selectively prepare various mono-N-arylated, enantiopure diamine ligands.24 The catalytic crosscoupling of enantiopure amines with aryl bromides using Pd(0)/dppf (dppf=1,1'-

bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) or Pd(0)/BINAP (2,2'-Bis(N-diphenylphosphinoamino-1,1'binaphthyl) produces products in moderate yields with no loss of enantiopurity.24 The use of BINAP as a ligand resulted in a considerable increase in yield.24 An example of the crosscoupling of (1R,2R)-(!)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane with an aryl bromide is shown in scheme 5.

Scheme 5: Enantiopure mono-N-arylation of (1R,2R)-(!)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane

1.2.4 Enantioselective Buchwald-Hartwig Reactions 1.2.4.1 Kinetic Resolution The first example of an enantioselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction was reported by Rossen and Pye in which the authors demonstrated kinetic resolution of planar chiral bromides (scheme 6).25

9

Scheme 6: Kinetic resolution of racemic planar chiral bromides The catalyst system employed in these reactions was palladium/(S)-PHANEPHOS. Although the cross-coupling reaction produced a variety of products, i.e. mono-aminated, di-aminated, debrominated, mono-aminated de-brominated, no efforts were made to recover these products. The authors were interested in the unreacted di-bromide starting material and when they determined the enantiomeric excess (ee) of this starting material they discovered that a kinetic resolution had taken place. The (R)-dibromide proved to be a poorer substrate for the (S)-PHANEPHOS palladium catalyst complex with the (S) isomer of the dibromide reacting 3-4 times faster. Addition of the halide scavenger TlPF6 resulted in an increase in selectivity with the (S)dibromide reacting 10-13 times faster than the (R) isomer. When the reaction was pushed to 79 % conversion this led to a 21 % recovery of the (R)-dibromide with a 93 % ee.

10

Another early example illustrating an enatioselective intermolecular Buchwald-Hartwig reaction via kinetic resolution was reported by Kocovsky et al.26 The authors demonstrated partial kinetic resolution of racemic axially chiral amines using palladium/(S)-BINAP as the catalyst system. When the amino alcohol NOBIN (scheme 7a) was used as a coupling partner with bromobenzene, preferential arylation of the (R)-enantiomer resulted in a 27 % ee at 35 % conversion and an 11 % ee at 60 % conversion (scheme 7a). Similarly the cross-coupling reaction of a binaphthyl diamine BINAM (scheme 7b) with bromobenzene also resulted in preferential arylation of the (R)-enantiomer with 17 % ee at 45 % conversion and 10 % ee at 70 % conversion for the monoarylated product (scheme 7b). In these reactions the (R)-amino alcohol/diamine is a better substrate for the palladium/(S)-BINAP catalyst complex.

Scheme 7b: Kinetic resolution of a racemic axially chiral diamine

A more recent example of an enantioselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction involving kinetic resolution of amines was reported by Ohta et al.27 The authors employed palladium/(S)-TolBINAP as the catalyst system for the kinetic resolution of 1-(1-napthyl)ethylamine which furnished the arylated product in good yield and relatively high selectivity, 70 % yield and 80 % ee respectively (scheme 8). Although the selectivity of the reaction is good it should be noted that 19 equivalents of racemic amine and 8.4 equivalents of a crown ether additive were required.

Scheme 8: Kinetic resolution of optically active aniline derivatives 12

In 2005 Bräse et al. reported the first example of a diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction through coupling of racemic [2.2]paracyclophane bromide with (S)-1-phenylethylamine.28 The catalyst system employed was palladium/(Sp,R)-Walphos 1 which furnished the desired product in excellent yield and diastereoselectivity, 92 % yield, 86 % de (scheme 9). Additionally since the authors use half an equivalent of amine relative to the racemic [2.2]paracyclophane bromide a kinetic resolution also takes place when (S)-1-phenylethylamine is used resulting in the excess diastereomer with configuration (Rp,S) and the excess (S)-enantiomer of [2.2]paracyclophane bromide, making the reaction enantioselective as well as diastereoselective (scheme 9).

Scheme 9: Enantio- and diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction

13

1.2.4.2 Chiral plane Formation A more recent example of an enantioselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction involving planar chirality was reported by Ranyuk et al. where the authors were successful in coupling 1,5dichloroanthraquinone with dioxadiamine to produce an azamacrocycle (scheme 10a).29 Palladium/Josiphos SL-J002-1 was the catalyst system used and the corresponding azamacrocycle was obtained in 31 % yield and 60 % ee. Recrystallization of the mixture of enantiomers from dichloromethane/petroleum ether resulted in an enantiopure azamacrocycle in 19 % yield.

Scheme 10a: Azamacrocycle synthesis via enantioselective Buchwald-Hartwig amination

The authors followed up on this work and again were successful in coupling 1,5dichloroanthraquinone with trioxadiamine using Palladium/Josiphos SL-J002-1 to produce the 14

corresponding azamacrocycles in 27 % yield and 58 % ee (scheme 10b).29 However in this case the azamacrocycle could not be recrystallized to enantiopurity but rather 88 % ee in 11 % yield.

Scheme 10b: Azamacrocycle synthesis via enantioselective Buchwald-Hartwig amination

Next the authors investigated the coupling of 1,5-dichloroanthracene with dioxadiamine. Again palladium/Josiphos SL-J002-1 was the ideal catalyst system furnishing the azamacrocycle in 30 % yield, 34 % ee (scheme 11a).29 In this case however recrystallization of the azamacrocycle could not be achieved to increase enantiopurity.

15

Scheme 11a: Azamacrocycle synthesis via enantioselective Buchwald-Hartwig amination Lastly the authors successfully coupled 1,5-dichloroanthracene with trioxadiamine using palladium/Josiphos SL-J002-1 to produce the corresponding azamacrocycle in 29 % yield, 45 % ee (scheme 11b).29 This azamacrocycle also could not be recrystallized to enantiopurity.

Scheme 11b: Azamacrocycle synthesis via enantioselective Buchwald-Hartwig amination

Another interesting example reported by Ishibashi et al. involves the synthesis of chiral azacalix[4]arene via enantioselective intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig amination.30 When palladium/(R)-SEGPHOS was used as the catalyst system the product was obtained in 78 % yield and 35 % ee (scheme 12). More importantly these enantiomerically enriched compounds were obtained in enantiopure form through multiple recrystallizations due to preferential crystallization of the racemic product.

17

Scheme 12: Synthesis of chiral azacalix[4]arene 1.2.4.3 Chiral Centre Formation In 2009 Porosa and Viirre reported an enantioselective intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig reaction via desymmetrization of di-nitrogen malonamides.31,32 The chiral catalyst employed in these reactions was palladium/(R)-MOP which furnished various six-membered quinolinone heterocycles in excellent yield, 90-99 %, with moderate to high enantiomeric excess, 38-96 % ee (scheme 13). Additionally the six-membered quinolinone heterocycle containing a 4-chloro-2methylbenzyl substituent was obtained in enantiopure form by preferential recrystallization of the racemate, leaving behind the enantiopure mother liquor.32

18

Scheme 13: Desymmetrization of malonamide derivatives via an enantioselective intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig reaction Also in 2009 Sasai et al. reported a similar enantioselective intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig reaction to produce spirobi(3,4-dihydro-2-quinolone) derivatives via double cyclization of various malonamides (scheme 14).33 The catalyst system employed in these reactions was palladium/(S)-BINAP.

Furthermore the dimethyl, diethyl and dibenzyl derivatives were obtained in enantiopure form through a single recrystallization. Interestingly when the authors used palladium/(R)-MOP as the catalyst system, which worked well for Porosa and Viirre, the resulting spirobilactam was isolated as a racemic mixture in 69 % yield.

1.2.4.4 Chiral Axis Formation In 2005 Taguchi et al. demonstrated a very impressive intermolecular enantioselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction by N-arylation of bulky achiral t-butyl anilide derivatives (scheme 15).34 There is free rotation around the C-N bond in the starting material of the reaction shown in scheme 15 however upon arylation at the nitrogen atom the rotation becomes locked in the product thus forming a chiral axis. The authors employed palladium/(R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS as a catalyst system which furnished the coupled products in high yields and enantioselectivity, >80 % yield and >90 % ee (scheme 15).

20

Scheme 15: Enantioselective intermolecular nitrogen arylation of t-butylanilides The authors also successfully applied this chemistry to intramolecular systems resulting in the formation of six-membered ring lactams.34-37 Interestingly the palladium/(R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS catalyst complex was not ideal for the intramolecular N-arylation reaction, resulting in racemic lactam product in low, 12 %, yield. Instead palladium/(S)-BINAP proved to be the optimal catalyst system resulting in the highest enantioselectivity, 70 % ee, and good yield, 95 %, for the formation of lactam product (scheme 16). When 2,5-bis-t-butylanilide was used as the substrate for N-arylation using palladium/(S)-BINAP as the catalyst system the corresponding lactam was obtained in high yield, 95 %, with a remarkable increase in enantioselectivity, 96 % ee (scheme 16).

21

Scheme 16: Enantioselective intramolecular nitrogen arylation of t-butylanilides Additionally the anilide products from the intermolecular N-arylation reactions and lactam products from the intramolecular N-arylation reactions have been applied to asymmetric enolate chemistry.34-37 The chiral axis of these products is what dictates the chirality at the !-carbon because attack of alkyl halides to either the anilide or lactam enolate preferentially occurs from the opposite face of the ortho-t-butyl group. These highly diastereoselective reactions were used in the synthesis of a key intermediate for a norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibitor. The first step in the synthesis of the NET inhibitor involves an intramolecular asymmetric N-arylation reaction using palladium/(R)-SEGPHOS as the catalyst complex. This yields the desired lactam product in excellent yield and enantioselectivity, 95 % yield and 93 % ee (scheme 17). Subsequent !-methylation of the t-butyl lactam product proceeded in high yield, 82 %, with high diastereoselectivity, dr = 31:1. Construction of the quaternary !-carbon atom was achieved by !allylation which again resulted in remarkably high diastereoselectivity, dr = 50:1, and good yield, 86 %. The final steps toward the NET inhibitor was removal of the ortho-t-butyl group of lactam product via a retro-Friedel-Crafts reaction followed by anti-Markovnikov hydration and

22

installation of the amine to furnish the product in moderate yield, 57 %, but more importantly with retention of chirality, 93 % ee, from the original starting lactam.

Scheme 17: Atropisomeric lactam chemistry as a chiral auxiliary in the synthesis of key intermediates for a NET inhibitor 1.3 Synthesis of MOP and MOP Type Ligands In 1993 Hayashi et al. reported the synthesis of enantiopure 2-(Diarylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl ligands for use in asymmetric transition metal catalyzed reactions (scheme 18).38 The first step in the synthesis involved the monophosphinylation of the ditriflate with diphenylphosphine oxide using palladium/dppb as the catalyst system. Next hydrolysis of the monotriflate was accomplished using aqueous NaOH in 1,4-dioxane and methanol. The phenolic hydroxyl moiety was then alkylated by treatment with iodomethane and K2CO3 to produce the corresponding phosphine oxide. Reduction of the phosphine oxide was achieved using trichlorosilane and triethylamine to obtain the free phosphine.

23

Scheme 18: Hayashi's Synthesis of (S)-MOP In 2002 Buchwald et al. reported the synthesis of novel, enantiopure 2-alkoxy-2'dialkylphosphino-1,1'-binaphthyl ligands which are used in palladium-catalyzed asymmetric arylation reactions of enolates.39 The synthetic protocol used to access these ligands was similar to that reported by Hayashi et al. in the preparation of enantiopure 2-(diarylphosphino)-1,1'binaphthyls (scheme 19).38,39

24

Scheme 19: Buchwald's Synthesis of (S)-Cy2MOP About five years later Zhang and his group reported the synthesis of racemic 2-alkoxy-2'dialkylphosphino-1,1'-binaphthyl ligands and demonstrated their utility in intermolecular palladium catalyzed carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions.40 The synthetic route towards the synthesis of these ligands differs from that reported by Hayashi and Buchwald (scheme 20). The first step in the synthesis involved dehydration of 1,1'-bi(2-binaphthol) using an HY zeolite to form a dinaphthofuran ring. Next reductive opening of the dinaphthofuran ring was accomplished with lithium metal to form the dilithium salt which reacted with chlorodicyclohexyl phosphine to produce racemic 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2'-

hydroxybinaphthyl. This compound was oxidized using hydrogen peroxide followed by treatment with sodium hydride to form a soluble sodium salt which was then alkylated using dimethyl sulfate. Lastly the alkylated phosphine oxide was reduced to the free phosphine using trichlorosilane and triethylamine. 25

Scheme 20: Zhang's Synthesis of racemic Cy2MOP In 2004 Buchwald et al. reported the coupling of thiols with aryl halides using palladium/dippf as a catalyst system.41 The substrate scope of the reaction was quite broad making it possible to couple various aryl bromides/chlorides with aliphatic and aromatic thiols. More importantly this catalyst system was also useful for accessing tertiary phosphines via coupling of aryl bromides/chlorides with secondary phosphines (figure 8).

Figure 8: Coupling of aryl halides with secondary phosphines

1.4 Synthesis of Palladium Precatalysts for C-N Cross-coupling Reactions In 2008 Buchwald et al. reported the synthesis of a new class of palladium precatalysts and demonstrated their utility in carbon-nitrogen cross-coupling reactions.42,43 The synthetic outline for the synthesis of these palladium precatalysts is shown in scheme 21. The precatalysts are easily activated by treatment with base to produce indoline and the active Pd(0) catalyst (Figure 9).

Scheme 21: Synthesis of Palladium Precatalysts

Figure 9: Precatalyst Activation Products of cross-coupling reactions were obtained in high yield using low catalyst loadings with short reaction times thus implying that these precatalysts act as highly reactive palladium sources in C-N cross-coupling reactions. Even electron deficient anilines, which are usually difficult coupling partners in C-N cross-couplings due to their low nucleophilicity, were coupled with unactivated aryl chlorides in high yields (scheme 22).

27

Scheme 22: Coupling of electron deficient anilines with unactivated aryl chlorides 1.5 Research Goals and Objectives This thesis paper entails the synthesis of (R)-2(Dicyclohexylphosphino)-2'-methoxy-1,1'binaphthyl), (R)-Cy2MOP, which appears to be a very efficient ligand for the palladium

catalyzed intramolecular desymmetrization of di-nitrogen malonamides. Additionally an enantioand diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction has been developed through the desymmetrization of 2-(2-bromobenzyl)-N1,N 3-bis(2-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-2-methylmalonamide using palladium/Cy2MOP as the catalyst system to produce (3R,Sa)-N,1-bis(2-(tertbutyl)phenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-3-carboxamide in excellent yield, with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity (99 %, 88 % ee). The absolute configuration of the formed diastereomer was determined by x-ray crystallography. The Cy2MOP/Palladium catalyst system has also been effective in the cyclization of six membered ring benzomorpholinone and seven membered ring benzodiazepineone heterocycles. Furthermore various synthetic routes towards the synthesis of five membered ring oxindoles have been explored and each method is thoroughly discussed. Lastly the synthesis of a precatalyst was also attempted using Cy2MOP and Pd(II)Me2TMEDA.

2 Results and Discussion: 2.1 Towards the Synthesis of 5 membered ring Oxindole Heterocycles In order to extend the work carried out by Porosa in 200931,32 to include smaller ring sizes an intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig reaction was envisioned which would furnish five-membered ring oxindole heterocycles (Figure 10).

Figure 10: Desymmetrization of di-nitrogen malonamides to form oxindole heterocycles The initial synthetic protocol towards the synthesis of oxindole heterocycles is shown in scheme 23. The first step entailed a Fischer esterification reaction between compound 1 (2-(2bromophenyl) acetic acid) and ethanol using a Dean-Stark apparatus. The reaction was catalyzed by H2SO4, heated to 85 oC and refluxed for two hours. Under these reaction conditions the desired ethyl ester 2 (ethyl 2-(2-bromophenyl)acetate) was obtained in 50 ­ 70 % yield. Next an ethoxycarbonylation reaction was carried out by deprotonation of 2 in diethyl carbonate using NaH. The reaction was left stirring overnight at room temperature and compound 3 (diethyl 2-(2bromophenyl)malonate) was obtained in 40 ­ 60 % yield. Methylation of 3 at the !-carbon was attempted by deprotonation of 3 in THF using NaH followed by the addition of iodomethane. The reaction was heated to 85 oC and refluxed overnight. The reaction was checked by TLC and showed no disappearance of the starting material, thus another half equivalent of sodium hydride and iodomethane were added to the reaction mixture and the reaction was refluxed overnight. The reaction was checked by TLC and again showed no disappearance of the starting material. 29

This methylation procedure was repeated twice more however the desired compound 4 (diethyl 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-methylmalonate) was not obtained, in each case TLC of the reaction mixture showed unreacted starting material.

Scheme 23: Initial synthetic protocol for the synthesis of oxindole precursors An improved synthetic protocol was established for these three steps and is shown in scheme 24. The first step entailed a Fischer esterification reaction between 1 and methanol. The reaction was catalyzed by H2SO4, heated to 85 oC and refluxed for two hours. The reaction worked exceptionally well and furnished the desired product 5 (methyl 2-(2-bromophenyl)acetate) in 95 % yield. Next a methoxycarbonylation reaction was carried out by deprotonation of 5 in dimethyl carbonate using NaH. The reaction was left stirring overnight at room temperature and compound 6 (dimethyl 2-(2-bromophenyl)malonate) was obtained in 85 % yield. Methylation of 6 at the !-carbon was accomplished by deprotonation of 6 in THF using NaH followed by the

30

addition of either iodomethane or dimethylsulfate. The reaction was heated to 85 oC and refluxed overnight. Compound 7 (dimethyl 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-methylmalonate) was obtained in good yield, 82 and 95 %, when using iodomethane or dimethylsulfate respectively.

Scheme 24: An Improved Synthetic Protocol for the Synthesis of Oxindole Precursors Thus there is a distinct increase in yield for the Fischer esterification reaction when using methanol as opposed to ethanol. This is likely due to the decreased steric bulk of a methyl group compared to an ethyl group thus making it a better nucleophile. Interestingly the methoxycarbonylation reaction shows a similar trend with a dramatic increase in yield when using dimethyl esters as opposed to diethyl esters. The most striking comparison is observed with the methylation reaction whereby alkylation at the !-position was never accomplished using

31

compound 3 as the starting material, however when compound 6 was used as the starting material the desired !-methylated product was obtained in high yield. 2.1.1 Decarboxylation of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-methylmalonic acid Synthesis of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-methylmalonic has proven to be quite tricky due to the propensity of this compound to undergo rapid decarboxylation. Base catalyzed ester hydrolysis of dimethyl 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-methylmalonate followed by subsequent acidification resulted in 65 % yield of racemic 2-(2-bromophenyl)propanoic acid (8) and 0 % of the desired 2-(2bromophenyl)-2-methylmalonic acid (9) (scheme 25). The reaction was repeated twice more using 2.2 equivalents of 2 M NaOH followed by acidification with 2 M HCl resulting in 75 % and 67 % yield of racemic 8 respectively. In each case the desired compound 9 was not obtained.

Scheme 25: Decarboxylation of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-methylmalonic acid 2.1.2 Alternate synthetic route towards N1,N2-dibenzyl-2-methyl-2-phenylmalonamide 2.1.2.1 N1,N2-dibenzyl-2-methyl-2-phenylmalonamide Synthesis using trimethyl aluminum Since the production of 9 was not working via the base catalyzed ester hydrolysis route due to rapid decarboxylation of the desired product, an alternate approach towards the synthesis of 10 (N1,N2-dibenzyl-2-methyl-2-phenylmalonamide) was explored. In 2010 Taguchi et al. reported a reaction between 12 (2-t-butyl-4-methoxyaniline) and 13 (3-(2-iodophenyl)propanoate) to 32

produce

using

Me3Al

(scheme 26).37

Scheme 26: Amide bond formation using Me3Al The reaction required an atmosphere of argon and entailed dissolving 13 in toluene followed by the addition of Me3Al on ice. After stirring for 20 minutes at 0 oC 12 was added and the reaction was stirred at 80 oC for 18 h. After an aqueous work-up followed by purification via column chromatography the desired compound was obtained in 61 % yield. Application of this method towards the synthesis of 10 seemed very appealing since compound 9 was not required as the starting material. Thus under an atmosphere of argon, benzylamine was dissolved in toluene followed by the addition of Me3Al on ice (scheme 27). After stirring for 20 minutes at 0 oC compound 7 was added and the reaction was stirred at 80 oC for 18 h. The reaction was then checked by TLC and showed no disappearance of the starting material, therefore another half equivalent of Me3Al was added to the reaction and the mixture was stirred overnight at 80 oC. Once again the reaction was checked by TLC and still there appeared to be no disappearance of starting material. After a quick mini work-up 1H-NMR confirmed that there was only starting material in the reaction mixture.

33

Scheme 27: Me3Al approach to diamide bond formation 2.1.2.2 Decarbonylation of Barbituric acids In 2000 Jursic reported a versatile and convenient procedure for the preparation of N,N'-2,2tetrasubstituted malonamides by decarbonylation of tetrasubstituted barbituric acids (scheme 28).44

Scheme 28: decarbonylation of tetrasubstituted barbituric acids Since the synthesis of 10 proved to be problematic, decarbonylation of tetrasubstituted barbituric acids appeared to be a reasonable method for obtaining this compound. The first step towards the synthesis of tetrasubstituted barbituric acids was to synthesize 15 (dibenzylurea) which was accomplished by reacting benzylamine with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole in DCM at room temperature for 12 hours. The reaction worked extremely well and compound 15 was obtained in 86 % yield (scheme 29).

34

Scheme 29: Synthesis of dibenzylurea The next step was to synthesize the corresponding barbituric acids. The first attempt towards the synthesis of these compounds was based on a literature procedure reported by Bose et al. in which the authors reacted various carbodiimides with substituted malonic acids to obtain the desired barbiturates.45 Thus compounds 7 and 15 were dissolved in a solution of NaOEt/ethanol and the reaction mixture was heated to 70 oC (scheme 30). After refluxing overnight the reaction was checked by TLC and showed complete disappearance of the starting material. Furthermore the appearance of a broad streak on the TLC plate became evident. After an acidic work-up, 1HNMR of the crude product looked encouraging however it was clear that the compound needed to be purified in order to determine if it was indeed the desired barbituric acid. The sample would always appear as a broad streak on the TLC plate regardless of the various different solvents and solvent conditions used in attempt to see distinct spots on the TLC plate. Thus column chromatography was carried out using 60 % EtOAc: 40 % Hexanes, and the broad streak was isolated in 76 % yield, however 1H-NMR of this sample still showed that the compound was not pure.

35

Scheme 30: Synthesis of a tetrasubstituted barbituric acid Nevertheless a reaction was set up to decarbonylate the putative barbituric acid based on the procedure reported by Jursic et al.44 in which the crude compound 16 was dissolved in MeOH followed by the addition of 0.2 M NaOH, the reaction was heated to 70 oC and left refluxing overnight (scheme 31). The reaction was checked by TLC and showed that the broad streak was still present along with another spot that had an Rf corresponding to that of dibenzyl urea. An aqueous work-up followed by recrystallization of the organic phase resulted in 40 % recovery of dibenzylurea. Decarbonylation of the putative barbituric acid was repeated twice more resulting in 50 % and 40 % recovery of dibenzylurea respectively (scheme 31).

Scheme 31: Decarbonylation of the putative Barbituric acid Barbituric acid synthesis was also attempted using t-BuOK as a base instead of NaOEt, thus to a solution of t-BuOK in DMSO was added a solution of dibenzyl urea in DMSO at 0 oC. After 10

36

minutes of stirring, a solution of compound 7 in DMSO was added and the reaction was left stirring at room temperature overnight (scheme 32). The reaction was checked by TLC and again the appearance of a broad streak was evident. Once again the crude product was subjected to column chromatography however in this case the crude compound either decomposed or was strongly retained on the column because only 16 % of the crude product was recovered.

Scheme 32: Barbituric acid synthesis using t-BuOK and DMSO Another attempt towards the synthesis of barbituric acids was explored using TMSCl (scheme 33). In this procedure dibenzylurea, TMSCl and Hunig's base were stirred in a concentrated solution of THF for thirty minutes. Compound 7 was then added to the reaction mixture and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for two hours. After seeing no disappearance of starting material by TLC the reaction was heated to 70 oC and left refluxing overnight. The reaction was checked by TLC and again showed no disappearance of starting material.

Scheme 33: Barbituric acid synthesis using TMSCl and Hunig's base

37

A similar reaction was set up using [(CH3)3Si]2NK (potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide) in which dibenzylurea and [(CH3)3Si]2NK were stirred in a concentrated solution of THF for thirty minutes. Compound 7 was then added to the reaction mixture and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for two hours (scheme 34). The reaction was monitored by TLC and showed no disappearance of starting material after two hours, therefore the reaction was heated to 70 oC and left refluxing overnight. Once again only starting material was visible after the reaction was checked by TLC.

Scheme 34: Barbituric acid synthesis using potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide 2.1.2.3 Base catalyzed ester hydrolysis followed by immediate activation with SOCl2 Having had no success in synthesizing compound 10 using the Me3Al protocol or through decarbonylation of barbituric acids, base catalyzed ester hydrolysis was reinvestigated. This time compound 7 was dissolved in THF upon addition of three equivalents of NaOH. The reaction was heated to 70 oC and left refluxing overnight in THF. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness (without acidification) cooled to 0 oC and transferred to ice cold SOCl2 in THF. The reaction was stirred for four hours at 60 oC, evaporated to dryness, redissolved in THF and evaporated to dryness once again. This process of redissolving the crude product in THF and evaporating to dryness was repeated four more times to get rid of any excess SOCl2. The crude product was redissolved in THF and treated with benzylamine and Et3N. The reaction mixture was heated to 70 oC and left refluxing overnight (scheme 35). TLC of the crude reaction mixture 38

showed the appearance of a new spot which was isolated in 21 % yield and found to be the mono-substituted benzylamide. This reaction was repeated once more with freshly distilled SOCl2 and once again the mono-substitued product was obtained in low 25 % yield. So even under these reaction conditions decarboxylation of compound 9 was still occurring.

Scheme 35: Base catalyzed ester hydrolysis followed by immediate activation with SOCl2 2.1.2.3.1 N1,N2-dibenzyl-2-methyl-2-phenylmalonamide synthesis using benzyl isocyanate With compound 17 (N-benzyl-2-(2-bromophenyl)propanamide) in hand, a reaction using benzyl isocyanate was envisioned which would afford 10. Thus a solution of 17 in THF was added to a suspension of NaH in THF and the reaction was heated to 70 oC (scheme 36). The reaction was refluxed for one hour and cooled to room temperature, followed by the addition of benzyl isocyanate on ice. The reaction was stirred at room temperature and monitored by TLC. After two hours of stirring at room temperature, TLC of the reaction mixture showed no disappearance of starting material and no appearance of a new spot. Therefore the reaction was heated to 70 oC and left refluxing overnight. Once again TLC of the reaction mixture showed that no reaction had occurred.

39

Scheme 36: Attempted synthesis of compound 10 using benzyl isocyanate 2.1.2.3.2 Temperature experiments on base catalyzed ester hydrolysis A small scale heating experiment was performed on compound 7. In this experiment compound 7 was dissolved in MeOH and treated with 3 eq of 4 M NaOH. The reaction was left stirring overnight at room temperature. After the reaction was evaporated to dryness 1H-NMR showed complete disappearance of the ester signals of the starting material and peaks corresponding to a 3:1 ratio of the disodium salt to the decarboxylated compound. This experiment was taken one step further whereby this sample was redissolved in methanol, heated to 70 oC and left stirring overnight at this temperature. Interestingly 1H-NMR of this sample revealed that the only product in the reaction after heating overnight at 70 oC was in fact the decarboxylated compound. Therefore heat was found to be the culprit for decarboxylation. 2.1.2.4 Base catalyzed ester hydrolysis re-revisited Since the disodium salt of compound 7 could be obtained by treatment with NaOH/MeOH (1:3) and stirring overnight at room temperature, synthesis of compound 10 could potentially be achieved by treatment of the disodium salt with SOCl2 followed by subsequent addition of benzylamine and Hunig's base. Thus compound 7 was dissolved in MeOH and treated with NaOH and the reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature (Scheme 37). The reaction mixture was checked by TLC and showed complete disappearance of the starting material. At this point the reaction was evaporated to dryness then re-dissolved in toluene and evaporated to 40

dryness once again. This process of re-dissolving in toluene and evaporating to dryness was repeated four more times to get rid of any remaining water. After keeping the product overnight under vacuum the disodium salt was dissolved in cold THF and transferred to ice cold SOCl2. The reaction was stirred for four hours at room temperature then evaporated to dryness, redissolved in THF and evaporated to dryness once again. This process of re-dissolving in THF and evaporating to dryness was repeated four more times to get rid of any remaining SOCl2. Next the crude product was dissolved in THF and treated with benzylamine and Hunig's base. The reaction was left stirring overnight at room temperature. TLC of the reaction mixture did not show the appearance of a new spot but rather unreacted benzylamine indicating that the amide bond forming reaction needs heat.

Scheme 37: Amide bond formation in the absence of heat 2.1.2.5 N1,N2-dibenzyl-2-methyl-2-phenylmalonamide synthesis using HBTU It became evident that mild conditions were necessary for the synthesis of compound 10 and HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate) appeared to be a good candidate for promoting mild amide couplings. Having the disodium salt in hand a coupling reaction with benzylamine using HBTU was envisioned however even at low reaction concentrations, < 0.001 M, the disodium salt would not dissolve in DMF.

41

In order to increase the solubility of the starting material in DMF, a base catalyzed ester hydrolysis was set up using KOH instead of NaOH. Interestingly only one side of the molecule reacted resulting in a mono-potassium salt mono-ester compound (scheme 38).

Scheme 38: Base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis using KOH Nevertheless this compound was subjected to a coupling reaction using HBTU as the coupling agent (scheme 39). Thus the starting material was dissolved in DMF followed by the addition of HBTU and benzylamine. The reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight. TLC of the crude reaction mixture showed the appearance of several new spots however any attempt at purifying this compound via column chromatography was unsuccessful.

Scheme 39: HBTU coupling of mono-acid mono-ester with benzylamine 2.1.2.6 N1,N2-dibenzyl-2-methyl-2-phenylmalonamide synthesis using BuLi The last procedure attempted for the synthesis of 10 entailed using BuLi to deprotonate benzylamine, thus creating an extremely strong nucleophile which should theoretically undergo di-substitution with compound 7. In this method benzylamine was dissolved in dry THF and 42

cooled to 0 oC followed by the slow dropwise addition of BuLi under a stream of argon. The reaction was stirred for fifteen minutes at 0 oC before the addition of a solution of compound 7 in THF at 0 oC. The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature. TLC of the crude reaction mixture at 40 % EtOAc:Hexanes showed many spots however it looked encouraging due to the appearance of a spot with a strikingly similar Rf to the six and seven membered ring precursor di-substituted benzylmalonamides. This spot was easily isolated by column chromatography eluting at 40 % EtOAc:Hexanes, however 1H-NMR of this compound showed too much signal in the methylene region of the spectrum. Perhaps what happened was lithium exchange with bromide resulting in the compound shown in scheme 40. The reaction was repeated with the addition of BuLi at -78 oC instead of 0 oC and this also resulted in the isolation of a compound with peaks corresponding to 19 by 1H-NMR.

Scheme 40: Amide bond formation using Butyl-Lithium 2.2 Synthesis of six membered ring Benzomorpholinone Heterocycles In order to further investigate the work carried out by Porosa in 200931,32 to include six membered rings with more than one heteroatom in the ring an intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig reaction was envisioned which would furnish six-membered ring benzomorpholinone heterocycles (Figure 11).

43

Figure 11: Desymmetrization of malonamides to form benzomorpholinone heterocycles

The synthesis of six membered ring benzomorpholinone heterocycles began with a substitution reaction between 2-bromophenol and diethyl 2-bromo-2-methylmalonate (scheme 41). The reaction worked reasonably well and the desired product 22 (diethyl 2-(2-bromophenoxy)-2methylmalonate) was obtained in 66 % yield. The next step entailed base catalyzed ester hydrolysis of 22 followed by subsequent acidification with a pH 3 phosphate buffer which furnished compound 23 (2-(2-bromophenoxy)-2-methylmalonic acid) in 80 % yield (scheme 41).

44

Scheme 41: Towards the Synthesis of Benzomorpholinone Heterocycles Initially the base catalyzed ester hydrolysis of 22 was followed by acidification with 6 M HCl which produced the corresponding di-acid 23 in 50 % yield. Thus the rationale for switching from 6 M HCl to a pH 3 phosphate buffer was that the buffer would be a less harsh way to protonate the di-sodium salt and ultimately lead to a decrease in decarboxylation. Coupling of 23 with benzylamine to form 20 (N1,N
3

-dibenzyl-2-(2-bromophenoxy)-2-

methylmalonamide) was originally attempted by activation of the di-carboxcylic acid with SOCl2 followed by the addition of benzylamine but this route yielded only 16 % of compound 24 (Nbenzyl-2-(2-bromophenoxy)propanamide) the undesired decarboxylated compound (scheme 42).

45

Scheme 42: Activation of di-acid using SOCl2 Activation of 23 with HBTU proved superior to SOCl2 and the desired diamide compound 20 was obtained in 38 % yield (scheme 43). One of the benefits of using HBTU over SOCl2 is the ability to run reactions at room temperature, this is important because heat is a factor that increases the rate of decarboxylation.

Scheme 43: Activation of di-acid using HBTU With the desired dibenzylamide in hand a series of cross coupling reactions were carried out to find optimal cyclization conditions (Table 1).

Table 1: Desymmetrization of di-nitrogen malonamides via an intramolecular BuchwaldHartwig reaction to produce benzomorpholinone heterocycles (* 1H-NMR Conversion determined from the disappearance of CH2 signals in compound 20) Initially compound 20 was cyclized using racemic BINAP as the ligand (Table 1, Trial 1). The reaction worked well showing 95 % conversion by 1H-NMR however the cyclized product was only isolated in 50 % yield. The reason for the low isolated yield of the cyclized product is because the crude product was purified by preparative plate TLC. Although this seemed to be an appropriate method for purification, since this reaction was done on a small scale (0.05mmol, 25 47

mg), it proved to be inferior to purification via column chromatography. Next a series of reactions were set up in order to investigate the enantioselectivity of the desymmetrization reaction using chiral, enantiopure phosphine ligands. Application of (R)-Cy2MOP.BH3, (R)Cy2MOP and (R)-MOP using K2CO3 as a base all demonstrated low conversion , < 10 ­ 35 %, to the desired cyclized product by 1H-NMR (Table 1, Trials 2,3,4). Cyclization of compound 20 using (R)-BINAP and K2CO3 resulted in 100 % conversion to cyclized product 21. This compound was isolated in good yield, 88 %, however the enantioselectivity was low, 20 % ee, (Table 1, Trial 5). Interestingly application of (R)-Cy2MOP, (R)-BINAP and (R)-MOP using Cs2CO3 as a base instead of K2CO3 resulted in 100 % conversion of compound 20 to compound 21 (Table 1, Trials 6,7,8). The crude product of these reactions was isolated in excellent yield, 90 ­ 99 %, however once again the enantioselectivity of the product was quite low, 3 ­ 12 % ee. It was thought that perhaps the high temperature of the cyclization reaction could be detrimental to the enantioselevtivity of the product thus a cross-coupling reaction was set-up using (R)-BINAP and K2CO3 at 60 oC instead of 100 oC (Table 1, Trial 9). After two days the reaction was monitored by 1H-NMR and showed no conversion of 20 to compound 21. Another catalyst loading of palladium and (R)-BINAP was added to the reaction mixture, since the catalyst tends to decompose after 2 days, and the reaction was left stirring for two more days. Even after four days however this reaction showed no conversion to compound 21 by 1H-NMR indicating that the high temperature is key for this cyclization to occur.

2.3 Synthesis of Seven Membered Ring Benzodiazepinone Heterocycles In order to extend the work carried out by Porosa in 200931,32 to include larger ring sizes an intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig reaction was envisioned which would furnish sevenmembered ring benzodiazepinone heterocycles (Figure 12).

Figure 12: Desymmetrization of malonamides to form benzodiazepinone heterocycles The first step towards the synthesis of benzodiazepinone heterocycles was a substitution reaction between 25 (2-bromophenethyl alcohol) and 26 (tosyl chloride) using triethylamine and DMAP which furnished the desired tosylate ester in 88 % yield (scheme 44). Next the tosylate ester was reacted with 28 to produce compound 29 (diethyl-2-(2-bromophenethyl)-2-methylmalonate) in 50 % yield (scheme 44).

49

Scheme 44: Synthesis of benzodiazapineone precursors The diethyl ester was then hydrolyzed using NaOH and acidified with HCl to produce 30 (2-(2bromophenethyl)-2-methylmalonic acid) in 55 % yield (scheme 45). Activation of the dicarboxcylic acid with SOCl2 and subsequent treatment with benzylamine provided the desired dibenzylmalonamide 31 in 40 % yield (scheme 45).

50

Scheme 45: Towards the Synthesis of benzodiazepinone heterocycles With the desired dibenzylmalonamide in hand a series of cross coupling reactions were carried out to find optimal cyclization conditions (Table 2). Initially the cyclization of 31 was attempted with racemic BINAP and (R)-MOP using K3PO4 as a base, in THF at 65 oC for twenty-four hours, however neither of these reactions showed any conversion to compound 31 by 1H-NMR (Table 2, Trials 1,2). Cyclization of 31 was also attempted with (R)-MOP.BH3 and K3PO4 in tBuOH at 65 oC, nonetheless this reaction still showed no conversion to compound 32 by 1HNMR (Table 2, Trial 3). Interestingly when the cyclization of compound 31 was attempted with (R)-MOP.BH3 using Cs2CO3, in THF at 65 oC for forty-eight hours, 1H-NMR of the crude reaction showed a 50:50 mixture of the starting material and compound 33, the debrominated compound (Table 2, Trial 4, scheme 46).

52

Having had no success in the synthesis of benzodiazepinone heterocycles thus far, it was believed that perhaps higher temperatures were required for this cyclization to happen. Indeed when compound 31 was cyclized using (R)-MOP.BH3 and Cs2CO3 in Toluene at 100 oC for forty-eight hours, 1H-NMR showed a 75 % conversion of compound 31 to 32 (Table 2, Trial 5). Unfortunately the cyclized product could not be separated from the starting material because they appear to have a very similar Rf by TLC. Application of Cy2MOP for the cyclization of compound 31 resulted in 100 % conversion to the desired benzodiazapineone heterocycle (Table 2, Trial 6). The crude product was isolated in 50 % yield because it was purified by preparative plate TLC which has proven not to be the optimal method of purification for these compounds. Nevertheless the seven-membered ring heterocycle has been synthesized and the isolated compound is being analyzed by chiral column HPLC to determine the enantiomeric excess.

2.4 Development of an enantio- and diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction To further expand the work carried out by Porosa in 200931,32 and develop an enantio- and diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction a desymmetrization reaction was envisioned which would generate a chiral centre as well as a chiral axis due to locked rotation around the Naryl bond (Figure 13).

Figure 13: Development of an enantio- and diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction 53

The synthesis of t-butyl substituted quinolinone began with a substitution reaction between compound 28 and 2-bromobenzylbromide followed by base catalyzed ester hydrolysis using NaOH and subsequent acidification with concentrated HCl. Activation of the dicarboxcylic acid was accomplished with SOCl2 followed by the addition of t-butyl aniline to obtain the desired diamide compound (scheme 47).

Scheme 47: Towards the synthesis of t-butyl quinolinone The steric bulk created by the ortho t-butyl group made the substitution reaction between the acyl chloride and t-butylaniline difficult resulting in unreacted starting material as well as the mono-substituted decarboxylated compound. Nevertheless with the di-t-butylphenyl amide in hand a series of cross coupling reactions were carried out to find optimal cyclization conditions (Table 3).

Interestingly 1H-NMR of the crude reaction mixture showed unreacted 35, the debrominated compound 37, but more importantly only one diastereomer of t-butyl substituted quinolinone 36 (Table 3, Trial 1, scheme 48). When the cyclization of 35 was done using (R)-MOP.BH3 and K2CO3, with all other reaction parameters kept constant, the same three compounds 35, 36 and 37, were obtained (Table 3, Trial 2, scheme 48). 55

Scheme 48: Initial cross-coupling experiments using (R)-MOP and (R)-MOP.BH3 Cyclization of 35 using (R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS and K2CO3 in Toluene at 100 oC resulted in 100 % unreacted 35 (Table 3, Trial 3), this was an interesting result because even though the desired compound 36 was not produced neither was the undesired debrominated compound 37, indicating that THF may have been the culprit for debromination of the starting material. Amazingly when the cyclization of 35 was carried out using (R)-Cy2MOP and K2CO3 in Toluene at 100 oC, 1H-NMR of the crude reaction showed 50 % conversion of 35 to 36 (Table 3, Trial 4). Furthermore when this same reaction was done using Cs2CO3 as a base instead of K2CO3, the reaction proceeded with 100 % conversion of 35 to 36 and the crude product was isolated in excellent, 99 %, yield (Table 3, Trial 5). The purified compound was recrystallized once from chloroform:cyclohexane (1:1) and analyzed by x-ray crystallography. The absolute configuration of compound 36 determined by x-ray crystallography is (R) at the chiral centre and (S) at the chiral axis (figure 14). 56

Figure 14: X-ray crystal structure of t-butylphenyl substituted quinolinone

In order to obtain racemic 36 a cross-coupling reaction was set up using racemic BINAP and Cs2CO3 in Toluene at 100 oC, however this reaction resulted in poor, < 10 % conversion, of compound 35 to 36 (Table 3, Trial 6). Nevertheless racemic 36 was obtained in 99 % yield using the achiral S-Phos precatalyst complex (Table 3, Trial 7, scheme 49).

57

Scheme 49: Synthesis of racemic t-butyl quinolinone using an S-PHOS precatalyst Interestingly TLC of the crude reaction showed a single spot and 1H-NMR analysis revealed only a single diastereomer was formed in this reaction. Furthermore it was proved by 1H-NMR that the diastereomer formed in this reaction is the same diastereomer that is formed when the cyclization of 35 was carried out using (R)-Cy2MOP. Thus the reaction appears to be diastereoselective even when using an achiral catalyst. Additionally chiral column HPLC analysis of the racemic compound illustrated two peaks in an equal ratio to one another, signifying that the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts in the absence of a chiral catalyst (figure 15a). Amazingly, chiral column HPLC analysis of compound 36 cyclized with Cy2MOP using Cs2CO3 or K2CO3 revealed a significant decrease in the peak with a retention time around 10.74 min (Figure 15b and c). The ee of compound 36 cyclized with Cy2MOP using Cs2CO3 or K2CO3 was calculated to be 88 %. Although it is not certain that the crystal structure shown in figure 14 represents the major enantiomer formed in this reaction, there is a 94 % probability that it does since the er (enantiomeric ratio) of compound 36 cyclized with Cy2MOP using Cs2CO3 or K2CO3 is 94:6. Nevertheless this serves as the first example of its kind whereby 58

an enantio- and diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction occurs in a single step through preferential N-arylation of prochiral di-nitrogen malonamides.

2.5 Synthesis of Cy2MOP In order to demonstrate the utility of chiral dialkylbiarylphosphines in the intramolecular desymmetrization of malonamides, a synthetic protocol was carried out to obtain the enantiopure, non-commercially available, ligand 41 ((R)-2(Dicyclohexylphosphino)-2'-methoxy1,1'-binaphthyl) (Scheme 50).

Scheme 50: Synthesis of (R)-2(Dicyclohexylphosphino)-2'-methoxy-1,1'-binaphthyl) The first two steps towards the synthesis of 41 were performed by Bashar Alkhouri and entailed treating compound 38 (BINOL, commercially available in the enantiopure (R) form) with potassium carbonate in acetone followed by methylation, using iodomethane, which furnished 39 (Me-BINOL) in high yield (scheme 50).46 Next compound 39 was deprotonated using pyridine and reacted with triflic anhydride to produce 40 (Me-BINOL-OTf) in good yield (scheme 50).46 The final step was accomplished via a palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between 40 61

and dicyclohexylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate using palladium/dippf as the catalyst system (scheme 50). This catalyst system was employed due to the successful coupling of aryl bromides/chlorides with secondary phosphines reported by Buchwald and co-workers in 2004.41 The reaction worked fairly well and the desired tertiary phosphine was obtained in moderate to high yield. Two factors which increased the yield of 41 were the use of ten equivalents of Hunig's base as opposed to six equivalents, in order to ensure complete deprotonation of dicyclohexylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate and keeping the reaction solvent, DMSO, under vacuum for one hour followed by purging with argon for another half hour before use. Initially compound 41 was utilized in the desymmetrization of 45 in order to compare the yield and selectivity of this reaction with (R)-MOP (Scheme 51). Interestingly the ee of the desired product 46 was identical, 56 % ee when cyclized with Cy2MOP or (R)-MOP47, however the yield of compound 46 was somewhat lower, 80 % when cyclized with Cy2MOP compared to quantitative when cyclized with (R)-MOP.47

Scheme 51: Intramolecular desymmetrization using Cy2MOP Nevertheless compound 41 was remarkably more air-stable than MOP and showed a substantial increase in activity for the intramolecular palladium catalyzed amidation reaction with other substrates i.e. compounds 20, 31 and 35. Both MOP and Cy2MOP have an ortho-methoxy group that can act as a hemilabile coordination site with palladium, thus increasing electron density and stability of the palladium center. Replacement of the diphenylphosphino group of MOP with the 62

bulkier and more basic dicyclohexylphosphino group probably slows down the rate of oxidative addition and ligand exchange but at the same time speeds up the rate of reductive elimination and thus regeneration of the active catalyst due to the massive steric bulk surrounding palladium. Therefore the acceleration in rate of cross coupling can be attributed to the fact that regeneration of the active catalyst is in fact the rate determining step in this catalytic cycle.19 Furthermore complexation of Cy2MOP with borane-THF resulted in the desired phosphineborane complex which was easily purified by column chromatography is air-stable and crystalline (scheme 52, Figure 16).

2.6 Palladium Precatalyst Synthesis With compound 41 in hand a palladium precatalyst complex was envisioned which would incorporate an element of chirality into the precatalyst complexes synthesiszed by Buchwald et al. in 200842-43 (Figure 17).

64

Figure 17: An axially chiral, enantiopure palladium precatalyst 2.6.1 Palladium Precatalyst Synthesis via orthopalladated complexes Initially the synthetic protocol towards these precatalysts was based on a report by Vicente et al in 1997, whereby the authors treated orthopalladated complexes with tertiary phosphines to obtain the desired compound 44 (Figure 18).48

Figure 18: Reaction of tertiary phosphines with orthopalladated complexes Synthesis of compound 43 was attempted by dissolving Pd(OAc)2 in acetonitrile followed by the addition of phenethylamine. The reaction was heated to 85 oC and left refluxing for four hours. Next the reaction mixture was filtered through a plug of MgSO4, the solvent was removed and acetone was added followed by the addition of NaBr. The resulting suspension was heated to 85
o

C and left stirring overnight at this temperature. After an aqueous work-up, 1H-NMR analysis of

the crude reaction showed a complex mixture of products. Furthermore TLC of the crude material at various different solvent conditions failed to show distinct spots, but rather a large

65

smear on the TLC plate (scheme 53). This reaction was repeated twice more however the result was the same.

Scheme 53: Attempted orthopalladation of (2-Phenylethyl)amine 2.6.2 Palladium Precatalyst Synthesis using Pd(II)Me2TMEDA Palladium precatalyst synthesis was also attempted following Buchwald's procedure which entailed reacting the desired phosphine ligand with Pd(II)Me2TMEDA (figure 16).42-43

Figure 19: Buchwald's Palladium precatalyst synthesis using Pd(II)Me2TMEDA Thus in a nitrogen glove box, Pd(II)Me2TMEDA was dissolved in MTBE followed by the addition of 2-chloro(phenylethyl)amine. Cy2MOP was then added to the reaction and the mixture was heated to 55 oC outside the glove box. The reaction was left stirring at this temperature for two hours. Next the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude solid was redissolved in MTBE and precipitated out with hexanes. An off-white powder was obtained in 50 % yield however this compound did not appear to be the desired precatalyst by 1H-NMR or 31P-NMR. In fact there was no methyl peak corresponding to the methoxy group of Cy2MOP in the proton spectrum. Furthermore there was 66

not enough signal in the alkyl region of the proton spectrum with respect to cyclohexyl groups of Cy2MOP. Lastly the phosphorus signal for these precatalysts usually show up around ! 55 ­ 65, however in this case the phosphorus signal was visible at ! 36.0. Nevertheless a cross coupling reaction was set up to determine if this compound was able to catalyze the intramolecular cyclization reaction (scheme 54).

Scheme 54: Cross coupling reaction using putative Cy2MOP precatalyst Therefore compound 45, the putative precatalyst and K2CO3 were added to a Schlenk flask and the flask was evacuated and backfilled with argon. Toluene was added under a stream of argon, the reaction was sealed and heated to 100 oC. The reaction mixture was left stirring at 100 oC for two days. Analysis of the crude reaction by 1H-NMR showed a 40 % conversion of compound 45 to 46. Thus under these reaction conditions the assumed precatalyst was able to cyclize compound 45. Efforts are underway to recrystallize the presumed precatalyst in order to determine its structure. Precatalyst synthesis was also attempted with (R)-MOP instead of Cy2MOP following Buchwald's procedure,42-43 i.e. in a nitrogen glove box, Pd(II)Me2TMEDA was dissolved in MTBE followed by the addition of 2-chloro(phenylethyl)amine. (R)-MOP was then added to the reaction and the mixture was heated to 55 oC outside the glove box. The reaction was left stirring at this temperature for two hours. Next the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude solid was redissolved in MTBE and 67

precipitated out with hexanes. An orange powder was obtained this time and analysis of this compound by 1H-NMR and
31

P-NMR revealed the formation of at least three different MOP

complexes. In the proton spectrum there were three separate methyl signals corresponding to the methoxy group of (R)-MOP in a 1:1:0.5 ratio. Furthermore
31

P-NMR showed two distinct

phosphorus signals at ! 28.6 and -13.8 respectively, neither of which correspond to the precatalyst or the free phosphine. Since this reaction was done on a small scale (50 mg w.r.t. (R)MOP) no attempt was made to purify the crude product. Nonetheless a cross coupling reaction was set up to determine if this crude material would be able to catalyze the cyclization of compound 45 to 46 (scheme 55).

Scheme 55: Cross coupling reaction using putative (R)-MOP precatalyst Thus compound 45, the putative (R)-MOP precatalyst and K2CO3 were added to a Schlenk flask and the flask was evacuated and backfilled with argon. Toluene was added under a stream of argon, the reaction was sealed and heated to 100 oC. The reaction mixture was left stirring at 100
o

C for two days. However analysis of the crude reaction by 1H-NMR showed < 10 % conversion

of compound 45 to 46. Thus under these reaction conditions the assumed precatalyst was not effective in the cyclization of compound 45. Palladium precatalyst synthesis was attempted one last time with Cy2MOP following Buchwald's procedure.42-43 All the reaction parameters were kept constant and interestingly a 68

different result was obtained. Again an off-white powder was obtained in 50 % yield however
1

H-NMR of this compound looked more encouraging than the first time this reaction was

attempted. There was indeed enough signal in the aliphatic region of the proton spectrum, corresponding to the cyclohexyl groups of Cy2MOP, and these signals were in the appropriate region i.e. between ! 1-2, for the precatalyst complex. Oddly though there was no methyl signal for the methoxy group of Cy2MOP. Also there was no phosphorus signal in the
31

P-NMR

spectrum. Nevertheless a cross coupling reaction was carried out with this compound but unlike in the first case there was no conversion of compound 45 to 46 (scheme 56).

Scheme 56: Cross coupling reaction using another putative precatalyst This suggests that there may not be a palladium atom present which consequently does not allow the reaction to occur. Efforts are also underway to recrystallize this compound in order to determine its structure.

4 Conclusion A non commercially available ligand, (R)-2(Dicyclohexylphosphino)-2'-methoxy-1,1'-

binaphthyl), (R)-Cy2MOP, has been synthesized in good yield, 80 %, and proved to be very effective in the palladium catalyzed intramolecular desymmetrization of di-nitrogen malonamides. The efficiency of this ligand can be attributed to the increased steric bulk provided by the dicyclohexylphosphino group, which speeds up the rate of reductive elimination thus increasing the rate at which the active catalyst is regenerated. Additionally an enantio- and diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction has been developed through the desymmetrization of 2-(2-bromobenzyl)-N1,N
3

-bis(2-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-2-methylmalonamide

using

palladium/Cy2MOP as the catalyst system to produce (3R,Sa)-N,1-bis(2-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-3methyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-3-carboxamide in excellent yield, with high enantioand diastereoselectivity (99 %, 88 % ee). The absolute configuration of the formed diastereomer was determined by x-ray crystallography. This is the first example in which an enantio- and diastereoselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction takes place in a single step from the preferential N-arylation of prochiral di-nitrogen malonamides. Application of the palladium/Cy2MOP catalyst system in the intramolecular desymmetrization reaction also resulted in the formation of six membered ring benzomorpholinone heterocycles in excellent yield (88-99 %) however the ee`s of the products were quite low (3-20 % ee). A seven membered ring benzodiazepineone heterocycle was also synthesized using palladium/Cy2MOP and the product was isolated in 50 % yield. Furthermore several synthetic routes towards the synthesis of five membered ring oxindoles were explored but none of them were successful. Lastly the synthesis of a precatalyst was attempted using Cy2MOP and Pd(II)Me2TMEDA however the isolated product does not appear to be the desired precatalyst.
