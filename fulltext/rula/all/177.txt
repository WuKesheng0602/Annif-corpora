Action Research in OHS ­ Shifting from Hypothesis Testing to Experiential Learning? W.P. Neumann1 (pneumann@ryerson.ca) and M. Ekman2 1- Mech. & Industrial Engineering, Ryerson University, 2- The Swedish Royal Institute of Technology This paper introduces and discusses the use of `Action Research' (AR) modalities in ergonomics intervention research as a means to improve intervention quality and study the process of organisational change. WHAT is AR? AR is a non-experimental approach similar to participant-observer techniques that would aim at engaging organisations and individuals in a mutual exploration of a practical problem faced by the participants ­ in this case occupational health and safety (OHS). Action Researchers work with organisational stakeholders in a collaborative fashion; using workshops, dialogue conferences, and individual discussions to support, advise and observe organisational change from an embedded position. Based on early work of Lewin (1951) AR emerged from the sociological research background but has been applied in a wide range of organisational settings. The aim is to support the impulse for improvement while observing how the efforts proceed to find new ways of working that are acceptable to the parties involved. It focuses on the process of learning rather than quantified out-comes. It emphasises broad engagement of stakeholders who in developing multi-factor interventions. Learning on OHS practice occurs for both participants and researchers. AR surrenders positivisms fertile certainty of a single absolute world, best suited for the study of inanimate objects or isolatable phenomena. Instead, AR is post-modern in that it accepts the multiple perspectives of different stakeholders as all being valid ­ reflecting the complexity of organisational systems. Although postpositivistic, AR does not abandon empiricism. Nor does it abandon theory. AR applies an ongoing exchange between theory and observation. Neither is super-ordinate. It is this reflection between the observed change efforts by company stakeholders, and the supporting activities of the researcher, that can both challenge and develop theory while also helping stakeholders formulate new means of acting that suit the particular circumstances of the individuals and organisation involved. WHY AR? OHS intervention research has begun to recognise reaching the limits of the Newtonian positivistic perspective (Griffiths, 1999). The problem of OHS belongs to what systems theorists call a `wicked problem' which are characterised by the impossibility of decomposing the problem and the complexity of the system involved. System complexity implies unstable relations between system elements, emergence of behaviours from the interaction of system elements, and susceptibility to preconditions (the butterfly effect). System elements cannot be understood singly and then combined linearly ­ there is a need to study entire systems since the emergence and instability of relations can lead to non-linear and `irrational' system behaviours. Organisations, we argue, are complex systems. What works in one organisation won't necessarily work in another and might not work at some other time-point for even that same organisation. This, in part, explains the difficulty experimental research has in demonstrating consistent effects in their intervention efforts (e.g. Karsh et al., 2001). AR, alternatively, favours working closely in the particular context to study how stakeholders can build on their contextual knowledge to solve their problems in new ways ­ it is research on practice. CHALLENGES of AR - One of the biggest weaknesses of AR is said to be its lack of acceptance by those operating within the dominant experimental paradigm- sceptics may say: `That's not science!'. This is effect is exacerbated for AR in reporting in journals that assume a conventional experimental report form. The necessary narrative of process descriptions can seem long and ambiguous compared to conventional quantified comparisons. Also, AR has no response to criticism that the intervention should have been conducted differently. Nor is there a finite end point to AR; termination of the project is essentially an arbitrary act. Finally it is difficult to learn AR methods as few university program teach this approach.. STRENGTHS OF AR ­ AR places a heavy emphasis on achieving organisational change in ways that are sensible and sustainable for those involved. It does not rely on recollections of, and articulation by, chosen participants as in interviews. It avoids dependence of the company on researchers and is consistent with reports of improved change success with the engagement of all affected stakeholders. The AR approach can support companies in learning new ways to improve OHS that are not constrained by researchers' control needs and that are uniquely adapted to the organisation in the people in it. To reap these benefits however the researcher must shift from a mode of hypothesis testing to experiential learning. REFERENCES: GRIFFITHS, A. (1999) Scand J Work Environ Health, 25, 589-96.

AR Science · RIGOUR?
­ From methodologies inside the AR study ­ Potential for quantified evaluation exists... but should be company based

Challenges of AR · Acceptance "That's not SCIENCE!"
­ Publication difficulties if experimental anecdotes are expected

· Rigour difficult to define
­ Depends on assessment inside study ­ Info flow is too rich for high resolution tools?

· Analytic transferability
­ No general case

· Constructivist tendencies
­ Partly outside the `bubble of positivism'

· "You should have done it differently"
­ But.. No size fits all ­> improvisation
