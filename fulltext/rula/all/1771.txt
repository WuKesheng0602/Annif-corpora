ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my supervisor and mentor throughout my undergraduate and graduate years, Dr.Russell Viirre, who has educated me and allowed me to flourish as a chemist. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work under his supervision. The knowledge I have gained through his guidance is prized and for that I am deeply appreciative. My progress to date and my continuing interest in chemistry I owe to him. I am extremely grateful to my supervisory and examining committee Dr. Darrick Heyd, Dr. Stephen Wylie and Dr. Robert Gossage who have continued to support me and encourage me during the course of my masters. I am thankful for their helpful and original insight into my project. I hold respect and admiration to their characters both as scientists and individuals. I would like to also extend this thanks to Dr .Dan Foucher and other members of the synthetic chemistry group at Ryerson University. I cannot express in words how grateful I am to have had the opportunity to meet such wonderful people in the laboratory. Thanks to Joanne Bogojeski (aka- JBogo), Robert Denning (aka"chachey"), Julian Kwok (aka- The Kwokster), Augusto Matarazzo (aka- the mattress, G), Patricia Stanescu (aka- "P-town"). There's a lot I could say, but I don't have the time or space, so thank you all for your support! I would like to thank and sincerely apologize to those who have witnessed my fits of rage to which I blame on lack of sleep and caffeine! Jon Ward: thank you for your repetitive (and now infamous) "you are awesome" comments. I don't think you fully appreciate what words like that can do to somebody who is continually

frustrated with lab-related predicaments. Thank you for your consideration in relation to NMR usage. Finally, I would like to thank my family members. My sister Sarah deserves my gratitude for being an inspiration to me for as long as I could remember. I have my parents to thank for my devotion to the field of science. Being the daughter of an engineer and a mathematician, I was taught first-hand the beauty of practical science. This lesson I may have learned a bit late, but they have definitely instilled in me a belief that anything could be achieved through hard work, perseverance and patience (the latter I may need to work on). This very thesis is a true testament of this.

ABSTRACT
Synthesis of Metal-Coordinating Arenediynes and Their Reactivity in Bergman Cyclization, Salma AI-Karmi, Ryerson University, 2009, Master of Science in Molecular Science

The Bergman cycloaromatization (BC) in which a cis-alkene-1,2-diyne (enediyne) cyclizes to form a p-benzyne diradical, typically is a very endothermic reaction, requiring a substantial amount of energy (i.e. high temperature) for it to proceed. This reaction received very little attention until a decade after its discovery, when the natural enediynes were isolated and shown to be the most active antitumor agents ever discovered. Having BC at the heart of their mode of action, these natural enediynes have been very challenging to mimic from synthetic standpoints. Of particular interest is to be able to design and synthesize an enediyne that is stable at room temperature, while also being capable of being triggered to undergo BC under ambient conditions. Although a relatively new concept, metal-induced BC reactions have generally been known to decrease the demanding energy barrier. The work presented here describes several synthetic strategies towards arenediyne crown ethers and the synthesis of several arenediyne hydrazone/Schiffbase ligands with extended n-systems. These synthesized enediynes are useful ligands, capable of metal-coordination and hence potentially decreasing the BC energy barrier. BC reactions of enediyne intermediates are also reported.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 The Enediyne Antibiotics

Ever since the discovery of the calicheamicins, esperamicins and dynemicins 3 in the late 1980s, chemical structures possessing enediyne units have been the subject of avid scientific research (figure 1). The enediynes represent the most potent anti-tumor agents ever discovered 5 with their most interesting feature lying in their unique architectural scaffold, where the common (Z)-1 ,5-diyn-3-ene unit is enclosed in a 9 or 10 membered ring, conveniently positioned around significant functionalities. The arrangement of the enediyne moiety in this way is responsible for their sophisticated mode of action and high degree of potency. 6 The general mechanism of DNA cleavage is highly dependent on this enediyne infrastructure, where nearby functionalities act as a "delivery service" to the target DNA and allow for eventual triggering of the enediyne 'warhead." The consequent change in molecular geometry results in the generation of the highly reactive 1,4-benzenoid radical, capable of quickly abstracting hydrogen atoms from the minor groove of DNA, prompting cell death (figure 2). Key to this mechanism is the generation of this highly unstable biradical via the Bergman cycloaromatization, previously described by Robert Bergman (scheme 1). The advanced cytostatic behavior of these enediynes encouraged researchers to design new enediynes, with the ultimate goal of enhancing selectivity towards tumour cells and minimizing toxicity towards healthy cells. Of particular interest is to be able to design an enediyne that is stable at room temperature, while still being capable of being triggered under physiological conditions.

1.2 The Bergman Cycloaromatization (BC)
The Bergman cyclization (BC) was first reported in a study by Robert Bergman in 1972, where he noted the unique action of acyclic Z-enediynes upon thermal activation. 7 Under pyrolytic conditions, the parent 3-ene-1 ,5-diyne was converted to a stable benzene structure through a highly unstable p-benzyne diradical intermediate in the presence of a hydrogendonor solvent (scheme 1).

The highly endothermic nature of the reaction results in equilibrium favoring the parent enediyne 1 over the active p-benzyne radical. The demanding conditions associated with BC have sparked an interest in modifYing the energetics, in an effort to allow for the reaction to occur under milder conditions. Contributions made by combined computational and experimental studies have shown that four main factors influence the reactivity of Z-enediynes9 :

1.2.1 Designed Enediynes
i)

The Critical distance

With BC being at the heart of triggering this biological cascade of events (see figure 2), many studies have focused on devising means by which to manipulate and influence the process. 9- 11
4

The first generation of synthetic enediynes were designed with the intention of allowing for a clearer understanding of the factors that influence BC (figure 3). The geometry change associated with the enediyne moiety with an accompanied rapid BC in the natural products prompted Nicolaou et a/.
14

12

to believe that BC could be predicted from the cd. The theory was

very well accepted after a series of cyclic enediynes of varying ring sizes were synthesized and tested for their ability to undergo BC.
12

The study provided an apparent correlation between ring ,

size, cd and the ability of these systems to undergo BC.

The study provided by Nicolaou and others specifically demonstrated the importance of cyclic enediynes over their acyclic counterparts.
12 14 ·

Highlighted in this study was the effect of ring

size. The 10-membered ring 3a was found to spontaneously cyclize by comparison with larger rings (3b-3g) which were found to be stable. This difference in behavior was correlated to cd, where a shorter cd promoted an increase in ring strain. 4 This concept was emphasized in earlier studies where other known systems demonstrated similar behavior. 14- 16 Similarly, arenediynes 4 and 5 cyclize readily and this was additionally correlated to optimum cd. The cd range whereby spontaneous cyclization occurs was defined as< 3.31
5

A. 16

The cd theory is regarded as a rough estimation in assessing the overall stability of the enediyne and is not always definite, as demonstrated by various mechanistic studies.
17 18 '

For example, the

arenediyne 6 exhibits an identical cd to its aliphatic counterpart 7 (figure 4), but both display very different BC behavior. 13·20 Thus the alternate theory put forth by Magnus and Snyder
17 20 ·

describing the strain energy difference between GS and TS has become more widely accepted and is regarded as a more accurate representation of enediyne reactivity. Nonetheless, contemporary OFT calculations
21

show a definite correlation between cd and BC reactivity and

in the majority of cases, it has provided a good means of predicting BC activation.

Substituent effects and structural variations within the enediyne core

a) Arenediynes vs. Aliphatic enediynes
The benzannulation effect on BC has been reported many times in literature as being an inhibitory factor in BC activation with an accompanied increase in activation energy by comparison with their aliphatic counterparts. 22 · 23 This is also exemplified in figure 4, where cd is

6

clearly not responsible for the dramatic differences in thermal behavior of 6 and 7. In one study, Nicolaou eta/.
24

noted a dramatic change in BC behavior in redox benzoquinone !hydroquinone

enediynes (scheme 2), where 8 exhibits a slower BC by comparison with 9. These findings have led the authors to suggest that benzannulation is a clear disadvantage (with the electronic properties also clearly varying dramatically). One year later, Nicolaou eta/.
25

demonstrated a

variation in the thermodynamics of their synthesized benzannulated dynemicin derivatives, where the benzannulation effect is more pronounced in 11 by comparison to 10, resulting in an increase in activation energy ofBC. The energy profile shown in figure 6 clearly illustrate the physical consequence of this benzannulation effect, where arenediyne 12 experiences a higher enthalpy energy for cyclization by comparison with its aliphatic counterpart 1.
19 26 27 ' ' Accordingly,

figure 6 also shows a lower

retro-Bergman ring opening energy barrier for 12 by comparison with 1 (figure 5). The differences in BC behavior between benzannulated and aliphatic enediynes is often attributed to a decrease in double bond order 23 and mechanistic variations in H-abstraction abilities. 28 In the latter case, the slower (higher energy) H-abstraction in arenediynes has led to a lower activation barrier for-the retro-Bergman, unrelated to singlet-triplet splittings. 28 It was clear that benzannulation offered a dramatic increase in the endothermicity of BC and even changed the overall rate-determining step of the reaction
29 30 ·

(where aliphatic enediynes experience a rate

determining step in cyclization rather than the slow H-abstraction step experienced by arenediynes). In such cases, the concentrations ofH-donors become important. 31

The situation is further complicated with studies that suggest that benzannulation itself is not enough to promote lower enediyne cyclization rates. The activation energy profiles of the cyclization of several acyclic enediynes established by Grissom eta/.
33

demonstrate this well

with the arenediyne 12 cyclizing more readily than the nonaromatic counterpart 13 (it is also of importance to note the cd values). Through this study and others like it,
34 35 '

it becomes apparent

the benzannulation effect is more pronounced in cyclic enediynes, where the ring strain effect may play an important role.

Despite these observations, benzannulated systems offer some advantages. Although arenediynes are incapable of being substituted at the vinyl end which have been known to influence BC dramatically,
23 26 · arenediynes

are attractive synthetic candidates that offer

additional functionalization sites (figure 8). This permits extended capacities to electronically and sterically manipulate enediyne cyclization. Evidently, the ultimate goal is to synthesize a drug candidate that does not experience a limited shelf-life, a limitation that is likely with the aliphatic enediynes where polymerization, isomerization, retro-Bergman rearrangements and potential premature activation become concerning and likely events.

b) Electronic and Steric Factors influencing BC With the geometric, steric and electronic factors playing a crucial role in thermal cyclization of the enediynes, it soon became obvious that BC control and manipulation can be achieved through appropriate functionalization at key positions of the enediyne motif. Thermal BC activation can often be controlled through the introduction of strain or manipulation of electronic factors.
26 37 ·

Substitution within and surrounding the enediyne functionality is fragile, where the slightest structural modifications present a dramatic change in BC activation. 36 Not surprisingly, substituents promoting radical stabilization are critical, especially in the case of highly unstable sigma-type radicals such as the p-benzyne radical intermediate involved in BC. Substitution at the alkyne termini is often damaging, where often times, variation of electronic and steric properties at this position leads to increased thermal activation temperatures.

33

A few exceptions

exist with the dibromo and dichloro enediynes which were able to cyclize at much lower temperatures (180 °C) with modest yields

position were beneficial in lowering the BC barrier, but the detailed valence-bond study by Schreiner eta/. indicate that only a acceptors are to be considered effective. 40 These findings are in agreement with the findings by Schmittel
39

who found that introduction of electron

withdrawing phenyl groups were just as effective in facilitating BC. Contrary to these finds are introduction of halogen substituents (weak a acceptors and strong
1t

acceptors) which were

reported by some groups to be effective in the same manner 23 but labeled by others as retarding BC .
26 35 ·

The general consensus is that EWG destabilize the ground state or offer transition state

stabilization.23 For the same reason, electron-donating groups (EDG) at this position retard BC dramatically. 23 In the case of arenediynes, the introduction of 4,5-substituents has led to some dispute in the effect of EDG on BC activation. While many authors have claimed that the introduction of EDG at this position is accompanied by an increase in the BC barrier, 39· 41 Bowles et a/. 36 have exhibited an increase in the overall yield of the reaction with their systems. Alabugin eta/. have claimed that the nature of substituents at this position do not offer a grave effect on BC cyclization rates. 42 This point was emphasized by various other authors, 43 suggesting that these substituents are too remote from radical formation to have a direct influence on cyclization rates. This promoted the notion that 3, 6- substituents close to the enediyne moiety and therefore in proximal positions to radical formation, are significant in facilitating thermal reactivity. Alabugin et a/. have shown that the nature of the substituent at this position is critical on

12

deciding the overall fate ofBC.

Interestingly, the introduction of repulsive (or steric)

substituents have been shown to decrease the BC barrier by providing repulsion between the substituent and the in-plane alkyne orbitals with an accompanied decrease in the cd. 26 H-bond acceptors or donors at this position have been known to stabilize the ground state through Hbonding with the in plane n-bonds.

1.2.2 Metal-induced BC reactions: The Metalloenediynes
The dramatic influence of electronic factors imposed particularly at the acetylenic positions spawned the design of enediynes through the revolutionary development of the metalloenediynes. The concept behind the use of metals to lower BC activation barriers was not

13

exploited until relatively recently, with Konig and McPhee's efforts to decrease the BC barrier through their prepared enediyne crown ethers
35 44 '

(figure 9a). The rationale behind

metalloenediyne design is quite elementary; these enediynes are defined by the possession of ligating systems at the acetylenic or propargylic positions resulting in an anticipated increase in thermal cyclization upon metal chelation. The enhanced BC reactivity is the result of what Basak eta/.
45

refer to as the generation of a "metallocycle", where the metal facilitates the

formation of a Hcyclic network." The complexity of this notion was emphasized when in some cases, metal-coordination afforded a detrimental effect on BC activation.
45

Studies involving complexation of sodium to the acyclic bisbenzo acyclic crown ether 15 led to a bissodium complex. 35 Complexation with potassium afforded a potassium sandwich. In both these cases, BC was retarded significantly. Two years later, McPhee and Kerwin
44 35

postulated

that incorporation of the crown ether ring directly onto the enediyne chromophore would dramatically facilitate BC. They reported the synthesis of 16 and its strong binding affinity towards alkali metals, but did not include comparative BC studies. Soon after, Buchwald reported the synthesis of the bisphosphino ligand 17 (figure 9c) where the importance of the metal center was emphasized through complexation studies with platinum, palladium and mercury. 46 This study, like many succeeding ones, demonstrated that metals facilitating the formation of strained square planar complexes resulted in a decrease in cd which translated to an increase in BC reactivity by comparison with the free ligand. 23 By contrast, metals forming tetrahedral geometries often result in noteworthy stability by comparison to the free ligand.
23

Many cited examples now show that metal center geometry is accountable for stark differences in BC reactivities. 47 Since then, a number of different ligands have been synthesized including bipyridal, amino and diimino enediynes
46

(see figures IO, II and I2) In recent years, many

14

groups have worked at determining the factors involved in facilitating BC through metal coordination.

With the metal center geometry being crucial in BC reactivity, it becomes clear that ligand flexibility also plays a crucial and related role in BC activation. Thennodynamically, it is obvious and expected that the rigidity of the ligand itself offers significant contributions to the control of thermal cyclizations. The study by Rawat eta/. further confinns the importance of metal geometry on confonnationally rigid ligands versus more flexible ones (accurately identified by the number of sp 3 atoms amid the enediyne functionality) with their synthesized bis(pyridine) and bis (quinoline) enediynes.
48

Taken together, the study shows that oxidation

state of the metal and therefore its inherent ligand field configurations are strongly correlated with ligand flexibility. 48 Perhaps an even more lucid example exists in a recent publication by Bhattacharyya et a/.,
47

where the synthesis of enediynes 18a and 18b (figure 10) experienced

additional strain provided by the incorporated ethylenediamine bridge, facilitating a decrease in

15

cd . Interestingly, the study demonstrates that the cd for all metals tested (Zn(II), Cu(II) and Pd(II) were strangely similar irrespective of the metal's geometric preference, which in conformationally more flexible ligands would lead to dramatic cd variations. 23 While the cd remained remarkably unchanged, comparisons in BC behavior between Cu (II) and Zn (II) lead to a 60°C difference despite the difference in metal geometries. Years before the synthesis of

18a and 18b, Basak et a/. 49 reported the aromatic analogue 19 which experienced similar BC
behavior upon complexation with Cu (II). The relationship between strain and ligand flexibility is an argument made often in literature and has even been appointed as the main cause of differences in reactivity with Basak's systems 13 upon varying lengths of the alkyl chains (and hence increasing flexibility) Thus it is evident that BC is convolutedly interdisciplinary and highly dependent on numerous features involving geometric considerations within the metal center, ligand flexibility and steric bulk at the acetylenic positions.

1.2 Thesis objectives a) Arenediyne crown ethers
Some enediyne macrocycles have been prepared previously with the intention of decreasing BC barriers upon complexation with various metals (figure 9). It is irrefutable that in the majority of cases, metal-induced BC has led to a decrease in the demanding energy barrier required for cyclization. It is intriguing that enediyne 15 is one of the very few examples where the BC barrier is elevated upon chelation. The thought of the synthesis of 16 being a good candidate for decreasing the BC barrier is justified, with the enediyne being enclosed in a cyclic network of ligating arms. The unreported BC reactions for this compound is puzzling, but it is possible that the aliphatic nature of these enediynes promoted destructive rearrangement (retro-Bergman) products or that temperature increases associated with the chelating structure of 16 encouraged decomposition/decomplexation. To this end, we envisioned an aromatic alternative of 16, the synthesis ofarenediyne crown ethers 23a and 23b (figure I I) where the retro-Bergman rearrangement product is not possible and where aromaticity is potentially advantageous (for the reasons stated above). Furthermore, 23 is also an improved thermal BC candidate by comparison to 15 owing to its cyclic nature. The excellent and notorious metal-binding ability of crown ethers make them ideal ligands for the purpose of investigating the effect of chelation on BC barriers; a valuable study especially with regard to cyclic ligating enediynes. The effect of ring size on 23 is particularly interesting for studying BC thermodynamics, since 23a possesses one less ligating oxygen but exhibits additional strain by comparison with 23b.

b) Arenediyne !mines and Hydrazones
In 2000, Basak reported the interesting behavior of his benzannulated diimine ligands upon complexation with Ni(II) and Cu (II) (figure 12, 24b and 24c respectively), where a significant increase in BC onset temperatures were reported by comparison with the free ligand. 53 These findings contradicted those reported by Zaleski's rigid ligands previously described (figure 10). It is interesting to note that in most cases, complexation leads to at least a modest decrease in BC activation barriers, with only a few examples in the literature demonstrating otherwise. 53 This explanation provided by Basak was described as a classic case where the metal is forcing "the acetylenic carbons to move away from each other."
54

The increase in the BC activation barrier is

in this case not surprising, with the steric bulk and repulsive forces (mainly by the proximal position of the oxygens) associated with incoming proximity of the acetylenes in BC. A year later, Rawat eta/. 54 reported Mg2+ induced BC with their aliphatic diimine enediyne ligand 25a which impressively experiences BC at room temperature (notably the lowest thermal cyclization temperature experienced by an acyclic enediyne). A drawback to their synthetic design was that 25a degraded over a 48 hour period, probably as a consequence of both the aliphatic nature of the ligand and the lack of conjugation which makes the imine prone to hydrolysis. Intrigued by the fascinating outcomes of these experiments, we wanted to prepare arenediyne Schiff bases with the general structure shown in figure 12 (structure 26). Our design varies from 25a in that the extended 1t system is likely to provide additional stability and favourable n-cation interactions upon chelation. Additionally, the sp 2 hybridization on the ligating nitrogen provides accompanying ligand rigidity, of vital importance especially with regard to acyclic enediyne ligands. Of particular interest is to observe the thermal BC behavior of these imines in the

19

presence and absence of metals and to see whether our imines are comparative to those previously synthesized.

In relation to this, the synthesis of hydrazone 27 is very attractive in that it could display selfquenching properties which we believe to be feasible through the existence of a structurally similar known persistent stable radical. The p-benzyne radical intermediate in BC has been very mysterious, with very few experimental data related to it, owing to its sharp Iifetime. 27 Selfquenching enediynes have been known to exist, with donor subsituents being positioned in the ortho position 8 and in the 1,6 positions 33 (figure 13). The asymmetrical substitution in 28 and 29

20

makes self-quenching feasible from only one end of the generated p-benzyne radical and an external hydrogen donor (i.e. 1,4-cyclohexadiene) is required to quench the opposite end. Our design should permit self-quenching from both ends intramolecularly. The kinetics of this is intriguing and should in our opinion, provide a more accurate quantitative study of these radicals.

2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1 Crown Ether synthesis
Scheme 5 shows the initial one pot synthesis routes investigated for the synthesis of desired arenediyne crown ethers 23c and 23d. The arenediynes synthesized originated from introduction of the alkyne functionalities from an ortho disubsituted aryl halide via Sonogashira coupling. 55 The first objective was to find optimal Sonogashira coupling conditions for the synthesis of diol intermediates which could consequently be used as the nucleophile for typical substitution reactions (scheme 6). This was pursued two ways: either through direct coupling with propargyl alcohol (39) (Table 1, entries 2-6, 14 and 16) or through coupling with propargyl benzoate (37), followed by consequent hydrolysis of the ester (Table 1, entries 1, 7 and I 0-13).

ethers 23c and 23d: a) SN2 subsitution where the arenediyne is the nuc/eophi/e b) SN2 substitution where the arenediyne is the e/ectrophi/e c) tandem Sonogashira coupling.

Table I shows the Sonogashira coupling conditions for the synthesis of various arenediyne intermediates. Coupling with 1,2-dibromobenzene as the aryl halide (entries 1-8) proved to be unsuccessful for synthesis of the sought after ortho-substituted enediynes (except entry 4 that yielded the disubstituted product in low yield). The less reactive nature of the aryl bromides is further emphasized by juxtaposing results obtained by coupling with the more reactive aryl iodides (entries 10-17). The synthesis of 34 provides a cheaper alternative to the more expensive I ,2-diiodobenzene which are virtually interchangeable in terms of reactivity.

24

The result in entry 9 is perplexing, but failure to generate any product is likely due to the high vapour pressure ofTMS acetylene where entry into the gas phase is facilitated by the preliminary degassing process in the Schlenk flask. In the case of coupling between less reactive aryl bromides and propargyl alcohol the choice of ligand becomes very important. 5
6

The results present a clear trend in reference to the nature of palladium catalyst used in that the initial oxidation states of palladium seem to be influential on the yield. Reactions in which Pd (0) is directly employed generally resulted in a greater yield in the coupling products by comparison with Pd (II) catalysts (this is obvious through comparisons between entries 12-16 and entry 10). It is probable that this dissimilarity between the two coupling performances is kinetic in naturewhere the Pd(O) experiences a faster oxidative addition step by comparison with Pd(II), which needs to be reduced before being converted to the active catalytic species. This could be enough to facilitate the Glaser coupling, 57 where the coupling between the alkynes generates a homo coupled product, thereby exhausting the alkyne and copper resources in the reaction mixture. In the addition of the PPh 3 ligands separately in situ, the assumption that all existing palladium sources will be reduced is tentative. While there have been many examples ofPd (II) catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions, the choice of ligand has also changed invariably to promote higher yields. Once again, varying electronic and steric properties of the ligand through introduction of the bulkier ligand seem to promote an increase in the yield. The relationship between varying ligand properties and efficiency of coupling remains unclear, but it is presumed that sterically hindered phosphane ligands promote facile oxidative addition and reductive e ) 1mmat10n steps.
· · · 56

25

Many preceding studies, such as the study by Gelman and Buchwald

58

have eliminated copper

co-catalysts altogether, when they found that Cui either inhibited the reaction or decreased the yields significantly. This is likely due to an increased rate in the Glaser homo coupling, which is known to be facilitated by the presence of these copper catalysts and is more specifically problematic for less reactive aryl halides (aryl chlorides and to some extent, the aryl bromides) which exert stronger influences on reaction rates. 5 This is perhaps a contributing factor to the low yields in some entries, but this effect if present, is not considered substantial since without exclusion of Cui, entries 14- I 7 are able to generate excellent yields. Entry 3 is unusual in that a copper (II) promoter was able to achieve effective coupling, a very unconventional choice in Sonogashira coupling where copper (I) promoters are traditionally used. In this case, it is questionable whether modification of coupling conditions, such as ratio of alkyne to aryl halide could promote higher yields of ortho substituted products. The best results were attained when amines were used neat in accordance with original Sonogashira coupling conditions. 55 With reductive elimination being the rate determining step and with the amine/base having an integral role in this phase of the mechanism, it becomes clear that the choice of base (more specifically amines) is critical kinetically. 59 The use of triethylamine as the solvent afforded higher yields than when n-BuNH 2 (entries 3 and 4) and diisopropylamine (DIPA) (entry 13) were used as the solvent. Previous studies have reported high coupling yields with the use of both n-BuNH 2 and DIPA
75 6

and the kinetic mechanistic

studies by Tougerti eta/. suggests that the use of secondary amines promote an accelerating effect in the oxidative addition step. 5 In the latter study, piperidine was found as a great model amine, which evidently mirrors the basicity of triethylamine, n-BuNH 2 and DIPA. It is difficult to perform a comparative study between the amines used, since the aryl halide was varied in
9

26

entries with n-BuNH2, which is a likely reason for the decelerating effect of the reaction. In spite of this, it is assumed and likely that under similar conditions (i.e. use of the aryl iodide), nBuNH2 is expected to generate results similar to when Et3N was used. The use of DIPA is noticeably responsible for the decrease in yield when comparing entries 12 and 13 where only the base was varied. Despite success with the use of this base in previous Sonogashira coupling conditions, DIPA is not ideal for the coupling reactions shown. Given the basicity and nature ofDIPA (i.e being a secondary amine) the reason for the poor yields is perplexing. Table 1 also shows that using alternative solvents results in appreciably lower yields. The importance of deaerated reaction conditions is emphasized when entries 12 and 15 are compared, where the latter entry ensured inert conditions through the use of the "freeze-pump- thaw" technique (generating a 15% increase in the yield). The majority of the reactions were performed with the application of heat, but performing the reaction at room temperature proved to be valuable (comparison between entries 14 and 16). Increasing reaction temperature has been linked to dramatically facilitating the Glaser coupling side reaction, which could account for the lower yield in entry 14. Only slight% yield differences were found between the two entries. Thus it would be premature to suggest that temperature changes are detrimental in the coupling reactions shown, especially when considering entry 16 where a high yield was obtained. The synthesis of crown ethers have for sometime been very challenging and often inefficient due to competing side-reactions. 62 Currently, three general synthetic strategies have been devised to minimize this effect and promote cyclization:

27

1. The high dilution principle, whereby carrying the reaction out under dilute conditions prevents/minimizes intermolecular interactions. 62 2. The template effect, whereby an incorporated metal encourages intramolecular cyclization. 62 3. The cesium effect, where electronic variations promote cyclization. 62 '63 Conventional crown ether syntheses through typical nucleophilic substitution via deprotonation of30 were unsuccessful for the synthesis of the desired crown ethers 23c and 23d. Table 2 shows the conditions used when 30 is used as a nucleophile. In all cases, starting material was recovered, with the exception of entries 9 and 10 where 23c was synthesized in low yields. Initially, we attempted the synthesis of23c and 23d with synthesized ditosylates 3lb and 31d, but this resulted in complicated mixtures and unidentified products, in accordance with McPhee and Kerwin's findings. 44 The authors attributed this to the instability of the enediyne in the strongly basic conditions necessary for alkylation which is strongly supported by the fact that the enediynes undergo isomerization to more reactive allene-eneynes through Myers-Saito cyclizations under such conditions. The recovery of starting material is puzzling, but it is likely attributable to consumption of the electrophiles in elimination side-reactions, where the basic conditions seem to be predominantly promoting elimination, leading to vinyl ether synthesis. Treatment with Cs2C03 (entry 7) was carried out to facilitate ring closure after reports claimed the use of cesium salts afforded higher yields in crown ether synthesis.
63
64

This had no effect on

the outcome of the reaction. The low yield afforded by entries 9 and 10 could be credited to the iodide's leaving group ability which is manifested kinetically. Unfortunately, the reaction generated vinyl elimination by-product 40 which could not be chromatographically separated from arenediyne crown ether 23c (mass spectrometry confirms the presence of both species).

28

Interestingly, 40 was isolated in its pure form and exhibited very different TLC behavior to the crown ether/vinyl ether combination, possibly suggesting an affinity between the two (figure 14 shows the 1H NMR spectrum ofthe 23c/40 mixture). So far, this unusual consequence remains unexplained, but we hypothesize that the vinyl ether maybe forming a pseudorotaxane like species (also supported by the I: 1 ratio of crown ether: vinyl ether combination in the 1H NMR spectrum, figure 14). Our findings encouraged us to investigate alternate routes towards the synthesis of arenediyne crown ethers 23. Consequently, we attempted conversion of30 to electrophiles 32a-e, (scheme 5b) which we envisioned could be reacted with glycols 33a and 33b under similar conditions. Ditosylate 32a could not be isolated in its pure form, though 1H NMR showed the presence of characteristic tosylate peaks. The crude mixture was allowed to react in a substitution reaction, but resulted in complicated mixtures by TLC. Synthesis of mesylate 32b was performed with the intention of bromination to 32c. Procedures towards the step-wise synthesis was identical to Basak's methodology, 49 but attempts at synthesizing 32b were unsuccessful resulting in only starting material and/or monosubstituted bromo/mesylate products. Attempts at synthesizing and isolating 32d failed, with the generation of what initially appeared to be the disubstituted dichloride 32d by H NMR, but was later found to be inconsistent ~ith the
1

mlz peaks. Instead, the mass spectrum was indicative of a structure that possessed additional
chlorides (m/z =320 and m/z= 285/287) which was confinned to be Bergman products 41 and 42 (scheme 7). The reaction generated these products through quenching of the p-benzyne radicals with chlorine atoms (presumably supplied by thionyl chloride), at just 70 °C, very different thermal behavior from when diol 30 was heated directly at comparatively elevated temperatures with 1,4-CHD as the quencher (see following paragraphs for a discussion ofBC of diol 30).

BC product 41 illustrates a classic example where va~iation of electronic properties at the acetylenic positions allows for dramatic influences in thermal behavior. The presence of 42 as the dominant product is captivating (as indicated by relative abundances) because failure of chlorination at the acetylenic position preserves the electronic properties of 30.

31

This result (by comparison with direct BC attempts with 30) possibly indicates a discriminatory effect in relation to the quencher involved. It may also indicate that the concentration of quencher is not as important as the nature of the quencher (1 0 eq vs. 1OOeq with thionyl chloride and 1,4-CHD as the quenchers respectively), a relatively unexplored concept with respect to enediyne cyclization chemistry. With Rawat et al.
65

claiming one of the most facile cyclization

temperatures in their aliphatic acyclic diamine enediyne (at 106°C), we report the lowest temperature to date for a non-coordinated acyclic enediyne with an unconventional trapping agent.

Tandem Sonogashira attempts through coupling of 34 with synthesized diynes 35a and 35b resulted in arylation on both ends to give the structures 43a and 43b respectively. We proposed that dramatically diluting the reaction would result in mono arylation, but this continued to preferentially generate 43a and 43b and prevented the synthesis of the desired product. Attempts

32

at cyclization through this method were attempted again, where Na2C03 was strategically chosen to facilitate cyclization through an assumed metal-template effect (data not shown). This led to analogous results. The presence of identical leaving groups on 34 is problematic, but the results also suggest that cyclization is more demanding making cyclization through this particular method doubtfuL

Collectively, these results imply that a one-pot synthesis is grueling and improbable. This led us to pursue multiple-step synthetic strategies which would allow for the generation of a common intermediate 44 where covalent attachment on one end has been prearranged, making cyclization thermodynamically more plausible (scheme 9). In 2001, Dai eta/.
66

reported the first example

of an intramolecular Sonogashira coupling for the synthesis of highly strained 53 using this very ideology (scheme 10). We speculated that under very dilute conditions, we would be able to optimize conditions for the synthesis of 23a-b, which fortunately do not possess the strain exhibited by 53. Initially, we attempted a Sonogashira coupling using a 4-fold excess of diynes 35a and 35b, in hope of synthesizing 44e (scheme 11 ). Regrettably, the synthesis of 44e could not be achieved through this method and instead, resulted in the synthesis of 43c and 43d. This result was surprising given the reaction conditions (i.e. excess diyne). For further investigation,

33

we attempted a similar route through Sonogashira coupling with 49 (scheme 9c). As before, the diarylated product 56e was the only product isolated and identified (scheme I2). Consequently, the proposed synthetic strategy proposed in scheme II and I2 showed no promise and was abandoned. With the Nicholas reaction being predominantly used in the synthesis of the enediyne antibiotics, 67 we attempted a Nicholas reaction between 45 and 46 (path a, scheme 9). This route was pursued after complexation on both alkynes (57) could not be derived from 30 (scheme I3). The former would have been an attractive candidate for a Nicholas reaction with glycols 33a and 33b, ultimately leading to the synthesis of23c and 23d. The inability to attain 58 in a 5-fold excess of dicobalt octacarbonyl is reminiscent of findings by Jones et al./4 who were unable to prepare their dicomplexed enediyne. The authors attributed this to the rapid decomposition of their complex to complicated mixtures. In addition to 57, attempts at preparing 58 led to the isolation of various compounds that could not be identified by NMR spectroscopy. The instability reported by Jones eta/. is difficult to account for since introduction ofCo2(C0)6 at the acetylenic positions have in previous literature sources accounted for reduced strain and even promoted stability by comparison to unbound counterparts. 68 For this reason, failure to prepare

58 is not likely steric-related. Dramatic variation of electronic properties of the conjugated
system through complexation at one end is perhaps a more valid explanation. Literature examples where complexation is carried out on both ends of the enediyne are scarce. 67

Accordingly, synthesis of 47 via Sonogashira coupling with dibromobenzene allowed for a reasonable starting ground for synthesis of 44c. The asymmetric nature of 47 results in the use of synthesized 46 as the nucleophile (scheme 14). Yet again, this path was also unpromising and resulted in no evidence of the formation of 44d. Sonogashira coupling with commercially available 1,2-dibromobenzene afforded low yields of 47 (scheme 14a) which further emphasizes the poor reactivity of aryl bromides (refer to entry 17, table 1).The two-fold excess of39 generated no evidence of the disubstiuted diol (by TLC), but other species with considerably low Rr's (which also happened to stain KMN0 4) suggests the consumption of 39 in polymerization as a more favourable route under these experimental conditions.

Complexation to give 45 (scheme 14c) was undemanding, but it soon became obvious that 45 was easily prone to decomplexation to 47. This behaviour is atypical of derived complexed cobalt carbonyl propargyl species, since they have been previously known to be conveniently air stable. 68 Attempted Nicholas reaction (scheme 14d) with 45 and 46 resulted in 47 and other
38

complicated mixtures that could not be identified by NMR, with no evidence of the formation of the alkylated alkyne 44d. The presence of the alkyne functionality in 46 could be a reason for this, where residual cobalt carbonyl in solution (especially given the instability of 45) could have resulted in further complexation, promoting other side-reactions such as cyclizations, which have been documented in literature.
67

Furthermore, given that the generation of secondary
67

carbocations drastically reduce the yield

(by comparison with tertiary carbocations) it is likely

that the nature of 45 as a primary reactant in this case makes it predisposed to being inactive. The complicated mixtures isolated from this reaction could be owed to polymerization of 45, where the generated carbocation is rapidly trapped by another neighbouring 45. This is plausible, given that this has been known to occur in poor solvating solvents such as dichloromethane as a result of promoted intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
67 69 71 · -

Preparation of 44d via a typical substitution reaction with 47 as the nucleophile and 48 as the electrophile were unsuccessful (scheme 9c). It is notable that 47 was recovered in good% recovery, reminiscent of results obtained by scheme 5a. With time, tosylate 48 was consumed, probably in the formation of a vinyl elimination product which is facilitated by the strongly basic conditions, and the labile nature of the leaving group.

2.2. Synthesis o(Arenediyne SchiffBase and Hydrazone Podands
Imine synthesis is usually a reversible acid catalyzed process and with optimized conditions, can lead to versatile and high-yielding syntheses (scheme 15). 72 Often times, nucleophilic attack is a slow process with equilibrium favouring the parent carbonyl being of particular concern. 72 The challenge lies in finding the appropriate conditions, since the presence of acid is required for the formation of the iminium ion (through protonation of the hydroxyl) but conversely, in a highly

39

acidic environment, nucleophilic addition can be prevented from occurring.

72

At the same time,

the chemistry of the carbonyl functionality can be taken advantage of, with the electronegativity of the attached oxygen and the trigonally hybridized carbon making the carbon prone to nucleophilic attack . This point is especially valid for aldehydes, where reactivity is enhanced through obvious electronic and steric properties. While nitrogen based enediynes have been extensively synthesized
49 52 54 4 75 - · ,7 , 73

the enediyne

diimines 24a and 25a aforementioned are the only known disubstiuted imino ligands synthesized in literature. As previously mentioned, the sp 3 hybridized carbon disconnecting the sp 2 hybridized nitrogen can have severe consequences both thermodynamically and especially in relation to stability. The authors have synthesized their enediynes through a condensation reaction where the enediyne is the amine. We envisioned a synthesis of diimine ligands with extended 1t-systems through an enediyne aldehyde 59 in which a simple condensation with various amines would give a diimine with the general structure in 26 (scheme 16). This design is also advantageous in relation to metal-induced thermal activations, where 7t-complexation usually results in geometric and electronic influences manifested through a decreased the thermal activation barrier.
54

Initially, synthesis of 59 was attempted through mild oxidation of 30 with PCC (scheme 17a). The reaction afforded a 28% yield of 59. The low yield and the considerable mass of polymeric material generated by this method persuaded us to pursue additional routes towards 59. Furthermore, this method prevented 59 from being isolated in its pure form, with persistent impurities visible by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Sonogashira coupling with commercially available propiolaldehyde diethyl acetal (PADA) (60) was used to synthesize a diacetal intermediate 61 , which was then hydrolyzed to 59 using the conditions shown in scheme 17b. Noteworthy is the impressive yield obtained in the synthesis of

41

59 with exactly 2eq of 60, since the Sonogashira coupling conditions denoted in table 1 required

excess alkyne. Lemhadri eta/. have reported high isolated yields (ranging from 70-94%) for coupling reactions with several bromobenzenes and PADA. 76 The work done by this group was aimed at synthesizing monosubstituted PADA derivatives through activation of the dibromobenzenes by using the exotic ligand Tedicyp. We report the synthesis of disubstituted product 61 in good yield with inexpensively synthesized reagent 34. Surprisingly, hydrolysis of 61 proved to be fastidious and was not as straightforward as originally perceived. Various other hydrolysis conditions were attempted (table 3) but mostly resulted in either recovered 61 or impractical yields of 59. Prior to finding acceptable hydrolysis conditions, a one-pot synthesis was attempted where acetal 61 was subjected to acidic conditions in the presence of the hydrazine/amine This route was based on the assumption that 61 could be converted directly to 26, with the release of ethanol from the acetal, rather than water from the aldehyde 59. Scheme 18 shows our efforts to synthesize hydrazone 27 in this fashion. With 3eq ofDNPH (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine) and with the reaction taking place at room temperature, the mono substituted acetal 62 was isolated in a 58% yield, with no evidence of formation of27 even after one week. This Jed to the assumption that reaction of the acetal was very gradual and that the presence of the hydrazone functionality at one end may have a significant impact on the solubility. This was attempted again with 5eq ofDNPH and with the application of heat to see if temperature changes influence yields.

Asymmetrical substitution was also encountered when the synthesis of 65 was attempted. Enediyne 65 was sought after as potential tetra-dendate ligand through condensation of 59 with o-anisidine (63). Unfortunately, all synthetic attempts led to mono substituted products (scheme 20). The 1H NMR spectrum of these products demonstrated additional peaks and integrations, leading to the assumption that these products existed as geometric isomers of 64. Mass spectrometry confirmed these suspicions. The experimental conditions in table 4 are very telling. Conditions used to prepare Basak's 53 24a (entry 5) and Zaleski's
54

25a (entry I) both resulted in only starting material by TLC.

Interestingly, the synthesis of25a was effortless, with the reaction going to completion at just 2.5 hours( with a reasonable yield of75%). The recovery of starting material and fairly low yield of 64 suggests a synthetic challenge with a structural motive, which is probably due to the highly conjugated nature of the aldehyde 59. This high degree of conjugation (which was previously described as an evident advantage in the synthetic design of these imine enediynes) is also a disadvantage, since this extended
1t

system in 59 can cause substantial stability and lower the

overall energy of the molecule. This is manifested here with themodynamic consequences. For this reason, the sp 3 hybridized carbon on the imine nitrogens separating the enediyne functionality in both 24a and 25a is synthetically more attainable through their respective enediyne amines. Furthermore, in the synthesis of these imines, nucleophilic addition is expected to happen twice within the same molecule, adding to the difficulty of synthesis. It is apparent through the entries in table 4 that the introduction of acetic acid (as a catalyst) encourages some synthetic manipulations, but is not enough to promote synthesis of desired 65. This is also evident through the increase in yield experienced when acetic acid was used as a solvent for synthesis of 59.

In all cases, reactants 59:63 were mixed in a I :2 ratio

46

The increase in yield of the latter in excess ofDNPH persuaded the introduction of a 5-fold excess of63 (entry not shown on table) but resulted only in complicated mixtures. The use of ethanol decreased yields and could perhaps be attributed to intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. These solvent effects are also encountered in previous studies, where it was shown that alcohols as solvents were beneficial in the synthesis of low-melting soluble derivatives, while less soluble compounds required less polar solvents such as chloroform. 77 A comparative study of solvent effects is difficult with the results in table 4, but the slight increase in yield through the employment of dichloromethane may support this notion. Thus the use of an aprotic higher boiling solvent would have made an interesting comparison. As previously mentioned, the nature of aldehyde 59 at first glance makes it an attractive candidate for nucleophilic additions of this sort, with the carbonyl being an excellent site for nucleophilic attack. It is clear however (as demonstrated through experimental evidence) that delocalization of the 1t electrons could severely impact the reactivity of the aldehyde. Furthermore, a steric argument could be made if the starting materials were bulky, but with the carbonyl group belonging to an aldehyde and the amine being a primary amine, this argument, at first, seems flawed. The steric theory was tested when 59 was allowed to react with I, 1dimethylhydrazine 66 to allow for a synthesis of hydrazone 67, in our eyes, a less sterically demanding molecule. The theme of asymmetry is persistent, with 59 appearing to be fastidious, but notable is the dramatic increase in monosubstituted product (68) and gradual increase of disubstituted product 67. This emphasizes that low yields and lack of reactivity is perhaps partially steric related, but it is also sensible to assume that the prime reason is as a result of the substantial stability of 59. Reactions involving 63 could perhaps result in a more sterically demanding tetrahedral transition state, given the bulkiness of the phenyl ring and the methoxy

47

substituent. Nucleophilic attack is therefore more challenging with 63 as a nucleophile. This theory would have been strongly supported with the use of other, less bulkier amines for a valuable comparison. The ability to synthesize hydrazone 27 in modest yields could be attributed to the solvent used, where the abundance of acid are more promising for the synthesis.

2. 3 Related BC reactions
The high-yielding and relatively cheap synthesis of diol 30 encouraged its use as a substrate for some preliminary BC reactions. In particular, we were interested in comparing the BC behavior of 30 as a free ligand (scheme 22a) and in metal-induced BC with calcium hydride serving the dual role as a base and source ofCa2+ (scheme 22b). Initial experiments involving y-terpinene as the hydrogen-donor generated a new spot by TLC with additional observed peaks in the aromatic
48

region of the H NMR spectrum. This product however could not be isolated despite chromatographic efforts, possibly due to contamination with p-cymene (aromatized y-terpinene). Consequently, we could not accurately appoint these peaks to the BC product 69, due to significant complications in the spectrum. The employment of 1,4-CHD as the quencher would result in the generation of benzene upon hydrogen abstraction, a lower boiling solvent that could be easily removed in vacuo.

Using a 40-fold excess of 1,4-CHD, diol 30 was heated at 170 °C in a sealed tube in DMSO (scheme 23).The reaction generated
::=

10% of what was initially thought to be the naphthalene

derivative 69. The 1H NMR spectrum of the isolated product was suggestive of a Schreiner cyclization product (fulvene 70) evident through the two additional peaks in the vinylic region at : : : 5.2 and 5.6 ppm (figure 15). This finding is remarkable since this type of cyclization is common within eneyneallene type systems, with only a few examples in literature supporting 49

enediynes cyclizing to fulvenes. 78 This is because the generation of the fulvenic radical intermediate is extremely endothermic, with an activation barrier of:::; 30-35 kcal!mol, resulting in this process being::::; 10 kcal/mol more endothermic than generation of the p-benzyne radical.
27 78 ·

The existence of70 suggests that H-abstraction rates were variable. It is already

established that trapping of the p-benzyne radical does not occur simultaneously, with the first H-abstraction step being 1 kcal/mol more endothermic than the second, 31 but this usually results in the formation of the naphthalene BC product. Unfortunately, a valid carbon spectrum confirming the presence of70 could not be obtained as a result of insufficient product recovery.

At this juncture, the results are perplexing, especially when juxtaposed with the findings depicted in scheme 7, where quenching was obtainable at just 70 °C with only IOeq ofSOCb. The result of the latter experiment suggests the formation of the p-benzyne radical at a much lower

51

temperature than when heated at 160 °C (a significant 90 °C difference). This implies that abstraction of chlorine is more exothermic than abstraction with hydrogen
31

systems, where both yield of the naphthalene and rates were dramatically different upon heating with trapping agents CBr4 and CCI 4 by comparison with 1,4-CHD. Mechanistic studies have already shown that hydrogen abstraction by the p-benzyne is remarkably slow

and is especially

challenging for the benzannulated enediynes, where it is the rate-determining step. 22 Comparative trapping studies of the p-benzyne trapping is lacking, but Pickard eta/.
21

have

shown that the success of H-donating abilities of different hydrogen donors (methane, methanol and 1,4-CHD) were deeply correlated with bond dissociation energies. These studies have been limited to hydrogen donor trapping agents making the varying rates of abstraction experienced here difficult to account for, but the electronegativity of the trapping agents involved are remarkably divergent and this could be a potential explanation for the striking kinetic variations. With many studies claiming the superiority ofEWG at the acetylenic positions for BC, we were curious to observe the BC temperature of aldehyde 59. The BC temperature of 59 is especially attractive, since steric bulk at this position is lower by comparison to Konig's ketone analogue 71 (scheme 24). This provides a useful comparison with Konig's carbonyl and carboxyl systems, 35 since inductive effects through electron donation to the carbonyl is not experienced in 59 by comparison to 71 and 72, dramatically varying the electronics between the two systems.

52

The thermal behavior of 59 was investigated by DSC since sample sizes were not as demanding as those required in solution-phase experiments, vital since the synthesis of acetal precursor 61 was costly. For this reason, comparisons in the thermal behavior of the two systems are tricky and are to be regarded as approximate. Additionally, the absence of solution phase studies does not confirm the mechanism of thermal cyclization, but it is assumed 59 reacted through BC.

The DSC curve (figure 16) presents an irreversible exothermic peak with an onset temperature at ::::: 150°C. By comparison, solution phase studies have shown 70% and 90% yields at temperatures of 190 and 220°C for 71 and 72 respectively in the presence of 100-fold 1,4-CHD. Konig has compared BC temperatures of 71 and 72 with that of 1,2-diethynlbenzene (table 5). The latter served as a model enediyne, so as to imply that any differences in BC behavior were

53

attributed to the carbonyl functionality. This led the authors to assume that terminal carbonyl substituted enediynes did not correspond to an increase in thermal reactivity and that it essentially had a detrimental effect on BC.

The onset temperature ofBC of 1,2-diethynylbenzene at a heat rate of5°C/min has been previously established as::::: 147 °C, as determined by DSC. This is very comparable to the determined onset temperature of 59. Although a crude assumption, through the data presented, thermal reactivities of both enediynes are considered to be analogous. With this in mind, it can be assumed that 59 is expected to react similarly to 1,2-diethynylbenzene in solution phase experiments. Although this implies that the carbonyl functionality did not significantly impact BC temperatures, it also challenges Konig's findings that the carbonyl functionality is detrimental to BC kinetics. With enediyne reactivity in entry 1 being so different to those presented in entry 2 and 3 (and with the assumption that 59 is expected to generate similar results to those presented in entry 1), this indicates that underlying inductive effects through associated methyl and ethoxy groups (or related steric factors) are the cause of dramatic changes in BC kinetics, rather than the carbonyl functionality itself. Solution-phase studies of 59 are needed to confirm these suspicions. The thermal reactivity of 59 in the presence of metals was of interest. The strong a-donating ability of the carbonyl makes it a very attractive candidate for the study but it also poses a
8

55

challenge given the reactive nature of aldehydes. To our knowledge, metal-binding BC studies via metal-coordination through a carbonyl ligand have never been studied. To this end, we wanted to observe the influence of metals on the BC barrier through comparable DSC measurements. Dialdehyde 59 was mixed with Zn8r2 in a 1:1 ratio in diethyl ether. The 1H NMR spectrum for this complex demonstrated:::: 0.1 ppm differences in chemical shifts compared to that of uncoordinated 59 (figure 17). Figure 18 shows the DSC curve of 59 upon assumed coordination with Zn 2+. The DSC curve is unusual in that it displays two exothermic dips, with onset temperatures at::::: 105 °C and:::: 121 °C. Ifthe trend presented in figure 16 is followed (i.e BC occurs after endothermic melting) then the second exothermic peak can be regarded as the thermal activation temperature. The additional exothermic peak could be as a result of decomposition of the metal-aldehyde complex. Although the exact mechanism is currently unknown, the change brought about by the metal has led to a:::: 30°C difference in thermal activation temperatures. Descriptions pertaining to the exact orientation of the metal-ligand cannot be addressed until a crystal structure of the coordinated species is obtained. More telling physical manipulations were witnessed when attempted coordination of 59 to Cu 2+ was tried (data not shown). Over time, the 1H NMR spectrum showed the presence of an additional peak at() I 0.4 ppm. In view of the fact that the aldehyde protons for naphthalene dialdehyde coincidentally appear at this same chemical shift, BC was attempted by heating the sample at 150 °C, in the presence of 50-fold excess of 1,4-CHD and with periodic inspection via
1

H NMR spectroscopy. No significant changes in peak integrations led to the conclusion that BC

was not the reason for the sudden appearance of the additional peak. Instead, we propose that Cu 2+ assisted oxidation of the aldehyde, causing the formation of the respective carboxylic acid

56

(where the acidic proton is also expected to at 8::::: 10.4 ppm). The physical manipulation is more pronounced with Cu 2+ because of its strength as an oxidizing agent.

4. CONCLUSION
The experimental work presented here emphasizes the synthetic challenges associated with the synthesis and design of the enediynes. For some time, the electronic and geometric factors associated with the Bergman cyclization has been the center of extensive study, but minor structural variations within or surrounding the enediyne core commonly results in diverse thermal reactivities. We have reported the existence of the first arenediyne crown ether (achievable through a one-pot synthesis) but attempts at increasing yields and other methods of purification are necessary. Difficulties are experienced when a two-step synthesis is attempted, mainly because the route towards a common prearranged intermediate has posed a challenge. Synthetic attempts via intramolecular Sonogashira reactions towards an arenediyne crown ether (whether they be one-

74

pot or step-wise) resulted in diarylated species, suggesting that cyclization is not favorable under the experimental conditions and that tandem substitution is a likely outcome. Various novel arenediynes have been synthesized that could potentially serve as important intermediates and building blocks towards more complicated structures. Among them were diacetal and dialdehyde arenediynes, which were used to synthesize novel hydrazone arenediynes with extended 1t systems. These hydrazones have the potential to be good metalcoordinating ligands, which could promote a decrease in the thermal activation barrier. In relation to this, we have reported the thermal reactivity of the dialdehyde intermediate with coordination to a metal, which promoted a ~ 30 °C temperature decrease in thermal cyclization temperatures by comparison with the non-coordinated species. Coupled with previous carbonylbased experimental data from the literature, our results suggest that the carbonyl functionality is not detrimental to BC kinetics (as previously stated in literature) but that other steric or electronic effects are to be considered as the prime cause for a decrease in thermal reactivity. Experimental data pertaining to additional thermal BC of our diol intermediate implies that BC is not only dependent on the concentration of the quencher, but is also highly dependent on the nature of the quencher. Notable is that when thionyl chloride is used as a quencher, BC occurs at a much lower temperature than with the conventional 1,4-cyclohexadiene, where quenching is achieved at a much lower concentration. These results possibly suggest that the p-benzyne radical exists at a lower temperature and this could potentially support the theory that hydrogen abstraction is a rate-determining step.
