Background
An Overview of Bluetooth

T he Bluetooth technology was developed to provide a wireless interconnect b etween srnall n1obile devices and their peripherals. The system must fulfill the rcquircrrwnts of

low power, low cost, high security and rr10re integration such that its applications can be widely adopted. Bluetooth radios are designed to operate in the unlicensed ISIVI band ,

approxirnately 2.4 '"". 2.5 GHz. There are n1any RF signals coexist in this band. In order to n1inirnize system degradation due to outside interference, the systern en1ploys a frequency hopping spread spectrurn (FHSS) scheme. According to the Bluetooth specification vl.O. the Bluetooth technology has the following feat nres: · 79 frequency hopping channels covering frequency band 2.402 GHz 2.480 GHz , and

rv

1 J\IIHz channel bandwidth spacing.
· Frequency hopping schen1e with 1600 hops/s, or 625 JlS duration in each tirne slot. However, only 220 JlS data processing time allowed in each channel. · Gross symbol rate is 1 Mbits/s, and rnaximum data transfer rate up to 721 kbits/s for one-to-one connection.

· Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) modulation with a constant envelope. · The non1inal link range is 10 centimeters to 10 meters and can be extended to 100 meters, depending on the transmit power. There are three transmission power levels in Bluetooth corresponding to the transmit distance: class3-0 dBm ( 1 m vV), class2-4 dBn1 (2.5 mW) and class1-20 dBm (100 mW).

A. Receiver Specifications
· Sensitivity: The sensitivity for input signal is -70 dBm with 0.1% BER. · Linearity: I I P3 has to be -17 dBrn in order to satisfy SNR and sensitivity. · Gain Con1pression: 1 dB compression point should be -19 dBm. · VCO phase noise: -71 , -101, -111 dBc/Hz at 111Hz. 2 MHz, 3 MHz offset. · Noise Figure: lower than 25 dB.

Noise is one of the most important factors to consider in RF design. Several noise sources are classified.

Corner frequency ( 1/ f frequency) is defin ed as the frequ ency at which the power of the therrnal noise aud that of the fii cker noise are equal.

For a fixed transconductance 9m, the larger the gate arra, the lower the fiiker noise. For Nl\108 devices, K is about 50 tin1es larger than PMOS devices. In some design, Pl\108 is adopted when concerning 1/ f noise. Noise Figure The noise figure of a device quantifies the arnount of the noise that the device contributes to the systern.

D. Linearity
Linearity is one of the most important issues for RF circuits. For low frequency circuits, it is comrnon to quantify the nonlinearity of a circuit by measuring the distortion in the outpnt signal. At high frequencies, it is common to characterize the distortion produced by the circuit in tern1s of the 1 dB compression point and the intermodulation point. Both are needed. The forn1er for harmonic distortion while the latter for intermodulation distortion.

1 dB Compression Point To measure the 1 dB compression point of a circuit, we
apply a sinusoid to its input and evaluate the power of the fundamental of the output voltage. The 1 dB compression point (P1dB) is the point where the gain of the circuit has dropp ed
by 1 dB from its ideal value.

Intercept Point

Apply two closely spaced sinusoids with the same amplitude to a

narrowband circuit, as shown in Fig.1.2. Their harmonics can be filtered out by a bandpass filter. However the third order interrnodulation distortion existing at 2f1

as shown in Fig.1.2, is very close to the frequencies of the desired signals and can not be filtered out. Hence the rneasurernent of these distortions will help evaluate the linearity of the circui ts. The third order intercept point (J P3 ), is comn1only used to quantify interrnodulation distortion, as shown in Fig.l.l. I I P3 is the input referred third order intercept point .

RF Transceiver Architectures

A . Heterody ne System A heterodyne system: dual conversion architecture, is employed to solve the image rejection problen1 [7). In Fig.l.3: two local oscillators (LOs) are used. The first one operates at 1.6 GH:0 and t he second one at 800 11Hz. After the switch, a low noise mnplifier (LNA) first mnplifies the received signals (2.4 GHz). Then the first quadrature mixer down- converts the RF signal to a signal at intern1ediate frequency (800 MHz ). The second mixer converts IF signal down to zero hertz carrier frequency. Through low pass filter (LPF) and dcrnodnlator, the hnscbnnd signal can be acquired. After the first down-conversion stage, the in1age frcqucncy is reduced to 800 1\!IHz compared to t he 2.4 GHz image frequency in direct conversion archi tecture. The in1age rejection is improved. In transn1itter path: the quadrature modulated baseband signals are first up-converted to 800 l\IIHz and then added together. In the second mixer, the result is up-converted frorn 800 l\lH:0 to 2.4 GHz . After two conversions, the RF signal is applied to a power arnplifier (PA) to drive the antenna . The strong noisy signal at the output of the power mnplifier 1nay couple to t he local oscillator (LO) causing the phenomenon known as 10 pulling. This means t hat

the frequency of the local oscillator is pulled away from the desired value if the 10 frequency

is very close Lo the carrier fr equency and t he power of t he noise at the output of PA is big. One of the ways to alleviate the LO pulling is moving t he PA spectrurn sufficiently far frorn the 10 frequency. Since the carrier frequency in dual conversions is formed by n1ixing two lower LO fr equencies, t he LO pulling by the power arnplifier is negligible cornpared to its counterparts direct-conversion. The drawback of heterodyne structure power consumpt ion.

B. Homodyne Systen1

Hornodync systems, direct conversion architect ures, are simpler and suitable for monolithic circuits. Only one mixer is needed in each transrni tter and receiver path. A typical direct conversion transceiver architecture is shown in Fig.l.4 [8]. l\!Iixing is perforrned to down-convert the RF signals to an IF frequency at (near) zero Hertz . The image frequency is t he sarne as the desired signal. A big advantage of direct conversion is th at there arc no irnagc problcrns: and the IF selection filter becomes a pair of low pass iilt.crs aL baseband. T his allows the filt- er to have even greater selectivity with better g8in and phase response. However , DC offse t and 1/ f noise nwy significantly degrade the receiver performance. DC offset is caused by the LO leakage to the antenna, LNA or the input of mixer. Then t he

Low IF (2 l\1Hz) receiver architectures are more attractive in Bluetooth transceivers [9, 10, 11]. Since the image frequency and the wanted frequency will be converted to the sanre IF frequency after rnixing, the mixer can not distinguish the positive frequency and negative frequency. Therefore Mixer is designed to be quadrature structure such that its outputs are two signals with 90 degree phase difference. This topic will be discussed in Chapter 3 in detail.

1.2

Motivation

The rapid development and wide applications of Bluetooth transceivers introduce new design issues and challenges. Due to the scaled down power supply, the power consurnption should be low to last the life of battery. Low cost requires the architectures of Bluetooth transceivers are simpler and highly integrated. Bluetooth transceivers must have high noise rejection in the interfered circumstance. These are the challenges on designing the circuit of Bhwtoot h transceivers by n1ecting all design specifications. This project mainly investigates the design methodologies for Bluetooth tranceiver frontcllds , which includs a low noise arnplifier , a low IF quadrature down-conversion mixer, a 8

cornrnon-gate class E power arnplifier and a quadrature voltage controlled oscillator. However frequency synthesizer) up-conversion rnixer and IF filter are excluded. The main objectives of this project are reduce the power consumption, minimize the noise figure aud increase the gain while designing all the blocks.

1.3

Project Organization

The project is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, a low noise arnplifier is designed. which focuses on the irnpedance rnatches of the input and output port. Chapter 3 investigates the design of low IF (2 MHz) down-conversion rnixer. It employs the current inj ection to reduce the 1/f noise. A quadrature mixer constructed by two symrnetric Gilbert mixers is discussed in this chapter. Its performance is compared with that of Gilbert mixer. A class E power mnplifier is designed in Chapter 4, which adopts the cornrnon-gate structure to increase the isolation between the ports. Chapter 5 illustrates the design of quadrature VCOs, and the design objective in this chapter is reduce the phase noise while meeting the tuning range. The conclusions and future work are presented in Chapter 6.

Cascade LNA

The basic structure of a cascade LNA is depicted in Fig.2.1. M 1 is the input transistor , which rnainly contributes the gain. M 2 acts as the cascade transistor, which provides the isolation between the input and output ports and improves t he stability of the arnplifi cr.

As shown in Fig.2.1, t he input of LNA is connected to the antenna, which is rnodelcd as a 50 0 resistor. When the input irnpedance is rnatched to 50 D, the noise figure will be rninirnized and the power transfer will be maximized. Sometimes these two perforrnance 10

Chapter 3 Double-Balanced Quadrature Mixer
This chapter presents t he design of down-conversion mixers. Section3.1 reviews the architect ures of single-balanced mixer and double-balanced mixer (Gilbert mixer). A doublcl;;-d anced mixer with current boost is designed and simulated in Section3.2. Section3.3 discusses the design of the quadrature mixer and compares its performances to that of the Gilbert rr1ixer. This chapter is summarized in Section3.4.

Gilbet Mixers

}.1ixer acts as a n1ultiplier t hat translates two input signals into a signal with a new frequency. The output of a mixer t hat has two sinusoidal inputs is given by

If

is a RF signal and w2 is the frequency of a local oscillator (10) , t he frequency of

the output of the rnixer contains the sun1 and difference of the frequencies. This principle can be used for up-conversion and down-conversion of RF input signals. The rnixers can be classified to be active rnixers and passive rnixers. Active nuxcrs

supply gain while mixing the frequencies. Passive mixers only employ mixing functions and has no fiiker noise in theory. The rnixers are also classified by their inputs and outputs as single-balanced mixers and double-balanced mixers.

Single-Balanced Mixer

1 \11 is a transconductor that converts the RF voltage into a drain current, it also supplies

the gain to the circuit. M 2 and M 3 are switches that steer the drain current of M 1 to obtain frequency translation. The DC currents through these switches should be zero if they totally cornmute. In practice, the switches rnay concurrently conduct for a short period of tin1e. On the other hand , the gate sizes of switches should be made large to reduce noise. However this will increase the capacitance and consume more power. Inductor L 8 is for source degeneration. It is virtual ground at DC to increase voltage headroorn and the increasing reactance of an inductor with increasing frequency helps to attenuate high frequency harmonic and intermodulation components. R 6 is chosen to be large enough to reduce its noise contribution.

Double-Balanced lVIixer

Two single-balanced rnixers are connected together to produce a double-balanced rnixcr , as shown in Fig.3.2. It is also called Gilbert-type mixer.

Figure 3.2: Double-balanced mixer. The differential RF inputs irnprove the linearity of the rnixer [2]. Due to t he LO selfnlixing, an unwanted DC component is generated in the output of rnixer. The differenti al outputs of the rnixer can suppress the common mode noises. The parallel LC tank source degeneration creates a zero-headroom AC current source. The resonate frequency of the tank should be chosen to provide rejection of comrnon-mode components. This is the widely

Double-Balanced Mixer With Current Boost
Configuration

In Gilbert mixer, the drain current of M 1 directly feeds into the source of the switching

transistors

NI~1

and M 4 . To obtain a large gain and good linearity, the drain current of A11

rnust be large. However 1/ f noise performances of the mixer are primarily detennined by the

21

switching pair devices. Minimizing the 1/f noise leads to the large area switching transistors and low biasing current s [17]. Hence, the currents of the input stage and the switching stage cc-tn be set independently to sinmltaneously optin1ize noise figure, linearity, and gain. New configurE-Ltions were proposed in [18, 19, 20]. As shown in Fig.3.3, an additional current source Iss is connected to the drains of the tranconductors M 1 and M 2 . This technique is called current boost or current bleeding. Due to the injected current, the de current that flows through the switching transistors is reduced.

The Inain contributors are the thermal noise of the resistors and 1/ f noise of the t ransistors.

The total noise figure

If switching of t he four transist ors in mixer core had been ideal, only two t ransistors \vonld have been conducting in every single n1oment and only two transistors would have been generating noise. However , t here are srnall intervals in which the four transistors are all on. The length of this interval depends on the 10 signal, its voltage level and shape. Hence the 10 amplitude (VLo) and con1mon mode voltage should be chosen with care. Since t he layout will slightly change the component parameters: in the DC steady state, the drain current of switching transistors is set to be 0.26 rnA. With an additional inj ected current, the drain current of M 1 is 2 rnA. The boost current draws away about 70% of the total drain current . The common mode voltage of 10 is set to be 0.8 V and VLo is 300 In V . T he power level is 5 dBm and its fr equency range is 2.4 GHzrv 2.48 GHz. The mnplitude 24

Quaraure Mixer
Introduction

\Vhen a down-conversion occurs, the two input signals are mixed with the LO signal to the smne IF frequency. One is the desired RF signal f RF, the other is the frequency lower IF frequency than LO signal, called image frequency, as shown in Fig.3.13.

Figure 3.13: Definition of irnage frequency. Suppose
fiF = !RF -

fLo , if there is another signal

!image =

fLo --

!IF ,

it also mixes

with the LO signal and produces the san1e IF frequency. The wanted and image signals arc 29

all converted and appear at the IF port. The IF filter will not distinguish these two signals.

A cornrnon way to avoid this image problem is the usc of a quadrature down-conversion r11ixer. There are two 10 frequency signals, an in-phase (I) 10 signal and a quadrature (Q) LO signal that are goo apart. The input signals are given by VRF
=

A cos (wRFt),

- w IF )t) ' and VLo ,I

The RF signal rnultiplies the in-phase 10 signal VLo. 1 to produce the desired IF sign<-11 The inw,ge signal is mixed with the quadrature 10 signal VLo ,Q and is depicted in 3.2.

AB cos ((2wLo- w1 p)t +goo)+ AB cos ( -w1 pt- goo), 2 2

Due to down-conversion, the second term is chosen. Therefore two converted signals, t tw positive IF signal w1 p and the negative frequency signal -w1 p , appear at the input of the IF fi lter. If the IF filter is a cornplex bandpass filter , the negative frequency can be detected
8nd rejected.

Figure 3.15: Output of quadrature mixer: IFI+ , IFI-, IFQ+ , IFQ-. Fig.3.15 and Fig.3.16 show the quadrature outputs of quadrature n1ixer. The I and Q differential outputs exhibit the expected phase shift and the arnplitude of IF output IFI and

IFQ are slightly lower than the Gilbert cell, since the current of the switches flowing into thC'
drain of the transconductors is twice that of Gilbert cell. The transconductance 9m increases

nncl the drain voltage of lvf1 decreases such that the overdrive voltage of switches A13 and
Af4 increases. Therefore the currents passing through the switches at DC increase. Fig.3.17

shows the drain current of M 3 and lvf4 of quadrature mixer. \Vhen both of t he switches conduct, the current is 0.8 rnA (0 .26 rnA in Gilbert mixer), and the conducting interval is longer than that of the single mixer. The noise figur e of quadrature mixer is 21 dB, a slightly higher than that of Gilbert n1ixer, as shown in Fig.3.18.

Summary

A do uble-balanced mixer with current inject ion has been invest igated . The amplitude and con1n1on mode voltage of the 10 signal as well as t he biasing voltage of transconducLors, were chosen carefully to n1ake the switches work properly while 1ninin1izing the 1/ f noise. T he additional circuit of inj ected current source may contribute to noise figur e. And thf' input resistors of the t ransconductors are one of t he rnain noise contributors. Due to the drain current of t ransconductors is 2 rnA , t he voltage conversion gain is only 4 dB . Therefore , increasing the drain current of t ransconductor rnay in1prove t he gain and linearity. A quadrature mixer constructed by two double-balanced mixers has been illustrated. And its

33

perforrn ance were simulated and analyzed. The quadrature rnixer yields the 90 degree phase shifts. Th e noise figure and the gain of quadrature rnixer degrade under the sarne parameters of component : :; and the san1e sirnulation conditions as che double-balanced rnixer. To obtain L hc

perform ance in quadrature rnixer the parmneter of transconductor, the comrnon

Chapter 4 Po\Ver Amplifier
Power mnplifier (PA) is an in1portant block in transrnitters. It mnplifies the power of the modulated signal and send it to the antenna. 1\!Ieanwhile, the power arnplifier coutribuics Lhe rnost in terrns of the power consun1ption of the transceiver. The efficiency of power cldivering becomes one of the crucial parameters in design of power arnplifiers. Section4.1 f('Views the classifications of power arnplifier and the calculation of power added efficiency
and drain dhcicncy. A configuration of cornrnon-gate Clas;; E power arnplifier is investigated

in SecLion4.2, L rnatching network and its parameter calcultions are discussed in detail. All sinn1lation results are presented in Section4.3. Section4.4 sun1marizes this chapter.

4.1

Classifications of Power Amplifier

There are four types of power arnplifiers, distinguished primarily by bias conditions [2).

In Class A power arnplifiers, where transistor operates linearly and conducts the whole
duty cycle. In Class B power mnplifiers. the transistor is biased to conduct 50% duty

cycle to reduce power consumption. The transistor in a Class AB power arnplifier turns on during 50%
rv

100% duty cycle, and its performance is between Class A and Class B power

mnplifiers. In a Class C power arnplifi.er, the conducting tirne of the transistor is less than
50% dnty cycle.

Another three types of power arnplifiers, Class D ) E and F, use the transistor as a switch. Power consurnption is ideally zero due to the different conducting duty cycle between the

35

drain volta,ge and drain current, as depicted in Fig.4.1.

Cla~s

D power ainplificr, transfonncrs arc used in the input and output to force

two Lr8nsis tors conducting half cycle respectively [2], and a series RLC network is used at the output of the arnplifier. Cl[tss E power C1mplifiers are the same as Class D except for th e
transfonner~ .

A Class F power arnplifier has a parallel LC tank at the output, whi ch

rcsonc1tcs Ht thr· carrier frequency. Class C, D. E and F arnplifiers are essentially constant envelope arnplifiers [2], They do not norrnally provide an output that is proportional to the input and tend to perforrn best for constant-arnplitude output. Since GFSK is adopted for bluetooth transceivers, which use coust ant envelope modulators, rnore research interests are recently focused on Class E power
~:unplifiers

for Bluetooth applications [26, 27, 28, 29, 30].

As shown in Fig.4.2, .A11 acts as a switch. When the switch turns on, the voltage across the switch should be zero. The voltage across the switch remains low when the switch turns

oH . as shown in Fig.4.l. Hence Class E power arnplificr has no power consumption of the
~\vitch,
si~c

n.nd. theoretically achieves 100%

dficic~ncy.

However its linearity is poor and the the

of transistor is large .

.Inductor Lcl acts as a finite de-feed inductance that resonates out the drain parasitic capacitance of switch, represented by C0 . Serial LC tank L 1 and C1 constructs a band pass filter resou2tting at the carrier frequency and attenuates other harrnonic signals. The follo\ving tenns are often used to evaluate the performances of power arnplifiers.

clDrn. In [ 28~ 29], cornrnon-gatc class E power arnplificm \vcrc~ proposed. The cornmon gaLe transistor A12 is connected in cascode with the com1non-source transist or A11 , as shown in Fig.4.l. T'he cascode structure avoids the loading effect to the input stage and increases Lhe

isolntion between the input and output of the power a.rnplifier. The capacitance of j'vf1 is resonated out by the inductor
L 9 . Rapt

is the optirnurn load ., at which the power arnpJifier

presents t he desired output power with the highest efficiency.

Due to the L n1atching network, the output voltage and output power are increased , as shown in Fig.4 .6. However it does not rnean that the power added efficiency(PAE) and drain cfficiency(DE) nmst be high , since the input DC power changes along with the transformed resistance. Hence there are the trade-offs between the down scaled resistor and the power efficiency.

Summary

A clnss 1 cnrnmon-gaJc Class E power arnplificr has hccn designed. Through connecting

a L n1atching network at the output of PA, the optin1um load resistance was reduced and the output po\ver was increased. The common-gate transistor increases the isolation between ports. The power added efficiency PAE and drain efficiency DE were obtained over 40o/cJ.
The drmvhacks of Class E power arnplifier are the large size of the transistors a nd its poor

Chapter 5 Quadrature VCOs
Design of quadrature VCOs is presented in this chapter. Section5 .1 introduces the frequency synthesizer. In Section5.2, a cornplementary cross-coupled QVCO is inves tigated ,
Ptnd tlw A10S vara.ct.ors and t he definition of phase noise are illustrated. Steady-state be-

havior and phase noise of QVCOs are simulated in Section5.3 . This chapter is surnma.rized in Section5.4.

A fixed frequen cy oscillator can not rncct this specification. The IYtost \viddy nscd

frequency synthesizers (FS), which can generate one or n1ore frequencies from one or several frequency references, are based on the principle of phase-locked loops (PLLs), as shown in Fig.5.1.

When the feedback frequency is lower than the reference, PD outputs an UP signal, otherwise, a. DOWN signal is c 1 .sscrt.ed.

Quadrature VCOs
Architectures of Quadrature VCOs

As cliso·ssed in chapter 3, the down-conversion mixer employs the quadrature n.rchitccLnre. Therefore, a VCO is required to output two local oscillator signals, in-phase and

quadrature. This section deals wjth the design of quadrature VCOs.

and A14 ,

it is possible to compensate the loss of the LC tank with less current consu1nption. However

it is not suitable to use in low po\ver circuits since the P l\!IOS cross-coupled pair reduces the voltage hea,droom. Quadrature VCOs consist of two syrnrnetric differential cross-coupled VCOs . To generate quadrature phases, the switches are added to steer t he currents, as shown in Fig5.4 [37). The series coupled QVCOs (S-QVCO) were used in [37, 38, 39]. The phase error of SQVCO is v.reakly dependent of the coupling strength. This characteristics allow to achieve a good phase error and phase noise at the same t ime. The QVCO designed in this project is shown in Fig5.5. The QVCO has the follow ing ad vantages:

MOS Varactors

In VCO design, 110S varactors are often used. J\108 varactors operate in four regions , bas<'d on the biasing condition: accurnulation, depletion, weak inversion , and strong inversion. Accun1ulat ion and strong inversion are two regions where most varactors are designed to operate in.

48

LC oscillators vvith accurnulation-rnode varactors exhibit lower power consun1pLion and lower phase noise at large offset frequencies frorn the carrier, cmnpared to those based on strong inversion varactors [43]. Therefore accumulation-mode (A-rnode) PIV£08 varactors are nsed in QVCO: as shown in Fig.5.6.

Phase Noise

An jdeal oscillator can be described as a pure sinusoidal wave

1 /(t) = Vo sin(wot) .

For prctc1,jcal oscillators, the spectrum has power distributed around the center frequency as shown in Fig.5. 7 (44] . In addition , the power is also distributed at the harmonics of the oscilhttion

Summary

A cornplernentary series cross-coupled QVCOs has been designed. The elin1ination of the current source tail allows the utilization of complementary configuration in low povvcr 52

systcrn. Due to the adoption of PNIOS transistors in switching pairs, cornplernentary crosscoupled pairs and MOS varactors, the low phase noises were achieved. The frequency tuning range of the QVCOs covers the frequency band of frequency hopping channels in Bluetoot h transceivers. The arnplitude of the oscillating signal reaches to 1.0 V ) which satisfies the rcqnirernent of down-conversion mixer.

Chapter 6 Conclusions and Future Work
6.1 Conclusions

This proj ect dealt with the design of RF transceiver front-ends for Bluetooth applications , including L:\A; rnixer, power an1plifier and quadrature VCO. A cascode LNA with relatively perfect impedance match of input and output port has beeu presented. The noise figure of the circuit is ahnost the same as the minimurn noise fignrc. The cascodc transistor irnprovcd the port isolation. The linearity of the LN A is good when the input power is as low as -70 dBm. An active double-balanced down-conversion mixer has been designed, since double balance can snppress the cmnmon mode noise at input and output port.. To reduce the ftiker noise of switching transistors, a current source constructed by a current mirror was injected
1o

the drain nodes of transconductors. The simulation results showed that 70% the drain

cnrrcnt of transccnductor is drew away by current bleeding. The total noise figure and the po\ver consurnpb on are decreased respectively. A 2 MHz differential IF signal was obtained
c-1L

IF port. A quadrature mixer based on two symmetric double-balanced mixers has been
Gilbt~r t

invcsbgated. Tbe voltage gain and noise figure are slightly degraded cornpared to the rnixrr with the smne con1ponent parameters. Cou1n1on-gate Class E power arnplifier has been designed.

The scheme utilized a L

n1atching network to reduce the optimum output load such that the output power was increased with the sarne power supply. This is suitable for the low power system . However
54

Lhctt doesn:t rnean that the lower the optimun1 output load, the better the performance of the power arnphfier. since the PAE and DE depend on not. only the output power, but Lhe input power at DC. The con1prorr1ise between output power, PAE and DE has been explored. Finally PJ\!lOS cornplementary series coupUng QVCO has bcer1 presented. Con1plen1cnn y structure increases the negat ive resistance with fewer current consumption a.nd enhm1ccs LLhc osci1lation of LC tank. The A-mode PMOS varactors were chosen in LC tank, since they exhibit low power consurnption and high linearity at large off'set frequency. The designC'd and sirnulated QVCO achieved low phase noise at 600 kHz and 1 l\llHz offset frequency ccnnparable to the configurations in the referenced literatures.

Ftiture Work

ln t his project : get through the design process of RF transceiver. The rnain parts of the frout -ends \Vere finished. However there are stillrnore work to do in the future. · The input rnatching inductor in LNA is big. 40 nH. It is difficult to fa,l)I'icate it with the other designed blocks on one chip. A better input matching network needs to he explored . · This project excludes the up-conversion mixer. The frequency synthesizer is not designed except for the QVCO. If these t\vo blocks are added to the project iuthe RF transceiver front-ends would keep integrity. · Armlyzing the L1T A, mixer and QVCO as a systern vv·ould be more valuable, since t lte loading efFects between ports will be considered. although it is t irne consurning.
