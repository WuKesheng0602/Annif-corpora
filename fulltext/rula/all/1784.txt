Activation of Insulin Receptor Signaling Pathway using Ligand Microbeads in Mammalian Cells and Isolation of Receptor-Bead complex
Sana Ahmed M.Sc. in Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2012

ABSTRACT
The study of cell surface receptors and their associated signaling pathways on the plasma membrane are vital in understanding cellular responses. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that is activated in response to insulin microbeads presented to three mammalian cell lines: CHO, NIH-3T3 and COS-7. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, a major insulin receptor signaling pathway, phosphorylates the 3-position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate, resulting in phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) that acts by recruiting specific pleckstrin homology (PH) domain containing proteins to cell membranes. Akt (protein kinase B) containing PH domain gets activated, binds to PIP3 and localizes to the site of receptor activation. The PH domain of Akt was fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) to create a biosensor for phosphatidylinositol. Confocal microscopy confirmed Akt-PH recruitment to the cell membrane. Immunofluorescence staining (IF) and western blots confirmed insulin receptor and phosphotyrosine activity in cells. The activated insulin receptor complex was captured and isolated by insulin coated microbeads on the surface of cells.

INTRODUCTION
Insulin Insulin is an important hormone that is anabolic in nature and has extensive effects on growth and metabolism. It is vital for the proper development of tissues including growth and maintenance of glucose homeostasis in the body (VirkamÃ¤ki et al., 1999). Insulin is secreted by the  cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans in response to increased levels of nutrients, such as glucose, in the blood (Pessin & Saltiel, 2000). It has the ability to stimulate glucose uptake in the liver, muscle, and fat tissue cells, which is then stored as glycogen and thereby used as their source of energy (Sheikh-Ali & Chehade, 2009; Cushman & Wardzala, 1980; Suzuki & Kono, 1980). Insulin also plays an important role in lipid metabolism as it increases lipid synthesis in liver and fat cells and attenuates the release of fatty acids from triglycerides in fat and muscle (Pessin & Saltiel, 2000). Structure Insulin (Figure 1) is a 5.8 kDa molecule that consists of two short peptide chains linked by two disulfide bridges (Sanger, 1959). The A chain is 21 amino acids in length that contains an internal disulfide bridge and the B chain is 30 residues long (Humbel et al., 1972; De Meyts, 2004).

History Insulin was first discovered by Banting, F. G. and Best, C. H. in 1922 (Litwack, 2009; Steiner et al., 1985) and one of the first proteins to be crystallized in pure form in 1926 (Murnaghan, 1967). The crystalline form allowed researchers to study its structure with a technique known as X-ray crystallography that helped in approximating its three-dimensional shape (Smith et al., 1984; Baker et al., 1988; Smith & Dodson, 1992; Smith & Ciszak, 1994; Whittingham et al., 1995). Insulin was the first protein fully sequenced using Edman sequencing (Sanger, 1959). It has become a significant model protein for structural studies mainly because of its small size, ease of availability and wide medical importance (Steiner et al., 1985).

Diseases Insulin is used medically to treat some forms of diabetes mellitus (Galloway & Bressler, 1978). Type 1-diabetes, also known as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), occurs due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells causing the loss of insulin production. Type-1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and requires lifelong insulin treatment (Torpy & Golub, 2011). Type-2 diabetes, also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), is a common type of diabetes (Mbanya & Ramiaya, 2006) that occurs due to insulin resistance, abnormal insulin secretion and defect in signal transduction (Pessin & Saltiel, 2000). Patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus are insulin resistant and suffer from insulin deficiency. Insulin may be required by Type-2 diabetic patients in order to control and improve blood glucose levels in the body (Torpy & Golub, 2011).

Insulin Receptor The insulin receptor belongs to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Ullrich et al., 1985; Yarden & Ullrich, 1988). Studies have shown that the receptor tyrosine kinase plays a critical role in transmission of insulin signal (Chou et al., 1987; Ebina et al., 1987). Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are also major targets for anticancer therapy (De Meyts et al., 2007). Insulin receptor is thus a transmembrane protein with tyrosine kinase activity. Tyrosine kinase phosphorylates a tyrosine residue in a protein. The insulin receptor is found to be present in almost all vertebrate tissues. There may be as few as 40 receptors on circulating erythrocytes to more than 200,000 receptors on adipocytes and hepatocytes (White & Kahn, 1994). Insulin

receptors are extremely important and fundamental players in the regulation of cell differentiation, growth, and metabolism. They have a number of distinctive biochemical and physiological properties that differentiates them from other members of this large well-studied receptor family. The major physiological role of the receptor is the regulation of metabolism. On the other hand, all other receptor tyrosine kinases are mostly engaged in regulating cell growth and differentiation (Lee & Pilch, 1994). Insulin receptor has two basic functions. It recognizes the hormone among the various substances present in the blood and binds to it with high affinity and a high degree of specificity. Secondly, it creates a signal that is sent across the membrane which effects intracellular metabolism and mediates the action of the hormone (Kahn & White, 1988). Structure Insulin receptor (Figure 2) is a hetero- tetramer of two  and two  subunits (Pessin & Saltiel, 2000). The  subunit is extracellular and contains the major insulin binding region of the receptor (Ullrich et al., 1985; Ebina et al., 1985). The  subunit is a transmembrane protein that contains a tyrosine specific protein kinase (Kasuga et al., 1982) and is autophosphorylated (Ullrich et al., 1985; Ebina et al., 1985; Hedo & Simpson, 1984).

The modular structure of the insulin receptor is encoded by a gene containing 22 exons and 21 introns (Seino et al., 1990). The exon 11 is alternatively spliced, resulting in two isoforms (A and B) (De Meyts et al., 1994). Both isoforms have slightly different binding affinities toward insulin (McClain, 1991; Yamaguchi et al., 1991; Gu & Meyts, 1991). The synthesis of these receptors begins as preproreceptors that have a single chain which is later processed, glycosylated, folded and dimerised to produce the mature  2  2 receptor (De Meyts, 2004; De Meyts & Whittaker, 2002). As shown in Figure 3, the N-terminal half of the  subunit comprises of two homologous large globular domains (L1 and L2), that include a cysteine-rich (CR) region in between (Bajaj et al., 1987). Studies about the crystal structure of this domain helped immensely in confirming the predicted boundaries of the protein modules (De Meyts et al., 2007). The C-terminal half of the receptors consists of three fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains (Fn 1 , Fn 2 and Fn 0 ) (Marino-Buslje et al., 1998; Mulhern et al., 1998; Ward, 1999). The second FnIII domain forms the C-terminal part of the  subunit and the N-terminal part of the  subunit. It contains a large insert domain (Ins) of about 120-130 residues containing the site of cleavage between  and  subunits. The intracellular portion of the  subunit contains a transmembrane domain (TM) and a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain (TK) flanked by two regulatory regions, a juxtamembrane (JM) region involved in docking insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and a C-terminal tail (CT) containing two phosphotyrosine binding sites (De Meyts & Whittaker, 2002; De Meyts et al., 2007).

Insulin Receptor Signaling Events and Phosphotyrosine Activity Receptor activation upon insulin binding gives rise to multiple signaling cascades to elicit its metabolic actions (Thong et al., 2007). Binding of the insulin ligand to the extracellular  subunit brings about a conformational change that promotes autophosphorylation, and activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain of the  subunit (Kasuga et al., 1982; Van Obberghen & Kowalski, 1982; Lee et al., 1993). The activated receptor recruits and regulates target proteins, thereby transmitting the signal downstream (White & Kahn, 1994). Phosphorylation of proteins is one of the most common mechanisms for regulating protein function (Roach, 1990) that is known to play a significant role in controlling a variety of biological functions in many organisms (Hubbard et al., 1993; Manning et al., 2002; Koch et al., 1991). Phosphorylation is simply the addition of a phosphate group to a protein. Within a protein, phosphorylation can occur on several amino acids. Phosphorylation on serine is the most common (Whiteside and Israel, 1997), followed by threonine (Moeslein et al., 1999). Phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues play critical roles in the regulation of many cellular processes (Diella et al., 2004). Tyrosine phosphorylation forms a major part of signal transduction and enzymatic activity regulation (Moeslein et al., 1999). Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins occurs after the activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase as it unleashes the intracellular transmission of insulin signals (Thirone et al., 2006; Ushiro & Cohen, 1980). The receptor is subjected to a series of intramolecular trans-phosphorylation mechanisms (Pessin & Saltiel, 2000). It undergoes autophosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues (VirkamÃ¤ki et al., 1999). Different tyrosine residues perform distinctive functions. Phosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosines directs the
7

actions of insulin hormone. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues present in the juxtamembrane domain help in insulin receptor substrate binding. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of the kinase catalytic domain stimulates the catalytic activity of the  subunit of the receptor (Pessin & Saltiel, 2000). Phosphorylation activity and the resultant proteinÂ­protein or protein-lipid interactions act as indispensable tools to transmit and compartmentalize the insulin signal from the surface receptor to the final cellular effect (VirkamÃ¤ki et al., 1999), such as stimulation of glucose transport, protein and glycogen synthesis, inhibition of lipolysis, regulation of gene transcription and translation, and cell growth and proliferation (Brazil et al., 2002; Cantley 2002; Myers et al., 1994; Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002).

Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) Phosphoinositide 3-kinases, also called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (or PI3Ks) are a family of lipid kinases that act as signal transducer enzymes and play a crucial role in the regulation of many cellular processes (Stein, 2001). They are activated by insulin and are capable of phosphorylating the 3-position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring (Figure 4) of phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) (Hirsch et al., 2009).

Figure 5: PI3K activity: PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate or PIP2 to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate or PIP3 (Isabelle et al., 2004).

PI 3-kinase is a heterodimeric enzyme comprising of a regulatory subunit (p85) responsible for binding to insulin receptor substrates and a catalytic subunit (p110) that phosphorylates the phosphatidylinositols present in cell membranes (VirkamÃ¤ki et al., 1999). The p85 regulatory subunit stimulates the intrinsic PI 3-kinase activity of the enzyme (Backer et al., 1992, Carpenter et al., 1993; Baltensperger et al., 1994). It contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and one
9

Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (Escobedo et al., 1991; Otsu et al., 1991; Skolnik et al., 1991). The SH2 domains are required for the association of the kinase with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, such as the insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 (Sun et al., 1991), whereas, SH3 mediates interactions with proline-rich regions (Anderson et al., 1990; Moran et al., 1990; Ren et al., 1993). PI3K was the first SH2 protein found to associate with IRS-1. Both SH2 domains associate specifically with phosphorylated IRS-1 (White & Kahn, 1994). The insulin receptor substrate 1 is phosphorylated in response to insulin on several tyrosine residues that serve as binding sites for proteins containing the SH2 domain (Myers et al., 1994). As shown in Figure 5, PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate or PtdIns(4, 5)P 2 or PIP2 to form the lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate or PtdIns(3, 4, 5)P 3 or PIP3 (Yuan & Cantley, 2008). PtdIns(3, 4, 5)P 3 acts as a second messenger in the regulation of cellular processes such as metabolism, proliferation, and survival through interactions with proteins that contain Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (Cantrell, 2001). PH domains consist of well-characterized modules of approximately 120 amino acids and have a high affinity binding with phosphoinositides that are phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol (Lemmon, 2007). They are found in various signaling proteins that play an important role in cytoskeletal remodeling, cellular signaling and intracellular trafficking (Gibson et al., 1994) by mediating protein-lipid (Frech et al., 1997) and protein-protein interactions (Datta et al., 1995).

Akt (PKB) Some of the best studied targets for PIP3 belong to the AGC (cAMP-dependent, cGMPdependent and protein kinase C) family of protein kinases (Alessi & Downes, 1998; Williams et
10

al., 2000). These include PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) and PKB (protein kinase B) or Akt that contain a PH domain. Akt is the cellular homologue of the viral oncoprotein v-Akt which is a 60 kDa serine/threonine kinase (Figure 6) (Bellacosa et al., 1991; Coffer & Woodgett, 1991; Jones et al., 1991; Staal et al., 1977). It is widely expressed in tissues, including the liver (Chan et al., 1999; Song et al., 2005) and important in cellular signaling.

Figure 6: Akt domain structure.

PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway Upon insulin stimulation at the cell surface, PIP3 binds to the PH domain of PDK-1 and Akt, promoting their translocation to the membrane (McManus et al., 2004; Alessi et al., 1997; Brazil et al., 2002; Cantley, 2002; Stokoe et al., 1997; Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002). Thus, association with PIP3 at the membrane recruits and localizes these proteins (Akt and PDK1) to the cell surface and facilitates phosphorylation and activation of Akt by PDK1 (Lawlor & Alessi, 2001; Cohen et al., 1997; Coffer & Woodgett, 1998; Mora et al., 2004; Engelman et al., 2006). PDK1 acts as a master kinase which is crucial for the activation of Akt/PKB (Mora et al., 2004; Storz & Toker, 2002; Vanhaesebroeck & Alessi, 2000; Wick & Liu, 2001). The PI3K/Akt upstream signaling (Figure 7) is one of the major insulin signaling cascades. PI3K/Akt downstream

11

signaling is the activation of Akt leading to translocation of GLUT4 molecule, activation of glycogen synthase and other proteins required for metabolic effects of insulin (Jensen & De Meyts, 2009). The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has been known to perform wide range of cellular activities such as cellular proliferation and survival (Rong et al., 2001).

Figure 7: Upstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as adapted from Viglietto et al., 2011.

PI 3-kinase activity can be inhibited by the drugs wortmannin and LY294002 (Stein, 2001; O'Gorman et al., 2000; Kim & Denkers, 2006; Vanhaesebroeck et al., 1997). PI 3-kinase suppression affects various cellular events of insulin such as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, translocation of GLUT4 vesicle to the plasma membrane, activation of fatty acid synthesis, glycogen synthase, Akt phosphorylation and stimulation of protein and DNA synthesis (Alessi & Downes, 1998).

Orthovanadate Orthovanadate is a known insulinomimetic agent, which acts on glucose metabolism (Dubyak & Kleinzeller, 1980; Shechter & Karlish, 1980), glycogen synthase activity (Tamura et al., 1984) and on cell growth and transformation (Smith, 1983; Wice et al., 1987; Klarlund, 1985). Orthovanadate is an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase activities (Heffetz et al., 1990) and therefore, acts as a valuable tool in the investigation of the role of phosphorylation in kinase activities (Scimeca et al., 1992). Studies have shown that vanadate and hydrogen peroxide are well known insulin-mimicking agents (Czech et al., 1974; Dubyak & Kleinzeller, 1980; May & de Haen, 1979; Schechter & Karlish, 1980). Vanadate has also been shown to trigger the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity (Tamura et al., 1984). Pervanadate is a peroxidized form of vanadate which is formed by mixing vanadate with hydrogen peroxide and catalase (Kadota et al., 1987). Pervanadate mimics insulin biological effects (Fantus et al., 1989).

In View of Modular Domains Many cellular proteins are composed of domains that have modular structures which helps them to retain their structure and biochemical properties so that they can function and exist on their own. These domains possess catalytic functions, such as protein kinase activity or lipid kinase activity, or can help in molecular interactions with other proteins (Pawson, 1995). The Nand C-termini of these interaction domains are closely spaced which allows them to be integrated into a host protein while preserving their ligand binding properties (Pawson et al., 2002). Known as the `Plug and Play', this feature helps these proteins to be incorporated into pre-existing proteins and acquire new biological functions (Pawson et al., 2002). They play a
13

critical role in signal transduction in the activation of signaling pathways, recruitment of target proteins to activate receptors and formation of signaling complexes (Pawson & Scott, 1997; Kuriyan & Cowburn, 1997). Protein interaction domains can determine the kinetics and dynamic state of the cell, and mediate signaling pathways by controlling cellular activities like gene expression, protein synthesis, metabolism and cytoskeletal architecture (Pawson, 2003; Pawson & Nash, 2003). In the study of the insulin receptor pathway, the role of interaction domains is a very important one. Interaction domains can regulate the localization of signaling proteins with the help of modules such as PH domains to bind phosphoinositides such as PIP3. The activation of PI 3kinase increases the concentration of PIP3 in the plasma membrane, which consequently recruits the PKB/Akt, and its activating kinase PDK1, both of which have PH domains that selectively bind PIP3. Once activated at the membrane, PKB is a key regulator of cell growth, survival and metabolism. Interaction domains also regulate the effects of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Pawson, 2003).

Isolation of the Receptor Complex on Ligand Coated Beads Insulin receptor complex is activated and captured by insulin coated microbeads on surface of live cells. After the cells are disrupted, the receptor complexes are isolated by washing and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Proteins associated with the receptor complex can be subjected to liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for identification. This novel procedure called Ligand Affinity Chromatography (LAC) confirms recruitment and monitors receptor function. Thus, the recruitment of protein subunits and the penetration and efficacy of
14

drugs against receptor pathways may be quantified in live cells. LAC can help to detect receptor isoforms and proteins close to specific receptors that are important targets for the treatment of diseases. Because the ligand of the insulin receptor (insulin) is a treatment for some diseases like diabetes, the use of insulin-coated microbeads to capture a receptor complex further conceptually establishes that an antibody, protein ligand, or therapeutic molecule may be used to capture a receptor complex from the cell surface (Jankowski et al., 2008).

RATIONALE
Uniform polystyrene microspheres have been used recently in biological applications like drug delivery, bioimaging and biosensing (Kiani et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2008; Elsom et al., 2008). In this research study, the use of microbeads was helpful to display insulin to three different mammalian cells. Upon ligand-receptor binding, intracellular proteinÂ­protein interactions transmitted the signal from the activated receptor to the intracellular effects. Members of the receptor complex recruit upon ligand binding. Studies were concentrated on proteins that localized or translocate to the plasma membrane of the cell in response to insulin. It was easy to visualize the effects using the confocal microscope to target the beads on the cells and confirm recruitment of Akt protein to the activated receptor complex on the cell membrane. The main objective of this study was to isolate the insulin receptor complex from live cells by coating microbeads with insulin, binding to the cells, lysing and extracting the resultant protein bound microbeads. The isolated receptor-bead complex can be further introduced to mass spectrometry analysis in order to identify novel proteins in the insulin receptor signaling pathway that could help in the investigation of diseases.

Experimental Procedures

Preparation of competent E. coli (DH5) cells E. coli DH5 stock was inoculated in LB broth and incubated at 37 C  overnight with shaking at 200 rpm. A streak plate was made from the overnight culture onto LB media plate and incubated overnight. Fresh colony was picked and inoculated in 5 ml LB media and grown for 2 hours at 37 C  with shaking at 200 rpm. Again 1 ml of culture was inoculated in 100 ml prewarmed media and grown at 37 C  for 2-3 hours until an optical density of 0.45 was reached at 600 nm. The culture was chilled on ice, centrifuged at 3500 rpm at 4 C  for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and pellet was re-suspended in 2/5th original volume of Tfb 1 buffer (30 mM potassium acetate, 100 mM RbCl2, 10 mM CaCl2.2H20, 50 mM MnCl2.4H20, 15% glycerol, pH 5.8) and chilled on ice for 5 minutes followed by centrifugation at 3500 rpm at 4 C  for 5 minutes. The pellet was again re-suspended in 1/25th original volume of Tfb 2 buffer (10 mM MOPS, 75 mM CaCl2.2H20, 10 mM RbCl2, 15% glycerol, pH 6.5) and chilled on ice for 15 minutes. Competent cells were stored at -80 C  in 200 Âµl aliquots.

Bacterial transformation with Akt-PH-GFP plasmid Competent DH5 cells were transformed with Akt-PH-GFP. 100 Âµl of competent DH5 cells were thawed and incubated with 1 mg/ml DNA on ice for 30 minutes. The cells were heat shocked at 42 C for 90 seconds and chilled for 1-2 minutes on ice. To the cell suspension, 1 ml of LB was added and cells were incubated at 37 C  for 1 hour with shaking at 200 rpm. The cell
18

suspension was plated on LB agar plate alone, LB containing 50 Âµg/ml kanamycin and LB containing 100 Âµg/ml ampicillin and left overnight to grow at 37 C  . Colonies grown on plates showing kanamycin resistance (LB containing kanamycin) were looped off and inoculated in 2.5 ml LB containing kanamycin (50 Âµg/ml) and incubated at 37 C  while shaking at 200 rpm for 3 hours. 1 ml of the culture was grown in 100 ml LB with same antibiotic conditions overnight. The DNA plasmid was then extracted and purified using the QIAfilter Plasmid Maxi Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, California). The DNA concentration in TE buffer was determined at a wavelength of 260 nm. The DNA sample was run on an agarose gel (1%) alongside GeneRuler 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder (75-20,000 bp) to analyze DNA yield and quality.

Preparation of insulin coated beads: Microbead adsorption 10 mg of insulin (SAFC Biosciences, Cat. # 91077C) were dissolved in 50 ml of water, with pH adjusted to 2-3 using 0.1 N HCl (according to insulin manufacturer's instructions). The solution was subjected to centrifugal force, vacuum and heat to help speed evaporation using a centrivap. Purified insulin (100 Âµg) was dissolved in 100 Âµl of 1XPBS. 2 Âµm polystyrene beads from a 10% (v/v) suspension stock (Bang's Laboratories, Fishers, IN, USA) were diluted to 1% solids with 1XPBS. 10 Âµl of the microbead suspension was added to the dissolved insulin and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with constant rotation (Figure 8). The beads were washed 3 times each with 100 Âµl 1XPBS to remove any unbound insulin by pelleting beads in a microcentrifuge at 8000 rpm for 2 minutes. The washed and coated beads were resuspended in 100 Âµl of 1XPBS.

SDS PAGE analysis of insulin coated beads Insulin coated beads were prepared as mentioned above. Samples were loaded on a tris-tricine based 15% separating gel, 4% stacking gel and run for 30 minutes at 30 V and at 125 V for 60 minutes or until the tracking dye has just run off. Marker used was an ultra-low range molecular weight marker (M. W. 1,060-26,600) from Sigma Aldrich (Cat. # M3546). The gel was silver stained.

Cell culture CHO, COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 75-cm2 flasks to confluency.
20

Cell lysate preparation and Western blot for detection of insulin receptor (IR) Cells were grown to confluency, washed 3 times with PBS and treated with DFP on ice. They were lysed in boiling 2XSDS sample buffer and scraped. SDS PAGE analysis was done with 10% separating gel and 4% stacking gel alongside a molecular weight marker. Proteins from the gel were transferred to Immobilon-P Transfer (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) which was first soaked in 100% methanol for activation. The membrane was stained with Coomassie stain without acetic acid, destained with 50% methanol, dried and marked with a pencil to indicate the location of the marker. The membrane was then soaked in 100% methanol and blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST (PBS+ 0.1% Tween) for 1 hour. The membrane was washed 1 time with PBST and incubated with insulin receptor beta (C-19) primary antibody at 1:1000 dilution for 1 hour and again washed 3 times with PBST. It was then incubated with goat antirabbit IgG HRP secondary antibody at 1:10000 dilution for 45 minutes. The membrane was washed with PBST and developed using ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) developing solution (Haan & Behrmann, 2007).

Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot confirmation of phosphotyrosine (YP) activity Cells were grown to confluency, serum starved overnight and incubated with insulin coated beads for 5, 10 and 15 minutes. They were washed 3 times with PBS and fixed with 10% TCA on ice for 15 minutes. Cells were lysed using lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM PMSF; 1 mM Na3VO4; 1 mM NaF) and scraped. Cell lysates were mixed with 2XSDS sample buffer and boiled prior to performing SDS PAGE on a 9% resolving, 4% stacking gel, followed by
21

western blot, as described before, using 5% BSA in PBST (PBS+ 0.1% Tween) as blocking solution, anti-phosphotyrosine primary antibody (4G10) at 1:1000 and goat anti-mouse IgG HRP secondary antibody at 1:10000 dilution.

Cell transfection and confocal microscopy CHO, COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells were plated on glass cover slips to approximately 20% confluence and left to grow for 48 hours before removing all of the old medium and replacing it with fresh 10% FBS in DMEM. Plasmid encoding Akt-PH-GFP was transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Diagnostics, USA). After 24Â­48 hours, cells were incubated with insulin coated beads for 15 minutes and then used to image the recruitment of Akt-PH-GFP at the site of receptor activation by the ligand-coated microbeads at the plasma membrane on the cell surface. The cells were then imaged at 37 C  in DMEM buffered with 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM sucrose and 1 mM each of CaCl2 and MgCl2 buffered to pH 7.4 with 20 mM Hepes. Images of cells binding ligand-coated beads were recorded on a 510 meta laser confocal microscope with Argon 488nm lasers (Carl Zeiss Microscopes, Jenna, Germany). Magnification: 100x oil immersion objective.

Immunofluorescent staining for Phosphotyrosine activity, Insulin Receptor and Insulin CHO, COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells were scraped and grown on 2.5 cm glass cover slips for 24-48 hours until 50-60% confluency. The cells were serum starved (overnight) and incubated with insulin coated beads for 15 minutes. Then they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30
22

minutes, washed, and quenched with 5% glycine in PBS before blocking with 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour. Cells were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine primary antibody (4G10) used at 1:25 dilution for 1 hour, then washed in PBS. Cells were incubated with Cy3 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody used at 1:10,000 dilution for 30 minutes in dark. Experiment was repeated for anti-insulin receptor (1:100) and anti-insulin antibody (1:100) with Cy3 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000) as the secondary antibody. Blocking solution used was 3% milk in PBST (PBS+ 0.1% Triton). The cells were washed three times with PBS in dark and mounted with a Dako fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Denmark). Images of cells binding insulin-coated beads were recorded on a 510 meta laser confocal microscope with Ar 488-nm and He/Ne 543-nm lasers (Carl Zeiss Microscopes, Jenna, Germany).

Isolation of Insulin receptor complex on the beads Cells were grown to 60-75% confluency in 75 cm2 flasks and gently washed 3 times with ice cold 1XPBS. 200 Âµl of insulin coated beads was added to each flask in experimental medium (10 mM HEPES, 135 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM sucrose, pH 7.4) on ice for 15 minutes before washing away the free beads with ice cold PBS. Cells were warmed at 37 C  for 15 minutes and the experiment was quenched with ice-cold PBS. Cells were treated with DFP, fixed with 10% TCA for 15 minutes on ice and washed 3 times with PBS. Homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, protease inhibitor cocktail, 5 mM pervanadate, AEBSF, PMSF, DNAse and RNAse) was added and cells were scraped. Cells were disrupted in a pre-cooled French

23

press (FA-078A, Thermo Electron, Waltham MA, USA) at a pressure of 400 psi, allowing cell suspension to equilibrate for 10 seconds. Collected sample was placed on ice and efficiency of disruption was confirmed using light microscope. The beads with attached receptor complex were isolated through a sucrose gradient in a 1 ml sample volume using a high speed ultra centrifuge (Beckman, USA). The final pellet containing the receptor bound to the bead was dissolved in 2XSDS sample buffer and boiled prior to performing the SDS-PAGE and western blot for insulin receptor and phosphotyrosine activity detection.

RESULTS
Cell transformation Competent E. coli (DH5) cells were prepared and transformed with Akt-PH-GFP. Bacterial colonies that grew in LB plates containing kanamycin were resistant to the antibiotic since these cells had incorporated the Akt-PH-GFP (Figure 9). The plasmid for Akt-PH-GFP construct (pEGFPC1) confers kanamycin resistance to the bacterial cells.

DNA agarose gel analysis The plasmid DNA was extracted and purified using maxi prep followed by agarose gel analysis on a 1% gel. As shown in Figure 10, two bands were obtained in lanes 1 (cleared lysate containing supercoiled, open circular plasmid DNA and degraded RNA) and 4 (pure plasmid

25

DNA). The bands were observed at about 5000 bp. The pEGFP-C1 plasmid size was 4700 bp and insert size of Akt-PH was 457 bp. See Appendix A and B.

SDS-PAGE analysis of insulin coated beads SDS-PAGE analysis was done to confirm the binding of insulin on the beads. High percentage (15%) Tris-tricine gel was used for detection of insulin which is a low molecular weight protein (5.8 kDa). Coomassie staining of the gel was done but there were no visible bands. Silver

26

staining produced the expected bands, thereby confirming binding of insulin on beads (Figure 11). Lane 1 is the control lane containing the adsorption buffer PBS. No band was formed. Lane 2 is insulin solution in PBS and lane 3 is the supernatant obtained after incubation of beads with insulin solution and centrifugation which contained unbound insulin. Lanes 2 and 3 showed bands for insulin. Lanes 4, 5 and 6 are the washes of beads with PBS for removal of any unbound insulin. These lanes did not show any band confirming there is less than microgram amounts of insulin in the wash fractions. Lane 7 is the final sample obtained after the three washes with PBS that showed a band for insulin confirming its presence and binding onto the beads.

Western blot for detection of insulin receptor (IR) in cell lysates The presence of insulin receptors in NIH-3T3, COS-7 and CHO cell lysates was confirmed using western blot. Cells, when treated with DFP (Figure 12, a), showed a band at 95 kDa (shown by a black arrow) upon incubation with insulin receptor beta (C-19) primary antibody against the receptor indicating the presence of the receptor in the cell lysates. Experiment was also repeated without DFP treatment (Figure 12, b), where the CHO and COS-7 cells did not show strong bands for insulin receptor, whereas the NIH-3T3 cells showed a band.

Western blot confirmation of phosphotyrosine (YP) activity in cell lysates Western blot was performed on CHO (Figure 13, a), COS-7 (Figure 13, b) and NIH-3T3 (Figure 13, c) cell lysates using the anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibody in order to examine the tyrosine phosphorylation activity in response to insulin since it is an important step in insulin signal transduction. Three time points were performed where cells were incubated with insulin coated beads for 5, 10 and 15 minutes alongside two controls, C1 and C2. Control C1 cells were not treated with insulin or beads (0 minute). Control C2 cells were incubated with only beads for 15 minutes. Proteins that were phosphorylated were detected by the antibody and appeared on the blot. Compared to the control lanes, the 10 and 15 minutes incubation lanes produced more bands, indicating that more proteins were phosphorylated in the process of insulin signaling for these times.

Confocal microscopy of Akt-PH-GFP Cells were transfected with Akt-PH-GFP to confirm its localization to the site of receptor activation by insulin coated microbeads and to observe its distribution with the help of confocal microscopy. GFP or green fluorescent protein helped to visualize and monitor the distribution. CHO cells that were not transfected with Akt-PH-GFP acted as the control cells (Figure 14, panel A) and showed no signal showing that the cells had no detectable fluorescence at these settings. Transfected CHO cells (Figure 14, panel B) showed cytosolic signal throughout the cell with slight increase in intensity around the nucleus. Transfected cells treated with insulin coated beads for 15 minutes (Figure 14, panel C) showed bright fluorescence at the cell membrane confirming that insulin coated beads induced insulin receptor signaling resulting in the localization of the Akt-PH-GFP to the cell membrane. See Appendix F for images of COS-7 and Appendix G for NIH-3T3 cells that showed similar results as CHO cells for each of the above stated conditions.

Immunofluorescence staining for Phosphotyrosine, Insulin Receptor and Insulin Immunofluorescence studies helped to detect the phosphotyrosine activity which is an important step in insulin signaling and the presence of insulin receptors and insulin distribution in cells through staining of formaldehyde fixed cells with appropriate primary antibodies and their respective Cy-3 conjugated secondary antibodies. Incubation of CHO cells with antiphosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody (Figure 15, panel A) showed fluorescence indicating phosphorylation of proteins at tyrosine residues. Incubation of CHO cells with insulin receptor beta (C-19) antibody (Figure 16, panel A) showed bright fluorescence around the cell membrane confirming the presence of insulin receptors at the surface. Incubation of CHO cells with insulin antibody (Figure 17, panel A) produced fluorescence over the entire cell body showing the presence of insulin. There were three types of control sets in the experiment that showed very minimal fluorescence. Images of control experiments were taken with the same setting as those when the primary antibodies were used. Control 1 (C1) cells (panel B in Figures 15, 16 and 17) were not treated with insulin or beads (0 minute). Control 2 (C2) cells (panel C in Figures 15, 16 and 17) were treated with insulin coated beads for 15 minutes and incubated with Cy-3 conjugated secondary antibody alone in order to account for any non specific binding and to confirm that cell staining and fluorescence was produced due to the specific binding of the antibody to its target protein. Control 3 (C3) cells (panel D in Figures 15, 16 and 17) were treated only with beads, without any insulin to confirm that the presence of insulin ligand is a significant factor in the production and transmission of signal to the cell. See Appendix J for images of COS-7 and Appendix K for NIH-3T3 cells that showed similar results as CHO cells.

Isolation of Insulin receptor complex on the beads: LAC (Ligand Affinity Chromatography) Insulin receptor complex was activated and captured by insulin coated microbeads on the surface of CHO, COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells. Confirmation of the presence of insulin receptor (IR) and phosphotyrosine activity of proteins that may be present in the complex was done using western blot for all three cell lines. Two sets of experiments were done, one that included DFP treatment of cells and the other did not include treatment with DFP. In both cases, blots for samples incubated with insulin receptor antibody (Figure 18) showed expected bands (marked by a black arrow) for the receptor at 95 kDa (the weight of the receptor) for cells incubated with insulin coated beads (for 15 minutes), confirming that the isolated complex contained the receptor protein. There were two controls, C1 and C2. C1 were cells that were not treated with insulin or beads (0 minute). C2 cells were incubated with only beads for 15 minutes. The control cells that were treated with DFP (Figure 18, A, C, E) produced bands for the receptor and those that were not treated with DFP (Figure 18, B, D, F) did not produce any band. The blots for samples incubated with the 4G10 antibody for phosphotyrosine (Figure 19) showed bands for phosphorylated proteins that were present in the receptor-bead complex. Cells that were incubated with insulin coated beads for 15 minutes and treated with DFP produced more bands as compared to those that were not treated with DFP. The two control lanes (C1 and C2) in both cases showed fewer bands than the lane containing cells that were incubated with insulin coated beads for 15 minutes.

DISCUSSIONS
SDS-PAGE analysis of insulin coated beads and silver staining The SDS-PAGE analysis for confirming insulin binding on beads was performed under reducing and denaturing conditions in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT). DTT resulted in the disruption of the disulfide bonds of insulin molecule (5.8 kDa), breaking it into its chains. The band obtained on the gel was at 3.49 kDa that corresponds to the B chain of the insulin molecule. Insulin cannot be visualized by Coomassie even at high concentrations (Fujita et al., 1984). Diamine silver staining is reported to be sensitive to about 50 ng or less depending on the protein (Dionne et al., 1994; Chevallet et al., 2006). Sensitivity depends on the nature of the protein and insulin shows relatively poor sensitivity (Morrissey, 1981). Insulin was applied to the beads in a solution of 1 Âµg/Âµl and it was apparent that microgram amounts of insulin remained on the beads after washing. In previous studies, insulin receptor activation has been reported to occur at levels ranging from 0.1 to 500 ng/ml (Klein et al., 1986), which is likely well below the amount of insulin that might be detected in 20 Âµl of the washing buffer. Therefore, we cannot rule out that sufficient insulin to activate the insulin receptor was released from the beads during the experiment and this interpretation is consistent with images showing the translocation of Akt to the membrane even where no insulin coated bead is in contact with the cell.

46

Western blot for detection of insulin receptor (IR) in cell lysates Western blot was performed to confirm the presence of insulin receptors in the cell lysates. Cells treated with DFP (a potent irreversible inhibitor of serine proteases that prevents degradation of proteins), produced clear bands at the 95kDa position (molecular weight of the receptor). The band for CHO cells appeared to be thicker than the other two cell lines. Cells that were not treated with DFP showed very light bands in the case of CHO and COS-7. However, NIH-3T3 did show a strong band. DFP treated cells showed better results compared to those that were not. The comparison of results with and without DFP seem to indicate that IR is rapidly degraded in crude cell extracts. In both cases, a second thick band was observed below 66 kDa which corresponds to a protein of unknown identity (O'Neill et al., 1996) that could be a splice variant also. The reason for the extra small band at the top (~116 kDa) could be attributed to the secondary antibody. See Appendix D for loading controls.

Western blot confirmation of phosphotyrosine activity in cell lysates Western blot was performed to observe phosphorylated proteins in the cell lysates in response to insulin. Cells incubated with insulin coated beads for 10 and 15 minutes, showed more bands as compared to the controls, C1 and C2, thereby detecting more proteins that were phosphorylated due to presence of insulin. TCA (trichloroacetic acid) fixes proteins on cells and helps preserve cell structure. It inactivates tyrosine phosphatases (Hayashi et al., 1999). Vanadate is also an inhibitor of tyrosine
47

phosphatase activities which acts to preserve the phosphorylation of proteins of interest (Heffetz et al., 1990). It mimics insulin activity (Czech et al., 1974; Dubyak & Kleinzeller, 1980; May & de Haen, 1979; Schechter & Karlish, 1980). The control cells, C1 and C2 showed bands due to the presence of vanadate which may have prevented dephosphorylation in the cells. Another reason for C2 showing bands is that the beads that were present are hydrophobic in nature and so they attached to other proteins. The use of hydrophobic beads as a non-specific binding reference might provide a more meaningful control and this can be achieved by preblocking the beads with an inert control protein with physical properties similar to insulin. See Appendix E for quantification of bands on western blots using densitometric plots.

Cell transfection and confirmation of Akt-PH-GFP recruitment to cell membrane by confocal microscopy Previous studies have been done showing the recruitment of Akt-PH-GFP to quantify the production of phosphorylated inositol (PIP3) at the activated receptor complex using IgGcoated beads in Fc Receptors (Jankowski et al., 2008). It was observed that the expression of the Akt-PH-GFP yielded intense fluorescent signals at the ligand microbeads and indicated an accumulation of PIP3 at the site of the activated receptor where ligand coated microbeads bound to the cell. In the case of insulin receptors, the observation that Akt translocated to the plasma membrane may be explained by insulin dissolving from the beads and activating the IR over the cell surface. Loss of insulin into the medium might be prevented by treating the coated beads with
48

a cross-linking agent. This possibility might be confirmed by incubating beads in experimental medium, removing the beads by centrifugations and testing to see if the supernatant will activate the cells. Alternatively, the PIP3 produced at the site of IR activation rapidly diffuses around the cell membrane. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. There were a few instances where the insulin receptor appeared to collect around insulin coated beads and this is consistent with the nature of the IR that is known to be freely mobile (Lange, 2002). However as noted above, if the insulin receptors had already bound the activating ligand from the pool dissolved in the medium, then there would be no reason to collect around the ligand beads as observed. A control experiment was done for a GFP-only plasmid in CHO cells (Appendix H). Fluorescence of high intensity was observed evenly throughout the cell, as compared to Akt-PH-GFP transfected cells where the fluorescence signal was slightly more around the nucleus, showing the location of Akt. The option of having another set of control cells that are transfected and treated with only beads can be proposed for future experiments which could provide information on how the beads alone act in the environment of cells transfected with Akt-PHGFP. See Appendix I for more images of transfected CHO cells where fluorescence is intense at

the site of beads.

Immunofluorescence staining for Phosphotyrosine, Insulin Receptor and Insulin The failure to detect the insulin in the beads by immunostaining, as compared to Western blot, seems to indicate that the insulin antibody was not effective to bind insulin in the native state.

49

Although it remains possible that some insulin washed away from the beads, the pool of insulin that must have remained bound to the beads showed no reactivity at all with the antibody. Alternatively, it might be that the anti-insulin antibody was sterically hindered in its binding to insulin adsorbed to the beads. The failure of the insulin coated beads to act as a positive control make the insulin staining observed through the cell difficult to interpret. It may be possible that the insulin observed throughout the cell resulted from its binding to the receptor followed by internalization (Di Guglielmo et al., 1998). The observation of a bright phosphotyrosine signal in the cells treated with insulin coated beads seems directly interpretable as the result of the well known chain of IR receptor phosphorylation followed by the phosphorylation of its cellular targets (Di Guglielmo et al., 1998). The observation that the IR was detected with a strong signal in the positive cells but the signal was markedly reduced in the control cells may indicate that the antibody binds with a great affinity to the receptor after it has changed its conformation upon binding its ligand or perhaps after phosphorylation. However, taken together the observations that insulin in the cell but not the beads, the anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-IR antibodies, all showed stronger signalling in the positive experiments but not in the control, may indicate the presence of some sort of systemic bias in the experiments that remains to be defined. See Appendix L for quantification of fluorescence signal intensity for immunostain images of CHO cells.

50

Isolation of Insulin receptor complex on the beads The apparent successful capture of the insulin receptor in cells without treatment by DFP seems on the surface to be a validation of the approach of ligand affinity capture of the IR complex. However the observations may also be interpreted to indicate that IR is rapidly degraded in crude cell extracts and does not survive long enough to non-specifically adsorb to the polystyrene beads. Alternatively, the result may indicate that the insulin receptor may be more resistant to degradation when bound to its ligand on microbeads. Taken together, these results indicate that it may be necessary to block the insulin coated beads with another inert protein to prevent non-specific background binding in the controls beads. A second thick band was observed below 66 kDa for all the cell lines in both DFP treated and untreated conditions, which is a protein of unknown identity (O'Neill et al., 1996) that could be a splice variant also. See Appendix O for densitometric plots.

CONCLUSION
For the purpose of this study, three mammalian cell lines were used, each belonging to a different organ, species and having different morphologies. These cell lines were not overexpressed or mutated with insulin receptors and were also easy to transfect. All the cell lines produced close to similar results, however, the CHO cells were easier to grow and work with. Compared to COS-7 and NIH-3T3, the CHO cells also produced a thicker band for insulin receptor in the western blot experiment for detection of the receptor. Western blots helped to detect presence of insulin receptor in the cells in the presence of DFP and helped to confirm that tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in response to insulin which is a crucial step in insulin signaling process. The best and maximum phosphorylation occurred at 15 minutes incubation of cells with insulin coated beads as shown by phosphotyrosine blots and immunostain images. The PH domain of Akt was fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) to monitor the distribution of phosphoinositide (PIP3) in live cells acting as a biosensor for phosphatidylinositol. Confocal microscopy helped to analyze the translocation of the protein at the site of insulin receptor activation. Microbeads coated with insulin ligand proved helpful in regulating proteinphospholipid interaction in mammalian cells. The main objective of this study was to use the above mentioned experimental tools in order to develop a model to isolate activated insulin receptor and identify novel proteins to investigate mechanism of diseases like diabetes. Activated receptor complex from the surface of live cells was successfully captured and isolated using ligand-coated microbeads (LAC) which could further lead to identification of members of the receptor complex or pathway by liquid-chromatography and mass spectrometry. LAC could provide useful information on the isoforms of the protein families involved in insulin receptor
52

function. Similar model of study could be applicable to a variety of other cell surface receptors for understanding their ligand-receptor complexes in cells.

53

FUTURE OBJECTIVES
An issue of concern that arose from the results of immunostaining and cell transfection experiments was the leaking out or washing away of the insulin ligand from the beads. An alternative approach to overcome this problem in future experiments could be the use of chemical agents for cross-linking the insulin ligand to the beads instead of merely incubating the beads with insulin which was done in this study. The isolated and captured insulin receptor complex can be subjected to mass spectrometry for further analysis. Mass spectrometry is a well-known method used for the identification and analysis of proteins in cell lysates. It is a fast, powerful, selective, sensitive and an ideal tool for the analysis of post-translational modifications (McLachlin & Chait, 2001; Annan et al., 2001; Mann et al., 2002), since that cannot be determined from DNA sequence alone. Phosphorylation on serine, threonine or tyrosine residues is an important and very common post-translational modification of proteins (Benjamin et al., 2005). There are several proteins (members of the receptor family) attached to the receptor complex that could be identified using the mass spectrometer.
