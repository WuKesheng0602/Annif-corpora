ABSTRACT

Combined Anaerobic-Aerobic and UV/H2O2 Processes for the Treatment of Synthetic Slaughterhouse Wastewater

Ciro Fernando Bustillo Lecompte Master of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University 2012

The biological treatment of a synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater (SSWW) was studied using an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) and an aerobic activated sludge (AS) at a laboratory scale, with total organic carbon (TOC) loading rates of 0.03­1.01 g/(L.day), total nitrogen (TN) loading rates of 0.01­0.19 g/(L.day), and a flow rate of 2.93 to 11.70 mL/min in continuous mode. Results revealed that combined anaerobic-aerobic processes had higher efficiency to treat SSWW than a single process. Up to 96.36% TOC, 80.53% TN, and 99.38% 5-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) removal from an influent concentration of 1,008.85 mgTOC/L, 419.77 mgTN/L, and 640 mgCBOD5/L at the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6.24 days and a flow rate of 3.75 mL/min was achieved. The UV/H2O2 process was studied to treat a secondary effluent of SSWW with TOC loadings of 64.88­349.84 mg/L. Up to 75.22% TOC and 84.38% CBOD5 removal were obtained for an influent concentration of 64.88 mgTOC/L at the HRT of 3 h with H2O2 concentration of 900 mg/L. An optimum molar ratio dosage of 13.87 mgH2O2/mgTOCin was also obtained. Combined anaerobicaerobic and UV/H2O2 processes enhanced the biodegradability of the TOC, TN, and CBOD5 present in the SSWW. Up to 99.98% TOC, 82.84% TN, and 99.69% CBOD5 overall removals were obtained for an influent concentration of 1,004.88 mgTOC/L, 200.03 mgTN/L, and 640 mgCBOD5/L at the HRT of 4 days and a flow rate of 5.90 mL/min. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed for the optimum conditions for the SSWW treatment by optimizing total electricity cost and HRT, in which the combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes had an optimal TOC removal of 92.46% at an HRT of 41 h, a cost of $1.25/kg of TOC removed, and $11.60/m3 of treated SSWW. This process reaches a maximum TOC removal of 99% in 76.5 h with an estimated cost of $2.19/kg TOC removed and $21.65/m3 treated SSWW.

Keywords: Synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater (SSWW); anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR); aerobic activated sludge (AS); UV/H2O2; TOC; TN; CBOD5; combined processes.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
The increasing growth of the world's population has increased the pollution of freshwater due to the discharge of inadequately treated industrial and municipal wastewater. Along with industrial development, the problem increases daily, especially in developing countries (Amit and Rupali, 2004; Leitao et al., 2006; Krishna et al., 2009; Feng et al., 2009). For this reason, water and wastewater treatment has become very important for the continuing development of current society. Moreover, the progressively stricter standards for effluent discharge in North America and the European Union (EU) have made the developing of advanced wastewater treatment technologies necessary (Environment Canada, 2000; US EPA, 2004; World Bank Group, 2007). In addition, the continuing decreasing availability of freshwater resources has rearranged the objectives in the wastewater treatment field from disposal to reuse and recycling. As a result, a high level of treatment efficiency has to be achieved. Given the differences in location, economic resources, and living standards of different countries and characteristics of water and its pollutants, many nations adopt diverse techniques for water and wastewater treatment.

Slaughterhouses produce large amounts of wastewater during the slaughtering process and periodic cleaning of residual particles. Although composition of slaughterhouse wastewaters varies based on the industrial process and water demand, these wastes usually contain high levels of organics with a large biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and nitrogen and phosphorus from organic materials, including pieces of fat, grease, proteins, flesh, manure, grit, undigested feed, blood, hair and feathers (Camin, 1970; Bull et al., 1982; Sachon, 1982; Sachon, 1986; Sayed et al., 1988; Tritt and Schuchardt, 1992; Johns, 1995; Ruiz et al., 1997; Masse and Masse, 2000b; Sirianuntapiboon and Manoonpong, 2001; Matsumura and Mierzwa, 2008; Debik and Coskun, 2009).

Slaughterhouse wastewaters are typically treated in anaerobic reactors because of the high level of COD, which is used to measure the amount of organic compounds in water indirectly.
1

Nevertheless, anaerobic treatment methods have process instabilities including a low settling rate and the need for post-treatment of the noxious anaerobic effluent, which usually contains ammonium ions (NH4+), and hydrogen sulphide (HS-) (Heijnen et al., 1991; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011). Although anaerobic treatment is efficient, complete stabilization of the organic matter is not possible by anaerobic treatment alone as the effluent produced by anaerobic treatment contains solubilised organic matters, which are more suited for treatment using aerobic processes or anaerobic­aerobic systems (Gray, 2005). For that reason, later post-treatment using aerobic treatment is necessary to meet the standards (Chan et al., 2009). Moreover, for the biological removal of nutrients (N and P), an adequate combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes is essential (Del Pozo and Diez, 2005).

According to Aggelis et al. (2001), neither anaerobic nor aerobic processes should be employed alone for efficient treatment, since aerobic or anaerobic treatment alone does not produce effluents that comply with effluent discharge limits when treating high organic strength wastewaters. The use of combined anaerobic-aerobic processes can also lead to a reduction in operating costs when compared with aerobic treatment alone (Vera et al., 1999), while simultaneously resulting in high organic matter removal efficiency and a smaller amount of aerobic sludge without pH correction. Benefits of the combined anaerobic-aerobic processes include potential resource recovery as anaerobic pre-treatment removes most of the organic pollutants and converts them into biogas and high overall treatment efficiency due to aerobic post-treatment (Frostell, 1983; Cervantes et al., 2006).

Biological treatment of wastewater is usually the most cost-effective technology (Pittier and Chudoba, 1990; Ruiz et al., 1997; Barber and Stuckey, 1999; Pulgarín et al., 1999; Masse and Masse, 2000b; Sarria et al., 2003; Al-Mutairi et al., 2008; Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Krishna et al., 2009; Chan et al., 2009; Oller et al., 2011). However, industrial effluents and slaughterhouse wastewaters contain toxic and non-biodegradable organic substances, which make biological treatment alone insufficient (Steber and Wierich, 1986; Bowers et al., 1989; Adams et al., 1996; Pulgarín and Kiwi, 1996; García et al., 2001; Muñoz and Guieysee, 2006; Lapertot et al., 2006; Oller et al., 2011). As a result, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been used to improve the biotreatability of wastewaters containing non-biodegradable organics, which are toxic to common microorganisms. AOPs are related to the production of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) (Balcioglu et al., 2001; Bhatkhande et al., 2002; Neyens and Baeyens, 2003; Gonze et al., 2003; Sarria et al., 2003; García-Montaño et al., 2006; Sarria et al., 2009), which have a very high oxidation potential and are able to oxidize almost
2

all organic pollutants (Gogate and Pandit, 2004a; Gogate and Pandit, 2004b; Devipriyas and Yesodharan, 2005; Pignatello et al., 2006; Pera-Titus et al., 2007; Comninellis et al., 2008; Shannon et al., 2008). Although these methods are very effective in wastewater treatment, they are expensive if applied alone. Therefore, a good alternative is to combine biological treatment and AOPs.

Objectives The objectives of this study are to determine the efficiency of the combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes for the treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater; to evaluate the performance of a complementary aerobic treatment for biological nutrient removal by nitrification and denitrification; to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of different configurations of the combined processes, varying the number of phases and their order as a system; and to analyze the factors affecting its performance, the characteristics of slaughterhouse wastewater including its impacts on the environment and health effects, and the current standards and regulations for its discharge. In summary the objectives of the present study are:

1. To determine the performance and the treatment ability of the ABR, the aerobic AS, and the UV/H2O2 processes, as well as their combination in the removal of TOC, TN, and BOD from SSWW. 2. To evaluate the effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and influent concentrations of SSWW to the reactors on their performance. 3. To determine the optimal concentration of H2O2 and the optimum molar ratio dosage for TOC removal in a secondary effluent of SSWW. 4. To use a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in order to determine the best alternative, by evaluating the total electricity cost, the effects of the HRT, the cost of H2O2 consumption, and the percentage of removal of TOC.

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1. Introduction This chapter provides a comprehensive review of slaughterhouse wastewater treatment processes including anaerobic baffled reactors (ABR), aerobic activated sludge (AS), and UV/H2O2 as well as the factors affecting their performance and a description of their mechanisms. This chapter also reviews the characteristics, environmental impacts, health effects, and regulatory framework, including the current technologies, relevant to slaughterhouse wastewater.

2.2. Slaughterhouse wastewater characteristics The treatment and disposal of wastewater from slaughterhouses and meat processing plants (MPPs) are an economic and public health necessity. The main source of slaughterhouse wastewater are the feces, urine, blood, lint, fat, carcasses, non-digested food in the intestines, the leftovers, the slop from the floors, utensils, the removal of bristles, storage of skins, the cleaning of bowels, guts room and laundry produced when slaughtering animals (Muñoz, 2005).

Slaughterhouse wastewater is considered detrimental worldwide due to its composition, characterized mostly by a complex mixture of fats, proteins and fibres (Camin, 1970; Bull et al., 1982; Sachon, 1982; Sachon, 1986; Sayed et al., 1988; Tritt and Schuchardt, 1992; Johns, 1995). Wastewaters from slaughterhouses and MPPs have been considered as an industrial waste in the category of agricultural and food industries and classified as one of the most harmful to the environment by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) (Walter et al., 1974). Effluent discharge from slaughterhouses causes deoxygenation of rivers (Quinn and McFarlane, 1989) and contamination of groundwater (Sangodoyin and Agbawhe, 1992; Masse and Masse, 2000b). The organic matter concentration is medium to high and the residues are moderately solubilised, leading to a highly polluting effect (Ruiz et al., 1997). They usually contain high levels of organics, pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and detergents and disinfectants used for cleaning activities (Bull et al., 1982; Ruiz et al., 1997; Masse and Masse, 2000b; Debik and
4

Coskun, 2009). High concentrations of BOD, COD and TSS in slaughterhouse wastewater containing flesh and blood have been reported to be 200,000, 375,000 and 2,800 mg/L or more, respectively (Tritt and Schuchardt, 1992; Masse and Masse, 2000a).

Several studies have described the common characteristics of slaughterhouse wastewater (Gariepy et al., 1989; Masse and Masse, 2000a; Seif and Moursy, 2001; Debik and Coskun, 2009; Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera, 2011; Barrera et al., 2011). These characteristics are summarized in Table 2.1, in which their common ranges and averages for slaughterhouse wastewater, including COD, TOC, BOD, TSS, TN, and pH among others are presented.

2.2.1. Slaughterhouse wastewater occurrence Slaughterhouses are MPPs, where a variety of animals including cattle, hogs and poultry are slaughtered for human consumption and animal feeding operations (Wang et al., 2010). The meat processing industry is one of the major consumers of fresh water among industrial food processing facilities, as shown in Table 2.2, which makes it a significant producer of wastewater effluents. The World Bank classifies a slaughterhouse plant as a meat processing facility that may consume between 2.5 and 40 m3 of water per metric tonnes of beef produced (World Bank, 1999).

The production of beef has been growing steadily in recent years mostly in India and China due to income increases and the shift toward a western-like diet rich in proteins (Halweil, 2008). From 2002 to 2007, the global annual production of beef increased 14.7 million tonnes, representing an increase of 29% over 8 years (UN FAO, 2010). As a result, it can be inferred that the number of slaughterhouse facilities will get bigger, resulting in a greater volume of high-strength wastewater to be treated. Therefore, this growing industry will require reliable and effective technologies to treat these effluents properly before being discharged into source waters to minimize negative environmental impacts. Moreover, there is an additional problem specifically related to aging infrastructure, which may add to the potential risk of untreated wastewater reaching receiving waters. According to the International Joint Commission (IJC) (2009), the collection systems responsible for transporting wastewater to sewage treatment plants in some parts of North America were constructed back in the 19th century and many of them have not been upgraded and are beyond the capacity for which they were originally designed. These collection systems have been designed to work as combined sewer systems (CSSs); therefore, domestic, commercial, industrial and storm-water are all transported through the same pipe connected to the water treatment facility.

The main problem of the CSSs is the overflow due to the wet-weather periods of heavy rainfall and snowmelt, when the pipes cannot handle the large volumes of water being driven into the system thereby exceeding its capacity, and resulting in a direct dumping of the combined raw sewage and storm-water into the receiving water bodies. As a result, massive loads of organic matter,
6

microorganisms and pathogens, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, as well as toxic and hazardous compounds from industrial sources could reach water bodies without proper treatment (Nemerow, 2007). Most of the remaining CSSs in North America are located in the Northeast part of the continent, particularly within the Great Lakes region. About 70% of the CSSs located in the US territory are found surrounding the Great Lakes. Meanwhile, in Canada, 20% of Ontario municipalities have CSSs representing a potential risk for overflow events to occur (IJC, 2009). According to the International Joint Commission (IJC) (2009), several Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) events have been reported in the last decade near Great Lakes communities in Ontario. For instance, 107 confirmed CSOs with 1,544 releases of raw or partially treated sewage were reported in 2006. A recent report on pollutant sources affecting the Great Lakes stated that the CSO events are a major problem for the Saint Clair River water quality due to the constant discharges of raw sewage from the Sarnia sewer system during CSO events (USACE, 2004).

There are approximately 142 slaughterhouses in Ontario that can process a certain number of animals per day (Table 2.3). On-site treatment would be the best option to treat and disinfect the effluents, so they could then be discharged safely into receiving waters. Thus, the transportation of the water through the sewer system into the municipal wastewater treatment facilities would be avoided, minimizing the risk of raw water releases during overflow events. According to Wu and Mittal (2011), 53% of Ontario's slaughterhouses did not treat their wastewater prior to disposal (Figure 2.1). Only 16% of Ontario's slaughterhouses used dissolved air floatation (DAF) or aeration. The remaining 31% of slaughterhouses utilized passive systems such as storage tank or lagoon to settle solids. 6% of the slaughterhouses did not store the wastewater, and the drainage of these slaughterhouses was directly connected to the sewage treatment plant (STP). 80% of the slaughterhouses stored the wastewater in a retention tank prior to disposal and the remaining slaughterhouses stored the wastewater in lagoons or ponds. The sizes of these tanks varied from 3,000 to 750,000 L. 15% of the slaughterhouses disposed the wastewater at the STP. 9% of the slaughterhouses were directly connected to the STP and 6% of them used a hauler to haul the wastewater to the STP. 11% of the slaughterhouses used leaching bed for the disposal of the wastewater. An additional 21% used both the leaching bed and haulers to dispose of the wastewater. 43% of the slaughterhouses land applied the wastewater. Of the 43% that land applied, 33% of them used hauler to land apply the wastewater. 53% of them land applied the wastewater on premises and the remaining 14% land applied elsewhere.

2.2.2. Slaughterhouse wastewater guidelines and regulations Regulations and guidelines are essential components in dealing with the environmental impact of slaughterhouse industries. The treatment systems developed by industry are frequently regarded as a regulatory obligation, increasing capital and running costs, and yielding negative economic returns. Compliance with environmental legislation should not necessarily lead to the creation of additional costs, but can instead provide a secondary source of income. The standards and regulations governing slaughterhouses vary considerably around the world. In many countries, the slaughter of animals is regulated by custom and tradition rather than by law. Two main kinds of meat processing systems are available, one that is produced in modern mechanized slaughterhouses and the other from local butcher shops.

The selection of a particular treatment depends on the characteristics of the wastewater, the available technology, and the compliance with current regulations. For instance, some MPPs are allowed to discharge their effluent into the municipal sewer system after demonstrating an adequate reduction of BOD loads by preliminary treatment (Tchobanoglous et al., 2003). The main factors determining whether a plant can discharge into the municipal sewer or not are related to the plant size as well as the volume and organic concentration of the wastewater produced (US EPA, 2004). A major concern with MPP' effluent is related to the discharge of oxygen-demanding constituents into receiving water bodies. Regulatory agencies in North America such as the U.S. EPA, Environment Canada and Provincial Ministries of Environment as well as the European Environment Agency (EEA) are directing efforts at outlining standards to limit maximum concentrations of oxygen-demanding compounds, especially concentrations of BOD and COD, being discharged directly or indirectly into water bodies (CEC, 1991; US EPA, 2004). Table 2.4 describes the standard levels and concentration limits of organic constituents to be discharged into water bodies as recommended by different worldwide agencies, including Environment Canada, the US EPA, the Council of the European Communities (CEC) among others.

Although, it can be seen that Canadian standards are very strict in comparison with other international regulations, such as the Council of the European Communities and the US EPA, Canada does not have a specific regulation for the meat and poultry processing industry. Nevertheless, some provinces, such as British Columbia, have been trying to develop a set of guidelines to specifically address MPP effluents by creating a code of practices that has been incorporated into the provincial Environmental Management Act, brought into force in 2004 (BC MOE, 2010). Moreover, the US EPA has been incorporating an integrated approach for the regulation of the MPP, where industry and regulatory sectors are working together in order to achieve a common goal of reducing the threats caused by the hazardous and high strength wastewaters produced in slaughterhouses. This approach includes different concepts, such as the Best Practicable Control Technology Available (BPT), Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT), Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BAT), New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), and Pre-treatment Standards for Existing Sources (PSES), for the better understanding of the procedures and regulations to follow under any situation; and thus, efficiency and cost-reduction without affecting quality.

Table 2.5 lists all methods for the analysis of different parameters of the slaughterhouse wastewater specified in the Ontario regulations (OMOE, 1996), including COD, BOD5, total solids (TS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia and ammonium nitrogen, nitrite and nitrate nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), total sodium, pH, the 11 metals specified in the Ontario regulations (OMOE, 1996), and fat oil and grease (FOG).

2.2.3. Environmental impacts The commercialization of animal products for consumption leads without doubt to the production of high waste volumes. The environment is able to handle certain amounts of pollutants through several natural degradation processes. Nevertheless, as the concentration of waste increases, nature's mechanisms come to be overburdened and contamination problems commence. Therefore, new treatment methods have to be developed for a more efficient management of waste products.

In the slaughtering process, animals are reared, fattened, and transported. After processing, the meat is stored before it is transported to retail outlets; these activities produce manure. Storage and transport activities, where cooling facilities are needed, require large amounts of energy sources. Hides produced at slaughterhouses must be stored. To prevent spoilage, they should be pickled and preservatives are added. The methods used to process hides will determine the durability of the produced leather. The production of more durable leather leads to smaller quantities of leather waste. Chrome-tanned leather and leather products contain about 2­3% of dry weight chromium (Verheijen et al., 1996). Exhausted leather products, such as shoes and jackets, are frequently dumped at municipal dumping sites. Before its collection and transportation to a processing plant, milk is
16

produced and stored at the farm. This requires energy and leads to spoilage of milk and production of wastewater by cleaning activities. The most important environmental impact of the animal processing industry results from the discharge of wastewater. Most processes in slaughterhouses require the use of water, which produce wastewater. The strength and composition of pollutants in the wastewater evidently depend on the nature of the processes involved (Verheijen et al., 1996).

Biodegradable organic compounds (BOCs) from slaughterhouse activities have the greatest environmental impact (Masse and Masse, 2000b). Parameters used to determine BOCs are BOD, COD, and TSS. The BOD and COD are overall parameters that give an indication of the concentration of organic compounds in wastewater. The concentration of suspended solids represents the amount of insoluble organic and inorganic particles in the wastewater (Verheijen et al., 1996; Rajakumar et al., 2011).

On February 26, 2004, the EPA established new wastewater discharge limits (Table 2.6) for the meat and poultry products (MPP) industry, which also set effluent limits for poultry processors for the first time that causes a reduction in discharges of conventional pollutants, ammonia, and nitrogen to rivers, lakes, and streams (US EPA, 2004).

The discharge of raw slaughterhouse wastewater to water bodies can affect the quality of water in three main ways as follows:

1. The discharge of BOCs may cause a strong reduction of DO, which in turn may lead to reduced levels of activity or even death of aquatic life (Quinn and McFarlane, 1989; Sangodoyin and Agbawhe, 1992; Verheijen et al., 1996; Masse and Masse, 2000b; Torkian et al., 2003).

2. Macronutrients (N and P) may cause eutrophication of the receiving water bodies; while phosphates (PO42­) are the primary source of eutrophication; nitrogenous wastes contribute significantly to this water pollution problem. These nutrients cause an excessive algae growth and subsequent dying off. The mineralization of these algae may lead to the death of aquatic life because of oxygen depletion (Masse and Masse, 2000b; Belsky et al., 1999). 3. Finally, slaughterhouse wastewater effluents may contain compounds, such as chromium and unionized ammonia, which are directly toxic to aquatic life, as well as tannin, which is an astringent, bitter plant polyphenolic compound (Figure 2.2) that binds to and precipitates proteins and various other organic compounds including amino acids and alkaloids (Verheijen et al., 1996).

On the other hand, several studies show the impact of wastewater effluents loaded with high amounts of organic constituents on recipient water bodies. For example, the Ikpoba River in Nigeria is an example of water quality decrease. The river has being affected by high coliform concentrations stemming from discharged slaughterhouse wastewater. As described by Benka-Coker and Ojior (1995), the pathogenic bacteria concentration, including species such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Klebsiella, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, was increased from 104 to 107 CFU/100mL due to an untreated slaughterhouse effluent being discharged in upstream. The concentrations of TSS, BOD, nitrates, and phosphates were increased leading to a reduction of the concentration of DO from 7.2 to 2.4 mg/L. Therefore, the water quality of the receiving water was severely affected by not having a proper treatment technology for the reduction of the organic content from the slaughterhouse plant.

Likewise, the Bogota River flowing through Bogota, the capital city of Colombia, receives approximately 93,853 tonnes of total suspended solids and 75,016 tonnes of BOD5 on an annual basis (Kingsley, 2011). Different sources, including slaughterhouses, upstream municipalities, horticultural facilities and coal yards, are responsible for the production of this high-strength wastewater. As a result, the Bogota River has several sections in which aquatic life no longer exists along with a putrefied odour derived from the abundant hydrogen sulphide in the river produced by the anaerobic biodegradation processes.

2.2.4. Health effects The Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) guidelines (Table 2.7) for meat processing, according to the World Bank Group include information relevant to meat processing, focusing on bovine and porcine slaughtering and processing from reception of the animals until the carcasses are ready for sale or further processing (World Bank Group, 2007). These guidelines are achievable under normal operating conditions in appropriately designed and operated facilities through the application of pollution prevention and control techniques.

Table 2.8 shows the standard levels recommended for slaughterhouse wastewater discharge in Canada (Environment Canada, 2000). These levels should be achieved without dilution for at least 95% of the plant or unit operation time. They are applicable to direct discharges of treated effluents to surface water for general use.

The impact of slaughterhouse wastewater on the soil and groundwater is characterized by pollution via nitrate and chloric anions, and many pathogenic microorganisms, which persist in the soil and reproduce continuously. Pathogenic microorganisms from cattle wastes can be also transmitted to humans who are exposed to the water body, making those areas non-suitable for drinking or irrigation purposes (Sangodoyin and Agbawhe, 1992; Benka-Coker and Ojior, 1995; Fang, 2000).
20

People from developing countries in South America and Africa have experienced serious gastrointestinal diseases, bloody diarrhoea, liver malfunctions, and in some cases, death associated with the presence of viruses, protozoa, helminthic eggs and bacteria in slaughterhouse wastewaters due to the poor management of the slaughterhouse wastewater (Prando and Gambogi, 2009; Krishna et al., 2009; Feng et al., 2009). In short, slaughterhouse wastewater must be treated efficiently before discharge into water bodies in order to avoid environmental pollution and human health effects (Belsky et al., 1999; Salminen and Rintala, 2002). On the other hand, wastewater workers in Cincinnati, Ohio; Anchorage, Alaska; and Ontario, Canada; have contracted hepatitis A. The Ontario workers worked in a primary purging station, grit chambers, and maintenance on sewer cleaning machines (Brown, 1997).

2.3. Slaughterhouse wastewater treatment technologies In natural water, there are two main routes for destroying toxic compounds, photodegradation, and biodegradation. Photodegradation is an important mechanism for degrading aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated phenols, and many pesticides by direct or indirect photolysis, where a photosensitizer absorbs light and transfers the energy to pollutants. Biodegradation refers to the elimination of the pollutant by the metabolic activity of living organisms, usually microorganisms particularly bacteria and fungi that live in natural water and soil (Oller et al., 2011).

SSWW treatment technologies are similar to those used in municipal wastewater systems and may include primary, secondary, and even tertiary treatment for some cases (Wang et al., 2010). Physical, chemical, and biological treatment systems can be used in slaughterhouse wastewater decontamination. Each system has unique treatment advantages and disadvantages (Rajakumar et al., 2011). The feasibility of using many individual or combined reactor types to treat SSWW biologically has been examined in the past. Difficulties relating to fats and particulates have been mainly solved in the digestion processes (Debik and Coskun, 2009)

Physical processes are widely used in water and wastewater treatment plants. These physical techniques are based on the separation of one or more compounds from the waste stream. Because of the separation, the pollutant is transferred from one phase to another. Therefore, further treatment is required for the degradation of the contaminants in the second phase. Physical methods are employed mainly to separate large settleable and floating matter, clarify turbid solutions, recover, and recycle valuable substances utilized in the main processes and in separating inorganic materials. The conventional and advanced physical techniques include filtration, adsorption, gas stripping, and others.

Land application of slaughterhouse wastewater by spray irrigation has been used in the USA (Bull et al., 1982). Presently, in Ontario, land application of wastewater generated from slaughterhouse falls under the Environmental Protection Act (OMOE, 1996) and the determining factors for suitability are the same factors used for sewage, and pulp and paper biosolids (Wu and Mittal, 2011). Simplicity and low cost are its main advantages. Disadvantages include probable surface and ground water contamination, odours, production of greenhouse gases, and soil pore
22

obstruction from fat loads. Application on constructed wetlands could be also used as a polishing treatment for biologically treated wastewater (Johns, 1995). The land application, however, is not convenient at low temperatures (Masse and Masse, 2000b).

Grit chambers, screens, settling tanks, and dissolved air flotation (DAF) units are widely used for the removal of TSS, colloidal, and fats from slaughterhouse wastewater. In DAF units, aeration from the bottom of the tank move light solids, fat and grease to the surface where scum is periodically skimmed off.

Camin (1970) surveyed wastewater treatment in over 200 meatpacking plants in the USA and concluded that air flotation was the least efficient treatment in terms of dollars per weight of BOD removed in comparison to aerobic and anaerobic systems. Blood coagulants like aluminum sulphate and ferric chloride or flocculants like polymers are sometimes added to the wastewater in the DAF unit to increase protein flocculation and precipitation as well as fat flotation.

Chemical DAF units can reach COD reductions of between 32 and 90%, and are able to remove large amounts of nutrients. However, operational problems like the production of large volumes of rotten sludge that require special handling and further treatment have been reported (Johns, 1995).

Secondary treatment is aimed at reducing BOD concentration by removing the soluble organic compounds in either solution or suspension, which remain after primary treatment (Tchobanoglous et al., 2003). Biological treatment may include different combinations of various processes, including anaerobic, aerobic and facultative lagoons, activated sludge, and trickling filters among others (US EPA, 2004). These combined processes are capable of obtaining organic matter removal up to 90­ 95% at typical retention times of approximately 20 days (Tchobanoglous et al., 2003; Del Pozo and Diez, 2005; Wang, 2005).

Biological treatment is often the most applied process in slaughterhouse plants as secondary treatment, comprised of aerobic and anaerobic digestion that are used alone or combined depending on the characteristics of the wastewater being treated (Baruth, 2005).

23

Nevertheless, anaerobic digestion is the preferred biological treatment that is applied in slaughterhouse wastewater treatment due to its effectiveness in treating high-strength wastewater (Verheijen et al., 1996; Tchobanoglous et al., 2003; US EPA, 2004; Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011). Table 2.9 shows a summary of the current SSWW treatment technologies that have been successfully applied to deal with the environmental impacts and health effects caused by these highstrength wastewaters.

2.3.1. Anaerobic biological treatment During anaerobic digestion, organics are degraded by a diversity of bacteria into methane in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic systems have several advantages such as high efficiency in reducing COD in soluble and insoluble form; a low sludge production of only 5 to 20% of that generated by aerobic systems (Masse and Masse, 2000b); the recovery of usable energy in the form of methane; no aeration energy requirement; and no chemical handling. In addition, the biomass can remain unfed for a long period without deteriorating.

Microorganisms are the main parameter in terms of organic matter digestion in biological treatment of water and wastewater. During anaerobic digestion, microbes convert organic compounds into oxidized substances, new cells, energy for their life processes, and some gaseous products, such as methane and carbon dioxide (Reynolds and Richards, 1996) as shown in Reaction (2.1).

(2.1)

The advantages of anaerobic treatment outweigh the advantages of aerobic treatment when treating influents in higher concentrations, and generally, anaerobic treatment requires less energy with potential bioenergy and nutrient recovery. Although anaerobic treatment possesses great advantages, it hardly produces effluents that comply with usual discharge standards established by environmental agencies. In most applications, despite the high efficiency of the anaerobic process, the complete stabilization of the organic matter is impossible anaerobically due to the high organic strength of the wastewater. Thus, the effluents from anaerobic reactors usually need a post-treatment step, in which the removal of organic matter and other constituents, slightly affected by the anaerobic treatment such as nutrients (N/P) and pathogenic organisms, is completed (Chernicharo, 2006). The final effluent produced by the anaerobic treatment usually contains solubilised organic matter, suitable for aerobic treatment, indicating the potential of using anaerobic­aerobic systems (Gray, 2005), where subsequent post-treatment using aerobic treatment is required to meet the effluent discharge standard.

25

2.3.2. Aerobic biological treatment In aerobic digestion, microorganisms degrade organics in the presence of oxygen. One disadvantage of aerobic systems is the generation of large quantities of biological sludge that must be treated before disposal (Bull et al., 1982). High BOD removals have been reported, but effluent TSS concentrations are often elevated due to poor sludge settleability (Johns, 1995). In addition, oxygen requirements and treatment time increase suddenly with wastewater strength. Aerobic treatment could be used for final decontamination and nutrient removal following physicochemical or anaerobic techniques (Van Lier et al., 2001; Chernicharo, 2006). Compared to anaerobic systems, aerobic systems achieve higher removal of soluble biodegradable organic matter and the produced biomass is generally well flocculated, resulting in a lower concentration of suspended solids in the effluent (Grady et al., 1999). As a result, the effluent quality from aerobic systems is generally higher than that of anaerobic systems.

2.3.3. Combined anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment Both anaerobic and aerobic systems are capable of achieving high organic removal efficiencies as shown in Table 2.10. In general, aerobic systems are suitable for the treatment of low strength wastewaters (biodegradable COD concentrations less than 1000 mg/L) while anaerobic systems are suitable for the treatment of high strength wastewaters (biodegradable COD concentrations over 4,000 mg/L).

Anaerobic High Moderate to poor High Low Low High for certain industrial waste Low to moderate High 2­4 months Potential odour problems Yes Essentially pre-treatment

Aggelis et al. (2001) found that neither anaerobic nor aerobic processes could be employed alone for efficient treatment. When treating high organic strength industrial wastewaters, the aerobic or anaerobic treatment alone does not produce effluents that comply with the effluent discharge limit. The use of combined anaerobic-aerobic processes can also lead to a reduction in operating costs when compared with aerobic treatment alone (Vera et al., 1999), while simultaneously resulting in high organic matter removal efficiency and smaller amounts of aerobic sludge without pH correction. Benefits of the combined anaerobic­aerobic processes include a great potential for resource recovery as anaerobic pre-treatment removes most of the organic pollutants and converts them into biogas and a high overall treatment efficiency as aerobic post-treatment polishes the anaerobic effluent and results in very high overall treatment efficiency (Frostell, 1983; Cervantes et al., 2006).

Combined anaerobic-aerobic systems have been also found to perform well for several processes such as biodegradation of chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons including anaerobic dechlorination and aerobic ring cleavage (Supaka et al., 2004); sequential nitrogen removal including aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification (Liu et al., 2008); and anaerobic reduction of Fe (III) and micro-acrophilic oxidation of Fe (II) with production of fine particles of iron hydroxide for adsorption of organic acids, phenols ammonium, cyanide, radionuclides, and heavy metals (Wang, 2005). Combined anaerobic-aerobic systems using high-rate bioreactors, such as upflow anaerobic sludge blankets (UASB), filter bioreactors, fluidized bed reactors and membrane bioreactors, are adopted in order to provide a treatment process that is both technologically and economically viable with the dual goals of resource recovery and compliance with current legislation for effluent discharge. A more intensive form of biodegradation can be also achieved by integrating anaerobic and aerobic zones within a single bioreactor. Essentially, there are four types of integrated anaerobicaerobic bioreactors, which are explained as follows:

1. Integrated bioreactors with physical separation of anaerobic-aerobic zone; 2. Integrated bioreactors without physical separation of anaerobic-aerobic zone; 3. Sequencing batch reactors (SBR) based on temporal separation of the anaerobic and the aerobic phase; and 4. Combined anaerobic­aerobic systems based on the principle of limited oxygen diffusion in microbial biofilms.
27

In recent years, substantial attention has been paid to compact high-rate bioreactors for wastewater treatment to meet the strict constraints with respect to space, odour, and biosolids production (Chan et al., 2009). Thus, integrated bioreactors, which combine aerobic and anaerobic processes in a single reactor, have been seen as a viable alternative. This combination is capable of enhancing the overall degradation efficiency (Tartakovsky et al., 2005). The integrated bioreactors are cost-effective, efficient, and have smaller footprints as compared to other anaerobic­aerobic systems. Nonetheless, the design, operation, and process development of integrated anaerobic­aerobic bioreactors are still emerging (Chan et al., 2009).

2.3.4. Biological modeling Theoretically, the growth of microorganisms is represented by five stages, including the lag phase, exponential growth phase, deceleration phase, stationary phase, and death phase (Reynolds and Richards, 1996). Figure 2.3 shows a typical microbial growth based on biomass concentration.

Organic matter in slaughterhouse wastewater can be represented by TOC and TN due to the multiple organic compounds in the wastewater. Table 2.11 shows the main parameters of the biological treatment together with their calculation methods.

The loading rates have been expressed on a volumetric basis (mg/L.h) instead of an attachment surface basis because there is an important bed of suspended biomass that can stand at the bottom of the reactors, where Vr is the effective volume. Removal of organic matter from methanogenic and anoxic processes has to be calculated from biogas production and concentration of methane and nitrogen, respectively.

Overall nitrogen removal efficiency (%TN) should be calculated from the difference between the feed TN and the nitrogen as ammonia (NH-N) or nitrite and nitrate (NO-N) in the effluent. The nitrification efficiency (%Nn) should be estimated from the TN removal where the nitrogen employed in biomass growth and the released amount in biomass lysis can be ignored.

In cases in which nutrient removal is required to meet the quality standards of the receiving water bodies, the use of anaerobic processes preceding a complementary aerobic treatment for biological nutrient removal should be analyzed. Anaerobic systems present good biodegradable organic matter removal, but not necessarily removal efficiency. This certainly causes a negative effect on biological treatment systems aiming at good nutrient removal. When the purpose of the treatment is also good nitrogen removal, the anaerobic reactor should be used to treat initially only a part of the influent raw sewage (possibly no more than 50­70%), and the remaining part (30­50%) should be directed to the complementary biological treatment, aiming at nitrification and denitrification, so that there is enough organic matter for the denitrification step. In this case, the great advantage in using the anaerobic reactor is to receive and stabilize the sludge generated in the complementary treatment, eliminating the need for an anaerobic sludge digester (Chernicharo, 2006).

Usually biological reactions are modeled by Monod (Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2009; Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011), Haldane (Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2009), two-step Haldane (Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2009), Contois (Mohajerani et al., 2009), and Grau (Mohajerani et al., 2009). The Monod equation has been found as an acceptable and powerful mathematical expression fitted to experimental data described as follows (Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2009):

(2.2)

30

Where X and Xmax are the specific and maximum specific growth rates of microorganisms, KTOC is the half-saturation constant, and TOC is the total organic carbon concentration standing for any limiting organic source. In case of KTOC << TOC, applicable to no inhibition, the Monod equation can be simplified as follows (Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2009):

(2.3)

A cell yield coefficient can be defined based on the TOC consumption and volatile suspended solids (VSS) production during aerobic biochemical degradation and it can be defined as follows (Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2009):

/

(2.4)

Where VSSo and VSS are initial and final concentrations of volatile suspended solids in the bioreactor, and TOCo ­ TOC is the organic consumption during the biological treatment. Equation (2.4) can be also employed based on the utilization of the biodegradable TOC fraction (Mohajerani et al., 2009). The Monod expression can be employed for modeling as shown in Equation (2.5). Consequently, Equation (2.7) can be obtained by considering KTOC << TOC.

Kennedy and Barriault (2007) developed a first order model to describe the substrate concentration driving force within different compartments of an ABR. This model has three major assumptions as follows:

1. The soluble component in an n-compartment ABR as whole is the representative of n-continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) in series; 2. The system would act as one large CSTR where the recycle rate is high compared to the influent flow; and 3. The methane production is the rate-limiting step.

The first order rate constant could be calculated from operational treatment data knowing the substrate concentrations and biomass in each compartment. The mass balance in the first compartment and subsequent i compartments of an n-compartment ABR are presented in Equations (2.10) and (2.11), respectively.

Under steady-state conditions, dS1/dt and dSi/dt = 0, then Equations (2.10) and (2.11) are reduced to Equations (2.12) and (2.13), respectively, which are used to estimate the values of the first order rate coefficient of each compartment. In case of no recycle, rr = 0; thus, Equations (2.12) and (2.13) can be reduced to Equation (2.14):

2.3.5. Nitrification and denitrification Bacteria remove nitrogen from wastewater by two-step biological processes, nitrification followed by denitrification. Technically, it is a three-step process, since ammonification precedes nitrification and denitrification. During ammonification, the majority of the nitrogen contained in raw sewage is converted from organic-nitrogen to ammonia (NH3) through a process called hydrolysis; in common situations, more ammonium (NH4+) than ammonia is created during ammonification, and the actual ratio is influenced by pH and temperature. The biological conversion of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate nitrogen (NO3­) is called nitrification, which is a two-step process. First, Nitrosomonas bacteria convert ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) into nitrite (NO2­). Next, Nitrobacter bacteria finish the conversion of nitrite (NO2­) to nitrate (NO3­). These bacteria, known as nitrifiers, are commonly aerobes, meaning they must have free dissolved oxygen (DO) to perform their work (Zhang et al., 2009). Nitrification occurs only under aerobic conditions at dissolved oxygen levels of 1.0 mg/L or more. At dissolved oxygen concentrations of less than 0.5 mg/L, the growth rate is minimal. The reactions are generally coupled
33

and go rapidly to the nitrate (NO3­) form; therefore, nitrite (NO2­) levels at any given time are usually low (Ward, 1996). The following reactions describe the nitrification process:

(2.15)

(2.16)

Although ammonium ions are used as an energy source by nitrifying bacteria, not all of the ammonium ions taken inside the bacterial cells are nitrified. Some of the ammonium ions are used as a nutrient source for nitrogen and are assimilated into new cellular material (C 5H7O2N). The growth of new cells in the activated sludge process is referred to as an increase in the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) (Gerardi, 2002):

(2.17)

Carbon dioxide (CO2) serves as the carbon source for the synthesis of cellular material, and is available to nitrifying bacteria as bicarbonate alkalinity. This alkalinity is produced when carbon dioxide dissolves in wastewater (Gerardi, 2002). The biological reduction of nitrate (NO3­) to nitrogen gas (N2) by facultative heterotrophic bacteria is called denitrification. Heterotrophic bacteria need a carbon source as food to live. Facultative bacteria can get their oxygen by taking dissolved oxygen out of the water or by taking it off nitrate molecules (Ward, 1996).

Denitrification occurs when oxygen levels are depleted and nitrate becomes the primary oxygen source for microorganisms. The process is performed under anoxic conditions, when the dissolved oxygen concentration is less than 0.5 mg/L, ideally less than 0.2 mg/L (Chen and Lin, 1993). When bacteria break apart nitrate (NO3­) to gain oxygen (O2), the nitrate is reduced to nitrous oxide (N2O), and in turn, to nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrogen gas has low water solubility; therefore, it escapes into the atmosphere as gas bubbles (Zumft, 1997). Free nitrogen is the major component of air; thus, its release does not cause any environmental concern. The reaction pathway of the denitrification generally proceeds through some combination of the intermediates as shown below:
34

( )

(2.18)

Moreover, the complete denitrification process can be expressed as a redox reaction as shown in Reaction (2.19), and generally speaking, the denitrification reaction can be described as shown in Reaction (2.20), where a carbon source (CH3OH) is often required for denitrification to occur.

(2.19)

(2.20)

Since denitrifying bacteria are facultative organisms, they can use either dissolved oxygen or nitrate as an oxygen source for metabolism and oxidation of organic matter. If dissolved oxygen and nitrate are present, bacteria will use the dissolved oxygen first (Zumft, 1997).

2.3.6. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) The use of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can also become an interesting alternative for post-treatment of biologically treated effluents. In this context, conventional biological processes do not always provide satisfactory results, especially for industrial and high-concentrated wastewater since many of the organic substances produced by various industries are toxic or resistant to biological treatment (Steber and Wierich, 1986; Bowers et al., 1989; Adams et al., 1996; Pulgarín and Kiwi, 1996; García et al., 2001; Muñoz and Guieysee, 2006; Lapertot et al., 2006). Therefore, one feasible option for such biologically persistent wastewater is the use of advanced oxidation technologies based on chemical oxidation widely recognized as a highly efficient treatment alternative for recalcitrant wastewater. AOPs degrade organic pollutants by forming hydroxyl radicals (·OH) (Balcioglu et al., 2001; Bhatkhande et al., 2002; Neyens and Baeyens, 2003; Gonze et al., 2003; Sarria et al., 2003; GarcíaMontaño et al., 2006), which are highly reactive and non-selective (Gogate and Pandit, 2004a; Gogate and Pandit, 2004b; Pera-Titus et al., 2007; Devipriyas and Yesodharan, 2005; Pignatello et al., 2006; Comninellis et al., 2008; Shannon et al., 2008). This species can degrade organic matter rapidly in comparison with ordinary chemical oxidation processes that may take months and even years to accomplish this. The fast oxidation, in terms of seconds, of the organic matter by the ·OH species
35

allows the use of the term "advanced" (Bolton and Cotton, 2008) for this kind of process. AOPs include photochemical degradation processes, such as UV/H2O2, UV/O3, and UV/O3/H2O2, in which UV radiation plays a secondary role by initiating the photoreaction in the presence of an auxiliary oxidant to produce ·OH radicals; photocatalytic processes, such as TiO2/UV and photo-Fenton reactors, in which a catalyst plays a secondary role by absorbing UV radiation to produce ·OH radicals; and chemical oxidation, such as O3, O3/H2O2 and H2O2/Fe2+ among others (Tchobanoglous et al., 2003; Oppenländer, 2003).

AOPs are also governed by the same principles as the common chemical processes associated with redox reactions, which involve the exchange of electrons between chemical species, leading to a change in the oxidation state of different compounds taking place in the process (Sawyer et al., 2002). In redox reactions, the compounds gaining electrons are known as oxidizing agents, while compounds losing electrons are known as reducing agents. Thus, ·OH radicals, produced from AOPs, are strong oxidizing agents, which are highly reactive to organic matter.

As McMurray and Fay (2003) show, the exchange of electrons between an oxidant and a reducer is spearheaded by the difference in their standard electrode potential (Eo). ·OH intermediates have one of the highest electrical oxidation potentials (EOP) (2.80V) among all typical chemical oxidizing agents used in water and wastewater treatment technologies as shown in Table 2.12 (Tarr, 2003; Asano et al., 2007; Black and Veatch, 2010).

Furthermore, hydroxyl radicals (·OH), which have a high oxidation potential, attack organic molecules by either abstracting or adding a hydrogen atom to double bonds, thus allowing their mineralization to non-toxic forms such carbon dioxide or water. Studies carried out by Sigge et al. (2002) demonstrated the feasibility of this process in further reducing the TOC contents of anaerobic effluents, when using ozone and ozone/hydrogen peroxide in combination with a granular activated carbon contacting column. In one study, colour and COD reductions ranged from 66 to 90% and from 27 to 55%, respectively (Chernicharo, 2006). In some cases, the mineralization of an organic compound cannot be reached, but the toxicity of the parent compound is reduced and eventually it can be treated by cheaper methods such as biological treatment (Tarr, 2003; Tchobanoglous et al., 2003).

Chemical oxidation for complete mineralization is generally expensive because the oxidation intermediates, formed during treatment, tend to be more and more resistant to their complete chemical degradation. Moreover, they all consume energy (e.g. UV radiation, ozone) and chemical reagents like catalysts and oxidizers, which increase with treatment time (Muñoz et al., 2005). Appropriate techniques must be combined to provide technically and economically feasible options.

In combined chemical and biological wastewater treatment, it is very important to keep in mind how the characteristics of each individual treatment, such as the chemical oxidant to be used (i.e. photo-Fenton or Fenton reagent, O3/H2O2, UV/O3, UV/H2O2, UV/TiO2, etc.) can improve the destruction of a persistent contaminant (Liu et al., 2008; Comninellis et al., 2008; Klavarioti et al., 2009).

The rest of the aspects to be considered are also widely known: the chemical oxidation capacity (Jones et al., 1985; Lee and Carberry, 1992), its potential for forming toxic intermediates (Trgovcich et al., 1983; Bowers et al., 1989; Wang, 1992), a change in pollutant behaviour (Miller et al., 1988; Eckstein, 1994), the choice of biological agent, the comparison of different cultures (Lee and Carberry, 1992), the comparison of acclimated and non-acclimated cultures (Bowers et al., 1989; Hu and Yu, 1994), and the use of monospecific cultures and anaerobic cultures (Koyama et al., 1994; Adams et al., 1994). Measurement of the combined process efficiency depends on the purpose of the treatment, but normally requires the independent optimization of each chemical and biological step (Oller et al., 2011).

2.3.7. UV/H2O2 process H2O2 and O3 are chemical compounds that can be considered as auxiliary oxidants when coupled with UV radiation, usually under the UVC region of the electromagnetic spectrum between 200 to 280 nm as shown in Table 2.13 in order to produce ·OH species. The UV/H2O2 process, one of the most widely AOPs, is an effective technology for industrial wastewater treatment (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004; Aye et al., 2004; Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2009). The degradation and detoxification of pollutants in the UV/H2O2 process rely on highly reactive species, where ·OH are produced from the reaction of the H2O2 with the UV light (Glaze, 1987; Zhou and Smith, 2002; Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2009). The UV/H2O2 process uses ultraviolet radiation to cleave the O­O bond in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and generate hydroxyl radicals. The ·OH can be then scavenged by an organic compound to initiate a radical chain degradation of H2O2 in the series of reactions shown below (Clarke and Knowles, 1982; Glaze, 1987).

The ·OH produced in either way described above may attack organic molecules by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the molecule (Clarke and Knowles, 1982). Carey (1990) described a common pathway for the degradation of organics by the ·OH. As seen in Reaction (2.21), 2 moles of ·OH are produced per quantum of radiation (hv) absorbed; however, there are other reactions to be considered such as the radical-radical recombination as shown in Reaction (2.26), which takes place when the H2O2 concentration is high during the oxidation process, which is responsible for the overall reduction of the efficiency of the process.

(2.26)

A recombination may be avoided by finding the optimum H2O2 concentration inherent to the specific contaminant and system configuration (Oppenländer, 2003). The major photochemical and chemical reactions taking place in the UV/H2O2 process can be described as shown in Table 2.14.

The quantum yield () of a radiation-induced process is the number of times that a defined event occurs per photon absorbed by the system. This event may represent a chemical reaction and be calculable by Equations (2.41) and (2.42) (Shemer et al., 2006). In addition to radical recombination, the UVC/H2O2 process effectiveness is also delayed by the H2O2 low molar absorption coefficient, 18.6/M.cm at 254nm, which is responsible for large amounts of H2O2 being added to produce significant concentrations of ·OH radicals within the system. Moreover, any post-treatment surplus of the H2O2 concentration should be removed from the effluent; otherwise, it could enter source waters, causing negative effects on fish and other living communities (Oppenländer, 2003; Black and Veatch, 2010).

where,  = quantum yield for TOC removal (mol/E); t = time (s); ks() = specific rate of light absorption by TOC (E/mol.s); q0 = incident photon irradiance (E/cm2.s);  = molar absorption coefficient of TOC (1/M.cm);  = absorption coefficient (1/cm); r = nominal radius of the photoreactor (cm); and Ri = inner radius of the photoreactor (cm). Bovine catalase is the most common compound used to remove excess H2O2, which converts H2O2 into water and oxygen, as shown in Reaction (2.43) (Chelikani et al., 2004). In particular, the low molar absorption coefficient and the use of compounds to control the H2O2 concentration in the effluent have a significant impact on the total cost of this AOP process.

For a UV/H2O2 process to be efficient, the H2O2 concentration has to be at an optimal level to maximize the absorption of the incident photons, while the presence of other water compounds that may compete for the absorption of radiation must be minimized. The optimum H2O2 concentration also helps to minimize the recombination mechanisms as well as H2O2 effluent concentration surplus (Barrera, 2011).

The advantages of the UV/H2O2 process include a large range of applications, enhancing the degradation of pollutants, accelerating the rate of oxidation with great potentials for disinfection, and thorough mineralization of pollutants in wastewater (Stefan et al., 1996; Aye et al., 2004; Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004; De Morais and Zamora, 2005; Toor and Mohseni, 2007; Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera, 2011; Barrera et al., 2011). The successful applications of the UV/H2O2 process are shown in various wastewater treatment systems such as textile dye wastewater, with an optimum H2O2 concentration of 15 mM (Aye et al., 2003); atrazine wastewater, with 99% degradation in less than 15 min (Beltrán et al., 1993); linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS) wastewater, with an optimum H2O2 concentration of 5,000 mg/L (Venhuis and Mehrvar, 2005); LAS wastewater in a pilot-plant photoreactor, with an optimum H2O2 concentration of 720 mg/L (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2006); cotton dyeing wastewater containing C.I. Direct Blue 199, with 80% of TOC removal in 2 h (Shu, 2006); and 99.99% of bacteria inactivation in 27.6 seconds (Barrera, 2011; Barrera et al., 2011). Important points should be considered while using the combination technique of UV photolysis with H2O2 for the wastewater treatment as recommended by Gogate and Pandit (2004b), including:

1. The synergism between UV photolysis and H2O2 is beneficial only for the contaminants that require a relatively higher level of oxidation conditions. It should be also noted that though the substrate removal rates are marginally affected, the overall degradation mechanism might be affected to a higher degree. An analysis in terms of COD and/or TOC removal should provide a better picture for the comparison of the efficacy of the hybrid technique as to against the individual technique. 2. The kinetic rate constants for the degradation process are observed to be inversely proportional to the initial concentration of the pollutant and hence dilution of the effluent stream should be done at an optimum level. It should be also noted that the net removal of the pollutant will be also dependent on the driving force available for the reaction and hence the exact dependency should be established with laboratory scale studies. On the other hand, it may even be observed at times
41

that absolutely no reduction in TOC is detected even for the combination technique. In such cases, a dilution factor of 10­15 may be also required before obtaining any appreciable degree of mineralization. For such cases, this method should only be used as a pre-treatment stage followed by biological oxidation or new hybrid methods consisting of additional oxidants, e.g. Fenton's reagent should be devised. 3. The concentration of H2O2 also needs to be properly selected. Usually, there is an optimum concentration, beyond which the presence of H2O2 is detrimental to the degradation reaction due to the scavenging action. Tanaka et al. (1989a; 1989b) reported that an optimum concentration of H2O2 is 0.01 M for the degradation of various organohalide compounds. Beltrán et al. (1993) have also reported an optimum concentration of H2O2 as 0.01 M for the degradation of atrazine. Wang and Hong (1999) reported that the photocatalytic degradation of 2-chlorobiphenyl in the presence of H2O2 is strongly inhibited above a particular concentration of H2O2 (0.1 M). The magnitude of the optimum H2O2 concentration depends on the level and type of the pollutants in the effluent stream, i.e., on the kinetic rate constant for the reaction between the free radicals and the pollutant and the rate constant for the recombination reaction. The optimum concentration of the H2O2 may be established using laboratory studies for the pollutant in question unless data are available in the literature with similar operating conditions. 4. A lower operating pH (in the range 2.5­3.5) is usually preferred for the combination technique of UV photolysis coupled with H2O2 and the exact value is dependent on the pH values for the contaminants in question. It should be noted here that the intrinsic rates of the UV/H2O2 process may not be affected much, but at a lower operating pH, the effect of the radical scavengers, especially ionic ones such as carbonate and bicarbonate ions, would be nullified leading to higher overall rates of degradation. Thus, it is better to have a lower operating pH. Mehrvar et al. (2001) explained the effect of ·OH scavenging, where the presence of some inorganic impurities may affect the photocatalytic destruction of organics in water and wastewater, since these anions scavenge hydroxyl radicals, which are responsible for attacking organics. Carbonate and bicarbonate ions are well known as hydroxyl radical scavengers, while phosphates, sulphates, and nitrates may also be present in the wastewater. Carbonate and bicarbonate ions react with hydroxyl radicals to produce carbonate radical ions as shown in Reaction (2.44) and (2.45). Moreover, decay of these carbonate radical ions might occur through Reaction (2.46) or (2.47).

5. The presence of radical scavengers is a crucial factor in deciding the overall efficiency of the process. Usually, there is an optimum concentration of the radical scavengers, below which the reduction in the rates of degradation is marginal. Cater (2000) reported that the optimum concentration of radical scavengers such as benzene, toluene, and xylene is 2 mg/L for the degradation of methyl tert-butyl ether; whereas, Ku et al. (1998) reported that humic acid strongly inhibits the degradation reaction only above the concentration of 8 mg/L. On the other hand, carbonate and bicarbonate ions inhibit the reaction even at lower concentrations (1­2 mg/L). Therefore, the optimum value of the concentration of radical scavengers is dependent on the pollutant-radical scavenger system, more specifically on the rate constant for the reactions between the pollutant-free radicals and scavenger-free radicals. 6. The presence of compounds such as humic acid, which results in strong absorption of incident UV light, is another factor that needs to be considered while adjusting the dose of H2O2. If these chemicals are present in the effluent stream, a higher dosage of H2O2 is required to achieve the synergistic effect. 7. Kinetic modeling of the degradation process is the key point in the effective design of photoreactors. A most realistic reaction model should consider all the chemical and photochemical reactions, the number may be even above 50­100, including the effects of the presence of radical scavengers and should be as rigorous as possible due to the observed major influence of other minor components.

The work of Crittenden et al. (1999) should serve as a useful guideline in developing realistic models for the prediction of overall rates in the degradation process. They have developed a kinetic model considering 44 different reactions using the reported kinetic rate constants and they have reported that the model fits the experimental results of 1,2-dibromo, 3-chloropropane degradation better as compared to the earlier model by Glaze et al. (1995) based on the pseudo-steady state
43

assumption, where net accumulation of free radicals is zero. According to Gogate and Pandit (2004b), the most realistic point in the developed model is the consideration of changing pH with time, considered for the first time. Usually operating pH is important in deciding the rates of reaction and it changes as the reaction proceeds.

Therefore, future work should be directed in developing realistic kinetic models and in establishing the optimum conditions for an H2O2 dose, the concentration of radical scavengers, and the pH for a variety of contaminants and mixtures. If the pertinent information is not available in the existing literature, laboratory scale studies with near identical geometric and operating conditions are recommended with the real effluents in question.

According to Bolton et al. (2001), the overall kinetics in terms of the rate of removal of a specific component, including TOC, can often be described by simple rate expressions that are either zero-order or first-order. In general, most processes involved in AOPs, such as UV/H2O2, can be modeled by the following simple mechanisms:

(2.48)

-, -, -

(2.49)

(2.50)

where, R1 = reaction rate of ·OH (mg/L.h); R2 = reaction rate of ·OH with TOC (mg/L.h); R3 = reaction rate of ·OH with a scavenger (Si) (mg/L.h);  = constant that depends on the type of AOP (mg/h.W) p = power rating for the system (W); VT = treated SSWW volume (L); Si = a scavenger for the ·OH, where i = a, b, ..., n (mg/L); and kTOC and kSi = second-order rate constants (L/mg.h).

44

A steady-state analysis of this general mechanism yields the following overall rate kinetic for the UV/H2O2 process as shown in Equation (2.51). This simple mechanism is either zero- or firstorder for TOC, if the concentration of TOC is high, ( ,  ,  , -), the reaction rate will

be zero-order in TOC as shown in Equation (2.52). On the other hand, if the concentration of TOC is low, ( , -), the reaction rate will be first-order in TOC as shown in Equation

(2.53). The difference between "high" and "low" concentration varies considerably with the system but is often approximately 100 mg/L (Bolton et al., 2001).

2.4. Need for combined biological treatment and advanced oxidation processes AOPs are becoming more appealing to serve as complementary treatment in either pretreatment or post-treatment for current biological processes. Additionally, AOPs may inactivate bacteria without adding any additional chemicals to the wastewater in comparison to other techniques such as chlorination or ozonation processes that are commonly used in disinfection of water streams; thus, avoiding the possible formation of hazardous by-products (Tchobanoglous et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2006).

Meat processing industry effluents are included as a part of food industry wastewaters, and they constitute one of the greatest concerns of the agro-industrial sector due to the high amounts of water used in the process of slaughtering and further cleaning of the facility, approximately 62×106 m3/year of water is consumed worldwide (de Sena et al., 2009; Oller et al., 2011). Nevertheless, only a small amount becomes a component of the final effluent; the remaining part has high biological and chemical oxygen demands, high fat content and high concentrations of dry waste, sediments and total suspended matter as well as nutrients (Masse and Masse, 2000b; Sroka et al., 2004; Debik and Coskun, 2009). AOPs have recently come into use for elimination and degradation, water reuse and
45

pollution control issues showing excellent overall results (Cao, 2009; de Sena et al., 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera, 2011; Barrera et al., 2011).

Further chemical oxidation in combined oxidation followed by biodegradation systems may not lead to any significant change in the molecular weight distribution. Hence, it is reasonable for preoxidation to be as short as possible and remove the biodegradable portion by cost-effective biological processes. Nonetheless, the amount of COD removable with this strategy may be limited, making use of longer oxidation necessary and the following biological process redundant (Poole, 2004). Internal recycling between the oxidation and biological stage has been recommended for reducing the chemical dose in such circumstances (Libra and Sosath, 2003).

If the original wastewater contains considerable amounts of biodegradable compounds, the pre-oxidation step obviously will not lead to a significant improvement of biodegradability; rather, it will only cause unnecessary consumption of chemicals (Oller et al., 2011). In such cases, a biological pre-treatment, removing biodegradable compounds, followed by an AOP, converting the nonbiodegradable portion into biodegradable compounds with less chemical consumption is called for (Hörsch et al., 2003; Vidal et al., 2004). Such combined systems are particularly favourable for effluents such as olive mill wastewater or landfill leachates, which initially contain some biodegradable fractions (i.e. sugars and proteins) which could easily be removed first and so, not compete for the chemical oxidant.

A recent study by Cao (2009) found that the combined processes of ABR and UV/H2O2 photoreactor are highly efficient for the treatment of SSWW at a laboratory scale, with maximum TOC, COD, and CBOD5 removal efficiencies of 89.9, 97.7, and 96.6%, respectively, for an influent TOC concentration of 973.3 mg/L at a HRT of 3.8 days in the ABR compartments (Cao 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011). However, the results showed that the TN concentrations in the combined processes had no significant changes (no more than 6% change); thus, the combined processes were not able to remove TN from the wastewater effectively. Furthermore, there was no evidence to show sequential nitrogen removal including aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification. In summary, for the biological removal of nutrients (N and P), an adequate combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes is essential. An overview of the most frequently applied technologies and combined reactors is outlined in Table 2.15, with specific attention to the evaluation of their treatment efficiencies in terms of organic removal.

2.5. Concluding remarks It may be stated that it is operationally and economically advantageous to adopt anaerobic­ aerobic processes in the treatment of high strength industrial wastewaters since it couples the benefit of anaerobic digestion in high-strength wastewater with the benefits of aerobic digestion with better COD and VSS removal (Ros and Zupancic, 2004), as well as using AOPs such as UV/H2O2 as a posttreatment alternative.

This chapter has shown several examples of combined biological and photochemical treatment, including the studies by Cao (2009), Wang et al. (2009b) and Cao and Mehrvar (2011), who investigated the treatment of industrial wastewater using a combined photo-oxidation and biological treatment with a higher rate of TOC removal as compared with other processes, reaching removal rates of COD, TOC, BOD, and TN up to 95, 96, 99 and 80%, respectively, as well as the complete disinfection and bacterial inactivation completed by the photochemical process as a posttreatment stage (Barrera, 2011; Barrera et al., 2011). Therefore, a combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 system was chosen for the treatment of SSWW in this study. Results obtained from this work will help to extend the information on the combined biological and AOPs process, its performance and effectiveness in removing TOC, TN, and BOD from slaughterhouse wastewater.

CHAPTER 3 MATERIALS AND METHODS
3.1. Introduction This study is focused on determining the performance and the treatment ability of the ABR, the aerobic AS, and the UV/H2O2 processes, as well as their combination for the removal of TOC, TN, and BOD from synthetic SSWW. To that end, experiments were conducted in order to assess the efficiencies and performance of such processes. The study consists of different configurations of the combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes for the treatment of SSWW, interchanging their order for obtaining more information that is accurate about the behaviour of each configuration in the treatment of SSWW. In this chapter, an overall description of the research approach, materials, and procedures is presented.

3.2. Materials 3.2.1. Synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater (SSWW) The wastewater in this study was the SSWW, prepared in accordance with the previous studies (Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera, 2011; Barrera et al., 2011), and based on the recipe developed by Stephenson and Lester (1986) in order to compare the main differences between the results found in the new configurations and those of the previous studies. The SSWW contains (Table 3.1) commercial meat extract powder (Oxoid Lab Lemco L0029, Oxoid Ltd.), whose components are listed in Table 3.2; glycerol (C3H8O3); ammonium chloride (NH4Cl); sodium chloride (NaCl); potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH2PO4); calcium chloride (CaCl2); and magnesium sulphate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O). The pH values and the concentrations of TOC, TN, and CBOD5 were measured to investigate the characteristics of the SSWW and these were compared against the results found in the open literature. A hydrogen peroxide solution (1,110 g/L density) containing 30%w/w of H2O2 was used in the UV/H2O2 process.

3.2.2. Anaerobic and aerobic inoculum The anaerobic and aerobic sludge seeds (37,500 mgSS/L) were obtained from the Ashbridges Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant, a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Toronto, Ontario,
54

Canada. A total of 10 L of the anaerobic sludge seed was loaded into the ABR (about 2 L in each compartment) whereas, 5 L of the aerobic sludge seed were loaded into the aerobic AS reactor. The inoculum (2.5 gVSS/L) in the compartments was acclimatized to the SSWW by feeding the wastewater continuously into the reactors. Excess of the supply of sludge was stored in a closed container and fed by SSWW periodically at room temperature for future usage.

3.3. Experimental setup Combined processes consisted of two stages: a biological process using an ABR and a UV/H2O2 process developed by Cao and Mehrvar (2009, 2011) as shown in Figure 3.1. Considering the relatively high biodegradability of the SSWW, the ABR is placed before the UV photoreactor.

The ABR consists of 5 equal-volume compartments with individual gas headspaces. Each compartment is further divided into two small chambers (2 and 8 cm in width, respectively) by a 45° slanted edge baffle leading to downflow and upflow of the wastewater, which provided effective mixing and contact time between the wastewater and the biomass within each compartment (Kuçu and Sponza, 2006; Uyanik et al., 2002). No additional mixing was supplied in all compartments. The total working volume of the ABR was 33.7 L (total of 50, 15, and 50 cm of length, width, and height, respectively). The wastewater sampling ports were located 40 cm from the bottom of each compartment and 4 cm from the side of its slanted edge baffle, while the sludge sampling ports were located at 10 cm from the bottom of each compartment and 4 cm from the side of its slanted edge baffle. The stainless steel UV photoreactor (Siemens ­ Wallace & Tiernan® UV Disinfection Systems, Barrier® SL-1S) had a total working volume of 1.35 L (8 cm external diameter and 34 cm length). A UV lamp (output power: 6 W, wavelength: 254 nm, and diameter: 2.5 cm) was inserted into the center of the cylindrical photoreactor. The UV lamp was covered by a quartz sleeve in order to protect the lamp from fouling that may interfere with the UV radiation emission. Figure 3.2 shows the schematic diagram of the UV photoreactor.

In order to optimize the combined ABR and UV/H2O2 process for wastewater treatment in previous studies (Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011), it was proposed that an aerobic stage be located after the anaerobic process and before the post-treatment by UV/H2O2 as shown in Figures 3.3 and 3.4. An aerobic reactor was proposed to operate at a constant flow rate of 10.51 mL/min under HRT of 7 days. The aerobic reactor had an effective volume of 12 L. For the easy build-up of nitrifying bacteria in the bioreactor, no sludge should be discharged and a DO concentration must be maintained over 2.0 mg/L. The internal recycle ratio was recommended to be in the range of 100­ 300% of influent flow rate for the denitrification of oxidized nitrogen as suggested by Ahn et al. (2007). Different configurations were also designed in order to observe the performance of the system by varying the number of stages and their order, and thus determine the most effective alternative for the treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater by means of a cost-effective method as shown in Figures 3.5 to 3.10; where, the blue color indicates the flow direction of wastewater, the red color indicates the anaerobic process, the green color indicates the aerobic process, and the purple color indicates the photochemical process.

3.4. Experimental procedure 3.4.1. Acclimatization of the inoculum The ABR was filled with 10 L of an anaerobic sludge seed (37,500 mgSS/L), using 2 L of the inoculum for each of the 5 compartments, approximately 1/3 of the total working volume of each compartment; whereas, 5 L of an aerobic sludge seed was loaded into the aerobic AS reactor. The inoculum (2.5 gVSS/L) was acclimatized by feeding the SSWW continuously into the reactors at a constant flow rate of 5.25 mL/min. During the 60-day acclimatization, the influent concentration was gradually increased from 20, 40, 60, and 80 to 100% of the raw SSWW, and then the system was inoculated with 10 ­ 20 gVSS/L. The concentration of SSWW was increased from 20 to 40%, from 40 to 60%, from 60 to 80%, and from 80 to 100% on the 16th, 24th, 30th, and 42nd day, respectively.

Samples were collected from every compartment during the acclimatization to measure their TSS and VSS concentrations. These parameters were used to observe the growth of microorganisms and to confirm the acclimatization process. On the other hand, if any washout was observed in the effluent of the reactors, the sludge should be removed in order to prevent an increase of TSS in the wastewater, which can result in a reduction of the efficiency and will require further post-treatment.

3.4.2. ABR process After 60 days of acclimatization period, the ABR was run alone (Figure 3.5) using 5 different influent concentrations of the SSWW at various flow rates in the range of 2.93 to 11.70 mL/min, HRT of 2 to 8 days, TOC loading rates of 0.03­1.01 g/(L.day), and TN loading rates of 0.01­0.19 g/(L.day).

As shown in Figure 3.5, the SSWW was homogenized by a recirculating pump (18). The ABR (5) was fed continuously from a feed tank (1) using the peristaltic pump (Blue-White Industries Ltd. Flexflo A-100NV) (2). The SSWW was passed through an acrylic flow meter (Omega FL-2018) (3) in order to measure the flow rate. The flow was then directed to the ABR using the 3-way valve (4) and flowed downwards and upwards within the five compartments of the ABR. Those compartments contained an anaerobic sludge layer (9) where the biological degradation occurs. Each compartment had a sludge sampling port (7), located 10 cm from the base of the ABR and 4 cm from the side of the 45° slanted edge baffle, to measure TSS and VSS. SSWW sampling ports (8) were located 40 cm from the base of the ABR and 4 cm from the side of the 45° slanted edge baffle. SSWW treated in the ABR was either discharged into a collection tank (14) or flowed into another reactor for posttreatment by means of the 3-way valve (10).

SSWW samples were taken by gravity from every compartment. When collecting samples, the first 10 mL were eliminated to avoid the effect of the sampling ports; then, volumes of 30 mL were collected from each SSWW sampling port and were diluted to reach 1/3 of their concentrations in order to measure temperature, pH, DO, TOC, TN, CBOD5, TSS, and VSS. Sludge samples were also collected from the sludge sampling ports in order to measure TSS and VSS.

3.4.3. Aerobic AS process The aerobic AS process was run alone (Figure 3.6) using five different influent concentrations of the SSWW at various flow rates in the range of 2.93 to 11.70 mL/min, HRT of 2 to 8 days, TOC loading rates of 0.03­1.01 g/(L.day), and TN loading rates of 0.01­0.19 g/(L.day). As shown in Figure 3.6, the SSWW was homogenized by a recirculating pump (18). The aerobic AS reactor (21) was fed continuously from a feed tank (1) using the peristaltic pump (2). The SSWW was passed through an acrylic flow meter (3). The flow was directed to the aerobic AS reactor using the 3-way
67

valve (4) and flowed into the aeration tank, where oxygen was introduced by a diffuser at a constant flow rate of 500 mL/min (23) followed by a clarifier. The SSWW treated in the aerobic AS reactor was either discharged into a collection tank (14) or flowed into another reactor for post-treatment due by means of the 2-way valves (33) and (24).

SSWW samples were taken from the aeration tank and the clarifier. Volumes of 30 mL were collected from each stage and diluted to reach 1/3 of their concentrations in order to measure temperature, pH, DO, TOC, TN, CBOD5, TSS, and VSS.

3.4.3. UV/H2O2 process The UV/H2O2 process was run alone (Figure 3.7), using 3 different influent concentrations (5, 10 and 25%) of the SSWW at various flow rates in the range of 2.93 to 11.70 mL/min, HRT in the range from 30 to 180 min, TOC concentrations of 57.59­140.91 mg/L, and H2O2 concentrations of 0, 100, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500 and 2000 mg/L.

As shown in Figure 3.7, the SSWW was homogenized by a recirculating pump (18). The UV photoreactor (12) was fed continuously from a feed tank (1) using the peristaltic pump (2). The SSWW was passed through an acrylic flow meter (3). The flow was directed to the UV photoreactor using the 3-way valve (4) and flowed into the UV photoreactor, where H2O2 was introduced from a H2O2 solution container (15) using a flow rate control valve (16). The SSWW treated in the UV photoreactor was either discharged into a collection tank (14) or flowed into another reactor for posttreatment due to the 2-way valve (25).

An experiment without UV irradiation, called the dark experiment, was also conducted to evaluate the possible adsorption of organic compounds on the UV photoreactor walls using H2O2 concentrations of 0, 600, and 1200 mg/L. SSWW samples were taken from the UV photoreactor effluent. Volumes of 30 mL were collected from each stage and were diluted to reach 1/3 of its concentrations and to measure temperature, pH, DO, TOC, TN, and CBOD5. Two replicates were made for every analytical measurement. Catalase was required to eliminate H2O2 from the samples during CBOD5 measurement for accurate results. It catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 to water and oxygen as expressed in Section 2.3.7. Experiments using a batch recirculation mode (Figure 3.11) were also conducted in order to evaluate the optimum H2O2 dosage and the molar ratio of
68

[H2O2]/[TOC]. Different inlet concentrations of H2O2 (0, 100, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, and 2000 mg/L), SSWW (64.88, 163.69, and 349.84 mgTOC/L), and HRT (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min) were studied.

3.4.4. Combined anaerobic-aerobic processes Combined processes of the ABR and the aerobic AS (Figure 3.8) were run using various flow rates of 3.75 to 7.50 mL/min, HRT of 3.12 to 6.24 days, TOC loading rates of 0.16­0.32g/(L.day), and TN loading rates of 0.07­0.14 g/(L.day). As shown in Figure 3.8, the SSWW was homogenized by a recirculating pump (18). The ABR (5) was fed continuously from a feed tank (1) using the peristaltic pump (2). The SSWW was passed through an acrylic flow meter (3). The flow was then directed to the ABR using the 3-way valve (4) and flowed downwards and upwards within the 5 compartments of the ABR. Those compartments contained an anaerobic sludge layer (9) where the biological degradation occurs. Each compartment had a sludge sampling port (7), located 10 cm from the base of the ABR and 4 cm from the side of the 45° slanted edge baffle, to measure TSS and VSS. The SSWW sampling ports (8) were located 40 cm from the base of the ABR and 4 cm from the side of the 45° slanted edge baffle. The treated SSWW in the ABR was flowed into the aerobic AS reactor for post-treatment using a 3-way valve (10) and flowed into the aeration tank, where oxygen was introduced by a diffuser at a constant flow rate of 500 mL/min (23) followed by a clarifier. The treated SSWW was then discharged into a collection tank (14). SSWW samples were taken similarly to the previous processes. In addition, an experiment was conducted with recycling mode, in which the SSWW treated in the aerobic AS reactor was recycled into the ABR using the 2-way valve (33).

3.4.5. Combined aerobic-anaerobic processes Experiments for the aerobic AS and ABR combined processes (Figure 3.9) were conducted using similar operating conditions as other processes. As shown in Figure 3.9, the SSWW was homogenized by a recirculating pump (18). The ABR (5) was fed continuously from a feed tank (1) using the peristaltic pump (2). The SSWW was passed through an acrylic flow meter (3). The flow was then directed to the aerobic AS reactor using the 3-way valve (4) and flowed into the aeration tank, where oxygen was introduced by a diffuser at a constant flow rate of 500 mL/min (23) followed by a clarifier. The treated SSWW was then directed into the ABR for post-treatment using the 3-way valve (33) and flowed downwards and upwards within the compartments of the ABR.

Those compartments contained an anaerobic sludge layer (9) where the biological degradation occurs and each compartment had a sludge sampling port (7), located 10 cm from the base of the ABR and 4 cm from the side of the 45° slanted edge baffle, to measure TSS and VSS. SSWW sampling ports (8) were located 40 cm from the base of the ABR and 4 cm from the side of the 45° slanted edge baffle. The treated SSWW was discharged into a collection tank (14). SSWW samples were taken similarly to the previous processes.

3.4.6. Combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes Experiments for combined processes of the ABR, the aerobic AS, and UV/H2O2 (Figure 3.10) were conducted at various flow rates of 5.90 to 7.50 mL/min, HRT of 3.15 to 4.00 days, TOC of 941.19­1,006.90 mg/L, and TN of 200.03­214.08 mg/L.

As shown in Figure 3.10, the SSWW was homogenized by a recirculating pump (18). The ABR (5) was fed continuously from a feed tank (1) using the peristaltic pump (2). The SSWW was passed through an acrylic flow meter (3) in order to measure the flow rate. The flow was then directed to the ABR using the 3-way valve (4) and flowed downwards and upwards within the compartments of the ABR. Those compartments contained an anaerobic sludge layer (9) where the biological degradation occurs. Each compartment had a sludge sampling port (7), located 10 cm from the base of the ABR and 4 cm from the side of the 45° slanted edge baffle, to measure TSS and VSS. SSWW sampling ports (8) were located 40 cm from the base of the ABR and 4 cm from the side of the 45° slanted edge baffle. The treated SSWW in the ABR flowed into the aerobic AS reactor for posttreatment by means of the 3-way valve (10) and flowed into the aeration tank, where oxygen was introduced by a diffuser at a constant flow rate of 500 mL/min (23) followed by a clarifier. The treated SSWW was directed to the UV photoreactor using the 3-way valve (24) and flowed into the UV photoreactor, where H2O2 was introduced from a H2O2 solution container (15) using a flow rate control valve (16). SSWW treated in the UV photoreactor was discharged into a collection tank (14). SSWW samples were taken similarly to the previous processes.

In combined processes, there is a relationship between the HRT and the volume of each reactor. Considering the flow rate of the H2O2 negligible, this relationship can be represented by Equation (3.1).

71

(3.1)

where, VABR = volume of the ABR (L); VAS = volume of the aerobic AS reactor (L); VUV = volume of the UV photoreactor (L); HRTABR = hydraulic retention time of the ABR process (h); HRTAS = hydraulic retention time of the aerobic AS process (h); and HRTUV = hydraulic retention time of the UV/H2O2 process (h).

3.5. Analytical techniques Different parameters of the SSWW were measured, including temperature, pH, DO, TSS, VSS, TOC, TN, and CBOD5 according to the Standard Methods (APHA, 1998). The details of each analytical technique are explained in the following sections.

3.5.1. Dissolved oxygen (DO) DO of influent and effluent samples of the SSWW was measured by a dissolved oxygen meter (YSI 58 Dissolved Oxygen Meter) equipped with a BOD bottle probe (YSI 5905 BOD Probe), where the DO was displayed in mg/L (1 mg/L = 1 ppm) or in percent air saturation. The DO meter was calibrated using air-saturated water, obtained by aerating water for at least 15 min at a constant temperature, using the calibration by temperature measurement function of the DO meter.

3.5.2. Temperature and pH Temperature and pH of influent and effluent samples of the slaughterhouse wastewater were measured by a portable pH and pH/ISE meter (Thermo Orion 230A+). This instrument has a pH resolution of 0.01, a pH accuracy of ±0.02, a temperature range of -5.0 to 105.0°C, a temperature resolution of 0.1°C, and a temperature accuracy of ±1.0°C. The pH meter was calibrated using either a pH 4.01 and 7.00 buffer solution or a 7.00 and 10.01 buffer solution, depending on the expected sample range, at room temperature.

72

3.5.3. Total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) TSS and VSS of the anaerobic sludge, MLSS and MLVSS of the aerobic sludge, and the SSWW effluent of each reactor were measured according to sections 2540D and 2540E of Standard Methods (APHA, 1998) to observe the growth of microorganisms in the reactors or to assess whether the effluent solids concentrations reached a disposal level as shown in Table 2.8.

For TSS and MLSS, filter papers and aluminum weighing dishes were dried in an oven (Binder Oven FED 53) at 105°C for 1 h. 5 to 10 mL of well-mixed sludge samples were separately filtered by weighed filter papers using a Buchner funnel connected to a vacuum system. Then, each of the filter papers were transferred to one weighed and dried aluminum-weighing dish. Combinations of dishes, sludge samples, and filter papers were heated in the oven at 105°C for 1 h. After cooling in a desiccator, they were weighed again. The TSS and the MLSS could be determined by Equation (3.2).

(3.2)

where, W1 = sum of the weights of the dried filter paper, dish and solids of the sample (mg); W2 = weight of the dried filter paper (mg); W3 = weight of the dried dish (mg); and V = volume of the sample (L).

To determine the VSS and the MLVSS concentrations, the combinations of dishes, sludge samples, and filter papers (after drying in the oven) were burned in a furnace (Thermo Scientific Lindberg® Blue M® Muffle Furnace) at 550°C for 15 min. After cooling in a desiccator, they were also weighed. VSS and MLVSS could be determined by Equation (3.3), where W4 is the sum of the weights of the solids of the sample and the dish after burning (mg).

3.5.4. Total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) TOC and TN were measured by a Teledyne Tekmar Apollo 9000 Combustion TOC/TN Analyzer equipped with an automated sampler. Before sample analyses, the TOC/TN analyzer was calibrated, samples were diluted to reach 1/3 of their concentration, and they were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min (Thermo Scientific Heraeus Multifuge X1). Standards were prepared by adding a carbon source or a nitrogen source to distilled water to achieve determined levels of carbon or nitrogen. The reagent solutions were prepared as follows:

1. Potassium nitrate (KNO3) was used as a nitrogen source for TN calibration. The KNO3 was dried in the oven at 80°C and cooled in the desiccator; then, 7.22 g of it was dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1 L in order to prepare 1,000 mg/L of stock standard solution. A series of working standard solutions covering the expected range of sample concentrations, such as 1­20 mg/L, were prepared by accurately diluting the 1,000 mg/L of stock standard solution with distilled water. Through running TN standard calibration analysis, a TN calibration curve for the range 1­ 20 mg/L was obtained for analyzing TN concentrations (Figure 3.12). 2. Potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) was used as an organic carbon source for TOC calibration. The KHP was dried in an oven at 105°C for 2 h prior to the preparation of stock standard solution and stored in a desiccator. For preparation of a 1,000 mg/L of KHP stock standard solution, an accurate 2,125 mg of KHP was dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1 L. A series of standard solutions, covering the expected range of sample concentrations, such as 1­400 mg/L, was prepared by accurately diluting the 1,000 mg/L of stock standard solution with distilled water. Through running TOC standard calibration analysis, a TOC calibration curve for the range 1­400 mg/L was obtained for analyzing TOC concentrations (Figure 3.13). Thus, TOC removal efficiency was determined by Equation (3.4).

3.5.5. 5-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) The analysis of the CBOD5 was carried out according to Section 5210B of Standard Methods (APHA, 1998). A solution, which is called a dilution solution in Standard Methods 5210B, contains the reagents of phosphate buffer solution, magnesium sulphate solution, calcium chloride solution, and ferric chloride solution. Other reagents used for CBOD5 testing include acid and alkali solutions, nitrification inhibitor, and glucose-glutamic acid solution. All solutions, including phosphate buffer, magnesium sulphate, calcium chloride, and ferric chloride were prepared as follows and stored in a refrigerator at 4°C after preparation. Phosphate buffer: 8.5 g KH2PO4, 21.75 g K2HPO4, 33.4 g Na2HPO4·7H2O, and 1.7 g NH4Cl were dissolved in 500 mL of distilled water and diluted to 1 L. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 using 1 N sulphuric acid or 1 N sodium hydroxide solution. Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate solution (22.5 g MgSO4·7H2O) was dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1 L. Calcium chloride solution (27.5 g CaCl2) was dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1 L. Ferric chloride solution (0.25 g FeC13·6H2O) was dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1 L. 0.16 g of nitrification inhibitor (2-chloro-6-trichloromethyl pyridine; Hach Co., Formula 2533) was added to each BOD bottle.

For the glucose-glutamic acid (GGA) solution, reagent grade glucose and reagent grade glutamic acid were dried at 103°C for 1 h. 150 mg glucose and 150 mg glutamic acid were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1 L. Because the BOD test is a bioassay, its results may be greatly influenced by the presence of toxicants when using of a poor seeding material. Distilled waters frequently are contaminated with copper. Therefore, it is necessary to check dilution water quality, seed effectiveness, and analytical techniques periodically. Glucose-glutamic acid standard (GGA) was used to achieve this work. The GGA solution was prepared fresh immediately before use. For the dilution water, ten liters of solution were prepared each time as follows: 1 mL of each phosphate buffer, magnesium sulphate, calcium chloride, and ferric chloride per liter of distilled water were added in a 20 L container. Then, dilution water was placed in an incubator for at least 24 h at 20°C and was aerated by oxygen or pure air for 1 h before use. One capsule of commercial Polyseed® was added into 500 mL distilled water to prepare Polyseed® solution, which must be aerated by pure air for 30 min and then settled for 15 min before use. Three to 6 mL of one sample of the SSWW, 2 mL aerated Polyseed® solution, and 0.16 g nitrification inhibitor were added into one well-cleaned 300 mL BOD bottle.

77

Two blanks were prepared by filling with aerated dilution water to check the quality of unseeded dilution water and the cleanliness of the BOD bottles roughly. Three seed controls had to be prepared by adding 10, 15, and 20 mL of Polyseed® solution into separate 300 mL BOD bottles. Two GGA standards were prepared by adding 6 mL GGA solution and 4 mL aerated Polyseed® solution into each BOD bottle. A magnetic stirrer bar, which is used to stir the solution in the BOD bottle to make it homogenous during BODs measurement, was placed in each bottle and then all BOD bottles were filled with the aerated dilution water up to the middle of the bottle's neck.

Initial DOs of all samples including wastewater samples, the blanks, the seed controls, and the GGA standards were first measured by a BOD bottle probe connected to an YSI 58 DO meter with sample agitation before incubating. All BOD bottles were incubated in the incubator at 20°C for 5 days. The 5-day DOs of all samples were measured and their CBOD5 calculated by Equations (3.5) and (3.6). %CBOD5 removal efficiency was determined by Equation (3.7).

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1. Introduction This chapter presents the results of the experimental work, the characteristics of the SSWW, the performance and the treatment ability of the ABR, the aerobic AS, and the UV/H2O2 processes, as well as their combination in the removal of TOC, TN, and BOD from SSWW. This is followed by the discussion of the optimum H2O2 dosage and the molar ratio of [H2O2]/[TOC] for the UV/H2O2 process obtained under specific operating conditions discussed in the material and methods chapter, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis to present the best alternative among the different configurations evaluated during this study.

4.2. Common characteristics of the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater (SSWW) General characteristics, which remained without significant changes, of the SSWW used during the experiments are shown in this section, including Reynolds number, temperature, pH, DO, TSS, and VSS.

4.2.1. Reynolds number The Reynolds number for all the processes, including the ABR, the aerobic AS, the UV/H2O2, and their combination, remained lower than 2,000; thus, laminar flow was the common regime.

4.2.2. Dissolved oxygen (DO) The DO concentration of the untreated SSWW remained in the range of 8.48 to 8.50 mg/L. In the enclosed feed tank, the DO concentration decreased to 0.5­1.3mg/L. After acclimatization, the DO values within each compartment (1 to 5) of the ABR were in the ranges of 0.2­1.1, 0.3­1.0, 0.4­ 1.2, 0.2­1.0, and 0.2­1.0 mg/L, respectively. Inside the aeration tank, DO values were in the range of 0.4­3.2 mg/L; and within the UV/H2O2, DO values were in the range of 1.4­4.1 mg/L. DO values in the reactors are illustrated in Figure 4.1; error bars represent standard deviations.

4.2.3. Temperature and pH Figure 4.2 shows the profile of the pH evolution of the SSWW in the ABR, aerobic AS, and UV/H2O2 reactors. The SSWW influent pH values were in the range of 6.82 to 6.92. During the acclimatization of the sludge, pH values for the biological reactors were fluctuating drastically. This may be attributed to the growth and metabolism of the microorganisms, where pH values within the ABR chambers (1 to 5) were in the ranges of 6.46­7.00, 6.05­6.97, 6.01­7.06, 6.52­7.21, 6.50­7.21, 5.78­7.85, and 6.18­6.20, respectively; and pH values in the aerobic AS aeration tank were in the range of 5.78­7.85.

In contrast, pH values during experiments within the 5 chambers of the ABR were in the ranges of 6.70­6.82, 6.51­6.57, 6.80­6.81, 6.79­6.81, and 6.91­6.95; likewise, pH values in the aeration tank were in the range of 6.92­6.97. Moreover, from the effluent of the UV/H2O2 process, pH values were in the range of 6.18 to 6.20. A summary of the maximum and minimum SSWW pH values is depicted in Table 4.1.

Figure 4.3 shows the profile of the SSWW temperature evolution in the ABR, aerobic AS, and UV/H2O2 reactors. The SSWW influent temperature values were in the range of 24.7 to 24.9°C. During the acclimatization of the sludge, temperature values for the biological reactors were fluctuating drastically. This may be attributed to the growth and metabolism of the microorganisms, where temperature values within the ABR chambers (1 to 5) were in the ranges of 24.0­25.5, 24.3­ 25.7, 24.1­25.6, 24.4­25.4, and 24.1­25.5°C, respectively. Temperature values in the aerobic AS aeration tank were in the range of 24.1­25.6°C.

In contrast, temperature values during experiments within the 5 chambers of the ABR were in the ranges of 24.50­24.70, 24.60­24.70, 24.50­24.70, 24.70­24.80, and 24.50­24.70°C. Likewise, temperature values in the aeration tank were in the range of 24.40­24.60°C. Moreover, from the effluent of the UV/H2O2 process, temperature values were in the range from 26.40 to 26.6°C. A summary of the maximum and minimum SSWW temperature values is depicted in Table 4.2.

It was deduced that temperature and pH during experiments were relatively constants compared to those from the acclimatization period due to the final adaptation of the microorganisms to the SSWW characteristics. Both temperature and pH values during experiments remained without significant changes throughout the entire experimental period.

4.2.4. TSS and VSS concentrations of the anaerobic sludge and MLSS and MLVSS concentrations of the aerobic sludge Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show the TSS and VSS concentrations in the ABR compartments, and it reveals a trend where the microorganisms rapidly adapted to the conditions inside the ABR by gradually increasing the wastewater concentration. These figures show a rapid growth until they reach stabilization. Variations after the 16th day may be attributed to the increase of the wastewater concentration from 20 to 40%. On the other hand, the variation after the 24th day may be attributed to the increase of the wastewater concentration from 40 to 60%. Moreover, from the 30th to the 37th day, microorganisms were in a lapse phase under a wastewater concentration of 80%. Then, after the wastewater concentration was increased from 80 to 100% on the 40th day, a slight increase of the microorganisms' growth was observed. Therefore, it could be concluded that the acclimatization process was successful and the experiments could start. There was no washout observed in the
84

effluent of the reactors; thus, no sludge was removed. After 60 days of acclimatization, the TSS and VSS concentrations of the inoculum were reached in the ranges of 12,750-21,600 mg/L and 10,60016,150 mg/L, respectively.

Figures 4.6 and 4.7 show the MLSS and MLVSS concentrations in the aerobic AS reactor, where it is shown a trend where the microorganisms rapidly adapted to the conditions inside the aeration tank, while gradually increasing the wastewater concentration (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%) for a period of 30 days. These figures also show a rapid growth until they reach stabilization; therefore, it could be concluded that the acclimatization process was successful and the experiments could start. After 30 days of acclimatization, the concentrations of MLSS and MLVSS were reached approximately to 3,718 and 2,399 mg/L, respectively. These results are similar to those observed in previous studies (Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011).

4.2.5. TSS and VSS concentrations of the SSWW The TSS and VSS values of the SSWW in the effluents of the ABR and the aerobic AS for the flow rates in the range from 2.93 to 11.70 mL/min are shown in Tables 4.3 and 4.4; where in both anaerobic and aerobic effluents, at higher flow rates, TSS values increased. It was also determined that flow rates greater than 7.80 mL/min exceeded the disposal level according to the Canadian standards for rivers, streams and estuaries (Environment Canada, 2000) and the Ontario standards (ECO, 2010) as depicted in Tables 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. Therefore, for the combined processes, flow rates of 7.50 mL/min or less were used. On the other hand, it is shown that effluent TSS concentrations of the ABR are higher than those observed using aerobic AS, and this may be attributed to poor sludge settleability in the ABR.

4.3. TOC and TN removal in SSWW using individual anaerobic and aerobic processes Biological treatment using an ABR and aerobic AS at a laboratory scale were studied to treat SSWW with TOC loadings of 0.03­1.01 g/(L day), TN loadings of 0.01­0.19 g/(L day), and flow rates of 2.93 to 11.70 mL/min. The results shown in Figure 4.8 revealed that both processes achieve a good efficiency to treat the SSWW for TOC removal in a range of 84.06 to 95.03%. Likewise, Figure 4.9 shows the results of TN removal, in the range of 31.32 to 73.46% for both processes. The lower performance was obtained with the ABR for an influent concentration of 183.35 mgTOC/L and 63.38 mgTN/L at the HRT of 7 days and a flow rate of 3.34mL/min with up to 84.06% TOC removal and 31.32% TN removal. Likewise, the best performance was obtained with the aerobic AS for an influent concentration of 1,008.85 mgTOC/L and 254.23 mgTN/L with up to 95.03% TOC removal and 73.46% TN removal. These results are comparable to those found in previous studies (Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011). Furthermore, it is also deduced that at higher influent TOC and TN concentrations, the TOC and TN removal rates are higher (5% and 15%, respectively), whereas the performance of the first three chambers of the ABR is decreased by approximately 30%, which may be attributed to the bioavailability of the organic matter and the acetogenesis.

Moreover, Figures 4.10 and 4.11 show the effects of HRT on TOC and TN removal using biological treatment for an influent concentration of 639.44.85 mgTOC/L and 144.40 mgTN/L; where at a HRT of 5 days, the TOC removal rate was reached to 83.64 and 89.66% on the ABR and the aerobic AS processes, respectively. Likewise, at a HRT of 8 days, the TOC removal rate was reached to 88.88 and 94.26% in the ABR and the aerobic AS processes, respectively. Similarly, at a HRT of 5 days, the TN removal was reached to 36.49 and 43.19% in the ABR and the aerobic AS processes, respectively. In contrast, at a HRT of 8 days, the TN removal rate reached 51.52 and 75.15% in the
90

ABR and the aerobic AS processes, respectively. Thus, it is perceived that the TOC and TN removal were significantly higher by prolonging the HRT.

In spite of the results from previous studies (Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011), a good removal of TN, in the range from 31.32 to 73.46%, was achieved by varying the flow rate and influent concentration of the SSWW; this may be attributed to the well maintained conditions in the systems, where DO concentrations were in the ranges of 0.2­1.2 mg/L and 0.4­3.2 mg/L for the ABR and the aerobic AS, respectively. Therefore, DO concentrations of above 1.0 mg/L permitted nitrification, whereas DO concentrations of below 0.5 mg/L permitted denitrification.

4.4. TOC and TN removal in SSWW using combined anaerobic-aerobic systems Although individual processes of both anaerobic and aerobic processes are significantly efficient to treat the SSWW as shown in the previous section, combined anaerobic and aerobic systems performed higher efficiencies as discussed in the following sections.

4.4.1. TOC and TN removal in SSWW using combined anaerobic-aerobic processes As depicted in Figures 4.12 and 4.13, up to 96.36% TOC and 80.53% TN removal rates were obtained for influent concentrations of 1,008.85 mgTOC/L and 419.77 mgTN/L, HRT of 6.24 days, and a flow rate of 3.75mL/min, while 93.15% TOC and 33.21% TN removal rates were obtained for influent concentrations of 1,008.85 mgTOC/L and 419.77 mgTN/L, HRT of 3.12 days, and a flow rate of 7.50mL/min using combined ABR and aerobic AS.

4.4.2. TOC and TN removal in SSWW using combined aerobic-anaerobic processes By making the aerobic stage the first step of the combined processes, higher TOC and TN removal rates were also reached compared to those of individual processes, as shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15, respectively. In the case of aerobic-anaerobic processes, up to 96.10% TOC and 76.44% TN removal rates were obtained for influent concentrations of 1,008.85 mgTOC/L and 425.54 mgTN/L, at a HRT of 6.24 days, and a flow-rate of 3.75mL/min, while 86.04% TOC and 29.41% TN removal rates were obtained for influent concentrations of 1,008.85 mgTOC/L and 425.54 mgTN/L, HRT of 3.12 days, and a flow-rate of 7.50mL/min.

Both combined biological processes achieved good results in treating SSWW, with TOC and TN removal rates of above 95 and 75%, respectively. Up to 96.36% TOC and 80.53% TN removal rates were reached by combined anaerobic-aerobic processes, while, up to 96.10% TOC and 76.44% TN removal rates were attained by combined aerobic-anaerobic processes. Thus, it was determined that combined anaerobic-aerobic processes have a considerable advantage in combined aerobicanaerobic processes of approximately 0.26% TOC and 4.09% TN removal rates. Therefore, it was recommended to use combined anaerobic-aerobic processes for following experiments. Accordingly, an adequate combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes is essential for the biological removal of nutrients (N and P), as depicted in the obtained TN removal by combining anaerobic-aerobic systems (Del Pozo and Diez, 2003; Ahn et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2009).

4.4.3. TOC and TN removal in SSWW using combined anaerobic-aerobic processes with recycling An experiment was conducted with the recycling mode, in which the SSWW treated in the aerobic AS reactor was recycled into the ABR, in order to evaluate the performance of the combined anaerobic-aerobic processes and to analyze the impact on TN removal. For this experiment, an influent concentration of 639.44 mgTOC/L and 144.40 mgTN/L and a flow-rate of 7.50mL/min were used.

Results shows that recycling the flow from the aerobic AS into the ABR did not significantly decrease either TOC or TN concentrations. As depicted in Figures 4.16 and 4.17, a minimum variation of 0.02 and 0.05% was observed for TOC and TN removal rates, whereas the HRT of the recycling mode system doubles that of the combined anaerobic-aerobic processes; thus, making the combined system with recycling less efficient than without recirculating the flow.

4.5. TOC and TN removal in SSWW using UV/H2O2 process alone The UV/H2O2 process alone was studied to treat SSWW with TOC and TN loadings of 64.88­ 349.84, and 18.10­111.43 mg/L, respectively. Temperature and pH remained constant in the range of 26.40­26.60°C and 6.18­6.20, respectively, except in the dark experiments, where temperature was in the ranges of 21.10­21.50°C. There was no analysis of different intermediates that may be formed during the UV/H2O2 treatment. Figures 4.18, 4.19, and 4.20 show the TOC removal of the raw SSWW being treated by the UV/H2O2 process alone using different H2O2 concentrations (0, 100, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, and 2000 mg/L) at the initial TOC concentrations of 64.88, 163.69, and 348.84 mg/L in continuous mode without recycling. It was determined that by using UV light solely there was no significant TOC removal, the maximum value was 6.96% at HRT of 180 min and TOCin of 64.88 mg/L. On the other hand, it was shown that an optimum H2O2 dosage should be determined since an overdose of H2O2 will negatively affect the organic removal by ·OH recombination, as shown in Reaction (2.26).

Figure 4.21 shows the maximum TOC removal for different SSWW concentrations using UV/H2O2 treatment at a HRT of 3 h in continuous mode without recycling. This figure illustrates a trend, where it may be stated that by increasing the SSWW concentration, the TOC removal capacity decreases due to the presence of more organic matter ready to compete for ·OH and the production of intermediates, which tends to lower the efficiency of the UV/H2O2 process. The results revealed a reasonable efficiency; up to 75.22% TOC removal was obtained for an influent concentration of 64.88 mgTOC/L at the HRT of 180 min with H2O2 concentration of 900 mg/L. These results are in accordance with the previous studies of Cao (2009), Cao and Mehrvar (2011), Barrera (2011), and Barrera et al. (2011).

In contrast, Figures 4.22, 4.23, and 4.24 show the possible TN removal of the SSWW being treated by the UV/H2O2 using different H2O2 concentrations (0, 100, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500 and 2000 mg/L) at the initial TN concentrations of 18.10, 40.02 and 93.94 mg/L. It was determined that there was no significant removal of TN using UV/H2O2 process for the treatment of SSWW. Figure 4.25 confirms that the UV/H2O2 process is not able to remove TN from SSWW, showing a maximum variation of 5.99%. Therefore, this section is focused on TOC removal using the UV/H2O2 process.

4.5.1. Dark experiments Dark experiments were conducted to analyze the possible loss of organic matter through adsorption on the walls of the photoreactor or by volatilization. The SSWW was pumped into the system with the UV lamps off. Figures 4.26 and 4.27 show TOC and TN removal rates for the dark experiments with no UV radiation present by varying H2O2 concentration (0, 900 and 2000 mg/L). It was determined that TOC and TN concentrations remained constant with only a maximum variation of 1.87 and 0.86% for TOC and TN decrease, respectively. It was affirmed that there was no significant organic matter adsorption to the reactor walls or material losses due to volatilization; subsequently any degradation can be attributed to the action of the UV/H2O2 process itself. Table 4.5 shows a summary of the results of the dark experiments at a HRT of 180 min.

4.5.2. Optimal H2O2 dosage and molar ratio of [H2O2]/[TOC] for the UV/H2O2 process It is well known that H2O2 produces hydroxyl radicals in the presence of UV radiation. However, it is important to determine an optimum dosage to be added to the process, since an overdose of the oxidant can lead to negative effects in organics removal due to the recombination of hydroxyl radicals (·OH), as shown in Reaction (2.26), whereas a low dosage will reduce the ·OH production; and thus, lower efficiency of the process for both cases.

114

In order to determine the optimum dosage of H2O2, different H2O2 concentrations were used (0, 100, 600, 900, 1200, 1500 and 2000 mg/L), and TOC concentrations varied from 64.88 to 349.84 mg/L for the experiments in batch recirculation mode. The results revealed a reasonable efficiency, up to 75.22% TOC removal rate, was obtained for an influent concentration of 64.88 mgTOC/L, HRT of 180 min, and H2O2 concentration of 900 mg/L, as depicted in Figure 4.28. Therefore, further experiments were conducted using 900 mg/L as the optimal dose for the treatment of SSWW. Besides, Figure 4.28 also confirms that at a higher slaughterhouse wastewater concentration, the TOC removal capacity decreased due to the presence of more organic matter ready to compete for hydroxyl radicals (·OH).

It is highly recommended to determine an optimal ratio of [H2O2]/[TOC] (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004; Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera, 2011; Barrera et al., 2011), which is a critical parameter for optimization of the wastewater treatment by adjusting the concentration of H2O2 to specific organic matter concentrations present at any time while the treatment is in progress. This factor helps to maximize the efficiency and reduce chemical and electrical costs. Furthermore, Figure 4.29 illustrates an optimum molar ratio dosage of 13.87 mgH2O2/mgTOCin for the UV/H2O2 process. These results are in accordance with the previous studies that propose optimum molar ratios in the range of 0-100 mgH2O2/mgTOCin (Baeza et al., 2003; Torrades et al., 2003; Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004; Pagano et al., 2008; Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera, 2011; Barrera et al., 2011).

Likewise, the ratios of H2O2 concentration by influent TOC concentration and HRTs within the UV/H2O2 process in batch recirculation mode are depicted in Figure 4.30, where an optimum ratio of 4.62 mgH2O2/mgTOCin.h was found to result a maximum TOC removal of 75.22%.

4.6. TOC and TN removal in SSWW using combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes Previous sections have shown the high efficiency of different alternatives for treating slaughterhouse wastewater (SSWW). However, the performance of the combination of all those processes in order to get complete mineralization of the organic matter was studied.

Figures 4.31 and 4.32 show the TOC and TN concentrations of the SSWW during different stages of combined ABR-aerobic AS-UV/H2O2 processes at HRTs of 3.15 to 4 days and flow rates of 5.90 to 7.50 mL/min with influent TOC and TN concentrations of 941.19­1006.90 and 200.03­ 214.08 mg/L, respectively. Up to 99.98% TOC removal and 82.84% TN removal rates were obtained for influent concentrations of 1,004.88 mgTOC/L and 200.03 mgTN/L, HRT of 4.00 days, and a flow rate of 5.90 mL/min (Figures 4.33 and 4.34). Other experiments show 99.13% TOC and 82.51% TN removal rates, obtained for an influent concentration of 1,006.90 mgTOC/L and 203.84 mgTN/L, HRT of 3.50 days, and flow rate of 6.75mL/min. Likewise, up to 98.91% TOC and 81.03% TN removal rates were obtained for an influent concentration of 941.19 mgTOC/L and 214.08 mgTN/L, HRT of 3.15 days, and flow rate of 7.50mL/min as depicted in Figures 4.33 and 4.34.

These results confirm that an adequate combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes is essential for the nitrogen removal in order to obtain removal rates of more than 70% (up to 82.84% of TN removed) and they also confirm that using advanced oxidation processes as post-treatment guarantees the complete mineralization of the organic matter and disinfection of SSWW, with up to 99.98% of TOC removed as depicted in Figure 4.33 (Del Pozo and Diez, 2003; Ahn et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2008; Cao, 2009; Chan et al., 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera, 2011; Barrera et al., 2011).

Figures 4.35 and 4.36 show a comparison of all processes used in this study, with maximum TOC and TN removals reached by the different alternatives, including the UV/H2O2 process alone (75.22% for TOC and 5.99% for TN), the ABR process alone (89.47% for TOC and 49.68% for TN), the aerobic AS process alone (94.53% for TOC and 73.46% for TN), combined aerobic-anaerobic processes (96.10% for TOC and 76.44% for TN), combined anaerobic-aerobic processes (96.36% for TOC and 80.53% for TN), and combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 (99.98% for TOC and 82.84% for TN).

4.7. CBOD5 removal in SSWW using ABR alone, aerobic AS alone, UV/H2O2 alone, and combined processes Figures 4.37 and 4.38 show there was a significant reduction in CBOD5 using ABR alone, aerobic AS alone, UV/H2O2 alone, and combined processes. Figure 4.37 shows the maximum inlet concentration of CBOD5 from the SSWW to be 640 mg/L. It also illustrates the CBOD5 concentration of every effluent of the different processes used for the treatment of SSWW, including UV/H2O2 alone (100mg/L); aerobic AS alone (50 mg/L); ABR alone (31 mg/L); combined anaerobic-aerobic processes (4 mg/L); combined aerobic-anaerobic processes (3 mg/L); and combined anaerobicaerobic and UV/H2O2 (2 mg/L), where error bars represent standard deviations. In addition, Figure 4.38 illustrates that the maximum removal efficiency of CBOD5 was reached using combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes; up to 99.69%. Comparatively, the maximum CBOD5 removal efficiencies for other methods, including UV/H2O2 alone, aerobic AS alone, ABR alone, combined anaerobic-aerobic processes, and combined aerobic-anaerobic processes, reached 84.38, 92.19, 95.16, 99.38 and 99.53% of removal, respectively. It was deduced that only by using biological treatment the CBOD5 concentration could be reduced more than 90% since maximum CBOD5 removal by using UV/H2O2 alone merely was reached to 84.38% at a H2O2 concentration of 900 mg/L and a HRT of 3 h.

As depicted in Figure 4.39, TOC is directly proportional to CBOD5. This confirms that TOC analysis provides an accurate appraisal of the total organic compounds present in a wastewater sample in comparison to BOD or COD. TOC can be quantified by measuring the CO2 generated when the organic compounds are oxidized. Thus, TOC analysis excludes the inorganic carbon compounds in order to obtain accurate results of the organic contamination in source water. As the American Public Health Association (APHA) described, TOC method may be more suitable for determining organic matter content since it takes into account all of its different oxidation states (APHA, 1998). Moreover, COD and BOD tests may take from 3 h to 5 days to produce any result, whereas TOC analysis can provide results in 15 min.

4.8. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to determine the best alternative on SSWW treatment by optimizing total electricity cost and HRT As described above, several processes were examined in order to determine their efficiencies in the treatment of SSWW, to evaluate the performance of the different configurations of the combined processes, and to analyze the factors affecting their effectiveness.

Several parameters are important for a wastewater treatment system, such as HRT, which will affect the final removal efficiency of organic pollutants in wastewater and the operating and maintenance (O&M) costs of the system; that is the reason why this parameter is necessary to be optimized. Therefore, at a laboratory scale, factors that affect the efficiency of the system are electricity consumption and the usage of chemicals such as H2O2 as fundamental parts of the total cost. Thus, these factors (electricity and H2O2 consumption) were considered for the CEA in this study in order to optimize the combined processes.

4.8.1. Kinetic modeling for the ABR alone The kinetic model Equation (2.14) developed by Kennedy and Barriault (2007) describe the substrate concentration driving force within different compartments of an ABR without recycling. The first order rate constant could be calculated from operational treatment data knowing the substrate concentrations and biomass in each compartment. The mass balance in the first compartment and subsequent i compartments of an n-compartment ABR are shown as follows:

where, Si = concentration of the substrate in compartment i of the ABR (mg/L); Si ­ 1 = concentration of the substrate in compartment i ­ 1 of the ABR, when i ­ 1 = 0 then Si ­ 1 = So (mg/L); So = concentration of the substrate in the influent (mg/L); Si = concentration of the substrate in compartment i of the ABR (mg/L); rr = recycle rate in the ABR, which is a percent of the flow rate of the influent (%); kCi = first order rate coefficient of substrate in compartment i of the ABR;

kC1 = first order rate coefficient of substrate in compartment 1 of the ABR; Xi = biomass concentration of substrate in compartment i of the ABR (mg/L); Vi = volume of the compartment i of the ABR (L); Q = flow rate of influent = V/t (L/d); V = total volume of the reactor (L); and t = HRT (d).

Since there is no recycling, S5 = Sf, and Equations (4.1) to (4.5) are reduced to Equations (4.6) and (4.7), which are used to predict the effluent concentrations of TOC in the ABR.

The comparison between predicted values and the experimental data for the combined anaerobic-aerobic processes and combined aerobic-anaerobic processes are presented in Figures 4.42 and 4.43, respectively. These figures show an agreement between the predicted model values and the experimental data. Therefore, Equations (4.14) and (4.16) could be used to predict the effluent TOC concentrations at a specific HRT for the combined anaerobic-aerobic processes and combined aerobic-anaerobic processes, respectively.

where, VT = volume of the treated SSWW equal to the volume of the photoreactor (1.35 L); p = power rating of the system (14 W); and  = G.Ab./p (moles/s.W), where G = total absolute photon flow (E/s) emitted from the lamp in all directions at 254 nm, Ab = fraction photons absorbed (0.12), p = power output of the lamp, and  = 2.6852×10-2 (moles/E).

Thus, Equation (4.29) was obtained from a parameter estimation method, by giving different values to kTOC/kH2O2 until reaching an absolute relative error of less than 10% between the model

prediction and any experimental data. The initial value for kTOC/kH2O2 was 7.0×105 1/(M.s) (Barrera, 2011) divided by 2.7×107 1/(M.s) (Christensen et al., 1982). When kTOC/kH2O2 values substituted into the model overestimated the TOC removal rate, the value was reduced, while the kTOC/kH2O2 values were substituted into the model underestimated the TOC removal rate, the value was increased. As a result, Equation (4.29) was used to predict the effluent concentrations of TOC from the UV/H2O2 process alone.

4.8.5. Optimization of the total electricity cost and HRT to determine the best alternative on SSWW treatment Durán et al. (2012) presented an operational cost study to evaluate three different processes for the treatment of an industrial effluent. The operational costs due to the consumption of electrical energy, reagents, and catalysts were calculated from the optimal conditions of each process, and allowed to determine the most economically feasible system. This section will be based on the procedure suggested by Durán et al. (2012) in order to determine the best alternative of this study.

Table 4.6 summarizes the technical conditions and performance of different processes evaluated in this study, including UV/H2O2 alone; aerobic AS alone; ABR alone; combined anaerobic-aerobic processes; combined aerobic-anaerobic processes; and combined aerobic-anaerobic and UV/H2O2 processes. Table 4.6 also summarizes the amount of H2O2 consumed in each of the processes involved in the economic study.

The economic analysis was carried out by analyzing the degradation of TOC in the SSWW. According to Bolton et al. (2001), the cost of electricity per mass of TOC removed can be estimated by Equation (4.31), which was defined for high TOC influent concentration because the reaction rate of TOC is directly proportional to the rate of electricity used (Bolton et al., 2001; Cao 2009). According to the Ontario Energy Board (OEB, 2011), the market price of electricity based on tiered prices is $0.071/KWh. The prices of H2O2 and the electrical consumptions of the different devices used for calculating the costs are shown in Table 4.7 with the assumption of a common TOC concentration in the SSWW influent of 1,000 mg/L.

Figure 4.46 shows the comparison of six techniques in terms of mineralization, measured in grams of TOC removed as a function of operation time. It can be observed that the combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes were more technically efficient than the other processes because they could remove 15% more TOC during the same operation time. However, this apparent advantage must be confirmed in economic terms.

Figure 4.47 shows the operational costs per kilogram of TOC removed, including optimization of HRT and H2O2 consumption for the six processes as a function of the percentage of TOC removed. UV/H2O2 alone is the less efficient technology with an optimum removal of 49.88% at a high cost of $67.06/kg of TOC removed. The TOC removal does not significantly increase by augmenting the HRT (Figure 4.47b). In contrast, it was observed that the aerobic AS is an efficient process with an optimum TOC removal of 88.10% at a cost of $4.03/kg of TOC removed (Figure 4.47a).

Figure 4.48 shows the absolute operational costs ($) compared with the percentage of TOC removed. Two important facts should be noted, the costs increase with the amount of TOC removed for the six processes, especially when high TOC removal rates are achieved; and also, if low or intermediate amounts of TOC are to be removed, combined processes and individual processes are comparable in economic terms.

Finally, Figure 4.49 summarizes the operational costs of the six processes in terms of dollars per cubic meter of treated wastewater, which is a useful measurement from an industrial viewpoint. It
156

is confirmed that costs ($/m3) increase dramatically with TOC removal because of the electricity consumption in the UV/H2O2 process alone, reaching values ten times higher than those of the processes that use biological treatment. Thus, in the combined processes, the main costs are initially for pumps, reagents and air injection; only when the TOC removal is higher than 60% do the electricity costs gradually increase.

To conclude, it was determined that the optimum system is the combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes, with an optimal TOC removal of 92.46% at an HRT of 41 h, at a cost of $1.25/kg of TOC removed and $11.60/m3 of treated SSWW. It should be noted that this process reaches a TOC removal of 99% at a HRT of 76.5 h (3.19 days) with an estimated operational cost of $2.19/kg of TOC removed and $21.65/m3 of treated SSWW.

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1. Conclusions The following conclusions are drawn from this thesis: 

Six different systems for the treatment of SSWW were evaluated in this study, including UV/H2O2 alone; aerobic AS alone; ABR alone; combined anaerobic-aerobic processes; combined aerobicanaerobic processes; and combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2. Performance of those systems was analyzed through the measurements of the removal efficiencies of TOC, TN, and CBOD5.



The ABR process demonstrated good efficiency in treating SSWW with an influent concentration of 1,008.85 mgTOC/L and 254.23 mgTN/L, a HRT of 7 days, and flow rate of 3.34 mL/min, reaching removals of TOC, TN and CBOD5 of 89.47, 49.68 and 95.16%, respectively. It was also observed that at a longer HRT, the removal efficiency was higher. Although anaerobic treatment is efficient, complete stabilization of the organic matter was not possible by anaerobic treatment alone as the effluent produced by anaerobic treatment contained solubilised organic matter, which is more suited for treatment using aerobic processes or anaerobic­aerobic systems. For that reason, later post-treatment using aerobic treatment was necessary to enhance the efficiency and the biological removal of TN.



The aerobic AS process demonstrated better efficiency than that obtained with the ABR, reaching removals of TOC, TN and CBOD5 of 94.53, 73.46 and 92.19%, respectively. In spite of the results of previous studies (Cao, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011), a good removal of TN (73.46%) was achieved, varying the flow rate and influent concentration of the SSWW. This may be attributed to the well-maintained conditions in the systems, where DO concentrations were in the ranges of 0.2­1.2 mg/L and 0.4­3.2 mg/L for the ABR and the aerobic AS, respectively. Therefore, DO

162

concentrations above 1.0 mg/L permitted nitrification, whereas DO concentrations below 0.5 mg/L permitted denitrification. 

Although both individual anaerobic and aerobic processes demonstrated a significant efficiency to treat the SSWW, better results were found by combining anaerobic and aerobic processes, with TOC removal of 96.36%, TN removal of 80.53% and CBOD5 removal of 99.38% from an influent concentration of 1,008.85 mgTOC/L and 419.77 mgTN/L at the HRT of 6.24 days and a flow rate of 3.75mL/min, using combined ABR first and then aerobic AS. The combined aerobic-anaerobic system was also studied, resulting in high efficiency for TOC, TN, and CBOD5 removal rates, up to 96.10% TOC, 76.44% TN, and 99.53% CBOD5 were removed. Both combined biological processes achieved good results for treating SSWW, with TOC, TN and CBOD5 removal rates of above 95, 75, and 99%, respectively. Nevertheless, it was determined that combined anaerobicaerobic processes have a considerable advantage compared to combined aerobic-anaerobic processes when treating TN, with a difference of approximately 4.09% TN removal rate. Therefore, combined anaerobic-aerobic processes were used for next experiments. Therefore, an adequate combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes is essential for the successful removal of nutrients from SSWW.



An experiment was conducted in the recycling mode, in which the SSWW treated in the aerobic AS reactor was recycled into the ABR. It was found that recycling the flow did not significantly decrease either TOC or TN concentrations. Only a minimum variation of 0.02 and 0.05% was observed for TOC and TN removal rates, whereas the HRT of the recycling mode system doubled that of the combined anaerobic-aerobic processes; thus, making the combined system with recycling less efficient than without recirculating the flow.



The UV/H2O2 process was demonstrated to be an effective technology for SSWW post-treatment. The results revealed a reasonable efficiency to treat a secondary effluent of SSWW. Up to 75.22% TOC removal rate was obtained for an influent concentration of 64.88 mgTOC/L at the HRT of 180 min with H2O2 concentration of 900 mg/L. Nevertheless, there were no significant changes to the TN removal rate using UV/H2O2 process alone. An optimum molar ratio dosage of 13.87 mgH2O2/mgTOCin was also found for the UV/H2O2 process. Therefore, a good alternative is to combine biological treatment and AOPs.
163



The combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes proved to be able to enhance the treatment ability of the TOC, TN and CBOD5 obtained by the other systems. Up to 99.98% TOC, 82.84% TN, and 99.69% CBOD5 removals were obtained for an influent concentration of 1,004.88 mgTOC/L and 200.03 mgTN/L at the HRT of 4.00 days and a flow rate of 5.90 mL/min. These results confirm that an adequate combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes is essential for nitrogen reduction, in order to obtain removals of more than 70% (82.84% of TN removed), and they confirm that using AOPs as post-treatment guarantees the complete mineralization of the organic matter and disinfection of SSWW.



A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was used to determine the best alternative for SSWW treatment. HRT was optimized, since HRT affects the final removal efficiency of organic pollutants in wastewater and the operating and maintenance (O&M) costs of the system. The combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes were more technically efficient than the other processes, removing 15% more TOC during the same amount of operation time. UV/H2O2 alone is the less efficient technology with an optimum removal of 49.88% at a high cost of $67.06/kg of TOC removed. If low or intermediate amounts of TOC are to be removed, combined processes and individual processes are comparable in economic terms. In the combined processes, the main costs are initially for pumps, reagents and air injection; only when the TOC removal is higher than 60% do the electricity costs gradually increase. Finally, it was determined that the optimum system was the combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes, with an optimal TOC removal of 92.46% at an HRT of 41 h, at a cost of $1.25/kg of TOC removed and $11.60/m3 of treated SSWW. It should be note that this process reaches a TOC removal of 99% at a HRT of 76.5 h (3.19 days) with an estimated operational cost of $2.19/kg of TOC removed and $21.65/m 3 of treated SSWW. Therefore, this confirms that the best alternative to treat SSWW is by an adequate combination of biological treatment and AOPs.

5.2. Recommendations The following recommendations are suggested for further research on combined biological and AOPs processes:  It is suggested to collect the biogas produced in the compartments of the ABR in order to evaluate the performances of acidogenesis and methanogenesis and a possible usage of this biogas as an energy source for the system. Following studies should take into account the accumulation of volatile fatty acids.  Further study should be focused on the characterization of the microorganisms present in the activated sludge to determine their nitrifying and denitrifying ability.  Further work should conduct the analysis of different intermediates that may be formed during the UV/H2O2 treatment.  Further research is suggested by using different H2O2 dosages in the combined anaerobic-aerobic UV/H2O2 processes and other processes such as photo-Fenton to evaluate a possible optimization in terms of HRT.  Further studies should use actual raw slaughterhouse wastewater in order to evaluate the applicability of the systems examined in these studies to actual conditions, and determine a possible scale up of laboratory scale systems to be adapted as onsite treatment for slaughterhouses in Ontario.  Further research should also consider the examination of emerging contaminants present in slaughterhouse wastewater, including pharmaceutical compounds used by veterinary physicians, anti-inflammatories, cleaning products, endocrine disruptors, and possible hazardous compounds, which are being discharged without proper treatment, particularly in the livestock farming.  Further work may also consider additional investigation of kinetic modeling, optimization of processes, and modeling of the combined anaerobic-aerobic and UV/H2O2 processes.

Appendix A. Determination of theoretical TOC and TN of the SSWW As described in Section 3.2.1, the SSWW contains 1,950 mg/L of commercial meat extract powder (Oxoid Lab Lemco L0029, Oxoid Ltd.), 200 mg/L of glycerol (C3H8O3), 360 mg/L of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), 50 mg/L sodium chloride (NaCl), 30 mg/L of potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH2PO4), 24 mg/L of calcium chloride (CaCl2), and 7.5 mg/L of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O). The carbon source of the SSWW comes from the 17 amino acids present in the meat extract, described in Table A.1, and glycerol (C3H8O3), while the nitrogen source comes from the same amino acids (Table A.1) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). An example of the calculation can be described as follows, by taking Valine (C5H11NO2) to obtain the % w of TOC/w of meat extract and the % w of TN/w of meat extract.

With the total %w of TOC/w of meat extract (31.51 mgC/100 mg meat extract) and %w of TN/w of meat extract (10.86 mgN/100 mg meat extract) values obtained, theoretical TOC and TN concentrations can be calculated as the sum of the TOC content of the meat extract (1,950 mg/L) and the TOC content of the glycerol (C3H8O3) (200 mg/L), and the sum of the TN content of the meat

Appendix B. Determination of the Reynolds number In fluid mechanics, the Reynolds number Re is a dimensionless number that gives a measure of the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and consequently quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions. For flow in a pipe or tube, experimental observations show that for fully developed flow, laminar flow occurs when Re < 2,000, turbulent flow occurs when Re > 4,000, and transient flow occurs when 2,000 < Re < 4,000. For flow in a pipe or tube and in a rectangular duct, the Reynolds number is determined by Equation (3.8). An example of the Reynolds number calculation is described as follows, the rest of calculations are portrayed in Table B.1.

(3.8)

where, Re = Reynolds number; v = mean fluid velocity (m/s); L = length that the flow is going through or around (diameter of the pipe or tube) (m); V = volume of the sample (L);  = dynamic viscosity of the fluid (for water at 25°C,  = 8.98×10-4 kg/m.s);  = density of the fluid (for water at 25°C,  = 1000 kg/m3); Q = volumetric flow rate (m3/s); and A = pipe cross-sectional area (m2).

Appendix C.Determination of TSS and VSS TSS and VSS were determined by Equations (3.2) and (3.3) as explained in Section 3.5.3, based on the sections 2540D and 2540E of the Standard Methods (APHA, 1998).

Appendix D. Sample standard deviation and relative error analysis Each experiment in the present work was replicated three times, and the reported results represent the average value of the collected results. In Chapter 4, error bars depicted in the figures
170

represent the sample standard deviation (s), which was used to analyze the accuracy of an experimental measurement for a finite set of experimental data. s was calculated as follows.   ( )

(D.1)

where, i = observed values of the sample items (1, 2, ..., n);  = mean value of the sample observations; and N = sample size.

Relative error was used to express an accuracy of an acceptable value of the quantity being measured. Relative error could be positive, negative or zero indicating that the measured value is smaller than, greater than, or equal to the mean of a set of data. The lowest average absolute error was used as criterion for the optimization of the total electricity costs and HRT. Relative error can be obtained by Equation (D.2) as shown below.


(D.2)

where,  = accepted value; and  = mean of a finite set of data.

The non-linear least square function was used to determine the best-fit criterion, which means two sets of data are the most close to each other as expressed in Equation (D.3).
