Title: An Evaluation of the Potential Energy Benefits of Installing Green Roofs in Hong Kong Written by: Rina D. Parker Master of Applied Science, Environmental Applied Science and Management, 2011 Ryerson University

Abstract
Green roofs help mitigate the urban heat island effect, increase available green space, and reduce energy consumption of buildings. This thesis estimates potential energy benefits of installing green roofs on buildings in Hong Kong. EnergyPlus, a building energy simulation program, is used to model an extensive green roof installed on a two-storey building in downtown Hong Kong. Indoor and outdoor temperature data were collected from the green roof. Model calibration is performed using monitoring data, meeting the set acceptable margin of error of ± 20%. Air conditioning usage from April to September is approximately 232 kWh less in the room under the green roof than for the original roof showing that green roofs can reduce heat flux from the roof into buildings. Compared to other energy saving technologies, the cool roof provides a savings of 184 kWh over the green roof, translating to a $55 annual reduction in energy costs.

Chapter 1 ­ Introduction
Green technologies provide a way to increase the energy efficiency of buildings with respect to the use of resources such as energy, water, and materials. Using green technologies helps reduce the impact of a building on human health and the environment. By taking into account the entire lifecycle of a building during the design process, the consumption of these key resources can be significantly reduced (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2009). Installing a green roof is one way of moving towards a greener building. Considering the increasing energy needs worldwide, it is a good idea to install green roofs in order to reduce the heating and cooling load on buildings. Some examples of the benefits of implementing green roofs instead of standard roofs are improved urban air quality (Tan & Sia, 2005), reduced storm water runoff (Jennings, Hunt, & Moran, 2003), reduced energy consumption of buildings (Kohler, 2002), and reduced effects of the urban heat island effect (Akbari, 2001). The urban heat island effect is the concept that the temperature in urban environments, where there is a high concentration of tall buildings, is often higher than in more rural areas. Tall buildings tend to trap solar radiation, creating a micro-climate. Green roof vegetation and soil substrate can absorb and reflect radiation, reducing the heat that would normally be trapped by conventional roofs during warm weather. Green roofs may also have social benefits such as promotion of health and well-being, creation of an open space, improved aesthetics and available green space, and therapeutic benefits (City of Toronto & OCE-ETech, 2005).

Hong Kong is a region that could benefit from wide-scale implementation of green roofs. Hong Kong is a highly urbanized city with minimal green space and a population of over seven million people (Information Services Department, 2009). Green roofs would be beneficial in reducing the urban heat island effect, providing more energy efficient buildings, and increasing the amount of visible green space, particularly for low-rise buildings. Data from the Hong Kong Observatory show that temperature in urban areas of Hong Kong is increasing at a rate of 0.6°C per decade, which is much higher than in more rural areas where the temperature is increasing at a rate of 0.2°C per decade (Townshend, 2007). The feasibility and applicability of installing green roofs in Hong Kong is dependent on building type. Installing green roofs in the Old City Centre may not be practical because of very tall and narrow high-rise buildings with little roof space. Additionally, the energy benefits from green roofs will not be as pronounced on high-rise buildings that are 10 to 50 storeys as they will be on low-rise buildings. Although the aesthetic benefits of intensive green roofs in Hong Kong have been the focus for promoting green roofs (Townshend, 2007), extensive green roofs would benefit low-rise buildings the most because of greater affordability coupled with tangible energy savings. 1.1 Objective and Scope

The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and estimate the potential energy benefits of installing green roofs on buildings in Hong Kong. The scope is limited to extensive green roofs on low-rise buildings in Hong Kong. The scope also includes

2

investigating the energy benefits of alternative green technologies such as a cool roof, added roof insulation, and reflective windows. 1.2 Methodology Overview

The objective of this thesis will be met by: analyzing the potential energy benefit of green roofs using field monitoring data from a low-rise building in Hong Kong; modelling a two-storey building in downtown Hong Kong, operated by the Hong Kong Housing Society, with an extensive green roof, using EnergyPlus, a building energy simulation model; comparing monitored indoor and outdoor temperature data collected from the site against predicted temperature data from the EnergyPlus model; predicting energy and cost savings from the green roof over a conventional roof; comparing temperature, energy, and cost savings from using a green roof to alternatives; and providing recommendations on the most viable option for reducing energy consumption of buildings in Hong Kong. It is predicted that using a green roof will reduce roof surface and indoor air temperatures, reduce the heat flux into the building, and reduce the cost of operating the building, especially during the summer months. The full methodology is presented in Chapter 4.

Chapter 2 ­ Literature Review
2.1 Green Roof Background A green roof is a layer of vegetation placed or planted on a roof. A typical green roof consists of a structural support layer on the bottom, followed by a waterproof roofing membrane, insulation, and a drainage layer and root barrier, followed by growing medium such as soil and vegetation, as shown in Figure 2.1. Green roof guidelines published in 2002 by the Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau (FLL), a landscape industry organization in Germany, are the basis for design of most green roofs built today. These guidelines focus on the planning, execution, and upkeep of green roofs.

There are two main types of green roofs: intensive and extensive (Peck & Callaghan, 1999). Intensive green roofs require the most maintenance and watering, are typically accessible to visitors, and are usually very aesthetically pleasing because of the variety of trees, shrubs, and grass used for vegetation. However, intensive green roofs are more expensive than extensive green roofs, require high technical expertise for construction, place a large load on the roof, and usually require a deep growing medium to support the landscape. Extensive green roofs are a more passive alternative to intensive roofs and also require much less maintenance. The vegetation used creates a natural landscape, where the plants can grow freely. It is important that the plants selected be able to handle extreme weather conditions. Extensive green roofs are a good choice for retrofit buildings, are inexpensive compared to the intensive option, and only require a shallow growing medium. However, extensive green roofs can be unattractive and also have limited vegetation options (Peck & Callaghan, 1999). Table 2.1 presents a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of intensive and extensive green roofs.

Table 2.1: Summary of Advantages and Disadvantages of Extensive and Intensive Green Roofs (Peck & Callaghan, 1999) Extensive Advantages Lightweight Low maintenance Good for retrofit Good for 0-30° slope Inexpensive Low technical knowledge Disadvantages Limited plant choice Can be unattractive More expensive High technical expertise High roof load Need for irrigation/drainage Large plant diversity Attractive Usually accessible Can grow food Intensive

Various options for green roof design exist as well. Green roofs can be purchased as complete green roof systems, as modular systems or as pre-cultivated vegetation blankets. A brief overview of some of the design options for green roofs is discussed here. Soprema, a Canadian construction and roofing company, sells the SOPRANATURE green roof system, which includes six versatile systems with different types of layers and vegetation (Soprema, 2009). Another type of system, the modular system, incorporates the drainage and filter layer1, soil/substrate medium, and the

vegetation into one system, usually on a lightweight high-density polyethylene module (Velazquez, 2003). The modules are then interlocked to provide full coverage. Some of the main benefits of using a modular system instead of the multi-layered design for green roofs are: easier and more time efficient installation, design simplification, and the ability for off-site planting. Because the module is prepared off-site it can be installed on the roof with minimal effort. Additionally, the plants can be grown off-site and as such can be grown at any time of the year and can also be installed on the roof at any time of the year because a plant and root foundation already exist. This helps improve the immediate aesthetic appearance of the roof. Since each module is separate, each module can have different substrate and soil mixtures and depths depending on the needs of the plant. This contributes to greater vegetation diversification on the rooftop. Another option is pre-cultivated vegetation blankets, which can be placed directly on the roof and require watering only for the first few weeks (Xeroflor Canada, 2008). Many vegetation mats are certified to be wind-uplift resistant, fire resistant, erosion resistant, and are designed to prevent many types of weeds from growing. A general green roof system would have a root barrier, made of low-density polyethylene, laid out directly on the roof, then the drainage layer, followed by the moisture retention fleece and then the moss-sedum vegetation mat. The water retention fleece is usually made from polymeric fiber and should retain nutrients for the plants, increasing the water retention capacity of the roof and reducing the amount of water going to the storm water runoff. Routine maintenance may be required for the green roof systems such as fertilizer application about twice a year and irrigation if there is extreme drought.

(Xeroflor Canada, n.d.). Green roofs can also be customized for individual buildings, which was the case for the green roofs discussed in this thesis. 2.2 Energy Balance The energy balance of a green roof can be described in terms of its incoming and outgoing energy. Solar radiation is the main source of incoming energy that impacts on any roof type, green roofs included. Incoming solar radiation can be divided into shortwave radiation and long-wave radiation (emitted in the form of thermal infrared); however, the majority of incoming radiation is short-wave. Short-wave radiation that is not absorbed by the Earths surface is reflected and absorbed by objects such as clouds and then re-emitted to the Earths surface as long-wave radiation. Incoming solar energy is balanced by sensible heat, latent heat, and stored heat. Sensible heat is released back into the atmosphere through convection when soil surface energy is greater than the atmosphere. Latent heat results from evapotranspiration ­ evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration through the plants. Stored heat is the remaining heat that is stored by the green roof substrate and either releases back into the atmosphere at night or enters the building (Sailor, 2008). Overall, the energy balance of a green roof can be described according to the following equation (Tsang & Jim, 2011):

8

K i + K r + L i + L r = Q E + QH + Q S where, Ki = incident short-wave radiation Kr = reflected short-wave radiation Li = incident long-wave radiation Lr = reflected long-wave radiation QE = latent heat QH = sensible heat QS = stored heat 2.3 Summary of Literature on Green Roofs The majority of green roof research has been conducted in parts of Europe and North America. Green roofs have been used in Germany since the 1980s and their popularity has grown tremendously. In 1989, green roofs covered 1 million square metres of roofs in Germany, and by 1996 green roofs covered over 10 million square metres. The main reason there was such a large growth was because of municipal grants and state legislation that provided funding for green roof construction (Peck & Callaghan, 1999). Since these initiatives in Germany, other European countries and cities have passed municipal by-laws requiring green roofs on certain buildings and providing funding during different stages of the green roof's lifespan. As a result, green roofs are much more common in France, Austria, Norway, Switzerland, and Germany than in areas without these initiatives. As discussed in Chapter 1, there are numerous benefits to installing green roofs on buildings such as reduction in the urban heat island effect, reduction in storm water runoff, and improvement of air quality; however, this thesis focuses on energy benefits. The survey of existing literature focuses on these energy benefits. Palomo Del Barrio

9

(1997) developed a model to analyze the cooling potential of green roofs in Southern Europe during the summer months only. This model showed how green roofs can be used for building insulation. The green roof model combined together the support model, soil model, and canopy model to determine the effect of heat flux through the roof for particular design parameters of soil thickness, density, and moisture, and canopy transpiration. The results of the model showed that increasing soil thickness decreased the heat flux into the building. Similarly, increasing the soil moisture reduced the heat flux into the building. However, decreasing the soil density reduced the heat flux into the building. Varying canopy transpiration had little effect on heat flux. However, using plants with a lot of foliage and with a majority of the leaves distributed horizontally can reduce the solar radiation transmission and provide good shadowing for the roof, providing more insulation. In Germany, Kohler (2002) compared a gravel-covered roof in Neubrandenburg and a bitumen-sealed roof in Berlin to green roofs at the corresponding locations. The gravel roof had similar temperature results to the green roof, although added a heavier load to the building. The bitumen roof surface temperature was about 10ºC warmer than the green roof. Liu & Minor (2005) also studied the effect of green roofs on surface temperature reduction and heat flow through the roof on installation green roofs in Toronto. The green roofs reduced the summer temperature of the roof by more than 20ºC and reduced the heat flux through the roof by 70 to 90 percent. Results were not as significant in the winter because the soil substrate froze, but the heat flux into the building decreased by about 10 to 30 percent.

10

A life cycle assessment conducted on a multi-storey residential building in Madrid compared the environmental impacts of buildings with and without green roofs (Saiz, Kennedy, Bass, & Pressnail, 2006). Roofs in Madrid are typically composed of a PVC membrane on the bottom followed by 'filtron tiles' made of 4 cm extruded polystyrene insulation and a layer of gray gravel on top for protection. Saiz et al. (2006) compared a regular gray gravel roof, a regular roof with a white reflective paint coating, and an extensive green roof. The extensive green roof had a 9-cm soil substrate layer with a vegetation layer of sedum, cactus, and desert shrub, plants common to extensive green roofs in Madrid climate. These plants are known to be drought resistant and do not require high maintenance. One of the major benefits of a green roof is its low solar absorption resulting in lower roof surface temperatures and therefore a reduction in heat flux into the building. In this case, the maximum temperature of the regular roof was 65ºC, the white roof 42ºC, and the green roof 35ºC. This resulted in a reduction of 1.2 percent in the annual energy use of the building, with a greater reduction in the summer than in the winter. It is important to note that the green roof was only added to 16 percent of the available roof surface. The study showed similar benefits in summer cooling between the green roof and the white roof (the white roof achieved approximately 65 percent of the energy savings of the green roof); however, these reductions did not exist in the winter from the white roof (Saiz et al., 2006). Fewer studies have been conducted in tropical climates where there are larger climatic extremes than those found in more temperate regions. Similar to Palomo Del Barrio (1997), Wong et al. (2003) found that in Singapore increasing the soil thickness

11

reduced the heat transfer into the building. However, this correlation was more significant for dry clay soil than 40 percent moisture content clay soil. In this study, Wong et al. (2003) used the DOE-2 energy simulation model to explore the potential energy consumption reduction by installing a green roof on a hypothetical five-storey commercial building in Singapore. Specifically, the study investigated the use of green roofs to decrease heat transfer into the building, reduce energy consumption (which can translate into cost savings), and optimize the roof thermal transfer value (RTTV, also known as R-value). In order to meet the objectives a comparison was conducted on three hypothetical roof types: exposed roof, typical flat roof, and a green roof (on both exposed and typical roofs). The vegetation types for the green roof were turfing, shrubs and trees. The difference between the exposed roof and the typical flat roof is that the exposed roof is a typical concrete roof whereas the typical flat roof includes the filter, drainage, protection, and root membrane layers characteristic of most green roofs. Data from a green roof on a low-rise building in Singapore were used to estimate the Rvalue for input into the model. The results of the model showed that adding vegetation to the roofs reduced the heat transfer through the roof and into the building. The greatest reduction ­ about 15 percent less energy consumption ­ occurred by putting shrubs on the exposed roof. This translated to a cost savings of US$3625 per year. Shrubs also showed 81 percent reduction in peak RTTV. Shrubs have a higher leafarea index (LAI) than turfing and trees, which explains the more significant results compared to other vegetation types. Adding vegetation to the typical flat roof was also beneficial, but the savings were not as significant as those for the exposed roof.

12

Another study conducted in Singapore evaluated the benefits of using a green roof to reduce surface and ambient air temperature and improve air quality (Tan & Sia, 2005). Four types of green roofs were installed on the roof of a multi storey carpark, and each was required to meet 1.5 kN/m2, the maximum structural loading capacity. In order to evaluate the environmental benefits of the green roofs, pre-installation data were compared with post-installation data. The surface temperature of the roof was measured over a period of two months before the installation of the green roofs. After the green roofs were installed the soil temperature and surface temperature of the roof was measured over a period of 12 months. The surface temperature of the green roof was 15ºC to 20ºC cooler than the regular concrete roof. However, after there was no rain for two to three weeks, the soil/substrate temperature (peak temperature 73.4ºC) was higher than the temperature of the original roof. The ambient air temperature at 300 mm and 1200 mm above the roof surface was also measured before and after installation. The ambient air temperature was between 1.7ºC and 3ºC lower with the green roof than with the original roof. Recent green roof research was performed in the subtropical climate of Austin Texas (Simmons, Gardiner, Windhager, & Tinsley, 2008). Surface temperature data were collected from a black roof, a white roof, and multiple green roofs. The black and white roof temperature reached 68ºC and 42ºC respectively whereas the temperature of the green roofs was in the range of 31ºC to 38ºC. However, during cooler weather the temperature of the green roofs was warmer than the other roofs by about 2ºC to 5ºC. Simmons et al. (2008) concluded that there are many factors that contribute to the

13

performance of the green roof. Two of the main factors are climate and design. It is difficult to extrapolate data from one area to determine success or failure of green roofs in another region. It is important to perform green roof experiments in unstudied regions in order to assess the viability of green roofs in many locations. Currently, minimal green roof research has been performed in the subtropical city of Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a very densely populated city with a lot of traffic congestion, poor air quality, and little green space. Ambient temperatures range from approximately 16°C in the winter to almost 30°C in the summer (Hong Kong Observatory, 2010). Installing green roofs in Hong Kong can help mitigate the urban heat island effect, increase the amount of green space available, and reduce the energy consumption of buildings. Because of the lack of green space in Hong Kong, intensive green roofs, as attractive landscaping, have become quite popular (Townshend, 2007). However, extensive green roofs can be installed more widely and therefore can have greater overall benefits. In 2002, an extensive modular green roof was installed on a sloping roof of an office building owned by Gammon-Skanska. Results from the study showed temperature reductions in the soil and ceiling underneath the green roof compared to a similar building without a green roof (Hui, 2006). Jim & Tsang (2011) studied the thermal effect of an experimental intensive green roof, constructed in 2008 on an electricity substation building in Hong Kong, with a 100 cm substrate layer and 5 m to 10 m of native trees. Results over all four seasons showed that the green roof reduced the heat flux into the building during all seasons except winter. During winter, heat loss 14

from the substrate layer of the green roof occurred causing warm indoor air to penetrate outdoors. A recent green roof study on the Oi Kwan Social Services Building in Wan Chai, Hong Kong was conducted in 2008 by K. Hahn, R. Parker, and Dr. J. Li in conjunction with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Results showed lower surface temperatures for the green roofs compared to the control roof (see Chapter 3 for more details); however, energy consumption comparisons were not quantified. Overall, the literature shows that green roofs have the potential to reduce roof surface and indoor air temperature and reduce energy consumption of buildings. This thesis builds on other studies conducted in Hong Kong, but is the first study to investigate, using the EnergyPlus model, the potential energy benefits of installing green roofs on buildings in Hong Kong, and compare, using the EnergyPlus model, the energy performance of multiple alternatives to a green roof.

Chapter 3 ­ Experimental Green Roof Case Study at Oi Kwan
3.1 Background and Green Roof Installation The Hong Kong Polytechnic University retained Ryerson University to assist with a demonstration green roof project at the Oi Kwan social services site in Wan Chai, Hong Kong, a typical building in an old district with high building density and underutilized roofs. The study was initiated to assess the benefits of installing extensive green roofs on older buildings in Hong Kong while minimizing the load on the roof (Hong Kong Polytechnic University, 2008). The demonstration extensive green roof was constructed as a retrofit on the preexisting concrete roof of a 9 storey, twenty-five year old building. The 55 m2 green roof consisted of an aluminum frame with a plastic waterproof membrane to prevent water leakage, followed by a 10 mm thick egg crate layer made of filter fibre to prevent substrate erosion but to allow drainage, followed by a root barrier. The green roof was then subdivided into four sections with varying types of growing media and vegetation, as shown in Figure 3.1. When soil was used as the only substrate, the growing medium was 6 inches thick. When soil and rock wool were combined, the growing medium consisted of 2 inches of rock wool followed by 4 inches of soil on top. Rock wool consists of ground up lava rocks and is a good growing medium for vegetation because it is lighter and capable of retaining more water than soil. The adjacent pre-existing concrete roof was used as the control roof.

The study period was from July 31, 2007 to August 31, 2007; however, data are missing for sub-plots S3 and S4 for part of the study period. Data loggers recorded temperature readings at 20 minute intervals for the surface of each of the four sub-plots and the control roof surface, as well as the indoor air temperature for the rooms underlying each roof type. Each of the four sub-plots had a temperature logger installed at the soil surface, with electronic components housed in waterproof boxes. The same instrument was installed on the concrete roof surface as a control point and all loggers were wired back to a computer, housed in a weatherproof shelter. Calibration tests showed that the margin of error between all sensors was 0.5°C. Additionally, temperature loggers were installed on the soffit surface under the green roof and under

17

the control roof to measure indoor temperatures of the ninth-floor rooms underlying each respective roof type. 3.2 Purpose

The purpose of the Oi Kwan green roof study was to investigate: the effect of different plants and growing media on roof surface temperature; the distribution of time where the maximum temperature is reached for each treatment option; and the effect of retrofit green roofs on underlying room temperature. 3.3 Data Analysis and Results The data were analyzed by looking at the maximum daily temperature for each treatment over a 24 hour time period. The time at which the maximum daily temperature occurred was determined and plotted to examine differences between treatments. Temperature duration curves were created by calculating the frequency of occurrence of all temperature readings recorded throughout the study period occurring at or above various temperatures. 3.3.1 Roof Surface Temperature Figure 3.2 shows the daily maximum surface temperature for the study period. For 26 days out of the 32-day observation period, the maximum daily temperature of the control roof exceeded that of all green roof treatments. The difference in maximum surface temperatures was greatest when ambient air temperature was also high. On 15 percent of the observation days, the control roof maximum daily temperature exceeded

18

50°C. On 46 percent of the observation days, the control roof maximum daily temperature exceeded 40°C. Conversely, on all observation days, the maximum daily temperature for all green roof treatments remained below 37°C. Figure 3.3 shows the temperature duration curve for the control roof and all green roof treatments. The control roof experienced temperature fluctuations between 21°C and 51°C, compared to the green roofs that experienced temperature fluctuations between 26 °C and 36°C. Smaller temperature fluctuations on the green roof indicate that components of the green roof are subject to less thermal stress than the control roof, potentially contributing to greater roof longevity for the green roofs (Liu & Baskaran, 2004). Between the four green roof treatments, Section S1 (grass and soil) generally experienced the highest maximum daily temperature. The maximum daily surface temperatures for Sections S2 (grass and mixed plants with soil) and S3 (grass with soil and rock wool) were approximately 2°C cooler than for S1. Although data were missing for S3 and S4 (grass and mixed plants with soil and rock wool) for part of the study period (due to monitoring equipment malfunction), on 75 percent of the recorded observations, S4 experienced the coolest surface temperatures compared to the other green roof treatments. This suggests that a mixture of plants and including rock wool in the substrate layer may be the most effective green roof design for cooling purposes.

Figure 3.4 shows that approximately 70 percent of the time the control roof reached its maximum temperature between 12:00pm and 3:00pm. The time at which the green roofs reached their maximum temperatures was shifted to later in the day. S1, S2, and S3 reached their maximum temperatures between 3:00pm and 6:00pm 77 percent, 80 percent, and 70 percent of the time. Time-shifting was most pronounced for S4, where 73 percent of the time the maximum temperature occurred between 7:00pm and 10:00pm.

3.3.2 Indoor Room Temperatures Figure 3.5 shows that on 29 out of 32 observation days, the maximum temperatures in the 9th floor room directly under the green roof were 1°C to 6°C lower than the maximum indoor temperatures under the concrete roof (control room). This shows that the high thermal mass of the green roof (compared to the concrete roof) insulates the building, reducing the heat transfer into the building. The green roof also reflects more solar radiation than the concrete roof, reducing the amount of stored heat that can enter the building. On 78 percent of the observation days, the maximum daily temperature in the control room exceeded the ambient maximum daily temperature; whereas on 75 percent of the observation days, the room underneath the green roof was cooler than the ambient maximum daily temperature. There is a stronger correlation between the ambient temperature and the temperature in the control room 22

than with the temperature in the room under the green roofs. On days with higher ambient temperatures, the control room temperature was also elevated. This pattern did not emerge with the room under the green roofs.

The temperature duration curve in Figure 3.6 shows that the temperature fluctuated more in the control room ­ between 25°C and 38°C ­ than in the room underneath the green roof, which fluctuated between 26°C and 32°C. The more constant and lower temperature in the room underneath the green roof could lead to decreased air conditioning demands compared to the control room.

The results of the Oi Kwan study show that green roofs in Hong Kong have the potential to lower roof surface temperatures compared to a conventional roof, as well as lower indoor air temperature by 1°C to 6°C. This can result in tangible cost savings to the building owner. In order to quantify potential energy savings to building owners in Hong Kong, as well as assess other performance measures, a numerical model is beneficial. The Oi Kwan study was limited in that there was a large amount of field data missing; therefore, data collected from another extensive green roof in Hong Kong, the Chuen Seen Mei Chuen (CSMC) green roof, were used for numerical model development and subsequent data analysis, as discussed in Chapter 4.

Chapter 4 ­ Methodology of CSMC Green Roof Analysis
4.1 Site Description The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU) working with the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) installed a 220 m2 extensive green roof in September 2008 on top of a two-storey building at the CSMC location, in downtown Hong Kong. CSMC is a subsidized housing area in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong. The specific building houses a seniors home and an education centre. The seniors home is located on the bottom storey of the building and the after-school education centre is on the top storey of the building. The original roof was a concrete tile roof, as shown in Figure 4.1. Because the building is low-rise, the roof is visible from the surrounding apartment buildings. Installing a green roof provides a good opportunity to improve the aesthetics in the area and increase the green space in addition to reducing the energy consumption of the building. The green roof consisted of a waterproofing layer, followed by a root protection layer, egg-crate drainage layer, filter fabric layer, substrate layer, and vegetation. The substrate ranged from a depth of 75 to 100 mm and comprised of expanded shale, mushroom compost, and other mineral components. The plants used as vegetation for the extensive green roof were: Rhoeo discolor, Sedum lineare, Arachis duranensis, and, Sedum sp. Overall, the added structural load on the building was 0.75 kPa (Li, Wai, & Lam, 2009). To prevent ponding of water, the green roof was designed with a slightly sloped bottom for collection of rainwater. The rainwater was first collected in a granular stone trench and then diverted towards existing roof drains. More details on green roof 25

construction and plant selection can be found in Li, Wai & Lam (2009). Figure 4.1 shows the building before and after green roof construction. In November 2008, an automatic watering system with four sprinklers was installed, and watered the green roof twice daily at 8:00am and 8:00pm, for approximately 20 minutes. Issues arose with the watering system related to timer malfunctioning, battery replacement, and lack of water coverage over the roof. Additional sprinklers were installed in April 2009, including a solar powered water timer to prevent battery changes. Issues still existed; therefore, in May 2009 a new water system was installed with six new sprinklers. In total there were 14 sprinklers and two water systems. More details on the irrigation system are discussed in Li, Wai & Lam (2009).

Green Roof

Figure 4.1: Extensive Green Roof on Senior Home and Education Centre in Hong Kong

Temperature, soil moisture, and air quality data (SO2, CO, NO, NO2, CO2) were collected from the green roof over a period of nine months (October 2008 to June 2009). Green roof and indoor temperature sensors collected data at 20 minute intervals throughout the study period. The location of the roof monitoring equipment is shown on Figure 4.2. Soil temperature and moisture were measured at three locations on the 27

green roof. A weather station was also set up on the roof, which collected local weather data at 30 minute intervals. Air samples were collected weekly from the green roof (near the logo), the ground floor entrance to the building, and at street level near the building. A CO2 sensor was installed on a pole on the roof near the weather station as well as on the first floor of the building to act as a control. Temperature sensors were also placed indoors on both storeys of the building. Four temperature sensors were placed on the ceiling in the seniors home: in the kitchen, at the entrance, inside a room, and on the ceiling. Two temperature sensors were placed on the ceiling in the education centre on the top floor: one in the hallway and one in the classroom. One source of error in this thesis results from issues observed during data collection from the CSMC green roof. Over the period of time in which data were collected the following issues were observed (Li, Wai, & Lam, 2009): Water timers for green roof irrigation did not always function properly. Water sprinklers did not reach all of the areas of the roof. Some plants died as the weather became colder and needed to be replaced. Mushroom weeds appeared in the Sedum lineare region of the green roof which disturbed plant growth. Sedum lineare and Arachis duranensis needed new seeding due to poor plant growth. By October 2009 good plant growth was observed due to the re-seeding. The green roof flooded in August 2009 resulting from filter cloth obstructing the roof drain. 28

Since temperature data were not collected from the roof surface and indoor air prior to green roof construction, control roof data cannot be compared to monitored data after green roof construction, as was performed in the case study discussed in Chapter 3. Therefore, the method adopted was to: model the building with the green roof in a building energy model; compare outputs from the model against monitored data from the green roof in order to calibrate the model; use the calibrated model to model the building without the green roof; compare the outputs from the green roof model against the original roof model to determine if: o there is a reduction in the maximum daily temperature of the green roof compared to the original roof during the data period; o there is apparent time shifting of when the maximum temperature of the green roof is reached compared to the original roof; and o the temperature of the green roof is more constant than the original roof over the data period through use of the temperature duration curve. 4.2 Building Energy Model Comparison The building energy model EnergyPlus is selected for the purpose of modelling the CSMC building after careful review of other comparable building energy models. The building energy models reviewed are BLAST, DOE-2, ECOTECT, and EnergyPlus. 30

The Building Loads Analysis and System Thermodynamics (BLAST) tool was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a joint project between the Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory and the University of Illinois. There are three subprograms in BLAST: Space Loads Prediction, Air System Simulation, and Central Plant. Space Loads Prediction uses weather data to simulate the hourly space load in the building and perform a heat balance on the air in the rooms. Air System Simulation calculates the steam, gas, hot water, chilled water, and electric demands of the air handling system and building. Central Plant then simulates the buil dings fuel consumption (Crawley, Hand, Kummert, & Griffith, 2005). BLAST has mainly been used to size heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment (Sailor, 2008). The most recent version of BLAST was released in 1998 and it is no longer being updated (Crawley et al., 2005). DOE-2 was developed around the same time as BLAST by the Department of Energy (DOE). DOE-2 is considered the industry standard for building energy modelling. Using hourly weather data DOE-2 can determine the hourly energy usage of a building as well as the cost. The model can also be used to help improve energy efficiency by varying building parameters. There are four subprograms for simulation: LOADS, SYSTEMS, PLANT, and ECONOMICS. The output from one subprogram is the input into the next subprogram, in a sequential fashion. The LOADS subprogram calculates for each temperature the hourly heating/cooling load. The SYSTEMS subprogram calculates the performance of secondary systems such as fans, ducts and coils. The PLANT subprogram calculates the performance of primary systems such as

31

chillers, boilers, storage tanks, and cooling towers. The ECONOMICS subprogram then calculates the energy costs. Both DOE-2 and BLAST are good programs for analyzing the energy performance of new and retrofit buildings. (Crawley et al., 2005) ECOTECT was developed by architects and is mainly used by architects, but is gaining popularity among engineers and environmental building designers. Unlike BLAST, DOE-2, and EnergyPlus, ECOTECT is a visual and interactive 3D modelling software tool that has many performance analysis functions (Crawley et al., 2005). Autodesk has recently acquired ECOTECT. The purpose of ECOTECT is to look at the overall building design process in order to create an energy efficient building instead of designing individual parts such as the HVAC system to meet the needs of the building design. Some of the applicable features of ECOTECT are calculation of: internal building temperatures, heat and cooling loads, multi-layer material insulation (used in conjunction with other codes such as EnergyPlus), solar radiation on windows and building surfaces (Autodesk, 2008). Although ECOTECT can perform internal calculations, more technical calculations need to be performed by importing and exporting to other programs such as EnergyPlus, Radiance, NIST FDS etc (Crawley et al., 2005). EnergyPlus, released by the DOE in 2001, combines the best features of BLAST and DOE-2. EnergyPlus is a simulation program and does not have a user interface. It is often combined with a third party interface such as DesignBuilder, but can also be used as a standalone program. Some of the main features of EnergyPlus are: integrated and simultaneous solutions, sub-hourly user defined time steps, transient 32

heat conduction, solution based on heat balance, ground heat transfer modelling, heat and mass transfer model combined, text based weather files, thermal comfort models, advanced fenestration models, daylight controls (e.g., glare simulation), and atmospheric pollution (United States (U.S.) DOE, 2009). One of the main reasons to replace BLAST and DOE-2 is that these models were written in older versions of FORTRAN code, which are becoming obsolete. Similar to BLAST and DOE-2, and unlike ECOTECT, one of the main benefits of EnergyPlus is that is an open source code. The code is available to anyone and can be revised by the public, subject to proper testing and verification. Another benefit of EnergyPlus is that it is built as a modular system, which gives developers and researchers the capability to develop systems independently with minimal interference with other modules. Additionally, in-depth knowledge of the entire program is not necessarily required or necessary (U.S. DOE, 2009). The two main modules of EnergyPlus are the heat and mass balance simulation and the building system simulation. Recently, Sailor (2008) developed a green roof module "eco roof" that has been tested, using data from a field study conducted in Florida, and integrated into EnergyPlus. One of the limitations of the original green roof model in EnergyPlus was that it could only be applied to one green roof at a time (Sailor, 2008). The most recent release of EnergyPlus, released in October 2010, allows for modelling of multiple green roofs. In addition to all of the reasons described above, the DOE has committed to current and future development of EnergyPlus, making it a smart selection for use in this thesis.

EnergyPlus Input Simulation Parameters Using EnergyPlus Version 5.0, the two-storey CSMC building in Hong Kong was

modelled before and after green roof installation. Table 4.1 outlines the categories of information needed to model the building (U.S. DOE, 2010). The main input parameters needed to model the CSMC building are: building dimensions, construction material, roof vegetation, window air conditioner specifications, and weather details for Hong Kong. When modelling the CSMC building in EnergyPlus simplifying assumptions were made. The building was modelled as a simplified two-zone building, meaning that each storey was modelled as an individual zone ­ one open room, instead of partitioned into smaller rooms and stairwells. This assumption allowed the output from the model to be analyzed in a less complicated and more practical manner. The top floor was of more interest in the model than the bottom floor as temperature and energy reduction resulting from green roof installation is more prominent on the storey directly beneath the green roof. The detailed input parameters are included in Appendix A. Although the CSMC building was simplified for modelling purposes, all input parameters were justified through literature values or from assumptions made by the EnergyPlus software.

The CSMC roof ­ prior to addition of the green roof ­ was modelled as a concrete roof structure. Table 4.2 outlines the main properties of the concrete roof. The parameters for concrete were taken from the EnergyPlus data library (M08 200mm lightweight concrete block (filled)).
Table 4.2: Input Parameters for Original Roof Parameter Thickness Conductivity (U value) Density Specific heat Concrete Slab 203.2 cm 0.26 W/m-K 3 464 kg/m 880 J/kg-K

Although a variety of plants ­ Rhoeo discolor, Sedum lineare, Arachis duranensis, and Sedum sp. ­ were used for the green roof, for model simplification, the specific parameters used in the EnergyPlus model were based on the properties of sedum, shown in Table 4.3. The actual soil consisted of expanded shale, mushroom compost, and mineral components, but was modelled in EnergyPlus based on the properties for sandy loam soil, shown in Table 4.3. From the perspective of heat 36

transfer, the most important properties of the vegetation layer are the height of plants, leaf area index (LAI), albedo, and stomatal resistance. The LAI represents the ratio between the leaf surface area and the soil surface area ­ with values typically ranging from 0.5 to five, where the higher the LAI the lower the energy consumption in the summer (Sailor, 2008). The albedo represents the ability of the plant surfaces to reflect solar radiation, and the stomatal resistance represents the rate at which the leafs stomata can transpire moisture. The most important properties of the soil layer are its specific heat capacity, density, and thermal conductivity. The green roof model specified roof irrigation daily at 8:00am and 8:00pm for approximately one hour. Sailor (2008) used 1 cm/week for green roof irrigation for a soil thickness of 0.1 m. Based on Sailor, 0.7 mm per watering period was used as an input to the irrigation schedule for the CSMC green roof model in EnergyPlus. A "smart schedule" was used which only irrigates the green roof if soil moisture is below 30 percent. The moisture level in the soil is automatically calculated by the EnergyPlus model.

For the top floor of the building, a window air conditioning unit was simulated using a schedule in EnergyPlus on weekdays from 8:00am until 7:00pm, from the beginning of April until the end of September. The main input components for a window air conditioner are the maximum supply air flow rate, the maximum outdoor air flow rate, and the availability schedule. Associated with each window air conditioner, EnergyPlus requires specifications for an outdoor air mixer, a fan, and a direct expansion cooling coil (U.S. DOE, 2010). Details for all of these components are specified in Appendix A. EnergyPlus has compiled weather data for Hong Kong over selected years during 1982 to 2003, which is available for download in EnergyPlus weather format2. The weather file includes information such as temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. This file was modified to use the climate data

38

(temperature, dew point, and relative humidity) collected from the on-site meteorological station. The modified file was used in the EnergyPlus simulations for model calibration. 4.4 Sensitivity Analysis In order to test model performance, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on key parameters. Key parameters tested were related to green roof specifications, building construction material, and the HVAC system. Specifically the effect of varying soil thickness and LAI for the green roof, conductivity of the concrete material, and fan flow rate in the HVAC system were tested for model stability. Table 4.4 presents the values used for each sensitivity analysis simulation. The sensitivity analysis was performed using the "Parametric:SetValueForRun" function in EnergyPlus. This function allows the user to run the model multiple times by changing the value of one parameter. The energy consumption output from the model ­ from the months April through September ­ was then analyzed to determine if the energy consumption was affected by the changing values for each parameter. The bold values in Table 4.4 represent the baseline values used in the model. Figure 4.3 to Figure 4.5 show the results of the sensitivity analyses based on the difference in energy consumption between the baseline value and the adjusted values. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that as soil thickness and LAI for the green roof increase, energy consumption decreases, consistent with results identified by Palomo Del Barrio (1997). As shown on Figure 4.3 to Figure 4.5, the relationship between energy consumption and LAI is more linear than the relationship between energy consumption and soil thickness. For the regular concrete roof, as conductivity 39

increases the energy consumption increases as well; however the energy difference between 0.16 W/m-K and the baseline conductivity (0.26 W/m-K) is greater than the energy difference between 0.36 W/m-K and the baseline conductivity. The fan flow rate does not affect the energy consumption of the building; as such the value selected for the flow rate is not critical.

Model Calibration The calibration process was executed by first identifying the input parameters in

EnergyPlus that have a strong influence on temperature and energy usage. Sun & Reddy (2006) discuss some of the common sensitive parameters in building energy simulation programs. After strongly influential parameters were identified (Table 4.5), these values were adjusted through a trial and error approach in order to obtain a model that matched existing monitoring data.

The model was calibrated using the green roof surface temperature as well as indoor temperature data collected over February and June 2009, after green roof installation, from the top floor of the building. Calibration was limited as green roof surface temperature data only exist for the month of June. As such predicted rooftop data from the green roof model in EnergyPlus can only be compared to one month of monitoring data. Roof surface and indoor temperature data do not exist prior to green roof installation; therefore, the model was calibrated by comparing the temperature data predicted by the model with the green roof against monitored data collected from the green roof. The objective is for the predicted indoor air temperatures from the model to match the field data collected to a certain degree of error ­ the root mean square (RMS) 42

error of the data points should be less than or equal to ± 20 percent, consistent with the RMS error used by Sailor (2008). The fractional error between the data points was first calculated, followed by the percent RMS error according to the following equations:

where, TError Tmodelled Tmonitored = fractional difference between the modelled and monitored temperatures = the predicted indoor temperature from the EnergyPlus model (ºC) = the indoor temperature collected from monitoring data (ºC)

The results of the calibration are presented in Section 5.1. Once the models are calibrated they can be used to analyze a wide range of situations without having to collect field data over an extended period of time. 4.6 Scenario Analysis The calibrated models described in Section 4.5 were used for analysis of certain scenarios. Although a meteorological station was set up on the edge of the roof of the CSMC building, EnergyPlus does not recommend using data from a one year period in the EnergyPlus simulation model (Crawley, 1998). Data from one year cannot represent long term weather patterns, whereas data over many years will predict energy consumption that is more representative of the site over the long-term. Therefore, once the model was calibrated, the Hong Kong weather file from EnergyPlus was used for the scenario analysis. The climate data in the EnergyPlus weather file were obtained from 43

a meteorological station at 22.32 N, 114.17 E, which is in the same vicinity as the CSMC building. The green roof model was used to predict the energy savings of the building by using a green roof during the months where air conditioning is used (April through September). This was compared to the predicted energy consumption from the model without the green roof over the same time frame. The reduction in energy usage in the building was translated into tangible cost savings, by using the cost outlined by the Hong Kong Electric Company of 124.1 HKcents per kWh or CAD$0.15/kWh (HK Electric, 2011). Using a green roof may not be the best method to reduce the energy consumption of the CSMC building. Therefore, the building model was used to compare the temperature differences, predicted energy consumption and associated operational cost of a green roof against other alternatives such as: cool roof (reflective roof); insulation layer; and reflective windows. The effect of irrigation on green roof performance was also studied by running a simulation with different irrigation schedules and quantities of water per irrigation cycle.

44

4.6.1 Cool Roof Many standard dark roofs use materials that absorb solar radiation; however, materials that reflect solar radiation reduce the amount of heat that enters a building. Reflective roofing materials are also referred to as cool roofs. Jo et al. (2010) conducted an experiment on a commercial building in Arizona comparing a cool roof to a typical roof and found approximately 1.5 percent cost reduction in monthly electricity usage by covering 50 percent of the surface with a cool roof coating. The cool roof surface used in that experiment was white 3/8" (0.95 cm) marble roofing aggregate with specifications from the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC). The CRRC (n.d.), a product rating system in the United States, has developed standard methods to rate the radiative properties ­ solar reflectance and thermal emittance ­ of materials used for cool roofs. The cool roof specifications used in Jo et al. (2010) were used as inputs to the CSMC EnergyPlus model (Table 4.6) to determine if a cool roof would provide greater energy and cost savings than the green roof. Low thermal and solar absorptance are important characteristics for cool roofs. A roof that reflects most of the solar radiation will transfer less heat into the building. Furthermore, roofs with low thermal absorptance will reach thermal equilibrium at a lower surface temperature than a roof with high thermal absorptance. Once thermal equilibrium is reached the surface temperature of the roof stops increasing. The R-value of building insulation is a measure of the ability of a material to stop heat flow (U.S. EPA, 2008). The cool roof properties were entered in the Material:NoMass class in EnergyPlus.

45

4.6.2 Insulation Layer Adding additional insulation to a roof is another method to reduce surface temperature and energy consumption. Cool roofs reflect solar radiation; however, they do not prevent thermal heat loss from buildings. Bianchi et al. (2007) concluded that similar energy requirements are needed for a cool roof as by adding minimal insulation to a typical dark roof membrane. Adding an insulation layer to a typical dark roof can reduce heat loss, especially during the cooler months. Considering the mild winter climate in Hong Kong, this is not a concern; however, adding an insulation layer can also reduce thermal heat gain into the building during the summer months. Insulation is described mainly in terms of its R-value, the ability of a material to resist heat flow. The higher the R-value, the greater the material resists heat flow. Polyisocyanurate (polyiso) insulation typically has an R-value from R-5.6 to R-8 (or R0.98 to R-1.4 in metric units) per inch of insulation (U.S. DOE, 2011a) ­ one of the highest R-values compared to other types of insulation. It contains a low conductivity gas that is non-ozone depleting and has low global warming potential ­ until recently the polyiso industry was using hydrochloroflourocarbons. The insulation layer was added in EnergyPlus using the Material:NoMass class, since polyiso is described mainly in terms of its R-value (see Table 4.7). In the EnergyPlus simulation, the insulation was installed below the roof membrane. 46

Table 4.7: Input Parameters for Added Roof Insulation Parameter R-value Polyiso Roof Insulation 2 1.4 m -K/W

4.6.3 Reflective Windows Reflective films can be added onto windows to reduce the heat transmitted into buildings during the summer months. Reflective windows block solar radiation during the winter months (U.S. DOE, 2011b); however, since the weather in Hong Kong is typically mild during the winter, this is not a significant concern. A pyrolytic titanium coating for windows ­ selected from the EnergyPlus library ­ was used to model the CSMC building to determine if greater energy savings are obtained by using reflective windows or a green roof. The window specifications are shown in Table 4.8 and entered in the WindowMaterial:Glazing class in EnergyPlus.

Chapter 5 ­ Results and Discussion
5.1 Model Calibration Results Air conditioning was specified in the model from April to September; therefore, calibration was performed during a summer month (June) when air conditioning was used and during a winter month (February) when air conditioning was not used. The adequacy of the model is discussed in terms of both roof surface temperature and indoor air temperature. 5.1.1 Summer Month The green roof model was calibrated over June 2009. The green roof model was compared to monitoring data collected in June 2009 from the green roof surface and the rooms below the green roof. Indoor air monitoring data were collected from a classroom and the hallway in the CSMC building, averaged together and compared against data predicted from the EnergyPlus green roof model. Figure 5.1 presents both monitored and predicted green roof surface temperature data together over the month of June. Figure 5.2 presents both monitored and predicted indoor air temperature data over the month of June for the area directly below the green roof. The predicted temperature data from EnergyPlus follow the same pattern as the monitored data. Occasionally, the green roof model over-predicted the roof surface temperature data and other times under-predicted the roof surface temperature data. For the indoor air temperature data, the monitored data are consistently higher than the predicted data. This pattern follows throughout the month of June.

48

Both figures present ambient air temperature as measured from the weather station on the CSMC roof. The predicted and monitored temperature data both generally peak after the ambient air temperature peaks, as shown on Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2. There are exceptions, such as June 26th and 27th where the predicted indoor air temperature fluctuates throughout the day, but the monitored indoor temperature is fairly constant. The ambient air temperature shows fluctuations on those days although much lower than the predicted indoor air temperature. This pattern could point to issues in the monitoring data collected on those days.

The relationship between predicted and monitored green roof surface temperature data is shown in Figure 5.3. Similarly, the relationship between predicted and monitored indoor air temperature data is shown in Figure 5.4. The linear line shows the ideal scenario, if the predicted and monitored data were the same. The dots represent all of the temperature data from the month of June. The closer the dots are to the linear line, the more similar the predicted and monitored data. There are times throughout the month of June where the predicted and monitored data closely align and other times where they are farther apart. Overall, the results of the calibration show that the total RMS error of the roof surface temperature and the indoor air temperature for the month of June were ± 16 percent and ± 10 percent, respectively. The RMS error was calculated according to the method described in Section 4.5. The results fit within the acceptable margin of error of ± 20 percent stated in Section 4.5. To illustrate the typical daily temperature trend, Figure 5.5 and Figure 5.6 present the surface and indoor air temperature trend over one day, June 21st (when air conditioning was not used). The roof and indoor air temperature are lowest in the early morning, approximately at 6:00am. As the day progresses the temperature slowly increases. The roof surface temperature peaks at approximately 12:00pm to 1:00pm and the indoor air temperature peaks at approximately 5:00pm. The roof surface and indoor air temperature slowly decrease throughout the night. At approximately 12:00pm, the maximum monitored roof surface temperature is 39.3°C and the maximum predicted roof surface temperature is 36.4°C. At approximately 5:00pm, the maximum

51

monitored indoor temperature is 33.9°C and the maximum predicted indoor temperature is 31.3°C.

5.1.2 Winter Month The green roof model was also compared to monitoring data during February 2009, a winter month where air conditioning was not used. The purpose was to determine the adequacy of the green roof model under simplified conditions. Roof surface temperature data were not available; therefore only the indoor air temperature data were used for this scenario. Indoor monitoring data were collected from a classroom and the hallway in the CSMC building, averaged together and compared against data predicted from the EnergyPlus green roof model. Figure 5.7 presents both monitored and predicted indoor air temperature data as well as ambient air temperature collected from the meteorological station on the CSMC roof over the month of February. As shown on Figure 5.7, the predicted indoor air temperature data from EnergyPlus fluctuate throughout the day, whereas the monitored indoor air temperature data remain more constant. This difference can be attributed to issues identified at the CSMC, such as malfunctioning of the watering system and plant death, especially during the month of February. Additionally, with exception of a few days in the middle of February, the ambient air temperature fluctuates in the same pattern as the predicted indoor air temperature from the model, providing more confidence in the modelling results. The relationship between predicted and monitored indoor air temperature data is shown in Figure 5.8. There are times throughout the month of February where the predicted and monitored data closely align and other times where they are farther apart. The results of the calibration show that the total RMS error of the indoor air temperature

54

for the month of February was ± 11 percent. The RMS error was calculated according to the method described in Section 4.5. The results meet the acceptable margin of error of ± 20 percent stated in Section 4.5. Overall, the green roof model seems to be able to predict the indoor air temperature more accurately during the summer months than in the winter months.

Green Roof Data Analysis After determining the EnergyPlus green roof model was acceptable (Section 5.1),

the outputs from the model were used to compare the potential benefit of having a green roof at the CSMC site to the original roof prior to green roof construction. This assessment was performed by comparing the maximum daily temperature (from hourly data) for the green roof against the original roof. The time the maximum temperature was reached was plotted to examine potential time shifting. Temperature duration curves were also plotted to assess the frequency at which temperatures were exceeded throughout the study period. 5.2.1 Roof Surface Temperature The maximum temperature in a twenty-four hour period is referred to as the daily maximum temperature. Since monitored green roof surface temperature data are only available for June 2009, the results from that time period are presented and discussed here. Figure 5.9 shows that according to the model the predicted surface temperature of the original roof consistently exceeded the predicted surface temperature of the green roof for all 30 days in June, which is consistent with previous research reported by Simmons et al. (2008), Saiz et al. (2006), Liu & Minor (2005), Tan & Sia (2005), and Kohler (2002). Ninety percent of the time the predicted temperature of the original roof exceeded the monitored temperature of the green roof. The maximum predicted temperature of the original roof occurred on June 30th and was 69°C, compared to a predicted temperature of 52°C for the green roof on the same day, a 17°C difference, which is consistent to what is found in literature as shown in Table 5.1.

Figure 5.9 also presents the ambient air temperature collected from the meteorological station on the CSMC roof during the month of June. The ambient air temperature and monitored green roof surface temperature generally follow the same temperature pattern throughout the month, showing confidence in the green roof surface temperature data collected in June. Solar radiation dominates the energy balance of a roof. The original roof has low solar reflectivity, and therefore absorbs much of the solar radiation hitting the roof, resulting in high temperatures on the roof surface. Conversely, plants on green roofs reflect some of the solar radiation. Some of the radiation that is not reflected by plants is emitted from the soil surface as long-wave (thermal) radiation and sensible heat. Some of the solar radiation is also dissipated into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration (latent heat) from the soil and plant surfaces. Overall, a small amount of energy is absorbed by the soil which can then make its way into the building below (Sailor, 2008). 58

Figure 5.9: Maximum Daily Roof Surface Temperature (June 2009)

Figure 5.10 presents the frequency at which the maximum daily temperature is reached at a specific time. The green roof reaches its predicted maximum surface temperatures between 11:00am and 6:00pm, later than the original roof which reaches its maximum surface temperatures between 10:00am and 4:00pm. For the monitored data, the time at which the maximum temperature is reached is more spread out throughout the day ­ mainly between 9:00am and 4:00pm ­ than the predicted time from the green roof model. The temperature duration curves in Figure 5.11 show the percentage of days in June 2009 that the green roof and original roof exceeded a certain temperature. Over the month of June, temperatures fluctuated on the original roof from 18°C to 69°C. Temperatures fluctuated on the green roof from 22°C to 52°C, a 21°C smaller difference. Monitored temperatures on the green roof fluctuated between 24°C and 59

36°C. The original roof cools off quickly at night because of its low thermal mass; therefore easily emitting long-wave radiation. The green roof remains warmer at night because of stored energy. Overall, the green roof remains at a cooler and more consistent temperature than the original roof. Large temperature variation can decrease roof longevity. Frequent expansion and contraction can increase thermal stress potentially lead to cracking, resulting in more frequent maintenance and/or roof replacement. Maintaining a more constant temperature through installing green roofs can potentially improve roof longevity and reduce frequent maintenance (Johnston & Newton, 1996; Liu & Baskaran, 2004).

5.2.2 Indoor Air Temperature The predicted indoor air temperature for the rooms directly underneath the green roof was compared to the predicted indoor air temperature for the rooms directly underneath the original roof. In EnergyPlus the top floor was modelled as one open area instead of partitioned into separate rooms. The indoor air temperature was analyzed to determine if the green roof is effective in lowering the indoor air temperature. As shown on Figure 5.12, the predicted indoor air temperature under the green roof is between 0°C and 3°C cooler than the predicted indoor air temperature under the original roof. Figure 5.12 also presents the ambient air temperature collected from the meteorological station on the CSMC roof during the month of June. Throughout the month of June the temperature in the room below the original roof is above the ambient air temperature and the temperature in the room below the green

61

roof is below the ambient air temperature. The green roof can help keep the room cooler than the outside temperature. For 80 percent of the days in June, the monitored indoor air temperature under the green roof follows a similar pattern as the predicted temperature; however, the monitored temperature is not always below the predicted temperature of the room below the original roof. This difference can be attributed to the air conditioning in the room, which was modelled based on assumptions on the air conditioning system at CSMC. During a day where air conditioning was not used ­ on the weekend ­ the predicted and monitored indoor air temperatures follow the same pattern, where the temperature increases as the day progresses, peaks during midday and decreases towards nighttime (Figure 5.13). The monitored temperature peaks at an earlier time than the predicted temperature, but at approximately the same temperature (31°C), which is lower than the predicted temperature (34°C) in the room under the original roof.

The temperature duration curves (Figure 5.14) show that there is not an appreciable difference in the indoor air temperature fluctuations in the room below the green roof and original roof. This results from the use of air conditioning which maintains the temperature fairly constant. Comparison in HVAC energy usage is a more appropriate performance measure between the green roof and the original roof. Energy usage is discussed when comparing the energy consumption of various alternatives in Section 5.3.

Comparison to Other Alternatives As discussed in Section 4.6, the EnergyPlus building model was used to

compare the performance of various alternatives to a green roof. Although green roofs have benefits other than energy savings, such as reduction in the urban heat island effect, reduction in storm water runoff, and increase in available green space, the 64

alternatives were compared in terms of energy benefits. The alternatives assessed were a cool roof, an added insulation layer, and reflective windows. The performance measures assessed were temperature duration (for roof surface and indoor air), predicted monthly energy consumption and cost of various alternatives to a green roof. These alternatives were compared from April through September, the months where the CSMC building uses air conditioning. The specific details and inputs into the model are presented in Section 4.6. The results of the analysis are presented in the following sections. 5.3.1 Temperature Duration The roof surface temperature was compared for the green roof, original roof, and cool roof. Roof insulation and reflective windows were only considered for their effects on indoor air temperature. The temperature duration curves from April to September (Figure 5.15 to Figure 5.20) show larger surface temperature fluctuations for the cool roof and original roof than for the green roof. In April, the green roof surface temperature fluctuates from 17°C to 42°C, a difference of 25°C; the cool roof surface temperature fluctuates from 14°C to 58°C, a difference of 44°C; and the original roof surface temperature fluctuates from 13°C to 63°C, a difference of 50°C. The same pattern follows for the rest of the months with the temperature difference on the roof being greatest for the original roof, lowest for the green roof, and approximately in the middle for the cool roof. The original roof has low thermal mass and cools quickly at night-time, giving off long-wave radiation. The cool roof has high solar reflectivity; therefore, it does not

65

absorb as much solar radiation as the original roof, but it also cools down quickly at night. The green roof reflects much of the solar radiation, but the radiation that is absorbed by the soil is not easily released at night resulting in potentially higher temperatures at night-time than the original and cool roof. In June, the temperature duration curve for the monitored green roof temperature data correlates well with the temperature duration curve for the predicted green roof temperature data.

The indoor air temperature was compared for the green roof, original roof, cool roof, insulation layer, and reflective windows. The temperature duration curves (Figure 5.21 to Figure 5.26) from April to September show that the indoor temperature fluctuates the most under the original roof and with the reflective windows over the six month period. The indoor temperature fluctuates the least under the cool roof, followed by added roof insulation, and then green roof. This pattern follows for all of the months where air conditioning is used, except for April where there is minimal difference between the temperature duration of the cool roof, green roof, and roof insulation layer. The indoor air temperature results do not correlate with the roof surface temperature results. For the roof temperature, the green roof surface temperature fluctuates less than the cool roof surface temperature; however, for the indoor air temperature, the temperature in the room below the cool roof remains more constant 69

than the temperature in the room below the green roof over the six month study period where air conditioning was used. Although the temperature in the room under the cool roof was more constant than the temperature in the room under the green roof, this difference was only by approximately 1°C. Conclusions on the comparison of the various alternatives is difficult to make when looking at the temperature differences alone because of the air conditioning which set the indoor air temperature at 26°C during weekdays from 8:00am until 7:00pm. In the next section the monthly energy consumption of the HVAC system for the various alternatives is discussed in order to provide a better understanding on the most feasible alternative.

5.3.2 Energy and Cost Comparison This section discusses the monthly HVAC energy usage and associated cost for the green roof, original roof, cool roof, roof insulation, and reflective windows over the six month period from April to September, when air conditioning is used. HVAC usage is based on the assumption that air conditioning is used five days a week from 8:00am until 7:00pm, on the top floor of the CSMC building. For the purposes of this analysis, cost is defined in terms of construction, operation, and maintenance costs only. The replacement frequency for each alternative is also considered. All cost values are reported in Canadian dollars. For the green roof, the cost of irrigation is included in the calculations based on a rate of $0.51/m3 (Water Supplies Department, 2011). The electricity cost is $0.15/kWh (HK Electric, 2011).

73

Table 5.2 presents a summary of the monthly energy usage (in kWh) in the top floor of the CSMC building. Figure 5.27 and Figure 5.28 summarize HVAC energy usage and associated operational cost (including irrigation for the green roof) in bar graphs. The annual HVAC energy usage for the green roof is 2592 kWh +/437 kWh/199 kWh. The uncertainty is based on differences in conductivity values for the building construction material (concrete). The cost associated with the HVAC energy usage (including irrigation cost) for the green roof is $420.69 +/- $53/$24.

Figure 5.28: Monthly Operational Cost for Various Alternatives

Over the six month period the cool roof consumes the least amount of energy. In total, the cool roof uses 184 kWh less than the green roof, 110 kWh less than the added roof insulation, 376 kWh less than the reflective windows and 416 kWh less than the original roof. The cool roof is the most energy efficient option for the entire six month period, although the difference is more significant during the hotter months of June,

75

July, and August. The green roof may require more energy to cool the building than the cool roof because the insulation provided by the soil layer prevents the green roof from cooling down at night to a temperature as low as the cool roof. As such, more energy would be required to cool the room underneath the green roof to a specified temperature than the room underneath the cool roof. With respect to operational cost (HVAC energy usage), the cool roof is also the most cost efficient alternative. Over the six month period, the cool roof costs $55 less than the green roof, $17 less than roof insulation, $57 less than reflective windows, and $63 less than the original roof. The added cost of roof irrigation contributes to the green roof becoming less cost effective during the operational period of the building. Cost benefit analysis (CBA) is a decision making tool used to weigh several alternatives to determine which is worth pursuing. CBA quantifies both cost and benefits in terms of dollar value ­ expressed as net present value including a discount rate (City of Toronto & OCE-ETech, 2005). A full CBA was not conducted. Rather, a life cycle cost assessment was conducted that looked at construction, maintenance, HVAC energy usage, and replacement costs for the following alternatives: original roof only; green roof only; original roof with reflective layer (cool roof); and original roof with added insulation.

76

Since reflective windows do not seem to provide greater energy savings than the original roof during the operational phase, reflective windows were not included in the life cycle cost assessment. Evaluating the benefits of each alternative in terms of economically relevant factors was outside the scope of this thesis; however, a full CBA would be beneficial in future research on the viability of different alternatives for reducing energy consumption of buildings, as discussed in Section 6.2. Adams & Marriott (2008) reported that in Portland a conventional roof has a construction cost of $107.64/m2 and a green roof with minimal soil and vegetation has a construction cost of $169.53/m2. Maintenance for a green roof would involve visual inspection twice yearly, plant and irrigation maintenance and costs approximately $0.27/m2. Maintenance for a conventional roof would also occur twice yearly and costs approximately $0.11/m2 (Adams & Marriott, 2008). Townshend (2007) reported that in Hong Kong an extensive green roof costs between $49 and $122/m2. Maintenance costs for an extensive green roof in Hong Kong range from $0.10/m² per year and $0.28/m² per year. For the green roof, local costs as estimated by Townshend (2007) are used in this life cycle cost assessment. Initial cost of a cool roof ranges from $8.07/m2 to $16.15/m2 on top of the cost of a conventional roof. Maintenance involves occasional washing of the roof to maintain solar reflectivity of the coating (U.S. EPA, 2008). A cool roof needs to be replaced after approximately 20 years (Environmental and Energy Study Institute, 2011). Polyiso insulation costs approximately $34.12/m2 (Zero By Degrees, 2009). Reflective windows cost between $40 and $60 per window (PowerHouse, 2011). 77

The cost selected for each alternative is outlined in Table 5.3. Local Hong Kong costs are available for the green roof only. Costs used for alternatives are taken from other regions and are provided for comparison purposes. The discount rate used in order to calculate the net present value was the prime rate in Hong Kong of 5.25% (Public Bank Hong Kong, 2011). A 40 year time horizon was used. Figure 5.29 shows the net present value for each alternative over a 40 year time horizon. Figure 5.29 shows that after 20 years the green roof becomes more financially viable than the alternatives. This is mainly due to the replacement frequency of the green roof, which is 40 years, compared to 20 years for all of the alternatives.

5.3.2.1 Comparison to Existing Energy Bills Energy bills from the top floor of the CSMC building are available for April to July 2009. Table 5.4 provides a comparison of the predicted cost of HVAC from the EnergyPlus CSMC green roof model to the existing energy bills. According to the EnergyPlus CSMC green roof model approximately 52 percent of the energy consumption goes towards the HVAC system, with the remainder attributed to lighting. This does not factor in electricity usage from computers and other appliances. However, assuming the HVAC system comprises approximately 52 percent of the energy bill, the predicted cost does correlate with the actual cost obtained from the energy bills during May and July.

Green Roof Irrigation Since green roof irrigation does contribute to the operational cost of the green

roof, the sensitivity of the irrigation schedule was analyzed to determine if reducing the amount of irrigation affected overall green roof performance. In the base case, the green roof was irrigated daily at 8:00am and 8:00pm for approximately one hour and 0.7 mm per watering period. A "smart schedule" was used which only irrigates the green roof if soil moisture is below 30 percent. Based on the above scenario the total water used from April to September was 53.8 m3. The following alternate irrigation schedules were investigated: irrigation once daily at 8:00am (0.7 mm for 1 hour); irrigation twice daily at 8:00am and 8:00pm (0.35 mm for 1 hour each); irrigation once daily at 8:00am (0.35 mm for 1 hour); and no irrigation. Figure 5.30 shows that irrigation has minimal impact on the overall HVAC energy performance and operational cost. When less water was used for irrigation the water 80

cost decreased, but the overall HVAC energy usage increased; therefore, the overall cost was not impacted significantly as shown in Figure 5.30. Overall, the number of watering times a day and amount of irrigation do not strongly influence the total cost associated with operating the building.

Chapter 6 ­ Conclusions and Recommendations
6.1 Conclusions In order to investigate and estimate the potential energy benefits of installing extensive green roofs on buildings in Hong Kong two case studies of extensive green roofs were analyzed. The Oi Kwan case study not only compared the thermal performance of green roofs to a typical concrete roof, but assessed the performance between different types of green roofs. The study concluded that green roofs were successful in reducing roof surface temperatures, delaying the time at which the maximum surface temperature is reached, and contributing to a cooler indoor air temperature for the room directly below the green roof. Additionally, using a combination of plants and rock wool in the substrate layer improved green roof thermal performance. In order to quantify potential energy savings to building owners in Hong Kong, as well as assess other performance measures, a numerical model is beneficial. Since data were limited in the Oi Kwan study, the CSMC green roof was used for numerical model development and subsequent data analysis. The CSMC green roof not only looked at surface and indoor air temperature reductions from using a green roof instead of the original roof, but also quantified these reductions in terms of energy and cost savings. EnergyPlus was successfully used to model the two-storey CSMC building in downtown Hong Kong with its existing green roof and its previous concrete roof. The building was simplified by focusing the modelling on the top storey and assuming the floor was one open room. EnergyPlus is a useful building energy simulation model; however, it has a steep learning curve. One benefit of the program is that it has a built82

in "eco roof" function. Additionally, once the building model is complete, it is more straight-forward to modify specific parameters such as replacing the green roof with a cool roof or changing the irrigation schedule for the green roof. For model calibration, monitored temperature data were compared to predicted temperature data from the EnergyPlus model during June, a summer month when air conditioning was used, and February, a winter month where air conditioning was not used. For June, the results of the calibration show that the total RMS error of the roof surface temperature and the indoor air temperature were ± 16 percent and ± 10 percent, respectively. For February, the results of the calibration show that the total RMS error of the indoor air temperature was ± 11 percent. The predicted temperature data met the monitored temperature data within the acceptable margin of error of ± 20 percent, showing that the simplifying assumptions were valid. The green roof was compared to the original roof by assessing the following performance measures: maximum daily temperature, time at which maximum temperature was reached, and temperature duration (for roof surface and indoor air). The performance of the green roof was also compared to the original roof, cool roof, roof insulation, and reflective windows by evaluating the temperature duration (for roof surface and indoor air), predicted monthly energy consumption and associated operational cost for each alternative. A life cycle cost assessment was also conducted that looked at construction, maintenance, HVAC energy usage, and replacement costs. The main conclusions of this thesis are:

83

During the summer month of June, the monitored and predicted surface temperature of the green roof at the CSMC was consistently below the predicted surface temperature of the original roof. The maximum predicted temperature of the original roof occurred on June 30th and was 69°C, compared to a predicted temperature of 52°C for the green roof on the same day. The green roof model shows time-shifting as to the time of day that the green roof reaches its maximum surface temperature (between 11:00am and 6:00pm) compared to the original roof (between 10:00am and 4:00pm). This is a benefit to the consumer when time-of-use meters are used such as in Ontario; however these meters are not currently used in Hong Kong. The surface temperature duration curve show larger temperature fluctuations for the original roof (51°C) than for the green roof (30°C), during the month of June. For the green roof this was the case for both predicted and monitored data. The green roof remains at a cooler and more consistent temperature than the original roof. When compared to the cool roof, the cool roof exhibits greater temperature fluctuations than the green roof. There is not an appreciable difference in the indoor air temperature fluctuations in the room below the green roof and original roof; however, this results from the use of air conditioning which maintains the temperature fairly constant at 26°C. The indoor air temperature duration curves for the room under the cool roof do not correlate with the surface temperature duration curves. The surface

84

temperature of the cool roof fluctuates more than the green roofs temperature; however, the indoor air temperature of the room under the cool roof is more constant that the indoor air temperature of the room under the green roof. Temperature duration is not the most effective performance measure for indoor air temperature when air conditioning is used, but energy consumption can draw better conclusions. From April to September, the cool roof consumes the least amount of energy (in terms of air conditioning usage), although it is more pronounced during the hotter months of June, July, and August. It uses 110 kWh less than the added roof insulation, 184 kWh less than the green roof, 376 kWh less than the reflective windows and 416 kWh less than the original roof. In terms of operational cost only, the cool roof is the most cost efficient alternative. From April to September, the cool roof costs $55 less than the green roof, $63 less than the original roof, $57 less than reflective windows, and $17 less than roof insulation. The life cycle cost assessment shows that after 20 years the green roof becomes more financially viable than the alternatives (original roof, cool roof, and roof insulation). A full CBA was not performed. Overall, using a green roof does reduce heat flux into the building when compared to a traditional roof; however, green roofs are not the only viable

85

option. Cool roofs can provide greater energy savings, especially during the summer months and do not have the added cost of roof irrigation. 6.2 Recommendations

6.2.1 Cost Benefit Analysis The cost comparison between the green roof, original roof, cool roof, and roof insulation discussed in this thesis only takes into account the cost associated with construction, maintenance, HVAC energy usage, and replacement cost. In order to compare the various alternatives in more detail to draw conclusions on the preferable alternative for wide-scale implementation in Hong Kong, a full CBA should be performed ­ including all economically relevant factors during installation, building operation, and ongoing maintenance. The assessment in this thesis only included costs and not benefits. In order to calculate the payback period the benefits associated with each option should be quantified in terms of cost. Green roofs have certain benefits that the other options do not have, such as storm water retention, aesthetic appeal, and air quality improvement. Additionally, cool roofs may not be practical in such a highly urbanized city as Hong Kong because of the visual distraction from the reflective coating. Compared to a typical roof and cool roof, green roofs retain a much higher percentage of storm water. Energy and insulation and air quality are other economically relevant factors that Carter and Keeler (2008) included in their CBA. Peck and Callaghan (1999) also suggested aesthetic appeal, increased property value, and business related cost savings as economically relevant factors.

86

Once all economically relevant factors are defined, the cost for each should be defined over the defined time horizon. The recommended time horizon is 40 years, as that is the typical lifespan for a green roof (City of Toronto & OCE-ETech, 2005; Carter & Keeler, 2008). This thesis only analyzed the energy performance for each alternative and found that looking at that factor alone; the green roof was not the most cost effective option. However, performing a CBA will include all economically relevant factors, including social factors, to determine if installing green roofs in Hong Kong is feasible or if another option, such as cool roofs is more practical. 6.2.2 Building Types Intensive green roofs have gained popularity in Hong Kong, mainly due to their aesthetic benefits; however, extensive green roofs, which are popular in other countries due to their energy savings benefits, are less common in Hong Kong. The feasibility and applicability of installing extensive green roofs, to promote energy savings in Hong Kong, is extremely dependent on the building type. Installing green roofs in the Old City Centre may not be practical because of the very tall and narrow high-rise buildings with very little roof space. Additionally, the energy benefits from green roofs are not as pronounced on high-rise buildings that are 10 to 50 storeys, compared to low-rise buildings. The New City Centre, where the CSMC building is located, has more opportunity for green roof construction because of larger rooftop footprint. Extensive green roofs can be very beneficial to existing lower maintenance buildings because of the lower roof load, limited required maintenance, and energy benefits (Townshend,

87

2007). The conclusions drawn from this thesis are most applicable to other low-rise buildings in Hong Kong with similar characteristics. In order to draw conclusions regarding wide-scale implementation of extensive green roofs in Hong Kong other studies should be conducted to look at potential energy savings for other building types. Alternatives, such as cool roofs, should also be examined for other building types to see which alternative provides the greatest energy and cost savings.
