Femtosecond Laser Machining at Submicron and Nano Scale
Alireza Dalili, Master of Applied Science, 2009 Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Ryerson University

Abstract
The arrival of the femtosecond laser with a MHz repetition rate has provided the industry with a new tool to conduct submicron and nano scale machining. Several advantages such as high quality machining finish, good precision and high throughput can be obtained when using femtosecond laser to conduct nanomachining over lithography techniques currently in use. High repetition rate systems are preferred over low repetition rate femtosecond laser systems that have been studied by others due to their increased stability, speed, quality and discovery of new phenomena such as ripples and grains.

This thesis proposes a high repetition rate fiber femtosecond laser system for meeting the above-mentioned conditions. The influence of the laser repetition rate and pulse energy on the size and quality of nano features fabricated on silicon wafers was investigated. Higher repetition rates led to smaller cutlines with uniform width. A 110 nm crater with a small heat affected zone of 0.79 11m was obtained at 13 MHz repetition rate and 2.042 J/cm energy fluence. In terms of nanomachining below the ablation threshold (surface patterning), the influence of pulse width, repetition rate and pulse energy on the spacing of ripples, as well as diameter of grains created on silicon wafers, was examined. For the pulsewidth, repetition rate and pulse energy range used, the ripple spacing and grain diameter increased with laser pulse duration while other parameters did not play a significant role. These results show the capability of the proposed system in meeting the industry requirements.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 INTRODUCTION TO NANO FABRICATION TECHNIQUES

According to [1], micro and nanotechnology has immense impact on our daily lives due to our dependence on computers. The size of typical micro structures that is accessible is in the sub-micrometer range, which is at the limits of optical resolution and barely visible with a light microscope. This is about 111000 smaller than structures resolvable by the naked eye, but still 1000 times larger than an atom. Today's developments are addressing the size range below these dimensions. For instance, nanometric structures are in the 1o-9 meter range. Because a typical structure size is in the nanometer range, the methods and techniques are defined as nanotechnology. In the following table, Table 1-1, nanofabrication techniques currently in use such as DUV and Vacuum-UV Lithography, EUV and X-ray Lithography, Electron Beam Lithography, Ion Beam Lithography are described. The emerging Femtosecond Laser Nanomachining method is touched upon and will be described fully in Chapter 2. Table 1-1 is a rephrased, summarized and tabular version of similar sections in [ 1].

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

Even though the feasibility of using femtosecond lasers has been predicted for over a decade now, industrial application of this technique has not been fully realized due to the challenges faced in terms of laser parameters and inadequate experimental studies in this area. The main aim of this thesis is to study the high repetition rate femtosecond laser system and its effect on nanomachining of silicon wafers.

Researchers have been predicting the advantages of using ultra fast laser systems for more than a decade now, but the capabilities of the laser systems used in previous studies did not have the potential of overcoming the throughput and precision requirements in nanomachining. This is true of nanomachining at both below the ablation threshold (surface patterning) and above it (ablation). Laser parameters influencing the size and quality of nano features on silicon wafers are primarily the repetition rate and pulse energy. In terms of surface patterning, laser pulse width is crucial as well. Hence, the outline of the research objectives of this thesis are summarized as follows:

1. Verify the capabilities of the proposed high repetition rate femtosecond laser system for nanomachining of silicon wafers. 2. Evaluate the influence of laser repetition rate and pulse energy on crater width and heat affected zone (HAZ) of silicon wafers during nanomachining above the ablation threshold. 3. Study the influence of the pulse width, repetition rate and pulse energy on the spacing of ripples as well as diameter of grains created on silicon wafers during nanomachining below the ablation threshold (surface patterning).

OVERVIEW OF THESIS

In Chapter 2, the pulsed laser ablation mechanism is discussed in general. Existing mechanism and theories describing laser-matter interaction during the long pulse and short pulse ablation of silicon are summarized, with special attention to femtosecond laser ablation. Details of the experimental setup are presented in Chapter 3.

A systematic experimental study of the influence of repetition rate using a high repetition rate femtosecond laser for nanoscale material processing is investigated and the results are presented and discussed in Chapter 4. The effect of pulse repetition rate and pulse energy on femtosecond laser machining of gold-coated silicon wafer was studied to determine the optimum values of each of these parameters for processing thin films. Machined lines were analyzed and compared while varying the laser repetition rate from 1 MHz to 13 MHz. At each repetition rate, the average beam power was changed from a value well above the damage threshold down to the point where no machining occurred, namely, below the ablation threshold.

A systematic study of the influence of the pulse width, repetition rate and pulse energy on the spacing of ripples, as well as diameter of grains created during the surface patterning operations, is discussed in Chapter 5. A number of different experiments were performed. The mechanisms and theories leading to the creation of ripples and grains in both the femtosecond and picosecond pulse width ranges were explained.

Chapter 6 summarizes the results obtained from this research work. This chapter also includes suggestions for further research that can be carried out.

CHAPTER 2
LASER ABLATION MECHANISM
2.1 INTRODUCTION

Laser cutting and milling techniques are more accurate than their mechanical counterparts. They are also material independent, which allows for manufacturing of a wide range of products from turbine blades to medical tools [3]. Efficient use of lasers for precise material processing is difficult to understand without thorough knowledge of the fundamental physics governing the interaction of laser radiation with matter [4] . The physical process of laser/matter interaction is indeed very complicated and involves a variety of different phenomena. Much fundamental research has been done to determine the physical mechanisms involved and their relative contributions to the complex and highly non-equilibrium laser/matter interaction process [4-6]. The recent progress in laser systems, specifically the chirped pulse amplification (CPA) technique, has allowed the systematic study of the laser/matter interaction using a broad range of laser parameters [4]. These laser parameters include, but are not limited to, laser fluence, pulse duration, wavelength and laser repetition rate. Thus, the optimal machining conditions can only be achieved by understanding the physical processes in laser/matter interaction, as well as the influence of each of the important laser parameters on these processes. The ablation mechanism is also dependent on the properties of the sample material. Silicon prevails in the semiconductor industry and therefore silicon wafers were used as the laser target in all experiments outlined in this thesis. This chapter focuses on the fundamental physical mechanisms and characteristics of laser/silicon interaction. Laser pulse width plays a crucial role in the ablation mechanism [5-9] . Depending on the pulse width regime, the

13

mechanism can be thermal or non-thermal in nature. The peak intensity of the laser power can be increased dramatically by shortening the pulse of the laser beam [3]. Picosecond and femtosecond lasers achieve very high peak intensities with low pulse energies. For example, a laser pulse with a width of 100 fs and energy of 0.33 J has a peak intensity of 10 W/cm when focused onto a 20
~m
15 2

spot. A 10-nanosecond long laser pulse would have to be 100 J to reach

the same intensity [3]. To better understand the advantages of ablation with femtosecond laser, laser/matter interaction mechanisms are discussed for both femtosecond and nanosecond laser pulse width.

As [10] states, in the micro-manufacturing industry, the laser is being established as an indispensable tool because of the benefits, such as higher etch rates, easier automation and better quality features. Excimer lasers are extensively used for micromachining polymers and ceramics while Nd:YAG lasers are used for microdrilling and marking of semiconductors and metals. However, these lasers (nanosecond to millisecond pulses) are not well suited for precise microstructuring due to thermal or mechanical damages (recast layers, burrs and cracks, etc.), limiting the achievable precision and quality. These shortcomings have spurred the development of ultrafast (pi co- and femtosecond) lasers, which deliver enhanced precision and cleanliness of machined features by minimizing collateral damage, plasma effects and thermal diffusion [ 1114]. Femtosecond (fs) pulsed lasers are emerging as tools for microfabrication of all types of materials that are used in biomedical, microelectronics, photonics and MEMS industries. The unique characteristics of ultrafast lasers over longer-pulsed lasers are multiphoton ionization and absence of energy transfer from electrons to the lattice, leading to deterministic and reproducible ablation, negligible thermal damage and high etch rates (0.0 1 to 1
~m/pulse ).

These unique

advantages make femtosecond lasers promising for the fabrication of a variety of materials such

14

as low melting point polymers, high thermal conductivity metals, wide bandgap dielectrics and semiconductors that are otherwise difficult to fabricate by conventional tools.

2.2

NANOSECOND LASER ABLATION

Nanosecond laser pulses have been widely used for material removal and mtcrofabrication [15-18]. In principle, any type of nanosecond laser with intensities above the ablation threshold could potentially be utilized as the light source for silicon machining (Figure 2-1 ). There are many nanosecond lasers available, with repetition rates varying from a few 1O's of kHz to a few Hz, having a maximum average per pulse intensity from a few GW/cm2 to up to a thousand GW/cm2 and pulse lengths from a few nanoseconds to a few tens of nanoseconds. The efficiency of laser pulse utilization in terms of removing material is an important aspect that needs to be known before choosing laser sources.

The physical process of laser-silicon interaction in the nanosecond time regime is a complex process, involving many aspects of laser-matter interaction. As [19] states, the most fundamental feature of the interaction in the nano-second regime is heat diffusion into the surrounding material. In other words, the process is thermal in nature involving direct vaporization [20]. There are several reasons why heat diffusion is detrimental to the quality of the nano-machining. First of all, heat diffusion reduces the efficiency of the machining process as it sucks energy away from the work spot. Also, heat diffusion causes the temperature to drop in the focal area which leads to the silicon staying just above the melting point. The silicon is removed through deposition of a lot of energy into it which causes it to boil. The boiling ejects globs of the molten material from the work zone. The ejected globs then form drops which fall back onto the surface and contaminate the sample. The droplets can be quite large and retain a lot of residual heat and will bind strongly to the sample. Removal of these contaminants will be quite hard without damaging the actual silicon sample. Moreover, heat diffusion also decreases the accuracy of the nano-machining process. Since the heat diffuses away from the work spot, an area much larger than the laser spot size melts. Thus, very fine machining cannot be performed. The beam spot size might be quite small in the range of 200 nanometers or less, but it will not be possible to create features much smaller than one micron. In addition, the heat diffusion affects a large area which is referred to "heat-affected zone" or HAZ. The heating and subsequent cooling waves in this region cause a lot of mechanical stress and microcracks (or sometimes macro cracks) which may propagate deeper into the material and cause premature device failure. For instance, the recast layer that forms around the hole is mechanically weaker and has a different structure than the un-melted material. In some devices, such as arterial stent manufacturing, the recast layer is removed through extensive and expensive post-process

16

cleaning before the device can be used inside the human body. Last but not least, heat diffusion is associated with creation of shockwaves which can damage nearby device structures or delaminate multilayer materials. The more energy deposited into the micromachining process, the stronger the associated shockwaves. With long pulse lasers, the shot to shot reproducibility is poor.

Per [20] , in nanosecond lasers, the mechanism involves direct vaporization. The laser beam deposits energy in a shallow layer close to the surface. The surface reaches thermal equilibrium and some of the heat conducts to the material surrounding the laser spot. A molten layer forms and continuous application of the laser vaporizes the substrate. Material is removed by melt expulsion aided by a locally high vapor pressure. The material spatters around the irradiated area and solidifies as residue in the surrounding area. The thermal effects create a thick heat affected zone (HAZ). Shockwaves generated by the explosive change of phase can cause mechanical stress in the material. The formation of liquid and vapor phases around the spot interfere with the precision of the laser machining by deflecting the beam. Laser machining with nanosecond laser pulses lead to a large heat affected area and a large splatter zone for expulsed material.

Furthermore, as [19] states, when the laser pulse enters the silicon wafer, the electrons start to oscillate. The sample is made of atoms and electrons. For clarity, Figure 2-2 shows only the electrons. The electrons are either bound or free. Bound electrons are tightly attached to the local atoms. In contrast, free electrons are not tightly attached to the local atoms. The ratio of bound electrons to free electrons is a function of the material. Metals have mostly free electrons, while semiconductors and insulators have very few free electrons. Figure 2-2 shows very few

17

free electrons. It is representative of a semiconductor. The bound electrons are tightly localized and can only wiggle slightly. In contrast, the free electrons, which are unbound, can oscillate strongly once they are in the laser field. While oscillating, they occasionally collide with the surrounding atoms. If the laser field is intense enough, a free electron colliding with a surrounding atom will knock off an additional electron. Now there are two free electrons that are being driven by the light field. They in tum can knock two more electrons off atoms in the surrounding material. These four electrons create four more free electrons through collisions, and so on. This type of multiplication effect is called an avalanche effect, and, because it creates electrons by ionizing atoms, it is called avalanche ionization. For this avalanche process to start, a free electron must be present initially in the electromagnetic field. The absence of free electrons prevents the avalanche process from significantly starting and ultimately hinders the material ablation. Since in metals there are plenty of free electrons, the avalanche process starts immediately, which leads to reproducible machining. However, there may be other problems associated with heat diffusion. In semiconductors or isolators, there are naturally very few free electrons. The avalanche process may start right away or may not, depending on the presence or absence of a free electron in the beam path. If there are initially several free electrons in the electromagnetic field, then the process will be very efficient. If there are no free electrons, then the process will not start. Therefore, the initiation of the machining process is based on luck. This variability, which is inherent to the physical process, leads to unstable machining rates. Note that the laser may be perfectly stable, the beam spot size and amount of energy in the pulse may be precisely the same from shot-to-shot, yet the material ablation will vary significantly from shot to shot. This is a serious limitation when trying to do very fine machining. If a large quantity of free electrons could be created a priori, then the presence or absence of naturally

18

occurring free electrons will no longer be an important factor. What matters is the total number of free electrons, not their origin. There are at least two ways to do this. Both approaches rely on the same underlying principle that there are a lot of electrons in the work piece. It is just that the vast majority of them may be bound and not useful to get the avalanche process going. If these bound electrons could be immediately turned into free electrons then the issue would be resolved. This goal can be achieved using lasers working in the ultraviolet or ultrafast regime.

Figure 2-2: Long-Pulse Avalanche Ionization [19]

The unique combination of multiphoton absorption and saturated avalanche ionization provided by ultrafast laser pulses make it possible to machine materials on dimensions smaller than 1 micron [ 19].

According to [19], in order to create the smallest feature possible by machining with light, the light must be focused on the smallest spot possible. The size of the spot is determined by several factors, but this discussion will be limited to making the statement that the smallest

19

spot that can be obtained is about the same as the wavelength of the light used to make it. Thus, if the wavelength of light is about 0.5 microns, then the smallest spot will be about 0.5 microns. However, as noted before, while both ultrafast pulse lasers and long pulse lasers can both operate at wavelengths of 0.5 microns, the long pulse laser is not capable of creating a machined feature that is much less than about 10 microns because of heat diffusion into the surrounding material. Referring to Figure 2-3, below, the process by which an ultrafast laser pulse can create features substantially below that of the central wavelength of the laser pulse itself is demonstrated. First, the ultrafast laser is focused on a spot with a profile which has peak intensity in the center of the beam and smoothly decreases radially outward from the center (a "Gaussian" spot). If the intensity of the laser spot on the surface of the material is adjusted so that just the peak of the beam is above threshold, then material will be removed only in that very limited area. That very limited area can be as little as one-tenth the size of the spot itself. Now imagine that ultrafast laser pulses that have a central wavelength of 0.2 microns have been generated. [20] mentions that a feature of ~200 nm in size can be created using a ~600 nm beam. Ultrafast pulses of light can be used to create features as small as 0.02 microns, or 20 nanometers. Without this unique characteristic of machining with ultrafast laser pulses and the highly deterministic nature of the process, it would not be possible to achieve these results without a heat-affected zone. More specifically, it is not possible to get comparable highly repeatable sub-micron machining with long pulse laser systems.

2.3 FEMTOSECOND LASER ABLATION

Femtosecond laser pulses provide an attractive choice as it provides a way to obtain very clean removal of materials. The main advantage of using femtosecond laser pulses for the ablation of materials is that compared with using nanosecond laser pulses, heat diffusion into the target is negligible, which results in much localized ablation and precise patterning of the sample without great thermal damage to the surroundings [4, 5, 19]. The laser pulses illuminate the material for only a short period of time which in tum does not allow the heat deposited into the silicon to move away from the work spot. In other words, the laser pulse duration is shorter than the heat diffusion time. As

a result, the laser energy piles up at the working spot leading to

increase in the temperature of the silicon past melting and even the evaporation point. It reaches the plasma regime eventually. Furthermore, the peak power delivered by femtosecond lasers is extremely high and easily reaches hundreds of Terawatts per square centimeter range at the work spot. The high power density allows for machining of very hard materials such as Molybdenum

21

and Rhenium. Moreover, the ultrafast pulse creates the plasma in the surface of the material and the pressures created by the forces within it cause the material to expand outward from the surface in a highly energetic plume or gas. The plume expansion (the expansion of the highly charged atoms "ions") and electrons from the surface cannot be contained by the internal forces of the material. The electrons which are lighter and more energetic than the ions, come off the material first, followed by the ions. The positively charged ions repel one another as they expand away from the material and as a consequence no debris or droplets condense onto the surrounding material. Since there is no melt phase, there is no splattering of the silicon on the surrounding wafer surface either. One significant difference between femtosecond and nanosecond laser-matter interaction in terms of transferring laser energy into thermal energy of the target is that electrons and ions are not in equilibrium during the laser pulse in the femtosecond laser ablation case. This is because the electron-ion relaxation time, which is in the range of a few picoseconds to a few tens of picoseconds, is much longer than the femtosecond pulse length. Therefore, for the interaction of femtosecond laser pulses with solid materials, the laser energy is first deposited into the thermal energy of electrons and then transferred to the lattice on a picosecond time scale after the laser pulse. As [20] concludes, by the time the laser pulse is turned off, the system is out of equilibrium as the electrons are at a much higher temperature than the ions. In this case, absorption of the laser and heating of the electrons in the surface layer, diffusion of the 'hot' electrons into the bulk of the material, as well as the energy exchange between the electron and phonon subsystem, happen simultaneously. The highly concentrated energy causes the material to quickly heat past the melting phase to the vapor phase. Since the heat does not have time to diffuse, the HAZ will be greatly reduced. The depth of the pulse duration determines the thickness of the heated layer and is independent of the pulse

22

duration. In addition, as [19] mentions, the amplitude of the electromagnetic field corresponds to the peak power of the laser. Ultrafast lasers generate tremendous peak power. As such, the laser pulse can knock free the "bound" electrons in the sample. Therefore, there is a large quantity of free electrons and the avalanche ionization process can start immediately, reliably and reproducibly. This leads to high-quality machining. Figure 2-4 and 2-5 demonstrate this phenomenon.

As [20] describes, the ablation is a direct solid-vapor transition. The timescale is to the first order, sufficiently short to ignore all thermal effects and hydrodynamic motion. The minimal HAZ is proof of this phenomenon. Again, this leads to a clean cut with no visible collateral damage (Figure 2-6).

Figure 2-6: Ultrafast Pulse Laser-Matter Interaction [19]

There are obviously many advantages to using femtosecond lasers [20]. The shorter pulse width allows for decreased heat affected zone (HAZ) since there is less heat loss. The laser beam does not directly heat the substrate and the thermal effects are limited to the laser spot size. Also, it is possible to avoid interactions of the laser beam and the plasma formed during laser ablation. This leads to cleaner and finer cuts. Furthermore, with a well established set of parameters, the threshold fluence, <I>TH, will remain constant leading to creation of features smaller than the spot size of the laser beam. These advantages of femtosecond laser pulses allow very precise and pure laser processing of silicon which is experimentally demonstrated in Chapters 4 and 5.

24

As [19] mentions, the major shortcoming of femtosecond lasers is low throughput due to low average power. However, newer models of femtosecond lasers have an average beam power

> 20 W which means increased throughput and lowered cost of micro and nanomachining on a
per-unit basis.

CHAPTER 3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
3.1 INTRODUCTION

Selection of laser system and understanding of the laser parameters are most essential for the laser nano-machining operation. In this chapter, an overview of the laser system selected for this study is provided. Also, the experimental setup used for this study is discussed. These experiments were conducted using a high repetition rate femtosecond laser system in the Micro and Nano Fabrication Research Lab at Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.

The Yb-doped fiber-oscillator/fiber-amplifier design allows for the low noise performance of solid state to be combined with high spatial mode quality of fiber lasers. The laser can produce pulses with duration between < 250 fs and 10 ps. The laser beam produced has a central wavelength of 1.03 1-1m. All major laser parameters such as pulse width, repetition rate, total beam power are computer controlled. The laser beam diameter is expanded by a planoconvex lens of 500 mm focal length and a plano-concave lens of 150 mm focal length. A A.

wave-plate in between the two optical lenses is used to control the polarization of the beam before being converted to the second harmonic (515 nm) central wavelength using a harmonic generator. As others have demonstrated as well, the light frequency doubling from 1030 nm to

26

515 nm greatly increased the efficiency and ease with which the micromachining of the features were carried out due to the reduction in the order of multi photon absorption [21]. The second harmonic is more capable of creating nanometric features. Afterwards, three 515 nm mirrors were used to dump the 1030 nm wavelength out of the beam. In addition, a plano-concave lens of 75 mm focal length and a plano-convex lens of 300 mm focal length are utilized to increase the beam diameter by 4 times to 8 mm. A ~ wave-plate in between the two optical lenses

ensures circular polarity of the beam. A diaphragm is used to perfect the beam profile. Next, the beam is scanned onto the sample surface using a uniquely designed piezo tip/tilt mirror. The 16 mm diameter, 2 mm thick mirror consists of 2 fixed orthogonal axes with a common pivot point [22]. The common pivot eliminates the so-called pillow effect and hence field distortion at the image plane is avoided and compensation software to remove the distortion is not required. The novel lever design allows for an exceptional tip/tilt range of 50 mrad (~3°) with sub J..trad resolution which translates to a beam deflection of up to 100 mrad (~6°) [22] . This parallelkinematics design allows for a smaller package with faster response and better linearity with equal dynamics for both axes [22]. The mirror also incorporates zero friction, zero stiction flexure guides and has a high resonant frequency of 1 kHz [22]. This is critical for high repetition rate laser machining since precise pulse number control demands for high frequency beam steering. The frictionless guides and drives do not experience wear and tear which in tum leads to an exceptionally high level of reliability [22]. Finally, the beam is focused onto the sample surface using a telecentric lens with a 12.478 mm focal length [23]. The theoretical laser machining spot diameter (Do) was calculated from D0 ~ 1.27 Aof [24]. Here, f is the effective
D

focal length of the telecentric lens equal to 12.4 78 mm, A.o is the wavelength of the laser equal to

27

515 nm and D is the laser beam diameter equal to 8 mm. From this formula the theoretical spot size is calculated to be 1.02 Jlm in diameter.

The telecentric lens ensures that the laser hits the sample surface at 90° over the entire scanning field thus projecting the correct spot size and wall angle for the application in this study [23]. The gold-coated silicon wafers used in Chapter 4 as well as the normal silicon wafers used in Chapter 5 are mounted on a two-axis (x andy) translation stage with a precision of 0.5 J.tm. The silicon wafer samples used in this study were P type Boron doped silicon wafer of 50 mm diameter, back grinded to 250 J.tm thickness with orientation of <100>. The gold-coated silicon wafer samples have a thin film thickness of 3000

A and a substrate thickness of 250 J.tm. Each

line on the workpiece was cut with only one pass scan. The analysis of the samples for quality, structure and removed material was carried out under a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

CHAPTER 4
EFFECT OF REPETITION RATE
4.1 INTRODUCTION

Thin film micro-machining has found application in different fields. Thin metallic films have been micro-machined for the purpose of creating high density data storage and semiconductor microelectronics [25]. Also, thin metallic films coated on glass are micromachined in order to repair semiconductor masks and fabricate opto-electrical and MEMS devices [26]. Photomasks, which are a subgroup of semiconductor masks, are composed of high quality fused silica coated with an opaque absorber such as 100 nm thick Cr layer or partially transmitting absorber such as molybdenum silicide [27]. The defects usually take the form of excess absorber which when transferred to the wafer result in writing errors that cause the integrated circuit to malfunction [27]. Since the manufacturing process for photomasks is very expensive, up to $1 OOK for complex masks, defect removal is highly desirable. Laser ablation is preferred over ion or electron beam due to the higher speed and also ability to work in atmospheric conditions [28]. Last but not least, in the solar energy industry, there are two concepts to build solar cells. One is rooted in traditional silicon micro-technology and the other in thin film technology where vapour deposition techniques are used to create integrated circuits on insulating substrates [29]. CulnSe2 (CIS) is widely used as the absorber material for thin film solar cells [29, 30]. Laser ablation of thin films has demonstrated the ability to create finely defined micro-structures for solar cells [29].

30

There have been many studies conducted on the femtosecond laser ablation of thin films . As [19], [31] and [32] mention, there are several advantages to using femtosecond laser to conduct precision micro-machining. First of all, as the name suggests, the pulse width of these lasers is in the 1o-Is seconds range. This characteristic leads to minimal heat diffusion into the work piece and creation of a small heat affected zone (HAZ). Therefore, the amount of debris and molten material left behind is insignificant leading to high quality machining finish. Furthermore, the laser threshold can be accurately controlled such that only a small section of the laser intensity is above ablation threshold enabling the user to create laser machining spot sizes smaller than the actual wavelength of the beam. Moreover, the short pulse width allows for very high peak intensities to be achieved with low pulse energies. Therefore, femtosecond laser machining is highly efficient.

Chirped Pulse Amplified (CPA) femtosecond laser systems are not suitable for nanomachining due to several significant shortcomings. These lasers are limited to kHz-level repetition rate, have high laser output power, are very complex and occupy large floor space. The system complexity leads to limited long-term stability and operation. In contrast, fiber laser systems do not suffer from such issues. The high repetition rate offered by these lasers along with the possibility to operate at low output powers make fiber lasers ideal for nanomachining.

The primary aim of this research will be to investigate the feasibility of using high repetition rate femtosecond laser for nan?scale material processing. The effect of pulse repetition rate and pulse energy on femtosecond laser machining of gold-coated silicon wafer was studied to determine the optimum values of each of these parameters for processing thin films. In this study, machined lines were analyzed and compared while varying the laser repetition rate from 1

31

MHz to 13 MHz. At each repetition rate, the average beam power was changed from a value well above the damage threshold down to the point where no machining occurred, namely, below the ablation threshold. The machined structures were analyzed under scanning electron microscope (SEM).

4.2

HEAT CONDUCTION AT HIGH PULSE REPETITION RATE

As [6] indicates, if one considers a single laser beam pulse heating a plane solid target in the heat conduction regime, then the losses due to radiation and plume expansion can be neglected. It can further be assumed that the laser energy will be absorbed in a layer much thinner than the penetration depth of the heat wave. Therefore, the one-dimensional heat conduction equation can be utilized to model the progression of the heat wave into the target [6]:

Eq. 4-1

Where:

Here a is the thermal diffusion coefficient in [cm2/s], k is the heat conduction coefficient in [J/(s em K)], Cp is specific heat [J/(g K)] and p0 is target material density in [g/cm3 ].

As [6] mentions, if the laser profile is taken to be rectangular in shape with a step-like rise and fall and also assume that the target fills the half space at x
~

0 as well as presume the

heat flux at the target surface having the same temporal form as the absorbed laser flux, then the heat conduction equation, equation (4-1 ), with these boundary conditions, has an exact solution [6]:

32

Eq. 4-2

If the temperature of the heated area of the target averaged over space to the end of the laser pulse as a function of the laser (for the rectangular shaped pulse) and target parameters is considered, then the time dependence of surface temperature during the laser pulse (t be written as [6] :

< tp)

can

T(t) = Tm

(

t:

1/2 )

Eq. 4-3

Here, tp is the laser pulse duration and T mis the maximum surface temperature.

It should be noted that the maximum target temperature, T m ax or T m , occurs at the end of

the laser pulse, i.e. Tm ax = T(O, tp).

To characterize the cooling of the target after the end of the laser pulse, the exact solutions of the heat conduction equation must be utilized to find the time dependence of the surface temperature after the end of the laser pulse [6]:

Eq. 4-4

Where, Ia is the absorbed laser intensity, tp is the laser pulse duration, a is the thermal diffusion coefficient, k is the heat conduction coefficient

For the application considered in this thesis, it is imperative to consider the target surface temperature for the case of a succession of laser pulses rather than only one pulse. According to [6], the target surface temperature after n laser pulses of pulse duration tp following with time

intervals tpp can be calculated as follows. The maximum temperature at the end of a single laser pulse is Tmax and the temperature at the beginning of the following laser pulse is
Tmax(tp/tpp) 112 T min

=

. For all laser pulses with the fixed repetition rate, the ratio for the previous 112 . From the above

maximum and the following minimum is constant and equal to a= (tp/tpp)

relationships, the maximum and minimum temperature of the target surface for a succession of n laser pulses can be easily calculated [6]:

First Pulse:

Second Pulse:

Eq. 4-5

nth pulse:

These equations can be derived in such a manner due to the linear nature of the heating process.

After several derivations, [6] concludes that the average surface temperature after n pulses is:

Eq.4-8

Therefore, the average target surface temperature is proportional to the maximum surface temperature T m reached at the end of the laser pulse in a single-pulse regime and the square root of the product of the pulse duration tp and the laser repetition rate tpp [6].

If the average thin film surface temperature for 214 fs and a high laser repetition rate of 116 MHz using equation (4-8) is calculated, the following result is obtained:

tp = 214 fs; Rrep= 116 MHz or tpp= 0.0086

Where:

As this calculation indicates, even at the high laser repetition rate of 116 MHz, the gold thin film cools off between the pulses and only retains 1% of the maximum surface temperature T m· Thus, it is expected that the heat accumulation will be minimal in the experiments conducted in this study which range from 1 MHz to 13 MHz with the same 214 fs pulse width.

35

Furthermore, this calculation shows that truly for femtosecond lasers, there is minimal heat diffusion into the work piece and a small heat affected zone.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION EFFECTS OF LASER FLUENCE CHANGE ON CRATER WIDTH AND HEAT AFFECTED ZONE

Figure 4-1 craters were created at 13 MHz at various energy levels. For instance, for fluence of 3.340 J/cm2 , 2.672 J/cm2 and 2.042 J/cm2 , the crater width is approximately 340 nm, 150 nm and 110 nm respectively. As evident from the SEM pictures, the lower the energy fluence is, the smaller the crater width will be. The same is true for the heat affected zone which changes from 1.20
~m

to 1.18

~m

and 0. 79

~m.

The heat affected zone is defined as the area

surrounding the crater which has had its microstructure and properties changed during the laser ablation process. In the SEM images, it is identified as the raised area with a distinct morphology profile running along both sides of the crater. The crater width and the HAZ were measured in 5 different points and the result was averaged to give the final crater width and HAZ measurement for a particular SEM image. The crater width varies by as much as 46% at 3.340 J/cm2 compared to 18% at 2.042 J/cm2 . This can be attributed to the fact that at lower fluence, the pulse energy is lower as well. Therefore, the variation in one pulse with respect to another has a lesser impact on the crater width.

4.3.2

EFFECTS OF PULSE REPETITION RATE ON ABLATION THRESHOLD

Graphs demonstrating the threshold energy fluence and threshold average beam power for different laser repetition rates were plotted (Figures 4-2 and 4-3). As seen in Figure 4-2, the threshold fluence decreases rapidly with increase in the laser repetition rate. However, at a certain point, the threshold fluence reaches saturation and no longer decreases with an increase in the repetition rate. This result agrees well with those obtained by other authors [33] . However, the higher the laser repetition rate is, the higher the threshold average beam power becomes as shown in Figure 4-3.

As the laser repetition rate increases, the effective number of pulses incident on the center of the cut,
N eff,

increases while the pulse energy decreases. The effective number of pulses

incident at the center of the cut, N eff, was calculated from [34]:

Neff was

calculated

for instance to be 2078 pulses for 13 MHz, 1386 pulses for 8.67 MHz and 1039 pulses for 6.50 MHz.

The increase in

Neff

leads to a decrease in the laser energy fluence required to initiate

ablation (Figure 4-2). It is important to note that Figure 4-2 flats out after repetition rate of 5 MHz and remains at a constant threshold fluence. This is due to the fact that a minimum threshold fluence is required to start the ablation process. If the laser fluence goes below this

38

minimum threshold fluence , no ablation occurs no matter how many pulses are fed to the target surface [22]. Therefore, as Figure 4-3 demonstrates, while the threshold fluence remains almost constant, increase in the pulse repetition rate leads to the increase in threshold laser power.

4.3.3

EFFECTS OF PULSE REPETITION RATE ON CRATER WIDTH AND HEAT AFFECTED ZONE As shown in Figure 4-4, at a constant fluence of 2.917 J/cm2 , the crater width decreases

as the laser repetition rate increases. For instance at 4.33 MHz and 5.20 MHz, the crater width is 180 nm and 160 nm, respectively. It is important to note that although the effective number of pulses incident on the center of the cut,
Neff,

is higher for 5.20 MHz, the feature size is smaller.

The heat affected zone is smaller at 5.20 MHz as well. The crater width varies by as much as 40% at 4.33 MHz compared to 33% at 5.20 MHz. Also, at 5.20 MHz, the crater has a smoother 40

edge and the line width is more uniform.

Neff

is higher at higher laser repetition rates which

means there are more pulses impacting the sample surface. Therefore, better overlapping occurs which leads to a smoother cutting edge. The high
Neff also

means that the variation in one pulse

with respect to another has a lesser impact on the crater width.

For lasers with a Gaussian beam profile, the feature size is related to the maximum laser fluence, <po, on the sample surface by [33] :

D2

= 2w6In (ft)
(/Jth

Eq. 4-11

Where, ro 0 is the machining spot radius and

<f>th

is the material modification threshold, which

depends both on the material as well as the number of pulses incident on each machining point.

As indicated by previous researchers, the peak fluence of the laser spot must be precisely controlled at 2% above the ablation threshold of the sample in order to achieve a feature size one-tenth of the machining spot [32] . Equation 4-10 demonstrates that the peak fluence, <po, is directly proportional to pulse energy, Epulse, which is in tum calculated by dividing the average beam power by the repetition rate. Therefore, as the repetition rate is increased, the pulse energy and the peak fluence of the laser decrease. This means that only the center (or peak) of the Gaussian laser beam is above the material ablation threshold. As the repetition rate is increased further, a yet smaller central portion of the beam has fluence above the ablation threshold. Therefore, increasing the laser repetition rate should lead to a decrease in the crater width. Obviously, as the average beam power is decreased for a constant repetition rate, the pulse energy decreases, this again leads to a decrease in the peak fluence of the laser and a smaller crater width.

Crater width with respect to energy fluence at different repetition rates was plotted in Figure 4-5. As can be seen from Figure 4-5, a higher repetition rate is more capable of producing smaller craters. Also, the lower the energy fluence for a given repetition rate, the smaller the crater width. As shown in Figure 4-2, threshold fluency remains almost constant at repetition rate

42

higher than 5 MHz. Therefore, the portion above the ablation threshold reduces with increase in the repetition rate, which in turn results in a smaller feature size.

HAZ with respect to energy fluence is plotted in Figure 4-6. The great variation in the measurements of the HAZ seen in the figure is due to unclear SEM images and fluctuation in laser beam profile. As mentioned in section 4.2, laser repetition rate will not lead to heat accumulation as it does in femtosecond laser writing of waveguides [35]. Therefore, the heat affected zone is mainly determined by the laser energy fluence. The higher the laser energy fluence, the larger the HAZ will be no matter what the laser repetition rate is. Therefore, laser repetition rate does not play a role in the size of the HAZ for different laser energy fluencies as demonstrated in Figure 4-6.

SUMMARY

Thin film laser micromachining has been utilized for repairing semiconductor masks, creating solar cells and fabricating MEMS devices. A unique high repetition rate femtosecond fiber laser system capable of variable repetition rates from 200 kHz to 25 MHz along with helium gas assist was used to study the effect of pulse repetition rate and pulse energy on femtosecond laser machining of gold-coated silicon wafer. It was seen that high repetition rates lead to smaller craters with uniform line width. Craters created at 13 MHz pulse repetition rate with 2.042 J/cm2 beam energy fluence measured 110 nm in width and had a heat affected zone of 0. 79 Jlm. It was found that pulse repetition rate did not play a significant role in the size of the heat affected zone. The HAZ became larger with increase in the laser energy fluence no matter what the laser repetition rate was. In the future, a 1 W laser system will be acquired to find the optimal repetition rate that would create the minimal feature size with the least heat affected zone. Using this kind of setup, along with techniques such as radial polarization and a different gas assist, may enable the creation of sub 100 nm feature size with good quality.

CHAPTER 5
SILICON WAFER SURFACE PATTERNING USING FEMTOSECOND LASER IRRADIATION BELOW ABLATION THRESHOLD
5.1 INTRODUCTION

Surface patterning using femtosecond laser has many applications such as fabrication of MEMS/NEMS, CMOS, 3D-microstructures, micro trenches, micro channels, micro holes, periodical submicron gratings and nanophotonics [37, 38]. Also, the laser maskless patterning of magnetic thin films and transparent electrode films can be used for microelectronics applications such as fabrication of flat panel displays and hard disk drives [39]. As electronic components become more compact, the miniaturization of these devices requires a large scale and fast patterning technique. According to [38, 39], there are various micro-patterning techniques such as electron beam etching, photolithography, atomic force microscopy, soft lithography, laser

micromachining and microsphere nanopatterning. Electron beam etching produces too much heat and damage while photolithography involves multiple steps and requires the use of chemicals. Atomic force microscopy takes advantage of mechanical forces to etch the surface, but the procedure is slow and cannot conveniently etch large surface areas. Soft lithography techniques such as microcontact printing, micromolding, microtransfer moulding and replica moulding, imprinting and injection molding can be used due to their low thermal effect, cost and the ability to scan a large area. However, these techniques do involve multiple steps and require specialized

49

masters. Laser micromachining is preferred because of fast material processing speed, large scan area and single-step capability. Microsphere nanopatterning in which laser light is focused through a layer of self-assembly microparticles is capable of creating submicron periodic patterns. The major disadvantages include difficulty in controlling the particle arrangement and the particles cannot be used repeatedly. As [40] points out, the femtosecond pulse laser is advantageous for pattern formation. The shorter pulse width generates smaller bubbles which have a shorter period of oscillation and cause a ripple pattern before the melted silicon surface solidifies. Also, the shorter pulse width lowers the energy conversion efficiency from light energy to a shockwave. The shockwave moves a bubble or causes it to collapse but the effect is negligible for pulse width shorter than 300 femtosecond. As [7] demonstrated, amorphization, melting, re-crystalization, nucleated vaporization and ablation occur as part of the laser machining of silicon wafers. Features such as bubbles as well as ripples and columns are created during these stages. The resolidification happens in two stages: amorphization and recrystallization. The main difference between these two processes rests with amount of energy deposited in the material in temperature form and the following cooling velocity. At lower temperatures, characterized by short irradiation periods, the material does not re-crystallize after melting and remains in an amorphous state. However, if the temperature is high enough, then the slow cooling will permit re-crystallization. Figure 5-l, [7], illustrates the diverse surface features that can occur at different thresholds of the silicon wafer. It further demonstrates the dependence of these concepts on the laser fluence and number of laser pulses illuminating the silicon surface. The threshold fluences for each of these phenomena can be calculated by measuring the diameter of the modified areas

50

versus the pulse fluence and extrapolating to zero. As the figure demonstrates, as the laser fluence increases beyond the ablation threshold, at a moderately high laser pulse number, the ripples give way to columns. If the number of laser pulses is very low, then bubbles form when the laser fluence passes the ablation threshold. The modification threshold refers to the laser fluence required to initiate the amorphization process, namely, changing the silicon surface from solid to liquid. After melting, re-crystallization of the liquid silicon layer occurs [41]. Of course, if the laser fluence is above the ablation threshold, the silicon wafer is machined. In our experiments, the ripples formed at a laser fluence range of 1.56 J/cm2 to 4.66 J/cm2 while grains formed at a laser fluence range of3.34 J/cm2 to 6.77 J/cm2 ·

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION RIPPLES

5.2.1.1 RIPPLE FORMATION MECHANISMS

In the ensuing sections, several mechanisms for formation of ripples have been described. The acoustic wave, surface tension gradient, interference between the incident light/surface wave and the Boson Condensation Hypothesis mechanisms have been described in detail. Except for the Boson Condensation Hypothesis which pertains to the femtosecond regime, the other mechanisms are associated with the picosecond laser pulse width.

5.2.1.1.1.

ACOUSTIC WAVE

According to [42, 43], silicon goes through volume contraction and generates an acoustic wave upon melting. The thermoelasticity of silicon creates the acoustic wave even before melting with a power spectrum that peaks around the inverse of the pulse duration. Above the threshold, the generated sound wave lasts over several periods and consequently washes out. The acoustic wave propagates on the surface in an anisotropic manner. In [42], the ripples appeared parallel to one of the [110] crystal axes. However, in [43], the ripples are seen to be perpendicular to the laser polarization. The ripples are in fact a frozen out surface acoustic wave with a frequency of inverse the pulse width of the illuminating laser.

5.2.1.1.2.

SURFACE TENSTION GRADIENTS

As mentioned by [44], during laser surface melting, temperature gradients on the melt surface between the laser beam impact point and the intersection line of the solid-liquid interface with the surface lead to surface tension gradients that sweep liquid away from the beam impact

52

point. The temperature gradient extends radially away from the center of the laser beam. Under the laser beam, the temperature of the liquid is at the highest and surface tension of the liquid is at the lowest. As the liquid temperature decreases away from the center of the beam,_the surface tension of the liquid increases. This phenomenon causes the liquid to flow away from the center of the beam and therefore depress the liquid surface underneath the laser beam and ridge the liquid surface elsewhere. As the beam passes to other areas of the surface, the height difference between the liquid under the beam and the liquid away from the beam increases. A pressure head induces a counter flow of liquid back to the region underneath the beam. At steady state, the liquid flow away from the beam caused by the surface tension gradient and the gravity counter flow of the liquid towards the beam balance each other out. Due to the large temperature gradients and rapid solidification rates associated with laser surface melting, this distortion of the liquid surface becomes frozen into the surface and ripples appear. The only manner in which these ripples from surface-tension gradients can be avoided is if the laser-beam sweep velocity exceeds a certain critical velocity. The following equation states the critical velocity that the laser beam must exceed [44]:

Vc

= -h/r

Eq. 5-1

Where h is the ripple base width, -r is the time required to form ripples. Noting that the equation for -r is [44] :

r = (3h/

gy

12

Eq. 5-2

Where, g is the acceleration field, Vc can be written as [44]:

53

Eq. 5-3

However, a higher beam velocity requires a higher power laser in order to achieve the same penetration depth. The high power laser leads to additional cost and also surface rippling through other mechanisms such as vapour-pressure depression of the melt surface.

5.2.1.1.3.

INTERFERENCE BETWEEN THE INCIDENT LIGHT AND

THE SURFACE WAVE

As [7] observes, the application of a moderate number

(N~ 5)

of laser pulses creates the

periodic surface structures called ripples. The authors state that these formations are not seen for single-pulse experiments and therefore a form of feedback mechanism is involved in the formation of the surface patterns. Ripples occur when solid surfaces are exposed to multiple subsequent pulses [45]. With increasing number of shots, the threshold for formation of ripples decreases significantly [45]. They appear as lines orthogonal to the direction of the electric field vector of the incident light and the period dependent on the wavelength of the generating light, the surface roughness and morphology of the surface [46, 47]. The main reasoning behind such structures is interference between the incident light and a surface wave which is generated by scattering [7, 45, 46]. The scattering is due to random variation in the height of the solid surface or poor crystalline quality of the surface layer or many other intrinsic and extrinsic factors [45]. That is, the fringes are caused by the optical interference of incoming light reflected from the surface and the back-reflected wave from the plasma, forming standing waves [46]. The interference causes periodic change in the absorbed intensity and therefore modulated ablation. The melting threshold is periodically exceeded and the rapid re-solidification of the thin molten layer gives rise to the ripples [45, 46]. These phenomena occur only when the laser intensity is high enough so that the surface temperature is close to the melting temperature [45, 46].

As [45] illustrates, the growth of the ripples is partially dependent on the surface temperature and whether the absorbed power is in phase or out of phase with the surface temperature variation. If the absorbed power is in phase, then the regions of higher initial

55

temperature will have a faster rate of temperature increase as a result of laser illumination. Therefore, the index variation also increases, the diffraction is stronger and the intensity fringes are more pronounced and ripple growth occurs. If the absorbed power is out of phase, then the power will be absorbed by regions that were initially colder and as a result no growth will occur. The authors also conclude that the growth coefficient (and to a smaller extent the actual spacing A) is based upon the actual value of the complex dielectric function. The growth is much faster if the material is metallic-like, that is, the relative permittivity (Er) is less than zero. Therefore, melting of the semiconductor is necessary.

According to [46], the first pulse causes random surface roughening; meanwhile, the subsequent pulses create periodic ripples that can be classified into S+, S_or c fringes. The period of these ripples is dictated by the wavelength, polarization and incident angle of the laser. The S+ and S_ type of ripples are perpendicular to the polarization and have a period of [45, 46]:

A±

= A./(1 ±sin 8)

Eq. 5-4

Where, 8 is the angle of incidence. The S_ is usually dominant. The c type fringes are rarely formed and run parallel to the polarization and have a period of [46]:

Ac =A./cos 8

Eq. 5-5

Thus, the spatial period A of these ripples Is known to be closely related to the wavelength 'A and angle of incidence [46].

56

5.2.1.1.4.

BOSON CONDENSATION HYPOTHESIS

Others, [45 , 48, 49] , have suggested that surface plasmons produce the ripples. They charge that, when using ultrafast femtosecond lasers, mechanical and thermal forces do not have any effect because those forces associated with heat flow or material viscosity are immaterial over the distances of the order of wavelength or the absorption depth which are typically microns. These researchers proposed that the ripples were caused by the condensation of plasmons in very high carrier-density regions. In other words, the excitations are electronic in nature rather than thermal or mechanical. The so-called Boson Condensation Hypothesis can be reviewed in depth in [50]. In summary, Van Vechten proposed that the Boson Condensation requires a high carrier density (> 1023 ) on the anti-bonding state, for which plasmon energy is greater than the band gap energy of the material. Recent experiments show that when intense femtosecond pulses hit the material, a high carrier density is induced (2::10 23 ) in such a short time that the lattice remains cool. For such a density of carriers, the polarization waves begin to create and destroy electon-hole pairs in a coherent fashion so that they are no longer free independent carriers but rather paired carriers. These paired carriers behave as bosons, which condense in accordance with the BCS mechanism explained in [51]. Van V echten suggests some tests to prove the hypothesis correct. For instance, Van V echten said that if the hypothesis is true then a low intensity linearly polarized laser, hitting the substrate at the time the high reflectivity phase appears in the sample leads to linear ripples.

In the experiments conducted during this research, both femtosecond and picosecond laser pulse duration was used. In the femtosecond regime, the ripple formation on the silicon surface is based on the Boson Condensation Hypothesis since mechanical and thermal forces are

57

negligible, whereas in the picosecond regime, the ripple formation can be based on any or a combination of the other above-mentioned mechanisms.

5.2.1.2 EFFECT OF PULSE WIDTH ON RIPPLE SPACING

As [42] mentions, increase in the pulse width leads to increase in the ripple spacing. As shown in Table 5-1, the data supports such a conclusion. The effect is more pronounced for the higher laser repetition rate of 13 MHz compared to 8.67 MHz. This is due to the fact that, as the repetition rate increases, a larger number of pulses impact the silicon surface. Based on the data in Table 5-1, for 13 MHz, the ripple spacing is 0.48

For 8.67 MHz, the ripple spacing remains almost constant. It varies from 0.44 0.43

at 5 ps. Refer to Figures 5-3 and 5-4 for sample SEM images of ripple formation. The

Considering the acoustic wave mechanism described before for generation of ripples and the analysis carried out in [52], Table 5-1 can be explained quite easily. First of all, d must be taken to be the full width (d = 2a) of the laser spot or line. Also, keep in mind that the gradient of the temperature is located at the origin of the sound generation. When d is large, the lateral gradient of the temperature profile is small, and hence the efficiency of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) is large as well. In the limit of a lateral infinite laser-pulse profile, only longitudinal waves are produced since there is only an axial gradient of the temperature due to thermal diffusion within the timescale of the laser pulse. When d is small, the efficiency is small as well because a point or very thin line source is obtained, the extent of which is small compared to the wavelengths produced. Therefore, there exists a certain diameter or width 2a of the laser pulse profile that allows for the most constructive interference of the individual SAW components

60

produced at each expanding surface element. From these arguments, maximal efficiency should occur if

Eq. 5-6

holds. Here, DR is the Rayleigh velocity and 2-r is the laser pulse width. Therefore, if the surface acoustic wave is deemed to be 3 x 10 3 m/s [42] for silicon and the frequency to be inverse of the laser pulse width (300 fs, 700 fs, 5 ps), a propagation distance during that time of9 x 10- 10 m, 2.1 x 10- m, 1.5 x 10-8 m is calculated, respectively, based on Equation 5-6. Although the values disagree with the experimental results, the overall trend is an increase in the pulse width leading to increase in the ripple spacing.
9

In quantitative terms, the findings

can be described through two theoretical

considerations relevant to the problem [52, 53]. In both, the radiant power is assumed to be modulated at a single frequency ro/2n, whereas the lateral, spatial profile of the radiating beam is assumed to be rectangular of width d or Gaussian of full-width 2a, corresponding to the experimental situation in this study. In the first case, maximal efficiency should occur ifkR=n/2d, and, in second case, for kR = ...J21a = ...J8/d. Here, kR is the wave vector of the SAW. It is reassuring that both calculations give quite similar results. However, the spectrum of SAWs was generated due to the finite optical width. This can be incorporated into the theory presented by Krylov and Pavlov [53] in an easy manner. These authors calculated the potentials <p and 'I' of the SAW which contained the Fourier transform G (k) of the lateral shape of the laser pulse as a pre factor. The laser beam was assumed to be 100% modulated and focused perpendicular to the propagation direction. The potentials have the form [54]:

61

Eq.S-7

2 ,

where k 1 and k1 are the wave vectors for longitudinal and

transverse waves, respectively. The definition of F(kR)and H(kR)can be found in [53]. The propagation direction of the SAW is the x direction on an isotropic solid occupying the halfspace
z~

0.

As [54] points out, since the amplitude and the total intensity of the SAW is directly proportional to the prefactors squared of <D and'¥ , the maximal efficiency can be calculated easily from equations (5-7) and (5-8). For a Gaussian intensity profile in the x direction,
I= I 0 exp(- x 2 a 2 ), the Fourier transform is G(kR) = BH(a I .J;)exp(- k~a 2 I

and therefore

the maximum is obtained at kR

-fi I a. This means a first maximum atkR = n/2d. Here, dis

As described by [54], in the case of a circular laser spot, radial Rayleigh waves are generated which are not described by the potentials of equations (5-7) and (5-8). However, since the correct

kR

= -fi I a . Moreover, equations (5-7) and (5-8) need to be multiplied by the Fourier transform

of the temporal laser-pulse envelope due to the finite laser-pulse width. Assuming a Gaussian

62

shape I

= I 0 exp(- t 2 / r- 2 ), another requirement arises in the form of maximal efficiency occurring

only when mR = .J2 lr and since mR = vRkR to kR = .J2 lvRT. Equating the two conditions results in a= vRr. After inserting, vR = a/r in kR = .J2 I vRT we obtainkR = .J2 I a.

5.2.1.3 EFFECT OF PULSE ENERGY ON RIPPLE SPACING

As [48] points out, with increasing power density or number of pulses, the spacing between the ripples increase. The data in this study does not point to any concrete relationship between ripple spacing and pulse energy. This is due to the fact that [48] used a 35 ps, 10Hz and 1064 nm laser compared to the 5 ps, 13 MHz and 515 nm equipment used here. However, Figure 5-5 does further showcase the fact that the ripple spacing does increase with increase in the pulse width.

GRAINS

5.2.2.1 GRAIN FORMATION MECHANISM

As [48, 49] describe, irradiation with intense ultrashort laser pulses lead to bond weakening and breaking in the illuminated area of the semiconductor substrate. The ensuing rearrangement of the crystal lattice is short in duration and is in fact so fast that the compound effect of the short movements of defects and the creation of new bonds between the atoms leads to formation of grains. Because of the short pulse length the surface material heats up and cools down without the bulk material being involved. Therefore, the excitations are electronic excitations where the lattice remains cool.

5.2.2.2 EFFECT OF PULSE ENERGY ON GRAIN DIAMETER

From Figure 5-6, no conclusion can be made with regards to the dependence of grain diameter on pulse energy. Although there is a small variation in the grain diameter, it is too negligible to warrant further examination. However, it can be seen from the graph that the laser repetition rate (number of laser pulses) does not have an effect on the diameter of the grains.

5.2.2.3 EFFECT OF PULSE WIDTH ON GRAIN DIAMETER

As shown in Figure 5-7, for 13 MHz, the grain diameter changes from 0. 73 J..Lm at 300 fs to 1.00 J..Lm at 5 ps. At 8.67 MHz laser repetition rate, the grain diameter varies from 1.00 J..Lm at 700 fs to 1.14 J..Lm at 2 ps back to 1.05 J..Lm at 5 ps. Refer to Figures 5-8 and 5-9 for sample SEM images of grain formation. The grain diameter has been marked on the pictures.

As mentioned by [49], the natural movement or diffusion of atoms in semiconductors is possible through the introduction of defects. When the material temperature increases, the defects become very mobile. These defects accumulate to create extended absorption centers. This accumulation mechanism leads to growth of small structural defects, aggregation and

65

clustering of point defects and the formation of pits. The final morphology of the material is determined by the changes in the mobility of the defects and the relaxation processes after the redistribution of atoms in the crystal lattice. However, when femtosecond lasers are used, damage to semiconductor surfaces initiate without any pit formation. The damage occurs in the form of ablation. For multiple pulses, small pits do form, but are negligible in size compared to the pits formed in the picosecond regime. As a result, defects do not find sufficient time to move a large distance and form a large accumulation. Thus, the grain diameter is smaller in the femtosecond regime compared to the picosecond regime. Also, as the repetition rate is increased from 8.67 MHz to 13 MHz, the pulse energy reduces which leads to decrease in the grain sizes.

SUMMARY

Surface patterning ustng a femtosecond laser can be utilized for the fabrication of MEMS/NEMS, CMOS, 3D-microstructures, mtcro trenches, mtcro channels, mtcro holes, periodical submicron gratings and nanophotonics. A unique high repetition rate femtosecond fiber laser system was used to study the effect of pulse width, repetition rate and pulse energy on the spacing of ripples, as well as diameter of grains created during the surface patterning operations. In the experiments, the ripples formed at a lower laser fluence range of 1.56 J/cm 2 to 4.66 J/cm2 , whereas the grains were created at a higher laser fluence range of3.34 J/cm2 to 6.77 J/cm2 · The primary theory used to explain the creation of ripples in the femtosecond regime was the Boson Condensation Hypothesis since mechanical and thermal forces are deemed to be negligible. For the picosecond pulse width range, the ripple formation can be based on any or a combination of the acoustic wave, surface tension gradient and interference between the incident light/surface wave mechanisms. The grain formation in both the femtosecond and the picosecond span used in this research is due to the bond weakening and breaking in the silicon substrate and the short duration of the crystal lattice rearrangement following illumination by the laser. The small movements lead to the creation of new bonds between the atoms and eventual formation of grains. It was seen that, for the pulse width, repetition rate and pulse energy range used, the ripple spacing increased with laser pulse duration while other parameters did not play an important role. In terms of grain diameter, a similar trend was seen.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
6.1 SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS

The objective of this thesis was to propose, investigate and develop a femtosecond laser nanomachining technique that can overcome the challenges faced by the conventional techniques currently in use in different industries.

In this thesis, the currently used nanofabrication techniques such as DUV and VacuumUV lithography, EUV and X-ray Lithography, Electron Beam Lithography, Ion Beam Lithography and finally Femtosecond Laser Nanomachining were described. The femtosecond laser technique was identified to be the most capable technique for achieving the goals of high throughput, high quality, least thermal damage and least machining debris with the lowest cost.

Although the feasibility of using femtosecond lasers for nanomachining has been predicted for some time, industrial application of this technique has not been widespread due to the challenges faced in terms of laser parameters and inadequate experimental studies in this area. For precise material processing, thorough knowledge of the fundamental physics governing the interaction of laser radiation with matter is crucial. The physical processes of laser-matter interaction were successfully studied and also the mechanisms and phenomena involved in both the nanosecond and femtosecond laser regimes were explained.

69

For this study, a high repetition rate femtosecond laser system was chosen. An efficient and yet simple experimental setup was arrived at after studying the capabilities of the proposed laser system while keeping the objectives of the research in mind.

The experimental results outlined in Chapter 4 demonstrate that a high pulse repetition rate is ideal for nanomachining of thin films. It was seen that high repetition rates lead to smaller craters with uniform line width. Craters created at a 13 MHz pulse repetition rate with 2.042 J/cm2 beam energy fluence measured 110 nm in width and had a heat affected zone of 0.79 Jlm.
It was found that the pulse repetition rate did not play a significant role in the size of the heat

affected zone for different laser fluences. However, higher laser energy fluence led to a larger heat affected zone.

The experimental results outlined in Chapter 5 demonstrate primarily the effect of laser pulse width on the spacing of ripples, as well as diameter of grains created during irradiation. In the experiments, the ripples formed at a laser fluence range of 1.56 J/cm2 to 4.66 J/cm2 , while grains were created at a laser fluence range of 3.34 J/cm2 to 6.77 J/cm 2 . In the femtosecond regime, the ripple formation on the silicon surface was based on the Boson Condensation Hypothesis since mechanical and thermal forces are deemed to be negligible, whereas in the picosecond regime, the ripple formation can be based on any or a combination of the acoustic wave, surface tension gradient and interference between the incident light/surface wave mechanisms. The grain formation in both the femtosecond and the picosecond range is due to the bond weakening and breaking in the silicon substrate and the short duration of the crystal lattice rearrangement following illumination by the laser. The excitations that lead to the creation of these grains are electronic in nature. It was seen that, for the pulse width, repetition rate and

70

pulse energy range used in this thesis, the ripple spacing increased with laser pulse duration while other parameters did not play a crucial role. In terms of grain diameter, a similar trend was seen.

In conclusion several important contributions were made by this study as outlined:

·

It was proven that a high repetition rate femtosecond laser system is ideal for

nanomachining of silicon wafers. Craters were created at 13 MHz pulse repetition rate with 2.042 J/cm2 beam energy fluence that measured 110 nm in width and had a heat affected zone of 0. 79 J..Lm. · The influence of laser repetition rate and pulse energy on crater width and heat affected zone (HAZ) of silicon wafers during nanomachining above the ablation threshold was evaluated. · The effect of the pulse width, repetition rate and pulse energy on the spacing of ripples as well as diameter of grains created on silicon wafers during nanomachining below the ablation threshold (surface patterning) was examined.

6.2

FUTURE WORK

The laser system used in these experiments does have shortcomings especially for the study carried out in Chapter 4. The laser used has a maximum average power of 12 W. The experiments used a power of less than 0.5 W. As a result, all of the results suffered from high power fluctuation as evident in the SEM images. The applications considered in this research would require a laser system with a lower maximum average power of approximately 1 W to obtain stable pulse energy leading to uniform line width. Such a system would be capable of

71

smaller pulse energy increments allowing for more precise control of feature size. Future research should utilize a 1 W laser system to repeat the study in Chapter 4 in order to further optimize the repetition rate that would create the minimal feature size with the least heat affected zone. Using this kind of setup, along with techniques such as radial polarization and a different gas assist, may enable the creation of sub 100 nm feature size with good quality. Enclosing the laser system would also help in this regard.

In the experiments outlined in this thesis, the second harmonic ( 515 nm) central wavelength was used. As a future work, these experiments can be performed at lower wavelengths by using third harmonics. Even with the loss of laser power associated with the frequency tripling, this kind of setup may be able to further improve the quality of the machining, as well as further reduce the size of the nano features on the silicon wafer.
