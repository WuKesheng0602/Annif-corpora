Abstract
Conventional shoe embedded PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) power harvesters have the problem of low reliability and short life time due to the fragility of the PZT material for bending and the high stepping force which directly acts on the PZT-metal structure. In this thesis, a novel shoe embedded PZT power harvester is presented, which is able to solve the problem of low reliability and short life time associated with conventional designs. This harvester uses an air pump to squeeze the air into a fixed chamber to deform a PZT diaphragm to generate electricity. Thus the high stepping force is directly taken by the housing of the harvester instead of the PZT material. A power of 1.12 mW is generated at a speed of 4 mph on a treadmill. The stepping force acting on the harvester is also measured, which indicates the power harvester can survive a very high stepping force.

Key Words: Piezoelectric power harvesting, Shoe-embedded, Air pump, high reliability

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Power Harvesting
The interest in power harvesting technology has been increasing in recent years. Power harvesting is the act of scavenging energy from the surrounding environment energy sources such as heat, light, vibration, and movement and converting these energies into electrical energy. Harvesting energy from vibration and mechanical movements (low frequency vibration) is the most attractive method of power harvesting [1] [2]. These power generators harvest electricity from vibration or motion and the output can be used for small electronic devices such as a BioMEMS device, a cell phone or a GPS. The goal of this type of power generation is to replace batteries and make small electronic systems battery-less [1]. The two main battery problems are [3]:   A battery has limited operation time for the sensor and wireless communication devices. The chemicals in batteries are a pollution source and their recycling process is very difficult and expensive. Because of these disadvantages, the total cost of ownership for battery-powered devices is much higher than for self-powered electronic devices. Battery-less systems overcome these limitations and have additional advantages of being maintenance-free and environmental friendly.

1.2

Power Harvesting From Human Motion
One of the main power sources for harvesting energy is body motion (such as breathing,

chest motion, and footsteps during walking). Human chest motion during breathing has been used for wearable computer applications [2]. Scavenging electricity from heel strikes during

1

walking is another method of human power harvesting [4]. Join motion has also been evaluated for power generation [5]. An experimental study of energy harvesting in an artificial knee joint after total knee replacement surgery has been carried out [6]. Knee movement has been used to power a DC electric generator [7]. Electrical energy has been derived from the vertical movement of suspended-load backpack carried by a walking person using a linear-to-rotary resistor load to a DC motor [8]. Sodano [9] has presented an energy harvester in a backpack that can generate electrical energy from the differential forces on a stack piezo between the wearer and the pack. The motion of a magnet in a linear permanent magnet generator has been utilized to convert the vertical motion energy to electricity [10] [11]. Starner and Paradiso [2] have also theoretically calculated the output power from different parts of human bodies. They have concluded that maximum power can be derived from footsteps (Figure 1.1).

Figure 1.1 Possible reachable power from human body (footfalls can give the most power) [2].

1.3 Existing Shoe Embedded Power Generators
Generally, three methods exist to obtain electrical energy from mechanical movement [3] [12].  Electrostatic (capacitive) power conversion The relative motion of an electrical conductor in a magnetic field causes a current to flow in the coil (Figure 1.2).

Figure 1.2 Schematic of electromagnetic power generator [13].  Electrostatic (capacitive) power conversion Two conductors, which are separated by a dielectric (i.e. a capacitor), moves relative to one another and the electrical energy is stored in the capacitor (Figure 1.3). Mass, m

Capacitor plates Figure 1.3 Schematic of electrostatic power generator [14].  Piezoelectric power conversion Piezoelectric materials are materials that deform in the presence of an electric field, or conversely, produce an electrical charge when mechanically deformed (Figure 1.4). Therefore, 3

the higher the strain is produced, the higher the power is generated from the piezoelectric material. In Table 1.1, these three methods are compared. M: proof mass

(max 0.1 V) 2) should use a small transformer 1) difficulties to development of high quality piezoelectric thin-films 1) require a separate voltage source to charge capacitor 2) more mechanical damping 3) mechanical stops is needed Disadvantages

Two sets of prestressed spring metal strips with semi flexible PZT under the heel (manufactured as the by Face International) and two sets of 8 layers of stack of

PVDF on the top and the bottom of plastic sheet has been used (Figure 1.5 and Figure 1.6) for

4

the shoe insole [15]. Figure 1.7 shows the place of two sets of PZT unimorph and PVDF harvester under the shoes [15]. Two parallel DT4-028K/L piezoelectric films from MSIUSA, which inserted inside the shoe (Figure 1.8), have also been utilized for shoe power harvesting [6]. Dielectric elastomer has been mounted between bellows filled with a fluid or gel and integrated in the shoe heel [17]. This harvester is an electrostatic harvester which needs an initial voltage to apply across each face of the elastomer (Figure 1.9). A piezo (PVDF) power harvester and an electrostatic power harvester have been developed by Rocha [18]. The voltage from PVDF acts as an initial voltage for electrostatic harvester (Figure 1.10). Han and Kaajakari [19] have inserted 120 layers of microstructured piezoelectric polymer film in the shoe heel for generating electricity from footstep force (Figure 1.11). Aluminum

Figure 1.11 Microstructure polymer film is rolled into 120 layers of 1-cm thick [19]. Some articles discuss the piezo beam structures in shoes. Mateu and Moll [21] have analytically explained how to construct an optimum piezo beam-type harvester which is inserted in the shoe. They have introduced two types of piezo harvesters. One of them is based on the structure (homogeneous bimorph, symmetric, or asymmetric heterogeneous bimorph). The second type is based on the support. They concluded that the optimum selection for the piezoelectric is an asymmetric heterogeneous bimorph with a simply supported beam. They express that the shoe cavity dimension is also a factor to consider. Moro and Benasciutti [22] have utilized a conventional bimorph piezo beam with a proof mass in the shoes (Figure 1.12). Li [23] has used a bimorph piezo with a curved L-shaped mass (Figure 1.13) in the shoe.

Figure 1.12 Custom clamp system with rectangular bimorph piezo beam inside the shoe [22].

Figure 1.13 Bimorph piezo beam with the curved L-shaped mass [23]. A rotary generator has also been used to convert foot vertical movement to electrical energy [24-26]. This type of generator basically uses a rotary arm to convert a linear heel strike into rotary motion (Figure 1.14). The arm is compressed and the rotor rotates in magnetic field by a gear system and the electricity is made in the coils. Based on this idea, Paradiso and his team [26] developed a system with a simple spring, flywheel, and generator system (Figure 1.15). Hayashida [24] improved this harvester and integrated it inside the shoe heel (Figure 1.16). As rotary generators need to spin rapidly to achieve efficiency, these systems all involve significant gear ratios, which introduce considerable mechanical complexity and fairly high torque, leading to a high probability of breakage [2].

Figure 1.21 Two disk magnets facing each other in opposition: one is fixed and the other one is free to move through the coil [30]. This thesis will focus on piezo power harvesters for highest energy density in comparison with other types of power harvesters (Table 1.1) and their ability to convert directly applied strain energy into usable electric energy without any need for a separate voltage source [31] and they can easily be integrated into the shoe heel.

1.4 Problems With Existing Shoe Embedded Piezoelectric Power Generators
Literature reviews about existing shoe power harvesters have explained about difficulties in translating energy from the foot to the piezoelectric [2] [39]. Among all existing piezo materials, PZT is the main piezo material for power harvesting due to the most efficient vibration excitation [31-33] [34-38]. However, it is hard and brittle and does not have much range of motion in 3-1 direction and is not suitable for applications such as foot sole where flexibility is necessary [2]. Moreover, in the actual heel strike, the strain is concentrated at the bending point of the foot rather than distributed evenly [10]. In many shoe embedded PZT power harvesters, the high stepping static/impact force is directly acting on a PZT-metal structure, which leads to a low reliability and short life time due to the fragile nature of PZT materials and the vulnerability of the bonding between the PZT and 11

metal under periodic impact forces. For designing a robust power harvester, the high pressure of the foot heel on the harvester should be considered. Research shows that the peak heel pressures during walking could be as high as 500~1000 Kpa. Foot pressure distribution during walking in young and old adults is introduced by Hessert [40]. Hutton and Drabble [41] have introduced an apparatus to give the distribution of the vertical load under the foot. The foot type has also affected pressure during walking and running [42]. Zhu [43] has determined that the peak heel pressure is 665 kPa for 7 min walking at a cadence of 60 steps/min and has also mentioned that their results for peak pressures are consistent with those obtained by other researchers. It has also been found [44] that the heel peak pressures could go up to 1000 kPa when the subject was wearing shoes [44]. Soames and Clark [45] found peak pressures in the range of 600-900 kPa when the subject walked in shoes. Henning and Nilani [46] measured that the maximum foot heel pressure is 688 kPa. Nevill [47] found this measure to be 1000 kPa and Whittle [48] has reported that the heel pressure is 575 kPa.

1.5 Objectives
Shoe embedded PZT power harvesters are plagued with low reliability and short life time. This is because of the bending mode of PZT plates is often used for power harvesting. But PZT plates are brittle and fragile for bending and thus cannot take the high static and impact forces from foot stepping. In this thesis, a novel shoe embedded air-pump type PZT power harvester is presented. The harvester can take very high static and impact forces through an air-pump design to achieve high reliability and long life time. In addition, the harvester is compact and can be easily embedded inside the shoe heel.

12

The thesis is organized as follows. The principle of the harvester is explained after the introduction. Then the modeling of the harvester is presented. Prototype and experimental tests are introduced next. Moreover, a method for measuring the heel force on the harvester is introduced. After that, conclusions are summarized. In Appendix A, a literature review about different configurations of the piezo power harvester and relevant piezo parameters are presented. Drawings are also given in Appendix B.

Chapter 2 Design and Modeling of the Harvester
There are some constraints to design a shoe power generator such as size limitation (especially height), comfort during walking, durability, tolerating high impact force, lightweight, and simple construction. In this harvester, an air pump is used that not only makes a relax feeling during walking but also makes air pressure to deform piezo diaphragm.

2.1 Principle of Operation
Figure 2.1 shows the air pump type shoe embedded piezoelectric power harvester. It consists of an air pump and a circular bimorph piezo diaphragm which is located in a fixed chamber. The bimorph piezoelectric diaphragm separates the fixed chamber into two parts, i.e., the upper part is connected through to the air pump and the lower part is sealed by the piezoelectric diaphragm. The air pump is sealed with a flexible rubber. The top plate of the airpump is supported by a high stiffness spring. The harvester is embedded inside the shoe heel. When the shoe is under no stepping force, the air pressures of the upper part and lower part of the fixed chamber inside the air pump are the same and equal to atmospheric pressure. Once the foot stepping force is applied, the air inside the air pump is squeezed into the upper part of the fixed chamber and the air pressure increases, which bends the PZT diaphragm as shown in Figure 2.1(b). The piezoelectric diaphragm moves back to its normal position the foot stepping force is released. The back and forth deformation of the piezoelectric diaphragm generates electric power. In this shoe embedded PZT power harvester design, the static/impact force from the foot stepping is taken by the housing of the fixed chamber which is made of metal such as aluminum or hard plastic and thus can take high force. The load acting on the PZT diaphragm is caused by 14

the pressure difference between the upper and lower parts of the fixed chamber. This pressure difference is controlled by the dimension ratio of the air pump and the upper part of the fixed chamber. Hence, unlike its conventional counterpart designs, in the shoe power harvester presented in this thesis, the high static/impact force from the foot stepping does not directly apply to the PZT diaphragm. Instead the piezoelectric unit is well protected in a fixed chamber and it deforms due to the controllable air pressure difference. As a result a high reliability and long life time of the show embedded power harvester can be achieved. In addition the power harvester has a compact structure and can be easily integrated into the shoe heel without increasing the shoe size as shown in Figure 2.1(c).

This harvester can use a typical PZT plate without any damage to this fragile piezo and bonding between piezo and substrate layers. The air chamber size and the pressure on top of piezo can be adjusted based on piezo strength, shape, and configuration. The harvester also has the capability to be redesigned in a way that the air bellow is put inside the shoes and the piezo chamber part is attached outside the shoes, which means that the piezo part can be reused for different shoes.

2.2 Piezo Diaphragm Design
There are some researchers that have presented a theoretical analysis of unimorph piezoelectric diaphragms with simply supported and clamped boundary conditions as a potential tool for generating electrical energy from blood pressure variation for low pressure (5330 Pa) [49-59]. Moreover, Kim et al. [50-52] have developed and tested a decoupled PZT circular diaphragm with a clamped edge. The power performance of circular bimorph piezoelectric diaphragm generators (Figure 2.2) have also been analyzed [57-58]. Tang [57] has also mentioned that the bimorph diaphragm has the capability to be inserted in the heels of shoes. All above researchers tries to reach analytical models for predicting output power of diaphragm generators. However, none of them has developed and designed a real device with practical application for harvesting energy from body movement. In this design, the bimorph piezo diaphragm is practically used for deriving power from human motion. Figure 2.2 (a) shows the cross section of the bimorph PZT diaphragm. The shim layer of brass is clamped at its edge. Two PZT plates are connected in parallel. The piezoelectric plates do not cover the whole circular area in order to avoid cancellation of the generated positive and negative charges. If the PZT plates cover the whole diaphragm, when the diaphragm deflects under a uniform pressure, there would be areas subject to negative stress and positive stress 16

(Figure 2.2 (b)), which generate negative and positive charges on the same side of each PZT plate. The generated positive and negative charges cancel each other [50-52].

2.3 Air Chamber Design
In order to calculate the maximum deformation of the PZT diaphragm, the maximum air pressure load acting on the PZT diaphragm is calculated as follows. Refer to Table 2.2, the initial volume of the air pump is . The final volume is . (2.2) (2.1)

The initial pressure inside the chamber is the atmospheric pressure. When the air pump is squeezed the pressure inside the upper part of the fixed chamber is / 18 . (2.3)

Where Pa is the atmospheric pressure, which is 103 kPa. The lower part of the fixed chamber is assumed to remain unchanged when the air pump is squeezed because the change of the volume of the lower part of the fixed chamber due to the deformation of the PZT diaphragm is negligible. Thus the pressure load acting on the PZT diaphragm is =Pupper-Plower= ( / - P a) (2.4)

Where Pupper and Plower are the pressures in the upper and lower parts of the fixed chamber. Substituting the parameters into the above equations, the pressure load acting on the PZT diaphragm is 34 kPa.

2.4 Finite Element Simulation
To verify the air chamber dimension, the air pressure on the piezo diaphragm is checked in an ANSYS simulation with the three following constraints [53]: 1) The stress of the PZT layer must be less than the PZT yield strength ( the metal yield strength ( < < ). 2) The substrate stress must be less than

). 3) Small deflection theory is also considered in the design

of piezo diaphragm (deflection<<thickness). In other words the dimensions of chosen piezo

19

diaphragm should be checked for tolerating the maximum air pressure from the air pump without any possible break. The element type and mesh type are mentioned in Table 2.3. Figure 2.3 shows the ANSYS modeling of bimorph piezo diaphragm and its maximum displacement and Figure 2.4 gives the diaphragm stress distribution. In Table 2.4, the results of applying pressure are given. As can be seen, the design for piezo diaphragm is acceptable based on the three above design constraints.

2.5 Theoretical Prediction of Generated Power
2.5.1 Modeling of Piezoelectric Generator A piezoelectric energy harvester is often modeled as a mass+spring+damper+piezo structure which schematically shown in Figure 2.5 [59-60]. In this approach, an effective mass M subjected to an applied forcing function F(t) is bounded on a spring of effective stiffness k, on a damper of coefficient , and on a piezoelectric element with capacitive 21 .

Figure 2.5 An equivalent model for a piezoelectric energy harvester. The output power of a circular piezoelectric diaphragm depends on the material properties of piezo and substrate, diaphragm geometry parameters, working frequency, boundary conditions, external electric resistance, and external force [50-57]. Tang [57] has presented power performance equations of the circular bimorph piezoelectric diaphragm generator which is applied in this thesis to predict output power of the harvester in Figure 2.2. For an ideal piezoelectric model (no mechanical damping or as [57]: (2.5)


), the diaphragm power output is defined

Equation (2.5) shows that the average harvester output power (P) depends on open circuit voltage ( ), piezo free capacitance ( ), vibration or working frequency () and external

electrical resistance (R). The free capacitance is also a function of diaphragm dimensions. The optimal external resistance for an ideal system is defined as: (2.6) Where is mechanical damping ratio and is the piezoelectric coupling coefficient.

22

The Raleigh method is applied [57] to obtain the deflection shape of the diaphragm during uniform periodical vibration. Then this deflection function is substituted in the piezo constitutive equations to reach the open circuit voltage ( ) as well as power in Equation (2.5).

Understanding of the theory and its parameters is important, so it was decided that the steps for deriving the voltage and power equations are simply explained. First the principle of piezoelectric composite diaphragm is given. Then the Kinetic and potential energy theory and Raleigh method are applied to give the natural frequency as well as the transverse displacement function of bimorph piezo power harvester. After that, open circuit voltage equation and its relation with transverse displacement and applied pressure power are presented. This voltage equation can be substituted in Equation (2.5) to find the average output power. 2.5.2 Principle of Piezoelectric Composite Diaphragm The constitutive equations in the polar coordinates and voltage and charge equations of the piezoelectric membrane for a piezo actuator or harvester are generally defined as follows [57-58] [61-63]: (2.7) (2.8)  (2.9) (2.10) (2.11) (2.12) (2.13)

Equations (2.7) to (2.13) show that when a piezo material (as a harvester) is stressed, the electric charge is generated. This charge is restored in the piezo membrane (as a capacitor) and a voltage is produced across the piezo electrodes (open circuit voltage ( )). In simple words, an is the free capacitance of the piezo membranes and is

external force or pressure on the piezo causes a stress, which this stress can produce a voltage and power. For the substrate plate, there is not an electromechanical coupling effect, so the stress is simplified to: (2.14) (2.15) (2.16) Where , are young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the substrate plate, respectively. is the potential-energy density for the substrate membrane.

Moreover,

For using the piezo as a power generator, there is no external voltage (

circular piezo layers, which are connected in parallel and use as a power harvester, the electric field and charge and open circuit voltage can be rewritten with respect to Equation (2.9), Equation (2.11), Equation (2.12), and Equation (2.13):  (2.17) (2.18) (2.19) (2.20) Where V is the external voltage and connected piezoelectric membranes and is the total charge generated on the two paralleland   . Refer to



Figure 2.1, parameters , h, ,  are the substrate radius (

), the total thickness of the

diaphragm, the substrate to total thickness ratio, and the substrate to piezo diameter ratio, respectively. Equation (2.17) clearly shows that the electric displacement (or charge) is related to stress from external force or external pressure. To find the stress, the deflection function of the piezo membrane is derived and replaced in Equation (2.14) and Equation (2.15). 2.5.3 Transverse Displacement of the Piezo Diaphragm Transverse displacement of the bimorph piezo diaphragm can be obtained by [57]: (2.21) Where is the deflection of the piezoelectric composite diaphragm in the z-direction; r is the

distance from the center of the diaphragm to the point of the deflection; a is defined as the radius of the diaphragm; is the coefficient; and  is the vibration amplitude factor of

the neutral surface of the diaphragm center. If i=4, then the calculation precision is enough for a practical application [57]. Given leads to , there will be . The boundary condition

. Thus the deflection function of an oscillation can be written as (2.22)

For very low frequencies (

such as walking condition, the deflection function ( )

can be considered as a constant and will not be influenced by the driving frequency [57]. This deflection is measured in static mode of ANSYS by applying uniform pressure on one side of the diaphragm. This uniform pressure is the maximum air pump pressure after complete squeeze of the pump. Refer to Equation (2.22) for clamped boundary conditions, we have (2.23) (2.24) , are obtained by solving Equations (2.23) and (2.24): (2.25) In the following sections the kinematic and potential energy of bimorph piezo diaphragm are explained and by the Raleigh method the natural frequency of the bimorph piezo diaphragm as well as , , are found out [57]. Based on the Raleigh method, in the ideal condition

(without any type of damping) the maximum values of potential energy and kinematic energy for the piezo diaphragm should be equal. 2.5.4 Total Kinetic Energy of Bimorph Piezo Diaphragm The kinetic energy densities of the substrate layer and piezo layer is define and , respectively. The total kinetic energy of the diaphragm can be calculated

(2.30) 2.5.5 Total Potential Energy of Bimorph Piezo Diaphragm Substituting Equation (2.9) to Equation (2.10), the potential energy density can be written as:  (2.31)

density and the potential energy of the two piezo diaphragms with constant electric displacement are:

Substituting Equation (2.7) and Equation (2.8) into Equation (2.32) and then into Equation (2.33), Tang [57] has proved that potential energy of the two piezo diaphragms with constant electric displacement ( ) is:

Based on this method, the natural frequency is minimized as follows: (2.42) Solving Equation (2.42) with respect to parameters transfer displacement and deflection function ( and substituting the result into Equation (2.25), in Equation (2.22) is obtained. Then the

Chapter 3 Prototype of Air Pump Piezo Power Generator
3.1 Prototype and Fabrication
A prototype of the shoe embedded air pump type piezoelectric power harvester was fabricated (Figure 3.1). Materials and dimensions of the parts used in the harvester are listed in Table 2.2 and Table 3.1. A wave spring was chosen to keep the height low. The polycarbonate and spring parts are glued using a vibration resistant epoxy. The PZT diaphragm was glued to the polycarbonate fixed chamber at its edge. One of the main challenges here was how to seal the air pump with the top plate of the pump to be able to move up and down. A latex material was chosen to seal the air pump and a ring (Item 6) was used to keep the latex material tightly glued. The total height of the harvester without load is 24 mm. Once stepped on, the height of the harvester becomes 19.5 mm.

The bottom plate (Figure 3.2a) has two slots to access to ambient atmosphere and for a path for wires. A circular chamber with 36.3 mm diameter and 2 mm depth was made in the bottom plate for piezo deformation. The upper circular plate (Figure 3.2b) with thickness 5 mm and diameter 5 cm is an air chamber. The diameter and depth of the upper and bottom chambers are defined based on piezo thickness, piezo deformation, wire thickness, and air pressure.

3.2 Modification of the Power Harvester
During the experimental tests, the spring epoxy was damaged due to a weak epoxy connection. As a result, the spring was freely moving and cutting the rubber. For solving the problem, the following possible solution was executed. 1. The wave spring had no shim plate which had not made a strong epoxy connection (Figure 3.6). Therefore a new wave spring with two end shim plates was used for a stronger epoxy connection (Figure 3.7).

Point connection led to weak epoxy contact which broke easily during the test

Figure 3.7 The wave spring with end shim plate (model CS-137 Smalley Co.). 2. A new wave spring with smaller diameter (diameter 1.37") was utilized, which never touches the rubber. 3. Two aluminum rings were designed to keep the spring in its position. Even if the epoxy is broken again, these rings don't let the spring move against the rubber (Figure 3.8). 4. Two aluminum plates with 50 mm diameter were made and replaced with the initial top circular plate and the spring connection plate (Figure 3.9 ). 5. A new epoxy model 3M Scotch-Weld DP 460 was used to reach stronger epoxy connections as well. Table 3.2 Added parts to the harvester after modification (Figure 3.9).

Chapter 4 Experimental Tests and Results Analysis
Two types of experimental tests have been performed on the treadmill for measuring output power and for measuring impact force. In the following sections the experimental test setup and the results are reported.

4.1 Voltage and Power Measurement Tests
4.1.1 Experimental Test Setup for Measuring Voltage The shoe embedded power harvester was tested when the shoe was worn and the wearer walked on a treadmill with the speed ranging from 1 mph to 4 mph (Figure 4.1). The wearer is 1.75m tall and weighs 92 kg. Various resistive loads are connected to the output of the harvester (Figure 4.2). The generated power was calculated using the following equation. P= (5.1)

Where P is the generated average power, Vrms is the output voltage (root mean square) and R is the resistance.

4.1.3 First Experimental Test on a Treadmill Figure 4.3 provides the experimental results of average output power on a treadmill for resistances 20 k to 200 k for five different speeds (1 mph, 2 mph, 3 mph, 4 mph, 5 mph). It can be seen from the data that the output power increases with speed rise and the maximum power is 0.8 mW (R=200 k) for a speed of 5 miles/hour. It is analytically expected that for every walking speed the power reaches a maximum amount in an optimum resistance; then the power gradually decreases. However, the graph does not follow this expected pattern.

These two graphs show that for each electrical resistance the power increases with speed rise. Comparing maximum power of the same speed in these graphs also reveals that the output power has decreased in different tests. For example, the maximum power of a speed 5 mph in Figure 4.4 is 0.76 mW, but the maximum power of a speed 5 mph in Figure 4.5 has reduced to 0.1 mW. In contrast with the theoretical prediction, there are 43

also unexpected fluctuations in the output power with respect to increasing electrical resistance. This output power variations come from some problems in the harvester, which have been explained and solved in section 3.2 .

4.1.5 Experimental Tests after Harvester Modification Previous tests were performed for a speed of 1 mph, 2 mph, 3 mph, 4 mph, and 5 mph. Speed 1 mph is very slow walking; speed 4 mph is fast walking; and speed 5 mph is a running condition. So it was decided to do the next tests only for speed 1 mph to 4 mph. Moreover, more electrical resistances between ranges 50 k to 900 k were picked. Figure 4.6 illustrates the output power versus resistance in different walking speeds on the treadmill. For each speed, the power has gradually increased to a maximum amount for an optimum resistance then it has gently reduced. The maximum power is 1.14 mW (at speed 4 mile/hour). Figure 4.7 demonstrates versus

resistance. In each speed, the voltage has increased with increasing the electrical resistances. Again it is theoretically expected that for each resistance with increasing speed the power increases to a maximum value then it decreases. However, this theoretical prediction has not happened for all electrical load resistances and there was a discrepancy between theory and experimental results for some of electrical resistances. For instance, in electrical resistance 900 K, the output power for speed 3 was less than the output power for speed 2.

Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9 provide more experimental test results for power and voltage. The two graphs exhibit that the voltage increases with speed rise and there is a maximum power and optimum resistance for each speed.

Figure 4.9 Second test after modification (voltage versus resistance). This power reduction was due to a leakage in the harvester rubber, which made by sharp epoxy edges. This sharp edge was also removed by a file (Figure 4.10).

Figure 4.10 Slut was made due to edge of epoxy. More experimental tests were performed after sealing the rubber and cutting the sharp edge of the epoxy. Figure 4.11 (a) shows the generated voltage (Vrms) with respect to different electrical load resistances (R) at speeds of 1 mph, 2 mph, 3 mph and 4 mph. The test results show that the voltage increases with the resistance and the speed. Figure 4.11 (b) shows the generated average power versus the resistance at different speeds. For each speed there is an optimal 47

4.2 Theoretical Simulation and Comparison
Although Tang [57] presents an analytical model for a clamped circular bimorph piezo diaphragm, he has not performed any experimental tests to compare experimental results with the theoretical calculations. In Figure 4.12, Figure 4.13, Figure 4.14, and Figure 4.15 the experimental results are compared with the results calculated using the model (Eqs. (2.5) and (2.44)). As calculated in ANSYS modeling, the deflection of the diaphragm center point ( ) is 75.2 Âµm. The measured frequencies, which are measured by oscilloscope during experimental tests on the treadmill, are  4.95 rad/s,  5.52 rad/s,  6.45 rad/s,  7.22 rad/s for speeds of 1mph, 2 mph,

3 mph and 4 mph, respectively. These four figures show the calculated maximum powers are higher than the tested results. For example the predicted maximum powers at speeds of 4 mph, 3 mph, 2 mph and 1 mph are 1.58 mW, 1.39 mW, 1.2 mW and 1.07 mW, respectively; while the experimental results are 1.14 mW, 0.82 mW, 0.65 mW, and 0.55 mW. The optimum experimental resistances for generating the maximum powers are also different from the calculated values.

Figure 4.15 Comparing experimental output powers with predicted theoretical power values in different resistances for 4 mile/hour. 4.2.1 Results Analysis and Discussion The discrepancy between the calculated results and experimental results are mainly attributed to the assumption of zero damping made in the model in order to simplify the process of deriving the power formula [57]. In practical harvester, the damping is not zero. It lowers the 51

generated power and affects the optimal resistive load [1] [3] [34-35] [60-61] [78]. Theoretical equations of the power and optimum resistance for a two piezo layer cantilever with proof mass are presented by Roundy [1] [3]. He proves that power and optimum resistance not only depend on harvester dimensions and frequency but also depend on damping ratio ( ) and piezoelectric coupling coefficient ( ). For a real system the optimal external load is modified to [3]:


(4.1)

Damping ratio which depends on type of piezo harvester and its dimensions and configuration [59-60] is 4.3 for a cantilever-beam type which operates in the {3-1} mode [60].

Foot Stepping Force In conventional shoe embedded PZT power harvesters, the high stepping static/impact

force is directly acting on a PZT-metal structure, which leads to a low reliability and short life time due to the fragility nature of PZT materials and the vulnerability of the bonding between the PZT and metal under periodic impact force. The shoe embedded PZT harvester developed in this paper can solve the problems of low reliability and short life time through an air pump design. In the following subsections, the stepping force acting on the harvester is measured. 4.3.1 Force Experimental Test Set Up The stepping force acting on the harvester is measured using a force sensor (A401 flexi force sensor from Tekscan, INC.) with a 1 inch sensing area. A 5 mm thick poly carbonate circular plate of 1 inch in diameter (the same diameter of sensor sensing area) is glued on the sensor. Then a 5 mm thick polycarbonate plate of 50 mm in diameter is glued on the top plate of the harvester (Figure 4.16). These parts are attached by super glue. The measured signal is

52

wirelessly transmitted to a receiver which is connected to a computer, as shown in Figure 4.17. The oscilicope also measures the open circuite voltage ( ) and piezo excitation frequency.

The stepping force was measured when stepping randomly on the floor including stepping on the floor as hard as poosible. The maximum measured stepping force was 902.5 N (460 kpa) as shown in Figure 4.19. The harvester survived all tests without degrading the performance. The measured steeping force matches the results have reported in other articles [40-48]. Actually the harvester can take even much higher force, a force as high as the harvester housing can take, according to the air pump type design as shown in Figure 2.1.

Chapter 5 Summary and Future Work
5.1 Summary
In all existing shoe piezo power generators, the foot pressure is directly on the piezo material, which is very fragile. Moreover, bonding between the piezo and the metal layer is weak and cannot tolerate long walking times. In this thesis, a shoe embedded air pump type piezoelectric power harvester has been developed and tested which can solve the problem of shoe piezo harvesters. In this harvester, the PZT deforms to generate electric power due to the air pressure difference caused by the air pump which is subject to the stepping force. Thus the high static/impact stepping force is not directly acting on the PZT-metal composite structure as is the case in most conventional designs, which leads to significantly improved reliability and life time. Experimental tests showed an average power of 1.12 mW was generated when the harvester is embedded in the show and the shoe wearer walked on the treadmill at a speed of 4 mph. An existing analytical modeling for circular bimorph piezo diaphragm was also used to predict the maximum output power. This theory has significant discrepancy for finding the optimum resistance due to neglecting the system damping. Moreover, a method was introduced for measuring the impact force on the harvester during walking, jagging, and jumping. The stepping force acting on the harvester was measured as high as 902.5 N. This harvester has also the capability to put the air bellow inside the shoes and the piezo chamber part outside the shoes which means that the piezo part can be accessible and be used for different shoes.

57

5.2 Future Work
The future work of this project should focus on the following:  The design can be improved with increasing the air pressure by modifying the chamber size. The internal pressure of the chamber should be measured by pressure sensor to find the real pressure inside the air chamber. This measurement can be used to find the difference between theoretical pressure and real pressure.  Different rubbers should be tested to choose a more reliable rubber. Moreover, moulded bellows (Figure 5.1) can be used which is more useful for air bellows or air pump applications. This type of bellows can also help to solve the weak epoxy problem.

Figure 5.1 Moulded air below is applicable for air pump.  Capacitive load tests should be performed. A circuit should be designed to rectify the AC voltage to lower DC voltage which is suitable for a real small electronic device.

Appendix A Piezoelectric Configurations
A.1Piezoelectric Materials
The material selection for the design is very critical because the maximum power output is closely related to materials properties of the piezoelectric material and the geometry. For the piezoelectric material, these fundamental properties are important [3]:    The piezoelectric strain coefficient (d) - relates strain to electric field The piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g) - relates stress to voltage. Coupling coefficient (k) Â­ material's ability to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy or vice versa.  Dielectric constant () Â­ the higher it is, the lower the source impedance of the generator.   Young's modulus Â­ affects the stiffness of the bender. Tensile strength Â­ which limits the maximum strain that a bender can withstand

There are two commercially available piezoelectric materials, PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) and PVDF (Polyvinlidine Fluoride). In Table A.1 these main types of piezo materials have been compared.

A.2Modes of Piezoelectric
There are two common modes utilized for piezoelectric energy harvesting 33-mode (or stack) and 31-mode (bimorphs). In the 33-mode, the direction of applied stress (force) and generated voltage is the same, while in 31-mode the stress is applied in the axial direction but the voltage is obtained from the perpendicular direction as shown in Figure A.2.

Figure A.2 Operating modes of piezoelectric transducer [12].

A.3Researches Based on Materials, Piezoelectric Patches, and Geometries
Piezoelectric materials can be configured in many different ways that improve output power. One way to improve configuration of the power harvesting device is modification of piezoelectric materials. In Table A.2, a summary of investigations and advantages/ disadvantages of mentioned materials can be seen. 60

The efficiency of a power harvester can also be improved by using multilayer piezoelectric materials. In Table A.3, various devices using multiple piezoelectric patches have been mentioned. Moreover, a lot of articles have focused on the geometry of power harvesters including changing shape, adding prestress and electrode pattern (Table A.4).
