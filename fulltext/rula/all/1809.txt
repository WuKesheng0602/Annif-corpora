EFFECTS OF SHINGLES IN GRANULAR MATERIAL AND ASPHALT

Narayan B. Shrestha

Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering RYERSON UNIVERSITY, Toronto, Canada, 2009

ABSTRACT
This thesis evaluates the potential use of processed tear-off shingles in road works. Six types of granular materials were investigated to determine the type of material that benefitted the most from using the shingles

The effects of shingles on the stability, as measured by California Bearing Ratio, were found to depend on properties such as gradation and fines content. In general shingles enhanced the stability of materials of relatively low CBR, but decreased the stability of angular well graded material of CBR larger than 100%. Optimum amount of shingles were found to enhance the resistance of stabilized granular materials to cycles of freezing and thawing; however, amounts higher than optimum decreased the resistance to freezing and thawing. In terms of permeability, the addition of shingles did not have a significant effect on the drainage characteristics of the tested materials. A trial road was constructed and showed that after one week of construction dust generated by the control section was found to be twice the amount of dust generated by the shingle section.

Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Use of recycled materials has become common practice as it 1s both economical and environmentally friendly. Both roof shingles and concrete are potential recycling materials. Bituminous shingles contain approximately 30% asphalt-cement binder (Marks and Petermeier, 1997). In addition to saving landfill space, the benefits of reusing recycled asphalt shingles as aggregate may include improved compactability, though this has so far not been tested or proved (CIWMB, 2009a). Processing shingles costs approximately US$30 per ton which is about US$10 less than the tipping fee at many local landfills (Grodinsky et al., 2002). Currently, the most common disposal method for asphalt shingles in the US is land filling (Mallick et al., 2000; Zickell, 2003). However, landfills are often located a great distance to the demolition sites, and hence transportation costs become an important cost consideration (PTWE, 2004).

Recycled concrete can be used for fill, bank stabilization, pavement for trails and other purposes.

It is environmentally friendly as it replaces natural virgin aggregates. Where good aggregate is
not available locally or is difficult to dispose of, recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) can often be used (PTWE, 2004).

The following estimates exist regarding the volume of shingle waste generated each year in the United States. Seventy-seven plants produce approximately 13,000,000 tons of shingles per year, of which some 65% are used for restoring roofs on houses. An equivalent amount of old shingles is thus removed and discarded (Brock, 2007). About 1.25 million scrap asphalt and saturated-felt shingles are generated from Canadian residential asphalt tear-off (re-roofing) shingles, new construction scrap, and related organic-felt scrap quantities (ASMI, 2007). Asphalt shingles are

1

the most common type of roofing material used in both new homes and roof replacements, accounting for more than 60% of the residential roofing market in the United States (Foth et al., 2006). Approximately 11 million tons of asphalt-shingle waste is generated each year in the United States, of which most comes from either building renovations and demolitions or directly from the shingle manufacturers (Townsend et al., 2007), but, according to Dykes (2007), less than 5% of shingle waste is recycled. About 80% of the homes in the United States are covered with asphalt shingles due to their relatively light weight, comparatively low cost, ease of installation and low maintenance requirements (Enotes, 2008).

Shingles contain approximately 30% asphalt cement binder (Marks and Petermeier, 1997). The potential reuse of shingles includes use in Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA), as cold (asphalt) patching for roadways, as rural road base course to control dust, in temporary roads and driveways, in road/driveway aggregate base, in new shingle manufacturing, as fuel supplement in cement kilns, and as mulch (Townsend et al., 2007). As more than 4.5x10 11 kg ofHMA are produced annually in the U.S., adding only 2% shingles to HMA would be sufficient to consume all shingle waste (Button et al., 1995). If the roofing material generated by re-roofing projects were used in HMA rather than sent to the landfill, the load on North Carolina's landfills could be reduced by nearly 130,000 cubic yards each year (Hanson et al., 1997).

Shingles made before 1980 usually contain 50 to 55% asphalt with a felt or paper reinforcing mat, surface granules, filler, and backing materials. Shingles made after 1980 contains 20 to 30% asphalt with fiberglass reinforcing material, roofing surface granules, filler, and backing materials (Pavelek and Michael, 1996). Pavelek and Michael estimate that about 40% of manufactured roofing shingles are used in roof replacements. They estimate the annual

2

production of new shingles to range within 2,100,000 to 3,360,000 tons. During the manufacturing process approximately 73,500 to 94,000 tons of waste material is produced annually, representing between 14,700 and 28,200 tons of asphalt.

Townsend et al. (2007) note that significant growth in the asphalt-shingle recycling industry has occurred in recent years. At least 17 states (Florida, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, North Carolina, Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee, Vermont and Texas) are using re-roof asphalt shingles in HMA applications for road projects (Foth et al., 2006). The main sources of RCA are demolition works in road/highway rehabilitation projects (46% comes from demolition, 32% from road works, and the rest from construction, waste concrete and debris). In the United States, demolition of roads and buildings generates more than 200 million tons of recycled aggregates each year. RCA accounts for roughly 5% of the total aggregates needed (more than 2 billion tons per year) (PTWE, 2004).

Due to the lower unit weight of RCA, it is economically attractive to contractors for use in road construction and as railroad base material, fill, or as pavement constituents. On the basis of weight and volume, production of RCA is the biggest recycling industry in the United States. The Construction Materials Recycling Association (CMRA) estimates that more than 100 million tons of concrete are recycled every year in the U.S. (PWTE, 2004).

1.2

Research Objectives

The objective of this research project was to investigate the effects of adding shingles to granular

3

materials and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). Within this main objective the research focused on investigating the effects of adding shingles on: · · · · · · stability and hydraulic conductivity of granular materials; stability of sand; indirect tensile strength of stabilized granular material; resistance of granular materials to freezing and thawing; dust control for exposed gravel roads; and moisture-induced damages in Hot Mix Asphalt containing shingles.

This research project consisted of both an experimental laboratory program and a field trial, which investigated the effects of shingles on a gravel road.

1.3 Outline of Thesis
This thesis is divided into five chapters. Chapter 2 presents a literature review on the effects of shingles in granular material, cold patches and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). Chapter 3 describes the materials used and the methodologies of the experimental testing program. Chapter 4 presents the test results and an analytical discussion. Finally, Chapter 5 summarizes and concludes this research work and provides recommendations for future research.

Chapter 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
The following review of the literature aims to provide an understanding of the use of shingles and RCA in both gravel roads and HMA. The limited number of papers reviewed here provides an indication that the recycling of shingles has yet to become a major research focus.

2.1 Shingles
Asphalt shingles are the most commonly used roofing material in both new homes and roof replacements (Townsend et al. , 2007). Roll roofing made of asphalt-coated felt has been manufactured in the United States since 1893. Inorganic base materials have replaced traditional organic felt since the late 1950s, as they are more fire resistant and absorb less asphalt during the manufacturing process, thus reducing weight. Fiber-glass matting is the most popular asphaltshingle base material since the late 1970s.

2.1.1 Composition of Shingles
Bituminous shingles contain approximately 30% asphalt cement binder (Marks and Petermeier, 1997). Tables 2.1 and 2.3 and Figure 2.1 provide details of the typical composition of asphalt shingles.

Mineral filler/stabilizer (limestone, silica, dolomite dust) used in shingles usually has a particle size (diameter) of less than 0.15mm, with at least 70% being smaller than 0.08mm. The content of sand-sized minerals in shingles ranges between 20-38% by mass (Powell, 2007). Granular material consists of sand-sized rock (Warner et al., 2007) and of basalt (Sengoz and Topal, 2004). The CBR of asphalt shingles lies within a range of 1% and 3% depending on shingle size (Warner and Edil, 2007). Table 2.2 provides an overview of the performance characteristics of new asphalt shingles.

(Source: Newcomb et al., 1993) The main types of shingles are glass-felt shingles and organic-backed shingles. Felt backing material and fibrous asphalt stabilizers are only permitted for glass-felt shingles (Newcomb et al., 1993). Asphalt used in shingles is considerably harder than that used in pavements (see section
6

Z.l) with penetration values at 77°F ranging between 20dmm (decimillimeter) and 70dmm, as compared to between 50dmm and 300dmm for paving asphalts. Asphalt for shingles is stabilized with limestone powder (Newcomb et al., 1993).

(Source: Newcomb et al., 1993) Note: Ceramic Granules are small crushed rock particles coated with ceramic metal oxides. Heap lap granules are coal slag ground to roughly the same size as the ceramic particles. Backsurfacer sand is washed natural sand which prevents the shingles from sticking to each other.

2.1.2 Sources and Generation
Shingles may contain materials, like wood, plastic wrap and other deleterious materials, which need to be separated prior to processing (Townsend et al., 2007). Waste shingles are of two types:

1. Post-manufacturing: Post-manufacturing asphalt-shingle waste is the scrap portion left

over from the manufacturing process. Approximately 5 to 10% (550,000 to 1,100,000 tons) of total asphalt-waste generated in United States is scrap. This material is generally uniform and homogeneous.

2. Post-consumer: The main source of waste shingles is post-consumer asphalt shingles, which form part of the debris produced during construction, demolition and renovation of buildings {Townsend et al., 2007). Depending on the manufacturing technology the

7

service life of an asphalt-shingle roof is approximately 12 to 25 years. Approximately 7 to 9 million tons of post-consumer shingles are generated annually in the U.S., the asphalt and aggregate content of which may vary depending on the manufacturer, the degree of weathering and the degree of aging from exposure to ultraviolet sunlight.

2.1.3 Manufacturing Process
Asphalt is converted to oxidized asphalt by a process known as "blowing", i.e. the introduction of bubbles of oxygen into the liquid asphalt, which increases asphalt viscosity (NIOSH, 2001; Townsend et al., 2007). The base material (a layer of organic material (cellulose or wood fiber) or fiberglass) is coated by passing it through a saturator tank filled with hot asphalt (Townsend et al., 2007). Finely ground lime, silica, slate dust, dolomite and other mineral materials are used as stabilizers (NIOSH, 2001 ). One side of the shingles is surfaced with granules for protection against physical and sun damage (Townsend et al., 2007). In some plants, stabilized coating asphalt is applied to the top and bottom surfaces of the webbing sheet (NIOSH 2001 ). The granules remain exposed in the roofing application and are made of crushed rock coated with ceramic metal oxides (Townsend et al., 2007). A light coating of fine sand is applied on the bottom side to prevent shingles from sticking to each other during packaging and transport.

2.1.4 Asbestos Content in Shingles
A common concerns regarding reuse of roofing shingle is the potential presence of asbestos, which was used in shingles in the past, but few asbestos-containing tear-off shingles remain (Foth et al., 2006). The Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) tested 368 shingle samples between 1994 and 1997, but found asbestos in only 0.8% (3 samples). Similarly no samples containing asbestos were found when 2000 samples were tested by the Central Construction and

8

Demolition recycling facility in Des Moines (Iowa) in 2001. And only 1.67% of over 750 saJllples samples tested by the Waste Commission for Scott County in 2004 contained asbestos (Foth et al., 2006). Townsend et al. (2007) report that of 27,694 samples collected in Maine, Iowa, Florida, Missouri, Minnesota and Massachusetts asbestos was detected in 1.53% sample. Table 2.4 provides an overview of American manufacturers of asbestos-containing asphalt roofing products.

2.1.5 Collection and Processing
Post-manufacturing shingle scrap is clean and consists of a combination of remnants and scraps from the manufacturing process and damaged or off-specification shingles. Since it is free of

9

potential contaminants (e.g., nails), it is sought after for recycling. Contaminants such as packaging materials and strapping should be removed prior to recycling (Townsend et al., 2007).

Land Filling
Large amounts of asphalt-shingle waste end up in landfills (Zickell, 2003). Shingles are accepted at construction-and-demolition debris landfills. Some landfills charge a reduced tipping fee and use the shingles as road-base material or pads for trucks (Townsend et al., 2007).

Recycling
Both post-manufacturing and post-consumer waste shingles require processing before reuse (Townsend et al., 2007). Factory scrap shingles become plastic due to the heat and mechanical action of the shredding process, whereas tear-off roofing shingles have hardened with age. Factory shingles also tend to agglomerate making shredding of factory scrap more difficult than shredding of roofing shingles (Grodinsky et al., 2002). Recycling includes the following steps: (a) removal of all non-shingle waste; (b) reduction in size; (c) grinding and screening; (d) removal of nails, paper and other contaminants; and (e) screening to achieve the desired product size (Townsend et al., 2007).

2.2 Recycled Concrete Aggregates Used as Base Course
Recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) accounts for roughly 5% of the total aggregates market (more than 2 billion tons per year) in the U.S., with an estimated 85% being used as road base due to its availability, low transport cost, and good physical properties. The quality of RCA depends mainly on the properties of aggregates in the original concrete (PWTE, 2004).

10

In addition to laboratory tests, RCA and limestone test sections were constructed at the

University of Central Florida Circular Accelerated Test Track (UCF-CATT) for a performance test of base courses, and a total of 362,198 load repetitions (representing a pavement life expectancy of over 36 years) were applied to the test sections. No rutting was found in any of the test sections (Kuo et al., 2002). Many transverse cracks and one longitudinal crack occurred in the limestone section, but no cracks were observed in RCA test section, indicating that the allowable number of load repetitions for RCA sections is likely to be very high for both fatigue and rutting.

Properties ofRecycled Concrete Aggregate
The following discussion summarizes the literature with respect to basic properties of RCA. These properties may be taken as representative of many types of RCA. Topcu (2004) reports that the fineness modulus of Waste Concrete Aggregate (WCA) was 5.50, unit weight 2470 kg/m3 ,1oose unit weight 1160 kg/m3 , and water absorption 7% (after 30 min). The quality of RCA as building material depended to a great extent on the quality of the aggregates used in the demolished concrete (Chini et al., 1999).

Specific Gravity: The SSD specific gravities of recycled coarse aggregates with sizes 19.037.5mm, 12.5-19.0mm and 4.75-12.5mm were 2.455, 2.459 and 2.475, respectively (Won, 1999). The specific gravity of RCA was lower than that of the virgin aggregat~, as the specific gravity ofthe mortar attached to the RCA was about 2.05. The lower specific gravity of RCA fines was due to their porous structure (Won, 1999).

Absorption value: The average water absorption rates of coarse aggregates with sizes 19.037.5mm, 12.5-19.0mm and 4.75-12.5mm were 3.9%, 4.0% and 4.1 %, respectively. The high

11

absorption rates were due to the highly porous old mortar attached to the RCA (Won, 1999; PWTE, 2004). Absorption of fine RCA was 7.9%, which was much higher than that of river sand (<1 %) (Won, 1999). Soundness: Due to the presence of old mortar, sodium-sulfate soundness loss was greater than magnesium soundness loss in RCA, despite higher magnesium soundness loss for the virgin aggregate (Won, 1999). The author does not provide an explanation for these experimental results.

Loss Angeles (LA) value: LA of recycled aggregate was generally high. According to the Texas Department of Transportation the maximum LA for RCA was 40 (Won, 1999). Hansen · and N arud found that, for aggregates produced from high strength concrete, the LA abrasion loss values were 22.4% and 41.4% for aggregate sizes 16-32mm and 4-8 mm, respectively (Topcu, 1997).

Angularity: The angularity of recycled fines and natural river sand were 38.55% and 34.50%, respectively (Won, 1999). Due to the higher angularity of the RCA fines, stability of asphalt and concrete produced with RCA was higher (PWTE, 2004). Thermal coefficient: As about one-third of the volume of RCA was old mortar, the thermal coefficient of RCA was expected to be higher than that of the virgin aggregate (Won, 1999). The values of thermal coefficient of RCA for sizes 19.0-37.5mm, 12.5-19.0mm and for 4.75-12.5mm were 16x1o-6rc, 19x10-6tC, and 26x10-6tC, while that of virgin siliceous river gravel was about 8x 10-6tC.

Self-cementing properties: The strength of RCA, when used as sub-base material, increased over time due to self-cementing properties which were believed to be governed by the properties of 12

the ftnes portion of the RCA (particle size less than 5mm) (Poon et al., 2006). The results indicated that the size fractions <0.15 and 0.3-0.6mm were most likely to be the principal cause of the self-cementing properties of the RCA fines.
8 m/s for Hydraulic conductivity: Hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 4.9x 1o- 9 to 7 .Ox 1o-

crushed limestone samples (specific surface area of the fines fraction was Ssr = 11.4 m2 /g) and was 1.1 x 1o-6m/s for a sample of crushed limestone for which the specific surface area of the ftnes was unknown (Cote and Konrad, 2003). When comparing crushed granite, crushed shale and crushed limestone, the granite samples showed the highest values for porosity and hydraulic conductivity, while limestone had the lowest values (Cote and Konrad, 2003). Hydraulic conductivity of RCA depended on the duration and methods of curing as shown in Table 2.5.

When dissolution occurred, a possible consequence was an elevation of the groundwater pH due to the leaching of calcium hydroxide from the cement paste (Kelly, 1998). Dense road bases were less susceptible to leaching and may even become more tightly cemented by the chemical reaction as water passes through the material. les 7 -days S-curing

2.3 Use of Shingles as Granular Material
This section provides a review of the literature regarding the use of shingles as granular materials

in both laboratory and field tests. Generally, ground shingles are screened to produce appropriate
particle sizes that can be mixed with gravel to cover rural unpaved roads (CIWMB, 2009a).

13

When vehicles move over stone, gravel and similar surfaces, dust is produced due to crushing and grinding of stones and/or stone particles. A portion of the dust may become airborne because of wind and passing vehicles (Pavelak and Michael, 1996). The use of shingle mixtures reduces dust generation, vehicle noise and road maintenance requirements (Marks and Petermeier, 1997).

Current Calfornia Department of Transportation (Caltrans) specifications do not allow asphalt shingles in aggregate base, and Caltrans Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction (Greenbook) provides no guidance with respect to use of shingles (CIWMB, 2009a). But according to Caltrans, adding 10% "crushed" asphalt roofing shingles to the road-base aggregate led to favourable results (CIWMB, 2009a). In October 1996, the California Integrated Waste
'!I

Management Board, CIWMB, suggested to the Caltrans Pavement Design and Rehabilitation Committee (PDRC) to allow 10% ground tear-off shingles in aggregate bases. PDRC noted that it may be useful to allow shingles in asphalt, but stated that additional performance testing would be required prior to approval (CIWMB, 2009a).

Warner and Edil (2007) found that the maximum dry density of asphalt shingles ranges between 8.8kN/m3 and 12.5kN/m3, depending on shingle size. Optimum moisture content was 8%, but compaction was not very sensitive to water content. CBR of asphalt shingles ranged between 1 and 3 depending on shingle size. The modulus of resilience of shingles depended on shingle size as shown in Figure 2.2. The moduli of resilience for asphalt shingles, gravel with 50% shingle, and gravel were 28-37, 62, and 75-lOOMPa, respectively. The resilient modulus versus bulk stress for shingles (passing 25.4mm) is shown in Figure 2.3. A mix of unstabilized asphalt shingles (50%) and gravel was weak, limiting its use to sub-base material, but fly-ash stabilization (20% Class C) of reroof shingle (passing 9.5mm) improved strength such that it

14

became marginally feasible to use the mix as base material (Mr=50-55 MPa). (Table 2.6 provides

an overview of suggested CBR values for soils used in pavement structures.)

.

Hooper and Marr (2004) found that the addition of 33% asphalt shingles (25.4mm passing) (replacing gravel) reduced CBR from 92% to 23%. Any further addition of shingles reduced the CBR even more, indicating that use of shingle blends should be limited to sub-grade materials. However gravel blended with shingles did not swell significantly when soaked in water. Adding 33% shingles (25mm passing) decreased CBR strength of silty sand from 33% to 19%, which is below the recommended CBR for sub-base use, but, again, the blend did not swell during the saturation procedure. The CBR reduction may have been caused by the reduction of inter-particle friction in highly angular particles in sands and gravels.

The performance of clays improved due to the addition of shingles. The performance of a clay (85% passing N o.200 sieve) with a plasticity index of 13.4 and a CBR of 8%, which is considered "questionable to fair" as sub-grade material, improved after adding of 33% shingles (by volume) (25.4 mm passing). The CBR increased from 8% to 20% and swelling declined from 1.9% to 0.1 %, indicating that the addition of shingles to clay results in "good" to "very good" sub-grade material. The addition of shingles to clay increased the proportion of sand-sized granular particles (retained on sieve No. 200), which may increase shear strength during undrained CBR loading. These results may also be due to the cohesiveness of the clay, which

16

holds the shingle tabs in place and thus prevents slipping of the tabs during CBR loading (Figure 2.4) (Hooper and Marr, 2004).

Figure 2.5: Private Road (Gravel with Shingles) (Source: McMullin, 2007) Field studies have indicated that shingles help bond the aggregate particles together over time (Marks and Petermeier, 1997), and that the strength of certain soils may be increased by adding

17

an asphalt emulsion to the shingle mixes (Hooper and Marr, 2004). They suggest that trial mixes of site-specific materials with the expected field density should always be made to quantify the effect of adding shingles on the strength of the mix. Figure 2.5 and Figure 2.6 show a private road and a sub-division road made with shingle mixtures.

Marks and Petermeier (1997) report on the use of ground shingles, which were used in a roadway in July 1995. A mix of 50% shingles with crushed limestone was used. Approximately 300 tons of ground shingles (passing 1 in.) and 600 tons (passing 2 in.) were blended. Five hundred tons of the shingle mixes were added to the crushed limestone. The ground shingles were placed on top of the crushed stone surface and blended with the help of a grader blade to achieve a uniform mixture. The thickness of the layer was approximately 65mm. Just after blade mixing, a sedan was driven over the roadway at approximately 80 km/h (50 mph), but no dust was generated at the trial section. After six month, the surface seemed to be somewhat "open", and a light spray (fog seal) of 2300L (500 gal.) of cationic slow-setting (CSS) emulsion diluted with 4500L (1 000

18

gal.) of water (0.3 gal. per sq.yd) was applied at a coverage rate of 1.3 L/m to seal the surface. The shingled roadway remained almost entirely dust-free one year after treatment (a sedan driven at 80 kmlh generated almost no dust) and relatively dust-free two years after treatment. The bituminous shingles bound the crushed-stone aggregate and reduced loss of the granular material into the ditches. Benefits also included improved lateral control of cars as well as a smoother and quieter roadway. Similarly, in Altus, Oklahoma, shingles were mixed with reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and used for a parking lot surface (ASMI, 2007). The material was placed, compacted and sprayed with a calcium-chloride solution. The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources reported that the compactibility of the shingle mix was very good (Hooper and Marr, 2004). After the two-year evaluation period, the road resisted rutting and erosion, generated less dust, and maintenance requirements were less than for conventional gravel control sections. Hooper reports that a Massachusetts construction materials firm found that the addition of shingles (76.0mm passing) had positive effects on strength and de formability of an asphalt-amended silty sandy soil.

2.3.1 Light Duty Roadway with Shingle Layers
Pavelak and Machael (1996) discuss the use of shingle layers for light duty roadways. The shingles were cut into cyform strips, which generally retain their shape when used in road bases. The road may be made up with one layer or alternating layers of shingles and crushed aggregate, with the number and thickness of the layers depending on the traffic situation. Hydrocarbon distillates, such as asphalt, paraffin, bitumen and tar, may be used to rejuvenate the asphalt contained in the shredded roofing shingle and to improve adhesion of the binder to the aggregates. The addition of pre-consumer waste-shingle tabs into the layer of used asphalt

19

roofing-shingle pieces enhanced kneadability and improved binding within the shingle layer as the asphalt in the tabs was more flexible and tackier.

Pavelak and Michael ( 1996) also note another important aspect of using layers of shingles and gravel, i.e. that the size of the shingle material may be reduced. They also note that it may be useful to cut the shingles into elongated strips of a size such that they can be graded into a layer with strips overlying one another. Ferrous material like nails should be removed from the shredded shingles prior to use. They suggest that the top-most layer be a layer of crushed aggregate to avoid shingle strips making contact with vehicle tires. Another manufacturing option is the addition of hydrocarbon distillate to the shredded roofing-shingle material at the construction site.

The roadway constructed by Pavelak and Michael was durable and resisted rutting because of the support provided by the shingle pieces which was due to the adhesion within the shingle layers. Traffic noise was reduced due to internal cushioning. The generation of dust was reduced as the shingle layer was impermeable and as crushing of aggregate was reduced because of the flexibility of the shingles. Due to shock absorption and internal adhesion, erosion of the road surface was reduced. This type of roadway was semi-permeable, tolerated freeze/thaw cycles and absorbed or held spilled fuels and oil (Pavelak and Michael, 1996). The cost of this type of road was similar to a conventional light-duty roadway but significantly less than blacktop or concrete surfaces. Maintenance cost was lower than that for a conventional surface (Pavelak and Michael, 1996).

20

2.3.2 Light Duty Roadway by Mixing Gravel with RAP and Shingles
During the 2000 and 2001 construction seasons about 4,000 tons of asphalt/RAP (reclaimed asphalt product)/gravel were laid as road surface in Hinesburg (Texas Hill Road, TH 17) (Figures 2.7 and Figure 2.8) on seven gravel town road sections (0.13-0.51 miles) in six municipalities in locations that were difficult to maintain (Surwilo, 2003). The mix was laid in the following steps: 1. Existing surfaces were graded, and drainage was corrected as needed; 2. The shingle/RAP/gravel mix was spread and graded to a 3" lift thickness; 3. The material was compacted with a vibratory roller; 4. A CaCh solution was applied (600 gallons/mile); and 5. Steps 1-4 were repeated.

Figure 2.7: Shingles Mixed with Granular Material on TH17, Hinesburg (Source: Surwilo, 2003)
Reports by town officials were very positive: the road surface was hard and durable, and not as dusty as it would have been if only natural aggregate had been used. Potholes and wash boarding

21

were less evident, and grading was less frequently required. It was estimated that the cost of the shingle/RAP/gravel mix was $5.50/ton less than the cost of virgin gravel (Surwilo, 2003).

Figure 2.8: Shingles Mixed with Granular Material, TH17, Hinesburg (Source: Surwilo, 2003)

2.4 Use of Shingles as Cold Patch
For cold patches, ground shingles are mixed with aggregate and an emulsion for patching mixes (Newcomb et al., 1993). If tear-off shingles are used, the mix is typically composed of approximately 25% dry roofing material, 3% solvents and 72% aggregate (CIWMB, 2009b). The use of cold patches containing recycled shingles may improve pavement performance due to the fiberglass and/or cellulose fibers contained in the shingles and reduce maintenance cost (CIWMB, 2009b; ASMI, 2007; Grodinsky et al., 2002). Shingles have been employed in cold patches for several years in New Jersey, Washington State, California and the City of Chicago (ASMI, 2007). Presently, Gardner Asphalt Corporation of Tampa, FL, supplies a shingle-cold-patch product ("RePave"), which is a blend of ground roofing shingles, aggregate and an emulsifier, as a pothole- and driveway-repair material that

22

behaves like a "high-performance" patch and has outlasted HMA and traditional cold mixes in field tests. Despite the higher initial cost compared to HMA and traditional cold patches, the overall cost of this patch is less due to the increased lifespan of the road and lower maintenance costs. Shingle cold patches are easier to use than traditional patches due to their lighter weight, slow hardening and ability to withstand traffic loads immediately after application. A few organizations are producing cold-patching materials or paving materials for bicycle paths and park trails containing up to 100% shredded shingles (typically passing 9.5mm), which are blended with aggregate and asphalt rejuvenators (diesel, kerosene or other asphalt rejuvenating agents) to produce patching mixes (Button et al., 1996). The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) paved a low-volume road with RePave. This product is considered to have performed successfully. Grodinsky et al. (2002) note that the performance of RePave may rival that of "high performance" cold patches. The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) reports positive feedback on "RePave" from a number of New Jersey municipalities, the Washington DOT, and the Placer County Department of Public Works (CA) (Grodinsky et al., 2002).

2.5 Use of Shingles in Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA)
Manufacturing waste shingles are obtained directly from manufacturers and thus are a very uniform product with predictable properties, whereas tear-off shingles are variable in quality and contaminated with other building materials. However consumer waste can also be used successfully in HMA (Button et al., 1996). Use of shingles in HMA not only reduced cost but also improved resistance to pavement cracking and rutting as the fibers contained in shingles provided reinforcement (Townsend et al., 2007). One of the benefits of using shingles in HMA is that shingles already contain asphalt cement, granules and fiber. If shingles were not used,

23

producers would have to purchase these materials separately to enhance the mixture (Forth et al., 2006).

Button et al. (1996) also note that the asphalt in shingles has a significantly higher viscosity and may contain proprietary antistripping agents and antioxidants. The fabric backing (usually fiberglass or cellulose) provides strength as well as fatigue resistance (Hanson et al., 1997). Shingle asphalt is, however, hard and therefore does little to coat the virgin aggregate (Button et al., 1996). According to Krivit (2007), the stiffness of the asphalt cement may also inhibit compaction. Griffiths and Krstulovich (2002) found that shingle tabs result in stiffer mixes with improved temperature susceptibility and rut resistance, but that the shingles may be susceptible to moisture-related damage. He suggests that an anti-strip or retained-stability test should be performed whenever shingles are used. The heating and mixing processes during sample preparation in the laboratory were sufficient to melt and disintegrate most of the roofing particles as well as larger pieces (Button et al., 1996).

A comparison of asphalt added to and extracted from the different mixtures is shown in Table 2.7.

.

The Florida DOT allows up to 10% of waste shingles with a maximum size of 25mm by mass of HMA, but due to the hardness of the asphalt in the shingles, Florida DOT uses AC-20 bitumen instead of the usual AC-30 bitumen. Draft specifications of the Minnesota DOT allow only 5%

24

19mm shingles (Button et al., 1996). Field tests with 5% and 7% shingle by-product were carried out in Minnesota in 1991 . In some cases the test sections performed as well as the control sections more than a decade later ("Roofing shingles and roads", 2002).

According to reports of field trials in Nevada and Minnesota, addition of shredded shingles (25mm passing) reduced indirect tensile strength at 25°C, Hveem stability, Marshall stability and resilient modulus. Marshall flow and the failure strain of the mixtures were increased (Button et al., 1996).

According to Button et al. (1996) the Tennessee DOT replaced 5% sand and 5% screenings (dense-graded mixture) with 10% shingles. The virgin asphalt content was slightly reduced, and the mix temperature was increased by 6°C. The test results were described as very satisfactory. In 1994, the Georgia DOT performed field tests near Savannah by adding 5% shredded shingles to virgin aggregate. DOT representatives considered this test a success (Button et al., 1996). Test results of a trial project at Lynn Rd., Raleigh, NC, in 1995 showed that HMA with shingles performed as well as conventional HMA mixes, but that the mixture was stiffer due to sharp angular aggregate, polymers and the asphalt cement contained in the shingles (Hanson et al., 1997). Hanson does not provide a description of the types of polymers used.

Research conducted in Nevada showed that the cost of asphalt mixtures with shingles was lower than that of conventional HMA. Mixtures with shingle content of up to 20% have performed acceptably well in laboratory tests. The properties of the shingle-asphalt cement (e.g., softness) should be considered when selecting shingles for use in HMA (Newcomb et al., 1993).

25

Fiber-reinforced asphalt mixes were successful in resisting shoving and rutting in traffic lanes in the City of Columbus (Newcomb et al., 1993). An Indiana study found that a fiber (polypropylene) reinforced mixture retarded the growth of reflective cracks and improved the maintainability of the overlaid sections. Research at Clemson University, South Carolina, showed that polyester fibers increased tensile strength and toughness of mixes. A Finnish elongation-test study showed that the addition of fibers increased the strain capacity of asphalt. Fibers increased the softening point temperature of the mixes. The surface area of the fibers influenced the absorption of asphalt cement. Cellulose fibers, for instance, are porous and have a flat cross-section, resulting in a larger specific surface area than for glass or other fibers. A qualitative comparison of binding effects of cellulose, fiberglass, polyester and mineral fibers found that cellulose fibers had the greatest stabilizing effect on liquid asphalt cement, which in tum affected the optimum asphalt content of asphalt mixtures with fibers. Hanson et al. (1997) reported that the PG grade of the asphalt binder increased due to the addition of shingles as shown in Table 2.8. Table 2.8: PG Grades in HMA Mixtures Mix No Shingle 5% Shingle 10% Shingle A PG 64-22 PG 70-16 PG 76-10 B PG 64-22 PG 70-16 >PG 76-10* *-The grade of the recycled binder was greater than PG 76-10 (Source: Hanson et al., 1997) Disposal cost for shingles ranges from $18 per ton to $60 per ton in United States, and the cost of hot mix asphalt may be reduced by $2.79 per ton by using 5% organic shingles (Hanson et al., 1997). Kandhal (1992) estimates that HMA cost can be reduced by $3.08 per megagram (Mg) by adding 5% organic shingles.

2.5.1 Use of Shingles in Dense-graded Mixtures
Effect of Shingles on Marshall Stability
Marshall-stability values were higher for samples with 4% and 4.5% binder content after 1% shingles had been added than for control samples with an optimum binder content of 5%. Addition of roofing shingles to HMA thus reduced the optimum asphalt content by approximately 0.5% (Table 2.11 ). Mixtures containing shingles have fewer air voids because they are easier to compact than conventional mixtures and because the shingles contain a higher amount of fillers (30% filler) (Sengoz and Topal, 2004).

According to Brock (2007), Marshall stability at optimum asphalt content decreased if 5% shingles were added (Table 2.9). And Senzog (2004) reported that stability values of mixtures containing 3% and 4% shingles were lower than those of control samples, although they remained above the minimum specification value of 900 kg (Table 2.1 0). Stability increased when binder content was reduced and 1% shingles were added (Table 2.11 ).

Newcomb et al. (1993) report that the addition of pre-consumer fiberglass shingles or of postconsumer shingles (where it was not known whether the shingles contained felt or fiberglass) reduced the optimum binder content, but no reduction of neat asphalt content was required when pre-consumer felt-backed shingles were added. Compared to the control sample, optimum asphalt-cement content was reduced by 12%, if 5% fiberglass shingles were added, and by 25%, if 7.5% fiberglass shingles were added. Marshall stability generally improved due to the addition of shingles, with the exception of adding 5% felt-backed shingles to for 851100 pen asphalt or 7.5% felt-backed shingles to 120/150 pen asphalt. These results are shown in Table 2.13. (No explanations for these exceptions were provided by Newcomb.) The Florida DOT found increasing Marshall stability, tensile strength and resistance to rutting (from wheel tracking test) when factory shingle waste was added to HMA (Button et al., 1996).

Effect of Shingles on Indirect Tension
Mallick et al. (2000) found that indirect tensile strength depended on the shingle content. At 4°C the tensile strengths of a control mixture and of mixtures with 3% shingles, 5% shingles and 7% shingles were 380.5, 430.05, 415.07 and 448.9, respectively. (Note that the author did not provide units for these values.) The addition of manufacturing waste or consumer fines reduced the tensile strength in dense-graded mixtures (Button et al., 1996) as shown in Figure 2.9. The indirect tensile test (ASTM D 4123) indicated the susceptibility of the mixture to fatigue cracking (higher strength indicates better performance with respect to fatigue cracking) (Hanson et al., 1997). Indirect tensile strength was not significantly different (Mallick et al., 2000). But

29

according to Newcomb et al. (1993), indirect tensile strength depended on the grade of the asphalt and the type of shingles.

Figure 2.9: Indirect Tensile Strength at 25° C for Dense-graded Specimens Containing Shingles (Button et al., 1995) Note: MW: Manufacture waste, CF: Consumer waste-fine.

Effect of Shingles on Hveem Stability
Hveem stability decreased for HMA consistently when roofing waste was added (manufacture waste or consumer-waste fines) . The stability reduction was independent of the type or quantity of the roofing waste added, but the average Hveem stability remained at an acceptable level (more than 35%) for all mixtures (Button et al., 1996). Button also showed that fibrous shingle flakes did not completely disintegrate during mixing. The reduction of Hveem stability of the mixtures was due to these flakes and individual fibers reducing stone-to-stone contact, thereby reducing the angle of internal friction of the mixture. The effect of shingles on stability of coarsematrix, high-binder (CMHB) mixtures was less than on dense-graded mixtures due to relatively thicker asphalt films and the higher VMA of the CMHB mixtures. The CMHB mixtures were

30

therefore better able to accommodate roofing waste than the dense graded mixtures (Button et al.,

1996).

Effect of shingles on Rutting
Mallick et al. (2000) found that rut depths for mixes with post-manufacture shingles were significantly smaller than the rut depths of the control mix. Rut depths of 4.91mm, 1.91mm and 1.4mm, respectively, obtained for the control mix and for mixtures with 5% and 7% shingles. Shingle tabs resulted in a stiffer mix with improved temperature susceptibility and rut resistance (Griffiths et al. , 2002).

Fig. 2.10: Rutting due to the Addition of Shingles (Sengoz and Topal, 2004) Figlire 2.10 visualizes the extent to which the addition of roofing shingles improved rutting resistance of the mixture. Mallick et al. (2000) also found that the addition of shingles reduced rutting potential significantly and that rut depths at room temperature for the mixes with shingles were significantly smaller than those of control mixes.

Effect ofShingles on Texas DoT Static Creep Test
Button et al. (1996) found that, although the addition of shingles in dense graded mixtures had negative effects on static creep, all mixtures passed the TxDOT's permanent-strain criterion (Table 2.14). But none passed the slope criterion (slope of the steady state portion of the creep curve), and only mixtures with 5% manufacturing waste satisfied the stiffness criterion as shown in Table 2.14. Generally, creep stiffness of dense-graded mixtures decreased significantly when roofmg shingles were added.

Effect of Shingles on Temperature Susceptibility
Newcomb et al. (1993) also investigated the resilient modulus of mixtures containing shingles. His results are inconclusive, however. The resilient modulus of the control mixtures (densegraded mixtures prepared with 120/150 pen grade binder) at 1oc was 1.5 to 2 times greater than that of a felt-shingle mixture, but similar to mixtures with re-roof waste. At 25°C, the resilient modulus of the control mixture was consistent with that of a mix with 5% shingles, but at 40°C the control mixture was slightly stiffer, except for a mixture with 5% felt roofing waste. Mixture stiffness decreased at all temperatures when roofing-shingle content was increased from 5% to 7.5%. This effect was less pronounced for harder types of binder (Newcomb et al., 1993). A mixture with 7.5% fiberglass manufacturing shingles was softest, followed by felt-backed

32

shingles. Mixtures with re-roofing shingles were stiffest. The softer behavior of the shingle mixtures was due to the increased binder content of the asphalt in the roofing waste. Figure 2.11 shows that the temperature dependence of the resilient modulus was only marginally affected by the shingle content of the dense-graded mixtures (Button et al., 1996).

Figure 2.11: Resilient Modulus versus Temperature with Shingles (Button et al., 1995)

Effect of Shingles on Moisture Sensitivity
Moisture sensitivity was measured as the difference in tensile strength between dry and conditioned samples and as the ratio of the wet and dry tensile strengths. This ratio is known as the tensile strength retained (TSR) (Janisch and Turgeon, 1996).

Moisture resulted in similar loss of strength, as measured by resilient modulus and tensile strength, for the control sample and samples containing felt-backed shingles. In consequence feltbacked shingles had no effect on moisture sensitivity (Newcomb et al., 1993). However the test results for mixtures with the fiberglass-backed shingles showed that moisture sensitivity depended on the grade of the asphalt cement used: For the softer 120/150 pen asphalt cement the change of the resilient modulus due to variation of the moisture content was very similar for both

33

the control and the fiberglass-shingle mixes as shown in Figure 2.12. But for the harder 85/100 pen asphalt cement, moduli decreased for both unconditioned and conditioned asphalt, as shown in Figure 2.13. Although the unconditioned tensile strengths of both softer and harder asphalt cement decreased, loss of strength was higher for the harder asphalt as shown in Figures 2.14 and 2.15. But conditioned tensile strength was similar to the control, except when 7.5% shingles were added to the harder asphalt cement. When the samples were conditioned, strength increased about 20% for softer asphalt cement as shown in Figure 2.14. But addition of fiberglass shingles increased conditioned strength by 50% while addition of 7.5% led to an additional increase of only 10% for harder asphalt cement as shown in Figure 2.15 (Newcomb et al., 1993). Due to the inconsistent increase in strength it was difficult to conclude whether or not fiberglass shingles decreased moisture sensitivity.

The addition of re-roof shingles resulted in unconditioned moduli increasing about 40% for softer 120/150 pen asphalt, but with the stiffer 85/100 pen asphalt the modulus hardly changed at all (Newcomb et al. , 1993). The reduction in strength after conditioning was similar to that of feltbacked shingles. The unconditioned tensile strengths depended on the percentage of re-roof shingles and the grade of the binder. Tensile strength of modified mixtures were slightly different than control mixtures for both asphalt cement grade (120/150 and 85/100 pen) when 5% shingles were added, but with the addition of 7.5% shingles tensile strength decreased 30% for a sample made with the 85/100 pen asphalt cement. These differences further increased after conditioning. The 120/150 pen asphalt-cement samples with 7.5% re-roof waste failed after conditioning, and it appeared that increasing the proportion of re-roof shingles in a given mixture adversely affected moisture sensitivity.

Mixing and compaction temperatures for mixtures containing roofing shingles were 14 oc higher than for the control in order to improve the adhesion of asphalt to the aggregate. Laboratory results showed improved resistance to moisture due to the higher temperature.

.

Effect of Shingle on Low-Temperature Behaviour
Low-temperature results as well as statistical analyses showed that the volumetric and lowtemperature properties of the control mix and mixes with shingles were not significantly different (Mallick et al., 2000). Sengoz and Topal (2004) found that fiberglass-shingle waste did not affect the low-temperature properties of the mixtures and that it may improve the resistance to fatigue cracking of pavements. He suggested that more tests need to be performed to evaluate fatiguecracking properties of HMA. But Krivit (2007) found that HMA with shingles can be more susceptible to low-temperature cracking due to the stiffer binder.

According to Newcomb et al. (1993), for the softer 120/150 pen asphalt, tensile strengths at cold temperatures (-18°C) decreased about 10% and 55% for additions of 5% felt-backed shingles and 7.5% felt-back shingles, respectively. Strain also decreased as shingle content increased, with the

37

exception of felt shingles. In the case of harder 851100 pen asphalt cement, strength decreased 45% (5% shingles) and 55% (7.5% shingles), but failure strain increased by about 25% (5% shingles) and more than 40% (7 .5% shingles). The strain ability of the 85/100 pen mixtures with felt-backed shingles was equal to unmodified 120/150 pen mixtures at cold temperatures, indicating that low-temperature behavior can be improved by adding felt-backed shingles. The magnitude of the decline in tensile strain was independent of the percentage of shingles added. Strain decreased 35% with 120/150 pen asphalt, but hardly any change occurred with 851100 mixtures, which indicates that fiberglass shingles were not advantageous for low temperature behavior.

For mixtures with 120/150 pen asphalt cement the strain reductions were 30% and 50% for reroof shingle content of 5% and 7.5%, respectively, whereas for the 85/100 pen asphalt cement the reductions were 15% and 45% for shingle content of 5% and 7.5%, respectively. This difference in behaviour of felt-back shingles and fiber-back shingles was due to higher neat binder content of the mixtures with felt-backed shingles (Newcomb et al. 1993).

Effect of Shingles on Permanent Deformation Characteristics
Creep compliance is the axial strain at a point in time over the center third of the sample divided by the applied stress, Higher creep compliance implies a greater tendency for deformation (Newcomb et al., 1993). The 30-minute-creep compliance at 25°C for 7.5% shingle content was higher than for 5% shingles, which indicates greater strain, but the relationship was reversed at 40°C. Creep compliance was lower for the 85/100 control samples than for mixtures containing shingles, but the opposite occurred for samples made with 120/150 asphalt cement. Thus the addition of shingles to the softer 120/150 pen asphalt improved resistance to permanent

38

deformation but reduced resistance of the harder 85/100 pen asphalt. At 40°C, the results indicate the onset of failure of the control sample. Creep compliances at 40°C of the other samples were higher than those tested at 25°C, except for the samples with 7.5% re-roof shingles.

2.5.2 Field Observations
The MN/DOT tested overlay projects on Trunk Highway 25 south of Mayer in 1991 and on the Willard Munger recreational trail in 1990. Mixtures with shingle scraps performed as well as the control sections (Janisch and Turgeon, 1996). Scott County prepared HMA incorporating manufacturing shingles in 1991. When the project was reviewed in 1995, the test sections were found to be in excellent condition with minimal transverse cracking. Shingle scrap added to the HMA contributed between 0.27% and 0.30% asphalt cement to the wearing course as shown in Table 2.16. Shingle-scrap sections were harder than the control sections but the amount of cracking of the test sections was the same, indicating that a small increase in stiffness did not cause problems.

The temperature dependence of the resilient modulus of field mixes (mixture of felt-back shingle and fiberglass shingle but predominately felt shingles) was similar to that of laboratory-prepared

Effect of Shingles on Moisture Sensitivity
Newcomb et al. (1993) found that the unconditioned and conditioned moduli of field mixtures were 1758MPa and 848MPa, respectively. Unconditioned and conditioned tensile strengths of field samples were substantially greater than those of laboratory-prepared mixtures, which may have been be due to the differences in neat binder content resulting from differences in field and laboratory mixing procedures, and due to different aggregate sources. Conditioned tensile strength was less than unconditioned strength. The shingle field mixes showed performance trends similar to felt-backed laboratory-prepared samples.

No appreciable difference existed in the retained strengths of the control mixture (no shingles) and the mixtures containing shingles in test section T .H. 25 in Mayer, Minnesota, which indicates that the moisture damage of the shingle mixtures was not more severe than for the conventional mixture (Figure 2.16).

Effect of Shingles on Low Temperature Behaviour
The cold tensile strength of the field mixtures was greater than that of laboratory-prepared mixtures and field strain was roughly 50% to 75% lower than that of laboratory specimens (Newcomb et al., 1993).

Chapter 3 EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM
3.1 Materials Used 3.1.1 Granular Material

Three types of recycled concrete aggregates (RCAI, RCA2 and RCA3), two types of crushed limestone (LS 1 and LS2) and one type of natural granular aggregate (riverbed material) were used in this research. The gradations of the granular aggregates are shown in Figure 3.1. RCA also contained pieces of brick and reclaimed asphalt product (RAP), and was thus a nonhomogeneous material.

Based on California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests, RCAI was the weakest of the recycled aggregates while RCA3 was the strongest. Grain size distributions were also different. RCA2, for instance, contained more sand-sized particles (passing 4.75mm). Percentage passing sieve #4 (4.75mm) of RCAI, RCA2 and RCA3 were 44.65%, 49.07% and 45.23%, respectively. Percentage passing sieve #200 (75Jlm) for RCAI, RCA2 and RCA3 were 7.85%, 5.12% and 3.97%, respectively.

One of the two types of crushed limestone was sourced directly from the quarry (LS 1), while the other was sourced from a pulverized road section (LS2). LS2 contained more fines than LSI because of maintenance and addition of fines to the road. Percentage passing sieve #200 of LS 1 and LS2 were 8.56% and 15.5%, respectively. Percentage passing sieve #4 of LSI and LS2 were 44.6% and 64.3%, respectively. The natural granular material contained 54.3% sand (sieve #4) and 7.75% fines (sieve #200).

42

The effect of adding shingles to the road bases prepared with RCA, crushed limestone or natural gravel was measured using the CBR test and the indirect-tensile-strength test.

Fine Sand

Two types of fine sand were used to determine the effects of shingles in fine sand. One of them (8 1) was sourced from a construction site (excavation for a foundation). One-hundred percent of this material passed the 1.18mm sieve. The second type of sand (82) was obtained by screening granular B (crushed natural gravel from Ontario) through the 2.36mm sieve. Percentage passing sieve #200 of 81 and 82 were 8.29% and 11.61%, respectively. The sieve analysis of fine sand is shown in Figure 3 .2.

Shingles

Two types of shingles were used. Type 1 (referred to as processed shingles) consisted of postconsumer shingles which were processed to remove nails and other undesirable material (Figure 3.3). The second type (ground shingles) was produced by further grinding the processed shingles (Figure 3.3). The processed shingles that passed through the 12.5 mm sieve seemed more stable and stronger than the larger shingle fractions. It was difficult to analyse the effect of the particle size of the processed shingles on the strength of granular materials due to the larger particles easily breaking under applied loads. Hence the processed shingles were screened to remove larger particles. Ground shingles, on the other hand, dispersed more easily within the granular material, making the final product more homogenous.

Equipment and Experimental Details CBR Load Frame

A CBR Load Frame with a loading capacity of 10,000 lb was used to determine the CBR of the granular material as per ASTM D1883-05. The CBR Load Frame, shown in Figure 3.4, was equipped with a movable head and base that traveled at a uniform rate of 1.27mm/min (piston penetration rate). The machine was equipped with a digital load-indicating device which could measure a minimum load of 10 lb. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a measure of the bearing capacity of a given soil, but it may also be used to measure the strength of the granular material in pavement design. The Standard Test Method for the CBR of Laboratory-compacted Soils was followed (ASTM D 1883-05). All CBR test samples were prepared at the optimum moisture content (ASTM Standard Test Method for Laboratory Compaction Characteristics of
45

Soils using Modified Effort (ASTM D 1557-02)). The absorption rate of RCA was higher than that of natural gravel and depended on the duration of soaking. RCA was therefore soaked for 24 hours prior to testing to achieve the desired moisture content.

Figure 3.4: Motorised CRB Load Frame

3.2.2

Constant Head Permeameter

The permeameter (Figure 3.5) consisted of a proctor mould, a collar and rubber sealing inbetween, as well as rubber sealing between top plate and collar and between bottom plate and mould. The bottom plate includes an inlet valve that is connected to a constant-head waterstorage tank. The top plate contains an outlet and air-release valves. The storage tank was an overhead tank with an inlet connected to the water tap and overflow pipes which enabled maintaining a constant head. A spring exerted a force against the top stone to prevent soil density changes during the test (Figure 3.6).

46

The Ontario Ministry of Transportation's (MTO) Method of Test for Determination of Permeability of Granular Soil (MTO LS-709) was followed to determine permeability. The samples were prepared inside the permeameter mould in five layers with 56 blows (each) of a 4.54kg hammer at optimum moisture content by following ASTM D 1557-02. The specimens were placed between two porous stones, which were covered with filter paper to restrict the migration of fines from the samples. The specimens were soaked inside the mould for 24 hours to achieve saturation.

Micro-Deval Abrasion Machine

The Micro-Deval Abrasion Machine consisted of a rolling mill capable of rotating at 100±5 rpm. The mill jar consisted of a 5-litre stainless-steel cylindrical container. The inside and outside surfaces of the jar were smooth. For the test, 5000±5g of steel balls of diameter 9.5±0.5mm were added. The MTO's LS-618, Method of Test for the Resistance of Coarse Aggregate to Degradation by Abrasion in the Micro-Deval Apparatus, was followed.

3.2.4

Indirect Tensile Strength of Stabilized Granular Material

For the determination of the indirect tensile strength, the granular material. was also prepared according to ASTM D 1557-02. To facilitate the sample extraction from the CBR mould the following procedure was followed: 2% cement was added to the granular material. The samples were cured at 100% relative humidity for seven days and then dried at room temperature for 7 days. Following extraction they were left to dry for another 15 days at room temperature in the laboratory.

3.2.5

Determining Maximum Dry Density and Optimum Moisture Content

Two different Standard Test Methods were used to determine Maximum Dry Density (MDD) and Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) for CBR tests and freeze-and-thaw tests.

3.2.5.1 Determining MDD and OMC for CBR
In preparation of the CBR tests, the maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC) of the granular material and fine sand were measured according to ASTM D 1557-02. The samples were prepared inside the mould in five layers with 56 blows (each) of a 4.54kg hammer dropped from 457 mm. The procedure was repeated for several levels of water content to establish a relationship between the dry unit weight and water content. 48

3.2.5.2

Determining MDD and OMC of Fine Sand for Freeze-and-Thaw Test

Sample preparation for freeze-thaw tests was somewhat different. To determine MDD and OMC of fine sand the samples were prepared inside a 10.1cm mould (five layers with 25 blows (each) with a 2.49kg hammer) as per the Standard Test Method for Moisture-Density (Unit Weight) Relations of Soil-Cement Mixtures (ASTM D 558-04). Two percent cement was added to every specimen as well.

3.2.6

Preparation of and Freeze-Thaw Methodology for Fine-Sand Specimens

The specimens were prepared at OMC in moulds with a diameter of 50mm and a height of 179.4mm. For calculating the exact volume of the mould the volumes of the top and bottom compaction plates were also considered. After adding water and 2% cement, the soil-cement mixtures were placed into the moulds and static compaction pressure was applied. After extraction the specimens were cured for 7 days at 100% relative humidity (23°C). After that the specimens were placed onto a 6mm-thick water-saturated pad for 7 days. The freeze-thaw cycles consisted of 24 hours , in a freezer at -23°C, followed by storage in a humidity room (100% relative humidity) for another 23 hours. In total each specimen was exposed to 12 freeze-thaw cycles. The CBR test was conducted as per Standard Test Method for CBR (California Bearing Ratio) of Laboratory-compacted Soils (ASTM D 1883-05). During the freeze and thaw cycles, ice lenses formed inside the specimens thereby reducing their stability. The CBR test is a testing procedure to measure stability based on shear failure of specimen.

Field Measurement of Dust Generation and Road Performance

A trial road was constructed on Miller Road near Brechin as shown in Figure 3.7 (co-ordinates: 44.60397N, 79.10455W) on July 24, 2008. The road was mainly used by heavy gravel trucks. The road consisted of three sections:
1. a control section without shingles (600 m length);

2. a section with 8% processed shingles (300m length); and 3. a section with 8% ground shingles (150m length).

The construction of the control section began with pulverizing the existing gravel road (lOcm thickness). Then water was sprinkled, and the pulverized gravel was mixed by a road grader and compacted with a roller. Density testing was performed with a nuclear gauge.

The construction of the sections with shingles was similar to that of the control section. After the pulverization of the gravel (Figure 3.9), a pre-determined amount of shingles was sprayed from a dump truck as shown in Figure 3.8 and 3.10 and spread uniformly using the road grader (Figure 3.11). Then water was sprinkled (Figure 3.12). The shingles were mixed with the gravel with the help of the pulverizing machine (Figure 3.13). The mixture was further mixed by the grader (Figure 3.14) and then compacted with the roller (Figure 3.15). The percentage of shingles was determined based on the laboratory stability tests for the crushed limestone. After completion of the road it was found that the crushed limestone at the site contained more fines and was less angular than the limestone used in the laboratory. This trial (i.e. the first trial) was therefore not effective, but the experience from this trial was used in preparing for the second trial. The 2nd

50

trial therefore omitted a section with ground shingles. Also, the shingle percentage was increased.

The second trial was conducted on October 6, 2008. The trial consisted of a 200m control section and a 300m section with 12% processed shingles. Twelve percent was found to be the optimum shingle content for the material collected from the job site. The procedure was the same as for the first trial.

After 8 days, dust generation on the road was measured by two air suction tools as shown in Figure 3.16. The setup of the machines (distance from centre of roadway and suction rate (30 cft/minute)) was identical for both sections. The air was filtered through filter paper. The mass of the filter was measured before and after the test. The mass difference was the dust collected.

Equipment Requirements for HMA

The potential use of shingles in HMA was investigated. This study focused on the effects of shingles on optimum binder content and tensile strength.

3.2.9.2 Gyratory Compactor
The specimens were prepared in a gyratory compactor (Brovold Gyratory Compactor (Figure 3.18), Pine Instrument Company), which followed SCSC according to AASHTO PP35. The compactor limited the maximum height of the specimens to 160mm. In a gyratory compactor,

56

two types of compaction efforts are applied to the specimen, i.e. a constant compressive force of 600kPa and a shear (or kneading) force.

3.2.9.5 Sample Preparation for Determining Optimum Binder Content
SuperPave mix design procedures were followed to prepare the specimens (Atkins, 2003). The samples were designed for traffic loads of less than 30 million ESALs (Equivalent Single Axle Load). Initial gyrations (Nin), designed gyrations (Ndes), and maximum gyrations (Nmax) were 8, 109 and 174, respectively. Aggregate, bitumen, dust and the mould were heated to a temperature of 150°C for 4 hours before mixing and compaction. The compaction was performed in the Gyratory Compactor. Bitumen content was chosen for air voids of 4.0±0.5% for all specimens. Only control specimens and specimens with 3% shingles were investigated.

3.2.9.6 Sample Preparation for Tensile Strength Ratio
Aggregate, binder and fines were mixed at 150°C. After mixing the mixture was placed in a pan with an approximate depth of 25 mm, where it was allowed to cool to room temperature for

58

2±0.5 hours. After that the mixture was heated in the oven at 60°C for 16 hours. Then the mixture was heated in the oven for 2 hours at a temperature 150°C. Six specimens each with a diameter of 150mm and thickness of 95mm were made for the control and the shingle mixture. All specimens were cooled at room temperature. Air voids of all specimens were within the required range of 7.0±0.5%. Three specimens each of the control and the shingle mixture were kept inside a watertight plastic bag and were placed in a water bath at 25°C for 2 hours. The remaining control and shingle-mixture specimens were placed in water and 70-80% of the air voids were saturated using a vacuum pump. After that they were wrapped with plastic wrap and placed into plastic bags with 1Og water. The specimens were placed in the freezer for 16 hours, followed by 24 hours and 2 hours in a 60°C and 25°C water baths, respectively. Following these sample preparations the indirect tensile strength tests were conducted. The thickness of the specimens was measured with a Vernier calliper as per ASTM D 3549. The tensile strength ratio was calculated as the ratio of average indirect tensile strengths for the conditioned and dry specimens. The test procedures followed the Standard Method of Test for Resistance of Compacted Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) to Moisture-induced Damage (AASHTO T 283-07).

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The experimental results are organized as follows. Section 4.1 describes the Micro-Deval test results for the coarse aggregate. The laboratory results regarding the shingle modifications of the granular materials and fine sand are then discussed (sections 4.2-4.4). After that the field results of the trial road are reviewed (section 4.5). Finally, section 4.6 presents the results of adding shingles to dense graded Hot Mix Asphalt.

Sections 4.2-4.4 are presented in the following order. First, the effects of shingles on optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) of the granular materials and the fine sand (section 4.2) are shown. These results were used to determine the effects on stability of shingle content and particle size of the granular materials (section 4.2.1 ). Then the effects of curing methods (section 4.3.2) and freeze-and-thaw exposure (section 4.3.3) on shingle-modified granular materials are discussed. Section 4.3.4 investigates the effect of shingle content on indirect tensile strength of granular materials. The effects of shingle content on the stability of fine sand are discussed in section 4.3.5, which is followed by a discussion of the effects of freeze-and-thaw exposure on the stability of shingle-modified fine sand (section 4.3.6). Section 4.4 discusses the effects of shingles on permeability.

Micro-Deval Abrasion Test

Micro-Deval abrasion loss of the RCA1 was highest at 20.3%, whereas that of RCA2 and RCA3 were 17.9% and 18.5%, respectively. These differences were considered marginal. The test results are summarized in Table 4.1.

Effect of Adding Shingles on OMC and MDD

Optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) of the different types of granular materials and fine sand with and without shingles were determined to investigate the effects of shingles on OMC and MDD. The results are summarized in Tables 4.2 and 4.3. For both granular materials and fine sand, MDD declined as the percentage of shingles was increased. For the granular materials this effect was likely attributable to the lower density of the shingles. A correlation between shingle content and OMC was not found, however.

Similarly addition of shingles decreased the MDD of fine sand due to the lower density of shingles. The addition of shingles resulted in a reduction of OMC, which may be due to improved compactability of shingle mixtures.

Effect of Shingles on the Stability of Granular Materials and Fine Sand

The effect of shingles on the stability of the granular materials and the fine sand were determined on the basis of the California Bearing Ratio (CBR), as discussed in chapter 3.

4.3.1

Effect of Shingles Content and Size on Stability of the Granular Materials

At OMC, RCA1 was found to be the weakest and RCA3 the strongest of the 3 recycled aggregates. The CBR values increased for both ground and processed shingle in the case of RCA1 when 5% shingles were added (Figure 4.1). It is noteworthy that strength increased with the addition of up to 5% shingles in the case of low strength RCA. But a negative effect obtained with RCA3 (Figure 4.2). RCA3 itself was a stronger material, indicating that the shingles acted as lubricant under crushing load. RCA2 was stronger than RCA 1 as well, but contained more sand and finer particle than RCA3. CBR values for RCA2 increased slightly due to the addition of 5% ground shingles (Figure 4.2). Further addition of shingles reduced stability.

Figure 4.2: Effect of Adding Ground Shingles to RCA

The results of the CBR tests for the limestone were as follows. The coarse crushed limestone (LSI) (8.5% passing #200, and 44.6% passing #4) became less stable when either processed or ground shingles were added (Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4). The limestone particles had an angular shape with high initial stability; the addition of shingles seemingly had the same lubricating, and hence stability-reducing, effect as with the higher-strength RCA. The other type of limestone (LS2), which was sourced from the site and contained 15.5% fines (passing #200) and 64.3% sand (passing #4), experienced a small increase in stability due to the addition of a relatively large amount of shingles (15%). Visual inspection indicated that LS2 was less angular than LSI. LS2 had a higher initial stability despite containing more fines. The addition of 5% shingles to LS2 led to a minor decline of the CBR. However, the CBR of LS2 increased slightly when more shingles were added. It would appear that the addition of shingles was beneficial for granular materials with higher fines content.

Figure 4.4: Effect of Adding Processed Shingles to Crushed Limestone With respect to the natural gravel, the CBR tests showed that CBR values slightly increased for shingle additions of up to 5% (Figure 4.5). Further shingle additions decreased CBR values. Although the riverbed material contained round and sub angular aggregate, the initial stability of the riverbed material was high, so that the addition did not increase the CBR value significantly.

Although the CBR results showed that some granular materials did not benefit from the addition of shingles, it should be noted that the reduction in CBR for these materials was not large enough to render them unsuitable for road works. In fact the minimum CBR obtained for the 5 tested granular materials at 5% shingles was 80%.

4.3.2 Effect of Curing on Stability of Shingle-Modified Granular Materials
Since road construction in Canada usually takes place during spring and summer, it is imperative to investigate the role of the ambient temperature during construction on the shingle-modified granular materials. RCA2 and RCA3 were selected for this investigation. RCA2 was mixed at the optimum moisture content with ground shingles, placed in plastic bag, and stored at 38°C for 24 hours. After that the mixture was compacted, left in air for 7 days and then tested. The results are shown in Figure 4.6, which shows that the curing regime resulted in higher CBR values. The CBR curve after curing versus shingle content was more or less parallel to that of the materials when tested just after compaction. This indicates that the shingles were not a major source (if at all) of the strength gain. The increase in stability therefore was probably a result of drying and/or any self-cementing properties of the RCA.

65

Figure 4.7 visualizes the effect of curing on shingle-modified RCA3. Three different curing regimes were investigated. The first regime involved compacting the specimens and leaving the compacted samples in air for 3 days. The other regimes involved packing loose mixtures of RCA3 and shingles at optimum moisture content in thick plastic bags. For the second regime the bags were kept in a heat room at 38°C for 4 hours, while regime 3 did not include exposure to heat. The mixtures were compacted and left in air for 3 days. Figure 4.7 shows that both regimes 2 and 3 resulted in similar CBR values, again indicating that the improvement in strength was due to drying and not due to the presence of shingles.

4.3.3 Effect of Freezing and Thawing on the Stability of Shingle-modified Granular Material
The effect of freezing and thawing on shingle-modified limestone (LSI) was investigated by exposing the mixtures to I2 freeze-and-thaw cycles after 96 hours of soaking in water. The stability of the following specimens was tested with and without shingle: (a) LSI and LS 2 at OMC (no freeze-thaw exposure), (b) LSI and LS2 after soaking for 96 hours (no freeze-thaw exposure), and (c) LSI and LS2 after I2 freeze-and-thaw cycles. The specimens were prepared as described in sections 3.2.5 and 3.27. Figure 4.8 shows that for all materials the stability decreased as the shingle content increased. It also shows that soaking did not significantly affect stability. The changes of the CBR values due to the increase of the shingle content were almost identical for the specimens at OMC and the specimens after 96 hours of soaking. The figure also shows that the loss of stability due to freeze-and-thaw exposure was significantly higher for the samples without shingles. Addition of shingles therefore had a positive effect on durability. Figure 4.II and Figure 4.I2 show that there were fewer cracks due to freeze and thaw in the shingle-modified specimens. The surface of shingle-modified limestone exhibited fewer cracks than the limestone without shingles. But addition of processed shingles to LS2, slightly reduced the stability (Figure 4.9) after it had been soaked for 96 hours. After I2 cycles freeze-and-thaw cycles, loss of stability was significant. The reduction of stability showed that addition of larger amounts of shingle can make the material vulnerable to freeze-and-thaw exposure. The CBR of site-collected samples was found to be less for all types of sample preparations investigated, which indicates that the shingle content mixed at the site was perhaps higher than I2%.

In the case of RCA2, the decline of stability, when shingles were added, was approximately the same for all exposure types investigated (Figure 4.I 0). Generally, freeze-and-thaw exposure thus

67

had little effect on the RCA (Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14). Tables 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 report the heave measurements for the samples. Heave height for shingle-modified limestone and RCA was marginally less than heave for specimens without shingles. Heave height and surface disintegration of limestone and RCA was significantly different, because of the differences in the fines content of the granular materials. Limestone (LSI) contained about 8.5% fines and RCA2 five percent.

Effect of Shingles on Indirect Tensile Strength of Granular Material

Indirect-tensile-strength tests were conducted for crushed limestone and RCA2. Two percent cement was added to all samples to facilitate specimen extrusion from the moulds. It should " be noted that this amount of cement was less than what is commonly used to stabilize granular materials (a cement content of 5% is usually used) to reduce the effect of the cement addition on the strength of the material. Two specimens were made with 0% and 8% shingles for both RCA2 and limestone (LS1), i.e. a total of 8 specimens. For both shingle-modified crushed-limestone specimens indirect tensile strength was higher than for the crushed-limestone specimens without shingles (Table 4.7). The crushed-limestone specimens are shown in Figure 4.18 and Figure 4.19. Figure 4.14 shows that the strain energy of shingle-modified limestone was greater than that of limestone without shingle. Hence it can be concluded that shingle-modified limestone has a higher resistance to fatigue cracking.

In the case of RCA2, all samples exhibited very similar strength values (Table 4.8), but visual inspections of Figures 4.16 and 4.17 indicates that RCA2 specimens with 8% shingles were denser and had fewer cracks. These specimens can thus be considered to have performed better than RCA2 specimens without shingles. Due to equipment error measurements of the strain energy of shingle-modified RCA2 are not shown here.

Effect of Shingles on Stability of Fine Sand

Two types of sand (Figure 3.2) extracted from granular B were investigated, i.e. S2 (100% passing 2.36mm sieve and 31% passing 0.3mm sieve) and S 1 (1 00% passing 1.18mm sieve and 97.9% passing 0.3mm sieve). The addition of ground shingles resulted in declining CBR values for both types of sand. Figure 4.20 shows that the CBR values of both LS 1 and LS2 were nearly identical irrespective of shingle content. The decrease of stability was due to the lubricating effect of shingles on sand particles which were found to be angular (visual inspection). Figure 4.20 also shows that the stability of fine sand did not significantly depend on gradation (recall that the gradations of S 1 and S2 were substantially different). The increase of the CBR value as the shingle content was increased from 16% to 20% was unexpected and cannot be explained.

4.3.6 Effect of Freeze-and-Thaw Exposure on Stability of Shingle-modified Fine Sand
Fine sand was prepared from granular B (passing 2.36mm sieve). Two specimens each were made without shiJ?.gles, with 5% shingles and with 10% shingles. To all the specimens 2% cement was added. As the strength of the specimens was very low, comparison of the specimens was made only by visual inspection. After 9 freeze-and-thaw cycles the specimens without shingles started disintegrating. After 12 cycles the specimens without shingles had much more disintegrated than the others. The specimens with 10% shingles were found to be in the best condition: they exhibited no cracks. The specimens with 5% shingles had some cracks but, but fewer than the specimens without shingles (Figure 4.21 to Figure 4.23).

Effect of Shingles on Permeability

The effect of shingles on permeability of granular materials was investigated using RCA2, the two types of crushed limestone and the riverbed material. The permeability was evaluated using the constant head test described in MTO LS-709. The coefficient of permeability of RCA2 was found to slightly decrease with increasing shingle content. The permeability of LS 1 declined significantly with the addition of 5% shingles. Increasing the shingle content to 10% led to only a marginal further decline in permeability (Figure 4.24). However, all the obtained permeability coefficients were within the range recommended by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario for granular materials (1 o-4 to 1o- 8 m/sec ). Thus the addition of shingles to granular materials does not jeopardize drainage requirements of the RCA and LS 1. For crushed limestone LS2, which contained 15.5% fmes (passing #200) and 64% sand (passing #4), hydraulic conductivity was very low but addition of 12% processed shingles improved permeability slightly.

The reduction in the permeability of crushed limestone with 5% shingles was an interesting finding. By examining the gradation of the crushed limestone (LSI) (Figure 3.1 and Table 4.1), it can be seen that this material contained a relatively small amount of sand, especially particles finer than 2.36mm. The high permeability of this limestone was a result of the relatively open gradation of this material. It was thought that the addition of 5% ground shingles, which had a maximum size of 4.75mm (Figure 3.3), would result in a modification of the gradation and make it similar to RCA2. This should reduce the permeability of the limestone to a value within the range obtained for RCA2 (Figure 4.24). To examine this hypothesis, the permeability of crushed limestone mixed with 5% sand (passing 4.75mm sieve) was tested and found to be very close to that of the crushed limestone with 5% shingles (Figure 4.24). Hence the reduction in the permeability of limestone with 5% shingles was a result of increasing the sand-size fraction in

78

the material rather than being due to some specific property of the ground shingles.

For riverbed material permeability decreased with increasing shingle content as shown in Figure 4.25. The limestone brought from site (LS2), which contained 64.33% sand and 15.48% fines, exhibited significantly lower permeability than all other materials tested, but permeability improved with the addition of processed shingles (Figure 4.26). Processed shingles contained only 34.47% sand-sized particles whereas ground shingles consisted almost entirely (99.93%) of sand-sized particles. Similarly, the fractions passing the 0.6mm sieve of processed and ground shingles were 6.61% and 27.3%, respectively. The experimental results show that the effect of adding shingles to granular material depended mainly on the size of shingle particles.

Road Construction and Performance

After the 8-days construction period for the second trial sections, both the control section and the section with 12% shingles were visually inspected and dust generation was measured. The riding surface of the section containing shingles was found to be in better condition compared to the control (Figures 4.27 and Figure 4.28). The shingle section also appeared to be smoother. Figure 4.29 shows that very little dust was generated by trucks in section containing shingles. Dust generated at the two sections was simultaneously collected by the dust suction equipment described in section 3.2.8. Dust was collected for two hours with an air-suction rate of 30 cubic feet per minute. At the control section 40mg of dust was collected, whereas only 20mg was collected at the shingle section.

After six months, on 19 April, 2009, both sections were inspected. Hardly any differences were visible between the two sections (figures 4.30 and 4.31), but the control section had experienced more erosion due to water (figure 4.30 and 4.31). After six months, both sections were in need of maintenance.

Shingles in Dense Graded Hot Mix Asphalt Mix Properties

Table 4.6 shows the specific mix characteristics of the samples tested in terms of MRD, BRD and air voids. Optimum binder content of the control mix and mix with shingles (3%) were 4.55% and3.68% respectively. When 3% shingles were added, the optimum binder content was decreased by 0.87%. The mineral filler contained and asphalt contents of the shingles may have reduced the voids, thereby saving binder content. The values listed in Table 4.9 are the averages of two specimens each.

The tensile-strength ratio of the control mixture and the mixture with shingles were 94.9% and 91.9%, respectively So the tensile-strength ratio of both mixtures were similar but there is an increase in the tensile strength when shingles were used (Figure 4.32).

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The results presented here confirms the feasibility of using tear-off shingles to enhance the performance of granular materials used as road base/subbase or as surface course for unpaved roads. Within the range of materials investigated, the following specific conclusions are drawn:

(1) The effects of shingles on the stability of granular materials depend on material properties, including angularity and fines contents, and the amount of shingles added. In general, shingles were effective in enhancing the stability of granular materials with relatively low CBR (< 80%). Also, the optimum amount of shingles depended on the fines content of the granular material: the higher the fines content, the higher the optimum shingle percentage.

(2) For granular materials with high CBR (above 100%), the addition of shingles was found to have no positive effects, and in some cases negative effects, on the stability as determined by CBR.

(3) Stability of the sand tested in this study decreased with the addition of shingles. Although, the gradations of the two types of sands were significantly different, the effects of shingle addition were similar. This may be attributable to the angular nature of the tested sand, as the shingles reduce the friction between sand particles and hence stability.

(4) The drainage characteristics of the tested granular materials were not significantly affected by the addition of shingles. The drainage effects of shingles in granular material depend on grain size of the shingle particles. It was found that addition of processed shingles was beneficial for granular material with high portions of sand and fines.

85

(5) The indirect tensile strength of granular material containing shingles was greater than that of the control. This indicates that the addition of shingles to crushed limestone was beneficial regarding any distress mode that created tensile stresses, i.e. freezing or repetitive truck loading.

(6) The test results showed that the addition of shingles to granular material or fine sand enhanced freeze-and-thaw durability.

(7) The short-term beneficial effects of adding shingles to gravel roads were obvious. However no noticeable longer-term effects of shingle additions were found.

(8) The use of shingles in HMA mixtures was found to enhance their tensile strength. The tensile strength ratios of the control mix and the mix with shingles were nearly identical, indicating that the addition of shingles reduced moisture-induced damage. The addition of 3% shingles reduced the binder contents by 0.87%, which provides economic advantages.

Both the literature review and the research presented here indicate that our knowledge of shingle use in road bases or in HMA is still incomplete. The following list of suggestions for further research regarding gravel roads aims at improving this body of knowledge.

1. The road selected for this research was very busy with most of the traffic consisting of heavy trucks. This may be a major reason why the benefits of adding shingles were perhaps overwhelmed by the excessive traffic. It would be useful to conduct field trials with roads of different traffic loads.

2. An alternative mix procedure may prove beneficial. Gravel mixed with shingles should be compacted on the road surface. Then a mixture of emulsion and water should be applied over the

86

shingle mixture. As the shingles are already coated with asphalt, less emulsion would probably be required than with the mix procedure used here.

3. A base course of adequate strength should be made. Then a thin layer of shingles should be spread on the gravel surface and compacted. This approach may reduce dust generation thereby reducing maintenance of road.

4. Hydrocarbon distillates, such as asphalt, bitumen and tar, may be used to rejuvenate the asphalt contained in the shredded roofing shingle (similar to Pavelak and Michael (1996)). This would help with the extraction of the binder from the shingles.

5. Supplementary cementing materials, e.g., high-calcium fly ash, may be used to increase the stability of shingle mixes.
