Abstract

Investigating the Sub-acute Responses of Lemna minor, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Euglena gracilis and Anodonta grandis to Tributyltin-hydride and Atrazine in Freshwater
Christopher John Edward Pearce Masters of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and Management September 2009 Ryerson University

Freshwater resources exist in limited quantities and are subject to increasing demands due to the consumption by residential, commercial, and industrial uses. There are concerns that the widely used chemical analysis of drinking water does not deliver timely results. This study examines the efficacy of developing a holistic, multi-organism early-warning biomonitoring technology to assess aquatic toxicity. Sensitive indicator species such as
Lemna minor, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Euglena gracilis, and Anodonta grandis

have been selected due to their specific behavioural and short-term biochemical responses in the identification of classes of contaminants in aquatic environments. Tributyltin, an antifouling agent in paints used on boats and atrazine, an herbicide widely used on agricultural crops, are evaluated in increasing concentrations to identify behavioural changes in these organisms. These graded responses, upon implementation in models, will warn water treatment operators of incoming contaminants and help identify the nature of the stressor. All organisms displayed some sensitivity to selected concentrations of the two test chemicals. The normal growth rate of L. minor dramatically declined with exposure to TBT (1 00.0 Jlg/L) and atrazine (500.0 Jlg/L). Monitoring the biochemical changes, dissolved oxygen production, and also the growth rate, cell counts, of P. subcapitata showed significant effects to similar concentrations of TBT (1 00.0 Jlg/L) and atrazine (500.0 Jlg/L). The aquatic protist, E. gracilis, alters its cell morphology in the presence of low concentrations of TBT (1 0.0 Jlg/L) and atrazine (50.0 Jlg/L). Respiration patters of the bivalve, A. grandis, was directly influenced by the two chemicals, TBT (1.0 Jlg!L) and atrazine (50.0 Jlg/L). This study demonstrates that biological assessments of water samples deliver a rapid, realistic representation of the surrounding aquatic environment conditions.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
Global freshwater supplies are either surface or ground waters that are found in the natural environment and exist in limited quantities (Sabik et a/., 2000; Anderson, 2003). Protection of this natural resource is of great concern due to uneven global distribution and most importantly the possibility of contamination from point and nonpoint sources (Dorigo et a/., 2004 ). In developed countries, industrial sources result in increased water consumption and an increased production of wastes. The improper disposal and treatment of these wastes can result in contaminated drinking water sources and ultimately pose human health risks (Metcalfe et a/., 2003). Another problematic scenario, initiated by the Western world, is the unnecessary large consumption of clean freshwater. Attempts to enforce water conservation practices, through innovative technologies and awareness, have been ongoing to reduce the excessive use of this resource (Anderson, 2003; Sala, and Serra, 2004). Water usage originates from a variety of sources such as industrial and
commer~ial

practices, domestic uses, public facilities

and general leakage (Gleick, 2000). Identifying and creating awareness of this demand draws awareness in government agencies, policy makers and stakeholders to ensure safe drinking supplies in their jurisdictions (Gleick, 2000). Limited water treatment technologies in developing countries introduce further concern for contaminated waters (Loucks, 2000). Unsafe drinking water in developing countries affects a large population and results in poor health conditions in the average individual living in these geographic locations. Development of a cost-effective technology to rapidly identify and treat contaminants in drinking water sources is an ideal answer to reduce health risks, ensuring potability, and would dramatically improve quality of life in both developed and developing countries. Such technologies include but are not limited to ion exchange, reverse osmosis, granular activated carbon and air stripping (Goodrich and Lykins 1991).

Chemical analyses are the most common methods used to identify components found in water samples (Ministry of the Environment, Ontario, 2008a). In Ontario, required chemical test methods are outlined in the "Protocol of Accepted Drinking-Water Testing Methods" (Ministry of the Environment, Ontario, 2008a). Also, stated in this document, there are other chemical standard methods set out by other agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), American Waterworks Association (A WWA), ASTM International (formally the American Society for Testing and Materials), and AOAC International (formally the Association of Official Analytical Chemists) (Ministry of the Environment, Ontario, 2008a). This practice has been shown to be very effective; however, a limiting factor is the extensive time required to deliver results. When a water sample is extracted from a source, it will undergo multiple chemical tests to determine if a contaminant is present or absent. If a particular contaminant is present, further investigation is conducted to determine if the concentration exceeds the regulatory standards set out by officials. Another limitation of this process is that it does not account for all contaminants. Only a selection of known toxicants have been identified and treated in the chemical approach which are outlined in Drinking Water Act, 2002 (Ministry of the Environment Drinking Water Ontario, 2008b). A number of contaminants are not accounted for, such as certain metals, pesticides, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (P AHs ), halogenated organic compounds,

pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs ), endocrine disruptors (EDCs) and also xenobiotics (Snyder et al. , 2003; McCarthy et al. , 2007). Another area of potential concern is contamination of drinking water sources with biosolids via runoff from agricultural lands. Biosolids are processed nutrient rich byproducts derived from domestic and commercial sewage (Topp et al. , 2008). This treated sludge is produced at wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and have been deemed safe for application on agricultural crops as an alternative natural nutrient rich fertilizer (Topp et al. , 2008). The treatment process of this resource removes regulated components but poses major concerns due to the release of unregulated concentrations of PPCPs and other chemicals into the aquatic environments via runoff (Topp et al. , 2008). The application of sludge can be either surface or injected into the soil. The surface application is susceptible to

2

increased runoff rates while the injection reduces these rates dramatically (Topp et al. , . 2008). In contrast to the well-known chemical tests is a biological approach that can deliver comparable results. The use of biological monitoring of living organisms through monitoring of behavioural characteristics has been applied in the past (Giesy and Allred, 1985). A historical example of biological warning systems is the monitoring of a

canary' s behaviour during extraction of raw material in deep caves. This sensitive indicator species would deliver an early-warning signal to miners indicating unsafe air quality in the enclosed mines. The use of bioassays has shown to be a reliable tool to rapidly identify contaminants present in the surrounding environment (Giesy and Hoke, 1989). The use of an early-warning biomonitoring is not a new concept and a number of technologies have been developed in Europe (Tahedl and Hader, 1998, Gerhardt et al. , 2002, and Streb et al. , 2002). Germany is a leader in developing these systems to identify unsafe aquatic environments for a number of years. Early-warning biomonitoring systems have not been heavily studied in North America, where water resources are significantly high. Traditional chemical testing may not deliver sufficient timely analysis to indicate safe water conditions. Biological assessments deliver the advantage of identifying hazardous concentrations of chemicals at the sub-acute level, less than 24 hours, by expressing rapid behavioural responses. This allows for the identification and treatment of water-borne toxic substances before end users would be exposed.

In this study, a selection of suitable organisms which delivered the best responses · to environmentally-relative concentrations of contaminants found in freshwater sources was investigated. Laboratory tests involved dose-dependent experiments with two chemical contaminants, tributyltin-hydride (TBT) and atrazine. Changes in behaviours such as cell shape and normal movement and other endpoints such as changes in dissolved oxygen and cell growth were monitored to compare with normal parameters for allocated time periods. This research will lead to the development of a free-flow in situ model that will utilize multiple indicator organisms to automatically detect unfavourable aquatic conditions through automated monitoring of organisms' behaviours. If the system

3

detects contaminated samples and identifies the culprit class of contaminants, an engineering solution will be set in place to identify and extract harmful contaminants from the water source.

The objectives of this thesis are as follows:

·

to select a battery of sensitive indicator organisms and design experimental procedures to monitor sub-acute responses to chemical stressors

·

to determine the most useful battery of organisms and their endpoints to further develop an early-warning biomonitoring system.

The overall objective for the project is:

·

to complement current chemical analysis with a holistic biological approach by incorporating the rapid responses of these sensitive indicator organisms to aquatic contaminants into a water-quality model.

All thesis objectives stated above were met and are presented in the following document. This research will aid in the overall project objective of developing a multi-organism aquatic early-warning biomonitoring system.

CHAPTER2 LITERATURE BACKGROUND
2.1 Ontario Drinking Water Standards
Drinking-water standards in Canada are set out by the individual provincial governments. Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standards (0. Reg 169/03) outlines the allowable limits of 158 chemical/physical, microbial and radiological parameters (Appendix A). These standards were developed from the Safe Drinking Water Act of 2002. The main reason for 0. Reg. 169/03 is to standardize the allowable levels of substances which have been proven to pose health risks to end-users. Safe drinking water for human consumption must have little or none of the following disease-causing organisms, toxic chemicals, or radioactive materials. Other characteristics of drinkingwater such as odour, taste, turbidity and colour are controlled to make it more pleasant to consume. The Ontario standards regulate the allowable concentrations of atrazine but do not have set standards for tribytyltin (TBT) limits used in this study. In the guidelines, atrazine had allowable concentration of 5.0
~g/L

(Safe Drinking Water Act, 2002). It is

difficult to detect and regulate unwanted substances found in water sources but it is important to take a proactive approach in reducing contamination rather than taking action following a disaster. Many incidents concerning water contamination have taken place even in developed countries. One example is in Walkerton, Ontario, in 2000, where the drinking water became contaminated with Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni and thousands became ill and seven people died (Prudham, 2004; Richards, 2005). Current increases of waste production facilitate the importance of water treatment and regulation of all potential contaminants present in drinking water sources.

2.2 Indicator Species
Giesy and Allred (1985) have conducted bioassays using a battery of organisms to determine environmental toxicity conditions. Their research using multispecies showed to
5

be an ideal approach to identify unfit environmental conditions. By monitoring the parameters of more than one species allows the observer to identify toxic impacts of a more representative population found in the environment (Giesy and Allred, 1985). The main goal of using a multispecies model is to determine the effects at the ecosystem-level which is more representative of the natural environment (Giesy and Allred, 1985). Isolating individual indicator species does not incorporate trophic interactions amongst organisms which occur regularly with overlapping populations.

Two primary producers, a protist, and an animal species were included in the biological-based approach of this project for a number of reasons. Firstly, they all play a key role in aquatic environments, especially with regards to their involvement in nutrient cycling. They have proven to be ideal indicator species displaying short-term response characteristics in the presence of contaminants. The organisms selected were emergent macrophyte Lemna minor, the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the singlecelled protist Euglena gracilis, and the freshwater bivalve Anodonta grandis. Each organism underwent toxicity experiments in the laboratory to monitor their sensitivity to the selected chemicals of concern, TBT and atrazine. Further experimentation using other chemical toxicants should be conducted and selected from a list of known compounds tested in drinking water by the Ontario government based on their ability to persist in the environment (Appendix A). These toxicity experiments are necessary to determine the organisms' sensitivity to a particular chemical and determine if they show stress responses within acceptable limit.

2.2.1 Lemna minor

Lemna minor, commonly called "duckweed", is from the family Lemnaceae
(Wang, 1990). It is a free-floating surface macrophyte found in many freshwater environments. L. minor has a doubling time of approximately 1.4 days and has been recommended as a standard test species in freshwater environmental studies (Wang, 1990). It is composed of two segments, 2-3 fronds, which are approximately 2 mm in length, and a single root, ranging 5-20 mm, (Figure 2.1) which is submerged in the water

6

column (Wang, 1990). L. minor is capable of living in a pH distribution of 5-9 and optimally lives in waters with pH of 6.5-7.5 (Wang, 1990). These vascular angiosperms can be _found in temperatures ranging from 6 to 33°C (Wang, 1990). Reproductive behaviour is vegetative, minimizing genetic variability and producing identical offspring (Hillman, 1961; Moody and Miller, 2005). L. minor's life cycle involves rapidly-dividing colonies and if temperatures fall below 6-7°C, parent plants will produce a starch-filled capsule, termed a turion, for winter survival (Wang, 1990). These capsules will sink to the sediments and when the temperatures become favourable, they will open and return to the surface. L. minor is considered an important nutrient source of protein and fat for some birds and fish species (Hillman, 1961 ).

Moody and Miller (2005) identify that Lemna species have been used in toxicity experiments since the early 1930s and has led to the development of current environmental guidelines and legislation. Many governmental authorities have adopted plant toxicity tests for environmental assessments and monitoring (Wang and Freemark, 1995). Tests using duckweed as an indicator species have been recommended under The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (1982) and The Toxic Substance Control Act (1985) in the United States (Wang and Freemark, 1995). Also, duckweed is a recommended test organism in Canada for pulp and paper effluent regulations (1992) under The Fisheries Act (1941) (Wang and Freemark, 1995). The Organization for

Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has set out "The Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals: Lemna sp. Growth Inhibition Test", which is a seven day growth test protocol assessing the number of fronds and also monitoring plant biomass (total frond area, dry weight or fresh weight) (OECD, 2002a). These tests compare samples with a control to determine effective concentration of 50% inhibition (EC 5o), lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) and no observable effect concentration (NOEC) (OECD, 2002a). Environment Canada has also published a set of standard test methods, "Biological Test Methods: Test for Measuring the Inhibition of Growth Using the Freshwater Macrophyte, Lemna minor" (Environment Canada, 2007a). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEP A) also has their own modifications for

duckweed standard testing and is outlined in the "Ecological Effects Test Guidelines: Aquatic Plant Toxicity Test Using Lemna spp., Tiers I and II" (USEPA, 1996a). Standard tests from the above-mentioned agencies have slight modifications, such as different growth medium but in general the tests are quite similar. The duration of the experiments are all seven-day tests and the measured endpoints are all standard.

L. minor has been used in the laboratory as an environmental toxicity biological

indicator due to its ease in culturing, low-cost maintenance, small size, rapid growth rate, and its multiple endpoints to determine the effects of aquatic contaminants (Hillman, 1961; Wang, 1990; Moody and Miller 2005). It has been used to detect heavy metal toxicity, organic compounds such as pentachlorophenol and also herbicide pollution (Wang, 1990). Previous experiments which have used Lemna include growth inhibition tests which include frond counts, measuring dry-weight biomass and root length measurements (Fenske et al., 2006; Moody and Miller 2005). Previous toxicity experiments indicated that frond counts over time delivers the most accurate results in comparison to alternative tests (Hillman, 1961; Bishop and Perry, 1981 ). Dry-weight measurements mainly represent starch content and therefore produce inaccurate results with respect to growth rates (Hillman, 1961 ). Past experiments do not identify sub-acute stress responses and therefore this research looked at how selected chemicals affected L.

minor's growth on a sub-acute level. Another rapid endpoint which could be identified is
monitoring the consumption of carbon dioxide and oxygen evolution. Chemical contaminants can have an effect on the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis impeding the normal growth of this plant species. Frond development was used in this study due to the short-term nature of the responses.

2.2.2 Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata

Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (formally Selenastrum capricornutum ), is nonmotile, unicellular, crescent-shaped green algae (Figure 2.2) that can be found in many freshwater environments (Fairchild eta/., 1997). It is an important primary producer and therefore is actively involved in the cycling of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems. This

9

diploid organism grows quickly with a doubling time of 18-20 h which makes it an ideal indicator species for monitoring sub-acute parameters (Fairchild et al. , 1997). It has been heavily used in toxicity experiments due to its ease of culturing in the lab, its sensitivity to contaminants and low cost experiments (Katsumata et al. , 2006). Due to its importance as a primary producer, this organism is essential to the success of the ecosystem in which it lives. In this study, we used the fast doubling time as a response to stressors by measuring biomass via cell counts to identify unsuitable conditions through monitoring changes in the organism' s normal growth rate.

Tests with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata have been in use since the 1970s for assessing aquatic eutrophication which led to the development of standardized tests used today (Fairchild et al. , 1997). Algae toxicity test have been used globally and many standard test protocols have been developed by agencies to maintain uniformity when tests are conducted. The OECD has developed a document, "OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals: Freshwater Algae, Cyanobacteria, Growth Inhibition Test" which is a 72-h test monitoring the exponential growth of algae (OECD, 2002b). Environment Canada has also developed their version of standard methods for toxicity tests using algae, "Biological Test Methods: Growth Inhibition Tests Using a Freshwater Alga" (Environment Canada, 2007b ). The USEP A produced their own document with standard toxicity tests which are outlined in "Ecological Effects Test Guidelines: Algal Toxicity, Tiers I and II" (USEPA, 1996b). All three agencies follow similar methods with minor alterations. All three methods investigate growth inhibition experiments and also the test period is either 72-h or 96-h.

Kaneko et al. (2004) used phosphorus uptake by green algae as a short-term toxicity parameter. Phosphate is a limiting resource in freshwater environments and is an essential macronutrient used by plant species for growth and development. In toxin-free waters green algae will take up a constant amount of available phosphorus for normal development and this process can be measured using phosphate chemical analysis (Kaneko et al. , 2004). Introducing different concentrations of a contaminant will have a direct effect on the phosphorus uptake by the plant. Increasing concentrations of zinc

11

nitrate shows an increase in inhibition of phosphorus uptake by P. subcapitata (Kaneko

et al. , 2004). The test period for this experiment was approximately 3-h but was indicated
by the authors that this time frame could be significantly reduced by altering the cell inoculation period (Kaneko et al. , 2004). Another method to monitor phosphorus concentrations rapidly would be to incorporate a phosphorus probe to monitor fluctuations in real time.

Besides changes in biomass, the following biochemical changes can be used for monitoring rapid changes under stressed conditions. Delayed Fluorescence (DF) is a parameter which is used to determine photosynthetic output (Katsumata et al. , 2006). Many contaminants in the environment can affect the light reaction of photosynthesis and in particular the electron transport chain between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) (Katsumata et al. , 2006). These two photo systems are reaction centers, made up proteins located in the chloroplasts, which absorb light energy to produce oxygen as a byproduct (Allen, 2003). Photosystem II occurs first and is the driving mechanism for the transfer of electrons along the electron transport chain while PSI provides energy used by the plant for growth and other functions (Wraight and Crofts, 1971). When light is absorbed on the antennal complex (reaction center) of PSII, electrons are transferred to a primary acceptor at the beginning of the electron transport chain (Allen, 2003). This reaction promotes energy flow towards the Calvin cycle facilitating the plant with energy and sugars for growth (Allen, 2003). DF occurs when a plant is suddenly placed in dark conditions and electrons will return to PSII to re-excite the reaction center, where fluorescence occurs for a set period and then decays over time (Strehler and Arnold, 1951 ). DF can be used to detect growth inhibition in green algae. For example, if P.

subcapitata is exposed to certain concentrations of a contaminant, DF timings will be
altered when compared to normal conditions. Katsumata et al. (2006) showed that DF results from a 15-minute exposure to contaminants such as simazine and 3,5dichlorophenol, had similar results when compared to a 72-h growth inhibition test. While delayed fluorescence and phosphorus-uptake were not responses used in the current study, it is recommended that their future inclusion in biomonitoring systems be

12

considered. Growth inhibition and changes in DO were investigated due to their primary connection to the photosynthetic output of this primary producer.
2.2.3 Euglena gracilis

Euglena gracilis (~ 15 ~m) is a single-celled protist, containing a flagellum (Figure

2.3) for motility (Gajdosova and Reichrtova, 1996). This species has unique plant and animal characteristics which provides many physiological endpoints such as phototaxis (orient due to light) and gravitaxis (orient due to gravity) (Ohta eta/. , 1999; Streb eta/. , 2002). Its flagellum facilitates motility for the organism within the water column and efficiently captures nutrients. The chloroplasts allow the protist to perform photosynthetic reactions. Historically, Euglena species have been studied for their phototaxis capabilities. In the mid-1970s, Checcucci et a/. (1976) mentioned the early work of Jennings (1906) who looked at the photoorientation mechanism of Euglena. Checcucce et a/. (1976) investigated the ability for three different species of Euglena to orient towards light and concludes that the eyespot facilitates manoeuvrability. ECOTOX, developed by Tahedl and Hader (1998), is an early-warning biomonitoring system which can observe, analyse and produce accurate results from the behavioural changes of microscopic organisms. ECOTOX uses real-time image analysis to monitor the behaviours of E. gracilis using video cameras to determine stress levels compared to the organism's normal behaviour (Streb et a/. , 2002). Gajdosova and Reichrtova (1996) conducted growth inhibition tests with E. gracilis exposing this organism to four different metals (Hg, Cd, Cr and Ni).
Euglena show to be sensitive to concentrations of mercury (Hg) as low as 0.001
~mol/L

and also an 84% decrease in cell growth with exposure to 0.04

~mol/L

of Hg (Gajdosova

and Reichrtova 1996). Its ability to photosynthesize could also be monitored as a shortterm endpoint, observing changes in dissolved oxygen, similar to that of

Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (Ohta et a/. , 1999). Additionally, under stressed

conditions, this particular organism changes its shape from its normal elongated spindle conformation to a constricted cyst form and also loses its flagellum (Lonergan and

Williamson, 1988; Ohta et a!. , 1999). Euglena has been shown to be sensitive to certain concentrations of tributyltin-chloride (TBT -Cl) which reduces it motility (Ohta et a!. , 1999). Microtubules found in the cytoskeleton of the organism either polymerise · increasing the body asymmetry (elongated) or depolymerise resulting in the cyst shape (Lachney and Lonergan, 1985).
2.2.4 Anodonta grandis

Anodonta grandis (Figure 2.4), common name "giant floater", is a freshwater bi-

valve filter feeder native to North America and is an important animal in the food web (Mackie, 1991 ). This organism is an herbivore filtering and consuming suspended particulate matter found in the surrounding waters (Mackie, 1991). It is a member of the benthic community which remains on, or slightly burrowed in, the sediments of both slow-moving lentic (lakes or ponds) and faster moving lotic (streams or rivers) fresh waters (Mackie, 1991 ). Primary predators include turtles, birds, some fish species and also terrestrial mammals such as raccoons. Its shell length, from posterior to anterior end, can be up to 15cm (Byrne and McMahon, 1991 ). Reproductive processes include the release of sperm from the male into the water column which enters the siphon of the female to fertilize eggs in a brood pouch located on the gills of the female mussel (Texas Parks and Wildlife, 2008). Once the offspring develop into their larval stage, called glochidia, they are released into the water column and will attach to the gills of a fish host until they develop into juveniles (Texas Parks and Wildlife, 2008). After this stage, they will release from the fish host and fall to the sediments where they will grow to become adults. The average life span for this species is approximately 4-1 0 years (Texas Parks and Wildlife, 2008).
A. grandis filters large volumes of water and therefore bioaccumulates

hydrophobic pollutants found in the water column sorbed to suspended particulates (Gunkel and Streit, 1980). Mussel species are an ideal indicator organism due to their quick behavioural and physiological changes in the presence of a contaminant. Behavioural parameters which can be monitored are the opening and closing movements

of the valves. Physiologically, the respiration rate of this organism is altered in response to toxic substances. Mussels have been widely used in long-term toxicity experiments. As they filter and accumulate many chemicals in their visceral mass over their lifespan, sacrificial tests can be conducted to analyse for detrimental levels of chemicals accumulated in the body (Slooff et al., 1983). A. grandis has not been heavily used in toxicity experiments for a number of reasons. Firstly, North American toxicity tests using bivalves are not very common. Secondly, there has been a dramatic dynamic change in the mollusca species found in freshwater bodies in the United States and Canada due to many European invasive species such as the common zebra mussel (Johnson et al. , 2001 ). Most of the research conducted in Europe has focused on native species to their specific countries (Borcherding, 2006). A. grandis was selected due to its existence as a native species in North American fresh waters and has environmental relevance to toxicity studies in this geographic location.

The "Dreissena-Monitor" is a biological early-warning technology developed in Germany which monitors and automates changes in valve movements of zebra mussels

, (Dreissena polymorpha). It is considered to be an ideal early-warning system based on
the following criteria: it can operate reliably unattended for a week, it is easy to use and handle, maintenance requirements are approximately 3 hours per week and it contains an automatic alarm system which warns of abnormal behaviours in less than 30 minutes (Borcherding, 2006). The parameters of this system are based on valve movement behaviours and also percentage of open mussels (Borcherding and Volpers, 1994). Zebra mussels are fixated on a flat solid surface and are suspended in a flow-through system in which valve behaviours are detected by a magnet-displacing switch attached to the exterior surface of the shell (Borcherding, 2006). The switch records valve movements under normal conditions and compares these behaviours to stress related conditions with exposure to test chemicals (Borcherding, 2006). Multiple endpoints have already been established by Borcherding (2006) in his ten-year experience with this particular model as an early-warning technology. Computer software has been developed for this model which analyzes the behavioural movements and produces graphical results (Borcherding, 2006). The Dreissena-monitor is a reliable early-warning system as it is currently being

17

used by thirteen control stations across Germany and is also recommended for use at measuring stations for the "German Commission for the Protection of the Rhine Against Pollution" (Borcherding, 2006). In this study, closure of the valves was the measured endpoint, along with respiration responses.

2.3 Test Chemicals: Tributyltin-hydride and Atrazine
In order to cause biological responses in our test organisms, two test chemicals were selected based on their hazardous effects and also their ongoing use and persistence in the environment. Tributyltin-hydride (TBT) and atrazine (Table 2.1) are both characterized as pesticides and are currently being used for the control of pests (Chevre et

a/. , 2006; Luan, 2006; Nikolaou et a/. , 2007). Experimental concentrations for test
chemicals were selected based on their existence in aquatic environments and also with respect to the level of regulation set out by two different government agencies, the USEPA and Health Canada and are outlined below.

2.3.1 Tributyltin-hydride (TBT)
Tributyltin-hydride is a tri-alkyl organotin compound which can be found in Canadian freshwaters and can have half-life of 1-2 weeks in aquatic environments (van Slooten and Tarradellas, 1994). The primary mode of degradation is through microbial 18

action and therefore breakdown to its ineffective form may vary with the biota living in the water column. Its presence in Ontario surface waters from international shipping is of concern and requires investigation at environmentally-relevant concentrations. It has been used heavily since the 1970s and has a multitude of uses such as in: insecticides, pesticides for wood preservation, antifouling agents in paints coating the hulls of large ships and an antifungal agent in textile and industrial water systems (Clark et al., 1988; Dubey and Roy, 2002; Antizar-Ladislao, 2008; Kontrikla, 2009). TBT has been mainly introduced through anthropogenic sources and has been identified as a compound which is harmful to marine and freshwater organisms (Nikolaou eta!., 2007). Breakdown of its alkyl groups through degradation either by biotic or abiotic pathways results in the reduction of its toxicity (Dubey and Roy, 2002). It has been proven to act as an endocrine disruptor mainly affecting reproductive systems and also tends to bioaccumulate within particular organisms (Nikolaou et al. 2007). TBT accumulation in gastropods has been shown to act as an endocrine disruptor, resulting in overproduction of testosterone in females, causing imposex characteristics (Antizar-Ladislao, 2008). Imposex causes female gastropods to develop male sex characteristic while retaining female reproductive organs and therefore decrease their overall reproductive fitness and a decline in their population (Antizar-Ladislao, 2008). Environmental impacts of TBT causing imposex was noted in France between 1975 - 1982 where a drastic decline of oyster harvesting occurred and ultimately resulted in a large economic loss (Chiavarini et a/., 2003). Even though other endocrine disruptors exist in aquatic environments, Chiavarini eta/. (2003) studies show there is a very high correlation between TBT concentrations and induced imposex characteristics in gastropods. Due to its bioaccumulation properties, this chemical also biomagnifies up the food chain. Yang et a!., 2001 have noted that freshwater organisms such as mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 900,000 and 320,000 for some algae species. Bioconcentration factor is a ratio used in contaminated waters to compare chemical concentrations found within the tissues of an aquatic organism in relation to the surrounding environment (Yang et al., 2001).

19

Bans on organotin additives in antifouling paints have been implemented in many countries primarily on small watercraft since the mid-1980s. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has called for an international treaty to ban all TBT -containing paints by the beginning of 2008 (Antizar-Ladislao, 2008). Ontario began regulating the use of TBT in antifouling paints in 1989 with a complete ban on watercrafts greater than 25-m in length excluding vessels with aluminum hulls. However, 14 ng Sn/L is still reported in peak months in surface waters (Yang and Maguire, 2000, Yang et al., 2001). Even though these bans exist, TBT has been used for over 40 years and developing countries will continue using these effective and low-cost pesticides (Luan, 2006; Nikolaou et al. , 2007). Identifying the toxin in the environment is essential but removal through degradation should be also considered (Luan, 2006). TBT has low water solubility (less than 10 mg/L; water solubility df salt is 357 g/L) and therefore requires a dissolving agent such as ethanol, methanol, acetone or dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) which can be found mixed in freshwaters (Fent, 1996). 0.5% v/v DMSO was selected as a carrier for all TBT experiments due to its negligent effects on the organism' s normal behaviour. Some of the above-mentioned carriers might propose detrimental behavioural effects. It is essential to add low concentrations of DMSO to provide a well-mixed homogenous system for chemicals such as TBT.
2.3.2 Atrazine

Atrazine is a tri-azine herbicide and is one of the most commonly used pesticides for weed control on agricultural crops in North America (Solomon et al. , 1996; Chevre et

al. , 2006). Its main use is for com crop protection against broad leaf and grass weeds
(Solomon et al. , 1996). Over 66-million pounds of atrazine was applied on com crops alone in the US in 2002 which is an 8-million pound increase since 1992 and makes up the majority of the 76-million pound total in 2002 (US Geological Survey, 1992; 2002). In 1994, this organic compound was often found in freshwaters close to farmlands due to runoff under heavy precipitation conditions (Chevre et al. , 2006). The entire European Union (EU) set a ban on the application of atrazine in 2004 due to the potential contamination of groundwater (Ackerman, 2007). In some parts of Europe such as Switzerland, pesticide application has been banned for over 19 years (Acero, 2000).

20

This herbicide blocks the electron transport chain between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) therefore having an effect on the photosynthetic ability of targeted plants (Caux eta/. , 1996; Fairchild eta/. , 1998). This chemical is used to control unwanted weeds which only increase crop yields by 6% at most (Ackerman, 2007). Even moderate use of this pesticide facilitates transport into aquatic environments, thereby possibly effecting non-target biota. It has also been considered to be an endocrine disruptor in animals (Brodkin et a/. , 2007). Its solubility in water is 33 mg!L at 22°C and has a half life of 13-261 days in soil and 8-14 days in water (Dugay et a/. , 1998). When atrazine is sprayed on crops it is mixed with a vehicle carrier prior to application. Therefore, this low solubility is negligent with regards to the bioavailability of pure atrazine present in fresh waters as the carrier increases this solubility. The varying half life also makes it difficult to determine its persistence in the environment. The half life of a chemical is determined when it is broken down to half its initial value and therefore becomes less harmful in its reduced state to non-target organisms.

Environmentally-relevant concentrations of atrazine in the Great Lakes fluctuate around 0.12 J..Lg/L and rarely exceed 20.0 J..Lg/L (Ministry of the Environment Drinking Water Ontario, 2008b; Solomon eta!. , 1996). Non-target organisms could be exposed to concentrations exceeding 20.0 J..Lg/L in the event of storm runoff but this exposure is very transient (Solomon et a!. , 1996). The maximum concentration levels (MCLs) in the United States are 3 J.Lg/L (Acero, 2000, US EPA, 2003b ). These levels are slightly higher in Canada, where limiting concentrations of atrazine are 5 J..Lg/L (Health Canada, 1993). 0.5% v/v DMSO was also used as a carrier for atrazine to ensure a perfectly mixed solution. Strong eta!., (2000) have developed a method to treat atrazine contaminated soils using recombinant Escherichia coli which express atrazine-chlorohydrolase which breaks down the hazardous herbicide.
2.4 Early-Warning Biomonitoring Background

A biological approach to determine aquatic toxicity provides an effective and accurate representation in comparison to chemical analysis. It requires the integration of

21

multiple living organisms and the monitoring of their behaviours. Human observations deliver subjective results and therefore the reliance on automatic image analysis and computer software should be used to monitor the behaviours of selected organisms. Construction of a flow-through system is ideal and would require some engineering to design a system to monitor the unique behaviours of individual species Identifying toxicity in freshwater is an important focus in reducing health risks. With recent concern on bio-terrorism contaminating drinking water sources, it drives the development of a rapid early-warning biomonitoring system to discover lethal contaminants rapidly and to reduce such threats. Chemical tests are expensive, timeconsuming and do not identify all toxicants present. A biological approach via monitoring the behaviour of multiple organisms would deliver rapid results using sub-acute endpoints (under 24-h) to determine contaminated aquatic systems. Once an alarm is sounded, due to a significant change in one or multiple organisms' behaviour, a water sample would then be tested chemically to determine the specific responsible for the changed behaviour. Outlined below are possible systems delivering short-term responses which could be used in the development of the multispecies early-warning biomonitoring system being developed in this work.

2.4.1 ECOTOX
ECOTOX is an early-warning biomonitoring technology that was developed in Erlangen, Germany, to signal short-term alterations of Euglena gracilis' behaviour using an easy-to-use real-time image analysis (Hader, 2007). Tahedl and Hader (1998) have determined specific endpoints for E. gracilis such as motility and orientation with this system. The parameters monitored in this system include alignment, upward movement and compactness of this organism prior to and following chemical exposure (Hader, 2007). If a certain parameter threshold is exceeded, an alarm is sounded to notify the operator of unfit biological conditions. Experiments conducted by Tahedl and Hader with the ECOTOX system delivered ECso values which were compared to EC 50 values using a bioluminescence inhibition assays with Vibiro fischeri. This system is fully automatic once all components are set up for use. Complete analysis of one sample can be

22

conducted in less than 10 minutes and therefore it is a representative tool for a earlywarning biomonitoring system (Tahedl, and Hader, 2001 ).

2.4.2 Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor (MFB)

Another ecotoxicological system used for rapid testing of multiple organisms' behaviours is the Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor (MFB) (Gerhardt et al. , 2002). The MFB system has employed a number of animals suspended in the water column and also ones found in sediments such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Daphnia magna, tadpoles and fish (Gerhardt et al., 2002). These experiments are conducted in a flow-through system and uses quadrapole electrical impedance methods to monitor the changes in electrical current delivered by the test organism (Gerhardt et al. , 2003). This system has a free-flow design containing a pair of conducting electrodes on one end and a pair of nonconducting electrodes on the opposite end of the vessel (Gerhardt et al. , 2003). A single indicator organism is placed inside and remains suspended within the test chambers (Gerhardt et al. , 2003). Any changes in the electric current between the two sets of electrodes correlate to either the respiration or motility of the indicator species and is recorded in graphical form (Gerhardt et al., 2002). The advantage of using MFB over image analysis tools is that this system can be used for both sediment toxicology and water column tests (Kirkpatrick et al. , 2006). Image analysis requires light to capture the organism's behaviour whereas the MFB system monitors changes in electrical current and therefore the MFB system can be employed under dark and even turbid conditions as well as in the light. The MFB system also runs fully-automated and computer recognition software has been established for a range of organisms. The complete testing procedure, to determine a change in behaviour, can be accomplished in approximately 5 minutes (Kirkpatrick et al. , 2006). MFB has not been used in North American but has been tested in Europe and has proven to accurately detect stressed behaviours of a number of organisms. Therefore, this is another potential system in the detection of environmentally toxic conditions delivering sub-acute results for an early-warning biomonitoring system.

23

2.4.3 Carbon Dioxide and Oxygen Monitoring
Williams and Jenkinson (1982) indicates that oxygen is the most reliable endpoint measurable for plants and animals because it is either the product or reactant in biological processes when exposing the organisms to stressors. Plants are primary producers and therefore undergo photosynthetic reactions where carbon \fioxide is a reactant and oxygen is produced (Tothill and Turner, 1996). Most animals use oxygen to facilitate metabolic reactions and undergo respiration (Tothill and Turner, 1996). These two gases can be quantified to identify abnormal photosynthetic/respiration rates in plants and animals and determine stress responses. Dissolved oxygen probes or a respirometer may be used to measure the concentration of oxygen to indicate how the process of

photosynthesis/respiration is altered in the presence of stressors compared to normal conditions (Tothill and Turner, 1996). Depending how quickly different stressors affect the light and dark reactions, it will determine the degree of flux and the location of disturbance in the photosynthetic reaction (Tothill and Turner, 1996). Chen eta/. (2001) used dissolved oxygen (DO) probes in their respiration tests with 9 different mussel species to determine fluctuations in oxygen consumption. Winkler titration delivers one of the most accurate measurements for DO in aquatic environments, having a coefficient of variation of only 0.5%, and is favoured over DO probes for accuracy (Williams and Jenkinson, 1982). This technique is quite simple and relatively rapid but very tedious and when titrating a large number of samples could result in diminished the quality of results (Williams and Jenkinson, 1982). Monitoring and analysing oxygen

consumption/development could be used as a parameter in developing an early-warning biomonitoring system for plants and animals.

2.4.4 Integration of Biomonitoring Systems
Integrating the ECOTOX, MFB and C0 2/0 2 monitoring systems to assess the photosynthetic/respiratory and locomotion behaviours of indicator organisms such as, L.

minor, P. subcapitata, E. gracilis and A. grandis could be part of a suit of organisms
rapidly and accurately identifying a large range of contaminants in freshwater sources. Determining additional harmful concentrations of additional chemicals will help expand the list of identifiable toxins which is necessary when using an early-warning

biomonitoring system. A limited amount of research has been conducted on earlywarning biomonitoring systems, meaning that it is an ideal field to investigate. Once the integration of biological responses (to stressors) have been identified, an engineering solution to extract these contaminants is the next step in preventing unsafe drinking water. Traditional European biological early-warning systems (BEWS) have a very limited scope of information that they provide to end-users. European researchers such as Tahedl and Hader ( 1998) use a single-organism application which may produce false positives, or more detrimentally, false negatives and they are unable to identify culprit classes of stressors. Gerhardt et al. (2003) approached BEWS with a multi-species system but only isolates changes in electrical currents (locomotion and respiration). To date, this multi-species system has not been implemented in the field. Our system radically expands upon these simplistic BEWS by incorporating multi-organism, multi-response parameters in models that allow a much more accurate assessment and identification of incoming stressors. Results from this study will directly influence human exposure to chemical · contaminants contained in drinking water sources and reduce health risks.

CHAPTER 3 MATERIALS and METHODOLOGY
Each organism was monitored for selected sub-acute parameters outlined below. Each organisms' culturing practices and their specific experimental procedures to monitor normal behaviours in contrast to any changes under the addition of test chemicals over a given time period are outlined below. Concentrations of the two test chemicals TBT (Sigma Aldrich, 234788, 97% purity) and atrazine (Ultra Scientific, CPS-380, 98% purity) were diluted in 0.5% v/v DMSO prior to addition in corresponding test vessels.

3.1

Equipment Disinfection

The selected aquatic indicator species are very sensitive to external chemicals and therefore washing experimental apparatus, especially glassware, is of high importance. Prior to and following any experiments, all glassware equipment which would directly come into contact with any of the organisms was washed with acetone three times and rinsed following every wash. This initial wash, in particular, removed any excess tributyltin residue adhereding to the walls of the test chambers. Following the acetone wash, a high-grade detergent, Extran organic decontaminating soap (VWR Cat#: CAEX0995-1 ), was used to scrub off and remove any unwanted organics. The vessels were then rinsed with distilled water. Lastly, glassware was acid-washed using 10% v/v hydrochloric acid (HCl) and rinsed · with distilled water. If certain equipment needed sterilization it was autoclaved and cooled prior to use.

3. 2

Winkler Titrations

Modified Winkler Titration methods were derived from The Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - lAP 2006 Lab 1: Determination of Dissolved Oxygen. Preparation of five reagents was required prior to toxicity testing. Labelled scintillation vials, filled with no head space, required immediate addition of 50 J.!l manganese chloride

26

(MnCh) and 50 J.tl of sodium iodide (Nal). The vial was sealed, inverted to mix the reagents well and allowed to precipitate and flocculate. Samples were inverted a second time and left for 30 minutes until precipitate settled again. Sulphuric acid (H2S04) was added (50 J.tL) and vials were inverted once again until the precipitate disappeared. Samples were then stored in the dark for later titration. After all the samples were collected, they were diluted to a 100 mL solution with deionized water in a beaker and starch indicator was added. Titration of each sample was conducted using a micropipette. Aliquots of a prepared thiosulfate reagent were added (1 0 J.!L) to the diluted samples until the initial dark blue solution became transparent marking the endpoint of the titration and dissolved oxygen was calculated based upon the volume of the titrant added (Appendix
B).

3.3

Culturing Indicator Organisms

3.3.1 Lemna minor
A culturing tank, a 15-L glass aquarium, was cleaned and rinsed with distilled water prior to the addition of any cultures. Culturing medium, Hunter's medium, containing macronutrients and micronutrients, which are required in large and small quantities respectively, were added to promote optimum growth (Table 3.1). Four solutions were prepared using the concentrations (g/L) of chemicals outlined in Table 3.1. When preparing solution #4, the ferric citrate was be added first and heated to dissolve the salt prior to the addition of the remaining reagents. A stock solution was prepared by adding each of the four solutions in accordance with the protocol in Table 1 (right column) and 10 g/L of sucrose was later added (Hunter, 1953). Sterile monocultures of

Lemna minor were ordered from Wards TM Natural Science (Item# 86 V 7650). The plants
were placed in the culturing vessels for two weeks prior to any testing to optimize the organism's growth patterns. The culturing aquarium was placed in a laminar flow hood equipped with a light bank delivering 90 J.!E·m-2·s- 1 of light and the temperature was kept at 25 ± 2°C (an Einstein (E) is a unit used in irradiance and is defined as one mole of photons regardless of frequency). Reduced strength (25% of the initial concentration) growth medium was added to the tank on weekly basis to replenish required growth

27

nutrients (Hunter, 1953). The stock culture was transferred monthly to newly prepared growth medium monthly in order to maintain a sterile culture.

3.3.2 Pseudokirchneriel/a subcapitata

All glassware was washed using the technique described above and the transferring equipment was from sterile packaging. One litre of algae growth medium, Bristol's solution (Table 3.2), was prepared by adding 10 mL of each stock (A- F) into a 1-L volumetric flask and filled with distilled water (940 mL ). After a 1-L solution was made, one drop of 1% FeCb solution was added. Six 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks were filled with 150 mL of the growth medium and then sterilized in the autoclave for 45 minutes at 15 psi. Preparation of Bristol's solution required six stock solutions individually containing one of the following chemicals: NaN0 3 , K2HP0 4 , CaCh, KH2 P04 , MgS0 4 , FeCb and NaCl. A monoculture of algae (WardsTM Natural Science: Item# 86 V 0620) was stored in a cool area at 10°C on an agar slant. Each flask was inoculated using aseptic technique by looping algae into the sterile medium. Aluminum foil was loosely fitted on the opening of the flasks to allow for gas exchange and minimize contamination. The culturing vessels were then placed on a shaker (20 rpm) under a light bank (90 !-1E·m-2 ·s- 1) on a 16:8-h light/dark cycle and kept at a room

28

temperature of 24 ± 2°C. Optimum growth (~5.0 x 106 cells I mL) occurred after 7-14 days. These primary cultures were then viewed under a compound microscope to identify if there were alternate organisms growing in the medium. If contamination was not a factor, then secondary cultures were prepared from these flasks by aseptically transferring 5 mL of the established primary culture into 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing sterile growth medium.

3.3.3 Euglena gracilis

Euglena gracilis was cultured in a similar fashion to that of the algae. All

glassware was washed using the technique described above and transferring equipment was sterilized. One litre of Euglena growth medium (Wards TM Natural Science: Item# 88 V 5200), Euglena-Gro, was prepared and 150 mL was added into six 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Culturing vessels containing growth medium were sterilized in the autoclave for 45 minutes at 15 psi and were allowed to cool down to room temperature prior to transferring the live organisms. A monoculture of Euglena (WardsTM Natural Science: Item# 86 V 2650) was inoculated using aseptic technique by pipetting 5 mL of the concentrated Euglena into the sterile medium. A piece of aluminum foil was loosely fitted on the opening of the flasks to allow for gas exchange and to reduce any contamination. The culturing vessels were then placed on a shaker (20 rpm) under a light bank (90J.!E m-2 s- 1) on a 16:8 hour light/dark cycle and kept at room temperature 24 ±2°C. Optimum growth occurred after 7 days. These primary cultures were then viewed under a compound microscope to identify if there were alternate organisms growing in

29

the medium. If contamination was not a factor then secondary cultures were prepared from these initial culturing vessels. Growth medium was prepared as stated above and 5 mL of the primary cultures was transferred into six new 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks.
3.3.4 Anodonta grandis

Because culturing of Anodonta grandis from the veliger stage requires an intermediate host, it was not possible to replicate within our laboratory and therefore adult mussels used in the bioassays were ordered from a local supplier (WardsTM Natural Science: Item# 87 V 4420). A 30-L aquarium was prepared one week prior to the arrival of the mussels to ensure room temperature was reached. Silica sand was placed at the bottom of the tank (5 em depth) and then the tank was filled three-quarters full with dechlorinated water. An aerator, a simple water filter and a glass cover placed over the tank were set up to provide necessary oxygen reserves and to reduce contamination, respectively. Upon arrival from the supplier, the mussels were immediately set afloat in the culturing tank in their shipping container allowing them to acclimatize to the conditions in the tank. After 6 h, they were slowly released to the sediments and remained in the tank for a 24-h holding period prior to any experimental testing. Mussels were fed pulverized dry algal discs (Wardley® Premium Algae DiscsTM Item# 4150). Some water in the holding tank was replaced every two weeks by removing a quarter of the volume and replacing it with dechlorinated water.
3.4 Experimental Set-up

3.4.1 Lemna minor

Fifteen 50-mL petri dishes were used as test vessels (Figure 3.1). Five individual plants from a stock culture (containing two fronds each) were sterilely transferred to each of their respected 50-mL petri dishes containing either 1) growth media (reference treatment), 2) media plus 0.5% v/v DMSO (carrier treatment), or 3) media plus DMSO plus its respected chemical treatment . Experiments were conducted in triplicate (n=3). Lids were placed on the test vessels to reduce contamination from exposure to falling particles from the air. TBT concentrations selected were 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 J..Lg/L and atrazine concentrations selected were 5.0, 50.0 and 500.0 J..Lg/L. Increasing concentrations

of a selected chemical were prepared and added to their corresponding test vessels. Frond production over a 96-h period was monitored and manually counted using time-lapse digital photography in 24-h increments, beginning at t=O.

3.4.2 Pseudokirchneriel/a subcapitata

The photosynthetic and growth rates of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were quantified via two separate experiments, one which monitored biochemical changes of the photosystems and the other monitored the organism's doubling rate. Results were compared to their normal growth/photosynthetic rate over a defined period of time. Separate experiments were conducted to identify which parameter delivered the best results in minimal time, using the most simplistic methods with minimal costs, yet still delivering rigorous scientific results. Experiments involved measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) (Figure 3.2). Samples of a known concentration of cells were placed in 25mL scintillation vials which were then filled completely, eliminating head space. These vials were sacrificed every hour for a 6-h period to measure the changes in DO over time. The oxygen content dissolved in the test vessels were accurately measured using Winkler titrations as outlined in Section 3 .2. Experiments were performed in parallel in both light and the dark environments to compare the effects of the selected chemical on the photosynthetic and respiratory biochemical pathways of the plants. Reference samples were used to contrast the effects of vials exposed to selected contaminants of various concentrations. Another reference treatment was exposed only to the carrier compound, (0.5% v/v DMSO), to identify if this chemical had an effect on the organisms alone. Chemical treatments used in these experiments were 10.0 and 100.0 11g/L of TBT and 50.0 and 500.0 11g/L of atrazine. All experiments were done in triplicate (n=3). Secondly, the growth inhibition experiments were performed using an Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 96-well microplate photometer (MultiSkan-Ascent Thermo Scientific®) to indirectly measure cell counts. Cultures of algae were subcultured every two weeks prior to the following experimentation to maintain the organisms in their log growth phase. Microplates (6-well) were used for experimental vessels to maintain a sterile environment (Figure 3.3).

A standard regression curve (Figure 3.4) was initially constructed using a known concentration of algae dilutions and correlating these samples with OD readings from the ELISA. Once algae cell dilutions were prepared, each test tube was verified using a haemocytometer to count individual cells in a defined volume. Counts were done in triplicate (n=3) and absorbance readings were done seven times (n=7) to deliver a slope of 0.0002 with an r2 of 0.9928.

3.4.3 Euglena gracilis

The stress behaviours of E. gracilis can be monitored to deliver information about its surrounding environment. Under stressed conditions the motile organism will alter its shape from its normal elongated spindle form into a contracted stressed cyst conformation (Figure 3.5: (b)). A known concentration of Euglena stock was placed in 25-mL scintillation vials and then a set of tests were placed in the two different lighting conditions (light and dark). When E. gracilis was exposed to increasing concentrations of a selected chemical, a ratio of spindle shape to cyst form over a 6-h period was observed.

E. gracilis also has plant characteristics and therefore its photosynthetic output

can be monitored. Thus, respiration endpoints were utilized. Standardized diluted samples of E. gracilis were placed in 25 mL scintillation vials and sacrificed every hour over a 6-h time period (Figure 3.2). Chemical treatments used in these experiments were 10.0 and 100.0 Jlg/L of TBT and 50.0 and 500.0 Jlg/L of atrazine. DO was monitored using the Winkler titrations as outlined in Section 3.2 and the production of oxygen in reference vials were compared to vials exposed to increasing concentrations of a selected test chemical. Growth inhibition experiments were also conducted on E. gracilis. 6-well microplates were used for experimental vessels to maintain a sterile environment (Figure 3.3). A blank (only sterile growth medium), a reference containing only Euglena (no addition of any chemicals) and 0.5% v/v DMSO treatments were conducted for comparison with different treatments of test chemicals. Measured volumes of chemical treatments were placed in each of the wells and done in triplicate. Chemical treatments used in these experiments were 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 J..Lg/L ofTBT and 5.0, 50.0 and 500.0 Jlg/L of atrazine. E. gracilis was then added at time zero and the first reading was taken. 200 J.!L volumes were extracted in triplicate from each test vessel and transferred into a 96-well microplate. The 96-well plate was placed in the ELISA microplate photometer which determined the absorbance of each well based on the optical density (OD) at 650 nm and indirectly the number of cells present in each treatment. A regression curve was produced comparing the relationship between cell counts and absorbance at 650 nm (Figure 3.6). Concentrated samples of E. gracilis were counted using a haemocytometer (n=4) and then placed in a 96-well microplate photometer (MultiSkan-Ascent Thermo Scientific®) to correlate the number of organisms with a specific absorbance (n=7). This regression curve was used to estimate cell counts and comparisons between reference and test chemicals treatments. Counts were done in triplicate (n=3) and absorbance readings were done seven times (n=7) to deliver a slope of 0.0048 with an r2 of 0.9984.

vessel with 995-mL of dechlorinated water for 12 h. A 5-mL dilution of the test chemical was added to the corresponding 1-L beakers at t=O and a modified watchglass with a sample extraction tube protruding through the center was placed on the surface of the vessel (Figure 3.7). This modified lid isolated the contents of the test vessel from the atmosphere to minimize aeration of the sample and contaminants falling from the air. Chemical treatments used in these experiments were 0.1 , 1.0 and 10.0 1-lg/L of TBT and 0.5 , 5.0 and 50.0 1-lg/L of atrazine. Tests were conducted in five replicates (Figure 3.8).

Multiple endpoints were monitored at one time. While DO samples were being extracted, behavioural observations were also made every hour for a total of 6 hours. Behavioural tests were done by observing the valve movements and recorded as either open or closed positions. Respiration rates were conducted by extracting 25 mL samples from the test vessels via the extraction tube. Samples were slowly added to scintillation vials to reduce aeration. The Winkler titration method, outlines in Section 3.2, was performed to determine the DO content of individual samples of TBT. A DO probe (NexSens Smart USB Dissolved Oxygen Sensor, WQ-DO) was used in atrazine due to its ability to determine DO accurately for these particular experiments. This particular DO probe connects to a computer via a USB port and can deliver DO readings in real time. The probe was incorporated into the experimental design to determine its sensitivity for changes in DO compared to Winkler titrations. The experimental design using the DO probe was the exact same as indicated above with a few modifications, the DO was quantified with the probe as oppose to Winkler titrations. The watchglass lid with extraction tube was not required but was replaced with a ·Parafilm cover to prevent oxygen dissolving into the test medium.

CHAPTER4 RESULTS and DISCUSSION
Quantities of freshwater sources are not as plentiful as one would think. Protecting the limited quantities that are available is necessary to preserve life (Anderson, 2003 ; Sabik et al. , 2000). Currently, water treatment plants (WTP) chemically treat and test for unwanted chemical and biological contaminants that could cause health risks to end-users. Chemical analysis is an expensive process and takes a considerable amount of time in contrast to a biological approach. This drives environmental studies and specifically this research to develop cost-effective biomonitoring methods, delivering sub-acute, accurate results which enhance current chemical analysis accuracy. The indicator organisms selected for use in the bioassays show sensitivity to selected concentrations of TBT and atrazine.

TBT was used in these experiments to determine if the compound had any effect on the selected indicator organisms. TBT was heavily researched in the past and is banned from use as a paint additive for the shipping industry (Antizar-Ladislao, 2008; Clark et al. , 1988; Dubey and Roy, 2002; Kontrikla, 2009). A number of international ships continue to deposit TBT in North American waters due to the lack of implementation of chemical bans in other countries and therefore deserves attention to its effects on non-target organisms. TBT had an effect on all the organisms tested.

Atrazine has been used heavily in the environment on agricultural crops as a commercial herbicide (Chevre et al. , 2006). It is susceptible to runoff to nearby lakes and streams and can even travel to distant fresh waters (Chevre et al. , 2006). Due to its existence in the environment it was selected for investigation on how it affects nontargeted indicator organisms. Experiments were conducted with the same organisms as the TBT bioassays to identify if atrazine had a significant altering effect on the normal behavio.urs of these species. Changes in the biochemical, morphological, and

43

physiological parameters due to exposure with atrazine and TBT were monitored and are presented below. A summary of the results are presented in Section 4.3 , highlighting the parameters delivering sub-acute responses to atrazine and TBT. These responses provide support for the inclusion of these organisms in the development of an early-warning biomonitoring system due to their rapid responses in identifying unfavourable aquatic conditions.
4.1 Bioassay organism responses to Tributyltin-hydride (TBT) 4.1.1 Lemna minor

Experiments were conducted using Lemna minor in conjunction with TBT and investigated the changes to the organism' s growth rate over a 96-h test period. Figure 4.1 outlines the results obtained from the growth inhibition experiments showing frond counts at different times (Appendix C). The reference treatment displays the normal growth of fronds and was compared to TB T treatments.

In Figure 4.1 , the reference, dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1.0 J.tg/L treatments were observed to have similar number of fronds at corresponding time intervals. The carrier, 0.5% v/v DMSO, was used to see if it had an effect on the frond production of this plant. DMSO portrayed a similar growth pattern throughout the entire experiment. The development of new fronds in the 10.0 J.tg/L treatment plateaued after a 24-h exposure and maintained this impeded growth for the remainder of the 96-h experiment. Exposing the aquatic plant to 100.0 J.tg/L of TBT dramatically halted its ability to produce new fronds. After 48 hours, a loss of pigmentation within the majority of the leaves was observed. At the 96-h sampling period, green fronds were undetectable and had complete loss of all chlorophyll. Growth rates were determined for each treatment and statistically analysed (Table 4.1) to determine if there was a significant difference of growth over the experimental period. Significant differences of the growth rate between the reference and all other treatments were analysed using Analysis of Variance (ANOV A) with a Tukey pair-wise post hoc comparison to determine the probability that there was a difference between growth rates.

Table 4.1 outlines the p-values comparing the reference to each treatment. Values less than 0.05 indicated a significant difference between the growth rates. When the growth rates were analysed for variance from the reference treatment, plants exposed to 10.0 and 100.0 Jlg/L of TBT produced p-values of less than 0.05 . This represented a 95% probability that these growth rates were different in comparison to those of the reference test. L. minor had a significant decreased rate of growth when exposed to concentrations of TBT as low as 10 !lg/L and proved to be highly sensitive to relatively higher concentrations of TBT (1 00 Jlg/L) also. This organism could help in the early-warning detection of TBT in contaminated waters. Therefore, L. minor would be a good candidate in the development of a multispecies early-warning biomonitoring system.

4.1.2 Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata Three different bioassays were conducted with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. The first two tests, photosynthesis and respiration rate, investigated biochemical endpoints where dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were quantified using the Winkler titration method in individual scintillation vials. The DO content was then plotted over time to produce the photosynthetic/respiration rate (slope). The final test involved monitoring cell counts over a 72-h period with exposure to different concentrations of TBT.
A) Biochemical Endpoint #1: Photosynthetic Rate (Light experiments)

The photosynthetic rates (slopes) from Table 4.2 (Appendix D) are shown in Figures 4.2. Light experiments were conducted to investigate the fluctuations of DO development facilitated by the photosynthetic capability of Pseudokirchneriella
subcapitata and determine ifTBT affects the production of oxygen.

Figure 4.2 shows that there were similar photosynthetic trends observed in the reference, 0.5% v/v DMSO and 10.0 J..tg/L of TBT treatment. Light samples of algae exposed to 100.0 J..tg/L of TBT showed a reduced photosynthetic rate trend in comparison to those of the reference treatment. The photosynthetic rates were also analysed statistically to determine if there was a significant difference between the reference and all other treatments (Table 4.3). Light experiments involving photosynthetic rate were performed using individual isolated vessels and were analysed by determining the equality of two correlations (Kruskal-Wallis test) comparing the reference photosynthetic rates with other three treatments. This statistical test produced p-values (Table 4.3) which indicated if there was a linear correlation amongst the reference and test treatments. The test indicated that there was no significant difference amongst treatments in comparison to the reference. With exposure to the highest concentration of TBT (1 00 !lg/L), there was a decreased production of 0 2 and therefore this endpoint should be considered as an earlywarning indicator.

B) Biochemical Endpoint #2: Respiration Rate (Dark experiments)
The second biochemical endpoint investigated the respiration rate of the algae and it was conducted in the absence of light. These sets of experiments were done in parallel with the light experiments to ensure similar environmental conditions. Table 4.4 presents the individual DO measurements (±SD) at each time increment and also the respiration rate (slope) developed by each treatment (Appendix E). Declining 0 2 concentrations from respiration delivers a negative slope and therefore the slope was multiplied by negative one to give positive values. The slopes were also transposed into Figure 4.3 which shows the respiration rate for each treatment with its corresponding standard deviation.

Further investigation for this experiment was done through statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test. This statistical test produced p-values (Table 4.5) which indicated if there was a correlation amongst the reference and test treatments. None of the values exceeded 0.05, which gives the data significance. Monitoring the respiration rate of the green algae did not produce significant results and was not an ideal parameter for this particular organism to detect a contaminated environment.

C) Growth inhibition test (Cell counts)

The last endpoint investigated for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was to observe changes in cell growth over a 72-h period. In photosynthetic plants, a block along the electron transport chain causes interference in normal growth and inhibits the organism's ability to reproduce effectively. Figure 4.4 displays the algae's growth at increasing time increments for all treatments (Appendix F). Cell counts were calculated indirectly using a regression curve (Figure 3.4) which accurately compared cell numbers to OD at 650 nm.
It was observed that the carrier, 0.5% v/v DMSO, had an effect on the growth rate for this

particular set of experiments which could be due to a contaminated chemical stock of DMSO. Table 4.6 was produced to statistically show that the carrier did have an effect. Also, Table 4.7 was constructed to isolate the effects of the test chemical and not the compound effects caused by the carrier and the TBT. Exposure to 1.0 and 10.0 J.lg/L of TBT did not seem to have a toxic effect . When the algae were treated with 100.0 J.lg!L of TBT, it showed a quick halt in its growth rate after 24 hours and a slow increase of cell death for the remainder of the experiment.

52

Statistical significance for these growth inhibition experiments was determined using ANOVA with a Tukey pair-wise post hoc comparison. The statistical test was used to determine whether selected concentrations of TBT affected the growth rate in comparison to those of the reference treatment. Table 4.6 compared reference growth rates with all other treatments and Table 4.7 compared DMSO exposure with all other TBT treatments. Values less than 0.05 indicated there was a significant difference with 95% probability that there was a difference in growth rate. When comparing all treatments with the reference, there was more than 99% probability that all other treatments had an effect. Therefore, a second analysis was prepared (Table 4.7) comparing effects of only the test chemical. In this table, only the 100.0
~giL

of TBT

produced a value of less than 0.05. This test proves that this parameter has potential in delivering sub-acute response when exposed to concentrations higher than 100
~giL

of

TBT and therefore should be considered for the early-warning biomonitoring system.

After three separate experiments, it was determined that P. subcapitata responded well as an early-warning bioindicator. Two of the three experiments, photosynthetic rate and cell inhibition tests, are recommended for further experimentation with alternate chemicals to determine the sensitivity at the sub-acute level.

4.1.3 Euglena gracilis
Tests performed with Euglena gracilis with exposure to TBT were similar to that of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. In addition to the biochemical tests and the cell counts, Euglena also underwent behavioural tests to determine changes in the cell morphology with exposure to TBT. These behavioural experiments were conducted in parallel in both the light and dark environments.

A) Biochemical Endpoint #1: Respiration Rate (Light experiments)

Firstly, Euglena underwent biochemical experiments in the light (Appendix G) due to the protist's ability to act as a primary producer and capture light via their internal chloroplasts. Results from the light exposure experiment did not fit a linear relationship and therefore a figure was not prepared. Table 4.8 displays the non-linear relationship by displaying low r2 values derived from the slope for each treatment. It was determined that this experimental set-up did not allow for proper determination that the organism was experiencing stressful conditions Therefore, Euglena respiration rate experiments are not recommended for future experimentation for the purposes of early-warning detection system.

B) Biochemical Endpoint #2: Respiration Rate (Dark experiments)
Euglena's ability to undergo photosynthesis and respiration posed conflicting

measurements when exposed to light and therefore biochemical monitoring experiments were also conducted in the dark to eliminate the photosynthetic abilities of this organism and isolate their respiratory parameters (Appendix H). Figure 4.5 displays the respiration

rates (±SD) of Euglena gracilis when tests were conducted in the dark. In comparison to the reference treatment, the carrier DMSO shows a similar respiratory trend. Also both treatments of TBT, 10.0 and 100.0 J.tg/L, do not differentiate very much from the average respiration rate of the reference trails. Respiration rates were analysed using the KruskalWallis test to statistically determine if there was a correlations between the respiration rates when comparing the reference to all other treatments. Values less than 0.05 indicate a 95% probability that the treatment respiration rates are different from the reference. Table 4.9 illustrates there was no significant similarity between the reference treatment by comparing the equality of two correlations. Results from this experiment show that monitoring the respiration rate of Euglena was not a useful measurement allowing for the early detection of TBT in the water column. Therefore, it is not a suitable indicator for this specific chemical but could show sensitivity to other aquatic contaminants.

C) Growth inhibition test (Cell counts)

Cell counts were also performed with Euglena similar to that with algae (Appendix 1). Tests were conducted over a 72-h period and absorbance readings were transformed using a regression curve (Figure 3.6). Figure 4.6 displays the cell counts over a 72-h period for all treatments. Data plotted in Figure 4.6 was log-transformed prior to ANOVA testing with a Tukey post hoc comparison. The log transformation was performed to allow linear analysis of the data. Once the data was transformed, a slope was calculated for cell numbers over time. This slope was then analysed using an ANOVA test to determine if the reference growth rates differed in comparison to the TBT -treated tests. Figure 4.6 indicates that there is no growth rate change for any of the TBT treatments. Statistical analysis of the cell counts was performed to determine if the TBT treatments had a significant correlation with the reference as shown in Table 4.1 0.

Values less than or equal to 0.05 indicated that there was a 95% probability that they were different. The lowest value presented in Table 4.10 was 0.920 and therefore indicated that all growth rates for this test were similar. It was determined that using a regression curve to perform cell counts for Euglena was not an appropriate test for the purpose of early detection of detrimental levels TBT in aquatic environments and this experiment was not recommended in the final multispecies early-warning biomonitoring system.

D) Behavioural Experiment #1: Light Exposure
The last type of experiments with Euglena gracilis explored the behavioural changes with exposure to potentially stressed situations. These tests were conducted again in both the light and in the dark. The light test was carried out for 6 hours and two different morphologies of cells, spindle (normal) and cyst (stressed), were counted (n=3) at each sampling time (Appendix J). Normal spindle-shaped Euglena were selected based on a fully-elongated cell type and stressed cells were counted if they were fully contracted in their spherical cyst conformation or if they were partially contracted. Once all cell types were counted, the percentage of cyst cells was calculated and was presented in Figure 4.7. Observations of cyst-shaped Euglena cells increased over time for all treatments (reference, DMSO, 10 and 100 J.lg/L) but a relatively higher percentage was found in the 10.0 and 100.0 J.Lg/L treatments of TBT. The carrier in the experiment showed similar cell shape trends in comparison to the reference and therefore did not appear to have an effect on the morphology of this organism. Euglena morphology was a good measure of stressed conditions, in the short term, when experiments were conducted in the light.

E) Behavioural Experiment #2: Dark Exposure

Behavioural analysis experiments in the dark were performed in parallel with light exposure experiments. Percentage of cyst cells observed for dark experiments at indicated time increments (±SD) are presented in Figure 4.8 (Appendix K). Reference and DMSO treatments showed similar trends of approximately 60% cyst shaped cells at the end of the 6-h experiment while 10.0 and 100.0 J.lg/L TBT treatments present much lower percentages. At the end of the dark experiment with no exposure to TBT Euglena preferred to be in the cyst conformation which is usually associated with stress. This particular protist contains chloroplasts and has the ability to photosynthesis. In the short term, exposing the organism in to complete darkness acts as an additional stressor which could explain the unexpected results displayed in Figure 4.8. A combination stress effect could be occurring and therefore chemical exposure experiments monitoring the morphology of Euglena are not recommended in the early-warning system.

4.1.4 Anodonta grandis
Two different parameters were observed during the freshwater mussel exposure to different concentrations of TBT. The first one was the open and closed behaviour of the mussel valves (Appendix L). The open configuration denoted that the mussel was respiring and if the valves appeared closed then it was assumed that respiration was not occurring. Results from these experiments were inconclusive. The percentages of open valves are presented in Table 4.11. The initial intent for monitoring these two parameters was to correlate the open/closed confirmation with the respiration rate (DO content).

The second endpoint was to quantify the respiration rate by determining the DO content over time for each test vessel using Winkler titrations. Figure 4.9 displays the results (±SD) for the 6-h experiment with exposure to increasing concentrations of TBT. Data presented in Figure 4.9 was derived from the average respiration rates from five replicates for a given treatment (Appendix M). The reference displays the expected respiration rate per mass of the mussel under normal conditions where no influence from external toxic chemicals is exhibited. The TBT carrier, 0.5o/o v/v DMSO, was introduced to all the test vessels except for the reference. Vessels with only the addition of DMSO showed a similar respiration trend relative to the reference treatment. The lowest concentration of TBT, 0.1 ~g/L demonstrated an increased oxygen consumption rate. Greater test concentrations (1.0 and 10.0
~g/L

of TBT) showed a noticeable decrease in of TBT. ANOV A tests with a Tukey

the respiration rate in comparison to the 1.0

~g/L

post hoc comparison were conducted on the respiration rates and p-values determining if

treatments were significantly different from the reference are displayed in Table 4.12.

Values less than or equal to 0.05 would show a significant difference from the reference. This statistical analysis did not show that there was any statistical difference amongst any of the treatments when compared to the reference. Freshwater mussels are very sensitive organisms and respiration was a good indicator of stress. There was a

. Bioassay organism responses to atrazine

Identical toxicity bioassays were performed with the second chemical of interest in this research, atrazine and followed the same protocols used for experimentation with TBT. All indicator organisms were subject to the same test procedures with alterations in chemical concentrations due to the environmental relevance and allowable limits in aquatic waters.
4.2.1 Lemna minor

Changes to the organism' s growth rate were monitored over a 96-h test period (Appendix N) by making frond counts in 24-h increments. Figure 4.10 outlines the results obtained from the growth inhibition experiments relating frond counts to the growth rate of the macrophyte. The reference treatment represents a normal growth progression of the plant species and is compared to the addition of the carrier, DMSO and also three concentrations of atrazine. Exposure to 0.5% DMSO showed to have a similar growth pattern in relation to the reference treatment. With the addition of 5.0 and 50.0 J.lg/L of atrazine, the ability of the plant to grow new fronds is slightly retarded. After a 24-h exposure to 500.0 J.lg/L of atrazine, it was observed that these macrophytes are unable to reproduce and the growth rate plateaus for the remainder of the 96-h experiment. Statistical analysis was further conducted on the growth rate date to determine if there was a significant difference in comparison with the reference.

Differences between the reference growth rate and all other treatments were analysed using ANOV A with a Tukey pair-wise post hoc comparison to determine the probability that there is a difference between slopes (growth rates). Table 4.13 outlines the p-values comparing the reference to each treatment. Values less than 0.05 showed there is significant difference between the growth rates. This represented a 95% probability that these growth rates were different in comparison to the reference test. Significant difference from the reference was only shown with exposure to 500 J.lg/L of atrazine. L. minor is sensitive to relatively higher concentrations of atrazine (500 J.lg/L), and would detect contaminated waters at the sub-acute level. Therefore, this macrophyte should be considered in the development of an early-warning biomonitoring system.

4.2.2 Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata

Three tests were conducted with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata with exposure to selected concentrations of atrazine. Two of the tests analysed the biochemical endpoints, photosynthesis and respiration, and the third test investigated the cell proliferation over 72-h.
A) Biochemical Endpoint #1: Photosynthetic Rate (Light experiments)

The average DO content in light exposure experiments for individual sampling periods and the photosynthetic rate (slope) are outlined in Table 4.14 (Appendix 0). DO content was quantified using Winkler titrations for experiments done in triplicate (n=3). The slopes for individual treatments in Table 4.14 are representative of the columns in Figure 4.11. Declining 0 2 concentrations from respiration delivers a negative slope and therefore the slope was multiplied by negative one to give positive values. The photosynthetic rates in Figure 4.11 display how the algae were affected by two concentrations of atrazine. 0.5o/o v/v DMSO had a similar photosynthetic rate to the reference. There was a noticeable decreasing trend in oxygen production with a 6-h exposure to 50.0 J.lg/L of atrazine and a depletion of oxygen concentrations with exposure to the 500.0 J.lg/L of atrazine. The data from light experiments were statistically analysed and presented in Table 4.15. Individual vessels were analysed by determining the equality of two correlations using the Kruskal-Wallis test which compared the reference photosynthetic rates with all other treatments. These statistical tests produced p-values which indicated if there were rate correlations and are displayed in Table 4.15 for light experiments. A p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 indicates a significant difference in photosynthetic rate with a 95% probability that the rates are different. This experiment showed that there was a significant difference amongst the reference and the highest concentration of atrazine.

With exposure to the highest concentration of atrazine (500 j.!g/L), it showed to have a negative production of 0 2 indicating significant production in C0 2 due to cellular respiration. This accounts for the negative rate in Figure 4.11. Therefore this endpoint is considered to be an early-warning parameter for this species of green algae when exposed to atrazine.

Biochemical analysis of oxygen content was also performed in the dark. Results from dark exposure tests, including average DO content and photosynthetic rate (slope), are outlined in Table 4.16 (Appendix P). The slopes from Table 4.16 are also presented in Figure 4.12 with standard deviations. DO content was quantified using Winkler titrations for experiments done in triplicate (n=3).

Respiration rates for all treatments in dark experiments exposed to atrazine are shown in Figure 4.12. The reference, DMSO and 50.0 J.lg/L of atrazine treatments, displayed similar photosynthetic trends where the 500.0 J.lg/L had a noticeable decline in oxygen depletion. Statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine if there was a correlation between the respiration rates of the reference and the other treatments. This statistical test produced p-values (Table 4.17) which indicated if there was a correlation amongst the reference and test treatments. None of the p-values for this test was less than or equal to 0.05, which is necessary for the significance of the data. Monitoring the respiration rate (dark exposure) of the green algae did not produce significant results and was not an ideal parameter for green algae to detect a contaminated environment at the sub-acute level.

accurately compared cell numbers to OD at 650 nm. Exposure to 0.5% v/v DMSO had an effect on the growth rate of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata which can be visually interpreted in Figure 4.13 and statistically in Table 4.18. Table 4.19 was constructed to remove the compound effects of the carrier and target the effects of the test chemical. Exposure to 5 and 50 J.Lg/L of atrazine did not appear to have a toxic effect. The growth rate of the algae quickly plateaued after a 24-h exposure to 500 J.Lg/L of atrazine. Statistical analysis for these growth inhibition experiments were conducted using ANOV A with a Tukey pair-wise post hoc comparison. Table 4.18 uses the reference as an expected growth rate for comparison. Due to the effects of the carrier for this experiment, Table 4.19 was produced to use the DMSO treatment as the reference treatment to eliminate toxicity effects influenced by the carrier chemical. P-values less than or equal to 0.05 indicated there was a 95% probability that there was a difference in growth rates from the reference treatment. In Table 4.19, only the 500.0 J.Lg/L of atrazine produced a p-value of less than 0.05. This test proved that this parameter has potential in delivering sub-acute response when exposed to concentrations equal to or higher than 500 J.Lg/L of atrazine and therefore should be considered for the development of an earlywarning biomonitoring system.

After all three different experiments with the green algae, it was determined that P.
subcapitata responded well as an early-warning bioindicator. Two of the three

experiments, photosynthetic rate and cell inhibition tests, are recommended for further experimentation with alternate chemicals to determine the sensitivity at the sub-acute level.
4.2.3 Euglena gracilis Euglena underwent three types of toxicity bioassays: biochemical (monitoring

oxygen concentrations), growth rate (cell counts), and behavioural analysis (cell morphology). Each test investigated different parameters to see which would deliver the quickest results for this indicator organism. A) Biochemical Endpoint #1: Respiration Rate (Light experiments)
Euglena was monitored for changes in oxygen development in the light with

exposure to two different concentrations of atrazine (Appendix R). Table 4.20 displays that there was a non-linear relationship of the data which is denoted by the low r2 values. Further investigation of this data was not conducted due to the drastic fluctuations in oxygen concentrations at each sampling time. Similar results occurred in the TBT experiments; monitoring the respiration rate of Euglena did not show that the organism was experiencing stressful conditions Therefore, this experiment was not recommended for the development of an early-warning detection system.

conducted in the dark. In this figure it can be observed that there is no difference between the respiration rates for all treatments. Statistical analysis (Table 4.21) was conducted to determine if there was a difference in the respiration rates for this bioassay. Respiration rates were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test to statistically determine if there was equality of the correlations when comparing the reference to all other treatments. Pvalues less than 0.05 indicate a 95% probability that the treatment respiration rates are different from the reference. Table 4.21 illustrates that there was no significant difference among all treatments. Dark experiments with exposure to atrazine show that monitoring the respiration rate of Euglena was not a useful measurement for early detection of any experimental atrazine concentrations used in this study. Therefore was not recommended for further testing with this specific organism and chemical.

Cell count tests were conducted over . a 72-h period (Appendix T) using absorbance readings and a regression curve (Figure 3.6). Figure 4.15 shows all cell counts over the duration of the experiment for all treatments. Statistical analysis of the cell count data is presented in Table 4.22. Data in Figure 4.15 produced a growth rate and this slope was log transformed prior to ANOVA tests with a Tukey post hoc comparison. The log transformation allowed for linear regression analysis to determine if atrazine exposure affected the growth rates of the protist. Figure 4.15 delivers appropriate observations that there is no difference in the growth rates for any treatments with atrazine. Statistical analysis of the cell counts using ANOVA was performed to determine if the atrazine treatments had a significant correlation with the reference and is presented in Table 4.22. P-values less than or equal to 0.05 would indicate that there was a 95o/o probability that they were different. The lowest value in Table 4.22 was 0.962 and therefore
indicate~

that all growth rates for this test were similar. The Euglena-growth

D) Behavioural Experiment #1: Light Exposure
Behavioural tests for Euglena gracilis were conducted over a 6-h period in the light and cell counts of two different morphologies, spindle (normal) and cyst (stressed) (Figure 3.5), were counted (Appendix U). Normal-shaped (spindle) Euglena were

selected based on fully elongated cell types and stressed cells (cyst) were counted if they were fully contracted in their spherical cyst conformation or if they were partially contracted. Once all cell types were counted, the percentage of cyst cells was calculated and was presented in Figure 4.16. The carrier, DMSO, showed similar cell shape trends to the reference and therefore did not appear to have an effect on the morphology of this organism. Stressed cells percentages increased over the course of the experiment for all treatments but 50.0 and 500.0 J..Lg/L treatments of atrazine contained a higher percentage of stressed cells (cyst) by the end of the test period. Experiments conducted on Euglena with exposure to atrazine in the light produced significant data which indicated that the test chemical caused a change in the morphology of the organism. Therefore, cell-shape under light conditions was recommended for the development of the multi species system.

E) Behavioural Experiment #2: Dark Exposure
Behavioural analyses in the dark were performed in parallel with light exposure experiments. Percentage of cyst cells observed for dark experiments at indicated time increments (±SD) are presented in Figure 4.17 (Appendix V). All treatments showed

similar trends of approximately 60% cyst-shaped cells by the end of the 6-h experiment. At the end of the dark experiment with no exposure to atrazine, Euglena preferred to be in the cyst conformation which is usually associated with stress. The chloroplasts contained within the body of the protist allow the organism to undergo photosynthetic reactions. Abruptly exposing the organism to complete darkness poses stressful conditions and explains the unexpected results displayed in Figure 4.17. Experiments monitoring the morphology of Euglena conducted in dark conditions were not recommended for the early-warning system.

4.2.4 Anodonta grandis
Quantifying the respiration rate by determining the DO content over time for each test vessel was accomplished via Winkler titrations. Figure 4.18 displays the results (±SD) for a 6-h experiment with exposure to three concentrations of atrazine, 5.0, 50.0 and 500.0 Jlg/L. Data presented in Figure 4.18 was derived from the average respiration rates from 5 replicates for a given treatment (Appendix W). The reference displays the expected respiration rate per mass of the mussel under normal conditions where no influence from external toxic chemicals is exhibited. Mussel exposure to 0.5% v/v DMSO had a similar respiration rate compared to the reference. Increased concentrations of atrazine displayed a decreasing trend in the respiration rate of the mussels. 500.0 Jlg/L of atrazine caused the average respiration of the mussels to decrease to 50 Jlmol 0 2 ·L- 1·gI.h-I.

The respiration rates (slope) were analysed using an ANOVA test to determine if there was a significant change in respiration rate. ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc comparison were conducted on the respirations rates and p-values determining if treatments were significantly different from the reference are displayed in Table 4.23. Pvalues less than or equal to 0.05 showed a significant difference from the reference. This statistical analysis showed that the 5.0 and 500.0 Jlg/L treatments had a 95% probability that the respiration rates were different from the reference. A. grandis demonstrated that it is a sensitive organism with respect to its respiration rate. The respiration rate of this

oxygen was an alternative endpoint but due to the surface floating behaviour of the macrophyte, it would have been difficult to create a closed environment, eliminating external oxygen from affecting final results. Figure 4.1 indicates that, with exposure to 100.0
~g/L

of TBT, there was a significant decline in the growth rate after the 96-h test.

Also, there was a noticeable decreasing growth trend after 24-h in comparison to the reference samples.

In L. minor tests involving atrazine (Figure 4.1 0) it was found that 500.0

~giL

of

atrazine had significant effects (p=0.001 , Table 4.13) on the growth rate. It is also important to mention that the 0.5% v/v DMSO treatment did not have a significant effect

(p=0.925) and therefore, was an ideal carrier for TBT and atrazine. A digital camera was used to take still photos of the organisms in their test vessels and manual observations of frond counts were recorded. Automation of this experiment could be easily accomplished via time-lapse digital photography and a computer program which could measure surface area of the fronds. Changes in frond surface area over time would represent the growth rate for L. minor and real-time comparisons with reference samples could be conducted automatically.

Photosynthesis, respiration and growth rate were the three endpoints displayed for

P. subcapitata. No concentration of TBT in the 6-h experiment was shown to have an
effect on the photosynthetic or respiration rates. The results in Figure 4.4 display the 72-h growth rates of this particular organism. The exponential growth rate in Figure 4.4 was log transformed prior to linear regression analysis. The 0.5% v/v DMSO showed an effect (p=0.006) on the normal growth rate which was seen in Table 4.6. Table 4. 7 was produced to compare the effects of only the targeted chemical, TBT, and not the carrier. There was a significant difference of growth rate in the 100.0 J..tg/L of TBT treatment when compared to exposure to the carrier.

Photosynthesis experiments exposing the green algae (Figure 4.11) to atrazine concentrations of 500.0 J..tg/L had significant effects, p<O.OO 1 (Table 4.15) and no selected concentrations displayed any effects in the atrazine respiration experiments (Figure 4.12). Algal growth inhibition experiments analyses with exposure to atrazine were conducted comparing the DMSO exposure· to all other treatments due to the effects of the carrier in this test. Atrazine concentrations of 500.0 J..tg!L showed significant effects on the growth rate of the algae (Figure 4.13)

Automation of the algae growth rate experiments could be possible by constructing a flow-through system which periodically pumps a sample into a spectrophotometer that reads the OD at 650-nm and conducts a reference absorbance reading to compare both samples. Manual sampling also takes minimal time to produce results. This set up required the least amount of algae stock and growth medium in

84

comparison to other tests conducted with algae. Once the growth inhibition experiments were set up, sampling periods only took 15 minutes to extract samples, place them in a 96-well microplate and retrieve OD readings.

Experiments conducted with P. subcapitata were performed on E. gracilis with an additional test looking at the behavioural changes of this motile protist. The biochemical experim. ents (DO content) conducted in the light for both TBT and atrazine resulted in non-linear plots. Relatively low r values (Tables 4.8 and 4.20 for TBT and atrazine respectively) were produced for individual replicates. This non-linear fit could be due to the competing photosynthetic rate and respiratory abilities of E. gracilis. It is difficult to isolate and identify fluctuations in DO when a light source is present. Therefore, removal of the light source halted the photosynthetic ability of the organism and targeting specifically the respiration rate. A trend of decreased respiration rates for experiments placed in the dark are presented in Figures 4.5 and 4.14 for TBT and atrazine. Tables 4.9 and 4.21 showed that there was no statistical significance that any treatment had an effect on the organism in the 6-h exposure experiment.
2

The 72-h cell count experiments for E. gracilis delivered inconclusive results. For both TBT (Figure 4.6) and atrazine (Figure 4.15) there was no significant difference between the reference and any of the treatments (Table 4.10 and 4.22 respectively for test chemicals). Using a regression curve linking cell numbers to absorbance readings poses a problem of overlooking the state of the cell and the organism's specific stress response might go unrecognized. E. gracilis under stressed conditions will change its shape from spindle to cyst form. The cell would still be present in the medium and the chloroplasts would still be sensed by a spectrophotometer. The cell count test did not accurately relay what was occurring in the samples. It is interesting to note that this same experiment did deliver significant results when performed with the green algae.

Cell morphology experiments over a 6-h period were investigated in the light and in the dark. Figure 4.7 (light) and Figure 4.8 (dark) showed the effects of TBT. Increased numbers of cyst cells in the light were present after a 6-h exposure to 10.0 J..Lg/L and

85

100.0 Jlg/L of TBT and similar trends were observed in atrazine experiments in both 50.0 Jlg/L and 500.0 Jlg/L treatments. In both dark experiments (TBT and atrazine) the percent cyst shape is relatively higher in the reference and DMSO treatments. This could be due to the dark posing stress on the organism. The carrier, 0.5% v/v DMSO, did not have an effect on E. gracilis in any of the above mentioned experiments.

Respiration experiments for E. gracilis required large quantities of Euglena stock and also hours of preparation and set up prior to the actual experimental procedure. Following the 6-h, experiment the individual titrations were labour intensive and took approximately the same duration as the experiment itself. With this said, and the fact that no significant results were produced for this organism, respiration experiments did not deliver accurate representation of stressed conditions.

Cell shape responses occur very quickly and this endpoint can be automated. Time-lapse still photography or video analysis could be used to monitor Euglena' s behaviour over time. Computer software could be programmed to recognise a specific shape, either spindle (elongated) or cyst (round) (Figure 3.5), to determine the percentage of these different morphologies and calculate the percentage that poses a risk of significant toxicity. Also other parameters have been researched by Tahedl and Hader (1998) which can be automated for short term responses to many freshwater contaminants.

Anodonta grandis was initially observed for two parameters: valve behaviour

(open/closed) and its respiration rate. Correlation between these two parameters would allow for identification of the overall effect of the test chemical. During experimentation, with this particular species of freshwater mussels, it was difficult to determine the configuration of the valves. It was decided that the results from the TBT exposure were inconclusive and behavioural experiments would not be repeated with this particular species of mussel. Mussels exposed to 0.1 Jlg/L of TBT showed an increasing trend of their respiration rate which indicates stressed behaviours. In the 1.0 and 10.0 Jlg/L of TBT treatments, there was a decreasing trend relative to the 0.1 Jlg/L of TBT treatment

86

(Figure 4.9). When statistical analysis was conducted comparing the variance of the largest two treatments, it showed that there was no statistical difference in comparison with the reference.

Mussels exposed to 50.0 Jlg/L and 500.0 Jlg/L of atrazine displayed in Figure 4.18 showed significant differences in respiration rate, p=0.007 and p<O.OOI respectively (Table 4.23). This 6-h respiration experiment showed that increased concentrations of atrazine clearly correlated with the reduced respiration rate for this freshwater mussel species. A DO probe was used for the atrazine tests and it delivered similar DO readings compared to the Winkler titrations performed for TBT tests. With this said, automation of mussel respiration experiments can be devised. The experimental design could be modified using multiple DO probes monitoring individual test vessels. A computer program would take DO readings periodically and compare test samples with reference vessels and determine a critical value that could deem a sample toxic. The behavioural experiments for this particular species of freshwater mussels did not deliver results that could be automated. Past experimental designs such as the "Dreissena-Monitor" developed by Borcherding and Volpers (1994) was designed to monitor open and closed alterations of different bi-valve species. This behaviour has proven to be a plausible endpoint for toxicity tests but A. grandis showed that its mechanical abilities do not allow for accurate analysis for this endpoint.

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS and RECOMMENDATIONS
The primary focus of this research was to select highly-sensitive aquatic indicator species that can detect contaminants and rapidly respond to unsuitable environmental conditions. The ability to actively monitor aquatic conditions with biological organisms delivers the advantage of real-time information (Gerhardt et a/. , 2002; Hader, 2007). Assessments of water-source quality can be conducted in an ongoing manner and contamination could be identified rapidly. This biological system would deliver a holistic approach in detecting water conditions which would complement current costly chemical water assessments. The selected indicator species, Lemna minor, Pseudokirchneriella

subcapitata, Euglena gracilis, and Anodonta grandis demonstrated to be adequate species
in behaving discriminately to varying concentrations TBT and atrazine.

L. minor proved to be a good indicator species for both TBT and atrazine. The

growth inhibition experiments showed a significant decrease in growth rate at 10.0 J..Lg/L of TBT and 500.0 J..Lg/L atrazine. Also, L. minor growth inhibition experiments can be run at very low cost producing accurate results comparable to that of chemical analysis. The experimental set up proposed can also be automated with minimal additions. To decrease the response time it is recommended that Lemna gibba, another free-floating macrophyte with a doubling time of 0. 7 days, be used to deliver quicker results.

Comparing all the tests conducted with P. subcapitata, the cell counts using the MultiScan microplate reader correlating OD at 650-nm with number of cells or chlorophyll content proved to be the best indicator of stress. These tests were conducted over a 72-h period but could be done in a shorter time frame. Significant differences occurred at 100.0 J..Lg/L of TBT and 500.0 J..Lg/L atrazine. This test required minimal materials, was cost effective relative to chemical analysis, and sampling times required

88

little time to produce results. It would be possible to construct a free-flow system for the
~xperimental

design of an early-warning biomonitoring system.

Behavioural analysis of E. gracilis observing the changes in the cell shape was the most effective test for this organism. The experiments delivered results in 6 hours which is relatively short-term compared to chemical analysis. The experimental design was very simple to construct but would require modification and computer programming to develop cell shape identification software. A large percentage of stressed organisms, identified by the cyst conformation, were identified in less than 6 hours and at concentrations of 10.0 Jlg/L of TBT and 50.0 Jlg/L of atrazine in light experiments.

The freshwater mussels selected for the bioassays could not be monitored for valve movement behaviours due to the difficulties in identifying the open and closed configuration. Other researchers have used alternate species to monitor valve behaviours and have automated monitoring such behavioural characteristics. It is not recommended that this particular species of mussels, A. grandis, be used for behavioural experiments. Another disadvantage to using mollusc species is that they will accumulate certain chemicals in the soft tissues of their visceral mass and therefore can not be reused in further experiments. They must be placed in a holding tank after exposure to any chemical and new mussels must be used. In the field mussels will have to be replaced on a regular basis to monitor aquatic conditions. The respiration rates showed to be an accurate endpoint for tests conducted with TBT and atrazine. Changes in respiration rates were observed at 0.1 Jlg/L of TBT and 50.0 Jlg/L of atrazine. The experimental set up for

A. grandis is quite simple and could be automated by increasing the number of DO
probes used and also the development of a computer program to monitor the oxygen levels in test and reference samples. Recalibrating the DO probes and replacing the mussels would be the only ongoing maintenance required after the system was completely set up.

This research demonstrated that all organisms used in this study displayed sensitivity to selected concentrations of TBT and atrazine for specific endpoints and

89

allowed for accurate assessment of contaminants. Essentially, these laboratory tests will lead to the development of an automated biological system which can monitor a range of organisms' behaviours using computer analysis software to quantify these behavioural and biochemical endpoints to assess the quality of aquatic environments. A summary of currently-used technologies have been mentioned in this document, providing a starting point in the development of a holistic, multi-organism, multi-response, early-warning biomonitoring system. Only two chemicals were tested in this research and further experimentation with other chemical classes is recommended. Conducting tests with individual chemicals is not representative of a realistic aquatic environment. Analysis of one isolated chemicals is an important start to toxicity experiments to identify basic observations on an organism' s response to stressed conditions. Performing the bioassays presented in this study using multiple chemicals at once, assessing the synergistic effects of multiple contaminants, would give insight to realistic scenarios in the field.

Monitoring the behaviours of living organisms delivers a realistic rapid assessment of unsuitable aquatic conditions and can provide the necessary information to reduce risk to end users. The development of this system will directly ameliorate the current methods used to test drinking water sources, providing awareness of unfit resources. This low-cost, real-time, holistic, biological early-warning system could benefit developing countries, where contaminated drinking water is of high concern. Also, this system could easily be used to assess industrial effluents from sewage treatment plants, oil sands refineries and runoff from agricultural lands.
