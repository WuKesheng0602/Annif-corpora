ABSTRACT

Serra Erdetn Master of Arts, Photographic Preservation and Collections Managetnent Ryerson University, Art Gallery of Ontario and George Eastn1an House
2009

This thesis focuses on Views of Egypt, an albwn housed in the Art Gallery of Ontario, that contains forty-six albumen prints of which twenty-seven are tnade by two Greek brothers: Georgios (ca.l845-ca.l895) and Constantinos (ca.l845-l916) Zangaki. The Zangaki brothers worked as comn1ercial photographers in the late nineteenth century in the Levant. Considering the extensive nutnber of prints by the Zangaki brothers in various institutions worldwide, they n1ust have been successful; yet neither they nor their photographs are well known. Views of Egypt is part of a larger enterprise: late nineteenthcentwy photography in Egypt that aitned at supplying Oriental scenes and picturesque views to the Westen1 tourist. The Zangaki brothers' photographs are representative of this period and merit closer exatnination. Furthern1ore, as it is itnportant to preserve such examples, the last part of the thesis considers the preservation of both the albutn and the photographs it contains.

INTRODUCTION This thesis focuses on Views of Egypt, an album housed in the Art Gallery of Ontario, that contains forty-six albun1en prints of which twenty-seven are made by two Greek brothers: Georgios ( ca.1845-ca.1895) and Constantinos (ca.l845-1916) Zangaki. 1 The Zangakis worked as commercial photographers in the late nineteenth century in the Levant. Considering the extensive nun1ber of prints by the Zangaki brothers in various institutions worldwide, they tnust have been successful; yet neither they nor their photographs are well known. By exatnining Views of Egypt, this thesis aims to further our understanding of the Zangaki brothers, of how they worked and with whon1 they were associated, in particular the photographers P. Peridis and Georgiladakis whose first nan1e is unknown. It also considers the context of the late nineteenth-century con1n1ercial photography in Egypt that aitned at supplying Oriental scenes and picturesque views to the Western tourist. In the nineteenth century, an era of western industrialization and technical developtnent, there was an increasing interest in the Orient by the West. Arguably, this curiosity was both a desire to escape from the reality of daily life in Europe and an outcome of colonization. Writers and painters introduced the Orient to the Occident as a primitive and uncultured civilization. They created fabricated views by depicting the Orient as an in1agined culture. The Industrial Revolution saw the rise of a tniddle class in Europe who had the means and leisure tin1e to travel. The tourist industry was growing, and, with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt becan1e a desirable destination for many travelers and

tourists from Europe and America who were on their way to the Far East and India. Tourism also stin1ulated the photography n1arket in Egypt, and photographers from different areas of the world came to establish photography businesses in Cairo and Port Said. Using established Western romantic notions of depicting the Orient, photographers in Egypt ain1ed at supplying Oriental scenes and picturesque views to the Westen1 tourist. Thousands of albumen prints were produced in this period depicting a rotnantic and eroticized version of Egypt. Tourists were able to choose prints by different photographers and were offered an assorttnent of albums also by the photographers into which the photographs could be n1ounted. These albmns would be sold to tourists as souvenirs of their travels in Egypt. The tourists could also take the prints hon1e rolled up and buy their own albun1. Albutnen prints started to fade fron1 the n1arket with the invention of the Kodak camera by George Easttnan in 1888. There was no need for tourists to buy comn1ercial photographs as they could take their own photographs and keep thetn as their souvenirs. In 1894, the postal regulations were changed to allow the mailing of pictures on postcards. This created a new comtnercial field in the photography industry, and photographers were able to print their negatives on photographic paper or get their negatives printed on postcard stock in factories to sell to the tourists. The tourists were already fan1iliar with the established Oriental scenes and picturesque views; this, therefore, led to a boon1 in interest and n1illions of postcards were printed. In order to explore the Zangakis in context, the first section of this thesis, entitled "Photography in Egypt," will explore photography in Egypt fron1 1839 to the 1920s, including a brief history of Egypt in the nineteenth century, establishment of the Oriental

2

genre, the history of tourism in the nineteenth century and, lastly, the photography processes used during this period. Following, "The Zangaki Brothers" will provide a biography of the Zangaki brothers, den1onstrating that the available sources show that they are representative of their period, and, therefore, that further investigation into their biographies will add to our understanding of conunercial photography in late nineteenthcentury Egypt. There are cotnponents of the Zangakis' lives and practices that have not been researched thoroughly and that would add to our understanding of their period. My research will address these gaps, starting with an examination of the Views of Egypt albutn and cataloguing the photographs contained within (Appendix B). Following, in the "Construction of the Negative List" my focus will shift to the creation of the Zangakis' negative list, cotnparing Zangakis' prints from various institutions across the world. With their body of work partially collected, a close-exatnination of their photographs in the "Subjects" can tell us, in general, about the wide range of subjects one cmnpany would cover during this time, while revealing specific aspects about the Zangakis' practices, such as the props and the backgrounds they used repetitively and their inclusion of one of the brothers and their portable darkroon1 in their photographs. The section "Postcards," includes the postcards that I have fotmd to illustrate the Zangakis' transition from albutnen prints to postcards. The act of culling and cataloguing the Zangakis' prints both sheds light on the history of this period and the brothers' biography and work. As it is itnportant to keep these photographs in good condition for further study and exhibition, the Views of Egypt album and its photographs should be preserved. The last part of this thesis, "Preservation

3

of Views of Egypt," examines the condition of the album and the photographs contained within. It includes the alternative housing solutions proposed, the decision made, and the steps ultin1ately undertaken in reconstituting the albmn for archival preservation.

LITERATURE SURVEY This literature survey is divided into three parts: first, books and exhibition catalogues that provide infonnation (biographical and photography related) on the Zangaki brothers, Peridis and Georgiladakis; second, books that treat photography in Egypt in general; and, third, Egyptian guidebooks and directories. The earliest infom1ation on the Zangaki brothers is found in one book and two exhibitions catalogues on Middle East photography. Adam D. Weinberg mentions the Zangakis in his 1971 exhibition catalogue Majestic Inspirations, Incomparable Souvenirs: 19th Century

Photographs of the Mediterranean and the

~lvfiddle

East, which includes an introduction

to photography in the Middle East and short biographies of photographers who were included in the exhibition. Weinberg includes other historians' cotntnents on the confusion about whether the brothers' fan1ily natne is Langaki or Zangaki. Clearly, in

1971, historians were not sure about the origins of the Zangakis and did not know that the
Zangakis were actually two brothers. Weinberg writes, "In any case, the n1ystery regarding his natne and place of origin is indicative of how little we know about hitn." 2 About the photographs, Weinberg writes, "The works themselves exhibit a taste for simple composition with extren1e care in the placetnent of figures. " 3 The Zangaki image entitled Le Sphynx et Pyramide was also the cover photograph of the catalogue. Paul E. Chevedden's 1977 The Photographic Heritage of the Middle East: An

Exhibition of Early Photographs of Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Greece, & Iran, 1849-1893 includes an overview of the beginning and developtnent of the history of
photography in general. Like Weinberg, he includes biographical infonnation on Middle

Eastern photographers, including the Zangaki brothers. Chevedden' s words on the zangakis are brief He too refers to the brothers as a single photographer, "G. Zangaki, a photographer probably of Greek origin, established a studio in Port Said at the entrance of the Suez Canal and produced a substantial volun1e of photographs throughout the 1870s and the 1880s."
4

Focus East: Early Photography in the Near East (1839-1885) by Nissan Perez (1981) is a significant source for the history of photography in the Near East. Perez's publication is divided into two parts: first, the history of photography in the Near East including exan1ples of photographs with standard subjects, and, second, biographies of photographers in alphabetical order who worked in the Near East. He gives each photographer's geographical origin, birth and death dates, active dates and mediutn. Perez is the first to understand that there are two photographers by the Zangaki surname and that they are brothers. He claitns that one brother was the actual photographer and the second a technician. He includes the Zangakis as "C. & G. Zangaki Brothers, Greek, dates unknown. Active 1870s. Collodion." 5 Perez ' s work has both positive and negative aspects. Overall, his description is the 1nost thorough. He writes that there are a very large nun1ber of Zangaki prints in almost every late travel album of the Near East but that there has been no biographical infonnation on the Zangakis. In his description, he also points out the inscription Adelphoi Zangaki on their portable darkroom and that one of the Zangakis is included in their Le Sphynx et Pyramide. But he also states "Their work does not go beyond average cotnmercial photography meant for the tourist and the occasional

visitor. It is difficult to find innovative vision or ground-breaking achievetnent in the mass of itnages they 1nust have produced." However, by his own admission, he had not thoroughly researched the Zangaki brothers' i1nages. Perez' s publication is the first one to give brief biographical and photography related information for both Peridis and Georgiladakis. For both photographers, Perez includes the san1e label, "Greek, dates unknown. Active late 1870s. Collodion. " 8 As they were both Greeks and worked in the same period as the Zangakis, Perez seen1s to suggest that these four photographers were somehow associated with each other. Perez also writes that son1e of Peridis ' photographs bear the natne of Peridis & Co. He explains that Peridis was in a partnership with another Greek, Georgiladakis, and that their photography occasionally appears in albums of the late 1870s and 1880s. This inforn1ation is then repeated in the section on Georgiladakis. Three tnore recent resources provide information on the Zangaki brothers, Peridis and Georgiladakis. Colin Osn1an ' s 1997 Egypt: Caught in Time is dedicated to photography in Egypt. This publication is significant because it presents many unpublished nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century photographs by neglected photographers. Unlike the other works, Osman describes the transition frmn the printing of 8 by 10 inch albumen prints to the production of picture postcards. Osman also includes biographical information on the Zangaki brothers, Peridis and Georgiladakis. He states that the Zangakis were either Cretan or Cypriot since their title, Adelphoi Zangah:i, suggests they can1e either fron1 Crete or Cyprus where the suffix "aki" is tnore con1mon." 9 Os1nan discovered the Zangakis ' signatures on various 1nediun1s from

10

He also states, "Zangaki brothers were noted not only for their
11

views but for depicting native life ... "

He includes nun1erous Zangaki photographs to

illustrate his sections: "The Middle East Entrepreneurs," "Life in the Countryside," "Life in the Towns" and "End of an Era." In his "Life in the Towns" section, he describes the Zangakis' use of backdrops as well as their photographic activities. Osn1an includes Peridis as "Peredis, active 1890s (Greek?)" 12 and states that Peridis was in partnership with Georgiladakis. He assu1nes that the Zangakis sold their negatives to Peridis because, as he clai1ns, so1ne of Peri dis ' images are identical to those of the Zangakis, " ... for exan1ple Peridis no.5 is the san1e as a Zangaki no.15." 13 He finds a connection between the si1nilarities of Peridis' studio backgrounds and those used by the Zangakis, where Peridis n1ay have been the assistant. Ostnan refers to Georgiladakis as "Georgiladakis, active 1880s - 90s (Greek?)" 14 and adds that he was in partnership with Peridis and possibly an assistant to Hippolyte Amoux (French, active ca.1860-l900) for an indefinite period of time. As Georgiladakis' work shows similarities with Arnoux's, Osman suggests that the two assistants joined forces when their principals 1noved on. 15 Osn1an inspired 1ne to look at postcards from Peridis and from other

photography finns to discover if any of these images were identical to those of the Zangakis. Ken Jacobson's 2007 Odalisques & Arabesques: Orientalist Photography 18391925 has been another key source. Eleven chapters explain the developn1ent of the

Orientalist history of photography. The rest of the book includes a variety of high quality reproductions (a few Zangaki photographs) and biographies of the photographers. For each photographer's biography, Jacobson lists where he found the infonnation whether from historians or travel guides or administrative and com1nerce directories. Jacobson includes detailed biographical descriptions of the Zangakis and Peri dis. He includes the Zangakis as "Zangaki Brothers: Georges Zangaki (active 1880s-1890s) and Constantin Zangaki (active 1880s-1915)." 16 He also writes the nan1es of the Zangakis' business addresses in Cairo and Port Said. He includes the Le Sphynx et
Pyramide
17

and a close-up image of the portable darkroom included in the Zangakis'

image. Jacobson includes Peridis as "P. Peri dis (active c.l890s -1905). " 18 He also writes, "Considering the further co1nplication that certain extant prints are signed by Zangaki and Arnoux, it seen1s certain that Greek ex-patriot photographers had a strong influence on the entire Port Said photography scene." 19 He includes Georgiladakis under Peridis' biographical description: "Peri dis' nan1e was signed either with his last nan1e or, on occasion, with the na1ne of a sometin1e collaborator, Georgiladakis."20 In order to find

more information on the Zangaki brothers, I wrote to Jacobson, and he referred me to Alkis X. Xanthakis.
21

The ensuing phone conversation with Xanthakis gave 1ne a different perspective on the Zangakis, Peridis and Georgiladakis. 22 Xanthakis wrote the comprehensive Hist01y

of Greek Photography 1839-1970, first edition in 1988 (in Greek and English) and the
second in 2008 (in Greek). He has also written various articles on Greek photographers. Xanthakis provided me with valuable infom1ation about the Zangaki brothers, Peridis and Georgiladakis over the phone. He told me that he had obtained the information about the Zangakis fron1 the grandson of Constantinos Zangaki (the younger of the Zangakis). Later, I contacted the Benati Museun1 in Athens for photocopies of Xanthakis' article on the Zangakis, and also for the chapter on them from the second edition of Xanthakis'

History of Greek Photography 1839-1970. I had both of these publications translated, and
they form the n1ain source of the Zangakis' biography section. 23 Deborah Bull and Donald Lorimer's 1979 Up the Nile: A Photographic

Excursion, Egypt 1839-1898 has a very thorough introduction to the develop1nent of
Egyptian photography and divides the country for these purposes into Cairo, Up the Nile, Thebes, Abu Simbel, etc. Each section describes the location and the photographs taken there. This increased n1y understanding of where Egypt-based photographers traveled to take photographs of Egypt.

Egypt is 1nostly in French but also includes English sections. One English section,
divided according to geographic locations in Egypt, including Alexandria to Men1phis, As wan, Suez and Edfu, contains a history of each and descriptions of photographs taken during different tin1e periods and of the archeological changes that had taken place in those locations. Finally, two travel guidebooks and three aruninistrative and COlnlnerce directories frmn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were helpful for understanding the period in Egypt and when and where photographers were active. The German publisher, Karl ' s Baedeker' s Egypt: Handbooks for Travellers (1878 , 1889, 1898, 1914) and the British publisher, John Murray and Son's A Handbook for Travellers in Lower and Upper

Egypt (1888, 1891) were additional resources for this thesis in understanding the kind of
information travelers were provided with. These guidebooks were divided by cities, including Cairo, Port Said, Alexandria, etc. They contained recmnmendations regarding what to see in Egypt, where to stay, where to eat, how to interact with the inhabitants, etc. The descriptions also indicated where to buy photographs, and which photographers had

11

photography businesses. I tried to exan1ine as n1any travel guidebooks as I could find in order to trace if the Zangakis were also included in then1. Ken Jacobson sourced the following ad1ninistrative and comn1erce directories in his sections on the Zangakis and Peridis: Bottin

PHOTOGRAPHY IN EGYPT (1839- 1920s) Egypt had been drawing Westerners long before the invention of photography. Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798 and wrested control from the Ma1nluks, who had ruled Egypt in the nan1e of the Ottoman En1pire since the thirteenth century. This was done for his Egyptian campaign (1798 -1801 ), to protect French trade interests and undermine Britain's access to India. Soon after, in 1801, Napoleon's authority was forced out by the joint forces of Britain and the Ottoman En1pire. In the nineteenth century, both the British and the French expanded colonization to the countries or regions in Southwest Asia and parts of North Africa (including Egypt). These expansions resulted in Westerners desiring to better understand this region. Since the fourteenth century this area was called "Orient" to distinguish these regions fro1n the "Occident." The tern1s Orient and Occident both derived fron1 the Latin roots for the words "East" and "West." 25 During his Egyptian can1paign, Napoleon was precise 1n documenting his eastward expansion, bringing a team of astronmners, chen1ists, artists and engineers with him. Their findings were published in the massive Description de I'"Egypte (1809-1813) , which beca1ne the most complete documentation of Egypt to have appeared in the West. 26 Travelers, archeologists, painters and writers beca1ne eager to see Egypt after reading the
Description. As Nissan Perez writes, the Industrial Revolution in Europe caused an

anxiety for the aristocracy and upper classes. He concludes, "The need to escape from the pressures of daily reality, to seek refuge in new and different vistas and interests was a n1ajor reason for the 1nassive flow to the East that continued to grow frmn year to

year." 27 . Ideas about the orient influenced aln1ost all creative areas in Europe, n1ainly in literature and painting. Painters, Eugene Delacroix, Jean-Leon Ger6tne and Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres depicted the Islan1ic culture. In their paintings, they stressed idleness and visual spectacle. Victor Hugo's poen1s Les Orientales (1829), Gerard de Nerval's Voyage en Orient (1884) and Gustave Flaubert' s Salammb6 (1862) portray the people and the landscape as exotic and romantic to fulfill these writers' fantasies. Jacobson includes Gustave Flaubert' s letter to Dr. Jules Cloquet written in 1850 after his arrival in Egypt explaining his feelings: " .. .It is like being hurled while asleep into the tnidst of a Beethoven syn1phony, with the brasses run1bling, and the flutes sighing away ... But the first days, by God, it is such a bewildering chaos of colours that your poor itnagination is dazzled as though by continuous fireworks as you go about staring at minarets thick with white storks, as tired slaves of sycan1ore branches against walls, with can1el bells ringing in your ears and great herds of black goats and the peddlars. You brush against all the costmnes of the Orient. .. , the Copt in his black turban, the Persian in his fur pelisse, the desert Bedouin with this coffee-coloured face walking gravely along enveloped in his white robes. " 28 In 1978, Edward Said redefined our understanding of this kind of romanticism in his book Orienta/ism , in which he examined the Western activity during this period and saw it as a part of the Westen1 plan of dominating the East. A new discipline, "Orientalistn" was bon1, and Said describes the tern1 " ... as a Western style for dotninating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient. "

colonialist theorists nan1ed the nineteenth-century writers and painters "Orientalists," and

claimed that these writers and painters considered themselves superior to the people who were living in the Orient. They argued that the Orientalist writers and painters constructed fantasies of the Orient instead of trying to understand the culture. As Perez states, "Orientalisn1 became the study of ' inferior' cultures and races." 30 Perez uses the example of the French poet Gerard de Nerval ' s portrayal of the Orient. He writes: "Nerval recognized the Orient as a place of drean1s and illusions and sensed in Cairo the presence of rich female sexuality. Regarding his liaison with Zaynab, the slave he claitned to have bought in Egypt and the heroine of his Voyage en Orient, Nerval expressed the need to "unite with this guileless young girl who is of this sacred soil, which is our first hmneland," and to bathe hin1self "in the vivifying springs of hutnanity, from which poetry and the faith of our fathers flowed forth. "3 1 Here, we see Nerval's idealizing of the culture by his portrayal of Eastern women as sitnultaneously innocent and sensual. Although post-colonial criticis1n has critiqued, con1plicated and built upon Said' s work, his theories continue to be influential when examining literature and art that romanticized the East. The Industrial Revolution in Europe resulted in social and econmnic changes that transformed society frotn a rural to an urbanized one. With the rising tniddle class's increased ability to travel, the modern concept of tourism came into being. After the mid 1850s, as traveling to the Orient grew more popular, organized groups and packaged tours becan1e available. Thmnas Cook was one of the first to open up organized tours to the Orient to the 1nen1bers of the middle class. Cook was a British founder of the travel agency that is now Thomas Cook Group and is referred to as the father of tourism. His

cheap overseas tours n1ade it possible for n1en and women, to go abroad easily. He introduced pre-paid inclusive tours, hotel coupons, travellers cheques, the ' round the world' trip and the first travel newspaper. 32 With these organized tours, the n1iddle class started to travel to the san1e exotic locales to experience the exotic dreams of the Orient they had been reading about. Since the Middle Ages, Egypt had been an in1portant historical and archaeological location. The opening of the Suez Canal made it a major tourist destination. Opened in Novetnber of 1869, the Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea that allows water transportation between Europe and Asia without navigating around Africa. Foil owing its construction, Alexandria and Port Said in Egypt on the shores of Mediterranean Sea becan1e two n1ajor trade centers. Ships carrying tourists who were in the organized packaged tours and were traveling to India and the Far East fron1 Europe docked in Port Said for coaling. This process took a day or two, and western tourists avoided the delay by taking a train frmn Port Said to Cairo and rejoining the ship in Suez.

Arago' s 183 9 presentation of the Daguerreotype process, he

Arago ' s claitn was fulfilled first with daguerreotypes and later with calotypes of Egyptian antiquities, and these becatne the first photographic documents of Egyptian sites.

Yet photographers in Egypt were not only interested in documentation; Entrepreneurs capitalized on the new technology and the rising tourist industry and began to sell their photographs to tourists. The route through the Suez Canal created a new stopover in Egypt: Port Said. Photographers fron1 different areas of the world came to Port Said to establish photography businesses whose n1ain customers were Western tourists. Dean MacCannell defines a tourist attraction " ... as an empirical relationship between a tourist, a sight and a marker." 33 Egypt's attraction was both as a part of the Orient (or exotic locale) and being the location of the pyra1nids and the Sphinx. MacCannell 's definition of a tourist attraction includes a marker - a physical piece of information about a sight. The sight was Egypt and its 1narker was a souvenir, in this case, souvenir photographs depicting the Oriental the1nes in literature and painting that portrayed Egypt as an in1agined culture. Photographs, with their documentary approach and wide accessibility, beca1ne the means of n1arketing the Orient to the West. They were the visual sy1nbols of the exotic drean1 and the evidence of the tourist's existence in this exotic locale. The photographs that the tourists purchased in this period were affordable albumen prints made from wet collodion negatives. Baedeker's guidebook, Egypt.

Handbook for Travellers (1878), provides specific shops for tourist photographs,
including: Kauffmann in the Muski, Monferrato (formerly Robertson), adjoining

Shepheard's hotel and Ebener, opposite to Hotel d'Orient. 34 These prints were not only
sold in photography studios, but also in hotels and booksellers' shops. In fact, the shops

around the Ezbekieh Square in the European quarter, where the fa1nous Shepheard's Hotel was situated, were usually filled with tourists purchasing albumen prints. In these locations, tourists were able to choose albumen prints fron1 different photographers, and these photographs were later 1nounted in albun1s. The tourists bought these albums as souvenirs for their travels in Egypt, "souvenir" referring to a relic of a trip. They also brought home unmow1ted prints and would so1neti1nes personalize the albu1ns and photographs with notes. Photographers in Port Said and Cairo not only had portrait studios in those cities, they also traveled along the Nile to Upper Egypt to photograph Egyptian antiquities and the countryside. Son1e had floating darkrooms on the Nile, or portable darkroo1ns to carry and develop their negatives. They portrayed Egypt in studio portraits, n1ostly of won1en, including Oriental props (water pipe, water carrier, tainbourine) ; constructed daily-life street scenes (showing the Oriental professions of the street); picturesque views (pahn trees and the Nile River); and Egyptian 1nonuments and sites. The photographs of Egyptian sites included inhabitants and represented the1n in their native costu1nes. As we know fron1 different photographers' signatures on the san1e print, associations a1nong these Egypt-based photographers were c01nmon. They exchanged and sold each others' negatives because they were able to 1nake more money selling the n1ost popular images to tourists.

PROCESS The prints the tourists bought were albumen, 1nade from both full-plate (8 by 10 inches, 22 by 28 centimeters) wet plate glass negatives and gelatin dry plate negatives.

Frederick Scott Archer published a detailed description of wet collodion process on glass in the March 1851 issue of The Chemist. Archer' s formula for making wet collodion was a preparation using potassiun1 iodide and adding it to a diluted solution of collodion. The glass plate was then coated with this collodion and put into a solution of silver nitrate for a layer of silver iodide to appear just under the surface of the collodion. The sensitized plate was then exposed while still wet, developed with pyrogallic acid, and then fixed in sodiu1n thiosulfate. 35 The wet plate allowed the photographers to have "sharper negatives and n1ore detailed positive prints than those created through the paper negative processes,"36 and they were able to print multiple prints on salted and albutnen paper. Photographers used the wet collodion process frotn 1851 to ca.1885 _ :n There is not tnuch information found on when Egypt-based photographers stopped using collodion and shifted to gelatin dry plate negatives. For the wet place process, albmnen paper (often gold-toned) was the most con1ll1on print m1til about 1895. Albutnen was prepared in France and Germany near the paper tnills to produce the highest quality of paper. For exatnple, son1e of the Zangakis ' prints have the watermark, BFK Rives No 74. This is inscribed at the bottmn of the prints, mostly on the edge. BFK Rives was a French brand of albun1enized paper for photographic printing. The equipment for wet collodion process was bulky and the plates were fragile. After the exposure, the wet negative plate had to be developed right away. In the desert heat of Egypt the collodion dried rapidly. Thus, n1any photographers had to build

portable darkrooms to develop their negatives. Francis Frith ( 1822-1898), a well-known British photographer who worked in the Near East in the 1850s, wrote of his troubles working among ether fmnes in an airless tent in 130 degrees Fahrenheit heat He was an1azed by his own success; "Now in a sn1othering little tent, with tny collodion fizzingboiling up all over the glass the instant that it touched -and, again, pushing tny way backwards, upon tny hands and knees, into a damp, slimy rock tomb to n1anipulate - it is truly tnarvelous that the results should be presentable at alL" 38 Another issue posed by the cmnbersome darkroom used by the photographers was the question of transport frotn location to another. The darkroom had to be transported along the Nile on a Dahabeah, 39 a passenger boat commonly used on the river. Murray includes an explanation of the role of the Dahabeah in his section Railways - Modes of
Travelling, "The great highway of Egypt, especially above Cairo, is the Nile, and sailing

or floating along it in a Dahabeeyeh is still, railways and sterunboats notwithstanding, the
. t1 p1 easantest way o f seemg 1e com1try. ,40

The replace1nent of collodion with a gelatin binder was a significant itmovation. The first dry plates were invented in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox (1816-1902) and were in general use fro1n ca.l878 to ca.1925. 41 Valverde writes, "Gelatin, a protein product, is tnanufactured by the partial hydrolysis of collagen found in connective tissues and skin of anin1als. This protein provides a viscous 1nediun1 to suspend the lightsensitive silver salts and forn1 an en1ulsion with then1." 42 The photographic etnulsion already contained the light-sensitive silver salts suspended in the gelatin dry plate

negative, thus there was no need to have separate solutions of these salts before the exposure. Gelatin dry plate negatives were printed on albwnen, which was slowly replaced by pre-sensitized collodion and gelatin printing out papers. With the gelatin binder, photographers were able to have ready-to-use light-sensitive plates and the exposure times were less than a second. They were able to freeze tnotion in their photographs. Valverde explains the benefits of the light-sensitive plates, saying, "Their long shelf life and the possibility of developing the itnage tnuch later owing to the hygroscopic characteristics (drawing moisture frotn air) of gelatin freed photographers frotn the need to carry a portable darkroom into the field. " 43 Egypt-based photographers were producing large quantities of detnanding collodion glass plate negatives, thus they assumedly moved to use gelatin dry plate negatives as soon dry plates becatne available in Egypt. Baedeker' s Egypt. Handbook for Travellers (1914) provides specific recon1mendations on where to purchase dry plates in Cairo under the Photographic Materials section, including: "Heyman & Co., agent for the Eastn1an Kodak Co.; filn1s supplied and plates developed. " 44 Wet collodion negatives were replaced by dry plates, and later albun1en prints started to disappear frotn the market. After the invention of Kodak camera by George Easttnan in 1888, there was no need for tourists to buy con1mercial photographs since an1ateur photographers could take their own photographs and kept then1 as their souvenirs. In 1894, the postal regulations were changed to allow the mailing of pictures on postcards. Picture postcards were mostly printed frotn existing late nineteenth-century

wet collodion or gelatin dry plate negatives. The tourists were already familiar with existing ron1antic notions of the Orient and in1mediately adapted to purchasing picture postcards of them. This led to a boon1 in interest and n1illions of postcards were printed. Tourists bought postcards "To get a rise out of the people at hmne - to shock then1, to temp then1, one-up thetn. To deceive some people, to tnake them envious. To confirm their stereotype of the Other, to emphasize their journey ... " 45 Postcards were (and still are) inexpensive, accessible and they require little effort on the part of the tourist.

Adding Text to Negatives Photographers working in the nineteenth-century in Egypt added text to their negatives for printing. They inscribed their nan1es, negative nun1bers and titles of the location/subject. This most likely 1nade it easier for the owner of the bookseller or the hotel store to locate a specific photographer's print from thousands of albmnen prints to sell. Each photographer had an individual nutnbering system for his negatives. This was in1portant for hin1 to keep track of his negatives and made it easy to locate a negative of a print that a tourist ordered. The title of the location! subject was inscribed to identify the na1ne of the location or the ethnicity of the figure in the image. Mark Ostern1an, the Process Historian of the George Eastman House, described how photographers added text to their negatives for subsequent printing. Ostennan explained that he knew of photographers adding text in three ways. The first way is sin1ply scratching the name or location with a sharp metal point on the binder layer of the negative, which would require writing backwards. This side would face the paper during

printing and it would print as black. The second way would be to write backwards on the binder layer of the negative with India ink. This would print as white on the paper. The third technique was to use a letterpress and type to print the words on a very thin slip of translucent onion skin paper (very fine cotton paper). This then would be applied to the binder side of the negative with gum solution and would print as white. In this case, there will be a trace of the onion skin paper on the print. 46

Postcard Production Following the postal regulations change in 1894 that allowed the n1ailing of pictures on postcards, there were two 1najor types of picture postcards: real photo (RPPC) and printed. The first n1ajor type, RPPCs were true photographs printed by a photographer fron1 a negative chetnically on the photographic paper with postcard backs. The second type, printed view cards (only photographs, not artist drawings), were made in two ways: "Local merchants or photographers could bring or send photos to a printing firm or jobber (finns that took orders but sent the printing or to n1anufacturers, tnany of whom were abroad) and order printed postcards 1nade fr01n them. The other, n1ore cointnon, approach was for a company to send an agent to take photographs of the local sight. While in a town the employee would take orders fron1 local merchants or make contacts to send srunples. The photographs would be brought back to the c01npany, selected, made into plates or screens, printed, and then sold to the local store owners.',4 7 With the arrival of PZ (Photoglob Zurich) print, a type of colour printing, the product becrune more polished. The process was called Photochromy and was developed

" 49 Photographs seen in the late nineteenth-century as albmnen prints printed by Egypt-based photographers were later printed as postcards by printing firn1s such as Vegnios & Zachos, Ephti1nios Freres, Edit - The Cairo Postcard Trust and Comptoir Philatelique d'Egypte, Alexandrie. 50

THEZANGAKIBROTHERS The Zangakis were atnong the cmnmercial photographers who worked in the late nineteenth century in Egypt. There are at least one thousand five hundred prints in collections today that I know of which shows that they were prolific and successful photographers. It seems like every photography collection worldwide contains at least one Zangaki print, however, neither their biographies nor their photography is well known. The little we do know shows us that their careers touched on all the aspects of the history of the industry presented above. Apart from the sources in the literature survey above, the inforn1ation I obtained fron1 Xanthakis made a difference in what I knew about the Zangakis. According to Xanthakis, the two brothers, Georgios (George) and Constantinos (Constantine), were born around 1845 on the island Milos. As Xanthakis explains: "Their family had kinship ties to Heraklion of Crete, where Constantinos went for a while. 5 1 He later married Eleni Koutsoudaki, from Adatnanta of Milos, a tall and beautiful wotnan who was called "goddess" by many because she looked like the statue of Aphrodite found in Milos (con1n1only known as the Venus de Milo)." 52 The older brother, Georgios Zangaki, went to Egypt first around 1865 and settled in Port Said. Soon his younger brother, Constantinos, followed hin1. The beginning of the Zangakis' career in photography coincides with the rise of tourism in Egypt. In fact, their earliest photographs show that they were involved with photographing the opening of Suez Canal in 1869. As mentioned above, the inauguration of the Suez Canal was a key tnoment in the history of tourism, opening Europe to Far East and India. The Zangakis
Xanthak:is has not included how long Constantinos Zangak:i went to Crete for. Xanthak:is, "Zangak:i Brothers: Two Creative Greek Photographers in Egypt," (Unpublished translation by Myrto Koumarianos, Athens, Forografos vol.l41 , 2005), 62.

were among the photographers who recognized the importance of the Suez Canal and capitalized on this key moment in history. Around 1870, the Zangakis opened a photography studio in Port Said. 53 Typically, they sold photographs to Western tourists. They drew on the recognized genre of Orientalist scenes fron1 earlier literature and paintings, and with their contemporaries, constructed Orientalist scenes in an effort to cater to tourists' perceptions of the region. They constructed outdoor scenes depicting the Oriental life style. Their extensive output during this time shows us that they were able to deliver exactly what the Western tourist wanted. The Zangakis' traveled up the Nile to photograph the n1onuments at Luxor, Abu Simbel, Karnak, and other areas in Egypt. They recognized that the Western tourists were looking for photographs of Egyptian antiquities to use as souvenirs to map their route in Egypt. The Zangakis were also fan1iliar with ron1antic notions of portraying the Nile and the pahn trees. They continued to be industrious photographers, delivering hundreds of photographs frmn these locations. They also photographed the indigenous people living in these areas, as it seen1s that they were familiar with the Western tourists' perception that the indigenous peoples from the countryside were n1ore exotic than the Egyptian peasants fron1 the more populated areas. Around 1880, the Zangakis also traveled to Palestine and the Holy Land.54 As Greek Orthodox the1nselves, the Zangakis recognized this as an opportunity to see the Holy Land and also to sell their photographs to the tourists.

26

When Cairo becatne a popular city for European tourists, becotning another stop over for tourists traveling to Far East and India, the Zangakis saw this as a business opportunity. Around 1895, they opened a photography studio in Cairo. In his article, Xanthakis includes a document, most likely the back of a Zangaki carte-de-visite or cabinet card,55 that shows the Zangakis' name, Zangaki Freres Photographes, and both of their studios, "Port -Said & Caire Egypte." The Zangakis' process was typical of their period. They were using wet collodion negatives on albumen paper since all their prints in the collections today are albumen prints. Their prints' sizes are typically 8 by 10 inches (22 by 28 cn1.), which shows that they used full-plate wet collodion negatives. After the invention of the gelatin dry plates, the Zangakis switched to using thetn as everyone else did. Soon after the opening of their studio in Cairo, Georgios died, and Constantinos closed the studio in Port Said. After Georgios ' death, according to Xanthakis, Constantinos sold a large part of the Zangakis' negatives to Peridis and Amoux. Photographers sold and exchanged negatives; this may be the reason we encounter Peri dis' and Arnoux' s signatures on son1e of the Zangakis' negatives. Constantinos Zangaki was aware of the change in the photography industry, and he became active in the business, producing Zangaki postcards until his death in 1916.
EgyptDirectory shows that Constantinos had an active studio in two different locations in

Cairo frotn the 1910s until 1916. The EgyptDirectory of 1912, 1914, and 1915 included "Constantinos (C.) Zangaki" as having a studio in Cairo at C; Ch.el-Mahdi. However, the
EgyptDirectmy of 1916 and 1917 included as "Zangaki C. Co.," at Ch. El-Guinenah.

Thus, the title Constantinos Zangah-7, illustrating an individual, was changed to

Xanthakis "Zangaki Brothers," 62. Xanthakis did not include what kind of a document this was.

Constantinos Cooperation , illustrating a firm. Some of the postcards that Constantinos produced were later copied by Comptoir Philatelique d'Egypte, Alexandrie and by G. Lekegian ( ca.188 7-1925, an Armenian photographer) in Cairo. 56 The Zangakis' i1nages also can be found as postcards today under different photography finns' na1nes. Their postcards are representative of the change during this period and are fine exrunples of the transition fron1 albmnen prints to postcards. Constantinos Zangaki died in 1916 in Cairo and was buried in a family tmnb, possibly in the Greek Orthodox ce1netery in Cairo. With his death, the studio was closed, and the negatives were scattered or destroyed . As Xanthakis explains, the Zangakis re1nained unknown in Greece because they did not take part in exhibitions, like 1nany of their Greek colleagues who lived in Egypt. As n1entioned above, the Zangakis had both an indoor and an outdoor studio. Jacobson pointed out three administrative and cotntnerce directories in his Odalisques & Arabesques for the Zangakis, the Bottin annual 57, EgyptDirectory and JndicatEgypt. I had a chance to research the Zangakis in these directories. The Bottin annual includes the Zangakis ' studio in 1886 in the Port Said section: "Photographie orientale: Zangaki Freres, vues du canal et d 'Orient" (Oriental photography: Zangaki Brothers, Views of the Canal and the Orient). This is interesting since in the Bottin 1880, Arnoux is described under Port Said as "Arnoux (H.) photographies d'Egypte et de tout !'Orient" (Arnoux
(H.) photographs of Egypt and the entire Orient). When the Zangakis were included in

the section, Amoux' s title changed to "Photographie: Arnoux (H.)" (Photograph: Arnoux

(H.). This change suggests that Arnoux was no longer known as the photographer of the Orient; the Zangaki brothers beca1ne known as the photographers of the Orient. The

Bottin of 1890, 1895 and 1900 describe the studio as: "Photographie orientale: Zangaki
Freres" (Oriental Photography: The Zangaki Brothers). As Xanthakis states, Georgios died around 1895 . However, the IndicatEgypt of 1897 still included both the Zangakis in Cairo as "Zangaki Freres; Photographie Orientale," and they were located at rue de Ia

division. This reason could be that the directory did not update their studio ' s information.
Xanthakis states that Constantinos closed the studio in Port Said; however, the Bottin still included the Zangakis as '"Zangaki Freres " in 1900 as a business in Port Said. The reason could be because they were known as the Zangaki Freres, Constantinos did not want to change the na1ne of their studio.

VIEWS OF EGYPT

The AGO's Views of Egypt album contains forty-six albutnen prints depicting views of Egypt fron1 around 1865 to the 1890s. The prints are approximately 21.5 ctn by 28 em. The subjects of the photographs are hieroglyphics, studio portraits, the Nile, the Pyran1ids, life in Egypt, and Egyptian antiquities. Twenty-seven of these are by the Zangakis, ten by Peridis, three by Peridis & Georgiladakis, and six prints are without a signature. A single signed Zangaki print accompanied the album when it was acquired in 2008. It is mounted on a separate album page. This albutn is red leather-bound. There is a gold painted border around the edges and embossed detailing on the four corners of both the front and back covers of the albun1 (Fig.1). It is a thin albutn that tneasures 1.7 cn1 x 29.1 x 39.1 em. The album has fifty pages in total. It has an etnpty leaf in the front and in the back. Between these two leaves, there are forty-six pages (twenty-three attached leaves). The photographs are slotted into the four comer "pockets" on each floppy leaf of the albun1 (Fig.2). Each leaf (two attached leaves) can hold two photographs; one in the front and one in the back, and the four comers of each photo are hidden inside these two leaves. Out of the forty-six

albumen prints, forty-one of them were slotted into the leaves and five were stacked loosely at the back of the albun1. The albun1 has only one inscription on the inside of the front cover indicating "45 photos" in pencil, possibly written by the buyer of the albun1 since the markings see1n recent in their clarity and tneticulousness. We can assume that the photographs were purchased in Egypt, but the traveler n1ay have purchased the albmn shell either in Egypt or upon arrival hotne.

30

As Maia Sutnik, the Photography Curator of the AGO informed me, the additional tnounted Zangaki print Le Sphynx et Pyramide was borrowed in 1986 from an anonymous owner who gave permission to fran1e it, and exhibited at the AGO along with prints by other photographers, including Antonio Beato and San1uel Bourne. The exhibition considered the divergent approaches to exploration photography, " . . . that is the idea of the optical purity of the photographic image (topographical evidence) verses the desire of the picturesque (aesthetic fonnulation)." 58 This was a completnentary installation to "Linneaus Tripe: Photographer of British India 1864-1870," an AGO exhibition fr01n Novetnber 1, 1986 to January 11 , 1987. Views of Egypt was borrowed from the same anonyn1ous owner and included in the AGO exhibition, "Architectural Journeys: A Panoramic View " fr01n Novetnber 14, 1996 to March 2, 1997. Before the exhibition, several photographs had con1e loose frotn their corner placen1ents. There was no visual or documented record of the original order or subsequent sequencing. The owner had put then1 back in the album before the exhibition. No infom1ation is known about when exactly the owner put the stacked five prints in the back of the albun1, rather than bending and putting thetn back into their corners. Later, the albun1 and the additional Zangaki print were sold to a dealer, and the AGO acquired then1 in 2008.
59

There were several preservation problen1s with the prints. They were not glued to the album leaves; instead, they were slotted into each leaf of the albun1. After consultations with Sutnik and Katharine Whitn1an (the Conservator, Photographs at the AGO), we decided that we would remove the prints from the albun1.
60

As a result, I was

able to exatnine the full titles and the signatures that were hidden under the corners. In addition, I was able to see the versos of the prints. Following the ren1oval of the prints fron1 the Views of Egypt album, sub-numbers of 2008/121 (albun1 ' s accession nun1ber) were created from 2008/121.1 to 2008/121.47 to the forty-seven prints including the additional Le Sphynx et Pyramide. The AGO accession nutnbers follow the place1nent of the photographs in the album when the AGO received it. Subsequently, I created a catalogue of the photographs on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and it is sorted according to the order of the AGO accession numbers (Appendix B). This excel sheet can subsequently be tnodified and i1nported into the AGO collections 1nanagen1ent systetn. 6 1

61

The Catalogue will be imported upon completion of the AGO's current transition into a TMS database.

32

CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEGATIVE LIST While cataloguing the prints from the Views of Egypt album, I was sin1ultaneously creating a list of the numbers that the Zangaki brothers assigned to their negatives. The list was expanded to include negative nmnbers found on prints fro1n different institutions
61

and created on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Appendix C). The negative

list consists of eight hundred seventy four prints found in collections. 63 Putting the Zangakis' negative numbers in ascending order allowed n1e to trace the locations the Zangakis visited, and this illustrated their route through Egypt. While creating the list, I was able to observe identical prints of the Zangakis fr01n various institutions thus revealing their 1nost popular images. Some of these duplicates had different negative nu1nbers that illustrated the Zangakis' print group production. This refers to changing the negative nun1ber for different printings of the sa1ne negative. In general, this negative list acted as a tool to further understand the content and the subjects of the Zangakis' i1nages. In this list, the smallest negative nu1nber is "1" and the biggest negative nu1nber is
"1672." Fr01n the list, we can verify that the Zangakis were based in Port Said because

the first approximately thirty negative nun1bers are on prints of Port Said. Following, they photographed Cairo until the negative numbers 500s. The list follows as, Memphis, Nubia, Thebes, Karnak, Assouan Abydos, Denderah, Thebes, Luxor, Karnak, Jerusalem, Philae, Jerusalen1, Bethlehen1 and Jaffa. Before negative nun1ber "1162," the list is

Original linages were examined from "Departement des Estampes et de la photographie in la Bibliotheque nationale de France," "Photographic and Cinema Collections in Rare Books and Special Collections Library at the American University in Cairo" and the collection of Marta Braun. The rest of the images were found online from institutions and these prints' catalogue ii1fonnation is taken from theiiÂ· existing catalogue infom1ation. 63 Aside from the list, according to Andrea Hackman, there are roughly two hundred prints at the Harvard Fine Arts Library and one hundred fifty prints at the New York Public Library.

62

33

relatively complete, but, after "1162," there is a considerable number of negative numbers n1issing up to "1672." There are no prints found for negative nun1bers in the 1200s or 1300s, only two prints in the 1400s, three prints in the 1500s and nine prints in the 1600s. The creation of this list includes several duplicates of prints fron1 vanous institutions. These duplicates bear the same negative numbers. However, there are duplicate prints of the san1e itnage but with different negative nutnbers. There are three exrunples found in the Views of Egypt album that have duplicate prints at the GEH and the Griffith Institute. First, the negative number "920" in Thebes Memorium de Ramses .. .[III] (AGO) and the negative nutnber "646" for the srune in1age (Gr. Inst.); second, the negative nun1ber "953" in Vue generalle[sic] de Louqur[sic} (AGO) and the negative nmnber "685" for the same in1age (Gr. Institute); third, the negative nmnber "1020" in Edfou Pylone du temple de Horus (AGO) and the negative number "637'' for the sa1ne itnage (GEH). This is interesting because, as n1entioned above, the Zangakis inscribed negative nun1bers on their negatives; yet there is no evidence of an earlier existing negative nun1ber on the prints. Osterman clarified this proble1n, suggesting that the ink can be made to come off. " 64 The Zangakis erased an earlier existing negative nun1ber on the negative according to print group production, which was usual practice at the time. Possibly, they printed a group in year "x," and, in year "y," they changed the negative nu1nber and printed another group. The Zangakis' negative nun1bers revealed the chronology of the locations they visited. For exan1ple, the Zangakis photographed Edfou in negative nutnber 1020s to 1030s (N. 1020 Edfou Pylone du temple de Horus, N. 1024 Edfou Interieur[sic} du

temple, N. 1025 Edfou Vue generale[sic] du temple, N. 1032 Edfou lnterieur[sic]). The Zangakis photographed Dendera in negative nu1nber 900s (N. 900 Denderah Temple Athor (AGO), N. 901 Denderah Entree d 'antinaos (AGO) and N. 902 Denderah Colonnade (UCL) and N. 906 Offrande de Ramsis Denderah (UCL). Also n1entioned above, after the death of Georgios Zangaki, Constantinos Zangaki started publishing postcards. Os1nan included a postcard65 by Constantinos Zangaki in his Egypt: Caught in Time that is included in postcard production section of this thesis (Fig.1 0).
66

This postcard in fact was made frmn an albumen print frmn the

1880s. It has an inscription on the botto1n left "C. Zangaki Photographe" and " 1542" on the bottom right. This nun1ber 1night be the sa1ne nu1nber as the albun1en print or a new nu1nber that Constantinos invented for his postcards.

NEGATIVE INSCRIPTIONS The Zangakis were consistent in adding their name, negative number and title of location or subject on their negatives. They handwrote their nan1e on their prints as Zangaki on the botto1n left (Fig. 3, 4) and wrote the negative number followed by the title of the location or subject in French on the bottom right (Fig.5). The French captions were used because French was the lingua franca language of Egypt during the nineteenth century, the second language after Arabic. These texts appear as white. Osterman examined the Zangakis ' prints at the GEH and concluded that the words were written backwards on the binder layer with India ink. The binder layer would face the paper

35

while printing and would print out as white.

67

He also explained "the script on the prints

shows a very slow hand with lots of thought. "

68

After close-examination of Peri dis' and Georgiladakis ' prints in Views of Egypt, it seetns clear that their approach to adding text to their negatives was very sitnilar to the Zangakis ' . Their handwriting is also sitnilar to those of the Zangakis. This 1nay have come about as a result of their working together and adopting each others' technique, or perhaps sin1ply because they had access to each others' work. Both Peridis' and Georgiladakis' prints include their handwritten na1nes as Peridis and Georgiladakis on the botton1 left (Fig.6) and the negative nun1ber followed by the title of the location or subject in English on the botto1n right (Fig.7). English was comn1only used in Egypt after the British occupation in 1882. This difference between the languages of the titles is a n1ethod that I have found to distinguish both Peridis' and Georgiladakis' prints frmn those of the Zangakis. As Perez, Osman and Jacobson state, Peridis and Georgiladakis were partners for a brief period. This is understood by their adjoined signatures Peridis e Georgiladakis. Peridis e Georgiladakis {. ..] Karnac (AGO) illustrates both Peri dis ' and Georgiladakis' signatures. However, Georgiladakis' signature was written afterwards, resulting in its bolder appearance than that of Peridis (Fig.8). After Peridis' and Georgiladakis' partnership ended69 , they might have divided their negatives and erased each other's names fron1 the negatives. Despite these efforts, the evidence of erasure of their fonner partners' na1nes is still visible.

SUBJECTS Putting the negative nu1nbers in consecutive order allows us to see, for the first time, the brothers' career as a whole. Besides revealing 1nore about their practice, they illustrate the wide range of subjects one con1pany might cover and increase our understanding of photographic practices during this time. Furthem1ore, we can learn 1nore about the Zangakis ' lives and n1ethods when we look at idiosyncratic practices or subjects that help identify their photographs 1nore easily. The Zangakis smnetimes included one of the brothers and their portable darkroom in their images and also used a distinct set of props and backgrounds. They created theatrical scenes constructing 'real ' Oriental scenes for the viewer. Their subjects can be divided into five sections: Oriental portraiture in their indoor studio and 'Real life' Oriental scenes in their outdoor studio; Life on the streets and in the countryside; Coverage of current events; Landscapes and cityscapes; and Docun1entation of Egyptian n1onmnents and sites. This section will also exan1ine the appearance of one of the Zangakis and their portable darkroo1n.

Oriental portraiture in their indoor studio and ' Real life ' Oriental scenes in their outdoor studio As Os1nan and Jacobson point out, the Zangakis might have been the assistants to Arnoux or worked with Amoux when they arrived in Port Said. There are many sin1ilarities between the indoor studio photographs that are known to have been taken by Amoux and the Zangakis. By looking at prints fron1 both Amoux and Zangaki, we can see that these photographs have three identical props: the same palm tree backdrop, the identical water pipe and decorative stool.

37

In their indoor studio, the Zangakis used painted backdrops (palm trees and the Pyran1id and the Sphinx) to etnphasize that their subjects are supposedly portrayed in their natural setting. They also used props that drew on cliches previously established in the genre of Orientalist painting, such as water pipes, water carriers, and tambourines. They often portrayed the women with the black burgu (face veil). This tnade the wotnen "attractive subjects" 70 for the standard tourists. The veil has been the n1ost don1inant article of clothing in Western itnages of the Middle Eastern woman. Especially for Western n1en, veiling represented sensuality. The Zangakis' [Two Middle Eastern Wom en] (AGO) is a perfect example of this use of the veil (Fig. II). The image is of two standing won1en, one with a white and one with a black burgu. The two women in the image are photographed against a white background, another example, Deux femmes arabes (UCL), is also of two won1en (both wearing black burgus) (Fig.l2). In both photographs, one of the won1en has put her hand onto the other woman ' s shoulder evoking a sensual nature. These two women look directly at the viewer confronting hitn with their gaze. This would tnake then1 seem sexually available given the tradition of in1ages of women who are objects of the tnale gaze and therefore look shyly away or down. The Zangakis' photographs are examples of the portrayal of the Eastern women to the Western tourist. Photographers in this period also posed figures outdoors creating ' real' Oriental scenes. Chicken baskets, water carriers and donkeys were used as props to portray the exotic. Yet, while other photographers I have exatnined posed their figures in several regular backgrounds, the Zangakis used a specific outdoor studio.
It included the

38

following three con1ponents: a mashrabiya (carved wood latticed window) on the left, a brick arch on the right and a twisted tree on the top right. Grahan1-Brown writes "the point of mashribiyya windows was to allow wotnen to see out without being seen from the street."
72

71

However, the Zangakis tnisrepresented the mashrabiya by including men in

the window (Femmes arabes sur Baudets (GEH), Fig.l3). The mashrabiya was seen as an exotic entity to the Western culture, and the Zangakis took advantage of this. They used this studio background for ahnost all of their outdoor photographs. When searching for a picture postcard by the Zangakis (even if it says it was published by another photography firn1 or photographer), one can distinguish the Zangakis ' images by the mashrabiya background.
Arabe prenant son caffe[sic] (AGO) is an exan1ple of a constructed daily scene

using the tnashrabiya background and various props (Fig.l4 ). It is an exan1ple of a frozen moment, including two tnen, one standing while holding a traditional coffee carrier and the other one sitting on a chicken basket while holding a traditional coffee tnug. This photograph, with many other exatnples, gives the itnpression of a theatre scene, with the background and props carefully chosen to interact with the actors of the play.

Life On the Streets and In the Cotmtryside After the documentation of Egyptian 1nonun1ents in the 1850s, photographers turned to the daily life on the streets and in the countryside. These included bazaars, small n1arkets, street scenes and courts of the Mosques. These locations were part of the fantasy of Orientalism. The Zangakis' Epicerie[sic} arabe (AGO) seems to have been a

popular choice for tourists, as there are 1nany duplicates of this in1age (Fig.l5). It depicts a local grocery store, its proprietor and two other 1nen in a well-balanced con1position. Photographs of street views of Cairo and Port Said show the boom in tourism, including tourists in their western-style suits and store signs in English and French. Rue de

co[merce a}[sic} Port Said (BNF) (Fig.l6), Rue du comerce a[sic} Port-Said (GEH)
(Fig.l7) and Rue du comerce a[sic} Port Said (GEH) (Fig.l8) are three exa1nples of the main street in Port Said. These three photographs show western-style suits with Turkish fez (a red felt hat in the shape of a truncated cone) and bowler hats on people. All signs are in English and French, illustrating Thmnas Cook' s office, a Clock 1naker, the Eastern Telegraph Office, Hotel Metropole, Egyptian Cigarettes A. Vafiadis, Deutsche Berhalle, etc. In addition to scenes frmn towns, the Egyptian countryside was also a popular subject. Western tourists were interested in different ethnic groups inhabiting Egypt; they were considered primitive and more exotic than the Egyptian locals from populated major cities. According to Osn1an, "the black Nubians and light-coloured Sudanese were generally believed to be superior to the Egyptian peasant, and were considered to be 1nore exotic, therefore of greater photographic interest." 73 Thus, photographers used then1 in their photographs extensively to sell to tourists. The Zangakis traveled to Nubia 74 to photograph the Nubians. Bull writes, "Westen1 travelers fow1d the Nubians exotic. They were dark skinned and described in conte1nporary accounts as extre1nely handsome and proud in their demeanor. The Nubians' dress was scant and, no doubt, tantalizing to the

heavily garbed Western tourists." 75 The Zangakis, being aware of the tourist' s desire, photographed the Nubians extensively. Soldat Abyssin a[sic] Dogali (AGO) illustrates a tnan seated on a can1el and brandishing his spear (Fig.l9). The Bicharins [. .. ] (BnF) illustrates Nubian tnen posing on the rocks (Fig.20). The man sitting on the middle right is most likely the satne man seated on the can1el fron1 the Soldat Abyssin a[sic] Dogali (AGO). These two photographs are a part of a series that can be found in other collections. Nubee[sic] Bicharins (GEH) and Nubie, Richurins en voyage (BnF) include the same n1en, and, in all three, the central n1an is still brandishing his spear. By exan1ining the Zangakis' photographs, I have observed that by using the san1e scene or figures, they took tnany pictures of the same subjects. Although, the tourists considered the Nubians as primitive, the Zangakis seetn to respect them. They position the Nubians sitting on their catnels brandishing their spears so that the can1era looks up to then1. In this way, the Zangakis succeed in conveying the Nubians' courage and pride. Shadouf and sak"kia, irrigation tools to draw water from the Nile, were of interest to the Western tourist because they seen1ed pritnitive. The Zangakis photographed these two tools together with men and boys who worked the1n. These images portray a straightforward view of the location. Chadot{{s de Ia haute[sic] Egypte[sic] (AGO) (Fig.21), Chadoufs de Ia haute[sic] Egypte [sic](BnF) and Saqqieh Egyptiene[sic] (GEH) (Fig.22) are some of the exan1ples.

Coverage of Current Events Photographers during this period captured current events, such as the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. An albun1en print of the Zangakis, Plan du Canal, Maritime de Sue= (Plan of the Canal, the Sue= Maritime Canal) (BnF) (Fig.23), includes the plan of the canal, twenty-four small albun1en prints cut in octagonal shapes and the Zangakis' natne on the bottom left comer of the plan inscribed as Zangaki Freres Port-Said. This is a well-presented and well-composed print illustrating the Zangakis' precise work ethic. As a significant docwnent of the Suez Canal, it shows portraits of pashas including their natnes and portraits of wmnen and views of the Canal including its location nan1es. Bateaux aretes a Port Said acause de Ia Drague [sic} (BnF) illustrates sightseeing ships in order in front of Port Said (Fig.24). The Zangakis also documented coaling stations of ships (Drague a'longue[sic} eculaine (BnF), Fig.25). Alongside their conten1poraries, the Zangakis photographed the aftern1ath of the British Mediterranean Fleet botnbardtnent that took place in Alexandria on 11-13 July 1882. Pan-Islamic nationalist activity against Westen1ization peaked on 11 July and during this peak, there was a fleet of fifteen Royal Navy in Alexandria. A riot broke out and the pan-Islrunic nationalists killed the Europeans. Following, there was a conflict between Britain and Egypt over the fortifications. As a result, Britain bombarded Alexandria and defeated the Egyptian troops and Egypt became a British protectorate until 1922. Xanthakis includes a detail from one of their images of Pharos of Alexandria showing one of the Zangakis taken standing in the ruins of the destroyed fort.

in Alexandria. He states that they are not signed but the captions are exactly in the style of the Zangakis. These photographs provide important docutnentation of the bombardtnent (Fig.26 and Fig.27). The Zangakis photographed processions such as weddings and the return of the Malunal (pilgrimage caravan) frmn Mecca. Chameaux de mariage arabe (Marta Braun Coli.) is a very good typical example of a wedding at the time, and a popular in1age amongst tl1e tourists since there are several duplicates of it in collections today (Fig.28). The subject, part of an Arab wedding, corresponds with the procession of the camelleaders and catnels decorated with drutns. The Zangakis captured the retun1 of the Mahmal (pilgritnage caravan) in their Arivee[sic} du M[ahmel} Caire (GEH) (Fig.29), which is an exan1ple of this ceretnonial event witnessed by huge crowds. This in1age shows the procession in the city of the Mahn1al on its return journey frmn Mecca. It includes covered litters, carrying wotnen pilgrin1s.

Landscapes and Citvscapes Photographs of landscapes and cityscapes, demonstrating the exotic locale, were tnajor tourist choices. The landscapes were mostly views of the Nile River, palm trees, Dahabeahs, steamboats, and also of reflections of pahns trees and pyramids. The Zangakis' Vue des trois Pyramides (GEH) includes the three pyratnids of Giza (Cheops, Chephren and Micerinus) reflected in the sn1ooth surface of the Nile (Fig.30). A shadouf can also be seen on the left of the image. In other images of the Zangakis, they portrayed the water sellers and women with their water carriers in the water. After the invention of the gelatin dry plates, as an alternative of capturing the Nile's smooth surface, the

43

Zangakis photographed the Nile in n1oven1ent. Assouan premier caracte[sic] (AGO) is an itnage of large waves (F ig.31). In the middle of this in1age, there seems to be a man with his arn1s in the air falling into the water. This in1age is a key exatnple of the use of gelatin dry plate negatives, which resulted in faster exposures. With the dry plate, the Zangakis captured ships sailing on the water, tnen bathing in the flow of the Nile and details of the waves on the water. The Zangakis captured cityscapes from a higher distance overlooking Islatnic architecture, houses on the shore of the Suez Canal and entire cities. This was a way to exemplify the Islan1ic architecture since it was considered exotic to the tourist. Le Mue==u

Caire (Marta Braun coiL) is an image including one of the minarets (generally tall spires
with onion-shaped crowns of the n1osque) and of the mue==in (the person at the mosque who leads the call and the daily prayers) (Fig.32). The tninaret is placed vertically in the 1niddle of the itnage while it presents a view of the city in the background. This itnage has an appealing feature, the crescent on: the top-left of the n1inaret, which shows the indication of the retouching during printing.

Docun1entation of Egyptian Antiquities In several of the Zangakis' photographs, there is a Dahabeah shown gliding on the water. The nan1e Olga is inscribed at the botton1 of the boat, and there is a Greek flag waving in the wind (Fig.33). This n1ay be the Dahabeah that the Zangaki brothers used to travel up the Nile. They photographed Egyptian hieroglyphics, columns, tetnples, ton1bs, statues, the Sphinx, and the Pyramids. These locations were already fan1iliar to most people since Maxime du Camp (French, 1822 - 1894), Gustave Le Gray (French, 1820-

44

1884), Francis Frith (British, 1822 - 1898), and other photographers had photographed then1 using calotype process on salted and albumen paper in the 1850s. Late nineteenthcentury photographers photographed Egyptian monmnents and sites for different reasons. The generation of 1850s provided the first photographs of Egypt. Late nineteenth-century photographers' photographs were for tourists to take home as souvenirs of their travels in Egypt. Early and late nineteenth-century photographs of Egyptian monuments often included not only the site but also the photographers' dragomen. Murray explains the definition of a dragoman in his guidebook, A Handbook for Travellers in Lower and Upper Egypt ( 1888), "The dragoman, literally an interpreter, will take all trouble off his hands, and for a fix su1n defray all the expenses of travelling, food, lodging, servants, &e. " 78 Early photographers used dragomen to give a sense of proportion, emphasizing the size of the n1onument. However, late nineteenth-century photographers also included their drago1nen to portray the Oriental inhabitants in their traditional costmnes. Their photographs included not only their dragomen but also their crunels and donkeys to make the photograph Oriental and, therefore, saleable to the tourist. Son1e Zangaki photographs of this genre are Statue de Ramses III [. .. see} du Ramesseum Thebes (AGO) (Fig.34), Philae Vue d'ensemble de colonnade temple d'Jsis (AGO) and Statue de Ramses a[sic} Louqsor[sic} (GEH) (Fig.35). Photographers in the late-nineteenth century attempted to capture the Sphinx frmn a range of angles and at different times/periods, often including their dragmnen, can1els and donkeys, and also soldiers and tourists. The Zangakis' photographs of the Sphinx are

78

particularly itnportant because one can see follow the progressive clearing of sand around the Sphinx. There were three known excavations of the Sphinx in the nineteenth-century. In 1853 and 1858, the sand was partially cleared by Auguste Mariette (the founder of the Egyptian Antiquities Service) but despite Mariette's work, the sands soon invaded the breast area of the monun1ent again. In 1885, Gaston Maspero (director of the Antiquities Service) attempted to clean the Sphinx' s forelegs. Le Sphynx et Pyramide (AGO) (Fig.36) and the Le Sphy nx Caire (GEH) (Fig.37) can be dated before 1885 since the breast area is covered with sand and camels are sitting on a sandbank that covers the Sphinx' s forelegs.
[Le Sphinx} (AUC) (Fig.38) and Sphy nx decouvert[sic} (BnF) (Fig.39) can be dated after

1885 that shows Maspero ' s excavation of the forelegs .

Appearance of One of the Zangakis and Their Portable Darkroon1 Perez, Ostnan, Xanthakis and Jacobson point out that, in several of the Zangakis' itnages, their portable darkroom and one of the Zangakis are visible. This was useful for these historians in trying to figure out that there were two brothers. Xanthakis speculates that the bearded n1ru1 in their photographs is Constantinos. From the inscription on their carriage these historians assutned that the Zangakis were possibly Greek until Xanthakis' locating the grandson of Constantinos. Future research remains to be done to bring together several Zangaki photographs that include one of the brothers and their portable darkroon1. There is a possible reason why the Zangakis included one of them in their photographs. This was a way to exetnplify that they were the tnakers of their images. The tnan with the bowler hat around the Sphinx is one of the brothers as is the figure standing

46

on the Sphinx- Le Sphinx et Pyramide (AGO) (Fig.36 and Fig.40), sitting on the Sphinx Sphynx et Ia grand Pyramide de Cheope (CCA) (Fig.41) and standing at a distance fron1 the Sphinx - Pyramide de Cheops le Sphynx et le temple de Choffs (BnF) (Fig.42). Two other in1ages also include one of the brothers; Rue Kormar a[sic} Sue= (Marta Braun coiL) and Avenue des pyramides Cairo (Nicholas Wan1er coli.). Xanthakis included [Nubians and the crocodi/e}/ 9 which is an in1age of a stuffed crocodile surrounded by inhabitants on the shores of the Nile (Fig.43). They are pretending to fight the crocodile as the Zangakis had told then1 to hold still due to the slow exposure of wet collodion process. This in1age also possibly includes one of the brothers kneeling next to the crocodile. Though this n1an does not have a bowler hat, he has a western-style suit and light coloured hat. His pose shows the right side of his face. Nubie Prise d'un Crocodil (BnF) and La Chasse du crocodil au bord du Nil (BnF) are also of the san1e scene but exclude the brothers. [On the Edge of the Jordan} (GEH) includes a person with western-style suit on the left next to the tree, and Le bain a[sic} Ia Mer Morte (GEH) also includes this sa1ne person standing on the shores of the Dead Sea. This person 1night, once n1ore, be one of the brothers. The Zangakis also included their horse-drawn portable darkroom in their images to illustrate where these images were developed and printed. There are three photographs found of the Zangakis that included their carriage. Each photograph illustrates a different side of their carriage: back, left and right side. The name of the finn of the Zangaki brothers is written in Greek, English, French and possibly in Arabic on the three sides of their carriage. All four languages are included for logical reasons, Greek as the Zangakis'

first language (indicating that they were Greek), Arabic as the predominant language in Egypt and, lastly, French and English as comn1only spoken languages an1ong the colonizers and tourists. The natnes on their carriage functioned not only as an advertisetnent for their business but also presented their natne to the viewer to who bought the print. In the Le Sphynx et Pyramide (AGO), the back of their carriage can be identified by the Greek inscription '"Adelphoi Zangaki Fotografoi," meaning "Zangaki

Brothers, Photographers '' (Fig.44 ). Osman included a detail of the Zangakis' [Lake Mariut],80 which shows the right side of the darkroon1 inscribed as "Zangaki Bros, Photographers" in English (Fig.45). Their exhausted horse is visible in this one as well.
In the Zangakis' i1nage, Avenue des py ramides Cairo (Nicholas Warner Coil.), the left side of the carriage has a French inscription [Zangaki Freresj Photographes (Fig.46). The 1niddle part of this inscription seetn like it is in Arabic, but I was not able to distinguish the letters.

Le Sphynx et Pyramide (AGO) carries an additional elen1ent. After closeexmnination of this image, I found an inscription in black, Zangaki, on the Sphinx, between the shadow of the Sphinx and the kneeling inhabitant, an ideal place from which to create an illusion that it is written on the Sphinx (Fig.47). Because of its black colour, it could only be done by scratching it (while writing backwards) on the binder layer of the negative. The Zangakis also wrote their nan1e as Constantin or Zangaki with a white paint directly on the statue/pyran1id like graffiti. These two tnethods were also done as a protective measure, so that if the negative was lost or destroyed, any existing print of the Sphinx would still have name Zangaki inscribed on it.

POSTCARDS As advancetnents in photography led to the developn1ent of the postcard, many existing negatives were reprinted as postcards. The Zangakis were successful photographers not only because their albun1en prints circulated widely but also because tnany of their images were printed and sold as postcards. One cannot know if they were printed with the photographers' permission or fron1 an original or a copy negative without their knowledge. I have found five exatnples to demonstrate that the Zangakis' albumen prints were printed as postcards by other photography firms. I have also found one postcard that has Constantinos Zangaki ' s natne on it, verifying Xanthakis' assumption that Constantinos was involved in postcard production. The Zangakis' postcards, whether they were printed by photography fim1s or by Constantinos, are representative of the transition from albutnen prints to postcards from the 1870s into the 1920s.
Diner Arabe (UCL) by the Zangakis is a horizontal photograph of a constructed

fan1ily scene having dinner around a chicken basket sitting on the ground (Fig.48). This in1age is a striking one, catching the act of eating. The positions of the figures fonn a circle and the won1an in the n1iddle becmnes the center point. Osman includes a coloured postcard81 [Egypt, Arab Family] (Fig.49). This in1age has the same cotnposition and figures as Diner Arabe, although it is vertical and there is a slight difference in the figures' positions. Most likely, the Zangakis took several frames of the family. It was a characteristic of the Zangakis' photography practice to take more than one picture of the srune scene, and explains the small changes in the image. This postcard is a Zangaki image. Osman writes that this postcard may have been published by C. Andreopoulos,

Femme arabe femme turque (BnF) has a slight trace of the Zangakis' signature (Fig.50). This in1age includes two wotnen, one wearing the Turkish costume holding a water pipe and the other in an Arab costume holding a tambourine. It is an example of a comparison between the two cultures by portraying different costutnes. In Odalisques & Arabesques Jacobson included a coloured photograph 82 of two Middle Eastern won1en (c.l900) transferred to a silk place tnat or a handkerchief (Fig.51). This coloured photograph and the albun1en print Femme arabe femme turque (BnF) are produced from an identical negative. A tnass-produced albumen print such as this one, originally n1ade for tourists in the 1870s, was reproduced as a very delicate handkerchief or silk place n1at decades later in the 1900s. While its first life was as a loose print, the photo evolved into a personal object for the owner. Osn1an includes an albumen print [Two Sudanese Women] ,83 which is an image of two girls posed back to back in front of a stone wall (Fig.52). I found a postcard online84 that is identical. The inscription on the postcard is Series 647. Edit. The Cairo Post-Card Trust- Ph. N 010 (Fig.53).

Lastly, Porteur d'eau (BnF) portrays a water-seller pouring water into one woman' s very large water carrier as another looks on (Fig.56).

PRESERVATION OF VIEWS OF EGYPT
Views of Egypt is a thin and light albun1 measuring 1.7 cn1 x 29.1 cn1 x 39.1 em. It

has both a thin cover and a binding. The binding had weakened, and it was broken in different parts of the albutn (Fig.59). The leaves are thin and acidic fr01n having been kept in different climates (Fig.60). Out of the forty-six albwnen prints, tneasuring approxin1ately 21.5 em by 28 ctn, forty-one of thetn were slotted into the four corner "pockets" on each floppy leaf of the album. Each leaf held two photographs, one in the front and one in the back, by their four corners. However, the leaves could not carry the weight of the prints. The retnaining five prints of the forty-six were stacked loosely at the back of the albu1n. This tnethod for holding photos in place posed the first risk to archival preservation. The corners of several of the photographs were not slotted through properly. There were creases and tears on the corners of the prints and also tears on the floppy leaves (Fig.61 and Fig.62). The reason for this was that when turning the pages, the photographs would slip out of the "pockets." Because of this, the order of the prints was changed many titnes over the years, and there was no visual or docun1ented record of the original order or the subsequent sequencing. 88 As Sutnik explains, "Continuous replacetnents into the "pockets" damaged and kinked the corners of the prints, and hence they were better left loose. " 89 After learning that the owner had had to tnove the prints around several tin1es, Sutnik, Whitn1an and I agreed that the significance of the original order of the prints had been lost tnany years ago, and there was therefore little

88 89

53

justification for keeping the prints in a deteriorating housing. We n1ade a decision to remove the prints fron1 the albwn. Although there are creases and tears in the prints, ironically the prints maintain rich tonal values, since they were not tnounted to albutn pages. As Sutnik concludes, "Many tnow1ted prints of the period suffered various kinds of degradation as a result of glues and acidic containn1ent. " 90 Most of the Zangakis' photographs that I have seen in the Bnf and in the AUC (and most likely in other collections) are faded for three reasons: Their prints were not well preserved because there was no understanding of their itnages until recent publications on photography of the Middle East, such as Jacobson's. Second, most of the Zangakis' prints were glued on travel album pages and this created various degradations.Â·Third, their photographs were a part of the con1n1ercial industry, thus they produced n1any in1ages quickly; n1ost likely their itnages were not fixed and washed properly.

INITIAL DIGITIZATION After Sutnik, Whittnan and I decided to remove the prints frotn the album; it becatne necessary to docwnent the process at every stage, so that an accurate record of the albtml ' s present order and condition would be preserved. I numbered each page of the albtnn with a pencil on the right botton1 corner. Following, I photographed the recto of the prints (in their "pockets") in their present order, in which the owner last assembled them. I used a Nikon Coolpix P5100, 12.1-tnega-pixel catnera (recording at 3264 x 2448 resolution). I also photographed the condition of the album, including damage such as creases and tears caused by its current n1ethod of storage.

ALTERNATIVE HOUSING SOLUTIONS After discussing the task with Whitn1an, she presented a nun1ber of alten1ative housing solutions both for the album and the photographs. Following, I presented the alternative housings to Sutnik. Below are the four alternatives:
1. Prints would be inserted into mylar sleeves with backing boards. Fallowing

that, the sleeves would be put in an archival box. The empty album shell would be put in an archival box. These two boxes would be kept together in a vault at the AGO. 2. A pre-1nade albu1n would be ordered frmn an archival con1pany, which would later be put into an archival box. The prints would be pasted on the pre-1nade albun1 pages using wheat starch archival tape around the edges of the prints (in the order that they were last assetnbled by the owner). The e1npty albu1n shell would then be put into an archival box. 3. A bookbinder would create an album for the photographs using a wheat starch archival tape surrounding the edges of the prints (in the order that they were last assembled by the owner). The empty albu1n shell would then be put into an archival box. 4. The prints would be n1atted individually using wheat starch archival tape. The empty albun1 shell would be put in an archival box.

HOUSING PLAN Both the physical structure and chetnical nature of a photographic object is susceptible to different kinds of damage including acidic fiunes, ozone, fluctuating temperatures, humidity, insects, mol<L residual chemicals in the print or damage due to

55

poor storage conditions and/or mishandling. 91 It was essential to address which alternative housing would be most suitable for both the photographs and the e1npty albu1n shell. After conversations with Sutnik and Whitn1ru1, we decided on Option 1. This is a clean and affordable housing solution for albumen prints. Mylar sleeves with backing boards are a standard preservation option for albumen prints. In this approach, the prints would be kept together and researched, as a group the owner had previously an1assed. The history of the albun1 remains joined, and in the future the AGO would be able to exhibit these prints individually including the new inforn1ation found on the Zangakis, Peridis and Georgiladakis. Consequently I ren1oved the prints from the albu1n and temporarily transferred the1n into an archival box with interleaving tissue paper. The order of the prints was maintained. I was able to exrunine the versos of the prints and the full inscriptions of the signatures of the photographers, the titles of the locations and the negative numbers on the prints on the recto.

SECOND DIGITIZATION There were three sets of photographs taken after ren1oving the prints fron1 the albu1n, once again with the Nikon Coolpix P51 00, 12.1-mega-pixel can1era at the same resolution. The following are the three sets: First, the entire photograph; second, Close-up of the signature of the photographer; ru1d, third, close-up of both the negative number and the na1ne of the location.

THE NEW HOUSINGS Following the decision regarding new housings for the photographs and for the en1pty album shell, I measured the prints and the shell. I found the most appropriate measure1nents for sleeves and archival boxes for the prints and the album at the archival company, Carr MacLean. Appendix D shows which materials were ordered and received from Carr MacLean. After receiving the order fro1n Carr MacLean, seven 32' x 40' backing boards were cut into forty-six sheets of 9' x 12' at the Conservation Departn1ent. The AGO accession number of the Views of Egypt albun1 is 2008/121. After the removal, each print was given a sub-nun1ber frmn 2008/121.1 to 2008/121.46. These sub-numbers reflect the placen1ent of the prints in the albwn, when the albun1 catne to the AGO. I wrote the prints' accession nwnbers on the backs of the prints and on the backing boards with a pencil. This was needed to identify the print. Following, I inserted both the print and the backing board in each tnylar sleeve. The n1ylar sleeves were stacked and put into the Hollinger box in the order that they were last assetnbled by the owner (Fig.63). I placed the empty album shell into the second Hollinger box and enclosed the albu1n with archival foam to keep it stable (Fig.64). Following, I labeled both of the boxes displaying their AGO accession ntunbers. These two boxes are now kept together on the metal shelf in the Prints and Drawings vault of the AGO, which also houses the Photography Collection.

CONCLUSION The Views of Egypt albun1 and its photographs by the Zangaki brothers have been the focus of this project. Cataloguing of the Views of Egypt albmn has resulted in understanding the chronological sequence of the Zangaki brothers' negative nmnbers and its relation to the locations they traveled in Egypt. The Zangakis' careers spanned the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 to postcard production into the 1920s. Their work is crucial to understanding late-nineteenth century con1n1ercial photography in Egypt that supplied Oriental subjects, scenes and picturesque views for the Western tourist. There was already an established tnarket for such in1agery from Orientalist paintings and literature, and the Zangakis were prolific photographers who were successful in catering to it. Their prints had enonnous longevity and were also printed as postcards. There are at least one thousand five hundred prints in collections today that I know of. However, their highest negative number being 1672, and assmning that they made at least several prints frotn each negative, we are left with a n1uch higher nutnber. There are likely to be more prints in existence to be found. When the Zangakis' photographs were first produced, they functioned as a tourist's souvenir of Egypt, a retniniscence of the Orient. Today, these late-nineteenth century tourist photographic albmns and the photographs contained within are visual objects that can help recuperate history. Museums and archives, such as the Art Gallery of Ontario, hold collections that further our understand of the practices behind these photographs, the ancient history of Egypt, the colonization of the East by the West, the establishment of the Oriental genre, the photography and the tourist industry in the late nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century in Egypt.

58

Although aesthetics fall outside of the scope of this thesis, I find the Zangakis' photographs unique. When I first saw Views of Egypt at the AGO, I was astonished by the range of subjects and the quality of the photographs. This acquisition needed attention and research needed to be done to find out who the 1nakers of these photographs were and how the album was put together. I expect this thesis to provide the foundation for further research that will generate knowledge and awareness of the Zangaki brothers' work and give them a more pr01ninent place in the history of Middle East com1nercial photography.

APPENDIXB: CATALOGUE OF THE VIEWS OF EGYPT ALBUM

81

CATALOGUING METHODOLOGY I docun1ented each print by the following fields in Microsoft Excel: AGO ID, Creator, Negative Nmnber (Neg. No), Title, Date, Mediutn, Size (cn1), Condition, Notes. The "AGO ID" field refers to the identification nun1ber of the print. The albun1' s accession nun1ber is 20081121. The nmnber for each individual print is a sub-number, such as fron1 2008/121.1 to 2008/121.47. These records will display the catalogue infonnation for that individual print in the AGO database. The "Creator" field lists the name associated with each print, as taken frmn the signature found on the bottom-left corner of the prints. If there is no signature, I have entered " Unknown ," "'Zangaki [attributed to}," and '"Zangaki or Peridis [attributed to} " in the spreadsheet. The "Neg. No." field is the number \\Titten on the bottom-right comer of the print. It is nonnally after the '"N" letter and before the title of the location or subject. This negative nutnber is the nutnber that the Zangaki brothers, Peridis and Georgiladakis gave to that specific negative or print. If there is no negative nun1ber on the print, I have entered "'Unnumbered."

i.

The "Title" field is entered frotn the location or subject natne on the print. This can be found on the bottotn right comer after the negative number. I have chosen to transcribe the title as it appears on the print. If no location natne was found, a title in square brackets "'[The Road of Sphinx]" was entered. If the title was illegible, '"[ ... ]Karnac" was entered. If there is a spelling mistake, "'[sic]" is used. The '"Date" field is entered according to the photographers' active period. The dates are unknown for all the prints; thus, a circa "ca." is assigned to give the best

82

available infonnation about the print. Circa dates are usually represented with a range of ten years - five years on either side of the given date. The date can vary according to historical infonnation that the print provides, such as the progression of the clearing sand frotn the breast of the Sphinx. The "Medium" field lists the n1edium of the prints. Although all the prints are albutnen prints, this will ensure that this information will be available to curators who are only looking at individual prints rather than any secondary 1naterial. The "Size ( ctn)" field is entered according to height and width in centitneters. For photographs with uneven edges, I entered the longest side. Entered in the "Condition" field are short forn1s indicating various conditions, such as crease, tear, bend, fold, discoloration, specs, stain, and so on. Specific letters were used to describe the location of the dan1age: Location Key: R= right, L= left, T= top, B= bottmn, C= corner, E= edge, M= 1niddle. The "Notes" field refers to any other relevant infonnation that does not fit in any of the above fields. If "Peridis e " was entered as the photographer for the print, but Georgiladakis ' name had also been written on the print though later erased, this would be entered in the notes as, "Georgiladakis' signature was erased." Both "Condition" and "Notes" have not been included in Appendix B due to lack of space, although they will be included in the version that the AGO receives.

CATALOGUING METHODOLOGY I decided to keep the list stnall and only include the fields that were necessary for each print: Zangaki Negative Nmnber (Neg. No.), Title, Repository & ID and Notes. Some of these fields are established already in the section of cataloguing n1ethodology of the Views ofEgypt album. The differences follow as such: If the negative nun1ber on the print was illegible, I have entered it as "illeg;" if there was no nun1ber on the print, I have entered it as "Unnumbered;" if the itnage was found online and the number was illegible because it is online, I have entered "Unknown;" if I could not figure out a nutnber in the negative nmnber, I have put for example "1057?"; and, lastly, if I could not distinguish between, say, a 530 or a 630, I have written "530 or 630." The "Repository & ID" is entered based on where the print is currently located. I attetnpted to use as many prints as possible fron1 online catalogues of institutions in addition to the exatnination of original prints. There are many Zangaki prints worldwide, and it is itnportant to keep this list open to any source. The short forn1 of the institution was used, such as "AGO," and, if the print has an access number, it was written after the natne. Example: AGO, 2008/121.35. If the print's photographer was entered as "Zangaki," although a faint "H. Arnoux" signature is visible, this would be entered in the "Notes" field as "H. Arnoux's signature was possibly erased. This field has not been included in Appendix C due to lack of space.
