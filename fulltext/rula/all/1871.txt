Introduction This thesis is a practical project-- a finding aid for twenty-five years of Kodak Advertisements, which will encompass a written description of the project, an analysis of the results, and the finding aid itself. I have compiled an index of each advertisement published between the years of 1900 to 1925 from the Kodak Advertising Collection binders at the George Eastman Study Centre (GESC) in the George Eastman House Museum of Photography and Film (GEH) in Rochester, New York. The Library of Congress defines a finding aid as: "A description of an archival collection, usually containing a history of the person or organization that produced the collection and an inventory of its contents." 1 With this in mind, I will begin the first section by giving an overview of the Kodak Advertising Collection, tracing its mysterious provenance, and describing how it came to be at the GEH. I will discuss relevant sources of information in the literature review and then describe my methodology. The second part of the paper will be the analysis, including a description of inherent categories discovered within the advertisements, and a more detailed study of one of the themes (soldiers). The Kodak Advertising Collection is a much-used asset at the George Eastman House and it is my goal that the finding aid that I have assembled will assist researchers in the future. At present, the advertisements are only searchable at the binder level. With the addition of this finding aid to the

study center, the advertisements for this twenty-five year period will be searchable individually. This collection is important to the museum and its history and by assembling this finding aid I have helped to improve access to it. In addition, I hope that my written analysis will enable people to gain a greater understanding of the Kodak material from the beginning of the twentieth century. This project was completed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in the program of Photographic Preservation and Collections Management.

An Overview of Kodak and the Kodak Advertising Collection George Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak company was a self made man. Unhappy with the large photographic outfits of the time, Eastman set out to create an easier way to take photographs. This led to the invention of the Kodak camera in 1888. It was lauded as the first camera that could be used by anyone, regardless of his or her skill, age, sex, or economic status. The camera-- a box covered in leather-- was simple to operate. The camera was aimed at the subject, the button was pressed, and a crank was turned to advance to the next photograph. Kodak cameras came pre-loaded with 100 shots. When the user had taken all the photos, he or she simply shipped the camera back to Eastman Kodak where Kodak employees would process and print the images, re-load the camera, and send everything back to the customer. As Kodak put it early on, it was "Photography with the bother left out." 2 This was a time of change for advertising. In the late nineteenth century it was seen as a distasteful obligation companies could use to increase knowledge of their brands. These text-based ads gave way to more visually appealing ads featured in magazines. Advertising became something to be taken seriously, by consumers and companies alike, and as a result the quality and the appeal of the ads shot up. Eastman realized this early on, and so began to use advertisements

to create "a nation of amateur photographers." 3 During the years contained in this finding aid, unlike many other corporations, Kodak did not contract their advertising out to an ad agency. Instead, Eastman invented slogans and ad concepts himself. The ads began as simple illustrations of products with information on their availability. As advertising techniques evolved at the end of the 1890's and the early 1900's, Kodak, led by Eastman and later, advertising director Lewis Bunnell Jones began to use more visually sophisticated means to sell their cameras. Ads no longer featured the camera front and centre. An ever-growing portion of Kodak's monthly ads began to feature people instead. These figures, which were always fashionably dressed, white, middle-class or above men and women, held onto the Kodak as if it was an extension of their fashionable attire. The Kodak became an accessory, part of the lifestyle. The make, model, and technical specifications became less important; what was important was the act of taking photographs. Eastman used his ads to promote photography as a part of life, trying to prevent it as being seen as a passing fad. To do this, he shifted his marketing strategy to include families and children. Ads encouraged parents to photograph children constantly, warning the parents that memories would fade over time, and only a photograph would "keep the story."

Eastman told J. Walter Thompson in the 1880's that "A picture of a pretty girl sells more than a tree or a house." 4 and so, he created the most iconic of Kodak ads: The Kodak Girl. Always fashionable, the Kodak Girl appeared in many ads beginning in 1888 and continuing well into the later 20th century. As Nancy West argues, the Kodak Girl's "youthful image would signify the ease, pleasure, and freedom of snapshot photography."5 By using the Kodak Girl, as well as the later introduced Brownie Boy and a host of other men, women and children, Kodak created a marketing campaign that focused not only on how and when to photograph, but highlighted how simple it was to do. Advertisements continued to additionally laude the newest features in the cameras but these advertisements dwindled as time went on, limited to an announcement when a new model was available. The rest of the time, the people in the ads became the demonstrators and promoters of the Kodaks, eliminating the need for camera focused sales advertisements. What started out as a camera and film company expanded rapidly during the twenty-five year period I surveyed; there are advertisements for a large variety of products. Film and cameras are well represented, but so are chemicals; both for photographic, and general use. The binders from 1920 onwards have more Eastman Organic Chemical ads than they do ads for cameras. In addition to this, there are a multitude of ads for darkroom apparatuses--cutting boards, film tanks, enlargers, rulers, lamps, and much

more. Many Kodak publications are featured, advertising to the reader how to take better photographs at home, on the farm, and of the children. X-Ray film features prominently in later years, showing images of teeth, gallstones and other internal maladies all diagnosed with Kodak X-Ray film. Of course, each binder also contains many ads featuring happy men, woman and children outdoors lauding the newest Kodak camera--These are the ads which most often are representative of this time period at Kodak, when in reality the ads selling neither camera nor film number just as high. The Kodak Advertising Collection consists of 708 binders and scrapbooks, put together by the company's ad department over the course of its history. These are made up of several types of binders, as one can assume availability changed over the collection's long history. The binders for the twenty-five year period I surveyed measure 15" wide, 17 Â½" high, and 2 Â½" deep. Each binder contains between 35 and 50 pages that are slipped into plastic protective sheets. The ads themselves are pasted to black or white paper and are sometimes accompanied by penciled-in notes (most often the date). In some cases there is also a date stamped onto the ad, though this is not consistent. These books were compiled by the Eastman Kodak Company and were donated to the George Eastman House in 2003. The collection covers more than 100 years of advertisements-- both tear sheets and printed ads-- from 1884 to 1988 Before coming to the GEH the ads were stored in Kodak headquarters, located at 343 State St., Rochester

NY. They were kept in the basement under the jurisdiction of the Kodak library.6 As Kodak began to downsize their operations in the late 1990's, librarians were laid off or relocated. The last remaining librarian at Kodak headquarters, Ray Curtin, realized that this material was in danger of being lost therefore in 2001 he invited Kathy Connor, who was curator of the Eastman Legacy Collection at the GEH, to look at the collection in order to see if the GEH would be interested in taking it. Although it does not strictly fall within the collection's mission (to collect material related to the life of George Eastman from the years 1854Â­1932, with the advertising collection extending beyond this date range),7 Kathy agreed to present the material to her acquisition committee. Despite both Kathy and the committee being against the acquisition of the materials, they were brought into the collection in 2003, mostly due to the prompting of the museum's director. If the GEH had not accepted the collection in its entirety, the portion after 1932 would have been sent to the University of Rochester, home to another Kodak archive, but it was thought more appealing to keep the entire collection together.8 It is worth noting that the business archive at University of Rochester is extensive and may be useful for researchers interested in the business side of Kodak. It is home to a substantial number of boxes containing business papers from Eastman Kodak, including boxes of advertising manuscripts, seven that I personally scoured in search of in-

house information on the development of the advertisements. Unfortunately, I was unable to find anything relevant to my thesis but the university's archive would still be a valuable source for other Kodak researchers. The material was not considered desirable to the GEH committee at the time because not only did it span further than the years of Eastman's life and thus outside the mission of the collection, but also because it came into the collection unorganized and not catalogued. Kodak promised to pay for the shelving of the collection and the moving expenses incurred in the process though, and so Connor planned a movable shelving system for the ads to be housed on. With this plan in place, the advertisements were packed into hundreds of boxes and sent to the GEH in 2003. The binders that the ads are stored in are perhaps made of materials that are not archival grade. In the 39 binders I surveyed, the ads are pasted to different types of paper slipped into clear binder sheets. The black paper used in some cases is in much better condition than the brittle, white paper used in others. However, black album paper is well known for being acidic and not good for long-term preservation of paper materials. The binders themselves are often overfull, leading to the binder rings opening when being used by a researcher. This poses a higher risk of damage for the ads as, at this point, there is more opportunity to be dropped or mishandled. It is because of these issues that, when the collection was brought into GEH, Kathy Connor had an assessment made for the re-housing of the material. It was estimated that it would cost seventy-five thousand dollars, which is

8

obviously much more money than the museum has to spend.9 This is partially because of the size of the binders-- they are not standard and therefore special housing materials would have to be made for them. With this cost in mind, it is unreasonable to chastise the GEH for how it houses the Kodak Advertising Collection; it was rescued from a basement storage room and moved to a climate-controlled facility, and the binders themselves are adequate protection from the elements. Archivists diligently assist researchers, reducing the improper handling that may occur from an overfull binder. Although there are more effective storage methods, it is a matter of balancing the ideal with the available, and in this case, I believe the collection is being well managed. When the collection was housed at Kodak, before it arrived at the Eastman House, it was inaccessible to almost everybody. Exceptions were sometimes granted to see the material, such as in the case of Nancy Martin West, author of Kodak and the Lens of Nostalgia, and with Warner Brothers when they asked to access it for material for their parks and films. This has changed drastically with its move to the GEH. The Kodak Advertising Collection can now be seen by anybody who asks, which has both pros and cons. It is positive because this is the purpose of a research collection: to be seen. However, each viewing of the binders places strain on them; brittle paper cracks, the binders break, and there is always a risk to the collection itself. For this reason, other methods of viewing the ads are available. For instance, in many cases a researcher will be content with seeing a facsimile

of the ad, and so binders of photocopies are available at the Study Center for such work. Additionally, the GEH's website has a large number of advertisements available to view online. However, this will not satisfy every researcher and in some cases there is no alternative but to show the original material. When this happens, it is preferable to show the researcher his or her particular request with as little disruption to the rest of the collection as possible. This is where my finding aid will be useful. Since 2003, there have been several finder's tools applied to the Kodak ads in order to make them more accessible. After the collection's acquisition, Kathy Connor hired archivist Deb Hamil, who spent two years creating index sheets for each binder. These sheets, along with an internal HTML database, give basic information about the content of each binder. Overall themes as well as subjects are listed along with any other information that may be unique to a binder. This information focuses on the ads relating to Kodak cameras, as this is the area that the Study Center receives the most requests. To date, no finding aid has been created focusing on individual advertisements in the binders. This is what my project will change. With a finding aid in place that allows a researcher to search for a specific ad before turning to the binders themselves, the collection will be more accessible than ever before while at the same time it will cut down on unnecessary access to the ads. As it is the ultimate goal of the George Eastman Study Center to facilitate research and discovery, this will allow the GESC to help accommodate research requests on many levels while adhering to the preservation and care of the material required by an institution. Both

Hamil's finding aid and my own facilitate access to the collection, however Hamil's is only useful at the binder level whereas my own will allow the researcher to view information pertinent to the individual advertisements.

Literature Survey Research for my thesis was concentrated on three distinct areas: the history of advertising, and the United States of America from 1900-1925; the history of Kodak and George Eastman; and research on existing finding aids. Of these three areas, the Kodak ads have the least written on them. While the history of Kodak and George Eastman is widely published, the advertisements themselves are not widely discussed in scholarly papers, likely due to the previously discussed unavailability of the collection itself until recently. In my study of American history, I found A History of the American People by Paul Johnson to be a comprehensive look at America's entire history. The years 1900-1925 are covered from many angles, including relevant looks at the rise in wealth over the first ten years of the century and the growing gap between the rich and the poor.10 Additionally, Johnson looks at the growth of daily newspapers from 1850-1910. There were 260 daily papers in 1870 versus the 2,600 in 1910-- the latter which is the peak number of daily newspapers in American history, meaning more of an audience for Kodak's ads.11 Advertising the American DreamÂ­ Making Way for Modernity, 19201940 by Roland Marchand was an excellent modern-day look at early twentieth century ads, even though I am interested in a time period earlier than the book highlights. While Marchand mentions Kodak specifically twice

12

in his book, both times it is in reference to ads after 1925.12 Nevertheless, Marchand's examples of common advertising tactics are quite relevant to the advertisements in the collection, as they share a number of similarities, for example, the chapter "Visual ClichÃ©" where examples of the a familial unit in advertising is illustrated.13 Jackson Lears's book Fables of AbundanceÂ­ A Cultural History of Advertising in America contained interesting ideas about the incorporation of photography into advertising in its chapter "The Persistence and Resurgence of Real Life". Lears mentions the statistic that between 1922 and 1927, advertisements in Ladies Home Journal using photographs increased to twenty-five percent, up from fourteen percent.14 This was an interesting statistic, especially considering that Kodak ads featured a higher number of photographic ads much earlier. However, this is hardly surprising considering the nature of Eastman Kodak. Image Makers by Robert Jackall and Janice M. Hirota examines advertising primarily from the viewpoint of supporting organizations. For example, the chapter on World War I, which I found particularly helpful, wrote about the representation of the war shown to the American people as created by the Committee on Public Information. This committee, founded in 1917 and disbanded in 1919, was created to "sell America's Crusade to the

American Public." 15 During the war years, Kodak primarily focused on marketing their products to families of soldiers. Looking at the ads through the ideas of the Committee on Public Information brings new light onto many of the themes inherent in the advertisements themselves. Photographic Memories by Rob Kroes is an investigation of the photograph, which was helpful in obtaining information on the link between the photograph and memory that I discuss in my analysis of soldier advertisements.16 The Past Within Us by Tessa Morris-Suzuki was similarly helpful, as it discusses the ways in which history is disseminated through all forms of media. Though it emphasizes the history of Asia, the themes and ideas translated well to American history.17 Both Jay Winter's Remembering War and Martha Langford's Suspended Conversations writes about the act of soldiers assembling photographic albums. Langford, approaches this from a photographic perspective, analyzing the albums themselves, while Winter writes about the war itself, speaking of photographs as a byproduct.18 Both texts were very relevant to my exploration of WWI advertisements. The Mustering of Support for World War I by The Ladies Home Journal, by Joanne Karetzky was an interesting read. Speaking about the war from

the home front, Karetzky describes the Ladies Home Journal's transition from a peacetime magazine to a wartime one, including how this affected advertisers and their advertisements.19 In addition to books, I read many journal articles on subjects relevant to my research. Ultimately, the most helpful articles were ones that wove many of the elements in my analysis together. An excellent example of this is Sandy Callister's "Picturing Loss: Family, Photographs and the Great War". This article is an account of WWI from the perspective of New Zealanders. However, the information is also very relevant to the American's view of the war. Callister discusses Kodak's impact on the soldiers, their photographing as a result, and how these patterns shifted if a soldier lived or died in the war.20 The idea of photographing a soldier because he might die is one that I discuss in the analysis section, despite the fact that Kodak ads would never mention death. Alan Trachtenberg's "Through a Glass, Darkly: Photography and Cultural Memory", while primarily an article about a photograph's representation of truth in the digital era, also discusses Civil War photography. I found that Trachtenberg's ideas about Gardner's Sketchbook of the War and its idealized cover image mirrored Kodak's portrayal of WWI.21 Conversely, Dannagal Goldthwaite Young's "Sacrifice, Consumption, and the American Way of Life: Advertising and Domestic Propaganda During

World War II" to be a counterpoint to the Civil War material, looking ahead (so to speak) to WWII and the different advertising strategy used in that time period.22 "The Reframing of Traditional Cultural Values: Consumption and World War I", by Monica Brasted was helpful in my understanding of how advertising was used both before, and during WWI. In particular, it emphasized the emphasis on thrift most corporations worked into their advertisements during the war.23 In my analysis, I speak about how and why Kodak had no such emphasis. Additionally, Susan Zeiger's "She Didn't Raise Her Boy to be a Slacker: Motherhood, Conscription, and the Culture of the First World War" helped in my analysis of the wartime ads. It particularly helped in decoding the portrayal of women in these ads.24 The history of Kodak advertising, as stated, is not something that has been written about at length. The first source I looked at was Nancy Martha West's Kodak and the Lens of Nostalgia, which was published in 2000, three years before the Kodak Advertising Collection came to the GEH. West's book is an excellent overview of the advertisements, offering history, specific examples, analysis of themes, and cultural history. West mentions in her

introduction eight topics that Kodak carries on "cultural conversations" with. These topics: "travel, automobility, childhood, toys, feminine beauty, family, memory, and World War I"25 are very similar to the categories in which I have organized the advertisements in the finding aid. While West is regarded as the foremost scholar on the Kodak ads, it is important to note that her research was done before the collection moved to the GEH. As such, according to Kathy Connor, curator of the GEH who has helped West with projects since Kodak and the Lens of Nostalgia, it is important to understand that West was not able to see every ad when writing this book, and as such, some of the generalizations that she makes in the book have since been proven inaccurate.26 However, this is not to say that West's book is not a great source of information. It is simply important to consider these more recent developments as well. In addition to West's book, I have read Douglas Collins's The Story of Kodak. This book, published in 1990, gives a good overview of Kodak as a company. Besides a three-page section on the Kodak Girl, there is not much of interest in regards to the Kodak ads themselves contained within it, however it provided a good timeline of Kodak products when needed. Additionally, the George Eastman biography written by Elizabeth Brayer provided all the background on George Eastman himself that was needed. Another vast source of Kodak materials is the department of Special Collections at the University of Rochester's Rush Rees Library. The U of R has

received business papers from Eastman Kodak and I had hoped that some memos regarding ad production from my time period would survive. However, a day spent scouring the boxes provided to me yielded little; it seems that there are no remaining behind-the-scenes memos from this time period. While the archives in the GESC are extensive, it is prudent to mention that they are by no means the only collection of Kodak advertising material. Many other institutions hold impressive collections of Kodak materials as well. For example, Ryerson University holds the Kodak Collection, which was acquired in a similar manner to the GEH's acquisition of the Kodak Advertising Collection: In 2005, when Kodak Canada ceased operations at its Toronto location, arrangements were made for their corporate records, cameras, and the materials from their short-lived Heritage Museum to be transferred to the University.27 This collection includes Kodak Canada's advertising material, which was written about in Keri Lee Kauffman's thesis from 2009 "Kodak Canada: Increasing Access to Advertising Materials in Ryerson University Library's Special Collections".28 Similarly, The British Library holds the Kodak Limited's United Kingdom archives, donated to the Library in 2009.29

National holdings of Kodak collections can also be found in Australia at the Museum Victoria.30 Another significant holding of Kodak Ads is Duke University's "Ellis Collection of Kodakiana", a collection of advertisements from 1886-1923. This collection is particularly relevant because it is from the same time period as this thesis. In addition to physical locations of Kodak materials, there are many online resources that can be consulted by a researcher. Many of the institutions that hold physical collections place materials online for access. The GESC has a large number of advertisements on their website available to the researcher.31 Ryerson Library has placed a number of vintage Kodak publications on the website Archive.org. In fact, a search of Archive.org brings up over 500 mentions of Kodak, and there are many publications, and advertisements available for viewing. Lastly, there are also private collections that are accessible via an online presence. Websites like Kodakgirl.com, and Vintageadbrowser.com can be a vast source of ad material. For example, a search for Kodak on Vintageadbrowser.com produces 1170 ads, in many languages. Finally, in preparation to create this finding aid, I believed it prudent to look at other examples of finding aids. I began with examples created by graduates of this program, looking at theses written by Kristin Dudley, Jennifer Givogue, and Lisa C. Hennessey. Each presented their information in

slightly different ways, giving me many ideas to work with. None of these theses were created for the GESC, though, therefore I asked Kathy Connor to show me finding aids created especially for her material. In addition to these finding aids, I consulted both the Library of Congress's website as well as Duke University Library's, in order to understand their definition of a finding aid, as well as to view their online resources on the subject.

Methodology Knowing that I wanted to work with the Kodak advertising collection, I began by browsing the binders of ads, familiarizing myself with the scope and content of the collection as well as how it changed over the decades. The first decision was to choose when, out of the 104-year scope of the archive, I would focus on for the finding aid. Originally, the plan was to work only with the more image-based ads produced by Kodak. For the purposes of this thesis, I am defining image-based ads as the ones in which the focus is on the people in the advertisement and not the products. For example, an ad with a couple walking on the seaside accompanied by the text "Take a Kodak With You" would be an example of an image-based ad, while an ad featuring a photograph of a No. 1a Pocket Kodak Series II and featuring a slogan "A New Folding Pocket Kodak" would not.32 Ads such as this began in the early 1890's, however they were not the primary means of advertising Kodak cameras at that time. Ultimately, I decided to work with advertisements between 1900 and 1925. I chose this time period for a number of reasons: it covers both the early days of Kodak and World War I; George Eastman was still alive and thus still partially responsible for advertisements; sources indicate that during this time period Eastman Kodak dealt with the same advertising agency (Seaman Advertising Agency) and in-house advertising director

(Lewis Bunnell Jones)33; and lastly because this time period would offer an opportunity to study how Kodak's ads changed from the early text-dominated pieces to the more image-based ads they became known for. As mentioned, this project began as an analysis geared exclusively to the image-based ads produced by Kodak. However, the realization that such an undertaking would also have to include the creation of a finding aid caused reevaluation of the material I was to survey. I understood that such a finding aid would be infinitely more useful if it included each advertisement in the binders, not just the image-based ads. Thus, I made the decision to include everything. The analysis of the image-based ads is still a part of this project however and therefore in the finding aid itself, advertisements are identified in part by their subject-- this subject is either a category prevalent in the image-based ads, or a product. When deciding what format my finding aid would take, I examined existing finder's tools in the GESC as well as The Richard and Ronay Menschel Library . While I understood the simplicity behind finder's tools that were paper based, I very much liked the versatility that a searchable spreadsheet supplied.34 I wanted my data to be searchable in a number of ways and so this seemed to be the ideal format. An Excel spreadsheet is versatile as well as easy to use. Additionally, it makes the process simple to import data into other, more complex database applications at a later time.

33. West, 24. 34. Lisa C. Hennessey, "The Mark A. Freeman Collection of World War II Photographs at George Eastman House" (master's thesis, Ryerson University, 2007).

22

The next challenge was the question of what to index in the ads themselves. I decided that because the image-based ads were more complex and would be further analyzed, I would include additional criteria for those ads specifically. However, I wanted a single spreadsheet that I could streamline for either type of ad (either image-based or product based). The headings I decided on were: Binder, Year, Slogan, Subject(s), Text, Implied Audience, Product, Photo or Illustration, Color or Black and White, Publications, and an additional field for a description and other notes (Description/Notes). Of these eleven sections, four were eliminated for the straightforward product advertisements: Text, Implied Audience, Photo or Illustration, and Color or Black and White. With headings established, I then began indexing the advertisements. In the twenty-five year period there were forty-three binders that were indexed. For the most part, duplicate advertisements were not counted, however this was not always the case. In some circumstances advertisements were identical with the exception of text, or imagery and so those ads would be counted. Indexing the ads took approximately three and a half months. Considering the total contents of the Kodak Advertising Collection is 708 binders, it is easy to see why no finding aid at the individual ad level has been tackled before-- it would take a enormous amount of time to complete. However, Kathy Connor, Curator of the GESC has indicated that with this twenty-five year period complete and able to be used as a template, she would like to solicit volunteers to begin working on the rest of the collection.

23

The layout of the finding aid is formatted to be ever ready and capable of expansion. Being an Excel document, further headings could be added if needed for later ads. It is my hope that Connor achieves this goal, and perhaps future Photographic Preservation and Collections Management students make this finding aid a part of their Institutional Service Hours. While having twenty-five years of the collection indexed makes a difference in the availability of the collection to a researcher, having the entire collection completed would be phenomenal.

24

Analysis Overview In total, the finding aid for the Kodak Advertising Collection consists of 2136 advertisements. Of these, 468 are image-based ads featuring a main subject that is not the product (and is almost always a person or group of people). As stated earlier, the majority of the time these ads are not selling a certain product, but are simply selling photography itself. All 468 ads can be placed into one of seven categories: women, children, family, farmers, travel and outdoors, labor, and soldiers. While an ad may belong to more than one category, and a category may target more than one type of person, every image-based ad counted in the finding aid can be slotted into one. The accompanying chart (fig 1) highlights how many ads feature each category, illustrating the popularity of each. In addition, examples of advertisements for each category can be found at the back of this thesis.

Figure 1. The seven categories in the finding aid.

25

Each of these categories was prevalent in advertisements of the time for many social and cultural reasons. It would be beyond the scope of this thesis to examine each category in depth, so I will choose one category-- soldiers-- and examine the driving factors behind its inclusion in this list, deconstruct two pertinent examples of the advertisements from the collection, and discuss the ways in which Kodak used the image of soldiers and war in their campaigns.

Advertising and the Media in America During WWI

"The war has been won by advertising, as well as by soldiers and munitions,"-- such was the opinion of professional advertiser's magazine Printers Ink after the armistice. 35 This sentiment seemed to be echoed by many, including George Eastman, who called advertisers "Cheerleaders of the Nation."36 Wartime advertisements were influenced in part by the Committee on Public Information, which was formed by Woodrow Wilson at the beginning of the war to positively influence the opinions of Americans regarding the war.37 While this committee oversaw advertising and helped to create American propaganda, it was not responsible for the large-scale bans on many wartime photographs. These were mandated by the American Expeditionary Force, the branch of the military that accompanied journalists

26

and photographers.38 As West states, "No photos that could affect the morale of the American soldier, the public at home, or the United States relation with the Allied governments were allowed to be taken." 39 These acts of propaganda and censorship combined to create an atmosphere of patriotism in America during the war. Unlike more recent wars, in which gruesome imagery from the front is beamed into ones home daily, contributing to an apathy or pacifist attitude felt by the American people, America in the grip of World War I was not entirely aware of the conditions faced by their men in the war-- or, if they were, they pretended not to be. This perceived image of the war was quite idealized and of course was quite different from the reality of conditions the soldiers faced in Europe. This view of war differs greatly with the American perception of the previous major war. The American Civil War, which took place only fiftytwo years prior to World War I, had been photographed in depth, and while the images were reliant on slow photographic processes, and therefore could not show the action of battle, they nevertheless showed the gruesome aftermath in great detail. Trachtenberg discusses the seminal Civil War photo book Gardner's Photographic Sketchbook of the Civil War in his paper, "Through a Glass, Darkly" He states that: "Gardner directs the reading of the photographs as visual equivalents of victory, of `union,' not simply in the sense of making a record of victory but by demanding in the act of interpretation how victory comes

38. West, 188. 39. Ibid., 189.

27

about." 40 Gardner's photographs show the realities of war, insofar as they include dead bodies, on both sides. While his book was not widely published, the photographs were well known and would have been part of the public consciousness by 1917. However, the public image of World War I was more in line with the cover of Gardner's-- an idyllic scene of a soldier's camp, with men socializing over a campfire, and no death or conflict.41 This scene is similar to the image of war taken up by Kodak, as will be shown in the analysis of individual advertisements. Kodak, along with other advertisers, kept an optimistic tenor to their ads during the war years. Never mentioning death or risk and instead focusing on the separation felt by those left in America allowed Kodak to advertise the ways in which the feeling of separation could be lessened for the soldiers by sending them photographs. Unlike other advertisements of the time, Kodak did not focus on the need for thrift and economy. Many corporations contributed to the wartime effort by encouraging their customers to be thrifty, for example advocating the conservation of food.42 By doing this, these corporations helped the propaganda machine, while making themselves seem favourable to the American people by advertising their support for the war. Conversely, Kodak positioned their products as a form of morale for soldiers, encouraging not only the sending of photographs overseas, but even sending cameras for "the boys," thus urging the consumer to

34. Trachtenberg, 126. 41. Ibid. 42. Brasted.

28

purchase quantities of film, paper, developing chemicals, etc. to keep up with the demand for these morale boosting photographs. Thriftiness was the message of other advertisers, whereas Kodak's message was to encourage patriotism by increasing communication to the soldiers "over there". Kodak was thus able to appear as patriotic as corporations advocating thrift without the economical hit.

29

Analysis of Ads

Pictured above are two examples of Kodak advertisements during the war. These ads feature very different imagery and each will be analyzed in this section. The first advertisement, with the slogan "Snap-Shots from Home" features a group of soldiers gathered outside a tent, looking at photographs. All the men in the ad are smiling, clean cut, and dressed in their uniforms. The image is close cropped, leaving out all details of the camp besides the tent. The text in the ad implores you to "Give cheer to the boys in camp and on shipboard by sending them pictures from home." 43 It goes on to note that "There are likely to be some tedious, homesick days and a little

30

cheer-up in the way of photographs from the home folks and the home doings will do them a lot of good." 44 The image itself is non-photographic in origin. More than any other category in the collection, soldier ads are most often non-photographic in nature. Despite the fact that the image supposedly depicts a war, there is no mention of battle in the ad copy. None of the soldiers in the image have guns or weapons of any kind on them. Additionally, none of the men even have insignia, rank, or identification of any kind on their uniforms. When looking at the advertisement, and ignoring the copy, what this ad resembles most are the ads for the Brownie Camera. Except, of course, in Brownie ads the people are all young boys. This ad concept-- of a group of people looking at photographs is used many times for Brownie Cameras over the twenty-five year period I worked with. By emulating a Brownie ad that the consumer has likely seen before, Kodak is inferring that the men are simply enjoying a day outdoors. This juxtaposition of settings created a sense of peace in the ad that helps to set the viewer's mind at ease. Joanne Karetzky emphasizes that the notion of an exchange of photographs with the troops is not one that was exclusive to Kodak.45 The cover of Ladies Home Journal for November 1918 featured a painting by Harold Brett entitled "His Thanksgiving" in which one soldier shows two others a photograph while they are standing in the trench, wearing helmets

44. Rochester, NY, George Eastman House George Eastman Legacy Collection, Kodak Advertising Collection, 1914-1916 5 of 5. 45. Karetzky, 26.

31

and holding guns.46 However, the photograph the soldier is holding is a studio one, greatly resembling a cabinet card, not the snapshots Kodak would have people making. The sentiment is the same however-- that the soldiers have little to remind them of home without the photographs sent from family. The second advertisement, captioned "The Kodak Letter" features a mother and child writing a letter to a soldier. The star in the window-- still a tradition in military families-- is a powerful symbol that this small family is affected by the war. The mother and child review the photographs as the camera sits on the windowsill. This advertisement greatly resembles many family ads run by Kodak before and after the war. What makes this image different is the presence of the star in the window. Also unlike the first ad, the copy here mentions the war itself. The text reads:
"The Star in the window tells the story-- their soldier is "over there" The morning letter of cheer and hope has been written and with it pictures are going, simple Kodak pictures that tell the home story,-- pictures will bring a cheery smile to his face, a leap of joy to his heart, that will keep bright the fire of courage in his soul as with the home image fresh in mind as he battles for the safety of that home and for the honor of his flag."47

West interprets this ad as creating an idealized image of a father, stating: "The stereotyped image of a state rather than of action transforms the soldier into the idealized father, and the family at home can `remember' him

46. Karetzky, 26. 47. NY, George Eastman House George Eastman Legacy Collection, Kodak Advertising Collection, Amateur Ads 1917-1920 1 of 4.

32

as such rather than as subject to the war's catastrophes." 48 Additionally, according to Susan Zeiger, this ad is demonstrating the "good mother" stereotype49: a woman who is the embodiment of a patriotic American. Zeiger compares this model to the stereotype of a "bad mother": a woman whose pre-disposition is to oppose the war due to motherly instincts, and feels the urge to keep boys close and therefore safe.50 Zieger's notion that "Wartime mass media took on the responsibility of persuading women that public duty was the higher road"51 is evident in this ad. While the woman is not a mother to the soldier in question, she is, nonetheless, a mother and stands to lose greatly from this war. However, the ad depicts her proudly displaying a star, sending photographs overseas to keep spirits high, and effectually doing her part in the war. Both ads, while different in subject matter, relate directly to soldiers. Both create an idealized picture of the war-- the first shows the act of war itself, and the second shows the soldiers fighting it. With these wartime advertisements, Kodak then manages to sell cameras, teach the American public how to photograph and use photography during a war, and to contribute to the American propaganda machine. No small feat for two images and some text. However, what neither advertisement mentions is the real reason that photographs are so important during wartime: a soldier who goes to war stands a good chance of being killed. This was likely at the front of the minds of family members who frantically photographed soldiers as
48. 49. 50. 51. West, 191. Zeiger, 7. Ibid., 5. Ibid.

33

they left their homes for the front, and also a driving reason to send cameras with them overseas, in order to capture their photographs for as long as possible. As Sandy Callister states: "What historians have overlooked is that, without bodies to grieve over, the medium of photography played an integral part in the representation of death and loss both during and after the war. Its role was both unanticipated and multivalent." 52 However, it is not something that would have been overtly stated in advertisements at the time, for many reasons: of censorship, good taste, and because the notion of death is something Kodak does not address.

WWI in Memory

The scope and effect of World War I was so great that it was hard to comprehend. Despite this, Kodak still needed to sell cameras during wartime. Indeed, these cameras had a purpose: not only to capture home life for the soldiers, but also to give to the soldiers so that they in turn could photograph the war. West addresses this in her book, saying that the focus on the collection of war photos and the encouragement of this exchange of photographs both ways between soldier and family contributed to the domestication of the war: "Here war gets collected as a subject for the family album, an episode in the narrative of domestic life, presumably along with the wedding, the baby's first steps, the graduation, and family vacations.

52. Callister, 665.

34

Kodak thus allows the war to be domesticated, in every sense of the word." 53 In creating a space for the war in the family album, and thus the family history, Kodak makes the war itself seem more digestible. It now resides alongside other milestones, and thus is given rank with them. The war cannot be a big, incomprehensible event if it fits neatly into a family album. Thus, the act of photographing the war, in the eyes of Kodak, is a form of treatment-- a means to make the situation make sense. As we will see, album making was a pastime taken up by many soldiers. This quaint Victorian parlor activity became an important act for many involved in the war. The idea of placing these war photographs in context alongside other life events, or, conversely isolating them in their own albums is something explored by others as well. Martha Langford speaks more about photographs from WWI in family albums in her book Suspended Conversations. Langford analyses four WWI era albums: two from soldiers, and two from nurses.54 Like West, Langford comments on the placement of war photos among domestic scenes in the album.55 One of these albums is made by a soldier who died in combat and his album features photographs of friends and family interspersed with photographs of life at the army training camp. The album did not follow him to France, and thus ends when he leaves for the war.56 Langford also chronicles a young woman who was a nurse during the war. Her album was begun at the start of her service and includes not only
53. 54. 55. 56. West, 193-196. Langford, 67-76. Ibid. Ibid.

35

snapshots, but also postcards, and newspaper clippings. At the conclusion of the war, this nurse continues to paste photos into the album of her later peacetime travels in Europe. "The extension of her wartime memoir into the twenties suggests that she viewed the war and its aftermath integrally, as a coming of age"57, Langford states, echoing West's "domestication" of the war. By defining the war as a coming of age experience, this nurse was labeling it, placing it among the other, definable points in her life. The album, with its easy transition, would help trick her memory in later years into thinking the war had been more manageable. Rob Kroes refers to photographs as a mnemonic device. He states that, "Revisiting old photographs, going over the family album is intended to trigger the reservoir of inner images, of memories" 58 Thus, by integrating war images with peace ones, the albummaker assures happy recollections in the future. This idea is echoed in Callister's article. She describes soldier's albums thusly: "Soldierphotographers who did survive the war, and subsequently compiled their own war albums, generally structured their war stories in highly conventional ways. Many of them ended their war albums with photographs of domestic scenes depicting their transition from soldier to civilian. These endings are the stories of survivors. The messages they typically convey are of deliberate acts of closure. They declare affirmatively that, `I am alive; the war is over, I am home again, back with my family, and I am looking forward to a future'."59

57. Langford, 73. 58. Kroes, 2. 59. Callister, 666.

36

These photographs were also highly prized after the war as memories of loved ones who died. In her article, Callister writes on the fact that soldier's bodies did not return home. Oftentimes, the only part of a soldier the family would have left was his photograph. "During this war," she wrote, "Kodak did more than help reinforce the family's centrality to society and more than create new consumer needs and markets. It helped construct and preserve the family as a photographic memory and as a social unit. In too many instances photographs were the last visible traces a solider had of his family and his family of him."60 This association of photograph to memory, simplistically pitched to customers through advertisements during the war encompassed so much of the hopes and fears of soldiers and their families. Families desired photographs of their boys "over there" both to reassure themselves that the boys were alive and well, and to act as a surrogate if the worst should happen and the soldier die in the war. Conversely, soldiers craved photographs of their families to add to their albums and remind them of home. As Callister put it: "Kodak was ideally placed to grow both the soldier and the domestic market."61 For soldiers who survived, the Kodak advertisements during the war must have seemed like a parody of the war itself. The idealized version of war portrayed in the ads would have contrasted greatly with their assembled photo albums, which were assumedly not solely the merry images of camp that Kodak predicted. However, as Tessa Morris-Suzuki notes in her book The Past Within Us: "It is only when we look at our own face in the fading
60. Callister, 665. 61. Ibid.

37

photograph that we understand how much we, and the world we live in, has altered with the passing of the years. The photograph album historicizes memory." Regardless if the photographs were pasted in a war album, or a family album beside a wedding, if the soldier lived or died-- the Kodak ads contributed to the propaganda and patriotism of wartime in America, and influenced many soldiers and families to send loved ones a photo. While one of the smallest categories in this period of Kodak advertisements, soldiers are one of the most unique. Created out necessity, this category completely overtook Kodak's advertising during the war years. The unique take on war, both at home and abroad, and its affect on American morale makes the wartime ads of Kodak a very interesting case study.

38

Conclusion The Kodak Advertising Collection is an important part of the George Eastman Study Center at the GEH. The 708 binders cover the history of the Eastman Kodak Company, until the 1980's making the collection integral to the study of Kodak advertisements. Current finding aids, while effective in narrowing down a search for advertisements within the collection, do not extend to the single ad level. With my creation of this finding aid, (focusing on the individual advertisements and recording relevant information such as slogans, subjects, target audience, years, and text), a new level of accessibility has been given to the years covered in this project. The ads referenced in this project are an excellent window into what was happening both with Kodak and in the world at that time. We see children engaging with their surroundings as never before with the Brownie Camera, women dominating the scene with confidence and class holding the first movie camera for public use, and soldiers leaving for war with the Kodak Autographic Camera under their arm or their happy reunions with loved ones made possible through pictures taken with this Kodak. In the twenty-five year period this project covers, Kodak is there to evolve and succeed along with the people of the day, making their lives easier and more meaningful. It is the goal of this finding aid to make these ads more accessible because they still have plenty to offer us. They are an example of how Kodak firmly shaped the way we take photographs today, they allow us to smile at the notion of needing a reminder to bring a camera along on a vacation, and

39

they give us a glimpse of nineteenth century life shot through the lens of a camera. The creation of this finding aid will enable greater intellectual access to the Kodak Advertising Collection, while helping to preserve it for future researchers by cutting unnecessary access. It is my hope that the project is continued, following guidelines laid out in this paper, so that the collection can be made even more accessible. The material contained in this collection is rare and unique, and thus deserves to be preserved and indexed for future researchers.

Collection Overview The Kodak Advertising Collection consists of 708 binders and scrapbooks. These are made up of several types of binders, as I am assuming availability changed over Kodak's history. For the twenty-five year

47

period I surveyed, the binders measured 15" wide, 17 Â½" high and approximately 2 Â½" deep. Each binder contains between 35 and 50 pages that are slipped into plastic protective sheets. The ads themselves are pasted to black or white paper and are sometimes accompanied by penciled-in notes (most often the date). In some cases there is also a date stamped onto the ad, though this is not consistent. These books were compiled by the Eastman Kodak Company and were donated to the George Eastman House in 2003. The collection covers more than 100 years of advertisements-- both tear sheets and printed ads-- from 1884 to 1988.

Memory plays strange tricks and one of its favorite vagaries is to fail in the all important matter of dates. But with a Kodak there's no uncertainty. The date--and title too, if you wish-is written on the autographic film at the time the exposure is made. And it is there permanently. It makes the Kodak story authentic and doubly interesting.

You do not , perhaps care anything about taking pictures (though many people think it great fun) but the pictures themselves you do care for when they are of people or places or things that are yours or that you are interested in. There's a personal, human touch in pictures of your home, your children, your broad meadows and your fine cattle. There's interest to you in pictures that tell the story of your auto trip, your camping party, or of the picnic where your children had such a good time. It is because such pictures have the personal appeal that, in millions of homes, the snap-shot album has become the most thought of book in all the house. Picture taking is very simple with a Kodak or Brownie, and less expensive than you think.
