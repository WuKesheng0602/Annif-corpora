Abstract FIBER BRAGG GRATING SENSORS FOR THE DETECTION OF METAL CRACK INITIATION BY LOW CYCLE FATIGUE TEST Master of Applied Science, 2012 KM Mahmud Hossain Electrical and Computer engineering, Ryerson University

Structural integrity is always an important issue for the service life time of any structure. Therefore, joint of the metal is also a vital point to consider. This thesis describes a new method that uses the Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor to detect the crack initiation of friction stir welded aluminum (AL) alloy by low cycle fatigue test. Experimental setups and procedures are studied, a proper test configuration is determined and a series of testing performed. The applicability of this new method of stress control fatigue test in monitoring the metal crack initiation is demonstrated through the test results, which shows that FBG sensors are sensitive to capture the onset of the crack. Stress controlled fatigue tests especially at high strain amplitude for Friction Stir Welded (FSW) joints demand the sensors to withstand strain level above ±8000 µ [40] and with the size of few mm, and these sensors are not available in the market. In this work, the new sensors arrays are used in the characterization of cyclic deformation behavior of FSW aluminum alloy, which, in some cases, could sustain up to ±11000µ. During the experiment significant difference in plastic strain amplitude (PSA) was observed using these optical fiber sensors mounted in nugget zone (NZ) and across the boundary area between thermo mechanical affected zone (TMZ) and heat affected zone (HZ). For all the samples of Al alloy, with the progress of cyclic deformation the cyclic hardening characteristics of the metal were observed.

Chapter 1 1. Introduction The low density metals like aluminum and magnesium alloys are becoming more attractive than the conventional materials due to their high strength and also to high strength to weight ratios [1]. The technology of optical fibres has progressed very rapidly in recent years. Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) is one of the key components in modern optical fiber communications and sensor systems. Many applications have been identified and demonstrated and the gratings are also available commercially. FBG has also become very popular because of its high dynamic range, immunity to electromagnetic interference and its multiplexing capability [2]. FBG's as short as 1 to 5 mm length, can be made on fibers of 125 µm in cladding diameter and was used in localized strain measurements recently [3]. However, FBG has a limitation of obtaining less strain reading than the true substrate strain with conventional bonding method due to the limited contact area between the fiber and substrate and due to shear modulus of the epoxy. Typically the FBG sensor is used when the strain variation is less than 3000µ [1]. To overcome this problem, a new type of FBG sensor and a more robust bonding process are developed to measure high strain amplitude, to detect crack- initiation and to observe the metal behavior change with varying stress level. In this thesis, it is demonstrated that the strain amplitude up to ± 11000 µ can be reached by using flat-cladding FBG sensors applied to the fatigue test of aluminum alloy substrates. In tests, asymmetric hysteresis loops and non-uniform hardening and softening in the different zones of the alloy substrate was observed. The FBG sensors could also be applied to measure the localized strain variations to measure the distributed strain in materials and to monitor the structural health.

2. Literature Survey Low-cycle fatigue tests subject specimens to repeated stress or strain until failure occurs at a relatively small number of cycles. The upper limit in lower cycle life has generally been selected arbitrarily by individual investigators to lie in the range of 104 to 105 cycles [4]. Investigations in low-cycle fatigue have been conducted either (a) to provide information concerning a particular problem or (b) to obtain fundamental information. In this test, it is to obtain the information regarding the crack initiation and metal changing behaviour with increasing stress level and to monitor by using FBG sensors. When the applied stresses are low and within the elastic range of the material, the strain is directly proportional to the stress and there is either little or no difference between tests based on controlled strain or stress limits. In the case of low-cycle fatigue tests however, the applied stresses are generally high enough to cause plastic deformation and corresponding hysteresis in the stress-strain behaviour. If, in such tests, the load limits are maintained constant, the limits of deformation or strain will vary through at least some part of the life and vice versa. Therefore, low-cycle fatigue tests need to be further identified as constant-stress or constant­deformation tests. A limited number of exploratory tests controlling limits of "true" stress have been conducted by Lin and Kirsch [4]. In spite of the fact that extreme care was exercised monitoring these "true" stress limits, large scatter occurred in the test results because of the difficulty of controlling the "true" stress in low-cycle fatigue tests. There is some low-cycle fatigue tests reported in which the specimens were subjected to repeated applications of high temperature. Tests in which cyclic heat was used to introduce constant de formation ranges to the specimen have been included in this report as constant-deformation type tests [1].

2.1 Optical Fiber Sensing: Optical fibre, being a physical medium, is subjected to animation of one kind or the other at all times. The response to external influence is deliberately enhanced in fibre optic sensing so that the resulting change in optical radiation can be used as a measure of the external perturbation. Optical Fibre when used as a transducer, converts measurements data like temperature, stress, strain, rotation or electric and magnetic currents into a corresponding change in the optical radiation. The light is characterized by amplitude (intensity), phase, frequency and polarization. Any one or more of these parameters may undergo a change when subjected external
2

perturbation. The usefulness of the fiber optic sensor therefore depends upon the magnitude of this change and also on the ability to measure and quantify the same reliably and accurately [5].

2.2 FBG Review 2.2.1 FBG The periodic structures of gratings give them wavelength dependent properties. A grating is a repetitive array of diffracting elements (apertures or obstacles) which has the effect of producing periodic alterations in the phase, amplitude, or both of an emergent wave [6]. Group delay is an important characteristic of FBG and can be tailored for dispersion compensation. FBG has a central lobe and is mainly used in reflection. 2.2.2 Applications of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) Sensors: Like other implementations of fibre optic sensors, the FBG is ideal for use in electrical power industry due to its immunity to electromagnetic interference. Loading of power transmission lines, winding temperature of electrical power transformers have been measured with the FBG sensor [7] [8]. For Load Monitoring of Power Transmission Lines a multiplexed FBG sensor array can be used. The load change is simply converted into strain via a metal plate attached to the line and onto which the FBG is bonded. Obviously many more sensors are required for such an application. This is an excellent example of applying FBG sensors for long-distance remote monitoring in harsh environments [7] [8]. Winding temperature measurement for defective or degraded equipment can be detected by continuously monitoring the variations in the winding temperature, which reflects the performance of the cooling system. FBG sensors are one of the best choices for this application [7] [9]. A range of miniature fiber optic sensors based on intensity modulation has been successfully commercialized in recent years for using in medicine [7] [8]. The FBG sensor can also be used for the measurement of the heart's efficiency based on the flow-directed thermo dilution catheter method in which doctors inject a cold solution into patients to measure their heart's blood output. A flow directed thermo dilution catheter is inserted into the right atrium of the heart, allowing the solution to be injected directly into the heart for measurement of the temperature of the blood in the pulmonary artery. By combining temperature readings with pulse rate, doctors can determine how much blood the heart pumps. Such a type of catheter with an FBG sensor has been used for replacement of a conventional
3

catheter [7] [9]. Fibre optic sensors could be ideal for applications in the oil and gas industry due to their inherent advantages, such as being intrinsically safe, immune to EMI, workable at high temperature, capable of multiplexing, and minimally invasive [7][8]. FBG sensors can be used in pipeline in order to monitor the temperature in the pipe or the pressure on the joins. Because refractive index of these fibre is sensitive to pressure and temperature, one can monitor all the length of the pipe by one fibre by using multiplexing methods [7] [8].

2.2.3 Power Reflectivity Spectrum The operation of FBG depends on the reflection of light from grating fringes and coupling of the modes. In a single mode FBG, the coupling occurs between the forward and backward propagating fields of the same mode. The maximum reflectivity is obtained at the wavelength providing the Bragg condition [10]. B = 2neff  .......... (1)

Here, neff,  and B , represent the effective refractive index of the core, grating period and Bragg wavelength, respectively. A uniform Bragg grating has a constant grating period. The optical characteristics of a FBG can be determined from its reflectivity spectrum, which shows the wavelength range of operation and bandwidth. The reflectivity spectrum of the grating can be calculated numerically using matrix transfer method [10]. In Figure 1, the power reflectivity spectrum of uniform FBG with a 10 mm length is shown for different index difference ( neff) values.

Fiugre1, Power reflectivity spectrum of uniform fibre reflection gratings (From reference 14, Section III.) Increasing the chirp parameter broadens the reflection spectrum but decreases the reflectivity power for a certain grating length. On the other hand, if the grating length increases, group delay of the reflection band and therefore dispersion compensated bandwidth increases [10].

2.2.4

Strain Sensitivity of FBG:

The strain sensitivity is caused by the physical elongation of the FBG period and photo elastic effects. The effective refractive index (neff) and the grating period () are important factors in determining the wavelength of the FBG. Both factors are very sensitive to ambient changes; therefore, the central wavelength is left tunable in terms of strain, temperature, pressure, voltage, magnetic field etc. The stretching or the compression of the fiber changes the grating period, and the refractive index which changes the central wavelength of the FBG by increasing or decreasing its value. When the FBG is subjected to disturbance like strain, the change in the central wavelength can be found by a partial differentiation of the central wavelength with respect to the length taken that the effect of temperature is discarded. The strain sensitivity of typical FBG sensors is between 1 to 5 µ determined by the accuracy of the wavelength measurement of the instrument used.

2.3 Stress Concentration A stress concentration is formed when there is a discontinuity in the geometry, structure, or temperature in a material although the term "stress concentration" generally refers to the stress increase resulting from a notch in a member. According to the elasticity theory, a stress concentration factor, which is the ratio of the maximum stress to the nominal stress in the member, can be computed for most types of notches. Another stress factor which is used in fatigue studies is the "effective stress concentration factor", defined as the ratio of the fatigue strength of an un-notched specimen to that of a notched specimen. At the present time, the effective stress concentration factor can only be obtained by experimental means [4]. A great amount of effort has been devoted to studies of the effects of stress concentrations in fatigue. It is generally found that the material in the region near a stress concentration deforms plastically in most fatigue tests. This is especially true in low-cycle fatigue tests where the applied stresses are high. This yielding affects the stress concentration in the way of: (a) The ratio of the maximum stress to the average stress is no longer a constant; and (b) The geometry of the notch, which is the basis for the calculation of the theoretical stress concentration changes. In addition, work hardening is generally introduced in the vicinity of the tip of the notch, and a new complication results from the non-uniformity of the material. Consequently, the theoretical stress concentration factor for a notched specimen becomes a fictitious quantity when, yielding of the material occurs at the notch. However, since it is desirable to use numerical values in representing the severity of various notches, the theoretical stress concentration factor is often useful for purposes of comparison [4].

2.4 Extent and Rate of Cyclic Hardening and Softening In cyclic stress controlled fatigue test, the stress is held constant during cycling. The stress-strain response during cycling can change; as plastic deformation is not completely reversible though elastic strain is reversible. The metal can undergo cyclic strain hardening or cyclic strain softening, or remain stable [11]. By recording strain variation as function of cycle character of the material can be analyzed. Hardening indicates increased resistance to deformation and the plastic region of the loop reduced with pronounced hardening characteristics of the sample. On the other hand, softening
6

indicates decreased resistance to deformation and the plastic region was expanded and the hysteresis loop area was enlarged.

Figure 2(b) Cyclic Hardening

Deformation can be observed according to cyclic stress- strain curves from figure 2(a) and 2(b) (a) Cyclic Softening: When a material cyclically softens, the cyclic stress is considerably lower than the monotonic yield stress. (b) Cyclic Hardening: During cyclic hardening of the material, the yield stress is higher than the monotonic yield stress .When considerable plastic strains are present; by applying monotonic properties the elastic strain can be predicted. In general, metals with high monotonic strain exponents undergo cyclic hardening and with low strain hardening exponents undergo cyclic softening. Determining metal behavior cyclically was proposed by Smith et al [12] and expressed as: If the ratio of tensile strength Su and yield strength Sy is greater than 1.4 then hardening is expected. Su/S0.2%y > 1.4 expressed as, Su / S0.2%y < 1.2 2.5 Study of Hysteresis Area within a hysteresis loop is energy dissipated during a cycle. It represents plastic work from the cycle. Change in deformation behavior, is more at the beginning of cyclic loading and then gradually stabilizes with continued cycling. A transition from cyclic hardening response to cyclic softening response with increasing applied plastic strain amplitudes or increasing cyclic stress amplitudes can be observed in many of the cases with technical purity of aluminum alloys [13]. It is worth mentioning that Kunz et al. [13] [14] have reported that cyclic softening, is observed
7

(1)

On the other hand if this ratio is less than 1.2 then cyclic softening is to be expected and

(2)

in strain controlled tests, whereas load controlled tests generally yield cyclic hardening or cyclic saturation response. According to some experts, both strain controlled and load controlled tests can detect cycle hardening, cyclic softening, and cyclic stabilization. However, the cyclic plastic strain imposed on to the samples are lower in many of the reported stress controlled tests [13-1415] compared to that of the strain controlled tests [13] [16]. As such, the observation of cyclic softening only in the case of strain controlled tests and cyclic hardening/saturation in the load controlled tests reported in [13] [16]. It should be noted that in some cases for aluminum alloys, the cyclic softening response is preceded by a cyclic hardening response [13] [17-18].

2.6 Fatigue crack initiation, propagation and ultimate failure study Fatigue Crack Propagation: Linear elastic fracture mechanics assumes that all structures contain flaws. Cracks grow from an initial size to a critical size corresponding to failure as a function of the number of load cycles .The crack growth rate can be determined from the PSA slope of the curve. Initially, crack growth rate is slow but increases with increasing crack length and of course, the crack growth rate is also higher for higher applied stresses [19]. Stress Relief Cracking (Stress relaxation): Reheat cracking is kind of inter granular cracking in the HAZ or weld metal occurs during the stress relief heat treatment or during service at high temperature [20]. According to Tiawen Zhao et al. [23] materials of different types exhibit different fatigue cracking behavior in the transient zone after an overload is applied. Most materials show, the crack growth rate first from to a minimum value and then increases rapidly to the stable value under constant amplitude loading. Some material corresponds to an acceleration of the crack growth rate immediately after overloading [23]. A high overload can also result in the arrest of crack growth. From scholarly articles and especially from reference [19-25] it is learnt that fatigue is a problem that can affect any part or component that moves. Basic factors necessary to cause fatigue are: (a) a maximum tensile stress of sufficiently high value, (b) a large enough variation or fluctuation in the applied stress, and (c) a sufficiently large number of cycles of the applied stress. The fatigue strain-life curve tends toward the plastic curve at large strain amplitudes and toward the elastic curve at small strain amplitudes. Fatigue crack nucleation and growth occurs in the following stages.

8

(i) Stage I: Crack initiation usually starts at a notch or other surface discontinuity. Even in the absence of a surface defect, crack initiation will eventually occur due to the formation of persistent slip bands (PSBs), which are a result of the systematic buildup of fine slip movements. The back-and-forth movement of the slip bands leads to the formation of intrusions and extrusions at the surface, eventually leading to the formation of a crack. The initial crack propagation rate during stage I was very low, and produce a practically featureless fracture surface. The crack initially follows the slip bands at approximately 450 to the principal stress direction. When the crack length becomes sufficient for the stress field at the tip to become dominant, the overall crack plane changes and becomes perpendicular to the principal stress, and the crack enters stage II. (ii) Stage II: Crack growth occurs when the stage I crack changes direction and propagates in a direction normal to the applied stress. Crack growth proceeds by a continual process of crack sharpening followed by blunting. Frequently, visible examination of a fatigued surface will reveal a series of concentric markings on the surface, which is referred to as beach marks .These are present as a result of stress changes during fatigue [11]. (iii) Stage III: Ultimate failure occurs when the fatigue crack becomes long enough that the remaining cross section can no longer support the applied load. Finally, in region III, the crack growth rate accelerates, since the fracture toughness of the material is approached, and there is a local tensile overload failure [11].

2.7

Significant Contribution of the Thesis

During the experiment three FBG sensors were surface mounted on the top side of all the FSW AA2219 aluminum alloy samples in order to monitor the onset of crack initiation and the behavior of metal specified zones (Nugget, Heated and Thermo-mechanical affected). Effort was made to obtain high quality bonding strength and with the flat cladding FBG sensors strain amplitude of up to ±11000µ was reached. Significant changes of plastic strain amplitude (PSA) slope was observed in the last few cycles which corresponds to metal crack initiation, propagation and the ultimate failure.

The size of the specimen was 140 mm x 9mm x 6mm and the gauge section was 35mm x6.39mm x 5.69mm, which was machined perpendicular to the FSW direction. There are four zones in this 35 mm long section, namely, nugget zone (NZ), thermo mechanically affected zone (TMAZ), heat affected zone (HAZ) and base metal. The FBG sensors, each having a length of 4 mm were surface mounted in the centre of NZ and across TMAZ and NZ.

3.3.2 Friction Stir Welding (FSW): Structural application of Al alloys involve welding and joining, which are challenging using conventional fusion welding processes. Therefore, robust joining techniques are required to expand the applications of Al alloys. Friction stir welding (FSW), which was invented by The Welding Institute (TWI) of UK [26-1], provides a promising solution since it is an environmentfriendly and energy-effective solid-state joining technique. This offers significant benefits over conventional joining processes due to the absence of the fusion zone [26-4]. This joining technique has been proven to be one of the good alternatives especially for the lightweight aerospace materials such as 2xxx-series aluminum alloys.

3.3.3

Friction Stir Welded AA2219 Al Alloy Material: The nominal of AA2219-T62

aluminum alloy plate has the chemical composition [26] of following: Table 1: Chemical composition (wt %): Cu 6.48 Mn 0.32 Fe 0.23 Ti 0.06 V 0.08 Zn 0.04 Si 0.49 Zr 0.2 and Balance Al

Before FSW, the surface oxides were removed and then cleaned using ethanol. The FSW tool had a shoulder of 34 mm in diameter and a threaded (left-handed screw) cone-shaped pin of 13.5 mm in root diameter and 9.3 mm in tip diameter, and was rotated clockwise [26]. With a tool rotational rate at 300 rpm and traverse/welding speed of 80 mm/min the FSW was performed. The tilt angle of rotational tool was set to 2.8° with respect to Z-axis of FSW machine [27]. Cooling water was sprayed onto the welding tool and on the top surface of weld. The cross section of the welded joint was ground with water abrasive papers, and then polished using diamond paste up to 1  m [26].It was then etched with Keller's reagent (1 ml hydrofluoric acid, 1.5 ml hydrochloric acid, 2.5 ml nitric acid and 95 ml distilled water), then the microstructure was examined using a light microscope in conjunction with an image analysis system [26]. Subsized tensile specimens with a gauge length of 35 mm (i.e., a parallel length of 32mm) and width of 6 mm in accordance with ASTM E8M standards, were cut perpendicularly to the welding directions (or the rolling direction for the base material) and sliced equally into three pieces (top, middle and bottom) in the thickness direction, and then machined to the required dimensions
13

using the electro-discharge wire cutting [26]. The gauge area of specimens was ground with SiC papers up to grit 600 along the loading axis to get rid of the cutting marks and to achieve a smooth surface [26]

3.3.4 Tensile properties and strain hardening behavior of FS W AA2219 Al Alloy: Strain-hardening behavior is one of the important considerations in the evolution of plastic deformation of materials [26-5,6], thus numerous investigations in this aspect have been conducted. For example, strain hardening of ultrafine-grained copper with nano scale twins was studied by Chen and Lu [26-6]. Afrin et al. [26-7] reported that the hardening capacity and the strain hardening exponent of a friction stir welded (FSW) magnesium alloy were about twice and threefold higher than that of the base alloy. A novel microstructure-based strain-hardening model for a precipitate-hardened aluminum alloy 6005A-T6 after FSW was developed by Simar et al. [26-8]. The main changes in the tensile properties of the welds were explained via the differences in the strain-hardening behavior which controlled the strength and resistance to plastic localization. In particular, the lower strength in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) compared with the weld nugget zone (NZ).

Experiments 4.1 FBG Bonding Procedure on Substrate 4.1.1 Tools used for Bonding: Sample, Sand papers (320,600, LPA12), Flat clad fiber grating, Glue, Foil paper, Blue tape, Scissor, Knife, Marker, Weight, Rubber sheet, scale, Alcohol, Aluminum foil tape , a piece of stripped out fiber to put glue on substrate, Non-stick paper, Calculator, Micrometer and Nonstick metal tray, a table /chart to keep information of substrate FBG sensors and test

information: this table should have the file name relating substrate number, test date and particular MPa. 4.1.2 Bonding Steps: (a) Grinding and Cleaning: ground the sample using sand paper 320, and aluminum oxide LPA 12 micron at 90o and clean with Gasoline and alcohol. (b) Glue Preparation: Prepare epoxy glue (9:1) and preserve in refrigerator. For example, [Epoxy 353ND (part A) = 9 and hardener (part B) =1. If epoxy weights 1.3746 gm, the hardener will be 1.374/9= 0.1527 gm and total mixture will be (1.3746+0.1527= 1.5273gm)]. (c) Procedure: Before using glue, measure sample cross section (width and thickness at three points and considering the one with small value) for applying stress data during fatigue test. Mark the substrate with corresponding measurements of fiber grating. Mark the sample both side (keeping 70 mm approximately in the center) and fix it with fatigue test fixture machine at mechanical lab. Place the flat clad fiber grating keeping marked end at the right side. To confirm the alignment of the fiber with the facet facing up, check it under microscope. Then tape two aluminum foils on the substrate to form a trench with the fiber sensors in the middle to confine the epoxy. Put a thin layer of glue uniformly without any bubble and place a non stick transparent paper or thin film paper (which is used to cover the display of cellular telephone set) on the glue or cover with yellow plain rubber sheet (when non-stick paper is used). Put weight covering all sensors to ensure a good contact between the fiber and substrate.

4.3 4.3.1

Fatigue Test of FS Welded Al alloy AA2219 Low cycle Fatigue:

Low- cycle fatigue is when the number of cycles to failure is small (typically the number of cycles to failure, Nf, is less than 1000 and high-cycle fatigue is when the number of cycles to failure is large (typically the number of cycles to failure, Nf is greater than 1000). The data evaluation of low-cycle fatigue of metal depends on the type of test, cyclic rate, stress concentration, crack propagation, material property change, and method of analysis. Low-cycle fatigue tests subject specimen to repeated stress or strain until failure occurs at a relatively small number of cycles. Some investigator has generally selected the upper limit of lower cycle life in the range of 104 to 105 cycles; but to some investigator, the lower limit of life cycle is below approximately 104 [22] [1]. Low cycle fatigue is relevant to the structures where at high stress and at low number of cycles the failure occurs. For example, the power generator structures that operates at an elevated temperature and faces significant stresses. The microscopic plastic
19

deformation occurs at low cycle fatigue. But in view of high stress level, final failure will occur even when the cracks are still small [1].

4.3.2 Stress Control fatigue testing procedure: A closed loop servo hydraulic axial load frame is used to conduct the test, where the test system uses the stress output to provide feedback to the servo controller. system's Figure 6 and figure 7 are the stress and strain controlled fatigue testing schematic diagram and photo respectively. The push pull type fatigue tests were

carried out using a computer controlled Instron fatigue testing system (Instron Fast Track 8800, Norwood. MA).  A triangular waveform of stress signal was applied at a constant stress rate of 25 MPa increment. The substrate sample was tested for 100 cycles in each stress level, starting from 50 MPa until failure.   During this Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) tests the wavelength shifts of FBGs were recorded by interrogator (Si 425, Micron Optics). Then this shift was converted to strain. The applied load (stress value) was known and strain and stress values were recorded as a function of time for each fatigue cycle.

In experiments, the cyclic stress was applied from 50 MPa which continued till 275 MPa or 300 MPa for two samples respectively with a 25 MPa increment. The failure at 275 MPa for FSW sample 3B24 and at 300 MPa for sample 2T25 were observed.

5.2 Corresponding behavior with a previous researcher (Strain controlled LCF Test) by C. Li, "The Fiber Optic Sensing array for Fatigue LCF Tests", [28] where it was observed:

Figure 8(a) at cyclic strain level of 0.8%, 8(b) at cyclic strain level of 0.9% of sample7Bm25 Plot represents maximum stress from 1st cycle to 100th cycle at cyclic strain amplitude of 0.8% and 0.9% respectively. The maximum stress at cyclic strain amplitude of 0.8% increased from 482.66 MPa at 1st cycle to 493.97 MPa at 100th cycle. However, at cyclic strain amplitude of 0.9%, the maximum stress started from 478.59 MPa, reaching its highest value of 509.34 at 83 th cycle, then decreased to 507.23 MPa at 94th cycle when it was broken.

Figure 9(a) at cyclic strain level of 0.8%, 9(b) at cyclic strain level of 0.9% of sample 7BM20 Plot represents maximum stress from 1st cycle to 100th cycle at cyclic strain amplitude of 0.8% and 0.9% respectively. At cyclic strain amplitude of 0.8%, the maximum stress increased monotonously from 480.73 MPa at 1st cycle to 495.93 MPa at 100th cycle. Comparing with the 7BM25, the same trend was observed at cyclic strain amplitude of 0.9%, the maximum stress started from 477.57 MPa, reaching maximum of 515.19 at 71th cycle, then

22

decreased to 499.99 MPa until it was broken. This sample was broken at 90th cycle of cyclic strain amplitude of 0.9% In view of the experiment result I have also observed the identical behavior of the material with C. Li's experiment, especially the significant changes happen at last few cycles with highest stress level before the ultimate crack. Sample 3B24 broke at 50th cycle at 275 MPa and the significant change was observed between 40th cycles to 50th cycle. Sample 2T25 broke at 34th cycle at 300 MPa stress level and plastic strain amplitude slope changing between 25th cycles to 34th cycle. These will be verified with my experiment result and plotting in subsequent sections.

5.3

Study of Crack Initiation and Propagation

The PM (Philosophical Magazine) theory on crack propagation, originally developed for longlife fatigue tests, was expanded by Head [29] to include the low-cycle range of fatigue tests. The theory, based on an idealized material and consisting of elastic, elastic-shear and fully plastic elements, indicates that (a) Cracks may initiate at an early stages of fatigue test, (b)The inverse square-root of crack length is a linear function of the number of cycles, (c)The slope of the straight line (square root of the crack length versus number of cycles) is a function of magnitude of the applied stresses. However, at present, there is little or no experimental evidence available to support this theory in the low-cycle field. McClintock [30] found that, at high strain amplitudes: (a) Cracks always tend to grow toward the center of the remaining section: that is, "the point most distant from the boundaries". (b) The crack propagation depended upon the integrated absolute strain increments regardless of time, number of cycles and cyclic strain increments, (c) Cracks propagate faster in the larger of any two geometrically similar specimens under the same nominal strain amplitude, In this experiment, specimens of Friction Stir Welded AA219-T62-T6 aluminum alloy were subjected to a selected number of cycles to examine the deformation behaviour and for crack initiation detection. From the number of tests conducted, it appears that the theoretical hypotheses mentioned above are in general accord with the experimental result. From the test

23

cracking initiated and the characteristics of crack growth were studied. In the test sample three sections like crack initiation, crack propagation, and the ultimate failure were observed. This is further explained in subsequent sections with plastic strain amplitude (PSA) and different strain values as a function of fatigue cycles at different applied stress level. In the following table the sections are mentioned: Table 3: Summary of Metallurgical Evaluation of Test Specimens #3B24 and 2T25 Al- alloy sample Detail # 3B24(Bottom slice)is the one from series 24 Findings Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) crack initiation at the heated zone which is close to boundary started initiation about 41st cycle and the failure occurred 3mm away from sensor #3 and 10.5 mm from S2 at 50th cycle of 275 MPa stress and the sample was ultimately broken into two pieces, [Figure 3(a), figure10(a) and later justified with fig. 14(b)] # 2T25 (Top slice) is the one from series 25. Crack initiation started occurring at the beginning of the cycle where slope goes upward(1st - 5th cycle) showing softening (crack initiation), then (6th -24th cycle)it is reducing linearly showing hardening (crack propagation)and after that changing slope up mean softening and then hardening ( rapid crack growth) between 27th cycle to 34th cycle. The crack was 16mm away from S2 .It was broken into two pieces at 34th cycle of 300 MPa stress level, [figure 3(b) ,figure 10(b)and later justified with fig. 14(g)]

Strain Behavior of FBG sensors:

5.4.1 Sample 3B24: Strain curve as a function of time for three sensors plotted as shown below: At 250 MPa for sample 3B24 the deformation was less and at 275MPa only sensors 2 sustained which was placed in the NZ. The bonding strength of sensors (S1, S3) at the edges were not as strong as S2, which is at the center; this could also be an issue to break these sensors at this stage. In NZ, the material did not deform as much a sin the HZ and TMAZ, and the FBG bonding remains stable. By observing figure 11(a) and 11(b) for S2 at 250 MPa, the strain as a function of time shows large strain amplitude at the beginning and decreases towards the end cycles. At 275 MPa due to more deformation of FSW aluminum the strain amplitude was different at many cycle points.

Strain curve as a function of time for three sensors as shown below: 275 MPa stress level was applied. Sensor 3 could not sustain further to interrogate the test characteristics, figure 11(c).The reason for breaking Sensor 3 could be the bonding issue as this was located at the edge but sensor 1 and sensor 2 sustained the stress. The time vs. strain curve shows that the sample material became harder with time. Figure 11 (d) showed that with the increase stress level at 300 MPa, sensor2 sustained up to the crack point and it happened at 34th cycle. AT the beginning of 275 MPa S2 Strain amplitude is almost ±5500µ and after 90th cycle it has reduced to ±4000µ. And at 300 MPa the starting strain was about ±5000µ and ended with about ±4500µ, which shows that with the increasing of fatigue cycles strain amplitude reduced.

Figure 12(a), Tension loading 12(b), Compression Loading 12(c) Tension Loading followed by compression. According to Smith et al [31] at frequencies of less than 1000 cpm the fatigue strength generally decreases with a decrease in cyclic rate. They recommended the use of a cyclic rate of between 50 and 100 cpm for low-cycle fatigue tests to (a) avoid the generation of excessive heat in the specimens, (b) keep test' time within a reasonable length, and (c) reduce to a minimum the speed effect. According to H. Zyad [32] the basic stress-strain curve characterizes of plastic stress-

strain response of the material for the major part of the fatigue life, and is one of its most important fatigue characteristics. The strain hardening exponent (n) and the strength coefficient (k) were determined by plotting the stable stress amplitude against the axial plastic strain amplitude on a logarithmic scale for both alloys are superimposed for comparison, which shows that the value of (n) and (k) of the alloy AA7020-T6 more than of the alloy AA2024-T6. This means the high movement dislocation that produced from internal strain about precipitation atoms was occurred, and provided more grain boundaries to prevent crack propagation than in alloy AA2024-T6.

For sample 2T25, at 275 MPa stress level the deformation was observed quite large and sensor 3 failed to respond and the reason for failing could be the bonding issue as it was located at the edge of the gauge area. Sensor1 and sensor2 both shows steady hardening characteristics with cycle as shown in figure 13(f), 13(g) where the strain ranges (1st cycle 5705µ to 100th 5342µ to 3965µ for S2) respectively. Sensor1 with the shortest cycle3965 µ for S1 and

wavelength was located closer to blue mark and at this point S1 was subjected to maximum stress which caused it to break. Another reason could be the bonding issue as it was located at the edge of the gauge area. But S2, as shown in figure 13(i), responded till last cycle of sample failure. In both the case I observed the same deformation characteristics. The strain range for each sensor and cycle are different due to the following factors: (a) At different locations the material characters of the sample are different. This in turn results the difference in strain amplitude. (b) As the fatigue life of the material is inversely proportional to strain, with the increase in cycles the strain of the sensors decreases. In our experiment mostly decrease was observed.

5.6 Plastic strain amplitude (PSA) analysis: The cyclic deformation response is expected to be influenced by the applied cyclic stress or strain, more importantly by the cyclic plastic strain. Such influence from the applied cyclic plastic strain is evidence from the observed transition from cyclic hardening to cyclic softening with increasing applied cyclic plastic strain [13].

5.6.1

Behavior Analysis of material from PSA curve:

In LCF, PSA is a physical quantity that initiates several damaging process and influences the internal microstructure which eventually affects the strain resistance and finally the fatigue life. The cyclic deformation response of metal ranging from cyclic hardening to cyclic softening depends on various factors like the purity of the metal, the level of the imposed cyclic stress/strain, and the processing parameters [13]. In figure 14(a, b, c, d) of the test results it was observed that when total strain amplitude increases PSA also increases and fatigue life decreases. During initial few cycles the curves change was steep, after initial few cycles the slope becomes

36

steady with the increase of the number of cycles. In both samples of 3B24 and 2T25 the gradual cyclic hardening of the material and gradual decreases of sensors PSA was observed. For sample number 3B24 at 250 MPa stress level in figure 14(a) PSA range of sensor 1 (0.04% to .025%) had steadily reduced, indicating gradual hardening. The PSA range of sensor2 (0.15% to 0.002%) showed the same behavior like sensor1.PSA range of sensor 3 (.022% to .0053%) showing similar hardening. In figure 14(b) at 275 MPa stress level, for sensor 2 the PSA (0.018 to 0.0051%) showed the significant hardening of the material up to the crack which occurred at 50th cycle. However, S1 and S3 failed at this level, initial two cycles were very sharp and they became steady with fatigue cycles.

at 275 MPa it reduces the PSA%(.02% to .01%) showing more deformation and more hardening. (ii) Again, from 31st cycle till last at 250MPa it reduces the PSA% (.006% to .0025%).On

the other hand, at 275 MPa the changes are .01% to .0051%, which showed more hardening and deformation of the FSW.

5.6.4 For sample 2T25 at 275 MPa stress level figure 14(e), both sensor 1 and sensor2 are showing almost identical PSA change which ranging (0.014 % to 0.002% and 0.15% to 0.002%). The hardening is also gradual and significant. At 300 MPa level, sensor 1 could monitor only up to 10th cycle and more observations could not be obtained but sensor2 could respond up to the crack point (34th cycle). I can notice from figure 14(g), that the PSA from 0.13% to .008% was significant hardening of the material. Here also I observed the same behavior like other samples of softening with initial few cycles.

Figure 14(f) PSA% of S1as a function of cycles At 300 MPa level sensor 1 could monitor only up to 10th cycle and more observations could not be obtained. But sensor2 could respond up to the crack point (34th cycle) and noticed from figure 14(g) that the PSA% (0.13% to .008%) which is significant hardening of the material. Here also it is observed the same behavior like other samples of softening with initial few cycles.

PSA curve

Fitted line slope changes showing less hardening (26th cycle)

Figure 14(g), PSA curve and linear fit from cycle 7 to 21

The PSA curve plotted at 275 MPa for sample 2T25 [figure 14(g)] showed the following characteristics: (i) In initial five cycles the PSA increased from .0108% to .013% and material Showed softening characteristic which could be interpreted as crack initiation.
40

(ii) From the 6th cycle till 25th cycle the PSA value was reducing almost linearly (from .0129% to .0091%), indicating cyclic hardening characteristics as shown in the fitted line in figure 14(g) and this could indicate crack propagation . (iii) After 25th cycle the PSA slope started to deviate significantly from the previous 20 cycles as shown in figure 14(g). This sudden changed (less hardening) in slope could be an indication of the severe crack growth which led to ultimate failure of the sample, occurred at 34th cycle.

5.6.5 Difference in response of Sensor2 from PSA curve at 275MPa & 300 MPa (2T25)

Figure 14(h) PSA at 275 MPa

Figure 14 (i) PSA at 300 MPa of 2T25 It is worthwhile to compare the PSA curves at two different stress levels, 275 MPa and 300 MPa: (i) In figure 14 (h) the PSA slope change monotonically, whereas, at 300 MPa PSA curve can be divided in three sections namely (1st cycle ­ 6th cycle), (7th cycle ­ 25th cycle) and (26th cycle ­ 34th cycle) respectively.
41

(ii) In figure 14 (h) the curve shows cyclic hardening monotonically with no sudden variation in the slope .However, in figure 14(i) major changes of PSA slope were observed in three sections in term of its PSA amplitude values and direction.

5.7 The Sample Response of Strain Amplitude as function of cycles:

Figure 15 (a), Maximum tensile strain (max) response as a function of Cycles

Figure 15 (b), Minimum Strain (min) response as a function of Cycles As we know, maximum strain and minimum strain is opposite and from the above figure 15(a) and 15(b) it is observed that their response as a function of cyclic load is also opposite. Figure 15(a) region-I, confirms the softening of the metal with increase in strain amplitude whereas, figure 15(b) initially it is decreasing with reduced strain value.

42

Figure 15(c), Strain amplitude [a = (max ­ min)/2] as a function of cycles

Figure 15 (d), Mean strain [m = (max+min)/2] as a function of cycle From figure 15(a) and 15(c), by plotting strain range and strain amplitude as a function of cycles, we observe the followings:   There are also three regions in the curves. From 1st cycle to 6th cycle strain amplitude is increasing (showing softening), from 7th

cycle to 25th cycle changes direction and reducing almost linearly (showing hardening). Again from 26th cycle to 34th cycle, the slope of strain amplitude reduction happens, though less visible than that in figure 14(g). The variation of strain amplitude, changing direction and changing slope corresponds well with the PSA variation.

43

5.7.1. Comparing the minimum and maximum strain amplitude curve, the following points are also observed:  During maximum strain figure 15(a) the change in the curve at three sections are the

evidence of deformation and as it reduced its value up to maximum cycle which indicated its hardening characteristic with cycles progress. And with changing its curve upward after 26th cycle showed less hardening which was the indication of ultimate macro crack.  On the other hand, with minimum strain, figure 15(b) the curve is almost linear, which

indicates that it is not as indicative to illustrate sample deformation.

6. Conclusion and Future Work 6.1 Conclusion: The intention of this research was to use FBG sensors to detect the crack initiation of aluminum alloy. The small size and light weight allow the FBG to detect localized strain. The experiments data proved that FBG sensors could be used to detect the crack initiation and to characterize the response of metal with increased applied stresses. The large contact area of the FBGs made on flat cladding fiber, together with an enhanced bonding process, has significantly increased strain measurement range. From the analyses of the data, following concluding points can be highlighted: (i) The flat cladding FBG sensors are used to measure the cyclic strain amplitude up to ± 11000µ ( figure, 13(d)] for aluminum fatigue test. (ii) Cyclic hardening was observed as demonstrated by the PSA decreasing with the cycles number. Significant change in PSA slope was observed at ~8 cycles before the fatigue failure happens which was interpreted as the crack propagation. (iii) Although fatigue failure occurred in TMAZ zone, the significant deformation also occurred in NZ. FBG measurements showed that it is possible to detect the failure several cycles before it occurs.

6.2

Suggested Future Work:

The crack initiation and material failure detection could be better resolved by sensors during the test stages of LCF testing system provided that the sensors are able to sustain up to higher stress level. Especially, the sensors are at edges may be given more attention during bonding. To increase the bonding strength, the use of weight during cure should be more balanced so that the sensors at the edges may overcome the weaknesses, which is observed during these tests. Also the multiplexed FBG sensor array could be applied to measure strain distribution in mechanical and material components, as well as for structural health monitoring. To view the fracture surface and propagation region Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs may be used to verify the analyzed result.

Appendix Method of PSA calculation and plot: 1. Find X (strain column) and Y (stress column) Zero point (starting point) of 1st cycle by plotting stress data and wavelength respectively. In the plot from the pick point to find the

highest change point by row number or by time. The formula of calculating the cycle range: highest change row number = (xxxx -250) is the start point of the first cycle and {(xxxx-250) + 1000}-1= xxxx is the end point of the cycle. For subsequent cycles need to increase thousand points. 2. Create a new excel sheet or file copying "strain" and "stress" column using paste value and to add a new column as `row id'. Add condition column to find out when y value changes from positive to negative, IF ((B2*B3<=0)*(B2<>0),1,0) then result will be 0 or 1. Also add check x at y=0 column, IF (D2=0, 0, (C3*B2-C2*B3)/(B2-B3)) where B is stress column C is strain column and D is condition column. 3. Create a new excel sheet / file copying `row id' and `calculate x' using paste value. (i) To select data, highlights any point of `calculate' x column and sort data by smallest to largest value.To delete the rows with zero values. (ii) Again, to select data, highlight any point at `row id' and sort by smallest to largest. This will give X1 and X2 value of shifting range for plastic deformation. (iii) Now to calculate PSA = (X1-X2)/2, fx =(B2-B3)/2 or (B3-B2)/2 Select data, highlight any PSA point and sort by smallest to largest. Delete empty rows. Again, sort out by "row id" smallest to largest. Divide PSA column by 100 to get percentage (%) value. Insert a new column at the beginning of the table as cycle number. Plot PSA% vs. Cycles [High light these two column-Insert-Scatter-select picture]. The plotted curve will be in the positive region. The curve will be either ascending or 4. Create a new excel sheet/file copying "row id" and "PSA" column by paste value. (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi) (vi)

descending depending on the hardening or softening characteristics of the material.
