Modelling the Safety Performance of Roadways for Specific Collision Types
Master of Applied Science, 2005 By Tony Chiu Department o f Civil Engineering Ryerson University

Abstract

Safety performance functions (SPFs) are rarely developed for specific accident types because this can be very lengthy especially when relevant data are unavailable. Because

o f this constraint, a factor is applied along with the SPF for all accident types to estimate the safety for specific accidents types. This factor is the proportion of the individual However, there is no reason to

collision type in the entire population of all accidents.

believe that this factor is a constant which is independent o f Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT). Accordingly, a constant factor and the proportion model are applied to the

SPF for all accident types combined to estimate the SPF for specific accident types on both rural road segments and Two-Way Stop-Controlled (TWSC) intersections. The

validity o f these factors are tested using the state-of-the-art network screening approaches. Furthermore, a detailed investigation on Property Damage Only (PDO) estimates is carried out on certain aspects of safety performance functions, using negative binomial regression. PDO estimates are then evaluated based on three different approaches.

Direct applications, such as vehicle design improvement, were

implemented inside the vehicle to enhance the safety o f both drivers and passengers. Roadway treatments such as modification of the lane widths and shoulders widths, and rescheduling the timing of traffic signals were applied to the roadways directly to improve road safety. Other implementations include a graduated licensing program, an

impaired driving program, and safety campaigns were phased in to reduce vehicular accidents. In order to understand and prevent future accidents, one must employ appropriate methods to carefully examine and formulated treatment plans for an entity. In this paper,

statistical safety modelling is applied to rural roadways and Two-Way-Stop-Controlled (TWSC) intersections. The intention of a statistical safety model is to estimate the This method has Details

_________________ Chapter One of statistical safety modelling will be discussed in Chapter Two. One common mistake

in road safety analysis is to identify sites for treatment merely based on the accident counts for a short period of time. Targetting an entity with high accident counts over a

certain period can be inefficient because accidents take place at random, a phenomenon that is further discussed in Chapter Two.

Safety Analyst In the last decade, substantial research on statistical safety modelling has been done.

However, it is still very challenging to develop a good statistical road safety model because it requires lots of information (i.e. accident counts, traffic flow, etc.). information is costly and sometimes difficult to obtain. This

realized the need of implementing a state-of-the-art safety management method in engineering practices. SafetyAnalyst comprises a set of tools that help engineers to

facilitate and improve road safety using state-of-the-art safety management approaches. Currently, it is still under development, with a beta version to be released in year 2006. The SafetyAnalyst package is made up of six different modules: 1. Network Screening Tool - identifies sites with promise for safety improvements 2. Diagnosis Tool - analyzes the nature of safety problems at specific sites 3. Countermeasure Selection Tool - assists user in the selection of a proper treatment at specific site 4. Economic Appraisal Tool - assesses the economic implications of one or more of the selected countermeasures 5. Priority Ranking Tool - distinguishes sites which most urgently call for treatment

In a nutshell, the purpose o f these modules is to assist engineers when they identify problematic sites and to help design an effective treatment for the target sites, using the most up-to-date and appropriate road safety management procedures.

Objectives of the Study This thesis is a detailed investigation o f some of the unresolved elements concerning

the development o f safety performance functions (SPFs) for accident prediction in the SafetyAnalyst tools. i) The objectives are three-fold:

ii)

Modelling the proportions of specific collision types at TWSC intersections

iii) Detailed investigation of methods for estimating the expected number o f Property Damage Only (PDO) accidents In the first two parts, the objective is to investigate the accuracy o f applying the proportion of specific accident type to the total collision model using two different approaches. Only traffic count is used for the covariate in this study because AADT Another reason

usually explains more than 70% of the variation in accident occurrence.

for doing so is that many jurisdictions do not necessary have the roadways information other than the traffic counts. Thus, it is important to understand the relationship

between traffic count and accident frequency in order to give a clear definition in the software SafetyAnalyst. In part three o f this thesis, a detailed investigation o f PDO

Accident Prediction Model The purpose of accident prediction models is to estimate the safety of road segments

or intersections based on their traits.

the number of accidents (the dependent variable) of an entity as a function of its traits (the independent variables). ^ where

such as road geometry, human factors, weather conditions, and others, depending on the availability and precision of these data. Since a SPF is used to estimate the accident

M odel Formulation One o f the major challenges of developing a statistical accident prediction model is

to select an adequate functional form.

Broadly speaking, the process o f developing a

SPF is merely curve-fitting in which the modeller attempts to select a function which fits the data well. It is common to judge the validity o f the model from the GOF tests.

Some researchers have suggested choosing a function which contains as few parameters as possible. road safety. In calibrating an accident prediction model, measures must be taken to avoid deficiencies which result from the excluded variables and use of inappropriate functional form. Accordingly, researchers typically go through a series o f exploratory data Nevertheless, there is no theory to support that this approach has value in

analyses in order to determine the adequate independent variables for the model and explain how these variables are entered into the model. In statistical road safety

modelling, the exponential, quadratic, power and gamma functions are often used. Following the selection o f a functional form, generalized linear modelling (GLM) is commonly used to estimate the parameters o f the model.

Negative Binomial Distribution Accident counts are random, discrete, sporadic, and non-negative in nature, so they

are best described by the Poisson distribution (6-5, 11, 20), which is given by:

where K is the observed accidents in a unit of time at a site and

k

is the mean accident.

However, the variance of the accident data is restrained by the shortcoming of the Poisson distribution, namely, var(7) = K (2.3).

When the variance of the accident data is greater than the mean, it is said to be overdispersed, which implies that the model coefficients and standard errors are misinterpreted. Thus, these model parameters cause the model to either over- or The overdispersion problem can be overcome by

2.5

The Empirical Bayes Method Traditionally, prediction of safety of an entity is based on its accident count alone.

This results in a regression-to-mean (RTM) bias that occurs when one focuses on the entities where the accident counts seem to be high or low compared to the other sites. For example, treatment sites are often selected based on the high level o f accident frequency. In such cases, the safety effect estimates based on a simple before-after Safety

comparison o f these tend to exaggerate the effectiveness of the countermeasures. estimates that are based entirely on accident counts can be imprecise.

The Empirical

Bayes (EB) method accommodates this problem with the traditional method o f safety estimation. In general terms, the EB method combines the accident counts and the SPF This eliminates the RTM bias in

ChapterTwo

Besides the concerns which were discussed in the previous sections, the validation of the accident prediction model is equally important in order to produce a well-established SPF to fit a set of accident data. In the published literature, there isn't a Wood (25) used

the mean deviance and Chi-square ratio, Poch and Marmering {20) used the likelihood ratio. Miaou and Lum (77) adopted r-statistics, and Oh et al. {16) introduced several GOF measures which examined the external validity of accident prediction models. Recently,

Hauer and Bamfo (5) have introduced a graphical method to test the GOF, which uses the plot of cumulative residuals against a covariate (e.g. AADT) and the ± 2 a standard deviations to identify how well the model is fit. In this thesis, the mean deviance and the Chi-square ratio along with the several GOF measures introduced by Oh et al. are employed to test the overall GOF of the SPFs. The advantage of using these measures is that they are focused on the GOF of statistical models to independent data through the investigation of the residuals in different aspect. In addition, the graphical method by Hauer and Bamfo is used to test the GOF for the full range of the AADT variables.

By comparing these two statistical measures, one

can determine whether the models are over-fitting or under-fitting the estimation data. An MSPE greater than its corresponding MSE suggests that the model may have been over-fit to the estimation data and the observed relationships may be misleading. It is

also possible that a very important variable is omitted in the model or that the model is not well-defined.

However, an accident prediction model with a reasonable overall GOF

Because this issue often arises in an accident prediction model, it is important to examine both the overall fitness and the GOF for the entire range of AADT to avoid m isinterpretation o f the statistical results.

This combined equation 2.15 represents a normal probability density with the mean equal to 0 and the standard deviation equal to a*, which can be used to calculate the ±2a limits shown in Figure 2.2. Broadly speaking, one would expect the CURE plot to oscillate up and down around the zero mark when the model fits well in all ranges of variables (i.e. AADT in this case). Conversely, one would expect the CURE plot to be all above or below zero when the model is not well-fit. (2) plot. A few points should be emphasized when analysing the CURE

------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- Chapter Two a) The model should perhaps be modified, for example, by changing the functional form if for a substantial range of AADT the predicted accident from the model is larger than the observed values in that range and vice versa. For instance, the sudden decrease between AADT 4,000 to 5,000 indicates such a case. b) Where there is a vertical jump in the CURE plot, there is an unusually large residual between the predicted accident and the observed accident count at that location. Hauer calls this sudden jump the 'outlier', which is illustrated in

Figure 2.2 where the AADT is near 27,000. c) The presence of a certain range of AADT where the random walk lies outside the ± 2 a boundaries (the dotted lines in Figure 2.2) indicates that the model is not predicting the observed value accurately within that range. In summary, the CURE method provides an overview for GOF for all ranges o f the covariate. If the model fits well, the cumulative residuals are expected to lie within the ±2a boundaries.

DATA 3.1 General Features of the HSIS Data The data used in this research originate from the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) database. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed the

HSIS database by collecting information from nine states and subsequently converting this dataset into SAS format for research purposes. In this thesis, the Minnesota

database is used to calibrate the safety performance functions for road segments and intersections. The database consists of four different files containing, respectively,

information on accidents, traffic, roadlogs, and intersection characteristics.

3.2

Accident Database The accident database contains case-by-case basic accident information, vehicle data

that include the information on the associated vehicles, and occupant data that contain descriptive and injury information for all occupants involved in the accident. can be merged by using the accident report number and vehicle number. These data

They can also

be linked to the roadway or intersection file using the three common variables: route system, route number, and reference point. In Minnesota, the law states that an accident must be reported to the police officer for investigation if there is injury in the crash or property damage over USD $1,000. Fifteen years of accident data are available in the HSIS database, and the ratio of vehicles per crash is between 1.83 and 1.87 for this duration.
18

Chapter Three The 1995-1999 Minnesota accident and road segments data were used for all the road segments studied, and all accident types are included. 32,400 total collisions,

12,832 fatal/injury collisions, and 19,544 property damage only (PDO) collisions were amassed during these five years on 2-lane undivided rural highways. The 1995-1999 Minnesota intersection accident data are used in Chapter Five o f this thesis and only rural 3-leg and 4-leg TWSC data are included. The database consists o f

2,497 total accidents, 1,125 fatal/injury accidents, and 1,372 PDO accidents for 3-leg TWSC, and 6,218 total collisions, 2,823 fatal/injury collisions, and 3,395 PDO collisions for 4-leg TWSC.

3.3

Roadlog Data The roadlog file consists of all the information of the roadway characteristics;

however, the layout o f the dataset is different from that of the accident database.

Each

record in the roadlog file contains information on a length of a segment that has similar road characteristics over that length. In other words, a new record is created whenever

there is a change o f road traits in a segment; the new starting point is referred to as the beginning reference point. The roadlog file includes information such as the surface The database is

updated daily according to the construction and maintenance plans which are submitted to the M innesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). The roadlog file consists of approximately 134,000 miles of road systems: 12,000 miles o f primary (urban) roadways, 33,000 miles of additional state-maintained rural roadways, and 89,000 miles of other non state-maintained county and local roads. 3.1 shows the breakdown of roadways from the 1996 HSIS roadlog file.

In this research,

COMPARISON OF TWO METHODS FOR DEVELOPING SAFETY PERFORMANCE FUNCTIONS FOR SPECIFIC ACCIDENT TYPES ON ROAD SEGM ENTS 4.1 Introduction A safety performance function (SPF) is a mathematical model which relates the accident frequency o f a road to its traits. The SPF is very powerful because o f its ability Typically

to be utilized in network screening and in evaluation of safety treatments.

SPFs are developed for all accident types combined but there is a need for SPFs for specific accident types (e.g., run-off-road, head-on) so that network screening and treatm ent evaluation in SafetyAnalyst (22) and similar efforts can be so disaggregated. However, calibrating these can be very time-consuming especially if relevant data are not available in sufficient quantities. Because of this difficulty, a factor is applied in the

initial version o f SafetyAnalyst to the SPF for all accident types combined to estimate the SPF for a specific accident type. the population of all accidents. The factor is the proportion o f that accident type in However, it is not known how these simplistic SPFs

models stack up against those that might be obtained by using data and negative binomial regression to directly estimate SPFs for the specific accident type. The goal o f the work

described in this chapter is to compare the two methods for estimating SPFs for specific accident types. The scheme for this methodology is illustrated in Figure 4.1. The two

methods were applied to get SPFs to obtain the expected accident counts for the two-lane undivided road segments, and the HSIS database from the state of Minnesota was used. Various statistical measures along with the CURE plots were used to analyze the GOF for

Chewier Four 4.3 SPFs Developed by Negative Binomial Regression Using Generalized Linear M odelling As discussed in Chapter Two, the negative binomial model form is the most commonly adopted one in the development of SPFs. The advantage o f using the

negative binomial model is that the overdispersion can be represented through an overdispersion parameter k that is estimated iteratively in the model calibration process. The inverse o f overdispersion parameter y is such that:

var{K} = ^ ^ ^
where E{K} is the expected accidents and var{Kj is the variance.

Note that variance

decreases as y increases; thus, the overdispersion parameter can be used to compare the goodness o f fit for various models fitted with the same dataset. small variance and a better model, and vice versa. A large y indicates a

SPFs Developed by Applying a Factor to the SPF for all Accident Types Combined - The "Proportion" Method Another approach for predicting accidents for each individual collision type is the

"proportion" method.

This method estimates the proportion of each collision type in the

population of all accidents and applies it to the model the total accident model for all accidents combined. The following mathematical equation illustrates how the ratio is

actually applied to the total eollision model. ^(accidents / mile / year) = {proportion) x a{A A D TY (4-3)

Comparison of the Results The objective here is to compare the two methods for estimating SPFs for specific

accident types to determine which one is better.

To achieve the aforementioned

objective, the goodness of fit statistics was used to determine the overall fit of the models. Notwithstanding that, these goodness of fit statistics only provide a basic measure of the overall fit of the model. They cannot specify whether the model is suitable for all For this reason, SPFs have in the past often failed to The CURE procedure discussed

in Chapter Two can address this issue by providing an assessment of how well the model fits in the full range of AADTs. Figure 4.3 shows the CURE plot for the total collision

model and the two dashed curves are the + 2 a boundaries. The cumulative residuals plot reveal that the total collision model does not predict the crashes very accurately because the random walk of the cumulative residuals exceeds the ± 2 a boundaries (the dashed lines) in many ranges of AADT. The main

reason why the cumulative residuals exceeds + 2 o boundaries is that there are many short locations with zero accident in the database. These zero accident locations have Nevertheless, the

seem acceptable and one can conclude that the calibrated model is reasonable.

CURE plot indicates that the model overestimates crashes at very low AADT and between AADT 3,000-10,000 while it underestimates crashes between AADT 1,000-2,000 and those AADT is above 10,000.

4.6 Chapter Summary
The Minnesota rural, two-lane undivided roadway database divided accidents into eighteen different collision types, and each type was analyzed using its own SPFs by applying negative binomial regression and the "proportion" method. In general, not all

of the SPFs are well-developed in terms of both overall goodness of fit and the CURE method. The reason for these poor results is that the models do not include other Thus, the SPFs are expected to be

important independent variables except the AADT. somewhat less accurate.

Based on the sites and accident types considered in the comparison, the proposed methods along with the number of crashes for each of the accident types are shown in Tables 4.9 and 4.10. The selection of the proposed method is based on the GOF tests Tables 4.9 and 4.10 show no significant connection between Generally speaking, the negative

and CURE plot results.

accident counts and which method is selected.

binomial regression generates more accurate results than the "proportion" method when a large number of accident counts are available. Nevertheless, one can still make use of

the "proportion" method when a dataset is lack of accident counts for a specific collision type. In short, it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion based on these findings since In order to draw a firm conclusion,

they are based only on the Minnesota dataset. similar tests on other databases are suggested.

In the next Chapter, similar methodology

was applied to the Minnesota TWSC intersections database.

5.2 Data Assembly In this part of the research, the Minnesota HSIS rural 3-leg and 4-leg TWSC intersection databases were used. Accidents were divided into 18 different collision The statistical summaries of the

In this part of the thesis, only collision types with a minimum of 100 accidents were included for the modelling process because modelling types with too few accidents would reduce the accuracy of the results and would be moot since such types are not of interest in the SPF applications. Having eliminated all the collision types with less than 100

accidents, only three types of single vehicle accident and four types of multi-vehicle accident were left for further analysis. Tables 5.3 and 5.4 show the remaining collision

types with 100 or more accidents, along with their proportion, for Minnesota rural, 3-leg and 4-leg TWSC intersections.

Selection of Functional Forms Suitable functional forms were selected after conducting a series of exploratory data

analyses on the HSIS Minnesota rural, 3-leg and 4-leg TWSC intersections databases. Since the only independent variable used in this research is AADT, it is possible to use the scatter plots of proportion of accident vs. total entering AADT to explore several functional forms for the development of models.

5.3.2

Investigation of the Error Distribution for the Proportion of Specific Accident Types In any generalized linear model, the response variable follows some kind o f

distribution (i.e. Poisson, binomial, gamma, or negative binomial).

The distribution o f By

the proportion o f accidents of specific collision types in this study is not known. default the normal distribution was considered.

But before making this assumption, the Detailed

normal probability plot was applied to assess the normality of the data. analyses are shown in Appendix A.

The normal probability plots from Appendix A

reveal that accidents' proportion follows the normal distribution reasonably well, which justifies the adoption o f this assumption for the error distribution of the dependent variable.

5.3.3

Calibration Results Following the determination of suitable model forms and a correct distribution for

fitting a GLM, calibration procedures were performed in the SAS software.

Maximum

likelihood was used in all parameter estimation, using the GENMOD procedure in SAS, as described in Chapter Four. The two models for proportion o f accidents, as specified

in Section 5.3.1, were estimated as a function of AADT. Throughout the calibration process, only the sites with at least one accident for all specific accident types were included. If sites with zero total accidents were included,

the results would be meaningless because one cannot determine the accidents proportion for the specific accident type by dividing zero with zero (i.e. 0 angle accident --0 total accident). The equations below describe the sum of accident proportions following

equations 5.1 and 5.2 respectively.

Chapter Five

At rural 3-leg TWSC intersections, the P-values are slightly better for model (5.1) since they are significantly smaller than the P-values for model (5.2) in most cases. However, the P-values reveal that the models for same direction sideswipe collision (Type 25) and other multiple-vehicle collision (Type 27) are not so good. The observed

counts in both Type 25 and Type 27 show fewer than 150 accidents, compared to other collision types where the accident counts are relatively higher, and this may be the reason for the poor P-values. The P-values for rural 4-leg TWSC intersections are slightly better for model (5.1) but less significant for angle collision (Type 24) and same direction sideswipe collision (Type 25). In contrast to the 3-leg models, both collision types have a large number of Thus, the functional forms do not

describe the dataset well and perhaps other functional forms should be considered for Type 24 and Type 25. Of the two functional forms, model (5.1) is a better choice for modelling proportion by type for rural 3-leg and 4-leg TWSC intersections. The P-values indicate that the

model for 4-leg TWSC intersections is not significant for one type of multi-vehicle collision (Type 24) but is quite good for single vehicle collision. However, both models

have very small coefficients of determination for all collision types, indicating a weak relationship. Given that the exploratory nature of this project was to compare this

method with the other two approaches, and not to determine an ideal model to describe accidents' proportion for all collision types, model (5.1) was chosen for proceeding to the next stage.

5.4 Comparison of Networking Screening Methods for Angle Collisions at Rural Two-Way Stop-Controlled Intersections In any traffic safety improvement smdy, one is interested in identifying sites which require attention for road safety treatments. For years, engineers have used the

traditional screening techmques that rely on observed counts - a method now proven to be unreliable due to the fact that an accident is a random event. The randomness in

collisions can cause misinterpretation of the safety of sites with relatively high or low accidents. In order to efficiently identify sites with promise of safety treatment, a

screening method which is more reliable must be used. The SPF screening approach, which had been documented in FHWA (22), was adopted and applied in this study. This approach is trustworthy but it requires extensive Acquiring these

Therefore, an alternative is sought to

This potential network screening approach known as the

collision pattern recognition method or the method screening for high proportions o f specific accident types was developed by Hey decker and Wu (9), which is based on the Bayes' theorem. The theoretical framework for both SPF and collision pattern

recognition methods will be discussed in the following sections.

5.4.1

Potential for Safety Improvement (PSI) Method for Intersections The purpose o f network screening is to identify sites with promise for detailed

engineering studies (DES).

Traditionally, engineers have selected ha 2ardous sites for

road improvement purely based on the observation o f high accident occurrences within a short period o f time. Nevertheless, this traditional method is biased for safety

Chapter Five

Recently, two alternative ways to identify sites

with promise which are based on EB framework were documented by FHWA. (22) 1) 2) PSI based on Expected Accident Frequency PSI based on Excess Accident Frequeney

The chief advantage of these methods is that they remove the Regression-To-Mean (RTM) bias. However, the main disadvantage of these methods is that they require a database

which contains reliable information of AADT as well as SPFs. Specifically, the first method ranks sites based on the EB expected accident frequency, X, whereas the second method ranks sites using the difference between the EB expected accident frequency, X, and the SPF predicted accident frequency, k \ Excess ~ X - K (5.5).

The procedures for calculating the PSI are very straightforward andboth methods follow similar procedures except for the fact that there is an additionalstep in calculating the excess accident frequency. below. Stepwise, the procedures for the PSI methods are listed

5.4.2

Method of Identifying Sites with High Proportions of Specific Accident Types As discussed above, there are two shortfalls for the PSI method. Because it

requires an SPF and traffic volumes, Heydecker and Wu (P) have developed an alternative screening approach which can avoid this need. The Bayesian method is now

used to determine the probability of a specific collision types (i.e. angle collision) by combining two sources of information - the range of frequency of occurrence for the specific collision type, and the counts of specific accident type.

By substituting Equations 5.23 and 5.24 into Eq. 5.22,

The posterior distribution can be estimated by the method of maximum likelihood -- a very simple idea that yields complicated equations. 5.20 can be expressed as: L, = (5.30). The likelihood function for Eq.

The log-likelihood function is used to simplify this equation: log(Z,.) = log ' +\og[B{a + x ,,p + n,-x^)]-\og[B{a,p)] (5.31)

Parameters a and ^ are estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood function.

Note that

the first component on the right hand side of the Equation 5.31 can be removed since for eachsite it is a constant. By applying the beta function into Equation 5.31, the

components on the right hand side of Equation 5.31 become: \og[B{a + X,, and

A) Using data and negative binomial regression to directly estimate the SPF for a specific accident type. B) Applying a constant factor to the SPF for all accident types combined to estimate the SPF for the specific accident type. C) Applying a proportion model to the SPF for all accident types combined to estimate the SPF for the specific accident type. Both PSI screening methods were applied to the angle collision data for Minnesota rural, 3-leg and 4-leg TWSC intersections to test the accuracy and sensitivity the results from the three approaches to developing the SPFs. The expected accident frequency for the They are represented by the capital letters A, B and

Similar outcomes were found for 4-leg rural TWSC intersections.

For one thing,

the PSI method based on expected accident frequency shows that applying a constant factor with the SPF for total collisions yielded 19 of 20 sites which were also reinked in the top 20 by using the SPF for angle collision from the reference group. Applying the

proportion model with SPF for total collision also yielded 19 of 20 similar sites. Likewise, the PSI method based on the excess accident frequency suggests that applying a constant factor or proportion model with the SPF for total collision both yielded 14 of 20 sites which were also ranked in the top 20 using the SPF for angle collision from the reference group. In addition, the ranking results obtained from the high proportion

method seem to be very different from the results obtained from the PSI methods, which yielded 8 of 20 and 7 of 20 sites for 3-leg and 4-leg TWSC intersections respectively. It

is not surprising to observe a difference in ranking using the high proportion method because the method itself does not depend on AADT. Based on the sites and accident types considered for comparison, the ranking results suggest that whether the factor (proportion of accident type) is constant does not influence the network screening results significantly. Also, the ranking results obtained

by applying a constant factor to the SPF for total collision is very close to the one determined by the SPF for angle collision.

accident data to calculate the ratios of the observed and the predicted accident coimts for each year. These yearly multipliers are then applied to the SPFs calibrated from all four

years of data, such that: /c{acciderjts / mile) = [Multiplier]x[a{AADT)^ ] where « and yî are the constant. (6.7)

The validation statistics show that both schemes are slightly over-predicting crashes. The GOF measures are very similar in both cases, and the predicted values generated from both methods are very reliable. Generally speaking, the expected accident counts

suggest that the "yearly multipliers" technique predicts accidents more accurately compared to the negative binomial regression, as shown in Table 6.5, where the predicted accidents closely resemble the observed counts. As for the three different methods, the

results from both schemes suggest that method A (using a calibrated PDO SPF estimate in the EB procedure) predicts accidents more accurately compared to methods B and C.

86

_________________________________________ 6.6 Chapter Summary Despite the similarity of the values of the expected and observed accidents as calculated using the "yearly multipliers" method, one cannot hastily conclude that the multiplier method is as good as the negative binomial regression. This is because

C

adopting multipliers in the SPFs is somewhat forcing the sum of predicted accidents to equal the sum of observed counts because the ratios were actually determined using all four years of the same dataset. That notwithstanding, the results obtained from the directly calibrated PDO model (Method A) are more satisfactoiy in both schemes compared to the other two methods. Simply put, it is recommended that the SPF for PDO accidents be calibrated, at least for the dataset explored. Nevertheless, it is suggested to explore the same issue on other

datasets before one can generalize the results.

CHAPTER SEVEN

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 7.1 Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work Typically SPFs are developed for total, injury, or PDO accidents. However, there is

a demand for development of SPFs for specific accident types so that network screening and treatment evaluation in Safety/Analyst and similar tasks can be disaggregated by these accident types. In light of the fact that calibrating SPFs for individual collision types is

not trivial and is somewhat difficult in the absence of relevant information, inclusion o f a factor (accidents' proportion) in SafetyAnalyst to apply with the SPF for total collision has been recommended. A comparison of the two methods of negative binomial regression and "proportion" methods, which are used in developing SPFs for specific accident types on road segments, shows no significant pattern in the findings. which method works better in each case. Therefore, it is impractical to generalize

It seems worthwhile to calibrate appropriate

SPFs for individual collision types when there is a large sample of accident counts. Conversely, the "proportion" method seems to be a more logical approach in predicting accidents when the database lacks sufficient accident counts. Further studies of this

issue are suggested for databases for other jurisdictions and entity types, to identify patterns that may be generalizable. A careful study of the proportion method for developing SPFs for specific accident types reveals that generalized linear modelling is capable of modelling collisions by proportion. It is reasonable to assume that the error structure for the dependent variable
88

Chapter Seven follows the normal distribution and that the functional form follows either the power or gamma function. Application of network screening based on angle collisions at TWSC

intersections suggests that whether the proportions of specific accident types remain constant or not does not significantly influence of the ranking. In other words, applying

a constant factor or proportion model would not drastically change the results of the ranking. Based on the current dataset, one can conclude that it is reasonable to apply a Moreover,

constant factor to the SPF for total collision for network screening purposes.

it is suggested that a similar application for other collision types on the same database as well as datasets from other jurisdictions be repeated in order to draw a more definitive conclusion. Lastly, the detailed investigation of methods for estimating the expected number of PDO accidents demonstrates that it is logical and practical to model PDO accidents despite the errors during the data collection stage. In general, both `yearly multiplier'

and negative binomial regression methods are accurate ways of estimating PDO accidents. Although one cannot generalize which method is more accurate in safety prediction, it is recommended that the SPF for PDO accidents be calibrated based on the dataset used. Notwithstanding that, further explorations on other datasets are advisable before one can make a more definitive statement.

STATISTICS BACKGROUND FOR ROAD SAFETY A .l Normal Probability Plot Normal probability plot is a tool to assess the normality of the data. Generally

speaking, the probability plot is a graphical method for determining whether a set of data is conformed by the hypothesized distribution (the distribution of accident proportion, in our case). In the present context, one is interested in showing whether the proportion of

specific accident type follows the normal distribution. The concept of normal probability plot is very simple and convenience. well for both large and small sample sizes. 1) It works

A stepwise procedure is presented below. In the

The data is disaggregated such that similar AADT are grouped together. present context, an interval of five hundreds is used.

2)

Each group is ranked from smallest to largest, %i, xj, ...,

Since there are too

many groups in this case, only ten groups are randomly selected from various collision types and applied to this test. 3) The ordered observations are plotted against their cumulative frequency. The

cumulative frequency for normal distribution is calculated using Equation A .l, Cumulative Frequency = where j is the rank order and n is the total numbers of observation. 4) If the proposed distribution adequately describes the data, the plotted points are expected to lie approximately on a straight line. Otherwise, the plotted points (A .l)

All o f the graphs reveal that the plotted points fall approximately along a straight line, meaning that the normal distribution adequately describes the accidents' proportion. Therefore, the assumption of choosing normal distribution as the response variable for generalized linear model is indeed valid.

The overdispersion parameter was found to be 0.0003, and which means that the variance in the predicted accidents is very small. In terms of CURE plots, the SPF method shows

an excellent fit in all ranges of AADT and the fluctuations of random walk are all bounded within the ± 2 o boundaries. The consistent upward drift in the low AADT

indicates that the model underestimates crashes, whereas the consistent downward drift in the mid- and high-ranges AADT is an indication of overestimation. On the contrary, the
