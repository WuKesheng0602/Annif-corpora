Abstract
Relationships Between Fat Crystal Characteristics and Emulsion Stability in Water in Oil Systems Masters o f Applied Science, Chemical Engineering, 2004 Shane M ason Hodge D epartm ent o f Chemical Engineering Ryerson University

Investigations were made into the stabilization o f water in oil emulsions using crystalline particles o f paraffin wax and fully hydrogenated canola and cottonseed oils. A model system was studied to develop a methodology o f study and provide a benchmark for a subsequent study o f a real-world system. The model system involved the use o f light mineral oil,

purified water, paraffin wax and glycerol monooleate emulsifier. The wax was crystallized prior to and following émulsification. Prepared emulsion samples were monitored for

sedimentation and flocculation behaviour. Measurements o f coalescence were obtained by pulsed field gradient NMR. Formation of the solid crystalline wax phase following

émulsification resulted in emulsions more stable to flocculation and coalescence than samples containing the same am ount o f wax crystallized prior to émulsification. Analysis of emulsion samples with polarized light microscopy showed the wax crystals were associated with the water droplet interfaces rather than dispersed freely within the continuous oil phase. Another investigation employed similar experimental protocols but incorporated food-grade materials. Two different solid fats were used, chosen for their differing polymorphic (crystal habit) behaviour. Solid crystals o f canola stearine (p-tending) and cottonseed stearine (P'tendin^ were compared in their abilities to stabilize emulsions at levels o f addition between 0 and 2%. Each type o f fat was incorporated into the emulsion in a pre-crystallized state, or while melted and crj'stallized following émulsification. Cottonseed stearine was found to be

crystallization behardour was a result o f a solid-state transformation via an imperfectly formed P ' intermediate. W ith respect to the post-crystallized emulsions, where the

polymorphism o f the two fats were both in the P-form, the canola stearine provided better stabilization against coalescence than the cottonseed stearine. This observ'-ation coincided w ith a stronger energy o f interfacial attachment for crj^staUized canola than for cottonseed as calculated from measurements o f contact angle and interfacial tension. W ith the pre-

crystallized system, incorporation o f cottonseed stearine resulted in reduced sedimentation and coalescence compared to samples containing pre-crystaUized canola stearine. This

difference was attributed to the presence o f fine shards o f p '-form crj'stals. The system that imparted the liighest degree o f overall stabihly^ incorporated the use o f canola stearine crystallized following émulsification.

introduction
Emulsions
Emulsions are dispersions of one liquid within another, where the two liquids

are immiscible.

Emulsions are encountered in foods, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, Most often the stability o f the emulsion is

desired. However, in certain cases, such as with crude oüs, processors seek to find ways o f destabilizing the emulsion (L.ee, 1999). O ne means by which emulsions may be stabilized is by colloidal solid particles. Pickering (1907) was the first to

docum ent the stabilization o f emulsions by solids, and as a result, emulsions o f this type are commonly referred to as Ticketing Emulsions'. The study of colloidal particles in food emulsions, and in particular the role of fat crystals, is a much mote recent phenom enon, being pioneered in the 1960s by Lucassen-Reynders (1962) and together with van den Tempel (1963). More recently, Johansson and her

collaborators (1995a,b,c,d,e) investigated triglyceride crystals and their effect on emulsion stability. They found that for W /O emulsions, there was a destabilizing effect up to a certain critical concentration o f crystals, and then further addition increased stabilitjc In food systems, both water-in-oil (W /O ) and oÜ-in-water (O /W ) type emulsions are encountered. I unstable. These systems are inherently thermodynamically

Enetg}^ is required to create emulsions as it involves generating a large '

increase in the interfacial area between the two immiscible phases. Emulsions may be destabilized by a number o f mechanisms. 1) Creaming (or sedimentation) is the separation o f the two phases induced by differences in densities between the two phases. 2) Flocculation involves the attraction o f droplets of the

same phase to near neighbours by weak colloidal interactions.

flocculate, they maintain their structural integrity (IVlcClements & Demetriades, 1998), and in some cases can even be re-dispersed. Droplets can flocculate without creaming resulting in the macroscopic observation o f a non-uniformly dispersed system. 3) Coalescence is the complete merger of droplets, associated with interdroplet film thinning and rupture. As a result o f coalescence, phase inversion may occur where droplets o f the dispersed phase partially coalesce and as a result entrap the once-continuous phase within it. This is the mechanism by which butter (a

water-in-oil emulsion) is formed from milk (an oÜ-in-water emulsion) during churning (Van Boekel, 1980). 4) Ostwald ripening involves the growtli o f larger

droplets at the expense o f smaller droplets o f the same phase and is driven by solubilit)^ gradients created by differences in droplet Laplace pressures. The Laplace pressure inside a droplet is an increase in pressure above that o f the surrounding medium. It results from the contraction o f the droplet surface due to the surface tension o f the interface.

Smaller droplets wül have greater internal pressures tlian larger droplets. When the droplet phase is partially soluble in the continuous phase this results in concentration gradients that are highest in the proximity o f smaller droplets. Molecules o f the droplet phase can thus migrate along these concentration gradients from smaller droplets to larger droplets.

The kinetic stability o f emulsions can be improved through a number of methods. One m ethod is to initially decrease the average droplet size o f the

dispersed phase by mechanical means, thereby reducing the rate o f creaming or settling, as is done in the homogenization of milk (Swaisgood, 1996). Surfactants may be added to emulsion systems to lower the interfacial tension between the two immiscible fluids. Surfactants act to stabilize emulsions by forming a cohesive film around the droplets that resists coalescence (Dickinson, 1992). Especially in aqueous systems (i.e. O /W emulsions), the addition o f surface-active proteins can stabilize emulsions by increasing the interfacial viscosity, thereby slowing the rate o f film drainage, and thus coalescence. A highly \dscous and rigid interfacial film laden with particles wdl slow the rate o f film drainage and resist rupture, resulting in improved stability (Edwards & Wasan, 1991). Polymers adsorbed to the interface wül resist droplet coalescence through steric effects whereas non-adsorbed polymers may contribute to flocculation through depletion interactions (Walstra, 1996). In W /O systems, fat crystals have been shown to stabilize emulsions (Lucassen-Reynders, 1962; Hodge & Rousseau, 2003). There are two mechanisms by which they accomplish this: 1) Fat crystals may form a network throughout the oil phase o f the emulsion reducing die rate o f diffusion and settling o f water droplets through the continuous oil phase, and 2) Fat crystals may also be adsorbed to the surface o f W /O emulsion droplets providing a solid barrier to coalescence. Stabilizing crystals may originate by way o f surfactant solidification at the interface j where the surfactants are lipid-based amphiphiles such as monoacylglycerols (IVlAGs). Atemadvely, crystals formed prior to the creation o f the emulsion may migrate towards the droplet interface (Friberg et ai, 1997). The key factors that will

determine the influence o f fat crystals on water-in-oil emulsion stabilization are: the wettability o f the crystals at the interface (Friberg et aL, 1997); interfacial film viscosity (Lucassen-Reynders, 1993); and fat crystal microstructure (polymorphism, morphology, etc.) (Ogden & Rosenthal, 1998).

1.1.1 Wettability and C ontact Angle
Fat crj'stals influence emulsion stabilit)^ primarily .epending on how they are wetted by the continuous and dispersed phases (Darling, 1982). D uring or after

émulsification, fat crj^stals may be adsorbed to the interface if it is m ore energetically favourable than remaining in the continuous oil phase. Adsorbed fat crj^stals will be preferentially wetted by either the aqueous or oil phase depending on the composition o f the aqueous and oil phases as well as the composition and surface properties o f the fat crystal itself. The wettability o f the fat crj'stal is described by the contact angle formed at the boundary o f the three phases (johansson & Bergenstâhl, 1995c) where the contact angle is the angle the liquid-liquid interface makes to the solid phase as measured through the aqueous phase. (See Figure 1)

Particles with contact angles smaller than 90° will stabilize O /W emulsions. With contact angles greater than 90° (as shown in Figure 2), the particles will stabilize a W /O emulsion (Schulman & Leja, 1954). If the particles are completely w etted by either the oil or water phase they become fully dispersed in that phase and will have

î É

no stabilizing effect.

I f a drop o f water is placed on a hydrophobic surface, such as a slab o f solidified fat, the water will not spread upon it, but rather it will bead. The contact angle o f the droplet's surface to the planar crystal face helps characterize the surface's surface free energ}: and critical surface tension, which in turn helps to understand wetting behaviour and surface morphology. The positioning o f the solid particles is dependent on interplay between the three surface tensions present (i.e. oil/water, solid/oil and solid/water, or y.,,^,, respectively). Reinders (1913) stated that three possibilities existed; y,,, and

yow>Yos-7sw In this case, the crystal would be wetted by both the water and oü phases. It
is only under this condition that a fat crystal will locate itself at the oü and water interface. Y oung's equation (Young, 1855) resolves these forces present at the three phase junction: = (5)

where 0 is the contact angle measured through the water phase. The contact angle form ed in any system wül depend on the surface a n d /o r interfacial properties o f all of the phases. ThermodynamicaUy, the surface/interfacial tension,

hydrophobic/hydrophüic properties, presence o f impurities and particle properties, such as roughness determine these properties. In foods, depending on the final

application, it is possible to modify the contact angle between the aqueous and oü phases.

1.1.2 Interfacial Viscosity
In the presence o f an interfacial particle film, an interface wül begin to dem onstrate viscoelastic behaviour. The ability o f an emulsion to resist coalescence will largely depend on tlie properties o f the interface. A highly viscous and rigid interfacial füm laden with particles wül slow the rate o f film drainage and resist rupture, resulting in im proved stability (Edwards & Wasan, 1991). Thus, by

controlling the interface rheology one can control the drainage o f the thin liquid füms trapped between coalescing droplets. This increase in viscosity may, in turn, increase the energy required to displace interfacial crj'stals from between two

Stabilization of Water in Mineral Oil Em ulsions by Paraffin Wax Crystals
Introduction
Much has been learned regarding the role o f paraffin wax crystals in the

stabilization o f crude oil emulsions. These W /O emulsions are form ed as a result o f oceanic spills, and more regularly during normal drilling and recovery operations. Wax crystals play a critical role in crude oil systems, usually im parting stability to these emulsions. T hom pson et al. (1985) found that the presence o f wax crystals did not affect the viscosity or density o f the continuous crude oil phase, n o r the oil/w ater interfacial tension, yet they did im part a substantial stabilizing effect to the emulsions. Thus, the stabilizing effect o f the wax crystals was concluded to be a result o f the wax crystals themselves rather than a result o f their effects on the bulk properties o f the system. Many o f the particles found in crude are surface-active, being com posed o f asphaltenes - a group o f chemically heterogeneous com pounds with regions o f stacked aromatic sheets, alkane chains, and polar moieties. This

mixed com position imparts an amphiphilic nature to the asphaltenes allowing them to function as surfactants (Lee, 1999). O f note is the fact that wax particles only stabilize crude oil emulsions in the presence o f these asphaltene surfactants. Garti et al. (1999) examined W /O /W emulsions stabilized by «-crystals (the «-form was maintained by an «-tending emulsifier). The presence o f the emulsifier was necessary for emulsion stabilization. Furthermore, crystals had to be submicron in size to stabilize emulsions with droplets in the range o f 6-18 pm in size. Larger crystals were n o t effectively adsorbed to the interface and flocculated as free crystals in the oü phase.

The aim o f the research in this section was to determ ine the effect that paraffin wax crystals added to the continuous phase o f a w ater in m ineral oü em ulsion have on stability. We w anted to study the effect o f concentration as well as tlie effect o f crj'staUizing the wax before the émulsification stage and com pare this to crystallizing the wax after émulsification to observe any differences in emulsion stability. Stability was assessed by evaluating sedim entation and coalescence

behaviour over time.

This section detaüs the procedures developed to create the w ater in mineral

over 10 days, and the degree o f droplet coalescence obser\^ed over the sam e time period. T he structural relationship between emulsion water droplets and solid wax crystals was observed by microscopy.

D eterm ination of Solubility of W ax in Mineral Oil
The solubility o f the wax in mineral oil was determ ined by turbidometric

analysis. Dilutions o f wax in mineral oil at various concentrations (from 0.10% to 0.01% (w/w)) w ere m elted by heating to 100°C, poured into 1.5 cm x 15 cm test tubes and then subsequently quench-cooled in a w ater bath to 5°C. Following

storage for 24 hrs, samples were then poured into pre-cooled cuvettes and the absorbance at 500 nm taken using a thermostated U V /V is Lam bda 40 Spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, W oodbridge, ON).

Em ulsion P reparation
W ater-in-mineral oil emulsions o f 20% (v/v) were prepared w ith A tsurf

456K at 0.25% (w/w) in the oil phase and various levels o f paraffin wax (0%, 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0% (w/w) in the oil phase). prepared via two regimes. Em ulsions were

To do this, 50 g o f a 4% (w/w) mixture o f paraffin wax in mineral oil was heated to 100"C in a 100 ml beaker then cooled by placing in a refrigerator at 5°C for 24 hours. The resulting oil and wax crystal slurry was com bined with the appropriate amounts o f mineral oü, emulsifier and water at room temperature to make 5 mL samples.

Samples were hom ogenized after combining the various constituents using an impeller-tj'pe hom ogenizer (Omni-Mixer, London Scientific, I.ondon, O N). Samples were pre-blended for one minute at 5100 rpm and then homogenized at 59000 rpm for tw o minutes. Following émulsification, samples were immediately pipetted into N M R tubes (O D = 1 cm), capped and quench-cooled in a circulating water bath at 5°C. Six such samples were prepared at each concentration o f wax (three each for sedim entation analysis and droplet size analysis). Samples were also prepared via a post-crystallization regime. W ith this

m ethod, samples were homogenized at 60°C, with aU o f the com ponents being in the liquid state. A mixture o f 4% (w/w) paraffin wax in mineral oil was melted at 100°C tlien held in a water b ath with the other com ponents at 60"C. A t this tem perature and level o f dilution in the mineral oü, the paraffin wax did n o t ciy-stallize. As with the pre-crystaUization regime, appropriate quantities o f water, mineral oü, emulsifier and paraffin wax in mineral oü were measured into hom ogenization cells. H om ogenization was carried out at 60° by immersing the cell in a water bath. ITie time and shear rate conditions were the same as for the pre-crystaUization regime. Immediately following homogenization, a sample o f the emulsion was pipetted into an N M R tube, capped and placed in a circulating water bath at 5°C. The type o f emulsion form ed was confirmed by observing w hat happened w hen a drop o f the emulsion was added to either mineral oü or water. Being W /O , when the em ulsion was added to oü, it dispersed. Conversely, when placed in water, the emulsion rem ained as drops on the water's surface. All emulsions were stored for a minimum o f 10 days at 5°C.

2.2.4 Determination of Sedim entation Stability
As a means o f assessing sedimentation behaviour, 4 mL aliquots o f emulsion were pipetted into NM R tubes to a height o f approximately 6 cm and stored at 5°C. The height o f the total system and the height o f the lower opaque phase (dispersed water droplets and wax crystals) were measured to determine the volume fraction o f the sediment. This volume fraction was then measured daily over the course o f 10 days. O ther studies have monitored the degree o f water separation as a function of time (Johansson et ai, 1995d), but this phenomenon was n o t visually apparent in any o f samples prepared in this study.

2.2.5 Determination of Droplet Size Distributions (DSD)
Following homogenization, aliquots o f 0.6 mL were pipetted into NMR
î

tubes to obtain a column height of 1 cm. Droplet size distribution analyses o f the W /O emulsions were carried out using a Bruker Minispec Mq20 Pulsed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (pNMR) unit (Bruker Canada, Milton, O N) equipped with a pulsed gradient unit that allows unimodal characterization of the emulsion droplet size distribution in the W /O emulsions. The principle is based on the restricted diffusion o f water molecules (Tanner & Stejskal, 1968; Fourel et al., 1994,1995). The instrument was calibrated and operated according to the manufacturer's instruction manual (Bruker, 2000). All analyses were performed at 5°C (maintained by a

refrigerated circulating waterbath). Each droplet size distribution measurement took 15 minutes to perform. Initial (t=0) measurements were completed within 30 The instrument is able to differentiate

between water and oil, wax or solid fat molecules due to their different respective proton relaxation times. The instrument calculates the volume-weighted average

droplet size (d^j), the geometric mean droplet diameter (d^^J and the standard deviation o f the log normal distribution o f the droplet diameters. 'ITte relationship between these parameters is defined as; 0^33 = (6) D roplet size distributions were measured at intervals o f 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144 and 240 hours.

2.2.6 Microscopy
Polarized light microscopy (PLM) was used to examine the morphology o f the W /O emulsions after 10 days o f storage. Emulsions were sampled with a

Pasteur pipette and placed on viewing slides (Fisher Scientific, Nepean, O N), upon which a cover slip (Fisher Scientific, Nepean, ON) was gently placed. .A Zeiss

Axioplan-2 light microscope (Zeiss Instruments, Toronto, O N ) with a 63x Achroplan water immersion objective was used and images were captured with a QImaging CCD camera and analysed using N orthern Eclipse software (version 6.0, Empix Imaging, Mississauga, ON). As a minimum, three slides were prepared for each treatment and each photomicrograph represents a t}'pical field.

2.2.7 Statistics
Triplicate analyses were performed on all droplet size measurements and sedimentation experiments. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistical Package vS.O.l using ANOVA and Tukey analysis (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.

R esults and Discussion Sedim entation of Emulsions
Figure 3 shows the visual appearance o f all emulsions after 24 days o f storage

at 5°C. All samples made with pre-crystallized wax flocculated to some degree, as evidenced by visible channels, whereas the samples prepared with post-crystallized wax were more uniform in their appearance, and no sedimentation or flocculation was observed at 1.0 or 2.0% wax. Addition o f as little as 0.125% wax provided notable stabilization to either type o f emulsion (p<0.05) as compared to samples containing no wax. This difference in emulsion stability may be attributed to

differences in the crystal properties when prepared via the different regimes, as discussed in section 2.3.5. The height o f the dispersed phase was measured in relation to the total height o f the emulsion over 10 days (Figure 4). Addition o f 0.125% wax had a profound effect on the stability o f the emulsions to sedimentation over the duration of 10 days compared to samples containing no wax. However, the visual m ethod o f analysis used did not allow for the measurement of the mid-column separation, or channeling that occurred with the pre-cr}'stallized samples as seen in Figure 3. As such, the quantitative data is limited in how accurately it describes the sedimentation behaviour o f the samples over time, and should be considered in conjunction with the photographic evidence.

2.3.2 C o alescen ce Behaviour of Emulsions
D roplet size determination via pN M R has a number o f distinct advantages over light scattering methods. They are in-situ, non-destructive, and allow the

repeated analysis o f individual samples over time. Secondly, the m ethod measures individual droplets although they may in fact be flocculated in a cluster. Light

scattering techniques are based on the theory whereby droplets are assumed to be isolated from each other, and as such, light scattered by flocculated droplets is not properly interpreted (McClements, 1999; Fourel et al, 1995). As shown in Figure 5, initial volume-weighted average droplet diameter (d^j) o f the emulsions' dispersed phase decreased with increasing amounts o f wax for both the pre-crystallized (Figure 5A) and post-crystaUized systems (Figure 5B). An increase in d,^ values over time indicates coalescence o f water droplets has occurred. With emulsions containing pre-crystaUized wax, there is a very rapid initial increase in d,, over the first two days, and then the values remain fairly constant for the remaining observed time. W ith the post-crystaUized emulsions, there is no similar abrupt increase in the initial djj values.

T he percent changes in droplet size from the initial measurements to those taken at 10 days are' compared in Figure 6. A lower percent change is indicative o f enhanced stability o f the emulsion against coalescence. Interpreted this way, there is a significant decrease (p<0.05) in the am ount o f droplet coalescence between 0 and 0.125% solid wax addition in both the pre-crystallized and the post-crystaUized systems. The post-crystallized system, however, exhibited a consistently higher

degree o f stability against droplet coalescence over the pre-crystallized system with the addition o f the same am ount o f wax (p<0.05). This is clearly illustrated in Figure 7. Figures 7A and B show the change in droplet size distribution (recorded at 0 and 10 days) for samples prepared with 0% and 2.0% pre-crystallized wax, respectively. This is in comparison to samples prepared via the post-crystallization m ethod as shown in Figures 7C and D, again for samples with 0% and 2.0% wax, respectively. These concentrations were chosen as they clearly illustrate the different shapes o f the droplet size distributions. Emulsions containing 2.0% post-crystaUized wax (Figure 7D) show the smallest change in droplet size distribution shape as shown by the similarity between the curves representing the droplet size distributions at 0 and 10 days. This sample also had the smaUest breadth o f the distribution indicating a

reduction in coalescence o f both smaller and larger droplets than their precrystaUized counterpards. Samples containing no wax (Figure 7A and C) showed a large increase in the average droplet size and the breadth o f the droplet size distribution. By rapidly crystallizing the wax in the emulsion following

homogenization, the degree o f droplet coalescence can be markedly reduced.

Tlris affinity o f the crystals to the interface is facilitated by the added surfactant. The surface o f tire wax crystals becom es increasingly polar due to adsorption o f tire surfactant (Johansson and Bergenstahl, 1995c). As a result o f this increased polarity it becom es m ore

thermodynamically favourable for the crystals to reside at the o il/w ater interface. This surface activity was seen in samples prepared by b o th m ethods.

2.3.4 M echanism s
As emulsions are thermodynamically unstable, given sufficient time, small

1

droplets will form larger ones and eventually phase-separate. Coalescence requires four steps -- flocculation, thin film drainage, film rupture and merging o f droplets (Johansson et al., 1995d). As described above, W /O emulsions were less stable at lower solids content as there was an insufficient solid mass to surround the droplets and sterically stabilize the aqueous droplets. In samples with higher levels o f solids, flocculation and coalescence was decreased. Lucassen-Reynders (1962) explained

that the energy content o f the bonds in a fat crystal network could be deemed an energy barrier against the free diffusion o f cr}"stals away from the netw ork and towards an interface. O nce formed, this network keeps droplets separate from one another due to the presence o f interstitial crystals thus reducing the rate o f flocculation. When droplets do flocculate, mechanisms o f thin film drainage and film rupture become im portant. A highly viscous and rigid interfacial film laden with

crystals, some o f which may be surface-active, will retard coalescence by slowing the rate o f film drainage and eventual rupture thereby prom oting the kinetic stability o f the emulsion. Given that the systems investigated contained a constant level o f non crystalline emulsifier, the crystal-free rheology o f the interface should be the same for aU samples. Thus, the number, shape and size o f the crystals located at the interface will dictate differences in film drainage and rupture. Particle removal from an

interface is also a necessary precursor to coalescence. Energy requirements for the lateral movem ent o f crj^stals will depend on the com position and rheology o f the interface. Complete displacement o f the crystal from the interface will depend on

23

these two factors as well as the wettabilit}' o f the cn'stals at the interface.

In this

investigation, given the compositions o f the liquid phases were constant, vvettabilitt' o f the cn^stals would also be expected to be the same in all cases. Thus, the factors that can account for the observed differences in flocculation and coalescence stabüit}' are a result o f differences in the nature o f self-association or netw ork form ation between the crj^stals and cr)'stal size, morphology, abundance, and location at the interface.

2.3.5 S tructure of the solid wax p h ase
T hom pson et al. (1985) found that the stabiHt\' o f crude od emulsions was dependent on tlie tem perature histort'^ o f the oil prior to émulsification. Oil that had been rapidly cooled resulted in the formation o f small wax crystals, while the slow cooling o f oü resulted in larger crj'stals. Subsequently, emulsions produced from the
OÜ

containing the small crystals were more stable to démulsification.

W ith the

m ethods o f sample preparation employed here, the wax was crystallized according to two tem perature regimes. The wax in the samples made widi pre-crystalhzcd wax was crystallized by cooling at a slower rate than the samples ciy'stallized following émulsification. The expected result would be the creation o f larger cr)-stals, and

fewer small crystals com pared to tlie quench-cooling crystallization employed in the preparation o f the post-crystallized samples. It is possible that the high shear

conditions o f hom ogenization broke up and disrupted some o f the larger cn^stals predom inant in the pre-crystallized system, but it is unlikely that this changed the relative proportions o f verj- small crj'stals present in either system. T h at is, after

emulsions com pared to the pre-crystallized emulsions with the same percent o f added wax. Smaller crystals are able to provide m ore complete coverage o f emulsion droplets. Crystallization o f wax at a time when an interface is already present would allow the form ed crystals to create a very close-fitting crystalline shell about the droplet and provide effective steric hindrance to coalescence. Such crystallization

behaviour has been observed in butter by Buchheim and Dejm ek (1997) and it is likely that a similar structure is formed in the post-crystallization m ethod where wax is crystallized from the m elt in the presence o f water droplets. T he presence o f these small crystals was not resolvable using PLM. This coating on the water droplets

would provide effective resistance to droplet coalescence, b u t doesn't necessarily explain the resistance o f the post-crystallized emulsions to flocculation and sedimentation. T o explain this phenom enon it is necessary to consider the

rheological properties o f the continuous phase as it relates to the nature o f the wax crystals contained therein. T he presence o f a crj'^stal network would account for the different flocculation behaviour pbserved in the two methods. D roplet sizes were comparable in either case, so tlie differences in flocculation are n o t attributable to differences in sedimentation rates based on droplet size. Rapid crystallization o f the wax followed by static storage o f the emulsion in the case o f the post-crystaUized samples would favour the form ation o f a solid wax network o f fine crystals, evenly distributed through the continuous phase. Given sufficient inter-particle bonds this would

provide a framework, or structure to restrict the m ovem ent o f w ater droplets, thus reducing coalescence, but m ost noticeably

Secondly, any gel-like structure created during the

crj'stallization o f the wax is destroyed upon émulsification resulting in a noncontinuous network. Consequently, the water droplets and the cr}'stals themselves are freer to migrate and the result is the uneven, channelled emulsion observed.

Stabilization of a Water in Canola Oil Emulsion using Crystals of High Melting Fat
introduction
Experience from the analysis o f the model system was applied to a study of

3.1

emulsions composed o f food ingredients.

In order to remain appealing for

consumers, food emulsions must remain stable over long periods o f storage. Being thermodynamically unstable systems, they must be stabilized by improvement of their kinetic stability. It is known that in many emulsified foods solid particles are necessary for emulsions stabilization (e.g. egg yolk particles in mayonnaise). However, surprisingly little study has been made into the specific characteristics of solid particles that will optimize their performance in a given emulsion system. It is in this chapter that a margarine-type W /O system is employed to study the effects that fat crystal morphology, surface interactions (liquid-liquid and liquid-solid), and emulsion preparation technique have on the stabiht}' o f this emulsion system. Methods from the wax and mineral od study were altered as described to suit the different materials.

3.2 3.2.1

Materials and Methods Characterization of B ase Materials
Base materials used in this study included bleached, deodorized canola oil

(CO) containing no additives (as the continuous phase), fully hydrogenated canola stearine (HCO) and fully hydrogenated cottonseed stearine (HCSO) as the crystal phases. These materials were donated by Bunge Foods (Toronto, ON). The canola oil was stored under nitrogen blanket at 5°C to reduce oxidation. Polyglycerol

polyricinoleate (PgPr) is a lipophilic emulsifier (HLB<5) and was provided by

27

Nealanders International Inc. (Mississauga, ON).

In Canada, PgPr is currentlv

approved for use in chocolate at up to 0.50% where it lowers viscosity" during conching and moulding operations. The allowable daily intake o f PgPr as set by the European Communitj' is 7.5 m g/kg body weigh. PgPr is commercially made by the intercsterification o f castor oil fatt)' acids and polyglyccrol (VC51son et ciL, 1998).

3.2.2 Triglycéride (TAG) Profile
The triglyceride composition o f the canola oil, canola stearine and cottonseed stearine were determined by Gas Liquid Chromatography. AOCS M ethod Ce 5-86 (AOCS, 1997) was used as follows: Oven temperature at injection was 70"C followed immediately by ramping to 170"C at 20"C per minute. The ramp rate was then

decreased to 15°C per minute and heating continued through to 350"C. The injector temperature was maintained at 5°C above tire oven temperature. j\ll TAGs were eluted by the time 350°C was reached. A 4m x 0.53 mm (ID) Supelco Petrocol column (Supelco, Oakville, ON) was used with on-column injection in a Perkin Elmer AutoSystem XL GC (Woodbridge, ON).

3.2.3 Fatty Acid Content
The fatty acid content o f the HCO, HCSO and canola oil was determined according to AOCS M ethod Ca 5a-40 (AOCS, 1997).

3.2.4 Melting Point and Solubility of Solid Fats
The melting behaviour o f the HCSO and HCO were determined by two methods. The capillary method (AOCS Method Cc 1-25, (AOCS, 1997)) was used to determine the point o f complete melting. The melting points o f tire fats are

important, as fats should be heated to 30° higher than their melting point prior to recrystallization to erase any crj'stal memorj' (Walstra, 2003). Also, the solid fat

content (SFC) as a function o f temperature was determined using low resolution NM R spectroscopy (AOCS M ethod Cd 16b-93 (AOCS, 1997)). The solubilit}' o f the solid fats in canola oil was determined by turbidometric analysis, as described in section 2.2.2. The sample with the minimum concentration ig o f solid fat showing absorption was interpreted as the maximum solubilit}'^ o f the solid fat in canola oil at 5"C.

3.2.5 X-Ray Diffraction
A Rigaku Geigerflex (Danvers, MA) X-ray diffraction (XRD) unit (k=l.79 A) was used to determine the powder diffractograms o f the solid fats used in the study (HCO and HCSO). Emulsions and crystal-in-oü suspensions were vacuum filtered and analyzed at room temperature (21-24°C). perform ed to evaluate short and long spacmgs. Scans from 1.5 to 35° 2-6 were

3.2.6 Interfacial Tension M easurem ents
Measurements o f interfacial tension between water and canola oil were determined at room temperature using the equipment described in Section 2.2.1. In this case, the density o f the canola oil was 0.912 g/m l. O ther correction factors were the same.

3.2.7 Contact Angle M easurem ents
HCSO and H C O were heated to 90°C and 100°C respectively and cr}'staUized at room temperature in aluminum weigh boats. Solidified disks o f hard fat from the weigh boats were then cut into approximately 1 cm squares and placed with the smooth bottom side up in a cuvette. Cuvettes were then filled with 2 ml o f either canola oü or canola oü with 0.125% (w/w) PgPr (the concentration used in emulsion formation). A small droplet (1-2 mm diameter) o f water was then injected

onto tlie surface of the solid fat using a micro-syringe and stored for 24 hours. Images o f the water droplet were captured with a Tcli CCD camera with macro lens assembly and IDS Falcon/Eagle Framegrabber. Image analysis to determine the

contact angle o f the water droplet against the crystal surface was perform ed using SCA 20 version 2.1.5 build 16 (DataPhysics Instrument G m bH , Germany).

3.2.8 Microscopic Analysis of Emulsions
Polarized light microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to examine the emulsions and the stabilizing role o f the crj'stals, if any. I 'he same microscope was used as in Section 2.2.6. This time image capture was

accomplished using a LSM 510 confocal module and the associated software (I.SM 510, version 3.2, Zeiss Instruments, Toronto, ON). A temperature-controlled stage ('PS-60 stage, Instec Inc., Boulder, CO) was employed to maintain samples at 5°C. Emulsion samples were prepared in the usual manner, except that fluorescent dyes Fluorol Yellow 088 (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakr'-iUe, ON) and Rhodamine B (Acros, Ottawa, ON) were added as stains to tlie oil and water phases, respectively, at 0.01% (w/w). Fluorol Yellow 088 dye present in the oil phase was imaged through

excitation at 488 nm and detection via an LP 505 filter on the CLSM. RJiodamine B dye was excited at 543 nm with the emitted light passing through an LP 560 filter for detection. A controlled test was performed to determine if either dye had any effect on the droplet size distribution o f the emulsions at the time o f formation, or over the course o f 7 days. To do this, four sets o f post-crystallized emulsions were prepared (each in triplicate) containing 1% HCO (see Section 3.2.9 for method). Each set

contained a different combination of dyed and un-dyed liquid phases. W here `X ' 30

emulsion would contain non-dyed water dispersed in oil dyed with Fluorol Yellow 088.) D roplet size distributions were measured at 6 hours and at 7 days using PFG NM R (see Section 2.2.5) and microscopy. To determine droplet size distributions a minimum o f three image fields were captured and the droplets traced and measured using N orthern Eclipse 6.0 image analysis software (Northern Eclipse, Oakville, ON). N o difference was found between the four treatments. Results are presented in Appendix A.

3.2.9 Preparation of Emulsions
Various protocols were developed to prepare emulsions using the food-ty^e materials. As with the investigation using mineral oil, emulsions were prepared using pre and post-crystallization regimes but the conditions employed were altered to suit the change in materials (see below). The goal, as with the model emulsions, vas also to produce initial emulsion droplet size distributions that were comparable between the pre and post-crystallization processes. The pre-crystaUization protocol involved the following steps. A fat ciy'stal stock solution consisting o f 100 g o f 4% (w/w) hard fat in canola oil was heated to 30°C above the melting point o f the pure fat in a 250 m L beaker. The mixture was then cooled at room temperature under conditions of mild shear (240 RPM) using a I.abMaster TS2010 (Lightnin, Etobicoke, ON) fitted with a Rushton-type impeller (6 vanes, 12 mm x 10 mm, overall diameter 50 mm). The mixture was stirred for 6 hours and. then placed in the refrigerator at 5"C. Emulsions containing this crystal stock were made within the next 18 to 24 hours. 31

All final emulsions were 20% (v/v) water witli 0.125% (w/w) PgPr in the oil phase. Appropriate volumes o f water, oil, ciystallized fat oil stock and oil with 0.5% (w/w) PgPr were measured at 5°C into homogenizer cups. Emulsions were immersed in an ice water bath to maintain the temperature near 5°C during the homogenization process. For these pre-crystaUized samples, the homogenizer was operated at 45005700 RPM for one minute to pre-blend, followed by two minutes at 24000-50000 RPM to homogenize. Samples for sedimentation analysis were prepared as per

section 2.2.4. Samples for droplet size analysis were prepared as per section 2.2.5. A variation to the pre-crj^staUized m ethod was also performed, whereby the solid fat was crystallized from the melt in the presence o f 0.125% (w/w) PgPr. With the post-ciystallizcd samples, it was essential to homogenize the sample wltile the high melting fat was still Uquid and then, immediately following émulsification, to quickly cool the sample to form the stearine crj'stals. A 4% (w/w) solution o f the high melting fat in canola oil was heated to 30°C above the melting point o f the pure fat and then maintained at 45°C to prevent reciq^stallization. This was the lowest temperature found at which re-ctystaUization o f the solid fat did n o t occur. O ther com ponents used in the preparation o f the emulsion were also

maintained, combined and homogenized at this temperature, through the use o f a 45°C water bath. After the mixing and homogenization operations noted earher, the homogenization cell was immersed in an ice-water bath and the. speed o f the homogenizer reduced to the mixing speed o f 4500-5700 rpm. Mixing was carried out for 6 minutes, which was determined to reduce the temperature o f the contents to 5°C. The emulsion was then immediately pipetted into NM R tubes for DSD and

DSD measurements for t=0 were completed within 30

minutes o f cessation o f the cooling/mixing step.

H C O and HCSO are manufactuted via the complete hydrogenation of

canola and cottonseed oil, respectively (IV=1). As such, the T A G species present in the H CSO were 2-stearjddipalmitin (PSP) (C50), 1-paImitjddistearin (PSS) (C52) and tristearin (SSS) (C54) (Chang et a.,. 1990; Timms, 1984). primary TAGS were composed o f the unsaturated In the canola oil, the

Being a completely hydrogenated product, the. canola stearine was composed primarily o f the fully saturated tristearine (SSS) (C54) TAG. T he base materials were also analyzed for their free fatty acid content. The results, expressed as a percent based on oleic acid (AOCS, 1997) arc presented in Table 2.

CO and H C O contained similar levels o f free fatty acids. HCSO contained nearly three times as much, by comparison. While HCSO melted at a temperature 7° lower than H CO the solubility^ at the temperature o f emulsion storage was the same. The hydrogenated fats were both found to exhibit sharp melting profiles, but at slightly different temperatures (see Figure 9). Both were, mosdy solid below 50"C and completely liquid at around 65°C for HCSO and 75"C for HCO. The

discrepancy between the melting points determined by the two methods is explained by the limited temperature interv'als o f SFC determination employed in the pN M R

3.3.2 S u rface P h en o m ena
In this section the relationship betw'een the interfacial tension o f tire oil and w ater phases, and the contact angles that are made betw'een this interface and flat solid surfaces o f H CO and HCSO are evaluated. T he behaviour o f micron-sized fat crji'stal particles at droplet interfaces wül be directly related to these macroscopic observations. The interfacial tension between water and canola oil at room tem perature was 28.8 m N m '. T he interfacial tension decreased through the addition o f the emulsifier PgPr as show n in Figure 10. The concentration o f PgPr selected for the study was 0.125%. T he interfacial tension between canola oil and water at this

concentration o f PgPr was 13.4 m N m ' at room temperature. At this concentration, the resulting emulsions (with 0% solid fat) exhibited clearly measurable changes in droplet size over a period o f 10 days storage at 5"C (Figure 11).

Em ulsions made with higher levels o f PgPr were increasingly stable against coalescence. Commercially practical emulsions could be m anufactured at such

higher levels, however, to suit this study, a metastable emulsion system was desired so the effect o f added fat crystals could be clearly observed within a reasonable time frame. The interfacial tension between two liquid phases will influence the contact angle o f a particle adsorbed at this interface. As discussed earlier, for particles to effectively stabilize an emulsion, the particles should ideally be located at the interface, but m ore so within the continuous phase. Thus in the case o f a water in oil emulsion system, the contact angle o f the water against the solid body would be greater than 90°. Typical images o f sessile water droplets are shown in Figure 12. A smaller contact angle is seen for water droplets in tlie presence o f emulsifier com pared to those residing within pure oil. The small `hUls' upon which the droplets appear to sit (Fig. 12A and C) are shadows o f the droplet cast on the solid fat surface. Baselines are drawn where these hüls m eet the droplet base. Average

contact angles (measured through the water phase) for w ater droplets resting on H C O and H C SO in the presence o f CO and CO with PgPr are reported in Table 3.

It is recalled from Section 1.1.1 that a fat crj^stal will be wetted by both the water and oil phases if the following condition is true: (4) T he resolution o f the forces at the junction point is described by Young's Equation (Young, 1855), y cos 6» = cos(l 80 (7)

where 0 is the contact angle as measured through the water phase. The interfacial tension between the water and oil can be modified through the addition of surfactants and is measured as the force required to deform the interface. However, the solid surface cannot be deformed, so neitlier nor y,,, can be measured directly.

To determine the solid/water or soUd/oil interfacial tensions a semi-empirical equation o f state (Good, 1979) may be used: ( o .o i5 r ,, ,- 2 .o o X y ,,, r ,, ) ' = + Vo cos^y = - ------- ^ f ^

(8)

where cos0y is the Young's angle. The Young's angle is the contact angle made by a liquid on a smooth, homogeneous surface o f a specified composition and structure, and where this contact angle changes according to Young's equation. In the current investigation, given the somewhat impure nature o f the raw materials, it is unlikely that the contact angles obscrr-ed are in fact Young's. Using the contact angle data presented in Table 4 and Young's equation (7), Table 4 lists the values o f the solid/water, solid/oil interfacial tensions. We can then use this information to

determine the energy required (Ej,,,p) to displace sub-micron sized fat particles from droplet interfaces with the same inter facial tensions.

associated with these two physical locations o f the particle wiU describe the energy required to displace such a particle of a given size from the interface into the continuous phase. A droplet covered in particles that require larger inputs o f energy to displace them will be more stable against coalescence. If we assume particles o f radius 0.1 ptm, then the energy required to displace particles from the interface would be as listed in Table 4 A particle o f canola stearine in the presence o f emulsifier would require 2.3 times as much energy to displace it from tire interface as would a cottonseed stearine particle under the same conditions. When no PgPr is added to

the canola oil, the energj' o f displacement is less than in the sittiation where PgPr is present. Thus, the addition o f surfactant aids in the stabilizing effect o f the particles.

3.3.3

Destabilization of Emulsions
Destabilization o f emulsions results mainly from four processes, namely:

sedimentation (or cream ing, flocculation, coalescence and Ostwald ripening (Bergenstâhl, 1994).

3.3.3.1 Sedim entation of Emulsions
Figure 13hows the visual appearance o f post-crystaHzed emulsions after 10 days o f storage at 5°C. The white section o f the sample is the dispersed phase (water droplets and solid fat, if present). The clear layer visible on top is canola oil. The cloudy white material visible in a few tubes is small amounts o f water droplets or soHd fat that has adhered to the side o f the tub. A t lower solids levels (i.e. 0.125% and 0.25%) samples made with canola stearine were slightly more resistant to sedimentation than those containing cottonseed stearine. H C O were completely stable against sedimentation. N o samples containing However, less than 5%

supernatant oil was achieved through the addition o f a minimum o f 0.25% canola stearine or 0.50% cottonseed stearine. Typical samples o f emulsions prepared with pre-crystalUzed fats are shown in Figure 14 As seen, most samples sedimented in a very similar fashion, with the exception o f cottonseed samples containing 1 and 2% solid fat that exhibited both sedimentation and a form o f creaming, perhaps due to entrapped air bubbles. After 10 days, samples with no solid fat resulted in a sediment volume o f approximately 45% o f the original emulsion volume. Addition o f solid fat up to 2% increased the

The stabilit}' o f the emulsions was greatly improved through the addition o f solid fat when it was crystallized following émulsification. Conversely, the addition o f fat crystallized prior to émulsification had little effect on the sedimentation stabilit)- of those emulsions.

3.3.3.2

Evolution of W ater Droplet Size Distribution
Droplet size distribution data for each treatment are presented in Appendix

B Regardless o f the m ethod o f preparation, the initial d ,, values are approximately 4 pm, decreasing with added solid fat. Over the course o f 10 da)-s the d-- values

increased by varying degrees depending on the addition o f hard fat. Tlie initial d,,,, values were approximately 4pm for the pre-crystalhzed samples, whereas die initial i-alues for the posr-cri'stallized sample centred at ~2 pm. Again, these initial mean diameter values decreased witli die addition o f solids.

3.3.3.2.1 Post-crystallization Regime
To assess the influence o f solid fat addition on coalescence the percent change in d,*, (ftigure 15A ) and d^, (Figure 15 from day 0 to day 10 is plotted as a function o f percent solid fat in the canola oil phase. W ith the post-ciystallized HCO and HCSO a noticeable improvement in stabilization over ten days was seen for both materials between 0 and 0.50%. fu rth er addition o f solid fat has little effect, for either HCO or HCSO. This stabilization against coalescence coincides with what was obsenred for the stabilization o f the post-cr)'stallized emulsions against sedimentation. Thus, the stabilization against coalescence is likely linked to the Figures 16 and 17 show

decreased sedimentation caused by the added solid fat. 46

M icroscopy
RhodaiTiine B dye was observed to produce a halo effect when used to stain

emulsion droplets (see Fig. 20).

T hat is, w hen imaged using the laser scanning

confocal microscope, the edges o f the observed droplets were brighter than the middle o f the drops. N o such similar effect was observ^ed with Fluorol Yellow 088 stain. A n investigation using a planar (non-droplet) interface between stained water and oil showed a gradual intensification (within approximately 1 hour) o f the fluorescence signal in the region immediately adjacent the interface, suggesting a migration and accumulation o f the dye at or near the interface. The controlled test perform ed to determ ine the effect, if any, o f the dyes on droplet size distributions showed no effect. See Appendix A for results. Figures 20 through 23 show micrographs o f emulsions at 0 and 10 days, at key concentrations o f soHd fat. Corresponding negative PLM images o f the 10-day samples are also shown. W ith the post-crj^staUized samples (Figs. 20 and 21),

crystalline fat is n o t readily discernable at the lower concentrations against the interference produced by droplet interfaces. However, at 2% fat, small crystal

masses can be readily seen. Em ulsion droplets show an increase in size over 10 days, at all concentrations, however, a greater num ber o f smaller droplets are observed at higher solid fat concentrations. The droplets are also less flocculated at higher solid fat concentrations. The network o f crj^stals observable at 2% solid fat appears to be responsible for this observation.

However, with the pre-crj-stallizcd cottonseed stearine (I t^urc 23), smaller crystals are also observed, being especially evident in the sample containing 2% solid fat. T o observe the structure o f the crystal phase w ithout interference caused by water droplets, samples were prepared with CO, emulsifier (0.125% (w/w)) and 2"n (w/w) o f either HCSO or HCO. The sample preparation protocol was the same as used in the preparation o f emulsions, but no water was added. Figure 24 showi.

The relationship between the d,, and d,,, value describes the polydispcrsity o f the emulsion droplets, with their ejuotient. providing the degree o f polvdispersin'. The post-crystallization regime resulted in emulsions with broader size distributions than did the pre-crystallization regime. This difference was also observed in samples with no added solid fat, indicating it was not likely related to any action o f solid fat particles. Water in oil emulsions arc formed via a combination o f turbulent and

\ iscous forces. Had the Reynolds number o f the flow o f the continuous phase been greater than 2500, the approximate droplet diameter o f the dispersed phase could have been approximated bv d = r

where y is the interfacial tension, e the amount o f mechanical energy applied to the system (power density:), and r],. the viscosity o f the continuous phase (Walstra, 200.^). Thus, it was likely that increased temperatures, as were employed in the post crystallization regime would result in decreased C)-W interfacial tensions, which subsecjLiently allowed for the creation o f smaller droplets in a system with a gh'cn energy input.

(Conversely, Figures 27 and 28 show the ratio of d,^ to d,,,, for pre-cr)'stallized emulsions. The ratios are lower than with the post-crystallized systems, with the

cottonseed system being less polydisperse. With the post-cry^stallized samples, the disappearance o f the small droplets is likely due to Ostwald ripening (V(/alstra, 2003). The conditions required for Ostwald ripening to occur, i.e. partial solubility o f the dispersed phase in the continuous phase, moderate in ter facial tension and low osmotic pressure in the dispersed phase, are all met. Ostwald ripening is not

normally o f consequence in food system emulsions as the droplets are usually larger than those found in this study, and hence have a decreased Laplace pressure. As

well, salt is usually present in the aqueous droplets o f m ost food emulsions which results in an osmotic resistance to droplet water loss (Walstra, 2003). In this study no salt was added to the aqueous phase, so this impediment was not present. As in tlie previous study involving paraffin components, the presence o f a crystal network here too would help to account for the different sedimentation behaviour observed in the two methods. Rapid crystallization o f the solid fat

followed by static storage o f the emulsion in the case o f the post-crystallized samples favours the formation o f a network o f fine solid fat crystals, evenly distributed through the continuous phase. Given sufficient inter-particle bonds this would

provide a framework, or structure to restrict the movement o f water droplets, by reducing sedimentation, flocculation and thus coalescence. O n the other hand,

emulsions made with pre-cr\'StaUized stearines would not have this refined network structure. Owing to the cn'stallization kinetics, more large crystals and fewer small

Polymorphic Behaviour of Hydrogenated C ottonseed Stearine
Introduction
I'h e solidification o f lipids from the melt is influenced by many factors.

These factors include the composition o f the lipids themselves, the tem pering regime employed, the presence o f other lipids or additives and the mechanical conditions to which the system is subjected (e.g. shear, agitation, etc.). In the industrial production o f food lipid products these factors are controlled in order to achieve desired polymorpliic and morphological properties. In the production o f margarine, for polym orph

example, to achieve a sm ooth texture and suitable spreadability, the

m ust be the predom inant cr^^stal species. To accomplish this, fats that are naturally ^'-stable may be used, or (3-stable fats may be blended with non-p-tending fats. Additives, such as emulsifiers may also be used in the 0.1 to 0.5% (w/w) range to hinder the §' to p transition. Typical emulsifiers used for this purpose include

monoacyglycerols and sorbitan tristearate. In chocolate products the polymorpliic form o f the continuous cocoa butter phase is critical to the products' organoleptic properties. Careful tempering is used to promote die production o f the metastable P-V crystal form. In Upid systems, kinetics will favour the formation o f a metastable polym orph (i.e. often, but not exclusively, the a-form), while thermodynamics wiU favour the formation o f more stable forms (such as P', but m ore often P). In

accordance with the convention o f Ostwald's law o f stages, nucléation and growth o f the metastable form will predom inate initially. The majority o f our understanding into these polymorphic transitions obsensed in fat systems has been based on observ^ations o f model systems composed o f single triacylglycerols or simple 65

mixtures. W ith respect to natural fats and natural fat blends many questions remain to be answered. In the previous section, solid fat cr)-stals were studied with regards to their effect on the kinetic stabilization of emulsions. O ne o f the fats used for this

purpose, namely hydrogenated cottonseed oil (HCSO), was found to behave in an unexpected m anner with regards to its polymorphism. This section is the result o f further investigations into tliis material. HCSO is commonly used as a j5'-tending fat in margarine and shortening production. In this section it is show n that the final, (stable) polym orphic form and morpholog)^ can be dramatically m odified through diludon, tempering, addition o f polyglycerol polyricinoleate (l^gPr) and conditions o f static or dynam ic crystallization.

Materials and Methods
Fully hydrogenated cottonseed oil (HCSO) and canola od (CO) were as those

used and characterized previously in Section 3.3.1. Both were used w ithout further purification, d'hc lipophilic emulsifier, Polyglyccrol polvricinoleaie (I'gPr) was also used and described previously. PgPr is used in margarine production to stabilize fats in the jS' polym orph. Solutions o f 4% (w/w) HCSO in CO were crr-stallized from the melt to either 5°C or 25"C. Figure 29 shows typical cooling curries for HCSO cr)'staUized under static conditions to each o f the final temperatures. Cooling

conditions were ver)' similar for all samples w hether cn'stallizcd with or w ithout stirring or w ith or w ithout the addition o f PgPr. Stirring was achieved using a

Rushton-tt'pe im pellor at 240 rpm. PgPr was added at 0.25% (w/w).

PgPr

Crystallization under static conditions with PgPr produced cry-stals with a lA decrease in the d(OOl) reflection. The combination o f agitation and PgPr resulted in a ~3A decrease in lamellar thickness compared to the HCSO crystallized under static conditions, free o f PgPr. According to I.utton et al. (1948), the first order reflection o f SSS occurred at 45.1 SA, while the first order reflection o f PSS occurred at 44.' ^A. Thus, the (3-indicative diffraction pattern o f the diluted HCSO was dominated by these two TAG species and not PSP.

The short spacings observed provided much inform ation about the crystallization behaviour o f HCSO (Figure 33). When HCSO was statically

crystallized, with and w ithout PgPr, the results were similar and indicated strong 13crystal spacings at 3.69, 3.86 and 4.59A. There was also a peak in the 5.25-5.35À region. Lutton et al. (1948) showed that SSS when in the p-form was partly

characterized by a peak o f medium intensity' at 5.24Â, while PSS when present in the p-form dem onstrated a reflection at 5.34Â. Thus it appears that these short spacing represent a combined effect o f SSS and PSS. When crystallized with agitation the HCSO spectrum was similar in form but with a reduced intensity possibly suggesting a "destructuring" o f the crystal structure. The combination o f both PgPr and

agitation during crystallization produced dramatic changes in the short spacings. The reflection at 3.69A disappeared, and the peaks at 3.86 and 4.59 A shifted to peaks at 3.82A and 4.5SA. There was also a large hump observed in the 4.02-4.40A region. These observations suggest the simultaneous existence o f alpha, P' and p forms. The short spacings for HCSO crystallized at 25°C are shown for comparison. Polarized light microscopy o f samples crystallized at 5°C (Figure 34) showed spherulitic crystal morphology for all samples. These spherulites were smaller than X: those produced via cooling to 25°C being about 15-20 pm in size. Spherulites

crj'staUized with agitation and PgPr appeared denser than those produced via other treatments.

O ften in processed foods a fat will be mixed with an oil to obtain specific physical and theological properties. U pon düurion many naturally occurring fats are kineticaUy driven to their m ost stable polym orphic form (deMan el al., 1995; Gray, 1976; Rousseau ef al., 1996). W hen allowed to do so, cr^'stals wül normally adopt

their m ost thermodynamically stable state. W ith the diluted H CSO , it would have been expected that the lipid molecules would ad o p t the m ore favourable p-form. As show n earlier, 100% H CSO is stable in the p' form, however, upon dilution in canola oil, it can be cq^stallized into stable jl' or p-form crj'stals. It is thus left to determine how dilution influences this p' to p transition. O ne possibility would be that the

(1985) showed th at triolein (O O O ) oil does n o t incorporate itself into the lattice o f tripalmitan (PPP) w hen it is diluted in the latter and cr^'stallized. This incompatibility may be explained, at least in part, by the curved ds bonds present in the oleic hydrocarbon chains o f O O O that would n o t fit into the lattice o f the ciy stallizing TA G s (Klisabettini, 1995). AU the same, dilution should aUow TA G s o f H CSO to m ore freely rotate and ad o p t a lower energy' thus enabling a p' to p polym orplûc transition. W ith 100% H C SO irregularities in chain length create an energy barrier against crystallization that is larger than that encountered in pure TA G s (Larsson, 1971). H C SO is com posed o f both PSP (P'-stable) and SSS/PSS (p-stable), and as such there may be segregation o f these two T A G classes explaining the broad first order long spacings (Hernqvist, 1988).

U ndiluted HCSO was found to be p'-stable regardless o f cooling regime. It w ould be expected that cooling slowly to 25°C would result in a m ore stable polym orph, while cooling m ore quickly to 5°C m ight result in a metastable polym orph that would then undergo a solid state transformation to a m ore stable form. ( However, when diluted and cooled more quickly to 5°C, HCSO formed a pstable polym orph, while cooling m ore slowly resulted in the formation o f a p'-stable form. DSC o f the crystallization o f diluted HCSO shows that a p' to p transition is Ij I I i! not visible at 25°C (Figure 35A), but is observed when cooling to 5 X IFigure 35B). case it is seen to occur as a solid-state transformation. The enthalpy o f

crystallization was 4.3-S.2 J /g for all events. N o a-form crystallization was observed in either scenario, indicating that crystallization occurred directly into the p' form. In a study o f num erous hydrogenated fats, Riiner (1970) noted a similar phenom enon.

Gib on et al. (1986) found in a study on the intersolubilit)' o f PSP, P O P and SSS, that w hen the p' form was crj'stallized via the a-form it was less stable than when crj'stallized directly from tlie melt. This was attributed to cn'stal perfection. In the present study, cooling to 25°C resulted in the formation o f a highly ordered p' form, whereas cooling m ore quickly to 5"C resulted in a poorly form ed p' that quickly transform ed to p. PgPr and agitation had litde effect on HCSO cr)'stallization. W hen cooling to 25"C, H C SO crystal dimensions were n o t affected by agitation o r PgPr, though agitation did prom ote larger cr^^stal a^lom erates. As PgPr addition did n o t affect short or long spacings, it was likely n o t incorporated into the lattice. Similar results were obtained when cooling to 5"C, with tire exception o f agitation com bined with PgPr. It is possible that PgPr incorporation slowed the alpha to p' to p Agitation may allow PgPr to be incorporated by means o f

transform ation.

C onclusions
This study investigated the stabilization o f water in oil emulsions through the

addition o f solid phase crystals o f wax o t fat.

Stability was assessed based on It was dem onstrated that

sedimentation, flocculation and coalescence behaviour.

small quantities o f solid particles were able to effectively stabilize these emulsions. Two main types o f systems were considered; a basic, model system, and a real world, or applied system. The factors affecting the ability^ o f these ciystals to stabilize

emulsions were the cty-stal structure o f the solid wax or fat phase, the wetting behaviour o f the solid and the concentration o f the solid phase. These findings are relevant to the disciplines o f food, pharmaceutical and crude oil sciences.
