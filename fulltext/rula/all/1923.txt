Decomposition o f High Organic and M oisture Content Municipal Solid Waste in Bioreactor Landfills Hui Jin M.A.Sc., Civil Engineering Department, Ryerson University, 2005

Abstract With the increase in waste recycling, municipal solid waste (MSW) with high organic and moisture contents are found in various landfills worldwide. If this kind o f waste were put into anaerobic condition directly, the pH values will decrease sharply, which will seriously affect the biodégradation of the wastes. This study is aimed to investigate the decomposition o f this type o f MSW in aerobic condition before the anaerobic biodégradation. In the study, the effects o f air addition and biosolids addition on the biodégradation of MSW with high organic and moisture contents were examined. Moreover, the flushing technology was compared with the leachate recirculation technology. Six simulated bioreactor landfills were set up. After about 100 days' operation, it was observed that ( 1 ) the mass reduction rate in the aerobic-anaerobic bioreactor was approximately five times of that in the anaerobic bioreactor, the leachate quality was much better than that in the anaerobic bioreactor based on the final COD, BOD;, TS, and NH; concentrations. (2 ) biosolids have strong buffering effects and the addition o f biosolids accelerated the anaerobic biodégradation progress to a great extent. Therefore, it was concluded that initially degrading MSW under aerobic condition before anaerobic degradation with biosolids addition is the optimum strategy for the decomposition o f MSW with high organic and moisture contents.

1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Generation and Management o f Municipal Solid Waste Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) include residential, commercial, and non-hazardous industrial wastes but exclude combustion ash, hazardous waste, sludge, and industrial process wastes. However, many of these other wastes are often deposited in the same landfills that receive MSW (Hilger and Barlaz, 2002). Therefore, many researchers use "refuse" instead of MSW for solid waste. The generation of MSW has become an increasingly important worldwide issue over the last decade, because of the escalating growth in municipal populations, and the concomitant increase in waste production per capita. In 1997, 217,000,000 tons of MSW was generated in the U.S.A. alone, 8,000,000 tons more than 1996 (USEPA 1999). In 1994, Canadians disposed of 715 kg of solid waste per capita per year, totaling approximately 22,000,000 tons nationwide (Takata, 2002). The increase in solid waste generation has promoted the development of the integrated management o f MSW that is accomplished by recycling, composting, incineration, or landfilling of wastes. Among these methods, to date, the sanitary landfill is the

predominant municipal solid waste disposal alternative because it is less expensive with less air pollution problems comparing with combustion, and there is a limit to the types of waste that can be recycled or composted (Hilger and Barlaz, 2002). Despite an increase in recycling, composting, and incineration, approximately 55% by weight of the MSW generated in the United States in 1997 was deposited in sanitary landfills (USEPA, 1999).

L.2 D evelopm ent o f Sanitary L andfilling n the past, a landfill often represented little m ore than an open hole o r mash where refuse vas dum ped. The refuse was often not covered properly, som etim es it was burned for volum e eduction, and there was little effort to control storm w ater runoff and dow nw ard m igration o f vater that had com e into contact with the refuse (Barlaz, 1997). With the im plem entation o f ncreasingly stringent regulations, landfills have becom e highly engineered facilities with lophisticated containm ent systems, environmental monitoring, and im proved operational practices. \ s a generality, a typical dry landfill has an im perm eable bottom liner, the wastes are ielivered to the landfill, spread out, com pacted and covered at the end o f the day with a thin ayer o f soil, until a planned depth is reached, then the w aste is covered with an im perm eable :ap. The environm ental barriers such as landfill liners and covers exclude m oisture that is essential to waste biodégradation. Consequently, wastes are contained in a "dry tom b" and em ain intact for long periods o f time ranging from 30 to 200 years, possibly in excess o f the ife o f the landfill barriers and covers. Liner failure could happen in conventional dry

andfill som etim e in future, which can cause serious groundw ater and surface water contamination (Warith, 2003). Nowadays, siting new landfills has been very difficult and costly not only because landfills can threaten the environm ent, b u t also because the public opposition, this often called the MIMBY, or not in my back yard, syndrom e. Therefore, the condition appeals to investigators ;o m ake efforts to m ake landfills m ore econom ically sound and environm entally friendly (Stessel and M urphy, 1992).

Today, the "bioreactor landfill" is one idea that has gained significant attention. A bioreactor landfill is a sanitary landfill that uses enhanced microbiological processes to transform and stabilize the readily and moderately decomposable organic waste constituents within 5 to 10 years o f bioreactor process implementation. The bioreactor landfill significantly increases the extent of organic waste decomposition, conversion rates and process effectiveness over what would otherwise occur within the landfill (Pacey et al., 1999). The "bioreactor landfill" provides control and process optimization, primarily through the addition of leachate or other liquid amendments, the addition of sewage sludge or other amendments, temperature control, and nutrient supplementation (Reinhart et al., 2002). Beyond that, bioreactor landfill operation may involve the addition of air. Based on waste biodégradation mechanisms, different kinds of "bioreactor landfills" including anaerobic bioreactors, aerobic bioreactors, and aerobic-anaerobic (hybrid) bioreactors have been constructed and operated worldwide. According to the survey conducted by the Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA) in 1997, there were over 130 leachate recirculating landfills in USA (Gou and Guzzone, 1997; Reihart et al., 2002). Generally, there are four advantages for employing bioreactor landfill technology comparing to conventional dry landfills; (1) contain and treat leachate, (2) rapidly recover air space, (3) accelerate waste stabilization and avoid long-term monitoring and maintenance and delay siting of a new landfill, and (4) make more potential benefits from increased methane generation in anaerobic bioreactor landfill. For aerobic bioreactor landfills, there are three additional advantages; (1) significant increase in the biodégradation rate o f the MSW over anaerobic processes, (2) a reduction in the volume o f leachate, and (3) significantly reduced

methane generation and " anaerobic" odors. However, C osts for continuous supply o f air are excessively high fo r municipal solid waste treatm ent (Hanashima, 1999). 1.3 C om position o f M SW M SW com position can vary substantially with location and time depending on many factors, including socio-econom ic and clim atic conditions, waste collection and disposal methods, sampling, and sorting procedures (El-Fadel and Khoury, 2000). The com position o f buried M SW influences the biodégradation processes in the landfill ecosystem , which then affect not only landfill gas (LFG ) production and com position but also leachate quality and quantity. The biggest environm ental problem associated with landfilling practice is the generation o f
f-

leachate and gas. Leachate is generated prim arily as a result o f precipitation falling on an active landfill surface, although other contributors to leachate generation include groundw ater inflow, surface w ater runoff, m oisture from em placed waste, and biological decom position (Reinhart and Tow nsend, 1998). A naerobic degradation o f organic m atters in landfills leads to the generation o f LFG containing methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and trace concentrations o f a range o f vapors and gases. M ethane is a very active greenhouse gas. Globally, landfills are the fourth largest anthropogenic source o f m ethane emissions, releasing 22 to 36 million metric tons o f m ethane annually (D oom and Barlaz, 1995). M any studies have examined the chem ical com position o f M SW (B arlaz et al., 1989a; Ham et al., 1993; R hew and Barlaz, 1995; Eleazer et al., 1997; Ress et al., 1998). Table 1-1 presents typical organic com position o f MSW. C ellulose and hem icellulose represent the m ajor degradable com ponents o f MSW. In contrast, lignin is essentially recalcitrant under m ethanogenic conditions; poly lignin is mineralized to

COi and CH» in anoxic sediments at slow but environmentally significant rates (Colberg, 1988). It was reported that cellulose plus hemicellulose fraction of MSW accounts for 91 % of its methane potential (Barlaz et al., 1990). Proteins and soluble sugars are other biodegradable organic materials that are present in smaller concentrations (Hilger and barlaz,

2002 ).

MSW recycle programs significantly contributed to change the composition of MSW, as well as the methane production from landfilled MSW. The actual methane yield of MSW decreased by 10% between the base case with no recycling (64.9 L wet kg "') and a case in which 31 % of MSW is recycled (58.6 L wet kg ') (Eleazer et al., 1997). 1.4 O bjective of This Study With the increase in waste recycling and diversion, most dry waste (including paper, paperboard, bottles, cans as well as white goods) were diverted from the MSW stream which in turn increased the percentage of wet waste stream in the waste disposed in landfills, which included food wastes, yard trimmings, low-grade papers and inert residuals. In the wet waste stream, organic materials generally have high percentage, that could reach approximately

50% to 90% o f the total m ass o f the MSW, and m oisture content is also very high. These ypes o f M SW can be found recently in several cities around the developed w orld, such as Toronto, and developing countries, such as the City o f Istanbul (San and Onay 2001). If this and o f wastes w ere p u t into anaerobic condition directly, the pH values will decrease sharply, vhich will seriously affect the degradation of the wastes. This study aims to examine the effect o f initially degrading M SW with high organic and noisture contents under aerobic conditions prior to the anaerobic phase. Air addition was itilized to accelerate the degradation o f the easily biodegradable organic materials as well as o create optim um environm ent for the downstream anaerobic degradation in bioreactor andfills. The objective o f this study is threefold; 1. Exam ine the perform ance benefits o f aerobic - anaerobic bioreactor landfills for treating high organic and m oisture content wastes com paring to anaerobic bioreactor landfills.

2. Exam ine the perform ance benefits o f biosolids addition for the decom position o f M SW with high organic and moisture contents in aerobic - anaerobic bioreactor landfills.

3. C om pare the perform ance of the closed-loop leachate recirculation bioreactor landfills with single -p a s s b ioreactor landfills.

Bioreactor landfills provide an innovative approach to control, monitor, and optim ize the ivaste stabilization processes inside landfills rather than contain the w astes like "dry tom bs" . Actually, they are m ore like organic solid waste digesters. In the newly developed aerobic or semi-aerobic bioreactor landfills, air is injected into the w aste matrices, to increase the speed

and extent of the organic waste degradation. Furthermore, offensive anaerobic odors can be removed. The degradation mechanism o f the aerobic bioreactor landfills is similar to that of composting. In comparison, bioreactors have more benefits than composting: (1) land requirement would be less, (2 ) degradation would be enhanced because bioreactors have lining and capping, thus, airflow would be constant compared to periodic turning in composting (Stessel and Murphy, 1992). It is hoped the this study finding will be applicable either in developed countries or in developing countries where MSW contains high organic and moisture contents in most cases. 1.5 Hypothesis Active aeration will accelerate the degradation rate o f MSW with high organic and moisture content, and decrease the time to stabilization.

2. LIT E R A T U R E REVIEW 2.1 T he A naerobic D egradation o f M SW in B ioreactor L andfills 2.1.1 The A naerobic D ecom position Process in B ioreactor L andfill Ecosystem The technologies o f enhancing biodégradation o f organic w aste in bioreactor landfills can be possibly developed upon understanding the basic biochem ical processes that occur in such ecosystem . N um erous studies have been carried out on the anaerobic biodégradation process in the landfills. M any researchers (R einhart and Al-Yousfi, 1996; Christensen and Kjeldsen,

1989; B arlaz et al., 1989a) have characterized the stabilization o f wastes in term s o f an idealized sequence o f phases betw een the burial o f fresh M SW and w ell-decom posed waste. Som e investigations have suggested that the stabilization o f waste proceeds in five sequential and distinct phase (Pohland and H arper, 1986; Reinhart and Townsend, 1998). The rate and characteristics o f produced leachate and biogas vary from one phase to another, and reflect the m icrobially mediated processes taking place inside the landfill (Reinhart and Al-Yousfi, 1996). M ajor bacterial groups involved in this decom position process include hydrolytic bacteria, ferm entative bacteria, acetogenic bacteria, m ethanogenic bacteria and sulphate-reducing bacteria. following. The phases experienced by degrading wastes are described as

Phase I: In itial A djustm ent Phase
In the aerobic phase, both oxygen and nitrate are consum ed, with soluble sugars serving as the carbon source for m icrobial activity. The quantity o f oxygen available is fairly low, depending on the degree to which the w aste is com pacted. All o f the trophic bacteria groups required fo r M SW m ethanogenesis are present in fresh M SW (cellulolytics, acetogens, and

methanogens), though there is little change in their populations (Barlaz et al., 1989a). In addition, this initial phase is associated with initial placement o f solid waste and accumulation o f moisture within landfills. An acclimation period (or initial lag time) is observed until sufficient moisture develops and supports an active microbial community (Reinhart and Al-Yousfi, 1996).

Phase II: Transition Phase
With the depletion of oxygen trapped within a landfill, a transformation from an aerobic to anaerobic environment occurs, and the facultative anaerobic microorganisms become active. The electron acceptors shift from oxygen to nitrates and sulfates (Reinhart and Al-Yousfi, 1996; Reinhart and Townsend, 1998). The hydrolytic and fermentative microorganisms hydrolyze polymers such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The initial products of polymer hydrolysis are soluble sugars, amino acids, long-chain carboxylic acids, and glycerol (Barlaz et al., 1990). By the end of this phase, measurable concentrations of COD and volatile organic acids can be detected in the leachate (Reinhart and Townsend, 1998). In addition, the ammonia can be detected due to the hydrolysis and fermentation of protein compounds.

Phase III: Acid Formation Phase
During the first stage o f this phase, the intermediates produced from Phase II, such as sugars, amino acids, long-chain carboxylic acids, and glycerol, are further fermented into short-chain carboxylic acids, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. Acetate and alcohols are also formed. During the second stage of this phase, the obligate proton-reducing acetogens become active. They oxidize the fermentation products of the first stage to acetate, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. The conversion of short-chain carboxylic acids to acetate is only thermodynamically

favorable at very low hydrogen concentration. T he therm odynam ic favorability o f reactions recognized as potentially operative during landfill stabilization is presented in Table 2-1 (Pohland and Kim, 2000 ). In nearly all cases, the role o f hydrogea (H2) is apparent and has led not only to the suggestion that H2 will regulate reaction opportunity and pathway, but the relative predom inance o f process intermediates as well. H owever, there is a hydrogen-scavenging population, i.e., m ethanogens in an active anaerobic ecosystem. If ferm entative and m ethanogenic activities are not balanced, interm ediates will accum ulate and may percolate from the landfill as leachate (Barlaz et al., 1990 ). Therefore, interm ediate volatile fatty acids (VFAs) at high concentrations and a decrease in pH accom panied by metal species m obilization are often observed before the onset o f M SW methanogenesis. The viable biom ass grow th associated with the acid form ers bacteria, and rapid consum ption o f substrate and nutrients are the predom inant features o f this phase (R einhart and Al-Yousfi, 1996 ).

Phase IV : M ethane Ferm entation Phase
During phase IV, both m ethanogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria are involved in the

10

anaerobic degradation. The hydrophilic methanogenic bacteria transform hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methane, and the acetophilic methanogenic bacteria transform acetic acid into methane and carbon dioxide. The rate of methane production increases rapidly to some maximum value. Methane gas constitutes approximately 50-60% (by volume) o f gas composition (Barlaz, et al., 1990; Warith and Sharma, 1998). The pH value is increased, and consequently heavy metals are removed by precipitation. The organic matter present in the leachate declines, which causes the BOD and COD to fall. In the mean time, sulphate-reducing bacteria convert hydrogen, acetic acid and higher VFAs into carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. This group o f bacteria competes with the

methanogenic bacteria to transform the hydrogen and organic carbon. Based on their findings, Gurijala and Suflita (1993) indicated that methanogenesis might be limited to an unknown degree by the availability o f sulfate. Fairweather and Barlaz (1998) reported that the presence of sulfate decreased methane yields, but sulfate reduction and methane production can occur concurrently during MSW decomposition and methanogenesis is the dominant electron sink process even in the presence of excess sulfate.

Phase V. Maturation Phase
During phase V, the easily biodegradable organic matter is stabilized, and nutrients and available substrate become limiting. Gas production drops dramatically and leachate strength stays steady at much lower concentrations. Reappearance of oxygen and oxidized species may be observed slowly (Reinhart and Al-Yousfi, 1996; Reinhart and Townsend, 1998). Concurrently, there is an increase in the rate of cellulose plus hemicellulose hydrolysis. The low level biodegradable matter gradually humifies (formation o f complex molecules such as

11

flumic acid and filvic acid). MSW degradation time span ranges from 30 to 100 years in traditional landfill ecosystem. However, with leachate recirculation, the tem poral dom ain o f the acid form ation and m ethane Fermentation phases is com pressed, and accelerated stabilization o f the readily degradable waste fractions typically leads to either accum ulation and retention o f m ore aggressive leachate during acid form ation phase, or higher gas production/recovery potential and m ore stable leachate during subsequent methane ferm entation phase than is encountered at conventional landfills (Pohland and Kim, 1999). This idealized waste degradation sequence assumes that the waste is hom ogeneous and o f constant age. A realistic landfill occupying waste cells with highly variable age and com position may yield a som ew hat different picture (Barlaz et al., 1989b). In a large-scale

landfill where waste is placed over a lengthy period o f time, the w aste stabilization phases tend to overlap and the leachate and gas characteristics reflect this phenom enon. 2.1,2 G overning A biotic F actors for A naerobic D egradation

Moisture C ontent
M oisture content is a critical factor affecting the rate and extent o f organic waste decom position. The benefits o f increased w ater content in a landfill include limiting oxygen transport from the atm osphere, facilitating exchange o f substrate, nutrients, buffer, and dilution o f inhibitors and spreading o f microorganism s within the landfill. The stim ulatory effect o f m oisture content on anaerobic populations has been proved by num erous studies. Jones et al. (1983) characterized refuse sam ples from a sanitary landfill as a function o f depth below the surface. The total anaerobic population as well as the populations o f proteolytic,

12

amylolytic, and cellulolytic bacteria increased near the water table, suggesting a stimulatory effect of moisture content. Protease and amylase activity increased sharply in the water table, which is consistent with the differences in enzyme activity between wet and dry refuse measured under laboratory conditions (Jones and Grainger, 1983; Barlaz, et al., 1990). The strong effect o f moisture content was also seen in the correlations of total mass loss and moisture content according to the research results performed in full-scale landfills (Baldwin et al., 1998).

pH
At neutral pH, the bacteria responsible for MSW decomposition are most active. The optimal pH for refuse methanogenesis is 6.4 to 7.2 (Chugh et al., 1998). As discussed in the former section, the role o f hydrogen is crucial, and the methanogen is hydrogen-scavenger. In low pH conditions, the activity of methanogenic bacteria is low. As a result, their conversion of hydrogen and acetic acid decreases. This causes the hydrogen pressure to build up, and at elevated pressures, acetogenic bacteria cannot convert volatile fatty acids, particularly butyric and propionic acid. The accumulation of these acids further lowers the pH within the landfill, and eventually stops methane production (Warith and Sharma, 1998). Therefore, the addition of buffering materials during bioreactor landfill operation is a critical strategy to maintain appropriate pH as well as balance relations between the various bacterial groups. The pH effect on the waste degradation is illustrated by the full-scale landfill studies in which a higher pH is correlated with more decomposed refuse reflected by the relationship between cellulose plus hemicellulose to lignin and pH (Ham et al., 1993; Mehta et al., 2002).

Nutrients
In landfill ecosystem , the anaerobic degradation o f wastes particularly need such nutrients as nitrogen and phosphorous besides organic matters. T he anaerobic ecosystem requires m uch less nitrogen and phosphorous than the aerobic system which assimilates much substrate into new cells. The optim al ratio between organic m atter (expressed as CO D), nitrogen and phosphorous is 100:0.44:0.08 (Christensen and Kjeldsen, 1989). In general, the well-m ixed w aste landfill will not be limited by nitrogen and phosphorous. Som etim es, the heterogeneity o f landfill may limit the nutrients' availability to m icroorganism . O ther m icronutrients, e.g. sulphur, calcium , magnesium, potassium , iron, zinc, copper, cobalt, m olybdanate and selenium, are found to be present in m ost landfills.

Temperature
M any studies have proved m icrobiological degradation rate increases along with tem perature increase. The van't H off-A rrhenius equation (M etcalf and Eddy, 1991 ) is one o f the m ost used equations that form ulate the relationship betw een degradation rate and tem perature as following:

[ 1]
where: k, = degradation rate constant at a particular tem perature; k2o = degradation rate constant at 20°C = 0.23; 0 = constant o f 1.056 for tem peratures betw een 20 and 30°C; and T = tem perature for which k is desired. The investigation done by Baldwin et al. (1998) tested this relationship as welh Blakey et al. (1997) docum ented that the role o f tem perature may be an im portant factor offering the potential means o f m anipulating the methane content o f LEG Rees (1980) observed that the

14

optimum temperature for methane production from domestic refuse in a conventional anaerobic digester is about 40°C. Hartz et al. (1982) found that 41 °C was the optimum for the generation of methane on a short-term basis, and methane generation would cease somewhere between 48 and 55°C. Mata-Alvares and Martina-Verdure (1986) reported the optimum temperature is 34 °C to 38 °C. In addition, it was documented that the rate o f methane generation increased significantly (up to 100 times) when the temperature was raised from 20 to 30 and 40°C in laboratory simulations (Christensen and Kjeldsen, 1989).

Inhibitors
The anaerobic ecosystem is considered to be rather sensitive to inhibitors. Researchers have reported many inhibitors of anaerobic degradation, e.g. oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, proton activity, salt ions, sulphide, heavy metals, and specific organic compounds (Christensen and Kjeldsen, 1989). Cations such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and ammonium have been observed to stimulate anaerobic decomposition at low concentration while inhibit it at high concentrations. High sulphate concentration can inhibit methane generation. It has been speculated that COzacts as an inhibitor through the raising of the redox potential (Hansson, 1982), or the impairment o f the methanogen cell membrane function by increasing its fluidity through COzdissolving in the cell membranes of methanogens (Senior & Kasali, 1990). Additionally, it is possible that CO 2 acts as an end-product inhibitor during acetate and propionate degradation. 2.1.3 Technologies of Enhancing Degradation in Anaerobic Bioreactor Landfill As discussed above, the principal and governing factors in the anaerobic degradation are very

15

:lear. H ow to m anipulate these factors to accelerate the w aste stabilization rate and get Denefits from landfill is what num erous researchers have been attem pting during the past over Î0 years. M any technologies have been examined and applied in full-scale practices. The stabilization means that the environmental perform ance m easurem ent param eters (LFG com position, generation rate and leachate constituent concentrations) remain at steady levels, ind should not increase in the event o f any partial containment system failures beyond 5 to 10 /ears o f bioreactor process im plem entation (Pacey et al., 1999). Therefore, the stabilization

]f w aste is quantified by leachate quality, gas com position and production, landfill settlement. The effects o f the following technologies are evaluated according to these aspects.

Leachate Recirculation a n d M oisture Control
Previous experiences and researches have indicated that m oisture content is a critical factor in enhancing w aste decom position in bioreactor landfills. M oreover, som e studies indicated not Dnly m oisture content but also m oisture m ovem ent could affect waste stabilization. Therefore, moisture control (including m oisture content and movement) is the essential for landfill operation. Leachate recirculation has been dem onstrated to be a superior management strategy for m oisture control. The study o f leachate recirculation in landfills has attracted num erous researchers since mid 1970s (Pohland, 1975a, b, 1980; M ata-A lvarez and M artinez-Viturtia, 1986; Barlaz et al., 1990; Reinhart and Al-Yousfi, 1996; Reinhart, 1996; Pohland and Kim, 1999; San and Onay, 2001 ; M ehta et al., 2002). Through leachate recirculation, liquid m ovem ent distributes the inocula, minimizes local shortages o f nutrients, provides b etter contact betw een insoluble substrates, soluble nutrients, and the m icroorganism s, dilutes potential toxins, and transfers heat. As a result, m icrobial activities

16

are increased. The advantages of leachate recirculation include: providing in-situ leachate treatment instead of off-site treatment, thus saving costs; enhancing waste settlement, thus decreasing the risk of damage to the final cover and permitting recovery of valuable landfill air space; increasing gas generation rate which make energy recovery more favorable; accelerating waste decomposition, thus shortening the post closure monitoring period and reducing the overall landfill operation cost. have tested all these advantages. Poland (1975 a, b) conducted studies on accelerating solid waste stabilization and leachate treatment by leachate recycle in simulated landfills. He concluded that the capture and recirculation o f leachate through a simulated landfill can promote a more rapid development of an active anaerobic bacterial population of methane former, increase the rate and predictability o f stabilization of readily available organic pollutants, dramatically decrease the time required for stabilization, and reduce the potential for environmental impairment. Between 1993 and 1996 two pilot scale test cells were constructed at Yolo County, California, USA. Each cell has a surface area of about 930 m" and initial 12 m depth (Yolo Co., 1997; Laboratory, pilot scale and full-scale studies

Mehta, et al., 2002). One cell was designated the "enhanced" cell in which supplemental liquid was added and leachate was recirculated. The "control" cell was constructed identically to the "enhanced" cell, however no liquid has been added. The two cells began operation in 1996. After about 3 years o f operation, Mehta, et al. (2002) performed a comparison of the two test cells to evaluate the effects o f leachate recirculation on refuse decomposition. After analyzing 44 samples from 33 distinct depth intervals and collecting the gas generation data and waste settlement data, Mehta, et al. (2002) arrived to the conclusion that the leachate recirculation

17

has the potential to enhance settlement, methane production, and solids decomposition at field-scale. R efuse w as excavated in three borings from the enhanced ceil and tw o borings

from the control cell. The m oisture content analysis shows that the average m oisture content in these samples range from 34 to 38 % in the enhanced cell, while the average m oisture content in the control cell ranged from 14.6 to 19.2%. These data illustrate that leachate recirculation increase m oisture content in enhanced cell. Leachate recirculation increased both m ethane production (63.1 versus 27.9 L CH 4 wet kg ' over 1231 days) and w aste settlement (15.5% versus 3% o f the waste thickness). During record period, the total volum e o f leachate recycled in the enhanced cells is equivalent to 570 L metric ton '. This volum e should increase the refuse m oisture content in the enhanced cell to 46% . However, only 2 o f 33 collected sam ples reached this value. This illustrates that the liquid likely flow through the preferential flow paths in the waste. Therefore, the design o f the system used for the distribution o f recycled leachate is a critical ' Factor for achieving good m oisture management in bioreactor landfill. Townsend et al. (1996) also presented the effects o f leachate recycling on landfill stabilization at an existing lined landfill in N orth-Central F lorida during the period from 1989 through July 1993. Leachate was recirculated to the landfill by means o f an infiltration pond. The area o f the landfill east o f the ponds was left untreated to serve as the control area. The results indicated that leachate recycling significantly increased m oisture content o f the landfilled waste, and m aintained conditions suitable for biological stabilization. The results o f the settlem ent analysis illustrate the greatest subsidence occurred in the area close to the infiltration pond at 1.01 m (5.65% volum e reduction), and the least subsidence was measured

18

in the area farthest from the leachate recycle ponds at 0.69 m (3.82% volume reduction). The original average biochemical methane potential (BMP) from biodegradable organic fraction (BDOF) samples in the recycling area was 0.273 m^ CH 4 kg decreased to 0.196 volatile solids (VS), and

CH4 kg 'VS. In contrast, the original average BMP from BDOF CH4 kg ''V S, and only decreased to 0.281 m^ CPU kg

samples in control area is 0.297

'vs.
In essence, the landfill itself can be used as a controlled anaerobic treatment system much analogous to an anaerobic trickling filter (Pohland, 1975a; Tittlebaum, 1982). Leachate recirculation can also supply effective in-situ treatment for landfill leachate. Even where recycled leachates are more concentrated than single-pass leachates, they are treated primarily inside the landfill, utilizing its storage and biodégradation capacity as an effective bioreactor (Reinhart and Al-Yousfi, 1996). The in-situ treatment effect can be illustrated by comparing the leachate data of the Trail Road Landfill (Warith, 2002) with the leachate data of the Tre Monti site (Frascari et al., 2004). The Trail Road landfill Phase 3 in Ottawa, Canada started operation in 1991. The generated leachate was pumped into infiltration lagoons, which were constructed using on-site stockpiled clay for containment dykes. The infiltration lagoons were relocated periodically to ensure even distribution of the moisture and to accommodate the landfilling o f the solid waste. The ratio of the BOD/COD decreased from about 0.9 to 0.4 over a period of eight years. Tre Monti is a 4.16-million-m^ landfill located on a pliocenic clay declivity on the hills near Imola, in Northern Italy, and was built in 1989-1990. After a significant initial decrease, BOD remained relatively uniform from 1993 to 2001, ranging between 850 and 1700 mg I ',

19

whereas CO D , after a similar initial decrease, showed an overall tendency to increase in the 1 9 9 4 -2 0 0 0 period. The BOD/COD ratio decreased from 0.50 to 0.18 from 1992 to 2001. Klink and Ham (1982) indicated that m oisture content and m ovem ent are separate variables hat affect landfill methane generation rates. They have observed that m oisture m ovem ent

through refuse bed enhanced the rates o f methane production by 25 to 50% , com pared to those rates during conditions of minimal m oisture m ovem ent and at the same overall m oisture content. Chugh et al. (1998) examined different leachate recirculation rates namely, 30%, 10%, 2% o f the initial volum e o f waste in the reactors, and indicated that m oisture m ovement significantly im prove m ethane production rates. Many studies agreed that leachate recirculation with pH control further enhanced landfill stabilization and treatm ent efficiency, and buffering the leachate prior to its recirculation is an im portant operation strategy for the maintenance o f the desired pH values in the system (San înd Onay, 2001). W hen Pohland and Kim (1999) examined the in-situ treatm ent o f leachate ind co-disposal o f organic and inorganic hazardous wastes by using sim ulated landfill with leachate recirculation, they observed an early and rapid onset o f acid form ation with production o f a strong and chem ically aggressive leachate once field capacity was reached ind excess m oisture for leaching becam e available. However, the initial transform ation pattern tended to persist until changes in leachate recirculation intervals occurred, neutralization and sludge seeding prom oted the onset o f active m ethane fermentation. The eason fo r this phenom ena is that leachate recirculation, in som e cases, can cause acid accum ulation. In the acid form ation phase, excess acids and hydrogen can make the therm odynamical favorable reactions (Table 2-1) reverse and shift the equilibrium to the left.

20

Buffering the recirculated leachate can reverse this phenomenon. The effect of variable rates o f leachate recirculation was examined by Al-Yousfi and Pohland (1998), where they employed a numerical model (PITTLEACH) to predict leachate quantity and quality, as well as biogas generation for both single-pass leaching and leachate recirculation. The results indicated that total volatile acids concentrations increased and the plateau section of concentration verses time relationship became more pronounced as the leachate recirculation rates increased. These profiles confirmed the effectiveness of

landfills as in-situ bioreactors capable of treating and mineralizing high-strength leachate. The results indicated that higher leachate recirculation rates will cause higher methane gas generation and that there is a lag time needed for the methanogenic phase to prevail under leachate recycling operation. This confirmed that leachate recirculation can cause acidogenic conditions in landfills, and buffering with leachate recycling is very necessary to neutralize the acidic conditions. Leachate recirculation reduces metal concentrations in leachate. The primary metal removal mechanisms appear to be sulphide and hydroxide precipitation and reaction with humic-like substance. Leachate recycling promotes neutral or above neutral leachate conditions as well as stimulates reducing conditions providing for the reduction of sulphate to sulphide (Gould et al. 1989). Additionally, moderate to high molecular weight humic-like substances are formed from waste organic matter with time. These substances tend to form strong complexes with heavy metals. However, over time, oxygen and water may enter the landfill creating conditions that may mobilize metals and flush remaining inorganic contaminants out of the landfill (Reinhart et a l, 2002).

21

bome researchers have earned out som e studies on th e co-disposal potential o f bioreactor andfills for organic and inorganic hazardous wastes with leachate containm ent and in-situ ecirculation. Reinhart et al. (2002) docum ented that bioreactors w ould tend to optim ize em oval o f hazardous organic contaminants by (1) stripping volatile organics by increased jas production, (2) optim izing conditions for biodégradation, and (3) stimulating immobilization o f contam inants through humification. Sanin and Barlaz (1998) also :onfirm ed these m echanism s. Pohland and kim (1999) reported that the effect o f admixed loadings o f inorganic and organic hazardous wastes on anaerobic degradation can be offset by managing their attenuation through leachate containm ent and regulated recirculation, the norizon o f application o f bioreactor landfills can be extended to co-disposal practices by implementing prospective design, construction and operational protocols consistent with simulated experim ents' findings. T he attenuation capacity o f landfill bioreactors is equally effective for toxic organic com pounds by employing leachate recirculation, and biorem ediation with reductive dehalogenation is a prim e exam ple (Pohland et al. 1993; Pohland, 1995). Pagano et al. (1995) carried out a study to determ ine the reduction

potential o f PC B-contam inated sedim ents in anaerobic bioreactor systems with leachate recirculation. A fter 13 weeks o f operation, the average total chlorine/biphenyl o f the original A roclor was reduced by 11% and 23% , respectively. At landfills whereas leachate recalculation is practiced to enhance decom position o f readily degradable organic constituents, leachate am m onia nitrogen concentrations may accum ulate to higher levels than during conventional single pass leaching, thereby requiring treatm ent prior to ultim ate discharge (Pohland, 1995). Leachate recirculation could create an

22

environment that promotes the rapid development o f desired microbial populations o f denitrifiers, nitrifiers, and methanogens. Onay and Pohland (1998 and 2001) reported nitrogen and sulfate attenuation in simulated landfill bioreactors. The experimental results indicated that both nitrogenous and sulfur compounds can be attenuated through autotrophic denitrification, and leachate nitrate concentrations of 750 mg/1 reduced to less than 1 mg/1 by denitrification to nitrogen gas. Promoting this process in landfill environment can result in

the reduction o f leachate ammonia and sulfate concentrations without any need for external leachate treatment. Furthermore, autotrophic denitrification can utilize sulfur compounds, prevent their accumulation in landfills and decrease their potential for inhibition of methanogenic bacteria by sulfate-reducing bacteria in competition for substrate. Therefore, it is recommended to modify landfill design by involving an aerobic zone associated with the leachate under-drain system, and an anoxic zone associated with a surface leachate distribution system below the final cap. Leachate over recirculation can lead into saturation, ponding, and high level o f acid conditions, particularly during early degradation phases (Reinhart and Townsend, 1998). The principal operational challenge is to manage leachate recirculation in such a manner that the excessive accumulation and retention of more aggressive leachate during the acid formation phase does not inhibit the onset and development of an active methane fermentation phase (Pohland and Kim, 2000). In order to maximize waste stabilization, leachate recirculation frequency must be carefully selected. Leachate application, with pH control, four times per week was reported (San and Onay, 2001 ) to effectively increase waste stabilization in It is extremely crucial, in

terms o f high gas yield and lower organic content in the leachate.

23

full-scale leachate recirculation, that leachate is applied at a slow rate before the onset o f m ethanogenic phase o f waste biodégradation, and can be increased once LFG production reaches a reasonable flow rate (Reinhart and Townsend, 1998; Pohland, 1995).

Inocula Addition
M any researchers suggested adding inocula as a bioreactor m anagem ent alternative. M unicipal sewage sludge, animal manure, septic tank sludge and old M SW have been recom m ended as potential inocula. The addition o f sludge to M SW has been reported to have both positive and negative effects in waste biodégradation. Anaerobically digested sewage sludge can serve as a seed to microorganisms as well as source o f nitrogen, phosphorous, and other nutrients. Early studies by (Pohland, 1975a, b; Leckie et al., 1979; Buivid et al., 1981;

Stegmann, 1983; Craft and Blakey, 1988) indicated that leachate recirculaion with pH control and sludge seeding enhanced biological stabilization o f organic pollutants in the leachate and substantially increased biogas generation rates in span o f few m onths rather than years. M ore recent laboratory study by Gulec et al. (2000) reported that in 10-liter laboratory-scale batch digesters filled with 2-year old M SW and sludge at ratios o f 1:9, 1:6 and 1:4 (anaerobically digested sludge to waste on wet basis), pH o f leachate ranged from 7.0 to 8.5 com pared to sharp drop in pH levels to the acidic range in the control reactors (no sludge addition). may be explained by the buffer capacity o f sludge. Additional field practices o f adding biosolids to waste by Blakey et al. (1997) and Viste (1997) indicated relative increase o f biogas production and im provem ent o f leachate quality. On the other hand, B arlaz et al. (1987) observed carboxylic acid accum ulations and decreases in pH associated with sludge addition to fresh MSW. The results o f this study confirm ed that This

24

sludge addition without buffer addition did not stimulate methane production. Moreover, it was suggested that sewage sludge addition to MSW might have a limiting effect on waste biodégradation if the anaerobic conditions are already established (Christensen and Kjeldsen, 1992). Another alternative source of inocula is composted solid waste. Stegmann and Spendlin (1989) found that the addition of composted MSW to fresh MSW helps to initiate the methane phase relatively early. Furthermore, Suna Erses and Onay (2003) suggested that the utilization of external leachate recycled from old landfills having desired acclimated anaerobic microorganisms, low organic content and higher buffer capacity into a young landfill could be a promising leachate management strategy for faster waste stabilization. In the above study, old landfill leachate containing large number of methanogens served as inocula, and helped the onset of methanogenic conditions.

Particle Size
The use of MSW with a reduced particle size relative to unprocessed MSW provides a more homogenous waste. The well mixed shredded waste permits greater contact between the key refuse constituents required for methane production; moisture, substrate, and microorganisms (Barlaz et al., 1990). Waste shredding could lead to rapid oxygen utilization, increase rate of waste decomposition, and lead to early methane production (Ham and Booker, 1982; Otieno, 1989). Experimental results indicated that shredded MSW produces leachate with higher peak COD concentrations and slightly lower minimum pH levels than unprocessed MSW. However, too small particle sizes could cause rapid waste hydrolysis, and lead to a build-up of acidic end products, that will have a negative impact on methane production. MSW

25

ihredding to particle size in the range o f 250 to 350 mm particle sizes produced 32% m ore nethane after 90 days than M SW with 100 to 150 mm particle sizes, and 100-150 mm îhredded M SW produced 16 times as much m ethane as a finely shredded M SW o f less than

15 mm particle size (Buivid et al., 1981). Temperature Control
\ s discussed above, the optim um higher tem peratures will result in faster rates o f gas production and refuse stabilization. The tem perature attained by a landfill is determ ined by he balance between the rates o f heat production and the rate of heat loss to the surrounding !oil and atm osphere. The introduction of air and the consequential onset o f aerobic activity zontribute to rapidly increase tem perature and have been found to stimulate methane production (Reinhart and Townsend, 1998; Rees, 1980). The phenomena was verified by rill-scale tests (M ehta et al., 2002): tem peratures in bioreactor cell with leachate recycle and zell w ithout leachate recycle reached 50-55 °C in the top layer just after refuse burial. \c c o rd in g to M ehta et al. (2002) observations, leachate recirculation accelerated the inaerobic reactions in landfills, and increased the tem peratures inside the bioreactor landfill, it was reported that tem peratures in the control cell without leachate recirculation stabilized it 25-32 °C, and tem peratures in the enhanced cell with leachate recirculation increased with he initiation o f leachate recirculation and ultimately stabilized at 35 °C in the bottom layer ind 40 °C in the m iddle and top layers. According to a fu ll-scale investigation, R ees (1980) suggested that the m ethod to maintaining em peratures o f about 45 °C in an anaerobic landfill in a tem perate clim ate is to allow w ater into the site from the bottom and maintain an insulating layer o f about 4 m above the

26

groundwater table in the landfill. Another potential method of temperature control is the heating of recirculated leachate such as used in Sweden's experimental "Energy L o a f', however the potential of this leachate heating needs further examination.

Lift Design
MSW is usually disposed of in 2 to 3 m lifts with or without daily cover. The depth o f lifts, whether or not compacted, and with or without daily cover are important factors affecting the waste degradation. Early studies indicated that leachate COD concentration was a function of waste depth (Ham and Bookter, 1982), whereas COD of deeper cells (2.4 m) exhibited more than double the typical COD of the comparable shallow ones (1.2 m). Stegmann (1983) suggested that the first layer should be uncompacted, so readily degradable organics can decompose aerobically and are allowed to stabilize before addition of subsequent lifts. Reinhart et al. (2002) indicated that the increased MSW compaction not only reduces the waste ability to move moisture through the waste but also makes the waste achieve level of saturation with less moisture addition because both waste hydraulic conductivity and field capacity are inversely related to waste density. Moreover, compaction contributes to anisotropic conditions within the landfill that magnify lateral movement of moisture. Several bioreactors in Iowa, Wisconsin, and the UK have operated with little or no compaction (Viste, 1997; Blakey et al., 1997). Field results confirmed that partially decomposed MSW has the ability to attenuate leachate (Ham and Bookter, 1982; Stegmann and Ehrig, 1982). The COD and BOD concentrations were reduced to 75% after leachate seeping through deeper lifts of MSW. Applying o f daily or intermediate cover of low permeability can lead to horizontal movement

ind th e potential for leachate ponding o r side seeps (Reinhart and Townsend, 1998). For ixam ple, N atale and A nderson (1985) reported saturated conditions and ponding at the -ycom ing C ounty site during periods when high volum es o f leachate w ere recirculated in ireas using clay and silty soils fo r daily cover. Therefore, many researchers suggested lift lesign w ithout daily cover, or a cover should not be used immediately. However, in the actual )ioreactor landfill operations, daily cover is used to im prove the access to the landfill; reduce he am ount o f waste that can blow away; reduce the risk o f disease; reduce odors; reduce the )otential o f landfill fire. n o rd er to minimize ponding and horizontal movement, Reinhart and Townsend (1998) suggested use o f high permeability soils and/or alternative daily cover should be considered. Alternative daily cover materials include mulched or com posted yard waste, foam, carpet, day/cellulose additives, and geotextiles. The use o f these alternative materials may result in andfill space and cost saving, increase o f waste hydraulic conductivity within the landfill and extended life o f the leachate drainage layers efficiency (Wiles and Hare, 1997). F or exam ple, he use o f alternative daily cover in the form o f green waste o r tarps was successfully during he w aste-filling phase o f the Yolo County Central Landfill project (Yazdani et al., 2002).

Nutrients Addition
Nutrients required for w aste degradation in landfills are generally met at least during early legradation phases. Som etim es, phosphorous may be limiting during later stages. Some studies found that the addition o f nitrogen and phosphorous stim ulated m ethane production or apidly decreased B O D and COD concentrations in the leachate (Pohland, 1992; Warith, >002). M oreover, som e researchers (Stegm ann, 1983; Leushner, 1989) observed that the

28

addition o f nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous, and buffer to the recycled leachate significantly shortened the initial phase of biodégradation, and methane generation commenced earlier. However, other studies found nutrient control had no significant effect on stabilization of the waste (Tittlebaum, 1982; Mata-Alvarez and Martinez-Verdure, 1986). Therefore, it is concluded that nutrient addition does not have sufficient advantages as other enhancement technologies. 2,2 The Aerobic Degradation of MSW in Bioreactor Landfills Recently, increased interest has been focused on the introduction of oxygen to the landfill to create an aerobic bioreactor (Reinhart et al., 2002). In an aerobic environment, the indigenous, respiring microorganisms convert the biodegradable organic compounds in MSW to mostly carbon dioxide and water, instead of methane, with stabilized humus remaining. The aerobic degradation of MSW is mostly covered in the composting literature. Rich (1963) suggested the following stoichiometric equation for aerobic composting: [2] CaHbOcNd + 0.5(ny + 2s + r --c)02 = nCwHxOyN^ + sCO? + rHzO + (d --nz)NH] r = 0.5[b-nx-3(d-nz)]; s = a-nw

Where:

The terms CaHbOcNd and CwHxOyNz represent the compositions of feed substrate and final product, respectively. Aerobic biodégradation processes have demonstrated that many of the organic compounds found in MSW can be degraded in significantly short time frames (as compared with anaerobic conditions) by the introduction of air and moisture in the proper proportions (Stessel and Murphy, 1992; Hudgins and Harper, 1999; Read et al., 2001). This leads to the idea o f in-situ aerobic biodégradation o f MSW in a landfill environment. The benefits of air

29

injection are described as following:

Accelerating M S W Biodégradation
Aerobic biodégradation occurs at a m uch faster rate and to a greater extent than anaerobic conditions in a given time period (Stessel and Murphy, 1992). This conclusion was also testified by H anashim a (1999). Figure 2-1 shows the change in landfill types and its leachate BOD concentration with time.

Reducing Leachate Volume
When the injected air passes the w aste matrices, it is heated by the aerobically degraded Tiaterials, and it picks up m oisture as well as dries the remaining materials. Therefore, the Liolume o f leachate is reduced. This opinion is confirmed by tw o independent aerobic landfill iem onstration projects in C olum bia County landfill in A ugusta, Georgia and Live Oak Landfill in N orth-C entral Georgia. T he leachate volum e reduction rate in these tw o landfills s 86% and 50% separately (H udgins and Harper, 1999).

Increasing Waste Settlem ent
Through lysim eter study, Stessel and M urphy (1992) concluded that aerobic degradation

30

provided greatly enhanced degradation compared to the traditional anaerobic operation, the volatile carbon that was amenable to degradation degraded more quickly, and the waste matrix structurally weakened and promoting settlement. Many other investigators also confirmed this conclusion.

Inhibiting Methanogenesis
The inhibition o f methanogenesis is based on the different degradation mechanism as discussed above. Although the reduction of methane generation sacrifices the landfill operation revenue, it is beneficial for global climate and environment.

Removing Offensive Anaerobic Odors and Ammonia
The aerobic degradation can reduce offensive smelling dramatically. Stessel and Murphy (1992) reported that the aeobic lysimeters smelled clean and earthy, like compost, while the anaerobic were somewhat rank. Anaerobic odors include a wide range of compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, volatile fatty acids, ammonia, aromatic compounds and amines. Ammonia is the most common odor that can be formed aerobically as well as anaerobically. In an aerobic environment, bacteria can oxidize the ammonia nitrogen to nitrites and nitrates.

3. M A TER IA LS AND M ETH O D S 3.1 Overview This study was designed to exam ine the degradation potential o f high organic and m oisture content M SW in bioreactor landfills. Two types o f synthetic M SW were utilized in the study: one consisted o f synthetic M SW mixing with biosolids at the ratio o f 4:1 (wet weight); the other one only consisted o f synthetic MSW. Six bioreactors were constructed to simulate bioreactor landfills accepting either M SW with biosolids or M SW w ithout biosolids. Each bioreactor has a volum e capacity o f 220L and contains approxim ately 150L synthetic MSW (around 70kg in weight). The M SW com positions were broken down by shredding or zutting, weighed on the scale, and then mixed up thoroughly to get uniform ity before being put into the bioreactors. The bioreactors were loaded up with the synthetic M SW that then tvere com pacted to the densities reflecting typical landfill conditions. Tap water was added nto the bioreactor landfills, and the produced leachate was pum ped back until the synthetic MSW m atrices reached field capacity with respect to their m oisture contents. The six sim ulated bioreactor landfills have operated for 102 days in the laboratory. Five o f hem operated in aerobic and anaerobic stages sequentially, each being supplied 0.25 L S ' o f lir continuously during the 18-day aerobic stage. The sixth one operated in constant inaerobic stage. Leachate recirculation and buffering technologies were applied to four o f the >ioreactors. The daily leachate recirculation rate for each bioreactor in anaerobic stage was 12 % o f the matrix volume. Sodium hydroxide solution was used as buffering solution, and he am ount added was based on the pH o f the generated leachate from respective bioreactor, n order to keep the optim um pH range o f 6.4 to 7.2 for anaerobic degradation. In com parison

32

to four closed-loop leachate-recycling bioreactors, there were two single pass bioreactors that equipped with aerobic and anaerobic lagoons to treat leachate (refer to Figure 3-5). Based on their respective operational protocol, matrix components, and replicate number o f the bioreactors, the six bioreactors were named as AMP, A M R ], AMR2, ASF, ASR, NMR (A: air; N: no air; M: MSW; S: biosolids; F: flushing; R: recirculation). The detailed information was summarized in Table 3-1.

The analyses performed in this study included physical analyses of waste matrices (percent composition, moisture content, volume, density, settlement, and internal temperature) and parameters of leachate (pH, TS, BOD5, COD, NH3-N, C l'', and metals). Through these analyses, the performance benefits o f air injection were ascertained and characterized. In addition, the performances o f bioreactors loaded with different synthetic MSW (MSW with biosolids Vs. MSW without biosolids) and bioreactors with different operational protocols (leachate recirculation mode Vs. flushing mode) were examined and compared.

\.2 D esign an d C onstruction o f the B ioreactor System s
i.2.1 Stru ctu ral C om ponents and C onfiguration o f the B ioreactor System s The structural com ponents and configuration the bioreactor systems w ere shown in Figure 5-1. F ollow ing is the detailed description o f the design and construction o f the systems.

3ioreactors
fix sem i-transparent polyethylene cylindrical containers were used as the bioreactors. Each )f them has diam eter o f 0.55 m, height o f 0.92m , and total capacity o f 220 L. A lid with the luitable size w as used to cover each reactor. A fter the apparatuses inside each bioreactor were nstalled, the w astes w ere put inside, and the com m issioning was finished, the seam between he body o f the bioreactor and the lid has been sealed by silicone sealant in order to keep air ight and w ater tight. There is a %" port on the bottom and lid o f each bioreactor respectively. Two fittings are installed in the ports. The bottom one is for discharging leachate, and the lid jne is the pathw ay fo r the exhaust gas. A stainless steel sink screen is put onto each bottom 'itting in o rd er to prevent clogging or M SW loss. There is a 5cm thick layer o f gravel lining he bottom o f each bioreactor. The M SW was put on the gravel liner directly.

Laechate Collection Tanks
3ach bioreactor was connected to one leachate collection tank with a %" x 1 '4" PVC adaptor md suitable vinyl tubing. The capacity o f each tank is 20 L. The function o f the tank is to collect the leachate discharged from the bioreactor to prevent flooding inside the bioreactor. The generated acidic leachate during the anaerobic can be discharged very quickly, and never accumulated inside the MSW. There is a V2 " PVC adjustable ball valve on the sidewall o f îach tank fo r sam pling and discharging leachate to the leachate recirculation reservoir.

34

Leachate Recirculation Reservoirs and Pumps
Six transparent polyethylene tanks were used as leachate recirculation reservoirs. Each of them has a capacity of 25 L and graduations. The reservoir served as the "leachate transfer station" where the pH and volume o f the recirculated leachate can be measured, and the acidic leachate can be buffered. The submersible pumps (Laguna Statuary Pump 3#) were used for pumping the leachate and makeup water back into the bioreactors.

Leachate Distribution Apparatus
The function of the leachate distribution apparatus is to distribute the recirculated leachate evenly on the top of the MSW matix, just like raining. The apparatus included a circle with a cross inside, and it is made by connecting a %" PVC cross, three %" PVC tees, and %" vinyl tubing. Sixteen holes with 3mm diameter were punched on the vinyl tubing. The apparatus was connected to the leachate recirculation pipe outside the bioreactor. A %" PVC adaptor was used for the pipe to pass the bioreactor wall. An adjustable PVC ball valve was installed on the recirculation pipe. When the recirculation was finished every time, the valve was closed to keep air tight of the bioreactor.

Air Distribution Pipes
Three PVC pipes were installed in each bioreactor to distribute the injected air evenly into the waste matrices. One third of each pipe near the bottom of the bioreactor was perforated. The air pipes were covered by plastic insect screen to prevent MSW getting inside the pipes and clog the pipes. The three pipes were connected together by PVC elbows and tubing, and become one "entity" which also served as a support for the water distribution apparatus. The injected air reached the "entity" through one air pipe that passed the bioreactor wall by one

35

^VC adaptor. A n adjustable PVC ball valve was installed on the air pipe to adjust the airflow ate and shut dow n the air during the anaerobic stage.

iir Compressor
Dne air com pressor (HUSKY, 2.75HP, 8 Gallons, 4.0 SCFM @ 40psi) was used to supply air
0

the six bioreactors. There was a standby air com pressor (DeVILBISS ® Tradesm an M odel

DAC-7118, DeVILBISS, Canada).

Temperature Sensor and Thermom eter
\ tem perature sensor was put in the middle o f the M SW m atrix in each bioreactor. W ires ;onnected the sensor with the therm om eter outside the bioreactor. The therm om eter EX TEC H 421307 therm om eter) can read out the internal tem perature o f the M SW matrix.

Exhaust Gas Discharge System
The exhaust Gas pipe on the lid o f each bioreactor was connected together by tubing and tees, ind the exhaust gases were discharged outdoors through one %" vinyl tubing. 1.2.2 L each ate R ecirculation M ode The leachate recirculation system includes leachate collection tank, valves, leachate ecirculation reservoir, subm ersible pum p, tubing, leachate distribution apparatus. It operated n a closed-loop mode. The pathway o f the leachate is presented in Figure 3-2. The leachate movement direction is shown by arrow s in the figure. L2.3 A ir Injection and E xhaust M ode The air injection and exhaust system includes air com pressor, air supply pipe, gas flow meter, /alve, air distribution pipes, gas exhaust port, and gas exhaust pipe. The m ovem ent direction >f the injected air is presented in Figure 3-3 as the arrows show. The connection o f the air

36

compressor and the five bioreactors is shown in Figure3-4. 3.2.4 The Operation Mode of Single Pass Bioreactors In the single pass bioreactors, tap water was added into the waste matrix. The generated leachate was transported to the downstream treatment units: aerobic lagoon and anaerobic lagoon. The operation mode was displayed in Figure 3-5. 3.2.5 Bioreactor System Maintenance The joints and seams were checked often during the study to make sure they were airtight and watertight. Spare parts, leachate tanks and reservoir, and stand-by air compressor and pump were in stock.

3.3 Preparation of Synthetic MSW and Loading o f Bioreactors According to the objective of the study as discussed in section 1.4, the synthetic MSW with high organic and moisture were prepared and loaded into the six bioreactors. There are two types of synthetic MSW made in this study: one with biosolids; the other one without biosolids. The bioreactors --AMF, A M R l, AMR2, and NMR - were loaded with synthetic MSW without biosolids. The bioreactors - ASF and ASR --were loaded with synthetic MSW with biosolids. 3.3.1 MSW Compositions The synthetic MSW used in this study includes waste foods, waste vegetables, plastics, waste paper, textiles, and biosolids. The percentages of compositions were decided according to the purpose of this study. San and Onay (2001 ) used synthetic MSW according to the typical MSW Compositions in the city of Istanbul (Table 3-2). Hao (2004) used synthetic MSW according to the typical MSW Compositions in the city of Beijing (Table 3-3). The MSW compositions after recycling are presented in Table 3-4 (Source data refer to Appendix B). The biodegradable compositions were respectively 95%, 85% and
68%

o f the total MSW

weight, belonging to high organic content MSW. Based on these data, the Synthetic MSW compositions and each component percentage in this study were designed (refer to Table 3-5). 3.3.2 Preparation of MSW Waste foods and vegetables were taken from the nearby restaurants' kitchens. When the kitchen wastes were brought in, they were sorted, and only the waste foods and vegetables were used as the main organic components for the simulated bioreactor landfills. Waste foods

43

nd vegetables were weighed separately. he paper, including newsprint, com puter printout, office paper, books, and packaging paper, am e from the offices at Ryerson University. All the paper was shredded.

iew garbage bags w ere used as plastic com ponent in the synthetic MSW. In the field
lioreactor landfills, the plastic bags channeled or blocked the recirculated leachate, as well as ncapsulated materials that would readily be biodegraded in the presence o f air. Therefore, all ne garbage bags in this study were cut to the size o f 100-150 mm. )ld clothes w ere used as textile com ponent in the study. Also, they were cut to the size o f 00-150 mm. liosolids were taken from Toronto A shbridges Bay Treatment P la n t. The biosolids w ere the lixture o f prim ary sludge and secondary activated sludge that have undergone anaerobic igestion process.

3.3,3 Loading of the Sim ulated B ioreactor Landfills After all the MSW components were broken down to the suitable size, they were thoroughly mixed up and sampled for measuring the initial moisture content of the synthetic MSW. The synthetic MSW was loaded into each bioreactor and compacted. And then, about 39 L tap water was added into each bioreactor. In the first three days, the leachate was recirculated daily and the volume o f the leachate was measured until the MSW in each bioreactor was brought to field capacity.

45

he m oisture content is an essential factor that dramatically affects the waste degradation. On k/eight basis, m oisture content is described as the weight o f the w ater divided either by dry or i'et w aste weight. On a volumetric basis, m oisture content is expressed as the volum e o f i/ater divided by the volume o f wet waste. Generally, the field capacity is used to haracterize the m oisture content o f the M SW matrix. The field capacity is the concept to [ualify the internal storage o f a landfill, or the m oisture content at which the maximum m ount o f w ater is held (through capillary forces) against gravity. The addition o f m ore lo istu re will result in continuous leachate drainage (Reinhart and Townsend, 1998). When lie am ount o f water in the leachate collection tank was approxim ately equal to the am ount o f -achate recirculated the previous day, the M SW inside the bioreactors was considered to each the field capacity. he range o f the field capacity is wide as expected since it is a function o f the waste om position, density and porosity, particle sizes, w aste overburden, waste age (Yuen et al., 001 ; Reinhart and Townsend, 1998). 'he characters o f the loaded synthetic M SW in each bioreactor are summarized in the Table

1 0 2 -day

study, all the six hioreactors operated according to the proposed protocol

46

based on the purpose of this study. All parameters o f the operation were selected from the previous investigators' studies in the literature. Waste samples were collected before and after the operation o f the bioreactors. Leachate samples were collected following a timeline. 3.4.1 R ate o f Airflow As described above, five bioreactors-- AMF, A M R l, AMR2, ASF, and ASR-- operated in two stages. In the 18-day aerobic stage, air was injected into the MSW matrices continuously to keep an aerobic condition for accelerating the organic waste decomposition. Stessel and Murphy (1992) indicated that there would be no maximum level of airflow; rather, one sought the lowest level at which accelerated degradation was obtained so as to minimize operating costs. Haug (1993) provided the general formula - C64H 104O 37N - for the total organic fraction of MSW. Based on the formula, assume the organics are totally degraded, then Eq. [2] can be expressed as; [3] C64H104O37N + 70.75 O2 (1478) (2264)  64 CO2 + 50.5 H2O + NH3

The stoichiometric oxygen demand can be determined as 1.53 g O 2 g ' waste (dry). Taking 2 as a safety factor, and converting to air volume 11.1 m^ air kg ' MSW (dry) (25 "C and at 1 Atm pressure) should be supplied. Assume all the organic portion was oxidized in the 18-day aerobic stage, 0.617 m^ air d ' kg ' MSW (dry) needs to be supplied. Anderson (1990) also presented that a suitable aeration rate is considered by many operators to be between
1 .8 0 .6

to

m^ air d * kg ' volatile solids during the thermophilic stage with progressive decrease

during the cooling down and maturation stages for composting.

47

hus, based on the dry weight o f the wastes in each bioreactor (refer to Table 3-4), about 0.25 S o f air should be supplied to each bioreactor continuously. Five bioreactors operated at

le sam e time, thus, 1.25 L S ' o f air should be supplied by the air com pressor. .4.2 L eachate R ecirculation Rate /ater is essential for both aerobic decom position and anaerobic decom position. A s discussed
1 section

2.1.3, m oisture content and movement are separate variables. The function o f

;achate recirculation is to achieve optim um m oisture content and m ovem ent inside waste latrices. The optim um leachate recirculation rate is different for aerobic and anaerobic egradation. The recirculation rate o f this study was determ ined according to the previous ^searchers' studies.
1

Hudgins and H arp er's study (1999), they kept waste mass m oisture contents above 60% in

VO aerobic landfills. They also indicated that waste tem peratures increased while m oisture îvels decreased, in som e cases to below 40%; as such, leachate flow and air delivery rates hould be adjusted based on the field data to keep the waste mass adequately m oisturized and erated. Stessel and M urphy (1992) concluded that waste moisture levels had to be laintained at 75% for the optim um aerobic degradation. The field capacities in this study are
1

the range o f 60% - 70% . To keep the field capacity in the bioreactors, leachate was '

ecirculated daily. A t the beginning o f the study, the volum e o f leachate recirculated is pproxim ately equal to 15% o f the waste matrix volum e in one bioreactor. The volum e o f "achate generated decreased with time in the aerobic stage because o f evaporation and legradation consum ption. W hen the volume o f leachate decreased to below 5 L approxim ately
4

% o f the waste matrix in one bioreactor), tap w ater was added to keep the

48

minimum volume - 5 L. Many researchers conducted studies on the effects o f diiferent leachate recirculation rates on anaerobic degradation. Chugh et al (1998) utilized three daily recirculation rates - 2%, 10%, 30% of initial volume o f waste matrices. They concluded that the rate and extent of waste decomposition improved with the increase in moisture flow. However, the results of Sponza and Agdag's study (2004) contrasted the previous study. Their recirculation rates are 9 L d ' (13% of the reactor volume) and 21 L d ' (30% of the reactor volume) respectively. After 220 days of anaerobic incubation, they observed that the pH, COD, VFAs concentrations, methane gas productions and methane percentages in 9 L d ' bioreactor were better than in 21 L d'' bioreactor. They indicated that high recirculation volumes might deplete the buffering capacity and remove the activity of methanogens. Warith (2002) used 15% of the total volume of solid waste in each waste cell, and recirculated three times a week. Based on these previous studies, daily recirculation rate was determined as

.5.1 M ethods for the Physical Analyses o f MSW "he physical analyses o f M SW w ere perform ed in this study in o rder to characterize the ature o f the waste samples and get the bulk data of their decom position as a whole. The aram eters m easured in the study consisted o f percent com position, m oisture content, volume, tensity, settlem ent, and internal tem perature.

^ercent Composition by Mass
'he overall concept o f M SW suitability for biodégradation can be obtained from its percent om positions. Synthetic M SW was used in the study. The m easurem ent o f individual M SW om ponent was carried out with reference to ASTM method D 5321-92 (ASTM 2002). Scale ^as used fo r the m easurem ent. Each com position was weighed to the proposed weight fo r

each bioreactor.

Moisture Content and Field Capacity
Moisture contents of matrices inside bioreactors were determined by ASTM Method 2216-98 (ASTM 2001). Approximately lOOOg of specimen from each bioreactor was used for the measurement in order to avoid the interference o f MSW heterogeneity. The initial moisture content was measured right after the MSW components were prepared and mixed up. The initial field capacity can be derived from the initial moisture content of MSW and the amount of tap water added into the MSW matrices for saturating the M SW The moisture content was measured again at the end of the study to get the final field capacity for comparison.

Settlement o f the M SW Over Time
After the MSW is disposed of in landfills, the thickness of waste layers will decrease with time. The Waste settlement analysis is very important because it can influence; (1) making projections of the remaining site life or remaining time before operations need to move to a new lined area; (2) the design of landfills' components, such as cover and liner systems; (3) post-closure development of landfills. The rate of landfill settlement depends primarily on the waste composition, operational practices and factors affecting biodégradation o f the landfill waste, particularly moisture content (El-Fadel, 1998). In this study, semi-transparent polyethylene containers were used as bioreactors, thus, the thickness of waste layers were easily measured outside the bioreactors. The settlement rates were expressed as the percent data of the decreased thickness divided by the initial waste thickness. The volume and wet density o f the waste were also easily derived from the measurement of

51

he w aste m atrix thickness and mass as above.

'nternal Temperature
viercury therm om eters w ere used to record the am bient air temperature. T em perature sensors ind an E X T E C H 421307 therm om eter were used for monitoring the internal tem perature to ;nsure that the M SW did not heat up to a dangerous level. 5.5.2 M e th o d s fo r th e C hem ical A nalysis o f L ea ch ate L eachate sam ples o f 150 ml from each bioreactor were collected throughout the study: three imes per w eek in the first 32 days; two times per week from day 32 to day 53; once a week fom day 53 to the last day.

)H m eter was used to m easure the pH values o f leachate in the study. Because leachate pH values changed along the time, it is very important to carry out the m easurem ent right after am pling. Com m ercial standard solutions (including pH 4.0, 7.0, and 11.0) w ere used for lalibrating the pH meter.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS In this study, there are three comparison groups: (1) AMR Vs. NMR; (2) AMR Vs. ASR; and (3) AMR Vs. AMF and ASR Vs. ASF (the bioreactors have been identified in Table 3-1). The following results and discussions are divided into three parts, and each is related to one specific group. The physical variations of waste matrices and chemical variations of leachate in the bioreactors are presented in this section. Through the analyses and the comparison of the experimental data, the effects of air addition and biosolids addition on the biodégradation of MSW with high organic and moisture contents in bioreactor landfills are discussed. Moreover, the flushing technology is compared with the leachate recirculation technology. In the following sections, AMR represents the average values of the data from replicate bioreactors AMRl and AMR2, and the complete data are presented in Appendix B. 4.1 Experimental Results and Discussions - AMR Vs. NMR In order to exam the benefits of initially biodegrading MSW with high organic and moisture contents under aerobic condition before anaerobic degradation comparing with constant anaerobic degradation, the performance of bioreactor AMR is compared with that of bioreactor NMR in this section. Both bioreactors were loaded with synthetic MSW, operating with leachate recirculation and leachate buffering technologies. The only difference between them was that AMR operated in two sequential stages (aerobic stage and anaerobic stage) and NMR operated under constant anaerobic condition (refer to Tables 3-7). 4.1.1 Physical Variations - AMR Vs. NMR

Visible Changes in MSW Composition and Odors after Bioreactor Treatment
Most food and vegetable wastes were decomposed after approximately 100 days in bioreactor

55

> l M R. There w ere m ore food and vegetable residuals in NM R than in A M R. There was no )bvious degradation o f the newsprints in N M R while the obvious volum e reduction and )iodegradation o f the newsprints were noted in AM R. Textiles experienced no changes in )Oth bioreactors. A t the end o f the study, the vinegar and alcohol odors w ere very strong in )Oth bioreactors.

"hanges in Mass, Settlement, Density, and Field Capacity
Due to the biodégradation o f the MSW, both AMR and NM R experienced waste weight eduction after about 100 days bioreactor treatment. In bioreactor A M R, the wet waste weight educed from 86.2 kg to 73.8 kg and the reduction rate was 14.4%. In bioreactor N M R, the vet w aste weight reduced from 89.9 kg to 87.1 kg and the reduction rate was 3.1 %. The wet veight reduction rate in AM R was about five times o f that in NMR. \ s shown in E qs [2] and [3], organic materials can beconverted to water, carbon dioxide and immonia in the aerobic environment. The produced w ater can be vaporized due the heat generated in the aerobic reactions. As discussed in section 2.1.1, in anaerobic condition, the irganic w astes, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, protein, and fats, can be converted to ;ases, such as methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and hydrogen, and VFAs. The generation )f gases and volatile products can cause the loss o f the waste weight in the bioreactors. In ither w ords, the w aste weight reduction rate reflected the biodégradation rate in the >ioreactors. A M R achieved about 5 times wet weight reduction rate o f N M R. This indicated he biodégradation rate in the aerobic-anaerobic bioreactor AM R was faster than that in the :onstant anaerobic bioreactor NM R. The settlem ent rates in A M R and N M R with time are illustrated in Figure 4-1 and the

56

complete data are presented in Appendix B. The overall settlement rates for AMR and NMR were 22% and 25%, respectively. Although the weight reduction rate in NMR was only one fifth o f that in AMR, the settlement rate was higher in NMR than in AMR. The reason may be the lower initial waste density in NMR (refer to Table 4-1). Although both the waste volume and waste weight decreased with time, densities in both bioreactors experienced increases due to a greater reduction in waste volume proportional to the waste weight (refer to Table 4-1 ). There was little change in field capacity in both bioreactors.

Variations in pH
The leachate pH variation trends in bioreactors AMR and NMR are displayed in Figure 4-2.

57

rhe buffer am ount and buffering tim eline are presented in Table 4-2. In about 100 days study jeriod, both bioreactors utilized about the same am ount o f buffer. The leachate pH values ncreased from initially 4.40 to finally 7.0 in AM R while increased from initially 4.1 to inally 5.8 in N M R. As illustrated in Figure 4-2, the pH values in AM R were higher than in 4M R at every sampling point in the study period. In the initial 18 days bioreactor operation aerobic stage in A M R), N M R utilized more than 10 times amount o f buffer than AM R. Although the leachate pH values increased rapidly in both bioreactors and reached 5.5 and ).3 fo r N M R and A M R , respectively, the final pH value in AMR was higher than in NM R. The neutralizing effect o f air was obvious. From day 19, AM R was switched to anaerobic tage. F rom day 19 to day 28, there were no air addition and buffering in AMR. The pH alues start to drop from 6.3 to 5.7 in AMR. n order to keep the methanogenesis favorite pH range o f 6.4 - 7.2 in the anaerobic stage in IM R , buffering technology was applied. When the leachate pH value dropped below 6.4, luffer solution was added to keep the leachate pH values between 6.4 and 7.2. A fter day
88,

here w ere no pH values below 6.4, so the buffering addition was term inated. N M R followed IM R in the added buffer am ount and buffering termination time from day 19 to the end o f he study. However, after buffering was terminated on day lecreased from 6.2 to 5.8. "he anaerobically biodégradation o f organics generated a large quantity o f VFAs (refer to ection 2.1.1). The accum ulation o f VFAs can cause low pH values in bioreactors, as well as everse the anaerobic reactions in Table 2-1. As observed in the study, in AM R, after the erobic stage was term inated and there was no buffering from day 19 to day 28, the pH
88

in NM R, its pH values slightly

58

values dropped to the acidic side, as well as in NMR, after the bufiering was stopped on day
88,

the pH values decreased quickly. The added buffer neutralized the produced VFAs and

accelerated the reactions to occur in the direction as shown in Table 2-1. As a result, the anaerobic degradation was accelerated. Therefore, the buffering addition is an effective strategy in the operation of the anaerobic bioreactors. The observations in this study also indicated that air has neutralizing effects on pH. The air brought the leachate pH value in AMR to a higher level than in NMR in the initial 18-day period although AMR only used less than one tenth buffer amount in this period. As Equations [2] and [3] presented, the aerobic biodégradation avoided the generation of VFAs comparing with the anaerobic degradation, thus, avoid the drop of pH. After day
88,

no more buffer was needed for AMR. The VFAs generation and consumption

have achieved a balance. The ecosystem inside the AMR waste matrix maybe entered methanogenesis predominance phase --Phase IV (refer to section 2.1.1). In contrast, after the buffering was stopped in NMR, the pH values dropped in the following study period. This result indicated that the production of VFAs exceeded the consumption of VFAs in NMR, and the anaerobic biodégradation progress in NMR lagged behind that in AMR. The observations led to the conclusion that initially degrading high organic and moisture content MSW in aerobic stage created an optimum pH environment for the following anaerobic stage and saved the buffer amount, at the same time, accelerated the decomposition of the waste.

Variations in COD
-igure 4-3 displays the COD variation trends in bioreactors A M R and NM R and Table 4-3 (Ummarizes the representative COD concentrations. The initial CO D concentrations in both jioreactors w ere approxim ately same (37,600 and 33,100 mg/1 fo r AM R and N M R, espectively). The peak COD in NM R (62,300 mg/1) was higher than the peak CO D in AM R 45 ,100 mg/1) by 38.1 % o f the AM R peak COD. At the end o f the study, the final CO D in 'JMR (44,20 0 mg/1) was higher than the final COD in AMR (31,700 mg/1) by 39.1 % o f the \M R final COD. Furtherm ore, the final COD in NMR was approxim ately the sam e as the leak CO D in AM R. n the first 18 days o f the study, AM R operated in the aerobic stage. The COD concentration lecreased sharply in A M R and reached the bottom concentration - 15,800 mg/1 on day 18. At he sam e time, NM R operated in anaerobic condition. The leachate COD in NM R remained ligh concentration (59,500 mg/1) on day 18, when the aerobic stage terminated in AM R. The CO D concentration reflected the leachate quality in the bioreactors. The above observations indicated that the leachate quality in AMR was much better than that in N M R ifter ab o u t 100 days bioreactor treatment. The other operation protocols were sam e for both oioreactors except A M R utilized air addition in the initial 18 days operation. Therefore, it was oncluded that initially degrading M SW with high organic and m oisture contents under erobic condition im proved the final leachate quality comparing with the constant anaerobic legrading in the study.

Variations in BOD 5
Although there were larger fluctuations than COD curves, the BOD 5 variations followed the similar trends in AMR and NMR (refer to Figure 4-4). The representative BOD 5 concentrations were presented in Table 4-4. The initial BOD 5 concentrations in both bioreactors were approximately equal (18,800 and 19,400 mg/1 for AMR and NMR, respectively). The peak BOD 5 in AMR and NMR were 23,500 and 30,800 mg/1, respectively, and the peak BOD 5 in NMR was higher than the peak BOD 5 in AMR by 31% of the peak BOD 5 in AMR. At the end of the study, the BOD 5 in NMR was almost double the BOD 5 in AMR, and were 21,200 and 10,700 mg/1, respectively. The overall reduction rates from the peak BOD 5 were 54.5% and 31.3%, respectively. The BOD 5 data further confirmed that the final leachate quality in AMR was much better that that in NMR at the end of the study, and the initially degrading the MSW with high organic and moisture contents before the anaerobic degradation is an effective strategy for bioreactor landfills which accept this kind of MSW.

^anations in NH3-N
'igure 4-5 displays the NH 3-N variation trends in both bioreactors AM R and NM R. Both lioreactors w ere loaded with the same kind o f synthetic M SW and operated in the losed-loop leachate recirculation mode. In both bioreactors, the N H 3-N concentration ncreased progressively - from 24 to 550 mg/l in AMR while from 56 to 1300 mg/l in NM R. :'he initial and final N H 3-N concentrations in NMR were both double those in AM R. )bviously, the N H 3 -N values in NM R were on a much higher level than in AMR. This result nay be attribute to the air addition in AMR because N H 3-N can be utilized as a substrate for erobic bacteria, and be converted to nitrite through nitrification. This result may also be ttributed to the inherent heterogeneity of the MSW. The N H 3-N was found at high oncentrations in leachate as a result o f decom position of the organic materials containing litrogen such as protein and amino acids. Although the overall weight of the waste foods and egetables inside each bioreactor was approximately same, the percentage of the nitrogenous irganic m aterials may be different.

Variations in TS
Ig u re 4-6 shows the leachate TS variation trends in bioreactors A M R and NMR. The ariation trends w ere roughly the same as the COD and BOD 5 variation trends. The initial ZOD in A M R was approxim ately equal to the initial COD in NM R, as well as the initial lODs in A M R was approxim ately equal to the initial BOD; in NM R. However, the initial TS oncentration in N M R was even double that in AMR (17,250 and 32,500 mg/l for A M R and «JMR, respectively). This indicated that the leachate in NMR might contain m ore

4.1.3 Summary o f Experimental Results and Discussions - AMR Vs. NMR Based on the comparison of the performances o f AMR and NMR, the initially degrading MSW under aerobic condition before the anaerobic degradation had positive effects on the decomposition of MSW with high organic and moisture contents. Buffering can neutralize the generated VFAs in the anaerobic biodégradation, thus, be effective for aceelerating the anaerobic biodégradation progress. The two bioreactors approximately utilized the same amount of buffer in the study. But, after about 100 days operation, the leachate pH values in AMR have been in the methanogenesis favorite range of 6.4 - 7.2 without buffering while the pH values still decreased after the buffering was stopped in NMR. This indicated that NMR already lagged behind AMR in the anaerobic degradation progress. In AMR, the initial aerobic degradation avoided the generation of large quantities of VFAs, thus, was beneficial for building up the optimum pH environment for the following anaerobic degradation and also saved buffer. After about 100 days bioreactor treatment, the mass reduction rate in NMR was only one fifth of that in AMR. The initial COD concentration in AMR was approximately equal to that in NMR, as well as the initial BOD 5 concentration in AMR was approximately equal to that in NMR. However, the final BOD concentration in NMR was even double that in AMR (21,200 and 10,700 mg/l for NMR and AMR, respectively), while the final COD concentration in NMR was higher than that in AMR by 39.1% of the final COD in AMR (44,100 and 31,700 mg/l for NMR and AMR, respectively). The final TS concentrations were 32,900 and 27,650 mg/l for NMR and AMR, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that the air addition accelerated the biodégradation of the organics as well as improved the final leachate quality.

he N H 3-N concentrations increased progressively with tim e in both bioreactors. The ecrease o f NH 3-N was not observed in both bioreactors due to the time constraint o f the tudy. T he final NH 3-N concentrations were 550 and 1,300 mg/l for A M R and NM R, espectively. The low er NH3-N in A M R may be attributed to the air addition, o r may be ttributed to the inherent heterogeneity of the MSW. he concentration o f zinc decreased with time in both bioreactors.

the anaerobic odors were very strong at the end o f the study, however, the vinegar and alcohol odors were stronger in AMR, and the ammonia odor was stronger in ASR.

Changes in Mass, Settlement, Density, and Field Capacity
After about 100 days' operation, the wet waste weight in AMR reduced from 86.2 kg to 73.8 kg, as well as reduced from 80.9 kg to 64.4 kg in ASR due to aerobic and anaerobic degradation. The wet weight reduction rates for AMR and ASR were 14.4% and 20.4%, respectively (refer to Table 4-8). As discussed in section 4.1.1, the decomposition o f MSW generated gases and intermediate volatile products, thus, caused the reduction of the waste weight, which in turn reflected the biodégradation speed in the bioreactors. Therefore, the above observation indicated that the overall biodégradation rate in ASR was faster than that in AMR. The settlement trends are presented in Figure 4-7. The overall settlement rates for AMR and ASR were 22% and 24%, respectively. The settlement in ASR was faster than that in AMR. The settlement rate is governed by the biodégradation rate and other factors such as waste composition, density, and operational practices. The higher overall settlement rate in ASR may result from the greater extent of biodégradation. With the decreases in waste volume and mass, densities in both bioreactors experienced increases due to a greater reduction in waste volume proportional to the waste mass (refer to Table 4-8). There was little change in field capacity in both bioreactors.

ngure 4-8 displays the trends o f pH variations in leachate samples from AMR and ASR. The nitial pH values in A M R and A SR were 4.4 and 4.5, respectively. Continuous increases in )H were observed for both bioreactors during the 18-day aerobic stage, and reached 6.3 and ).7, respectively on day 18, where the aerobic stage terminated. In day 6 , AMR was buffered )nce, no buffering for A SR in aerobic stage. However, the pH level in ASR was higher than n A M R in this stage. Tom day 19, both bioreactors were switched to anaerobic stage. From day 19 to day 28, here w ere no air addition and buffering. M eantime, the pH values started to drop from 6.7 to 5.7 in ASR, and from 6.3 to 5.7 in AM R. This observation coincided with the previous

72

studies. In the anaerobic environment, the organics were hydrolyzed into VFAs, hence, caused the leachate pH to decrease. In contrast, the aerobic degradation broke down organics into carbon dioxide, ammonia and water, avoiding the generation of VFAs. Therefore, the pH increased in the aerobic stage and decreased in the initial anaerobic stage. Previous studies have shown that methanogenesis is favored at a pH between 6.4 and 7.2. In order to achieve optimal pH for refuse methanogenesis, buffering leachate technology was applied from day 28 for both AMR and ASR. Once the leachate pH dropped below 6.4, buffering solution was added during the daily recirculation. Once the pH values of leachate were continuously in the range of 6.4 to 7.2, buffering was stopped. Buffering was stopped 30 days earlier in ASR than in AMR. The buffering stop point indicated that there was a balance between the VFAs generation and consumption, and the methanogenesis may became predominant (refer to section 2.1.1). This observation indicated ASR was earlier than AMR in the anaerobic degradation progress. This may attribute to the biosolids in ASR which can serve as seeds in the anaerobic degradation and accelerated the progress. ASR only used half amount buffer of what AMR used (refer to Table 4-9). The pH level in ASR was higher than in AMR either in the aerobic stage or in the anaerobic stage. The only reason that caused the result is that ASR contained biosolids. This observation indicated that the biosolids had strong buffering effect. The biosolids have undergone anaerobic digestion that may cause the accumulation o f ammonia. The buffering effect of biosolids may be attributed to the high ammonia concentration.

Variations in COD
he trends o f leachate COD variations in A M R and ASR are illustrated in Figure 4-9. The :0 D concentrations in A M R and A SR increased to first peak (45,100 and 3 6 ,5 0 0 mg/l, espectively) from the initial concentrations (37,600 and 30,000 mg/l, respectively) during the irst 3-day period. Follow ing this initial period, sharp COD decreases in both bioreactors /ere noted. The COD concentrations reached the bottom values (15,800 and 20 ,0 0 0 mg/l for tM R and A SR , respectively) on day 18, when the aerobic stage terminated. The COD eduction rates from the first peak were 64.9% and 45.2% for AMR and ASR, respectively in le aerobic stage (refer to Table 4-10). 'he CO D concentrations in both bioreactors started to increase again right after the aerobic tage w as switched to anaerobic stage. During day 30-39, makeup tap water was added into oth bioreactors in order to reach the optimum recirculation rate. This caused the COD oncentrations to fluctuate. The COD in ASR reached the second peak on day 60, while in tM R on day
88

. A fter the second peak, constant COD decreases were noted in both

ioreactors. The overall COD reduction rates from the first peak in the study w ere 29.6% and 1.9% for A M R and ASR, respectively, (refer Table 4-10). 'he COD reduction rate in aerobic stage was higher in AMR than in ASR. This observation idicated that M SW w ithout biosolids were m ore suitable for aerobic biodégradation than /ISW with biosolids. It was noted that biosolids had higher density than MSW, and were very iscous w hen the bioreactors were loaded. The biosolids may encapsulate the organics, and ilock the contact between the air and the organics. Such that, the COD reduction rate in ASR /as much less than that in A M R in the aerobic stage. Another possibility may be that M SW

76

without biosolids contained more biodegradable compositions. In contrast, the overall COD reduction rate was higher in ASR than in AMR. The sharp increase of COD reduction rate in anaerobic stage caused the overall greater reduction rate in ASR. This observation may also result from the biosolids in ASR that served as seeds in the anaerobic stage. The biosolids addition accelerated the anaerobic biodégradation so that the COD reduction rate in anaerobic stage was much greater in ASR than in AMR. This result coincided with the previous studies (Blakey et al., 1997, Viste, 1997, and Gulec et al. 2000).

Variations in BOD 5
Figure 4-10 shows the BOD 5 variation trends in AMR and ASR. Although there were more fluctuations in BOD 5 data, the trends coincided with the COD trends very well. The initial BOD 5 concentrations in AMR and ASR were 18,800 and 14,200 mg/l, respectively. The first peak (23,500 and 18,500 mg/l for AMR and ASR, respectively) appeared around the third day of the study. The BOD 5 concentrations dropped to 10,700 and 7,700 mg/l at the end of the study. There were also two concentration peaks in the period of the study for each bioreactor.

he B O D 5 reduction rates from the first peak were 74.0% and 44.3% for A M R and ASR in le aerobic stage. In opposition to the aerobic stage, the overall B O D 5 reduction rates from le first peak were 54.5% and 58.4% for AM R and ASR, respectively (refer to Table 4-11).

Variations in BO D s/COD Ratio
he BO D 5/C O D ratios decreaed with time in both bioreactors - from 0.50 to 0.34 in AM R nd from 0.47 to 0 .3 6 in ASR (refer to Table 4-12). The changes in B O D 5/C O D ratio idicated the variation in the percentage o f biodegradable com pounds in the leachate. D ue to le degradation o f the organics in MSW, the BOD 5/COD ratio would decrease. A ratio o f .4-0.8 im plies a highly biodegradable leachate (Warith, 2002). The leachate from both ioreactors initially belonged to this kind o f leachate.

Variations in N H 3 -N
he initial concentrations o f NH 3 -N in AMR and ASR were 24 and 340 mg/l, respectively. As lustrated in F ig u re 4-11, the NH 3 -N concentration in AMR increased progressively and cached 550 m g/l at the end o f the study. Although the NH 3-N concentration in ASR followed n increasing trend, there w ere great fluctuations. The final concentration in ASR was 1,020 ig/ 1. he N H 3-N concentration values in ASR and AMR were not in the same order o f magnitude. : was also noted that the NH3-N concentrations in bioreactors with biosolids were much igher than b ioreactors w ithout biosolids (refer to appendix A). This observation indicated tat biosolids, w hich have undergone anaerobic digestion, introduced a large quantity o f m m onia into the leachate. a the aerobic environm ent. N H 3 -N can be utilized as a substrate for aerobic bacteria, and be

80

converted to nitrite through nitrification. Therefore, the aerobic stage is beneficial for the removal o f high concentration ammonia in MSW with biosolids. In the anaerobic stage, the NH 3-N concentrations increased more sharply because the nitrogenous organics were continuously converted into NH 3 , and the leachate recirculation reintroduced NH 3 into the system. Some researchers (Sponza and Agdag, 2004, Ozturk, 1991) observed that the ammonium concentration started to decrease after a period o f anaerobic incubation, since the ammonia was consumed by the anaerobic bacteria to develop their cellular components. This phenomenon was not observed in this study probably due to the time constraints.

Variations in TS
The leachate TS in AMR and ASR followed the same variation trends as COD and BOD 5 (Figure 4-12). Table 4-13 summarized the representative TS concentrations in AMR and ASR. The TS reduction rates from first peak concentrations in aerobic stage were 70.8% and 61.8% for AMR and ASR, respectively. In comparison, the overall reduction rates in the study were 38.1% and 48%, respectively. Combining with the COD and BOD; data, this observation further confirmed that MSW without biosolids can be degraded faster than MSW with biosolids in aerobic environment while MSW with biosolids can be degraded faster than the MSW without biosolids in anaerobic condition.

2.3 S u m m ary o f Experim ental Results and Discussions - AM R Vs. ASR le experim ental results in this section indicated that biosolids addition had positive effects
1 the

decom position o f M SW with high organic and moisture contents in aerobic-anaerobic

oreactor landfills. le leachate am m onia concentration in both AM R and ASR increased progressively in the iidy, and no am m onia decrease was observed in both bioreactors probably due to the time )nstraint. The am m onia concentration in ASR was not in the same order of magnitude as in MR. C om bining with the other bioreactors' data, the leachate ammonia concentration in oreactors containing biosolids was much higher than in those without biosolids. This jservation can be attribute to the added biosolids because they have undergone anaerobic gestion. SR only used half am ount o f buffer as AMR, but the leachate pH values were higher in SR than in A M R at every sampling point in the study. Both bioreactors had the same Deration pro to co ls except ASR containing biosolids. Therefore, it was concluded that osolids have strong buffering effects that may result from the high am m onia content in the osolids. he w aste w eight reduction rates in A M R and ASR were about 15% and 21 %, respectively, his indicated that the overall biodégradation rate in ASR was faster than in AMR. This inclusion w as also confirm ed by the overall reduction rates o f COD, BOD5 and TS Dncentrations. 1 contrast, the reduction rates o f COD, BOD; and TS concentrations were higher in A M R Ian in A S R in the aerobic stage. It can be derived that the reduction rates o f these param eters

84

were higher In ASR than in AMR in the anaerobic stage. It can be concluded that MSW without biosolids were degraded faster in the aerobic environment and MSW with biosolids were degraded faster in the anaerobic environment. Biosolids served as seeds in the anaerobic degradation and accelerated the anaerobic degradation progress. This can also be verified by the earlier buffering stop time in the anaerobic stage. 4.3 Experim ental Results and Discussions - AM R Vs. AM F and ASR Vs. ASF This section presents the experimental results of bioreactors AMR, AMF, ASR and ASF, and focuses on the discussion about the effects of single-pass operation and closed-loop leachate recirculation operation on the decomposition of MSW with high organic and moisture contents. There are two comparison groups: AMR Vs. AMF and ASR Vs. ASF. Bioreactors AMR and AMF were loaded with MSW without biosolids. AMR operated in leachate recirculation mode with buffering and AMF operated in single-pass mode without buffering. Bioreactors ASR Vs. ASF were loaded with MSW with biosolids. ASR operated in leachate recirculation mode with buffering and ASF operated in single-pass mode without buffering. 4.3.1 Physical Variations - AMR Vs. AM F and ASR Vs. ASF After about 100 days bioreactor treatment, the weight of the wastes in each of the four bioreactors decreased to a different extent. The wet weight reduction rates in AMR, AMF, ASR and ASF were 14.4%, 21.1%, 20.4% and 24%, respectively. The weight reduction rates in single-pass bioreactors AMF and ASF were obviously higher than those in the leachate recirculation bioreactors AMR and ASR. Figures 4-13 and 4-14 illustrate the waste settlement rates in the four bioreactors. The overall

85

îttlement rates in A M R, AMF, ASR and A SP were 22% , 27% , 24% and 27% , respectively. he settlem ent characters in single-pass bioreactors were better than those in the leachate circulation bioreactors. The density and field capacity changes in the four bioreactors are resented in Table 4-15.

The initial pH values in AMR, AMF, ASR and ASF were 4.40, 4.60, 4.50 and 4.90, espectively. All the four bioreactors operated with air addition in the first 18 days. The air wrought the pH values to about the neutral values in the four bioreactors (refer to Table 4-16). illustrated in Figures 4-15 and 4-16, the pH curves o f the single-pass bioreactors AM F and \.SF w ere above those o f the leachate recirculation bioreactors AMR and ASR. This may esult from the different operation m odes because the added tap w ater flushed away the ;enerated VFAs. In the anaerobic stage, the leachate recirculation bioreactors operated with eachate buffering and the single bioreactors operated without leachate buffering. Therefore, ne pH values in leachate recirculation bioreactors kept the increase trend and were around le neutral value, while the pH values in single-pass bioreactor kept decrease trend and were w ay from the neutral value. a b le 4 -1 6 R ep resen tativ e pH Values in A M R , AMF, A SR an d ASF AMR Initial pH pH at the end o f aerobic stage pH at the end o f the study 4.40 6.30 7.00 AMF 4.60 6.50 6.30 A SR 4.50 6.70 7.00 A SF 4.90 7.60 6.90

com parison group: ASR and ASF, the COD, BOD 5 and TS reduction rates in the

ngle-pass bioreactor A SF were all higher than those in the leachate recirculation bioreactor SR (refer to Table 4-17). herefore, it was concluded that the single-pass operation m ode was more effective for nproving the final leachate quality in the bioreactors. In the operation of single-pass ioreactors, tap w ater was constantly added into the bioreactors to simulate the rainfall. T he dded w ater diluted the leachate in the bioreactors and flushed away the pollutants and ansported to the dow nstream treatment units.

Variations in NH 3 -N
In comparison group: AMR and AMF, the initial NH.i-N concentrations were 24 and 25 mg/1, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 4-23, in AMR, the NH 3-N concentration increased progressively and reached the highest concentration 550 mg/1 at the end of the study. In AMF, the NH 3-N concentration increased to the peak (500 mg/1) on day 36 and then sharply decreased. The final NH 3-N in AMF was about half of that in AMR. In comparison group: ASR and ASF, the initial NH 3-N concentrations were 330 and 340 mg/1, respectively. In ASR, the NH 3-N variation trend was the same as in AMR. The final NH 3-N concentration was 1,020 mg/1. In ASF, the NH 3-N variation trend was the same as in AMF. It jumped to peak (2,890 mg/1) on day 30 and then sharply decreased (refer to Figure 4-24). The final NH 3-N in ASF was also about half of that in ASR. The lower final NH 3-N concentrations in the single-pass bioreactors can also be attributed to the flushing effects.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 Conclusions With the increase in waste recycling and diversion, MSW with high organic and moisture contents (80% -90% of the total weight of the MSW) can be found in various landfills worldwide. This study aimed to decompose this type of MSW in aerobic - anaerobic bioreactor landfills. In the study, the effects of air addition and biosolids addition on the biodégradation of MSW with high organic and moisture contents were examined. Moreover, the flushing technology was compared with the leachate recirculation technology. Six bioreactor landfills have been set up in the lab. Based on their respective operational protocol, matrix components, and replicate number of the bioreactors, the six bioreactors were identified as AMF, A M R l, AMR2, ASF, ASR, and NMR (A: air; N: no air; M: MSW; S; biosolids; F: flushing; R: recirculation). Based on the analyses of the experimental results, conclusions were as following: > The positive effects of air addition were concluded based on the performance comparison between AMR and NMR. AMR operated in two sequential stages (aerobic and anaerobic stages) while NMR operated in the constant anaerobic stage. The two bioreactors approximately utilized the same amount of buffer in the study. But, after about 100 days operation, the leachate pH values in AMR have been in the methanogenesis favorite range of 6.4 - 7.2 without buffering while the pH values still decreased after the buffering was stopped in NMR, as well as the pH values in AMR were higher than in NMR at every sampling point in the study period. In the anaerobic environment, organic materials were hydrolyzed to VFAs that can cause acidic

97

environm ent in the w aste ecosystem. The low pH values even can reverse the anaerobic biodégradation. In the aerobic environment, organics were broke dow n into carbon dioxide, am m onia and water, at the same time, avoiding the generation o f VFAs. Hence, it was concluded that initially degrading MSW with high organic and m oisture content under aerobic environm ent was effective for building up the optim um pH environment for the following anaerobic degradation. Meanwhile, this observation indicated that N M R lagged behind AM R in the anaerobic progress. In other words, the air addition in the aerobic stage accelerated the downstream anaerobic biodégradation. A fter about 100 days bioreactor treatment, the mass reduction rate in NMR was only one fifth o f that in A M R. The initial COD concentration in AMR was approximately equal to that in N M R, as well as the initial BODs concentration in AM R was approxim ately equal to that in NMR. However, the final BODs concentration in NM R was even double that in A M R (21,200 and 10,700 mg/1 for NMR and AMR, respectively), while the final COD concentration in NM R was higher than that in AMR by 39.1 % o f the final COD in AMR (44,100 and 31,700 mg/1 for N M R and AM R, respectively). The final TS concentrations were 32,900 and 27,650 mg/1 for NM R and A M R , respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that the air addition accelerated the biodégradation o f the organics as well as improved the final leachate quality. The N Hs-N concentrations increased progressively with time in both bioreactors. The final NHj-'N concentrations were 550 and 1,300 mg/1 for AMR and NMR, respectively. T he low er NH3-N in A M R may be attributed to the air addition, or may be attributed to the inherent heterogeneity of the MSW.

98

y The positive effects o f biosolids addition were concluded based on the performance
comparison between AMR and ASR. The leachate ammonia concentrations in ASR was higher than in AMR by one order of magnitude. This resulted from the added biosolids because they have undergone anaerobic digestion. ASR only used half amount of buffer as AMR, but the leachate pH values were higher in ASR than in AMR at every sampling point in the study. Both bioreactors had the same operation protocols except ASR containing biosolids. Therefore, it was concluded biosolids have strong buffering effects that may result from the high ammonia content in the biosolids. The waste weight reduction rates in AMR and ASR were about 15% and 21%, respectively. This indicated that the overall biodégradation rate in ASR was faster than in AMR. This conclusion was also confirmed by the overall reduction rates of COD,
BOD5 and TS. In contrast, the reduction rates of COD, BOD5 and TS were higher in

AMR than in ASR in the aerobic stage. Hence, it can be derived that the reduction rates of these parameters were higher in ASR than in AMR in the anaerobic stage. It can be concluded that MSW without biosolids were degraded faster in the aerobic environment and MSW with biosolids were degraded faster in the anaerobic environment. Biosolids served as seeds in the anaerobic degradation and accelerated the anaerobic degradation progress. This can also be testified by the earlier buffering stop time in the anaerobic stage. > Based on the experimental data of waste weight reduction rates, COD, BOD 5 , TS, and NH 3-N, the single-pass operation mode was more effective for removing pollutants from the bioreactor landfills. But, it transported the pollutants to the downstream

99

treatm ent units. From the econom ic view o f point, this operation m ode is not attractive. Initially degrading M SW under aerobic condition before anaerobic degradation with biosolids addition is the optimum strategy for the decom position o f M SW with high organic and m oisture contents. ,2 R ecom m endations s concluded above, air addition was beneficial for building up the optim um pH environment )r the dow nstream anaerobic stage and accelerated the decom position o f the M SW with high rganic and m oisture contents. However, the air supply is costly in the field bioreactor ndfills. From the econom ic view o f point, the optimal period o f aerobic stage needs further ivestigation. heoretically, in the aerobic environment, ammonia can be utilized as a substrate for aerobic acteria, and be converted to nitrite through nitrification. Therefore, the aerobic stage is zneficial for the rem oval o f high concentration ammonia in MSW with biosolids. It needs irther investigation to conclude the extent o f ammonia removal in the aerobic stage with the ISW containing the given percentage o f nitrogenous organics.
