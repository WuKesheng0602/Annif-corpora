Abstract APPLYING SIX SIGMATM TO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMEN T SYSTEM DESIGN Cheryl Campbell Master of Applied Science 2004 Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University

There is currently very little literature available that describes a defined method for designing an EMS. The thesis hypothesis was that the Six SigmaTM method could be applied to EMS design. The Six SigmaTM method was chosen because it has been successfully implemented in many large corporations in order to improve the quality of products and business processes. Six SigmaTM provides a defined and structured method that allows a problem or opportunity to be defined, measured, analyzed, improved, and controlled. This results in a method that can be used over and over again to design or improve an EMS. This is a concept that not been thoroughly developed in EMS literature to date. However, it is the structured process o f Six SigmaTM itself that is probably more beneficial in EMS design as opposed to focusing on which tools are used during the DMAIC process.

Chapter 1. Introduction and Study Information

1.1

Introduction There are many different methods in place for Environmental Management

System (EMS) design. However, "EMS work has focused on the identification and description o f components and frameworks but has not addressed how to put them together" (Kirkland and Thompson, 1999: 128). Often time, personnel responsible for EMS design do it in isolation and end up recreating what other companies may have already done. "The current challenge in EMS work is .. .to take EMSs from the theoretical to the practical" (Kirkland and Thompson, 1999: 139). Therefore there is a need for a systematic and consistent process for EMS design. Lack of an EMS may result in decreased management efficiency, decreased operational efficiency, increased liability, and increased fines and compliance costs. 1.2 Study Background There is currently very little literature available that describes a defined method for designing an EMS. The literature predominantly focuses on conducting pre-EMS development reviews, or gap analyses, auditing an EMS, and evaluating the effectiveness o f an EMS to a limited extent' (Hagarty, 1998). However, there is a need for formal studies on the various ways to incorporate environmental policies into an EMS (Gabel and Sinclair-Desgagné, 1993). 1.3 Study Hypothesis and Objectives The thesis hypothesis was that the Six SigmaTM method could be applied to EMS design. The Six SigmaTM method was chosen because it has been successfully implemented in many large corporations in order to improve the quality of various

business processes resulting in improved profits (Waxer, 2001). As a result, the objectives of this study where to determine; · The applicability, benefits, strengths, weaknesses and limitations associated with using Six SigmaTM method for EMS design · If a Roadmap^ that includes problem-solving, measurement, and cost reduction tools could be developed for subsequent use in EMS design · If Six SigmaTM provides a systematic and consistent method for organizations to design an EMS 1.4 Study Scope and Limitations The principal research question of the study was as follows: Can the Six SigmaTM method be used to design an EMS? To answer the above question, the following sub-questions needed to be addressed: 1. Could the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control (DMAIC) phases of the Six SigmaTM method be applied to EMS design? 2. Is the Six SigmaTM method adaptable to EMS design in addition to its traditional use for quality improvement in manufacturing processes? The study did not focus on topics such as: quality methods with no evidence of use in environmental management, the Enviromnental Management and Auditing Scheme (EMAS); the Commission for Environmental Cooperation; risk management systems; methods for including occupational health and safety in the EMS; what motivates employees in an organization to participate in EMS design; why organizations set environmental performance goals (Ransom and Lober, 1999); or why organizations adopt "beyond-compliance environmental policies" (Prakash, 2001). The study also did

not include a review of the quality and statistical techniques and tools that can be used in Six SigmaTM. Instead the report only discusses the tools used in the case study. Although a comprehensive review of quality and statistical tools could be beneficial, Six SigmaTM is different from other approaches because it focuses on extensive use of fewer tools that are linked and sequenced in a very methodical way (Horel and Snee, 2002). Moreover, Six SigmaTM includes a subset of tools that range from the basic to the advanced (Pyzdek, 2001). 1.5 Study Assumptions There were a number of assumptions associated with the study as listed below: · Several organizations are currently using the Six SigmaTM method to continually improve their business processes · There is a senior management and employee commitment to environmental management needed in order to achieve business practices that are more environmentally sustainable (Yamell, 1999) · Many organizations are willing to use an EMS to manage their environmental risks · Organizations currently using Six SigmaTM will consider using the method to design an EMS · 1.6 There are sufficient resources (financial and human resources) to design an EMS Organization of the Report The report begins with an outline of the method used to complete the study. Chapter three includes a comparative literature review that discusses quality methods used for improvements in environmental management. Chapters four to eight detail the

work completed during each of the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control phases of the case study. Chapter nine provides a discussion regarding the applicability, benefits, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations associated with applying the Six SigmaTM method to EMS design. The report then ends with conclusions regarding the application of the Six SigmaTM to EMS design.

Chapter 2, Study Method A case study was completed following the DMAIC process to design an EMS at "Company A"^, which is a medium-sized electrical equipment repair facility located in the Ontario Golden Horseshoe area. This facility was chosen because it currently uses Six SigmaTM in its business processes, and it did not have an ISO 14000-based EMS in place. The DMAIC process included: · Define - defining the stakeholder requirements, identifying the problem to resolve, and developing the team charter · Measure - measuring how the current EMS process performed by identifying and collecting the key data to measure · Analyze --analyzing the data collected as well as the process to determine the cause of the problems that are resulting in variation in the EMS process · Improve - developing solutions based on data analysis to improve the EMS process · Control - putting controls in place to ensure that improvements are maintained (Adapted from Eckes, 2001; Green, 2000; Tayntor, 2003) The stucy was conducted with the involvement o f a team of Company A employees with included: the Service Centre Manager; Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Manager; Shop Lead Hand; facility EHS Representative; Purchaser; and the Shipper/Receiver. Each stage of the Six SigmaTM method was completed with this team,

The study author was a participant observer, and participated as the Green Belt'* in team exercises and meetings. Observations were recorded are documented in chapters four to ten including text, figures, tables, as well as in the appendices. Decisions made throughout the study were based on the DMAIC process.

Chapter 3. Literature Review The literature review starts with the history of management systems, quality systems, EMSs and their current uses, followed by a review of different quality methods used in EMS design or improvement in environmental management including the PlanDo-Check-Act (PDCA) approach (ISO 14000) method, the Total Quality Management (TQM) method, the Baldrige Model method, the Kaizen method, the Systems method, and the Six SigmaTM method. A review was completed of each method's application to EMS design or improvement in environmental management, along with its associated strengths, benefits, weaknesses, and limitations. Approximately two hundred companies that publicly claim to use Six SigmaTM in their business operations were also reviewed to see if any of them were currently applying the Six Sigma^" ^ method to EMS design. 3.1 Management Systems Many organizations today have implemented management systems in order to manage people, make quality products, track finances, or to minimize potential risk and liability. A system is defined as an organized set of components arranged such that they work together toward one or more goals (Dennis, 1997). Management systems include management functions such as planning, organizing, leading, and controlling the system which results in a system where its parts are related, ordered, arranged, and work together in order to achieve a purpose or goal* (Flood and Carson, 1995). One area where many organizations are using a management system is in the quality arena.

Quality Management Quality management has become a major part of many North American, business

operations. This occurred as a result of North American industries suffering quality problems in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1970s and 1980s, North American businesses began to adopt Japane'^;p quality techniques in an attempt to recover their competitive edge (Dennis, 1997). There are four chronological periods that can be identified in the twentieth century. The first period could be called the "Taylor inspection period" (Keren, 2001). Frederick Taylor believed that every process could be broken down into minimal activities, and by distributing the activities to difierent workers, the probability that an error would occur would be reduced to a minimum (Keren, 2001). This approach was called "scientific management", where the "doing" and "thinking" parts of work were not connected (Dennis, 1997). The second period was identified as the quality control period. During the period, it was recognized that error was a systematic matter and not only an employee issue. The occurrence of a defect or error is not the employee's fault or the employer's fault. Instead, it is an error in the system that leads to an error or defect (Keren, 2001). The quality movement then entered the quality assurance period when businesses recognized that their responsibility for a product did not end once it went out the door (Keren, 2001). The last and current period is quality management. This period has taken place during the last twenty years approximately (Keren, 2001). In quality management, the focus is not just on the product produced, but also the processes, activities, and people involved making the product. Previous definitions of quality often overlooked the fact that a system rarely consisted of a single element conforming to a standard. Individual elements, when put together, may not work as a system. Quality

management now means realizing value for both the customer and organization in every aspect of the business relationship (Harry, 2000).^ A number of quality principles have resulted from the different quality movement periods. First, quality is a philosophical movement that is driven by senior management (Dennis, 1997). Senior management has to believe that implementing quality techniques and methods will result in a better product and better organization. Quality involves everyone. It is not just a quality inspector who is responsible for quality, nor is it just the Quality Assurance Manager. Each person contributes to the organization's success through their work, and therefore is responsible for its results. This is an important concept since it allows capturing the insight of the people closest to the source of problems (Dennis, 1997). This idea is also similar to the Memal Responsibility System (1RS) principles found in occupational health and safety (OHS) systems and legislation. In the 1RS philosophy, each person in an organization is responsible for identifying OHS problems and seeking solutions. Another important element is accountability, where everyone is accountable for his or her actions (Plummer et al, 2000).' Quality focuses on continuously improving the system instead of placing blame, and promotes upstream prevention, as opposed to downstream inspection activities after an activity or step has been completed. This helps to reduce waste and rework activities that are not cost effective in terms of material and resources. Quality also uses data based decisions (Dennis, 1997). This is because what gets measured gets managed, particularly if the result is to reduce variation (errors or defects) in a product or process. Therefore,
®This is evident with the change in the ISO 9001 International Standard. The 1994 version was very rigid and product focused, and companies had to fit their business into the 19 elements o f the Standard. Therefore, a company could make square tires for a car as long as they consistently made them square even if it was useless for the customer. The ISO 9001:2000 Standard, however, begins with finding out your customers requirements first. It also focuses on ensuring consistent business processes, as oppose to just producing a product, to ensure that an organization gives the customer what they want. Dr. Peter Strahlendorf has also completed articles and teaching material regarding the concept o f the Internal Responsibility System (1RS).

statistical analysis is often used to analyze data in order to design and implement solutions to reduce defect or error. This is important since reducing variation, error or defects minimizes dissatisfied customers and losses (Dennis, 1997). These same principles can be applied to environmental management. For example, implementing upstream prevention activities such as pollution prevention activities can minimize or eliminate pollution at the emission point, and reduce or remove the need for end-of-pipe pollution abatement technologies. This reduces waste (or pollution) going into the environment. Measuring the amount of waste after the implementation of pollution reduction solutions can indicate whether they are effective in reducing the amount o f pollution generated. A systematic approach to environmental management can organize activities to ensure that efficient steps are taken to reduce negative impact on the environment. Continuously seeking new and better ways for an organization to reduce its negative impact on the environment is an example of continuous improvement. Finally, involving everyone in the environmental management process removes the responsibility from one individual and clarifies organizational arrangements in environmental management (Dennis, 1997). It is no wonder that EMS design is primarily based on quality principles. The very same elements are integral to a successful EMS. However, many quality methods used for environmental management are project-specific as oppose to addressing a management system. Quality techniques used for EMS design often define the end performance goal o f the system, but do not include steps to design an EMS in order to reach the performance goals.

3.3

Environmental Management Systems (EMS) The term "environmental management" does not mean that the environment can

be managed, but instead that institutions and people that impact the environment can be managed (Knit and Gleckman, 1998). Environmental impact is a result of organizations doing business, and therefore organizations need a system to manage and minimize that impact. As such, an EMS is a "formal set of procedures and policies that define how a business will manage its potential impact on the natural environment and on the health and welfare of the people who depend on it" (Damall et al, 2000: 1). The goal of the EMS is for organizations to successfully integrate environmental considerations into their operations and decision-making. 3.4 EMS Trends 3.4.1 Judicial Reliance on EMS

The use o f EMSs is becoming more important for organizations. For example, as of late 2000 the judicial system began to use EMS as a benchmark for desirable behaviour from industry in terms o f environmental management (CSA, 2001). The primary standard that has been used is the ISO 14001 International Standard created by the International Organization for Standardization located in Geneva, Switzerland.* However, in Canada prosecutors are likely to use elements of the ISO 14001 Standard to test a defendant's claim of due diligence in defence of a charge (CSA, 2001). For example, has the organization identified its applicable legal requirements? Has the organization audited its activities and processes and designed a formal compliance plan? (CSA, 2001).

* A more in-depth review o f ISO 14001 will be discussed in the "Quality Methodologies for EMS Design" section o f the paper.

EMS requirements have been built right into the sentencing structure of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA, 1999). For example, it tells a judge to consider if any remedial or preventive action has been taken or proposed by or on behalf o f the offender, including having an EMS in place that meets a recognized Canadian or International Standard. The sentencing judge can also include in the sentencing an order that directs the offender to implement an EMS that meets a recognized Canadian or International Standard (Environment Canada, 1999). There are many examples where companies have been sentenced to design and implement an EMS including Prospec Chemicals Ltd., Prototype Circuits Inc., Van Waters & Rogers Ltd., and the City o f Calgary (CSA, 2001).^ Requirements for an EMS have also been included in Certificates of Approval (C of A) in Ontario. For example. Material Resource Recovery SRBP Inc. was seeking approval under the Ontario Environmental Protection Act to establish a hazardous waste processing facility for mercaptan wastes and fluorescent light ballasts. The Ontario Environmental Assessment Board included the requirement to design and implement an EMS in the terms and conditions of the C of A (CSA, 2001). The requirement for an EMS has also been used "as part of administrative settlements in other countries" (CSA, 2001). For example, the US Department of Justice required Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines to implement an EMS after it was found to have dumped waste into the ocean. This requirement is expected to become the norm for cruise lines in the near future (CSA, 2001).

®For more information regarding these cases see the publication "ISO 14001 and Compliance in Canada" from the Canadian Standards Association, or Canadian case law.

I

Regulators' Use of EMSs

Both federal and provincial governments realize that an EMS is a good tool for a i I
1

regulated industry to manage its environmental impact. Industry and the public have traditionally defined environmental protection as almost exclusively the government's responsibility (Executive Resource Group, 2001). However, governments are now recognizing the trend toward a shared responsibility by regulatory agencies, industry, non-governmental agencies and the scientific/technical community in managing the environment (Executive Resource Group, 2001). This leads to more performance-based regulations, and more o f a partnership. The reasons for this shift are many. First, governments realize that they do not have the resources to fully regulate, inspect, charge and prosecute, and this approach has not been the most effective in environmental management (Executive Resource Group, 2001). Governments are also realizing that the "command and control" approach as a stand-alone approach does not adequately address the more emerging complex environmental challenges of today and in the future (Executive Resource Group, 2001). This is because there may be a lack of knowledge regarding such complex problems in the "command and control approach". However, a performance-based approach establishes the performance target for industry, but allows those with knowledge o f the problem to work towards the performance goal. Therefore, there is the move to a more integrated approach of "compliance assurance"'° where a number of regulatory and non-regulatory tools or instruments such as enforcement, abatement, cooperative agreements, compliance assistance and economic instruments are employed (Executive Research Group, 2001).

However, failure to follow an abatement action can still lead to enforcement action. The provision of information to help the regulated facility comply with environmental laws.

Example Mandatory disclosure, investigations and prosecutions, civil liability, criminal, administrative and civil sanctions.

Approvals, permitting, licensing, monitoring, inspections, remediation, warnings, occurrence reports, control, stop and remediation orders.

Economic Instruments

Cooperative Agreements

A method of using market incentives and charges to motivate compliance and exemplary environmental performance (tradable emission permits, emission charges). An agreement that requires parties to meet binding information disclosure and performance objectives in return for government incentives.

Education and training, technical advice, information, plain language legislation, hot lines, websites, community and business partnerships, codes of practice and guidelines. Tradable emission permits, emission charges, "feebates", financial assurance, subsidies and deposit-refund systems.

Unilateral industry commitments (Responsible Care), public disclosure schemes (ARET), recognition programs (P4 program --reduction and pollution prevention achievement), and negotiated agreements and covenants (REVA)

These tools go be) ^ the "command and control" approach where the regulatory body dictates what has to . wdone. Instead the tools are more performance-based where the regulated facility is given more flexibility to achieve the end goal, since it is the regulated facility that processes the most knowledge about the problem or areas that need to be improved. The basic premise is that the goal to be achieved will dictate what compliance assurance tool to use. However, there is still the challenge of finding the r i ^ t tool to do the right job (Executive Research Group, 2001). EMS requirements have been incorporated into a number of regulatory tools throughout Canada. For example, The Nova Scotia Pipeline Regulations require all operators to comply with ISO 14001 (CSA, 2001). New Brunswick's Gas Distribution Act, 1999 also requires gas distributors to design an EMS (CSA, 2001). Finally, British Columbia's Waste Management Act requires applicable facilities to use a management system as part of their product stewardship programs, such as programs that take back residual product (such as paint) and containers from consumers (CSA, 2001). Another tool in which EMS requirements have been incorporated is the cooperative agreement. Environmental cooperative or performance agreements include i
[

two paiiies that enter into an agreement to carry out specified activities on the other's behalf, or in order to agree to achieve some kind o f "end". Sector associations, governments, and NGOs (sometimes) enter into a cooperative agreement as a voluntary initiative to support pollution prevention. For example, the MOE has created a cooperative agreement with the Automotive Parts Manufacturing Association (APMA)

where one of the entrj' requirements is to have an ISO 14001-based EMS in place (Ministry o f the Environment, 2003). A similar requirement is also included in Environment Canada's (EC) environmental performance agreement with the Automotive

identified as a major element in these cooperative agreements. Canadian regulators have also incorporated EMS requirements into permit requirements. In Alberta, for example, EMS requirements were built right into Shell Canada Limited's operating approval for the Jumping Pond sour gas plant. In terms of tax credits, Nova Scotia regulators have offered a tax credit for the cost of obtaining ISO 14001 registration (CSA, 2001). In the US, a number o f state jurisdictions are allowing companies that have implemented an EMS to conduct their own routine monitoring, reporting, and auditing with clear accountability and verification requirements (Executive Resource Group, 2000). For example, in 1997 the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP) launched the Environmental Results Program. The program requires companies in targeted sectors to submit an annual self-certification of compliance to the MDEP that is signed by the most senior corporate official in the company. If a facility is not in compliance with all applicable requirements, it has to identify deficiencies and complete a Return to Compliance (RTC) report that describes how and when it will achieve compliance. Failure to certify will result in a $1,000 per day fine. The program is also complemented with a compliance assistance program. The program currently applies to the dry-cleaning, photo processing, and printing industries (Executive Resources Group,
2000 ).

New Jersey implemented the Silver Track program in 1999. The program provides different degrees o f regulatory flexibility and oversi^t for qualifying facilities (Executive Resources Group, 2000). The program requires accountability, measures

environmental performance, and provides operational flexibility. Furthermore, acceptance into the program indicates a demonstrable and measurable commitment to improved environmental performance, together with monitoring, reporting and oversight by the Department (Executive Resources Group, 2000). 3.4.3 Industry's Use of EMSs

Many organizations have adopted a formal EMS in order to systematically manage their environmental risk and impact performance (Damall et al, 2000). It is widely recognized that by improving the environmental perfonnance of organizations, the negative environmental effects of organizations within modem society can be reduced (Yamell, 1999). Since the 1970s, many organizations have designed environmental management procedures, although environmental management has largely remained the responsibility of a single person within the organization (Damall et al, 2000). One person assigned to environmental management is not going to be as effective as everyone in the organization doing it. More importantly, completing environmental management i I as an isolated, ancillary activity usually results in reactive management, as opposed to a naturally intrinsic consideration in all business activities. Inadequate environmental . management may result if the EMS is not integrated with other systems within the [
f

organization (Kirkland and Thompson, 1999). Thus, environmental management should be "an organization-wide mission for which all managers would be held accountable"

i

(Damall et al, 2000: 1). However, many organizations today are adopting EMSs in order to better integrate environmental considerations throu^out their operations in order to manage environmental impacts more effectively and efficiently (Damall et al, 2000). As I Yamell states, "to achieve more environmentally friendly business practices, organizations must design intemal management processes that integrate environmental

objectives into their day-to-day operations" (Yamelh 1999: 1). As a result, in the 1990s EMSs were developed in order to provide a framework for organizations that were trying to incorporate environmental objectives into their decision-making (Yamell, 1999). There are many other reasons why industry is adopting EMSs. Organizations may implement an EMS because their stakeholders want it. For example, judges, regulators, shareholders, non-govemmental organizations (NGOs), ethical fund managers, lenders, clients, and the general public may want an organization to implement an EMS (Damall et al, 2000; Yamell, 1999). Intemal customers such as enlightened employees and "legacy-minded" Chief Executive Officers may want it. There are a number o f benefits associated with EMSs as well. An EMS allows organizations to use its experience, knowledge, in s is t and motivation to "answer" the problem of environmental protection. An EMS can ensure that organizations comply with applicable environmental legislation, as well as manage their environmental risks and liabilities. In theory, once a business implements an EMS, it will surpass specific procedural or regulatory standards for such regulated activities, and "may identify opportunities for reducing non-regulated environmental impacts...[and] may also lessen their environmental reporting burdens and the cost associated with them" (Damall et al, 2000; 2). Other benefits include increased management efficiency, increased operational efficiency, reduced liability, regulatory benefits, improved community relationships, and improved customer/supplier relationships, cost savings due to activities such as reduced raw material usage, water usage, waste disposal costs, fines and compliance costs (University of North Carolina, 2003).

Industry wants to be competitive throuÿi lean production and quality, and now decision makers see environmental management as a means to efficiency and I competitiveness as well. 3.5 Quality Methods for EMS Design EMS studies have focused primarily on conducting EMS gap analyses, auditing
f

an EMS, and the benefits of implementing an EMS. However, there is limited information available regarding actual methods used for designing an EMS (Yamell, 1999). Although there is clearer guidance as to what is expected as part of the EMS i' (CSA, 2001), there is a lack of studies, examples and explanations of how to design an EMS (Kirkland and Thompson, 1999). Therefore, the current challenge in EMS work is I j to move from theory to application (Kirkland and Thompson, 1999). Different quality methods have been used for EMS design or environmental management improvement. The discussion below highlights different quality methods that have been used for EMS design to varying degrees, including ISO standards, Total ( I I Quality Management (TQM), the Malcolm Baldrige Model, Kaizen, and the Systems Approach. Each approach is reviewed below as to evaluate its application to EMS, its benefits, and limitations. The discussion ends with a comparative review of the Six SigmaTM method, and why it can be applied to EMS design, 3.5.1 ISO 14000

ISO 14000 is a family of global, voluntary environmental management standards created and promoted by the International Organization for Standardization located in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO 14001 is the standard against which organizations may have their EMS audited and registered through a third party registrar (Corbett and Kirsch, 2000). ISO 14000 uses the quality Plan-Do~Check-Act approach to environmental

management, which is a cycle of activities designed to drive continuous improvement in an organization. It was first designed by Walter Shewhart, and was popularized by W. Edward Deming. The planning aspect includes the identification and significance ranking o f an organization's environmental aspects and impacts respectively. An organization also identifies its applicable legal and other requirements during this stage. Objectives and targets that are consistent with the organization's policy and pollution prevention goals are then established, and environmental management programs are implemented to achieve the objectives and targets. The implementation aspect of the cycle involves defining the structure and responsibility of personnel involved in managing the EMS. This stage also includes training and awareness of employees, as well as communication, documentation, operational control, and emergency response. The monitoring and measurement stage o f the cycle monitors and measures environmental objectives and targets, compliance with environmental regulations, and monitoring equipment. Nonconformance, corrective and preventive action, records and intemal audits are all tools to assist with checking the status of the EMS. Finally, the "act" stage involves management review to ensure that the EMS is functioning, and may include changes for continual improvement. The key measurement is determining whether the EMS is achieving the commitments o f the environmental policy (International Organization for Standardization, 1996). The standard is intended to "provide organizations with the elements of an effective environmental management system which can be integrated with other management requirements, to assist organizations to achieve environmental and economic goals" (International Organization for Standardization, 1996: v). However,

ISO 14000 is not only about environmental management. According to Corbett and Kirsch it is "a broader business standard intended to help registered firms integrate, gain control over, and ultimately improve overall, company-wide environmental performance" (Corbett and Kirsch, 2000; 8). It is about an organization using quality techniques to effectively manage an aspect of its business. There are many potential benefits associated with implementing an ISO 14000 EMS including the following: · · · » · · « « Demonstrating a standard of care with respect to due diligence Savings firom reduced noncompliance with environmental regulations Satisfying investors, public and environmental groups Heightening employee satisfaction and morale Facilitating access to capital and insurance Streamlining and reducing environmental reporting requirements Increasing resource productivity (material savings and waste reduction) Accessing markets that design tlie standard as a "de facto" requirement in business relationships (Adapted fi-om Yamell, 1999) There are also a number of limitations associated with the ISO 14000 EMS framework. ISO 14000 EMS provides an organization with wide latitude in implementation, therefore facilitating adoption by different types of organizations (Davis, 2000). However, this wide latitude also results in a lack of a method to implement the EMS. As Kirkland and Thompson state, "while these models outline what should be introduced, they provide little guidance on how EMSs may be implemented" (Kirkland and Thompson, 1999: 128). Although the ISO 14004 guidance document does attempt to
21

provide guidance on ISO 14001 implementation, some of the ambiguities of the standard
I

such as methods of identifying and ranking significant aspects remain limitations to implementation (CSA, 2001). Moreover, the ISO 14000 framework focuses on the identification and description o f components and frameworks "but has not addressed how to put the EMS elements together" (Kirkland and Thompson, 1999:128). There also tends to be a focus on top management commitment, and not employee involvement in the ISO 14000 EMS design process. The emphasis on top management commitment and not employee input into EMS policies, ISO outlines a top-down, hierarchical management approach, which contradicts current management trends (Yamell, 1999). Therefore, EMS responsibilities are often delegated to a single manager or small team, and this is not exemplary of the 1RS philosophy of everyone having a responsibility in environmental management. Finally, most ISO 14000 work has focused on risk reduction, compliance and liability, and as a consequence the connection between environmental performance and business performance is not being made as well as it could (International Network for Environmental Management, 1998). Most of the benefit and cost attributes are intangible by their nature and are therefore difficult to measure, and the link between good environmental management and the benefit to the organization's bottom line is not being consistently made (Petroni, 2000). ISO 14000 is gaining widespread acceptance as the tool to be used to design an EMS, due to its international applicability and more specifically because of supply chain pressure (International Network for Environmental Management, 1998). The main goal of creating ISO 14000 was to prevent the introduction of non-tariff trade barriers by standardizing the many national fi-ameworks that were occurring (Yamell, 1999). The

/

overall result may be that ISO 14000 "is being sold and bought on the basis of its implied trade advantage, not its environmental benefits" (Krut and Gleckman, 1998: 90). Environmental performance improvement is not necessarily the goal of the investment as oppose to gaining access to business markets (Krut and Gleckman, 1998). 3.5.2 Total Quality Management

Total quality management (TQM) was first introduced in Japan by W. Edward Deming and Joseph M. Juran as part of a US-sponsored rebuilding program following World War II (Hagarty, 1998). TQM gained popularity by the mid-1980s, and since then has become a widely-adopted management philosophy in North America (Hagarty, 1998). TQM is "a set of tools, a philosophy and process whose outputs yield customer satisfaction and continuous improvement" (Hradesky, 1995; 2). A key element in the TQM philosophy, which is similar to Six SigmaTM, is the change management focus, which includes processes like training and awareness programs (Yamell, 1999). Other elements o f the TQM philosophy that are very similar to Six SigmaTM include the following: · · The focus is on the customer, as he/she is the determiner of quality Quality is built into the product early (upstream) rather than being added on at the end (downstream) · · · · · Preventing variability is the key to producing high quality Quality results from people working within systems, not individual efforts Quality requires continuous improvement of inputs and processes Quality improvement requires strong worker participation Quality requires total organizational commitment

TQM, like Six SigmaTM, purports that everyone in the company is involved in EMS design (Hradesky, 1995) as opposed to the top-down approach of ISO 14000. It also requires that top management is involved and committed, and that the focus is on implementation (Bhat, 1998; Hradesky, 1995). Finally, TQM encourages employee motivation by recognizing employee achievements (Padhi, 2002). Total Quality Environmental Management (TQEM) is an extension of TQM, and was first introduced by the Global Environmental Management Initiative (GEMI) (Hagarty, 1998). GEMI is a non-profit organization whose mission is "Business helping business achieve environmental, health and safety excellence" (Hagarty, 1998: 64). The elements o f TQEM are also similar to Six SigmaTM, and include the following (Hagarty, 1998); · Identifying customers - the customer (or stakeholder) environmental requirements must be identified and actions taken to ensure that these requirements are met · Continuous improvement - there is a systematic on-going effort to improve business EMS processes · Do the job right the first time - the organization has to detect and eliminate environmental problems before they occur · The systems approach - every person and element of the organizational structure is part of the EMS, and therefore environmental concerns are included in all business decisions While TQM and Six SigmaTM principles are pretty much the same, there are limitations associated with the TQM method. Unlike Six SigmaTM, there is no roadmap provided to help decipher what statistical tools to use and when. TQM only provides 24

very broad guidelines for management to follow resulting in an unsuccessful attempt by many business leaders to deploy a strategy for TQM (Pyzdek, 2001). TQM programs also focus on improvements in individual operations with unrelated processes as opposed to making improvements in all operations within a process (Harry, 2000; Pande et al, 2000). For example, TQM may focus on improving the design stage in making a light bulb, whereas Six SigmaTM will examine each process in making a light bulb including design, purchasing, manufacturing, and shipping/receiving. Finally, TQM does not capture cost implications and savings associated with its changes. Instead, TQM offered a soft set o f philosophical guidelines and no way to prove that quality goals were achieved (Pyzdek, 2001). 3.5.3 The Malcolm Baldrige Model

The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award was established by US Congress in 1987 to recognize organizations for their quality and business performance achievements (Pojasek, 2000). "The award was designed to raise awareness about the importance o f quality and performance excellence as a competitive edge" (Pojasek, 2000: 92). At the time that this award was established, it was believed that quality was no longer an option for organizations but instead that it was a necessity of doing business (Pojasek, 2000). The criteria are now regarded as an international standard for performance excellence. This differs fi-om ISO Standards in that they only cover approximately ten percent o f the scope of the Malcolm Baldrige criteria, and furthermore do not fully address any of the Malcolm Baldrige criteria (Hagarty, 1998). The Malcolm Baldrige model provides a way to both measure progress and select continuous improvement projects to implement (Pojasek, 2000). It includes a rigorous scoring system that is used by highly trained examiners, and has a set of core values that

25

must be integrated throughout the program (Pojasek, 2000). This model has been successfully adapted for achieving environmental excellence in the State of New Mexico under its New Mexico Green Zia Environmental Excellence Program (Pojasek, 2000). Environmental criteria include (Pojasek, 2000): · Leadership - how senior management guides the organization and how the organization addresses its environmental responsibilities to the public · Planning for continuous environmental improvement - how the organization sets strategic goals for continuous environmental improvement and how it deteimines key action plans · Involvement o f customers, suppliers and others - how the organization determines the requirements and expectation of stakeholders · Information and analysis - how the organization manages, effectively uses, and analyzes data and information to support key environmental processes and the organization's performance in the EMS · Employee involvement - how the organization enables its workforce to be actively engaged in the organization's environmental performance · Process management - how key environmental processes are designed, managed and improved · Results - examines the organization's environmental performance and improvement, and how it performs compared to competitors Scoring is conducted by trained examiners and is initially based on applicant responses. The evaluation criteria fall under the categories of Approach/Deployment and Results. The rating scheme is a percentage-based score that determines how well the system is

i
implemented and measured. Examiners come to a score by consensus in order to allow for consistency in scoring (Pojasek, 2000). The Baldrige model does a nice job of requiring measurement and analysis in order to demonstrate improvement. Participants also benefit from a detailed feedback report that outlines all the strengths and weaknesses o f the application. "The report can provide for continuous improvement by specifying opportunities for improvement that the organization should focus on during the upcoming year" (Pojasek, 2000: 95). Furthermore, the Baldrige model encourages organizations to strive for excellence instead o f being satisfied with compliance (Pojasek, 2000). Nonetheless, the Baldrige model does not describe how to design an EMS; it only provides a scoring mechanism to evaluate how well an organization has designed it. The scoring system is also somewhat subjective since it is based on examiners coming to a consensus. A review o f the Malcolm Baldrige Award website did not indicate any winners for EMS design at this time. 3.5.4 Kaizen

The Kaizen approach advocates continual improvement through small steps. Kaizen is a Japanese word meaning gradual, orderly, continual improvement (Soltero and Waldrip, 2002). Like other quality approaches. Kaizen is based on post World War II business approaches that emphasized employee involvement, and fact-based decision making resulting in continuous improvement (Soltero and Waldrip, 2002). This method is similar to TQM and Six SigmaTM, but Kaizen goes further by requiring that everyone in an organization work together to make incremental improvements in the EMS without large capital investments (Soltero and Waldrip, 2002). In short. Kaizen is an evolutionary approach. Kaizen also takes programs "that may be seen as having

27

ownership in one department and makes them everyone's responsibility" (Soltero and Waldrip, 2002: 23). Once again, this exemplifies the 1RS philosophy of everyone having responsibility for environmental management as opposed to the top down approach of ISO 14000. The benefit of Kaizen is that it is a "low-cosl. people-based, continual imp'ovement strategy that is aimed at simplitying work methods in order to increase work flow" (Soltero and Waldrip, 2002: 26). However, Kaizen is more of a philosophy rather than a design tool as it provides a framework in which other quality methods can be employed to bring about change in increments. For example, Kaizen can be used as a fi'amework to allow for: 1) standardization through an ISO-14000 EMS; 2) simplify processes; and 3) reduce variation through initiatives such as Six SigmaTM (Soltero and Waldrip, 2002). This type o f approach is not only time consuming and long, but very costly in terms o f training and resources. 3.5.5 Systems Approach

The systems approach originates from systems theory'^. As previously stated, a system is defined as an organized set of components arranged such that they work together toward one or more goals (Dennis, 1997). Management systems include management functions such as planning, organizing, leading, and controlling into the system which results in a system where its parts are related, ordered, arranged, and work together in order to achieve a purpose or goal (Flood and Carson, 1995). The systems approach to EMS design "employs a team environment, using process characterization, problem-solving, and decision-making tools to identify opportunities for conserving resources, reducing wastes, and decreasing costs" (Wlodarczyk et al, 2000: 53).

See Flood and Carson "Dealing with Complexity: An Introduction to the Theory and Application o f Systems Science" for a comprehensive study o f systems theory-

28

According to the systems approach, organizations need a problem-solving method that will enable them to seek solutions on their own (Wlodarczyk et al, 2000). The tools used in the systems approach are designed for use in teams. Tools include process mapping, identifying and rank ordering environmental problems, "Pareto charting"^^ to identify dollars lost, root cause analysis, designing and choosing the best solution, and creating an action plan. The tools used in the systems approach are similar to those used in TQM and Six SigmaTM, and do a nice job of making the link between pollution and costs. Continuous improvement is also built into the method, as the steps the team will have completed are actually a collection of tools that the organization can use over and over to constantly improve and become more efficient (Wlodarczyk et al, 2000). The systems approach does a nice job of problem solving, but unlike Six SigmaTM, it lacks a consistent, methodical roadmap that can be used for EMS design. 3.5.6 Six SigmaTM

Six SigmaTM as a measurement standard can be traced back to Carl Gauss who introduced the concept o f the normal curve (isixsigma.com, 2002). Six SigmaTM as a measurement standard in product variation can be credited to Walter Shewhart who highlighted that three sigma from the mean is the point where a process requires correction (isixsigma.com, 2002). However, in 1979 Motorola designed Six SigmaTM as a methodical quality technique to provide more granularity by moving from the traditional quality measurement of errors per thousand opportunities to measure defects per million opportunities (isixsigma.com, 2002). In other words, the measurement indicator was moved from the traditional quality mark of 99% (or 3.8 sigma level) to the 99.99966% mark (6 sigma level). That means a difference 66, 807 defects per million

A Pareto-chart is a tool used to focus on the problems that pose the greatest potential for improvement showing their relative frequency or size in a descending bar graph (Brassard and Ritter, 1994).

opportunities versus 3.4 defects per million opportunities. For example, that can mean the difference between having unsafe drinking water almost fifteen minutes each day versus one minute of unsafe drinking water every seven months. Hence the name Six SigmaTM; it is a process that strives to reduce defects or errors to the point where only 3.4 defects per million opportunities will occur. Six SigmaTM is a disciplined method of defining, measuring, analyzing, improving and controlling the quality of a process (Ramberg, 2000). It has also been defined in a number o f other ways including; · · · A statistical measure of the performance o f a process or product A method used to reduce process cycle time A goal that reaches near perfection for performance improvement by reducing defects using facts and data to drive better solutions and · A system o f management to achieve lasting business leadership and world-class performance (Adapted from Pande and Holpp, 2002; Pyzdek, 2001) The quality principles and tools used in Six SigmaTM are not new. Like TQM, Six SigmaTM is a problem-solving process that focuses on improving stakeholder satisfaction. However, the difference is that a Six SigmaTM method provides a consistent roadmap for problem-solving. Six SigmaTM employs the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control (DMAIC) process. The steps are defined in the following table:

Phase Define:

Description Define customers, their requirements, the team charter and the key process that affects the customer, stakeholdercritical parameters, and the problem and identify what is important.

Measure how the current process performs, identify key measures and data collection plan for process in question, and execute a plan for data collection. Analyze data collected and the process to determine the Analyze: cause of the problems that are causing the process not to perform as desired. Improve the process to reduce defects and variation by Improve: generating, determining and subsequently implementing potential solutions. Control the process by designing, documenting and Control: implementing a plan to ensure that changes are sustained. (Adapted from Eckes, 2001; Green, 2000; Tayntor, 2003) Measure' . The key difference between the Six SigmaTM method and the Plan-Do-Check-Act method (ISO 14000) is that Six SigmaTM measures and analyzes a problem before implementing solutions, whereas ISO 14000 moves from the planning phase to the implementation phase without any measurement or analysis. Other characteristics that separate Six SigmaTM from otlier quality methods include producing major returns on investment, and changing how management operates (Pande and Holpp, 2002; Pyzdek, 2001). There are many benefits associated with using Six SigmaTM, including making improvements in all operations within a process, the ability to reach across the entire organization in a unified and focused manner, and the inclusion of a Control phase, which aims to keep process improvements from drifting back to old ways (Harry, 2000; Franco, 2001). Six SigmaTM provides a standard process and set of tools that prevents each team from designing its own problem-solving techniques thereby increasing consistency and decreasing time (Tayntor, 2003). Six SigmaTM also analyzes problems up front at the EMS design stage versus an ISO-14000 based EMS, which evaluates a problem through its corrective action tool after it has occurred. This promotes a proactive problem-solving approach as opposed to a reactive one. Often in the dash to show progress in solving a problem, companies fail to understand exactly what it is that

they are changing before they begin to implement the modification (Tayntor, 2003). Furthermore, an ISO-14000 based EMS may begin with a gap analysis to h i^ ig h t where an organization currently sits with respect to the standard. Six SigmaTM, on the other hand, also analyzes why there is a gap in the first place. This promotes identification of root causes so that appropriate solutions can be implemented. Finally, Six SigmaTM can facilitate business justification and buy in because it quantifies the cost savings associated with changes. Six SigmaTM has been criticized as being nothing new in defect prevention (Stamatis, 2000). Critics purport that Six SigmaTM is no different from TQM and systems methods, particularly in terms of its statistical tools, and this is true. Furthermore, critics state that Six SigmaTM is nothing new, just a repackaging of long-cherished quality techniques, or another quality trend that will come and go (Franco, 2001; Dalgleish, 2003). Others further say that Six SigmaTM is not necessarily suited for widespread business adoption (Tantham, 2003). However, Six SigmaTM is a business strategy for improvement; a vehicle to understand where you are in a process and where you want to be. It works to reduce process variation and should be based on the needs of a particular business (Mackertich, 2003). Hoerl and Snee further hi f lig h t the difference with Six SigmaTM in that it: · Formulizes the use o f statistical tools as oppose to having isolated individuals use them in a disconnected way · Provides an overall "road map" or multi-step approach (i.e. DMAIC) to integrate tools appropriately · Stresses the need to understand and reduce variation as oppose to estimating it

·

Puts an emphasis on a data-based approach to management versus an intuition approach

(Adapted from Hoerl and Snee, 2002) Six SigmaTM can also be criticized for the fact that it requires a lot of commitment, passion, and financial backing (Franco, 2001). However, if Six SigmaTM is already implemented in an organization, the commitment will already exist in terms of using Six SigmaTM to design an EMS. Six SigmaTM has been used by many organizations to improve business practices and financial gain. A number o f organizations.have adopted and used Six SigmaTM to complete projects in a nucber o f areas such as manufacturing, engineering, research and design, purchasing and pollution prevention (Dusharme, 2001 and 2003). However, many companies do not publicly state how they are using Six SigmaTM to improve their businesses. A review of approximately two hundred businesses, which profess to use Six SigmaTM, was completed to determine whether they were applying this method to EMS design. There was no public information available stating that any company used Six SigmaTM to design an EMS. Instead, research indicated that companies that publicly declared using Six SigmaTM were using it for individual environmental, health and safety (EHS) program improvements such as reducing injuries in the workplace, waste reduction, and streamlining EHS policies and procedures (Table 3.3). However, General Electric has used Six SigmaTM for improving EHS management systems (Mukund, 2003).

There are many reasons why companies may not publicize their application of the Six SigmaTM method to EMS design. First, the Six SigmaTM method is used in order to increase business competitiveness. If an organization publicly states how it applies the Six SigmaTM method to EMS design, competitors can easily leverage the infonnation and use it to their advantage. Many organizations may already have an EMS in place, or may be using a customer-driven approach such as ISO 14001. Perhaps organizations have not made the connection of applying the Six SigmaTM method to EMS design like they have for other processes improvements. More importantly, organizations may not realize that the environmental management process can be improved. Another reason why organizations may not use the Six SigmaTM method to design an EMS is because there is no perceived cost savings, or the focus is to complete projects that result in direct cost savings. Nonetheless, the Six SigmaTM method can be used to design an EMS because it can reduce defects or errors in the environmental management process by identifying and eliminating defects. All work is a process, all processes have variability, and all processes generate data that explains variability (Smith, 2003). Honeywell has said that it has seen dramatic results that equal or surpass those it has been in the manufacturing area when it applied the DMAIC method to nontraditional projects (Green, 2000). For example, the Six SigmaTM method can be used to address an invoicing process problem. The first step is to define the problem. The problem is that customers are receiving their invoices very late, and are therefore paying the late payment fee as well. The next step is 34

to measure the problem in terms of how many times is this occurring, and how long the cycle is from shipping the product to invoicing the customer. Once the data aie collected, the information is analyzed to identify any root causes resulting in late invoices. Once the root causes are identified, solutions are implemented to reduce the cycle time between product shipment and invoicing. Finally, controls can be put in place to ensure that customers do not receive late invoices again. Similarly, this study shows that the Six SigmaTM method can be used to design an EMS.

Chapter 4. Define Phase 4.1 Introduction The Define phase is a critical step in improving a process. However, when it comes to process improvement through other methods the step is often missed. This is because there is a tendency to rush through to the improvement stage in order to show progress, thereby failing to understand exactly what has to be improved before implementing the modification (Tayntor, 2003). For example, an organization using an ISO 14001 based EMS plans the EMS and then implements it. The Six SigmaTM method, on the other hand, will define EMS design as the opportunity, and then move on to measure how well the EMS is functioning if at all before moving to the implementation stage. This facilitates implementing solutions that will address any problems identified with environmental management as oppose to blindly implementing an EMS. There are a number o f elements involved with the Define phase. This chapter begins with a more indepth description o f the facility used for the case study, including a discussion about Six SigmaTM use in the organization. Different Six SigmaTM roles are then discussed. Then the key elements of the Define phase including the Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) characteristics''*, team charter, project plan, and process map are discussed in detail. 4.1.1 Facility Information

The facility used for the research case study, which is called "Company A", provides customer support for many various electrical and mechanical machines and devices. Service provided follows the life cycle for equipment including installations, commissioning, maintenance, refurbishing, repair, and upgrades o f all electrical and mechanical apparatus. Installation, commissioning and maintenance activities are

performed by field technical personnel and sometimes by shop floor staff. Facility processes include transformer coil repair and refurbishing in Bay 1, electrical motor repair in Bay 2, transformer repair in Bay 3, babbit-bearing repair in the machine shop, and switchgear repair in the switchgear area. The facility map is included in Appendix 1. There are approximately 50 employees, including office and shop floor staff with 2 shifts. The facility was built approximately 30 years ago with 2-3 expansions, and is approximately 46,000 square feet. It is located in an industrial zone in Ontario's "Golden Horseshoe" area. 4,1.2 The Six SigmaTM Method in the Organization

Company A is part of a very large corporation that uses the Six SigmaTM method as a way o f carrying on its business. The organization embraced the Six SigmaTM method approximately eight years ago. A large-scale transformation occurred with millions of dollars spent on Six SigmaTM training. There was also a challenge to each senior manager from the top o f the corporation to implement the Six SigmaTM method. As a result, most employees completed Six SigmaTM training and completed projects as a part of their j o b ' T h e corporation has reportedly saved in excess of five billion dollars since implementing the Six SigmaTM method over six years (Table 4.1). Table 4.1: Six SigmaTM Cost Savings Total Cost Savings (in Billions of Year DoUars) 0.2 1996 1 1997 1.3 1998 2 1999 NA 2000 1.5 2001 (Adapted from isixsigma.com, 2003)

In fact, completion o f Six SigmaTM projects was mandatory for career advancement in this organization.

37

At Company A, most if not all of the staff have completed Six SigmaTM training. Most salary staff completed a two-week training course delivered from within the organization. Hourly staff completed "on-the-job" training, which was a condensed version o f the two-week course. The training typically included the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control (DMAIC) phases, alth o u ^ some individuals may have completed Design for Six SigmaTM (DFSS) training as well. Working with a facility that used the Six SigmaTM method in its everyday business processes facilitated completion of the case study. Thus, using the Six SigmaTM method in an untrained organization would result in a large commitment of resources in terms o f time and money, a commitment that would have to come from the most senior person in the organization. 4.1.3 Six SigmaTM Roles

In order to support the Six SigmaTM method in an organization, personnel may assume a number o f Six SigmaTM roles in the process. The different roles include the Master Black Belt, Black Belt, Green Belt, and Champion/Sponsor. The Master Black Belt role acts as a coach and mentor or consultant to Black Belts working on a variety o f projects (Harry, 2000; Pande and Holpp, 2002). The person is also a "change agent", helping to promote Six SigmaTM solutions. Another role the Master Black Belt may play is Six SigmaTM trainer, as well as customer advocate (Pande and Holpp, 2002). Due to the nature of the Master Black Belt role, personnel who have this position are experts in the analytical tools used, and often have an engineering or science background with an advanced business degree (Pande and Holpp, 2002). Personnel also have to have intimate knowledge about how the business works. The Master Black Belt for Company A was located at the most senior business level in the

38

corporation at a different location from Company A. This individual was a senior quality manager who served as a coach and mentor to the Black Belts as well as a customer advocate, and therefore was not involved in the day-to-day business at the facility level. The Black Belt role is perhaps the most critical role in Six SigmaTM. The individual who assumes this role must have a number of different skills including: · · · · · · · Problem-solving Collecting and analyzing data Organizational diplomacy Leadership Coaching and mentoring Administration Project management

(Adapted from Harry, 2000; Pande and Holpp, 2002) These skills are critical because it is usually the Black Belt who mobilizes the project team, promoting change opportunities and driving results. In short, the Black Belt is a change agent. Very often personnel who assume Black Belt roles have a high chance of promotion into other career opportunities as well. Company A had a Black Belt located at the business level. Because most if not all employees had Six SigmaTM training and experience, the Black Belt role in this case was more of a support role for Green Belts, and it provided an opportunity to work closely with customers on larger, long-range projects to improve business viability. The Green Belt role is basically someone who is trained in Six SigmaTM skills, most often to the same level as the Black Belt. The key difference, however, is that the Green Belt continues to do his or her regular job, and completes Six SigmaTM projects as 39 ht

part of his or her job (Eckes 2001 ; Harry 2000; Pande and Holpp, 2002). The Green Belt role is crucial because it is personnel in this role who bring the Six SigmaTM method and tools to the day-to-day business activities. As previously mentioned, most if not all of the employees at Company A were Green Belts. Another critical role in addition to the Master Belt and Black Belt is the Champion or Sponsor. This person is usually in a senior management role at the local level, and his or her participation sends a very strong message o f commitment. The Champion/Sponsor has a very personal interest in the projects because this person is ultimately accountable. As Pande and Holpp state, the Champion/Sponsor has the following responsibilities: · Ensure that projects stay aligned with overall business goals and provide direction when they do not · Keep other members of the leadership team informed on the progress of projects · Provide or cajole needed resources, such as time, money, and help from others, for the team · Conduct the DMAIC tollgate reviews to ensure that each step in the DMAIC process is completed · Negotiate conflicts, overlaps, and linkages with other Six SigmaTM projects (Adapted from Pande and Holpp, 2002) The Champion at Company A was the Service Centre Manager. This was beneficial because this person was involved with the whole EMS design process, which resulted in an increase in the Service Centre Manager's awareness of environmental management 40

and issues, as well as his accountability in managing the environmental risks of the facility. Defining the different Six SigmaTM roles was important because a basic premise o f Six SigmaTM is that it is not one person who starts and manages the project once it is completed, but that project solutions are infused into day-to-day business operations for everyone's use. 4.2 Define Phase 4.2,1 Identifying the Project

One key component of Six SigmaTM is the focus on the customer (Pande and Holpp, 2002). Therefore, the first question asked was who were Company A 's customers or stakeholders with regards to environmental management. It was decided that there were a number of key stakeholders. The primary key stakeholders were the customers themselves. Environmental management was critical for Company A because it deals with a number of environmentally sensitive materials such as asbestos found in old motors to be repaired and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from transformer oil for example. Therefore, customers want to ensure that there are sound practices in place to prevent any environmental incidents from occurring, especially since it is their equipment that is being repaired. In fact, many of Company A's customers requested information on their health and safety program as part of the job bidding process. Another key stakeholder was the parent company or coiporation itself because there was an expressed commitment to meet environmental regulatory requirements through its environmental, health and safety (EHS) policy, demonstrate due diligence, and avoid negative media publicity should it be subject to regulatory action.

The government was also identified as a key stakeholder since it establishes the requirements and criteria by which industrial facilities have to comply. Another identified stakeholder group was comprised of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as they have a primary interest in protecting the environment for all citizens. Neighbours, including industrial, con.mercial and residential, were also identified as stakeholders, as any environmental upset could have impacted on their health, use and enjoyment o f property*^. Shareholders were also identified as stakeholders as negative events or publicity could result in a drop in share price (Bosch et al, 1996).*^ Finally, Company A employees were identified as stakeholders as many were residents o f the community, and employees did not want harm the environment. Once the key stakeholders were identified, the next step was to determine who in the company represented the voice o f the customer. It was decided that the Service Centre Manager represented the voice o f the customer because he was ultimately accountable for meeting both business and customer requirements. The Service Centre Manager also felt that he was ultimately responsible for the company's environmental performance and therefore became the Champion/Sponsor o f the research project. One important comment fi-om the Champion was that he saw an EMS as part o f the overall business management system.

The idea o f impact on health and use and enjoyment o f property comes from the definition o f an adverse effect in the Ontario Environmental Protection Act (EPA). Sections 6 and 14 o f the EPA include general prohibitions against creating an adverse effect in the natural environment. ' Company A is part o f publicly traded U.S. Corporation. Bosch et al completed a study that concluded that there is a definite negative market response to the announcement that an organization has attracted the attention o f the U.S. EPA (Bosch et al, 1996).

The next question was whether there was anyone else who had a stake in ensuring effective environmental management. Senior managers. Business Leaders, Executives, Directors and Officers were identified'^. Once the Champion was identified for the project, he was asked what he believed was critical to environmental management. Responses included spill prevention, proper storage of chemicals, legacy issues, monitoring o f discharges, air emissions, metal recycling, and hazardous chemical substitution. He also stated that he would like to see an EMS save the company money. It was also important to see who else in the company was able to define environmental issues. A review o f the company's organizational chart (Figure 4.1) and discussions with company personnel indicated that people knowledgeable about facility processes such as the Lead Hand and experienced employees could provide valuable information. Personnel who completed environmental activities on a day-to-day basis were also identified as important contacts. This included the company EHS representative and the business level EHS Manager. Support functions such as the Shipper/Receiver and the Purchaser were identified as important contacts as they worked and managed a lot o f paperwork that fell under the environmental regulatory area such waste manifests, bills o f lading for dangerous goods, and service records for refrigerated equipment.

Directors and Officers can be directly charged for any contravention o f environmental requirements (Torys LLP, 2003).

The next step was to identify what the current environmental management business strategy was for Company A. When asked whether the company had an EMS, the Champion did not know. Therefore, it was also important to determine what existing environmental data was on-site. It was at the Define phase that the team had to determine whether there was an existing process to be improved or the absence o f a process altogether. If it were a process that needed to be improved, the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) process would be used. If there was no process, the Define, Measure, Analyze, Design and Verify (DMADV) process from the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS)'® method would have to be used. A preliminary review o f company data revealed the following information: · Monthly EHS communication took place through employee meetings and postings on employee bulletin boards · Employees completed EHS Culture training

Design for Six SigmaTM (DFSS) is used when a process does not exist and needs to be designed, or when an existing process has been optimized and cannot be improved any further without re-designing the process (Chowdhury, 2003).

Based on data obtained during the preliminary review, it was agreed that there was some evidence o f an EHS system. Therefore the team agreed that the DMAIC process would be used to improve upon the company's EMS. Closer review of the data, however, indicated that it primarily focused on health and safety requirements with a minimal focus on environmental management. For example, the information posted on the employee board was related to accident prevention. Business goals posted on the shop floor just indicated, "zero accidents". Therefore, another factor to determine through the study was whether environmental management was a priority or if there was just a lack of knowledge regarding environmental requirements. The DMAIC approach facilitated answering this question. 4.2.2 Team Charter

The next step was to complete the team charter, which is shown in Table 4.2 below. 45

The team charter was a critical tool in the Define phase because it included information such as the business case for the project, the problem/opportunity statement, project scope, goals and objectives of the project, project constraints, required resources, project milestones, and roles and responsibilities of the team members (Eckes, 2001; Pande and Holpp, 2002). The business case described what impact the project would have on the business. For example, why was the project worth doing? What were the consequences of not doing the project? How did it fit in with business initiatives and targets? This tied back to the identified stakeholders and why it was important to meet their requirements. In the case o f Company A, completion o f the project would increase market competitiveness by

47

demonstrating to stakeholders a proactive approach in managing environmental activities. The project was also worth completing in order to determine if regulatory and corporate environmental requirements were being met. Consequences of not doing the project were identified as potential environmental orders, fines, and corporate scrutiny. Finally, the project fitted into the business goal of "zero" notices of violations. Designing an EMS was a business tool completed to help meet this goal. Once die business case was completed, the Opportunity Statement was developed. The word "opportunity" was used instead of "problem" since it was not known at the time if there was an existing problem. The opportunity statement described what needed to be improved. The opportunity statement was the research study question applying Six SigmaTM to EMS design. The project scope established the project boundaries. This was an important step because it served as a reference point for the project to ensure that the project was not moving out of its established boundaries. The project boundaries were as follows: · · · Work processes in Company A's facility Non-inclusion of field work activities Non-inclusion of different companies located in the same building including an installation and field services company and an oil testing lab · Focus on environmental management only and not occupational health and safety management The goal and objectives of the project were then designed. The study purpose and objectives were used as the project goals and objectives with some additional objective o f determining what improvements, if any, need to be made to the EMS to meet environmental regulatory and coiporate requirements. The goal of the project was to

48

determine whether the Six SigmaTM method could be applied to EMS design. Objectives of the project included: « The applicability, benefits, strengths, weaknesses and limitations associated with using Six SigmaTM method for EMS design · If a Roadmap that includes problem-solving, measurement, and cost reduction tools could be developed for subsequent use in EMS design · If Six SigmaTM provides a systematic and consistent method for organizations to design an EMS . It was important to define at the start what the project constraints were and the resources required. This served two purposes. First, identifying project constraints forced a realistic view of how and when the project could be completed. Second, it allowed for the identification of resources, which included human resources, electronic resources, workspace, time, and money. Project work had to take place through a series of facility visits, e-mail and phone communication. Also, project steps had to be completed in an organized and planned fashion as all team members had their own regular full-time jobs to do and not much time to spare. A workspace was required and established for the author when facility visits were completed. Access to existing on-line resources and tools was necessary to identify current tools that the corporation was using. Finally, it was acknowledged that there might be some expenses in order to make improvements. Project milestones were then completed. A basic principle of Six SigmaTM is not to address broad issue. Therefore, the project had to be scoped to enable completion within four to six months, with half of the time spent on the Define m à Measure phases and the other half spent on completing ûie Analyze, Improve and Control phases (Eckes,

49

R eo r o d u ce d with Derm ission of th e coDvriaht ow ner. Further reproduction prohibited without p erm ission .

2001 ; Pande and Holpp, 2002). Furthermore, the Control phase often takes place after the team has disbanded since solutions should be operationalized at this point (Eckes, 2001). Therefore, a project plan was designed identifying what steps in the DMAIC process would be completed and when. Finally, roles and responsibilities were defined for the team members. It was important to include people who would have the most impact on the project (Eckes, 2001). Therefore, the Champion/Sponsor of the project was the Service Centre Manager, who was responsible for facilitating project completion and ensuring that solutions for areas o f improvements were implemented. The Champion was also responsible to ensure that all the necessary information for project completion was available such as access to environmental documents, personnel, and on-line information. The author o f the study assumed the role o f Green Belt and/or team leader. This facilitated operationalization of project solutions such as the development of tools to assist with day-to-day environmental management activities. This also resulted in the Green Belt assuming the role of recommendation versus implementation. Company personnel were tasked with implementation responsibilities. The Black Belt was the company's existing Black Belt, and was only consulted when any analytical-type questions arose. Other members of the team included the company EHS representative, who provided environmental documentation, explained the role of the company EHS representative, and was responsible for ensuring that the solutions designed would be implemented. The business level EHS Manager was also a member of the team, and provided information regarding environmental corporate requirements. The Lead hand provided detailed process information, and the Shipper/Receiver and Purchaser provided requested information.

4.2.3

High Level Process Mapping

Once the existing environmental management process was reviewed and the project team was established, it was agreed that the team had to gain a basic understanding o f the facility's processes. Therefore, a high-level process map was completed (Figure 4.2). This enabled team members to have the same picture of the process and to work from the same assumptions (Pande and Holpp, 2002). This also allowed the team to connect stakeholders to the process, which occurred at all stages of the process, namely the input, process and outputs stages for the reasons previously described in section 4.2.1 above.

Chapter 5. M easure Phase

5.1

Introduction The purpose of the Measure phase was to determine current process performance,

and to quantify process defects (Waddick, 2003). The Measure phase is where a practical problem is converted into a statistical problem. As Pande and Holpp assert, the Measure phase has two main objectives; 1. To gather data to validate and to quantify the problem/opportunity. 2. To begin teasing out facts and numbers that offer clues about the causes of the problem. (Adapted from Pande and Holpp, 2002) This chapter starts with a review of the CTQ characteristic for the project, and then follows with a review of the detailed process maps for the facility. The discussion then covers process performance standards, the type o f data to collect to determine process capability, the data collection process, measurement system analysis, and measurement system results. 5.2 Project CTQ Selection The purpose of the selecting a project CTQ was to allow the team to focus on what to Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control. Sometimes tools such as the Quality Function Deployment (QFD)^' could be used to accomplish this task. The purpose o f the QFD was to take customer requirements and translate them into detailed company requirements to ensure that customer requirements were met (Pyzdek, 2002). However, this tool was not used for this determination because the team was able to determine what

The Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tool is used to identify and quantify customers' requirements, and translate them into key critical parameters. It is used to prioritize actions to improve a process in order to meet customers' expectations.

the project CTQ was with the information provided from the Define phase, and the detailed process mapping exercise described below. It was determined that the single criterion project CTQ was whether the facility was meeting all of its environmental regulatory and corporate requirements. This was chosen as a starting point in order to ensure that the company was meeting all its basic requirements before considering any improvement initiatives. Developing an EMS was a way to manage increasingly complex environmental issues (University of North Carolina, 2003). A company must have environmental compliance under control before it can focus on a higher level o f environmental performance (Ibbotson and Phyper, 1996). This decision was especially important for the Champion, as he was accountable for the facility being the Service Centre Manager. 5.3 Detailed Process Mapping In order to effectively make a positive change, the team needed to understand how processes worked at the facility. It was also important to see at which stages there was interaction with the environment and how stakeholders were connected to or affected by these processes. Therefore, the team agreed that the best tool to use to obtain details regarding environmental interactions were detailed process maps for each work area based on the high-level facility process map designed in the Define phase.

A process map was designed for the transformer winding area (Bay 1), the electric motor repair area (Bay 2), the transformer repair area (Bay 3), the machine shop area, and the switchgear area. Once the steps o f each work process were documented, all the inputs and outputs of the steps were added.

Bay 1 - Transformer Winding Area The process begins with transformer coil cylinders. An insulation package, which consists of paper or enamel and copper wire, is applied using a key splicer and pressboard. Electricity, compressed air, glue and tape are also used to complete the installation. The coil is then either wound horizontally or vertically by gravity. The coil can also be "reversed engineered" in order to determine the correct wind pattern. Once winding is completed, the coil is removed from the winding equipment and clamped. Scrap copper and excess insulation are generated. Scrap copper is sent to a scrap metal dealer, and the insulation is reused or recycled. The coil is then undamped and put into the oven for drying. If it is a coil patch or repair then oil mist may be emitted from the oven as an emission. After the coil has dried, it is removed from the oven after cooling and re-clamped. If the coil is to be put back into the transformer at the customer site, the coil is wrapped with kraft paper, crated if required, and sent out for on-site installation. This process generates excess paper that is reused or recycled, and wood that is reused for

other crating operations. If the transformer is on-site, coil installation takes place inhouse. For in-house installations, the coil is assembled in the transformer after re clamping. This process involves using PF degreaser and rags to remove any excess oil precipitate. The used rags are then collected and disposed of as hazardous waste. The coil connections are then completed using new cables, which consist o f copper wire and paper or enamel insulation. Fifteen percent silver solder is used to complete minor welds to form the connections. PF degreaser and rags are also used to remove any excess oil precipitate. Waste copper wire is recycled, and excess insulation is either reused or recycled. Used rags are collected and disposed of as hazardous waste. Any excess solder is reused, and welding fumes are emitted as fugitive emissions. The unit is then tanked, and if this is a repair there might be oil mist air emissions due to oil being present in the transformer. If it is a new installation, the vacuum filling process or hot oil fill process is completed where new transformer oil or recycled transformer oil, fi'om five outdoor double-walled aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), is put into the transformer assembly. Any excess oil is sent for recycling for later use. This process has the potential for oil spills during line hook up changes. Spent oil absorbent and/or oil-soaked rags are also disposed o f as hazardous waste. Once vacuum filling is completed, the transformer unit goes through high-voltage electrical testing. Once completed, the unit is painted at the paint booth area. This process generates air emissions of volatile organic compounds and waste paint, which is shipped off-site as hazardous waste. Spent paint booth filters are disposed of as hazardous waste. Plastic, wood,-steel and threaded rods are used to prepare the unit for shipment. The welding process generates fugitive emissions. The transformer unit is then shipped back to the customer (Figure 5.2).

Bay 2 - Electric Motor Repair Electric motors are typically received in plastic and on wooden skidding. The wood is reused for packaging and the plastic is discarded in the regular garbage. An oxyacetylene torch method is then used to dismantle the motor. Heated grease from the dismantling process is cooled and disposed of in the regular garbage. The motor is then subject to electrical testing. The dismantled housing is then cleaned with a number of varying techniques that include blasting with frozen carbon dioxide ("dry ice") and water, or acetone and rags, or PF degreaser and rags, or varsol in a parts washer for smaller parts. This step generates wastewater that is discharged to the sanitary sewer, as well as noise, hazardous waste including waste acetone, PF degreaser or varsol, dust collector material, and small pieces o f paint chips, grease and dirt that are swept and disposed o f in the regular garbage. Sanitary effluent is treated through a three-stage oil/water interceptor water treatment process before discharging to the sanitary sewer.

57

The repair process is then divided into a major or minor repair. For major repairs, the next step is a more intense and detailed cleaning of the unit. The unit is stripped with a ceramic fiber, and sent to the bum-off oven. Air emissions are generated from the burning o f the grease, and stripping chemicals used in the previous step. After the bumoff oven, various parts may be subject to further water blasting, carbon dioxide blasting ("dry ice"), sandblasting, glass bead blasting, or grinding, as well as sawing. Again, these steps generate wastewater that contain small amounts of particulate including sand and glass that is discharged to the sanitary sewer, as well as noise, hazardous waste including waste acetone, PF degreaser or varsol, dust collector material, and small pieces of paint chips, grease and dirt that are swept and disposed of in the regular garbage. Asbestos may be stripped fi-om the windings, and removal is completed in a controlled way as per the facility's asbestos program. Waste asbestos is placed in a rigid, impermeable, sealed container, labeled and disposed of by an approved waste hauler. Copper-mica dust and copper grind waste are generated fi-om cleaning the armature. Copper-mica dust and glass dust is disposed of in the regular garbage. Copper grinds are also recycled. The unit is then repaired using an epoxy resin mixture, and copper,'fiberglass cable connections are made and connected to the armature by silver solder. The waste epoxy resin mixture is disposed as hazardous waste. Scrap copper is recycled, and fugitive emissions are generated from the welding solder. The unit then undergoes electrical testing, and is put into a vacuum pressure impregnated (VPI) tanlc with vamish. Opening the lid of the tank releases varnish fumes as fugitive emissions. The VPI step ensures that vamish reaches all the crevices o f the motor unit, as it acts as an insulation barrier and therefore increases electrical conducti-vity o f the unit. Once the VPI step is completed, a large plastic sheet is placed

58

on the ground to capture any vamish drippings when the motor unit is removed from the tank. Vamish fumes are again released as fugitive emissions in the shop. The plastic sheet is then disposed of in the garbage. Vamish is changed out on a periodic basis and disposed o f as hazardous waste. The motor is then placed in an electrical oven for baking. The baking process generates air emissions that include vamish and resiglass from the insulation. Once cooled, the excess vamish is removed by light grinding, and vamish chips are disposed of in the regular garbage. The unit is then electrically tested, and parts of the motor unit are painted at the paint booth. Waste paint and waste xylene from cleaning the paint gun are generated and disposed of as hazardous waste. Used paint filters are disposed of as hazardous waste. Parts from the unit are then assembled using grease or motor oil, and polished using carbon sandpaper. Waste grease and used sandpaper are disposed of in the regular garbage, and oil-soaked rags are disposed of as hazardous waste. The unit is then electrically tested again, and its exterior painted. Again, waste paint and waste xylene from cleaning the paint gun are generated and disposed of as hazardous waste. Used paint filters are disposed of as hazardous waste. Vapour barrier paper, wood crates, and stock are placed around the motor, and it is shipped to the customer. Excess paper and wood is reused as packaging material, and scrap pieces of paper are disposed of in the regular garbage. With a minor repair, the unit is stripped using abrasive disks, and used abrasive disks; paint chips, and dust are swept up and disposed in the regular garbage. The minor repair process then follows the same testing, VPI, baking, painting, assembly, testing, and shipping steps as outlined above (Figure 5.3).

Bav 3 - Transformer Repair Area Transformers that come into the shop for repair follow the same initial flow as electric motors in that they are received, dismantled, tested and cleaned. Once the transformer is received, transformer oil and rags are used to dismantle and evacuating the unit. This step also poses the risk of spill. Fugitive emissions such as oil fumes are generated from disconnecting and evacuating the unit. Waste oil is also generated and sent out for recycling. This oil is then put back into the transformer. Finally, oil-soaked rags, gloves and absorbent are disposed of as hazardous waste. The transformer is then electrically tested, and cleaned with solvents and/or thinners as such PF degreaser, and sandpaper. Waste solvent and rags are disposed of as hazardous waste, and used sandpaper is reused if possible or discarded in the regular garbage. The process then splits into a major or minor repair. Major repairs tie into the transformer coil winding process as previously discussed in the Bay 1 area. For minor repairs, the next step is to

put the unit into the dry-out oven. This step generates oil vapour that is emitted to the outside air. The unit is then re-assembled and silver solder is used to complete minor welds to form the connections. Any excess solder is reused, and welding fumes are emitted as fugitive emissions. The unit is then painted at the paint booth area. This process generates air emissions such as volatile organic compounds as well as waste paint, which is shipped off-site as hazardous waste. Spent paint booth filters are disposed of as hazardous waste. Vacuum oil filling or hot oil fill is then completed where new

transformer oil or recycled transformer oil, from five outdoor double-walled ASTs, is put into the transformer assembly. Any excess oil is recycled for later use. This process has the potential for oil spills during line hook up changes. There is also the potential for a spill when an outside contractor is refilling the ASTs. Spent oil absorbent and/or oilsoaked rags are also disposed of as hazardous waste. Once vacuum filling is completed, the transformer unit goes through high-voltage electrical testing. Plastic, wood, steel and threaded rods are used to prepare the unit for shipment. The welding process generates fugitive emissions. Once completed, the transformer unit is then sent back to the customer (Figure 5.4).

Babbit Bearing Machine Shop Area The incoming inspection step determines whether a major or minor repair is needed for the babbit bearing. If a major repair is required (Figure 5.5), the next step is to melt the bearing using an oxy-acetylene torque process. This step generates scrap metal, pieces o f resiglass and fugitive emissions from the welding process. The scrap metal is recycled, and the resiglass is disposed of in the garbage. Next the bearing is placed in the Kolene salt bath machine, and is furtlier cleaned with steel shot in the Vibra Finish machine or with glass bead blasting. Wastewater from the Kolene machine is discharged to the sanitary sewer. The steel shot and glass bead are reused. The bearing then goes th ro n g the spinning or "tinning" process. First, Hydro-Perm is used to plug any holes then Fiber Fax and Garlock (non-asbestos high temperature insulation) is applied to the bearing. Tin-Rite or tin sticks are heated and then applied to the bearing through spinning. Fugitive emissions result from the tin being heated. Waste HydroPerm and Fiber Fax dust are swept up and disposed of in the regular garbage. The bearing is then dipped into the babbit pot oven, which consists of liquid tin babbit at 900 62

degrees Celsius. Again, fugitive emissions are generated from the heated tin. The bearing is then spun into shape on the Spin Cast, machine and simultaneously cooled with water. Smoke is released as a fugitive emiss. and are discharged to the sanitary sewer. The . ano . ater leaks flow to an area drain goes through the splitting process

where the bearing is split into two. Once again, Hydro-Perm is used to plug any holes then Fiber Fax and Garlock (non-asbestos high temperature insulation) is applied to the bearing. Tin-Rite or tin sticks are heated and then applied to the bearing. Fugitive emissions from the tin being heated are generated. Waste Hydro-Perm and Fiber Fax dust are swept up and disposed of in the regular garbage. The bearing then goes through the "proof' machining stage where babbit crap is generated and collected for recycling. The bearing is then tested with an ultrasound machine. The bearing then undergoes final machining, final inspection, and is then shipped to the customer. Final machining generates babbit scrap that is collected for recycling. The bearings are shipped in wooden crates with Styrofoam packing. Waste Styrofoam is disposed of in the regular garbage.

If the bearing undergoes a minor repair, the first step is to skim the bearing. This results in the removal of scrap lead or tin babbit that is collected and recycled. The bearing is then tested with an ultrasound machine. The next step is to complete a Tig repair. This is where lead or tin babbit is applied to the bearing by welding with oxyacetylene or argon. Welding fumes are generated as a fugitive emission as a result. The bearing is then put on a machine lathe where cutting oil is used to shape it. Scrap metal is collected and recycled, and spent cutting oil is disposed of as hazardous waste. The bearing is then tested again with an ultrasound machine. The bearing then undergoes final machining, final inspection, and is then shipped to the customer. Final machining generates babbit scrap that is collected for recycling. The bearings are shipped in wooden crates with Styrofoam packing. Waste Styrofoam is disposed o f in the regular garbage (Figure 5.6).

may be present in the switchgear unit depending on its age. The asbestos is stripped from the windings, and is completed in a controlled way as per the facility's asbestos program. Waste asbestos is placed in a rigid, impermeable, sealed container, labeled and disposed of by an approved waste hauler. Soap, water and Scotch Rite pads are then used to clean the unit. Used pads and waste Fiber Finish are disposed of in the regular garbage. Wastewater is discharged to the sanitary sewer. The unit is then spray painted, reassembled and electrically tested. Volatile organic compounds are emitted as fugitive emissions, and waste paint residue from the spray cans is shipped off-site as hazardous waste. The spray cans are then recycled. Re-assembly may involve installing insulation that contains asbestos. The asbestos-containing insulation is applied in a controlled way as per the facility's asbestos program. Waste asbestos is placed in a rigid, impermeable, sealed container, labeled and disposed of by an approved waste hauler. The switchgear unit is then packaged in wooden crates and shipped to the customer (Figure 5.7). Figure 5.7: Switchgear Repair Area Process Map Receiving Inspection Dismantling

outdoors on an asphalt and/or concrete pad surface. These activities result in the generation of waste paint chips, sand, rust, copper, and insulation, which are swept up and disposed of in the garbage. Scrap copper is recycled. Wastewater discharge is discharged to the storm sewer, and small particles of waste debris remain on the pavement, blow away, or are washed into the storm sewer. There is also an empty PCB storage facility that is registered with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MCE). The storage facility housed PCB-contaminated soils and transformer tanks at one time, but an approved company removed them for destruction over a ten-year period approximately. The storage facility is still listed as active in the MCE records. 5.4 Process Performance Standard Once the detailed process maps were completed it was important to define the performance standard o f the current EMS process. As previously stated, the project CTQ was defined as ensuring that Company A was meeting all applicable regulatory and corporate environmental requirements. By doing this, the company was maintaining market competitiveness by ensuring that it was meeting its stakeholder requirements. The next term that was defined was a "defect". A defect is defined as any event that does not meet a stakeholder requirement (Eckes, 2001). The purpose of the defect definition was to remove ambiguity so that all team members had the same understanding, as well as identifying what to measure and how to measure a defect characteristic. In terms o f the study, a defect was defined as any environmental requirements that were not being met. This definition was important as it helped to determine the type of data to collect, and how to go about collecting those data.

5.5

Types of Data to Measure Process Capability One o f the most important concepts for data collection was the type o f data to

collect namely continuous or discrete data. Each type o f data serves different purposes and allows different results to be obtained. A measurement scale represents continuous data where data can be continuously divided into finer and finer increments of precision (Pyzdek, 2002). This is the type of data needed to apply the concept of normal distribution, and therefore is the preferred data to collect in order to reach Six SigmaTM in a process. Discrete data, on the other hand, represent an attribute or variable type of measurement and can be used with limitations (Pyzdek, 2002). The biggest limitation is that discrete data can only be used to reach a three or four sigma level. Continuous data are required to obtain a higher sigma score. Regardless of the limitations with discrete data, the team decided that it would collect discrete data in the form of count data. As the name suggests, count data are obtained through counting. Count data were selected to determine whether environmental requirements were being met at this point as opposed to determining the extent to which environmental requirements were being met. For example when measuring a process, discrete data would represent the presence or absence of a requirement, whereas continuous data would measure the percentage that something is complete (Pyzdek, 2002). A logical next step in assessing the company's EMS would be to collect continuous data in the form of the percent completion of environmental requirements. 5.6 Data Collection Process Once the types of data to collect was determined, the team had to determine how to collect count data from the information obtained about the company's environmental

67

aspects and existing documentation, as well as refine the defect definition and other definitions. The team decided to design a checklist that contained applicable regulatory and corporate environmental requirements, as this was seen as the most logical way to obtain data (Table 5.1). Therefore the project Green Belt, with the assistance of business EHS resources, completed a review of all federal, provincial, municipal environmental laws and by-laws, and corporate requirements in order to determine applicable laws and requirements based on the environmental aspects identified through the detailed process map exercise. Access to federal and provincial environmental acts and regulations was obtained through the company's subscription to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety's (CCOHS) website of environmental, health and safety legislation. Municipal by-law requirements were obtained from the Halton Region and City of Burlington websites. Corporate requirements were obtained from tire company's internal website, as well as fi-om the Champion and the business level EHS Manager. The definition o f a defect was then further refined to be any checklist question that resulted in a "no" answer. A "no" answer could result fi-om not having a process in place or from not having any evidence to demonstrate that a process was in place to address an environmental requirement. In order to determine the total number of defects, other definitions had to be designed. The main definitions involved with discrete data include defect, unit and opportunity. The definition of a defect was previously determined. A unit is any item that can be measured or evaluated against predetermined criteria or standards. Therefore, for the purposes of the study a unit was defined as each question from the checklist. An opportunity is defined as any step in a process where a defect can be produced. Hence, an opportunity was defined as any question fi-om the checklist where the answer could indicate that an environmental requirement was not

68

being met. Having the defect, unit and opportunity terms defined helped to determine a current sigma score for the existing EMS process later on in the project. 5.7 Measurement System Analysis Once the measurement system was selected, it was analyzed to determine its effectiveness since decisions would be based on data obtained from the measurement system. Therefore, the measurement system analysis stage was critical to the project. There are two ways a measurement system can be biased. First, a measurement system can result in data that are precise but not accurate. For example, the data collected from the checklist could be precise in that the person completing the checklist can answer all the questions from the information provided, but if the questions did not include applicable regulations, or included non-applicable questions the data collected would not be accurate. Additionally, the data would not be accurate if questions were not worded in such a way as to clearly determine whether or not a requirement had been met. Therefore, it was imperative for the team to design a checklist that would minimize collecting inaccurate or imprecise information. Taking all requirements and putting them into a question format, as well as having the project Green Belt complete the checklist helped to achieve this. For example, if the requirement was to have an up-to-date documented air emissions inventory maintained on file, then the question was worded "is an up-to-date documented air emissions inventory maintained on file?" Checklist questions were grouped by media, namely air, water, waste, emergency response, and chemical reporting. Once the measurement analysis was completed, the project Green Belt visited the facility in order to complete the Measure Phase Checklist. Table 5.1 below shows the completed Measure Phase Checklist. p^nriTV'''69

M easurem ent Results Once the Measure Phase Checklist was completed, the total number of defects

was determined. All defects were rated at the same value. Defects were not weighted based on a comparison with different environmental media, since the Analyze phase of the project would be used to determine causes of defects, as well as prioritizing those causes in order to implement solutions. The sigma value for the existing EMS process was calculated using a Process Sigma Calculator from the isixsigma.com website as listed in Figure 5.8 below.

The EMS process did not achieve a six sigma level, which can also be expressed as a 99.99966% compliance rate with environmental requirements. Therefore, the EMS process needed to be improved. It is important to note that the Measure Phase Checklist was used as a tool to determine how effective the EMS system was prior to making any improvements. The tool itself was not an improvement tool at this point of the study. 5.9 Measure Phase ToUgate Checklist After determining the environmental requirements and the process sigma score, a Measure Phase Tollgate Checklist (Table 5.3) was completed. This was to ensure that all steps in the Measure phase were completed, before moving to the Analyze phase.

Chapter 6. A nalyze Phase

6.1

Introduction The Analyze phase is often overlooked in the attempt to quickly implement a

solution once a gap has been identified. Using the Six SigmaTM method forces teams to analyze why a defect has occurred before identifying and implementing any solutions (Trayntor, 2003). This helps to ensure that the appropriate solutions are implemented, solutions that will address the cause(s) of defects. Therefore, the purpose of the Analyze phase was for the team to determine the root causes of effects, and to prioritize them. Tliis chapter reviews the analysis of measurement results, performance improvement goals, hypothesis testing, as well as a discussion of tools used in fu s phase including graphs, a Pareto chart, the Cause and Effect Diagram^^, and the Payoff Matrix^^. 6.2 Analysis of Measurement Results A number of tools were used in order to analyze the results from the measurement phase of the project. The first tool that was used was a bar graph (Figure 6.1).

The Cause and Effect diagram allows a team to identify and graphically display all o f the possible causes related to a problem or condition in order to determine its root cause(s) (Brassard and Ritter, 1994). The Payoff Matrix is a tool used to narrow down options using a systematic approach to compare choices by selecting and weighting selected criteria (Brassard and Ritter, 1994),

environmental requirements instead of simply acting on the first cause identified (Wlodarczyk et al, 2000). The Cause and Effect Diagram was structured using the categories material, methods, machines, and people (Pande and Holpp, 2002). Each category is defined in Table 6.1 below.

Materials:

Methods: Machines: People:

The data, instructions, numbers or facts, forms, and files that, if flawed, will have a negative impact on the output (or the environment) The procedures or techniques used in doing the work (or maintaining the EMS system) The technology, such as computers, copier, or manufacturing equipment, used in a work process A key variable in how all these other elements combine to produce business results (or EMS results)

A review o f the data from the Define and Measure phases, as well as the brainstorming *ichnique^'^ were used to list causes on the Cause and Effect diagram. The brainstorming teclmique is a lateral thinking process that is designed to help break out of current thinking patterns and into new ways of looking at things (Brassard and Ritter, 1994). Brainstorming allowed a number of potential root causes to be identified under each of the categories on the Cause and Effect diagram listed in Figure 6.3 below. Group brainstorming was beneficial as it allowed for the development of ideas with more depth than achieved by individual brainstorming. A broad range of ideas was also generated as the team represented a wide range of disciplines including EHS, senior management, shop floor process and supervision, purchasing, and shipping/receiving. A number of root causes were identified using the Cause and Effect diagram.

The brainstorming technique is a common method for a team to generate a number o f ideas on any topic by creating a process that is free o f criticism and judgement (Brassard and Ritter, 1994).

Under the materials category, the team stated that one of the reasons the facility was not meeting environmental requirements was because they were not clearly identified. This may have been a result of the corporate EHS office focusing on U.S. environmental requirements since it was a U.S. based company. Instead of understanding applicable Canadian requirements, corporate EHS personnel just reportedly imposed U.S. requirements on the facility. This did not help in meeting specific Canadian and Ontario environmental requirements to which the facility is subject. Finally, the team determined that the current focus of EHS metrics on health and safety criteria led to the omission of environmental criteria. In terms o f the methods category, the team highlighted that there was a lack of

the EMS such as charts and tables. Furthermore, the team stated that there was a lack of systematic follow-up to ensure that activities listed in procedures, for example, were completed. Another weak area identified was the lack of environmental reporting and update requirements included in the EHS manual or other tools like the facility's EHS

Compliance Calendar. Finally, the team identified the poor filing system for EMS documentation. For example, some team members were absolutely sure that some documents requested during the Measure phase assessment were completed, but some of the questions in the Measure Phase Checklist were marked "No" because the records could not be located. The team indicated that current and available computerized tools in the facility were not being utilized to incorporate environmental requirements, such as the EH8 Compliance Calendar previously mentioned. The lack of connection between preventative maintenance (PM) activities and regulatory required activities was identified. A number of root causes were identified under the people category, but most appeared to be related. For example, there was the lack of knowledge regarding regulatory environmental requirements because there was a lack of training regarding them. Also, activities and duties required to meet environmental requirements were not identified in job descriptions. It was determined that there was a lack of human resources available to meet environmental requirements, but the underlying root cause appeared to be the lack of awareness in terms of who was responsible to ensure that environmental requirements were met. Table 6.2 below summarizes the root causes identified.

Once the Cause and Effect diagram was completed, the Payoff Matrix tool was used to prioritize the root causes. This tool was borrowed from the Work-OutTM method^^, which is a powerful team problem-solving technique (Bertels, 2003; Ulrich et al, 2002; Schaninger and Niebuhr, 1999; Waddick, 2003). The purpose of the Payoff Matrix was to identify which root causes the team felt could be addressed easily and which root causes would be more difficult to address. This tool allowed the team "to narrow down options through a systematic approach of comparing choices by selecting, weighting, and applying criteria" (Brassard and Ritter, 1994: 105). The tool also forced the team "to focus on the best thing(s) to do, and not everything they could do, dramatically increasing the chances of implementation success" (Brassard and Ritter, 1994: 105). Table 6.3 h ig h li^ts the scoring method used, which essentially compared

Effort

Little Hard 1 (Adapted from Bertels, 2003; Ulrich et al 2002; Waddic {, 2003) Using the scoring method listed above, the team went back to the Cause and Effect Diagram and together scored each of the root causes identified. The team felt that a number of the root causes identified could be easily addressed and could produce a big impact in terms of meeting environmental requirements including: clear identification of environmental requirements; systematic follow-up to ensure that environmental requirements were met; inclusion of environmental reporting and update requirements in the EHS manual; improving current filing methods; using current electronic tools available to incorporate environmental requirements; connecting PM activities with applicable environmental requirements; and training personnel regarding environmental requirements. The team decided that root causes identified such as lack of knowledge regarding environmental tools and techniques available to maintain the EMS, lack of knowledge regarding regulatory environmental requirements, lack of human resources to maintain the EMS, lack of awareness regarding responsibility, and vague job descriptions would be a little harder to address but still felt that the resulting impact would be big. Finally for the purposes of the study, the team decided that trying to change the view o f the corporate EHS department would not be easy, nor would it 89

have a big impact for the facility. Instead, it was felt that the responsibility to meet environmental requirements was at the facility level, and in turn the team determined tliat it would focus on solutions to help the facility meet its environmental requirements. Table 6.4 summarizes the results of the priority ranking below.

helped to ihrther define the project goal as is evident in the process performance improvement section below. 6.3 Process Performance Improvement Once the EMS process was measured and analyzed, the next step was to narrow the definition of the project goal in order to clearly define what defects would be addressed within the time allotted to complete the study. The team decided that the project goal was to reduce the number of defects identified in the Measure phase by at least 75%. Seventy-five percent was chosen for two reasons. First, the corporate mandate for a Six SigmaTM project to be considered successful was a 75% defect reduction. Second, it became apparent that not all of the identified root causes could be addressed through the research project either because of company organizational issues (e.g. human resources, job descriptions, etc.) or the time it would take to implement the solution. Nonetheless, it was decided that the necessary tools would be designed where applicable even if they could not be implemented during the research study, since the original purpose of the research study was to design an EMS. One technique that is commonly used during the Analyze phase is hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is an objective or statistical way to determine whether variations detected during the Measure phase are attributed to true defects or random effects (Brue, 2002; Pyzdek, 2002). This test allows two or more sets of data to be compared against using a null and alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis represents no difference in data sets, while the alternative hypothesis represents a statistically significant difference in data sets. However based on discussions with the company Black Belt, hypothesis testing was not used for the project because there was only one set o f data generated during the Measure phase. Therefore, it was not known whether the

defects identified were valid or if they were due to random variation. Furthermore, the team was not able to demonstrate graphically or statistically if defects identified were valid. This resulted in subjective versus objective improvement measures. 6.4 Analyze Phase Toîîgate Checklist After completion of the process performance improvement step an Analyze Phase Tollgate Checklist (Table 6.5) was completed to ensure that all the steps in the Analyze phase were completed. Once this was confirmed, the project moved to the Improve phase.

Chapter 7 - Improve Phase

7.1

Introduction The Improve phase is where many teams are tempted to jump to once a problem

has been identified. However once the team saw the value of asking questions, checking assumptions, and using data, team members realized the benefit of the Six SigmaTM method (Pande and Holpp, 2002). The Improve phase involves improving a process by eliminating defects (Waddick, 2003). Potential solutions are designed and assessed, and then validated through implementation case studies. Changes based on the case study results are made, and the process sigma is recalculated to determine if any improvement was made. This chapter discusses the brainstorming, the action plan matrix, and the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis tools. 7.2 Development of Proposed Solutions The team reviewed the results o f the Analyze phase to determine what solutions could be implemented and tested to address identified root causes. The team then discussed what root causes could realistically be addressed through the research study, and which root causes would have to be addressed between the Champion and the corporate EHS department. Therefore, it was decided that the team would focus on designing practical and simple solutions to address the root causes that impacted Company A 's ability to meet environmental requirements. Tire brainstorming technique was used again, along with a review of the M easure Phase Checklist, to identify potential solutions to implement to address the root causes. A number o f solutions were identified including designing a records filing list, tables to summarize requirements such as C of A (Air) terms and conditions and chemical reporting requirements, completing and/or obtaining required documents, and revising 93

various procedures and forms to include environmental requirements. Actual copies of revised procedures were not included in the paper because Company A wanted to remain anonymous. Instead a procedure revision summary table was completed in order to highlight the changes (Table 7.1), and copies of generic tables such as the C of A (Air) Requirement table, applicable legislation table, substances with key reporting requirements table, etc. were included in Appendices 3 to 6 of the research paper.

The team also decided that once the above improvements were made, an awareness session would be completed for affected employees so that they would be familiar with the new requirements in the procedures. In order to capture all the Improve recommendations, the team completed an Improve Matrix Action Plan. The Improve Matrix Action Plan outlined the issue, proposed solutions, timelines, and responsibilities, as well as the benefits, and impacts of the proposed solutions (Appendix 2). Once the Improve Phase Action Plan was completed however, it became apparent that the team did not think o f any cost reduction benefits associated with the study, and therefore just listed potential cost avoidance benefits. Although, cost avoidance is a recognized benefit under the Six SigmaTM method, it was determined that it was not as tangible as a cost reduction benefit. This may have occurred was because the project focused on meeting environmental requirements, as oppose to specific environmental projects or pollution prevention projects such as waste reduction where cost reduction benefits could be better defined. The cost o f implementation was also not representative because the project Green Belt facilitated the solutions, and was not an employee of the facility.

Another tool that is commonly used to mistake -proof proposed solutions is the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) tool^^. However, this tool was not used during the Improve phase to evaluate potential solutions, as the team felt that any failure in the potential solutions would result in the facility not meeting environmental requirements. 7.3 Solution Implementation The next step for the team was to implement the proposed solutions. After the proposed solutions were designed, an awareness session was completed outlining the additional environmental requirements for the EHS manual procedures (Table 7.1) to assist in meeting requirements. The team also reviewed how to use the checklist tool that was used in the Measure phase o f the study. The implementation period was approximately one month, and appeared to be relatively short for a number o f reasons. First, the project timeline completion as defined in the project charter was four to six months. Secondly, the facility agreed to permit the study to last for a four month period. Third, and most importantly, the Control phase was put in place to address any defeets that may arise once the project was completed. It was in this phase that monitoring and measuring solutions were addressed. 7.4 Process Sigma Recalculation Once the solutions were implemented, the checklist from the Measure phase, now called the Improve Phase Checklist, was completed again to evaluate the effectiveness of the Improve phase. Table 7.2 shows the completed Improve Phase Checklist below.

The Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) tool is used to rank and prioritize the possible causes o f failures o f potential solutions in order to include preventative actions to prevent the failures from occurring (Pande and Holpp, 2002).

Question A ir Em issions Management 1. Is an up-to-date documented air emissions inventory maintained on file?

Comments An up-to-date documented emissions inventory dated September 2002 is maintained on-file. There have reportedly been no changes since that time. A copy o f an up-to-date C of A (Air) was maintained in the air emissions file. Exempt sources are included with the air emissions summary information. A review of the C of A (Air) requirement table and supporting documentation indicated terms and conditions were being met for all affected equipment except for the lab fume hoods. This was because the fume hoods are part of another business operating out of the same building. The process is included in the air emissions management procedure.

Total Defects: 7 Total Number of Questions: 85

At this point in the study the checklist was used as a tool to determine whether or not there was a reduction in the number of defects in the c MS process. This demonstrated that the same tool could be used for different puiposes within the Six SigmaTM method. The total number o f defects identified from the Improve phase checklist was seven. Figure 7.1 below was completed in order to graphically compare the difference in the number of defects between the Measure and Improve phase.

(Courtesy ofisixsigma.com) The calculation was completed by taking the number of defects, which totaled seven, and dividing that number by the total number of opportunities, or total number of questions, which totalled eighty-five. The resulting number was 0.0824. This indicated that 8.24% of all opportunities were defects. The corresponding yield was 91.76% meaning that the facility was complying with 91.76% of the environmental requirements listed on the checklist. Since the Six SigmaTM method examines defects per one million opportunities, the resulting number of defects per million opportunities was 82,353. This resulted in a process sigma score of 2.89. The defect reduction was equal to 82%. Therefore, the research study met Company A's corporate definition of a successful project.

the Six SigmaTM method. When discrete data are used, process entitlement will only reach a three to four sigma level. 7.5 Process Performance Improvement Although the process sigma score improved tremendously, the team wanted to confirm that defect reduction was due to the improvements made by the team, as opposed to random effects. This step was completed with the help o f the company Black Belt. The test was completed in the Improve phase because there were now two sets of defect data, one from the Measure phase, and one from the Improve phase. Therefore, statistical arguments were established in order to test the data. The null hypothesis was defined as no statistical difference in the data sets, and the alternative hypothesis was defined as a statistically significant difference in data sets. In other words the null hypothesis was defined as Improve phase solutions not having an effect on defect reduction, and the alternative hypothesis was defined as Improve phase solutions having an effect on defect reduction. Once the hypotheses were defined, statistical analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The type of statistical analysis had to be defined in order to use the correct test. Use o f attribute data limited the applicable tests to the one sample proportion, two sample proportion, and chi square test. The number of factors had to be determined in order to narrow down test choices. The study had one factor, and that was meeting environmental requirements. Next, the number of samples had to be determined. There were two sets of data so it was decided that there were two samples available for the test. Finally, the purpose o f the statistical test had to be confirmed. Once again, the purpose of the statistical test was to determine if the Improve phase solutions had an impact on the defect reduction (i.e. independence test). Based on the information gathered, the chisquare test (Weiss, 1997) was used to test the null and alternative hypotheses.

Once the type o f statistical test to be used was determined, a statistical software program called Minitab® was used to complete the test. This software was available for use at the facility. The data was inputted and the chi-square test was completed (Table 7.3). The Pvalue was used in order to calculate the probability of being wrong if the alternative hypothesis was accepted. The P-value used for comparison purposes was P=0.05, or a significance level o f 95%. If the calculated P-value was more than 0.05, the significance level was less than 95% and the null hypothesis was accepted (i.e. Improve phase solutions did not affect defect reduction). If the calculated P-value was less than 0.05, the significance level was greater than 95% and the alternative hypothesis was accepted (i.e. Improve phase solutions did affect defect reduction). The resulting P-value was P<0.05, so the alternative hypothesis was accepted. Hence, Improve phase solutions did affect defect reduction.

Chapter 8. Control Phase 8.1 Introduction The Confro/phase is a very important step in the DMAIC process because its purpose is to prevent processes from reverting back to old ways. It also has a long- term impact on the way people work and ensuring that it lasts is as much about persuading people as it is about measuring and monitoring results (Pande and Holpp, 2002). Key steps involved with the Control phase include: · Designing a monitoring process to keep track of changes as they occur · Handing off project responsibilities to those responsible for the day-to-day activities · Creating a response plan to address any problems that may arise · Helping focus management's attention on a few critical measures that give them current information on the outcomes (Y) and key process measures (X) · Ensuring support from management for the long-tenn goals o f the project · Educating the rest of the employees in terms of the project subject (Adapted from Pande and Holpp, 2002) 8.2 Monitoring and Measurement One step in the Control phase was to include a regular assessment step to verify that environmental requirements were consistently being met. Therefore, the team decided to modify the Improve Phase Checklist (now called the Assessment Checklist) to include a column to identify whether or not the task was completed. This linked the Assessment Checklist to the EHS Compliance Calendar tool to ensure completion. Finally, there had to be a mechanism to communicate new regulatory or corporate

Monitoring the completion of required activities was another key point that was raised by the team. The Measure tool primarily focused on ensuring that a process was in place, but did not necessarily indicate if a required activity was completed. Therefore, the team had to decide how to make that connection. As previously mentioned, Company A already had a monitoring tool in place for health and safety activities called the EHS Compliance Calendar. The tool listed the activity to be completed, the frequency, and had a feature to indicate if the activity has been completed. Other features included reminder e-mails to responsible parties, as well as measurement of task completion. The team decided to leverage this existing tool in order to identify environmental management tasks to be completed, by whom, and by when. Tasks were identified using the Improve Phase Checklist, categorized by checklist categories, and inputted into the calendar. Table 8.2 summarizes the tasks added to the EHS Compliance Calendar.

Response Plan to Address Areas for Improvement The team then had to decide how to identify ai eas for improvement, and actions

to take to make any necessary improvements. Once again, it was indicated that Company A was an ISO 9002 registered company and could therefore use its existing corrective action process to address this issue. As such, the corresponding procedure was revised to

The project Green Belt and the Champion also completed a project review in order to formally "close" the project. A Four-Blocker Project Summary tool^' (Figure 8.1) was used for the close-out meeting. The Four-Blocker Project Summary categorized information into the Define/Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control phases of the project. The Define/Measure section included information such as the opportunity statement, project goal, definitions of defect unit and opportunity, and the process sigma score. The Analyze section o f the summary highlighted the vital X 's identified throughout the project. The Improve section outlined the benefits of the project, as well as the re-calculated process sigma score. Finally, the Control section of the summary included the monitoring plan.
The Four-BIocker Summary tool highlights the key findings from each o f the steps in the DMAIC process.

Once the project was considered closed, the Champion (Service Centre Manager) expressed a commitment to ensuring that environmental requirements would be met. The Service Centre Manager also gained more awareness and appreciation for the work involved in meeting environmental requirements through the Six SigmaTM method. 8.5 Employee Communication and Management Commitment Employees were also provided with a review of the Four-Blocker Project Summary tool, in order to make them aware o f what the project was about, what changes Company A made to assist in meeting environmental requirements, and what their role was in helping Company A meet those requirements. A pictorial EMS Dashboard tool^ was also created (Bertels, 2003; Eckes, 2003) in order to visually demonstrate how

Chapter 9. Discussion 9.1 Six SigmaTM Applicability in EMS Design Completion of the project demonstrated that the Six SigmaTM method could be applied to EMS design. In order to optimize an organization's performance, all processes should be improved with the DMAIC process (Wheat et al, 2003). There is the potential for multiple uses of Six SigmaTM in the environmental management field, including EMS design or projects to address specific environmental issues. Managing the environment is a process just as is designing products, invoicing customers, and making a widget, and Six SigmaTM can be equally applied to both products and processes. A true Six SigmaTM organization does not only produce excellent product, but also maintains highly efficient production and administrative systems (Perez-Wilson, 1997). 9.2 Benefits of Applying Six SigmaTM to EMS Design There were a number o f benefits and strengths associated with applying the Six SigmaTM method EMS design. The first benefit was the use of relatively simple quality tools in a structured process to improve Company A 's EMS without having to recreate what may have already been done. More importantly, the Six SigmaTM method provided a defined method that still allowed for creativity (Bertels, 2003). The Six SigmaTM method allowed for the examination of what was in place and working in other functions or departments o f Company A, as well as leveraging best practices from other companies. For example, existing tools used in other departments such as the EHS Compliance Calendar, coixective action process, and the dashboard tool were used to assist with Company A 's EMS. As well, the use o f tables, charts, and simple procedures assisted in this regard. In fact, the use o f simplified tools both to identify requirements and to design tasks led to the operationalization o f environmental requirements and the EMS in 126

Company A. Instead o f one person completing all the tasks, tasks were delegated to different individuals. The development of tools, particularly during the Improve phase, also enabled Company A to generate records and improve its record management. It also allowed Company A to design and implement measurement and tracking tools that aided in monitoring the EMS. Finally, the tools served as an educational resource, particularly the Measure/Assessment checklist and applicable regulatory summary. Another benefit of the Six SigmaTM method was in indicating the financial implications o f completing the project. This was important for identifying as well as educating personnel as to the costs involved in EMS design and cost avoidance. The use of process maps was extremely beneficial in a number of ways. First, use o f the process map allowed for the identification of facility process inputs and outputs, and allowed Company A employees to gain a better understanding of the various processes in the facility. It also demonstrated how and where facility processes interacted with the environment such as air emissions, water intake and discharge, raw material and chemical use, and waste generation points. This ultimately led to the identification of applicable environmental legislation for Company A that further permitted the development o f a fi-amework in which to design the EMS, as well as identify where stakeholders were connected to Company A 's processes. Completion o f the process maps could have been used for identification of potential Six SigmaTM projects to improve environmental performance, pollution prevention opportunities, and well as hazard analysis techniques. Although it was not the scope of the case study, an examination of potential pollution prevention opportunities could have been completed including material substitution, product design or reformulation, equipment or process modifications, spill and leak prevention, on-site re-

use, recycling or recovery, improved inventory management or purchasing techniques, good operating practices, and training (Environment Canada, 2003). The Six SigmaTM DMAIC process could also be used in completing specific environmental projects. Hazard analysis techniques could have also been used once the process maps were completed. For example, a hazard analysis could have been used to evaluate the nature of an accidental release for spill/release response plan development or revisions. Steps would include the review o f chemical inventory and storage conditions, chemical properties, dispersion modeling, and consequence analysis (Dowsett, 2003). Once this was completed, spill/release response plans could be designed or revised. The Measure/Improve checklist tool was also beneficial in a number o f ways including identifying defects in the EMS process, identifying gaps in the EMS that needed to be addressed, as well as serving as an assessment tool during the Control phase. Perhaps the most important benefit of applying the Six SigmaTM method to EMS design was the development of a Roadmap as outlined in Table 9.1 below.

Development of this tool provides a consistent, structured, and rigorous process that can be used over and over again by Company A to constantly improve the EMS, and allow it to become more efficient (Wlodarczyk et al, 2000). It provided instructions for company personnel in order to move from identifying the problem/opportunity to addressing it. It also prevented the team from jumping directly from problem/opportunity identification to solution implementation.

Limitations Associated with Six Sigma^" ^ Use for EMS Design Limitations in the Six SigmaTM method occurred primarily in the Measure and

Analyze phases. First, discrete data were used in the project, and this type of data has limitations in that sigma improvement could only reach a four sigma. Continuous data would be required in order to reach five and six sigma levels. Decisions made in the Six SigmaTM project were only as good as the measurement system used. One way to address this weakness would be for Company A to change the measurement tool so that it could measure the percent completion of the EMS. The data collected could then be treated as continuous data, and could be used to provide further defect reduction and process sigma improvement. The measurement system analysis was also a weak area. A statistically-based analysis could not be carried out because only one set of data was obtained during the Measure phase. In order to improve this area, a number of assessments could be completed over a defined period of time, thereby generating a number o f data sets. A more comprehensive measurement system analysis could then be completed to determine if any measurement system bias or flaws exist. A similar type of weakness was also identified during the Analyze phase. As previously highli^ted, the team could not determine whether the defects identified were statistically significant, or whether they were due to a random effect. This was because only one set of data was collected during the Measure phase. Hypothesis testing could have been completed if more than one set of data were collected. This would have allowed improvement decisions to be based on objective information as oppose to subjective information.

Identification o f applicable environmental requirements was facilitated because the project Green Belt worked as a specialist in the environmental management field. Therefore, identification of environmental requirements could have been problematic if none of the team members had an environmental background. However, such an obstacle could be overcome by ensuring more involvement of the business level EHS Manager to assist with identifying applicable environmental regulations. An environmental consultant would have to be used for smaller companies with no in-house environmental expertise. Tlie biggest potential limitation in applying the Six SigmaTM method for EMS design was commitment. This project was completed because Company A has already embraced Six SigmaTM as a way to do business. This, however, came after eight years of aggressive implementation efforts (Hoerl, 2002). This may not be the case in an organization that does not use Six SigmaTM. Six SigmaTM acceptance is often an ignored element when attempting to implement it in organizations (Eckes, 2001). Even if Six SigmaTM was implemented in Company A, team dynamics were critical in order to complete the project. In particular, the Champion had a crucial role throughout the whole process, and therefore management commitment was imperative in order for Six SigmaTM to work (Dusharme, 2003; Eckes, 2003; Waxer, 2001). 9.4 Further Research More research is needed to examine how Six SigmaTM is being applied to pollution prevention projects, and to projects that focus on improving environmental performance. There is also an opportunity to examine the use of Six SigmaTM in implementing an ISO 14001-based EMS, since ISO 14001 is an internationally recognized Standard. Although there has been some preliminary work in this area

(Keren, 2001), the idea needs to be tested for its effectiveness. Further research is also needed in order to determine how companies are currently using Six SigmaTM in the environmental management field. This is especially true in discovering how companies are capturing financial benefits associated with Six SigmaTM use in the environmental field. Finally, there is a need for more studies regarding how to implement an EMS. Once this information becomes available, more companies will truly begin to integrate environmental management into their businesses.

Chapter 10. Conclusions Some Six SigmaTM tools may not be appropriate to apply to EMS design. However, Six SigmaTM does provide a defined and structured method that allows a problem or opportunity to be defined, measured, analyzed, improved, and controlled. This results in a method that can be used over and over again to design or improve an EMS. This is a concept that not been thoroughly developed in EMS literature to date. At this point, the structured process of Six SigmaTM itself is probably more beneficial in EMS design as opposed to focusing on which tools are used during the DMAIC process. The Six SigmaTM method also promoted team involvement from a number of people with varying backgrounds. This especially helped during brainstorming and identification o f activities in order to have a more comprehensive analysis o f an issue. Although a structured method was used, there was still room for creative thinking, as well as flexibility in selecting the tools used during the DMAIC process (Dusharme, 2003). However, it was important to ensure that the appropriate tools were selected in order to effect meaningful change. In conclusion, Six SigmaTM can be applied as a structured and consistent method in EMS design.
