"The Middle East and North Africa are much more complex than what is described in the discourse of the West." "Western powers attempt to create a simple and attractive outcomes." "Western countries ... are rushing to fulfill the political expectation of Gadaffi's removal ... especially in Paris, where it is treated like child's play." "The direction of this military action is not at all like the clear and and accurate trajectory of a Tomahawk missile." "Victory or defeat does not depend on the success or failure of military action itself."

The New York Times
·"Didn't we arm the rebels in Afghanistan in the '80s? And didn't many become Taliban
and end up turning our own weapons on us? And didn't one mujahadeen from Saudi Arabia, Osama bin Laden, go on to lead Al Qaeda?" ·Qaddafi is a terrible man, but I don't think it's the business of the United States to overthrow him. Those who want America to support democratic movements and insurrections by force if necessary wherever there's a chance of them succeeding are committing the United States to endless wars of altruism.

Fox News
·Will the allies accept a "painful stalemate" hoping that other UN sanctions will grind
him down and cause more tribes to turn on him? Will the resolution ultimately result in "regime change" or will the coalition that voted the no-fly zone and the Libyan rebels fighting on the ground, for that matter, splinter over tactics and goals?

(People's Daily)
What this award shows is some of the arrogance and prejudice of some Western people; their contempt and insults against the Chinese people. Their hailing of Liu Xiaobo as "hero" is a serious violation of the national spirit of the Chinese people. Any nation needs its own heroes, and any nation without them is weak and powerless. Chinese people have had their own distinctive concept of the hero. Lu Xun once said: "Since ancient times, we have hard-working people, who are not solicitous of praise. We also have heros who are willing to strive for justice among the people. Even the history books written by the royal family could not overshadow their glory. They are the backbone of China." Wen Tianqiang, is one of this type of hero, who left a poem behind: "No one can survive death finally, but we need to leave a red heart shinning for the history books." Yue Fei is another one, who is famous for the tattoo of "true heart to repay the nation. Lin Zexue is one, who burn the opium in Humen Gate in canton. These heroes represent the integrity of the Chinese cultural spirit; the pride and backbone of the Chinese. Their spirit spreads, encouraging today's generation. People like Liu Xiaobo, was not, is not, and will never be a Chinese hero.

The New York Times
The American Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen replaced the control of the autocrat with the sovereignty of the people as the source of national power and legitimacy.

Los Angeles Times
Liu has sacrificed his freedom in the fight for universal human rights, which are denied the citizens of many countries besides China.

Pocket Oxford Chinese Dictionary: nation/nationality Chow Yiu-Fai, Inter-Asia Cultural Studies: "Denotes `the people', with
an emphasis on lineage, more than race, which, however, tends to conflate with `the nation'.

William Callahan, Journal of Contemporary China: "a blurring of
scientific categories of culture and race."

James Leibold, The China Quarterly: "...political elites merged Western
notions of liberal pluralism with the Confucian discourse of cultural universalism." In other words, those who abide by Confucian rites.
