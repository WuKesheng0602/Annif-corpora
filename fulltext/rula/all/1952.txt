USING CALIBRATED SIMULATION TO QUANTIFY THE ENERGY SAVINGS FROM RESIDENTIAL PASSIVE SOLAR DESIGN IN CANADA Master of Applied Science 2013 ­ Hayes Emerson Zirnhelt ­ Building Science Program Ryerson University

!=&#)1:#"
Energy savings from passive solar design applied to a typical Canadian house were quantified using calibrated whole building energy simulation. A detailed energy simulation model was created for a research house which represents a typical Canadian tract house with basic passive solar measures. The model was calibrated to measured furnace gas consumption data. Eight design scenarios were evaluated for eight climate locations. Design parameters included increased thermal mass, increased south window area, and high performance windows. In addition, an advanced house scenario was evaluated which featured optimized geometry, a further increase in south window area, high thermal mass, advanced glazing, and no north facing windows. For the typical house predicted solar heating fractions ranged from 20% to 34% with basic passive solar measures, and 35% to 52% for more aggressive passive solar measures. For the advanced house predicted solar fractions ranged from 40% to 69%.

With the choice now between "dangerous" and "extremely dangerous" levels of climate change (Anderson and Bows 2011), the need to reduce emissions from the building and construction sector has perhaps never been more urgent. Globally, it is predicted that the highest potential for economical climate change mitigation is through initiatives in the building sector (IPCC 2007). The operation of buildings accounts for 29% of Canada's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (NRCan 2011), and over half of these emissions are from the residential sector. It is essential that the GHG emissions of Canadian houses are reduced and eventually eliminated. In Canada, space heating accounts for over 60% of residential energy consumption (NRCan 2011). The space heating demand of new single-family residential buildings can be significantly reduced through the use of low energy design strategies. One of the most promising of these strategies is passive solar design. It has been suggested that passive solar design is the most effective means to reduce space-heating requirements in Canadian houses, when used in conjunction with insulation levels equivalent to the requirements of Canada's R-2000 program (Athienitis 2007). The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's passive solar house design book (1998, now out of print), suggested that one third to one half of the space heating requirement can be met with passive solar gain. Canada's potential to reduce energy consumption and associated GHG emissions, with passive solar design, ranks high relative to other countries, due to its predominantly cold and sunny climate (CMHC 1998). When coupled with earth sheltering, houses in the UK have been able to eliminate 1

the need for an active heating system (Hockerton Housing Project 2010). A limited number of studies have quantified the energy savings from passive solar design applied to a typical dwelling in Canada (eg. EMR 1984, CMHC 1998). Most passive solar design literature for cold climates is out of date, as much of the research was carried out several decades ago. In many cases the analysis was limited to statistically-based calculations, rather than hourly or sub-hourly time step based simulation that is common now (O'Brien et al. 2008). Understanding the potential of passive solar design has significance to policy and planning decisions for cities, regarding density and shading. Typical values for energy savings from passive solar design could be useful for informing house designers and justifying incentive programs designed to support/promote the adoption of low energy buildings. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential of passive solar design as a means to save energy in the residential sector, and to produce accurate estimates for typical energy savings from passive solar design for a common new house, throughout a range of nationally representative Canadian climates. This thesis research adds to the work by CMHC (1998), with more locations and more emphasis on quantifying the effect of design variables. Dynamic simulations were carried out with the EnergyPlus simulation engine using a calibrated baseline model of a typical tract-built house. Several passive solar design options were evaluated for eight locations in Canada, these options include variations in size and type of glazing and the inclusion of additional thermal storage mass. Passive solar potential is quantified and expressed in terms of solar heating fraction and heating energy consumption.

A passive solar building can be defined as a building that offsets a significant portion of its heating requirement using solar energy, where the solar collection system primarily operates in a passive manner, rather than through active systems which employ pumps or fans to circulate solar energy (this definition is consistent with Chan et al. 2010). HFEFE <1:>7),4*+",*";1&&'0%"9,21)"-%&%1):$" Most of the research on passive solar design in North America was conducted in the mid 1970's to mid 1980's largely in response to oil shortages. A majority of the research on passive solar originates from government sponsored work in the US (for an overview refer to Balcomb 1992). A majority of the effort to promote passive solar has been directed towards single family residential. It has been estimated that there are over 200,000 passive solar homes in the US (Balcomb 1992). Research in the US showed that large energy savings could be achieved with little or no additional capital cost (Balcomb 1992). This research has also produced the many of the simulation techniques, and design guidelines. Passive solar research in Canada has been much less extensive. Barakat (1982) provides an overview of National Research Council of Canada (NRCC) studies. Many of these studies were test cell based. For experiments using simple test cells with only south facing glazing, found that 34% to 53% of the heating demand was being supplied by solar (Barakat 1984). These results are promising, as the test cells were much less insulated than modern buildings and had only regular double pane glazing and 38 x 89 mm 3

insulated frame walls. Barakat (1984) concluded from these test cell studies that the energy savings from an eight fold increase in thermal mass were `modest' and could be more practically accomplished via increased air circulation. HFEFH 9'#%"A,*&'+%)1#',*&"1*+"I%&'7*"J4'+%2'*%&" Many guidelines exist for passive solar design (eg. Balcomb 1983, Chiras 2002, CMHC 1998, etc.). However, most are over a decade old, and some are out of print (eg. CMHC 1998). Many of these guidelines take the form of basic design principles, such as orientation for maximum solar gain, the use of thermal mass to reduce temperature fluctuations and advice on maximum south facing window areas. An ideal site for passive solar would allow for south facing windows to receive no shading from nearby trees (or buildings) between 9am and 3pm on the winter solstice (CMHC 1998). The optimal orientation of a passive solar building in the northern hemisphere is due south (Jones 1992). CMHC (1998) offers the following guidelines for passive solar: · The building should be oriented so that the aspect with the most window area faces +/- 15° of south, with southeast being preferred over southwest. · · Orientations of up to 30° from south can still provide considerable energy savings. Windows with high solar heat gain coefficients (SHGC) should be selected for south facing aspects. · South facing window areas should not be higher than 8% of the total floor area, unless additional thermal mass is added, in which case up to 15% is recommended.

4

Guidelines differ on maximum south window area. Charron and Athienitis (2006) recommend 7% to 12% for basic designs, and no more than 20% for high mass designs, considerably higher values than recommended by CMHC 1998. Guidelines around shading need to be carefully considered when aiming to maximize the energy performance of passive solar homes. According to Hastings (1995), a common premise in passive solar design is that fixed overhangs can provide shade from summer sun without restricting useful solar gain during the heating season. However, the lag between outdoor temperature and sun angle causes this assumption to be invalid. As described by Gusdorf et al. (2011 p. 1): "there is no net benefit to any configuration of fixed overhangs. This is because the overhangs block potentially useful solar energy in the spring shoulder seasons (March and April), and allow the sun to overheat a house in August and September." Movable shading, including awnings and roll shutters, provide a more optimal solution (discussed further in Section 2.2). Although compact forms, such as a cube, have lower surface area and thus lower heat loss compared to complex geometries, a shallower north-south depth can allow for deeper solar penetration, and better facilitates increased south window area. The aspect ratio, a common metric used to describe building geometry, is the equatorial facing façade length divided by the perpendicular façade length. Chiras (2002) recommends an aspect ratio of 1.3 to 1.5, and Athienitis (2007) claims an aspect ratio of 1.2-1.3 is optimal. Jones (1992) provides a detailed overview of thermal storage in passive solar buildings. Sensible heat storage is the most common and least expensive method for storing heat gains in passive solar buildings (Jones 1992). Sensible heat storage is 5

commonly referred to as thermal mass. Materials with high specific heat capacity, density and conductivity are desired; with water, stone, concrete and masonry being the best performing options for thermal mass. Latent heat storage in phase change materials present another option, but are not yet widely available. Johnson (1981) recommends sizing thermal mass based on the diurnal heat capacity, a measure of heat storage and release over a daily cycle. For concrete the maximum occurs at 200 mm for mass exposed to direct sun. However, the diurnal heat capacity when the mass is not directly exposed to sun reaches a maximum at 75 mm. When using concrete for thermal mass, little additional benefit is achieved with thickness greater than 100 mm (Jones 1992). Covering concrete floors with carpet reduces the effectiveness of thermal storage by approximately 50%. Early studies found effectiveness of thermal mass was not very sensitive to the surface solar absorptance (Jones 1992). Light coloured thermal mass is desirable as it reflects a higher portion of solar radiation onto other surfaces, increasing the effective surface area of mass, and enhances daylighting (Johnson 1992). Johnson (1992) illustrates this with the following example; for a building with off-white walls (solar absorptance of 0.2) and glazing area equal to 25% of the floor area, only 12% to 18% of the incoming solar radiation escapes. Multiple reflections and absorptions cause a typical room in a building to behave like an optical cavity. HFEFK"-%:%*#";1&&'0%"9,21)"B'#%)1#4)%" As discussed in Section 2.1.1, passive solar literature was prolific during the mid 1970's through to the mid 1980s. After this period, relatively few studies were published, however publications on passive solar have recently been increasing. 6

Hastings (1995) reviewed assumptions which are often incorrect yet remain used in passive solar design. One notable example is the assumption that passive solar is less feasible in northern or overcast climates. However, in such locations solar gains are typically better utilized by offsetting heating energy consumption without causing overheating (Hastings 1995). Athienitis (1997) studied the interaction of radiant floor heating in direct gain passive solar heated buildings, concluding that control based on operative temperature results in increased thermal comfort and utilization of passive solar gains. Littlefair (1998) reviewed a range of tools and techniques to predict solar access in dense urban areas, in addition to methods for protecting solar access of existing buildings, most of which are based on sun angle. A largely unshaded site is essential to effective passive solar design. Simulations done for low and medium density housing developments, suggested passive solar savings diminish to less than half for non-ideal site layouts (NBA Tectonics 1988, cited in Littlefair 1998). O'Brien et al. (2008) introduced the concept of design days for passive solar design, where specific days of interest for thermal performance and comfort are investigated in detail during the design process. These days include a cold cloudy (winter), cold sunny (winter), and a warm sunny day (shoulder season). Passive solar design was a key feature of the Alstonvale Net Zero Energy House, near Montreal, which was expected to achieve a passive solar heating fraction of approximately 60% (Candanedo and Athienitis 2009). Although this house went through design analysis, it was destroyed by fire shortly after construction; therefore no measured passive solar performance data exists. However, the simulation results indicate that passive solar 7

continues to a promising energy saving feature in modern energy efficient homes. Chan et al. (2010) reviewed passive solar heating and cooling technologies, including Tombe walls, passive solar air heaters (SolarWall), solar chimneys, and double facades technologies beyond the scope of the research presented here. Hachem et al. (2011a) investigated passive and active solar potential for various geometric configurations of a two storey single-family dwelling, using simulation for Montreal. They estimate the mean incident solar radiation on south facing glazing units, and the reduction of solar radiation that occurs with various complex geometries such as L, H, and T shapes and a trapezoid. Hachem et al. (2011b) investigated parameters influencing the total solar potential of solar housing units in different neighborhood designs. Their study found that some complex geometries can provide higher potential for electricity generation, although this comes with a reduction in passive solar heating potential. Reductions in passive solar heating potential were calculated for various layouts and building geometries, and a methodology is presented to evaluate the solar potential of various neighborhood configurations. O'Brien et al. (2011) studied sensitivity of thermal zoning and interzonal airflow for modelling the energy performance and comfort of passive solar buildings. They conclude that assumptions for thermal zoning and interzonal airflow can have a significant impact on energy consumption and thermal comfort predictions. HFEFL"M41*#'3':1#',*",3";1&&'0%"9,21)"N*%)7."910'*7&"'*"A1*1+1" Few studies have quantified the potential energy savings from passive solar across Canada. In 1984, EMR Canada studied energy efficient housing and solar orientation. They found that it is generally feasible to design new subdivisions so that a majority of 8

lots have adequate solar exposure for passive solar, at little or no extra cost for land or services. Passive solar energy savings for increased south window area were quantified relative to a south facing baseline house. EMR Canada predicted of 7.3% and 7.5% in Edmonton and Toronto, for envelope insulation levels slightly lower than typically employed now in most Canadian climates. With much higher insulation levels, they estimated savings of 11.9% to 13.8% for Edmonton and Toronto respectively. Their study was limited to a monthly heat balance method, and did not include thermal storage, and limited temperature fluctuations to 2.75°C, using ventilation to prevent any overheating. More recently, CMHC (1998) quantified passive solar savings for a variety of house designs for several Canadian climates; Vancouver, Ottawa and Winnipeg finding solar heating fractions ranging from 13% (Winnipeg) to 67% (Vancouver), depending on the house design. CMHC defines the solar heating fraction as "the ratio of the useful solar gains to the house's annual heating consumption, calculated as if these gains were not present" (CMHC 1998 p.44). The details of the simulation methodology used is not described, however the DOE-2 simulation program was used. The DOE-2 program was developed during the 1990s. Recent simulation programs such as EnergyPlus feature more sophisticated simulation techniques, including sub-hourly timesteps (up to 60 per hour), and have undergone many revisions. Sub-hourly timesteps are essential to capturing the interactions with thermal mass, an important feature of advanced passive solar designs.

The analysis for this thesis research was based on the Twin Houses at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology (CCHT) site, which are architecturally representative of typical tract-built houses in Canada (CCHT 2010). One of the Twin Houses, referred to as the Reference House, remains unchanged and is used as a baseline for experiments carried out in the other house. The Twin Houses were built to the current version of the R-2000 standard in 1998, a voluntary energy performance standard in Canada (the R-2000 standard was updated in 2005 and 2012 (NRCan 2012)). The CCHT Reference House has insulation levels comparable to most current provincial building codes. In addition, the building has a relatively high air tightness rating (1.5 ACH@50) and uses a heat recovery ventilator. In order to ensure the Twin Houses are as identical as possible, they include simulated occupants, rather than real human occupants. A building automation system turns on and off appliances, hot water fixtures and lights according to a schedule, which represents a typical family of four. Light bulbs are used to simulate the heat released from occupants. The automated internal gains were based on a target electricity consumption of 20 kWh/day, a common input value used for simulation studies (Swinton et al. 2001). Numerous studies have been carried out at the CCHT, primarily relating to energy conservation and include thermostat setback (Manning et al. 2007), electronically commutated furnace fan motors (Gusdorf et al. 2001), and combined heat and power systems (Swinton et al 2004). Several studies related to passive solar have been carried out at the CCHT. Laouadi (2010) developed guidelines for solar shading devices based on research at the 10

CCHT, and also evaluated the heating and cooling energy savings of insulated exterior roll shutters, finding a heating energy savings of 7%. Gusdorf et al. (2011) studied the performance of summer awnings at the CCHT. Manning et al. (2008) compared the effect of high and low solar heat gain windows on heating and cooling energy consumption. Energy consumption as well as air temperatures and transmitted solar radiation were measured for a period of 28 days during January and February. Measured energy consumption differences were extrapolated, finding a predicted increase in furnace gas consumption of 10% when low solar heat gain windows were used, despite the lower solar heat gain windows having a slightly lower U value (1.62 W/m2K compared to 1.76 W/m2K). The heating energy savings from the high solar gain windows were found to be three times larger than the summer cooling energy savings from the low solar gain windows (their experiment did not employ any free cooling, therefore cooling energy is overestimated compared to an occupied house). Manning et al. (2008) suggest the need for calibrated simulation to extrapolate results from such experiments to predict energy savings for a wider range of climatic conditions.

The literature on calibrating building simulations to match measured data, focuses on the commercial sector (for a review refer to Reddy 2006). Calibration of commercial building models often involves "fine tuning" the parameters which have a high level of uncertainty, until a sufficient match is achieved between recorded and simulated energy consumption. Calibration literature for residential single family dwellings is very limited. Judkoff et al. (1983) present a validation methodology aimed at simulation programs (as 11

opposed to models), using three types of validation; inter-program comparison, analytical tests, and empirical validation. In this thesis the term `empirical validation' is referred to as calibration. Judkoff et al. (1983) compared measured thermal performance in the SERI passive solar test house to simulation results from the DOE-2.1, BLAST-3.0, and SERIRES-l.0 simulation programs. Several important conclusions from their work are as follows: · standard engineering assumptions for input (such as conductivity values from ASHRAE) can introduce prediction errors of 60% · · accurate temperature prediction does not ensure accurate load prediction even after measured data was used to eliminate most uncertainties, errors of 10% to 17% were still found, most of this they attribute to solar over prediction (these programs used the isotropic sky assumption) · a validation methodology should account for hidden compensating errors.

More recently, Meldem and Winklemann (1995) calibrated the DOE-2 with measurements in the Pala Test Houses, passive solar test houses in California. They found excellent agreement between simulated and measured air temperatures for unconditioned low and high mass houses, ranging from 0.1 to 1°C. Their high mass house has 100 mm of concrete added to the interior all exterior walls, and 100 mm concrete interzone partitions. These houses featured modest insulation compared to current Canadian standards, with a total thermal resistance for the walls of 1.79 W/m2K.

The objectives of this research are as follows: 1. To create a calibrated energy simulation model of a typical Canadian house. 2. To contribute to the quantification of the potential energy savings from passive solar design, for a broad range of Canadian climates.

This research will provide an update to earlier work which is now out dated due to advances in simulation software and changes building technology including advancements in window technology. The most thorough quantification of passive solar energy savings in Canada (CMHC 1998), only evaluated three climates. This research will provide a rigorous quantification of passive solar energy savings for eight locations, representing a broad range of Canadian climates.

The research questions for this thesis are as follows: 1. Which simulation parameters have the most influence on the accuracy of modelling the heating energy consumption of passive solar houses? 2. What are the energy savings for a typical Canadian tract house if passive solar design features are maximized? 3. What is the contribution that passive solar energy makes to the heating requirements of a typical Canadian tract house on a non-shaded site?

KFK"9:,(%"
The scope of this research is limited to direct gain passive solar design. Direct gain is the considered simplest and most-cost effective passive solar design strategy (CMHC 1998). It is expected that the predicted energy saving from direct gain would be of similar magnitude to the energy savings to any of the other common passive solar strategies, such as: sunspaces, indirect gain (trombe wall variations), because results of a large scale monitoring project of 48 passive solar houses throughout the US showed no noticeable difference between the performance of the various passive solar strategies (Balcomb 1983). This study focuses on single-family dwellings, which are the most common dwelling type in Canada (NRCan 2011). Potential energy savings from passive solar is explored on a per house basis, assuming full solar access. Eight locations were selected for modeling to represent the range of Canadian climates and population centres: Vancouver, Prince George, Yellowknife, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, and Halifax. The study is limited to houses heated with gas furnaces, as the reference house chosen is gas heated (the practical relevance of this limitation is that over 50% of Canadian houses use gas furnaces (NRCan 2011)). However, it is expected that the resulting heating loads would be similar for electrically heated houses provided that a means of mechanically driven air circulation is included (eg. ducted HRV). Any 14

difference in air circulation and interzonal heat transfer would need to be considered when extrapolating the results from this study, as increased air circulation between zones results in better utilization of solar heat gain. The analysis in this research is primarily limited to space heating energy consumption. Space cooling represents only 1.6% of total residential energy consumption in Canada (based on 2008 data, from NRCan 2010). Although this is a very small portion nationally, space cooling can be much more significant in specific climate locations in Canada and for some house designs, specifically those with large east and west facing windows or very large south facing windows. Summer overheating issues are not considered in this research because south facing windows can be shaded during the summer with shading devices such as awnings or roll shutters (Laouadi 2010) or other passive cooling measures. Overheating during the heating season is dealt with through passive ventilation at a zone level, during periods when the zone is occupied.

This research uses calibrated whole building simulation to quantify passive solar energy savings. KFLFE"P$,2%"<4'2+'*7"N*%)7."9'5421#',*"?'#$"N*%)7.;24&" Building simulation has been credited with supporting building design optimization in addition to facilitating more detailed design analysis (Augenbroe 2002). Hundreds of simulation programs have been developed over the 50 year history of energy simulation (Crawley et al. 2008). Some simpler simulation programs are based on a steady state monthly heat balance, for example HOT-2000, which is still widely used in Canada (NRCan 2008). 15

These simple steady state programs do not allow for accurate assessment of usable solar gains, especially for advanced buildings with high levels of insulation and increased thermal mass (Kisilewicz 2007). More advanced programs, such as EnergyPlus, use subhourly timesteps and can more accurately capture the behaviour of transient interactions such as heat storage in building surfaces (thermal mass). EnergyPlus was chosen as the simulation platform due to its accuracy, flexibility and high level of input detail. EnergyPlus is a dynamic simulation program developed by the US Department of Energy and its partner agencies. It uses an integrated, modular simulation approach and a time step computation technique (Crawley 2004). EnergyPlus has been tested extensively and validated using standardized building energy simulation test methods (Crawley 2004, Hennigner and Witte 2007), and has been used in several passive solar studies (eg. O'Brien et al. 2011, Mirithane and Vale 2006, Hachem et al. 2011a,b). With exception to the calibration, all simulations were carried out using Canadian Weather for Energy Calculations (CWEC) weather data, which is based on data from 1953 ­ 1995 and represents a "typical" weather year (Numerical Logistics 1999). Using historical weather data introduces potential error in the quantification of future energy savings due to changing climate trends, however to the best of the author's knowledge there is no standardized technique for including climate projections in energy simulations at this time. KFLFH"A12'=)1#%+"9'5421#',*" A calibrated simulation model was created for a typical Canadian tract house with basic passive solar features. This model was used to evaluate the energy savings from this 16

type of building in other Canadian climates. In addition the calibrated model formed the basis of the simulation models used to evaluate other passive solar measures. This approach allows for energy savings to be quantified from measured energy consumption data with a reasonable level of accuracy without requiring a full-scale experiment. Also, the analysis can be extrapolated to predict energy savings in other climates and with variation in design parameters. Calibration of the simulation model is essential to ensure that the results are accurate, especially when simulating changes in design parameters. It is particularly important that errors are minimal for the sub models related to the design parameters of study, as these errors can become magnified. For example, the overprediction of solar heat gain through windows could double when the window area is doubled. Calibration of building simulation models involves the "fine tuning" of parameters, which have a high level of uncertainty, until a sufficient match is achieved between recorded and simulated energy consumption. These parameters are varied over a range of possible or realistic values. However, simply matching simulated to measured annual energy consumption does not necessarily mean that a model is sufficiently calibrated. Further analysis is required to ensure that the match in annual data is not by chance. Error and uncertainty is unavoidable in the simulation model and simulation program. If there are errors which considerably overestimate and underestimate components of the energy balance, then the model may not be accurate enough for a given research project even though the simulated and measured annual energy consumption match. Therefore, simulation results must be compared to measured data at a resolution higher than annual consumption data. 17

ASHRAE provides guidance for the calibration of building energy simulation for the purpose of energy saving calculations in Guideline 14 (2002). This guideline suggests the use of two statistical metrics, the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV(RMSE)) and the normalized mean bias error (NMBE). The CV(RMSE) and NMBE are calculated as shown in Equations 3-1 to 3-4. CV(RMSE) = RMS (Error) / Average Measured Energy Consumption NMBE = # Error / [ Average Error * (n -1) ] Where: Error = Measured Energy Consumption ­ Simulated Energy Consumption computed for data points 0 to n. RMS (Error) = {Average (Error2)}1/2 (3-4) (3-3) (3-1) (3-2)

Guideline 14 (2002) specifies that in order to declare a model calibrated, the CV(RMSE) should be within +/- 30% using hourly data, or +/- 15% using monthly data and that the NMBE should be within +/-10% (hourly) or +/-5% (monthly). ASHRAE does not provide guidance on calibrating with daily values. Therefore, the daily calibration requirements were assumed to be the average of monthly and hourly, thus the maximum CV(RSME) target used in this research is 22.5% and the maximum NMBE target is 7.5%. ASHRAE (2002) prefers the use of hourly data for calibration to monthly as higher resolution data can provide more insight into the source of inaccuracies. Daily data was available for an entire heating season for the CCHT Reference House. This was the primary justification for the use of daily calibration in this research. 18

Microsoft ExcelTM was used for calibration calculations and to graph the measured daily furnace gas consumption against the simulated data for comparison. Passive solar energy savings vary over the heating season, therefore it was desirable that calibration is based on an entire heating season. KFLFK"8%#)':&"3,)"!&&%&&5%*#" Solar heat gain contributes to the heating requirement of nearly all houses. This can include direct, ground, or sky reflected solar gain through windows, or solar gain elevating the exterior surface temperature of the building. This can lead to confusion when discussing the energy savings from passive solar and brings into question what is an appropriate baseline scenario to use. The term solar fraction is often used in literature pertaining to both passive and active solar. The solar fraction is a standard metric in the active solar field and is defined as the fraction of the load met by solar. For direct gain passive solar, the solar fraction can be ambiguous because the heating load changes with increased window area. Two more precise metrics that have been used to describe the contribution of solar gains to the energy balance of a building are the solar heating fraction (SHF) and solar savings fraction (SSF) (Jones 1992). The SSF is the fractional energy savings relative to "a similar non-solar building." Jones (1992) describes the most precise definition to this baseline being "a conventional building that satisfies the same architectural program as does the solar building but that has no solar collection area beyond the normal complement of windows" (Jones 1992, p.237). However, a simpler definition which is widely accepted is a building "in which

19

the passive solar heating apertures are replaced by perfectly insulated walls" (Jones 1992, p.237). The SHF has a less ambiguous definition. It is defined as the fractional energy savings relative to the heating energy requirement of the building for a scenario where there is no solar heat gain through the solar heating apertures, but there is heat loss through these apertures (Jones 1992). This is equivalent to the solar apertures being fully shaded. For this research the SHF metric is used because its definition is more precise than that of the solar savings fraction. In addition the SHF is more commonly used in closely related literature (eg. CMHC 1998). The solar heating fraction was determined for each design scenario by also simulating a duplicate scenario were the solar gain is effectively switched off by setting the solar transmittance of the outer glazing layer to zero, and reflectance to 99.9%. This scenario, referred to as `shaded' is then used to calculate the percent reduction in space heating energy consumption due to solar gain. This can be formulated as follows: SHF = (EShaded ­ EUnshaded)/(EShaded) (3-5)

This chapter describes the calibration of the reference case model to measured data from the CCHT Reference House. The reference case model was calibrated using measured daily gas consumption data from the CCHT Reference House for the 2002/2003 heating season and a validated weather file (AMY) from Weather Analytics which is based on real data from nearby weather stations and climate model data (Keller and Khuen 2011). Measured foundation temperature data was used to calibrate the ground heat transfer model, which produces average exterior foundation temperatures. Temperature data was also used as a constraint when adjusting furnace airflow to slave zones.

Calibration is defined not only by good agreement between simulated and measured heating energy consumption for an annual period, but also by agreement at a finer temporal resolution. In this case, daily comparisons were deemed to be most appropriate. In addition to matching heating energy consumption, which is the main parameter of interest, simulated temperatures are matched with measured data wherever possible. All model input parameters were tested parametrically to determine their significance. Significant input parameters are based on known or measured data wherever possible, or best assumptions available from literature review (uncertain parameters are used in the final stage of calibration). As the CCHT houses undergo extensive research, data was available to define most major modelling parameters, such as internal gains, measured furnace efficiency, and actual furnace fan flow rate. A principle focus of the calibration process involved 21

systematically identifying and fixing minor errors, and adding more detail to components of the model that had a significant effect on the annual heating energy consumption. The calibration procedure is a highly iterative process. Throughout this process parameters with a high level of uncertainty are noted. These `adjustable' parameters are later used in the "fine tuning" stage, by varying their input values within the range of uncertainty to achieve a better match in heating energy consumption. Such `adjustable' parameters included the furnace airflow rates to each zone, wind driven infiltration parameters, the monthly basement air temperature profile assumption (used the by the Basement program) and the soil properties. An overview of the calibration processed developed and used for this research is shown in Error! Reference source not ound..

EnergyPlus has undergone several revisions over the course of this thesis research, the first single zone model was created using version 6.0, for the second model version 7.0 was used, and version 7.2 was used for the final model.

The architecture of the CCHT houses is shown below in Figure 2. It includes a double car garage and a heated basement. The design includes many jogs and a complex roofline ­ features that are common in new construction in North America, but not ideal for low energy design.

Walls are not represented by any physical thickness in EnergyPlus. According to the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference Manual (2012) the choice of interior, exterior or centred dimensions has little impact of the simulation model. Dimensions to the exterior of the thermal envelope were used, rather than to the exterior of the rain screen brick veneer. 27

Minor geometric simplifications were made to reduce the number of surfaces modelled without reducing the building's surface area, such as shifting some of the minor inset wall elements outwards to combine with the surrounding walls. This was primarily done on the North façade, where the impact on solar gain would not be affected significantly. The as-modelled geometry is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5: CCHT As Modelled - Isometric View From South (Note ­ Ground Plane is Not Shown)

The purple surfaces shown in Figure 5 (above) are shading surface. These surfaces also reflect solar gain, therefore reflectance values were assigned as described in Section 4.3.6. Originally the CCHT Reference house was modelled as four zones, with the entire living spaced modelled as one zone (referred to in this research as single zone) . The basement, which is heated, was modelled as a slave zone (further described in Section 4.3.8). The garage and attic were the remaining two zones, which are unheated.

28

For the final version of the model, the living space was divided into multiple zones for the following reasons: 1. To allow for the use of the interior solar distribution option, which requires zones to be convex (defined by a straight line passing through the zone not intersecting more than two surfaces). 2. To account for temperature differences between zones, to allow for potential overheating can be more accurately quantified, and to improve the accuracy of the heat balance. 3. To allow for the addition of passive ventilation at the zone level, linked to the occupancy schedule to limit overheating during the heating season (further described in Section 5.2.3).

Thermal zoning is often considered to be an `art' (O'Brien et al. 2011). No standardized procedure exists for defining the number or location of thermal zones. However, a five zone model is generally considered sufficient for accurately predicting the energy consumption and assessing the potential for overheating in passive solar houses (O'Brien et al. 2011). For the baseline model eight heated zones were created in order to satisfy the non-convex zone requirement of the interior solar distribution. Two zones on the second floor (South 2b and 2c; refer to Figures 6 and 7) were modelled effectively as one zone by defining a high air exchange between them (1 m3/s.) These zones are connected by large openings, but did not satisfy the non-convex zone requirement unless modelled as separate zones. The building was divided into zones by floor level, and along major partition walls were possible. When determining zone 29

boundaries, consideration was given to the size of openings between spaces. The south of the building was divided into more zones, due to the higher expected temperature variations due to the solar exposure. Figures 6 and 7 below show the final CCHT floor plan as modelled, and the thermal zoning.

EnergyPlus will automatically calculate the zone air volumes based on the input geometry, however the actual zone air volumes are often much smaller due to the space occupied by partition walls, furnishings, and exterior walls if geometry is input based on exterior dimensions. For the multi-zone model a 0.6% difference in predicted furnace gas consumption was observed when manually calculated zone volumes were entered (including all walls, and approximate values for included furnishings such as counters, appliances etc.).

All materials were modelled using average input parameters from ASHRAE (2009 F.26) for density, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Using ASHRAE's values led to lower calculated thermal resistance values than the nominal overall values listed in the project drawings; it is expected that the lower values are more realistic of field conditions, whereas the values given in the drawings are likely based on manufacturer's data from laboratory testing. Density and heat capacity originally were modelled using values for fiberglass insulation, however in the final model an area weighted average for fiberglass and wood framing was used. The vented exterior rain screen cavity and the drained interior foundation cavity were both modelled as an air gap with simple thermal resistance (and no thermal mass), which was assumed to be 50% less than that of a sealed cavity. This approach is recommended by BRANZ (2004). 33

Interior partitions in the CCHT Houses are typical hollow stud walls. The partition walls were originally modelled as two sheets of gypsum drywall separated by an air cavity. For the final version of the model the properties at the centre of the partition wall assembly was entered as an area weighed average of the properties for wood framing and air for 15% framing. This allowed for the thermal mass of the studs to be included in the model. This changed the predicted heating energy consumption by only 0.1%. Thermal bridging through the wood framing members was accounted for by calculating a one dimensional area-weighted equivalent heat transfer coefficient by combining the thermal resistance of the framing with the insulation in parallel according to the Isothermal Planes method (ASHRAE 2009 F.27.3). This is formulated as follows: Ueff = Uf x (Af / Aw) + Uins x (Af /Aw) (4-1)

This is then converted into a thermal conductivity value for input into EnergyPlus. Two-dimensional edge effects were neglected. Thermal bridging was accounted for in all major construction assemblies, with the above grade walls divided into walls, with windows and without ­ to account for extra framing members required around windows. The fraction of framing for each wall type was based on a representative wall of each type, and a framing diagram created using stud spacing from the `as built' drawings assuming standard framing techniques. All framing members were taken into account (studs, cripples, jacks, double top plate, single bottom plate and corner posts). Only accounting for studs when calculating the fraction of thermal bridging, could lead to severe underestimation. For example, the framing fraction if only typical vertical studs are considered is 9.5% (for the CCHT stud spacing of 400 mm.) However, using the more 34

detailed approach, described previously, results in significantly higher framing fractions, as shown in Table 2 below.

During updates made in the final model, a calculation error was discovered related to the percent thermal bridging for the walls with windows.

Conductive heat flow through thermally massive materials exhibits dynamic behaviour, which must be accurately modelled to assess the effectiveness of most passive solar designs. The most commonly used computational method for modelling transient thermal conduction is the conduction transfer function (CTF). Recently, other options for modelling conduction have been added to EnergyPlus, such as the finite difference method and a combined heat air and moisture algorithm. The conduction transfer function is based on the basic time series approach, known as the response factor equation, which relates heat flux at a surface of an element to an infinite series of temperature histories at both sides of the element. The conduction transfer function solves the time series equation by replacing the higher order terms with 35

The outside reveal depth is 125 mm (Gusdorf et al. 2011) and includes the brick veneer. This depth is enough to shade a considerable portion of the windows during early spring, when heat gain is still desired. Entering the detailed reveal, sill and frame projection parameters resulted in a 4.4% difference in heating energy consumption.

Room side convection from the glazing is calculated in accordance with ISO 15099, and assumes the room air is still. This inherent modelling simplification causes an underestimation of window heat loss as in reality convection currents often develop along window surfaces due to the colder temperatures. EnergyPlus accounts for the inside surface temperature of the window, the fluid properties of the air at the window height and the zone conditions. For a detailed explanation and list of equations refer to EnergyPlus Engineering Reference (2012 p. 264).

LFKFV"9,21)"I'&#)'=4#',*" EnergyPlus provides five options for modelling solar distribution. The simplest (MinimalShadowing) option assumes that all direct solar radiation that enters the building falls on the floor, where a portion is absorbed and the remainder is reflected. The direct solar reflected by the floor is added to the transmitted diffuse radiation, which is evenly distributed amongst all surfaces interior surfaces in the zone. Initially, the FullExterior option was used, which is similar to the MinimalShadowing option but takes into account shading from exterior surfaces such as overhangs and building self shading. During the calibration stage of the second version of the model, the solar distribution was changed to FullExteriorWithReflections to increase accuracy by adding the following details: · solar radiation (both direct and diffuse) that is reflected from shadowing surfaces such as overhangs · the reduction of ground reflected radiation due to the presence of surfaces which shade the ground (ground is not considered unobstructed as in other cases) · solar reflected from other parts of the building (EnergyPlus Engineering Reference 2012) During calibration of the second single zone model it was noted that the addition of the `WithReflections' model increased the energy consumption by 1.1% or 0.75 GJ with only a minor increase in simulation time. The most advanced option for modelling the solar distribution in EnergyPlus is the FullInteriorAndExteriorWithReflections option, this model calculates the amount of direct solar radiation that falls on each interior surface by projecting sun rays through the 40

exterior windows. This option can only be used for models with convex zones. Initially this option seemed to increase simulation time considerably. Prior to creation of the multi-zone model the effect of the interior solar distribution option was investigated, for the Advanced house model (described in Section 5.1.2), as this model features convex zones. Simulated furnace gas consumption was reduced by 0.8% when the interior solar distribution model was used, however the simulation time increased by a factor of three. It was unknown if this difference would be larger or smaller for the CCHT house, therefore the floor plan was divided into thermal zones in way that would satisfy the convex zone criteria so that the interior solar distribution could be used. For the final multi-zone CCHT model the difference was much smaller, a 0.1% increase in gas consumption with the interior distribution option and no noticeable change in simulation time. The interior solar distribution option was used in all final simulations. LFKFW"9,21)"!=&,)(#',*" Early research in passive solar concluded that energy savings are not very sensitive to the solar absorptance of interior surfaces (Jones 1992). As such, for the initial models it was assumed that the effect of accurate solar absorptance would not have a large effect on the simulation results as much of the radiation reflected by interior surfaces will land on other surfaces, provided window areas are not too large. However, further review of solar absorptance was undertaken for the final model to eliminate any potential error associated with this assumption, especially for cases with higher window areas. Literature review was carried out to identify more accurate absorptance values for the materials used in the CCHT house, and these values were updated for the multi-zone 41

model. The updated values used for solar absorptance are given in Table 3 below, and along with a summary of the relevant literature.

Shading, such as overhangs, can reflect ground reflected radiation and direct beam radiation onto windows depending on the window location and sun angle.

LFKFX"G*3'2#)1#',*"8,+%2" During the initial modelling, it was observed that the energy consumption of the CCHT house is highly sensitive to the choice of infiltration model. Initially, infiltration was modelled using the design flow rate model, which uses coefficients to modify a set air change rate based on changes in temperature and wind speed. Little guidance is provided in the EnergyPlus documentation on how to select appropriate coefficients, however the coefficients from DOE and BLAST (two EnergyPlus predecessors) are provided. An increase in predicted heating energy consumption of 28% was observed when the DOE coefficients were replaced with the BLAST coefficients. Due to this uncertainty a different method of modelling infiltration was required. Detailed blower door test results for the CCHT Reference House, were provided by the CCHT (Armstrong email communication), which allowed infiltration to be modelled with the ASHRAE (2009) enhanced model (ZoneInfiltration:FlowCoefficient), which is based on the AIM-2 model (originally formulated by Walker and Wilson 1998, described in ASHRAE 2009 F.16.23). The enhanced model uses an empirically tested superposition technique to combine wind and stack effect, shown below in Equation 4-3. Q = (Qw2 + Qs 2)1/2 43 (4-3)

Where the airflow from wind and stack are calculated using Equations 4-4 and 4-5. Qs = c Cs"tn Qw = c Cw(sU)2n (4-4) (4-5)

The flow coefficient and pressure exponent, c and n, were determined using the results from the blower door test (2005 data). The shelter factor is an empirical coefficient given by ASHRAE (2009) based on 5 categories for `shelter class', for the CCHT house a value of 0.7 was chosen initially, based on "typical shelter caused by buildings across the street". However, there is some uncertainty associated with this parameter, as a difference in judgment could lead to a value of 0.9 if class 4 is chosen ("typical shelter for an isolated rural house), thus the potential flexibility of this parameter was considered during calibration. The enhanced infiltration model is a single zone infiltration model, therefore it was necessary to allocate a fraction of the total infiltration to each zone for the final multi-zone CCHT reference model. It was assumed that 70% of the total infiltration occurs around windows and door frame edges, and the remaining infiltration is proportional to exposed exterior envelope area. Each zone fraction of total infiltration was calculated as a weighted average according to the fraction of total fenestration frame length in a given zone (multiplied by a weighting factor of 70%), and the fraction of total exposed exterior envelope area for the zone. This approach is similar to that used by Villi et al. (2012), with the 70% value based on findings from field measurements of Finnish house by Kalamees et al. (2008). 44

LFKFY"OZ!A"9.&#%5" The main simulation components involved in the HVAC system included air terminals, which regulate the maximum air flow rate to each heated zone, the furnace fan, heating coil, and heat recovery ventilator. Fresh air is circulated through the HVAC ducting, after passing through a heat recovery ventilator (HRV). A schematic for HVAC system is provided in Figure 13 (earlier model versions) and Figure 14 (later versions). The CCHT Reference house has a typical residential forced-air gas furnace system. There is one centrally located thermostat (located in the control zone). The remaining zones are slave zones, the heat delivered to these zones is determined by a pre-set constant fraction of furnace airflow and is only available when heat is required in the control zone. The actual thermostat set point is 22°C, with a 2°C dead band below the set point. According to measurements by Manning et al. (2007) an average of 21°C is maintained near the thermostat location. EnergyPlus does not include a simulation object for a thermostat dead band, therefore 21°C was used.

The main input for the furnace heating coil is the coil efficiency, which is 80.2% according to CCHT measurements for the 2002 / 2003 heating season. The fraction of total furnace airflow to each zone was determined initially by the floor area of the zone, and then later adjusted during calibration to match measured temperature data where 46

possible (for the basement and south 2a zones) or expected zone temperatures where data was not available. The reference house uses a Venmar heat recovery ventilator. Input parameters were determined from product documentation. The HRV used has a sensible effectiveness of 84%, and 0% latent effectiveness. Defrosting is accomplished via exhaust air circulation which is active at -5°C. C1*"8,+%2" The CCHT furnace fan provides warm air at 622 L/s when the furnace heating coil is on, and circulates air at 454 L/s when the furnace heating coil is off. The circulation mode distributes the fresh air to each zone and also helps distribute solar heat from the south zones to cooler zones. Originally the fan was simulated to cycle on and off with the furnace heating coil and capturing the behaviour of the circulation mode was unnecessary due to the fully mixed air inherent in the zone air balance. However, this was not the case for the final multi-zone model. A cycling fan could not be modelled in conjunction with the outdoor air system (which integrates ventilation through the HRV) due to limitations in the program. As such, continual fan operation was simulated. Based on detailed hourly furnace gas consumption data provided by M. Armstrong of the CCHT (email communication), during January (2003) the furnace fan ran at high speed 94% of the time. Given this, modelling the furnace fan as a constant volume fan running at high speed was deemed to be a valid approximation. The implications of this assumption are that interzonal airflow due to fan driven air circulation is overestimated by 5 to 26 L/s depending on the zone, during periods where the fan would actually be in circulation mode. 47

The furnace fan has a considerable impact on the furnace gas consumption. Gusdorf et al. (2002) evaluated two types of fan motors in the CCHT houses, and found that the more efficient (ECM) fan motor resulted in a 14% increase in gas consumption due to reduced electrical heat gain. The CCHT Reference house uses a furnace fan with a permanent split capacitor motor (PCM), which is relatively inefficient but provides significant heat gains. The fan electricity power consumption is approximately 350 W for circulation and 490 W for heating mode. Due to size of the furnace fan heat gains it was necessary to ensure these gains were accurately modelled. For the multi-zone model, the gains were added to the airstream so that they are distributed in the correct proportions to each of the zones. The fan model used (Fan:OnOff) includes the following input parameters: · · · · overall fan efficiency motor efficiency fraction of motor heat gains in airstream pressure rise

Phillips (1998) recorded fan pressure rises of 75 to 175 Pa for Canadian furnaces installed after 1990. Additional pressure rise due to dirty filters ranged from 20 to 100 Pa, and an average of 21 Pa was observed for systems with AC coils. Phillips (1998) recommends 175 Pa as a realistic value for furnace AFUE rating, this value was used in the model due to the absence of furnace pressure rise data for the CCHT Reference house. In the first two version of the model, 125 Pa was used, based on a study on US furnaces (Lutz et al. 2004). However, for the final model this was changed to 175 Pa to 48

be consistent with measured data from Phillips (1998). A 1.2% difference in furnace gas consumption occurred when the pressure was changed from 125 Pa to 175 Pa, when the furnace fan heat gains were modelled as general equipment heat gain. This can be explained by the heat generated by the air pressure increase from the fan. Although in reality the furnace fan pressure rise affects the airflow rate, in EnergyPlus airflow is a set input parameter, therefore only fan energy consumption is affected by a change in furnace fan pressure. It was assumed that 100% of the motor heat gains are transferred to the airstream. Although, in reality some of these gains will be transferred to the zone surrounding the fan, it is expected that this amount is small. The overall fan efficiency was calculated based on the flow rate and total power in as follows: Power to Fluid = Volume Flow Rate * Fan Pressure Rise Overall Fan Efficiency = Power to Fluid / Electrical Power In (EnergyPlus Input/Output Reference 2012) The value used for electrical power in is the measured power draw of the CCHT furnace fan and the HRV supply fan electricity input (M. Armstrong email communication). The HRV supply fan gains were combined with the furnace fan to simplify the model input. LFKF["G*#%)\,*12"!')32,?" The significance of interzonal airflow is highlighted by the following example. For a case with a 3.3°C temperature difference Balcomb and Jones (1985) show that heat transfer from natural convection through a 914 mm door can be five times greater than 49 (4-6) (4-7)

the heat transfer through a standard un-insulated partition wall 3 m x 6 m. Balcomb et al. (1977, cited in O'Brien et al. 2011) report airflow rates of 0.3 to 1.05 m3/s through doors during sunny periods, equating to a heat transfer of up to 6kW. Balcomb and Jones (1985) studied airflow inside 15 passive solar buildings, and determined the following empirical equation for volumetric airflow rate through doorways: V = 0.0368 w (h3 "T)1/2 (4-8)

For a standard 813 mm door with a height of 2030 mm, a temperature difference of 1°C results in 87 L/s of airflow, and a temperature difference of 2°C results in 122 L/s of airflow. !"#$%&'()*+'&#,( EnergyPlus features a detailed airflow network model that accounts for the effect of buoyancy, wind pressure, wind direction (EnergyPlus Engineering Reference 2012) and mechanical air distribution systems. The EnergyPlus airflow network model has been validated with data from the ORNL test facility. Gu (2007) found that the predicted airflows were within 4.1% of measured data. For a test building the predicted air conditioning energy requirement was approximately 12% less than measured data for a case with supply leaks (Gu 2007). Several airflow network models were developed and tested for the following situations encountered in this study: · · interzonal airflow due to buoyancy interzonal airflow due to HVAC air distribution 50

·

surface level infiltration in relation to both internal and external air pressures

and flows · zone level passive ventilation through operable windows

Interzonal airflows are very complex. Although, the airflow network model in EnergyPlus is quite detailed, often uncertainty of input parameters limits the accuracy of the calculation. It would not be realistic to capture the dynamics of all of the interzonal airflow in the CCHT house. The following parameters have significant uncertainty, which would limit the accuracy of the airflow network model: · · · actual location of cracks are unknown duct leakage actual discharge coefficients of openings are unknown

In addition, the author found that the solution algorithm used in the airflow network has limitations with regard to the selection input variables (also confirmed by Lixing Gu (EnergyPlus Support) email communication November 30th 2012). The airflow network solution would not converge for many of the desired values for the input variables, and that very high convergence tolerance values were required. After over two weeks of model development and troubleshooting, it was determined that the airflow network model was not suitable for this study. For the multi-zone model, only the interzonal airflow part of the airflow network would converge and even for this case much higher convergence tolerance parameters than the default values were required, which brings into question the accuracy of the airflow network model.

-./"#"01%(!//#&102(+&(34+*#5&41%(!"#$%&'( In the final model, a stronger empirical approach was taken to simulate heat transfer due to interzonal airflow. EnergyPlus contains simplified airflow modelling options, including objects such as the zone cross mixing object, which exchanges heat between zones based on an airflow rate, which can be turned on at a given temperature difference. The limitation of this approach is that only one cross mixing object is allowed per zone. Another simplified approach is that taken by Meldem and Winklemann (1995), where heat transfer from airflow through an internal opening (such as a hallway) is modelled using an overall heat transfer coefficient. The advantage of this approach is that the heat transfer rate is proportional to temperature difference. To overcome the limitation of only one zone cross mixing object per zone, the heat transfer coefficient approach was used for smaller interzonal openings. As with most simulation programs, omitting a surface is equivalent to omitting the heat transfer that would occur through the surface, therefore a surface was required for each of the interzonal openings (doorways, hallways, staircase). The openings were modelled as glass, with very high transmittance, high emissivity, high long wave transmittance and very low thermal resistance. A significant amount of air exchange already occurs between the zones from the continuous operation of the furnace fan. During circulation mode this is equivalent to an airflow rate of 15 to 71 L/s per zone, depending on the size of the zone. All zones have a return air vent, except for the first floor south zones (South 1a/b). Because the furnace fan was modelled with it containing a continuous flow rate of 622 L/s (high speed), the base interzonal airflow is overestimated when the furnace coil is off by approximately 5 to 26 52

L/s per zone. The final interzonal airflow input parameters are summarized below in Table 5.

This can be explained by the base level of interzonal airflow that is already occurring due to the continuous operation of the furnace fan, and the HVAC set up where only one zone is controlled. Interzonal airflows occurring between slave zones do not have a large effect on the heat loss of the control zone. A more noticeable effect was noticed on air temperature of the south facing slave zones, with reductions in peak temperatures of approximately 2°C occurring with the addition of interzonal airflow.

LFKFE]"J),4*+"A,*#1:#"O%1#"@)1*&3%)" Although ground contact heat transfer is not directly related to passive solar, it is a large source of heat loss for typical Canadian houses with heated basements, such as the CCHT reference house. During initial modelling it was found that ground temperature assumptions have a large influence on energy consumption, this was also observed by Purdy and Beausoleil-Morrison (2001) who also modelled the CCHT house. Because of this, and the significant variability in ground temperatures across Canadian climates, Basement was used to calculate 3 dimensional ground contact heat transfer. Basement is a pre-processor auxiliary program for EnergyPlus, which produces monthly temperature profiles for the exterior of the foundation wall and floor slab using a finite difference model (EnergyPlus Auxiliary Programs 2012). These temperatures are used in the onedimensional conduction equations used in the energy balance calculations carried out by EnergyPlus. One of the most sensitive input parameters for Basement is the monthly interior temperature profile. The results of long-term basement temperature measurements for the CCHT Reference House are presented in Armstrong et al. (2011). Graphs from Armstrong et al. (2011) were interpolated to develop a monthly basement air temperature profile, and an average exterior foundation temperature profile used to calibrate Basement. Basement does not allow for interior foundation insulation, therefore to account for the interior insulation in the CCHT house, the thermal resistance of the interior foundation insulation was combined with, and entered as, the horizontal convective heat transfer coefficient in the basement input. Soil properties were estimated through the calibration procedure, outlined in Section 4.5. 54

Originally the garage slab was modelled as adiabatic, for the final model this assumption was revised and the EnergyPlus Slab auxiliary program was used to estimate the sub-slab temperatures. Convergence of the solution algorithm could not be achieved using the calibrated soil properties used in Basement, therefore default input parameters had to be used. The reason for this instability in the Slab program is unknown. Similar to Basement, the results of Slab are highly dependent on the zone air temperature profile. The air temperature in the garage varies widely as it is unheated, therefore the simulation was run several times to iteratively determine the monthly air temperature profile input. The addition of Slab results into the simulation model, increased the heating energy consumption by 0.1% LFKF["A,*0%:#',*"!27,)'#$5&" Convective heat transfer from surfaces plays an important role in the discharging of heat stored in thermal mass, and is therefore important to model accurately when estimating the savings from passive solar houses. EnergyPlus offers many choices for convection algorithms, many of which come from EnergyPlus's predecessor programs (eg. DOE-2, TARP). The most detailed of these options is the adaptive convection algorithm, an algorithm which selects the most appropriate convection model from a range of models including many recent studies (EnergyPlus Engineering Reference 2012). For exterior convection, the adaptive convection algorithm chooses the most appropriate algorithm from over 20 options, depending on the direction of heat flow, the wind direction, wind speed and type of surface. In all algorithms when the weather file indicates the occurrence of rain, a convective heat transfer coefficient of 1000 W/m2K is used for all surfaces exposed to wind. 55

The adaptive convection algorithm for interior convection functions in a similar way to its exterior counterpart. However, it is more detailed and has many more algorithms to choose from, taking into account the expected flow regime based on HVAC system type as well as the surface type (exterior wall, partition, ceiling, floor, etc). The assumption for forced HVAC air distribution is limited to ceiling air diffusers; there are no algorithm options for floor heat registers so airflow regimes are assumed to be driven by simple buoyancy. This results in the convective heat transfer coefficients being underestimated in regions close to the heat registers. However, it is not expected that this has a large effect on the overall results. For the first single zone model, the TARP algorithm was used for interior convection and the DOE-2 algorithm was used for exterior convection. After further review of the model and EnergyPlus documentation, both of these were changed to the Adaptive Convection Algorithm. Changing the inside convection algorithm reduced furnace gas consumption by 8%, this is likely explained by the increase heat transfer (i.e. effectiveness) in and out of heat storage surfaces. When the outside convection algorithm was changed a 5% increase occurred, which is likely caused by more accurate consideration of wind effects.

This section provides a summary of other simulation inputs and assumptions made which were expected to have a relatively small contribution to the overall heat balance.

LFLFE"G*#%)*12"J1'*&" Internal gains were modelled using a time schedule, a power level (W), an assigned zone, and fractions to portion the internal gain amongst the various possible heat transfer mechanisms. These include latent, radiant, convective, and in some cases fraction lost. The internal gains were modelled based on the original internal gains schedule for the CCHT houses (Swinton et al. 2001). However in the final model, detailed measured data for a sample day in January 2003 were used. In the final model, after reviewing the detailed internal gain data, 723 W of continuous heat gain was added to the garage, for the control and monitoring equipment installed in the reference house. Such discrepancies, led to an increase of 7.7% in heating energy consumption. The CCHT Houses include simulated heat gain from people, using incandescent light bulbs. Using guidelines from EnergyPlus's Engineering Reference manual, it was assumed that 90% of this heat gain is radiant, and the remaining 10% is convective. The reference house includes 450 W of lights, and all standard appliances (stove, washer, dryer, fridge). It was assumed that 70% of the dryer energy input is lost (vented), the dryer is located in the middle of the house therefore some heat will transferred through the house from the ducting, and from the dryer itself (i.e. the remaining 30%). Domestic hot water consumption was difficult to allocate to the various heat transfer mechanisms. No literature was found to guide how the DHW consumption gains should be allocated. It was assumed that 60% of the hot water energy input is lost (down the drain), and 20% is latent heat gain.

LFLFH"@'5%&#%(&" Even though the standard weather data used for energy simulation is only available on hourly intervals, using timesteps of less than one hour does considerably increases simulation accuracy. This is because EnergyPlus interpolates weather conditions between timesteps, and the transient response of a building and its systems can occur over relatively short time periods. For example, internal gains and the effect of thermal mass often require an increase in frequency of timesteps to accurately capture their contribution to the overall heat balance (EnergyPlus Input Output Reference 2012). More timesteps per hour typically increases accuracy, but can also significantly increase simulation time. For the first model, 4 timesteps per hour were used. This was later increased to 10 timesteps per hour for the second version of the model, and for the remaining model development. Twenty timesteps per hour was tested for the second version of the model, and found to reduce the estimated gas consumption by 0.6 ­ 0.8%, however this doubled the simulation time. For the final calibration stage and simulation 30 timesteps per hour was used, with a resulting typical simulation time of approximately 8 minutes. LFLFK"9$1+,?"A12:421#',*"C)%64%*:." Shading is calculated based on the building geometry and sun angles. The default option in EnergyPlus updates the shadow size every 20 days based on changes to the sun angle. A 10 day update was tested for the multi-zone version of reference case and it was found that the effect was very small (less than 0.1%) and the simulation time increase was slight (13 seconds or 6%). Due to the relatively small impact on simulation time, a 10 day update frequency was used for the multi-zone model. 58

LFLFL"J),4*+"-%32%:#1*:%" The ground reflectance was modelled using monthly values, based on recommendations from Thevenard and Haddad (2006). Monthly average ground reflectivity was assumed to be 0.26, which is a typical value for green grass. The SnowModifier object was used to change the ground reflectivity to 0.65 when snow is present, based on the snow fall indicators included in the weather files. Uncertainty in these values was considered during calibration. Snow indicators were not available in the AMY weather file used for calibration, thus were added from the TMY weather file.

This section provides a more detailed account of the calibration of major sub models and the final calibration process (as shown in the calibration process flow chart, Figure 1). LFVFE"G*'#'12"A12'=)1#',*" Calibration was based on comparison of daily furnace gas consumption data measured at the CCHT house in the 2002/2003 heating season. The data set provided by the CCHT included 203 data points, which spans the heating season but does not include every day as some data points were missing. The furnace gas consumption at the CCHT is measured as a volume flow rate, and was converted by the CCHT to an energy value using a heating value for natural gas of 37.3 MJ/m3 provided by the gas utility (M. Armstrong personal communication December 20th 2011). Because of the significant effect of ground heat transfer, the model was first calibrated with on-site ground temperature data. The foundation wall temperature profile 59

was developed based on data measured at five depths along the foundation wall from Armstrong et al. (2011) and approximated as a sinusoidal function using the maximum and minimum temperatures measured for the corresponding calibration year. Monthly values were used for the building surface ground temperature input in EnergyPlus. The heat transfer from the foundation walls was modelled using these temperatures and the basement floor was assumed to be 14.5°C; equal to the temperature measured at the bottom of a stud on the interior side of the foundation wall. This assumption was made based on the lack of further data, with the plan to further verify during the calibration. After this step, each major component of the model was reviewed, and various simulation outputs (such as mass flow rates, basement temperature set point, heat transfer through windows, walls etc.) were examined. After simulated gas consumption was close to measured data (approx. +/- 5%), the EnergyPlus Basement auxiliary program was calibrated then added, as it is required for the other locations examined (as illustrated in Figure 1, Section 4.1). LFVFH"<1&%5%*#"A12'=)1#',*" Basement calibration parameters include thermal properties of the soil, which can vary considerably, concrete thermal properties parameters, and basement air temperatures. Because the basement air temperature was measured 30cm below the ceiling, stratification was not accounted for. Therefore, it was assumed that the fully mixed temperatures, which EnergyPlus simulates, could be slightly cooler than the measured values. This was taken into consideration when "fine tuning" the basement duct size. The final combination of parameters that gave the best calibration statistics resulted in basement temperatures approximately 0.5 to 1°C cooler than measured. The final 60

calibrated basement temperatures are shown below in Figure 15, along with a sine curve generated from the interpolated average maximum and minimum measured foundation temperatures from Armstrong et al. (2011).

Temperature data for the basement air temperature was measured by Armstrong et al. (2011). The highest temperatures typically occur in the south upstairs bedroom (South 2a Zone) as shown in a 10 day temperature profile for February 2006 (Manning et al. 2008). These measured temperatures were compared with the simulated temperatures for this zone and used to ensure that air terminal size ratios and heat transfer due to interzonal airflow were realistically approximated. Although weather data and gas consumption data

from 2003 is used, and the measured temperatures are for 2006, it is expected that similar temperatures will occur in either year on sunny days. Temperatures measured at mid-room height during February 2006 (Manning et al. 2008) varies between approximately 20.1°C and 27.2°C. The simulated temperatures correlate well for a February week with several sunny days, reporting simulated temperatures varying between approximately 20.2°C to 27.8°C for the multi-zone model before calibration. It is important to note the simulated air temperatures using the airflow network model for interzonal heat transfer did not match the measured values nearly as well as for the multi-zone model without the airflow network. This indicates that the interzonal airflow due to buoyancy does not have a large impact on the overall energy balance. Also, during sunny periods the furnace coil is typically off, and the fan would be operating in circulation mode. However, as modelled, the fan is always in heating mode, hence the air circulation between each zones is overestimated when the furnace coil is off, which may account for some of the interzonal buoyancy and convection driven airflow that occurs in reality.

During the final stage of calibration these parameters were varied within a range of values recommended by literature to `fine tune' the calibration until the lowest CV(RMSE) value was reached.

As discussed in Section 3.4.2, to the best of the author's knowledge there are no existing standards for daily calibration. The CV(RMSE) and NMBE values for the three versions of the model are summarized below in Table 7. The first version being a simple single zone model which used the simple window model and several minor input errors. The second version being a more detailed single zone model using the detailed layer by layer window model and many revisions. The final version is a detailed multi-zone model which includes interzonal airflow.

The proposed CV(RMSE) target of 22.5% was not met for the first version of the model, however it likely could have been met with the same modelling approach if the input errors that were later discovered were eliminated. For the second and final versions of the model the CV(RMSE) target was exceeded considerably. In all cases the NMBE 63

target of 7.5% was exceeded by an order of magnitude. The NMBE was not found to be a very relevant metric in this research. The daily simulated furnace gas consumption for the final calibrated model is shown with the measured data below in Figure 16 (for an enlarged version refer to Appendix A).

Energy simulation requires careful selection of input parameters, and model choices. Many input parameters were found to significantly affect the simulation results. Model choices and parameters that were found to have the largest influence on the simulated furnace gas consumption are summarized below in Table 8.

The choice of infiltration model is critical in accurately predicting the heating energy consumption. The choice of window model is also very important, especially when modelling passive solar. It is important to include all framing members when quantifying thermal bridging and to separate walls with windows from those without. Internal gains provide a considerable portion of the heat balance. The adaptive convection algorithm provides a more sophisticated treatment of convection with no noticeable increase in simulation time. Modelling the interior solar distribution using ray projection had a relatively small effect on the results compared to the exterior distribution option which assumes all beam radiation lands on the floor, and is then evenly redistributed according to surface properties. However, given that it did not increase simulation time, its use is justified in this research. 65

Using the conduction transfer function model is an appropriate choice for modelling high mass passive solar houses, as no noticeable difference in simulation results occurred when the conduction finite difference algorithm was used. Other solar parameters such as the shadow position update frequency, solar absoptance and reflectance values had only a minor influence on simulation results. However, for many minor parameters detailed consideration seems appropriate if simulation time is not affected considerably and if the parameter is of particular interest to the study. Using the airflow network for the CCHT house was found to be impractical (version 7.2 of EnergyPlus). Assumptions regarding natural interzonal airflow did not have a big impact on the simulation results in this study (approx. less than 1%), which is most likely due to the high rate of forced air circulation between zones. While a considerable improvement in the calibration (according to the CV(RMSE)) was achieved between the first and second version, only a relatively small difference was achieved by upgrading to the more detailed multi-zone model. It is expected that the proposed CV(RMSE) target of 22.5% for daily calibration would be easily met when calibrated other residential energy models. For this research it was feasible to achieve a CV(RMSE) value of 18.4% with a single zone model, and 17.1% with the multi-zone model. There are some limitations with projecting how calibration of the CCHT reference house model applies to other single family dwellings, as for many other situations less detailed input and calibration data would be available.

Each basic parameter option is based on the CCHT house as is. Concrete was chosen as the thermal mass material as it is an effect thermal storage medium, and can be 67

integrated into a building as a structural element. Jones (1992) provides a detailed overview on thermal mass thickness and concludes that adding more than 100 mm of concrete for thermal mass has little benefit. The increased window area corresponds to the maximum recommended south window area to floor area ratio for high mass designs according to CMHC (1998). The advanced glazing selected, Serious 7H, is a commonly used window for passive solar houses, including Passive House projects (Allyson Landers, Serious Energy, email communication Aug. 8th 2011). This window has a much lower U value than the existing CCHT windows, but has a lower SHGC. The frames for this window are insulated fibreglass.

This building has a compact shape, a more optimal solar geometry, shown in Figure 17, and increased insulation. North windows have been eliminated for the advanced design, and south windows are increased to a maximum area recommended by passive solar guidelines.

Other input parameters are consistent with the CCHT houses such as the floor area, for the living space, garage and basement. It also has two stories and a basement, with the garage moved to the north façade.

The Advanced house has small 0.3 m overhangs, consistent with the CCHT house. These overhangs are not enough to shade for summer sun, and additional shading features would be required. As discussed in Section 2, large overhangs can reduce useful passive solar gain during the spring when there can still be a considerable requirement for heating. Therefore, only modest overhangs, which do not provide significant shading, were included in the simulation. It may be desirable to add awnings or roll shutters during

69

to reduce cooling energy consumption and overheating during the summer (as described in Laouadi 2010).

For example, the interior floors have the 100 mm concrete thermal mass layer underneath tile or carpet depending on the floor type, which replaces the OSB and airspace.

Adding a layer of concrete to the existing assemblies to increase thermal mass results in a small increase in the overall thermal resistance of the wall. The base exterior wall assembly (R = 3.01 W/m2K) is increased by 3% (0.08 W/m2K) when the concrete thermal mass layer is added. VFHFH"J21\'*7"9'\%"1*+"@.(%" The high south window area scenarios (SWA) have twice the glazing of the regular (CCHT as is) scenarios. Glazing is entered into EnergyPlus by entering the edge of glass coordinates. It was assumed that no extra dividers are required for the larger windows. The south door was replaced with a window to represent a fully glazed door, this was 70

required in order for the south envelope to realistically fit the required increase in window area. The geometry for the high SWA scenarios is shown below in Figure 18.

Figure 18: CCHT High SWA

The advanced glazing was modelled in a consistent way to the existing CCHT glazing, described in Section 4.3.1. A high profile frame was chosen, which is 71 mm, however, it was modelled as 80 mm to be consistent with the CCHT frame dimensions, and to simplify model input. EnergyPlus's detailed window model was used, with inputs based on WINDOW 6 results for the 7H glazing and THERM files provided by Serious Energy (Cain Hathaway, email communication). VFHFK";1&&'0%"Z%*#'21#',*"#,";)%0%*#"Q0%)$%1#'*7" During the course of this research it was decided that passive ventilation should be included in the simulation model to prevent overheating during the heating season. In reality, this is not done for the CCHT house (i.e. no occupants exist to open windows, etc.), however, for typical houses occupants will open windows when they find the conditions too warm, releasing excess heat gain and cooling the building. The concern with neglecting this phenomenon is that the energy savings from passive solar could be overestimated if the simulated thermal mass reaches a higher temperature then it would in 71

reality, and as a result the building remains above the thermostat set point for a longer time period. Accurately modelling the venting of excess solar gain was also a primary motivation for adding thermal zones during model development/calibration. Ventilation was added at the zone level and scheduled according to the zone occupancy schedules based on the simulated occupancy schedule used in the CCHT house. Ventilation was active in a given zone when the temperature in any occupied zone exceeded 25°C, and a temperature difference of more than 0.1°C existed between the zone air temperature and the outdoor temperature. A flow rate of outdoor air of 500 L/s was assumed. This value is based on a typical flow rate observed by Balcomb and Jones (1985) for airflow between zones when significant temperature differences occur. It is highly uncertain what actual ventilation rates would occur when windows are opened, however an accurate value is not relevant to the simulation objective in this case. Rather it is important to ensure that the value used does cool the zone effectively but not overcool it. In most cases overheating occurs during times for which the zone is not occupied, when this occurs it would be both unrealistic and undesirable to vent excess heat. It is unrealistic to expect windows to be opened when a house is unoccupied, unless there is a mechanical system in place to do so. Allowing temperatures to rise during unoccupied periods allows for more heat storage, which results in the building remaining warmer for longer periods and reduces furnace operation time. This approach, of linking venting excess heat gain with the occupancy schedule differs from other recent literature (eg. O'Brien et al. 2011), which tend to assume ventilation is always available and desired.

72

The occupancy schedule is shown below in Figure 19, this schedule also determines the time and zones where venting is available.

Figure 19: Occupancy Schedule

VFK"9'5421#',*",3"!+01*:%+";1&&'0%"9,21)"O,4&%" The Advanced house scenario was originally modelled as two thermal zones with no venting of excess solar gain. During the course of this research it was decided that neglecting the special temperature distribution in the building through the one zone, fully mixed approach, and not venting excess solar gains was likely not realistic. As a result, the Advanced house simulation model was updated to include eight heated zones. Zone level ventilation was added to prevent excessive overheating during occupied periods, as described in Section 5.2.3. Generally, the simulation methodology used is consistent with the typical house scenarios. Due to the change in overall dimensions, it was necessary to modify the zone sizes. The zone floor areas for the ground level are close to those of the CCHT house, however the south zones are much shallower in the advance house due to the more rectangular geometry and the position of the garage. The thermostat was relocated to the North 1, as the change in geometry caused the centre of the building (which is where the thermostat was previously located) to be in the North 1 zone. In addition, it is assumed that a more advanced passive solar house would feature architectural programing, which allows for greater temperature swings in the south facing rooms. Figure 20, shows the zoning and floor plan of the Advanced house. 73

Insulation levels were not increased for the basement walls, and walls between the house and garage, as this walls have much less heat loss than the other parts of the envelope. The window typology simulated contains one intermediate mullion per window, however in reality some windows would likely have two and others would have none. Zone air temperatures were verified initially (simulating using the Ottawa weather file), and furnace airflow rates to each zone were adjusted to ensure the temperature in each slave zone did not fall below 19°C, and had an approximate average of 20°C, or higher for south zones.

In all cases the highest space heating energy consumption is in Yellowknife, and the lowest is in Vancouver. Space heating energy consumption increases with increasing heating degree days, with the exception of Toronto which has lower heating degree days than Halifax yet exhibits higher heating energy consumption.

Figure 24: Solar Heating Fractions: Cooler Locations

The solar heating fraction is typically highest in Halifax, with three exceptions where it is higher in Vancouver. For all locations the high mass, high SWA scenario achieves the highest solar heating fraction of the CCHT design scenarios. The solar factions achieved for the improved scenarios are considerably higher in all locations. In all cases the addition of the advanced glazing lead to a lower SHF. This is likely explained by the lower SHGC. In all cases advanced glazing reduced energy consumption. The Advanced house scenario achieves the highest solar fraction in Ottawa. For all scenarios the SHF is lowest in Yellowknife. A parameter study was conducted on the results to determine the incremental energy savings achieved by changes to each of the three input parameters studied. Because all combinations of the input parameters variables were simulated, for each 79

location there are three pairs of scenarios which only differ by one input parameter. For each of these pairs, the incremental energy savings associated with each given parameter was quantified as a percent reduction relative to the scenario where the given parameter is not present. For example, the savings for thermal mass was calculated as follows for the first scenario pair: % Savings (1) = (ESunTempered ­ EHighMass) / ESunTempered (5-1)

The average reduction in energy consumption due to added thermal mass ranged from 1.4% (in Yellowknife, sun tempered) to 20.2% (in Vancouver), with an average of 8%. The energy savings from thermal mass was largest for the cases with the double glazing, and for higher south window areas. Energy savings from increasing window area ranged from 1.1% (Yellowknife sun tempered) to 25.7% (Halifax, high mass advanced glazing), with an average of 14%. Energy savings from changing to advanced glazing was more modest, ranging from 2.6% (Halifax, high mass) to 15.5% (Vancouver, high SWA), with an average of 8%. VFLFH"Q0%)$%1#'*7"!&&%&&5%*#" Although assessment of thermal comfort and overheating is not a focus of this research, overheating potential was considered to ensure the validity of the results. According to CMHC (1998) occupants will find conditions comfortable if the temperature does not exceed 4°C above the thermostat set point for 4% of the time during sunny periods. Applying this rule to the actual CCHT thermostat set point, of 22°C, 26°C was used as a benchmark for overheating analysis, a value also used in other passive solar 80

studies (eg. CMHC 1998, O'Brien et al. 2011). The advanced house does not exceed 26°C in any zones during occupied periods from the beginning of October to the end of May (which is approximately the heating season), despite the south high glazing to floor area ratio. The temperature profile for the warmest zone (South 2a) for the Advanced house is shown below in Figure 25.

Figure 25: Advanced House Temperature Profile (Zone S2a)

The worst case scenario for overheating is the Sun Tempered High SWA case, the temperature profile for the south 2a, is shown below in Figure 26. The temperature exceeds 30°C routinely during sunny periods throughout most of the heating season, with a maximum temperature of 33.6°C during mid March. Although these temperatures are very high, they appear quite feasible given that temperature peaks of up to 27.2°C have 81

been recorded in the same zone of CCHT house during mid February (Manning et al. 2008) and in the High SWA case the south window area of this zone has more than doubled.

Figure 26: Sun Tempered High SWA Temperature Profile (Zone S2a)

Despite the extreme temperatures predicted for this scenario, overheating (above 26°C) occurs rarely for any zone while it is occupied. The south zones in the CCHT house are areas of lower occupancy, including a bathroom, entryway (modelled as unoccupied), two bedrooms and the living room. The bedrooms are only occupied during the night and early morning, and the living room is only occupied during the late evening. Table 13, below, summarizes the maximum time the temperature exceeds 26°C in any zone, during an occupied period. 82

The Sun Tempered High SWA Advanced Glazing scenario, is the second worst scenario for overheating, however the peaks are considerably lower due to the lower SHGC of the advanced windows. As shown below in Figure 27, temperatures in the South 2a zone reach a maximum of 32°C during mid-march and a majority of temperature peaks being between 26° and 29°C.

Figure 27: Sun Tempered High SWA Advanced Glazing Temperature Profile (Zone S2a)

Even though both of these scenarios, would likely meet comfort requirements for 83

almost all hours occupied for the assumed occupancy pattern, there are other implications of allowing such extreme temperatures. For example, such designs would likely not be compatible with house plants as most plants are harmed by temperatures above 32°C (CMHC 1998). With different occupancy patterns more moderate temperatures could be maintained, however more venting of excess solar gains would reduce the energy savings of these scenarios. From this temperature analysis it can be concluded that the results from the scenarios with high SWA and no added thermal mass would are not valid for occupancy usage patterns where south zones are occupied during the day, as additional venting or other measures would be required which would reduce the solar fraction of these scenarios. A very large reduction in temperature fluctuations is observed with the addition of thermal mass, as shown in Figure 28 below. The addition of thermal mass to the worst case, Sun Tempered High SWA scenario reduces the temperature peaks to below 26°C for the entire heating season, with the exception of the late spring.

VFL"I'&:4&&',*"
The results indicate that even with very basic passive solar design measures, such as the CCHT house as-is, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical house's heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (20 to 34%), and with more aggressive passive solar design applied to a typical house (i.e. High Mass High SWA Advanced Glazing) this fraction can be considerably high (35 to 52%). For an Advanced passive solar house predicted solar fractions ranged from 40 to 69%. These results suggest the potential energy savings for passive solar design is considerably higher than previous estimates, such as the 30 to 50% from CMHC 1998. This highlights the importance of solar access for buildings in heating dominated climates. For all typical 85

house scenarios in all of the climate locations considered, south facing windows were found to be energy positive, demonstrated in the results by the reduction in heating energy consumption that occurs when window area is increased. The results for solar heating fractions in this study are remarkably close to results from Balcomb (1983), which conducted a computer analysis of monitored data from 48 passive solar houses across the US and found an average solar heating fraction of 37% (Balcomb 1983), whereas the average SHF for all of the scenarios considered in this study is 38%. Generally it would be expected that considerably lower SHFs would be achieved in Canada than the US, however the similarity of the US study can likely be explained by the lower insulation levels, and less advanced windows used during the 1980s, and earlier when the houses studied were built. CMHC's 20 house designs evaluated for Vancouver, Winnipeg and Ottawa; were simulated to have solar heating fractions ranging from 13% (Winnipeg) to 67% (Vancouver), with an average of 34% (CMHC 1998). Their results are typically lower than the findings in this research, which predicts an average SHF for Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Ottawa of 40%. CMHC's maximum predicted SHF for Vancouver is higher than predicted by this research (67% cf. 63%). The work by CMHC was carried out using DOE-2, therefore it is likely that some of the discrepancy is due to refinements made to EnergyPlus and DOE-2, one of such being the introduction of sub-hourly timesteps. SHFs of 0.34 to 0.53 were observed in Canada by (Barakat 1984) for simple one-zone test units, with only south facing glazing in Ottawa. A more recent example, the Alstonvale Net Zero Energy House (NZEH), near Montreal (Canada), had a predicted passive SHF of approximately 60% (Candanedo and Athienitis 2009). The high solar 86

heating fraction can also be attributed to the high level of thermal performance. The Alstonvale NZEH has much higher thermal resistance values than the CCHT Twin houses, with R values of 5.6, 12, 4.6 m2K/W in the walls, roof and floor, respectively (Candanedo et al. 2012). The results from this study support the south facing window areas suggested by CMHC (1998) for sun tempered (low mass) designs. However for high mass designs the results indicate the higher SWA values recommended by Charron and Athienitis (2006) may be desirable, due to the very high solar fraction that can be achieved, and the understanding that with a south facing glazing to floor area ratio of 15.4% thermal comfort can still be maintained during occupied hours for high mass designs. Similarly, for the Advanced house thermal comfort is maintained even though the SWA to floor area ratio is 20%. This suggests that with careful design larger window areas may be feasible. For advanced glazing, SHGCs tend to decrease with decreasing U values, due to increased number of glazing lites, and coating selection. With lower SHGCs it is expected that larger glazing areas can be exploited, however, the results of this research support the notion that careful analysis is required for each climate and floor plan. However, it should be noted that this conclusion would not be valid for floor plans and usage patterns where south zones are frequently be occupied during sunny periods. The results from this research depend on many input parameters that are uncertain or vary for different site conditions and house designs. These results are only valid for sites which are un-shaded during the heating season. Heating energy savings for the designs considered would be close to the total energy savings, however for house designs without movable shading, cooling load would increase with increasing window area. The 87

implications that climate change presents to these results is uncertain, however it is expected that general warming trends would cause the results of this study to over predict energy consumption. Changes to floor plans and usage patterns would affect the results of this study considerably, as the energy savings associated with larger temperature swings during unoccupied periods would be reduced if these zones were more rigorously controlled (eg. if occupied). It is expected that the uncertainty and error in the results will increase as scenarios depart further from the calibrated reference case. VFLFE"G5(2':1#',*&"3,)"9'5421#',*" The results of the final multi-zone were compared to previous results to gain insight into the implications of the various levels of simulation detailed employed in the three major versions of the model. Table 14, summarizes the main differences between each version of the simulation model.

Figure 29, below, presents the predicted space heating gas consumption for all three versions of the model. The results presented in Zirnhelt and Richman (2011) did not cover all of the scenarios covered in the subsequent work.

Figure 29: Model Results Comparison: Furnace Gas Consumption

The predicted energy consumption values for the three version of the model were fairly consistent, with typical variations being on the order of 5%. The relatively small difference was not expected, as errors in a simulation model could multiply with extrapolation. It is expected that the use of calibration was a factor in the relatively small difference between the results. This suggests simpler models may be appropriate for predicting annual energy consumption of a passive solar house, when less resources are available for model development. A larger discrepancy was found between results from the three model versions for SHF, as shown below in Figure 30.

89

Figure 30: Model Results Comparison: Solar Heating Fractions

The difference between the first and final version of the model ranged from 22% to 33%, highlighting the importance of careful attention to relevant simulation submodels when predicting the energy savings. It is expected that the main cause of the discrepancy between version 1 and the other versions is the use of the simplified window model. As described in the calibration chapter, the window model had a large influence on results, and other errors existed in version 1 that were compensating for the window model error. The difference between the predicted SHF from the second version and the final version was much smaller. This is likely explained by the fact that the multi-zone model has a high degree of mixing due to the constant air circulation through the furnace fan, such that the fully mixed assumption may not have been very significant. The final model

90

generally predicted smaller SHFs, this can likely be explained by the venting that was added to the final version. The discrepancy increases with increasing window area.

The results of this research lay the foundations for further related research. Further simulation work is required to fully understand the relative contribution of the design parameters involved in the advanced passive solar house, such as geometry, elimination of north facing windows, further increased south window area, and increased insulation levels. Further investigation into the added cooling load would is required for house designs that do not employ movable shading. To further investigate the potential for energy savings and greenhouse gas emission reductions on a broader scale, the results of this research could be combined with building stock modelling. The results from the heating energy calculations could be directly used in cost studies, which could include lifecycle cost analysis of passive solar measures in Canada. Further research on the incremental cost of passive solar measures such as adding thermal mass and increased window area is warranted by the promising results from this research. Given the typically low incremental cost of passive solar design and the high predicted energy savings, passive solar may prove to be highly economical. In addition to lifecycle cost, lifecycle analysis including evaluation of operational and embodied GHG emissions should be carried out.

Estimates of the potential energy savings from passive solar houses in a range of Canadian climates were produced, based on a calibrated EnergyPlus model of the CCHT Reference House, a representative sample of new Canadian single-family dwellings. The results indicate that solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical house's heating requirements in Canadian climates, (20% to 34%), and with more aggressive passive solar design applied to a typical house this fraction can be considerably high (35% to 52%). For an advanced passive solar house predicted solar fractions ranged from 40% to 69%. These results are typically higher than previous estimates, and show that passive solar large potential energy savings even in the far North. The highest energy savings are achieved in the coldest climates, where space heating energy consumption is the highest. The highest solar heating fractions occur in areas where solar radiation is high relative to envelope losses. Based on the simulation results, very large solar fractions (up to 69%) can be achieved if the architecture is optimized for passive solar collection and has high envelope thermal resistance values. In all locations for the design scenarios considered, south facing windows were found to be energy positive over the heating season. The results from this study could be used to support policies that encourage passive solar design, and policies such as the Right to Light law in the UK, which protects the solar exposure of existing buildings (Waltham Forest Council 2011); and the City of Campbell River's official community plan, which requires the consideration of passive solar design for new developments (City of Campbell River 2012).
