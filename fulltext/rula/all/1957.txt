EXPLORING THE NEXUS BETWEEN HERITAGE AND SUSTAINABILITY: HOW BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT AREAS (BIAs) CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROCESS © Matthew Zambri, 2012 Master of Planning in Urban Development Ryerson University ABSTRACT

Toronto  has  been  undergoing  rapid  growth  and  development,  dramatically  changing  the   skyline  of  this  city.  Although  this  growth  is  exciting,  it  plays  a  hand  in  the  threat  against   some   of   Toronto's   oldest   buildings,   sitting   on   prime   real   estate   seen   as   ripe   for   redevelopment.  Toronto  needs  to  be  more  assertive  when  protecting  its  heritage  assets,   but  has   become   largely   reactive  rather   than  proactive   due   to  an  overburdened   Heritage   Preservation  Service  department.  The  system  needs  to  provide  for  more  vigilance  over   threats   to   heritage   and   increase   public   awareness   regarding   the   many   benefits   to   protecting   heritage   properties.   This   paper   explores   how   Business   Improvement   Associations   can   take   on   this   role   and   stimulate   the   conversation   of   heritage   conservation   with   property   owners,   developers,   and   other   stakeholders,   providing   the   support  and  vision  over  alternatives  to  demolition.  This  report  also  looks  at  the  potential   role   the   private   sector   has   in   heritage   conservation,   seeing   it   not   as   a   barrier   to   development   but   something   that   needs   to   be   commemorated   because   it   is   what   makes   Toronto  unique.     Key  words:  Heritage  Conservation,  Sustainability,  Business  Improvement  Areas,  Heritage   Conservation  Districts

INTRODUCTION      Toronto   is   growing,   despite   the   recent   rough   global   economic   climate  

resulting  from  the  2008  Global  Credit  Crisis  and  the  2011  USA  and  European  Union   Debt   Crisis,   and   is   considered   Canada's   "where-to-be-market"   and   one   of   North   America's  "primary  gateways"  for  business  (City  of  Toronto,  2011,  p.3;  Urban  Land   Institute,   2010,   p.61).   In   2011,   Toronto   was   even   ranked   the   fourth   most   liveable   city  in  the  world  by  the   Economic  Intelligence  Unit  (ibid.,  p.7).  In  addition,  Toronto   ranked   second,   only   to   New   York   City,   as   the   best   city   globally   in   the   Cities   of   Opportunities  Report,  as  well  as  tenth  as  a  global  financial  centre  by  the  Z/Yen  Group   (ibid.).  This  favourable  economic  environment  within  Greater  Toronto  Area  (GTA)  is   reflected   in   the   city's   ever   changing   urban   fabric.   As   of   September   2011,   Toronto   boasts  a  remarkable  132  high-rise  construction  projects,  with  Mexico  City  in  second   position,  trailing  behind  with  88  high-rise  construction  projects  (ibid.,  p.14).

Although   the   steady   investment   is   good   for   the   local   economy   and   will   dramatically   change   Toronto's   skyline   within   the   next   few   years,   we   should   approach   with   caution   with   regards   to   the   integration   of   these   new   developments   into   the   already   existing   urban   fabric.   The   demand   for   residential   and   commercial   space   in   downtown   Toronto   puts   development   pressure   on   properties   that   do   not   utilize  their  potential  profit  reaching  densities.  Thus,  there  becomes  an  incentive  for   property   owners   within   these   areas   of   a   development   boom   to   sell   their   properties.   This   demand   inevitably   puts   heritage-designated   buildings   and   other   buildings   of   vintage   at   risk   of   demolition.   Therefore,   it   is   important   to   make   property   owners   and   developers   see   the   many   economic,   social,   and   sustainability   benefits   of   maintaining  existing  older  buildings.   In  Canada,  the  government  primarily  performs  the  role  of  protecting  heritage   buildings.  At  the  federal  level,  heritage  conservation  efforts  are  undertaken  by  Parks   2     

Canada  through  the  recognition  of  national  historic  sites  (Parks  Canada,  2011).  They   also   provide   guidance   and   recommendations   on   how   to   treat   heritage   properties   (Parks  Canada,  2011a).  In  Ontario,  the  Ministry  of  Culture's   Ontario  Heritage  Act  is   the   primary   legislation   that   gives   both   the   province   and   municipalities   the   power   to   designate  properties  of  historic  value  (Ministry  of  Culture,  2011).     The   planning   framework   in   Ontario   has   been   criticized   for   lacking   the   necessary   integration   of   heritage   in   order   to   make   it   have   more   relevance   and   consideration   when   reviewed   in   development   applications   (Heritage   Toronto   &   Toronto   Historical   Association,   2011,   p.5).   Heritage   considerations   are   still   not   a   fundamental  part  of  Toronto's  municipal  planning  process  (ibid.).  Toronto  Heritage   Preservation   Services   [HPS]   is   often   "excluded   from   broader   planning   and   development  decisions"  despite  their  placement  in  the  Planning  Department  at  City   Hall   (ibid.).   In   addition,   HPS   is   often   overburdened,   resulting   in   a   more   reactive   rather   than   proactive   approach   when   it   comes   to   municipal   heritage   matters   (ibid.).   This  issue  persists  up  into  the  provincial  planning  process,  especially  in  regards  to   the  concept  of  the  municipality  as  a  "creature"  of  the  province,  which  is  perceived  to   result  in  a  weak  legislative  structure  (ibid.).  The  Ontario  Municipal  Board  [OMB]  is   also  perceived  as  another  barrier  to  heritage  conservation  efforts  in  the  City  due  to   their  reputation  of  siding  with  the  developer  and  property  owners  who  do  not  want   to   keep   their   heritage   buildings   (ibid.).   In   addition   to   the   lack   of   strong   legislative   support   for   heritage,   financial   support   is   always   an   important   issue.   On   the   provincial   and   federal   level   this   support   dwindles,   and   municipalities   tend   to   be   left   to  pay  for  heritage  conservation  efforts  (Shipley,  Jonas  and  Kovacs,  2011).  There  are   3     

no   financial   incentives   available   from   the   province   and   any   federal   grants   have   long   been   defunct.   These   levels   of   government   have   only   provided   policies   that   have   proven   to   be   very   limited   in   their   efforts   to   protect   heritage.   The   reality   is   that   in   Canada,   heritage   buildings   are   under   constant   threat   and   within   the   last   30   years,   Canada   has   lost   more   than   20%   of   its   pre-1920   heritage   buildings   (Heritage   Canada   Foundation,  2007,  p.1).     The  notion  of  Canada  as  a  "young"  country  provides  a  challenge  for  heritage   supporters,   for   this   concept   insinuates   that   there   are   few   buildings   worth   preservation   in   this   country   (Shipley,   2011).   Furthermore,   the   idea   of   "building   anew   is   a   sign   of   progress   and   prosperity"   only   provides   more   of   an   argument   to   discount   the   heritage   value   of   older   buildings   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011,   p.85).     According   to   Allison   and   Peters   (2011),   heritage   conservation   "has   become   associated   in   the   public   mind   with   antiquarian   interests   and   is   often   seen   as   peripheral  to  the  greater  needs  of  society,  viewing  it  more  as  "a  luxury  rather  than  a   necessity"  (p.53).  This  may  explain  some  of  the  reasons  why  heritage  conservation   is   often   viewed   as   opposing   progress   and   economic   development,   while   economic   development   is   defined   as   "new   construction"   (ibid.,   p.88).   This   leads   to   the   misconception   that   "preservationists   are   only   concerned   with   old   buildings   rather   than  the  healthy  growth  and  maintenance  of  the  city  or  town"  (ibid.).  This  simply  is   not   true   and   pins   heritage   conservation   as   "seeking   to   prevent   change"   and   urban   planning   seen   as   "enabling   change"   ­   resulting   in   a   rift   in   the   planning   profession   and   undermines   heritage   conservation   as   a   form   of   economic   revitalization   (ibid.,   p.89).  Therefore,  with  limited  public  funding,  political  will,  and  lack  of  integration  in   4     

the   planning   system   there   is   a   real   urgency   to   find   alternative   ways   to   entice   property  owners  to  conserve  heritage  buildings.   In   the  United  States,  the  National  Trust  for  Historic  Preservation  [NTHP]  has   tied   the   concept   of   heritage   conservation   with   sustainability   (National   Trust   for   Historic  Preservation  [NTHP],  2012).  The  most  common  definition  of  sustainability   is  from  the   Brundtland  Report   published  in  1987,  stating,  "Sustainable  development   is   development   that   meets   the   needs   of   the   present   without   compromising   the   ability   of   future   generations   to   meet   their   own   needs,"   this   holistic   approach   includes   economic,   social   and   environmental   factors   (World   Commission   on   Environment  and  Development  [WCED],  1987).  The  NTHP  makes  the  argument  that   heritage   buildings   tend   to   be   located   in   dense,   walkable   and   well   serviced   urban   communities   and   are   therefore   already   within   a   more   sustainable   environment   (NTHP,   2012).   Although   careful   not   to   devalue   green   building,   the   NTHP   suggests   using   these   technologies   to   already   existing   buildings   on   the   idea   that   no   matter   how  green  a  newly  constructed  building  is  it  will  still  result  in  the  use  of  energy  and   national   resources,   generating   construction   waste   that   "clogs   landfills"   (ibid.).   This   forward  thinking  by  the  NTHP  aligns  closely  with  many  private  corporations  looking   on   how   to   become   more   sustainable.   Therefore   one   such   avenue   for   encouraging   historic   conservation   is   to   leverage   the   private   sector's   corporate   citizenship   values   and   financial   resources   to   help   participate   in   historic   conservation   process.   Some   private   companies   have   capitalized   on   this   concept   placing   their   stores   in   historic   buildings   and   upgrading   them   to   LEED   [Leadership   in   Energy   and   Environmental   Design]  building  standards,  thus  setting  an  example  for  other  companies.     5     

  

At   the   community   level,   Business   Improvement   Areas   [BIA]   can   utilize   this  

momentum  of  the  private  sector  to  be  more  sustainable  for  the  preservation  of  their   communities.   A   BIA   is   an   organization,   approved   by   city   council,   involving   all   businesses   within   a   delineated   boundary   (Toronto   Association   of   Business   Improvement   Areas   [TABIA],   2010).   These   businesses   are   then   able   to   pool   resources  and  finances  to  maintain  and  attract  businesses,  customers,  and  tourists   into  the  community,  serving  as  an  "economic  and  social  anchor,  helping  to  stabilize   and   revitalize   the   local   community"   (ibid.).   BIAs   capitalize   on   community   assets   to   market   themselves,   assets   such   as   historic   buildings,   which   according   to   Richard   Florida   "provide   the   authenticity,   the   creditability,   the   sense   of   community,   the   sense  of  history  that  bind  people  in  a  fast-moving,  24/7  ever-changing  world"  and   "provide  a  sense  of  self,  a  sense  of  identity  in  this  creative  age"  (as  cited  in  Allison  &   Peters,   2011,   p.10).   Given   the   existing   conditions   regarding   heritage   conservation   within  Ontario,  what  potential  do  BIAs  have  to  contribute  in  heritage  conservation?   Are  Heritage  Conservation  Districts  a  viable  option  for  heritage  protection  for  BIAs?   Further   exploration   is   needed   of   what   role   BIAs   can   play   in   maintaining   their   heritage   assets   and   informing   their   members   of   the   benefits   of   heritage   conservation,  while  still  creating  an  attractive  environment  for  future  investment.     METHODOLOGY      Research   for   this   major   research   paper   will   focus   on   four   major   areas:  

heritage   conservation,   sustainability,   private   corporations   (corporate   citizens)   and   the   role   BIAs   play   in   facilitating   and   promoting   this   process.   This   research   will   predominately  be  gathered  from  secondary  sources  such  as  ­  academic  journals  and   6     

thesis',   textbooks,   government   documents,   and   news   articles.   In   addition,   some   primary   data   will   be   collected   through   semi-structured   interviews   with   professionals   in   the   related   fields   pertaining   to   the   research   questions.      These   interviews   are   meant   to   fill   in   the   gaps   or   strengthen   the   research   found   in   secondary  sources.        The   research   will   require   interviews   with   key   informants   from   a   selected  

group   of   BIAs   within   the   City   of   Toronto.   These   BIAs   include   Church   Wellesley   Village  BIA,  Downtown  Yonge  BIA,  Queen  St.  West  BIA,  and  the  St.  Lawrence  Market   BIA.   These   BIAs   were   selected   based   on   the   following   criteria:   urban   atmosphere,   and   older   building   stock   of   commercial   buildings.   A   selected   BIA   is   also   located   within  Heritage  Conservation  District,  which  can  be  cross-referenced  with  the  BIAs   not   located   in   one.   Due   to   ethics   review   requirements   and   the   wishes   of   some   participants,   BIA   member's   names   are   going   to   be   anonymous   and   referred   to   as   `BIA  Member'  when  quoted.     This   research   will   also   include   a   segment   that   selected   a   private   retail   corporation,   Starbucks   Coffee   Company,   and   showcasing   their   achievements   as   a   'best   practice'   with   regards   to   store   selection   and   how   this   often   incorporates   rehabilitating  older,  sometimes  historic  buildings,  and  retrofitting  them  with  green   building   technologies.   An   interview   was   conducted   with   David   Martin,   Construction   Manager   for   Starbucks   Coffee   Canada   who   provided   insight   on   how   heritage   conservation   and   sustainability   has   become   a   successful   business   model   for   the   company's  stores.

POLICY  CONTEXT      The  planning  framework  in  Ontario  is  predominately  lead  by  the  provincial  

government.   Municipalities   are   empowered   by   provincial   statute   and   municipalities   must  adhere  to  legislation  created  by  the  province,  which  impacts  decision  making   at   the   local   level.   This   section   will   provide   an   overview   of   the   policies   that   impact   heritage   conservation   and   BIAs   within   Ontario,   but   more   specifically   City   of   Toronto:   Ontario  Heritage  Act  [OHA]:      The  Ontario  Heritage  Act  is  the  most  important  piece  of  legislation  relating  to  

the  governance  and  protection  of  the  province's  heritage  resources.  The   OHA  gives   both   the   province   and   municipal   governments   more   power   with   regards   to   designating   properties   that   are   considered   to   have   cultural   heritage   value.   Moreover,   municipalities   can   pass   bylaws   that   recognize   the   value   of   heritage   properties   to   the   community   through   designation   and   adding   the   property   to   the   municipal  and  provincial  heritage  registries.  Once,  designated  a  heritage  property  is   also  eligible  to  be  listed  in  the  Canadian  Registry  of  Historic  Places.  It  is  important  to   note   that   these   designations   are   not   limited   to   buildings,   but   rather   the   property,   and  the  heritage  attributes  of  the  property  are  to  be  identified  in  the  designation  by- law.      The   OHA   approaches   heritage   at   different   scales:   Part   IV   looks   at   the  

conservation  of  individual  properties,  Part  V  looks  at  the  implementation  of  heritage   conservation   districts,   and   Part   VI   looks   at   the   conservation   of   archeological

resources.   A   2005   revision   strengthened   the   OHA   and   provided   the   provincial   and   municipal   governments   greater   powers   and   a   clearer   process   to   better   protect   designated  heritage  properties  from  threats  such  as  demolition  (Ministry  of  Culture,   2006).   In   addition,   Section   35.3   of   the   OHA   allows   municipalities   who   enabled   existing   bylaw   under   Section   15.1   of   the   Building   Code   Act   to   "prescribe   and   enforce   minimum   standards   for   the   maintenance   of   designated   propert[ies]"   (City   of   London,  2007).   Ontario  Building  Code  Act  and  the  Ontario  Building  Code:      The   Ontario   Building   Code   Act   provides   the   regulation   necessary   to   lay   the  

foundation   for   the   Ontario   Building   Code.   The   building   code   outlines   the   minimum   requirements   to   ensure   construction   safety   for   construction   and   renovation   that   pertain   to   a   building's   structural   integrity,   fire   standards,   and   public   health   considerations   (Building   Code   Act,   1992).   The   Ontario   Building   Code   prescribes   some   leniency   for   designated   heritage   properties.      This   gives   municipalities   more   flexibility   when   it   comes   to   approving   permits   for   heritage   buildings   when   certain   aspects  of  the  building  code  would  otherwise  be  detrimental  to  maintaining  certain   heritage  features  (City  of  London,  2007).     Ontario  Planning  Act:   At  the  core  of  land-use  planning  in  Ontario  is  the   Planning  Act.  It  essentially   looks   at   how   land-uses   are   controlled   and   whom   they   should   be   controlled   by   (MMAH,   2010a).   The   Planning   Act   can   be   utilized   for   the   advantage   of   managing

Ontario's   built   heritage,   providing   tools   for   protection   as   well   as   providing   incentives  for  conservation,  such  as:     - Provincial   Interests   (s.2)   -   giving   the   minister   absolute   power   regarding   provincial   interests.   (d)   "the   conservation   of   features   of   significant   architectural,  cultural,  historical,  archaeological,  or  scientific  interest"   - Demolition   Control   (s.33)   -   allows   city   council   to   designate   any   area   within   the   city   under   "demolition   control",   where   nothing   can   be   demolished   without  an  approved  permit.   - Increased   Density/   "bonuses"   (s.37)   -   allowing   zoning   by-law   provisions   that   permit   the   increase   of   height   and   density   of   a   development   in   return   for   a   public   benefit.   For   example:   protection   of   a   heritage   property   in   order   to   approve  a  taller  building.   - Interim   Control   By-Law   (s.38)   -   gives   municipality   the   ability   to   review/study   in   an   area.   Allows   for   one   year   to   freeze   development   for   the   outcome  of  the  study/review.     - Site   Plan   Control   (s.41)   -   Once   an   Official   Plan   proposes   site   control   a   municipality  may  use  this  to  force  all  development  to  get  approved  by  council   after  seeing  plans/drawings  (City  of  Toronto,  2007a).   Provincial  Policy  Statement  [PPS]:      Through   the   legislative   power   of   the   Planning   Act,   the   province   is   able   to  

create  the  Provincial  Policy  Statement.  The  most  recent  PPS  came  into  effect  in  2005.   The   PPS  provides  the  groundwork  that  helps  guide  land-use  and  development  with   the   intentions   of   improving   the   quality   of   life   for   Ontarians   (MMAH,   2010b).   10     

Included  in  the   PPS  is  a  section  that  pertains  to  Ontario's  heritage  resources,  where   section   2.6   states,   "significant   built   heritage   resources   and   significant   cultural   heritage   landscapes   shall   be   conserved"   (Provincial   Policy   Statement,   2005).   The   PPS   also   requires   that   development   of   lands   surrounding   heritage   properties   be   sensitive  to  not  disrupt  the  historic  attributes  of  a  heritage  building  or  place  (ibid.).     Municipal  Act:   The   Municipal  Act,  2001  is  a  mutual  agreement  between  the  province  and  its   municipalities,   which   "recognizes   municipalities   as   responsible   and   accountable   levels   of   government   and   provides   for   the   establishment   of   integrity   officer   functions   at   the   local   level"   (MMAH,   2011).   With   the   exception   of   Toronto,   The   Municipal   Act   provides   municipal   governments   the   capacity   to   better   determine   the   delivery   of   local   services   to   their   constituents   pertaining   to   BIAs   and   heritage   properties   (ibid.).   Section   204   to   215   allows   the   creation   and   management   of   BIAs   and  section  365.2  also  allows  municipalities  to  provide  tax  relief  for  eligible  heritage   properties.   The   City   of   Toronto's   provisions   for   the   powers   stated   above   are   specified  in  the  City  of  Toronto  Act.   City  of  Toronto  Act:        Toronto  is  a  single-tier  municipality,  meaning  that  the  city  is  responsible  for  

all   "local   services"   for   its   citizens   (Ontario   Government,   2012).   Due   to   Toronto's   prominence   and   size,   the   city   was   granted   more   powers   through   the   City   of   Toronto   Act   (2006),  but  balances  both  the  interest  of  the  city  and  the  province.  It  provides  a   legislative   framework   that   grants   the   city   more   tools   that   correspond   to   its   size,

responsibilities   and   significance   in   terms   of   addressing   issues   of   health,   safety,   environmental  and  social  well  being,  and  the  economy.  The   City  of  Toronto  Act  also   provides   some   power   to   the   municipality   in   regards   to   protecting   the   City's   built   heritage.   It   allows   Toronto   to   create   grants   and   loans,   as   well   as   implement   tax- increment   financing   to   encourage   the   conservation   of   historic   buildings.   The   Toronto   Act   also   gives   the   City   the   power   to   create   and   dissolve   BIAs   (considered   local   management   boards).   The   powers   given   to   BIAs   are   elaborated   more   within   the  Toronto  Municipal  Code.     Toronto  Municipal  Code:      Upon   release   of   the   City   of   Toronto   Act,   a   revised   version   of  Chapter   19   of   the  

Toronto   Municipal   Code   was   updated   to   be   in   compliance   with   the   act.   Chapter   19   outlines   the   provisions   for   the   creation,   responsibilities,   budgeting,   management,   and   boundary   changes   for   Business   Improvement   Areas   within   the   city   (City   of   Toronto,   2010).   The   City   of   Toronto   Act   gave   the   city   more   power,   such   as   City   Council's   ability   to   establish   local   boards,   like   BIAs,   as   suited   to   fit   city   needs.   Moreover,   in   comparison   to   the   Municipal   Act,   Chapter   19   of   Toronto's   Municipal   Code  allowed  the  city  to  create  more  clarified  operating  framework  for  BIAs,  while   also   making   them   more   transparent   and   accountable.   The   City   of   Toronto   is   also   able   to   expand   the   roles   and   responsibilities   of   BIAs   through   the   Municipal   Code   granted  through  the  City  of  Toronto  Act.        Chapter  103   of  the   Toronto  Municipal  Code  pertains  to  heritage.   Articles  I,  II,  

and   III   looks  at  the  creation  and  management  of  Toronto's  heritage  and  community

museum  boards,  Heritage  Toronto,  the  Toronto  Preservation  Board,  and  Community   Preservation   Panels,   respectively.   Chapter   103   also   outlines   the   details   of   permits   within   Heritage   Conservation   Districts   (Article   IV)   and   individual   designated   properties   (Article   V),   as   well   as   the   appointment   of   inspectors   for   heritage   properties   (Article   VI).   Article   VII   outlines   the   details   of   Toronto's   Heritage   Property   Tax   Rebate   Program,   where   Article   VIII   looks   at   the   process   when   applying   to   demolish  a  listed  property.     City  of  Toronto  Official  Plan:      An  official  plan  helps  a  municipal  government  direct  the  long-term  growth  of  

the   city.   This   high-level   document   is   strategic   and   outlines   a   clear   vision   for   the   creation   of   an   atmosphere   that   would   stimulate   the   best   possible   social,   environmental,  and  economic  conditions  for  the  city  (Toronto  Official  Plan,  2010).      The   Toronto   Official   Plan   includes   heritage   conservation   within   its   long-term  

planning   vision   for   the   city   and   a   sound   investment   for   the   future.   The   plan   recognizes  heritage's  contributions  to  the  economy,  such  as  through  tourism  or  the   film   industry,   the   social   benefits   of   "place-making"   and   contributing   to   the   "desirably   and   value"   of   the   city's   neighbourhoods   (Toronto   Official   Plan,   2010).   Furthermore,  the  City  commits  to  maintaining  the  inventory  of  listed  and  designated   historic  properties,  providing  public  forms  of  incentives  to  ensure  in  the  longevity  of   these  treasures,  while  also  supporting  adaptive  re-use  over  demolition  (ibid.).         13     

LITERATURE  REVIEW   Historical  Conservation  in  the  Canadian  Context:      The  Historic  Places  Initiative  is  a  joint  project  between  the  federal,  provincial,  

and   territorial   governments   recognizing   the   contribution   heritage   has   on   our   communities   (Ministry   of   Culture,   2006).   The   initiative   resulted   in   the   development   of  two  major  heritage  conservation  tools:   1) The   Canadian   Register   of   Historic   Places   [CRHP]:   A   public   online   register   of   recognized   heritage   properties   from   across   the   country.   This   register   does   not   place   any   additional   controls   on   a   property   and   is   not   a   requirement   of   the   Ontario   Heritage   Act,   but   it   is   aimed   toward   building   public   awareness   and   education   about   Canada's   historic   places   (Ministry   of   Culture,  2006).      2) The   Standards   and   Guidelines   for   the   Conservation   of   Historic   Places   in   Canada:   This   guide   provides   the   language   and   information   required   to   participate   in   the   conservation   of   heritage   resources   in   Canada,   providing  benchmarks  on  which  practices  to  follow  and  which  ones  to  avoid   (Parks  Canada,  2011a).  

  

The   Canadian   definition   of   historic   conservation   is   "all   actions   or   processes  

aimed   at   safeguarding   the   character-defining   elements   of   a   historic   place   to   retain   its  heritage  value  and  extend  its  physical  life"  (Park  Canada,  2010,  p.15).  According   to   The   Standards   and   Guidelines   for   the   Conservation   of   Historic   Places   in   Canada

(2010)   this   may   involve   preservation,   rehabilitation,   restoration,   or   a   combination  of  all  three  (see  definitions  below):   Conservation:   All   actions   or   processes   that   are   aimed   at   safeguarding   the   character-defining  elements  of  a  historic  place  so  as  to  retain  its  heritage  value  and   extend  its  physical  life.  This  may  involve  Preservation,  Rehabilitation,  Restoration,  or   a  combination  of  these  actions  or  processes  (Park  Canada,  2010,  p.15).   Preservation:   the   action   or   process   of   protecting,   maintaining,   and/or   stabilizing   the   existing   materials,   form,   and   integrity   of   a   historic   place,   or   of   an   individual   component,  while  protecting  its  heritage  value  (Park  Canada,  2010,  p.15  ­  16).   Rehabilitation:  the  action  or  process  of  making  possible  a  continuing  or  compatible   contemporary  use  of  a   historic  place,  or  an  individual  component,  while  protecting   its  heritage  value  (Park  Canada,  2010,  p.16).   Restoration:   the   action   or   process   of   accurately   revealing   recovering,   or   representing   the   state   of   a   historic   place,   or   of   an   individual   component,   as   it   appeared   at   a   particular   period   in   its   history,   while   protecting   its   heritage   value   (Park  Canada,  2010,  p.16  ­  17).   Heritage  Conservation  ­  Current  Status:      The  management  of  our  collective  heritage  is  considered  a  public  good  and  it  is  

in   this   inherit   justification   where   manifestations   of   commitments   are   made   by   the   various  stakeholders  in  the  historical  preservation  process  to  protect  this  heritage   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011;   Lowenthal,   2003;   Mason,   2005).   Heritage   buildings   are   essentially   pieces   of   art   that   embody   the   unique   identity   of   a   place,   building

community  in  this  increasingly  globalized  world  (Allison  &  Peters,  2011).    There  are   many   reasons   to   preserve   historic   buildings,   the   most   popular   being   cultural   and   educational   (i.e.   ­   location   of   a   historic   event),   economic   (i.e.   ­   heritage   tourism,   job   creation,   or   revitalization),   and   environmental   (i.e.   ­   reusing   buildings   rather   than   new   construction,   curbing   urban   sprawl)   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011;   Cunningham   &   Storm,  2008;  Frey,  2007;  Mason,  2005;   Mason,  2008;  Milligan,  2007;   Nasser,  2003;   Shipley,  2007;  Tweed  &  Sutherland,  2007).  One  of  the  largest   obstacles   to  heritage   conservation  is  getting  stakeholders  engaged  in  the  process,  and  to  see  their  return   on   investment.   Measuring   the   impacts   of   heritage   conservation   can   be   challenging   due   to   the   many   indirect   or   intangible   benefits   (Chakrapani   &   Hernandez,   2010;   Tweed  &  Sutherland,  2007).  One  of  the  most  enticing  ways  to  engage  stakeholders  is   through   a   market-based   incentive   approach   where   a   return   on   investment   can   be   seen  (Mason,  2005;  Mason,  2008;  McCleary,  2005;  Nasser,  2003).  Along  with  proper   governance   and   legislation,   financial   incentives   are   viewed   as   the   most   useful   approach   to   overcome   some   of   the   challenges   of   preserving   historic   architecture,   making   it   more   justifiable   to   engage   in   preservation   projects   merely   because   of   governmental  persuasion  (Allison  &  Peters,  2011;  Anthony,  2002;  McCleary,   2005).   In   other   words,   give   individuals   who   undertake   historical   preservation   some   sort   of   incentive  above  and  beyond  the  fact  it  is  a  public  good.        If   the   notion   of   protecting   heritage   buildings   is   for   the   betterment   of  

communities   then   a   community's   input   is   vital   and   ultimately   makes   it   a   more   proactive   process.   (Spennemann,   2006).   Historical   preservation   projects   are   often   contributed   to   shaping   the   way   a   community   is   perceived   to   those   living   in   the   16     

community   and   those   living   outside   of   it   (Greenbaum,   1990).   There   are   many   examples   of   how   getting   a   community   involved   in   historic   preservation   has   been   attributed   to   community   building   and   empowerment,   where   community   groups   assemble   to   protect   heritage   sites   by   lobbying   against   the   demolition   of   certain   historic   buildings   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011;   Greenbaum,   1982;   Spennemann,   2006).     The   demolition   of   a   heritage   building   can   rally   community   support   for   better   heritage   management   and   protection   legislation   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011;   City   of   Toronto,   2007).   This   is   an   example   of   how   heritage   is   recognized   for   its   various   benefits   and   its   formation   in   community   identity   (Frey,   2007;   Kenny,   2004;   Lowenthal,  2003;  Mason,  2005;  Milligan,  2007;  Tweed  &  Sutherland,  2007).      Heritage   buildings   manifest   an   innate   sense   of   history   and   their   meaning   to   an  

individual   can   vary   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011;   Lowenthal,   2003;   Pannekoek,   2009;   Spennemann,   2006).   Therefore,   it   can   be   a   challenging   task   to   determine   whose   interpretation   of   the   past   is   worth   preserving.   Historical   preservation   is   a   contentious  issue  in  the  sense  that  it  is  so  easy  for  us  to  judge  previous  generations   on   their   choices   of   which   buildings   were   worth   preservation   and   which   were   not   (Allison  &  Peters,  2011).  This  is  relevant  because  future  generations  will  bestow  this   judgment  on  how  we  managed  our  heritage  resources  and  any  decisions  we  make  in   the   present   will   have   implications   on   their   future   (Milligan,   2007;   Spennemann,   2006).   Thus,   when   it   comes   to   historical   preservation   the   challenge   is   what   buildings  to  save  and  which  ones  to  let  go.

Historical   conservation   has   traditionally   been   entrenched   in   a   top-down   political   process   (Tweed   &   Sutherland,   2007).   Whereby,   many   historical   preservation  efforts  are  done  on  a  piecemeal  basis,  such  as  reacting  to  a  demolition   threat.   Moreover,   heritage   is   often   denoted   on   a   site   through   the   explicit   labeling   (such  as  plaques)  by  experts  who  have  officially  recognized  its  historic  significance   (Tweed  &  Sutherland,  2007).  For  the  most  part,  the  general  public  tends  to  entrust   politicians   and   planners   with   making   the   decisions   of   which   building   are   worth   saving   and   which   we   can   demolish   for   new   construction   (Baer,   1995).   More   specifically,   urban   planners,   politicians,   and   others   involved   in   historical   preservation   are   entrusted   with   acting   within   the   public   interest   to   make   these   decisions  (Leung,  2003).        Quite   often,   historic   conservation   is   considered   more   of   a   luxury   than   a  

necessity,  and  is  often  not  given  the  prominence  it  deserves  on  government  agendas   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011).   The   legacy   of   heritage   conservation   in   Canada   is   not   as   proficient  as  other  countries,  lacking  the  support  and  political  will  to  strengthen  the   existing   political   framework   (Anthony,   2002;   Pannekoek,   2009).   The   system   of   historic   conservation   is   fragmented,   with   some   provinces   and   municipalities   having   outstanding  heritage  programs  and  others  with  little  or  no  support  for  built  heritage   (Pannekoek,  2009;  Shipley,  2011).    The  Federal  government  support  for  heritage  is   limited,   where   this   support   is   often   in   the   form   of   grants   rather   than   implementation   of   a   national   tax   policy   that   would   provide   much   needed   financial   support  for  historic  conservation  efforts  (Anthony,  2002;  Pannekoek,  2009).  There   is   a   need   to   provide   a   uniform   national   legislative   and   planning   framework   for   18     

heritage  that  would  better  serve  to  protect  Canada's  built  heritage  (Bull  &  Seaman,   2008;   Pannekoek,   2009).   This   would   require   better   coordination   between   the   three   levels   of   government,   which   would   better   foster   relationships   between   historians,   planners,  and  the  wider  community  and  elevate  the  issue  of  heritage  out  of  a  niche   and  into  the  larger  public  debate  (Allison  &  Peters,  2011;  Pannekoek,  2009).        This   need   to   integrate   heritage   planning   within   the   wider   urban   planning  

context   would   require   a   good   heritage   governance   system   that   would   allow   for   a   more   creative   and   active   protection   process.   This   is   important   because   protection   and  funding  are  allotted  for  more  popular  landmarks  or  favored  architectural  styles,   which   may   result   in   an   uneven   distribution   of   heritage   conservation   (Tweed   &   Sutherland,   2007).   This   may   also   result   in   some   buildings   being   preserved   and   others   not.   Even   when   they   contribute   to   the   urban   character   of   the   city,   they   provide  the  context  in  which  more  obvious  heritage  buildings  reside,  and  inherently   these  buildings  therefore  have  value  too  (Nasser,  2003;  Tweed  &  Sutherland,  2007).   This   phenomenon   can   put   these   less   recognized   heritage   buildings   at   risk   of   neglect   and   the   possibility   of   falling   into   disrepair,   which   can   ultimately   result   in   their   demolition   (Nasser,   2003).   In   addition,   some   property   owners   `moderniz[e]'   and   renovate  buildings  which  further  degrades  the  historic  merit  of  a  structure  merely   because  these  architectural  features  are  unrecognized  or  undervalued  (Chakrapani   &  Hernandez,  2010).  Therefore  there  is  a  need  to  ensure  that  these  other  buildings   are  still  maintained  in  order  to  prolong  their  life  and  one  way  this  can  be  achieved  is   by   changing   the   definition   of   heritage   to   include   less   obvious   examples   (Nasser,   2003;   Tweed   &   Sutherland,   2007).   Therefore,   conservation   plays   a   very   important   19     

role  in  extending  the  use  of  a  building,  even  when  the  use  changes  (Nasser,  2003).   Moreover,   the   restoration   of   just   one   heritage   building   is   enough   to   start   the   momentum   for   revitalization   of   a   whole   community   and   spur   the   conservation   of   neighbouring  buildings  (Allison  &  Peters,  2011).        More  recently  there  has  been  research  that  integrates  historical  conservation  

with  sustainability,  whether  explicitly  through  the  adaptation  of  heritage  buildings   with   green   technologies   or   by   reinvesting   in   heritage   neighborhoods   instead   of   building   new   ones   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011;   Buddenborg,   2006;   Cunningham   &   Storm,   2008;   Frey,   2007;   Shipley,   2007).   This   movement   has   been   gaining   momentum   and   the   meshing   of   these   two   concepts   is   becoming   more   mainstream   and  is  recognized  by  many  large  heritage  organizations  such  as  the  National  Trust   for  Historic  Preservation  in  the  United  States  and  the  Heritage  Canada  Foundation   (Heritage  Canada  Foundation,  2012;  NTHP,  2012).        Within  the  private  sector,  the  global  shift  towards  more  sustainable  practices  

has  found  its  way  into  the  corporate  citizenship  values  of  an  increasing  amount  of   companies   across   different   industries   (Eichholtz,   Kok,   &   Quigley,   2010;   Hyllegard,   Ogle,  Dunbar,  Fink,  &  Volk,  2003;  Millett,  2009).  Moreover,  many  of  these  companies   who  pledge  more  sustainable  practices  usually  want  to  locate  within  green  buildings   (CoreNET  Global  &  Jones  Lang  LaSalle,  2011).  Companies  who  secure  space  within  a   green   building   potentially   increase   their   appeal   to   employees,   give   them   a   competitive   edge   in   the   industry,   and   save   them   money   in   the   long   term   due   to   energy   savings   (Carpenter,   2011;   Eichholtz,   Kok,   &   Quigley,   2010;   Jantzi-

      Trends   are   changing   and   many   of   the   big-box   retailers   who   predominantly  

located   in   the   suburbs   are   starting   to   rethink   this   form   of   development   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011;   McMahon,   2011).   There   are   a   growing   number   of   factors   that   are   slowly   making   suburban-style   strip   malls   obsolete,   such   as   the   economy,   demographic   shifts,   changing   customer   preferences,   rising   gas   prices,   and   the   growth   of   internet   shopping   (McMahon,   2011).   Many   big-box   retailers   are   experimenting  in  urban  environments  with  infill  projects  and  more  dense  building   21

Different  aspects  of  history  have  different  value  to  different  individuals,  but  what  we   see   worthy   of   preserving   for   future   generations   is   based   on   a   prescribed   value   (Spennemann,  2006).  These  artifacts  and  places  of  the  past  do  not  have  any  intrinsic   value;   it   is   society   that   projects   this   value   onto   these   objects   or   places.   There   are   many   reasons   why   we   preserve   our   heritage,   such   as   evidence   of   technical   achievements,   style   and   aesthetic   beauty,   past   meaningful   events,   nostalgia,   or   nationalism   (ibid.).   Conservation   of   our   heritage   buildings   say   more   than   just   "the   state  of  health  of  the  built  environment  but  also  crucial  to  community  and  cultural   25

neighbourhoods  

character,   which   contributes   to   their   sense   of   place.   This   concept   is   intangible   and   hard   to   measure,   but   place-making  is  defined  as  "the  process   by  which  a  "space  becomes  a  `place'  ­  a   physical   area   that   is   seen   by   its   users   and   others   as   distinct   from   other   areas"   (Pollak,   2011,   p.1).   Place- making   encompasses   a   variety   of   qualities   and   characteristics   such   as,   Toronto's   most   iconic   heritage   buildings   and   "visual,   cultural,   social,   and

environmental"   that   "provides   meaning   to   a   location"   (McMahon,   2010,   p.16).   It   is   derived   from   "the   place's   history,   combination   of   uses,   and   the   feelings   it   evokes"   (Pollak,   2011,   p.1).   Where   heritage   buildings   "represent   layers   of   evolving   traditional   forms   of   architecture   and   city   building"   that   converge   to   create   this   "sense   of   place"   (Nasser,   2003,   p.468).   It   is   important   for   urban   planners   to   recognize   how   the   historic   context   of   space   plays   out   in   place   and   how   this

contributes   to   "sustainable   places,   strengthening   local   identity,   contribut[es]   to   investment,   and   retain[s]   communities"   (as   cited   in   Nasser,   2003,   p.468).   According   to   Nasser   (2003),   a   sustainable   future   for   historic   contexts   "must   be   intrinsically   linked  to  its  past,  not  just  in  the  continuity  of  the  built  heritage  and  urban  spaces  but   also   in   the   living   culture   that   created,   and   is   still   shaping,   the   distinct   townscape,   or   genius  loci,  that  characterizes  heritage  places"  (p.468).        Globalization   has   presented   a   challenge   for   place-making,   due   to   the   mass-

homogenization   that   is   perpetuated   by   technologies   such   as   the   Internet,   telecommunications   and   other   forms   of   mass   media   (Frey,   2007,   p.20).   Although   there   are   many   benefits   that   have   resulted   from   these   technologies   it   has   also   resulted  in  the  erosion  of  our  cultural  distinctions  and  therefore  the  stewardship  of   our  inherited  built  heritage  as  one  way  to  stimulate  cultural  identity.  Neighborhoods   that  contain  old  buildings  contribute  to  the  "intimate"  feeling  and  "sense  of  history   and   security"   in   the   place-making   of   a   community,   and   therefore   solidifying   their   position   as   an   intricate   and   vital   piece   of   the   puzzle   (Vancouver   Heritage   Foundation,  n.d.,  p.13).  Therefore  conservation  of  the  older  building  stock  "creates   spaces   and   opportunities   for   cultural   activities   that   encourage   active   neighbourhoods   with   rich   personalities"   (ibid.).   Historic   buildings   present   the   opportunity  to  bring  communities  together  in  civic  engagement  acting  as  a  focus  for   a  community  to  rally  for  its  protection.      Historic  Preservation  does  not  necessarily  mean  to  oppose  progress  and  new  

development   and   it   is   more   than   simply   preserving   historic   events.   Many   people

tend  to  restore  for  architectural  value  and  simply  to  respect  the  built  characteristics   of  their  neighbourhoods  (Milligan,  2007).  McMahon  (2010)  claims  that  some  urban   planners  have  underestimated  the  importance  of  place-making  and  have  "spent  too   much  time  focusing  on  numbers:  the  number  of  units  per  acre,  the  number  of  cars   per   hour,   the   number   of   floors   per   building,   and   not   enough   time   on   the   values,   customs,   characteristics,   and   quirks   that   make   a   place   worth   caring   about"   (p.16).     As   a   result,   many   communities   are   "suffering   the   social,   economic,   and   environmental  consequences  of  being  places  that  simply  aren't  worth  caring  about"   (ibid.).   The   more   a   place   starts   to   look   like   every   other   place,   is   a   failure   for   the   urban   planning   community,   and   which   is   why   planning   needs   to   incorporate   a   communities  heritage,  and  one  tangible  way  of  doing  this  is  through  the  protection   and  maintenance  of  historic  buildings.     Economic  Benefits  of  Heritage  Conservation:      Heritage   conservation   can   have   a   significant   effect   on   local   economies.   The  

rehabilitation   of   older   buildings   can   yield   a   return   on   investment   for   both   the   property   owner   and   their   tenants,   with   regards   to   income   generation   from   tourism,   cost   savings   though   increased   building   energy   efficiency,   and   the   opportunity   to   attract  tenants.       Tourism:      Tourism   is   vital   to   Canada's   economy,   employing   over   617,300   people   and  

contributing   approximately   2%   of   Canada's   Gross   Domestic   Product   (Canadian   Tourism   Commission   [CTC],   2011).   In   2010,   approximately   15.9   million   28     

international   visitors   made   overnight   trips   to   Canada   (ibid.).      In   the   same   year,   Toronto   welcomed   9.9   million   over-night   visitors   (Morrow,   2011).   Domestic   tourists  make  up  the  bulk  of  Toronto's  visits,  accounting  for  over  2/3  of  all  visitors,   and   Americans   making   up   1/5   (ibid.).   International   tourists   have   also   been   on   the   rise,   especially   from   developing   powerhouses   like   China,   India   and   Brazil,   who   represented   13.4%   of   Toronto's   tourists   (ibid.).   The   immense   growth   of   the   tourism   industry  across  the  globe  has  resulted  in  "uniformity"  within  the  industry,  which  has   become   evident   in   "standardized   hotel   architecture,   restaurant   chains,   and   street   furniture"  (Nasser,  2003,  p.467).        One  way  in  which  a  community  can  maintain  a  competitive  position  within  the  

tourism   industry   is   to   provide   a   unique   tourist   experience.   Therefore,   heritage   tourism   has   become   a   popular   way   to   increase   local   economic   development,   whereby   a   community   can   leverage   its   local   resources   and   assets   as   a   means   of   providing   this   unique   tourist   experience   (Madden   &   Shipley,   2011).   Heritage   tourism   is   considered   a   "subset"   within   the   tourism   industry   (Madden   &   Shipley,   2011,   p.2).   The   Canadian   Tourism   Commission   [CTC]   defines   heritage   tourism   as   tourists  who  are  interested  in  "heritage-oriented  activities  when  they  travel"  (CTC,   2003).   According   to   the   Canadian   Tourism   Commission   as   of   2000,   34   million   Americans  identify  themselves  as  being  heritage  enthusiasts  (Research  Resolutions   and   Consulting,   2003,   p.3).   Of   the   34   million,   approximately   8.3   million   have   visited   the   Canada   recently,   leaving   ample   opportunity   for   growth   in   this   sector,   which   is   already   considered   the   "largest   individual   special   interest   group   visiting   Canada"   (Research  Resolutions  and  Consulting,  2003,  p.3;  Madden  &  Shipley,  2011,  p.2).   29     

  

Although   major   heritage   sites   and   landmarks   attract   tourists   to   a   city,   these  

places   only   receive   between   3%   and   7%   of   tourism   money   (PlaceEconomics,   2010).   The   majority   of   tourists   spend   93   ­   97%   of   their   expenditures   on   restaurants,   hotels,   shops,   and   transportation   (ibid.).   In   addition,   heritage   tourists   have   been   found  to  stay  approximately  4.7  nights  longer  and  spend  78%  more  in  restaurants   than  the  average  tourist  (Mason,  2005,  p.9).  In  order  to  maintain  a  strong  tourism   industry,   there   is   strong   incentive   to   "conserve   the   local   built   environment   and   heritage   traditions"   (Madden   &   Shipley,   2011,   p.2).   Nasser   (2003)   claims   that,   tourism  presents  a  challenge  for  urban  planners  to  minimize  the  "adverse  impacts"   yet  maximize  the  "gains"  (p.478).  Moreover,  the  management  of  cultural  resources,   the   integration   of   "quality"   new   development,   building   usage   and   activities,   and   integrating  these  factors  with  the  "socio-cultural  needs  of  the  local  community"  are   important  issues  urban  planners  will  have  to  address  (ibid.).  Therefore,  the  local  BIA   can  be  useful  source  of  knowledge  of  the  local  community  that  planners  can  utilize   when  creating  a  strategy  for  tourism.     Building  Operating  Efficiency:      The   operating   efficiency   of   a   building   is   defined   as   the   required   amount   of  

energy  needed  to  operate  heating,  cooling,  electricity,  and  water  usage  throughout  a   building's   life   span   (National   Trust   for   Historic   Preservation   [NTHP],   2011,   p.16).   The   growing   body   of   literature   on   sustainability   and   heritage   conservation   has   presented  a  case  against  the  misconception  that  historic  buildings  are  "energy  hogs"   (Frey,   2007,   p.11).   Moreover,   this   assumption   has   worked   in   the   favour   of  

30     

demolition  of  old  buildings  for  new  buildings  perceived  to  be  more  energy  efficient   (NTHP,   2011,   p.18).   Quite   often   the   greenest   building   is   one   that   already   exists.   Many  buildings  from  the  early  20th  century  are  inherently  more  sustainable  (ibid.).   For   example,   the   U.S.   Energy   Information   Administration   found   that   commercial   buildings  built  pre-1920s,  "use  less  energy,  per  square  foot,  than  buildings  from  any   other   decade   of   construction"   ­   even   the   newest   green   construction   interventions   only  provide  a  marginal  improvement  to  energy  performance  (ibid.).  This  advantage   of   older   buildings   may   be   explained   because   they   were   built   with   environmental   conditions   in   mind,   such   as   thicker   stone   or   brick   walls,   natural   ventilation,   high   ceilings,   large   operable   windows,   window   shutters   and   porches   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011).   Where   "their   durability   gives   them   almost   unlimited   `renewability'"   (as   cited   in  Allison  &  Peters,  2011,  p.169).        A   comprehensive   study   conducted   by   the   National   Trust   for   Historic  

Preservation   (2011)   found   that   "building   reuse   almost   always   yields   fewer   environmental  impacts  than  new  construction  when  comparing  buildings  of  similar   size   and   functionality"   (p.vi).   Since   approximately   85%   of   a   building's   energy   consumption   is   due   to   operations   throughout   time,   it   would   make   sense   that   a   property   owner   would   benefit   from   cost   savings   of   providing   a   more   efficient   building   (Frey,   2007,   p.11).   Existing   buildings   provide   opportunity   to   be   reused   and   retrofitted  with  green  technologies  in  a  way  that  would  be  sensitive  to  the  "historic   fabric"  of  a  community  (ibid.).

Attracting  Tenants:        Heritage   features   of   a   building,   whether   architectural   significance,   historic  

story  or  significant  event  that  took  place  on  the  property  can  add  value  to  a  property   for  prospective  tenants  (Alderton,  2010).  This  is  especially  true  when  coupled  with   green  technologies  that  help  make  the  building  more  sustainable  (Frey,  2007).  Frey   (2007)  states,  "historic  resources  can  increase  economic  competitiveness  by  helping   create   a   dynamic   environment   that   draws   highly   skilled   workers"   ­   the   "Creative   Class"  (p.17)      Coined   by   University   of   Toronto   professor,   Richard   Florida   who   authored,   The  

Rise  of  the  Creative  Class,  the  creative  class  is  a  rising  group  of  professionals  in  our   changing  economy.  The  creative  class  has  risen  as  a  result  of  a  changing  economy  ­   one   that   is   more   knowledgeable   and   information   based   and   relies   on   human   creativity   (Florida,   2002).   Florida   (2002)   defines   class   as   "a   cluster   of   people   who   have   common   interests   and   tend   to   think,   feel   and   behave   similarly,   but   these   similarities   are   fundamentally   determined   by   economic   function   ­   by   the   kind   of   work  they  do  for  a  living"  (p.8).  These  are  people  who  tend  to  have  a  high  level  of   education   or   human   capital.   The   "core"   creative   industries   are   science   and   engineering,   architecture   and   design,   education,   art,   music,   and   entertainment,   whose   economic   function   is   to   create   new   ideas,   new   technology   and/or   new   creative   content.   It   also   includes   a   broader   group   of   "creative   professionals"   who   work  in  business  and  finance,  law,  health  care,  and  related  fields  (Florida,  2002,  p.7).   What   is   unique   about   the   creative   class   is   that   they   prefer   to   cluster   in   cities   that   allow  them  to  both  live  and  work  in  creative  and  culturally  rich  cities.   32

out   distinctive   urban   communities   (Florida,   2002).   The   older   buildings   and   warehouses  that  line  the  arterial  streets  of  many  BIAs  hold  the  potential  to  become   prime   studio   and   office   spaces   for   creative   industries   who   tend   to   favour   such   accommodations,   especially   when   they   have   been   rehabilitated   with   green   features.   Companies   who   locate   within   such   buildings   not   only   elevate   their   reputation,   it   also   gives   a   competitive   edge   for   attracting   and   retaining   "the   best   people"   (Zimmerman,  2008).  According  to  Persram,  Lucuik,  and  Larsson  (2007),  "employees   are   increasingly   making   professional   decisions   based   on   corporate   ethics   and   social   responsibility"   and   may   choose   a   green   building   to   work   in   rather   than   for   a   company   not   located   in   such   a   building   (p.4).   The   allure   of   heritage   buildings   is   due   to  their  inherit  character  of  contributing  to  the  "richness  and  diversity  of  the  built   environment"   (Frey,   2007,   p.17).   Ironically,   the   same   inherit   features   with   make   heritage   buildings   more   sustainable   such   as   thick   stone   or   brick   walls,   natural   ventilation,  high  ceilings,  large  operable  windows,  window  shutters  and  porches  can   also   contribute   to   a   more   creative   work   atmosphere   for   potential   tenants   (Allison   &   Peters,  2011).      Historic  buildings  provide  companies  the  ability  to  show  they  have  "roots"  in  

the   community   (Florida,   2002).   Moreover,   historic   preservation   tends   to   favour   small   business,   a   significant   source   of   employment   in   Canada   ­   "the   configuration   of   historic  buildings  (often  2500  ­  3500  square  feet  per  floor)  are  a  good  match  for  the   space  needs  of  small  businesses,  which  typically  employ  12-20  people"  (Frey,  2007,   p.17;   Industry   Canada,   2011).   There   are   many   examples   in   Canada   of   `heritage   33     

related'  neighbourhoods  that  have  become  magnets  of  development  and  popularity   such   as   Gastown   in   Vancouver,   the   Forks   in   Winnipeg,   the   Historic   Waterfront   in   Halifax,   Old   Montreal,   and   the   St.   Lawrence   Market,   Liberty   Village   and   Distillery   District   in   Toronto.   These   historic   attributes   provide   a   competitive   "edge"   in   attracting  businesses  to  the  area  (City  of  Edmonton,  2012).      Heritage  conservation  projects  have  been  attributed  to  spurring  new  life  into  

downtown   neighbourhoods   and   small   towns   (Allison   &   Peters,   2011).      A   study   conducted   by   Lea   T.   et   al.   (2004)   found   that   in   Vancouver,   B.C.   the   restoration   of   Stanley   Theatre   resulted   in   a   increase   in   pedestrian   traffic,   "21%   increase   in   restaurants,   cafes,   and   bars   in   the   nearby   area,"   a   "9%   increase   in   cultural   establishments,  such  as  the  design  sector"  as  well  as  attracting  large  retailers  such   as   "Chapters   in   1997,   Restoration   Hardware   in   1998,   and   Pottery   Barn   in   2003"   (p.10).  Moreover,  heritage  properties  themselves  tend  to  be  more  stable  in  the  real   estate   market.   According   to   Shipley's   (2000)   comprehensive   study   that   looked   at   the  impacts  of  heritage  designation  on  property  values  in  24  Ontario  communities,   found  that  "59%  of  designated  heritage  properties  had  higher  property  values  than   the  average  when  compared  to  surrounding  market  trends  within  the  community"   (p.92).   He   also   found   that   "47%   of   designated   heritage   properties   increased   in   values  despite  the  downward  trend  of  the  market"  (p.93).      Surprisingly,   one   of   the   largest   obstacles   in   attracting   tenants   is   actually   the  

property  owner  themselves,  often  resulting  in  the  hindrance  of  their  tenants  ability   to  operate  efficiently  (The  Business  Link,  2009).  Proper  upkeep  and  maintenance  is  

34     

important   in   both   luring   and   keeping   tenants   (ibid.).   Therefore   restoration,   rehabilitation,   or   conservation   of   an   historic   building   can   be   an   opportunity   for   property   owners   to   invest   in   their   property   to   attract   new   tenants.   The   necessary   upgrades   and   renovations   of   a   historic   property   are   likely   to   yield   a   return   on   investment   for   the   property   owner   especially   when   they   include   sustainable   and   operating   efficiency   features.   The   global   2010   CoreNET   Global   and   Jones   Lang   LaSalle   Sustainability   Report   found   that   "sustainability   is   a   critical   business   issue"   for   64%   of   their   respondents,   of   which   92%   would   factor   sustainability   when   scouting  a  location  to  do  business  (CoreNET  Global  &  Jones  Lang  LaSalle,  2011,  p.2).   Therefore,  potential  tenants  are  reassured  by  third  party  certification,  the  higher  the   LEED   and/or   BOMA  BESt   certification  the  more  desirable  the  office  space  would  be   for  potential  tenants.      Historic  buildings  appeal  to  a  wide  range  of  large  retailers  who  have  adopted  

various  values  of  corporate  citizenship/responsibility.  Hyllegard,  Ogle,  Dunbar,  Fink,   and   Volk   (2003)   define   corporate   citizenship   as   "the   responsibility   of   business   to   enrich   the   society   in   which   it   operates,   and   it   has   been   conceptualized   broadly   to   include   social   causes   such   as   animal   rights,   child   welfare,   education,   environmentalism/pollution,   historic   preservation,   homelessness,   medical  

advances,  poverty,  and  sustainability  "  (p.2  ­  3).  Some  examples  of  businesses  that   have   been   recognized   for   their   efforts   to   be   outstanding   corporate   citizens   and   environmental  commitment  are   Avon,  Recreational  Equipment  Inc.  (REI),  Starbucks,   Target,  Aveda,  B  &  Q,  The  Body  Shop,   and  Patagonia  (ibid.).  Therefore,  revitalizing  a   historic   building   may   attract   companies   to   become   a   tenant   because   of   corporate   35     

ideals  that  value  historic  conservation.   Benefits  of  Heritage  Conservation:  Case  Study:  Starbucks  Coffee  Canada:      Since   the   first   Starbucks'   location   open   in   1971   at   the   historic   Pike   Place  

Market   in   Seattle,   Washington,   the   company   has   prided   itself   on   the   ability   to   provide   exceptional   high-quality   coffee,   tea,   and   other   products   that   invite   customers   into   the   `third   place'   atmosphere   in   Starbucks   stores   (Starbucks   Coffee   Company,   2011).   The   company   takes   pride   in   its   heritage   and   has   a   long   legacy   of   providing  legendary  service  to  its  customers,  and  Starbucks'  mission  statement  is  "to   inspire  and  nurture  the  human  spirit  ­  one  person,  one  cup  and  one  neighborhood   at   a   time"   (ibid.).   Starbucks   has   certainly   grown   from   its   original   Pike   Place   location,   having   over   17,000   locations   worldwide,   becoming   a   neighbourhood   gathering   place  and  a  part  of  daily  routines  for  customers  all  of  the  world  (ibid.).  Furthermore,   Starbucks   is   committed   to   its   corporate   values   that   include   every   aspect   of   the   company's   core   business,   which   includes:   ethical   sourcing,   environmental   stewardship,   and   community   involvement   (ibid.).   One   way   in   which   Starbucks   has   worked  to  reduce  its  environmental  footprint  is  by  integrating  green  construction  in   their   stores,   legitimizing   the   claim,   "sustainable   design   and   build   methodologies   are   part  of  our  DNA"  (Starbucks  Coffee  Company,  2011a).      Starbucks'   commitment   for   creating   more   sustainable   stores   started   over   a  

decade   ago.   In   2000,   Starbucks   joined   the   U.S.   Green   Building   Council   [USGBC],   opening   their   first   LEED   certified   store   in   Hillsboro,   Oregon,   in   2005   (Starbucks   Coffee   Company,   2011b).   Starbucks   has   been   on   the   forefront   of   adopting   green

construction   concepts   for   their   stores,   being   one   of   the   first   companies   to   sign   on   the   LEED   for   Retail   pilot   program,   which   looked   at   adapting   LEED   New   Construction   [LEED   NC]   and   LEED   Commercial   Interiors   [LEED   CI]   for   restaurant's   and   retailers   (ibid.).   In   2009,   Starbucks   was   one   of   the   first   retailers   to   participate   in   the   LEED   Volume   pilot   program   (ibid.).   The   LEED   Volume   program   is   intended   for   "organizations   planning   to   certify   a   large   number   of   design   and   construction   projects   or   existing   buildings"   ­   yet   another   indicator   of   Starbucks   strong   commitment   to   sustainable   stores   (U.S.   Green   Building   Council,   2011).   Participation   in  the   LEED  Volume   pilot  program  was  a  huge  initiative  for   Starbucks,  who  opened   10  stores  in  different  countries  across  the  globe  within  varying  climate  zones,  with   green   building   techniques.   With   great   success,   these   stores   were   "audited   and   accepted"   by   the   USGBC,   bringing   Starbucks   closer   to   their   LEED   goals   (Starbucks   Coffee   Company,   2011b).   By   the   end   of   2010,   Starbucks   has   been   working   toward   having  all  company-owned  new  stores  to  have  LEED  certification  (ibid.).          It   is   the   strong   leadership   from   the   company's   Chairman   &   CEO,   Howard  

Schultz   and   the   Senior   Leadership   Team   that   has   really   pushed   the   LEED   certification   stores   to   fruition.   These   efforts   of   Starbucks   have   resulted   in   the   restoration  of  older  (and  sometimes  historic)  buildings  in  cities  all  over  the  world  in   which   their   shops   are   situated.   An   interview   with   David   Martin,   Construction   Manager   for   Starbucks   Coffee   Canada   provided   some   insight   on   how   Starbucks   design   and   construct   their   stores.   As   Starbucks   continues   to   achieve   LEED   certification   for   their   stores   under   the   LEED   CI   program,   they   are   discovering   that   LEED   is   not   that   difficult   or   expensive   over   conventional   construction   (D.   Martin,   37     

personal   communication,   March   23,   2012).   Although   there   are   certain   aspects   of   the   green  construction  process  that  are  expensive,  it  tends  to  roughly  balance  out  to  the   cost  of  building  without  sustainability  in  mind  (ibid.).      The   commitment   to   LEED   certification   and   green   construction   has   dramatically   changed   how   Starbucks   constructs   its   stores,   approaching   each   store   individually  and  looking  at  the  neighbourhoods  they  open  in.  Starbucks  is  one  of  the   few   multinational   corporations   who   integrate   sustainable   practices   with   the   reuse   of   older   buildings,   making   them   an   ideal   tenant   for   urban   communities   where   there   is   an   older   building   stock.   One   of   the   major   reasons   for   this   is   because   the   requirements   for   Starbucks   shops   are   malleable   to   any   building   (D.   Martin,   personal   communication,   March   23,   2012).   That   being   the   case,   whenever   possible,   Starbucks   prefers   to   locate   within   an   existing   building   (ibid.).   According   to   David   Martin,   the   character   of   an   old   building   is   unparalleled   to   new   construction   ­   "that's   the   beauty   of   it,   we   love   old   buildings   it   speaks   to   the   brand"   (ibid.).   Although   Starbucks   has   been   involved   in   the   reuse   of   old   buildings   for   their   stores   for   many   years,   their   newest  commitment  to   LEED  construction  only  makes  old  buildings  more  lucrative.   Starbucks  follows  the  USGBC's  requirements  (even  in  Canada)  and  21  points  would   get  stores  the  LEED  certified  rating,  and  on  this  rating  system   Starbucks   gets  extra   points   for   reusing   existing   building   materials   (ibid.).   Below   are   two   examples   of   Starbucks  locations  in  Toronto  that  are  sensitive  to  the  history  of  the  building:

(Hernandez   &   Jones,   2005;   MMAH,   2010).   BIAs   are   essentially   sub- governing   bodies   under

It  is  important  to  explore  how  BIAs  view  the  heritage  properties  within  their  

communities,   what   challenges   arise,   and   what   potential   role   can   they   play   in   the   44

Shipley,   Jonas   and   Kovacs   (2011),   the   majority   of   this   resistance   is   situated   in   "fear,   rumour,  and  lack  of  understanding"  (p.612).  This  push  back  tends  to  stem  from  the   idea   that   HCDs   freeze   development   in   an   area,   which   would   in   turn   hurt   property   values   (ibid.).   This   has   lead   to   a   process   where   the   majority   of   the   "initiative[s]   to   recognize   historic   areas   generally   comes   from   citizens   or   local   heritage   advisory   groups"   rather   than   an   official   government   lead   process   (ibid.,   p.616).   Although   this   process  has  resulted  in  the  protection  of  various  historic  areas,  the  reactive  nature   of   the   government   has   created   as   situation   where   many   "historically   significant"   areas  go  unprotected  due  to  a  lack  of  local  interest  (ibid.).        In   Ontario,   there   are   approximately   104   HCDs,   and   the   number   is   growing   as  

more   plans   are   in   the   process   of   approval   or   being   proposed   (Ministry   of   Culture,   2012a;   Shipley,   Jonas   &   Kovacs,   2011).   Within   Toronto,   the   majority   of   existing   HCDs   are   residential   areas,   with   an   under   representation   in   commercial   districts.   Currently,   there   are   only   three   approved   HCDs   in   Toronto   that   have   a   commercial   component   ­   Union   Station   HCD   and   Queen   Street   West   HCD,   and   one   mixed   residential   and   commercial,   Yorkville-Hazelton   Ave   HCD   (Ministry   of   Culture,   2012a).   When   HCDs   are   predominately   commercial   in   use,   BIAs   become   an   even   more   important   stakeholder.   As   more   commercial   districts   become   designated   HCDs,   more   BIAs   will   have   to   be   able   to   understand   the   benefits   this   designation   brings   them   and   how   they   can   use   it   to   their   benefit.   For   example,   the   North   Downtown  Yonge  Street  Planning  Framework  is  exploring  the  possibility  of  creating   a  HCD  on  a  portion  of  Yonge  Street  (from  Bloor  to  College  Streets)  and  Church  Street   (from   Hayden   to   Alexander   Streets)   which   would   directly   impact   three   surrounding   49

architecturally   significant,   and   a   local   landmark   in   the   community

Toronto,  2011).  The  building  was  first  added  to  the  city's  heritage  registry  in  1974,   and   was   officially   designated   in   2010   in   response   to   the   owner's   request   for   demolition   (ibid.).   The   building   fell   into   poor   structural   condition,   and   in   April   2010   a  wall  collapsed,  and  eventually  the  building  was  a  victim  of  arson  in  2011,  and  the   building  could  not  be  salvaged  and  was  demolished  (ibid.).      The  only  positive  outcome  of  this  situation  was  that  this  disaster  stimulated  a  

lot   of   debate   over   heritage   management   in   the   city.   The   loss   of   the   Empress   Hotel   really   affected   the   councilor   of   the   area,   Kristyn   Wong-Tam,   who   became   active   in

to   use   to   entice   property   owners   in   their   boundaries   to   invest   in   their   building   facades.    This  grant  covers  up  to  50%  of  eligible  costs  for  a  maximum  of  $10,000  for   mid-block   properties   and   $12,500   for   corner   properties   (City   of   Toronto,   n.d.).   There  are  a  set  of  requirements  the  property  owner  must  satisfy  in  order  to  get  the   grant.   Furthermore,   the   BIA   itself   must   be   at   least   5   years   old   for   this   grant   to   be   available   for   their   use,   excluding   newer   BIAs   from   taking   part   (BIA   member,   personal   communication,   March   29,   2012).   The   Commercial   Façade   Improvement   Program   for   BIAs   comes   with   another   set   of   challenges.   According   to   the   Toronto   Heritage  Management  Plan  (2007),  there  is  no  formal  link  between  the   Commercial   Façade  Improvement  Program  for  BIAs  and  heritage  grants  (except  to  the  buildings   on   the   registry).   This   has   lead   to   some   `façade   improvements'   resulting   in   destruction   of   unrecognized   heritage   attributes   of   buildings   not   on   Toronto's   heritage   registry.   There   is   a   need   to   strengthen   this   relationship   and   BIAs   become   important   facilitators   in   the   grant   process   to   ensure   that   heritage   features   are   not   lost  during  the  façade  improvements.     How  BIAs  are  Vital  to  the  Heritage  Management  Process:      BIAs  have  an  interesting  position  in  terms  of  heritage  management,  especially  

when   considering   the   fact   that   they   are   entrusted   with   maintaining   economic   vitality  of  the  area.  They  have  to  balance  both  the  interests  of  stimulating  business   while  also  maintaining  an  attractive  environment  for  customers  and  potential  new   business   growth.   This   can   be   a   challenge   when   considering   that   BIA   boundaries   57

think   of   18th   and   late   19th   century   time   frame,   but   there  is  also  value  in  heritage  buildings  in  other  eras   and  it  helps  us  to  see  the  progression  in  terms  of  the   58     

built   form"   (personal   communication,   March   22,   2012).   There   was   also   this   understanding  for  the  Queen  St.  West  BIA,  which  is  a  Heritage  Conservation  District,   claiming  that  "heritage  is  the  rhythm  of  the  neighbourhood  not  the  focus"  and  that   the  challenge  is  making  the  HCD  work  for  everyone,  even  non-contributing  buildings   within   the   designated   district   (BIA   member,   personal   communication,   March   29,   2012).      The  reality  is  that  although  heritage  buildings  are  very  important  assets  for  a  

community,  BIAs  need  to  maintain  focus  on  creating  a  vibrant  retail  atmosphere,  as   one   BIA   member   put   it   "there   is   a   balance   between   heritage   conservation   and   the   realities   of   the   neighbourhood"   (BIA   member,   personal   communication,   March   22,   2012).   Most   of   the   BIAs   spoke   to   the   need   for   the   importance   of   flexibility   of   heritage  buildings,  as  one  BIA  member  put  it,  "you  protect  the  built  form,  not  the  use   of   the   built   form"   (personal   communication,   March   29,   2012).   One   of   the   greatest   challenges  to  BIAs  is  the  ability  to  strike  this  balance  and  making  heritage  work  for   the  individual  businesses  and  property  owners,  rather  than  becoming  an  obstacle.      Central   to   the   success   of   BIAs   is   maintaining   a   strong   relationship   with   its  

members   and   property   owners   within   its   boundaries.   This   strong   relationship   creates   an   environment   in   which   BIAs   are   able   to   provide   suggestions   and   advice   when   a   property   owner   is   considering   altering   their   building.   The   majority   of   the   BIAs   interviewed   tend   to   meet   with   property   owners   frequently,   and   report   that   property   owners   tend   to   ask   them   for   suggestions   and   resources   when   they   are   considering   renovations   or   alterations   to   their   property.   The   importance   of   relationships   for   BIAs   also   extends   to   developers,   the   private   sector,   the   public,   and   59     

potential  tenants  and  property  owners.  BIAs  can  foster  alliances  with  these  groups   to  create  awareness  of  what  the  BIA  envisions  for  the  community.      The   merit   of   a   BIA's   relationship   with   property   owners   creates   a   more  

intimate  approach  to  the  heritage  process.  BIAs  become  important  in  facilitating  and   educating  property  owners  on  which  city  departments  to  talk  to,  what  benefits  can   be  achieved  when  conserving  heritage  buildings  and  what  financial  incentives  may   be   available.   When   approached   for   how   to   restore   a   property,   the   Downtown   Yonge   BIA  [DYBIA]  provided  details  on  a  rather  in  depth  consultation  process  they  would   undertake   with   the   property   owner.   This   would   include   an   overview   of   the   regulatory   guidelines   for   the   area,   showcasing   local   best   practices,   the   economic   benefits,   financial   incentives   available   and   if   warranted,   a   conceptual   rendering   of   the   property   highlighting   opportunities   of   the   restoration   and   the   importance   of   ground  floor  experience  (BIA  member,  personal  communication,  March  22,  2012).        The   DYBIA   is   fortunate   to  

have   an   area   specific   program,   Bright  Lights  ­  Big  City,  A  Signage   Vision   for   the   Downtown   Yonge   Strip,   that   provides   an   added   incentive   for   property   owners   to   maintain   (Downtown   their   Yonge   properties   Business

Gerrard   and   Queen   Streets   allows   property   owners   to   obtain   extra   revenue   through   the   addition   of   third-party   signage   on   their   buildings   (ibid.).   This   program   is   sensitive  to  heritage  buildings,  requiring  that  the  signs  added  to  heritage  buildings   not  detract  from  heritage  features.  Moreover,  in  order  to  be  approved  for  a  sign  or   billboard,  a  property  owner  must  undertake  certain  building  improvements  to  bring   up  their  heritage  building  to  an  adequate  condition,  and  this  must  be  approved  by   the  DYBIA  (BIA  member,  personal  communication,  March  22,  2012).      This  section  puts  an  emphasis  on  the  importance  of  the  relationship  between  

BIAs  and  their  members.  These  relationships  put  BIAs  in  a  very  strategic  position  of   ensuring   that   the   property   owner   makes   the   right   considerations   with   their   property   as   to   further   contribute   to   the   community.   These   relationships   become   increasingly   important   when   these   alterations   are   to   an   older   building   that   may   have  unrecognized  heritage  attributes  or  a  property  on  Toronto's  heritage  registry.   Challenges  and  Obstacles  for  BIAs  protecting  Heritage:      It  is  important  to  recognize  that  BIAs  come  in  all  shapes  and  sizes  and  run  by  a  

various   degree   of   individuals   with   different   qualifications   and   backgrounds.   The   irregularity   in   the   size   of   BIAs   can   present   some   challenges   with   respect   to   the   degree  of  influence  BIAs  have  in  shaping  their  community  and  heritage  stewardship.   In   direct   relation   to   the   size   of   the   BIA   is   the   amount   of   funding   that   can   be   leveraged   from   the   property   taxes   of   its   members,   and   BIA's   annual   budgets   tend   to   range  from  $200,000  to  over  $1,500,000.  These  budgetary  restraints  also  impact  the   number   of   staff   that   a   BIA   can   hire.   Moreover,   BIAs   are   consider   sub-governing   bodies   that   operate   under   the   authority   of   the   municipality,   who   hold   the   power   61     

when   it   comes   to   regulating   BIAs   as   mandated   through   the   Municipal   Code   or   the   Toronto  Act.        These   realties   place   limitations   on   how   a   BIA   can   operate   effectively   when   it  

comes   to   influencing   the   built   form   of   their   community,   especially   in   terms   of   promoting   heritage   conservation.   BIAs   have   no   legal   authority   to   tell   property   owners   what   to   do,   hence   why   their   relationships   are   extremely   important   (BIA   member,   personal   communication,   March   20,   2012).   Putting   these   legislative   obstacles   aside,   BIAs   work   within   the   existing   framework   and   make   the   most   of   the   resources   available   to   them,   doing   their   best   to   provide   property   owners   with   the   necessary   information   to   make   an   informed   decision   in   the   management   of   properties.   Despite   the   many   benefits   of   heritage   conservation,   there   are   many   obstacles   that   BIAs   face   when   it   comes   to   getting   property   owners   to   see   these   benefits  for  their  individual  property  and  the  community  as  a  whole.        Many   BIAs   spoke   to   the   desire   to   have   flexibility   in   terms   of   how   property  

owners  can  use  heritage  buildings,  because  "commercial  districts  are  always  in  flux"   (BIA   member,   personal   communication,   March   16,   2012).   Therefore,   these   older   buildings   need   to   be   adaptable   to   accommodate   the   "modern   features   that   attract   modern   tenants"   (BIA   member,   personal   communication,   March   22,   2012).   An   example  of  these  modern  additions  would  be  the  installation  of  operable  windows,   which  allows  for  a  "pseudo-patio  experience"  and  gives  business  an  opportunity  to   interact  with  the  street.  Some  heritage  experts  may  feel  that  these  sorts  of  additions   would   detract   from   the   original   integrity   of   the   building   (ibid.).   The   idea   is   to   not   make  heritage  conservation  an  obstacle;  this  BIA  member  went  on  to  say,  "with  the   62     

right  level  of  review  and  proper  materials,  it  can  actually  bring  more  people  to  see   the  benefits  of  reusing  heritage  buildings"  (ibid.).      Flexibility  also  becomes  important  when  you  consider  the  market  demand  for  

large-format   retail.   According   to   one   BIA   member,   "the   idea   of   small-scale   retail   is   seen  as  old  school"  (BIA  member,   personal  communication,  March  16,  2012).  These   market   pressures   put   strain   on   heritage   communities   that   do   not   have   the   available   space  for  such  large-scale  tenants,  which  can  render  the  use  of  a  heritage  building   obsolete   and   put   it   at   risk   of   neglect   or   demolition   if   its   use   is   not   re-imagined   to   remain   competitive   in   the   market   again.   This   issue   with   commercial   floor   space   is   crucial   for   maintaining   the   economic   vitality   of   the   community,   if   businesses   are   priced   out   or   need   to   expand,   they   usually   want   find   a   new   space   within   the   community,   but   if   it   cannot   accommodate   them,   they   will   be   forced   to   leave   (BIA   member,  personal  communication,  March  29,  2012).        This   is   where   education   of   property   owners   becomes   important.   BIAs   have  

found   that   in   talking   to   their   members,   even   when   they   are   willing   to   restore   or   reuse   heritage   buildings,   there   is   not   a   wide   understanding   of   what   the   heritage   designation  means.  Some  BIAs  have  the  resources  to  educate  their  members  of  the   benefits  of  heritage  conservation,  but  the  capability  for  every  BIA  to  take  on  this  role   is  limited  due  to  size  and  budgeting  realities.    Public  awareness  was  found  to  be  one   of  the  biggest  challenges,  and  there  was  often  noted  to  be  a  divide  between  what  the   property   owners   want   and   what   the   tenants   want.   Property   owners   have   been   found  to  be  their  biggest  obstacle,  such  as  not  maintaining  their  building  so  that  it   better   accommodate   current   tenants   or   potentially   attract   new   ones.   There   are   63     

various   reasons   for   this   phenomenon;   sometimes   property   owners   just   do   not   see   the   value   in   heritage   conservation,   while   other   property   owners   just   do   not   have   budget  to  maintain  their  facades.        One  of  the  largest  obstacles  for  BIAs  is  how  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  the  

business   community   with   limited   help   from   the   municipal   government.   Although   there   are   cost   sharing   programs   available   to   BIAs   such   as   the   Capital   Cost-share   Program,   Commercial  Façade  Improvement  Program,  and   Mural  Program,  as  well  as   heritage   related   grants   like   Heritage   Property   Tax   Rebate   Program   and   Toronto   Heritage   Grant   Program,   many   BIAs   felt   that   the   city's   role   stops   short   at   financial   aid.  Even  when  a  BIA  has  a  willingness  to  participate  in  heritage  conservation,  there   is  a  demand  for  them  to  be  able  to  utilize  the  resources  and  expertise  at  City  Hall,   but   this   support   from   the   municipality   is   still   viewed   as   scarce.   With   respect   to   heritage   conservation,   many   BIAs   felt   that   they   were   disconnected   from   the   planning   process   at   City   Hall,   especially   with   Toronto   Preservation   Services.   Although  it  was  understood  that  Toronto  Preservation  Services  is  an  overburdened   department   of   the   municipality,   their   assistance   has   been   limited   to   financial   support.   BIAs   often   felt   that   they   were   expected   to   be   heritage   experts,   but   the   majority   of   them   do   not   have   this   expertise.   Moreover,   it   was   reportedly   more   difficult  to  obtain  this  much  desired  heritage  consultation  and  expertise,  as  well  as   set   up   meetings   with   Toronto   Preservation   Services   to   discuss   heritage   conservation.           64     

Opportunities  and  Challenges  with  Heritage  Conservation  Districts  and  BIAs:      According   to   Shipley,   Jonas   and   Kovacs   (2011),   "many   civic   officials   now  

consider   the   HCD   to   be   one   of   the   most   effective   tools   not   only   for   historic   conservation   but   also   for   good   urban   design   and   sound   planning"   (p.621).   As   Toronto  continues  to  designate  Heritage  Conservation  Districts,  they  will  inevitably   impact   how   BIAs   operate,   especially   when   HCDs   are   created   within   commercial   areas  or  its  boundaries  are  created  so  they  overlap  multiple  BIAs,  such  as  the  case   with  Toronto's  exploration  of  creating  a  HCD  as  a  part  of  the  North  Downtown  Yonge   Street  Planning  Framework  (City  of  Toronto,  2012e).      Even   though   the   BIAs   interviewed   were   positive   with   regards   to   heritage  

management  and  stewardship,  their  opinions  seemed  to  diverge  in  terms  of  creating   a   HCD   ­   "there   is   a   huge   difference   between   designating   a   building   and   a   whole   neighbourhood"   (BIA   member,   personal   communication,   March   29,   2012).   Half   the   BIAs   had   some   concerns   about   HCDs,   while   the   other   half   only   spoke   to   the   benefits   of   the   creation   of   a   HCD   in   their   community   ­   "the   creation   of   a   HCD   creates   a   lot   of   questions"   (ibid.).   Moreover,   the   BIAs   focused   on   different   aspects   of   HCDs,   some   focusing  on  development  and  others  focusing  on  building  use.        The  Queen  St.  West  BIA  is  the  only  BIA  in  this  study  that  is  a  part  of  a  HCD,  and  

has   come   with   its   own   set   of   challenges.   One   BIA   member   said   "it   is   going   to   take   some  time  for  our  neighbourhood  to  grow  into  it"  and  that  the  benefits  will  be  more   evident   in   the   long   term   (personal   communication,   March   29,   2012).   Another   BIA   commented,   "There   is   a   fine   balance   between   protection   in   the   museum   sense   versus   responsible   development   and   redevelopment   opportunities.   It   would   be   a   65     

miss   to   say   that   we   would   not   allow  new  development  and  to   stop   and   only   work   with   what   we   have"   ­   alluding   that   the   designation  of  a  HCD  is  not  for   every   neighbourhood   and   that   perhaps  some  communities  can

welcomed  the  added  level  of  development   review   that   is   required   in   a   HCD,   seeing   this  as  a  way  that  any  sort  of  development   would   have   to   conform   to   the  

neighbourhood's   character.   The   BIAs   tended  to  react  favourably  with  respect  to   Figure   18   Newer   developments   within   the   development   being   more   sensitive   to   the  
Queen   St.   West   HCD   choose   building   materials   that   are   more   suited   to   the   neighbourhood,  such  as  brick.  

surrounding   community   and   including   natural   materials   (brick   and   stone)   and   urban-design   principles      (fine-gain   retail   rhythm)   that   pay   homage   to   the   historic   fabric  of  the  commercial  district.  However,  the  aspect  of  flexibility  become  evident   again  ­  "when  adding  a  new  layer  of  policy  [in  a  HCD]  it  is  important  to  maintain  a   degree   of   flexibility   and   creativity   to   ensure   that   the   guidelines   are   not   too   66     

prescriptive  and  eliminate  the  opportunity  to  attract  new  businesses"  (BIA  member,   personal  communication,  March  22,  2012).  Where  the  reality  is  that  businesses  need   this  aspect  of  flexibility  to  successfully  work  with  heritage  properties  and  changes  to   the  building  such  as  "adding  new  windows,  doors,  addressing  accessibility,  or  even   in  some  cases  moving  the  building  may  be  necessary  to  meet  these  needs"  (ibid.).      HCDs   were   viewed   by   some   BIAs   as   a   means   of   not   only   protecting   the  

architectural   merit   of   a   neighbourhood,   but   also   the   type   of   uses   these   buildings   host.  The  designation  of  an  HCD  was  seen  as  an  opportunity  to  protect  the  interest   of   local   property   owners   and   supporting   the   fine   grain   retail   feel   of   their   neighbourhood   ­   "HCDs   preserve   an   area   of   unique   economic   character   in   a   changing   retail   world"   (BIA   member,   personal   communication,   March   16,   2012).   BIAs   still   saw   their   community   in   direct   competition   with   malls,   power-centres,   and   other   modern   retail   formats.   Therefore   specialization   such   as   ethnic   group   or   business   types   in   a   HCD   provides   an   environment   that   cannot   be   replicated.      One   BIA   member   claimed,   "the   only   way   we   can   compete   is   to   provide   a   niche   and   heritage   is   a   well   understood   niche.   It   implies   cultural   importance"   (personal   communication,  March  16,  2012).  Some  BIAs  also  saw  a  HCD  as  a  way  to  deter  big- box   stores   from   locating   within   their   neighbourhood,   for   the   fear   that   these   companies   would   threaten   the   vibrancy   of   the   community   and   force   shops   out   of   business.  However,  it  was  also  mentioned  that  a  HCD  may  in  some  ways  prevent  the   conventional   form   of   big-box,   they   cannot   prevent   use   and   these   development   restrictions   may   actually   work   against   local   businesses   who   are   unable   to   find   a   suitable  space  to  expand  in  their  community  or  afford  the  increased  value  within  a   67     

HCD.      The   Queen   Street   West   BIA   shared   some   of   the   challenges   that   have   become  

evident  since  the  creation  of  their  HCD.  Although  this  BIA  was  not  directly  involved   in   the   creation   of   the   HCD   (which   was   designated   in   2007),   the   BIA   essentially   inherited   the   HCD   when   it   was   established   in   2009   (Ministry   of   Culture,   2012a;   Queen   St.   West   BIA,   n.d.).   One   of   the   greatest   challenges   is   the   lack   of   public   awareness.  The  severity  of  this  lack  of  awareness  is  as  extreme  as  property  owners   not   knowing   they   are   even   within   a   HCD,   let   alone   the   responsibilities   and   opportunities   that   come   with   being   a   part   of   one.   Despite   the   BIA's   best   efforts,   property   owners   still   tend   to   view   HCD   designations   as   limiting   their   ability   to   alter   their  property,  and  feel  that  the  designation  will  hurt  property  values.  Moreover,  a   HCD  can  create  extra  obstacles  for  a  non-contributing  property.  When  a  permit  for   alternation  is  submitted  to  City  Hall  the  extra  development  review  process  can  delay   a   property   owner   if   the   alterations   to   their   building   are   not   approved   by   Toronto   Preservation   Services.   Their   project   can   be   stuck   in   limbo   because   the   property   owner   was   unaware   of   the   restrictions   placed   upon   their   property.   Even   if   the   property  owner  was  sensitive  to  the  heritage  of  the  community,  these  sorts  of  delays   and  inefficiency  in  the  system  create  a  negative  image  for  heritage  conservation  and   act  as  a  deterrent  to  property  owners  who  may  resist  the  designation.  Therefore,  a   BIAs   role   in   educating,   facilitating   and   supporting   property   owners   is   extremely   important  when  it  comes  to  heritage  conservation  in  their  community.        Unfortunately,   BIAs   often   feel   they   are   unable   to   fully   celebrate   the   benefits   of  

a   HCD.   The   lack   of   municipal   support   becomes   even   more   evident   when   a   BIA   is   68     

within   a   HCD.   Although   there   is   an   understanding   that   HCDs   do   provide   benefits   for   the   community,   "the   city   is   not   providing   the   mechanisms   for   this   benefit,   expecting   BIAs   to   make   it   themselves.   If   there   was   a   mechanism   to   have   some   resources   to   do   that,  the  BIA  would  have  a  much  stronger  position  in  realizing  these  benefits"  (BIA   member,  personal  communication,  March  29,  2012).  Furthermore,  there  seems  to  be   a   disconnect   between   the   municipality   and   BIAs   in   terms   of   the   level   of   understanding   regarding   heritage   conservation   knowledge   of   the   BIAs   themselves  ­   "the  BIA  cannot  be  looked  at  as  the  heritage  expert,  it  is  guidance  we  need"  (ibid.).   RECOMMENDATIONS      The   findings   of   this   report   should   show   beyond   a   doubt   the   important   role     

heritage   conservation   plays   within   Toronto's   planning   process,   considering   the   many   benefits   heritage   properties   contribute   to   the   urban   landscape   and   our   communities.    Heritage  conservation  is  not  just  architectural  reminders  of  our  past   and  their  legacy  is  not  intended  to  be  immortalized  in  a  plaque.  Heritage  buildings   are   pieces   of   art,   providing   a   space   for   future   generations   to   re-imagine   as   they   become   integrate   part   of   the   sustainability   movement,   and   helping   us   to   secure   a   better   future.   The   following   three   recommendations   were   derived   from   the   research:     1)   BIAs   have   a   significant   role   to   play   in   heritage   conservation   management,   and  should  continue  being  advocates  for  heritage  within  their  communities.      BIAs   have   the   potential   to   play   multiple   roles   in   heritage   conservation.   They  

are   the   voice   of   the   business   community   and   able   to   articulate   the   needs   and  

69     

demands   of   property   owners.   BIAs   are   essentially   on   the   front   lines   in   terms   of   understanding  how  the  community  responds  to  its  heritage  assets.  Due  to  this  fact,   they   are   ideal   for   acting   as   advocates,   educators   and   facilitators   of   heritage   management  within  their  community.  They  can  provide  the  city  information  such  as   identification   of   heritage   resources,   possible   threats   to   heritage   structures,   enlighten   BIA   members   of   the   many   benefits   of   heritage   conservation   and   sustainability,   facilitate   grant   application   process,   and   provide   support   for   protecting  heritage  buildings  to  ensure  their  longevity.  BIAs  have  the  opportunity  to   become   an   arm-length   city   planning   committee   and   asset   for   Toronto   Heritage   Preservation   Services   and   help   strengthen   Toronto's   relationship   with   heritage   stewardship.  It  is  up  to  the  municipal  government  to  provide  the  tools  in  which  BIAs   can  strengthen  this  role.   2)  The  City  of  Toronto  needs  to  fill  in  the  gaps,  providing  adequate  resources   to   BIAs   so   that   they   can   take   on   a   stronger   role   when   it   comes   to   assisting   property  owners.        The   City   of   Toronto   has   a   real   opportunity   to   harness   the   energy   of   BIA  

enthusiasm   for   heritage   stewardship   and   use   it   to   their   advantage.   It   is   no   secret   that  Toronto  Preservation  Services  is  an  overburdened  department  within  City  Hall,   which   often   results   in   reactive   rather   than   proactive   heritage   management.   Therefore,   a   closer   alliance   with   BIAs   can   help   alleviate   some   of   the   burden,   especially   with   respect   to   heritage   awareness   and   understanding   of   heritage   regulations,  as  well  as  providing  support  to  property  owners.

Currently,   there   is   an   large   disconnect   between   Toronto's   BIAs   and   Toronto  

Preservation   Services,   and   efforts   should   be   made   to   try   and   tighten   this   gap   and   improve  rapport.  The  City  needs  to  take  on  more  of  a  consultant  and  expertise  role   to  BIAs.  BIAs  currently  feel  that  the  role  of  Toronto  Preservation  Services  has  been   limited   to   providing   heritage   financial   incentives   and   this   perception   needs   to   change.   Although   eager   to   do   more,   the   research   has   shown   that   BIAs   do   not   feel   they  are  able  to  adequately  equipped  to  be  a  heritage  expert.  Often  the  first  resource   for   property   owners   when   approached   about   heritage   issues   are   BIAs,   which   are   often   limited   with   their   assistance.   If   given   the   proper   resources   BIAs   can   answer   many  of  the  basic  heritage  questions  of  property  owners  and  assist  property  owners   until   it   is   necessary   for   Toronto   Preservation   to   intervene.   Together,   Toronto   Preservation   Services   and   BIAs   can   ensure   that   the   conversation   regarding   heritage   does   not   stop,   assisting   property   owners   to   every   avail   possible,   giving   property   owners   a   range   of   options   that   would   prevent   the   neglect   or   destruction   of   Toronto's  heritage  assets.        The   following   two   initiatives   should   be   considered   by   the   City   of   Toronto   to  

support  BIAs  efforts  to  become  stronger  heritage  stewards:   i)  Either  eliminating  or  shortening  the  5-year  period  before  BIAs  can  take  advantage   of   the   Commercial   Façade   Improvement   Program.   This   becomes   increasing   important   for   BIAs   within   HCD   because   it   hinders   the   ability   for   a   BIA   to   offer   financial   incentives   for   their   members   to   improve   their   buildings.   Although   there   are  heritage  incentives  available,  this  5-year  limit  inhibits  a  BIAs  ability  to  provide  a  

71     

wider   range   of   options   to   their   members.   The   availably   of   financial   incentives   are   crucial  for  a  BIA  to  gather  support  for  heritage  conservation  from  their  members.     ii)   There   is   a   need   to   provide   more   heritage   grants   and   incentives,   while   also   opening  up  the  number  of  eligible  properties  for  existing  grants.  The  city  has  been   increasing   the   number   of   HCDs   but   the   budget   allotted   for   funding   has   not   grown   in   the  same  manner,  which  in  turn  can  make  the  argument  for  the  importance  heritage   conservation  less  convincing  to  property  owners,  since  they  would  be  more  hesitant   to   take   on   the   perceived   extra   costs   of   heritage   conservation   without   adequate   incentives.     3)  Open  up  dialogue  with  the  private  sector.      BIAs  can  leverage  the  corporate  responsibility  desires  of  a  company  for  the  

benefit   of   the   local   community,   especially   when   these   interests   include   heritage   conservation   and   sustainability.   BIAs   should   create   synergy   with   tenants,   corporations,   and   developers   who   see   the   investment   value   in   the   community.   These   alliances   can   be   powerful   for   persuading   unwilling   or   reluctant   property   owners,   which   could   open   up   dialogue   about   heritage   conservation   and   how   to   integrate   more   sustainable   practices.   Harnessing   relationships   with   the   private   sector   can   also   benefit   the   BIA   with   regards   to   sharing   knowledge   and   expertise,   which  will  also  create  more  awareness  about  heritage  conservation  and  potentially   fill   any   voids   that   may   not   be   available   from   the   public   sector.   Finally,   private   investment   in   heritage   buildings   also   increases   the   likelihood   of   innovative   re-

72     

imagining   of   these   spaces,   creating   best   practices   that   can   potentially   produce   a   spin-off  point  for  spurring  other  heritage  conservation  projects.     CONCLUSION   As   expressed   by   Shipley,   Jonas   and   Kovacs   (2011),   the   Canadian   system   regarding  heritage  conservation  is  "the  least  advantageous  to  property  owners,"  and   still   trailing   behind   other   countries   with   it   comes   to   providing   programs   and   financial   incentives   that   encourage   the   maintenance   of   heritage   buildings   (p.616).   These   issues   coupled   with   limited   public   will,   lack   of   integration   in   the   planning   system  and  Toronto's  development  pressures  place  urgency  for  alternative  ways  to   encourage   heritage   conservation.   The   evolution   of   the   heritage   conservation   discourse   to   incorporate   sustainability   has   made   heritage   conservation   a   more   lucrative  venture  from  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  from  property  owners  to  multi- national  corporations.     This   momentum   has   the   potential   to   include   BIAs,   for   they   are   a   collective   voice   for   the   local   business   community   and   have   a   direct   stake   involved   when   it   comes  to  protecting  heritage  assets  in  their  community.  There  is  an  eagerness  from   BIAs  to  play  a  bigger  role  in  heritage  conservation  and  there  is  a  real  opportunity  for   them  to  act  as  advocates,  educators  and  facilitators  of  heritage  management  within   their   community.   As   Heritage   Conservation   Districts   become   a   more   popular   option   for   protecting   heritage,   BIAs   need   the   ability   to   be   able   to   take   full   advantage   of   this   designation,   continuing   to   promote   their   community   and   maintain   its   economic   vitality.  Without  adequate  programs  and  funding  for  BIAs  to  entice  their  members

to   see   heritage   conservation   as   a   valuable   asset   for   the   community   and   that   ensuring  the  longevity  of  these  structures  does  stimulate  the  economy.     The  City  of  Toronto  needs  to  open  communication  with  BIAs,  providing  the   tools   and   expertise   to   ensure   their   success   to   further   define   the   role   BIAs   should   take  on  with  respect  to  heritage  conservation.  BIAs  can  help  create  a  larger  heritage   conservation   knowledge   base   for   the   public,   ultimately   easing   the   burden   on   Toronto   Preservation   Services   and   allowing   for   more   vigilance   over   Toronto's   heritage   assets.   Toronto   needs   to   progress   beyond   the   minutiae   of   restrictive   heritage   incentives,   improving   policies   in   which   reevaluate   how   heritage   conservation   can   be   seen   as   a   viable   alterative   for   stimulating   local   economies   rather  than  an  obstacle  to  development.  The  reality  is  that  once  a  historic  building  is   demolished,   it   cannot   be   replaced,   and   it   is   forever   erased   from   the   Canadian   landscape.
