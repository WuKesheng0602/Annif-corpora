ABSTRACT
Development of Ductile Irons for High-Temperature Applications: Characterization in the As-Cast and Oxidized States © Carl Rudolph Cvetnic, 2004 Masters of Applied Science In the program of Mechanical Engineering Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2004

Ductile iron alloyed with molybdenum and different levels o f aluminum and silicon was cast to determine the proper combination o f elements to increase the temperature range o f operation. Four alloys containing 1.5wt.% molybdenum and different combinations o f aluminum and silicon (i.e., 3.5Si-2.0Al, 3.5Si-3.0Al, 4.5Si-2.0Al and 4.5Si-3.0Al) were cast at 1350, 1400 and 1450°C into step blocks. The effects of alloy chemistry, pouring

temperature and casting thickness in the as-cast and oxidized conditions were studied. Results from the as-cast condition show that graphite morphology (i.e., size, count and sphericity) improved with lower Si/Al ratios and intermediate pouring temperatures. Higher silicon and lower aluminum contents accompanied by intermediate pouring temperatures reduced the onset o f surface and sub-surface defects. Results from the oxidized condition show that maximum oxidation resistance was achieved in alloys containing higher aluminum and silicon contents. This also increased the critical a-ferrite to y-austenite phase

transformation temperature range.

Développement de fontes ductiles pour des applications à haute température: étude d'échantillons moulés oxydés et non oxydés © Car! Rudolph Cvetnic, 2004 Maîtrise en science appliquée Dans le programme du Génie mécanique Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2004

Une fonte ductile, alliée avec du molybdène et différentes quantités d'aluminium et de silicium a été fondue et mise en forme pour déterminer la composition chimique optimale permettant d'augmenter la température d'utilisation. Quatre alliages contenant 1,5% en masse de molybdène et différentes combinaisons de concentrations d'aluminium et de silicium (3,5Si-2,0Al; 3,5Si-3,0Al; 4,5Si-2,0Al; 4,5Si-3,0Al) ont été coulés dans un moule en forme d'escalier à 1350°C, 1400°C et 1450°C. Les effets de la composition chimique, de la température de coulée et de l'épaisseur de l'échantillon moulé ont été étudiés sur des échantillons oxydés et non oxydés. L 'analyse des échantillons non oxydés a montré que la morphologie des nodules de graphite (taille, nombre et sphéricité) est meilleure avec des ratios Si/Al faibles et des températures de coulée intermédiaires. Pour des températures de coulée intermédiaires, des concentrations de silicium élevées et d'aluminium faibles conduisent à une réduction des défauts à la surface et à l'intérieur de l'échantillon. Les résultats obtenus avec les échantillons oxydés montrent que la résistance à l'oxydation est maximale pour les alliages contenant de fortes concentrations en aluminium et en silicium. Ces conditions permettent également d'augmenter la température de changement de phase des a-ferrite en y-austénite.

Introduction
Developed in the late 1940's, ductile cast irons have evolved into an essential class o f engineering materials. Castability, ease of machining, in-service reliability, vibration

damping, high-strength and toughness are some characteristics that have made this material a popular option among many leading industries, including the automotive sector [1]. Ductile iron is a multi-constituent iron-carbon alloy with a carbon content ranging from 3 to 4.5 wt.%. Referred to as nodular or spheroidal graphite iron, ductile irons contain concentrations of graphite in the form of minute spheres within a predominantly ferritic matrix. During solidification, eutectic graphite separates from the molten iron. With the addition of certain reagents to the molten metal before it is cast, the graphite precipitates into nodules rather than lamellae. The spherical shape o f the graphite creates fewer

discontinuities and reduces stress concentrations within the alloy thereby producing a strong naturally occurring composite. The spheroidal geometry o f the graphite gives ductile irons an incredible combination of elongation, tensile strength and proof stress [1]. Magnesium bearing ferrosilicon tends to be the most common spheroidizing agent presently in use; however, additional spheroidizing agents such as unalloyed magnesium, nickel-based nodulizers and cerium are used to promote the nodularization o f graphite as well [1]. These nodularizing additives can also aid in restricting the deleterious effects of

elements such as antimony, lead, titanium, tellurium, bismuth and zirconium, which prevent the developing graphite from nodularizing. Mechanical properties o f ductile irons may be enhanced by additions o f boron, chromium, cerium, copper, molybdenum, nickel, niobium, phosphorus, vanadium and zirconium [2-7]. Furthermore, thermo-mechanieal properties of ductile irons can be

increased by controlled additions o f aluminum and silicon [8-18]. Many o f these elements have a significant influence on the precipitation o f ferrite, pearlite and carbides, which are material property determining phases.

Chapter 1 - Introduction
Ductile cast iron is generally used in applications where respectable thermomechanical properties are required at an economical cost. But, its use is slowly being phased out by newly emerging alloys yielding similar strength properties at a fraction o f the weight. In automobiles, for example, cylinder heads are being replaced by various aluminum alloycomposites and intake manifolds are being replaced with magnesium alloys. However, highoperating temperatures have prevented any new lightweight alloy from replacing the exhaust manifold or turbochargers. Exposed to extreme temperatures exceeding 700°C, the exhaust manifold would virtually melt aluminum and magnesium alloys. The only material that can withstand such extremely high temperatures at an economical cost is ductile cast iron. There is an ongoing quest in the automotive industry for possible methods o f reducing friel consumption. The approach to this problem by the industry has been two-fold. One is to reduce the overall weight o f the vehicle. An important component of this approach is to reduce the section thickness of castings. The second approach is to increase the engine operating temperature, thereby enhancing the efficiency. The latter approach also enables complete combustion o f fiiel; effectively reducing harmful emissions [19,20]. Increasing operating temperatures has a profound effect on current engine components cast from ductile iron, such as exhaust manifolds and turbochargers. Surface oxidation and spalling at high temperatures severely reduce the life o f current ductile cast iron components. As a result, a new family o f ductile irons has emerged. Alloyed with aluminum, molybdenum and silicon, these alloys were developed for the next generation exhaust manifold and turbochargers. Its resistance to high temperature oxidation and

enhanced thermo-mechanical fatigue resistance during thermal cycling have made this type o f iron an ideal candidate for high-temperature applications. However, choices in material composition, treatment additions and process conditions necessary to produce sound castings for elevated temperature regimes are not completely understood. In effect, these prevent mass production o f such cast irons. This research project demonstrates the correlation o f these variables through experimental study. The present research is focused on determining the precise concentration and combination o f alloying elements that w ill enable the next generation o f ductile cast irons to withstand surface and sub-surface oxidation and spallation at operating temperatures in excess o f 700°C. With this material requirement, principal as-cast defects such as slag.

Literature Review
Current studies are focused on extending the usefiilness o f ductile iron alloys into applications requiring thermal stability at high temperatures [15]. The literature to follow is a review o f ductile cast iron metallurgy relevant to high temperature applications. Metallurgical studies performed to understand the processing o f ductile iron and its alloys w ill be examined in this review with a view to extending these fundamentals into developing a ductile cast iron alloy for applications in excess of700°C.

2.1

METALLURGICAL CHARACTERISTICS of DUCTILE IRONS
The microstructure and properties of ductile cast iron depend extensively on

composition, rate o f solidification and molten metal processing [1,21-24]. More specifically, chemical composition is the primary driving force in shaping the final microstructure and obtaining the desired properties for any elevated temperature application. Alloying elements have a direct effect on the ability o f ductile cast irons to withstand high temperatures through graphite morphology and the relative amounts o f ferrite and pearlite [15,25]. Alloying

elements generally used to enhance the thermal properties o f ductile cast irons and negate the effects o f deleterious elements include carbon, aluminum, silicon, molybdenum, boron, chromium, nickel, copper and vanadium [7,22,26]. Elements used to influence graphite Other elements

morphology include magnesium, calcium, cerium and other rare earths.

introduced into ductile cast iron during processing may include hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen [27]. Controlled additions o f these elements into ductile cast iron can offer the best potential in meeting the following requirements for elevated temperature applications [ 1,6 , 8 10,12-16,22,25,28]:

2.1.1

Effect of CARBON and CARBON EQUIVALENT in Ductile Iron Processing
The carbon content in ductile cast iron can range anywhere from 3 to 4.5wt.%,

However, the carbon content in commercial grade ductile cast irons generally ranges from 3.5 to 3.9wt.% [22]. Under conditions o f slow cooling or near equilibrium conditions, phase transformations in unalloyed ductile cast iron can be explained using the Fe-C binary phase diagram illustrated in Figure 2.1. In BCC a-ferrite, maximum carbon solubility is about 0.02wt.% C, whereas the maximum carbon solubility limit in FCC y-austenite is approximately 0.65wt.% C [29]. This discrepancy in carbon solubility results from the shape and size o f the crystals themselves. Since the interstitial positions are much larger in a FCC crystal, it is much easier to accommodate carbon atoms. The temperature o f this

transformation is critical in improving the ability o f the cast iron to operate at elevated temperatures. By increasing the a ^ y critical transformation temperature, excess carbon in suspension w ill yield higher levels o f graphite, and this in turn w ill improve internal resistance to oxidation. Furthermore, this w ill ensure dimensional stability as the working temperature range o f the cast iron is increased. From the Fe-C phase diagram in Figure 2.1, the working range o f an unalloyed cast iron is approximately 738°C, which can be increased through the addition o f elements such as silicon and aluminum [25]. Carbon's primary influence on the microstructure in ductile cast iron is the nodule count and the formation o f ferrite and pearlite [30,31]. Higher concentrations o f carbon offer increased strength and resistance to thermal fatigue at the expense o f reduction in hardness, tensile strength and yield strength [ 1 ,3 ,2 2 ].

The fluidity of molten iron and mould flllability are influenced by carbon [1]. Fluidity of liquid iron is reduced when excess carbon is in suspension and not in solution. Further, fluidity is reduced when the carbon content exceeds 2.2wt.% [10]. Mould flllability is affected by the volumetric expansion of graphite during solidification [1,22]. eutectic solidification, carbon in solution transforms into graphite. During

expansion of the iron. As a consequence of this thermo-physical process, mould flllability enhances during solidification and defects such as shrinkage and porosity can be prevented. The amount of carbon necessary to cause this phenomenon can be approximated using the Henderson Diagram in Figure 2.2. To avoid excessive shrinkage, Henderson [32] established a lower threshold limit for carbon equivalent iCE)\

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
Silicon does not effectively substitute for carbon during graphite nucléation and growth; however, it is considered to be an effective graphitizing agent [1,3,30]. Therefore, it is the CE value that ultimately determines whether the cast iron alloy w ill contain a hypoeutectic, eutectic or hypereutectic structure, not the base carbon content.

2.1.2

Effect of SILICON in Ductile Iron Processing
The addition o f silicon to ductile cast iron increases its ability to operate in a high

temperature environment [1,22,25].

The addition of silicon to the Fe-C binary systems

destabilizes the cementite (FeaC) phase, promotes graphitization, increases nodule count, decreases carbide formation, promotes formation o f ferrite and raises the critical a-ferrite to y-austenite transformation temperature [1,3,8,25,31,33,34,35]. The addition o f silicon to cast iron will result in a ternary Fe-C-Si alloy, which w ill ultimately shift the eutectic and eutectoid points to lower carbon concentrations. This effect can be seen firom the equilibrium phase diagram in Figure 2.3 for a Fe-C binary alloy containing 2wt.% silicon. The Fe-C-Si ternary equilibrium phase diagrams in Figure 2.4 further illustrate the effect of increasing silicon concentrations on the eutectic and eutectoid carbon contents and temperatures at which they occur. The phases in Figure 2.4 include graphite, a-ferrite, y-austenite, Ci

(cementite, FeaC), Ci (iron silicon carbide), C3 (silicon carbide, SiC) and L (liquid). The silicon contents in alloyed ductile cast irons can range firom 1.8 to 2.8wt.%, with some compositional systems containing as much as 8 wt.% [22,25,35]. However, silicon

contents are generally limited to within 4wt.% providing a respectable equilibrium between high temperature oxidation resistance and embrittlement [ 1]. Silicon has an exceptional ability to increase ductile cast iron resistance to oxidation and spalling at high temperatures while maintaining dimensional stability. It forms a

compact adhering oxide scale that protects the cast iron fi'om further oxidation [25,34]. By increasing the silicon content, the oxide layer progressively transforms from iron oxide to iron silicate. This transformation provides a higher resistance to the transport of oxygen atoms into the metal fi'om the surface. Conversely, the diffusion o f metal atoms through the oxide layer into the atmosphere is progressively slowed down. Therefore, the rate of

oxidation can be gradually reduced by increasing the concentration of silicon [2,36].

influence of various silicon concentrations on the iron-carbon equilibrium

The Silicon Equivalent (SiE) (a correlation between the amount of silicon and aluminum) is often used to evaluate the resistance of a cast iron to oxidation by only one numerical quantity. The silicon equivalent is expressed through the following equation [17]:

SiE = Si + O.SAl

Equation 2.3

10

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
According to Reynauld and Roberge [17], a ductile cast iron possessing an SiE o f 6.0 or higher would not experience any oxidation. Silicon's ability to increase the critical a-^y transformation temperature enhances the useful operating temperature range for ductile cast iron. A linear relationship exists between the silicon concentration and the critical transformation temperature. This correlation can be approximated from the following expression [37]:

Critical Temperature = 730 + 28 x (%Si) C

Equation 2.4

The range o f temperature that promotes this phase transformation is o f considerable importance. First, it determines the carbon available for graphitization during solidification and second, it influences the dimensional stability o f the cast iron at high temperatures.

2.1.3

Effect of MOLYBDENUM in Ductile Iron Processing
Addition o f molybdenum enhances the resistance to oxidation and the mechanical

properties o f ductile cast irons at elevated temperatures; these include tensile strength, stress rupture and creep strength and resistance to thermo-mechanical fatigue [1,6,14,22,25,34]. Molybdenum can cause shrinkage problems [3]. It's also prone to segregating near the grain boundaries in the form o f stable carbides [1]. This element causes precipitation o f various carbidic phases including the Fe+Fe^MoyC and Fe+MyC-type [38]. Investigators have

stipulated that such phases can be responsible for giving ductile iron alloys dimensional stability at elevated temperatures [15]. Several carbidic phases including FezMoC, MzC, MôC and M 23C can co-exist within the cast iron alloy, which are identified by the Fe-Mo-C ternary phase equilibrium diagram illustrated in Figure 2.5. Some investigators [18] have observed that additions o f molybdenum above 0.3% lead to an increase in pearlite concentration. Increasing molybdenum w ill reduce the

formation o f free ferrite by initiating a volume fraction increase in pearlite through the formation o f free carbides [2]. However, recent studies have indicated that this could be misleading: The FcxMyCz type phases can be mistaken for pearlite [15]. As a result, careful analysis (e.g., via electron microscopy) is necessary.

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
Ductile cast irons have been alloyed with molybdenum contents ranging from 0.6wt.% to 2.5wt.% [25]. The most effective concentration range is from 0.5wt.% to lwt.%. In this range, molybdenum is most effective in improving creep and stress rupture strength [17]. Automobile turbochargers currently contain 0.6wt.% to 0.75wt.% of molybdenum

alloyed with 4 wt.% silicon, while cast irons alloyed with lwt.% molybdenum and 4wt.% silicon are typically used for exhaust manifolds [25].

Effect of ALUMINUM in Ductile Iron Processing
The effect of aluminum in ductile cast iron is two-fold. The addition of aluminum

enhances the degree of resistance to oxidation at high temperatures and it raises the critical a-ferrite to y-austenite critical transformation temperature [8,9,12,14,17,25,34]. Aluminum protects the cast iron from oxidation by producing a thin impervious film that prevents further diffusion of oxygen in iron. Since the critical a -- >y phase transformation temperature

72

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
is increased, the scaling tendency o f the aluminum oxide layer is decreased, thereby providing protection throughout the thermal cycling life o f the material. lwt.% o f aluminum can increase this critical temperature by 50-60°C [14,34]. Aluminum also affects the graphitization o f cast irons [34]. In cast irons containing up to 3 to 4wt.% aluminum, carbon in suspension develops as graphite [12]. As this Approximately

concentration o f aluminum is progressively increased, its effectiveness as a graphitizer diminishes. At
1 0 wt.%,

aluminum becomes a carbide stabilizer [12,39]. The existence of a

hard brittle ferro-magnetic phase called g-carbide (a complex iron-aluminum carbide) has been detected in cast irons containing 9 to 19wt.% aluminum [8,40,41,42]. However, the application o f such cast irons is limited due to the brittleness o f the material [8,43]. Cast irons containing 10 to 18wt.% A1 are referred to as white cast iron because o f their inability to form graphite. Graphite formation resumes in cast irons having aluminum concentration in excess of 18wt.% [9,12,25]. There are many drawbacks to the use o f aluminum. In molten ductile cast iron, aluminum is very reactive and exposure to ambient air and moisture will cause the formation o f dross and other microstructural defects [25]. Moreover, higher concentrations o f

aluminum make ductile irons more susceptible to gas porosity.

2.1.5

Effect of Combining Al, Si and Mo in Ductile Iron Processing
The operating temperature of ductile cast irons can be improved by alloying with Al,

Si or Mo. But, by combining these elements, optimal thermal performance can be achieved by counteracting damaging properties such as embrittlement, and enhancing favourable properties such as dimensional stability at high temperatures. I f ductile cast iron alloyed with excessive amounts of silicon (>4wt.%) is continuously heated and cooled, induced thermal stresses w ill cause cracking and ultimate failure due to thermal fatigue [14,34]. Moreover, excessive amounts of aluminum in Fe-C cast alloys w ill yield large microstructural defects, such as dross and porosity. In view of that, a ductile cast iron alloyed with controlled

amounts of Al, Mo and Si can be produced to effectively endure high temperatures and maintain dimensional stability.

13

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
Sponseller et al. [14] observed that a cast iron alloyed with 4wt.% silicon, 2wt.% molybdenum and 0.75wt.% aluminum produced an effective material for elevated temperature applications. This particular combination yielded a Fe-C alloy with a critical a-»Y phase transformation temperature o f 816°C. Furthermore, this material exhibited

exceptional resistance to oxidation, particularly when the aluminum content was increased from 0.55 to 0.90wt.%. Reynauld and Roberge [17] investigated high temperature ductile irons with higher amounts o f aluminum at operating temperatures in excess o f 900"C. Several elemental

combinations were proposed by Reynauld and Roberge [17]; 4.2-4.4wt.% Si, 1.5-1.7wt.% A l and 0.8-1.0wt.% Mo have been developed to operate at temperatures up to 900°C; 4.75 . 1wt.%

5.2-5.4wt.% Si, 1000°C.

2 .1-2.3wt.%

Investigators have also studied a ductile iron alloy containing 3wt.% silicon, 2wt.% molybdenum and 5.5wt.% aluminum [25]. This particular combination exhibited a low rate o f scaling and exceptional tensile properties at 925"C. Exposed to 925"C for 1000 hours, a thin oxide layer on the base iron alloy formed whose penetration depth was 0.008 mm. However, ductile cast irons alloyed with 2wt.% Si produced an oxide layer with a penetration depth o f approximately 0.15 mm. A lwt.% decrease in silicon considerably reduced the materials resistance to oxidation. This illustrated the importance o f maintaining a

predetermined level o f silicon at or above 3wt.%. Nofal et al. [8 ] also investigated a new family o f high temperature cast irons that contained 9wt.% aluminum and different concentrations o f silicon (i.e., 2, 3.5 and 5wt.%). The oxidation resistance at 9wt.% Al was observed to be exceptionally high at the surface. Furthermore, sub-surface oxidation decreased due to the increase in the critical a->y phase transformation temperature. However, it was observed that at lower silicon concentrations, the microstructure o f thin sections consisted primarily o f fine carbides and eutectoid products consisting o f ferrite and graphite flakes. But, with slower cooling, there was marked

coarsening o f the carbide phase (together with the eutectoid agglomerates). This resulted in increasing the volume o f ferrite by reducing the carbide phase. Further reduction in the carbide phase and a consequent increase o f the ferrite matrix was observed by alloying the

14

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
iron with lwt.% copper and inoculating with lwt.% CaSi. It was also noted by Nofal et al. [8 ] that the formation o f carbides was dependent on the silicon concentration. As a result, increasing the silicon content to 5wt.% eliminated both free and eutectoid carbides. Yaker et al. [9] investigated the high temperature characteristics o f ductile cast irons alloyed with different combinations o f silicon and aluminum. The combination o f

compositions proposed included; 2.1wt.% Si and 1.25wt.% Al; 2. lwt.% Si and 3.8wt.% Al; 1.6wt.% Si and 5.9wt.% Al. It was observed that the strength of ductile irons alloyed with aluminum increased at higher temperatures as the concentration o f aluminum increased, even at lower silicon concentrations. Moreover, the aluminum improved resistance to

decarburization. Alloy combinations with lower amounts of aluminum exhibited surface oxide layers that were thicker than 0 . 1mm after longer periods of time at 760°C or shorter periods o f time at 871 °C. Petitbon and Wallace [12], with similar aluminum concentrations, observed comparable results. Increased amounts o f aluminum produced a very thin, tight, adherent and protective oxide film at temperatures as high as 982°C in air. But, as the aluminum content decreased, the thickness o f the oxide scale increased, thus decreasing the adherence and protection provided by the film. Petitbon and Wallace [12] demonstrated that irons containing temperatures.

2.1.6

Individual Effects of B, Cu, Or, Nb, Ni and V on Ductile Iron Processing
Additions o f boron, copper, chromium, niobium, nickel and vanadium to ductile cast

irons have been made by investigators to enhance specific properties [1-3,7,17,22,44]. These elements can improve the strength, wear resistance, thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and resistance to corrosion at ambient and elevated temperatures. However, due to high costs associated with some elements, the moderate usefulness o f others and the direct application in consideration (i.e., exhaust manifolds and turbocharger housings), it is not practical to use these elements.

15

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
Boron is a carbide stabilizer and pearlite promoter [1,2,22]. Small amounts o f boron w ill promote the segregation o f boron carbides along grain boundaries while higher concentrations w ill effectively create an actual network-like structure [22]. Baligidad and Radhakrishna [7] observed that additions o f boron to a base Fe-Al-C alloy increased the room temperature ultimate tensile strength by 9MPa and decreased the yield strength by 20MPa. Similarly, elevated temperature ultimate tensile strength increased by 20MPa and the yield strength increased by 26MPa. Copper improves graphitization and promotes pearlite [1,3,22]. It destabilizes the ferrite phase and favours pearlite formation. Copper also impedes the annealing of pearlite. In cast ferritic irons, the amount o f copper is restricted to approximately 0.03wt.%. The solubility o f copper in cast iron is approximately 3wt.% to 3.5wt.% [2]. Copper, in the

presence of molybdenum, can effectively increase the hardenability of irons [22]. Copper has a tendency o f reducing the carbon content by about 0.075wt.% for every percent of copper. Alloyed with nickel, copper can suppress the formation o f carbides and increase graphitization. Moreover, nickel and copper do not promote pearlitic stability at However, copper w ill prevent the development o f ferrite

temperatures exceeding 450°C.

and will decrease the critical y-^a transformation temperature [ 1 ,2 ]. Chromium is a powerful carbide and pearlite stabilizer [1,3,22]. It neutralizes the effects o f elements such as molybdenum. To maintain a ferritic matrix, chromium levels must be kept below 0.04wt.%. However, a pearlitic matrix w ill be observed if chromium concentrations are increased to 0.1 Owt.%. Chromium w ill increase the carbon content of the iron-carbon eutectic by approximately 0.06wt.% for every lwt.% o f chromium added up to 9wt.%. Furthermore, when alloyed with elements such as silicon and aluminum, chromium w ill increase the cast iron's resistance to oxidation. In fact, for every lwt.% o f chromium that is added to iron, the critical a-^y transformation temperature will be raised by as much as 40°C [2,17]. Low concentrations of chromium are generally of limited value.

Concentrations o f chromium ranging from 15-3Owt.% are particularly suitable for temperatures up to 900"C and a range o f 24-35wt.% is suitable for even higher operating temperatures. Chromium is generally used in white cast irons to enhance abrasion resistance and stabilize the structure for high temperature applications [ 1].

16

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
Recent studies have shown that additions o f niobium to Fe-C-Al alloys, namely high carbon steels, could improve high temperature strength and creep resistance [7]. Similar

applications could include cast irons. Moderate increases in room temperature hardness and yield strengths have been reported as a result of Nb additions. Correspondingly, moderate increases in elevated temperature strengths have also been observed with the ultimate tensile strength being increased by 15MPa and the yield strength by 20MPa. Nickel increases the hardness and fraction o f pearlite in cast irons [1]. Nickel is typically added to ductile irons at levels ranging from 0.5-36wt.% [22]. Nickel is an

excellent graphitizing element. It fecilitates in reducing the solubility o f carbon in liquid iron and solid iron and it reduces the eutectic carbon content by approximately 0.06wt.% for every lwt.% o f nickel [2,22]. Nickel has a graphitizing ability that is one third that of silicon. Nickel has a tendency o f decreasing the critical a -- >y critical transformation In fact, the addition o f 1% nickel to iron can reduce this critical

temperature [37].

temperature by approximately 17°C. Applications o f cast irons alloyed with nickel include components in need of high wear resistance, corrosion resistance or high temperature resistance [ 1 ,2 ]. Vanadium is frequently added to steels to substantially improve strength properties o f tools and dies which are subject to severe forging processes. Vanadium forms very stable carbides and facilitates in promoting pearlitic structures [1,3,44]. However, vanadium has a superior resistance to creep. It can be alloyed in small amounts with cast irons to help increase the operating temperatures at an appreciable cost. Sage and Dawson [3] investigated the addition o f vanadium to gray cast irons and concluded that addition o f 0.5wt.% V to iron increased the tensile strength by 125MPa. Furthermore, they concluded that resistance to thermal fatigue was not reduced and that chills did not form even in sections as thin as 3 mm. But, this was attributed to the higher silicon contents. Sage and Dawson [3] also reported that vanadium can be used as a graphite refiner.

2.1.7

Spheroidizing Elements
There are many elements that have demonstrated the ability to spheroidize graphite.

Specific examples include Group lA elements (i.e., lithium, sodium and potassium). Group

17

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
IIA elements (i.e., beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium) and Group IIIB elements (yttrium and rare earths) [ 1,2 2 ]. Magnesium is a key constituent in the nodularization o f graphite in ductile irons. Magnesium concentrations o f approximately 0.02 to 0.08wt.% are needed to produce spheroidal graphite [22]. Irons that have low sulfur concentrations (<0.015wt.%) only need approximately 0.04wt.% Mg to nodularize graphite. The effectiveness o f magnesium as a nodularizer fades with time, primarily due to the oxidation o f magnesium. Magnesium can effectively deoxidize the base iron. As a result o f this deoxidation, magnesium oxide (MgO) w ill form. MgO is very stable, has a very high melting temperature, low density, and low solubility in iron. As a result o f its low density, when combined with other elements such as Si and Fe, MgO dross will settle near the top of the cope in the iron casting. The amount o f magnesium added to ductile cast iron is very important. I f it is too low the graphite w ill not undergo spheroidal transformation. On the other hand, if the

concentration of magnesium is too high, it w ill promote the formation o f brittle primary carbides [1,23]. However, the effect o f high magnesium concentrations can be suppressed by appropriately inoculating the cast iron [8 ]. This w ill increase the nodule counts which will counteract the formation o f carbides [45]. Takanezawa et al. [6 ] observed that magnesium was not only an effective nodularizer, but was also the root cause o f grain boundary fracture. Magnesium had a tendency o f

segregating at the grain boundaries, which resulted in the deterioration o f elongation for the ductile iron. It was further observed that additions o f phosphorus actually suppressed the segregation o f magnesium at the boundaries. However, it was concluded that a specific Mg/P ratio o f 1.5 should never be exceeded. Other effective nodularizing compounds include mischmetal, rare earth silicide, Mgbearing ferrosilicon (Mg-FeSi) and calcium silicide with copper [8,22]. The latter has been proven to be very effective [46]. Cerium and lanthanum are also very effective nodulizers

[ 1].
Calcium can be used in spheroidizing treatments. Calcium, like other spheroidizing elements, forms oxides (CaO) that generally float to the cope o f the casting. With levels above 0.03%, Ca w ill promote a carbidic structure when added with Mg. Below 0.03wt.%,

18

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
Ca helps to increase the nodule count. Calcium also helps to reduce the volatility of a Mg reaction [2 2 ]. Cerium is generally used as a supplement to magnesium to help increase nodule count and reduce the effects o f deleterious elements, including aluminum [22,45]. The oxides and sulfides produced by Ce in the reaction are very stable. Only about 0.035wt.% Ce is needed to produce spheroidal graphite. Ce w ill offset the negative effects o f Ti, Pb, Sb and As. But, large amounts o f Ce will result in graphite flotation, exploded graphite formation and chunky graphite in large sections of the casting. Lanthanum, combined with MgFeSi, is favoured primarily for its influence on promoting a fully ferritic matrix and developing a high nodule count [45]. Lanthanum has been linked to having an impact on spheroidizing graphite in ductile irons, but it has also been linked to promoting brittle carbides as well [ 1 ,2 2 ]. Many investigators have challenged the use o f other rare earths including neodymium, praseodymium and yttrium. It has been reported that neodymium and

praseodymium are very heavy carbide stabilizers. Yttrium on the other hand has proven beneficial in creating graphitic nodules but it has not been widely accepted due to excessive cost [2 2 ].

Matrix Phase Structures in the As-Cast Ductile Iron
Ferrite
The BCC a-ferrite iron is a solid solution with 0.022wt.% carbon (maximum) [29].

This phase is stable up to the eutectoid temperature of 738°C [47]. This can be observed firom the Fe-C phase equilibrium diagram illustrated in Figure 2.1. A detailed discussion on the ferrite structure is given by Voigt and Loper [2]. The bright white constituent in the micrograph (Figure 2.6) is ferrite. Ferritic ductile cast irons are favoured over pearlitic cast irons for high temperature applications. The

decomposition o f cementite (FesC) associated with pearlitic cast irons can cause excessive surface spalling at temperatures in excess o f 700°C, thereby reducing the life o f the component [15]. Addition o f Si to cast iron can promote, stabilize and harden this phase [25].

Figure 2.6: Optical micrograph of as-cast ferritic ductile iron alloy [current research]. 100X. Nital etched. 2 .1.8.2 Pearlite

The pearlite microstructure in ductile cast iron is composed of alternating layers o f airon and metastable cementite (FeaC) [47]. During the formation o f pearlite, diffusion of carbon atoms occurs over small lamel distances. The austenite-to-pearlite transformation takes place at temperatures lower than those for austenite-to-ferrite transformation [48]. Furthermore, pearlite formation increases with increased cooling rates [23,49]. A detailed

discussion on the pearlite structure and eutectoid transformation o f austenite is given by Voigt and Loper [29] and Lieteart [50]. The bright white rings surrounding the graphite in Figure 2 .7 (a) is ferrite and the dark compound surrounding the ring o f ferrite is pearlite. Since cementite is a metastable

compound, exposing the cast iron to high temperatures will cause pearlite to decompose into a-ferrite and graphite. The resulting microstructure is illustrated in Figure 2.7(b). When the cementite phase decomposes, the resulting expansion will cause the oxide layer to break at high temperatures. It has been observed that for every O.lvyt.% o f carbon combined as

cementite in pearlite, a volumetric increase o f 0.3% will occur [15]. To further support this occurrence, Gilbert [51] determined that after aging ductile cast iron for 64 weeks at 500°C, the material increased linearly by 0.5%. In summary, the onset of repetitive plastic strains

20

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
resulting from the decomposition of pearlite w ill lead to fatigue cracking of the oxide scale and ultimate failure of the component [52].

2.1.9

Formation of y-Austenite and Graphite in Ductile Cast iron during Solidification
During solidification of ductile cast iron through the eutectic (1150°C-- >1100°C), two

distinct solid phases develop: y-austenite and graphite [53].

The nucléation and growth

process of these two phases is the least understood phenomena in cast iron metallurgy [2 1 ]. Nucléation and growth of austenite is believed to occur through the formation of dendrites [53-57]. These dendrites consist of primary and secondary arms, which grow

perpendicular to the surface of the casting. A complex network of austenite dendrites is illustrated in Figure 2.8. The length and number of dendrites depends on the rate of

solidification. As the rate of solidification decreases the dendrites become shorter and less in number. This is illustrated in Figure 2.9. Further discussion and in depth analysis on

austenitic dendrites including exogeneous and endogeneous growth can be found elsewhere [58-63].

It is well accepted that austenite develops through the formation of dendrites during solidification; however, much ambiguity still exists in the theories developed to explain the

22

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
nucléation o f graphite. The more widely accepted theories include the Cementite Theory, Austenite Theory and Melt Theory, with the latter being most convincing. The Cementite Theory is one o f the earliest theories developed to explain the nucléation o f graphite. Morrogh [64] postulated that graphite nodules formed by the Furthermore, Dunphy and Fellini [65] suggested that the

decomposition o f FcaC developed in the vicinity o f dendrites immediately before the start of the eutectic reaction, thereby forming nodules in the neighbourhood o f existing dendrites. However, it was later determined that graphite formation only took place in the austenitie phase, not in cementite. Supported by De Sy [6 6 ] and Wittmoser [67], the Austenite Theory suggested that graphite precipitated within the austenitic dendrites, with further growth taking place by a peritectic transformation. Since they found that dendrites contained the same chemical

composition as the base metal, it was believed that duetile iron solidified without eutectic but in a mixed crystal system formed by supersaturated austenite. However, Falkenhagen and Hofinann [6 8 ] proved that this theory was not practical because supersaturated austenite never really existed. The longest surviving and most rigorously tested theory is the Melt Theory. Scheil and Hutter [69] postulated that graphite nodules formed within the eutectic melt away from existing austenitic dendrites. Nucléation and growth were believed to occur on a substrate within the melt and once a critieal size was reached they would be encapsulated by an austenitic shell. Further growth of graphite nodules would progress by diffusion of carbon from the melt through the austenite and to the existing nodules. Support for this theory was further provided by Loper and Heine [70,71,72] with similar conclusions made by Stefanescu [57], Oldfield and Humphreys [73] and Kempers [74]. However, in later studies, Oldfield [75] and Sato et al. [76] observed that no trace o f an austenite shell surrounding graphite nodules existed and concluded that graphite nodules formed in direct contact with the molten iron. Patterson [77] also suggested a modified version of Seheil's and Hutter's [69]

hypothesis. Patterson [77] proposed that the graphite nodule formed directly from the melt in the interstitial positions o f the austenitic dendrite arms where the melt was supersaturated. A detailed discussion on the support for the Melt Theory is given by Van de Velde [78].

Literature Review

Though theories on graphite nucléation are still open to debate, researchers have found some common ground on the substrate responsible for the heterogeneous nucléation o f graphite nodules in the melt. Heterogeneous nucléation o f graphite during solidification begins with the formation o f complex sulfides, which serve as nuclei for complex oxides. The end product serves as nuclei for spheroidal graphite [79]. De Sy [80] hypothesized that the decomposition o f a complex magnesium silicon-carbide can act as a substrate for nucléation. Bakkerus and Rosenstiel [81] have discovered inclusions within graphite,

thereby postulating the possibility o f inclusions acting as nucléation sites. Itofiiji et al. [82] found inclusions o f the type Mg-Ca-S-SiO at the centre of the graphite nodules. Lalich and Hitchings [83] have also observed and concluded that inclusions could be a possible source for nucléation. They also suggested that complex silicates, sulfides and rare earth metals are potential substrates for nucléation.

2.1.10

Structure of Graphite

The crystal structure o f graphite is HCP. Bound by low index planes, the normally observed bounding planes in a graphite crystal that has formed fi"om the iron-carbon melt are (0001) and (1010). This is illustrated in Figure 2.10. Possible growth directions for

crystalline graphite are labelled as A and C in Figure 2.10. Graphite that precipitates out of the iron-carbon melt has a layer-like type o f structure with very strong covalent bonds (i.e., 4.19x10^ to 5x10^ J/mol) between atoms in the same layer. However, weak molecular forces subsist between each layer o f the graphite structure. Moreover, every atom also contains

three electron bonds with each o f its neighbouring atoms on the same plane. The remaining fourth electron is common to the layer, thus giving it the metallic properties o f graphite. Strength and hardness are generally higher in the C-direction, as depicted in Figure 2.10 [79]. Graphite precipitates from carbon. Depending on the chemical composition o f the cast iron, a variety o f graphite shapes can emerge. Figure 2 .11 illustrates some o f the various graphite geometries that may develop during solidification.

Cast iron components designed for high temperature applications (i.e., exhaust manifolds and turbochargers) must contain spheroidal graphite. This ensures that stresses induced during thermal cycling are distributed within the iron matrix along the nodules (not concentrated at a single point), so as to eliminate the onset of fatigue failure due to microcracking. Two factors must be considered when analyzing the shape of a graphite nodule; sphericity (5) and compactness (C) [85]:

Graphite Nodule Count

Once graphite nucléation is initiated, the development of a sufficient number of graphite nodules becomes the most significant aspect o f the solidification process [24]. The graphite nodule distribution w ill affect the final properties o f ductile cast iron. Factors that dictate the number o f nodules that w ill form are carbon equivalent, section size and type of spheroidizing treatment used [21,23,24,45]. The distribution o f graphite nodules is most conveniently expressed as the number of nodules per unit area, NA. High carbon equivalents (i.e., > 4.65) will lead to low nodule counts. Similarly, the number of nodules per unit area will decrease with increasing section thicknesses. spheroidizing agent) will increase the NA. The addition o f magnesium (a

shrinkage. Furthermore, if the NA value is low enough, primary carbides w ill form. It has also been shown that if graphite nodules are fine and uniformly distributed, a larger fraction o f ferrite will be retained within the matrix. Conversely, if the graphite nodules are large and broadly spaced, pearlite and carbides will grow between the nodules. High nodule counts can also suppress the growth o f dendrites, thereby reducing the possibility o f interdendritic defects. To have a ductile cast iron o f varying thickness that w ill maintain a reasonable level o f strength at room and elevated temperatures, it is vital to establish a critical threshold limit for A4.

defects

Ductile cast iron alloys are ideal for elevated temperature use with respectable mechanical properties to compliment them. But, due to the high alloying concentrations and subsequent deleterious effects o f some elements, this family o f ductile irons is difficult to cast, resulting in many surface and subsurface defects. To help eliminate and prevent such defects from occurring, process parameters such as melt chemistry, melt temperatures, pouring, gating and moulding must be examined. Defects of primary concern include

graphite floatation, dross and slag, pinhole porosity and shrinkage.

2.2.1 Graphite Floatation
The density o f graphite is significantly less than that o f iron. As a result, when iron is in its molten state, the precipitating graphite w ill float to the cope o f the casting during solidification [24,86]. An example o f graphite segregation at the cope surface is shown in Figure 2.13. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength are significantly reduced in cast irons containing localized regions o f high carbon concentrations.

Factors responsible for graphite floatation include the carbon equivalent (CE), section size and solidification rate [1,21,23,24,86]. I f the carbon equivalent exceeds 4.5%, nodules w ill become sufficiently large, and thus subjected to significant buoyant forces. This will

result in graphite nodules segregating near the upper portion o f a casting. Graphite floatation effects are generally restricted to thicker cast sections that take longer to solidify. It is vital to control the chemistry o f the base melt before spheroidizing and inoculation treatments are added. To minimize the risk o f graphite floatation. Equations 2.1 and 2.2 must be used to control the carbon and silicon contents. A similar relationship was developed by investigators involving the liquidas arrest temperature [8 6 ]. The carbon

equivalent liquidas (CEL) relationship accounted for the effect of carbon, silicon and phosphorus (if present) upon the liquidas arrest temperature to prevent floatation [30,86]:

It is critical that the CEL value is not exceeded for a particular section size. Maximum CEL values for specific section sizes and pouring temperatures are given in Table 2.1.

2.2.2 Dross and Slag
Dross and slag defects typically develop in grey, malleable and ductile cast irons during molten metal processing [86-91]. The predominant constituents of slag and dross are various oxides. Sources that promote the formation of these oxides include furnace

refractories, fuel ash, ladle linings, oxidation during melting and oxidation or re-oxidation during pouring [8 8 ]. Much of the slag and dross is produced during the nodularization and subsequent inoculation of the cast iron. Slag and dross contain oxides of iron (FeO) in addition to SiOz, MnO (if manganese is present), MgO, Mg 2SiÛ4 (fosterite), 2FeO SiOi (fayalite), MgO SiO: (enstatite), A I2O3, FeO, CaO and Ce oxides [21,90,91]. I f the carbon equivalent is high enough, certain slag films (that melt at high temperatures) can accompany the graphite nodules during floatation [21,92]. Once the casting has solidified, these types of slag films can be easily removed by grinding the cast surface. Conversely, lower melting slags can cause severe surface damage resulting in cavities. These slags change into dross, which is fluffy and occurs as chunks on the surface and sub-surface o f a casting. Figure 2.14 illustrates typical slag and dross defects.

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
According to the Ellingham Diagram [93] (discussed in section 2.3.1), when liquid iron is above 1550°C, carbon monoxide gas (CO) is more stable than silicon dioxide (SiOz). Consequently, carbon is preferentially oxidized and is lost at a higher rate than silicon. Silicon only begins to oxidize when a sufficient amount o f carbon is used up. As a result, the liquid iron surface w ill remain film free, and any traces o f SiOa w ill dissociate into free silicon (Equation 2.16) and dissolve into the melt forming CO [94]. The CO eventually escapes into the atmosphere. When the temperature o f the melt falls below 1550°C, the relative stabilities o f carbon monoxide and silicon dioxide are reversed. As temperatures reach 1400°C, a crusty film (slag) begins to form on the surface o f the melt. With falling temperatures, the slag becomes a mixture o f a solid phase (SiOz) and a liquid phase (FeO), which eventually approaches the fayalite composition (2FeO SiOz). Other constituents of the slag may include A I2O3 and CaO. A detailed discussion on slag formation is given by Heine

[21].

2.2.3 Pinhole Porosity
Pinhole porosity is frequently observed in ductile cast irons. Variables that have a strong influence on this defect include metal chemistry, solidification rates, mould additions and gating design [95]. Pinhole porosity may arise through decreased solubility o f dissolved gases in the solidifying melt, entrapment o f gases in cores and moulds under pressure and the reaction o f carbon with oxygen in the liquid metal [96]. In general, these defects are

produced from gaseous by-products such as magnesium vapour, hydrogen, nitrogen or carbon monoxide.

2.2.3.1

Effect of Magnesium on the Formation of Pinhole Porosity
Pinholes develop when magnesium concentrations are high (~0.061wt.%) and

pouring temperatures are low (<1345°C) [2,86,90].

Kaczmarek et al. [90] showed that

pinholes in cast irons can be minimized by keeping magnesium levels low (approximately 0.035wt.%) and pouring temperatures high (approximately 1429°C). The area surrounding magnesium induced pinholes consists primarily o f pearlite with minute traces o f carbide [8 6 ].

32

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
Higher pouring temperature and alloying the magnesium with rare earth metals, sueh as cerium and lanthanum, can significantly reduce this type o f defect. These increase the

fluidity o f the molten iron, thereby allowing the gases to escape more quickly. Molten metal containing magnesium concentration up to O.lwt.% has a tendency to absorb hydrogen from the walls o f green sand moulds [95]. The presence o f a strong

deoxidizer such as magnesium w ill increase hydrogen availability by reacting with water vapour or steam produced during pouring [97]:

Mg + H^O -) MgO + 2H

Equation 2.19

It has been observed that melts containing magnesium concentration above 0.1% continue to absorb hydrogen (Equation 2.19); however, pinhole formation at this magnesium concentration is suppressed. Dawson et al. [96] suggested the possibility o f a diffusion barrier o f magnesium oxide, but this did not account for the excess hydrogen. Naik and Wallace [95] suggested that the composition of the nodularizing compound may affect the reduction in hydrogen pickup at higher Mg concentrations. Some suggest the use of a N i-M g alloy for the nodularization of cast iron to reduce the susceptibility o f hydrogen pickup by magnesium [98].

2.2.3.2

Effect of Hydrogen on the Formation of Pinhole Porosity

Pinhole porosity resulting from hydrogen is a common defect in cast irons [95,96]. The hydrogen content in cast iron typically varies between 0.00005% and 0.00025% [99]. However, this range is far exceeded when hydrogen is absorbed into the melt from the surrounding casting environment. Hydrogen absorption by liquid iron is associated with the dissociation of water vapour from the atmosphere or mould [90,96,100]. reactions may include [95,97,101,102,]: Some o f the

The degree o f H 2O dissociation and the solubility o f hydrogen increase with an increase in the temperature o f the melt [9 7 ]. Hydrogen pinholes are often spherical in shape and occur just below the surface o f the casting [95]. The outer ring o f these pinholes is often surrounded by a ferrite

microstructure with minute quantities o f flake graphite coating the inner surface o f the pinhole [95,96].

2.2.5.3

Effect of Nitrogen on the Formation of Pinhole Porosity

Nitrogen gas is inert and generally remains in solution [97]. Nitrogen concentrations in cast iron typical range fi-om 0.0015% to 0 .0 1 % [99]. Nitrogen contents in excess o f this range w ill cause holes to form [96]. This defect becomes more pronounced in thicker

sections due to the low rate o f diffusion o f nitrogen through iron, thus drawing the distinction between nitrogen and hydrogen (having a high rate of diffusion through iron) induced defects. Liquid iron nitrogen contents can increase through the absorption and dissociation o f ammonia fi-om nitrogen-rich resin-bonded moulds [95]. The decomposition product of the binder is ammonia (NH 3) and the reaction to produce N and H follows through as [95,103]:

2.2.5.4

Effect of Aluminum on the Formation of Pinhole Porosity

Aluminum contributes to the formation of pinholes by producing fiee hydrogen [96,97]. Aluminum produces hydrogen by reducing the water vapour created during pouring o f the metal (Equation 2.9). It has been shown that pinhole formation subsides when

aluminum levels are below O.Olwt.% [104]. It was also shown that aluminum concentrations above 0 .2 wt.% eliminated much o f the pinholes in ductile irons [105]. Carter et al. [106] further supported this finding when they concluded that pinholes did not exist at aluminum

34

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
concentrations o f 0.33wt.%. The severity o f pinhole formation is known to increase when aluminum is in the range 0.045 to 0.060wt.% [86].

2.2 3.5

Effect of Carbon on Formation of Pinhole Porosity
During processing,

Carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon monoxide (CO).

entrapment of this gaseous compound w ill create pmholes [96]. Some investigators have suggested that CO is the primary pinhole producer, ahead o f hydrogen [107,108]. When alloying additions were made to reduce the oxidation of carbon, it was observed that the castings produced were free o f pinholes, even though the hydrogen concentration was high [95]. The literature suggests melts with high carbon readily react with the slag (Equation 2.17) to produce CO. I f this gas becomes entrapped in the solidifying melt, pinholes w ill nucleate [86,90,96].

2.2.4 Shrinkage Defects
Metal and mould conditions influence the onset of shrinkage in cast irons [109-111]. Contributing metal variables include carbon equivalent, inoculation, nodule count and pouring temperature. The contributing mould variables are geometry and stability. It was shown by Henderson [32] that if the CE (Equation 2.1) was below 3.9, shrinkage would subsist. Wallace et al. [109] and Li et al. [110] reconfirmed this from their experiments. However, Wallace et al. [109] observed that a large casting (approximately 11.5mm in diameter) with high CE values (4.2 to 4.4) experienced a considerable amount o f shrinkage, especially in a green sand mould. This occurrence was related to the high CE in iron and the consequent inability to overcome the effect of mould expansion, particularly in large sections. As a result, Wallace et al. [109] concluded that the shrinkage difference experienced from variations in mould dilation was much more significant than variations attributed to CE. Wallace et al. [109] also reported that the pouring temperature had some effect on the shrinkage behaviour of cast irons. It was suggested that higher pouring temperatures could increase the occurrence o f liquid contraction, which may contribute to shrinkage. But, this effect is generally compensated by risers. Pouring temperatures also affect the stability o f

35

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
the mould. The thermal expansion of the mould can increase at higher temperatures, thereby increasing the probability of developing shrinkage. Inoculation of cast iron has a significant impact on shrinkage as well. Wallace et al. [109] showed that higher inoculation resulted in the formation of shrinkage. A well

inoculated melt increases the nodule count. When the nodule count is too high, resistance to metal flow dilates the mould cavity, thereby increasing the susceptibility to shrinkage. Castings with nodule counts exceeding 200 nodules per square millimetre showed a higher susceptibility to shrinkage than irons containing fewer nodules. When shrinkage defects are analyzed, they are divided into two categories: microshrinkage and macroshrinkage. Microshrinkage (Figure 2.15(a)) occurs in the late

stages of solidification [111]. Thickness of the mushy molten iron alloy restricts metal flow to the interdendritic regions. Microshrinkage typically develops between the eutectic cells. Macroshrinkage (Figure 2.15(b)) forms during the initial stages of eutectic solidification when feeding of the molten metal stops [111].

OXIDATION CHARACTERISTICS of DUCTILE IRON ALLOYS Thermodynamics of Metal-Oxide Stability
Metal-oxide stability can be quantitatively determined from Ellingham's [93] plot,

illustrated in Figure 2.16. This diagram illustrates the standard free energy o f formation (AG °) [J] of metal oxides per mole of O2 as a function o f temperature. The variation o f AG ° with temperature can be expressed as [112]:

AG" = A //" - TAS"

Equation 2.24

where AH° is the temperature-independent standard enthalpy change for the reaction [J] and AiS^is the negative o f the temperature-independent standard entropy change for the reaction [J/K]. On the Ellingham diagram, the length o f the intercept parallel with the temperature axis represents the enthalpy o f the system. The entropy term is represented by the slope of the reaction line. The stability o f oxides can also be expressed in terms o f oxygen pressure ) of the

gas phase with which the metal and its lowest oxide coexist in equilibrium. The partial pressure of oxygen is related to the free energy of formation through the following relation

[112]:
AG" = RT In po^ Equation 2.25

where AG°is the standard free energy o f formation [J], R is the universal gas constant [8.314 J/mol-K], T is the temperature [K] and pg^ is the oxygen gas at 1 atmosphere pressure. When a metal (Mg, Fe, A1 or Si) reacts with a gas (O2) to form an oxide (MgO, FeO, AI2O3, Si02) the disappearance o f the gas phase will cause the entropy o f the system to decrease. I f AS"' becomes negative, then AG° w ill be less negative with increasing

temperature.

This w ill result in a positive slope o f the free energy curve (i.e., CaO, MgO, FeO, Fe^Os, Fes0 4 , AI2O3, SiOz, MnO, etc.).

As zlG "becomes more negative, the stability o f an oxide increases. A detailed discussion on the Ellingham diagram is given by Gaskell [ 1 1 2 ].

2.3.2

Oxidation Kinetics of As-Cast Ductile Iron Alloys
The oxidation behaviour of cast iron in air or oxygen has been studied by many

investigators [13,14,28,113-115]. High-temperature oxidation o f iron is considered to be a special phase o f metallic corrosion [113]. Corrosion o f metallic materials can occur in either aqueous solutions or gaseous atmospheres during low or high temperature regimes. When cast iron is exposed to an oxygen rich atmosphere at temperatures in excess of 700°C, a thin oxide layer develops on the surface that gradually increases in thickness with increasing temperatures [116]. During the initial stages, oxidation o f cast iron proceeds

intensely at the eutectic cells and graphite which are protruding along the surface of the specimen [13]. Once the oxide layer matures, further oxidation is restricted [13]. The oxide scale formed on cast iron is composed o f FeO (wiistite), Fes0 4 (magnetite) and FezOa (haematite) [113]. The oxide content o f this scale changes with the addition o f alloying elements (i.e., Al, Si, Mg, etc.). Formation o f the oxide layer occurs by the diffusion o f metal ions away

39

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
from the metal-scale interface while oxygen ions simultaneously diffuse towards this interface [117]. This electro-chemical process is represented schematically in Figure 2.17.

where M^^are the metal ions, 0^` are the oxygen ions and 2e' are the electrons. When cast iron is alloyed with silicon and aluminum, the internal scale or sub-scale layer w ill contain multiple oxide systems that can combine with FeO to form FezSi0 4 (fayalite) and FeAlz0 4 . It is not uncommon for internal double phase scales such as

Fe0 +Fe2Si0 4 and Fe0 +FeAl2 0 4 to form [118]. These oxide systems give high-temperature resistance to cast irons alloyed with silicon and aluminum. They produce a compact nonpermeable scale that reduces the amount oxygen ions diffusing through to the interior, consequently hindering further oxidation o f the iron [13]. During the initial stages of oxidation, intense decarburization o f cast iron occurs. Measurable carbon loss typically occurs at temperatures in excess o f 800°C [119,120].

40

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
During oxidation, carbon reacts with the scale according to Equation 2.17 [119,120]. CO may react further with FeO to produce CO2 [119,120]:

CO + FeO -> Fe + COj

Equation 2.28

These reactions can only proceed when CO and CO2 are allowed to escape through the oxide layer. I f release o f the CO gas is prohibited, the oxide scale can rupture. Once the protective scale is ruptured, the kinetics of oxidation can be reactivated [120].

2.3.2.1

Diffusion in Metals and Oxides
Diffusion is the transport of material by atomic motion. The net flux of species

(atoms, ions, electrons and molecules) depends on the initial concentration gradient and temperature. The ability o f migrating species to diffuse through matter increases as the temperature or thermal energy o f the species increases. Stepwise migration o f atoms or ions can occur either by moving to a nearby vacancy within the crystal lattice or by moving from one interstitial lattice site to another [47,116,121]. The latter diffusion mechanism applies to atoms small enough (e.g., hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) to fit into the interstitial positions of the host lattice (e.g., iron). The magnitude of the self-diffusion coefficient is related to temperature through the Arrhenius relation [122]:

where D is the self-diffiision coefficient [m^/s], D,, is a frequency factor [mVs], Q is the activation energy [J/mol], R is the universal gas constant [8.314 J/mol-K] and T is the absolute temperature [K].

Q is the activation energy required to overcome the energy

accessary to move the atoms or ions from one position to another. It can also be used to relate the migration and formation energy of the defect in the case of a vacancy mechanism [116].

41

Chapter 2 -- Literature Review
The difhision o f atoms may occur either by steady-state or non-steady state. In

steady-state diffiision, the difiusion flux is proportional to the concentration gradient. This is expressed using Pick's first law [116]:

J=

ax

Equation 2.30

where J is the diffusion flux [kg/m^-s], D is the self-diffiision coefficient [mVs], dC is the change in the concentration gradient [kg/m^] and dx is the change in distance. In most cases the initial magnitude o f the flux is high and decreases with time. For transient diffusion to progress, the difiusion flux and the concentration gradient at some particular point within the solid must vary with time. This phenomenon is expressed using Pick's second law [116]:

When iron is exposed to very high temperatures, a complex multi-layered oxide film composed of wüstite (FeO), magnetite (Fe3 0 4 ) and haematite (FeiOs) develops. The ironoxygen phase diagram in Figure 2.19 illustrates the regions in which particular iron oxides develop. The initial oxide film protects the metallic surface from further contact with

oxygen. I f the volume of the initial film is less then the metal it replaces, a cellular scale will form; if the opposite occurs, a homogeneous oxide layer w ill form. A volumetric ratio

relating the volume of oxidizing metal to the volume of oxides forming was developed by Filling and Bedworth [113]:

When iron is exposed to temperatures ranging from 700 to 1250°C, a parabolic relationship exists between the weight gain of the oxide scale per unit area and time [120]. The isothermal parabolic oxidation kinetics of iron during steady-state migration of reactants can be described using Tammann's [124] relationship:

Equation 2.36

where y denotes the total scale thickness, t is the oxidation time and 2p is the parabolic rate constant measured in cm^sec'*. The parabolic rate constant is exponentially dependent on temperature and can be expressed as [120]:

kj. = k expf- ^ 1

Equation 2.37

where kr=2p [m^/s], h is a constant [mVs], Q is the activation energy [J/mol], T is temperature [K] and R is the universal gas constant [8.314 J/mol-K]. Wagner [125]

demonstrated that the activation energy required to oxidize iron was equivalent to the activation energy required for iron diffusion in FeO (wiistite) [125]. Furthermore, the

diffusion coefficient o f iron in wiistite is much larger than in magnetite and the diffusion of oxygen and iron through the haematite layer is very small (Figure 2.18 and Equation 2.33). This constitutes the relative thickness of each layer. Following Tammann's approach,

Païdassi [115] showed that for the parabolic temperature range, the relative thickness ratio of FczOs, Fc3 04 and FeO layers versus the total thickness o f the oxide layer was constant at 1:4:95, respectively. The rate constant was also determined as:

=6.1 exp^--

Later, Pilling and Bedworth [113] developed a parabolic relationship based on the diffusion path for a given concentration difference of migrating species. They postulated that the rate of diffiision was inversely proportional to the length o f the diffusion path. Based on the understanding that the oxygen that diffiises through the oxide layer is used to increase the volume o f the oxide layer. Pilling and Bedworth [113] proposed the following relationship:

Theories advanced by Wagner have been proposed to account for the parabolic growth o f scales based on ambipolar diffusion (charge migration under local

Experimental Procedure
3.1 EXPERIMENTAL PLAN
Ductile cast iron alloyed with 1.5wt.% molybdenum and different combinations o f silicon and aluminum was cast at three different pouring temperatures (i.e., 1350, 1400 and 1450°C). This is schematically represented in Figure 3.1. The criteria used for evaluating these experimental ductile iron alloys were microstructure, oxidation resistance and transformation temperatures. In the as-cast condition, the effects o f pouring temperature, chemical composition and section thickness on the microstructure of these castings were studied (Figure 3.2). At 700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100°C for 500 hours, the oxidation

characteristics o f these castings were studied through weight change, oxidation rate and x-ray mapping o f the oxide scale (Figure 3.3).

MOULD MEDIUM and GEOMETRY
The iron specimens were cast into a stepped green sand mould with section

thicknesses of 4, 7, 14, 22 and 34mm.

The stepped mould was developed by Wescast

Industries Inc. and is illustrated in Figure 3.4(a). The final cast product is shown in Figure 3.4(b). Detailed dimensioning of the mould is given in Appendix A. To include a repeat casting under identical conditions, two stepped moulds were simultaneously cast using one sprue and a common runner bar. Once the green sand was prepared for moulding, the H 2O content and compression strength were tested. Using an electronic MB40 Moisture Content Analyzer {MCA), the

green sand was subjected to an enclosed atmosphere temperature of 110°C. The released H 2O vapours were analyzed and measured. The moisture content ranged from approximately 2.99% to 3.54%. The green sand strength was analyzed using the 490A Sand Strength Machine (SSM). A 165g sample was compacted into a cylinder 50mm in diameter and 50mm in length. The compacted cylindrical sample was subjected to a compression test. The compressive strength of the green sand used for moulding was in the range of 150.3 IkPa to 153.07kPa.

MELTING and CASTING
Four heats o f the new ductile cast iron alloys were produced using an induction

furnace.

The procedure consisted o f producing cast samples at three different pouring The aim

temperatures (i.e., 1350, 1400 and 1450°C) and four different chemistries.

chemistry for each alloy is tabulated in Table 3.1. A CE value of 4.6 was maintained for each alloy.

The induction furnace was charged with pig iron, SiMo ductile cast iron returns, 1010 steel scrap, ferromolybdenum, ferrosilicon and graphite. The charge was melted and further heated to reach a bath temperature of approximately 1550°C. At this temperature, the

furnace was tapped and the molten iron was transferred into the pre-heated ladle. A ladle treatment with Re-Mag® (nodularizing compound containing magnesium, cerium and other rare earths) was made. After tapping, the ladle temperature was monitored until the

designated pouring temperatures of 1450, 1400 and 1350°C were reached. The metal was then poured into the basin of each mould. Monitoring the time from tap out, to, until the last mould was poured, t/, monitored magnesium fade. The target time to fill all three moulds was approximately 8 minutes. The basin contained additional charge materials including aluminum, cerium and Ultraseed® (75% Si, 1.75% Ce, 1% Al, 1% Ca with the rest being Fe coated with S to increase inoculation potential). The detailed charge make up is in Tables 3.2-3.5.

50

Chapter 3 -- Experimental Procedure
When the molten metal was poured into the basin a ceramic stopper closed the exit to the downsprue until the basin was filled. Once the basin was full, the melt was allowed to settle for approximately three seconds. This allowed the molten bath from the ladle to

dissolve additional elements added to the basin, thus ensuring the necessary chemistry to produce cast iron samples for a given heat.

Prior to pouring the molten bath into the basin, a sample o f the melt was taken and analyzed using an emission spectrometer. The sample was cast into a disk, 40mm in

HIGH-TEMPERATURE OXIDATION TESTING
With a view to understanding the effects of chemical composition, pouring

temperature and section thickness on the oxidation properties of iron; specimens were heated in an ambient air heat treatment furnace to 700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100°C for 500 hours. Figure 3.5 shows the approximate location where the specimens were extracted from for each particular test. The oxidation tests were carried out according to the ASTM G54-84 standard for static oxidation testing.

Figure 3.5: Specimens extracted from Step Blocks A and B for oxidation testing (only specimens extracted from Step Block B were used for repeatability studies).
The effect of chemical composition on the iron's resistance to oxidation was studied by carrying out high temperature oxidation tests on specimens taken from the 14mm section (Figure 3.5) of four different alloys (Table 3.1) cast at 1400°C. Each specimen was

machined and surface ground on all sides to 5xl0x20mm, thereby allowing exposure of 700mm^ of total surface area to the oxidizing atmosphere. Two more specimens were

53

Chapter 3 -- Experimental Procedure
subjected to oxidation tests from each composition. Thus, each test was carried out three times. A ll samples were selected at random from those with the same composition. The effect o f pouring temperature on the iron's resistance to oxidation was determined using 5xl0x20mm specimens obtained from the 14mm section of each casting. Specimens were also randomly picked from a particular pouring temperature population for the oxidation tests. These tests were not repeated, as the pouring temperatures did not have an effect on the iron's resistance to oxidation (discussed in Chapter 4). Oxidation tests were also carried out to determine the effect of section thickness on the iron's resistance to oxidation. 5xl0x20mm specimens were obtained from the 7, 14, 22 and 34mm sections (Figure 3.5) of Alloy 4 (Table 3.1) poured at 1450°C. This alloy was selected because it did not contain any misruns. 2.75x13x20mm sub-size specimens with a total surface are of 701.50mm^ were taken from the 4mm section. These tests were not repeated for the reasons explained in Chapter 4. After machining and surface grinding, the specimens were cleaned using an ultrasonic cleaner containing acetone for one minute. Thereafter, the prepared specimens were The specimens were

individually weighed and then placed into pre-baked ceramic crucibles. The individual mass of each crucible was weighed before and after the specimens were placed inside of them. The orientation o f the specimens in the crucibles was such that the maximum surface area of the specimens was exposed to the surrounding atmosphere at all times. The crucibles were then placed on firebricks and inserted into the furnace (Figure 3.6). The temperature at the centre of the firebrick was constantly monitored throughout the duration of the experiment using a thermocouple. A detailed CAD-model of the firebricks position in the furnace is given in Appendix B. Several steps were taken to ensure a controlled experiment. The data acquisition system (JDAS) used to monitor the furnace temperature was calibrated. The constant

temperature zone inside the three furnaces used was determined using an assembly referred to as the `Snail', which is illustrated in Figure 3.7. The thermocouples were positioned in the exact location of a crucible on the firebrick. Furnace testing was carried out at the oxidizing test temperatures o f 700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100°C. The temperature distribution within each furnace at the respective oxidizing temperatures is given in Appendix C.

Chapter 3 -- Experimental Procedure
After necessary calibration and verification (i.e., thermocouples, data acquisition system and furnaces), the firebricks were inserted into electric resistance furnaces and cycled for a cumulative time of 500 hours. The specimens were oxidized for 500 hours following the schedule in Table 3.6. At every cycle, the specimens were removed, cooled to room temperature and weighed (with an accuracy of ±0.1 mg) and then placed back in the furnace. The mass change per unit area for each time interval was determined:

Equation 3.1

where C is the mass change per unit area (mg/cm^), Wp is the final mass (mg), fFo is the original mass (mg) and A is the original surface area (cm^). The mass change per unit area was plotted against the cycle time. The weight change after 500 hours was also used to determine the parabolic rate constant 2kpff (g^/cm'^sec) from Pilling-Bedworth's relation (Equation 2.42). The microstructure of the oxide layer was also studied using optical and scanning electron microscopes. X-ray mappings of the oxide scales were produced to depict the

concentration and distribution o f particular elements.

MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

3.5.1 Preparation of the As-Cast and Oxidized Samples
Since this research partly focused on reducing the weight of components cast from the new ductile iron alloy, as-cast iron samples were analyzed from relatively thin sections (i.e., 4, 7 and 14mm) of the castings. Figure 3.8 shows where the samples were extracted and on which side they were polished.

In each case, metallographic samples were prepared according to principals outlined in sections 3.5.1.1 to 3.5.1.5.

This time varied depending on the micro structure to be analyzed. 3. Once removed from solution, the specimen was thoroughly cleansed in acetone and swabbed with cotton until dried.

3.5.1.5

Etching via the SPEED Technique

To reveal the details o f phases embedded within the ferritic matrix, such as dross and nodularity o f graphite, a special technique referred to as selective potentiostatic etching by electrolytic dissolution (SPEED) was used [126]. This etching technique allowed for the removal o f the ferritic matrix without destroying or removing specific oxides and graphite nodules, thus allowing for a three dimensional analysis of the phases without ambiguity (e.g., phase misrepresentation due to edge retention).

59

Chapter 3 -- Experimental Procedure
The SPEED etching technique was used to etch specimens in non-aqueous solutions at a predetermined electrical potential. The components to perform SPEED includes the electric control instrument (SPEED Analyser) and the electrolytic cell. The samples were polished as described earlier. The composition of the electrolyte used depends on the type of metal to be etched. A suitable electrical potential vs. current density curve must be used to determine the optimum composition o f the electrolyte needed to etch the specimens. For cast iron, 400mL of the electrolyte was composed of 10% acetylacetone (40mL) and 1% tetra-ethyl ammonium chloride (4g solid powder), the balance being methyl alcohol. The procedure for etching a specimen using SPEED is as follows:

1. The specimen was placed into the apparatus such that the polishing surface faced the active module of the reference calomel electrode. The distance between these two

devices had to be within 1 to 4mm. The sample was then immersed into the electrolyte. 2. The electric control unit was wired such that the red lead is for the cathode, black is for the anode (sample) and white is for the reference electrode. 3. The specimen was then immersed into the electrolyte. 4. The electric unit was adjusted to -SOOmV. The potential was increased by a factor of 50mV every 5 minutes until the voltage reached SOOmV. recorded for each increment of potential. 5. Once the etching was finished, the specimen was cleansed with methyl alcohol, placed into the ultrasonic cleaner and dried. 6. Intricate microstructural details could then be observed using the scanning electron microscope. The current density was

3.5.2 Optical Microscopy
Optical microscopy was used to study the graphite morphology, pearlite, dendrites, dross and slag, shrinkage and pinholes in as-cast and oxidized specimens. Using image analysis software, various phases, precipitates and defects were studied.

3.5.3 Electron Microscopy
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also used to study the graphite morphology, pearlite, dendrites and various defects. Chemical analysis using energy

dispersive spectrometry (EDS) was carried out on specific phases o f unknown composition. The beryllium window on the SEM was removed to analyze the relative concentration o f lighter elements in the cast iron. X-ray mapping of the oxide layer on select samples was carried out to study the relative phase distributions and concentrations o f various oxide contributing elements.

3.5.4 Computational Digital Image Analysis
Micrographs obtained from the optical and scanning electron microscopes were analyzed using Buehler's Omnimet® software. Every image imported into the software was calibrated and specific software programs were developed to quantify graphite nodules (nodule area fraction, size and distribution) and to determine the extent of certain defects.

63

Chapter 4 - Results and Discussion Nodule Size
The nodules in the 14mm thick specimens were distinctly larger than those in the 4mm thick specimens (Figure 4.1). Lower cooling rates and longer solidification times

allowed the graphite nodules to grow in the thick specimens. The size of some nodules in the 14mm section was as high as 31 jam, compared to 21pm in the 4mm specimen (based on specimens extracted from step blocks cast at 1450°C).

Figure 4 .1 : Effect of pouring temperature, casting thickness and metal chemistry on nodule size.
The data in Figure 4.1 suggests that the pouring temperature did not have a major effect on nodule size. In the pouring temperature range of 1350 to 1450°C, the average difference in nodule size in the 4 mm as well as 14mm thick specimens was only 1.5pm. However, there was a difference of 6 pm in the average nodule size between the 4mm and 14mm thick specimens for the same pouring temperature. Figure

nodules. It should be noted that the quality of the graphite nodule improved with increasing pouring temperature. Comparing Alloy 1 (3.5S1-2.0A1) with Alloy 4 (4.5S1-3.0A1), the data points for the 14mm thick specimen in Figure 4.1 indicate that the nodule size decreased with an increase in silicon contents. This effect is more pronounced in the thin (4mm) specimens.

The section thickness had a significant impact on nodule count. The nodule count number decreased with an increase in section thickness (Figures 4.3 and Figure 4.4). This effect is attributed to the difference in the cooling during solidification [21,23,45]. Increased solidification cooling rates promote a fine graphitic structure consisting of a large number of nodules [23,24,29,45,85]. As cooling rates decrease, transformation to a coarser structure results in a lower nodule count. A maximum nodule count of 550

nodules/mm^ was recorded for the 4mm thick specimen cast at 1350°C, compared to 250 nodules/mm^ for the 14mm thick specimen. Pouring temperature influences the nodule count. The largest variation was observed between the 1350 and 1400°C temperatures in the 4mm thick specimens, where the nodule

count decreased from an average of 500 to 350 nodules/mm^ (Figure 4.4). A corresponding decrease of 40 nodules/mm^ was observed in the 14mm thick specimens.

I f the graphite nodules are densely populated thus causing

nodule-to-nodule contact, resistance to internal oxidation can diminish. In grey cast irons, graphite forms a skeleton throughout the easting, along which the diHusion of oxygen is possible deep into the interior [13]. In ductile irons, the graphite nodules are relatively

isolated from one another. Thus, oxidation by this mechanism cannot occur. However, if nodule-to-nodule contact occurs within the casting, a network of nodules can produce a path for oxygen ions deep into the core o f the casting.

4.1.2.3

Percent Nodularity of Graphite
Additions o f aluminum to the ductile iron alloy did not degenerate (i.e., affect the

shape) the graphite. High aluminum content (3wt.%) in the alloy resulted in a relatively high percentage of spherical nodules. It was observed that the percent of nodules was greatest when the Si/Al ratio was 1.2 (3.5S1-3.0A1). The percentage of nodules decreased as the ratio increased from 1.5 (4.5Si-3.0Al) to 2.25 (4.5S1-2.0A1). This general effect is shown in

Figure 4.5 for 4 mm and 14mm thick specimens. However, such a trend is not explicit for the Si/Al ratio of 1.75 (3.5S1-2.0A1). The graphite sphericity in 4mm thick specimens was higher than that in the 14mm thick specimens when the Si/Al ratio was close to 1. The pouring temperature did not affect graphite sphericity significantly in the 14mm thick specimens (Figure 4.6). However, this was not so in the 4mm specimens. Maximum percentage o f nodules was observed when the liquid metal was poured at 1450°C and the
m in im u m

was observed at 1350°C. Factors responsible include prolonged holding times

(e.g., to enable cooling of the melt from the tapping temperature o f 1550°C to the pouring temperature of 1350°C), resulting in magnesium fade, and higher cooling rates associated with lower pouring temperatures. These factors possibly prevented the spheroidizing

elements from completely reacting with graphite.

4.1.3 Casting Defects
4.1.3.1 General Casting Features
The step block eastings were sound except for a few misruns in the thin section. Preventing misruns indeed is one of the biggest challenges in producing thin-wall castings. Cast step blocks produced are shown in Figures 4.7 to 4.10.

The pouring temperatures and the aluminum and silicon contents largely influenced the size of a misrun. Step blocks of Alloy 3 (4.5Si-2.0Al) showed misruns when poured at 1350°C (Figure 4.9(a)). The same alloy poured at 1400 and 1450°C did not show any misrun (Figures 4.9(b) and 4.9(c)). When the silicon content decreased to 3.5wt.%, misruns were observed in castings poured at 1350 and 1400°C (Figures 4.7(a), 4.7(b) and 4.8). Step blocks produced with Alloy 4 (4.5Si-3.0Al) showed similar degree of misruns as those of Alloy 3 (Figures 4.10(b) and 4.10(c)). However, fold defects were observed in Alloy 4 (4.5S1-3.0A1)

(Figure 4.10(b)). Castings produced from Alloy 2 (3.5Si-3.0Al) experienced large misruns (Figure 4.8). Also, a glassy oxide film was observed to envelope the surfaces of castings containing the highest levels of aluminum. These castings experienced severe misruns.

Chemical analysis of the slag composition showed presence of oxides of magnesium, aluminum, silicon, calcium, cerium and iron (Figures 4.13(b) and 4.13(c)). Strings of slag associated with dross dominated the cope side of the 14mm thick specimens poured at 1350°C (Figure 4.14).

Figure 4.14: (a) Optical micrograph of slag and dross in a 14mm thick specimen cast at 1350°C (50X) and (b) digital image analysis of Figure 4.14(a).
Two different types of slag and dross films can be observed during pouring, fluid and semi-solid [127]. During pouring, fluid slag films can be absorbed by the moulding medium or trapped by filters placed within the mould. Oxide films which enter the mould will float to the top surface of the melt during filling. These films eventually envelope the outside surface of the casting. This interesting phenomenon was observed and the films can be seen in Figures
4 .8

and 4 . 1 0 . Semi-solid slag and dross films consist of solid phases bound weakly

in the stream of a more fluid phase. When the semi-solid slag enters the mould cavity, it breaks up. The resulting clusters of slag and dross become trapped beneath the surface of the casting and result in defects illustrated in Figure 4.14 above. Even more detrimental is the entrapment of these clusters within the melt inside the mould, as illustrated in Figures 4.12(a) and 4.13(a). This occurs when the melt solidifies rapidly, thereby not allowing the slag and dross to float to the cope.

73

Chapter 4 Results and Discussion

Depending on oxygen availability and dwell time, as the melt temperature decreases, a two phase mixture (slag) of SiOa (solid) and FeO (liquid) w ill form [21]. Slag may also include MgO, A I2O3, CaO and Ce oxides from charge materials, inoculants and furnace refractories [21,90,91]. Other film related defects such as dross may precipitate from lower melting slags, which may appear as a chunky or powdery substance on or near the surface of a casting. Since iron (the element) is the major constituent (90%) of the cast iron, as the temperature decreases, FeO becomes the dominant constituent found in all slags [21,90]. High FeO contents in the slag can produce defects such as pinholes when it reacts with free carbon (Equation 2.17). Complex iron-silicon oxide systems may react with MgO, A I2O3, CaO and Ce oxides to prevent Si0 2 -Fe0 type slags from developing [21]. This may include the formation o f forsterite (Mg 2Si0 4 ), enstatite (MgSi0 3 ) and fayalite (Fe2Si0 4 ) [21,90,91,127]. This is indicated in the chemical analysis obtained from slag (Figures

4.13(b) and 4.13(c)), where high magnesium, aluminum, calcium and cerium contents were observed. As the pouring temperature increased to 1400°C, the slag strings observed earlier in the 4mm thick specimens were no longer positioned along the centreline, but above it (Figure 4.15). The amount of slag in the 4mm thick specimen decreased with increasing pouring temperatures. Increasing the temperature well above 1400°C (prior to pouring) prevented slag from forming on the surface o f the melt [2 1 ]. Raising and holding the temperature above the equilibrium oxidation-reduction temperature w ill result in rapid oxidation of carbon [128] (Elingham Diagram, section 2.3.1). As a result, silicon will not oxidize unless carbon contents fall below lwt.% and more free oxygen is made available. Slag and dross were not observed in the 7mm thick specimens. With increased

pouring temperatures and solidification times, the slag had ample time to float to the surface. As a result, a thin discontinuous film of dross lined the surface of the casting. In the 14mm thick specimens, dross was present below the skin of the casting. This occurred as a result o f a larger section thickness and longer solidification times, which allowed clusters of dross to accumulate below the surface of the casting. However, a 6 % reduction in dross was observed for a casting temperature of 1400°C (Figure 4.16) compared to 1350°C (Figure 4.14). This occurred for reasons discussed earlier. The SEM micrograph in Figure 4.17 illustrates typical dross topography in a 14mm thick specimen cast at 1400°C.

Chapter 4 -- Results and Discussion A region containing a lump of dross was found along the centreline of a 4mm thick
specimen poured at 1450°C. Following the observation of Heine [21], it is suggested that higher pouring temperatures allowing larger quantities of dissolved oxygen possibly caused this defect. In the sample location, this region constituted 12% of total surface area (Figure 4.18). Only two such regions were identified along the centreline. Upon repolishing and etching with nital, detrimental micro-cracks were revealed (Figure 4.19). These micro-cracks were within the oxide film and along the perimeter of the oxide-metal interface. Such cracks could potentially limit the fatigue life o f the material [129]. The sample was further etched using SPEED, and it was further observed that dross was trapped within a shrinkage pore during solidification (Figures 4.20(a), 4.20(b) and 4.20(c)). It is thus possible that the

entrapped dross was unable to float to the surface during the late stages o f solidification, in spite o f extended solidification times due to higher pouring temperatures. Chemical analysis (Figure 4.21) of the shrinkage pore in Figure 4.20(c) showed that the cast iron was relatively high in carbon and low in aluminum, silicon and iron. Wallace et al. [109] and Li et al. [110] suggested that the amount of shrinkage decreased with increasing carbon content. Since graphite precipitation depends on the carbon equivalent (%C +

%Si/7), increasing the CE to precipitate more graphite has become an attractive means for compensating liquid contraction in thin sections. It was explained earlier that graphite

nucléation causes expansion o f the mould (section 2.2.4). In thicker sections, high CE iron cannot overcome amplified mould dilations [109]. However, in thinner sections, such as 4mm, the primary cause for shrinkage occurs during solidification [ I I I ] . The formation of complex Fe, Si and A1 oxides and other crystals will transform the liquid metal (now deficient in iron, silicon and aluminum) into a viscous fluid, thus impeding its flow. As a result, dross will be prevented from floating to the surface and become trapped in shrinkage pores developed as a result o f other parameters (i.e., mould dilation and dendrites). Discontinuous slag was observed above the centreline in a 7mm thick specimen cast at 1450°C (Figure 4.22(a)). It is suggested that the slag was a complex ternary compound composed o f iron, silicon and aluminum oxides. This was determined from the chemical analysis (Figure 4.22(b)) of point A in Figure 4.22(a). The amount o f slag in this specimen was similar to that in the 7mm thick specimen cast at 1350°C. However, rapid cooling during holding, pouring and moulding could have produced large quantities of iron, silicon

and magnesium oxides and silicon rich compounds such as forsterite (Mg 2Si0 4 ), enstatite (MgSiOs) and fayalite (Fc2Si0 4 ).

As the section thickness increased to 14mm, specimens cast at 1450°C exhibited much of the same trend observed in castings produced at 1350 and 1400°C. Slag and dross accumulated below the skin of the casting. Slag and dross concentrations at higher

temperatures were reduced by 1%, compared to 14mm thick specimens cast at 1400°C. The higher pouring temperature prevented silicon dioxide and other oxides from forming. This is in agreement with the earlier observation of Heine [21].

The pouring temperature (i.e., 1350, 1400 and 1450°C) did not affeet the formation of pinholes. Pinholes were observed in Alloy 1 (3.5Si-2.0Al) and Alloy 2 (3.5Si-3.0Al). The average size of a pinhole pore in Alloys 1 and
2

was 0.9 and 1.7pm, respeetively. These

pinholes, magnified 1700X and 1500X, are shown in Figures 4.31(a) and 4.31(b). The alloy with a higher aluminum content showed larger pinholes. Further, the number of pinholes observed in Alloy 2 increased (relative to Alloy 1).

increased with an increasing aluminum content. Also, the pinhole distributions were random and no distinct patterns could be resolved. But, the size and number o f pinholes observed in Alloys 3 and 4 (relative to Alloys 1 and 2) were higher. This feature is attributed to the moisture content in the mould and an oxygen saturated liquid metal (section 2.2.3.5) Pinholes were not observed in 14mm thick specimens. However, porosity and

blowholes associated with slag and dross developed below the surface of the casting.

Chapter 4 -- Results and Discussion 4.1.3.5 Shrinkage Defects

The section thickness and pouring temperature affected the degree of shrinkage. Shrinkage defects were observed in the 4mm thick specimens and, to a lesser extent, in the 7 and 14mm thick specimens. Shrinkage defects observed in the 4mm thick specimens are attributed to high cooling rates. This can be observed in Figures 4.34 to 4.37 for the alloy poured at 1350, 1400 and 1450°C. There was no clear observed effect of concentrations of silicon and aluminum on the formation of shrinkage cavities. It is thus suggested that a CE of
4 .6

was maintained in every casting, and the observed shrinkage was not a result of

composition. Shrinkage was more pronounced in 4mm thick specimens cast at 1350 and 1400°C. Increased cooling rate and the degree o f graphite nucléation in the molten ductile iron influenced the amount shrinkage produced in these specimens. Excellent inoculation and rapid cooling rates in these castings resulted in higher nodule counts. This was determined earlier in Figure 4.4. Higher nodule counts increase the fineness o f the intermixed liquid-solid solidifying mass, thereby making it very mushy [109]. The increased viscosity and the pressure of the expanding eutectic graphite together restrict the flow of the solidifying mass.

A dendritic structure is characterized by long and thin spikes oriented in specific crystallographic directions. These spikes constitute branches containing primary, secondary, tertiary and even higher order arms. When metal cools rapidly, particularly along the mould walls, a vast number of fine dendrites will form. This was observed in Figure 4.38.

87

Chapter 4 -- Results and Discussion
During solidification, the expansion of graphite and the collision of dendrites with dendrites w ill cause the fragile higher order dendrite arms to break. These solid fragments w ill increase the viscosity of the melt [130]. These solutes w ill segregate in the liquid and cause shrinkage pores, particularly along the casting centreline to form. Centreline shrinkage typically occurs from the entrapment o f a solute-rich interdendritic liquid from surrounding areas into a low pressure unfilled region [131]. This w ill ultimately form a defect that can be referred to as interdendritic shrinkage. Examples o f interdendritic shrinkage pores were

found in 4mm thick specimens, and these are illustrated in Figures 4.39,4.40 and 4.41.

OXIDATION CHARACTERISTICS and MICROSTRUCTURAL FEATURES of DUCTILE IRON ALLOYS OXIDIZED for 500 hours at 700, 800, 9 0 0 ,1 0 0 0 and 1100°C
Factors affecting the oxidation behaviour of Alloys 1, 2, 3 and 4 were studied. A ll

the experiments on the effect of alloy composition were repeated twice. The experimental results and the statistical analyses of these tests are given in Appendix D. Data obtained from single trial tests (effects of pouring temperature and section thickness) are not included in the appendix. The results are presented as weight lost (i.e., due to decarburization) and gained (i.e., due to formation of metal oxides) per unit area. The total weight gain of a specimen represents the addition of the absolute value of weight lost and weight gained (i.e., I weight lost (-ve) | + | weight gained (+ve) | ) (Appendix E).

4.2.1 Effect of Composition on Oxidation Behaviour
Three ductile iron specimens were taken from Alloy
1

(3.5Si-2.0Al), Alloy 2 (3.5Si-

3.0A1), Alloy 3 (4.5S1-2.0A1) and Alloy 4 (4.5S1-3.0A1) for this test. These specimens were exposed at atmospheric pressure in air at a temperature of 700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100°C and cycled for 500 hours. The oxidation kinetics of each alloy followed the parabolic time law. The results of the loss or gain in weight as a function of time were plotted and are shown in sections 4 .2 . 1.1 to 4.2.1.5. Every alloy experienced weight loss during the early stages of testing. This resulted from the oxidation of surface graphite and surrounding carbon. The extent of weight loss progressively decreased as a direct consequence of the formation o f a very thin protective oxide scale on the surface, which inhibited further oxidation. Similar observations were made by other researchers [8,9,13,14,114]. The growth of scales proceeded rapidly becoming several micrometers thick in alloys containing lower silicon and aluminum contents. Non-steady state oxidation (section 2 .3 .2 . 1) occurred during the initial hours o f testing. However, upon reaching a steady state the

thickness o f the oxide scale was constant (which is expected for diffusion controlled oxidation) [116]. At temperatures exceeding 1000°C, abundant spalling of the oxide scale occurred during cooling.

Results and Discussion

A thin adherent oxide layer was observed on specimens from Alloys 1, 2, 3 and 4. It can be observed from Figures 4.42(a) to 4.42(d) that specimens containing the lowest aluminum and silicon content exhibited minute oxide nodules scattered across the surface. This effect diminished as the aluminum and silicon content increased.

hours, where oxidation proceeded rapidly. eventually reaching a plateau.

The rate of oxidation decreased thereafter,

Alloy 2 (3.5S1-3.0A1) oxidized moderately with a total weight gain of 1.4mg/cm^ after 500 hours (Figure 4.44). An increase in the aluminum content from 2 to 3wt.% almost doubled the alloys resistance to oxidation. Alloy 3 (4.5S1-2.0A1) experienced a total weight gain of 1.2mg/cm^ (Figure 4.45). The oxidation behaviour was similar to that of Alloy 2. Increasing the silicon and aluminum content from 3.5 to 4.5wt.% and 2 to 3wt.% respectively, resulted in maximum resistance to oxidation. Alloy 4 (4.5S1-3.0A1)

experienced a total weight gain o f only 0.4mg/cm^ (Figure 4.46). This is approximately three times the resistance exhibited by Alloys 2 and 3 and seven times the resistance exhibited by Alloy 1. Figure 4.47 compares the oxidation behaviour of Alloys 1, 2, 3 and 4. Scale stability was achieved quickly by alloys containing higher silicon contents, which constitutes the ability o f high silicon irons to produce oxide scales impermeable to oxygen ions very quickly. Similar observations were made by Pelhan [13].

Chapter 4 -- Results and Discussion 4.2.1.2 Oxidation at 800°C for 500 hours

The oxide scale became progressively thinner as the silicon and aluminum content increased. These trends are shown in Figures 4.48(a) to 4.48(d). Also, the size o f the oxide nodules on the surface of Alloy 1 increased with an increase in the oxidation temperature. X-ray analysis of the oxide scales was performed. X-ray maps of the oxide scale produced on Alloy 2 (3.5Si-3.0Al) are given in Figure 4.49. The mapping revealed that the oxide scale consisted of several layers, an external layer composed of iron oxides and an internal layer composed of oxides of iron, silicon and aluminum. Traces of molybdenum rich precipitates were also identified below the oxide scale.

Chapter 4 -- Results and Discussion
Alloy 1 (3.5S1-2.0A1) exhibited a total weight gain of 0.6mg/cm^ after 500 hours (Figure 4.50). A plateau was not observed and oxidation continually progressed throughout the duration of the test. Oxide ridges were accompanied by micro-cracks on the scale

surface, and these possibly provide an explanation for the continued corrosion of the sample. These cracks suggest that dilation of the specimen occurred during thermal cycling, thus breaking the scale and continuously exposing the metal to oxygen. Sample dilation could have resulted from the difference in expansion coefficient of the individual oxides and metal as well as the evolution of gases arising from the thermal oxidation of carbon (i.e., CO and CO2). Similar observations were made by Nofal et al. [8 ]. Further, the volumetric stability o f the specimen can be compromised through the decomposition of pearlite, which could cause the scale to rupture. During cyclic oxidation testing, all these factors generate stresses that contribute to cracking o f the scale. Once ruptured, oxygen can penetrate into the metal, thus forming a fresh oxide scale. This process could repeat itself indefinitely. However, the effect of pearlite decomposition is temperature-time dependent and w ill diminish after a specific number o f cycles (Figure 2.7, section 2.1.8.2). Alloy 2 (3.5S1-3.0A1) showed a total weight gain of 0.4mg/cm^ (Figure 4.51). However, a significantly high initial weight loss of 0.3mg/cm^ was observed. Electron

microscopy and x-ray analysis of the metal-oxide interface suggests that the initial weight loss was related to the size o f the remaining cavity when graphite nodules oxidized. Also, the extent of weight loss can increase appreciably if the cavity is accompanied by a defect, such as a shrinkage pore, a series of pinholes or cellular slag and dross. Such a phenomenon is readily illustrated in Figure 4.52. When a cavity develops, oxygen can use this path to diffuse into the internal core of the casting. I f this path leads to the surface o f an internal pore, the graphite and surrounding carbon can oxidize preferentially. Internal oxidation will continue until a protective oxide scale develops and lines the surface of the pore. X-ray maps (Figure 4.49) o f the same area in Figure 4.52 show that the pores were lined with oxides of aluminum, silicon and iron. In addition, the oxidation of iron can result in the formation of an iron oxide nodule above the pore. From this analysis it was suggested that oxide nodules developed as a result of internal defects. From the x-ray analysis in Figure 4.49, it was suggested that the nodule was primarily composed o f oxides of iron.

Figure 4.52: SEM micrograph of an oxide nodule that formed over a subsurface defect pore in Alloy 1 (3.5SI-2.0AI) oxidized at 800°C. 700X. Nital etched.
The excess iron from the internal surface of the crevice yielded more oxidizable iron per unit of external surface area, thus producing a layer several times thicker at that particular point, compared to a layer formed elsewhere along the external surface of the sample. As a result, it is suggested that a correlation may exist between the size of the oxide nodule and the size o f the crevice. Mapping o f the developed oxide nodules could eventually provide a map of subsurface defects and ultimately determine the materials resistance to oxidation, at a fraction of the time currently required. In general, samples containing internal defects close to the surface w ill experience a high initial weight loss provided everything else remains constant (i.e., size, surface area, surface finish and oxidizing temperature). Furthermore, subsurface crevices could result in forming an external scale composed of oxide nodules. Figure 4.53 illustrates this phenomenon on one of the specimens from Alloy oxidized at 800°C. Alloy 3 (4.5Si-2.0Al) exhibited a total weight gain of 0.6mg/cm^ (Figure 4.54). However, the initial weight loss was high. This was attributed to the possible presence of subsurface defects.

Alloy 4 (4.5Si-3.0AI) showed excellent oxidation resistance. After 500 hours, this alloy had a total weight gain of 0 .3 mg/cm^ (Figure 4.55). The four alloys showed much greater resistance to oxidation at 800°C then at 700°C. This phenomenon was possibly due to the greater mobility of atoms at higher temperatures. This allowed the alloying elements to oxidize more rapidly, thereby producing a protective scale during the early stages of testing. The effect of increasing the silicon and aluminum content on the oxidation resistance of each alloy at 800°C for 500 hours is shown in Figure 4.56. In general, the resistance to oxidation at 800°C was enhanced as the silicon and aluminum content increased. Work by Sponseller et al. [14] on the oxidation behaviour of ductile irons alloyed with aluminum, silicon and molybdenum showed that respectable resistance to oxidation could be achieved. They showed that ductile iron alloyed with 4wt.% silicon, 2wt.%

molybdenum and 0.9wt.% aluminum had a weight gain of 6.24mg/cm^ after 500 hours at 816°C. This is a ten fold increase in mass per unit area compared to Alloy 1, which exhibited the poorest resistance to oxidation among the alloys studied. In the current study, significant improvement to the oxidation resistance of ductile iron at 800°C was achieved.

4.2.1.3

Alloy 1 developed a thick dark oxide scale consisting of densely populated oxide nodules (Figure 4.57(a)). Surface spalling was not observed. This alloy showed a total

weight gain of 45mg/em^ (Figure 4.58). This sample oxidized continuously during the 500 hours of cycling. A plateau was not reached and the rate of oxidation was observed to remain constant (the slope did not change) throughout the test. When Alloy I was sectioned, porous oxide scales were observed, as illustrated in Figures 4.59(a), 4.60 and 4.61. Large fissure defects accompanied by blistering were

observed along the edges of the sample. It is suggested that these subscale defects resulted from the combustion o f graphite and surrounding carbon. I f the oxide scale cracks during the course of testing and allows oxygen to penetrate to the metal, graphite and the surrounding carbon w ill oxidize. Typically, for every mole of oxygen consumed by carbon, two moles of carbon monoxide gas will form.

Further, carbon can react with FcO (Equation 2.17) to produce CO. Also, reaction between CO and FeO can produce CO2 (Equation 2.28). These reactions can occur only when the gases can escape through the porous scale. When the scale matures and mass transport is ceased, the pressure due to CO and CO2 gases can cause the oxide scale to blister [120]. The chemical analysis (Figure 4.59(b)) of the scale in Figure 4.59(a) showed a combination of iron, aluminum and silicon oxides, in addition to molybdenum rich precipitates. X-ray mapping (Figures 4.60 and 4.61) of the scale along the side and at the comer of the specimen (Figure 4.61) shows the relative amounts of aluminum, silicon, iron and molybdenum present. The scale consisted of a very thick external layer of iron oxide composed of FeO (wiistite), Fe3Ü 4 (magnetite) and Fe2 03 (haematite), according to the ironoxygen phase diagram (Figure 2.19). An internal layer of aluminum (possibly composed of

103

Chapter 4 -- Results and Discussion
AI2O3 and FeAl2 0 4 ) and silicon (possibly composed of Si0 2 and Fc2Si0 4 ) oxides was observed [13]. O f the many layers that make up the oxide scale, the FeO layer w ill be the thickest. It is known that the diffixsion of oxygen and iron in FeO is significantly large (section 2.3.2.1) and because o f the greater mobility of defects in FeO [16,132]. Alloy 2 (4.5Si-3.0Al) developed a thinner oxide layer that was not as porous as the one observed on Alloy 1. This is illustrated in Figure 4.57(b). The scale thickness did not reach steady values, oxidizing continuously throughout the duration o f the test. Cracks were observed along the edges of the specimens. Possible factors include different expansion coefficients of the oxides and the metal, pearlite decomposition and the transformation of ferrite to austenite during cycling. X-ray analysis (Figures 4.62 and 4.63) at various points along the scale yielded an oxide layer composition similar to Alloy 1. However, a large concentration o f stable aluminum precipitates was detected below the scale (i.e., blaek precipitates on the right side of Figure 4.62(a) and the bright white constituents in Figure 4.62(d)). These precipitates are believed to be complex iron-aluminum e-carbides. From Figure 4.62, these carbides appear to be very stable and no sign of decomposition was observed after cycling for 500 hours at 900°C. These observations are in agreement with the results o f Nofal et al. [8 ] for an iron alloy containing 3.5wt.% silicon and 9wt.% aluminum. After 500 hours, this alloy exhibited a weight gain of 3.6mg/cm^ (Figure 4.64). A thin oxide scale covered with large oxide nodules developed on Alloy 3 (Figure 4.57(c)). Chemical analysis o f these nodules yielded a high content o f iron, thereby possibly composed of oxides o f iron. Similar observations were made by Tholence and Norell [28]. It was discussed earlier (section 4.2.1.2) that the position and size of these nodules could be related to the size and number o f subsurface defects in the sample. Thus, it is suggested that Alloy 3 contained an appreciable amount o f subsurface defects. The scale thickness o f Alloy 3 quickly attained steady values. After 500 hours at 900°C, Alloy 3 experienced a total weight gain of O.lmg/cm^ (Figure 4.65). Alloy 4 developed a thin adherent scale containing oxide nodules (Figure 4.57(d)). The number of oxide nodules covering the surface of the sample was significantly lower than exhibited by Alloy 3. The scale thickness o f Alloy 4 quickly attained steady values. The total weight gain was 0.25mg/cm^ (Figure 4.66), which is approximately twice as high relative to Alloy 3.

Time (hrs) Figure 4.66: Oxidation behaviour of Alloy 4 (4.5SI-3.0AI) cycled for 500 hrs at 900°C.
Figure 4.67 shows the relative oxidation characteristics of Alloys 1 , 2 , 3 and 4. At 900°C, alloys containing the highest silicon content exhibited superior resistance to oxidation. However, alloys containing the highest aluminum and silicon content contained a lower amount of oxide nodules on the scale surface. This observation suggests that

aluminum might play a key role in the size and amount of oxide nodules formed. Li et al. [16] studied the oxidation kinetics of ductile irons containing silicon and molybdenum. Following 500 hours o f testing at 900°C, their results showed a total weight gain o f 7 mg/cm^ for an alloy containing 4wt.% silicon and a weight gain of l.Smg/cm^ for an alloy containing 4.8wt.% silicon. However, a total weight gain of 3.6mg/cm^ was exhibited by Alloy 2 and negligible weight gain by Alloys 3 and 4. Thus, the current research suggests that relatively low silicon contents (i.e., 4.5wt.%) supplemented by controlled additions of aluminum can yield an alloy exhibiting excellent resistance to oxidation.

Alloy 1 developed an oxide scale which delaminated from the specimen (Figure 4.68(a)). The suggested causes for the deleterious scale include the different expansion

coefficient of the individual oxides and metal, and the ferrite to austenite phase transformation. The total weight gain of this alloy after 500 hours was 48mg/cm^ (Figure 4.69). Alloy 2 developed a scale covered with regions containing oxide nodules (Figure
4 .6 8 (b)).

Severe spalling occurred during cooling. The total weight gain of this alloy after

500 hours was 19mg/cm^ (Figure 4.70). Alloy 3 developed a scale containing a finer distribution of oxide nodules (Figure 4.68(c)). Surface spallation was observed to occur only at the site of the precipitated oxide nodules during cooling. After 500 hours, the total weight gain of Alloy 3 was 5mg/cm^ (Figure 4.71).

Alloy 4 developed a thin scale.

Only the top surface of the sample contained a

network of oxide nodules (Figure 4.68(d)). Interestingly, surface spalling occurred only on the surface containing the oxide nodules. The total weight gain of this alloy after 500 hours was 3.5mg/cm^ (Figure 4.72). The oxidation resistance of Alloys 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 is compared in Figure 4.73. Poor resistance to oxidation was exhibited by Alloys 1 and 2 at 1000°C. Superior resistance to oxidation was exhibited by Alloys 3 and 4 at 1000°C. Spalling was confined to only one side of Alloy 4 whereas spalling occurred over the entire surface of Alloy 3. Such spalling was more pronounced in regions containing an interconnected network of oxide nodules. Controlling this feature could enable a ductile iron alloy capable of withstanding over
1 0 0 0 °C.

Excessive

Alloys 1, 2, 3 and 4 exhibited very poor resistance to oxidation.

temperatures causing phase transformation (a-ferrite to y-austenite) and high thermal expansion gradients between the individual oxide layers and between the oxides and the base metal completely destroyed the samples. Alloy 1 developed a very thick scale that delaminated several times over during the course of the experiment (Figure 4.74(a)). This alloy experienced a total weight gain of 387mg/cm^ (Figure 4.75). Alloy 2 exhibited a scale that cracked and then spalled (Figure 4.74(b)). A total weight gain of 3 9 9 mg/cm^ was experienced by Alloy 2 (Figure 4.75). Alloy 3 developed a very thick scale (Figure 4.74(c)). The outer shell of the scale flaked o ff during cooling. This alloy exhibited a total weight gain o f 396mg/cm^ (Figure 4.75).

Figure 4.74: The extent of oxidation due to thermal cycling at 1100°C.

Alloy 4 exhibited a thick, porous scale which was tightly packed (Figure 4.74(d)). Micro-cracks along the surface of the scale were observed but no spalling occurred. Alloy 4 experienced a total weight gain of 401mg/cm^ (Figure 4.75). Due to close and unequivocal correlation between the observations in Figure 4.74 and the results in Figure 4.75, these tests were not repeated and further analysis of the samples was not carried out. Alloys 1, 2, 3 and 4 are clearly not suitable for operating temperatures in excess of 1000°C. The silicon and aluminum contents used were insufficient to provide oxidation resistance above these temperatures.

The effect o f the oxidizing temperature on Alloys 1, 2, 3 and 4 was studied. Plots were made to observe the relative effects of temperature on the oxidation kinetics of each alloy. Alloy 1 (3.5Si-2.0Al) exhibited a fair amount o f resistance to oxidation at 700 and 800°C (Figure 4.76). Alloy 2 exhibited a higher degree of resistance to oxidation at 700, 800 and 900 C (Figure 4.77). Alloy 3 (4.5S1-2.0A1) maintained an acceptable amount o f

resistance to oxidation (i.e., no degradation) ranging from 700 to 1000°C (Figure 4.78). Alloy 4 (4.5S1-3.0A1) maintained excellent oxidation characteristics from 700 to 1000°C (Figure 4.79). A ll the four alloys practically showed no resistance to oxidation at 1100°C.

4.2.3 Effect of Pouring Temperature and Section Thickness on Oxidation Behaviour
The effect o f pouring temperature on the oxidation characteristics o f Alloys 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 was studied. Further, the effect of section thickness was also studied, but this test was only carried out on Alloy 4. These tests were carried out at 800°C. From Figures 4.80 to 4.83, it was observed that the pouring temperature did not affect the oxidation characteristics o f the alloys. The only observable effect was an increased

resistance to oxidation (lower total weight gains) as the aluminum and silicon content was increased. There was some scatter in the data; however, the data was not sufficient to

conclude that pouring temperatures influenced the oxidation kinetics. Increasing the section thickness did not affect the oxidation characteristics o f the alloys. Every section thickness exhibited similar trends in weight loss and gain. This is shown in Figure 4.84. Further, some data scatter was observed, but the data was not

sufficient to conclude that section thickness affected the resistance to oxidation in the range of thickness studied.

4.2.4 Parabolic Oxidation Rate Constant
Using the Pilling and Bedworth [113] relationship (Equation 2.42), the parabolic oxidation rate constant 2kpB was determined to compare the rate o f oxidation with increasing temperatures and increasing silicon and aluminum contents. Linear regression analysis of the scattered data was plotted to illustrate these trends. The rate of oxidation decreased appreciably as the silicon and aluminum content increased. This is readily observed in Figure 4.85.

DILATOMETRY ANALYSIS
The coefficient o f thermal expansion and the a-ferrite to y-austenite phase

transformation temperature for Alloys 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 was determined using a dilatometer. Samples were slowly heated and cooled at a constant rate of 2°C/min. The subsequent

124

Chapter 4 -- Results and Discussion
heating and cooling curves for each alloy arc illustrated in Figures 4.87 to 4.89. Differentiation of the heating curves yielded the thermal expansion coefficient and the transformation temperature range for each alloy (Figures 4.90 to 4.93). There were no significant differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion for Alloys 1, 2, 3 and 4. However, the coefficient of thermal expansion for each alloy

progressively increased with an increase in temperature. The critical a-ferrite to y-austenite phase transformation temperature was determined from the inflection point in Figures 4.90 to 4.93. With increasing silicon and aluminum contents, the critical transformation temperature increased by approximately 115°C. This can be seen by the data for Alloy 1 (3.5S1-2.0A1) and that for Alloy 4 (4.5S1-3.0A1). Details of the effect o f compositional changes on the phase transformation temperature are shown in Table 4.2. The transformation studies suggest that Alloys 1,2,3 and 4 did not form austenite up to an operating temperature of about 860°C. Alloys 2, 3 and 4 maintained an austenite free structure up to about 950°C. Alloys 3 and 4 did not undergo a phase transformation up to about 980°C. The addition of 1wt.% aluminum can increase the critical phase transformation temperature by about 80°C. The addition of lwt.% silicon can enable an increase of the operating temperature by 30°C to approximately 110°C. Silicon and aluminum, together had a significant role in increasing the transformation temperature.

Conclusions
This thesis focused on developing ductile irons for high temperature applications. Four ductile iron alloys poured at 1350, 1400 and 1450°C containing 1.5wt.% molybdenum and different concentrations of aluminum and silicon (i.e., 3.5Si-2.0Al, 3.5Si-3.0Al, 4.5Si2.0A1,4.5Si-3.0Al) were characterized in the as-cast and oxidized states. The effects of alloy chemistry, pouring temperature and section thickness on graphite morphology and defects were investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopes. Further, the effects of alloy chemistry, pouring temperature and section thickness on the oxidation kinetics of the alloys were studied by subjecting the samples to thermal oxidation at 700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100°C for 500 hours. Dilatometry tests were also carried out to determine the effects of different silicon and aluminum contents on the critical a-ferrite to y-austenite phase transformation temperature and the coefficient of thermal expansion. On the basis of this research work, the following conclusions were developed.

Graphite Morphology
1. The nodule size increased with an increase in section thickness, while the nodule count increased with a decrease in section thickness. This was attributed to increased cooling rates with decreased section thickness. Temperature effects on nodule size were

negligible. However, as pouring temperatures increased, the nodule count decreased. Again, these effects are attributed to cooling rates associated with pouring temperature and section thickness. Further, increasing the silicon content decreased the size of the nodules and increased nodule counts. This occurred because silicon is able to graphitize and increase nodule counts, which reduces nodule size (section 2.1.2).

Chapter 5 --Conclusions
2. Maximum percentage of spherical graphite was attained when the Si/Al ratio was close to

1. 0. H i g h e r Si/Al

r a t i o s r e d u c e d t h e s p h e r i c i t y .A s t h e p o u r i n g t e m p e r a t u r e s i n c r e a s e d ,

the percentage o f spherical graphite increased, particularly in the 4mm specimens.

Defect Analysis
1. Sound castings were produced from Alloy 3 poured at 1400 and 1450°C. Alloys 1,2 and 4 exhibited varying degrees o f misruns. 2. Graphite floatation was not observed in any alloy in the 4, 7 and 14mm thick specimens. 3. As the aluminum content increased, the amounts of both slag and dross increased. This is particularly evidenced by SEM analysis of Alloy 2 (relative to Alloy 1) and Alloy 4 (relative to Alloy 3). 4. Alloy 1 contained slag and dross in the 4, 7 and 14mm thick specimens. As the section thickness and pouring temperature increased, the slag and dross moved from the centre of the specimens to regions below the top surface. 5. Alloy 2 exhibited much of the same trends as Alloy 1. However, the quantity of slag and dross in Alloy 2 was higher. 6. Alloy 3 did not exhibit slag or dross in the 4 and 7mm thick samples cast at 1350, 1400 and 1450°C. However, subsurface slag was observed in 14mm thick samples cast at 1350 and 1400°C. This defect was not observed at 1450°C. 7. As the pouring temperature increased, slag was not observed in the thinner sections of Alloy 4. However, the slag content increased appreciably as the section thickness and pouring temperature increased. 8. The size and number of pinholes increased with increasing aluminum content. Further, the pouring temperature did not affect the formation of pinholes. Other pinhole like defects included the presence o f porosity below slag scales.

131

Chapter 5 - Conclusions
9. The section thickness and pouring temperature affected the degree of shrinkage. Shrinkage defects were more readily observed in the 4mm than in the 7 and 14mm thick specimens. The shrinkage in the 4mm thick specimens was attributed to rapid cooling rates and high viscosity of the liquid metal, which resulted from high nodule counts and dendrites. There was no clear observed effect of alloy chemistry on the formation of shrinkage cavities.

Oxidation Kinetics and Dilatometry
1. As the silicon and aluminum contents increased from 3.5 to 4.5wt.% and from 2.0 to 3.0wt.%, respectively, the resistance to oxidation increased appreciably, particularly at higher temperatures. This is attributed to greater mobility o f atoms at higher

temperatures resulting in greater resistance to oxidation at 800°C (relative to 700°C). This in turn possibly allowed the protective oxide layer to develop more rapidly. However, this effect diminished with higher temperatures and scaling tendencies due to specimen dilation (caused by decomposition and transformation o f phases) and the relative coefficients of expansion of the base metal and oxides. These factors also

allowed some specimens to continuously oxidize throughout the course o f the test, thus not allowing the scale to reach steady values. This effect was more pronounced in Alloys 1 and 2. 2. The extent of initial weight loss in the oxidation specimens was attributed to subsurface defects. Further, it was suggested that there was a correlation between oxide nodule counts and the concentration of subsurface defects. However, the extent of oxide nodule formation was dependent on the ability of the alloying elements to produce an adherent non-permeable scale. 3. X-ray mapping o f the oxide scales revealed an external layer composed of oxides of iron (i.e., FeO, Fea0 4 and FeiOs) and an internal layer composed o f oxides of aluminum and silicon. increased. These scales became progressively thicker as the oxidizing temperature Further, the presence o f a fine distribution of stable molybdenum and

aluminum carbide precipitates was identified.

Conclusions

4. Acceptable oxidation resistance was exhibited by Alloys 3 (4.5S1-2.0A1) and 4 (4.5S13.0A1) at 1000°C; the a-ferrite to y-austenite phase transformation temperatures were 980 and 985°C. Alloy 2 (3.5S1-3.0A1) exhibited oxidation resistance up to 900°C and a phase transformation temperature of 950°C. Alloy 1 (3.5Si-2.0Al) exhibited oxidation

resistance up to 800°C and a phase transformation temperature of 870°C. Further, as the silicon and aluminum contents increased, the oxidation rate constant decreased (i.e., inereased resistance to oxidation). The pouring temperature and section thickness did not affect the oxidation kinetics of the alloys.

Alloy Recommendation
1. The results of this research suggest that the most promising alloy for high temperature applieations is Alloy 3 (4.5Si-2.0Al) poured at 1400°C. This alloy exhibited superior resistance to oxidation up to 1000°C and a high critical phase transformation temperature of 980°C. It provided a balance of good nodule morphology, limited number of defects and thin section (4mm) castability.

Suggestions for Future Study
On the basis o f current investigative work, the following suggestions have been made for fixture study: 1. Creep-rupture testing of alloys used in current study. 2. Diffraction study of the oxide scale formed in the current alloys using transmission electron microscopy, thus enabling proper characterization and identification, 3. Diffi"action studies and kinetic characterization of the molybdenum and aluminum carbide precipitates and their influence on ambient and high temperature properties. 4. Study of the growth kinetics of oxide nodules with a view to determining correlation between oxide nodule count and subsurface flaws.

5. Study o f the interaction of silicon and aluminum and its effect on enhancing graphite sphericity.

Furnace Temperature Distribution Results
In order to ensure efficiency of the oxidation tests, three furnaces were used (i.e., Furnaces A, B and C) with due consideration to suitability at the test temperature. The data compiled fi"om the tests are illustrated graphically for each furnace. The temperature

distribution within the furnaces did not change during the course of the experiment.

Tabulation and Statistical Analysis of Experimental Data
Experimental oxidation data obtained from tests at 700, 800, 900 and 1000°C after 500 hours on Alloy 1 (3.5Si-2.0Al), Alloy 2 (3.5S1-3.0A1), Alloy 3 (4.5Si-2.0Al) and Alloy 4 (4.5Si-3.0Al) was tabulated and statistically analyzed. Tests not repeated were not included in this analysis. The experimental data from the repeatability tests are presented in sections D1 to D4 in the following manner: (i) (ii) (iii) Tabulation of Experimental Data Mean, Standard Deviation, Standard Error and 95% and 99% Confidence Intervals Analysis o f Variance

(i)

Tabulation of Experimental Data
The weight loss and gain per square centimetre after each cycle was tabulated for

every specimen from Trial 1, 2 and 3. This data was organized in table format, as shown below:

Cycle Time (hrs) 0 1 2 4 24 48 96 212 500

Trial 1 (mg/cm^)

Trial 2 (mg/cm^)

Trial 3 (mg/cm^)

153

Appendix D (ii) Mean, Standard Deviation, Standard Error and 95% and 99% Confidence Intervals

The mean, standard deviation, standard error and the 95% and 99% confidence intervals were determined using SigmaPlot® software. The confidence intervals were determined using the /-statistic.

(iii)

Analysis of Variance
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for a single factor experiment was carried out to test

the statistical significance between measurements of the mean and variance of two or more different populations (i.e., cycle times). ANOVA was carried out for each oxidation cycle (e.g., 0-1 hrs, 1-2 hrs ...) and for the overall cycle from 0-500 hours. Testing of the statistical significance for each temperature was performed using Microsoft® Excel. The critical factors determined are shown in the table below [133]:
