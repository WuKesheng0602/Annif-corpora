A DEVELOPMENTAL STUDY OF 9 AND 12MONTHOLD INFANTS' LEARNING FROM TELEVISED VIDEO 

  Danielle Labine  Master of Arts, Psychology, Ryerson University, 2010   
ABSTRACT 

Although infants are exposed to relatively high levels of television the impact of this  exposure on learning in not completely known. Research has shown that infants learn  significantly less from a televised demonstration than they learn from a live demonstration. It  was hypothesized that providing 9 and 12monthold infants with active experience with the  task objects after a demonstration would increase learning from television. Overall, infants were  able to solve meansend tasks quite well and transfer the modeled solution across several test  trials with slightly different tasks. Surprisingly, the results showed that infants learned equally  well from the live and video demonstrations and did not show a video deficit effect. In addition,  no age differences were found. However, as expected, infants performed much better in the  active training conditions compared to the passive conditions. Findings are discussed in terms of  the perceptual impoverishment theory and the dual representation theory.

Television appears to be playing an increasingly prominent role in the lives of infants and  toddlers. We live in a digital age where young children are spending increasing amounts of time  in front of computer and television screens. With the recent explosion of videos and television  programming developed specifically for infants, it appears that very young children are exposed  to more television than ever before. Presumably this media is entertaining but the kind of  information or behaviors that these very young viewers acquire from watching them is not  completely known. The remainder of the chapter that follows critically reviews contemporary  literature concerning what infants can learn from video. Initial sections will discuss research on  very young children's exposure and attention to television in general, followed by an  examination of the methodologies used to assess learning from video. An additional focus of this  review centers on a consistent finding in this area of research described as the video deficit  effect (Anderson & Pempek, 2005), which researchers have recently found can be ameliorated  (i.e., Barr, Muentener, Garcia, Fujimoto, & Chavez, 2007; Barr, Muentener, & Garcia, 2007; The  review concludes with a summary and critique of the existing literature, followed by a discussion  of the specific research questions and hypotheses suggested by the review and examined in this  thesis.  Exposure to Television  It is estimated that the average household has a television set in use for about 6 hours per  day (Roberts & Foehr, 2003). While both the Canadian Pediatric Society (2003) and the American  Academy of Pediatrics (2001) have recommended restrictions on television exposure for  children under 2 years, the introduction of videos and TV programming created specifically for-- and directed to--babies such as the "Baby Einstein" series and TV programs such as 
1   

"Teletubbies" has substantially increased over the past decade.  According to recent research  conducted by Zimmerman, Christakis, and Meltzoff (2007), by 3 months of age, about 40% of  children regularly watch television, DVDs, or videos. By 24 months, this increases to 90%. Among  those who watch, the average viewing time is 1 hour per day for children younger than 12  months and more than 1.5 hours per day by 24 months. In short, these exposure numbers are  staggering.   Attention to Television  Importantly, there is evidence that very young children are not only exposed to increasing  amounts of television but that they also pay attention to the videos and series directed to them.  Attention to television is typically inferred from overt looking at the screen (Anderson &  Pempek, 2005), and using this criteria, it seems to be the case that infants are doing this. For  example, when infants 1215 months of age were shown videos aimed at babies, looking times  ranged from 48% to 74% suggesting a considerable amount of interest (Barr et al., 2003). In  addition, research on young children's attention to the popular television program "Teletubbies"  has shown greater levels of looking from 18 and 24month olds than those observed in previous  research looking at levels of looking from the same age group during the television show  "Sesame Street" which is made for a slightly older target audience (Frankenfield, Richards,  Lauricella, Pempek, Kirkorian, & Anderson, 2004). It appears that videos and TV programs that  are made for infants and toddlers can gain high levels of sustained attention.   Learning from Television   If young children are paying attention to these programs, the next logical question is  whether or not they are able to take this information and use it to act purposefully.  Several 

2   

lines of research are involved in answering this question and determining what young children  are able to learn from video. These include experiments conducted using imitation paradigms,  deferred imitation tasks, object search and object placement tasks. Overall, the results suggest  that infants are in fact able to learn from television from a very young age. It appears to be that  infants are able to imitate televised actions from 6 months of age (Barr et al., 2007b); at 12  months of age they are able to successfully exhibit deferred imitation (Barr et al., 2007b); and by  24 months, they are able to show some success with object placement and retrieval (Deocampo  & Hudson, 2005) although it is not mastered until 2.53 years of age (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002;  Troseth & DeLoache, 1998).  Imitation tasks. The earliest work on children's ability to learn from television focused on the  imitation of televised behavior. In the classic studies conducted by Bandura and his colleagues  (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963) 35 year old children were exposed to either live or televised  models demonstrating aggressive behavior toward an inflatable doll. When given the  opportunity to play with the same doll afterwards, children displayed similar aggressive behavior  regardless of the method of demonstration.                                    Aside from providing an ecologically valid measure of knowledge transfer (Barr et al., 2007a),   it has been argued that imitation paradigms like the one used by Bandura provide an ideal tool  for exploring what infants and toddlers learn from television because they do not rely on  language comprehension or production (McCall, Parke, & Kavanaugh, 1977). More recently,  researchers have continued to use this paradigm to assess the ability of younger children to  learn from televised demonstrations. In a typical experiment, the infant is presented with a  video demonstration of an experimenter engaging with an object. The demonstrated actions can 
3   

be either simple onestep actions, such as pulling apart an object (Meltzoff, 1988), or more  complicated multistep actions, such as removing a mitten from a puppet, shaking it and  removing a bell inside (Barr & Hayne, 1999).  Meltzoff (1988) reported that 14 month olds were able to imitate a onestep action with a  novel toy from a televised model when tested immediately after demonstration. Furthermore,  Klein, Hauf, and Aschersleben (2006) found that 12 month olds also exhibit immediate imitation  from a televised model. Until quite recently, it was believed that this was the earliest age infants  were able to learn from television demonstrations. However, by reducing the demands of the  task from imitation to simply observing and interpreting, researchers were able to show that  infants as young as 6 months of age are able to understand  televised actions (Hofer, Hauf, &  Aschersleben, 2007).  Compatible with these findings, Barr and her colleagues showed by  increasing video exposure to twice that of a live demonstration, 6monthold infants imitated  actions from the televised demonstration (Barr et al., 2007b).  Deferred imitation tasks. Although seemingly compelling at first glance, the fact that an  infant imitates a modeled action does not allow us to know for sure that the behavior and  resulting effects have been learned from observation. This demonstration of behavior could  simply be "mimicking" without true understanding or learning--a key debate that has been  engaged in the developmental literature (c.f., Huang, Heyes, & Charman, 2002; Provasi, Dubon,  & Bloch, 2001; Tomasello, 1999; Want & Harris, 2002). In an attempt to alleviate this possible  explanation and determine the robustness of the imitation findings, researchers have often  opted for deferred rather than immediate imitation tests (Barr et al., 2007b). In order to imitate  from video successfully, the participant must pay attention to what is being displayed, encode 
4   

and form a representation of what is being observed including the object and target actions, and  the representations must be reproduced at some later point (Barr et al., 2007a). However, when  a delay interval is introduced and the representation is not used immediately but rather must be  retained for an extended period of time, the attentional requirements--or cognitive load-- imposed by this demand is considerably greater than immediately recalling the action to be  used. It is for this reason that researchers argue that deferred imitation is a more complex  representational task (Barr & Hayne, 2000).  Even using this more cognitively demanding task,  researchers have consistently reported that infants as young as 12  18 months of age show  deferred imitation from televised  demonstrations after a 24hour delay (Meltzoff, 1988; Barr &  Hayne, 1999;  Barr et al., 2007a; Barr et al., 2007b).    Object search tasks. The research described above shows that infants are absolutely able to  use video images of real events to guide their own behavior in an imitative manner both  immediately and after a delay. As an extension of these findings, research conducted with older  infants typically tests whether they are able to guide their own object search behavior based on  information gained from video. In a typical object retrieval experiment, a toddler would be  shown video of a model hiding a toy in an adjoining room and they would be encouraged to go  into the room to find the toy where the model had hidden it (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002).  Alternatively, there are two variations of this object retrieval task. The first version, an object  placement task, involves having the participant watch as a toy is placed in another room and  then asking them to put the toy in the same place (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002). This task is  believed to be easier than the traditional object retrieval paradigm because the toddler is simply  required to imitate the model's actions as opposed to actually having to generate search 
5   

behavior (Schmitt & Andersen, 2002). Similarly, a second variation of this task involves having  the participant watch the model find a toy in the next room before they are given an  opportunity to go into the room and find the toy themselves. In essence, the child is required to  imitate the act of finding a toy (Deocampo & Hudson, 2005), which should also be less  cognitively demanding.   Research has consistently shown that 24monthold infants have great difficulty with the  object retrieval tasks (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002). Interestingly, however, their performance on  the first trial is substantially better than on later search trials. That is, performance starts above  chance and then deteriorates over trials (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002). Researchers have  suggested that this indicates that they are able to absorb at least some information presented to  them from the initial video images (Anderson & Pempek, 2005). The developmental reports  describing the actual age that toddlers achieve competence with these tasks seems to be  somewhat conflicting. Troseth and DeLoache (1998) found that 30monthold infants did well  with video in their study; however, Schmitt and Anderson (2002) reported that 30 month olds  were only able to perform at an intermediary level. The researchers in this latter study argued  that although 30monthold infants performed better than 24 month olds, it is not until 36  months of age that they are able to perform well. Therefore, as a compromise stance, the age at  which infants are proficient with object search tasks appears to be occur between 30 and 36  months of age, depending on small methodological or task differences. This suggests that it is  around this age that infants are able to understand that representational media, such as video  images, can refer to object and events in real life and can use this information to guide their  behavior (Deocampo & Hudson, 2005). 
6   

Video Deficit Effect  Even after toddlers are able to use video images to appropriately guide their behavior during  object retrieval tasks, their performance is still worse than toddlers who saw the event in a more  naturalistic way (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002). This finding is typically referred to as the video  deficit effect (Anderson & Pempek, 2005) and is not task specific; a similar pattern is shown with  imitation tasks. Even after infants begin to learn and imitate actions from televised  demonstrations, their performance is almost always inferior compared to live demonstrations  suggesting that very young children learn less from television than real events (Barr & Hayne,  1999). These findings are remarkably consistent in indicating a video deficit for infants 30  months and younger.   Working backwards, findings revealed that 36monthold infants imitate a video model as  frequently as a live model (McCall et al., 1977). Consistent with this finding, Schmitt and  Anderson (2002) found that it was not until 36 months of age that infants perform equally well  on object search tasks involving watching a hiding event on television compared to through a  window. This study also revealed that around 30 months of age infants begin to show signs of  the video deficit effect. The 30monthold infants, although better than the 24 month olds, had  difficulty and were significantly poorer at finding the toy compared to those in the window  condition. By 24 months, their performance in the televised condition was much diminished in  comparison to the window condition (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002). Similarly, Troseth and  DeLoache (1998) reported that 24 month olds, but not 30 month olds, were substantially less  likely to find a hidden toy following a televised hiding event than after seeing the event through  a window. A similar pattern is also revealed with the object placement tasks (Schmitt & 
7   

Anderson, 2002). Taken together, the results suggest that for object placement and search tasks  at least, the video deficit effect occurs around the age of 24 months and persists until  approximately 3036 months.  In terms of imitation tasks, Barr and Hayne (1999) reported that 12 to 18monthold infants  were able to imitate action sequences from a live model after a 24 hour delay yet only 18 month  olds were able to imitate the same action sequence demonstrated by a televised model.   Furthermore, the 12 and 15 month olds were able to imitate the actions immediately after the  video demonstration but their performance suggested a video deficit effect compared to the live  demonstration. When the imitation procedure is used with older infants, the imitations were  still poorer when based on video demonstrations in both 24 and 30monthold infants (Hayne,  Herbert, & Simcock, 2003). Interestingly, the youngest infants demonstrating an ability to learn  from video (6 months of age) do not show the deficit effect and are able to learn equally well  from video and live demonstrations (Barr et al., 2007b). Thus, it seems to be that infants'  inability to use televised information as efficiently as live information develops at some point  between 6 and 12 months of age and continues until 30 months of age.  Possible explanations. There have been many attempts by researchers to explain this video  deficit effect. For instance, it has been suggested that infants simply have problems perceiving  and interpreting actions shown on video (Hofer et al., 2007). It has also been suggested that if  infants are in fact able to interpret the actions and the problem may lie in their ability to  demonstrate their knowledge. That is, the video deficit may be due to the lack of an appropriate  task rather than the infants' inability to imitate from television per se (Barr et al., 2007a).  Another explanation may be that infants find it more difficult to generalize from a video display 
8   

than from a real object due to the lack of perceptual cues (Barr & Hayne, 1999). In line with this  argument, Schmitt and Anderson (2002) have suggested that representations derived from  videos are weaker than those derived from live demonstrations. It may also be that the  participant's attention is less focused during the video demonstration compared to the live  demonstration (Barr & Hayne, 1999). Although each of these explanations has received at least  some minimal support in the literature, researchers are mostly only speculating about the  possible underlying reasons (Hofer et al., 2007). On the other hand, with much support, the two  most widely accepted theories to explain the video deficit effect are the perceptual  impoverishment theory and the dual representation theory.            Perceptual impoverishment theory. The perceptual impoverishment theory suggests that  the video deficit effect is a direct result of poor perceptual encoding at the time of  demonstration (Barr & Hayne, 1999; Schmitt & Anderson, 2002). More specifically, the 3D  representation of the object and actions are degraded by looking at a televised image. That is,  the cues that would normally be available when looking at the object and actions in a reallife 3D  context, such as depth cues, texture, motion, and shadow gradients, are limited or poorly  resolved on the 2D screen. Johnson (1997) argues that in order to properly encode object  information and create an accurate representation, a minimum amount of this perceptual  information is required. Furthermore, it has been suggested that younger infants require more  of this information than older infants (Johnson, 1997). Researchers have suggested that because  of the lack of necessary perceptual information, much more of the infant's limited cognitive  resources must be used in order to identify objects, interpret the actions and perceive the 2D or  3D nature of the display (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002). As a result, there are fewer resources 
9   

available to devote to attending to the relevant task details and encoding these details.  Importantly, if initial encoding is compromised, it is likely that retrieval will be as well which is  why we see such poor performance (Barr et al., 2007b).   According to Barr et al. (2007b) three lines of research provide support for the perceptual  impoverishment theory. The first important finding is that video deficit effect disappears as  infants get older. Johnson (1997) argued that younger infants require more perceptual  information than older infants to create an object representation. A key component of the video  deficit effect is that the infants need more information than what is available to them from the  2D stimuli. However, as infants get older, they require less of this information and are able to  form representations from the 2D stimuli, despite the lack of perceptual information. The  reduction of the video deficit effect over time is a fairly consistent finding. For example, Schmitt  and Anderson (2002) compared infant performance on an object search task after being shown a  televised hiding event in an adjacent room  or watching the event though a window. The  performance of 24monthold infants in the televised condition was very poor in comparison to  those in the window condition. By 30 months of age, infants improved considerably and by 36  months there was no evidence of a video deficit. However, other research conducted with  younger infants found that 6 month olds were able to learn equally well from a live  demonstration and a televised demonstration (Barr et al., 2007a). The fact that there is no video  deficit found in infants of such a young age is surprising based on Johnson's (1997) argument.  A second line of research providing support for the perceptual impoverishment theory has  used eventrelated potentials to demonstrate that infants actually process 2D and 3D images at  different rates (Carver, Meltzoff, & Dawson, 2006). It seems to be that 18monthold infants 
10   

process 2D images more slowly than they process 3D objects. The infants in this study were  presented with 3D toys or 2D pictures of toys and it was found that were able to recognize a  familiar 3D object very early in the attention process but recognized a 2D picture of a familiar  toy significantly later.  Taking this finding into account, researchers attempted to reduce the video deficit effect by  increasing exposure to target information by repeatedly showing the action sequence  demonstrations (Barr et al., 2007a; Barr et al., 2007b). Since 2D information takes longer to  process than 3D, providing infants with more time to process the 2D information should enable  them to create stronger representations and use these representations to perform at the same  level as infants provide with 3D information. This is precisely what was found. The video deficit  was ameliorated by increasing the duration of exposure to the video demonstrations (Barr et al.,  2007a; Barr et al., 2007b).  Dual representation theory. The second major theory used to explain the video deficit effect  is the dual representation theory (Troseth & DeLoache, 1998). Dual representation requires that  the young child understand both the abstract and concrete natures of a symbolic or  representational medium. More specifically,  a symbol is concrete in that it is an object in its  own right but is also abstract in that it can be used to convey information about something else  (DeLoache, Pierroutsakos, & Troseth, 1996). To demonstrate dual representational  understanding within a particular medium, a viewer must be able to represent both the abstract  and concrete aspects as well as understand the relationship between the two (DeLoache,  Pierroutsakos, & Troseth, 1996). As an example, in the object search paradigm toddlers are  shown an experimenter hiding a toy either on a television screen or through a window. If the 
11   

children are successful in retrieving the toy in both conditions, then they are presumably able to  understand the representational nature of television. In other words, they understand that what  they see on television can be used to provide information about current circumstances in real  life rather than within the television set itself (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002).  Very young infants and toddlers often do not understand the abstractconcrete distinction  and therefore do not appreciate or are not sensitive to the difference between an object  displayed on a television screen and the real object it represents (Barr et al., 2007b). Therefore,  young infants do not exhibit a video deficit effect because they pay no attention to the  differences between 2D and 3D stimuli and represent them in the same way (Barr et al., 2007b).  On the other hand, as infants get a little bit older, they understand the difference between the  2D and 3D objects but find it difficult to make sense of the relationship connecting them (Barr et  al., 2007b). Therefore, they fail to apply information presented to them on video to guide their  actions in real life and the video deficit begins to develop (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002; Troseth &  DeLoache, 1998). Finally, dual representation is achieved as children come to understand the  representational relationship that can exist between video and reality and the differences  between the two (Troseth & DeLoache, 1998). In addition, the video deficit diminishes as they  come to understand that video information can be used to guide their actions in the real world  (Barr et al., 2007b). However, research shows that this does not appear to be case until around  2.5 to 3 years of age (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002; Troseth & DeLoache, 1998).   Aside from object search studies, results from recent imitation studies also appear to provide  support for the dual representation theory. Researchers found that 6 month old infants were  able to imitate a televised action sequence and importantly, showed no evidence of a video 
12   

deficit effect which suggests that they treated the 2D video demonstration and the 3D live  demonstration similarly (Barr et al., 2007b). Additional support for this theory stems from  research demonstrating the development of symbolic understanding. For example, 9monthold  infants do not appear to recognize the difference between real objects and those presented on a  television screen (Pierroutsakos & Troseth, 2003). The researchers found that these young  infants attempted to manually explore and interact with televised objects in the same way they  would with real objects. However, by 19 months of age, the infants seemed to believe that the  objects on the screen were not real and therefore simply pointed at the screen rather than  attempting to explore or interact with them.   Additional support for the dual representation theory stems from recent research conducted  by Diener, Pierroutsakos, Troseth, and Roberts (2008). In this study, a variety of objects used to  elicit different emotions (i.e., a scary mask to elicit fear) were shown to infants through either a  live or on a video presentation one after the other.  Using a repeatedmeasures design, the  researchers found that the infants' affective reactions were consistent across both  demonstration types.   Reducing the video deficit effect. With a better understanding of the potential explanations  for the video deficit, attempts to reduce the effect have been implemented for both imitation  and object search paradigms. Many of the explanations and resulting methodologies have  incorporated the idea of a "tradeoff" between the systems of action and cognition. The  cognitionactiontradeoff hypothesis (Boudreau & Bushnell, 2000), which suggests that the  cognitive and motor demands of a task are continually competing for the infant's limited  processing resources, may be invoked in the current discussion.  Thus, when the required task 
13   

demands are not balanced and fall heavily in one direction or the other, a decrease in  performance for the other system is often the result. For example, if the cognitive demands of a  task are increased, motor performance is greatly reduced; however, if the cognitive demands  are decreased, we will likely see an increase in performance. With respect to learning from  television and reducing the video deficit effect, this hypothesis seems to be a common theme  throughout the literature. Thus far, the results have yielded mixed findings.  Many researchers have tried to reduce the demands of the imitation or object search task to  increase performance with some success. In one study, Barr and Hayne (1999) found that  removing the delay from a deferred imitation paradigm and testing 15monthold infants  immediately after a video demonstration did not improve performance. However, when they  removed the delay and demonstrated an easier task, not only were the 15 month olds able to  imitate the target actions, but they learned equally well from both live and video  demonstrations.  In an experiment conducted by Schmidt, Crawley and Anderson (2007), they attempted to  reduce the demands of object search tasks in two experiments. In the first, the search space was  no longer an adjacent 3D room but a 2D felt board. However, this change did not improve  performance and the toddlers still displayed a video deficit effect. In a second experiment, the  researchers simply told the children where the toy was hidden instead of having them watch a  hiding event through a video or on a screen. Unfortunately, this change did not improve  performance either. If a real person told the children where the toy was hidden they successfully  retrieved it but if the same person told them where the toy was hidden via closedcircuit  television, they were not able to retrieve it.   
14   

Other developmental scholars have made an attempt to reduce the demands of the object  search tasks in another way. That is, rather than have children watch a hiding event and then  have them go into the adjacent room and retrieve the object, Schmitt and Anderson (2002) gave  the children the same toy as they had seen during the hiding event and asked them to return it  to where it should go. Presumably, this task is easier to complete because the child is simply  imitating the actions of the experimenter rather than actually generating search behavior for  themselves.  Although the difference between the television and window conditions was  reduced, the children still performed more poorly if they saw the toy placement on television  rather than looking through a window.   In a similar modification, Deocampo and Hudson (2005) had children watch an experimenter  find a toy as opposed to hiding a toy. In the test condition, children were asked to find the toy  the same way the experimenter did. Again, the children were simply imitating the  experimenter's behavior rather than having to generate their own behavior which should make  the task easier. Quite unexpectedly, children performed much worse on this condition than in  the standard object retrieval task. The researchers argued that this finding may have resulted  because it is counterintuitive to find an object that has already been found. With this in mind,  the researchers created a condition whereby multiple toys were hidden in each hiding location  to eliminate the problem of finding a found toy but 24 month olds did not perform well in this  condition either. Modifying the retrieval task by making it a necessary part of a goal based  activity (i.e., a banana must be found in order to feed a toy dog) also did not help the toddlers.  However, this goalbased approach did help with the imitation manipulation. Basically, in order  to help 24 month olds achieve even a moderate level of success, very specific conditions are 
15   

necessary. In this case, an easier imitation task as opposed to a retrieval task and it must include  a goalbased activity.     In another clever manipulation, Troseth and DeLoache (1998) were interested in what would  happen if children did not realize that they were watching a video. The researchers convinced  the children that they were looking through a window when they were in fact watching a video.  More than half of the children who were actually watching video but were told they were  looking through a window performed perfectly  just like children who observed hiding events  through a window. Although the mean level of performance in the video window condition was  no closer to that of the real window condition, this group significantly outperformed the  standard video group.  On the other hand, there have been some findings that would suggest it is perhaps better to  increase the cognitive demands. For example, Barr and Hayne (1999) found that creating a more  complex video presentation that more closely resembles real television viewing improved task  performance for 15 and 18 month olds. Surprisingly, by increasing the amount of information  that the infant can pay attention to--and thereby drastically increasing the cognitive demands-- performance is improved. Yet, using only close up shots during demonstrations did not improve  performance. Notwithstanding, it may be that this finding may not be related to the action cognition tradeoff hypothesis per se. Rather, it may simply be that providing more realistic  context for infants to learn from television is what is important. After all, with the artificial  contexts of the imitation and object search paradigms, there is no doubt that learning from a  televised model is limited in comparison to learning from a live model.  

16   

Overall, it seems to be that while reducing task demands by actually changing the nature of  the task is somewhat beneficial for younger children, the video deficit effect becomes more and  more difficult to reduce in this way as they get older. However, the research described in the  next two sections discusses how reducing the task demands through repetition and experience  are able to decrease the video deficit effect with considerably more success.   Benefit of repetition. Recent studies have consistently shown that not only does repetition  enhance learning from television, but the additional exposure also seems to ameliorate the  video deficit effect (Barr et al., 2007b). For example, Barr and Hayne (1999) initially reported  that 12, 15, and 18monthold infants were able to imitate a live model after a 24 hour delay  but only 18 month olds were able to do this following a televised demonstration. In addition,  even though they were able to imitate, their performance level was considerably lower than the  infants who viewed a live demonstration. The researchers also reported that a similar pattern  was found when imitation levels were assessed immediately after the demonstration. That is, 12  and 15 month olds were still not able to imitate the televised actions. Using an easier task, 15  month olds were able to imitate both live and televised actions (Barr & Hayne, 1999) and when  the amount of exposure to the target actions on video was doubled from 3 demonstrations to 6  demonstrations, there was considerable improvement (Barr et al., 2007a). Expanding on this  research, Barr et al. (2007b) were interested in whether or not a video deficit was evident  following these additional demonstrations. It was found that increasing the number of  presentations enhanced the 12 month olds' imitation performance from video in comparison to  the live demonstration group but both the 15 and 18 month old groups continued to show the  deficit. In a second experiment, the researchers quadrupled the number of presentations shown 
17   

to the 15 month old group in either a single session with 12 demonstrations or 2 sessions with  six demonstrations each shown over two days. It was reported that infants in the 2 session  group performed considerably better than chance and did not exhibit a video deficit whereas  infants in the single session group did not.   Interestingly, the researchers also showed that very young infants are able to imitate  televised actions with sufficient repetition. It was previously believed that the youngest that  infants were able use televised information to guide their own actions was 12 months of age  (Klein et al., 2006). However, when Barr et al. (2007b) presented 6monthold infants with 6  action demonstrations they were able to imitate the televised actions after a 24 hour delay and  showed no evidence of a video deficit.     Benefit of experience. As is the case for most learning that infants engage in, experience  plays a central role and this may also be the case for learning from television.  It may be that  when infants demonstrate poorer performance using televised information in comparison to live  information, this is simply the result of inexperience rather than an inability to learn from  television.  Several researchers argue that this might be the case. For example, Troseth and  DeLoache (1998) found that giving children experience with the object retrieval task in a  representational medium for which they already have dual representation understanding allows  them to perform better with a more difficult medium later on. Similarly, Deocampo and Hudson  (2005) reported that toddlers transferred success from an imitation object search task to a more  complicated object retrieval task. In addition, young children also seem to benefit from  experience extracting information from television in general. Troseth (2003) allowed children to  view themselves live and on prerecorded video at home for 2 weeks. After the extensive 
18   

experience using television in a novel way that highlighted the informational function, children's  performance on object retrieval tasks improved.     However, some results suggest that in order to beneficial, this experience must be in the  same domain for which the children already have at least some representational understanding.  Research has shown that young children cannot be taught to perform the object retrieval task  using a representational medium for which they have not yet achieved dual representational  competence (Troseth & DeLoache, 1998). In addition, using several methods, researchers have  been unable to show 24monthold toddlers the connection between a representation and its  reallife match. These results have been shown using photos as the representational medium  (DeLoache & Burns, 1994) as well as video images (Troseth, 2003; Troseth & DeLoache, 1998). In  each case, these "withinmedium" attempts were unsuccessful. Nonetheless, as described  above, a "betweenmedium" benefit seems to exist.   Summary of Literature  Overall, the collective of scholarship reported above suggests that infants are able to use  televised information to guide their behavior from a very early age. Moreover, infants are able  to imitate actions demonstrated by a televised model from approximately 6 months of age (Barr  et al., 2007b). Furthermore, this ability continues to develop and by 12 months infants are able  to demonstrate learning through a more cognitively demanding deferred imitation task (Barr et  al., 2007a).    Notwithstanding the above, it is also around this time that infants begin to demonstrate a  video deficit effect suggesting that they are able to learn less from television than from  equivalent reallife experiences (Anderson & Pempek, 2005), although before this age they seem 
19   

to learn equally well from both mediums (Barr et al., 2007b), an effect that is also shown in  object retrieval studies. For example, if 24 month olds were shown a hiding event through a  window, they correctly retrieved the toy but if they saw the hiding event on a video screen their  performance was very poor (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002). The results from both imitation studies  and object search tasks show that this deficit remains intact until approximately 3 years of age  (Schmitt & Anderson, 2002).    The two major theories that are used to explain this phenomenon are the perceptual  impoverishment theory and the dual representation theory. The first argues that learning from  video is impaired due to problems encoding 2D input and forming an accurate representation as  compared to a real 3D presentation (Barr et al., 2007b). On the other hand, the dual  representation theory suggests that the video deficit occurs when toddlers begin to understand  that there are differences between 2D objects presented on a video and 3D objects in real life  yet are unable to fully grasp the relationship between the two resulting in a failure to apply  information presented to their actions (Troseth & DeLoache, 1998; Barr et al., 2007b). Taken  together, these two theories are not mutually exclusive and there has been compelling scientific  support for both in the previous literature cited.  Heavily guided by these possible explanations, attempts to reduce the video deficit effect  have yielded mixed results for both imitation and object search tasks. However, the most  successful attempts at reducing the deficit have involved additional exposure to the necessary  information through repetition and experience.   Although questions surrounding this area of research have come a long way in a very short  amount of time, there are several questions that remain to be answered. First, given that infants 
20   

do not use televised information as efficiently as real information to guide their behavior, how  do young children view television in relation to the real world? If very young infants do not  exhibit the video deficit effect in the way that older infants do, what can be inferred about how  they understand representational media? Researchers have consistently suggested that the  ability to learn from television is likely constrained by both perceptual factors and general  cognitive development (Troseth & DeLoache, 1998).  What is the relative contribution of each of  these factors?  Second, for most of the experiments described in the proceeding sections where  comparisons between live and video demonstrations are designed, an effort is made to ensure  that the similarities between the two conditions are as high as possible. This approach, however,  typically creates a somewhat artificial learning context. Still, Barr and Hayne (1999) found that  by applying standard techniques of video production (editing, zoom shots, and sound effects) to  the demonstrations, performance improves. This begs the question of whether or not the  findings from this research have any direct relevance for infants' and toddlers' understanding of  and learning from professionally produced television programs.    Third, are younger infants able to use televised information presented to them to guide  behavior for more cognitively demanding tasks than imitation (i.e., problem solving)?   Fourth, findings reported by Barr et al. (2007a, 2007b) revealed that the video deficit effect  was absent in research conducted with 6 month olds but evident in the 12 month age group.  That is, 6 months olds are able to learn equally well from live and video demonstrations but 12  month olds imitate significantly less target actions after following a video demonstration 

21   

compared to a live demonstration. At what age specifically do infants begin to have trouble  learning from video and display the video deficit effect?  Finally, additional exposure to televised material through repetition seems to improve  performance and ameliorate the video deficit effect with younger infants (Barr et al., 2007a;  Barr et al., 2007b). Are there other ways to reduce this effect? For instance, research with  toddlers has shown that with increased experience either through repeated practice with a  particular search task or more exposure to using television as an informational medium,  performance improves (Troseth, 2003). Is it possible that experience would also have an impact  on the performance of younger infants?  Purpose of Proposed Study  Inspired by the literature and guided by the questions described above, the current study  seeks to extend previous developmental science in this area and contribute to the core question  concerning what young infants can learn from video. It is hoped that this study will add to the  current literature in a variety of ways: first, by determining the robustness and generality of the  findings from imitation tasks; second, by providing support for the perceptual impoverishment  or dual representation theories; and lastly, to investigate whether other forms of exposure,  aside from repetition, can ameliorate this effect in younger infants.  It seems to be generally well established that very young infants are able to use televised  information to guide their actions in a variety of ways. It has been reported that infants can  duplicate televised actions in an imitative manner at 6 months of age (Barr et al., 2007b). By 12  months they are able to remember and use televised information to reproduce actions 24 hours  later (Barr et al., 2007b). Imitation is generally considered to be a lower level form of learning 
22   

and in order to develop a complete picture of what infants are able to learn from television, we  must also consider higher forms. The question to be addressed in the proposed study is whether  infants are able to use televised information to solve a more cognitively demanding analogical  reasoning task using televised information. In addition to be being more cognitively demanding,  this task requires that the infant apply the presented information to a novel situation, a  potentially much higher form of learning. Previous research conducted by Chen, Sanchez, and  Campbell (1997) determined that infants were able to do this effectively by 12 months of age.  The methodology used for this study is similar to that used by Chen et al. (1997) with several  important modifications (see methods section for details).   The findings from this research also have the potential to provide support for one or both of  the two major theories explaining children's ability to learn from video. First, if the older age  group outperforms the younger age group, this would be in line with the perceptual  impoverishment theory. This theory asserts that younger infants require more information to  properly encode information and develop a complete representation (Johnson, 1997).  On the  other hand, should the younger age group perform better than the older age group, these  findings would support the dual representation theory since this theory argues that younger  infants have less developed symbolic understanding and therefore do not recognize the  difference between the 2D video image and 3D test object (Troseth & DeLoache, 1998).  Lastly, the results from the proposed research will likely be able to provide some insight into  the role of experience in infants' ability to learn from television. Research conducted with older  infants has revealed that they greatly benefit from having experience and that performance  improves both with additional exposure to a specific task (Troseth & DeLoache, 1998; Deocampo 
23   

& Hudson, 2005) as well as more practice using television as an informational medium in general  (Troseth, 2003). Similar to giving infants task specific experience (Troseth & DeLoache, 1998), a  unique component of the proposed study entails having the infants be actively involved in their  initial training session during one condition. During the session, the infant will be encouraged to  interact with the objects on their own after the initial demonstration. The question is whether  providing the infant with active experience during training will facilitate their understanding of  the information presented to them and thereby enhance problem solving ability.   As findings from research with older infants suggests that increased exposure through  experience is beneficial for object search performance, findings from research conducted with  younger children suggest that additional exposure to target information by increasing the  number of demonstrations also improves performance (Barr et al., 2007a; Barr et al., 2007b). It  was suggested that because 2D stimuli takes longer for infants to process than 3D stimuli, giving  infants extra time to process the stimuli in its entirety may enhance encoding and retrieval of 2D  attributes (Barr et al., 2007b). Perhaps we can also apply this logic to experience. For example, it  may be that active experience also improves encoding and retrieval. Researchers have suggested  that the video deficit may stem from either the slow processing of 2D information or the  cognitive load (attentional demands) associated with the transfer from 2D to 3D (Barr et al.,  2007a). The repetition studies seem to have tackled the first issue relating to slower processing.  As for the second cognitive load possibility, it may be that having extra experience reduces the  cognitive load therefore making the transfer easier. The effect of the degraded perceptual cues  offered by the television screen may be minimized when infants are given previous exposure to  objects in real life. With the cognitive load reduced, it is likely that an increase in performance, 
24   

consistent with findings for meansend problem solving (e.g., Boudreau & Bushnell, 2000;  Needhan, 2000), will be revealed.    Although the benefit of experience finding with older infants is compelling, the question of  whether or not younger infants will benefit in the same way has not yet been explored.  However, research from other areas suggests that they may benefit as well. For example, after  having the opportunity to play with an object, 7 to 11month olds were shown two videos  simultaneously presenting adults who were either acting on the same object or a different one.  It was reported that 9 to 11month old infants preferred to watch the video of the adult  interacting with the object they had played with (Hauf, Aschersleben, & Prinz, 2007).  Furthermore, follow up studies showed that it was interest in the actions with objects  specifically that the agentive experience enhanced rather than simply watching objects or  people per se. In addition, research conducted by Sommerville, Hildebrand, and Crane (2008)  found  that active training and practice facilitated 10 month old infants' ability to identify the  goal of a tooluse event. Importantly, the researchers suggest that active experience using tools  may help infants to build motor representations which subsequently guide their perception and  support action understanding.  Taken together, these studies suggest that active experience effects both perceptions and  understanding of what happens around them. However, in each of the studies described, infants  were only required to observe and interpret. It is still unknown whether the benefit will still exist  if a more demanding task is required.      
25   

Hypotheses  The primary goal of this study is to determine whether or not infants are able to solve a multi step task using televised (video) information and whether this is a function of age. Given that  infants are able to imitate actions from televised information very early on (Barr et al., 2007b),  and by 10 to 13months of age they are able to solve analogical problems (Chen et al., 1997), it  is expected that infants should be able to solve these types of problems using televised  information as well.  It is hypothesized that an improvement in performance over trials will  result.   Furthermore, it is predicted that younger infants will be more successful in using televised  information because they do not understand the difference between a symbol on a television  screen and a reallife object and therefore do not treat them differently. Older infants, on the  other hand, are beginning to develop dual representational understanding and will likely find it  more difficult to apply televised information to a real object.   In addition to whether infants are able to apply knowledge learned during pretest training to  analogous problems during the test sessions, it hypothesized that type of training will be  significantly different than another (i.e., liveactive, livepassive or video training). That is, it is  predicted that infants will display the most success in retrieving the toy in the active training  condition given that this type of training should facilitate understanding (Sommerville et al.,  2008).        
26   

Method  Participants   Participants were recruited from a variety of locations in the Toronto area. Brief  presentations were given to parents during infant programs (i.e., library reading times)  describing current lab projects and infant research in general. Interested parents provided their  contact information and their infant's date of birth. This information was added to an ongoing  database. Eligible participants for this study were identified and were telephoned, given more  details about this particular study and asked to participate.  A total of 37 infants participated in  this study. However, 5 infants were excluded from the analyses due to interference from the  parent (n = 1), excessive fussiness (n = 2) or experimenter error   (n = 2). In addition, 48 of 224  available trials were excluded because of lack of attention to the demonstration (n = 33) or  equipment failure (n = 15). The rest of the data for these infants was included.   Thus, 32 infants were included in the final sample: 19 twelvemonth olds (M = 11 months, 25  days; range = 11 months, 3 days to 13 months, 4 days; 11 male and 8 female infants) and 13 ten month olds (M = 10 months, 1 days; range = 9 months, 15 days to 10 months, 30 days; 4 male  and 9 female infants). These particular age groups were selected for several reasons. First, by  using two age groups we may learn more about the developmental trajectory of analogical  problem solving using televised information. Second, it has been established that 6 month olds  do not demonstrate a video deficit when learning from video but the deficit is evident in  research with 12 month olds (Barr et al., 2007b). However, what happens between the ages of  612 months is still unknown. Third, research has demonstrated that it is possible to ameliorate  the video deficit with 12 month olds (Barr et al., 2007b). This is important given that one of the 
27   

main research questions is whether or not action experience can reduce the deficit effect.   Fourth, research has shown that infants start to benefit from active experience between the  ages of 9 to 11 months (Hauf et al., 2007; Sommerville et al., 2008). All infants were healthy and  fullterm and born within 2 weeks of their expected due date.   Task Descriptions  The tasks used for this study involved solving a series of three similar problems. Each  problem involved combining two subgoals to reach an interesting toy. The methodology is  similar to that used by Chen, Sanchez, and Campbell (1997) with several important  modifications. In the original study, Chen et al. (1997) required infants to solve a series of  problems. Infants saw two pieces of cloth, each of which had a string resting on it; a toy was  attached to one string but not the other. To obtain the toy, the infant had to pull the target  cloth, and then pull the target string to bring the toy within reach. The researchers also created  multiple versions of the task to assess infants' learning and analogical reasoning skills. In all of  them, the problems shared a common solution (all required pulling the target cloth and then the  target string), and the arrangement of objects was similar across each trial. However, the  problems differed in their surface characteristics. That is, the materials and colors of the strings  and cloths, the side on which the target tools were located, and the goal toys were all different  for each problem. In addition, the immediate contexts of the problems (the colors, height,  shapes, and locations of the tables within the room) and the infants' posture when attempting  to solve the problem (sitting on the floor, standing with parent support, or sitting on the  parent's lap) were also changed. For the present study, the tasks differed from Chen et al.  (1997)'s in the following ways: 
28   

1. Some of the materials used for each problem were slightly more distinctive. For the problems  used by Chen et al. (1997), both elements of the problem were relatively similar (i.e., two brown  cords and two white cloths with yellow and orange stripes for problem A; two white braided  yarn strings and two tan cloths for problem B; two black braided yarn strings and two light blue  cloths for problem C). For this study, the cloths, the first part of the task, were identical to those  used by Chen et al. (1997). That is, the cloths were different colours and different sizes for each  test. However, the second part of the task, the pulling object, had different properties for each  test. For example, the pulling objects were approximately the same length but were made of  rope for one test, ribbon for another, a hollow plastic tube for another, and a light plastic chain  for another.  The experimental argument for the above modification is that altering one element  of the problem in a more distinctive way might require that the infants make more of an analogy  between the problems in this case (compared to the analogy being made in the problems used  in the Chen et al. study).   2. In the Chen et al (1997) study, the "training" for each infant was very similar (i.e., each infant  was given the target toy and other items to examine while the experimenter set up the test. The  infant was then encouraged to solve the problem on their own. If they were unable to do so, the  parent was asked to demonstrate the sequence two times and the infant participant was then  encouraged to imitate the actions). However, for the infants who saw the actions and imitated  them, we don't know if the improvement in performance was due to simply watching the  solution or acting it out themselves. For this study, two separate training conditions were used,  a livepassive training condition, and a liveactive training condition were used to try to isolate  the relative contributions of active and passive training. In addition, two video training 
29   

conditions were also included to test whether or not infants are able to use televised  information to solve these types of problems (full descriptions follow below).  Design and Stimuli  As originally intended, infants would be required to complete all four training conditions         (liveactive, livepassive, videoactive, and videopassive) in order to assess withinsubjects  differences. However, to avoid potential training effects across conditions, three new tasks had  to be developed in addition to the original task used by Chen et al. (1997).  The second task  involved pushing a long handle to bring a box within reach and opening the box to retrieve a  goal toy. The third task required the infant to remove a barrier and press a button to activate a  rotating belt to bring a toy within reach. Finally, a fourth task required the infant to slide open a  small door and slide a button from left to right. Sliding the button released a small ledge holding  a toy in place and when released the toy slide down a ramp within reach of the infant. However,  after pilot testing (see section below) it was decided that only the first three tasks would be used  (see Figure 1 for images and Appendix C for detailed descriptions of each task version).

Figure 1. The stimuli used for the study.   Pilot Testing  Extensive pilot testing was conducted to ensure the level of difficulty of the new target  actions was approximately the same across tasks, to determine a suitable length for the test  trials and demonstrations, and also to determine an appropriate number of trials. This pilot  testing revealed that infants seemed equally interested in all tasks but the fourth task seemed to  be slightly more difficult. It was also determined that three trials seemed to be sufficient as 
31   

infants tended to become disinterested in the task with additional trials. As for the trials  themselves, a duration of 100 seconds was found to be the most appropriate length. This time  frame provided the infant ample time to solve the problem and longer durations also tended to  lead to decreased interest. This trial length was approximately equal to that selected by Chen et  al. (1997) and Barr et al. (2007b). Given the complexity of tasks and experimental procedure,  pilot testing was also critical for establishing procedural timing parameters and experimenter  coordination practice (this study required two experimenters).  Revised Design  Given that the cumulative amount of time that was allocated for the demonstrations and  test trials was sufficiently long, piloting was also used to determine the maximum amount of  time before infants became fussy and inattentive. It was critical that the experimenter move  through the different tasks at efficient intervals as it was determined that infants would not  maintain their attention levels for more than three demonstrations and nine test trials.  Therefore, each infant was only required to complete three out of the four training conditions. It  was also decided that the same three tasks would be used for each infant (the cloth task, the  box task, and the belt task). For example, one infant would learn the cloth task (task 1) through  liveactive training, the box task (task 2) through livepassive training, and the belt task (task 3)  through videopassive training (see Table 1).  A second infant would learn the cloth task through  livepassive training, the box task through liveactive training, and the belt task through video active training (see Table 1). Given that infants were only able to do three tasks, including the  fourth would only have created an extra design complication. Thus, the fourth task was removed  since it seemed, from initial observations, to be significantly more difficult than the other three 
32   

adding also to the total procedure time which was already precariously lengthy.  Importantly,  the three conditions and tasks were randomly assigned, the task paired with the training  condition was randomly assigned, and the training condition order was counterbalanced.

Finally, pilot testing also suggested that moving the infant to a separate context--as  done by Chen and colleagues--for each training condition was deemed too disruptive. To re create the "changing environment" in another way, the tasks were presented at an experimental  table designed and built specifically for this study. The table consisted of four platform legs, a  testing platform where the task materials were presented to the infant, a curtain which covered  the presentation area between trials, and two short walls enclosing the presentation area. The  entire table was average size (93 x 63.5 x 46 cm). However, the presentation area that the tasks  were arranged in was slightly smaller (79 x 63.5 x 46 cm). The table was painted white with  brightly colored polka dots on the side; the curtain was also white with polka dots. Importantly, 
33   

the inside of the walls of the table were wired with coloured lights (red, blue, yellow, and green)  and made of a transparent sheet which allowed the light to shine though onto the presentation  area. The purpose of the lights was to increase the distinctiveness between each problem and  essentially "change" (at the flick of a switch) the context similar to the method used by Borovsky  and RoveeCollier (1990). In that study, the researchers were able to create a distinctive test  context by changing the crib liner between training and test trials.   Procedure  All infants were tested at the C.H.I.L.D. Lab at Ryerson University at a time of day when  they were likely to be alert and playful (as indicated by their caregivers). Upon arrival to the lab,  the infant and parent were invited to a waiting room. The study was described to the parent and  they were given a preobservation questionnaire (see Appendix A) and a consent form (see  Appendix B) to complete. During this time, the experimenter played with the infant for  approximately 10 minutes or until infant seemed to be comfortable with the experimenter (i.e.,  smiles and interacts with the experimenter) and their surroundings. Once the infant seemed  comfortable and alert, the infant and parent were led into an adjacent testing room. The infant  was seated on the parent's lap in front of the experimental table (for detailed description see  section above). The parent was asked to adjust their seat until the infant was high enough to  comfortably reach for objects on the table. One observation camera was positioned directly  across from the infant to capture the infant's face.  A second observation camera was positioned  above and to the left of the infant to capture the entire surface of the table and the infant's  actions on the objects. The training and test session were videotaped for later analyses. After  the parent and infant were situated in the appropriate positions, the curtain covering the 
34   

presentation area was opened to reveal the first set of task objects. The first training condition  was predetermined to be liveactive, livepassive, videoactive or videopassive (see below for  description). Following the training session, the curtain was closed while the next test sessions  were prepared. Infants were always given a toy to play with between trials to minimize  fussiness. Time between trials was approximately 30 seconds. The training session was followed  by three test trials (for detailed description see description below). This was followed by a  second training session with a new task and three test trials. This sequence was repeated once  more (a third training session with a new task and three test trials). Overall, each infant  experienced a total of three training session and nine test trials (the upper limit determined  during pilot testing). After the sessions were complete the experimenter thanked the parents  and their infants for participating in the study. The infants were presented with an "Infant  Scientist Award" recognizing their contribution to the advancement of science and parents were  given a tote bag as a thank you gift for their volunteer time.  Training Sessions     For the liveactive training session, the parent was asked to move the chair back slightly 

so the infant could not reach the objects. The experimenter then opened the curtain, knelt down  next to the infant, waved her fingers back and forth to orient the infant's attention to her hand,  and then demonstrated the full sequence of three target actions for a specific task set (see Table  5). The target actions were not verbally described, but to maintain the infants' attention to the  demonstration, the experimenter used phrases such as "watch what I do next", and "isn't this  fun". The objects were then moved back to their original position (see Figure 1), the parent was  asked to bring their infants forward so that they were seated at the table and the infant was 
35   

encouraged to explore the objects. The total duration of the session was approximately 60  seconds. Following this, the infant was given the goal toy to play with, if they had not already  obtained it on their own, and the curtain was closed.   The beginning of the livepassive training session began the same way as the liveactive  session, however, after the first demonstration of the target actions, the objects were moved  back to the starting position and the experimenter repeated the entire sequence twice more for  a total of three demonstrations of the target actions. The toy was given to the infant to play with  after the final demonstration. However, infants were not given an opportunity to interact with  the rest of the task objects in any way. The entire session lasted approximately 60 seconds as  well. It was important to keep the training session about the same length to ensure the infants  had equal exposure to the objects.  When the curtain was opened for the videoactive training sessions, the task objects  were on the table and a 17" LCD monitor with the identical task objects on the screen was  located just behind them. After the experimenter opened the curtain, she pointed to the screen  to direct the infant's attention to the demonstration and said "watch this" at which point the  research assistant started the prerecorded video. During this session, the infant watched the  experimenter perform the sequence of target actions on the prerecorded videotape. The video  was filmed from the infant's point of view in "real time" to make it look as natural as possible.  However, only the experimenter's hands were visible on the screen. The parent was asked to  keep their infant's attention on the screen as much as possible by pointing or saying neutral  phrases such as "look at that" without describing the actions. The parent was also asked to  move their seat so the objects were out of the infant's reach until the first demonstration was 
36   

over at wh hich point th he infant cou uld explore and a  interact t with the ob bjects freely. . The entire  session lasted for app proximately 60 6  seconds as a  well.   Sim milar to the videoactive e session, inf fants also saw the still im mage of the task objects s on  the LCD monitor m  when the curtain n opened un ntil the video o began in th he videopas ssive training g  session. The T  actions were w  demonstrated in a similar man nner to the live demonst trations. The e  entire action sequenc ce was demo onstrated three times.  This T  session also lasted approximate a ely  ds. Importan ntly, howeve er, the real objects were not availabl le to the infa ant at any po oint  60 second during the e session (se ee Figure 2 fo or a schematic represen ntation of the e training co onditions).

37   

for testing had a common goal structure but different surface characteristics (see Figure 1 and  Appendix C).  The purpose of this was to assess analogical problemsolving skills across trials.  Infants were given approximately 100 seconds to solve the problem and retrieve the toy. The  trial ended when infants retrieved the toy. The parent and experimenter clapped for the infant if  the infant did not retrieve the toy themselves, the experimenter gave them the toy directly.  After the first trial was complete, the curtain was closed while the next trial was prepared  (approximately 60 seconds). The second trial and third trials were then conducted in the same  manner.   Dependent Measures and Coding    To assess potential differences in infants' attention during the liveactive, livepassive, 

videoactive and videopassive training sessions, the videotapes were scored to determine the  percentage of time spent looking at the target actions and actively engaged with the task  objects.   In addition, infants' performance during the test trials was assessed. Infants were  assigned a "problem solving score" for each trial based on the number of actions they  completed to retrieve the goal toy (see Table 2). A score of "0" was given if the infant completed  no target actions, "1" if they completed one target action, "2" if they were able to complete two  of the target actions, and "3" if they completed the entire action sequence and made contact  with the toy (Note: during data analysis it was determined that infants fully retrieved the toy  much more than expected and the coding scheme may have been too liberal. The data was re coded using a more conservative coding scheme which stated that infants must fully retrieve the  toy to obtain a score of three).

Results  Overall, infants actively engaged and enjoyed the tasks while at the same time  demonstrating an impressive ability to solve the novel meansends problems. Unexpectedly,  infants performed very well on the first trial and there were no differences across the three test  trials. In addition, the expected age differences were not found. Furthermore, initial analyses  revealed that there were no differences in performance between the live and video conditions.  However, the results did suggest differences between the active and passive conditions.  Additional analyses were conducted to explore these differences further and after careful  consideration, it was determined that the coding scheme used for problem solving scores may  have been too liberal. The data set was then recoded using a more conservative approach.   After descriptive statistics and data exploration, the remainder of the results section is divided  into three subsections: preliminary analyses, primary analyses, and supplemental analyses.   Descriptive Statistics and Data Exploration  Descriptive statistics were calculated for each dependent variable in order to screen for  the presence of outliers and to assess the normality of the distribution. Outliers more than 2  standard deviations from the mean were removed from the dataset before further analyses  were conducted.  The normality of the distribution was then examined for skewness and / or  kurtosis. Because infants were able to solve most of the problems presented to them, the  majority of their problem solving scores were clustered at the higher end of the distribution  resulting in a negatively skewed distribution (Figure 3).  Furthermore, most infants were able to  complete the tasks much more quickly than expected resulting in a positively skewed  distribution (Figure 2). Due to the presence of this significant level of skewness, square root and 

41   

log transformations were applied to the raw data.  However, before deciding on the use of such  transformations, the effect of the transformations on the data was carefully considered. First,  the nature of the dependent variables was considered and it was determined that they were not  likely to be normally distributed because of infants' high performance and the low frequency of  several scores.  Moreover, the degree to which the transformations corrected for the level of  skewness and kurtosis was also taken into account.  Although both the square root and log  transformations were able to reduce the skewness and kurtosis levels slightly, neither was able  to completely eliminate it entirely.  In addition, research on the question of whether or not to  transform data has suggested that when using a robust test (such as the Ftest in analysis of  variance) the statistical model remains accurate even when the assumption of normality is  violated (Glass, Peckham, & Sanders, 1972). Therefore, since most of the research questions  would be addressed using the robust analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, the main dependent  variables were not likely to be normally distributed, and both transformations were not able to  correct the level of skewness and kurtosis, it was decided not to apply the transformations and  the data was kept in its original state.  Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences  (SPSS, version 17). An alpha level of p < 0.05 was selected as the critical cutoff for significant  results and Bonferroni corrections were performed to reduce the rate of Type I errors in post hoc tests.

Primary Analyses  Primary analyses were conducted to address each of the three main objectives of the  study. To address the first objective, correlations and ttests were performed to determine  differences between older and younger infants on performance. The second and third objectives  of the study were addressed using analysis of variance to determine differences across the  demonstration and training conditions. Finally, the last objective of the study was to determine  whether infants were able to use analogical problem solving to apply their knowledge from the  demonstration and training sessions to the test trials; this objective was addressed using analysis  of variance as well. Results are described below.  Age differences. To address the first objective of the study, separate analyses were  conducted to determine if there were age differences across both problem solving scores and  task completion times. Initially, the infants were grouped into two categories, younger infants  (910 months) and older infants (1112 months) and ANOVAs were conducted to determine if 
45

Task completion times. Because significant differences were found across task in the  preliminary analyses, the data for task completion times were analyzed separately for each task.  For the most part, older infants tended to complete the tasks more quickly than younger infants.  This pattern was found for both the cloth task and the belt task. For the box task, the opposite  pattern was found. Younger infants completed the task slightly more quickly. However, because  of the small sample size, it was not possible to test whether these differences were statistically  significant.  The data are shown in Table 5.

To address the second and third  objectives of the study, ANOVAs were conducted to determine if there were differences in  performance according to the type of demonstration and type of training.

Problem solving scores. A 2 (demonstration type: live, video) X 2 (training type: active,  passive) withinsubjects ANOVA was conducted on the mean problem solving scores. No  significant differences were found between the live (M = 2.63, SD = 0.44) and video conditions  (M = 2.70, SD = 0.33), F (1, 16) = 0.01, p = 0.93, ns. However, there was a statistically significant  effect of training type, F (1, 15) = 9.58, p = 0.01. Active training (M = 2.73, SD = 0.42) resulted in  higher problem solving scores than passive training (M = 2.60, SD = 0.37). Posthoc tests  revealed that there were differences depending on the type of training across both the live and  video demonstrations. The difference between problem solving scores for the videoactive (M =  2.76, SD = 0.31) and videopassive (M = 2.61, SD = 0.34) conditions approached statistical  significance (p = 0.07) but did not surpass the critical cutoff. However, the difference between  the liveactive (M = 2.70, SD = 0.48) and livepassive condition (M = 2.51, SD = 0.42) was  statistically different (p = 0.03). The data are presented in Figure 5.

Analogical problem solving and learning across trials. To address the fourth objective of  the study, a variety of analyses were conducted to determine if infants were able to use the  information provided to them during training and apply that knowledge during test trials.  Separate analyses were conducted for both problem solving scores and task completion times.  The results are presented below.   Problem solving scores. Overall, infants' problem solving scores were quite high across  all trials.  Furthermore, there was very little difference across the first (M = 2.47, SD = 0.58),  second (M = 2.39, SD = 0.64) and third trials (M = 2.44, SD = 0.57). An ANOVA was conducted to  determine if these differences were significant and revealed that they were not, F (2, 62) = 0.43,  p = 0.65, ns.   The differences across trial were also examined across experimental conditions. In all  conditions, no infants received a score of zero and very few infants received a score of one. The  majority of scores achieved were either two or three. However, the distribution of these scores  differed considerably across conditions. In the videoactive condition, infants received scores of  three across all trials. In contrast, in the livepassive and videopassive conditions, infants were  more likely to receive scores of two on the first and second trials and scores of three on the third  trial. In addition, although there were relatively few scores of one, there were more scores of  one on the passive conditions in comparison to the active conditions.  These results could not be  tested statistically due to the small sample size. The histograms are presented in Figure 7.  Task completion times. There were some moderate differences in task completion time  across trials. Infants tended to take the most time to complete the task on the first trial and  reduce the time by several seconds on the second trial. This pattern was found for both the 
51   

cloth and box task. For the belt task, the task completion time was similar for trial 1 and 2 and  decreased on trial 3. The differences could not be tested because of the small sample size.     The differences across trial were also examined across experimental condition with 

similar results reported. The time to complete the task was reduced from trial 1 to trial 2 for  most tasks across experimental conditions. The data are presented in Figure 8.

Supplemental Analyses    Followup ANOVAs were conducted to take the results of the earlier analyses one step 

further. More specifically, these analyses were conducted to address issues that may have had  an influence on the results of the primary analyses. For example, differential levels of attention  during demonstrations and training, data coding and withinsubjects training effects. Thus,  supplemental analyses were completed to ensure a thorough accounting of how attention and  training might have altered infants' learning in this study.   Attention during demonstrations and training. The percent of attention (looking time  and active engagement with task objects) during the demonstration and training sessions is  shown in Figure 9. Overall, the percentage was consistently high for all conditions. The live  conditions showed slightly higher attention (liveactive, M = 86.81, SD = 9.72, livepassive,           M = 86.70, SD = 10.51) compared to the video condition (videoactive, M = 80.06, SD = 9.89;  videopassive, M = 77.78, SD = 11.71).  A 2 (demonstration type:  live, video) X 2 (training type:  active, passive) withinsubjects ANOVA across percentage of attention during demonstration  and training sessions yielded no main effect of demonstration type (live or video), F (1, 16) =  3.25, p = 0.09, or training condition (active or passive), F (1, 17) = 0.01, p = 0.90. The fact that  there were no differences in the percentage of time that infants looked at the demonstrations  or were actively engaged with the task objects during training means that subsequent  differences in performance on the tasks could not be attributed to differences in attention  during learning time.

Finally, because this was the first study to examine the video  deficit effect using a withinsubjects design, it is possible that the results described above were  influenced by training effects.

Discussion  The present study had four main objectives. The first was to examine the video deficit  effect in the context of multistep meansend problems. That is, to investigate whether infants  were able to use live and televised information to guide their behaviour and whether this varied  as a function of condition. The second objective was to determine if there were other ways to  increase performance on the video conditions and reduce the video deficit in a new way (using  active experience). The third objective was to provide support for the perceptual  impoverishment theory or dual representation hypothesis.  Finally, the fourth objective was to  assess analogical problem solving across the test sessions. The findings, as related to the four  objectives of the present study, are discussed in greater detail below followed by a description  of the implications, limitations, future directions and conclusions of the present study.  Live versus Video  The primary objective of the present study was to determine if infants were able to use  televised information through video to solve a series of meansend problems and whether  performance was inferior in comparison to a live demonstration. In the present study, infants  aged 9 to 12 months were able to solve meansend problems using information obtained from  both a live and televised model.  This finding corroborates previous developmental science that  has shown that infants are able to use televised information to guide their own behaviour in  imitation tasks (e.g. Barr et al., 2007), object search tasks (e.g. Schmitt & Anderson, 2002),  emotion processing tasks (e.g. Mumme & Fernald, 2003), and language tasks (e.g. Kuhl, Tsao, &  Liu, 2003). However, the majority of these studies have also reported that while infants are able  to learn from the televised information, their performance is almost always inferior in 

63   

comparison to performance after learning from a live demonstration. In contrast to these  findings, the present study did not reveal a difference in performance across the live and video  demonstrations. Interestingly, performance was considerably better for the video conditions.   There are several possible explanations for why this finding is inconsistent with other reports in  the literature:  first, the firstperson perspective used to demonstrate the target actions rather  than the more commonly used thirdperson perspective; second, the steady closeup shot used  for the video demonstrations, and finally, the nature of the task itself.   The effect of the visual perspective of the model on imitation has not been well  investigated. Despite various definitions of imitation, most researchers agree that it involves  mapping your own behaviour onto the behaviour observed in another individual. A crucial  aspect of this skill would therefore be the ability to spatially transform viewed actions. When a  model faces the viewer (the thirdperson perspective), the viewer is required to spatially reverse  the actions he or she is seeing. In contrast, the firstperson perspective does not require any  transformation because the model is already presented from the viewer's point of view. In an  experiment conducted by Jackson, Meltzoff, and Decety (2006), participants watched videoclips  depicting simple hand and foot actions filmed from the first and thirdperson perspectives and  were then required to imitate the actions. Results showed that participants were significantly  faster in imitating the actions of a model seen from the firstperson perspective and also  seemed to generate fewer errors. Therefore, demonstrating the target actions from the first person perspective in the present study (compared to the thirdperson perspective typically  used in these types of studies) may have somehow enhanced infants' ability to learn from video. 

64   

Along the same lines of argument, a second possible explanation for the difference in  performance may have been related to the angle chosen to film the video demonstrations. In  order to keep the visual perspective consistent, a camera was set up in place of where the infant  would be sitting during the test sessions to film the video demonstration clips; in effect, a more  natural "infant perspective" was created in the present study.  This resulted in a "closeup"  effect in which the task objects and only part of the experimenter were visible on the video. This  is in contrast to video clips used in other studies where the video typically shows much more of  the experimenter. For example, Barr and Hayne (1999) describe the experimenter's face and  torso being shown in the videos used for their experiments.  Usually, an effort is made to keep  the video clips and the live demonstrations as similar as possible. However, in an attempt to  investigate whether more complex viewing conditions affected infants' tendency to imitate, at  least one previous study has attempted to use closeup shots (Barr & Hayne, 1999, experiment  1C and 3). In the video clips used for experiment 1C, the demonstration began with a wideangle  shot of the experimenter and task objects. At the beginning of the demonstration of the target  actions, the camera zoomed in to create a closeup shot of the actions before zooming out again  at the end of the demonstrations. For experiment 3, the demonstration alternated between a  wideangle shot of the experimenter and task objects and a closeup shot of the experimenter's  hands during each demonstration of the target actions.  Overall, the results of these  experiments showed that both 15 month olds and 18 month olds still did not perform as well in  the video conditions with closeups in comparison to their performance in the live conditions.  Arguably the closeups should have helped infants focus their attention. However, it should be  noted that in the video clips just described, there seems to be a considerable amount of 
65   

zooming in and zooming out.  Rather than helping the infants focus their limited attentional  resources on the target actions, the movement from the camera likely increased the level of  distraction. In contrast, the video clips used in the present study remained steady and  maintained the closeups shot throughout the entire clip. This methodological component may  have helped infants focus their attention on the target actions without the distraction of the  camera moving.  Finally, one other possible explanation for the difference may have been the task used in  the present study. Although the video deficit effect is a commonly reported finding in the infant  learning literature, several studies have reported equal learning from live and televised  information. For example, Meltzoff (1988) did not find a video deficit effect in 14 month olds  who were shown how to pull apart a dumbbellshaped object. Initially, researchers criticized the  task and suggested that the onestep sequence was not affected and only more complicated  multistep sequences resulted in a video deficit. However, other research has shown that a  variety of multistep sequences can be learned equally well from live and video demonstrations  and do not show a video deficit. For example, when 15monthold infants were shown how to  "build a rattle" (by placing a block in a jar, putting a velcro lid on the jar, and shaking the handle  attached to the lid to make a sound) they imitated the actions whether they were modeled live  or on television and importantly, the infants in the live and video conditions performed  equivalently. Furthermore, 9 to 12monthold infants performed equally well across live and  video conditions for the three tasks used in the present study (which were all similar to the  rattle task in that each task involved multiple steps and each step must be completed in the  proper order). Interestingly, there seems to be a distinctive difference between the types of 
66   

tasks that result in a video deficit and those that do not. For example, tasks in which infants have  shown differential learning across live and video conditions appear to have redundant  requirements. That is, the actions required don't necessarily seem purposeful in comparison to  the tasks that do not show the deficit. For example, in the object search tasks, the toddler is  being asked to retrieve a toy that has essentially already been "retrieved" by the model when  she has demonstrated where the toy is hiding or in the puppet task when the infant is asked to  remove a mitten from the puppet to shake a bell and is then required to put it back. There are  several possible interpretations for why we see differential learning across these tasks. The first  may be that infants are able to solve meansend problems relatively easily on their own without  any demonstrations. The ability to execute a sequence of planned steps to achieve a goal  (meansend problem solving) develops rapidly after 6 months of age. By 7 months, infants begin  to solve simple onestep problems such as searching under a cover for a toy (Willatts, 1984) or  pulling a cloth to retrieve an out of reach toy (Willatts, 1999). At 9 months they can solve  problems requiring two intermediate steps and by 10 months, infants can solve problems  requiring three intermediate steps (Willatts, 1992). Given that these young infants are such  "expert" problemsolvers, it may be the case that infants are not necessarily using the live or  televised information provided to them to complete the meansend tasks but rather, are  completing the tasks themselves through trial and error. While a control group of infants was  not included in the present study, Barr and Hayne (1999, experiment 2) did include a group of  baseline infants who were exposed to the test objects but did not receive any kind of  demonstration. The authors reported that while no differences were found in the performance  of infants in the live and video conditions, both groups performed significantly better than the 
67   

infants in the control group. Given the similarity between the rattle task and the tasks used in  the present study, it seems unlikely that infants would be able to complete the task without  previously being given information regarding the goal of the task. Beyond this speculation,  however, a control group should be included in future studies using these tasks in order to  systematically rule out this possibility.    Secondly, another possible elucidation for these task differences may be related to  infants' ability to understand others' intentions. In a much cited study by Gergely, Bekkering,  and Kiraly (2002), 14monthold infants watched an adult use an unusual action to illuminate a  light box; she pressed the box with her forehead rather than her hands. In one condition, the  experimenter's hands were simply placed on table next to the light box. When infants in this  condition were given the light box themselves, the majority of them also used their forehead to  illuminate the light. In another condition, the experimenter pretended to be cold and held a  blanket around her shoulders therefore making her hands "unavailable" before pressing the  light box with her forehead. In this case, when infants were given the light box themselves, most  of them used the simpler (yet undemonstrated) method of pressing the light with their hands. In  the "handsoccupied" condition infants may have assumed that the adult used her hand because  she had to (she could not use her hands). Because this constraint did not apply to the infants  themselves, they used their hands. However, in the "handsfree" condition, on the other hand,  infants likely assumed that the adult could have used her hands (they were free) and that there  must have been some reason for this choice and therefore copied the unusual action. Similarly,  Bruggar, Adams, Mumme, & Bushnell (2007) reported that infants imitate only those actions  deemed necessary to create an effect.  Furthermore, research has also shown that infants are 
68   

able to infer and imitate the intended goal of a model's actions even if the model fails to actually  achieve (demonstrate) this goal (Meltzoff, 1995). Infants can also distinguish between a model's  intentional and accidental behaviours and are more likely to imitate intentional acts (Carpenter,  Akhtar, & Tomasello, 1998). While infants seem to able to demonstrate their knowledge of  another's goals for live models, this skill for televised models is not yet clear. Guided by these  important developmental findings, one could suggest that while infants are able to understand a  live model's goals and a televised model's goals equally well for certain tasks (resulting in no  video deficit effect) this may be more difficult when the goals of the task are not as clear. That is,  when the model's goals are ambiguous, infants may not readily apply the knowledge gained  from a televised model as easily as that obtained from the live model.  This observation and  account is consistent with previous work conducted by Wenner and Bauer (1999) who found  that "enabling events" that must be assembled in the correct order to achieve the goal (such as  the rattle task) are learned earlier than "arbitrary events" that can be assembled in any order  (such as the puppet task). Therefore, infants are first able to complete orderly tasks and show no  video deficit while it may take slightly longer for the arbitrary tasks to be fully understood  resulting in a video deficit effect initially.   Finally, another possibility for these task differences may involve the age of the infants  being tested. When a skill first develops, it does take some time before infants settle in to one  particular pattern of use. For example, it has been reported that infants are able to imitate  actions with objects from approximately 6 months of age (Collie & Hayne, 1999). While at least  one study has found that 6monthold infants learn equally well from live and video  demonstrations (Barr et al., 2007b) another has reported a video deficit effect using the same 
69   

imitation task with 12montholds (Barr & Hayne, 1999). Similarly, in the present study, 9 to  12month old infants were required to complete a multistep meansend task. Previously, it has  been reported that this skill emerges between 7 and 10 months of age. While the video deficit is  not evident in this study, perhaps it would be with older infants. That is, it may be the case that  a newly acquired skill is very flexible in its early stages and can be used in a variety of ways (i.e.,  using information from live or video sources to use the skill) but becomes more rigid with time  and experience.   Active versus Passive  Another key objective of the present study was related to whether providing infants with  active experience could ameliorate the video deficit effect. While no video deficit effect was  found in the current study, active experience did significantly increase performance, as  hypothesized. Furthermore, this pattern was shown across both live and video conditions.  Jean Piaget, one of the most influential developmental theorists, believed that the  developing child is an active thinker who is constantly trying to construct more advanced  understandings of the world through trial and error experimentation (Piaget, 1952). As an  alternative to the "actiondiscovery" approach, researchers have suggested that it is more  beneficial for infants to learn by watching others. Support for this position comes from research  conducted by Provasi, Dubon, & Bloch (2001), and others, who reported that infants were more  successful in manipulating a knob (in a simple manipulation task) after having watched a model  perform the same task than after free play with the knob. Similarly, we know that infants readily  learn to use tools by watching others (Barrett, Davis, & Needham, 2007). The debate between  the importance of self performed and observed actions has continued for several decades and 
70   

while there seems to be sufficient evidence to argue that infants can learn by watching others,  the role of active experience should not be discounted. Compelling findings from work  conducted by Munakata, McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler (1997) revealed that 6 to7month  old infants could be trained to use an intermediary object as a means to a desired end (pulling a  towel to retrieve a distant toy) simply by instructing the parent to put their hands over their  infant's hands and guide the infant through the proper motions. This skill likely would not have  developed until several weeks later, but by receiving active training, infants were able to  demonstrate competence much earlier than would be expected. In a similar spirit, Needham,  Barrett, & Peterman (2002) provided young infants with the ability to pick up toys using "sticky"  mittens (mittens with the palm covered in soft velcro that can pick up toys that have hard velcro  on them) weeks before they would have been able to do so without the help of the mittens. Just  by placing their hand near the toy, they were able to gain control over the toy and move it  around. In comparison to infants who did not receive training with the mittens, trained infants  look at objects more frequently, engaged in more exploratory mouthing behaviours with the  objects, and also attempted to intentionally retrieve more toys whether or not they were still  wearing the mittens. Additional research has shown that active experience augments infants'  ability to understand the actions of others as well. For example, handson training was found to  provide greater understanding of another person's goals compared to an observation alone  condition (Sommerville, Hildebrand, & Crane, 2008). Similarly, other research conducted by  Hauf, Aschersleben, and Prinz (2007) also found that agentive experiences influenced infants'  perceptions of actions performed by others. That is, infants' acting on objects themselves  increased their interest in the actions of other people with the same object.  
71   

As hypothesized, and in line with previous findings, active experience substantially  increased infants' performance on the problem solving tasks. Even with only one complete  demonstration initially and a short amount of time exploring the object themselves, infants  received significantly higher problem solving scores than in the passive conditions where they  witnessed three complete demonstrations revealing how to solve the multistep task. In  addition, infants solved the problems in less time in the active conditions. Because infants were  given time to explore the objects themselves during the training session in the active conditions  (before the test sessions) it seems likely that they did not need as much time during the first trial  to explore the objects as infants who had only passively seen the objects and did not have an  opportunity to interact with them during training. This explanation may account for the variation  in task completion times.   Theoretical Considerations    The third objective of the present study was to contribute to the discussion in the 

literature related to the perceptual encoding impoverishment theory and the dual  representation hypothesis. Even though a video deficit effect was not found in the present  study, the current findings do suggest support for several features of each of these theories and  perspectives. According to the dual representation hypothesis, it is not until the second year of  life that infants are able to truly differentiate between 2D images and 3D objects resulting in a  decrease in learning from television (DeLoache, Pierroutsakos, & Troseth, 1996). Before this  time, infants treat images and objects in very similar ways and do not show a video deficit.  Compatible with this argument, findings from the present study found no significant differences  between the live and video conditions for infants under the age one year.  
72   

 

However, the data from the present study may also provide support for the perceptual 

impoverishment theory. According to this theory, infants do not perform as well in video  conditions because of poor perceptual encoding (Barr & Hayne, 1999). That is, the 2D input is  impoverished in comparison to the 3D input in terms of size, colour, depth cues, shadows, etc.  making it difficult to visually process. Similarly, Johnson (1997) has argued that more streams of  information are required before a 2D image can match its 3D counterpart. In the present study,  infants in the passive condition simply looked at a video screen and observed an experimenter  demonstrating the target actions several times. However, in the active condition, infant viewed  the same demonstration on the screen but also had the same objects in front of them. It is likely  that having the objects in front of them may have reduced the attentional requirements  associated with processing and encoding information from the television screen. Rather than  having to form a representation of the task objects from the 2D video display and transfer the  perceptual attributes to the 3D object during the test sessions, infants in the active conditions  presumably would have been able to encode the 3D attributes of the test objects directly. The  fact that infants performed so much better when they were given an opportunity to encode the  3D attributes of the test objects directly is consistent with the perceptual impoverishment  theory.     Overall, the current findings provide some contributory evidence in support of each of 

these two primary theories. Consistent with the perceptual impoverishment theory, adding the  additional streams of information to encode information increased performance when infants  were observing target actions from a 2D source and were required to transfer that information  to a 3D source. Furthermore, the data are also in keeping with the dual representation 
73   

hypothesis indicating that infants under one year of age interact with 2D images and 3D objects  similarly. Because they do not understand the critical differences between them, information is  transferring easily and no deficit occurs. Neither theory is able to conclusively explain the  findings as there is a dynamic interplay of perceptual processing, encoding, retrieval, and  representational factors involved.   Analogical Problem Solving    The final objective of the present study was to determine if infants were able to use 

information obtained during the demonstration and training sessions and apply that knowledge  to different problems in the test session: analogical problem solving. This paradigm was  modeled after that used by Chen et al. (1997) in which the researchers changed the colour and  size of the task objects but the underlying structure of the problem remained the same. For the  present study, in addition to altering the colour and size of the task objects used for the first  step of each problem, special design attention was given to the properties of the objects used  for the second step (for example, using a string, a hollow plastic tube, and a ribbon).  The  reasoning in the current study was that this new design may present a more difficult analogy for  the infants to make thereby improving the robustness of the previous finding. However, it  should also be noted that much more systematic research is needed to determine whether or  not this analogy is in fact more difficult. Furthermore, it is also important to note that while  these analogical problems may look very similar to adults and the common structure seems  obvious, this is not the case for infants (Chen et al., 1997). In the current study, infants in both  age groups performed reasonably well even from the first trial and there were no significant  differences across trials.  This is somewhat surprising given that there were age differences 
74   

reported in the Chen et al. (1997) study and the task used in the current study was believed to  be slightly more difficult. According to Chen et al. (1997), 13monthold infants were able to  transfer the solution across tasks quite readily. However, 10montholds were only able to  transfer the solution to problems with a high degree of perceptual similarity (for example,  different task objects but the same goal toy for each problem). Several key factors may have  been related to this discrepancy. In the current study, it was determined during pilot testing that  moving infants for each task was quite disruptive. Therefore, infants remained seated on their  parent's lap for each problem. Thelen (2000) suggested that when infants remain in the same  position, the memory of actions that are built up over the course of the trials include both  visually stored information as well as a memory for the feeling of the specific postures involved  with completing the task--all of which are integrated into the next plan for action. For example,  in a study conducted by Smith, Thelen, Titzer, and McLin (1999), the authors found that after  hiding a toy in one location consistently, infants would continually reach to the first location  even after they had seen the toy placed at another location. On the other hand, when parents  are asked to change the infants' postures by standing them up on their laps (rather than  remaining in a seated position) just before the toy moves to the second location, infants are able  to resist the urge to reach to the first location and correctly reach to the second location. These  findings suggest that by keeping infants in the same position for each trial, the present study  may have inadvertently "helped" infants perform better since they had to complete the same  actions on each test trial. However, it should be noted here that in the present study, several  efforts were made to create "unique separation" between trials: the curtain was closed in  between each problem; the parents were asked turn their chair away from the presentation 
75   

area; and the lights illuminating the presentation area for the task objects were changed  between each problem in an attempt to replicate the changing environment in another way.  This manipulation was modeled after previous research conducted by Borovsky and Rovee Collier (1990) which found that changing the crib liners between the training and test trials was  sufficient to create a distinctive test context. In this case, because we did not report a significant  difference across trials, it may be that the lights did not make enough of a difference to "trick"  the infant into thinking they were in a new place. Alternatively, the lights may not have had as  much context influence on the 9 to 12month olds used in the present study. Although the  lights appeared to have an impact during pilot testing, more systematic research is needed to  determine whether or not changing the lighting context has a major influence on subsequent  learning.     In addition to the changing contexts, another procedural difference may have affected 

the results. In the present study, all infants were given at least one demonstration of the target  actions before the test sessions. In contrast, infants in the Chen et al. (1997) study were first  given an opportunity to interact with the objects themselves and if they were unable to solve  the problem, the parent was asked to demonstrate the correct solutions. Therefore, infants in  the Chen et al. (1997) study were only encouraged to actively explore the objects before seeing  a demonstration whereas infants in the present study were always given a demonstration of the  target actions before being given active experience (in the active condition; infants in the  passive condition were not given any active experience but were still shown how to solve the  problems). Interestingly, results from the Chen et al. (1997) study indicated that the greatest  improvement in performance occurred between the first and second test trial (during which 
76   

infants would have been given active experience) and there were no differences in performance  between the second and third trials. In the current study, performance was high from the first  trial and there were no significant differences between the first, second, or third trials. Thus, the  timing of the demonstrations and / or the timing of the active experience may have played a  more significant role in infants' ability to solve problems than assumed at the outset of this  study.  Similarly, recent work conducted by Sommerville, Woodward and Needham (2005) has  reported that the order of active experience does in fact make a difference in terms of learning.  In their study, the researchers found that when infants were given active experience with a test  object prior to or after watching another person use the object only infants with active  experience focused on the relationship between the actor and her goal whereas infants who  watched first did not. Thus, active experience facilitated the infants' perception of another's  actions.       Finally, one other possible explanation for the difference in performance found between 

infants in the current study and infants in Chen et al. (1997)'s study may have been the nature of  the coding scheme used to evaluate performance. In the Chen et al. (1997) study, infants were  given a score ranging from 02 depending on how efficiently they solved the problem. Infants  were given a score of 0 if they were unable to solve the problem, a score of 1 if they solved the  problem with a trial and error approach and a score of 2 if they solved the problem with a goal oriented approach. For the current study, infants were given a score from 03 depending on the  number of target actions they completed. This particular coding scheme was selected for the  present study because this type of coding scheme gave infants credit for each section of the task  they completed rather than overall performance which is important when trying to determine 
77   

exactly where performance differences exist. Moreover, because it was believed that altering  the second step of the task in a more distinctive way may have increased the overall complexity  of the task,  the second set of distracter items used in the Chen et al. (1997) study were not  included in the current study making trial and error more difficult to assess. In addition, this  coding scheme fits more closely with the majority of coding schemes used in the imitation  literature (e.g. Barr et al., 2007b) and it was important to keep this consistent given that this is  the area in which the current findings would be more directly compared to.  Implications, Limitations, and Future Directions    Acknowledging the important differences between dynamic television (in the home) and 

controlled televised video (in the lab), the connections and extensions between the two are  significant with laboratory research in this area can provide critical insights into how children  learn from television. With the tremendous rise in the development of television programs and  videos directed specifically at infants and subsequent television viewing by these young viewers,  there is also a growing body of research investigating whether infants are actually able to  effectively learn from these types of media. While the AAP recommends (2001 report)  restricting the amount of exposure to television for children under the age of 2, recent reports  estimate that by the age of 24 months, approximately 90% of infants engage in television  viewing on a regular basis (Zimmerman et al., 2007). In a relatively short amount of time, infant  television viewing has become an enormous industry. This may be in part due to the educational  claims made by these products either indirectly or directly. For example, many of the titles  themselves are highly suggestive of cognitive benefits (e.g. Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby).  Moreover, testimonials on packages and websites take the message that much further 
78   

exclaiming to "teach your child about language, colours, shapes, and patterns". Most  importantly, this type of marketing appears to be highly effective; indeed, a survey conducted  with over 1000 families reported that 29% of parents cited the most common reason for  allowing their infant to watch TV is that it is "good for the brain" (Zimmerman et al., 2007).  Shockingly, the same survey found that only 6% of the parents interviewed were even aware  that the AAP had guidelines discouraging parents from allowing their infant to watch television.     One of the main criticisms of television viewing is that for the most part, it is a passive 

activity, and it takes time away from other more interactive activities between infants and  parents that have been shown to be vitally important for development.  However, newer DVD  programs, such as that developed by DVD MAGIQ, have created companion toys that respond to  the onscreen content to go along with the DVDs. The creators' argue that this provides the  infant with a more enriching learning experience. Along similar lines, the present study  investigated whether providing infants with active experience with the task objects along with  televised demonstrations of how to solve the tasks in an experimental setting would show  higher levels of problem solving.  Results indicated that infants were in fact able to solve means end problems using information from a televised model. These results are consistent with a  variety of studies showing infant learning from television (e.g. Barr et al., 2007b; Schmitt &  Anderson, 2002; Kuhl et al., 2003; Mumme & Fernald, 2003). While there were no significant  differences between the live and video conditions, there were differences between the active  and passive conditions, as expected.  Still, future studies are needed to determine the  robustness of this finding. That is, determining whether active experience is able to enhance  performance in imitation and  object search tasks and possibly ameliorate the video deficit 
79   

previously reported using these tasks (e.g. Barr et al., 2007b; Schmitt & Anderson, 2002).  Moreover, it is important to maintain a developmental perspective when considering these  issues. Conclusions drawn from a single task have the potential to be misleading given that we  do not know specific details regarding the age at which infants can use specific types of televised  information or whether there are other differences between tasks across different ages.  Additionally, this area of developmental science is still relatively new and extending and  implementing the "home television" to the "laboratory television" is not without complexity-- there are a myriad of key variables to monitor and control for.  While the televised  demonstrations in this study were made to be as consistent with the live demonstrations as  much as possible, they did not include many of the typical features seen in commercially  available infant programs. For example, the visual and auditory effects, camera angles, etc.  Future research is called for to systematically examine the effects of these features on learning  from television. On a final but related point, to keep the demonstrations as consistent as  possible across participants, parents were asked refrain from describing the target actions as  they were being demonstrated. Only the experimenter spoke and said relatively neutral  comments such as "watch what I do next". However, researchers investigating parent and infant  behaviours while engaged in television viewing have recently reported that most parents tend to  narrate during a video presentation of commercially available programming (Barr, Zack, Garcia,  & Muentener, 2008). Experimentally manipulating the level of narration is another possible  avenue for future research.  Ultimately, it will be crucial to understand infants' learning from  more naturalistic--and parent sensitive--conditions before we are able to draw unequivocal  conclusions from the lab to real life 
80   

 

An additional line of future research involves analogical problem solving. When adults 

are confronted with a new problem to solve, it is generally assumed that their problem solving  behaviour is guided by previous experience with a similar problem. However, according to Chen  et al. (1997) there continues to be a debate in terms of children's problem solving ability. On the  one hand, researchers have argued that early experiences are critical for later development  (implying that infants are capable to transferring what they've learned from one situation to the  next). On the other hand, young children are believed to be inflexible learners who cannot  transfer knowledge. This particular area has not been well investigated in years, but given the  importance of such a skill, it is worth pursuing.   Conclusions    Several important conclusions can be drawn from the present study. First, infants are 

able to use televised information to solve multistep meansend problems. Second, even when  the surface characteristics of the task are changed, 9 to 12month olds infants are able to  transfer the solution presented to them during the demonstration to the new problems. Third,  infants performed equally well when the information was presented to them through a live or  televised demonstration. Fourth, a single complete demonstration (either live or on video)  followed by a small amount of active exploration time with the task objects resulted in  significantly higher problem solving scores compared to three demonstrations (either live or on  video) with no active experience. Collectively, the findings from the current study highlight the  importance of active experience and provide a foundation for future research on infant learning.  This research ultimately adds to the growing body of developmental science that aims to 

81   

address sociallyrelevant questions which hold enormous implications for the healthy cognitive  and socialemotional development of infants in the first years of life.

Study Name:              Researcher:   Participant Number:   Date:   PARTICIPANT CONSENT FORM RESEARCH PROJECT TITLE: Infant Learning from Television: Beyond Imitation in 9 and 12month old Infants  PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to help us understand what young infants are able to learn from video.   This  consent  form,  a  copy  of  which  will  be  left  with  you  for  your  reference,  is  only  part  of  the  process  of  informed  consent.  It  should  give  you  the  basic  idea  of  what  the  research  is  about  and  what  your  participation  will  involve.  If  you would like more detail about something mentioned here, or information not included here, you should feel free  to ask. Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand any accompanying information.  PROCEDURE:  After  the  PreObservation  Questionnaire  has  been  completed  and  your  baby  seems  comfortable,  the  two  of  you  will  be  led  to  an  adjacent  testing  room.  Your  baby  will  sit  on  your  lap  at  a  table.  A  brief  video  demonstrating  a  sequence  of  actions  will  be  shown  on  a  television  screen  and  your  baby  will  then  have  an  opportunity  to  interact  with  the  toys  shown  in  the  video.  We  are  interested  in  measuring  your  child's  ability  to  apply  televised  information  to  objects  in  real  life.  There  are  no  right  or  wrong  answers.  Sometimes  babies  are  very  interested in the task and are successful in solving the problem using the televised information and sometimes they  are  not  interested  or  successful.  Both  of  these  are  normal  responses  and  do  not  say  anything  about  your  child's  development. We ask that you sit quietly while your baby is trying to solve the problem themselves. However, after  each  attempt,  we  encourage  you  to  interact  with  your  baby  and  provide  social  reward.  The  entire  experimental  session should last approximately 30 minutes and will be videotaped for analysis purposes at a later date.  POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS: The only potential risk for participation in either of these studies is that the infant  may  become  disinterested  in  the  task  and  display  fussiness.  However,  you  are  free  to  take  a  break  to  address  any  needs  of  their  infant  or  to  discontinue  the  session  at  any  time.  The  researcher  will  also  closely  monitor  the  infant's  readiness to continue.   As  for  the  potential  benefits,  you  have  the  opportunity  to  learn  more  about  infant  development.   In  addition,  the  procedure is designed to be engaging for infants of this age group and they typically enjoy the many trials presented  to them in this "gamelike" fashion. Importantly, although not a direct benefit to participants, the findings from this  study have the potential to extend previous research and contribute to the question concerning what young infants  can learn from video. This work could have a key impact on parents' choices for healthy learning and development.   CONFIDENTIALITY:  Any  information  that  is  obtained  in  connection  with  this  study,  including  the  information  you  provide in the questionnaire, will remain strictly confidential.  Your privacy and that of your infant will be respected.   All  records  will  be  referred  to  in  the  study  using  pseudonyms  and  study  codes  which  will  be  securely  stored  on  passwordprotected media.  The questionnaires and any other hard copy information pertaining to this study will be  stored  in  a  separate  locked  filing  cabinet  from  the  consent  forms  in  the  laboratory.    Sessions  are  videotaped  in  order  to  allow  the  researcher  to  examine  the  records  of  observations  at  a  future  date.   All  videorecordings  will  be  used  strictly  for  research  purposes  and  can only  be  accessed  by  those  directly  involved  in  the  study.  These  images,  like the rest of your child's information, are stored separately from information identifying your child. Should you at  any  time  wish  not  to  be  contacted  for  future  studies,  please  tell  a  member  of  the  lab,  and  we  will  be  happy  to  remove your name from contact list.   PARTICIPATION:  Your participation is voluntary.  You are not under any obligation to answer any questions.  If at  any time you wish to withdraw from this study and session, you may do so without any consequences by simply  notifying the researcher. You also have the option of removing your infant's records of observation from the study  or requesting that the session not be videotaped.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  Because of the unique needs of infants, a variety of special procedures are in place to  ensure  your  baby  is  safe  and  comfortable  during  each  component  of  the  study.  In  the  waiting  area,  the  toys  provided  for  the  infants  to  play  with  are  ageappropriate.  All  of  the  materials  used  during  the  experiment  are  designed  and  built  to  be  safe  for  babies  with  smooth  rounded  edges  and  the  use  of  nontoxic  paint.  All  toys  are  sterilized  with  a  babysafe  cleaning  agent  after  each  session  with  an  individual  infant.  In  addition,  the  tasks  are  designed  to  be  very  engaging  for  infants  at this  age.  The  trials  are  conducted  in  a  "gamelike"  fashion which  infants  typically  enjoy.  Infants  will  remain  with  their  caregiver  at  all  times.  The  caregiver  and  researcher  will  continually  monitor  the  baby's  emotional  state  and  readiness  to  continue.  The  sessions  can  also  be  paused  to  address  any  feeding or changing issues that arise and a clean and private area of the lab is provided for these purposes.  FEEDBACK:  We  hope  that  you  are  interested  in  the  research  and  we  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  further  questions  you  might  have  about  it  at  any  time.   If  you  wish  to  be  informed  about  the  results  of  this  study,  please  leave  your  phone  number  and/or  email  address  and  you  will  be  contacted  upon  the  completion  of  this  project.   If  you  do  not  wish  to  be  contacted  and  are  still  interested  in  the  results  of  the  study  then  you  may  obtain  information  about  the  results by contacting us.    COMPENSATION:  As  a  token  of  our  appreciation  for  taking  part  in  our  study,  you  and  your  child  will  receive  a  small  gift  bag  containing  a  small  children's  book  or  toy  to  take  home  with  them  for  their  efforts.   You  and  your  child  will  receive this complimentary gift regardless of whether your child completes the study.

    Task 1 Description 

       

   

   

   

  Task 1 required two subgoals (pulling a cloth and pulling another object) to  retrieve a toy. The first subgoal, pulling the cloth, brought the second object  within reach. The infant could then pull the second object (the second sub goal) to bring the goal toy within reach and retrieve it.        Task 1, Version A    Task items included a hollow plastic blue stick (33.02 cm) and a red cloth        (23 x 15 cm) as the task items. One end of the stick rested on the cloth and the  other was attached to the goal toy.        Task 1, Version B    Task items included a thick green rope (33.02 cm) and an orange cloth             (25 x 13 cm) as the task items. One end of the rope rested on the cloth and the  other was attached to the goal toy.        Task 1, Version C    Task items included a thick red ribbon (33.02 cm) and a blue cloth (29 x 7.5 cm)  as the task items. One end of the ribbon rested on the cloth and the other was  attached to the goal toy.        Task 1, Version D    Task items included a white plastic chain (33.02 cm) and a green cloth             (18 x 18 cm) as the task items. One end of the chain rested on the cloth and  the other was attached to the goal toy.

    Task 2 Description 
 

   

   

   

   

Task 2 required two subgoals (pushing a handle and opening a transparent  box) to retrieve a toy. The first subgoal, pushing the handle (long wooden  dowel), brought the transparent box within the infant's reach. The infant could  then use the handle attached to the box to open it (the second subgoal) and  retrieve the goal toy.      Task 2 Version A    Task items included a long wooden dowel and weight colored red (33 cm) with  a red circle shape on the end (4 cm) and a transparent box (10 x 10 x 10 cm)  with a black knob handle attached to it (2.5 cm). The wooden dowel was  attached to the transparent box. The center of the dowel had a small hole in  the middle which was placed on a support riser and secured to the based to  allow the system to glide freely from side to side. The goal toy was placed  inside of the transparent box.       Task 2 Version B    Task items included a long wooden dowel and weight colored yellow (33 cm)  with a yellow triangle shape on the end (4 cm) and a transparent box                (10 x 10 x 10 cm) with a thick white handle (7.5 cm) attached to it. The wooden  dowel was attached to the transparent box. The goal toy was placed inside of  the transparent box.        Task 2 Version C    Task items included a long wooden dowel and weight colored blue (33 cm)  with a purple cross shape on the end (5 cm) and a transparent box                   (10 x 10 x 10 cm) with a handle made of a piece of blue ribbon (6 cm) attached  to it. The wooden dowel was attached to the transparent box. The goal toy was  placed inside of the transparent box.        Task 2 Version D    Task items included a long wooden dowel and weight colored green (33 cm)  with a green square shape on the end (4 cm) and a transparent box                  (10 x 10 x 10 cm) with a handle made of thin green string (7.5 cm) attached to  it. The wooden dowel was attached to the transparent box. The goal toy was  placed inside of the transparent box.

  Task 3 Description 

    

   

   

   

  Task 3 required two subgoals (removing a barrier and pushing a button) to  retrieve a toy. The first subgoal, removing the barrier, revealed a button. When  the infant pressed the button (the second subgoal), the experimenter activated a  circling belt on which the goal toy was located at the end. Activating the belt  brought the goal toy within reach for the infant to retrieve it      Task 3 Version A    Task items included a red cardboard barrier (18 x 18 x 10 cm) with a red foam  handle (7.5 x 4 x 2.5 cm) in the shape of an oversized Lego block and a blue push  button with a smiling cartoon face on a green base (10 x 13 x 7.5 cm). The goal toy  was located at the end of a small rotating belt (52 x 25 x 2.5 cm).      Task 3 Version B    Task items included a yellow cardboard barrier (15 x 13 x 13 cm) with a yellow  foam handle (7.5 x 4 x 2.5 cm) in the shape of an oversized Lego block and red  push button with a smiling cartoon face on an orange base (10 x 13 x 7.5 cm).  The  goal toy was located at the end of a small rotating belt (52 x 25 x 2.5 cm).      Task 3 Version C    Task items included a purple cardboard barrier (23 x 15 x 10 cm) with a blue foam  handle (7.5 x 4 x 2.5 cm) in the shape of an oversized Lego block and a yellow  push button with a neutral cartoon face on a green base (10 x 13 x 7.5 cm).  The  goal toy was located at the end of a small rotating belt (52 x 25 x 2.5 cm).      Task 3 Version D    Task items included a green cardboard barrier (19 x 15 x 13 cm) with a green foam  handle (7.5 x 4 x 2.5 cm) in the shape of an oversized Lego block and a red push  button with a neutral cartoon face on a blue base (10 x 13 x 7.5 cm).
