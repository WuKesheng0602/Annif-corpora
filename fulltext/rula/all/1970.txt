ABSTRACT Isolation, Separation and Identification o f the Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS) Protein Fraction from the Activated Sludge Floe Elena Brei Environmental Applied Science and Management Master o f Applied Science 2006 Ryerson University The purpose o f this study was to expand the current knowledge of the composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), principally EPS proteins, and their influence on structure, stability and surface chemistry of microbial floes in activated sludge. It was proposed that a substantial portion of EPS proteins contains glycoproteins or proteins that are strongly bound noncovalently to carbohydrates. Various buffer additives, purification and precipitation methods were employed for protein purification and several glycoprotein detection methods were utilized for glycoprotein detection in the EPS. The proteins were separated with success, with a substantial portion suggesting either a possible glycosylation or strong noncovalent interactions with carbohydrate moiety. An enzyme, oligoendopeptidase F fi'om M3B family was tentatively identified as a major protein present. These results suggest that proteins in the activated sludge EPS may exist in a very intricate arrangement. Furthermore, the EPS peptides may get degraded by naturally present enzymes in the EPS after the protein is digested prior to mass spectrum (MS), making the identification challenging.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background The activated sludge process is one of the chief biological wastewater treatment technologies (Hoa et.ah, 2003) and is frequently used in wastewater treatment for the removal of organic compounds (Lim and Bai, 2003). Activated sludge consists of biological floes, which are intricate aggregates comprised of an assortment of microorganisms, including bacteria (WilÃ©n et.a l, 2003), organic fibres, and inorganic particles embedded in a highly charged polymeric network, known as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Frolund et.al., 1996; Jorand et al., 1998; WilÃ©n et.al, 2003). Microbial flocculation is a k ^ factor in the solid-liquid separation that takes place in a clarifier in the activated sludge process and its settling performance must be adequate to attain efficient solid-liquid separation. EPS are the main components of the activated sludge floc matrix (Hoa e ta l, 2003) and are composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other polymeric compounds in the intracellular space of microbial aggregates at or outside the cell surface (Neyens et.aL, 2004). EPS are essential in wastewater treatment as a result of their significance in pollutant removal from wastewater (Dignac et a l, 1998), bioflocculation (floc formation), bacterial attachment, biofilm structure and function (Wolfaardt et a l, 1999; Lim and Bai, 2003), and floc properties, such as settling and dewatering (Bura et a l, 1998). EPS are involved in cellular associations, bacterial nutrition, interaction of bacteria with their bio-physicochemical environment, and they have an effect on the macroenvironment (Wolfaardt et a l, 1999; Lim and Bai, 2003; Geesey and Van Ommen Kloeke, 2005). Previous studies indicate that protein is the major constituent in EPS (Frolund et a l, 1996; Liao et a l, 2001) and is the most important EPS component for flocculation (Higgins and

Novak, 1997; Jorand et a l, 1998). EPS contains several functional groups {e.g., hydroxyl and negatively charged carboxyl groups) that may possibly bind through specific proteinpolysaccharide interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and ionic interactions (Higgins and Novak, 1997; Jorand et ah, 1998; Gomer, 2003). The predominant constituents of EPS comprise of proteins and polysaccharides (Jahn and Nielsen, 1995; Frolund et ah, 1996; Dignac et ah, 1998; Liu and Fang, 2002; Harshey, 2003), which suggests a possible proteinpolysaccharide interaction within the EPS (Higgins and Novak, 1997). Furthermore, many proteins in the EPS involved in the protein-polysaccharide interactions may be prokaryoticaUy glycosylated. The interest in prokaryotic glycoproteins in the EPS is due to the fact that most of the characterization of glycosylated proteins was done on eukaryotic organisms (Sandercock, 1994; Suzuki et ah, 1995); however, now it is established that glycosylation occurs in all domains of life (Moens and Vanderleyden, 1997; Schaffer et ah, 2001). The significance of prokaryotic glycoproteins in the EPS arises firom the various biological functions which prokaryotic glycoproteins execute, including enzymatic catalysis, lubrication, surface protection, structural support, and cell adhesion (Wagh and Bahl, 1981). Some of the prokaryotic glycoproteins include surface-associated S-layer proteins, flagellins, pUlins, and fimbriaes (Moens and Vanderleyden, 1997; Schaffer et ah, 2001), which may be present in the microbial floc EPS. Therefore, glycoproteins in the EPS may explain microbial floc structure. EPS play an important role in floc and biofilm structure, activity and performance in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs); nevertheless, various bacterial EPS exoproteins and exopolysaccharides have been given insufficient attention to the identity o f structure and

function of these EPS constituents. Consequently, the specific physicochemical characteristics of EPS are still not entirely clear (Robinson et al., 1984; Liss et ah, 1996).

1.2 Research Objectives
The aim of this research was to gain a better understanding regarding the nature of EPS proteins, and reveal if the majority of the protein-polysaccharide interactions in the EPS are through glycosylation. This may assist in controlling the bioflocculation and improve solid-liquid separation in biological wastewater treatment. The ultimate goal of the floc analysis was to be able to manipulate floes in order to achieve floes that settle well, have good dewatering characteristics and are highly active, in order to improve the solid-liquid separation and dewatering in biological wastewater treatment (WilÃ©n et.al., 2003). The underlying hypothesis of this study is that proteins in the EPS are strongly associated with polysaccharides through non-covalent associations and possibly through glycosylation. The motivation for this research is that these EPS proteins are not easily extracted or resolved employing standard purification procedures due to many interactions within the EPS matrix. Therefore, these interactions must be broken and the EPS protein must be purified and extracted fi'om the activated sludge EPS. The goal of this research was to resolve the protein fraction in the activated sludge EPS by describing a novel purification, isolation and extraction method. Furthermore, this study attempts to demonstrate that a considerable portion of the EPS proteins consists of glycoproteins. The eventual goal was to characterize the EPS proteinaceous material by either chemical, physical or enzymatic methods and thus approximate the EPS protein molecular weight and

composition. Determination of proteins in the EPS may assist in elucidating the structure of the EPS. The four specific objectives established to reach the overall objective were to: 1. Investigate the ability to isolate, separate and purify the EPS proteins fi'om microbial activated sludge floc EPS. 2. To estimate the extent of glycosylation in the microbial EPS matrix. 3. Identify the microbial activated sludge EPS proteins.

4. Gain a better understanding of the fiinction of EPS proteins on the floc structure and formation in the activated sludge by assessing the nature of the protein and its function.

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 Microbial Sludge Floes Naturally occurring microbial floes are important in influencing the eflSciency of the solid-liquid phase process streams in the engineered biological systems. (Seka and Verstraete, 2003; Chu and Lee, 2004; Daims, 2005; Geesey and Kloeke, 2005; Jarvis et a l, 2005). Poor floe stability causes a rise in turbidity of the wastewater effluent (Liao et a l, 2002) and thus the floe structure is alleged to control flocculation and dewatering behaviours of the biomass (Jin et a l, 2003).

2.1.1 Sludge Floe Significance Flocculation is fundamental for mediating the physical, chemical, and biological properties of suspended floes as well as the aquatic and engineered system as a whole (Droppo et a l, 2005). In wastewater and drinking water research, it is crucial to understand the fUnctionstructure relationships of floes, in order to resolve such problems as poor settling sludge (Liss et a l, 2005), which occurs in the secondary clarifier of wastewater treatment plant (Schmid et a l, 2003). Poor settling sludge stems fi-om two chief problems, which include filamentous or nonfilamentous sludge bulking and poor sludge flocculation (i.e. dispersed growth, pinpoint floes, and foaming or scum formation) (Rittmann and McCarty, 2000; Jin et a l, 2003). Filamentous bulking arises fi-om excessive growth of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge, diminishing settling properties and effluent quality of the sludge (Slijkhuis, 1983; Andreasen and Nielsen, 1997; Jin et a l, 2003; Martins et a l, 2004). Non-filamentous bulking and pinpoint floes arise fi-om excess EPS in activated sludge floes (Urbain et a l, 1993). Foaming

or scum formation arises from the presence o f Nocardia sp. and/or Microihrixparvicella or by non-degradable surfactants (Martins et al., 2004).

2.1.2 Sludge FIoc Structure Typical microbial Hoc is 25-1000 mm in diameter and floe constituents, such as bacteria, are approximately 0.5-5 pm in diameter (Li and Ganczarczyk, 1990; Snidaro et a l, 1997). The sludge floes have a loose structure (Wingender et a l, 1999), which is composed of bacteria, fun^, protozoa, organic fibres, inorganic particles, and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Figure 2.1) (Li and Ganczarczyk, 1990; Jorand et a l, 1995; Frolund et a l, 1996; Wingender et al., 1999).

Figure 2.1 Microbial floc composition (Adapted from Keiding and Nielsen, 1997).

The majority of activated sludge floc is comprised of heterotrophic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Flavoracterium, Alcaligenes, Arthrobacter, Citromonas and Zooglea, which may be accountable for the floc formation (Dias and Bhat, 1964). The microbial floe's structure is highly irregular with microbial communities varying considerably, depending on the operating conditions of the activated sludge process (Li and Ganczarczyk, 1990; Sheng et a l, 2006). There are several proposed models on the floc structure

(Parker et a l, 1972; Keiding and Nielsen, 1997; Liao et a l, 2002; Sbeng et a l, 2006). One of these models is a polymer-bridging (filament backbone) model (Parker et a l, 1972; Sheng et al, 2006), which proposes that microbial sludge floc is a multi-layer structure with two distinct regions; outer and inner (Figure 2,2). The outer fi-action of sludge floc is loose and layered, entangled in EPS that may be readily extracted. The inner Abaction sludge floc is stable and firmly attached, which may only dissociate under highly adverse environment (Sheng et a l, 2006). The bacteria attach to each other (microstructure) and the filament backbone (macrostructure) by polymer bridge bonds (Parker et a l, 1972; Parker, 2005; Sheng et a l, 2006). Liao et a l (2002) proposed that the floc structure is affected by settling retention time (SRT). Therefore, at lower growth rate and hence higher SRT, the floe's inner EPS region is more hydrophobic and thus is more compact than at lower SRT at which the floe's inner EPS region is more difluse (Figure 2.2).

2.1.3 Microbial Floc Physicochemical Properties For good settling and dewatering, large and dense floes are desirable (Liao et a l, 2006). The most significant parameters that affect size, structure and settleabUity of the microbial floes are solid retention time (SRT), dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), mixed liquor suspended solids concentration (MLSS), and sludge volume index (SVI) (Eriksson and Hardin, 1984; WilÃ©n and BalmÃ©r, 1999; Liao et a l, 2006). SRT determines the characteristics of the sludge produced. Liao et a l (2001) studied the influence of SRT on the EPS and physicochemical properties of sludge, including hydrophobicity and surface charge using laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). The study demonstrated that EPS concentration was not dependent on SRT. The sludge surface was

more hydrophobic and less negatively charged at higher SRTs (16 and 20 days) than at lower SRTs (4-9 days). Liao et al. (2006) studied the eflfect of SRT (4-20 days) on sludge floc structure, size distribution and morphology in SBRs. The results showed no clear relationship between SRT and floc size. However, sludge floes at lower SRTs (4-9 days) were more irregular and variable than at higher SRTs (16 and 20 days). High dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is important for improvement of EPS production by microorganisms and thus improvement in bioflocculation. Unlike high DO, low DO levels (< 2.0 mg/1) in the mixed liquor were found to lead to poor settling properties and turbulent effluent (SÃ¼rÃ¼cÃ¼ and Dilek, 1990; WilÃ©n and BalmÃ©r, 1999). The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration measures the amount of suspended solids in the effluent. Even though EPS concentration is key in obtaining successful floc-particle aggregation, its levels do not need to be at maximum in order to obtain the best effluent quality. Some authors reported that the effluent suspended solids discharged from fiiUscale plant are negatively affected by increases in the MLSS levels (Chapman, 1983; Wahlberg e/a/., 1994). The sludge volume index (SVI) measures the morphology and physical characteristics of activated sludge (Schmid et ah, 2003; Liao et ah, 2006) and establishes the required sludge recirculation rate for calculation of the MLSS concentration needed in the aeration tank. The SVI is defined as the volume (ml) occupied by 1 gram of activated sludge following the settling the aerated liquor after 30 minutes. The efficiency of the settling will depend upon initial settling rate and the activated sludge characteristics (Dick and Vesilind, 1969). Therefore, the results of SVI cannot be used to predict settling behaviour in full-scale plants with complete confidence (Dick and Vesilind, 1969).

2.1.4 Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) Microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are high molecular-weight metabolic products accumulating on the bacterial cell surface (Frolund et a l, 1996) and the construction materials for microbial aggregates such as biofilms, floes and sludge (Flemming and VWngender, 2001; Sheng e t a l, 2006). These biosynthetic polymers vary in quantity and composition of its constituents (range fi-om 10-90%) depending on the growth conditions and environmental stresses (Christensen and Characklis, 1990). The EPS may be actively excreted fi-om the floc or biofilm organisms, absorbed fi-om the medium or they are a product of cellular lysis (Jahn and Nielsen, 1995).

2.1.4.1 Microbial Sludge EPS Significance EPS in floes, biofllms and biological sludges can be both harmflil and valuable. Accumulation of EPS may cause biofouling, biocorrosion of metals, and bioweathering. EPS have been implicated as an important cause of membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors. EPS in the water phase is crucial for the filterability of activated sludge (Evenblij and van der Graaf 2004). Sorption properties o f EPS are valuable for water purification (Brown and Lester, 1980). Furthermore, EPS hold a great biotechnolo^cal potential (Flemming and \^ g e n d e r, 2001) and have an important commercial use in the industry such as production of Dextran derived Sephadex products for the use in gel filters and chromatography media (Sutherland, 1998). EPS is also essential to the flocculation, settleability and dewatering of activated sludge (Jia et aly 1996; Keiding and Nielsen, 1997; Liao et a l, 2001; Mikkelsen and Keiding, 2001; Shin et.al, 2001; Liu and Fang, 2002; WilÃ©n et.al, 2003).

2.1.4.2 Microbial Sludge EPS Structure and Ecological Aspects EPS can be classified into two types: tight capsules (bound) that closely bind cells and loosely attached (soluble) slime secretions (Zhang et a l, 1999; Liss et a l, 2005). Unlike slime EPS, capsular EPS are involved in attachment (Liss et a l, 2005). Researchers have overlooked the importance of EPS until recently, studying mainly subcultured individual bacterial strains in pure cultures using artificial growth media. Under these laboratory culture conditions the bacterial isolates may not produce EPS given that EPS are not essential for bacteria when the EPS loss does not impair cell growth or viability (Wingender et a l, 1999; Liu and Fang, 2002).

10

Bacteria spend a considerable amount of its carbon and energy (more than 70%) in manufacture of EPS (Liss et a l, 2005). This suggests that EPS plays a significant role in the performance of microbial communities and their arrangement (Liss et a l, 2005). It was found that in natural environments EPS production functions as carbon and energy reserve during starvation (Wingender et a l, 1999; Liu and Fang, 2002). The activated sludge EPS have two diffÃ©rent origins: one fi-om the activated sludge bacterial cells (due to metabolism and cell autolysis) and another fi-om compounds in the incoming wastewater (Frolund et a l, 1996). Activated sludge EPS is a main sludge floc constituent keeping the floc together in a three-dimensional matrix (Sheng et al., 2006).

2.1.4 3 EPS Constituents EPS are a blend of diflferent polymers such as proteins, polysaccharides, uronic acids and nucleic acids (Table 2.1) (Frolund et a l, 1996; Neu, 1996; Neu and Lawrence, 1999; Liu and Fang, 2002). These constituents contain functional groups that may participate in the various interactions that keep the floc structure together (Liu and Fang, 2002). Polysaccharide is the predominant constituent in the EPS of many pure cultures (Liu and Fang, 2002), comprised of both neutral and acidic sugars (Sutherland, 1990). EPS polysaccharide plays an important role for the structure in biofilms (Jahn and Nielsen, 1995). Protein is found in substantial quantities in the sludges of many wastewater treatment reactors (Liu and Fang, 2002) and it may be significant in aggregate structure stabilization (Laspidou and Rittmann, 2002). Less is known about other constituents found in the EPS, which include lipids (Goodwin and Forster, 1985; Bura e / n r / . ,
1 9 9 8 ),

nucleic acids (Urbaine/a/., 1993; Bura e/a/., 1998) and humic

compounds (Frolund e / n r / . . 1995).

Knowing the composition o f EPS is key in order to determine several signiGcant properties of floc and biofilm including density, porosity, difiusivity, strength, elasticity, fiictional resistance, thermal conductmty, and metabolic activity. Additional information about their constituents vnll contribute to a better understanding of the physical and physiological behaviour of floes and biofllms in environmental systems (Zhang et a!., 1999) in order to be able to improve their manipulation to attain more favourable floes (e.g., floes which settle well, have good dewatering characteristics and have high fimctionality in terms of activity) (WilÃ©n, 2003).

12

2.2 EPS Proteins EPS proteins contain such carboxyl containing groups as aspartic and glutamic acids (Kggins and Novak, 1997), which contribute to a high level of negative charge in the EPS (Dignac et a l, 1998; Harshey, 2003) and thus may play a key role in floc structure stability (H ig ^ s and Novak, 1997; Jorand e ta l, 1998; Laspidou and Rittmann, 2002). The protein involvement in floc formation is explained by hydrophobic interactions (Jorand et a l, 1998) and by cation bridging (Corner, 2003). Previous studies indicate that since the EPS is ionically linked to divalent cations such as calcium, protein may be involved in sludge settleability (Urbain et a l, 1993). Therefore, knowing more about the proteins in the EPS, which constitute a large portion of EPS in activated sludge Docs (Frolund et a l, 1996; Liao et al, 2001), may lead to resolution of numerous problems caused by EPS in activated sludge systems. For instance, characterization and isolation of EPS proteins extracted from activated sludge systems can assist to better understand the role of protein in bioDocculation (H ig ^ s and Novak, 1997).

2.3 EPS Protein Interactions A number of classes of proteins are present in the exocellular environment of bacteria (e.g., extracellular enzymes, proteinaceous S-layers, lectins, intracellular protein from cell lysis or cell wall turnover, or polypeptide capsular material). The exoceUular protein extracted from activated sludge samples could be from a mixture of these sources (Higgins and Novak, 1997). EPS contains several functional groups {e.g., hydroxyl and negatively charged carboxyl groups) which may possibly bind through van der Waals forces (Nielsen et a l, 1996), electrostatic binding with bivalent cations {e.g., Ca^^and (Frolund et a l, 1996), hydrogen bonds

13

(Frolund et a l, 1996), hydrophobic interactions (Frolund et a i, 1996; Higgins and Novak, 1997), and in some cases covalent bonds {e.g., disulfide bonds in proteins) (Emerson and Ghiorse, 1993; Higgns and Novak, 1997; Jorand et a l, 1998; Gomer, 2003). Because the predominant constituents of EPS comprise of proteins and polysaccharides (Jahn and Nielsen, 1995; Frolund et a l, 1996; Dignac et al., 1998; Liu and Fang, 2002; Harshey, 2003), the majority of proteins in EPS may possibly bind through specific protein-polysaccharide interactions (Higgins and Novak, 1997). Furthermore, a substantial portion of these proteins in the EPS that are involved in the protein-polysaccharide interactions may be prokaiyotically glycosylated (Goodwin and Forster, 1985; King and Forster, 1990).

2.4 EPS Glycoproteins Glycoproteins, as a class of biomolecules, present a number of differences in structure and function fi'om non-glycosylated proteins (Wagh and Bahl, 1981; Robertson and Kennedy, 1996). The transformation of a protein into a glycoprotein involves glycosylation of the peptide chain during biosynthesis. Thus, glycoprotein is a protein in which one or more saccharides are covalently attached to the peptide chain. The nature of covalent bond that links the carbohydrate to the peptide chain is a major aspect of the structural uniqueness of glycoproteins (Wagh and Bahl, 1981). Glycoproteins are ever-present in nature (Maley et a l, 1989) {e.g., animals, plants, and microorganisms). Glycoproteins have also been established in the extra- and intracellular fluids, cormective tissue, and cellular membranes (Wagh and Bahl, 1981). Of all biologically occurring macromolecules, glycoproteins, which consist of carbohydrate moieties covalently linked to a polypeptide backbone, represent the most varied assembly, ranging firom substances in which the

14

carbohydrate component represents less than 1% of the total weight to those in which it corresponds to over 80% of the total molecule. The three types of sugars that commonly occur in glycoproteins include neutral sugars (e.g., galactose, mannose, glucose, and fucose), amino sugars (e.g., N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine) and acidic sugars (e.g., sialic acids) (Komfeld and Komfeld, 1976; Wagh and Bahl, 1981).

2.4.1 Protein Glycosylation The glycosylation of proteins is a complex ordered biological pathway which is more abundant and structurally varied than all other types of post-translational modifications combined (Hart, 1992). Furthermore, protein glycosylation is a highly specific process (MeynialSalles and Combes, 1996) dependent upon protein sequence, cellular phenotype, and the physiological enwronment (Gumming, 1992). Glycosylation can affect signal transduction and cell-cell communication properties and hence influence critical cell decisions (e.g., regulation of diflferentiation and apoptosis) (Murrell, 2004). Modification of oligosaccharide part of a glycoprotein (glycan) can lead to a modification of the activity of the glycoprotein (Meynial-Salles and Combes, 1996). The biosynthesis of glycans is not template-driven and there is no mechamsm for proofi"eading and correcting differently glycosylated biomolecules. The structure o f glycans depends on the competition of glycosylating enzymes for the same substrate, substrate specificity of these enzymes and substrate availability. Consequently, glycoproteins are created in a number of forms (glycoforms) that have the same peptide backbone, but vary in nature and site of glyco^lation (Khmelnitsky, 2004).

15

Consistent with the nature of glycosidic bonds, glycosylated proteins encompass NUnked (amide group of aspara^es) and 0-linked (hydroxyl groups of amino acids such as serine, threonine, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine) residues (Ploegh and NeeÃes, 1990; Suzuki e/a/., 1995).

2.4.1.1 N-Glycosylation ^-linked glycosylation is imperative for correct protein folding and for glycoprotein function (Shi and Elliott, 2004), and is the most abundant naturally occurring glycan attachment to proteins (Spiro, 2002), The reaction is extremely specific and occurs only at asparagine (Asn) embedded in the consensus sequence Asn-Xxx-Ser/Thr, where Xxx is any amino acid except proline (Pro), Ser is serine and Thr is threonine (Figure 2.3) (Khmelnitsky, 2004).

The entire A^-glycosylation process occurs co-translationally, during protein ^ th e sis, but prior to the final protein molecule formation and adoption of its conformation. Oligosaccharyltransferase (GST) is a highly complex membrane-bound multi-enzyme complex consisting o f at least nine subunits. GST concentration in tissues is very low, and it is difiQcult to isolate (Meynial-Salles and Combes, 1996). In combination with the virtual unav^ability of the en^rme and its sophisticated glycosyl donor, this makes GST of little practical value for in vitro glycoprotein synthesis (Khmelnitsky, 2004).

24.1.2 O-GIycosylation 0-Glycosylation of proteins is normally a less complicated process than .AT-glycosylation, given that there is no need for a complex lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor for transfer to protein. The initiating event in 0-glycosylation is the transfer of ^^acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) fi-om UDP-GalNAc to Ser or Thr in the polypeptide chain. However, unlike Nglycosylation, a consensus sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain has not been found for GalNAc addition, although several prognostic algorithms have been created (Elhammer et al., 1999). The reaction is catalyzed by a polypeptide A-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the addition of the initiating monosaccharide to the protein in the process of O-glycosylation, and occurs post-translationally (Meyraal-Salles and Combes, 1996; Elhammer et a l, 1999). A^-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase takes place in an assortment of isozyme forms, has a high tolerance to variations in amino acid sequences flanking Ser or Thr in the polypeptide c h ^ and demonstrates a good stability in purified form (Elhammer ei a l, 1999; Wang et a l, 1992). The enzyme is challenging to isolate and it is not commercially available (Khmelnitsl^, 2004).

2.4.1.3 EPS Prokaryotic Glycoproteins Glycoproteins were found to be the main components of eukaryotic cells (Suzuki et a l, 1995), but in the last decades, many prokaryotic glycoproteins have also been identified (Sandercock, 1994; Benz and Schmidt, 2002). In addition to the inddence of glycosylated enzymes, antigens and other cell envelope components, surface layer (S-layer) glycoproteins represent the best-studied examples of glycosylated prokaryotic proteins. The prokaryotic glycoprotein studied in greatest detail is the cell surface glycoprotein of the archaebacterium Halobacterium halobium (Wieland, 1988). Significance of the prokaryotic glycoproteins is mainly due to the assorted biolo^cal functions that they execute. These incorporate, along with others, enzymatic catalysis, lubrication, surface protection, structural support, and cell adhesion (Wagh and Bahl, 1981). The glycoproteins in the EPS may explmn the rigidity of the EPS and its role in floc formation and floc structure.

2.5 Methods Employed in the Analysis and Characterization of EPS Proteins This section includes a literature review on the potential methods that may be employed in EPS extraction, EPS protein purification and EPS protein characterization. The protein purification methods mentioned have been used on complex protein samples, such as plants and blood serum and thus offer a reasonable comparison.

2.5.1 EPS Extraction Procedure Quantification of EPS, such as determining the composition and the amount o f different EPS compounds present in a sample, depends a great deal on the extraction procedure used

18

(Fralund et al., 1996; Liu and Fang, 2002). There is no universal method for quantitative EPS extraction process recogmzed thus far; hence, making it challen^g to significantly compare and inteipret published results (Liu and Fang, 2002). Consequently, a suitable approach must be chosen after thorough evaluation of requirements and available procedures. Table 2.2 lists several EPS extraction methods fi' om activated sludge that may be employed and compares the extraction eSBcienty of the methods. Physical extraction techniques that have been used previously for their low generation of cell lysis products include high-speed centrifugation, ultrasonication and heating (Horan and Eccles, 1986). The general chemical EPS extraction techniques include uses of alkaline (ammonium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide), sulfuric acid, EDTA, boiling benzene and formaldehyde (Liu and Fang, 2002; Liss e ta l, 2005). It is imperative to generate negligible cell lysis, mmntain cell membrane structure undamaged and release most of the EPS biopolymers for successful EPS extraction (Wingender et a l, 1999). From Table 2.2, it is observed that sonication, heating, steaming, and NaOH treatments give the lowest amount of extraction efGcienty (Brown and Lester, 1980; Urbain et a l, 1993; Frolund et a l, 1996), and sonication and heating possibly cause cell lysis (hence the high amount of protein and polysaccharide). The NaOH treatment gives relatively high amount of protein but with low extraction eflSciency. The alkaline treatments cause many charged groups to be ionized (i.e. proteins and polysaccharides) as a result of low isoelectric points (pH 4-6) and thus causing strong repulsion between EPS within the matrix and higher water solubility of the compounds. However, this method causes dÃ©naturation of proteins by pH and vast amount of cellular disruption, as concluded by Brown and Lester (1980). NaOH-formaldehyde treatment gives the best extraction eflSciency and relatively high amount of protein compared to formaldehyde-ultrasound treatment (Table 2.2) (Liu and Fang,

19

2002). However, the NaOH treatment as stated previously ionizes charged groups in the microbial floc EPS and denatures the EPS proteins. Formaldehyde used in the EPS extraction treatment interferes with protein analysis. Therefore, to remove the formaldehyde firom the treated samples, dialysis must be employed. Dialysis utilizes a semipermeable membrane that permits the passage of smaller molecules (e.g., formaldehyde) and excludes the passage of larger molecules (e.g., protein) (Pierce Biotechnology, 2004a). The disadvantages of using dialysis are that it is designed for large protein volumes with minimum samples and the procedure takes days to accomplish. Dilute protein samples, such as EPS protein samples, will produce very low recovery (Bonomo and Swaney, 1988). EDTA demonstrates a high EPS extraction eflSciency (Table 2.2) (Liu and Fang, 2002) by removing divalent cations fi'om floc. However the use of EDTA as EPS extraction treatment removes such constituents as lipopolysaccharides fi'om the cell wall and as a result leads to the cell wall instability (Johnson and Perry, 1976). Cation exchange resin (CER) procedure Ã¿ves a high amount of protein and carbohydrate with high extraction efficiency (Table 2.2) (Frolund et a i, 1996). However, according to Liu and Fang (2002), CER procedure gives a low amount of protein and carbohydrate with moderate extraction efficiency. The discrepancy in EPS composition may be due to varied activated sludge sources studied (Urbain et al., 1993), diflferent extraction techniques utilized (Brown and Lester, 1980) and the diflferent analytical tools employed (Urbain et al., 1993). CER procedure employs both a physical and chemical means of extraction, has been widely acknowledged and utilized for EPS extraction fi'om activated sludge because it has been reported to be twice as high in yield, providing high extraction efficiency with little or no cell lysis and exopolymer disruption than other fi'equently used procedures (Jahn and Nielsen, 1995; Frolund et al., 1996; Nielsen et

20

a/., 1996; Dura et a l, 1998; Zhang et al, 1999; Liss et al., 2005). The CER extraction technique detaches divalent cations (e.g., Ca^^ and from the EPS matrix and substitutes them with

monovalent cations, thereby reducing EPS stability and separating it from the cellular material (Jahn and Nielsen, 1995; Frolund et a l, 1996; Wingender et a l, 1999; Liss et a l, 2005).

2.5.2 EPS Protein Identification and Characterization 2 5.2.1 EPS Protein Extraction from Activated Sludge One of the difficulties in proteomics is the complex matrices (Romijin et a l, 2003) including floc EPS. To study such proteins, the sample must be purified by protein extraction and separation methods. (Michalsld and Shiell, 1999).

2.5.2.1.1 Buffer Additives Proteins are extremely heterogeneous molecules that require stable pH environment (Ahmed, 2005). The first choice to make for an extraction bufier is determination of the nature and pH of the desired buffer. It is favourable to avoid time and protein loss caused by additional buffer exchange step. The most common buffers used are listed in Table 2.3. Insoluble proteins will cause artifacts and sample loss. Therefore, protein solubilization must be employed in order to break interactions that aggregate or precipitate the protein out of solution (Rabilloud 1996; Berkelman et a l, 2004). In order to remove the strongly bound proteins fi'om the EPS matrix, improve stability of the EPS proteins and keep them in solution, it is necessary to employ chemical additives in the extraction buffer to facilitate dissociation (Pierce Biotechnology, 2004a). The chemical additives employed for sample solubilization include such compounds as acids, bases, salts, chelating agents, detergents, chaeotropic agents, organic agents, and reducing agents (Berkelman e ta l, 2004). Table 2.4 lists various chemical additives, their purpose and their optimum concentration. The pH of a solution will have a strong effect on protein solubility. Typically proteins are optimally soluble at high pH; nonetheless, various proteins have different optimum pH values and a range of proteins will be extracted at different pH values (Berkelman et a l, 2004).

23

Ionic strength also has a strong effect on protein solubility and thus various salts {e.g. 150 mM NaCl) are typically added to sample preparation solutions for protein extraction (Berkelman et a l, 2004). The major cations found in activated sludge include sodium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Uibmn et al. (1993) have found that protein in the floc and EPS have a strong affinity for calcium and magnesium cations. Murthy and Novak (2001) have demonstrated that ferric and sodium cations coagulated protein and carbohydrate through potential adsorptive interactions. Detergents disrupt hydrophobic interactions between and within proteins and bring insoluble proteins into solution. The usual concentrations of detergents used are 1-4% and they are typically categorized according to their charge in solution. There are three types of detergents, including anionic (i.e. sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)), cationic (ethyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (ETAB)), neutral (i.e. TRITONÂ® X-100), or zwitterionic (i.e. 3-[(3cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfbnate (CHAPS)). SDS detergent is frequently used for its ability to quickly and effectively solubilize proteins (Berkelman et a l, 2004). Chaeotropic agents disrupt hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between and within proteins. Typically, Chaeotropes are used in high concentration (neutral urea: 5-9 M; charged guanidine hydrochloride (GHCl): 5-8 M) in order to disrupt secondary protein structure and bring insoluble proteins into solution (Berkelman e ta l, 2004). Reducing agents are frequently used to cleave disulfide bond crosslinks within proteins and between protein subunits. Common reducing agents include sulfhydryl (dithiothreitol (DTT); dithioerythritol (DTE); P-mercaptoethanol) and phosphine (tiibutylphosphine (TBP); triscarboxyethylphosphine (TCEP)) reducing agents (Berkelman et a l, 2004).

2.5 2.1.2 Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography Reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is a powerful technique used for protein and peptide separation (Tarr and Crabb, 1983). RPLC separates proteins and peptides vdth various hydrophobicity based on their reversible interaction and binding vith the hydrophobic surface of a chromatographic medium (i.e. silica beads) (Mant and Hodges, 1991). The downside to using RPLC is the denaturing of proteins due to the presence of strong organic solvents (Mant and Hodges, 1991).

2.5.2.1.3 Protein Precipitation The goal of EPS protein extraction procedure is to prepare a clarified sample of EPS protein fi'om the source material, as well as removal of particulate matter or other contaminants, which are not compatible vith chromatography or Tricine-PAGE. The EPS sample contains impurities that may reduce protein solubility. Therefore, it may be beneficial to remove the nonprotein impurities by protein precipitation methods. Protein precipitation methods are used to concentrate proteins or eliminate interferences before electrophoresis or protein determination. It must be noted however that in almost all the cases the proteins vdll be denatured and will lose their biological activity (Strop and Brunger, 2005). There are several protdn precipitation protocols available in the literature. However, the three protocols commonly used are the Chloroform-Methanol, Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and Phenol-Ether (PE) protocols (Sauve et ah, 1995; Ziegler et al., 1997; Aguilar et a l, 1999). These methods employ chemicals in order to effectively precipitate and purify proteins in a given sample.

27

2.S.2.2 Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis For purification and separation of small amounts of proteins in a sample, polyaciylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) offers best results and excellent resolution (Michalsld and Shiell, 1999). PAGE alters the pore size consistent with the nature of the proteins separated (Gersten, 1996). PAGE is also used for its compatibility with mass spectrometry (MS) for subsequent protein characterization (Chevalier et a/., 2004). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is fi'equently employed for separation of proteins based on their molecular mass (Romijin et a l, 2003). However, the SDS-PAGE suffers from poor resolution and streaking of proteins below 20 kDa (Schagger and von Jagow, 1987). Tricine-PAGE gives a superior resolution of proteins in the range of 5 and 20 kDa (Schagger and von Jagow, 1987). To detect proteins in polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, Coomassie Brilliant Blue and silver nitrate are the most frequent techniques of protein staining, with sensitivity ranges of about 1 mg for Coomassie Brilliant Blue and 1 ng for silver nitrate stain (Wray et al., 1981; Gradilone et al., 1998; Blackstock and Weir, 1999).

2.5.3 EPS Glycoprotein Detection A vast number of approaches exist for the detection, isolation and characterization of glycoproteins aiming at the identification of the covalent linkage between the carbohydrate and the polypeptide fi'action (SchÃ¢flfer et a l, 2001). Relatively few techniques that sensitively and reliably detect carbohydrate residues on proteins in polyacrylamide gels (Liu and Jiang, 1993; Steinberg et a l, 2001) are listed below.

28

2.5.3.1 FTSC Fluorescent Labeling Gao et a l (1997) have improved their method of detecting glycoproteins on SDS-PAGE by using a fluorescent probe, fluorescein 5-thiosemicarbazide (FTSC) (Molecular Probe), in solution before SDS-PAGE. The fluorescent bands o f the labeled glycoproteins may then be examined and analyzed in wet or diy gels under a UV lamp with a detection limit of 1-2 ng (Gao et a l, 1997). Nonetheless, this method is time consuming (staining takes approximately six hours) compared to periodic acid-Alcian blue stain which takes less than three hours to stain.

2.5.3.1 Periodic Acid--Alcian Blue Stain The conventional silver staining protocols only weakly stain heavily glycosylated proteins due to steric interferences. To overcome this, MoUer and Poulsen (1995) proposed a method for glycoprotein detection in SDS-PAGE by initial periodic acid oxidation/Alcian blue staining and subsequent staining with silver nitrate. Periodate is used to oxidize the carbohydrate groups and generate free aldehyde groups, making them detectable using Alcian blue staining. The Alcian blue stain is often used to stain acidic glycoproteins (Steinberg et a l, 2001) and detect up to 1.6 ng of glycoprotein (Moller and Poulsen, 1995). The results obtained are reproducible and obtained within three hours. Conversely, this procedure requires the use of potassium metabisulfite as a washing step during the prestaining of the gels.

2.S.3.3 Periodic Acid--SchilT Stain Doemer and White (1990) have developed a procedure for staining glycoproteins in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by use of periodic acid-Schifif (PAS) staining which became one of the most commonly practiced methods (Steinberg et a l, 2001). The glycols

29

present in the glycoproteins are first oxidized by periodic acid and then the chromogenic substrate, acid fuchsin sulfite, reacts with the aldehydes on the glycoproteins to create a fuchsia colour product. The PAS stain may detect 25-100 ng o f glycoproteins depending on the nature and degree o f glycosylation of the protein (Doemer and White, 1990) and the stain is specific for N- and 0-linked oligosaccharides.

2.S.3.4 Deglycosylation of EPS Glycoproteins Glycosylation often presents problems in protein analysis procedures because glycopeptides usually do not readily ionize during MS analysis, leading to inadequate spectral data. Moreover, proteolytic digestion of the native glycoprotein is fi-equently unfinished due to steric hindrance by oligosaccharides. Removal of the carbohydrate groups fi'om a glycoprotein prior to protein identification is preferred. For instance, remo\dng N-linked glycans fi'om glycoproteins is very valuable to remove or diminish heterogeneity for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis (Gates et a l, 2004). For entirely sequenced genomes, this alone may be adequate to identify the proteins in the complex. Deglycosylation of glycoproteins is important in elucidation of structure, function, and biosynthesis of biologically signiGcant glycoproteins. For such studies, it is imperative that the integrity of the polypeptide chain is maintained during deglycosylation (Thotakura and Bahl, 1987). Both chemical and enzymatic methods are available for removing oligosaccharides fi'om glycoproteins. Several authors have employed hydrazinolysis for removal of both W- and 0-linked sugars (Mizuochi, 1993; Patel et a l, 1993; Byers, et a l, 1999). The disadvantage of

30

hydra^olysis treatment is that it causes complete destruction of the protein component and is as a result not suitable if the recovery of the protein is desired (Harvey, 2001). A number o f papers mention 0-linked glycans release from glycoproteins by Pelimination with alkali and a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride (Slomiany et a/., 1984; Chiba et ah, 1993; Hong and Kim, 2000). This method also suffers from disadvantages, including the use ofborohydrate, which releases some W-linked glycans, and removal of Oacetyl groups (Harvey, 2001). Milder chemical method, which has been extensively used, is trifluoromethanosulfonic acid (TFMS) treatment (Sojar and Bahl, 1987; Edge, 2003). This method has been successfully used on 0-linked (Edge et a l, 1981; Florman and Wassarman, 1985; Herzberg et a l, 1985) and ^-linked glycans (Karp et a l, 1982; Harrison, 1983; Paxton et a l, 1987; Naim et a l, 1988). However, this method even when optimized, results in incomplete sugar removal and partial protein destruction (Thotakura and Bahl, 1987). However, when using the enzymatic method, complete sugar removal is achieved without any protein degradation (EMD Biosciences, 2005). A wide variety of specific glycosidases which cleave carbohydrates and oligosaccharide chains have been found to be potentially useful. Enzymatic deglycosylation can be brought about by exoglycosidases either used sequentially or in a mixture (Thotakura and Bahl, 1987; Benz and Schmidt, 2002). The most common enzyme used for release o f A^glycans is^-glycosidaseF (PNGase-F) (Harvey, 2001). Enqonatic deglycosylation of glycoproteins may be accomplished in-solution or in-gel digestion of glycoprotein samples followed by MS. Glycosylation sites and oligosaccharide heterogeneity in glycoproteins have been characterized based on a combination of nonspecific proteolysis using a pronase enzyme.

31

enzymatic deglycosylation using PNGase F enzyme, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (MALDI-FT MS) (An et ah, 1993). It has been identified that the peptide moiety of the glycopeptides to h&Xenopt4S laevis egg cortical granule lectin. Thus, the enzymatic deglycosylation method was found to be usefiil for determining protein site heterogeneity and structural heterogeneities of the oligosaccharide moiety of glycoproteins (An et ah, 1993). The native glycoproteins and the material obtmned after enzymatic deglycosylation may be analyzed on polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (SchÃ¢fiÃ¨r et ah, 2001; Kilz et ah, 2002). The separation is based on protein mass and a considerable reduction in molecular weight, and thus a rise in electrophoretic mobility, is a good indication that Asn-linked oligosaccharides have been fi-eed enzymatically (Tarentino et ah, 1989). The polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel may obtain the molecular weight of the glycoprotein, the glycoprotein's purity and homogeneity, and the degree of glycosylation (SchÃ¢fiÃ¨r et ah, 2001).

2.5.4 EPS Protein Identification Using Mass Spectrometry (MS) Due to numerous possible structural isomers in glycoproteins, a complete structural analysis is not possible. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a good technique for protein and glycoprotein structural analysis; however, the method is very insensitive when compared to mass spectrometry (MS) and chromatography (Harvey, 2001). MS is the best technique for structural analysis of proteins (Gygi and Aebersold, 2000) and especially A/^linked glycans (Harvey, 2001). The fi'agment-ion masses obtained on MS are unique identifiers for that peptide (Gy^ and Aebersold, 2000). The molecular weight of a protein is insufiScient for protein identification; thus, most approaches to protein identification rely on proteolysis of the separated protein with

32

trypsin and analysis o f the resulting peptides, often without any further separation (Blackstock and Weir, 1999). Database searching uses uninterpreted fragment-ion MS and a cross-correlation algorithm to compare the sequence obtained with the predicted spectra ^lackstock and Weir, 1999). These databases may be accessed via avmlable internet software tools (Hillenkamp et aL, 1991; Kellner, 2000). These tools include such molecular biology servers as EXPASY (www.expasy.ch; SIB Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics, Geneva, Switzerland), which is dedicated to analysis of protein sequences and structures as well as 2-D PAGE. Search engine MASCOT (www.matrixsdence.com; Matrix Sciences Ltd., London, UK) uses MS data to identify proteins fi'om primaiy sequence databases.

2.5.4.1 Tandem Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LS/ESI-MS/MS) MS is one of the most sensitive methods for protein and in particular glycoprotein analyses but it is unable to separate isomers. As a result, MS is used in combination with Wgh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) utilizing an electrospray (ESI) interface for total glycoprotein profiles (Harvey, 2001). The main feature of these alternative separation methods integrated with MS is the capability of a tandem mass spectrometer to collect sequence information fi'om a specific peptide, even if other peptides are present in the sample. When the mixtures are very complex, on-line reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is utilized to concentrate and separate the peptides before sequendng in the MS. Crude protein digestion and subsequent LC-ESI-ION TRAP approach has been a successfiilly utilized for yeast, rice, and wheat analysis (Washburn et al., 2001; Koller et al., 2002; Andon et al., 2002) and LCÃS-MS has been used in order to selectively detect

33

glycopeptides in proteolytic digests o f glycoproteins (Carr et al., 1991). Therefore, this approach may be able to successfully analyze EPS proteins in activated sludge floes.

2.5.4.2 Matrix-Assisted-Laser-Desorption-Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI MS) Mass spectrometers continue to develop, due to the requirement for improved sensitivity, higher mass accuracy and resolving power, enhanced duty (^cle and more effective fragmentation of peptides in tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) (Jensen, 2004). Fast atom bombardment (FAB) used to be the preferred choice for analysis of intact glycans but this method is not sensitive enough due to a high matrix background. Therefore, matrix-assistedlaser-desorption-ionization (MALDI) and ESI are favoured for proteomic study with a sensitivity of low pmole to high frnole range (Harvey, 2001). MALDI MS/MS methods are currently used for sequencing of post-translationally modified peptides (e.g., phosphopeptides (Lee et a i, 2001; Bennett et aL,
2002)

due to MALDI robustness and high sensitivity (Larsen et oL, 2002) and

usefulness in identifying the carbohydrate moiety (Stimson et aL, 1995). Currently there is a growing interest in combining MALDI MS/MS techniques vith miniaturized peptide separation techniques. In situ liquid-liquid extraction is an easy and quick approach for the separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides before MALDI MS and MS/MS. This technique may permit more efBcient detection and sequencing of modifled, hydrophobic peptides, especially for acylated peptides. Graphite columns allow capture of otherwise elusive hydrophilic peptides, such as phosphopeptides and glycopeptides, for their analysis by MS (Larsen et aL, 2 0 0 2 ). Moreover, capillary chromatography and electrophoresis have been interfaced to MALDI MS/MS in various ways (Mo and Karger, 2002) to facilitate indepth analysis of crude peptide mixtures (Larsen et aL, 2 0 0 2 ).

2.S.4.3 Matrix-Assisted-Laser-Desorption-IonizatÃ®on Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS is a widely used technique for sensitive and rapid identification of mixtures of peptides, crude extracts or large proteins separated by gel electrophoresis (Hillenkamp et a l, 1991; Blackstock and Weir, 1999; Gates et a l, 2004). This tool may be utilized in order to determine the molecular weights o f EPS glycoprotein released oligosaccharides. The drawback of this procedure is a possible poor mass resolution of glycoproteins. Based on the aforementioned review of various methods that may be utilized for EPS protein analysis and characterization, the next section will describe the methods chosen for this study in purification and identification of EPS proteins in activated sludge floes.

CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 3.1 Overview This study encompassed an extraction of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and EPS proteins obtained from microbial floes (Figure 3.1). Furthermore, the glycoprotein contribution to EPS structure was examined (Figure 3.1). This chapter describes the materials and methods employed during the present study, including experimental approach, extraction and chemical analysis of EPS, extraction and identification of EPS proteins, glycoprotein detection, and statistical analysis.

3.2 Experimental Approach Biomass samples were collected for this study from four parallel 2L glass laboratoryscale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) and full-scale Ashbridges Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) (formerly known as Toronto Main WWTP; Toronto, ON, Canada). The SBRs were run for a two-year period to obtain true stable conditions (Liu et aL, 2006). All of the stages in the activated sludge process occurred in the same vessel in SBRs. A single cycle consists of four steps, which include fill, aeration, settling, and withdrawal. Initially, the reactor was filled with wastewater. Subsequently, the biological reaction stage took place for 5 hours under mechanical aeration, where the nutrients in the wastewater are broken down by the activated sludge. Following the reaction stage, mixing and aeration stopped, and the solid-liquid separation stage occurred for 6 hours during which the solids in the sludge settled. Lastly, the top liquid effluent was drawn off and solids remained in the reactor.

The pH was controlled (7 . 0 +/-Q.2 ) by pH controllers (pH/ORP controller Model 5656GO, Cole Parmer, Canada) and by addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (0 .0 2 N). Air was introduced through a stone air diffijser as an oxygen supply and a magnetic stir bar was used for mixing the contents inside the reactor. Electronic timers controlled the four stages of the activated sludge process cycle in the SBRs. The SBRs were fed daily vnth 4*C ynthetic water containing glucose (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and inorganic salts (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) at diffÃ©rent COD:N:P ratios. Reactors 1 and 2 contained COD:N;P ratios of 100:5:1 and reactors 3 and 4 contained COD:N:P ratios of 100:5:0.1. The sludge retention time (SRT) of the reactors was 6 - 8 days. When the reactors were suspended, an aerobic sludge was obtained fi'om the Ashbridges Bay Treatment Plant (formerly known as Main Treatment Plant, Toronto, Ontario) and immediately utilized for EPS extraction to retmn sludge properties (Nielsen et aL, 1996; Bura ei aL, 1998).

3.3 Microbial Floe Physicochemical Properties Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration was measured in accordance with Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). MLSS is comprised of active biomass, non-active biomass, nonbiodegradable organic mass, and inorganic mass. An aliquot of well-mixed mixed liquor sample (5 mL) was filtered through a weighed standard glass-fibre filter (Whatman, 4 5 pm) and the retained solids on the filter were dried at 103-105Â°C for one-two hours. The MLSS presented the weight of the retained solids of the filter. Sludge volume index (SVI) was used to determine the separation and settling ability of the sludge prior to extraction of the EPS from activated sludge floes. The measurement was

38

taken in a

1 ,0 0 0

ml glass cylinder following sedimentation of the sludge after 30 minutes

according to the Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). Typically, the sludge with good stability contains SVI values o f less than 100 ml/g and poor sedimenting sludge has SVI values of above 100 ml/g (Martinez et al., 2004).

3.4 Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) 3.4.1 Cation Exchange Resin (CER) The cation ion exchange resin (DOWEXÂ® C-2 1 1 , Na^ form, 16-50 mesh) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA) method was employed for the extraction of EPS (Frolund et aL, 1996; Bura et aL, 1998). The total EPS concentration was measured as the total carbohydrate, protein and DNA given that these are the major constituents that represent the extracted EPS fi'action (Frolund et aL, 1996; Bura et aL, 1998; Liao et aL, 2001). An activated sludge was diluted to one fifth of the original mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration (determined by standard methods (APHA, 1995)) and washed at least three times ^ t h the EPS extraction buffer [Na3P04 ( 2 mN w/v), NaHzP0 4 (4 mN w/v), NaCi (9 niN w/v), KCl ( 1 mN w/v) in distilled deionized water (1 L, pH 7.0)] and centrifijged at 2 0 0 0 g for 5 tninutes at 4Â®C (lEC Model HN-S Centrifuge; Needham Heights, MA, USA). The exchange resin (after determination of the amount of MLSS in the washed sludge) was added to a washed sludge sample (45 mL) and mixed with a single blade paddle at 600 rpm for 2 hours at 4Â°C to minimize cell lysis (Frolund et aL, 1996). The mixture was then centriftiged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4Â°C (Hermle Labnet Z 323 K Centrifuge) to remove solids and filtrated through 0 .4 5 -um acetate cellulose membrane. The EPS fi' action was stored at -20Â°C for future chemical analysis of carbohydrates, proteins, DNA, and protein extraction.

39

3.4.2 Chemical Analyses of EPS The CER-extracted EPS was analyzed for total carbohydrates (Masuko et a l, 2005), proteins (Pierce Biotechnology, 2002), and DNA (Drunk et al, 1979) and EPS composition was determined by employing colorimetric methods. ELISA Plate Reader and SP6-500 UV spectrophotometer (Pye Unicam/Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) were utilized for protein and carbohydrate analyses. Fluorometer (Model
110,

G.K. Turner Associates,

USA) was used for DNA analysis. Ultrapure water was used as a blank solution. All chemicals were o f analytical grade. A standard curve was produced for each sample tested and concentrations were determined from the linear regression equation of the standard curve.

3.4.2.1 EPS Protein Concentration The protein concentration in microbial EPS was initially measured calorimetrically by the methods of Lowry et a l (1951), bicinchoninic acid (BCATM) (Pierce Biotechnology, 2002) and modified Bradford (1976) (Ghosh et a l, 1988), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution as a standard. However, BCA protein assay was found to be ideal for this study.

3.4.2.1.1 Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Procedure Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) (Smith et al., 1985; Tylianakis et a l, 1994; Pierce Biotechnology, 2002) protein assay, similar to Lowry et a l (1951) procedure, is based on its ability to reduce of Cu^^ to Cu^ by amides. The BCATM Protein Assay (Pierce Biotechnology, 2002) microplate procedure was employed based on bicinchoninic acid (BCA) for the colorimetric detection and measurement of the total protein. Bovine serum albumin ^ S A ) was

40

used to prepare a standard calibration curve (absorbance at 560 nm vs. protein concentration) for each unknown protein sample. An aliquot (25 pi) was pipetted into a microplate well (working range 20-2,000 pg/ml). Working reagent [50:1 ratio of BCATM Reagent A to BCATM Reagent B] was added to each well and the microplate was mixed thoroughly. The microplate was covered and incubated at 37Â°C for 30 minutes. The microplate was cooled to room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 560 nm on a plate reader. The BCA was determined to be the method of choice for total protein content in the EPS.

3 4.2.2 EPS Polysaccharide Concentration Both the anthrone method (Gaudy, 1962) and phenol-sulfuric acid procedure (Dubois et oi., 1956) are often employed in order to measure the concentration of total polysaccharides in EPS (Frolund et aL, 1996), vwth glucose as the standard and the amount of exocellular polysaccharide expressed as pg of glucose/ml of sample. The total polysaccharide concentration in microbial EPS was quantified calorimetrically by the Anthrone method (Gaudy, 1962) and phenol-sulfuric acid method (Masuko et ah, 2005) modified fi' om Dubois et al. (1956), using glucose as a standard.

3.4.2.2.1 Phenol-Sulfuric Acid Microplate Procedure The phenol-sulfuric acid approach employs EPS combined with 5% phenol in water and concentrated sulfiiric acid. In contrast to the Anthrone procedure, the phenol-sulfbric acid approach is very practical for the quantitative colorimetric microdetermination of methylated sugars, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. In addition, the phenol-sulfuric acid method is

41

simple, economical, rapid and sensitive with reproducible results (Dubois et oA, 1956), The phenol-suliiiric acid method was employed in a 96-well microplate format, which is specifically optimized for a smaller sample analysis. D-glucose was used to prepare a standard calibration curve and the procedure was carried out as described by Masuko et ai. (2005) with minor modifications. Fifty microliters of aliquot solution was added to a 96-well microplate. 50 ul of 5% (v/v) phenol (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ, USA) was added to the samples and mixed. 250 ul of concentrated sulfuric acid (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ, USA) was immediately added following phenol addition. The samples were incubated for 10 minutes at 37Â®C. The samples were measured spectrophotometrically by the use of an ELISA plate reader at 490 nm.

3.4.1.3 EPS DNA Concentration Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was measured by the use of a standard fluorescent DNA quantification kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and a Turner-Model
111

Fluorometer (Coleman Inc., Lorton, VA, USA). Calf thymus DNA was used to prepare a standard calibration curve. Hoechst dye was added to each sample in triplicate and the absorbance was measured employing 360 nm excitation filter and 460 nm emission filter.

3.5 EPS Protein Extraction and Purification In order to satisfy the objectives in this study, a flow chart of protein identification and characterization methodology was established (Figure 3.2). In order to remove EPS proteins from the complex and rigd EPS that surrounds the bacteria in activated sludge floes, some preliminaiy extraction steps must be conducted.

selected, the microbial EPS protein fraction should be extracted, separated, purified, and identified. The microbial EPS protein fraction would then be identified by the use of mass spectrometry. Initially, the experimental flow chart in Figure 3.2 was devised and later on it was translated into flow chart methodology in Figure 3.3. The ultimate goal of the separation and identification of indivndual proteins in the EPS matrix is to obtain a primaiy amino acid sequence in order to identify and characterize the unknown proteins and protein families in the microbial EPS. From the flow chart it may be observed that there are two steps for general protein identification; electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. These two methods can provide microscale analyses of peptides and proteins (Cohen and Chait, 1997). Initially, electrophoresis is employed for separation of complex protein mixtures and obtaining estimates of protein molecular masses (Cohen and Chait, 1997). Mass spectrometry provides a rapid, sensitive, and accurate determination of proteins and peptides (MÃ®chalski and Shiell, 1999). All experiments involving EPS protein extraction and purification were conducted in an ice-bath to ensure a temperature of approximately 4Â°C. A 1:100 dilution inhibitor cocktail P8340 (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA) mix (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), pepstatinA, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) was added prior to protein extraction process to prevent protein degradation.

3.5.1 Sources of Error The CER-extracted EPS from WWTP was assessed for potential induced lysis by rupturing the cells present in the activated sludge portion or examining the cells under Zeiss inverted microscope (Axiovert 2 0 0 , Carl Zeiss) at a magnification of400x, and comparing the

45

released proteins in the activated sludge to the possible EPS proteins from activated sludge floe. The EPS was tested for protein interferences originating from dust. The activated sludge and EPS were sonicated, heated with SDS (1-2% w/v), lysed with TRIZOLÂ® Reagent, and violently agitated to test for induced cell lysis proteins interferences.

3.5.1.1 Error from Dust A dust sample (30 mg), from five different locations in the laboratory room where the experiments were carried out, was boiled in l%-2% SDS for 10-15 minutes to solubilize and denature all proteins in the dust sample and these proteins were compared to the proteins in the EPS fraction and to the proteins in the activated sludge supernatant (sludge water). The sludge supernatant was found to contain a negli^ble amount o f protein, carbohydrate and DNA This finding is supported by Nielsen et a l (1996), and thus it was required to concentrate the sludge supernatant in order to visualize the proteins on Tricine-PAGE. It was observed that the overall protein pattern found in the dust sample does not match the possible activated sludge derived EPS protein pattern. However, the bands in the re^ons 67-70 kDa of the dust protein pattern coincided with the possible microbial EPS protein pattern (Appendbc F). Due to the variable nature of sludge, it is foreseeable that these keratin bands may be interferences from numerous potential sources (e.g., from laboratory or from WWTP eflQuent). To limit the interference from potential ambient dust sources within the laboratory environment, samples were handled under a flame or in the fumehood.

46

3 5.1.2 Error from Induced Cell Lysis To test for potential induced cell lysis, the biomass sample and CER-extracted EPS were sonicated with Dawe Soniprobe (Dawe Instruments Ltd., London, UK) at 60 W with a frequency of 20 Hz. The samples were sonicated with bursts lasting no longer than several seconds, with cooling on ice between bursts for a total of three minutes. The activated sludge and EPS were boiled in SDS ( 1 -2 % w/v) for 10-15 minutes. The activated sludge and EPS were lysed with TRIZOLÂ® Reagent (Molecular Probes/lnvitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) and/or violently agitated at 3000 g with Mini-Bead-Beater-8 TM (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA). In this method the samples were agitated with bursts lasting no longer than thirty seconds, with cooling on ice between bursts for a total of three minutes. The bead size of 0.1 mm was utilized for bacterial cell lysis. TRIZOLÂ®, Reagent (1 part TRIZOLÂ® to 10 parts sample) was found to be incompatible %dth the Tricine-PAGE system.

3.5.2 Separation of Intracellular and Exocellular Proteins in the EPS To separate possible intracellular proteins in the EPS and in the sludge supernatant from the exocellular protein fraction, the dried fractions were washed with ice-cold ethanol (80% w/v) or ice-cold SDS (0 . 1 % w/v) three to four times. The EPS tested was untreated (control), treated with only protease inhibitors, or treated with protease inhibitors and 2 mM DTT (concentrated by phenol-ether method).

3.5.3 Buffer Additives The protein buffer consisted of ultrapure water (Milli-Q water system, water quality 1718 MD'cm at room temperature) containing protease inhibitors at neutral pH. If necessary the pH

47

was adjusted to neutral by 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8 .8 . The initial preparation of protein extraction involved placing 0.5-1.5ml of CER-extracted EPS into a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) and speed drying the EPS sample in SpeedVac vacuum concentrator (Model: DNAl 10-120; Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY, USA). The EPS samples were resuspended in extraction buffer vnth additives and a protease inhibitor cocktail to the original volume and the mixture was incubated for up to 96 hours (Tables 3.1-3.3). After the addition of chemical additives buffer in the EPS sample mixture, it was observed that the additives caused incompatibility with Tricine-PAGE. When the sample was speed dried under vacuum, many additives remained in the sample and did not dissolve in the 2 x sample dye buffer (Laemmli, 1970) (Data not shown). Therefore the samples contmning salts (NaCl, NH4 CI, CaClz, MgCla, Fe(N0 3 )3) or a chelating agent (EDTA) were desalted employing a group separation utilizing Sephadex (a beaded gel filtration medium prepared by cross-linking Dextran vrith epichlorohydrin) G-25 in superfine size beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Microspin column (3,000-5,000 g for 3-5 minutes) desalting procedure was employed for high efficiency at high flow rates. Molecules larger than 1-5 kDa were excluded while smaller molecules entered the beads. The beads were preswollen in ethanol (20% v/v) to prevent microbial contamination and stored in 4'C. Resin slurry (1 ml) was pipetted into a microspin column and rinsed three times with ultrapure water. The EPS sample (300 pi) was added to the resin and spun in a centrifuge at 3,000 g for 3 minutes. The flow through eluate was collected and the samples were dried in the SpeedVac and resuspended in sample dye buffer. The resuspended samples were loaded on Tricine-PAGE gel (8-12%) and the protein bands were visualized by employing Coomassie blue, colloidal Coomassie silver, SYPRO Ruby, and silver nitrate stains. The best Tricine-PAGE gel concentration was found to be 10% (data not shown).

3.5.4 Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography Reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) was utilized in a batch mode to separate proteins and peptides wathin the EPS with various hydrophobicity, and to obtain samples with limited number of carbohydrates. Aqueous activated sludge EPS proteins and peptides were bounded to Cig reversed phase silica beads resin (Fluka Biochemica/Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) through hydrophobic interactions, allowing small molecules--including salts, buffers and chaeotropes--to be removed. The EPS proteins and peptides were subsequently eluted with acetonitrile (AcN) (50% v/v) (Caledon Laboratories LTD, Georgetown, ON, Canada) in water with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (0.1% v/v) and formic acid (5% v/v) (Naldrett et aL, 2005). Resin (1 ml) was presoaked in 5ml of 100% AcN for 20-30 minutes in a 15-ml tube (1:5 ratio). Suspended resin (250 pi) was transferred to a microcentrifiige tube (tube 1) and centrifijged at 11,000 g for 30 seconds. The supernatant was decanted and AcN (400 pi of 50% v/v) + formic acid (0.1% v/v) was added to tube 1, resuspended and centrifijged at 11,000 g for 30 seconds. The supernatant was decanted once again and 400ul of AcN (5% v/v) + formic acid (0.1% v/v) was added to tube 1, resuspended and centrifijged at 11,000 g for 30 seconds. The addition of AcN (400 pi of 5% v/v) + formic acid (0.1% v/v) to tube 1 was repeated two more times. The dried EPS sample was resuspended in second microcentrifijge tube (tube 2) with acetic acid (200 pi of 0.1% v/v) + TFA (10 pi) (Fluka Biochemica/Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada). Accounting for the binding capacity of the resin an appropriate amount of sample fi'om tube 2 was transferred to tube 1, resuspended and centrifijged at 11,000 g for 30 seconds. The EPS sample in tube 1 was then resuspended in of formic acid (400 pi of 0.1% v/v) and this was repeated two more times. For protein elution, AcN (400 pi of 70% v/v) was added to tube 1,

52

resuspended and centrifuged at 11,000 g for 30 seconds. The supernatant collected was dried in a SpeedVac and either resuspended in 2x sample buffer or digested with trypsin in Ix digestion buffer and ran on ESI/LC-MS/MS.

3.5.5 EPS Protein Concentration and Precipitation In this study, the Chloroform-Methanol (C-M), Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and PhenolEther (P-E) protocols (Sauve et a l, 1995; Ziegler et ah, 1997; Aguilar et ah, 1999) were employed for protein precipitation and purification.

3 5.5.1 Chloroform-Methanol (C-M) Method Four volumes of methanol were added to 1 volume of EPS and vortexed well. Chloroform (100 pi) (Caledon Laboratories LTD, Georgetown, ON, Canada) was added and niixed. Ultrapure water (300 pi) was added and vortexed. The mixture was centriftiged at 15,000 S for 5 minutes at 4Â°C and the proteins are located at the interphase. The aqueous top layer was gently removed and 4 volumes of methanol were added and vortexed. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 5 minutes at 4Â°C. The supernatant was removed and the lower aqueous phase was dried by centrifugation under vacuum. Finally, the dry samples were mixed ^ t h 2x sample buffer for Tricine-PAGE.

53

3.5.S.2 Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) Method 3.5.5.2.1 TCA Method TCA (20% w/v) (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ, USA) was added to the EPS sample and the sample was left on ice for 1 hour before centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 minutes at 4Â°C. The residual liquid was removed and dried before mixing with 2x sample bufier for Tricine-PAGE.

3.5.5.2.2 TCA-Acetonc Method TCA (20% w/v) was added to the EPS sample and the sample was left on ice for 1 hour before centrifugation at 12,000 for 30 minutes at 4Â°C. The residual liquid was removed and the

remaining pellet was rinsed twice with cold acetone (200 pi) and dried before mixing with 2x sample bufier for Tricine-PAGE.

3.5.5.2.3 TCA-Sodium Deoxycholate (DOC) Method TCA (20% w/v) was added to the EPS sample and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada). The sample was left on ice for 1 hour before centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 minutes at 4Â°C. The residual liquid was removed and dried before mixing with 2x sample bufier for Tricine-PAGE.

3.5.5.2.4 TCA-DOC-EthanoI Method TCA (20% w/v) and deoxycholate (DOC) (0.05% w/v) were added to the EPS sample. The sample was left on ice for 1 hour before centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 minutes at 4Â°C. The residual liquid was removed and the remaining pellet was rinsed twice with pure cold ethanol (400 pi) and dried before mixing with 2x sample bufier for Tricine-PAGE.

54

3.5.S.3 Phenol-Ether (P-E) Method Phenol (Fluka Biochemica/Sigma-AIdrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) was added to EPS in a 1:1 ratio and the sample mixture was vortexed for 20 seconds, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 5 minutes at 4Â°C. After removal of the top aqueous phase, two volumes of ether (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA) (1ml maximum) were added to the phenol phase. The mbrture was vortexed for 20 seconds and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 5 minutes at 4Â°C (proteins should be at the interphase). Two volumes of ether were added once again to the EPS samples, vortexed for 20 seconds, and centrifuged at 12,000 g'for 5 minutes at 4Â°C to remove residual phenol. The lower aqueous phase was dried by centrifugation under vacuum and the dry samples were mixed with 2x sample bufier for Tricine-PAGE.

3.5.6 Additive Buffer Combined with EPS Protein Concentration/Precipitation After successfully precipitating the EPS proteins, the next step was to extract the protein by using additives and then effectively concentrate the dilute protein solution prior to TricinePAGE.

3.5.7 Tricine Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis For purification and separation of small amounts of protein sample, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) offers best results and excellent resolution (Michalski and Shiell, 1999) altering the pore size consistent with the nature of the proteins separated (Gersten, 1996). P a g e is also used for its compatibility with mass spectrometry (MS) for subsequent protein characterization (Chevalier ei al., 2004). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyaciylamide gel

55

electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is frequently employed for separation of proteins based on their molecular mass (Romijin et a l, 2003). However, the SDS-PAGE suffers from poor resolution and streaking o f proteins below 20 IcDa (Schagger and von Jagow, 1987). Tricine-PAGE gives a superior resolution of proteins in the range o f 5 and 20 kDa and thus was employed instead of SDS-PAGE in this study (Schagger and von Jagow, 1987). This method separates negatively charged proteins in polyacryamide gel with a built-in pH gradient using Tris-tricine (Michalski and Shiell, 1999) discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (Laemmli, 1970). Approximately 10 ml of 10% separating gel mix [5.0 ml of 30% Acrylamide-Bis mix (29:1) (BioShop Canada, Burlington, ON), 4.5 ml of 3.0 M Tris-HCl in 0.3% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.0 (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ, USA), 4.0 ml of ultrapure water, 1.5 ml glycerol (Fisher Scientific, F^law n, NJ, USA), 50 pi of 20% (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), and 20 pi of TEMED (BioShop Canada, Burlington, ON, Canada)] was poured between the glass plates. The separating gel was overlaid with water and after 20 minutes this overlay was removed and replaced with stacking gel mix [Acrylamide-Bis mix (1.62 ml of 30% v/v, 29:1), Tris-HCl (3.10 ml of 30% w/v, pH 8.8), ultrapure water (7.78 ml), ammonium persulfate (APS) (50 pi of 20% w/v), and TEMED (20 pi)]. After purification, the dried proteins were solubilized in 20-60 pi of denaturing 2x Tricine sample buffer [4x Tris-HCl/SDS (2 ml, pH 6.8), glycerol (2.4 ml), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (0.8 g) (BioShop Canada Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada), DTT (0.31 g) (EM Science, Darmstadt, Germany), and Coomassie blue G-250 (2 mg)] and loaded into the wells. Bio-Rad Precision Plus ProteinTM molecular weight markers with and without dual colour (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) were employed for determination of the molecular weight of protein samples.

56

lOx SDS running buflfer [Tris (121 g) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA), Tricine (179 g) (BioShop Canada Inc., Burlington, ON) and SDS (10 g) were dissolved in ultrapure water (1000 ml) and autoclaved before use] was poured into the upper and lower reservoirs. The gels were electrophoresed at 30 V for 30 minutes and then 125 V until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. To detect proteins in Tricine polyacrylamide gels, Coomassie Brilliant Blue and silver nitrate are the most frequent techniques of protein staining, with sensitivity ranges of about 1 mg for Coomassie Brilliant Blue and 1 ng for silver nitrate stain (Wray et a l, 1981; Gradilone et a l, 1998; Blackstock and Weir, 1999). Coomassie dyes stain the protein molecules according to dye-dye ionic or hydrophobic associations with the Coomassie dyes and basic amino acids of proteins (Candiano et al., 2004). Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain for detection of proteins suffers from low sensitivity including the improved colloidal blue stain (sensitivity of 30 ng) (Neuhoff et al., 1990). The silver nitrate staining procedure includes soaldng the polyacrylamide gel in solution contmning soluble Ag^ and subsequently reducing the gel to AgÂ° with formaldehyde, a silver reductant (Yan et a l, 2000). Silver nitrate stain is much more sensitive than Coomassie stain, but suffers from a possible interference with MS protein analysis (Chevalier et a l, 2004). To overcome the classical stain limitations, several fluorescent dyes were introduced to overcome the sensitmty and MS compatibility issues. Such stains include SYPRO Ruby protein gel stmn (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), which is as sensitive as silver stdn but does not require glutaraldehyde, which can create false positive responses on the polyacrylamide gel. SYPRO Ruby dye contains ruthenium, which interacts noncovalently with proteins and the detection sensitivity is in the range of 0.5-1 ng. The stained proteins may then be visualized

57

on a UV light box o f 302 nm and the stain is fiilly compatible with subsequent protein characterization using MS (Candiano et a l, 2004). Nevertheless, even this improved fluorescent stain has its drawbacks, such as high cost and technical difficulties (Chevalier ei a l, 2004). For the following study several stÃ®Ã¼ns were employed, including Coomassie Brilliant Blue, colloidal blue, silver nitrate, and SYPRO Ruby dye stains. The gel was stained with either Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain solution [Coomassie blue R-250 (0.025% w/v) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), methanol (40% v/v) (Caledon Laboratories LTD, Georgetown, ON, Canada), acetic acid (7% v/v) (Caledon Laboratories LTD, Georgetown, ON, Canada)], colloidal Coomassie stain solution (designated "blue silver" ovring to its significantly higher sensitivity than conventional Coomassie blue) [Coomassie blue G-250 (100 mg) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA), phosphoric acid (30 ml of 83% v/v) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA), ammotuum sulfate (170 g), and distilled water (460 ml)] (Gersten, 1996; Candiano et a l, 2004), silver nitrate stmning [wash I (acetic acid (7% v/v)), wash n (methanol (50% v/v) with aqueous glutaraldehyde (0.03% v/v)), wash m (ultrapure water), staining solution (NaOH (0.36% w/v) (EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany) in water (21 ml) and ammonium hydroxide (1.4 ml of 14.8 M w/v) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA)), developing solution (citric acid (1ml of 1% w/v)) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA), formaldehyde (100 pi of 37% v/v) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA) and ultrapure water (200 ml)] (Wray et a i, 1981; Gersten, 1996), or SYPRO Ruby dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), according to instructions of the manufacturer. The Coomassie- and colloidal Coomassie-stained gels were destained in methanol (40% v/v) and 10% acetic acid (v/v), while the SYPRO Ruby stain was destained in ultrapure water.

58

All the stains were visualized colorimetrically except SYPRO Ruby stmn, which was visualized fluorimetrically with a standard UV light box. However, data acquisition and fluorescence intensity could not be integrated and quantitative information could not be obtmned using this system. The sizes of the EPS proteins were determined by generating a standard curve fi'om molecular mass standards on each Tricine-PAGE gel.

3.6 EPS Glycoprotein Detection A vast number of approaches exist for the detection, isolation and characterization of glycoproteins aiming at the identification of the covalent linkage between the carbohydrate and the polypeptide fi'action (Schaffer et al., 2001). However, relatively few techniques sensitively and reliably detect carbohydrate residues on proteins in polyacrylamide gels or on electroblot membranes (Steinberg et a l, 2001). The glycoproteins were detected on Tricine-PAGE gel versus on a nitrocellulose, since nitrocellulose interferes with glycoprotein analysis. The unglycosylated proteins bind strongly to nitrocellulose, although highly-glycosylated proteins bind weakly or not at all (Walker, 1994). Therefore, to detect glycoprotein in the crude EPS and the EPS protein samples on Tricine-PAGE gels. Periodic acid-Schiflf (PAS) stain was utilized. For glycoprotein carbohydrate estimation, a Glycoprotein Carbohydrate Estimation Kit (23260) (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, JL, USA) was employed. Figure 3.4 demonstrates the various methods used in determining the glycosylation extent in EPS.

3.6.1 Periodic Acid--SchifT Stain The periodic acid-ScliiÂ£f (PAS) reagent is commonly employed for general glycoprotein detection due to its ability to stain icinal diol groups that are mainly found on peripheral sugars and sialic acids in glycoproteins (Walker, 1994). The PAS staining using a chromogenic substrate, acid fUchsin, was employed for glycoprotein detection, which may detect 25-100 ng of glycoprotein (Doemer and White, 1990). The procedure for PAS staining was modified fi'om Doemer and White (1990) and fi'om Pro-Q Fuchsia Glycoprotein Detection kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA).

60

Following the EPS protein separation on Tricine-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in the fume hood by immersing it in a Fix solution [methanol (50% v/v)] for 1 hour with gentle agitation. The gel was then washed twice in the Wash solution [acetic acid (3% v/v)] for 20 minutes each time. The gel was incubated in Oxidizing solution [periodic acid (2.5 g) in acetic acid (250 ml of 3% v/v)] with gentle agitation for 30 minutes-1 hour. The gel was washed in Wash solution three times for 10 minutes each time. The gel was then incubated in the dark in Fuchsia reagent [fiichsin acid stain (2.5 g) in ultrapure water (500 ml)] with gentle agitation for 30 minutes-1 hour. Following the staining with Fuchsia reagent, the gel was incubated in the dark in Reducing solution [sodium metabisulfite (1.25 g) in ultrapure water (250 ml)] for 10-20 minutes. The gel was then washed repeatedly with the Wash solution following a wash in ultrapure water. After the washes, the glycoproteins are visible as fuchsia-coloured bands.

3.6.2 Glycoprotein Carbohydrate Estimation Glycoprotein Carbohydrate Estimation Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) Was used to simply and rapidly detect glycoproteins and estimate carbohydrate content. Glycoprotein is first oxidized with sodium meto-periodate to form aldehydes that react with the proprietary Glycoprotein Detection Reagent. The resulting purple reaction has an absorption maximum at 550 nm that is proportional to the carbohydrate content in the glycoprotein. Unknowns are compared with protein standards of known glycoprotein content. Non glycosylated proteins, such as lysozyme and bovine serum albumin, produce a low absorbance at 550 nm. This kit was utilized for glycoprotein estimation in crude and treated EPS samples. Standards (50 pi each) and the sample (50 pi) were placed in the 96-well plates (use 50 pi of Glycoprotein Assay Buffer as a blank). Each sample and standard were tested in triplicate.

61

Sodium /neto-periodate solution (25 pl) was added to each well and the plate was mixed for 30 seconds in a microplate shaker. Subsequently, the plate was covered and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Glycoprotein Detection Reagent (150 pi) was added to each well and the plate was mixed for 30 seconds in a microplate shaker. The plate was covered and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The absorbance was measured at 550 nm in a microplate reader and a standard curve was plotted.

3.6.3 Enigmatic Deglycosylation of EPS Glycoproteins The CalbiochemÂ® glycoprotein deglycosylation kit (EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany) was employed for the removal of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides. The kit components include 5 different enzymes for deglycosylation of approximately 200pg of an average glycoprotein in the given time and can be employed for EPS glycoproteins from activated sludge: 1. N-GIycosidase F--removes virtually all N-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins. 2. Endo-tt-N-acetylgalactosaminidase--removes the Gaipi,3GalNAc core structure, attached to serine and threonine, intact. 3. o2-3,6,8,9-Neuraminidase--removes trisialyl structure by cleaving the NeuSAca 2,8NeuSAc bond. 4. pi,4-Galactosidase--hydrolyzes glycoprotein with the sequence GlcNAcpi,3Gaipi,4GlcNAc at the P~l,4 linkage; required for complete removal of O-linked structure or its derivatives.

62

5. p-N-Acetylglucosaminidase--hydrolyzes Gaipi,3GalNAc core disaccharide from Ser/Thr residues in glycoprotein; required for complete removal of O-linked structure or its derivatives. Steric hindrance inhibits or slows the action o f the deglycosylating enzymes on certain residues of glycoproteins (GlycoProfileTM! Kit PP0200). Various dÃ©naturants have been employed to expose otherwise inaccessible oligosaccharide cores, including ionic, nonionic, and zwitterionic detergents as well as chaeotropic salts and thiols. Of these, heating in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) appears to be the simplest and most effective method for unfolding glycoproteins. TRITONÂ® X-100 is used in the kit to enhance the ability of oligosaccharidecleaving enzymes to deglycosylate certain glycoproteins in metabolically labeled cell extracts (Tarentino e/a/., 1989). The denaturing protocol was used in order to deglycosylate the glycoproteins in the EPS completely. The EPS protein sample was dissolved in ultrapure water (30 pi). 5X reaction buffer (10 pi) and dÃ©naturation solution (2.5 pi) was added to the mixture, mixed gently and heated for 5 minutes at 100Â°C. After the sample cooled to room temperature, TRITONÂ® X-100 (2.5 pi) was added to the sample and gently mixed. Subsequently, five enzymes (1 pi each) in the kit were added to the sample. The mixture was incubated overnight instead of the recommended three hours at 37Â°C for complete deglycosylation and extent of deglycosylation was analyzed by Tricine-PAGE. The position of the native protein was then compared with the deglycosylated protein to judge the extent of glycosylation. Bovine fetuin, which contains both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides, was used as a control.

63

3.7 EPS Protein Identification In order to identify the proteins in the EPS, the EPS samples were either purified by the RPLC method or combining chemical buffer additive with precipitating the protein. The combined method of addition of chemical buffer additive with protein precipitation was followed by 10% Tricine-PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue, colloidal Coomassie, silver nitrate, or SYPRO Ruby stdn. After throughoutly destmning, the gel bands were dissected and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS).

3.7.1 Tandem Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) After RPLC procedure, the EPS sample was digested with 0.5 g of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 5% acetonitrile, 200 mM urea and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 at 37Â°C overnight. After the last incubation with trypsin (overnight), the pH was adjusted to 4 using formic acid. The enzymatic peptides obtained from the EPS sample were desalted using Cig Zip-Tips (Millipore Laboratories, Bedford, MA, USA) and separated on a Cig column (150 mm X 0.3 mm, 5 um particle size) (Grace Vydac, Hesperia, CA, USA) with an Agilent 1100 HPLC pump (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Following the HPLC protein separation, the EPS peptide samples were loaded unto ESI-LC-MS/MS which employs ion trap. The sample was analyzed over a 90-minute gradient from 5% to 65% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 2 /L per minute. The obtained MS/MS data files from the Bruker Esquire 6000 Mass Spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and the mass spectra obtained was searched agmnst a nonredundant library of proteins such as BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/; BLAST, Bethesda, MD, USA) and Matrix Science Mascot Algorithm

64

(http://www.Matrixscience.com; Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA). The MALDI-TOF-MS was not utilized due to insufiSciency of equipment parts. After optimization of the chemical additive method with protein precipitation, the gel band obtained from the Tricine-PAGE was excised and digested with 0.5 g of sequencing grade trypsin overnight in Ix digestion bufier containing, ZipTipped, and ran on ESI-LC-MS/MS. The destaining and removal of the protein extract was performed on individual gel slices containing a single protein band as depicted in Figure 3.5. The protein bands were excised from the silver-stained gel with a clean, sharp straight edge razor as close to the boundaries of the protein as possible. The band was further cut into 1mm X 1mm sections in minimal ultrapure water and transferred to a 1.5 microcentrifbge tube with tweezers. The destaining process was performed by adding 1.0 ml of O.IMNH4HCO3 in 50% AcN for 30 minutes at 30Â°C. This process was repeated once. The gel piece was dried completely in SpeedVac and rehydrated in 10 pi of Ix digestion bufier contmning 0.5 pg of trypsin. Additional 200 pi of Ix digestion bufier containing 0.5 pg of trypsin was added to the gel band and the sample was incubated overnight at 37Â°C. The digestion bufier (extract) was carefully removed and placed into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifiige tube. 200 pi of 0.1% TFA in 60% AcN and 50 pi of 5% acetic acid was added to the gel pieces. The tube was then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The extract was carefully removed from tube 1 with the gel

3.8 Statistical Analysis The variability in measurements was determined using standard deviation of the average (mean +/- standard deviation), employing Microsoft Excel (Windows 2000). The t-test was performed for determination of significance between sample means. The null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between various treatments for protein isolation and purification was tested using a two-tailed t-test. If the probability for the calculated t-statistic was equal or less than 0.05, then the null hypothesis was rejected and the two or more samples were concluded to be different and statistically significant. The ANOVA was performed to determine if the observations have come from the same population and the Fcaicuiated was compared to ^significant from the F table (Mendenhall and Sincich, 1992).

CHAPTER 4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The purpose of this study was to resolve the protein fraction in the activated sludge extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by developing a novel purification, isolation and extraction method and endeavor to reveal that a considerable portion of the EPS proteins consist of glycoproteins. The objectives in this study were four-fold; 1) to investigate the ability to isolate, separate and purify the EPS proteins from microbial activated sludge floe EPS; 2) to estimate the extent of glycosylation in the microbial EPS matrix; 3) to identify the microbial activated sludge EPS proteins; and 4) to gain a better understanding of the function of EPS proteins on the floe structure and formation in the activated sludge by assessing the nature of the protein and its function. To accomplish the first objective, the untreated cation exchange resin (CER)-extracted EPS samples and microbial EPS samples treated with various buffers (acids, bases, salts, chelating agents, detergents, chaeotropes, organic agents, and reducing agents), reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), and precipitation methods, were run on onedimensional Tricine-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-PAGE) and visualized under a variety of stains (Coomassie Brilliant Blue, colloidal Coomassie, silver nitrate, and SYPRO Ruby). To accomplish the second objective, following Tricine-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, the resulting gel was stained with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain and the glycoprotein carbohydrate content was estimated in the untreated and treated EPS samples. To accomplish the third objective, the untreated and treated CER-extracted EPS samples (in-solution or in-gel) were run on tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) and various protein database searches. To accomplish the fourth objective, the nature of the EPS proteins was theorized from the conducted study.

4.2 Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) 4.2.1 Cation Exchange Resin (CER) Various EPS extraction methods have been endeavored w th the intention of finding an appropriate technique that would yield high amount of protein with minimal lysis. The cation exchange resin (CER) method was used for its high extraction efBciency with minimum cell lysis and no interference during the protein analysis.

69

4.2.1.1 Chemical Analyses of EPS The concentrations o f protein, carbohydrate and DNA in the EPS from activated sludge obtained from four laboratory sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) and Ashbridges Bay wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were assessed (Figures 4.1-4.2), using BCA protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA), phenol-sulfriric acid method (Masuko et a l, 2005) modified from Dubois et a l (1956), and standard fluorescent DNA quantification kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), respectively (Appendix A contains results in a table format for the concentrations in pg/ml and mg/g MLSS). From Figures 4.1 and 4.2 it may be observed that the laboratory-scale SBR EPS samples contain less total protein, total carbohydrate and total DNA compared to WWTP EPS samples. This may be because these are different systems {e.g., varying effluent age, SRT, and organic load). Figures 4.1 and 4.2 demonstrate the major quantities of EPS constituents. The major EPS constituents comprise of proteins, carbohydrates and DNA originated within the activated sludge floe matrix derived from laboratory-scale SBRs or WWTP. In this study the protein: carbohydrate ratio varied from 1.16-3.42 (w/w) (Figure 4.3), which situates within the established range of 0.2-5.0 (w/w) (Frolund et a l, 1995). It was determined that protein was the dominant constituent in the EPS, followed by carbohydrate and a smaller portion of DNA in both SBRs and WWTP samples, as exhibited in previous studies (Urbain et a l, 1993; Frolund et a l, 1996; Bura et a l, 1998; Liao et a l, 2001). The protein and carbohydrate content (pg/ml and mg/g MLSS) for SBRs 1 and 2 (t-test, p>0.05), and 3 and 4 (t-test, p>0.05), were not significantly different. The protein and content in all four reactors (ANOVA, p>0.05) was not significantly different (Figures 4.1a and 4.2a).

70

However, the carbohydrate content in all four reactors (ANOVA, p<0.05) was significantly diflFerent (Appendix C). The carbohydrate content may have differed in all four reactors but was similar in reactors 1 and 2 and reactors 3 and 4, because reactors 1 and 2 were fed with high phosphorous levels and reactors 3 and 4 were fed with limited phosphorous levels. Phosphorus limitation causes morphological changes in the floe structure and the composition of EPS (Liu et a i, 2006). Samples fi' om WWTP were further divided into subsamples (S), fi' om which the EPS was extracted individually. CER-extracted EPS subsample from WWTP biomass collected in May (S2i) contained significantly greater protein content (pg/ml and mg/g MLSS) (ANOVA, p<0.05) than EPS subsamples S2z and S2s (Figures 4.1b and 4.2b). EPS subsample S2z contained significantly greater carbohydrate content (pg/ml and mg/g MLSS) (ANOVA, p<0.05) than EPS subsamples S2i and S2s (Figures 4.1b and 4.2b) (Appendix C). There was not significant difference in protein content (pg/ml and mg/g MLSS) of CERextracted EPS subsamples from WWTP biomass collected in June (S3i, S3z, S3s, S3#) (ANOVA, P^O.05) (Figures 4.1b and 4.2b). EPS subsamples S3i and S3z contained significantly lower carbohydrate content (pg/ml and mg/g MLSS) (ANOVA, p<0.05) when compared to EPS subsamples S3s and S34 (Figures 4.1b and 4.2b) (Appendix C). CER-extracted EPS subsample from WWTP biomass collected in July (S4i) contmned significantly greater protein content (pg/ml and mg/g MLSS) (ANOVA, p<0.05) than EPS subsample S4z (Figures 4.1b and 4,2b). There was no significant difference in carbohydrate content (pg/ml and mg/g MLSS) between EPS subsamples S4i and S4] (ANOVA, p>0.05) (Figures 4.1b and 4.2b) (Appendix C).

71

This demonstrates that the samples derived from SBRs contmn protein and carbohydrate concentrations that level off over time and are relatively constant unlike samples derived from WWTP because these are different systems. The difference in DNA concentrations between SBR- and WWTP-derived EPS samples could not be determined using ANOVA analysis because the standard deviations o f DNA content were at zero. The ratio of proteins to carbohydrates was constant for all four laboratory SBRs and no significant difference was found in samples from WWTP (ANOVA, p>0.05) (Appendix B). A slight change that was seen within the samples in the WWTP may be due to growth rate and microbial community of sludge. The DNA content in the EPS of the activated sludge samples in WWTP was found to be highly variable compared to the total EPS, ran^ng from 0.4-7.4%. The extracellular DNA is likely to be dependent on physicochemical factors, rather than the biomass, as was verified by Urbain et a l (1993). The nucleic acid and protein content found in the CER-extracted EPS samples have been shown previously to be naturally occurring in the EPS from cell lysis or cell excretion (Urbain et a i, 1993; Frolund et a l, 1996; Nielsen and Jahn, 1999; Liao et a l, 2001). The presence of DNA and protein in the EPS has been also linked to structural stability of the floe (Urbain et a l, 1993; Liao et a l, 2001). From microscopic examinations it has been observed that before and after CER extraction the cells were not ruptured (results not shown). From the study conducted, no correlation was found between EPS constituents and SVI, which coincides with Liao et a l (2001) and (2006) findings.

4.3 EPS Protein Extraction and Purification From previous studies done in our lab (Williams, 2005; Lang, 2005) it was found that the resolution of proteins from biomass and crude CER-extracted EPS was very poor utilbdng conventional polyacrylamide electrophoresis methods for protein separation and purification. The results observed from Figure 4.4a correspond to the prevous findings. The dense re^ons that possibly contain protein fraction lie within the 100-250, 50-80, 35-55, and 25 killodaltons. The poor resolution of crude microbial EPS sample on Tricine-PAGE may occur due to interactions within EPS, which is a very complicated matrix of various constituents, majority of which consisting o f proteins and carbohydrates. Further it is hypothesized that some of these proteinpolysaccharide interactions may contm glycoproteins. The results of the WWTP-derived microbial EPS (Figure 4.4B) demonstrate resolution of the crude untreated EPS. Eleven distinct bands (shown by arrows) were identified as approximately: 170,129, 114,97, 71, 62, 51,28, 21, 13, and 8 kDa. From the results in Figure 4.4B, the proteins that are visualized may come from cell lysis that may occur as a result of lower microbial growth rates and a higher level of endogenous metabolism. The accumulation of protein and DNA in the crude EPS extract cannot be used as indicators for cell lysis given that it has been established that the EPS naturally contains large amounts o f protein and DNA (Urban et al., 1993; Frolund et a l, 1996; Nielsen and Jahn, 1999), which are linked to structural stability of the floe (Urbain et a l, 1993; Liao et a l, 2001). Furthermore, from microscopic observations, the cell lysis was observed to be nunimal (Results not shown).

The extracted EPS from WWTP was also examined for possible induced cell lysis by rupturing the cells present in the activated sludge portion or observing the cells before and after CER extraction under inverted microscope, and comparing the released proteins in the activated sludge to the possible EPS proteins from activated sludge floe. As stated previously, the cell lysis was observed to be minimal (Results not shown) under the microscope. In order to evaluate the quantity of proteins visualized in the possible EPS protein fraction that may be cellular, activated sludge was sonicated, boiled in 1-2% SDS, lysed with TRIZOLÂ®, and/or violently agitated with Mini-Bead-Beater-8TM system. TRIZOL* was found to be incompatible with the Tricine-PAGE system. From Figure 4.5A it may be observed that the protein pattern obtained from activated sludge sample by using Mini-Bead-Beater-8TM overall is very similar to the crude EPS pattern from WWTP. This may be due to the fact that the proteins extracted from activated sludge, even after cell lysis, contmn proteins that are both of exocellular and intracellular o r i ^ . There are, however, at least seven protein bands in the activated sludge (arrows on the left in Figure 4.5A) that do not match with the possible proteins from the EPS. The molecular weights of these proteins are approximately: 153, 116, -61, 47, 35,20, and 12 kDa. There is also a band in the possible EPS protein fraction that is not present in the activated sludge fraction at -- 170 kDa. When WWTP samples were treated with hot SDS (1% w/v), there is an increased quantity o f proteins that become more distinct as observed on Tricine-PAGE of Figure 4.5B in the microbial EPS fraction (1103.83 Â±18.1 pg/ml) (Appendix A). There are approximately thirteen distinct protein bands that are visible in Figure 4.5B. These proteins are roughly: 147, 138, 131, 119, 107,95, 92, 72, 54,40, 35, 30, and 23 kDa. These results may possibly suggest

78

that the EPS fiaction contains insoluble proteins that become more solubilized in SDS. This may also suggest that their hydrophobic interaction twth the EPS matrix was destabilized by hot SDS, The protÃ¢ns solubilized by SDS and visualized on polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel may be glycoproteins, which are possibly still covalently linked to a polysaccharide portion because SDS cannot destabilize covalent interactions since they require a large quantity of energy to break. The prominent protein bands from the SDS treatment do not generate cell lysis products since the sonlcation treatment (172.96 Â±11.7 pg/ml) demonstrates similar protein quantity on the Tricine-PAGE (Figure 4.5B) and merely a 10% protein increase when compared to the untreated EPS fraction (155.62 Â± 12.5 pg/ml) (Appendix B). The prominent bands from the sludge supernatant proteins are of 114 and 10 kDa (Figure 4.6C). These proteins appear to be distinct from the possible EPS proteins in activated sludge floe but the intracellular proteins are probably still present from natural cell lysis or cell wall turnover (Higgins and Novak, 1997). Therefore, it was attempted to remove these intracellular proteins from the EPS sample in order to isolate the exocellular protein fraction in the EPS. It was assumed that the structure might be configured in a honeycomb-type of arrangement, with intracellular proteins positioned on the outer shell of the structure. To separate possible intracellular proteins in the EPS and in the sludge supernatant from the exocellular protein fraction, the dried fractions were washed with ice-cold ethanol (80% w/v) or ice-cold SDS (0.1% w/v). It may be observed in Figure 4.6 that the majority of the proteins Were found in the wash fraction when control (Figure 4.6C), EPS treated with protease inhibitors and DTT (2mM w/v) (concentrated by phenol-ether method) (Figure 4.6A), and sludge supernatant (Figure 4.6A) were washed with ice-cold SDS. Nonetheless, when the ice-cold SDS

79

was used on EPS treated w th protease inhibitors, the proteins did not wash away completely (Figure 4.6B). When ice-cold ethanol was utilized instead of ice-cold SDS on EPS fraction, the proteins corresponding with the sludge supernatant proteins appeared to be washing away (Figure 4.6A). However, by the third washing the protein fraction became soluble in the ethanol and displayed a similar protein fraction in the washings as Figure 4.6B. From results obtained, it is possible that the CER-extracted EPS proteins may be associated with the water-soluble fraction of activated sludge floe. Furthermore, EPS treated with protease inhibitors followed by washings with ice-cold SDS or ice-cold ethanol resembled the same pattern as the control. Consequently, perhaps these proteins in the possible EPS protein fraction may play an important role in the EPS and thus may not be easily removed from the EPS matrix.

After staining the untreated WWTP-derived microbial EPS with PAS glycoprotein detection stain, the results display a possible glycosylation or a strong association with carbohydrate in the EPS protein fraction (Figure 4.7). This demonstrates that a substantial portion of the CER-extracted EPS is either glycosylated or the EPS proteins are strongly bound with carbohydrates.

Figure 4.7 PAS acid fiichsin stained Tricine-PAGE ( 1 0 %) of WWTP-derived activated sludge floe EPS with protease inhibitors. Microorganisms have evolved a variety of adhesins. Proteinaceous adhesins include flagella (Jarrel et a l, 1996; DeFlaun et a l, 1990), fimbriae (Larkin and Nelson, 1987), pili (Ong et a l, 1990), and various sur&ce proteins (Heilmann et a l, 1996; Timmerman et a l, 1990; Wilcox et al., 1989; Staat et a l, 1980). These adhesins are known to contain glyco^lation occurring outside the cytoplasmic membrane and thus act as lectins; therefore, it is probable that the glycosylated proteins visualized under PAS stain are lectins coming from these sources.

83

Bacterial lectins were described in the range o f 15-20 kDa previously (Higgins and Novak, 1997). More recent data demonstrates that these lectins may range from 10-240 kDa (Jin and Zhao, 2000; Van den Broeck et a l, 2000; Brimer and Montie, 1998; Jarrel et a l, 1996). Flagella are intricate organelles that may propel bacteria through liquids, extremely viscous environments or along surfaces (McCarter, 2006). Archaeal flagellin contains glycosylation proteins in the range of 10-53 kDa (Brimer and Montie, 1998; Jarrel et a l, 1996). Pili are hair-like adhesins that project from the bacterial surface. Fimbriae are pili that attach bacteria to a surface. These organelles are present in both Gram-negative and Grampositive organisms (Pizarro-Cerda and Cossart, 2006). Fimbrial glycosylated proteins are in the range of 16-240 kDa (Jin and Zhao, 2000; Van den Broeck et a l,
2 0 0 0 ).

Surface proteins include S-layer proteins, which were isolated from Campylobacterfetus by Dworkin et a l (1995) (97-149 kDa). These S-layer proteins also function as adhesins. The glycosylated moieties on these exposed organelles are probably a protective feature from proteases and other enzymes (Varki, 1993).

4.3.1 BufTer Additives To obtain a better resolution of proteins in SBR-derived and WWTP-derived activated sludge floe EPS, four methods were employed. The first method involved buffer additives, which comprised of acids, bases, salts, chelating agents, detergents, chaeotropes, organic agents, and reducing agents, in order to resolve EPS protein bands based on ionic interactions and increased protein stability and solubilization. The second method involved the use of reverse-phase liquid chromatography in order to get a better resolution of EPS proteins from activated sludge floes based on protein hydrophobicity. The third method employed the use of precipitation methods to

84

efifectively concentrate the proteins and remove interfering substances. The fourth method was a combination of precipitation and buffer additives to improve protein resolution, stabilize the EPS proteins and remove interferences vithin the sample. The effectiveness of each method was judged by runmng the samples on 10% Tricine-PAGE. To stabilize activated sludge EPS proteins, a range of several concentrations of acid and base were added to the CER-extracted EPS fraction in order to determine the optimum pH of the EPS proteins (Figure 4.8). The optimum pH for the total proteins in the activated sludge EPS will possibly bring these proteins closer to their isoelectric point. The appropriate pH of the total EPS proteins was found to be more than 3.5 and less than 11.0 , where the usual pKa for sludge floes is 2.9-5.0 (Liao et al., 2002). With a slight NaOH concentration increase (0.05% (w/v) NaOH), the pH has risen from pH of 7.5 to pH of 1 1.0 (Figure 4.8) and the Tricine-PAGE displayed protein degradation (Results not shown), which became more prominent \wth increased pH. The pH lower than 3.5 has demonstrated a similar degradation pattern. The effect of highly alkaline pH (i.e. >11) or highly acidic pH (i.e. <3.5) on activated sludge EPS may effect the functional groups, and in particular carboxyl and amino groups from proteins. A high pH (> 1 1 ) causes ionization of several charged functional groups, including carboxylic groups in proteins and carbohydrates, in the activated sludge EPS (Wingender et a l, 1999). At pH of greater than 11, the disulfide binding in proteins tends to break (Nielsen and Jahn, 1999) and the inner structure of the EPS could be damaged, with particles inside the EPS dispersed into solution. Sheng et al. (2006) have found that stability of floes did not change from pH 5.0 to 9 .0 ; however, as pH increased to
1 1 .2 ,

the dispersed mass dramatically increased from

0.082 g SS/L to 0.20 g SS/L. This dispersal of particles into solution may be due to protein destruction at pH of more than 11.

85

The pH of EPS protein samples' buffer was chosen to be neutral or slightly acidic to stabilize these proteins. At pH of 7.0, the proteins in the EPS will have an overall negative charge with some positively charged groups, although less so than carbohydrates in the EPS, which are considered to be negatively throughout (King and Forster, 1990). Nonetheless, the change in pH alone did not assist with the resolution of EPS proteins (Results not shown) and thus other additives were utilized.

Figure 4 . 8 Effect of pH on the CER-extracted activated sludge EPS with increasing NaOH and HCl concentrations.

The floe and EPS stability has been reported in the literature to be affected by the ionic strength; therefore, the effect o f ionic strength was assessed on EPS protein stability by addition

86

of monovalent (NaCI and NH4CI), divalent (CaCk, MgCk) and trivalent (Fe(N0 3 )3) cation salts and a chelating agent (EDTA) to the activated sludge EPS. From the Table 4.2 it may be observed that CER extracted EPS treated with monovalent cation salts, NaCl and NH4CI, demonstrates a greater stability of the proteins in the EPS compared to crude EPS that has been desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column. From the literature, it has been reported that monovalent cations, such as sodium and ammonium displace divalent cations within the cation bridged floe structure by ion exchange, making floes weak and sensitive to any physiochemical changes on the floe structure (Keiding and Nielsen, 1997). Evidently from this study it was found that the monovalent cations seem to strengthen the proteins in the microbial CER-extracted EPS fraction after treatment. The CER-extracted EPS treated with monovalent cation salts, NaCl and NH4CI, does indeed exhibit a greater amount of protein than other treatments. The results obtmned from Tricine-polyacrylamide gel stained with silver nitrate and PAS stain also support that indeed
10

mM of NaCl and NH 4CI (Figures 4.9-4.11) contmn a

considerable quantity of protein after the EPS sample was desalted on the Sephadex G-25 column. These findings validate the concentration results obtained from BCA protein concentration assay (Table 4.2) (Appendix B). The EPS treated with divalent cation salts, CaClz and MgClz, were found to contain less protein than the desalted EPS (Table 4.2) after treatment. In the literature, it has been reported that divalent cations, primarily calcium and magnesium, contribute to the ion bridging between the EPS matrix and cells (Kakii et al., 1985; Higgins and Novak, 1997; Keiding and Nielsen, 1997; Sheng et al., 2006). The results found in this study demonstrate that MgClz had low binding to the CER extracted EPS proteins. However, the EPS proteins were observed to form a solid complex with calcium ion and thus precipitate out of the solution. Keiding and Nielsen

87

(1997) observed an almost linear increase in proteins and carbohydrates vwth decrease of dissolved calcium ions. The EPS sample treated with chelating agent EDTA was found to contain less protein than crude EPS desalted on G-25 Sephadex spun column (Table 4.2). EDTA is known for its ability to remove divalent cations from the activated sludge, causing the EPS matrix to fall apart and causing breakdown o f the floe configuration (Sheng et ah, 2006). The EDTA did not demonstrate improvement in the EPS protein stability. The results obtmned from Tricinepolyacrylamide gel stained with silver nitrate and PAS stain also demonstrate that 5mM of EDTA (Figure 4.9-4.11) contmns small quantity of protein after the EPS sample was desalted on the Sephadex G-25 spun column. The EPS sample treated with trivalent cation salt Fe(N0 3 ) 3 displays the lowest protein yield after desalting on the Sephadex G-25 column (Table 4.2). A decreased microbial EPS resolution is also observed on
10%

Tricine-PAGE stained with silver nitrate and PAS stmn

(Figure 4.10a and Figure 4.11). It has been proposed in the past that trivalent cations, mmnly iron and aluminum play a role in EPS stability and ferric iron has a high aflSnity for protein (Murthy and Novak, 2001). This finding was not supported by our results.

The overall advantage of desalting procedure is the visualization of distinct protein bands after electrophoresis (Figures 4.9 and 4.11). The disadvantage of the desalting procedure is the large loss o f proteins, which were lost in the process. The EPS prior to desalting procedure contained 155.31 Â± 23.6 pg/ml of protein and 50.04 Â± 1.33 pg/ml of carbohydrate (Table 4.2). After desalting the same sample on G-25 Sephadex column, the EPS contained 41.20 Â± 3.54 pg/ml of protein (control) and 28.26 Â± 7.50 pg/ml of carbohydrate (control) (Table 4.2). This demonstrates an almost 4-fold decrease in total amount of proteins and a 1.2-fold decrease in total amount of carbohydrates in microbial EPS sample compared to control sample. Therefore, other additives were considered for protein stabilization. Guanidine hydrochloride (GHCl) stabilized and solubilized the EPS proteins the best compared to crude EPS sample (approximately 4 fold increase) (Table 4.3). However, GHCl is not compatible with the 2x sample bufifer and requires pure denatured ethanol to remove the residual GHCl. This method may have washed a portion of proteins off. Ethanol did not improve protein resolution (results not shown). A nonionic detergent TRITONÂ® X-100 exhibited a higher protein concentration when compared to the crude EPS (approximately 2 fold increase), although less than SDS (Table 4.3). The ionic detergent sodium dodeqd sulfate (SDS) improved protein and glycoprotein stability (Figure 4.12) and exhibited a high protein extraction yield (SBR: 882.22 Â±11.3; WWTP: 1103.83 Â± 18.1 pg/ml) compared to control (SBR: 32.39 Â±12.5 pg/ml; WWTP: 155.62 Â±12.5 pg/ml) (approximately 27 fold increase in SBR- and 7-fold increase in WWTP-derived activated sludge EPS sample). This suggests that SDS may have solubilized the insoluble glycoprotein fi'action (Table 4.3). The EPS proteins were denatured by boiling in SDS prior to electrophoresis in order to eliminate the majority of secondary and tertiary structures. Reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) demonstrated an increase in EPS proteins (SBR: 1527.28

+/-20.2 pg/ml (following P-E precipitation); WWTP: 6013.31 Â± 126 pg/ml) (approximately 47fold increase in SBR- and 39-fold increase in WWTP-derived activated sludge EPS sample) and thus was also considered to be an excellent additive (Table 4.4) (Appendix B).

4.3.2 Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography Reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) employing a Cjg column in the batch mode was utilized to clean up the complex microbial EPS sample, to separate proteins and peptides within the EPS with various hydrophobicity, and to obtain samples with limited number of carbohydrates. It has been demonstrated in previous studies that the hydrophobic fraction of the EPS is comprised of proteins (amino acids with hydrophobic side groups) and the hydrophilic portion is comprised of mainly neutral carbohydrates (Jorand et a l, 1998; Liao et a l, 2000).

After employing the RPLC procedure on SBR-derived activated sludge EPS sample, a thick band was visualized by Tricine-PAGE (Figure 4.13) in the region o f40-60 killodaltons. From Figure 4.13, it is apparent that the RPLC method employing Cig column achieved a better protein and peptide separation than the bufifer additive method.

Accordingly, the crude samples containing a lower EPS protein and carbohydrate concentration were concentrated (SBR-derived) and crude

samples containing a much higher EPS protein concentration were diluted (WWTP-derived). It was hypothesized that further protein concentration o f dilute activated sludge EPS samples may increase the resolution of proteins on Tricine-PAGE and perhaps resolve them into clear, distinct bands.

4.3.3 EPS Protein Concentration and Precipitation Protein precipitation methods are used to concentrate proteins or eliminate interferences before electrophoresis or protein determination. Out of the numerous protein precipitation protocols available in the literature, the three that are frequently utilized are the ChloroformMethanol (C-M), Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and Phenol-Ether (P-E) protocols (Sauve et ah, 1995; Ziegler et ah, 1997; Aguilar et ah, 1999). After the SBR-derived crude activated sludge EPS was treated w th various protein precipitation techniques, the treated EPS sample was ran on 10% Tricine-polyacrylamide electrophoresis in order to assess the method of choice. From Figure 4.14, it is evident that the PE precipitation protocol is the method of choice. Both the P-E and TCA-DOC methods effectively precipitated proteins in the EPS sample fraction. However, only P-E gave distinct protein bands.

4.3.4 Additive BufTer Combined with EPS Protein Concentration/Precipitation After successfully precipitating the activated sludge EPS proteins using the P-E precipitation protocol, the EPS proteins were subsequently extracted by using several bufier additives (i.e. SDS, acetonitrile with and without triftuoroacetic acid (TFA), dithiothreitol (DTT), and borate) to achieve a higher protein jaeld in conjunction with the protein precipitation (P-E) method prior to Tricine-PAGE. SDS was used within its critical micelle concentration (CMC) (0.1% w/v) to resolve EPS proteins. Urea chaeotrope was employed because it does not interfere with 2x sample bufier. Acetonitrile (50% v/v) with and without TFA (0.1% v/v) was utilized as an organic solvent to achieve a higher EPS protein separation with or without reducing conditions. Borate (0.2 M w/v) Was utilized in order to remove glycosylated moiety that might cause a poorer extraction of EPS proteins. The results in Figure 4.15 demonstrate that DTT had the highest protein yield when it was added to the crude EPS sample and thus it was employed in combination with the P-E precipitation protocol. The results of this experiment demonstrate that including DTT (2 mM w/v) before EPS protein precipitation increases the separation and quantity of proteins in the SBR-derived activated sludge EPS fraction (Figure 4.15). There are thirteen protein bands that are demonstrated in Figure 4.15. These possibly exocellular EPS proteins are approximately: 123, 91, 84, 67, 66, 56, 51, 38, 31, 28, 23, 18, and 13 kDa. The same method of adding DTT following P-E precipitation was employed on WWTPderived microbial EPS fraction in order to isolate the exocellular proteins from the EPS matrix. It Was determined that employing DTT following P-E treatment did eliminate some interactions in

Addition of calcium to the EPS sample along with DTT foUowed by P-E precipitation did not improve protein resolution but in fact hindered it. Employing DTT alone also did not improve protein visualization on Tricine-PAGE (Figure 4.16).

Results are expressed as the average of Â± one standard deviation. Glycoprotein Carbohydrate Estimation Kit (23260) was utilized to simply and rapidly detect glycoproteins and estimate carbohydrate content. From the results obtained the WWTPderived EPS samples contained a larger portion of glycosylated proteins in the untreated EPS portion. The glycosylation in WWTP-derived EPS varied from 24-100% (Figure 4.18). The glycosylated carbohydrate content was compared to the total carbohydrates derived from WWTP EPS samples (Figure 4.18-4.19). It was found that within samples 2, 3 and 4 there was no

104

apparent association between quantities of total carbohydrates to glycoprotein carbohydrate estimate. Furthermore, when protease inhibitor cocktml is added to the untreated EPS, the glycosylated carbohydrate content reaches 100% (results not shown) (Appendix B). When the untreated fraction was precipitated with P-E, a 100% glycoprotein carbohydrate content was also reached (Figure 4.20). This demonstrates that the P-E precipitation method precipitates the glycoproteins present in the activated sludge EPS sample. However, DTT by itself or with CaCb followed by P-E precipitation appears to diminish glycosylation present in the EPS sample 13- and 9-fold, respectively. Even the 2mM DTT treatment of EPS followed by P-E precipitation diminished glycosylation compared to the EPS only treated with P-E precipitation (1.3-fold). Conceivably, the removal of disulfide bridge links by DTT deglycosylates a portion of the EPS proteins and thus an alkylation must be conducted to stabilize the DDT-reduced protein fraction. It may also be possible that the DTT interferes with the assay Idt utilized; however, there were no possible interferences listed in the kit.

4.3.4 Enzymatic Deglycosylation of EPS Glycoproteins In order to determine how much of the molecular mass discrepancy for EPS proteins could be accounted for by the addition of glycosylated groups, the EPS was enzymatically deglycosylated by the use of enzymatic glycoprotein deglycosylation kit (EMD Biosciences/Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). The kit employed completely removes N- and 0-linked oligosaccharides from the glycosylated protein without any protein degradation (Thotakura and Bahl, 1987). From the results obtained in Figure 4.21a and b, it may be observed that the molecular masses of the EPS proteins did not change significantly after treating the fraction with various deglycosylating enzymes. The presence of 0-linked or N-linked carbohydrates in CER-extracted activated sludge EPS could not be determined by this method. The bovine fetuin used as a control does show a deglycosylation and a major protein drop from 70 killodaltons to 50 killodaltons. The overall band pattern is shifted for the bovine fetuin control, demonstrating that the denaturing deglycosylation does work for the 200 pg of glycoprotein. The WWTP- and SBRderived samples were not able to be deglycosylated possibly due to EPS carbohydrates remaining associated with exocellular proteins in the EPS following enzymatic deglycosylation. Another possibility is that the EPS glycoproteins are not attached through classical N- or Olinkages.

4.4 EPS Protein Identification In order to identify the proteins in the EPS, the EPS samples were either purified by the RPLC method or combining chemical buflfer additive with precipitating the protein. The combined method of addition of chemical buflfer additive with protein precipitation was followed by 10% Tricine-PAGE and stmning with Coomassie blue, colloidal Coomassie, or silver nitrate. After throughoutly destaining, the gel bands were excised and analyzed by ESI-LC-MS/MS.

4.4.1 Tandem Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS/MS) After RPLC, the EPS sample was digested with 0.5 pg of serine protease 0-e. trypsin) in Ix digestion buflfer. After incubation with trypsin (overnight), the enzymatic peptides obtained fi"om the EPS sample were ZipTipped through Cig column and loaded unto ESI-LC-MS/MS which employs ion trap. The MALDI-TOF-MS was not utilized due to insuflSciency of equipment parts. After running the obtained sequence on data searches such as BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) and then running the o b t^ e d spectrum on Mascot (http://www.Matrixscience.com), the parent protein producing significant alignments was identiGed to be a 3+ fragment of a peptidase (BLAST locus: ZP_00907499 http://www.ncbi.nIm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=protein&val=82744985; Mascot locus gi|82744985) (Table 4.6). (Appendix E contains the sequences producing significant alignments from BLAST data search). Peptidase M3B is a proteolytic enzyme that catalyzes the splitting of proteins into smaller peptide fractions and amino acids by proteolysis. This result was expected due to the naturally present extracellular enzymes in the activated sludge which hydrolyze organic matter in order to degrade the polymers into smaller assimilable molecules that may be taken up by bacteria for

intracellular metabolism (Ubukata, 1998; Sanders ei a l, 2000; Gessesse et al., 2003). The origin o f the en^rmes in the activated sludge may be from being attached to cell surface (ecto-enzymes) or released (exo-enzymes) into the medium in the free form prior to developing complexes with humic substances or other polymers (Cadoret ei a l, 2002). The oligoendopeptidase F found in this study is an exoenzyme because of its association with the EPS (Frolund et a l, 1995). This exoenzyme is thought to be approximately 22 kDa in length, which matches as one of the proteins bands obtained from the EPS sample (21-23 kDa region). After optimization of the chemical additive method with protein precipitation, the gel band obtained from the Tricine-PAGE was excised, digested, ZipTipped, and ran on ESI-LCMS/MS. The destaining and removal of the protein extract was performed on indiwdual gel slices contrdning a single protein band. The results of this digestion did not jaeld meaningful results, suggesting that the protein band within the Tricine-PAGE gel still contains substances that interfere with the protein analysis of the activated sludge EPS sample. Furthermore, the EPS proteins may not have been characterized and thus may not contain entries in Mascot and BLAST databases. Overall, obtmning an exoenzyme in a digested RPLC-treated EPS sample demonstrates that EPS indeed contmns a large quantity of this naturally present en^m e that degrades simple wastewater polymers into monomers in order for these substances to be taken up by the cells. This would explain the importance of high molecular weight compounds, such as glycoproteins, in the EPS that are most likely strategcally formed by the cells in order to protect these compounds from enzyme hydrolysis. It has been found by Ubukata (1998) that high molecular weight compounds are hydrolyzed slowly by hydrolases. This would explain the glycoprotein formation and potential structural role in the EPS.

CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The purpose of this study was to resolve the protein fraction in the activated sludge EPS by describing a novel purification, isolation and extraction method and endeavor to reveal that a considerable portion of the EPS proteins consist of glycosylated proteins. With the obtmed data, a better understanding of the function of EPS proteins on the floe structure and formation in the activated sludge has been acquired. Specific conclusions that can be drawn from the results presented are summarized below: 1. SBR-derived EPS samples contained less total EPS than WWTP-derived EPS samples because these are different systems. The laboratory- and full-scale systems both contained protein as the predominant constituent of the EPS, followed by carbohydrate and a smaller portion of DNA. No correlation was found between EPS content and SVI values in either sample. 2. A crude EPS samples could not be adequately resolved on Tricine-PAGE. In order to adequately resolve these EPS samples, the samples should be treated with 2mM DTT followed by P-E precipitation to cleave disulfide bond crosslinks within proteins and between protein subunits in the EPS. The EPS sample might also be treated with 1% (w/v) SDS to dissociate hydrophobic interactions from the EPS, which contains both soluble and insoluble proteins. 3. Monovalent cations, especially NaCl, were found to stabilize CER-extracted EPS proteins the best followed by Sephadex G-25 desalting column treatment. 4. Possible glycosylation or strongly noncovalent interactions between EPS protein and carbohydrate were observed using PAS stÃ¦n and glycoprotein carbohydrate estimation kit, especially after removal of hydrophobic and ionic interactions as well as disulfide

114

linkages. These glycoproteins or noncovalent proteins strongly bound with carbohydrates may potentially be adhesins, including flagella, fimbriae, and/or pili, and may act as protection against hydrolases that are naturally present in the EPS matrix. Nevertheless, these proteins were not effectively deglycosylated using enzymatic deglycosylation possibly due to their resistance to deglycosylation or not enough enzymes added to fully deglycosylate the glycoconjugates found in the EPS glycoprotein portion. 5. A 22-lcDa oligoendopeptidase F fi' om M3B family was tentatively identified as the major protein in RPLC-treated SBR-derived in-solution EPS sample. This exoenzyme is naturally present in the EPS and hydrolyzes organic matter in order for the bacteria to uptake the smaller molecules for intracellular metabolism. The in-gel digested sample did not yield meaningful results due to potentially interferences still present after various treatments and electrophoresis. This study examined the function of proteins in activated sludge floe EPS. The proteins were found to be the largest constituent of CER-extracted EPS and may possibly play a significant role in EPS structure and fijnction. EPS arrangement and allocation is of great importance seeing as it effects floe formation and other sludge properties. Consequently, a deeper knowledge of proteins in the EPS may aid in manipulation of these natural biopolymers in activated sludge floes. The EPS proteins may assist in the research of their effects on sludge properties. Furthermore, Hig^ns and Novak (1997) have identified a single 15-ldllodalton lectin by sonication extraction and NaOH digestion. Flemming and Wingender (2001) found proteins in activated sludge r a n ^ g from 5-150 kDa with no mention of the quantity of protein bands observed. Martinez et al. (2004) were the only group to list molecular weights of various

115

exopolymeric proteins obtained by EDTA EPS extraction followng dialysis. However, not a single author in previous studies has published their protein bands as a tt^ e d on SDS-PAGE and only Higgins and Novak (1997) mention the nature of these proteins. This study prowded the electrophoresis gels obtained and listed various proteins that were found. This study also attempted to identify the nature of these proteins by testing for possible interferences (i.e. from keratin, sludge supernatant and cellular proteins) and treating the EPS with various additives and a variety of purification techniques. The large quantity of extracellular proteins found in this study from WWTP may originate from wastewater products, bacterial products from cell lysis or cell secretion (exoenzymes and structural proteins). Due to the novelty of the approach in this particular area and small amount of literature published on exocellular proteins in the EPS, it is difBcult to judge and compare the previously published results to the results obtained in this study. The variation o f methods used in each study, such as sample handling (Bura et a l, 1998), and relying on sludge samples from different fiiU-scale activated sludge systems makes the comparison more tedious. To validate the results obtained in this study it would be necessaiy to replicate the results by using samples from various WWTPs and compare if there are common proteins among the samples that may be significant for EPS structure and function. These samples should also be extracted by the same method, preferably CER extraction, since this method is well established. CER is preferred to such chemical compounds as EDTA (Johnson and Peny, 1976; Brown and Lester, 1980) and NaOH due to limited risk of contamination of the samples by organic compounds and easy removal of resin from cells by settling. This method also preserves integrity of bacterial cells (Brown and Lester, 1980; Urbain et a l, 1993; Frolund et a l, 1996).

116

The identified peptidase exoenzyme in the digested protein fi-action may be significant for understanding and optimiang organic matter removal in WWTPs. The information that may be significant is the spatial and temporal variation of enzymes in EPS, the organisms that may be generating these enzymes and factors that may influence enzyme activity (Amann et ah, 1995; Gessesse et ah, 2003). The identification of a peptidase may also reveal that this enzyme cleaves the peptides produced fi'om protein digestion and thus makes it arduous to identify these proteins on MS. To protect the CER-extracted EPS proteins fi'om degradation by exoenzymes, BSA should be added prior to protein digestion for MS. Owing to inadequate quantity of parts for MALDI-Q-TOF-MS/MS, it could not be utilized in this study. Therefore, for future work it is advisable to employ MALDI-Q-TOF-MS/MS for EPS protein identification. The accuracy of glycoprotein detection in the EPS should be tested by employing other glycoprotein detection devices, such as periodic acid Pro-Q Emerald 300 dye glycoprotein detection kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). The Pro-Q Emerald 300 dye kit is specific for glycoproteins that are susceptible to precise deglycosylating enzymes and offers high sensitivity (-300 pg of glycoprotein per band). When the proteins and the glycoproteins isolated from the EPS matrix and \nsualized on polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel will be established, it may be feasible to sequence these proteins using Edman Degradation Sequencing technique. Urbain et ah (1993) have found that alanine, leucine and glycine are important amino acids in EPS proteins, and are involved in hydrophobic bonds. Edman Degradation Sequencing of treated EPS samples may reveal similar results. Following disulfide reduction, alkylation, and proteolysis of all proteins in EPS sample, for future work glycopeptide fragments may be separated by an immobilized lectin column, such

117

as convalin A (Con A). Con A is a good choice due to its broad selectivity and high afiBnity for N-type glycoproteins. If giyccpeptldes will be identified on MS, after further resolving the samples on RPLC, with identified structure and mass, then it may be useful to use an immobilized lectin column of narrow selectivity, such as lectin fi'om Bandeiraea simplicifolia

(BS-n). BS-n demonstrates high selectivity for N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) derivatized
oligosaccharides (Geng et a l, 2001). IC in fact, you could identify structural proteins in the EPS, it should be realized that the use o f antibodies on EPS proteins would be very difiScult to attain. The reason for this may be that the EPS protein fi'action must be in a very pure form to guarantee high specifidty and little cross-reactivity (Neu and Lawrence, 1999).

Appendix C: Statistical Analysis

T-Test The t-test employed for independent samples of unequal variance was based on Pagano (1993). If p<0.05, then the null hypothesis (Ho), which states that the two populations are not significantly different, would be rejected. T-test was calculated using Excel Software and results are presented in Table C.l. Table C.1 Statistical results of t-test to determine if there is any difference between CERextracted activated sludge EPS protein content (pg/ml) derived from laboratory-scale SBRs. Samples SB R l SBR 2 SBR 3 SBR 4 Observations P(T<=t) one-tail Between SBRl and 2 t critical 1-tail P(T<=t) two-tail Between SBRl and 2 t critical 2-tail P(T<=t) 1-tail Between SBR 3 and 4 P(T<=t) two-tail Between SBR 3 and 4 Average Protein Concentration (pg/ml) ... ............. 29.88 32.39 37.59 34.59 5 0.224 6.31 0.448 12.7 0.301 0.603

Since p>0.05. Ho is accepted and the SBRl and 2 and SBR 3 and 4 are not significantly different.

ANOVA

The ANOVA test was based on Pagano (1993). The means were calculated in each group (Hi, lt 2 ...etc) and overall mean was found (u). The variance was calculated in each group (Sj^ Sz^ . etc). The Ss^ was calculated to find out what group the measurement is in (Ic represented the number of groups, n represented the sample size, and N represented the population size) and Sw^ was calculated to find out the variance within each group. F-test was conducted and Ho tested if all observations came fi-om the same population (pi= pz). ANOVA was calculated using Excel Software and results are presented in Tables C.2-C.16.
