ABSTRACT Impact of Protozoan Grazing on Nitrillcation and the Ammonia- and NitriteOxidizing Bacterial Communities in Activated Sludge By: Amy Jean Pogue Environmental Applied Science and Management Masters of Applied Science 2004, Ryerson University
The effect o f protozoan grazing on nitrification rates under different conditions was exam ined. T he spatial distribution o f am m onia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (A O B and N O B) in activated sludge w as also exam ined using FISH /C SLM . B atch reactors were m onitored for am m onia, nitrite, nitrate, and total nitrogen concentrations and bacterial num bers in the presence and absence o f cyclohexim ide, a protozoan inhibitor. In the absence o f protozoan gi'azing, rates o f nitrification w ere low er than in batches with protozoa. Spatially, both A O B and N O B w ere found clustered w ithin the floc and neither inhibiting the protozoa o r inhibiting am m onia oxidation appeared to low er the am ount o f AOB and N O B present or their position. These results suggest that a reduction in protozoan gi'azing pressure allow ed the heterotrophic bacteria to proliferate w hich caused a coiTcsponding decrease in the rate o f nitrification. These results suggest that A O B and N O B are less active in the absence o f protozoa and indicates the role o f protozoa in the cycling o f nitrogen.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
T he w astew ater treatm ent process is used w orldw ide to treat both industrial and m unicipal sew age (W agner and Loy, 2002). The efficient an d effective treatm ent o f w astew ater is essential in ord er to ensure that our w ater resources are m anaged in the m ost environm entally and econom ically sustainable w ays possible. In the p ast several decades, m uch research has focused on the role o f nitriiy in g bacteria in the sew age treatm ent process. N itrifying bacteria play a crucial role in the activated sludge phase o f the sew age treatm ent process b y rem oving nitrogen from the w aste, thus preventing the discharge o f am m onium salt into receiving w aters (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). T he discharge o f am m onium salts into receiving w aters leads to oxygen consum ption, algal bloom s, a n d fish k ills via acute toxicity. T he accum ulation and diversity o f a nitrifying m icrobial com m unity in the activated sludge play s a crucial role in the perfoim ance o f nitrification in w astew ater treatm ent. O ne im portant factor affecting the productivity o f nitrifying b acteria is the presence or absence o f protozoans. P rotozoa are com m on predators o f bacteria and thus have been show n to effect nitrogen transform ation by increasing the m ineralization o f nitrogen im m obilized in the bacterial biom ass in soil and other system s such as suspended grow th reactors (C larholm , 1985; V erhagen and Laanbroek, 1992; R atsak et. al., 1996; Strauss and D odds, 1997). G razing protozoa also ensure that there are am ple nutrients available for slow grow ing nitrif)dng bacteria by grazing prim arily on fast grow ing heterotrophic bacteria in activated sludge floc (V erhagen and L aanbroek, 1992). Thus, w hen a healthy population o f protozoans are present, efficient nitrogen cycling occurs. In order to ensure that the efficiency o f nitrification (and thus the rem oval o f am m onium salts) from w astew ater is bein g m axim ized, factors that affect the nitrifying com m unity in activated sludge are being studied. The overall goal o f this study w as to exam ine the effect o f protozoan grazing on nitrification rates. T he specific objectives w ere to m onitor the concentrations o f am m onia, nitrite, an d nitrate under various conditions in the presence and in the absence o f protozoa and to exam ine the spatial distribution o f am m onia- and nitrite- oxidizing bacteria using flu o re sc e n t/« situ hybridisation (FISH ) and confocal scanning laser

m icroscopy (C SLM ). T o date, very few studies have been conducted that exam ine the link betw een the protozoan com m unity and effective nitrogen cycling in activated sludge system s specifically. In order to achieve these objectives, bioreactors containing activated sludge from a m unicipal w astew ater treatm ent plant (M W T P) w ere set up in the lab. In order to assure th e batch reactors w ere operating w ithin param en ter ranges approxim ating those o f the activated sludge process, pH , tem perature, dissolved oxygen, and chem ical oxygen dem an d w ere m easured. To assess nitrification efficiency, am m onia nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate, and total nitrogen concentrations w ere m easured. To test for the effect o f protozoan interactions cyclohexim ide, a protozoan inhibitor, w as added to the reactors. To test for the effect o f the inhibition o f nitrification, allylthiourea, an inhibitor o f am m onia oxidation, w as added. To test for the effect o f deflocculation, a problem atic phenom enon in activated sludge treatm ent plants, ethylenediam inetetraacetic acid (ED TA ) w as added. E ach set o f conditions w as established in the presence and absence o f protozoans. T he change in the position and quantity o f nitrifying b acteria in the sludge was also established u n d er each set o f conditions by using a confocal scanning laser m icroscope (C SLM ) com bined w ith fluorescent in-sitii hybridization (FIS H ), a technique used to identify specific bacterial species. B y m easuring the physical and chem ical param eters described above and using the C SLM com bined w ith FISH , w e w ill be able to determ ine how each set o f conditions affects the perform ance o f nitrification, and the nitrifying bacteria com m unity com position. It is hoped that the outcom e o f this research w ill em phasize the im portance o f m aintaining healthy protozoan-bacterial interactions in sustaining the effectiveness o f bacterial nitrification. T he relationship betw een protozoan grazing and bacterial nitrification i. f lecially applicable in system s such as activated sludge w here both

protozoan and bacterial com m unities are present and the rem o v al o f am m onia nitrogen is o f the upm ost concern. Since nitrification is an essential step in the sew age treatm ent process, ensuring that it occurs w ith optim al effectiveness is in the b est interest o f the environm ent, industry, and society as a whole.

2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 Wastewater Treatment
T he treatm ent o f w astew ater is one o f the m ost essential biotechnological processes and is used w orldw ide to treat both industrial and m unicipal sew age. T he purpose o f m unicipal w astew ater treatm ent is to prevent pollution o f the receiving w aterw ays and the subsequent problem s that arise from this pollution. C onventional w astew ater treatm ent consists o f prelim inary processes (pum ping, screening, and grit rem oval), p rim aiy settling to rem ove heavy solids and floatable m aterials, and secondary biological aeration to m etabolize and flocculate colloidal and dissolved organics. C om bined p relim inaiy and prim ary treatm ent processes rem ove approxim ately 30-50% o f the suspended solids in raw m unicipial w astew ater (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). T he rem aining organic m atter is extracted in biological secondary treatm ent to the allow able effluent residual using activated sludge processes, trickling filters, or biological tow ers (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). O f these three biological treatm ent processes, the activated sludge process has proven to be the m ost effective and econom ical, and is thus the m o st frequently used biological treatm ent process in the w estern w orld (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). The follow ing sections w ill focus on w astew ater treatm ent at A shbridges B ay W aste W ater T reatm ent P lant (W W T P) and the activated sludge process for the secondary biological treatm ent o f w astew ater.

2.1.1 Ashbridges Bay Treatment Plant: The Wastewater Treatment Process
The A shbridges B ay T reatm ent Plant (A B TP), located in T o ro n to 's E ast end at the foot o f Leslie Street, is one o f four sew age treatm ent facilities located w ithin the borders o f M etropolitan Toronto. T he p lan t serves the City o f T oronto, T he B orough o f E ast York, and parts o f the cities o f N orth Y ork and Scarborough. It is operated b y the W ater Pollution C ontrol subdivision o f the W ater and W astew ater Services departm ent o f the City o f T oronto W orks and E m ergency Services (C ity o f T oronto, 2004). T he A B T P is C an ad a's largest w astew ater treatm ent facility and covers an area o f 40.5 hectares (C ity o f T oronto, 2004). T he plant has a design capacity o f 818, 000 cubic

T he ABTP provides com plete w astew ater treatm ent including the rem oval o f suspended and biological solids, phosphorous rem oval, and disinfection.

screens are w ashed and then transported to a sanitary landfill for disposal (C ity o f Toronto, 2004). A fter prelim inary treatm ent, the screened w astew ater flows into a prim ary settling tank where it is held for several hours to allow solid particles to settle to the bottom o f the tank and oils and greases to float to th e top. T his stage o f treatm ent is know n as prim ary treatm ent and its m ain function is to allow for the physical separation o f solids and greases from the w astew ater. T he oils and greases are skim m ed o ff the top o f the w ater and collected. This is know n as prim ary or raw sludge, and is pum ped to large digestion tanks for further treatm ent (C ity o f T oronto, 2004). Follow ing prim ary treatm ent the partially treated w astew ater from the settling tank flow s by gravity to covered aeration tanks w here it is m ixed w ith solids th at contain m icroorganism s (activated sludge) that use oxygen to consum e the rem aining organic m atter in the w astew ater as th eir food supply.

T h e w astew ater, air, and activated sludge are m ixed in the aeration tanks for fo u r to six hours.

T he w astew ater that rem ains is disinfected via chlorination to kill h arm ful m icroorganism s before b ein g released into receiving waters. T he prim ary solids fro m the prim ary sedim entation tanks and solids collected from the final clarifier are sent to digestion tanks containing m icroorganism s. D uring this process, the m icroorganism s u se the organic m aterial present in the solids as a food source and convert it to by-products such as m ethane gas and w ater. D igestion results in a 90% reduction in pathogens and the production o f a w et soil-like m aterial called b iosolids that contain 95-97% w ater. T he rem aining biosolids are d e-w atered using m echanical equipm ent such as filter presses or centrifuges to reduce the volum e p rio r to b e in g sent to landfill, incinerated o r beneficially used as a fertilizer or soil am endm ent.

2.1.2 Biological Treatment: The Activated Sludge Process
A ctivated sludge p rocesses are used for both secondary biological treatm en t and com plete aerobic treatm ent w ithout prim ary sedim entation (V iessm an an d H am m er, 1998). In activated sludge treatm ent, effluent from prim ary treatm en t is pum ped into a tank and m ixed w ith a b acteria-rich slurry know n as activated sludge (M aier et al., 1999). T he m ixture o f activated sludge, w a s t e w a i e r and suspended solids p rese n t in the aeration tank is often referrred to as "m ixed liquor suspended solids" , or sim ply " m ixed liquor" . A ir or pure oxygen is pum ped through the m ixture and prom otes bacterial grow th and decom position o f the organic m aterial (M aier et al. 1999). T h e m ixture then goes to a secondary settling tan k w here w ater is siphoned o ff the top o f the tank and sludge is rem oved from the b ottom (M aier et a l , 1999). Som e o f the sludge is used as an inoculum for the incom ing prim ary effluent, w hile the rem ainder is rem oved. O n e im portant feature o f activated sludge is the recycling o f a large proportion o f the biom ass. This results in a large n u m b er o f m icroorganism s that oxidize organic m atter in a relatively short period o f tim e (M aier et ah, 1999). The prim ary feeders in acti vated sludge are bacteria and the secondar>' feeders are protozoans. A ctivated sludge rem oves the biodegradable organics as w ell as the unsettleable suspended solids fro m the w astew ater.

T he activated sludge process has been prim arily aim ed at the effective rem oval o f carbon, nitrogen, a n d p h osphorous from the w astew ater. Since its conception early in the last century, the activated sludge process has undergone various m odifications (K eller et al., 2002). Som e o f these m odifications include changes to the size, num ber, and configuration o f the reactors, changes to both the recycled and influent flow , and changes to the position and ty p e o f aeration devices (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). D espite these m odifications, to d a y 's system s are still surprisingly sim ilar to these early ones, and the three m ain fiinctions o f the activated sludge process rem ain the sam e: the rem oval o f soluble b io degradable organic com pounds from w astew ater by a flo ccu lan t slurry o f m icroorganism s through sedim entation, the recycling o f a sm all am ount o f return sludge from the clarifier underflow to the reactor, and the dependence o f the sy ste m s' high

performance on the mean cell residence tim e o f microorganisms (G rady and Lim , 1980).
T he use o f activated sludge for secondary w astew ater treatm ent has proven to be both econom ical and an effective m ethod for the rem oval o f organic com pounds from w astew ater (G rady and L im , 1980). T he activated sludge process has been renow ned for producing an effluent o f high quality at a reasonable cost. T he activated sludge process has been kn o w n to rem ove certain pollutants w ith an efficiency o f 90% or m ore (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998).

2.J.3 Parameters Affecting the Activated Sludge Process
The activated sludge process is a treatm ent process relying largely on m icroorganism s and as such is sensitive to all o f the factors that affect the m icrobial com m unity. E nvironm ental p aram eters th at adversely affect the desired m icrobial g ro w th in an . activated sludge aeration ta n k can cause production o f sludge w ith p o o r settling characteristics (V iessm an an d H am m er, 1998). T his can cause problem s such as insufficient rem oval o f organic m aterial from w astew ater, excessive p resen ce o f activated sludge floc in the final clarifier effluent, and the excessive grow th o f filam entous bacteria and algae (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). This section provides an overview o f the m ost im portant factors affecting th e activated sludge process in sew age treatm ent.

2.1.3.1 Oxidation, Temperature, and p H
A ctivated sludge is a co m pletely aerobic treatm ent process since the biological floes are suspended in a liquid m edium containing dissolved oxygen. It is essential th at aerobic conditions be m ain ta in e d in the aeration tank; how ever, in the final cla rifie r the dissolved oxygen c o n cen tratio n can b ecom e extrem ely low. D isso lv ed oxy g en (D O ) extracted from the m ix ed liq u o r is rep len ish ed b y air supplied to the aeratio n tan k (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). T h e activated sludge process depends on the p h y sio lo g y o f heterotrophic organism s that, in the presence o f oxygen, u tilize th e organic substances present in the w astew ater as a carbon source for cell synthesis and as a source o f energy. The biochem ical oxy g en dem and (B O D ) o f dom estic and industrial w astew aters is the am ount o f m olecular oxygen consum ed by m icroorganism s d u ring the biochem ical oxidation o f organic (carbonaceous B O D ) and inorganic (am m onia) m atter (M aier et al., 1999). B O D is ex erted b y three classes o f m atter: carbonaceous m aterial, oxidizable nitrogen, and certain chem ical reducing com pounds. T h e chem ical oxygen dem and is the am ount o f oxygen n ecessary to oxidize all o f the organic carbon com p letely to C O 2 and H 2 O. C O D represents the con cen tratio n o f both biod eg rad eab le an d nonbiodegradeable organics in w astew ater (M aier et al., 1999). T h e chem ical oxygen d em an d (C O D ) is a m ore com m only m ea su red p aram eter in w astew ater treatm en t p lan ts b ecau se m easuring CO D is m uch e a sie r and less tim e consum ing than the traditional 5 -d ay B O D m easurem ent.

P hosphorous is req u ired by the cell p rim arily fo r the synthesis o f n u c le ic acids and phospholipids (M adigan et al., 2000). N itrogen is a m ajor elem en t in proteins, nucleic acids, and several o th er cell constituents (M adigan e t al., 2000). N itrogen is found in nature in both org an ic an d ino rg an ic form s, w ith the bulk b ein g in inorganic form , eith er as am m onia (N H 3 ), n itra te (N O 3 ') o r Nz. The prim ary sources o f nitro g en in dom estic w aste are feces, u rin e, an d fo o d -p ro cessin g discharges.

2.1.3.3 Flocculation
A n im portant characteristic o f the bacteria p resent in the activ ated slu d g e o f the secondary w astew ater treatm en t process is their tendency to a g g re g a te into structures know n as floes. A c tiv a ted sludge floes are com plex co n so rtia o f vario u s m icroorganism s (W agner et al., 1994). In ad dition to m icroorganism s, sludge floes also co n sist o f extra polym eric substances (E P S ), organic p articles (e.g. detritus, ex tra ce llu la r p olym ers, and cellular debris), inorganic particles (e.g. clays and silts), and in terflo e spaces w hich allow for the reten tio n o r flo w th ro u g h o f w a te r (D avey & O 'T oole, 2000; D ro p p o , 2001). M any factors, such as pH , tem perature, n utrient availability, and oxy g en levels, can effect the floe com p o sitio n , stru ctu re, and function.

C hem oheterotrophs are responsible for the degradation and utilization o f the com plex and diverse array o f organic m aterials present in the activated sludge m ixed liquor, w hich are in turn converted to carbon dioxide and cell biom ass. A utotrophic bacteria use carbon dioxide as a carbon source and oxidize inorganic com pounds for energy. T h e proper operation o f the activated sludge bacterial com m unity depends o f the presence o f both heterotrophic and autotrophic organism s. T he three groups o f bacteria that are the m ost essential to the activated sludge process are the filam entous bacteria, the autotrophic bacteria responsible for nitrogen rem oval, and the bacteria cateiyzing phosphorous rem oval.

2.2.2 Protozoan Populations in Activated Sludge
Protozoans are single-celled organism s that reproduce by binary fission. T hey have com plex digestive system s, and use solid organic m atter as an energy and carbon source (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). Protozoans are a vital link in the aquatic chain o f the activated sludge treatm ent process because they ingest b acteria and algae, and also contribute to the flocculating characteristics o f activated sludge. P rotozoa are plentiful in

activated sludge plants, and it is com m on to find populations o f these organism s in the order o f 50,000 cells/m L in the m ixed liquor o f activated sludge plants (C urds, 1982). T he protozoans o f significance in activated sludge treatm ent system s are strict aerobic organism s (V iessm an and H am m er, 1978). P rotozoan species in activated sludge from W W TPs generally b elo n g to three m ain groups, nam ely: ciliates, flagellates, and am oeba (A l-Shahw ani and H oran, 1991). O ther higher sludge organism s such as nem atodes and rotifers m ay also b e present, but to a m uch lesser degree (C urds, 1982). O f these groups, the ciliates are the m ost num erous, com prising approxim ately 70% o f the protozoan com m unity in activated sludge (C urds, 1975). C iliates m ay be categorized as free sw im m ing and stalked. Free sw im m ing form s m ove rapidly in th e w ater, ingesting organic m atter at a very high rate (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). T he stalked form s attach b y a stalk to particles o f m atter and u se cilia to propel th eir head ab o u t and brin g in food. Table 2.2 lists species o f pro to zo a identified in biological sew age treatm ent program s especially activated sludge system s (A l-Shahw ani and H oran, 1991).

bacteria, w ith tw o m ajor beneficial effects on the activated sludge ecosystem . R em oval o f the bacteria stim ulates further bacterial grow th, resulting in accelerated extraction o f organic m aterial from the m ixed-liquor. Second, the flocculating properties o f activated sludge are im proved by reducing the num ber o f free bacteria in solution, and this results in a biological floe w ith im proved settling characteristics (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). Free sw im m ing ciliates are present in higher num bers w hen the surrounding solution contains a high num ber o f dispersed bacterial populations (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). W lien dispersed bacteria becom e scarce, stalked protozoans increase in num bers. Stalked protozoans do n o t require as m uch energy as free-sw im m ing protozoans, and therefore they com pete m ore effectively in a system w ith low bacterial concentrations (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). Thus, in w ell-flocculating activated sludge w ith lim ited num bers o f dispersed bacteria, attached ciliates are the m ost biologically im portant protozoa (C urds, 1982; V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). A ttached ciliates can grow alone or in large colonies. Figure 2.2 show s several species o f attached ciliates com m only present in activated sludge sam ples (U C L A , 2003). In all o f the publications on the role or protozoa in the purification o f sew age, it is generally agreed that the prim ary role o f protozoa in the activated sludge process is the clarification o f the effluent (C urds, 1982). The exact extent and m eans b y w hich protozoa clarify the effluent is still not com pletely understood. T he significant drop in both the num bers o f bacteria and the am ount o f nonsettleable suspended solids in effluents could be the resu lt o f two factors: predation or flocculation. A considerable am ount o f evidence in literature shows that protozoa in pure culture are able to flocculate suspended particulate m atter and bacteria, w hich aids in both the clarification o f effluent and in the form ation o f sludge (Curds, 1982; Curds and H aw kes, 1982; V iessm an and Ham m er, 1998). Som e earlier studies postulated that protozoan-induced flocculation was brought about directly by the secretion o f a m ucous-like substance from the peristom e region o f the protozoa (C urds, 1982). H ow ever, it is now generally ag reed upon that the m ajor role o f protozoa in activated sludge treatm ent processes is the rem oval o f dispersed grow ths o f bacteria by predation, and th at increased flocculation is a resu lt o f this activity (Curds, 1982; V iessm an and H am m er, 1998).

In addition to the recognized ro le o f protozoa as bacterial predators w hose activities induce good effluent quality, there have also been attem pts to relate the physico-chem ical param eters o f activated sludge (i.e. food/m icroorganism (F/M ) ratio, th e effluent biological oxygen dem and (B O D ), and the m ixed liquor suspended solids (M L SS) content) to the species o f ciliated protozoa present (A l-Shahw ani and H oran, 1991; Esteban et ah, 1991; M adony et ah, 1993). T his research is based on the general observation th at the relative dom inance o f different protozoan groups changes w ith changes in plant perform ance, and that the num bers o f m orphological species drop as plant perform ance deteriorates. M adoni (1994) developed a concept o f a sludge biotic index (SBI) based on this idea. The general idea behind the use o f p ro to z o a as ' indicator species' for the activated sludge process is that if the protozoan population is ideal, then the bacterial p opulation w ill also be optim al, and the rem oval o f w aster products will occur in the m ost efficien t w ay possible. M ore recent research on the role o f protozoa in the activated sludge system has focused on the role o f protozoa in enhancing nutrient cycling and carbon m ineralization. In literature there are three dom inant hypotheses to explain w hy p ro to zo a m ay enhance the m ineralization o f organic com pounds. O ne such hypothesis is that as a b y -product o f their m etabolic activities, protozoa excrete m ineral nutrients (phosphorous as phosphate, nitrogen as am m onia o r nitrate). This excretion results in increased substrate availability (i.e. C iN ' .P ratio), w h ich in turn causes an accelerated use o f carbon-sources by bacteria ( V arm a et al., 1975; C olem an et al., 1978; C larholm , 1985). A nother hypothesis is that

protozoa excrete grow th stim ulating com pounds such as vitam ins, am ino acids, and nucleotides w hich enhance bacterial activity (R atsak et ah, 1996). T h e im pact o f protozoan grazing on the selection o f bacteria is another hypothesis u se d to explain the effect o f protozoan grazing on nutrient m ineralization. G razing o f b a c te ria leads to the selection o f species th at can grow fast and inefficiently and thus increase the use o f carbon sources (R atsak et ah, 1996). Inefficient bacterial species m ust d issim ilate m ore m aterials to form the sam e am ount o f biom ass. G razing o f bacteria by protozoa in itself also results in a decrease in biom ass concentration. All this am ounts to a loss o f energy in the resulting activated sludge food chain (R atsak et al., 1996). '

A ctivated sludge consists o f a com plex and diverse consortium o f b acterial, protozoan, and m etazoan p opulations. Indeed, an activated sludge tan k m ay b e tho u g h t o f as a com plex ecosystem created by hum ans. Like in any ecosystem th ere is an interactive association betw een m icroorganism s called a consortium , that results in com bined m etabolic activities. T h ese m icrobial populations interact w ithin the com m unity. The

m icrobial com m unity is structured in such a way that each p opulation contributes to its m aintenance. Som e m icrobial populations in a com m unity com pete for resources in such a way th a t they m ay ad versely influence each other, som etim es resu ltin g in the exclusion o f a species from the com m unity. O ther m icrobial populations h av e cooperative relationships w h ere the interactions betw een populations are beneficial, allow ing them to live w ith in close pro x im ity o f each other. Y et another type o f relationship is that exhibited b etw een a p red ato r and its prey. A know ledge o f th e relationships, both cooperative and com petitive, and predatory, betw een various m icrobial populations in m ixed cultures is essential to understanding the activated sludge treatm en t process.

2.2.3.1 Microbial Competition in Activated Sludge
W hen org an ic m atter is m ade available to a m ixed population o f m icroorganism s, com petition arises for this food betw een various species. T heoretically, the com petitive exclusion p rinciple dictates that com petition w ill elim inate all b u t one o f th e populations com peting for the sam e substrates.

T he species o f d o m in an t p rim ary bacteria present depends on the n a tu re o f th e organic w aste p resent and on the environm ental conditions in the a ctiv ated sludge aeratio n tanks. W h en environm ental co n ditions are adverse to bacterial grow th (i.e. low pH , low dissolved o xygen, n u trien t shortages), the norm al bacterial m icro flo ra m ay be outcom peted b y filam entous fungal species w ho p roliferate u n d e r th ese conditions (Seviour, 1999). T h is p h enom enon is know n as activated sludge b u lking, and is com m only a problem in plants w ith low pH . W hen environm ental co n ditions are stable and ideal fo r bacterial grow th, a w ell-adapted bacterial pop u latio n v/ill often becom e dom inant. A t the initial stage o f sludge form ation, w hen the activ ated sludge is still

T his is true in sew age treatm ent facilities w h ere an ab u n d an ce o f available organic substrates favours the grow th o f rapidly dividing b acteria. W h en the F /M ratio becom es lo w er due to decom position o f organic m aterial b y b o th b acteria and protozoa, or by a red u c tio n in org an ic influent loading rates, the fast-g ro w in g r-strategists are easily rep la ce d b y a m ore diverse com m unity o f slow grow ing K -strateg ist bacterial species that h av e a high affinity for nutrients th at are p rese n t in low concentrations (M aier et ah, 1999). T he presence o f p ro to z o a can have a significant effect on co m p etitio n b etw een bacterial species. F o r instance, pro to zo an grazing is generally b eliev ed to stim u late the decom position rate, thus releasin g nutrients such as N and P into th e surrounding environm ent.

2.4.1 Nitrification
A m m onium (and u rea th at is hydrolyzed to am m onium ) is the m ajor nitrogen com pound o f sew age and is rem oved in W W T Ps by conversion first to nitrate and th en to gaseous nitrogen. T he conversion o f am m onium to nitrate is know n as nitrification and is one o f the m ost im portant processes in the biological treatm ent o f w aste.

2.4.1.1 The Nitrification Process
N itrification is catalyzed by tw o different groups o f slow grow ing, autotrophic bacteria the am m onia oxidizers and the nitrite oxidizers (W agner and Loy, 2002). The conversions perform ed by these tw o bacterial groups can be described b y equation 1.3 and equation 1.4 below ; N H 4 + + 1.502 N O 2' + H 2 O + + 250 kJ (E quation 2.3)

N O 2 ' + O.5 O 2

N O 3 - + 75 kJ (E quation 2.4)

Several conditions m ust be fulfilled before nitrification can occur in activated sludge system s. T he m ost critical is the sludge retention tim e (SRT) in the aeration tank (Toerien et al., 1990). T he sludge retention tim e is the inverse o f the sp ecific grow th rate (p) o f the nitrifiers (M cC lintock et ah, 1992). As such, the SRT or the m ean cell residence tim e (M C R T ) m ust be long enough that the nitrifying bacteria can m ultiply at a higher rate than they are rem oved from the system . B y increasing sludge age o r SRT, the w ashout o f n itrifying b acteria can be avoided and the nitrite/nitrate rem oval efficiencies increase (M cC lintock et ah, 1992; V iessm an and H am m er, 1998; B lackall and B urrell, 1999). E xtending the SR T likely aids in increasing the num ber o f am m onia oxidizing bacteria in the system (M cC lintock et ah, 1992). O ther conditions th at are im portant in m aintaining an optim al nitrification rate are an adequate hydraulic retention tim e (H R T ) betw een the nitrifying b acterial biom ass and the am m onia and nitrite in w astew ater to ensure that the com plete oxidation o f these nutrients can occur (B lackall and B urrell, 1999). Successful nitrification also depends on providing a suitable pH , tem perature, and dissolved oxygen level (refer to section 2.1.3.1 above). ·

B oth the sludge age and the tem perature will largely determ ine the kind o f nutrients that w ill be rem oved in the activated sludge process. F o r nitrogen rem oval, a sludge age and tem perature o f betw een 3 days at 25°C,
6

days at 15°, or even up to 15 to 20 days at 7°C

are needed for nitrogen rem oval (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). U nderstanding the ecology o f nitrifying bacteria in activated sludge is o f considerable im portance, because nitrification is often referred to as the "achilles h eel" o f the activated sludge process, and i f nitrifiers are w ashed out o f the system , the recovery o f the nitrification process is u sually a lengthy and expensive task (W agner and Loy, 2002).

2,4,1.2 Nitrifying Microorganisms in Activated Sludge
In w astew ater treatm ent plants, the oxidation o f am m onia to nitrite is perform ed by a w ide variety o f different beta proteobacterial am m onium oxidizers (W agner and Loy, 2002). A recent study by Juretschko et al. (1998) revealed that in addition to the w idely know n am m onia oxidizer Nitrosom onas europaea, am m onia oxidation is also perform ed by Nitrosomonas eutropha, Nitrosococcus mobilis, m em bers o f the Nitrosom onas marina cluster, and four other phylogenetic lineages for w hich no culture representative exists. These finding are consistent w ith other studies o f the quantitative am m onia oxidizer com m unity in W W TPs (Juretschko et ah, 1998; D aim s et al., 2001(b);G ieseke et al., 2001; L iebig et al., 2001).T his study also concluded that, in contrast to other ecosystem s such as soil, am m onia oxidizers o f the genus Nitrosospira are not im portant in w astew ater treatm ent processes. N itrite oxidation is perform ed by another group o f bacteria, separate from the am m onia oxidizers discussed above. R ecent in situ research found that y et uncultured Nitrospiralike m icroorganism s, and not Nitrobacter species, are the dom inating nitrite oxidizers in activated sludge (B urrell et ah, 1998; Juretschko et ah, 1998; O kabe et ah, 1999; D aim s et ah, 2000; D aim s et ah, 2001 (a); G ieseke et ah, 2001). Nitrospira-\\k.c nitrite oxidizers are probably K -strategists (w ith high substrate affinities and low m axim um activity or grow th rate) for oxygen and nitrite and therefore outcom pete N itrobacter species under the substrate lim iting conditions present in activated sludge (W agner and Loy, 2002). A s discussed above, the activated sludge process relies on the biom ass in floes being recycled through the system as it actively rem oves nutrients from the w astew ater. Floe

form ing bacteria w ill therefore b e selected for and retained in the system (T oerien et al., 1990). M icrobes that are retained in the system , how ever, w ill only survive if they are able to tolerate the environm ental conditions present in activated sludge plants, in particular the fluctuations in the dissolved oxygen levels. F ortunately, nitrifying bacteria possess the ability to flocculate and also can sur\'ive at v arious levels o f dissolved oxygen (Toerien e t al., 1990). Even w ith these abilities, the proportion o f nitrifiers in the m ixed liquor o f an activated sludge tan k is typically low (betw een 2-5% ) (B lackall and Burrell, 1999). T h eir grow th rate is also low com pared w ith that o f heterotrophs because their cell yield p e r unit o f energy obtained is low (Blackall and B urrell, 1999). A lso, the oxidation o f organic com pounds by heterotrophs releases far m ore energy that the oxidation o f nitrogenous com pounds by nitrifying bacteria (B lackall and B urrell, 1999). N itrifiers grow m ore slow ly in sew age th an in pure cultures or in o th er soil environm ents (Blackall and B urrell, 1999). This slow er grow th rate is probably due to the presence o f inhibitors from the sew age and the other m icrobes, predation, and the presence o f less than optim al and often fluctuating dissolved oxygen conditions, tem perature, o r pH conditions. A lthough the m ain role o f heterotrophs in the activated sludge system is m ainly the rem oval o f biodegradeable carbonaceous com pounds, th eir exact effect on the population o f nitrifying bacteria is still unclear. There is evidence that they m ay be differential, either inhibiting or prom oting nitrification activity (B lackall and Burrell,

1999).
It is well established in literature that grow th rates o f Nitrosomonas are m uch low er than those o f N itrobacter (B ock at. al, 1992). Nitrosomonas grow th is lim ited by the am m onium concentration, w hile N itrobacter grow th is lim ited by the nitrite ion concentration. In the past, it w as assum ed that due to the slow grow th o f Nitrosomonas, the rate lim iting step in nitrification is the conversion o f am m onia to nitrite by

Nitrosomonas. H ow ever, since recent in situ studies discussed above (B urrell et al.,
1998; Juretschko et ah, 1998; O kabe et ah, 1999; D aim s et ah, 2000; D aim s et ah, 2001 (a); G ieseke et ah, 2001) h a v e indicated that Nitrobacter is n ot the m o st im portant nitrite oxidizer, this theory w ill have to exam ined in future studies.

In the future, m ore research is needed on the factors that influence the grow th o f nitrifying b acteria and factors that increase or decrease nitrification rates. Increased nitrification rates will lead to m ore com plete rem oval o f nitrogen from the system and a h ig h er quality effluent.

2.4.2 Dénitrification
D enitrification is the process w here N O 3 ' and or nitrite are reduced to N O , N 2 O, or N?, and represents one o f the key p rocesses in the nitrogen cycle. A sim plified representation o f the denitrification reaction is show n in equation 2.5. NO ]- +

AG = -212 kcal/8e' transfer D enitrification is actually a four-step process involving four separate enzym es: N itrate reductase (reduction o f nitrate to nitrite); N itrite reductase (conversion o f nitrite to nitric oxide); N itric oxide reductase (conversion o f nitric oxide to nitrous oxide); and N itrous oxide reductase (conversion o f nitrous oxide to dinitrogen gas) (M aier et al., 2000). The extent to w hich denitrification occurs depends on the conditions p resen t in the system . F o r exam ple, nitrous oxide reductase is inhibited by conditions o f low pH and high oxygen levels. Thus, in conditions o f low pH or high oxygen, nitrous oxide, rath er than nitrogen gas, w ill be the final product o f denitrification (M aier et al., 2000). T he extent o f denitrification is also determ ined by the initial nitrate levels in an environm ental system . L ow nitrate levels tend to favour the production o f nitrous oxide, w hile higher nitrate levels favour th e p roduction o f nitrogen gas (the favourable end product). Ideally, denitrification w ill occu r w hen w astew ater becom es anaerobic in the final clarifier step o f the w astew ater treatm ent process, and result in the release o f nitrogen gas (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). In contrast to am m onia and n itrite oxidation, the capability to an aerobically resp ire with nitrate (or nitrite) is w id esp read in the bacterial com m unity. T he dissim ilatory reduction o f nitrate is com m only found in bacteria, and m ore than 130 species o f heterotrophic bacteria are now know n that can denitrify (Zum ft, 1992). A s such, it is im possible to predict using m odem m ethods such as environm entally retriev ed 16S rR N A sequences.

w hether a m icroorganism is actually perform ing denitrification (W ag n er and Loy, 2002). T his difficulty is re fle c te d by the fact th at the identity o f im portant in situ denitrifiers in W W TPs is still n o t know n (W agner and Loy, 2002). Several studies have identified bacterial species cap ab le o f denitrification from W W T ? sam ples (G um aelius et al., 2001; K han and H iraishi, 2001), the m ere detection o f these bacteria does n o t prove that they are actually den itrify in g (W agner and L oy, 2002). Future attem pts to identify the m ain denitrifiers in activ ated sludge m ay rely on the use o f m icroautoradiography (M A R ) com bined w ith flo u rescen t in situ hybridization (FISH ). B y co m b in in g M A R and FISH , m etabolically active denitrifiers can be identified and enum erated (W ag n er and Loy, 2002). Prelim inary studies by W agner (unpublished data) on activated sludge in an industrial w astew ater treatm ent plant using M A R and FISH show ed that

Botaproteobacteria related to the Azoarcus-Thauera com plex are likely abundant
denitrifiers (W agner and L oy, 2002).

2.5 The Role of Protozoan Predation in Nutrient Cycling and Energy Flow in Activated Sludge
N utrient cycling a n d energy flow are centered on photosynthesis and plant grow th, since plant tissue form s th e g reatest portion o f the ea rth 's biom ass (S tout, 1980). H ow ever, all organism s participate in the flow o f nutrients and energy through an ecosystem . T he role o f protozoa in n u trien t cycling and energy flow is determ ined b y th eir bionom ics. The distinctive features o f p ro to zo a are their small size, their h ig h rate o f reproduction, their high conversion efficiency o f nutrients to new cell tissue, and their p o ten tially high m etabolic rates (S tout, 1980). Protozoa generally live in asso ciatio n w ith a w ide range o f m icroorganism s th a t function together as a m icrocosm . The role o f protozoa in reducing bacterial num bers in the efflu en t and encouraging flocculation through predation has been discussed above. T here is also evidence that prey-predator relatio n s involving protozoa play a role in the cycling o f nutrients and flow o f energy w ithin an ecosystem . Early studies by Johannes (1965) p o stu la te d that protozoan p redation w ould stim ulate bacterial grow th rates and h ence substrate uptake rates. T his theory w as supplem ented b y H unt et al. (1977) w ho developed a sim ulation m odel for the effect o f p redation on bacteria in continuous culture. T h ey concluded that

Several m ore recen t studies h av e focused specifically on the ro le o f p ro to zo an predation on nitrogen cycling in activated sludge. A study b y V erhagen and L aan b ro ek (1992) observed that in su sp en d ed grow th chem ostat studies w ith n itrify in g b a c te ria that the presence o f p ro to zo a increased per-cell nitrification rates. A v e ry rec e n t study by P etropoulos (2003) con clu d ed th at the efficiency o f nitrificatio n (as m easu red by nitrate, nitrite, and am m onia p ro d u ctio n rates) increased in the p resen ce o f p rotozoa, likely due to the ability o f p ro to zo a to reg u late bacterial grow th. T here is an abundance o f research docum enting how the p resen ce o f p ro to zo a can change the com position o f bacterial com m unities (H abte and A lexander, 1975; H ah n and H ofle, 2001 ; R onn et ah, 2002). T here is also a strong interest in m icro b ial eco lo g y research to

illum inate the relatio n sh ip betw een structure and function o f b a c te ria l corm nunities. An im portant question th at m ust be researched further is w h eth er p red atio n as a structuring force for bacterial com m unities results in im portant co nsequences for the function o f bacterial corm nunities such as the rates o f organic carbon d ecom position, respiration, m ineralization, and specific transform ations o f organic and ino rg an ic m atter (Jurgens and M atz, 2002). To date, studies w hich have exam ined the im pact o f p ro tista n grazing on m icrobial p rocesses have g en erally found an enhancem ent o f bacterial activ ity and decom position rates. H ow ever, m ore research involving M A R to p ro v e increased m etabolic rates in th e p resen ce o f protozoan grazing needs to b e u n dertaken. A lso, the exact m echanism b y w hich bacterial activity is enhanced by p ro to z o a n grazin g is still not clear. Several studies have suggested that increased rem in eralizatio n by pro tists and selection fo r fast g ro w in g b acteria m ay explain the enhanced n u trie n t cy clin g rates observed.

T o reso lv e sp atial reso lu tio n at the cellular level, ep iflu o rescen ce m icro sco p y or confocal scanning lase r m icroscopy (C SL M ) is a valu ab le tool.

It is only through the use o f FIS H com bined w ith C L SM that researchers are able to determ ine b oth the com position, and spatial distribution, o f bacteria w ithin floes.

2.8.4 The Com bined use o f F IS H using rRNA Targeted Oligonucleotide Probes and CLSM fo r the Identification and Spatial Visualization o f N itrifying Bacteria
O ne o f the first In situ analyses perform ed on activated sludge w as perform ed by W agner et al. (1994). In this study, several general bacterial probes w ere used to determ ine the spatial distribution o f bacteria in activated sludge floes. It w as found that fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes penetrated even to the deeper regions o f thick sludge floes, and bacteria w ere not ju s t located on the outside o f the floe. T his study also found sludge floe diam eter to be betw een 5 and 50 pm after cell fixation and hybridization. T his floe diam eter corresponded well w ith other studies o f floe size in untreated sludge sam ples (A ndreadakis, 1993), indicating that the hybridization procedure does n o t affect the floe size (W agner et al., 1994). A later study by W agner et al. (1995) w as one o f the first studies using FISH and CLSM attem pting to identify am m onia oxidizing bacteria in activated sludge sam ples. In this study, W agner used probes targeting am m onia oxidizers and found that am m onia oxidizing bacteria are clustered into m icrocolonies and generally located w ithin the sludge floes rather than on the outside (W agner et ah, 1995). T his finding corresponds w ith subsequent findings that also found A O B s positioned near the interior o f the floe (M obarry et ah, 1996; W agner et ah, 1996; W agner et ah, 1998). M any early studies on the presence and position o f nitrite oxidizing b acteria w ithin activated sludge floes focused on the N itrobacter species. T hese studies found that am m onia and n itrite oxidizers often grow near the interior o f activated sludge floes in closely associated aggregates (M obarry et ah, 1996; W agner et ah, 1996). H ow ever, as indicated in section 2.4.1.2 above, recent studies have indicated that Nitrospira-W kt 42

bacteria, a n d not N itrobacter, are the dom inant nitrite oxidizers in activated sludge plants (B urrell et al., 1998; Ju retsch k o e t al., 1998; O kabe et al., 1999; D aim s et al., 2000; D aim s et al., 2001 (a); G ieseke et al., 2001,). It was found that tw o phylogenetically different groups o f n itro sp ira-lik e nitrite oxidizers frequently form tight m icrocolonies w ith w ater peiTneable channels (D aim s et al., 2001 (a)). It w as also found that they are located n ear the in terio r o f the floe, adjacent to am m onia oxidizers (D aim s et al.,

2001(a)).
It is im portant to note that p h y siologically inactive A O Bs and N O B s w ill also be detected using FISH as these b acteria m aintain high cellular ribosom e contents even under unfavourable conditions (W ag n er et al., 1995). The num ber o f physiologically active am m onia a n d nitrite o x idizers can be determ ined using FISH com bined w ith M A R w ith ' `'C -labelled bicarbonate as substrate (L ee et al., 1999). R ecently, A dam czyk et al. (2003) introduced the isotope array approach. This new technique can be used to identify m icroorganism s that consum e a '"'C-labelled substrate and has been u sed successfully to quantify the C O 2 fixation activities o f A O B s in activated sludge and is m uch less tedious and tim e consum ing than the F IS H -M A R m ethod (A dam czyk et al., 2003).

2.9 Experimental Objectives
A lthough several studies h av e been conducted that relate grazing o f protozoa to increased nitrification rates (C larholm , 1984; V erhagen and L aanbroek, 1992; Strauss and D odds, 1997; P etropoulos, 2003), v ery few o f these (w ith exception to P etro p o u lo s') have been exam ined in activated sludge system s, and none have attem pted to establish the effect o f protozoan grazing on b a c te ria l nitrification in activated sludge under various conditions. T here have also b een m any studies perform ed th a t have exam ined the position o f nitrifying b acteria (both A O B and N O B ) in activated sludge floe (W agner et al., 1994; W agner et al., 1995; M o b arry e t al., 1996; W agner et al., 1996; B urrell et al., 1998; Juretschko et al., 1998; W a g n er et al., 1998; O kabe et al., 1999; D aim s et al., 2000; D aim s et al., 2001(a); G iesek e et al., 2001). H ow ever, none o f these studies attem pted to use FISH /C S L M to d eterm in e the position and relative abundance o f nitrifying bacteria under various conditions an d w ith and w ithout the presence o f protozoan grazing.

The objectives o f this study w ere tw o-fold. First, I w ished to exam ine the effect o f protozoan grazing on nitrification rates under various conditions that m ay occur during the w astew ater treatm ent process, such as deflocculation and partial inhibition o f nitrification. I also w ish ed to study the spatial distribution o f am m onia- and nitriteoxidizing bacteria in activated sludge under various conditions in the presence and absence o f protozoan grazing. It w as hypothesized that an increase in nitrification w ould be observed in the p resen ce o f protozoan grazing due to the ability o f protozoa to control populations o f heterotrophic bacteria that otherw ise com pete w ith nitrifiers for nutrients such as am m onia. It w as also hypothesized that a change in the relative abundance and position o f both nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria w ould be observed under the different conditions tested and in the presence and absence o f protozoan grazing. In the presence o f protozoan grazing it w as postulated that m ore nitrifying bacteria m ay be observed through F ISH /C S L M , and in the absence o f protozoan grazing it was postulated that m ore heterotrophic bacteria m ay be observ^ed and that nitrifiers w ould be located deeper w ithin activated sludge floes. It is hoped that the outcom e o f this study w ill provide further insight into the relationship betw een protozoa grazing and bacterial nitrification as applied to th e activated sludge phase o f m unicipal w astew ater treatm ent.

4.0 RESULTS 4.1 Performance of the Bench Scale Batch Microcosms
B ench scale batch m icrocosm s w ere m onitored over a 14-day period. T em perature and pH were m o nitored on a daily basis throughout the 14-day trials. D isso lv ed oxygen, CO D, am m onia, total nitrate and nitrite, and total nitrogen levels w ere m easured o n day 1 ,4 ,7 , 10, and 14. C ell counts to m easure m icrobial abundance w ere perfo rm ed on day 1, 7, and 14. F or tab les containing all data collected throughout the 14-day trial the reader is referred to A ppendix A o f this report.

4.1.1 Temperature, pH, and Dissolved Oxygen
T he tem perature (F igure 4.1) w as relatively stable for the duration o f each trial. Since the tem perature varies w ith the am bient tem perature in the laboratory setting, som e variation in tem perature is expected. V ariation b etw een trials run at d ifferent tim es occurred, and was m ost likely a re su lt in variation the am bient laboratory tem perature. F o r all trials, the daily tem perature rem ain ed betw een 23.2°C and 26.4°C T he pH w as also m onitored on a daily basis for each trial (Figure 4.2). In the reference trial, the cyclohexim ide trial, the ED TA trial, and the E D T A + cyclohexim ide trial, the pH decreased from approxim ately 7.5 on day 1 o f the trial to 4.9, 4.79, 4.71 and 4.73 respectively, by day 14. B etw een day 1 and day 10, the pH for the reference, cyclohexim ide, E D T A , and E D T A + cyclohexim ide trials did not drop b elo w 6.4. At below 6.4, nitrification is know n to occur at less than 50% o f the m axim um rate o f nitrification (S eviour, 1999; V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). F or every m illigram o f nitrogen nitrified, 7.2 m g o f alkalinity is consum ed. T hus, there is a net p roduction o f acid during nitrification o f w astew ater, and a drop in pH as n itrification proceeds is expected. Interestingly, in th e ally lth io u rea and the allylthiourea + cyclohexim ide trials, the pH actually increased thro u g h o u t the 14-day trial. In the allylthiourea trial the pH increased from a value o f 7.49 at day one to a value o f 8.87 on day 14 and in the ally lth io u rea + cyclohexim ide trial the p H increased from 7.49 on day 1 to 8.60 on day 14

throughout the entire 14-day period. In the E D T A and E D T A + cyclohexim ide trials, the dissolved oxygen c o n ten t w as slightly higher during the first tw o days o f m easurem ent (day one and day four) but then dropped to
8

m g O 2/L and rem ained at this level for the

duration o f the trial. D isso lv ed oxygen levels below 0.3 m g/L are know n to inhibit nitrification, w hile a t 1.0 m g/L the nitrification rate is 90% o f that observed in oxygen saturated w ater (B lackall and B urrell, 1999). It is im portant to note that the dissolved oxygen m easured in this stu d y is the dissolved oxygen co n ten t o f the m ixed liquor. The dissolved oxygen content in the interior o f the biological floes depends on floe characteristics such as size and depth. Thus, the nitrification rates w ill largely be affected by the dissolved oxy g en available to nitrifying bacteria w ithin the floes. A m ixed liquor dissolved oxygen c o n ten t o f approxim ately 8.0 m g/L is indicative o f adequate aeration and it is probable th at floe bacteria w ill have sufficient dissolved oxygen available to them.

In the reference reactors, nitrate levels increased over the 10-day period from 1.11 mg NOyVL on day 1 to 1.91 m g NO3VL on day 10. In the cyclohexim ide treated reactors, nitrite levels rem ain ed fairly constant over the 10-day period, but there w as an overall slight decrease from 1.11 m g NO3VL on d a y l to 1.03 m g NO3VL on day 10. A s w as the case in the m onitoring o f nitrite levels, the levels o f nitrate in the allylthiourea and allylthiourea + cylohexim ide trials fluctuated throughout the trial. In both o f these trials,

there was an overall decrease in nitrate production from 1.41 m g NO3VL on day 1 to 1.09 an d 0.89 m g N O s'/L in the allylthiourea and allylthiourea + cyclohexim ide trials, respectively. B oth trials w ere characterized by a decrease in nitrite levels on day 4, follow ed by an increase on day 7 and subsequent decrease to below day 1 levels by day 10.

4.1.3 10-day R ates o f Am m onia, Nitrite, Nitrate, and Total Nitrogen Production
In order to m ore accurately track nitrification activity, production rates o f am m onia, nitrite, nitrate, and total nitrogen w ere calculated over the 10-day m onitoring period. For details on how these rates w ere calculated the reader is referred to section 3.6 o f this report. A positive p roduction rate m eans that the am ount o f param eter increased over the 10-day period, w hile a negative production rate denotes a decrease in the am ount o f the param eter. A production rate o f zero denotes that there was no change in the m easured param eter o \ e r the 10 day period. In order to com pare the prod u ctio n rates o f each param eter betw een the different treatm ents, a paired t-test was used. A significance level (a) o f 0.05 (95% confidence lim its) was selected for all statistical analyses. T able 4.1 sum m arizes th e outcom e o f all the com parisons perform ed. A P -value o f less than 0.05 denotes a statistically significant difference betw een sam ples.

5.0 DISCUSSION 5.1 The Role of Protozoa in Activated Sludge from Ashbridges Bay WWTP
It is generally agreed in the literature that protozoa exert an influence on the m ineralization o f organic com pounds in three m ain ways; 1) By the excretion o f m ineral nutrients such as am m onia w hich results in an accelerated use o f carbon-sources by bacteria (Strauss and D odds, 1997; V erhagen and Laanbroek, 1992) 2) B y the excretion o f protozoa o f grow th-stim ulating com pounds that enhance bacterial activity (N isbet, 1984). 3) B y protozoan grazing on bacteria that m ay lead to the selection o f certain fast grow ing bacterial species depending on the environm ental conditions present (Sinclair and A lexander, 1989). Several studies have attem pted to directly link protozoan predation to nitrification in activated sludge system s. T he outcom e o f these studies have suggested that the presence o f protozoan grazing actually enhances nitrification rates in activated sludge system s (Strauss and D odds, 1997; C larholm , 1985; V erhagen and L aanbroek, 1992; V erhagen and Laanbroek, 1991). A v e r y recent study by Petropoulos (2003) attem pted to directly link the presence or absence o f protozoa to nitrification w ithin the activ ated sludge system by directly inhibiting protozoa activity and m onitoring activated sludge param eters. Petropoulos (2003) found that the efficiency o f nitrification increased in the

presence o f protozoan grazing and decreased in the absence o f protozoa. P e tro p o u lo s' study also utilized activated sluoge from A shbridges B ay W W T P, and a protozoan species survey w as carried out on sludge sam ples. T he outcom e o f the protozoan species surs'ey perform ed by Petropoulos is show n in T able 5.1.

This com m unity com position is typical o f the protozoan com m unity existing in activated sludge environm ents (A l-S haw hani and H oran, 1991; Curds, 1982). Petropoulos (2003) also enum erated p ro to zo a found in sludge from the A shbridges B ay WAVTP, and typical protozoan num bers w e re found to be approxim ately 9.50 X 10^ cells/m L . T he current study did n o t undertake a protozoan suiwey or count o f the activated sludge from A shbridges B ay W W T P. H ow ever, it can be assum ed that the protozoan com m unity com position and the protozoan abundance o f the activated sludge used in this study is very sim ilar to the com m unity com position and abundance determ ined b y Petropoulos (2003). A n idea o f the role o f protozoa in nutrient cycling in the activ ated sludge system as well as a know ledge o f the protozoan com m unity com position and abundance is im portant in order to assess the influence o f p ro to zo a on nitrification rates under the different conditions exam ined in this study. 5.2 P e rfo rm a n c e o f th e B a tc h R e a c to rs T he batch system is a very p o p u lar system used to study interactions w ithin the activated sludge environm ent fo r a variety o f reasons. B atch reactors have short life spans, and no feed system needs to b e im plem ented. T he batch system is v ery short-lived (i.e. one to tw o w eeks). I f nutrients are not replaced, the system w ill eventually break dow n and the

biological com m unity w ill be elim inated. In this study, no nu trien t replacem ent fluid was used. This is because in order to track the change in param eters bro u g h t about by the different conditions im plem ented in this trial, nutrient replacem ent could not be perform ed. H ow ever, param eters such as tem perature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and COD w ere m onitored throughout the trial to ensure that the system w as still operating and system break-dow n had not occurred. B atch reactors w ere m odified by inhibiting protozoan activity through the use o f cyclohexim ide, inhibiting am m onia oxidation through the used o f allylthiourea, and inducing deflocculation through the use o f ED TA . The partial or com plete inhibition o f nitrification is a com m on and extrem ely serious problem in VAVTPs. B y several pathw ays (e.g. nondegradeable residues in sew age treatm ent plant, residues in m anure or sludge used as fertilizer on fields or from surplus drugs in aquaculture) antibacterial agents that inhibit nitrification m ay reach the environm ent (H alling-S orenson, 2001). D eflocculation is also a periodic problem in the activated sludge process and can be brought on by low pH , tem perature shock, and by the sporadic input o f toxic chem icals from industrial and com m ercial discharges (B ott and Love, 2002; Liao et al., 2002). The m onitoring o f the b atch reactors under the various conditions in this trial w as undertaken in order to assess how protozoan presence affects nitrification u n d er each condition.

5.2.1 Temperature, pH , and Dissolved Oxygen
T he general perform ance o f the batch reactors was assessed by m easurem ent o f pH , tem perature, dissolved oxygen, and chem ical oxygen dem and. Since the activated sludge process is a biotic process and relies heavily on the existence o f health y m icrobial com m unities, the m aintenance o f param eters w ithin ranges th at are conducive to m icrobial grow th is essential. T he pH , tem perature, and dissolved oxygen content o f

batch reactors m ust be carefully m onitored as the fluctuation o f these param eters from norm al values is indicative o f a breakdow n o f the reactor ecosytem (C urds, 1972; Curds,

1974; Stout 1980).
T he m inim um tem perature observed for all trials w as 23.6°C and the m axim um obseiwed tem perature for all trials w as 26.4°C (Figure 4.1). T em peratures did not fall out o f this range for any o f the trials. T h e tem perature o f the batch reactors fluctuated w ith the

40°C (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). N itrifiers, and thus nitrification, are very sensitive to tem perature. N itrifying bacteria are particularly sensitive to low tem perature (below 5°C ), w hich leads to decreased grow th and nitrification rates. Since batch tem peratures did not fall b elo w 23.6°C and did not rise above 26.4°C , tem perature w as not likely a lim iting factor for m icrobial activity and nitrification. In the reference, the cyclohexim ide, the E D T A , and the E D T A + cyclohexim ide trials the pH dropped from pH values com m only found in activated sludge system s (betw een pH 6.5 and pH 8.5), to acidic pH values by day 14. Since no volum e replacem ent liquid was u sed in the batch reactors, a drop in pH as nitrification occurs is expected. F o r every m illigram (m g) o f nitrogen nitrified, 7.2 m g o f alkalinity is consum ed (B lackall and B urrell, 1999). The drop in pH is especially pronounced in w a te r w ith high inputs o f am m onium , such as w astew ater, w here higher rates o f am m onia oxidation occur and the pH is low ered m ore rapidly (Princic et ah, 1998). U p to and including day 10, the pH o f the batch reactors h ad not dropped below a pH o f 6.5 (Figure 4.2). H ow ever, from day 10 to day 14, a m ore rapid drop in pH w as observed. Several studies have show n that nitrification is severely retarded in low pH environm ents, and nitrification does not occur at all below a pH o f 6.5 (B lackall and B urrell, 1998; Princic e t ah, 1998; V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). T he pH range fo r grow th o f pure cultures o f am m onia oxidizers is 5.8 to 8.5, and the pH range for the grow th o f nitrite oxidizers is 6.5 to 8.5 (P rincic et ah, 1998). T hus, after day 10 in the reference, cyclohexim ide, and allylthiourea trials it can be postulated that nitrification w as not occurring at norm al rates, since the nitrite oxidation step w ould be com pletely inhibited during this tim e. after day
10

T he rapid drop in pH

can be attributed to other decom position processes, and also to the possible

Interestingly, in the allylthiourea trials the pH actually increased th roughout the trial, from a pH o f 7.49 on day 1 to a pH o f 8.87 and 8.60 in the allylthiourea and allylthiourea + cyclohexim ide trials, respectively (Figure 4.2). Since allylthiourea is an inhibitor o f am m onia oxidation, its presence likely resulted in the build-up o f am m onia in the system . W lien am m onia dissolves in w ater, a portion reacts w ith the w ater to form am m onium ions (NH 4 ^) w ith the b alance rem aining as un-ionized am m onia (N H 3 ). T he presence o f N H / contributes to the alkalinity o f the w ater, w hich explains w hy no drop in pH was observed in the reactors treated w ith allylthiourea. In addition to the direct effect on pH through nitrogen build-up, the presence o f allylthiourea inhibits am m onia oxidation, and h ence the entire nitrification process. Thus, the associated build-up o f acidity associated w ith the nitrification process did not occur in the allylthiourea trials, and the pH did not drop as in the reactors n o t treated w ith allylthiourea. T he pH in the allylthiourea trials never rose above a pH o f 10, w hich is the threshold value for com plete inhibition on nitrification (P rincic e t al., 1998; B lackall and B urrell, 1999). D issolved oxygen w as m on ito red throughout the reference, cyclohexim ide, ED TA , and ED T A 4- cyclohexim ide trials (Figure 4.3).

and rem ained at this level for the rem ainder o f the trial. N itrification is largely dependant on the oxygen available to nitrifying bacteria. It is im portant to note that the dissolved oxygen levels m easured in m ixed liquor (as m easured in this study) are not necessarily the dissolved oxygen levels available to nitrifying bacteria w ithin biological floes. D issolved oxygen levels directly available to nitrifiers below 0.3 m g O 2 /L are know n to inhibit nitrification, w h ile at 1.0 m g 0 2 /L the nitrification rate is 90% o f that observed in cells directly suspended in oxygen saturated w ater (B lackall and B urrell, 1999). D issolved oxygen contents in m ixed-liquor below 2 m g O 2 /L are know n to inhibit nitrification apparently because at below a m ixed liquor dissolved oxygen o f

5.2.2 The Monitoring o f COD, Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, and Total Nitrogen to Assess the Effect o f Protozoan Grazing on Bacterially Mediated Nitrogen Cycling
One o f the prim ary aim s o f this study w as to determ ine if the p resen ce or absence o f protozoan grazin g affected nitrification under different conditions. M onitoring NH3 and consum ption rates o r N O 2 ' and NO3' production rates in activated sludge is one o f the m ost p opular w ays to m easure the nitrification activity o f activated sludge sam ples (G eraaey et ah, 1998). In this study, regular sam pling and chem ical analyses o f the sam ples for am m onia, nitrite, nitrate, and total nitrogen w as p erform ed in order to attem pt to m easure nitrificatio n activity. C O D was also m onitored in ord er to ensure that the organic m aterial in the b a tc h reactors w as not com pletely depleted throughout the trial. C hem ical oxygen dem and is the am ount o f oxygen necessary to oxidize all o f the organic carbon com pletely to C O 2 and H 2 O. N orm ally, the ratio o f CO D to BO D (biological oxgyen dem and) is approxim ately 0.5. For w astew aters com posed m ainly o f biodegradeable organic substances, the CO D concentration approxim ates the ultim ate carbonaceous B O D value, w hich is the plateau reached by the carbonaceous B O D due to depletion o f the carb o n source (M aier et ah, 1999). In essence, the C O D is a m easure o f the organic content o f the w astew ater. Typical CO D values vary w ith the type o f w astew ater b e in g pro cessed and the seasonal or diurnal variation in w astew ater com position. D ata collected during 2004 from the B urlington W ater P urification Plant show s that influent C O D concentrations over a five m onth p eriod from Jam ;ary to M ay fluctuated from as low as
100

m g 0 2 /L to as high as 600 m g 0 2 /L w ith an average o f

approxim ately 250 m g O 2 /L. E ffluent CO D for the sam e treatm en t plant during the sam e period flu ctu ated b e tw e en a m axim um o f 38 m gOz/L and a m inim um o f 15 m g O 2/L, w ith an average value o f approxim ately 25 m g O 2 /L. In this study, the sew age sam ple cam e from the activated sludge aeration tan k at the A shbridges B ay W W T P. T hus, CO D values are expected to be low er than typical influent C O D concentrations. C O D v/as m easured on d ay 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 in all trials (Figure 4.4). A s organic m atter in the activated sludge is oxidized, a decrease in C O D is expected, and in fact th is w as the case

in the reference trial w h ere the C O D decreased from 120 m g/L on day 1 to 60 m g/L on day 10. T his w as also th e case in both the allylthiourea and ally lth io u rea + cyclohexim ide w here the CO D decreased as expected over the 10-day period. In the cyclohexim ide trial, the C O D w as observed to increase over the 10-day period. T he sam e phenom enon w as o b served in b o th the E D T A and the E D T A + cyclohexim ide trials. In the ED TA trial, C O D increased only very slightly from 165 m g O 2 /L on day 1 to 196 m g O 2/L on day 10. H o w ev er in the E D T A + cyclohexim ide trial, the largest increase in C O D was observed (fro m 165 m g/L on day 1 to 290 m g/L on day 10). A n increase in the CO D value in the E D T A trials can be explained b y the d eflocculating properties o f ED TA . E D T A is a stro n g chelating agent that deflocculates activated sludge by breaking the salt bridges linking floes in concentrations greater than 100 m g/L (L iao et ah, 2002). Since the m easu rem en t o f CO D is a colourim etric m ethod, activated sludge sam ples are filtered prior to sam ple digestion. T hus, a portion o f organic m aterial contained in floes is rem oved in the filterin g procedure. W lien E D T A is added to sludge sam ples, floe structure is disrupted, and organic nutrients contained w ithin the floe structure are released to the surro u n d in g environm ent. T hus, the concentration o f organic m atter available fo r biological degradation increases. It appears that the addition o f cyclohexim ide also affected the C O D values. In all trials containing cyclohexim ide, C O D values sharply increased on day 4, follow ed by a subsequent decrease by day 7. C yclohexim ide is a w ell know n and w idely used inhibitor o f p ro to zo an m etabolic activity at concentrations o f 100 m g/L (T rem aine and M ills, 1987; K o ta et al., 1999; D eLorenzo et al., 2001). C yclohexim ide could potentially increase the C O D in tw o w ays. T he addition o f cyclohexim ide inhibits protozoan m etabolism and p ro to zo a cease to feed, and eventually die. T he b u ild-up o f dead protozoan cells and their eventual decay could potentially increase the chem ical oxygen dem and o f the reactors. A n o th er w ay that cyclohexim ide could increase the CO D is by directly contributing to it since cyclohexim ide is an organic com pound. H ow ever, this is u nlikely since cyclohexim ide has been observed to be stable in aquatic environm ents for up to 30-days (D eL orenzo et ah, 2001), and thus is p resu m ab ly not readily biodegradable. A n increase in C O D in the absence o f pro to zo an grazin g w as also observed by C urd et al. (1968).

T h e p u rp o se o f m easuring p aram eter con cen tratio n s w as to calculate th e rates o f p ro d u ctio n for each o f these over the 10-day p e rio d for each trial (Figure 4.9-4.12). A m m onia co n cen tratio n s in influent w astew ater also v ary seasonally and d iu m ally , but the typical influent (untreated) am m onia concentration in m unicipal w a stew a te r is upw ards o f 25 m g/L (V iessm an and H am m er, 1998). In the referen ce trial, the rate o f am m onia p roduction w a s positive, indicating a net production o f am m o n ia th roughout the 10-day period. The process o f nitrification converts am m onia to nitrate, so in a nitrifying system one w ould ex p ect the rate o f am m onia production to b e n egative (i.e. a consum ption o f am m onia). H ow ever, the rate o f am m onia p ro d u ctio n o b served in the reference trial w as o n ly v ery slightly p o sitive (0.44 m g N H a/L /day). A lso it m ust be rem em bered th at other processes besides nitrification are o ccurring in th e system . O ne m ajor process that increases the am m onia concentration in biological system s is am m onification, the d ecom position o f organic n itrogen com pounds to am m onia perform ed b y m any m icrooorganism s in activated sludge (M adigan e t al., 2000). Thus, even in system s w here nitrificatio n is occurring, a p o sitiv e am m onia p ro d u ctio n rate m ay often be observed. In the cyclohexim ide trial w here protozoan grazin g w as inhibited, the rate o f am m onia p ro d u ctio n w as still positive (0.26 m g N H g/L /day), b u t w as sm aller than in the reference trial, indicating th at less am m onia w as being p ro d u ced , alth o u g h the difference w as not statistically significant. T he production o f less am m o n ia in the absence o f protozoan grazing can be expected since in the absence o f pro to zo an grazing fast-grow ing h eterotrophic b acteria proliferate (C urds, 1982; V erh ag en and L aanbroek, 1991; V erhagen and L aanbroek, 1992; Petropoulos, 2003). T h e se fast-grow ing h eterotrophic b acteria o u tcom pete nitrifying bacteria fo r am m onia (H an ak i et ah, 1990), and nitrification decreases. T he assim ilation o f am m onia by h etero tro p h s has b een observed to o c c u r in p reference to nitrification w hen am m o n ia is ab u n d an t and heterotrophic p o p u latio n densities are high (H anaki et al., 1990). W lrether the overall abundance o f n itrify in g b acteria decrease o r the per-cell nitrificatio n rate d ecreases is still n ot clear.

A lly lth io u rea op erates to h a lt the oxidation o f am m o n ia to n itrite by chelating th e copper o f the a m m o n ia m o n o o x y g en ase (A M O ) active site (G in estet e t ah, 1998). A M O is the enzym e th a t c a taly zes the conversion o f a m m o n ia to n itrite, and once it is ren d ered in activ e this c o n v ersio n does not occur at all. T h u s, in the trials co n tain in g ally lthiourea, no a m m o n ia o x id atio n w as occurring, and this resu lte d in a su b seq u en t bu ild -u p o f a m m o n ia in th e system .

This suggests th at less nitrificatio n w as occurring in these trials, an d c o n cu rs w ith the theory th at the p rese n c e o f p ro to zo an grazing enhances n itrific a tio n (C larh o lm , 1985; V erhagen and L aan b ro ek , 1992; Strauss and D odds, 1997; P e tro p o u lo u s, 2003). T he rate o f n itrite p ro d u ctio n in th e ally lth io u rea and allylthiourea + c y clo h ex im id e trials w ere negative (-0.06 and - 0 .0 7 m g NOz'/L respectively), and sig n ifican tly d ifferen t from the nitrite p ro d u ctio n rate in th e reference.

T h e fact th a t p roduction rates for nitrite a n d nitrate w ere neg ativ e m ay

T he reference trial h a d the low est day 14 bacterial cell abundance, w hile the cyclo h ex im id e trial h a d th e h ig h est.

T h is large am ount o f variab ility b rin g s into question the reliability o f the cell count m ethod as applied to flo ccu lated activated sludge sam ples. T h e m ain problem lies in the fac t that m o st b acteria in activated sludge system s are flocculated. B acteria w ith in floes can n o t be accurately counted using standard m icroscopic tech n iq u es. E ven in the E D T A trial, w h ere d eflocculation occurred, a large proportion o f b a c te ria w as still o b se rv e d to be in floes.

nitrifying bacteria as determ ined b y fluorescent In situ hybridization using rR N A -targeted oligonucleotide probes com bined w ith confocal scanning laser m icroscopy. In order to m eet this objective, six different probes w ere used in order detect A O B , N O B, and eubacteria. For each floe exam ined, the relative position w ithin the floe o f fluorescently labelled b acteria w as determ ined, as well as the relative abundance o f the bacteria on a four point scale. T he relative position and abundance o f each type o f bacteria was then com pared betw een the trials. The average floe size and the average floe diam eter w ere also com pared b e tw e m trials. A total o f four probe com binations w ere used in this study. E ach com bination consisted o f two probes sim ultaneously hybridized to the sam ple. T he purpose o f com bining probes is two-fold. Firstly, it cuts dow n on the num ber o f slides that m u st be m ade and sam ple preparation tim e. Secondly, com bining probes allows observations to be m ade about the position o f different types o f bacteria relative to one another. Figure 4.14 represents the average floe size and floe depth o f the floes exam ined in each trial. Floe size was m easured as the length o f the floe at the w idest point. W hen floe size w as com pared am ong trials, the only statistically significant difference w as found betw een the reference and the E D T A + cyclohexim ide. The floe size in the E D T A cyclohexim ide trial w as significantly sm aller than that o f the reference trial. T his could be explained by the com bined effect o f deflocculation by the E D T A and the lack o f protozoan grazing. P rotozoan grazing has been know n to increase the flocculation o f bacteria by grazing on free-floating species, and also by the excretion o f com pounds that prom ote flocculation (C urds, 1982; R atsak et al., 1996). Floe depth w as significantly sm aller in the allylthiourea, the allylthiourea cyclohexim ide, the E D T A , and the ED T A + cylohexim ide trials as com pared to the reference trial. T here w as no significant difference in floe depth betw een the reference and cyclohexim ide trials. As w as the case w ith floe size, the floe depth in the E D T A + cyclohexim ide trial w as significantly sm aller than in the E D T A trial. A gain, this could be due to the com bination o f deflocculation by ED TA and a lack o f grazing by protozoa. T he sm aller floe size in trials containing the deflocculating agent E D T A is expected, but the sm aller floe size in the allylthiourea trials was not. T he presence o f sm aller floes in

the trials containing allylthiourea suggests that allylthiourea m ay also h av e som e deflocculating characteristics, /^mother possibility is that the build-up o f am m onia in these trials caused som e am ount o f deflocculation due to cell death (Singh et ah, 1994). An increase in pH in the allylthiourea trials w as not likely to cause deflocculation as floes dissociation constants have been found to be stable w ithin the range o f 4.5 to 9.5 (Liao et al., 2002). It is im portant to note that floe size and floe depth are som ew hat arbitrary designations, and entirely dependant on the position o f the floe on the slide and in the plane o f the m icroscope laser. It is also im portant to note that during sam ple preparation, and due to the use o f a coverslip, floes m ay becom e com pressed. This has the effect o f m aking the floe size as it is m easured greater, and the floe depth as it is m easured sm aller. Thus, w hen m aking generalizations about floe size and depth som e caution m ust be exercised. The relative position w ithin the floe o f each type o f bacteria exam ined in this study was obtained in each floe by locating the depth w ithin each floe w here the m axim um am ount o f bacteria occurred and d ividing this depth by the total floe depth. From these values, w as possible to com pare the relative positions o f each type o f bacteria w ithin the floes on day 1, day 7, and day 14. T his is represented by Figure 4.15, 4.16, and 4.17. T hrough visual obser\'ation o f the floes, no obvious detectable difference in the bacterial position w ithin the floe w as observed betw een the trials. A lso, there w as no obvious detectable difference in the bacterial position w ithin the floe betw een day 1, 7, and 14 o f each trial. P robe HUB 338 detects m ost eubacteria. W lren used in com bination w ith probes for A O B and N O B , it show s the position o f AO B and N O B com pared to other bacteria that are not A O B and N O B . P robe EU B w as found at all levels o f the activated sludge floe, indicating that bacteria are found at all levels w ithin the activated sludge floe. H ow ever, the greatest am ount o f EU B 338 binding did occur in the center o f the floe, indicating that in activated sludge a large num ber o f bacteria are located w ithin the activated sludge floe w here they are protected from predation and m ake use o f m icroenvironm ents and nutrient pockets (D roppo, 2001). This finding correlates w ith the findings o f various

earlier studies that used F IS H com bined w ith C SLM to determ ine the p o sition o f bacteria in activated sludge floes (W agner et ah, 1994; W agner et ah, 1994(b); Schm id et al. 2003). T he A O B o f the p subclass Proteobacteria, Nitrosom onas species, and

Nitrosococcus mobilis w ere also found to be located in the m iddle o f the activated sludge
floe, and closely associated w ith each other in clusters. A O B w ere found at m ultiple depths w ithin the floe, b ut the m ajority o f binding w as alw ays found to occur m id-floe. This finding also is supported by the findings o f W agner et al. (1996; 1998) and by M obarry et al., (1996) w ho also found AO B located in the interior o f floes, in closely associated clusters. T he N O B N itrospira-\\kt group o f bacteria was also found in clusters distributed throughout the floe, w ith the m ajority located m id-floc. Nitrobacter was found to be closely associated w ith the Nitrospira-Xùiç, bacteria, but w as usually located closer to the outside o f the floe. Nitrosospira species w ere also found positioned m idfloc, but like N itrobacter this species was usually located closer to the outside o f the floe than the Nitrospira-Yike bacteria. U nlike Nitrospira-Vike. bacteria, N itrobacter and

Nitrosospira w ere usually only found at a single floe depth and w ere n ot distributed
throughout the floe. T he position o f NO B m id-floc is also supported by earlier findings by M obarry et al., (1996), W agner et al., (1996) and D aim s et al., (2002a). T he presence or absence o f protozoan grazing did not appear to affect the position o f nitrifying bacteria within the floe, since both A O B and NO B w ere found in the centre o f the floe in all trials. Surprisingly, in the E D T A trials, floes w ere still found to be intact, although the depth o f floes w ere sm aller than in the reference trial. T he position o f n itrifying b acteria w as not altered by deflocculation. Perhaps o f m ore interest than the position o f nitrifying bacteria w as th e abundance o f nitrifying bacteria w ithin the floe. W e w ere interested in determ ining w h ether or not the presence or absence o f protozoa had an effect on the am ount o f nitrifying b acteria w ithin the floe. W e also w anted to determ ine if, w hen nitrification w as h alted through the use o f allylthiourea, w hether the abundance o f nitrifying bacteria detected by FISH /C S L M decreased. T h e use o f the probe BUB 338 that detects m ost bacteria w as used in hope that an increase in heterotrophic bacteria w ould be detected using this probe. The quantification o f bacterial abundance on a four point scale for each trial on each day is show n in Figure 4.19, 4.20, and 4.21. Probe EU B 338 w as the m o st abundant probe in all trials on all days. T his is to be expected since EUB 338 binds to m ost bacteria, and as such should bind to all nitrifying bacteria and all other bacteria p resen t in the activated sludge floe. T h e am ount o f EU B 338 probe binding w as highly variable, a n d m ore

bacteria appeared to b e present in the trials containing allylthiourea and the trials containing E D T A than in the reference and cyclohexim ide trials. H ow ever, since the am ount o f E U B b inding w as so variable betw een floe sam ples, the presence o f m ore bacteria in these trials cannot be stated w ith any certainty. F o r the am m onia oxidizing bacteria, both betaproteobacterial am m onia oxidizers and Nitrosom onas and

Nitrosococcus mobilis w ere present in m oderate am ounts, w ith N itrosom onas and Nitrosococcus mobilis slightly m ore abundant. This finding is in accordance w ith other
studies that found th at N itrosom onas europaea, Nitrosomonas eutropha, Nitrosococcus

mobilis, and m em bers o f the N itrosom onas marina cluster are the m ost abundant
am m onia oxidizers in activated sludge (W agner and Loy, 2002). For the N O B ,

Nitrospira-like b acteria w ere present in the greatest abundance. N itrobacter and Nitrosospira w ere also present in sm all am ounts, w ith Nitrosospira b ein g the least
abundant. T his is n o t surprising, since recent research determ ined that Nitrospira-\\k.e. bacteria are the dom inate nitrite oxidizers in W W TPs (B urrell et al., 1998; Juretschko et al., 1998; O kabe et al., 1999; D aim s et al., 2000; D aim s et a l , 2001(a); G ieseke et al., 2001). The reason for this is th at Nitrospira-like bacteria are K -strategists w ith high substrate affinities and low m axim um grow th rates and thus outcom pete Nitrobacter under substrate-lim iting conditions in W W TPs (W agner and L oy, 2002). T he use o f F IS H com bined w ith C SLM did not reveal a noticeable difference in either the position or abundance o f nitrifying bacteria w ithin the sludge floes under the different conditions exam ined. W lten protozoan activity w as inhibited, and increased grow th o f heterotropic bacteria w as thought to increase, no subsequent increase in the abundance o f probe EUB 338 w as observed. In the presence o f protozoan grazing, w here increased nitrification w as tho u g h t to occur as indicated by param eter m easurem ents, no increase in the abundance o f A O B o r N O B was observed w ith F ISH /C S L M . W lren am m onia oxidation w as inhibited using allylthiourea, again, no noticeable change in the abundance o f AO B or N O B w as observed. T his suggests that an increase in nitrification does not necessarily m ean an increase in the abundance o f nitrifying bacteria. R ather, an increase in nitrification m ight denote an increase in the per-cell nitrification rate. T here are several im portant lim itations associated w ith the use o f F IS H com bined w ith CSLM . O ne lim itation is the difficulty in quantifying cell num bers u sin g the

O ther lim itations are m ethodological lim itations, such as the occurrence o f non-sp ecific b inding o f probes that m ay distort abundance estim ates. It also should b e noted th at probe EU B 338 detects m ost bacteria, but in ord er to detect all bacteria should be used in conjunction w ith two new ly developed probes: EUB 333II

[Planctomycetales spp.) and EU B 338 III {Verrucom icwbiales spp.) (Loy et al., 2003).
This om ission could account for the failure to observe an increase in bacterial abundance in the trials lacking protozoan grazing. The use o f F IS H /C S L M is an excellent starting point in obseivdng the general position and relative am ounts o f nitrifying bacteria w ithin activated sludge floe.

5.4 The Relevance of the Influence of Protozoan Grazing on Nutrient Cycling in the Activated Sludge Process
T his study h as established that in the presence o f protozoan grazing, nitrification rates increase. This finding is supported by several other studies that also found enhanced nitrogen cycling in the presence o f protozoan grazing in the activated sludge and other environm ents (C larholm , 1984; V erhagen and L aanbroek, 1992; Strauss and D odds, 1997; Petropoulos, 2003). W hat is still not clear is the exact m echanism b y w hich protozoa affect nitrification. T he possible interaction betw een protozoa can be sum m arized in tw o m ain ideas: the grazing effect, and the cycling effect. T he grazing effect entails the theory that protozoa m ay affect nitrification by controlling populations o f heterotrophic bacteria w hich norm ally com pete w ith n itrifying bacteria for am m onia. It has been show n that the assim ilation o f am m onia by heterotrophs happens in preference to n itrification and in fact reduces the available am m onia for nitrification (H anaki et ah, 1990). T hus, it follow s that w hen heterotrophic bacterial num bers are controlled b y pro to zo an grazing, that m ore am m onia w ill be available for nitrifying bacteria, and nitrificatio n w ill increase. Several studies have show n th at the presence o f protozoan grazing in fact selects for fast grow ing heterotrophic b acteria and that slow grow ing nitrifying b acteria are elim inated (S herr et ah, 1988; Sinclair and A lexander, , · 1989). It is essential to note, how ever, that these studies did n o t involve bacterial populations that are h ig h ly flocculated, such as those present in activated sludge. In

activated sludge, the results o f m any studies, including the p resen t study, have indicated th at nitrifying b acteria are located w ithin the interior o f activated sludge floes (W agner et ah, 1995; M ob arry et ah, 1996; W agner et ah, 1996; W ag n er et ah, 1998; D aim s et ah, 2001(a)). H etero tro p h ic bacteria are located in all areas o f the floe (W agner et ah, 1995).

A s such, n itrify in g b acteria are not available to protozoa for predation u n d er norm al circum stances. T hus, the theory that protozoan grazing reduces num bers o f slow grow ing n itrify in g b acteria is n o t applicable in activated sludge system s. H eterotrophic bacteria in activated sludge are also located in floe, and those that are n o t in floes are consum ed by protozoa, hence the basis o f a self-regulating activated sludge system that selects for flocculating bacteria. In the absence o f protozoan activity, bacterial populations are not controlled, and fast-grow ing heterotrophic bacteria proliferate, subsequently outcom peting the nitrifying bacteria for am m onia. T he n et result o f this is a decrease in n itrification in the absence o f protozoa due to the pro liferatio n o f heterotrophic bacteria. T he cycling theory o f th e effect o f protozoa on nutrient cycling follow s that protozoan grazing results in the excretion o f m ineral nutrients such as am m onia and phosphate, decreasing th e C :N :P ratio and this results in an accelerated use o f carbon resources by bacteria (enhanced carbon m ineralization). A study by Sherr et al. (1998) found th at in aquatic environm ents protozoa that consum e living cells have the h ighest biom ass specific excretion rates o f inorganic nitrogen o f all zooplankton groups. Protozoan grazing changes the C :N :P ratio by increasing the concentrations o f m ineral nitrogen (excreted b y protozoa as am m onia) and phosphorous (excreted by protozoa as phosphate). T he excretion o f am m onia b y protozoa provides m ore am m onia for oxidation by n itrifying bacteria, and also for assim ilation by heterotrophs. O ne problem w ith the cy clin g theory applied to m unicipal activated sludge is that in such a system am m onia is often in abundant supply and is rarely lim iting. T hus, the protozoan excretion o f am m onia m ay have little affect on enhancing nitrification since it is probably already occurring at a high rate. H ow ever, it is possible that the influence o f protozoan grazing on the C :N :P ratio is som ew hat under-estim ated b ecau se the com position o f w astew ater (i.e in fluent nitro g en and carbon loadings) is h ig h ly variable (R atsak et ah, 1996). F o r exam ple, the N -concentration m ay be low ered b y p rocesses such as

Furtherm ore, som e types o f w astew ater (such as pulp and paper) contain m uch h ig h er levels o f carbon in w hich case n itrogen m ay becom e lim iting (R atsak et ah, 1996). In reality, the exact m echanism b y w hich protozoa effect nitrificatio n is probably a com bination o f b acterial pop u latio n control by grazing and enhanced nutrien t cycling. D ue to the com plex nature o f the activated sludge ecosystem , interactions are still poorly understood. H ow ever, there are several new techniques, such as the isotope array approach, th a t m ay give insights into interspecies m etabolic interactions and even food w ebs.

5.5 Future Work and Recommendations
T his study has established that w h ile the presence o f protozoa increases n itrification, it does not appear to affect the am ount or position o f nitrifying b acteria w ithin the floe as determ ined by FISH com bined w ith C SLM . T his w ould suggest that that protozoan grazing does not prom ote the grow th o f m ore nitrifying bacteria, b u t does increase the per-cell nitrification rates. T his finding is supported by earlier studies by C larholm (1985), V erhagen and L aanbroek (1992), and Strauss and D odds (1997), all o f w hich determ ined th a t protozoan grazing increases nitrification rates in soil environm ents. As m entioned above, there are several key lim itations associated w ith the F ISH /C S L M technique w hen it is u sed to exam ine nitrification activity in th e activated sludge floe. O ne lim itation is th at the use o f F ISH /C S L M is not an ideal m ethod to quantify bacteria,
i

and to do so requires expensive and difficult to obtain specialized softw are. A nother lim itation this that rR N A is h ighly stable, and the use o f F IS H /C S L M does not allow one to differentiate betw een active and inactive cells. E ven i f n itrifying bacteria are not viable, cells w ill still fluoresce w hen exam ined using F IS H /C S L M .

m ethod u sed by D aim s et al. (2001(c)) requires a specific type o f softw are th at w as not available fo r use in th is study. H ow ever, the acquisition o f such softw are for quantification o f ab so lu te b acterial cell num bers in future studies w o u ld b e beneficial. T here are several techniques av ailable to determ ine the m etabolic activ ity o f hacterial cells. O ne such tech n iq u e is th e use o f m icroautoradiography (M A R ) co m b in ed w ith FISH . M icro au to rad io g rap h y is a m eth o d that can be u sed to study th e m icroscale distribution or rad io lab elled com pounds (N ielsen et al., 1999). M A R co m b in ed w ith FIS H can be used to study the in situ physiology o f m any m icroorganism s. T h e ir ability to take up specific organic o r inorganic com pounds or their ab ility to be active under aerobic, anoxic, or an aerobic conditions can also b e investigated (N ielsen et al., 1999). M A R also allow s for the en u m eratio n o f certain functional groups o f m icroorganism s that m ay be responsible fo r a certain process (i.e. nitrification) in a com plex m icrobial system such as activated sludge.

S ince the am o u n t o f A O B and N O B w ere n o t a ffected by our m anipulations, it suggests th at the A O B and N O B are m ore active in the p rese n c e o f p ro to zo a (i.e. p er cell nitrification increases).
