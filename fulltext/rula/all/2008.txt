Abstract
Portfolio efficiency and suitability are two important goals in the asset allocation process involving a financial advisor and clients. In this project report, a multiple objective asset allocation method which is intended to obtain a suitable portfolio for a specific individual investor is proposed. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique is employed as a framework to address an investor's muitipie investment objectives. Single-objective portfolio optimization techniques are integrated into the decision hierarchy. To determine a single-objective optimal portfolio, a method is proposed to measure an investor' s risk tolerance. An interactive procedure based on the proposed asset allocation method is presented to implement the allocation process. Comparisons with a single-objective optimization method using a hypothetical example show that improved portfolio efficiency in terms of all objectives can be achieved. Questionnaires, GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) programs and spreadsheet models are developed to facilitate the communications between the financial advisor and investor.

Chapter 1; Introduction
Almost every one in the world owns a combination of assets. It can be composed of real assets, such as a house, a car, or furniture, and financial assets, such as cash, stocks, or bonds. Real assets are mostly for personal use in everyday life. There is not much room left to be managed to generate income unless one sells them. Financial assets are resources that can be organized to provide potential future growth and income. Asset allocation is an investment decision process about how to allocate available capital among different types of financial assets. A combination of these assets is called a portfolio. For many individual investors, however, the process of constructing a portfolio can be time-consuming and may be a tough task because of limited knowledge and experience. Financial markets are full of uncertdnty. No one can predict what will exactly happen in the future. Investors worry about making wrong decisions. And when investors seek advice firom a financial professional, they worry that the advisor may make wrong decisions for them. In order to make a good investment recommendation, the financial advisor should consider multiple dimensions of an investor's objectives and preferences. Optimization techniques have traditionally been used in asset allocation process. However, an efficient portfolio determined by an optimization model is not necessarily also suitable for a particular investor, partly because the judgment of a portfolio's suitability is largely subjective (Bolster, et al., 1995), and partly because traditional optimization is in practice constructed as a single-objective decision problem. Multiple-objective decision making methods, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) developed by Saaty (1980), are suitable to deal with complex situations where multiple objectives should be considered. However, a suitable portfolio obtained by the AHP normally is not optimal (Bolster and Warrick, 2000). By integrating the AHP with traditional optimization techniques, it is hoped that a suitable portfolio with improved overall effidency can be obtained. A major objective of this project report is to present such a multiple objective asset allocation model for individual investors. When using the mean-variance optimization technique to determine a portfolio, an investor's risk tolerance is a key input factor. A theoretically sound and workable measure for an investor's risk tolerance is also presented in this report. To develop a multiple objective asset allocation model, an understanding of asset allocation 1

process is needed. An introduction to this process, as well as portfolio's efiBciency and suitability, is given below. 1.1 Asset Allocation Process All decision problems have common elements: criteria of choice, alternatives and the preferred solution(s). The decision alternatives for asset allocation are numerous possible combinations of asset classes. For individual investors, they themselves, or the financial advisor help them, evaluate the alternatives according to their financial goals and considerations, and choose an asset combination that can achieve these goals. This process can be summarized as goal setting, asset class selection, and portfolio determination. 1.1.1 Investment Goals The key for a successful financial advisor is to know what his client needs. And the key for an investor is to know what himself needs. The old saying "knowing the destination is half the journey" indicates the important role of goal setting in asset allocation process. It determines an investor's asset allocation strategy. That is, asset allocation should be consistent with investors' investment goals. Many investors have a list of concrete goals, such as to buy a house, send children to universities, save enough money to retire early and comfortably, and so on. Some investors would like to defer their income tax to future years or utilize the favorable tax rates on different investment instruments. Some would like to preserve their capital firom potential losses. Some are concerned about tiie purchasing power of their money and would like to seek investments to hedge increased inflation. Many investors seek multiple investment objectives. Most of these goals can be translated into retum requirements fi-om investment portfolios. Investors' financial status, time horizons and stages in their life cycle affect the asset allocation decision. For example, liigh tax-bracket investors may seek investments that generate income firom capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than interest income. Different investor risk attitudes also direct the investment portfolio toward more conservative or more aggressive asset combinations.

1.1.2 Asset Classes If we define asset allocation as spreading investments across a variety of asset classes, a natural question is what asset classes are available for investors. Actually there are thousands of asset alternatives available in the financial markets. In broad terms, cash, bonds, stocks and real estate are four basic asset classes (see Maginn and Tuttle, 1990, p. 10-2, for the detailed discussions about treating real estate as an asset class in portfolio analysis). They can be subdivided into smaller classes according to certain classification methods. Stocks, for example, can be subdivided into large-cap and small-cap; value and growth; international and domestic; and/or combinations thereof. Bonds can be subdivided into governmental and corporate; short, intermer^iate, and long term; convertible and non-convertible; coupon and zero-coupon, etc. Each sub-class can be furtirer divided. Each asset class possesses some common properties that can distinguish it fi'om others. Asset classes provide various investment opportunities as well as different risk and retum characteristics. Cash and cash equivalents, such as bank accounts, term dq)Osits, treasury bills, money market mutual funds and other short-term instruments, typically provide interests and generally be considered conservative because of their low risk, high liquidity and abilities to preserve capital. Fixed-income assets, such as corporate bonds, provide potential higher income opportunities but have moderate risk because they are subject to potential default risk for reasons such as bankruptcy. Government bonds rarely have default risk but are still subject to long-term inflation risk and generally have lower interest rates tiian those of corporate bonds. Historically, stocks have been the best performing asset class among traditional investments (Information Please, 2003). They typically offer greater growth possibilities and good hedge to inflation in long-term. However, their prices fluctuate fi'equently, sometimes significantly and therefore have high risk of loss. Commercial real estate provides both lease income and potential capital appreciation, but is not firequently traded and has high liquidity risk. Rational investors prefer higher returns and dislike risk (Markowitz, 1952). However, the natural law of investments is that the higher the returns, the higher are the risks, and vice verse. Although controversial, Efticient Market Hypothesis (Fama, 1995) states that security prices fully reflect all available information of both historical and expected future events, and any efforts to pick up undervalued securities are like "random walk" in markets.

Asset allocation is neither intended to oulperform market nor a tool to `lauy low, sell high", but a strategy to protect potential losses and to provide "satisfied" retum by combining asset classes into a portfolio. 1.1.3 Diversification

Once asset classes are identified, investors should determine how much of each class should be included in the portfolio. That is, how much of funds should be invested in stocks, how much in bonds, and so on. The answer is crucial to long-term portfolio performance. An old adage tells us: "Don't put all the eggs in one basket". If one drops the basket that carries all eggs, one loses all. This saying is well suited to situations of investing. If an investor invests in a number of assets, he prevents himself from large losses linked to one or some poor decisions. Modem portfolio theory (MPT), developed first by Markowitz (1952), goes further than traditional random diversification. Analyses and attentions are not only given to the risks associated to each individual asset (asset class), but also provided to interrelationships among component assets within a portfolio. Diversification works because not all financial assets go up or down at the same time or at the same rate. When stock markets go up, bond markets may go down. While the high-tech sector falls sharply, the food sector may slide only slightly or remain the same. If investors hold assets that do not correlate with each other, the increase in one can offeet losses in another. MPT points out that a well-diversified portfolio will achieve higher returns without having to take more risk, or achieve given expected returns for minimal risk. This is the theoretical foundation of asset allocation.

1.1.4 Portfolio Determination In asset allocation process involving a financial advisor and clients, typically the advisor provides available market opportunities (Maginn and Tuttle, 1990, p. 7-12). These opportunities are combinations of several asset classes that are believed to be efficient or suitable based on capital market research results. A final portfolio for a given individual investor is determined by combining the available market opportunities with that investor's preferences, usually the most important one is the investor's risk tolerance (Magiim and

Tuttle, 1990, p. 7-27). Typically the value of the investor's risk tolerance is evaluated using a designed questionnaire. The responses to the questionnaire are scored. An asset allocation recommendation can be made using rules of thumb based on die accumulated score (Droms and Stauss, 2003), or the score can be transformed into a value of risk tolerance that can be incorporated into an optimization model to detamine an optimal asset mix (Bolster and Warrick, 2000). 1.2 Asset Allocation's Efficiency and Suitability Investors hope to be given a portfolio that is consistent with their financial status as well as investment goals and preferences. But they may be concerned about if the recommended portfolio is the "best" one available. There are two important considerations in asset allocation process: portfolio's suitability and efficiency. After the birth of Markowitz's mean-variance theory (Markowitz, 1952), traditional research of asset allocation focuses on two major areas: one bn the solution techniques of mean-variance optimization, die other on the différent definitions of portfolio risks. The studies in the first area lead to the developments of other important components of modem portfolio theory, including index model (Sharpe, 1963), Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Sharpe, 1964), and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) (Ross, 1976). The research in the second area leads to various alternative portfolio optimization methods, such as mean absolute deviation optimization (Konno and Yamazaki, 1991). Both areas of research pay attentions to the optimality of a portfolio and distinguish themselves based on what is the most appropriate measure of asset risk and portfolio risk From a viewpoint of decision making, all of these models generate objective judgments of alternatives. As long as the properties of component assets are known, the ouqjut portfolios are deterministic. They are optimal or efficient based on mean-variance sense or mean absolute deviation sense. The efficient portfolios derived from optimization models are not necessarily also suitable for a particular investor. In many portfolio optimization methods, one of the major investment objectives is often formulated as the objective function that needs to be optimized, while other objectives or considerations come into the optimization models as constraints. A portfolio obtained by this single-objective optimization method is efficient in terms of this objective, but not necessarily also optimal in terms of others. Because of the
5

various situations faced by different investors, it may be impossible to find a universally optimal portfolio (Saraoglu and Detzler, 2002). If multiple conflicting objectives coexist and one objective does not significantly dominate others, investors may not think the portfolio is suitable for them. Furthermore, the determinations of portfolio suitability are largely subjective, and financial advisors often have to rely on intuition and past experience to make judgments. Disgruntled investors may sue for damage or file complaints against financial advisors if they believe the recommended investments are not suitable for them (Bolster, et al., 1995). Professional associations, such as Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR, 2003), require their members consider the appropriateness and suitability of investment recommendations for clients. However, the research in the suitability of a portfolio appeared in financial literature only in recent years and was relative rare. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), developed by Saaty (1980), has been used by several researchers to formulate portfolio mix (Khaksari, et al., 1989), to determinate an investor's suitability (Bolster, et al., 1995) and to select mutual funds (Saraoglu and Detzler, 2002). AHP constructs the asset allocation decision problem as a hierarchy. Each objective in the hierarchy is prioritized and its relative importance is weighed. The performance of each asset is evaluated in terms of each objective or sub-objective. A portfolio can be formulated by combining the weighed asset classes. The purpose of using AHP in asset allocation is to ensure that investors' objectives and preferences are reasonably satisfied. Generally, however, the portfolio obtained is not optimal (Bolster and Warrick, 2000). 1.3 Organization of this Report This project report presents an asset allocation method which is intended to obtain a suitable portfolio for a specific individual investor. Improved overall portfolio efficiency can also be achieved. In this proposed method, the AHP is employed as a firamework to address an investor's multiple investment objectives. For each objective, an optimization model is used to determine a local optimal portfolio. Interactive communications between the financial advisor and the investor ensure that the asset allocation process effectively reflect the investor's preferences. This project report is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, the classical mean-variance
6

portfolio theory, alternative portfolio optimization methods and efiticient asset allocation, techniques are reviewed and their limitations are discussed. In Chapter 3, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is first introduced. A multiple^objective asset allocation model which integrates the AHP framework and portfolio optimization techniques is presented. A hypothetical investment problem is constructed to illustrate the application of the proposed model. In Chapter 4, a theoretical formulation of measuring an investor's risk tolerance is derived. An interactive process is designed to ascertain the measurement In Chapter 5, the process of constructing a complete portfolio is first reviewed. Then the complete portfolios constructed for the hypothetical investment problem are presented. A deviation index is designed to m esure the overall efficiency of the complete portfolios and used to compare tiie results with those obtained using a single-objective optinüzation method. In Chapter 6, a summary of the author's contributions is provided and some areas of future work are suggested. ·

Chapter 2: Portfolio Theory and Asset Allocation

Modem portfolio theory is the theoretical foundation, of eflBcient asset allocation. It suggests that diversifying a portfolio into different assets increases portfolio retum or decreases portfolio risk. Combining efficient market opportunities with an investor's preference, an optimal portfolio can be determined. In this chapter, the classical mean-variance portfolio theory is first introduced and alternative optimization methods are reviewed. The methods of detamining optimal portfolios are described. Limitations of single-objective optimization methods are discussed. 2.1 Mean-variance Portfolio Theory The first pioneering contribution to modem portfolio theory was the seminal work of Dr. Markowitz (1952), who received the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics (Royal Swedish Academy of Science, 1990). Before Markowitz, the investment management principle was to buy assets thought to be undervalued, and sell them later hopefolly for a profit Markowitz formulated the portfolio selection problem as to take the mean or expected rate of retum of a portfolio as the investment retum and the standard deviation (or variance) of retum of a portfolio as the investment risk. The mechanism of portfolio diversification was quantitatively analyzed. When assets are proparly mixed, investors could construct a portfolio that provides a higher overall retum without having to undertake more portfolio risk. Markowitz's mean-variance theory has since become the standard firamework in modem portfolio management (Michaud, 1998, p. 2). An efficient portfolio, according to Markotiwz, is defined as one that has the largest expected retum for a given level of risk, or the smallest portfolio risk for given level of expected retum The mathematical formulation of this problem is a quadratic programming model (denoted as Model 2.1): Model 2.1: Objective: N

where: E(Rp) = expected retum of portfolio; Op = standard deviation of retum of portfolio\ E(Rf) = expected retum for asset class /;
.

O i = standard deviation of retum of asset class /; Pij = correlation coefficient between returns of asset class i andy; N = the number of asset classes; and X f = proportion of portfolio invested in asset class /. Rational investors would seek efficient portfolios because these portfolios are optimized on both expected returns and risks, which are believed to be the most important considerations to investors. This can be illustrated in Figure 2.1. The circled area in Figure 2.1 is the opportunity set, which is the entire set of all attainable asset combinations. The efficient portfolios are found along the efficient frontier starting from point K to Q. The efficient frontier is a concave risk-retum trade-off curve in the expected retum-standard deviation space that extends from the minimum variance portfolio K to the maximum retum portfolio Q (Elton and Gmber, 1991, p. 53). Each portfolio in the efficient frontier, say, portfolio Q is optimal because the expected retum of portfolio G is greater than the expected retum of all other portfolios within the opportunity set with the same standard deviation, and its standard deviation is less than any other portfolios with the same level of expected return. Portfolio K is the global minimum variance portfolio because no other minimum-variance portfolio has a smaller risk. Portfolio Q is the maximum retum portfolio because no other efficient portfolio has a higher return.

In Markowitz's mean-variance model, analysis of portfolio risk not only includes the analysis of the risks associated with individual component assets, but also contains the analysis of the co-movements, or correlations, between the component assets within a portfolio. A positive correlation means their returns tend to change in the same direction, while a negative correlation indicates their returns tend to change in the opposite direction. A well-diversified portfolio would eliminate part of the total risk, the nonsystematic risk of a portfolio (Jones, 1998, p. 220). That is, the risk of a portfolio is commonly less than the risk of the any of the component assets, provided that they are not perfectly positively correlated. Thus rational investors diversify to reduce risk. Assets' expected returns, standard deviations, and the correlation coefficients can be obtained firom research results of security analyses. They are inputs in die Markowitz model. In strategic asset allocation, which always employs long-term capital market conditions, these inputs are considered constant (Sharpe, 1987). Weights of assets making up the portfolio are variables that can be manipulated to solve the quadratic programming problem to determine efficient portfolios. Variant optimization models have been proposed based on Markowitz's work. In particular, 10

in 1960s and 1970s, some simplified approximation methods were proposed in order to reduce computational difficulties related to the solution of a quadratic programming model (see Sharpe 1967,1971; Stone, 1973). Sharpe was the co-redpient of the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics for having developed the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, 1990). CAPM (Sharpe, 1964) was built on Markowitz portfolio theory. It treated market as a whole as optimal risky portfolio, and gave us the concept of the "beta" -- a coefficient designed to measure the risk of a particular stock relative to the performance of the market portfolio. 2.2 Alternatives to Mean-varlance Portfolio Theory Markotiwz's model was built on some assumptions. Two of those assumed that the expected returns of assets are normally distributed and an investor is rational, which means he prefers higher return of the portfolio and smaller standard deviation. Markotiwz's model is known to be valid if these underlying assumptions are satisfied (Konno and Yamazaki, 1991). However, these assumptions may not represent the more sophistical real situations. Some researchers commented that rational investors are not necessarily all risk aversive, and standard deviation (or variance) not necessarily the most appropriate measure of risk (see Cohen, et al., 1987, p. 135). Polsky (1998) stated that even though expected future volatility and correlation are good inputs, there is a limitation to using them as risk measures when taking portfolio options into considerations. Michaud (1998, p. 3) also argued that, the most important limitations of Markowitz's model were its instability and ambiguity. The optimized portfolio was extremely sensitive to input changes and tended to maximize input errors. Alternative models have been proposed. They include mean-absolute deviation optimization model (Konno and Yamazaki, 1991); mean semi-absolute deviation model (Speranza, 1996), and mean-semivariance model (Hamza and Janssen, 1998). In addition, researchers have proposed alternative portfolio theories that included more moments such as skewness (see Elton and Gruber, 1997). Shortfall risk, downside variance, value-at-risk, and relative risk are considered as alternative measures of risk (see Chriss and Fanelli, 1998). Other portfolio selection techniques include Monte Carlo simulation approaches (Magjnn and Tuttle, 1990, p. 7-46) and utility function evaluations (Maginn and Tuttle, 1990, p .7-49). `

Among these alternatives, linear programming methods have received increased attentions. For example, Konno and Yamazaki (1991) demonstrated that a linear programming model using mean absolute deviation risk function has computational advantage, among others, over classical Markowitz's model However, in practice, using linear programming to construct a precise portfolio structure may not be easy. It needs to formulate a variety of linear equality and inequality constraints to reflect the relationships between assets and to control portfolio risk. "From a theoretical point of view, only a MV (mean-variance) optimization framework can optimally use active forecast information" (see Michaud, 1998, p. 32). 2.3 Efficient Asset Allocation I

The process of portfolio construction in practice is separated into asset allocation and security selection (Bodie, et al, 1997, p. 259). Althou^ the Markowitz model was initially developed for security selection, it has found successful applications in implementing asset allocation strategies. Both of efficient asset allocation and security selection require the formulation of efficient frontier and the determination of an optimal portfolio along the frontier. Security selection generally involves the allocation of hundreds, even thousands, of securities, while asset allocation involves normally 2-20 asset classes. However, studies show that more than 80% of long-term portfolio performance come from choosing the right combination of assets, not from choosing the right assets (RBC Investments, 2003). All the portfolios in the efficient frontier are optimal in the mean-variance context To determine the optimal portfolio for a specific investor, the investor's preferences and the relevant constraints should be combined with the market opportunities. If a risk-free asset is available to an investor, then the determination of the optimal complete portfolio is illustrated in Figure 2.2. The optimal capital allocation line (CAL) is a capital allocation line starting from Rf (the return of the risk-free asset) in vertical axis and tangent with the curve of optimal opportunity set (efficient frontier). It has the highest reward-to-variability ratio (Bodie, et al., 1997, p. 246). The point of tangency between thé efficient frontier and optimal CAL is the optimal risky portfolio, that is, P in Figure 2.2. An optimal risky portfolio is composed of risky assets only. A complete portfolio is obtained by allocating capitals between the risk-free asset and optimal risky portfolio. The point of tangency between the investor's indifference curve and the optimal CAL is the optimal complete

portfolio j that is, T in Figure 2.2. It provides highest utility to the given investor.

Actually, the risk-free asset does not exist in real world. The treasury-bills, commonly to be viewed as the risk-free asset, are subject to interest rate risk. If a risk-free asset is not available, as the data used for hypothetical investment example in this project report, the asset allocation decision is to find the optimal risky portfolio that provides the highest utility to the given investor. This is illustrated in Figure 2.3, where the optimal complete portfolio, T, is the point of tangency between the investor's indifference curve and the efficient frontier. An investor's utility function is usually unknown. However, if we assume that an investor's utility function can be represented by a particular type of smooth cifrve, and the investor has constant risk tolerance, then a reasonable utility function can be derived (Sharpe, 1987). Here an investor's risk tolerance is defined as the added variance for per unit of added expected return, providing the same utility for the investor (Maginn and Tuttle, 1990, p. 7-9). In this utility function, a risk aversive investor considers the risk as a penalty to the utility value. The greater the volatility of a portfolio, or the smaller the risk tolerance, the greater is the penalty. A general formulation of this optimization problem is a quadratic programming model (denoted as Model 2.2). Model 2.2: Objective:

Optimization models using quadratic programming techniques were widely used for implementing efiBcient. asset allocation. Unlike most other approaches, one advantage of these models is that they can effectively reflect and utilize the fact that risk depends on interactions among assete (Maginn and Tuttle, 1990, p. 7-54).

2.4 Liniitatiens of Single-objective Optimization Methods In asset allocation optimization models, such as Model 2.1 and Model 2.2, an investor's objectives are generally defined in terms of return requirements or a utility function. Constraints are limitations such as budget constraints and nonnegative weights of assets (short sales not allowed). An investor's preferences or other considerations, such as taxation and liquidity, are generally integrated into the objective function or constraints. For example, if after-tax return is of interest, the expected returns, standard deviation and correlations will adopt after-tax values. If an investor imposes specific requirements for some assets, additional linear inequality and equality constraints may be needed to reflect the requirements. An important message firom these analyses is that, traditional portfolio optimization is in practice constructed as a single-objective decision problem. This modeling method may not be consistent with some real world characteristics of an investor's investment goal. For example, an investor, who seeks to maximize the expected total return while seeks to obtain current income, may find the model's objective is to maximize the total return, while the income objective comes as one of constraints. This model actually treats these two objectives as follows: the total return objective can only be achieved within such a firamework that current income objective ihust be fully met- It doesn't consider the relative 15

importance between income objective and total return objective. It is intuitive that if die investor feels the total retum is much more important, he may be willing to give up certain current income in order to achieve larger total retum if these two goals are actually conflicting with each other. Or, if the investor believes the current income is more important, he would be eager to relax some total return requirements. There can be a trade-off between two objectives. Another limitation of using single-objective portfolio optimization is that if multiple objectives do exist, they cannot be optimized at a time. Under the criteria of different objectives, the same portfolio may perform differently, sometimes significantly. For example, the total retum consists of two components, income (interest or dividends) and capital gain (loss). A portfolio whose majority of assets are stocks may perform better, in terms of capital gain objective, than a portfolio whose majority of assets are bonds in the long term. However, the later portfolio generally performs better than former in terms of current income objective. Another example, real estate assets may perform better than bonds in terms of real return. However, because of its illiquidity, an investor who is very concerned with asset liquidity may avoid to invest in it The result is the fraction of the real estate is reduced in the complete portfolio despite its superiority in terms of real retum objective. In these situations, the single-objective optimization solution actually may not be optimal in terms of the investor's overall objectives.

Chapter 3: Multi-objective Asset Allocation

Because of limitations of traditional portfolio modeling methods, it is desirable to consider an asset allocation problem as a multiple-objective decision problem. In this chapter, a multiple objective asset allocation method is proposed. This approach is intended to construct a portfolio that is consistent with multiple objective investment needs of an individual investor, while at the same time aim to improve the portfolio's overall efficiency in terms of multiple objectives. Trade-ofife between different objectives are considered. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), initially developed by Saaty (1980), is employed to develop a multiple-objective decision hierarchy. Single-objective portfolio optimization techniques are integrated into tiie model to construct local optimal portfolios. The basic procedure of this method is: (1) to identify the investor's objectives; (2) to evaluate the relative importance of these objectives; (3) for each objective, to construct a local optimal portfolio Using an optimization model; and (4) to obtain the complete portfolio by combining the local optimal portfolios according to their weights. 3.1 The Analytic Hierarchy Process The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) provides a proven, effective means to structure a complex multi-attribute decision problem. It begins by discomposing an unstructured multiple attribute decision problem into components. In its simplest form, this structure consists of three levels: goal, criteria and alternative levels. A typical AHP hierarchy is shown in Figure 3.1. Each component can be further decomposed into subcomponents at appropriate level of details. The process continues to the lowest level of hierarchy. After the decision hierarchy is constructed, relative priorities of one component over other components are evaluated and represented by numerical weights. Using the AHP, decision makers don't need to make an absolute judgment or assessment over all elements. Instead, decision makers are only required to make a relative assessment between two elements at a time. This makes decision process easier. For example, if there are six investment objectives, and an investor wants to evaluate their importance, clearly it is difficult to evaluate them directly. However, it is easier to compare one objective to another. In the final step of AHP, alternatives are ranked according to their weighted performance in terms of each criterion. 17

Figure S. 1: Typital AHP hierarchy

The AHP has been applied to many disciplines, such as conflict resolution and group decision making (Saaty, 1982), supplier selection (Muralidharan, et al., 2002)^ formulation of portfolio mix (Khaksari, et al., 1989) and determination of an investor's suitability (Bolster, et al., 1995). The AHP approach in asset allocation incorporates multiple dimensions of an investor's preferences into decision hierarchy, and considers the priorities of different objectives. Therefore, although the suitability of a portfolio recommendation is largely subjective, it is believed that the asset allocation generated by the AHP is consistent with the investor's objectives and preferences (Safaoglu and Detzler, 2002). 3.2 Proposed Multiple-obj ective Asset Allocation Model A "suitable" portfolio developed by traditional AHP is normally not optimal in a mean-variance sense. "There is no guarantee that the resulting portfolio will be the highest retum available at the given level of expected risk" (Bolster and Warrick, 2000). In order to improve its efficiency, an asset allocation model which integates the AHP decision hierarchy with traditional optimization techniques is proposed. The general hierarchy structure for M objectives and N asset classes is illustrated in Figure 3.2. In this hierarchy, the overall goal, located at the top, is the desired complete portfolio. The second level 18

consists of M local optimal portfolios, each of which is associated with the investor's one objective. The weights of local optimal portfolios are the same as those of associated objectives, which are evaluated using AHP priority analysis method. Each local portfolio can be obtained by solving an appropriate single-objective portfolio optimization model, which is shown in the third level of this hierarchy. The inputs for each optimization model are parameters needed to be estimated for the associated model. For mean-variance optimization, the parameters can be expected returns, standard deviations, correlations of asset classes and the investor's risk tolerance. The bottom level consists of N asset classes that will be weighted ;^d used to make up the local optimal portfolios. The overall goal is achieved by combining weighted local optimal portfolios. That is, the complete portfolio is obtained by combining the local optimal portfolios which are weighted according to their relativeimportance.

3.3 An Investor's Objectives After the decision hierarchy is constructed, the information about an investor's objectives should be obtained. Objectives vary from person to person and may change from time to time according to the investor's financial status and preferences. Some investors may seek assets that would grow in value and/or provide income, and want returns as large as possible. For others, the real future asset value, i.e., value measured in terms of purchasing power, may be more relevant For yet others, diey may be more concerned with the after-tax return. In research using the AHP to model multi-objective portfolio selection problems, the criteria used for choosing objectives vary significantly (see Bolster and Warrick, 2000; and Saraoglu and Detzler, 2002). Therefore, each investor should be treated individually. 20

One way to ascertain an investor's objectives is to use appropriately designed questionnaires. A sample questionnaire, as shown in Figure 3.3, is designed for gathering information about an investor's objectives and general, risk profile. Note that this questionnaire is not a replacement for obtaining the details of ah investor's financial status, such as income sources, savings, and the structure of financial'assets, which can be processed separately. This questionnaire serves for three purposes. First, it serves for compliance with regulatory requirements. For example, AIMR code of ethics and standards of professional conduct requires the Charted Financial Analysts (CFA) should "know" their customers before an investment recommendation is made (AIMR, 2003). Second, this questionnaire can be used to gather the necessary information for determining an investor's investment objectives. Based on this information, a financial advisor can design a customized questionnaire to assess the priority of an investor's objectives. Third, this questionnaire can be used to give the advisor general profile about an investor's risk tolerance. This information is helpful to the advisor when he selects the starting point for generating a reference portfolio list. Details about this topic will be discussed in Chapter 4. Unlike most of existing questionnaires, however, it does not provide a "measure" of an investor's risk tolerance. The reason is, the numerical values of risk tolerance, as defined in Sharpe's (1987) utility function, do not indicate the aggressiveness of a specific investor. A similar numerical value of risk tolerance, say, 50, may mean very aggressive in one situation while in others may mean relative conservative, depending on the choice of the reference portfolios.

3.4 Asset Classes and Objectives for a Hypothetical Investor An asset class is a group of assets that share some common properties. In broad terms, cash (or cash equivalents), bonds, stocks and real estate are four basic asset classes. The remaining asset classes are composed of precious metals and other assets, which are closely Jield and traded not frequently. Each of the asset classes can be subdivided into a number of smaller asset classes according to certain classification methods. For the
23

hypothetical investor in this project rqjort, six asset classes are employed for illustrative purpose. They are large-cap stocks (denoted as LaStock), small-cap stocks (denoted as SmStock), long-term corporate bonds (denoted as LCBond), long-term government bonds (denoted as LGBond), Treasury bills (denotes as T-Bill) and real estate (denoted as RealEst). Also, it is assumed that the financial advisor has learned from the investor's responses to the questionnaire shown in Figure 3.3 that the hypothetical investor has six major investment objectives: total nominal retum (denoted as TNR), capital appreciation (denoted as CA), current income (denoted as CRJ), after-tax retum (denoted as ATR), preservation of purchasing power (denoted as PP), and liquidity (denoted as LD). The PP and LD objectives should be transformed into retum requirements that can be used as objective functions for associated optimization models. These objectives are described below. Total Nominal Retum (TNR) This is the total retum that is not adjusted for the inflation factor. In dollar value, total retum of investment is the sum of coital gains and income received in the holding period. In this project report, the returns of asset classes or portfolios are defined in terms of percentage. Therefore, total nominal retum of investment is defined as the sum of nominal capital appreciation yield and the nominal income yield in the holding period. An asset's total nominal retum can be written as: TNR = Capital appreciation + Income Capital Appreciation (CA) Nominal capital appreciation (CA) is the difference between what the. investor paid for an asset purchased and what he may realize when the asset is sold. It can be written as: CA = (Ending price - Beginning price) / Beginning price Current Income (CRI) For stocks, current income consists of dividends that the investor receives from the shares
24

(3.4.1)

(3.4.2)

he holds. For T-bills and bonds, current income is the interest income. For real estate, current income is the lease income (assuming the property held is commercial real estate). The formula for nominal current income can be writtèn as: CRI = (Income received in the holding period) / Beginning price After-tax Return (ATR) Interests, dividends, and capital gains are subject to government taxation. Canadian tax system rewards equity investment for growth (capital appreciation) more than equity investment for dividend income, and in turn, rewards dividend income more than interest income. Here it is assumed that the hypothetical investor is in the top tax bracket (i.e., taxable income above $104,648 in Ontario), and the following combined (federal and provincial) marginal rate is used to adjust the total nominal retum: interest and ordinary income (46.41%), capital gains (23.20%), Canadian dividend (31.34%) (CCH, 2003, p. xii). Real estate incomes are treated as ordinary incomes. Preservation of Purchasing Power (PP) Nominal returns capture only the growth rate of an investment; real returns measure the growth rate of purchasing power of the wealth. There are differences between nominal and real returns because the inflation rate varies from period to period. Here a proxy, inflation-adjusted total return, is used to represent the objective of preservation of purchasing power. Adjustments can be made by subtracting die inflation rate from the total nominal returns. In practice, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is usually used to adjust the numbers (Maginn and Tuttle, 1990, p. 2-8). Liquidity (LD) Liquidity is usually defined ' as an asset's ability to be sold ^ d converted to cash approximately at current market prices. In order to be sold quickly, some assets may have to be sold in a larger discounted value. Or the large blocks of sell in a short period will result in the fall on the sale price, thus reduce the realized cash value. Cash and money market instruments, such as Treasury bills and commercial papers, where the bid-asked  25 (3.4.3)

spread is small, are the most liquid assets, and real estate is among the least liquid. Here a proxy, liquidity-adjusted retum (lAR), is used to represent the strength of an asset in serving with the liquidity objective. The formula for liquidity-adjusted retum can be written as: IAR = TNR LI (3.4.4)

X

LI is an asset's liquidity index, which is defined as the relative performance of one asset according to the needed time for this asset to be sold in the full market price. The needed liquidity time is transformed linearly to a scale of 0 to 1, with the best value (the shortest time) 1 and the worse value (the longest time) 0, using the following formula: W -T

where W denotes the longest time, B denotes the shortest time, and 7}denotes the needed time for asset / to be sold in the full market value. In the hypothetical example, it is assumed that the needed time for large-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, long-term corporate bonds, long-term government bonds, T-bills and real estate are 3, 14, 7, 7, 2 and 50 days, respectively. 3.5 The Decision Hierarchy for the Hypothetical Investor Following Markowitz (1952), it is assumed that, for each of the six objectives, standard deviation (or variance) is the appropriate measure for asset risk and portfolio risk. Then mean-variance optimization is the appropriate method to obtain each local optimal portfolio. The complete decision hierarchy for the hypothetical investor is shown in Figure 3.4. 3.6 Assets' Expected Returns, Standard Deviations and Correlations As stated in Chapter 2, the mean-variance optimization method utilizes active market estimation data. In the proposed model. Model 2.2 in Section 2.3 is employed to construct a local optimal portfolio for each objective. Model 2.2 requires estimates of two types of
26

inputs: one consists of the expected return and risk of each asset, and the correlations between each asset's retum with that of others; the other one is the investor's risk tolerance. The first type of parameters, discussed below, can be obtained from market research, which are identical for each investor regardless of his risk tolerance. The investor's risk tolerance should be evaluated according to the investor's personal preference. The details about the measurement of an investor's risk tolerance will be discussed separately in Chapter 4. Since asset allocation deals with future retum expectations of portfolios, expected values should be used. Expected returns are distinguished from historical returns. Historical returns record the performances of an asset over a specified historical period. They are known with certainty. Expected returns measure the estimates of returns over some future period. They are probabilistic in nature.

Expected retum of an asset is often estimated by using scenario analysis. It is the weighted average of returns in all possible scenarios, where the weights are the occurrence probability of each return. Thus, the expected retum of an asset can be written as (Bodie, et al., 1997, p. 181):
/

E (R )= Y
1=1

( 3 .6 .1 )

Where E(R) is the asset's expected retum; R ,- is the estimated retum for zth possible scenario, and pt is the associated probability of zth scenario. I is the number of possible scenarios. I Under Markowitz's mean-variance theory, an asset's risk is measured by the variance (or standard deviation) of expected retum For scenario analysis, the variance is calculated by the weighted squared deviations of the expected retum in all possible scenarios. Symbolically, it can be written as (Bodie, etaL, 1997, p. 181):

a ^ = '£ p ,lR ,-E (R )Y
i=l

(3.6.2)

For this project report, because of the practical limitations, historical data are adopted in the illustrative example, which are shown in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2. Research shows that historical, data are quite useful for estimating standard deviations, reasonably usefiil for predicting correlations, and virtually useless for estimating expected returns (Magnn and Tuttle, 1990, P. 7-37). Moreover, the time horizons of the data used are not consistent with each other. From these points of view, the data adopted in this project serve only for illustrative purpose. In Table 3.1, returns and. standard deviations of real estate are partially adopted from Ciochetti et al. (2003) for the period 1978-2002. For each of the otiier five assets, the total nominal retum (TNR), capital appreciation (CA), cuixent income (CRI), and inflation-adjusted retum (PP) are partially adopted firom Ibboston Associates for period 1926-1988 (Maginn and Tuttle, 1990, p, 2-9). The data for after-tax retum (ATR) and liquidity-adjusted retum (LD) are adjusted data using methods discussed in Section 3.4.

3.7 Pairwise Comparisons of Objectives In AHP, decision makers express their preferences for a set of alternatives by constructing a matrix of pairwise comparisons in terms of oiie criterion. This matrix Dm, shown below, is a positive reciprocal matrix satisfying the requirements of d{j> 0 and \ldji = dij, where i,j --1 ,2 ,. :., m, and m is the number of alternatives. Each element dij in the matrix represents the decision maker's subjective judgment of alternative / over/

Pairwise comparison judgments are made using a 1-9 scale. The suggested scale by Saaty (1980) is shown in Table 3.3. For example, if an element i is judged to be moderately important than element j, a "5" number is entered as the value for the pairwise comparison judgment dij in the matrix Dm, while its reciprocal value, "1/5", is entered for the pairwise comparison judgment dji . ___________ Table 3.3: Suggested scale for AHP ratio assessments__________ The ratio for attribute,1 over attribute II should be: ..· 1 If the two attributes are judged to be equally important 3 If attribute I is judged to be slightly more important than attribute II 5 If attribute I is judged to be moderately more important than attribute II 7 If attribute I is judged to be strongly more important than attribute II 9 If attribute I is judged to be extremely more important than attribute II 2,4,6,8 If intermediate values between two adjacent judgments are needed (Source: Hobbs and Meier, 2000, p. 78) An investor's relative preference can be evaluated by a designed questionnaire. For the illustrative asset allocation example, a sample questionnaire is shown in Figure 3.5. After the investor makes the responses to the questionnaire, the scale values are entered into the comparison matrix. For the illustrative purpose, it is assumed that the hypothetical investor makes the responses shown in Table 3.4. Since the matrix reflecting the investor's actual attitude may not be known, this comparison matrix in Table 3.4 is the observed matrix.

The priority vector can be obtained from the given comparison matrix. In mathematical terms, the normalized principle eigenvector of matrix Dm is the vector of priorities. For 32

matrix Dm, a good estimate of the principal eigenvector (EV) can be described as to multiply the m elements in each row and take the mth foot (Saaty, 1980, p. 19):

3.8 Consistency Test Before determining the normalized principal eigenvector is a good estimate of the relative weights of the six investment objectives, die consistency of the investor's responses should be tested. Many times investors may not fully understand their own preferences and often make inconsistent preference responses (Saraoglu and Detzler, 2002), For example, suppose an investor has made expression that capital appredatioii (CA) is more important than current income (CRI). The investor also believes the current income objective is more important than the preservation of purchasing power (PP) objective. The same investor may also make a response that preservation of purchasing power is more important than capital appreciation, which is inconsistent with his previous answer. Psychological research also shows that consistency of comparisons declines as the number of elements increases (Khaksari, et al., 1989). That is, the consistency of responses are normally not perfect A suitable asset allocation plan can be achieved only after the investor makes reasonable consistent responses. A matiix D,, of order m is said to be consistent, ^ defined by,$aaty (1980), if it satisfies the following transitivity requirements: 33

dij =dik^di^ fori, j, For example, if

k = l,2 ,

(3.8.1)

= 2, and d23 =3, in a consistent matrix the value of di3 has to be 6.

One of the important advantages of AHP approach is that it can check the consistency of comparison matrix using its built-in mechanism. Consistency is tested by using consistency index and consistency ratio, a technique suggested by Saaty (1980, 1994). Consistency index {Cl) is a measure of the deviation of an observed matrix from a consistent matrix. If we denote X m ax the largest dgenvalue of observed matrix of pairwise comparisons, then the consistency index (C/) can be written as: Cl = (3.8.2)

w --1

The value of X m ax, formulated as (3.8.3), is considered an estimation of m. The closer of the value ofXmax to m, the more consistent is matrix £),,. b;

^m ax = max

( 3. 8.3)

y = i

where hi, bj {i,j =1,2,..., tm ) are the elements of principal eigenvector of matrix Dm. The average consistency index of randomly generated reciprocal matrices is called average consistency index (RT). Consistency ratio is the ratio of consistency index (Ci) to average consistency index (RI) of the same order matrices, which can be written as:

C R= ^

(3.8.4)

For 1-10 order of matrix, the values of Ü / canbe taken from Table 3.5 (Saaty, 1994). Table 3.5: The average random consistency index Matrix order m RI 1 2 3 4 5 6 .7 8 9 10 0.00 0.00 0.52 0.89 1.11 1.25 1.35 1.40 1.45 1.49

Source: Saaty (1994). Saaty (1994) also suggested that, the consistency of a comparison matrix is acceptable if the required consistency ratio (CR) is less than or equal to 0.1. If the consistency of an
34

observed matrix is accepted, the elements in the normalized principal eigenvector are considered the good estimates of the weights of objectives. When a pairwise matrix fails the consistency test, and if.the number of order is large, it is difficult to revise Ihe matrix without the assistance of computer. A number of algorithms have been developed to improve the consistency of pairwise comparisons. For example, Xu and Wei (1999) developed a method to modify a given matrix to acceptable consistency without requiring the initial respondent to make any revisions. Peters and Zelewski (2003) developed a heuristic algorithm to adjust an observed inconsistent matrix iteratively to improve the consistency. Ishizaka and Lusti (2003) described an expert module application which can assist the dedsion maker to build a consistent matrix or a matrix with tolerated error. 3.9 Spreadsheet Model for Objective Weighting Spreadsheets are powerful tools for performing tasks involving related data such as calculating objective weights and performing consistency test For the hypothetical asset allocation problem, we design a model using Microsoft Excel as shown in Figure 3.6. Input data and formula or functions used in this model are illustrated in Figure 3.7. : This model functions as follows: users (investors or financial advisors) input the scale values obtained from the questionnaire given in Figure 3.5. The number of indq>endent inputs is equal to the number of questions. For this example, it is 15. Comparisons on principal diagonal are all Is. Other values are redprocal values of corresponding independent inputs and can automatically be filled using Excel built-in formula. Once the data have been input, the principal eigenvector of the comparison .matrix is calculated automatically and shown in cell range H6:H11. The normalized principal eigenvector is shown in cell range 16:111. The consistency of the matrix is tested at the same time. The dgenvalues of this matrix are shown in cells J6:J11. They are obtained using the following formula: Zf = ^

The consistency test result is shown in cell G14. It is calculated using Excel function IF(E18<=0.1,1,0). It means if the consistency test is passed (CR ^ 0.1), the answer is "Yes" ("1" in cell 014). If the test is not passed (CR > 0.1), the answer is "No" ("0" in cell 014), and the investor's responses to the questionnaire should be revised to improve consistency. In this example CR < 0.1, the consistency of the observed matrix is accepted.

Chapter 4: Estimating an Investor's Risk Tolerance

Assets' expected returns, standard deviations and correlations were discussed in Chapter 3. These inputs, however, r^resent only half of the ingredients required for determining ah optimal and suitable portfolio. In this chapter, another important input factor, an investor's risk tolerance, will be discussed, and a method to measure it based on Sharpe's (1987) utility function definition is proposed. In the proposed method, an investor's risk tolerance is defined as the ratio of added portfolio variances to added portfolio returns, considering the investor's relative degree of preference between two reference portfolios. The investor selects his own reference portfolios. The AHP technique is used to evaluate the relative degree of preference between reference portfolios. Risk tolerance obtained firam the proposed method can be entered directly as one input into Model 2.2 to determine a local optimal portfolio. . 4.1 Traditional Risk Tolerance Measurements Modem portfolio theory indicates that the asset allocation decision process can be separated into two independent processes (Saraoglu and Detzler, 2002). First, a variety of optimal risky portfolios are constructed using the input data firom the results of market research, such as assets' expected returns, standard deviations and correlations. For the same input data, these optimal risky portfolios are identical for all investors regardless of their risk tolerance. Second, the optimal complete portfolio is determined by considering the investor's preference and risk tolerance level. Risk tolerance is a person's emotional and financial capacity to tolerate the ups and downs of the investment market Risk tolerances vary firom person to person, and from period to period. Some are associated with personality factors, while others are related to the stages in the investor's life cycle. Financial advisors often ask individual investors to fill out a questionnaire whose primary purpose is to .assess the investors' risk tolerance as well as time horizon, investment experience, and financial status. Each question in the questionnaire is given a score and the scores are accumulated. A recommendation of asset allocation is typically based on the accumulated score of an investor's responses using rules of thumb. For example, portfolio allocation scoring system (PASS), the first 39 .

published risk tolerance questionnaire developed by Droms in early 1980s (see Droms and Strauss (2003)), is such a system that the more aggressive the investor's return objectives and the higher the investor's risk tolerance, the more scores will be assigned to the investor. The higher the score, the more aggressive is the asset allocation plan. Other questionnaires, such as ones developed by New York Institute of Finance (2003) and Vanguard Group (2003), provide similar functions. PASS and most existing questionnaire-based measurements use the accumulated score to choose an asset allocation plan according to pre-designed investment categories. No doubt, these methods provide practical convenience to investment companies and financial advisors. However, it is not realistic that a definitive asset allocation plan can be obtained · by a questionnaire itself (Droms and Strauss, 2003). Also, using a scoring system to measure risk tolerance may not have theoretic support that allows the value of risk tolerance to be incorporated into an optimization model such as Model 2.2 directly. In order to model efiicient asset allocation problems. Bolster and Warrick (2000) used the risk acceptance parameter (RAP) to reflect the scores. A higher RAP indicates greater risk tolerance. They estimated the value of risk tolerance by assigning a RAP value according to the responses of an investor made to a designed questionnaire. Using this method, the value of risk tolerance can be incorporated directly into an optimization model. However, there is a drawback of using this method. Although the response to the questionnaire reflects the investor's risk attitude, it is not necessarily also true for the value of RAP assigned, simply because there is no direct link between these two numbers. The RAP reflects just the advisor's, instead of the investor's, subjective attitude because the value of risk tolerance heavily depends on the selection of reference portfolios. Moreover, in a multiple objective modeling context, since the performance of asset classes varies significantly in terms of different objectives, using rules of thumb to assign the risk tolerance value is not useful. 4.2 Theoretic Foundation for the Proposed Method The proposed method is based on Sharpe's (1987) utility function definition and risk tolerance definition. Sharpe assumed an investor's objective was to maximize the expected utility of wealth. As discussed in Section 2.3, the utility function can be illustrated by
40

such a formula:


U = E\Rp)^ a I

(4.2.1)

where:

U = utility of portfolio for

given investor,

E(Rp) = expected return of portfolio ; Op = standard deviation of return of portfolio; and r = the investor's risk tolerance. In this formula, an investor's risk tolerance is assumed constant, and defined as the added variance for per unit of added expected return, providing the same utility for the investor (Maginn and Tuttle, 1990, p. 7-9). A method for nieasuring risk tolerance can be derived fi-om this formula and is described below.

Along the efficient fi' ontier showed in Figure 4.1, each portfolio, with given expected return E(Rp), has associated standard deviation op, which is minimal among all available portfolio mix. However, different optimal portfolio mix may provide different utility to the giveri investor, hr Figure 4.1, portfolio ^ 41 with expected return E(Ra) and standard

return E(Rc) and standard deviation oc, provides the investor with utility value of Uc. Every portfolio in the investor's indifference curve provides the same level of utility to the given investor. For two portfolios, A and C, the exact values of utilities are unknown to both the investor and the financial advisor. However, the investor's relative degree of preference between these two portfolios can be estimated through appropriately designed procedures. If the investor's relative degree of preference between portfolio A and portfolio C is denoted by k, then ^ can be expressed as: U k =^

(4.2.4)

From (4.2.2), (4.2.3), and (4.2.4), we can derive the following formula:

Formula (4.2.5) indicates that an investor's risk tolaunce can be defined as the ratio of added portfolio variances to added portfolio returns, consideriiig tlie investor's relative degree of preference between two reference portfolios. Therefore, if the characteristics of two reference portfolios, E(Ra), oa and E(Rc), oc, as well as the value of k, are known, the value of t can be determined. In the next sections of this chapter, methods to obtain the appropriate reference portfolios and to estimate the value of k are proposed. The investor selects his own reference portfolios fium the candidates provided by the financial advisor. His relative degree of preference between the two reference portfolios is evaluated throu^ the AHP technique. 42

4.3 Selection of Reference Portfolios

'

In order to measure an investor's risk tolerance, the financial advisor should first obtain two reference portfolios with known characteristics. These two portfolios can be found along the efficient fi-ontier if we assume that the investor is rational, that is, he always prefers the higher return and less risk. The selection, of reference portfolios significantly affects the value, of risk tolerance. In order to let the investor make a better and more clear comparison, one of the two portfolios should be considered as very conservative, and the other should be considered as very aggressive. These two portfolios, A and C, can be described as follows: Portfolio A: An efficient portfolio that the investor believes is very conservative. It has a small expected return and a small variance. Portfolio C: An efficient portfolio that the investor believes is very aggressive. It has a large expected return and a large variance. There are two options for the selection procedure. The first one is the advisor provides the reference portfolios to the investor. The second one is the investor selects own reference portfolios. The first option is more convenient but the investor may not think the reference portfolios are suitable to him. Because different people have different risk attitudes towards a same portfolio, the "aggressiveness" of reference portfolios is vague if they are not selected by an investor himself. This difference can be illustrated by an example. Assuming there are two portfolios, say, A and C, which are considered conservative and aggressive respectively by the advisor. The investor is asked to choose one of them to invest in it If investor chooses portfolio C, he is considered "aggressive". If the investor chooses A, he is considered "conservative". However, to the investor himself,, he may think he is just choosing the "right" portfolio according to his own preference, neither "aggressive" nor "conservative". It means an investor doesn't always think in the same manner as the advisor or other people, who select die reference portfolios. Therefore, it is desirable to ask the investor to select his own reference portfolios. Considering ffie limited investment knowledge of an investor, in the proposed method, the advisor will provide several candidate portfolios, and the investor chooses reference portfolios firom the candidates. . 43 -

4.4 Select the .Conservative Reference Portfolio The expected return of a portfolio is determined by the characteristics of assets making up the portfolio. It is a weighted average of the expected returns for individual assets in the portfolio. Usually people believe that, if an investor is willing to invest most of his funds to assets that have low volatility of expected returns, he is conservative; because usually the lower the volatility, the lower is the return. Since the advisor only helps an investor select reference portfolio instead of making judgment for him, a reasonable number of candidate portfolios should be provided. A procedure based on a heuristic method is used to select the conservative reference portfolio. L 4.4.1 Heuristic Method The following heuristic can be used to select the conservative reference portfolio A: A very conservative portfolio = The first portfolio, fiom the top down in a list of portfolio (called Ac) which the specified investor believes it is investable. Here Ac denotes the set of the efficient portfolios that most people believe they are very conservative. The portfolios in A« are sorted in terms of their relative conservativeness and the top portfolio in the list is the most conservative. The statement means the investor believes the reference portfolio A is investable in terms of his preference, although the possibility to invest in it is low because it is too conservative to him. Based on the above heuristic, a procedure to select reference portfolio A is described as follows. Step 1: The financial advisor generates the list A« that includes several efficient portfolios that are usually believed (that is, according to the advisor's .experience) as very conservative. The ^obal minimum variance portfolio K, described in Chapter 2, is the low bound of this list. Step 2: The financial advisor sorts these portfolios in A« in decreasing order according to their relative conservativeness. The most conservative portfolio is sorted at the top of the list 44 ............

Step 3: The financial advisor asks the investor to judge if it is possible for him to invest in one of the portfolios, starting from the top of the list Ac. If the answer is no, ask the investor to make judgment for the next portfolio. This procedure continues until the investor makes a positive answer.

4.4.2 The Global Minimum Variance Portfolio The global minimum variance portfolio K is considered as the most conservative portfolio. It can be used as a good starting point for die advisor to generate candidate reference portfolios.
\

All portfolios along the efficient frontier have such a property that when the expected return decreases, its standard deviation also decreases. Portfolios on both sides of the · global minimum variance portfolio K have larger variance than K. As shown in Figure 4.2, when the expected return of a portfolio continues to decrease and once passes K, the portfolio's variance no longer decreases but increases. It is said this portfolio becomes inefficient. Based on this property, a heuristic algorithm is developed to find the portfolio K, This algorithm is to search along the efficient frontier with decreasing expected returns until the variance of one portfolio is found to be larger than its predecessor.

The flowchart based on the above algorithm is shown in Figure 4.3. The procedure is implemented as follows. First, specify an initial target return, solve the mean-variance 46

optimization model (denoted as Model 4.1) and obtain a minimum variance VI. Then decrease the target return value by one step length, solve Model 4.1 again, and obtain current minimum variance V2. Compare VI with V2. If VI is larger than the current variance V2, continue the search. If V2 is larger than VI, this means the predecessor of the current portfolio is the global minimum variance portfolio. Model 4.1 is a quadratic programming model used to find the optimal value of portfolio variance associated with given expected target return. This model is an alternative formulation of Markvitiwz model (Model 2.1). Its general formulation is written as follows:

Computer programs based on General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS, developed by GAMS Development Corporation) language are written to implement the algorithm for 47

4.4.3 Generating the List Ac of the Candidate Portfolios A simple algorithm is used to generate the list Ac of the candidate portfolios. The financial advisor first specifies an initial small target return for one portfolio. This value can be the expected return of the global minimum portfolio K. But it is up to thé advisor's choice if the portfolio K is believed to be too conservative and he would like to limit the size of the list. After generating the first portfolio, increase the target return by one step length, solve Model 4.1 again, and obtain the second portfolio. Continue this procedure until the required size of candidate portfolios is met The flowchart based on this algorithm is shown in Figure 4.4. GAMS programs are written to implement the algorithm for generating the list of candidate conservative portfolios for each objective (see Appendices 1.2, 2 .2 , 3 .2 , 4.2, 5.2, and 6.2). The inputs for each program are the initial target value of expected return, the step length as well as the required size of list n. The outputs are the characteristics of each portfolio, including the expected return, standard deviation, and optimal weight of each asset class making up the portfolio. Sorting the portfolios in the list is automatically completed using the above algorithm.

4.4.4 Select the Reference Portfolio A Using Questionnaires The investor selects his own reference portfolio from the candidate portfolio list Ac provided by the advisor. This procedure can be implemented by using questionnaires. Normally investors consider the portfolio return Md risk in terms of dollar value, so presenting one portfolio to investors in dollar value description may be more straightforward. If the return distribution is assumed to follow approximately the normal distribution, then the chance that the outcome value of expected return will fall in [E(R)
49

+ a ] is 68 % (approximately two of three times), and the chance that the outcome value of expected return will fall in [E(R) ±3o] is 99.7%. If the extreme value is considered as worse or best case, the following description of portfolio can be used when designing a questionnaire. The description of portfolio A: You have an available capital of $V. If you invest it in portfolio A, the average net return of this investment by the end of investment period will be $V x E(Ra). Two out of three times that the net return of this investment will coihe out to be between $Vx
[E(Ra) - Oa] and $V x [E(Ra) + oa]

However, in the worse case, the investment will

lose $V x [E(Ra) - 3o a ], and in the best case the investment will gain $V x [E(Ra) + 3oa]; A sample questionnaire, designed for selecting the conservative reference portfolio in terms of the total nominal return objective, is shown in Figure 4.5. If the response from the investor is "absolutely not", the advisor presents other portfolios in the candidate list one by one. If the investor's answer is "it is possible", set this portfolio as the reference portfolio A.

4.5 Select the Aggressive Reference Portfolio The expected return of a portfolio is limited and must fall between the hipest and lowest expected returns of the component individual assets. Usually people believe that, if an investor is willing to invest most of his funds to assets that have highest attainable Kcpected returns, he is aggressive; because usually the higher the return, the higher is the risk. But for an individual investor, his attitude towards the definition of aggressiveness may vary significantly. For example, some investors may think investing in stocks is always a very risky action and always try to avoid it. Therefore, the maximum return portfolio is not necessarily the right aggressive reference portfolio for a specific investor. A procedure based on a heuristic method is used to select the aggressive reference portfolio.

Figure 4.5 : Example questionnaire for selecting the conservative reference portfolio

4.5.1 Heuristic Method The heuristic used for selecting the aggressive reference portfolio can be expressed as follows: A very aggressive portfolio = The first portfolio, from the top down in set C» that the specified investor believes it is investable. Here C» denotes the set of efficient portfolios that most people believe they are very aggressive. The portfolios in C. are sorted in terms of their relative aggressiveness and the top portfolio in the list is the most aggressive. The statement means the investor b eliev es the reference portfolio C is investable in terms of his preference, although the possibility to invest in it is low because it is too aggressive to him. Based on the above heuristic, a procedure used to select reference the reference portfolio C is suggested as follows: 51

Step 1: The financial advisor generates the list C, that includes several efficient portfolios that are usually believed (that is, according to the advisor's experience) as very aggressive. The maximum return portfolio Q, described in Chapter 2, is the upper bound of this list Step 2: The financial advisor sorts the portfolios in C» in decreasing order according to their relative aggressiveness. The most aggressive portfolio is sorted at the top of the list Step 3: The financial advisor asks the investor to judge if it is possible for him to invest in one of the portfolios, starting firom the top of the list If the answer is no, ask die investor to make judgment for the next portfolio. This procedure continues until the investor makes a positive answer. 4.5.2 The Maximum Return Portfolio The maximum return portfolio Q is considered as the most aggressive efficient portfolio. It can be used as a good starting point for the advisor to generate candidate aggressive reference portfolios.

All portfolios along the efficient frontier have such a property that when the standard deviation, incre^es, expected retpm also increases. Portfolios on both sides of the maximum return portfolio Q have smaller expected return than Q. As shown in Figure 4.6, when the standard deviation of a portfolio continues to increase and once passes Q, the portfolio's return no longer increases but decreases. It is said this portfolio becomes mefficient. Based on this property, a heuristic algorithm is developed to find the portfolio Q. This algorithm is to search along the efficient frontier with increasing variances until the expected return of one portfolio is found to be smaller than its predecessor. .The flowchart based on the above algorithm is shown in Figure 4 .7 . The procedure is implemented as follows. First, specify an initial target variance, solve the mean-variance optimization model as given in Model 2.1, and obtain an optimal return Rl. Then increase the target variance value by one step length, solve Model 2.1 again, and obtain the current optimal return R2. Compare Rl with R2. If Rl is smaller than the current optimal return R2, continue the search. If Rl is larger than R2, this means the predecessor of the current portfolio is the maximum return portfolio. GAMS programs are written to implonent the algorithm for finding the maximum return portfolio for each objective (see Appendices 1.3,2 .3 ,3.3,4.3,5.3, and 6.3). The inputs for each program are the initial target value of standard deviation and the step length. The outputs are the characteristics of the portfolio Q, including the expected return, standard deviation, and optimal weight of each asset class making up the portfolio. The results for the hypothetical investment example using data of Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 are shown in Table 4.2. Table 4.2: The maximum return portfolio for each objective

4.5.3 Generating the List Ca of the Candidate Portfolios The algorithm used to generate the candidate portfolio list C, is similar to the one used to 54

generate the candidate conservative portfolio list Ac. The financial advisor first specifies an initial large target return for one portfolio. This initial value can be the expected return of the maximum return portfolio Q. But it is*up to the advisor's choice if the portfolio Q is believed to be too aggressive and he would like to liniit the size of the list After generating die first portfolio, decrease the target return by one step length, solve Model 4.1 again, obtain the second portfolio. The process stops once the required size of candidate portfolios is reached. The flowchart based on this algorithm is shown in the Figure 4.8. GAMS programs similar to ones given in Appendices 1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, and 6.2 are used to implement the algorithm for generating the candidate aggressive portfolio list for each objective. The inputs for each program are the initial target value of expected return, the step length, as well as the required size of the li^t n.

4.6 Relative Degree of Preference between Reference Portfolios After the reference portfolios are chosen, flie next step is to obtain the investor's-relative preference of two portfolios for each objective. Because both portfolios A and C are not the desired portfolio for the investor, he is not asked to make direct comparison between portfolios A and C. Instead, another reference portfolio, the investor's desired portfolio, is employed as a medium to derive the relative preference between portfolio A and C. This portfolio, denoted as portfolio B, is the one that the investor will most likely choose, but it is not necessary for him to know the exact characteristics of this portfolio. Questionnaires, such as the sample questionnaire shown in Figure 4.10, are designed to assess the investor's, relative degree of preference. In these questionnaires, the investor is asked to express his preference between portfolio B and A, and his preference between B and C, in terms of each objective. The scale used in this questionnaire is similaf to the one suggested by Saaty (1980). ·

This questionnaire is designed for the purpose o f assessing your preference over the reference portfolios in terms o f the total nominal return o^'cctive. You have selected Portfolio A as a conservative portfolio and selected Portfolio C as the aggressive portfolio. The portfolio, say, B, is your most desired portfolio. Please use the.suggested scale to represent your preference between t\vo portfolios in terms of the total nominal return objective. The former portfolio mentioned in each question is referred as'portfolio I, and the latter portfolio is referred as portfolio tt

If the investor takes a normal action, that is, neither aggressive nor conservative according tp the investor's own judgment, then most likely the answer, for example, is: · B is ,strongly preferred over A and B is strongly preferred over C --(Statement 1). If the investor takes a more aggressive action, then portfolio B becomes more aggressive, and the possible answer, for example, is, . B is slightly preferred over C but strongly preferred over A - (Statement 2).

If the investor,takes a more conservative action, then portfolio B becomes more conservative, and the possible answer, for example, is, B is slightly preferred over A but strongly preferred over C --(Statement 3). No matter what action he takes, the aggressiveness of portfolio B will lie between A and C, the lower and upper bound of the feasible portfolios. A comparison matrix involving three portfolios. A, B, and C, c ^ be constructed. The scale values for above three statements are entered to the matrix, the diagonal comparisons are filled with "1". The resulting matrices are shown in Table 4.4. Table 4.4: Initial comparison matrices for portfolios A ^B and C

A A 1 B 7 C ?

B C 1/7 ? 7 1 1/7 1

A B C A 1 1/3 ? B 3 1 7 C ? 1/7 1

The question mark "?" in the matrices means the investor doesn't have to make a direct comparison between A and C. Instead, the consistency requirement of the comparison matrix is used to derive the answer. Or, if the investor does make a direct comparison, the consistent test still should be performed.

59

A comparison matrix involving three portfolios, A, B and C can be written as:

^AA -- ^BA A
ca

^A B ^B B ^CB

^A C ^B C ^C C .

(4.6. 1)

A perfectly consistent matrix should satisfy the transitivity and reciprocity requirements. For matrix Dj, the following equalities should be held: dA C-- dA B X dec dcA --1/dAC (4.6.2) (4.6.3) the matrices

Using these formulae to calculate the scale values for cells assigned with in Table 4.4 are transformed to those in Table 4.5. Table 4.5: Comparison matrices for portfolios A , B and C

The fractions, 3/7 and 7/3 in matrices of Table 4.5, don't have corresponding suggested scales, so they have to be rounded. For example, the closest suggested scale for 3/7 is 1/2 or 1, and for 7/3, that is 2 or 3, and so o a Which value is selected will depend on the investor's preference, as long as the consistency requirement is met The complete comparison matrices for the hypothetical investor are shown in T ^le 4.6. .

Consistency Test and Relative Degree of Preference Calculations Similar to matrix D,, discussed in Section 3.7, for matrix Dj defined in formula (4 .6 .1), a good estimate of the principal eigenvector (EV) can be described as to multiply the elements in each row and take the 3"* root The formula is written as:

EV = {b ^,b s,b cY where =

(4.6.8)

For the observed matrix, the consistency index Cl, as definW in formula (3.8.2), is calculated by: a = (4 6-9)

From Table 3.5, for the order of matrix in= 3, the average random consistency index RI = 0.52. The consistency ratio CR, as defined in formula (3.8.4), should be no larger than 0.1 for compliance with acceptable consistency. If the consistency of comparison matrix is accepted, then the relative degree of preference brtween the two reference portfolios, k, is estimated by the ratio of the normalized priority values of the two portfolios. This relationship can be expressed as:

4.7 Spreadsheet Model for Calculating the Degree of Preference Similar to the spreadsheet model developed in Chapter 3 for calculating objective weights and performing the consistency test. Excel models are designed to calculate the investor's relative degree of preference between reference portfolios and perform the consistency tests. The sample model shown in Figure 4.11. is developed for the situation when the hypothetical investor takes an aggressive action. The formulae and functions used in this model are shown in Figure 4.12.

Figure 4.12: Excel model iiçuts and formulae for Figure 4.11.

In this Excel model, the financial advisor inputs the scale values of the investor's responses to the designed questionnaire shown in Figure 4.10. The number of inputs equals to the number of questions. In fact, only two independent input data are needed to enter into cell B7 and cell D7. Diagonal comparisons are filled with "1". Other values are filled using Excel built-in formulae. The value in cell D6 is obtained using formula D6=C6*D7, which is designed for compliance with initial transitivity requirements. This value can be adjusted according to the investor's preference as long as the consistency requirement is satisfied. The principal eigenvector is shown in cell range E6 :E8. The normalized principal 63

eigenvector is shown in cell range F6 :F8 . The consistency test results are shown in cell E14. If the consistency test is passed (CR < =0.1), the answer is "Yes" ("1" in cell E14). If the test is not passed (CR > 0.1), tlie answCT is "No" ("0" in cell E14). In this example, the consistency of the matrix is accepted. The relative degree of preference between portfolio A and portfolio C, k, is shown in cell E12, which is obtained by using formula (4.6.10). Similar models can be designed to calculate the investor's relative d ^ e e of preference when he takes normal action or conservative action and to perform the consistency tests. The values of the relative degree of prefereiice for die hypothetical investor, whose comparison matrices are shown in Table 4.6, are summarized in Table 4.7. For different objectives, the same investor may make different responses. Thus the relative degrees of preference between reference portfolios may be different However, for illustrative purpose, it is assumed that for each of six objectives, the investor makes the similar responses.

4.8 Construction of Local Optimal Portfolios After the investor's relative degree of preference between two reference portfolios is obtained, the investor's risk tolerance, t, can be calculate! using formula (4.2.5). The value of t, along with eiqiected returns, standard deviations of asset classes and their correlation coefficients, are the inputs to Model 2.2, which is used to obtain die local optimal portfolio for each objective. Replacing the risk tolerance t with formula (4.2.5), Model 2.2 can be modified. The modified Model 2.2 is shown as Model 4.2. For each local optimization model, the expected returns and standard deviations of two reference portfolios, A and C, can be obtained from Table 4.3, and the investor's relative degree of preference betw'' een the two reference portfolios can be obtained from Table 4.7.

Chapter 5: Complété Portfolios and Comparisons

Based on the methods described in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, a complete portfolio for an individual investor can be obtained. In this chapter, the basic procedure of the proposed multiple-objective asset allocation approach is first reviewed. Then the complete portfolios constructed for the hypothetical investor are presented. A deviation index is suggested to measure the overall inefficiency of complete portfolios from efficient portfolios. Comparisons of the overall efficiency are made among die complete portfolios obtained by the proposed model and those of portfolios obtained by a single-objective optimization method. 5.1 The Process of Constructing a Complete Portfolio In the proposed method, the asset allocation problem for an individual investor is considered as a multiple-objective decision making problem. The general model of the proposed approach for M objectives and N asset classes is presented in Figure 3.2. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AH?) is employed as the framework to address an investor's multiple investment objectives. Traditional portfolio optimization techniques are integrated into the AH? decision hierarchy. In the asset allocation process involving a financial advisor and a client, the client's investment objectives and preferences are reflected through effective communications with the financial advisor. The advisor offers expertise through providing available market opportunities, designing customized questionnaires and helping the client making effective judgments. The result of this asset allocation process is to construct a complete portfolio that is consistent with the investor's investment goals while considering the portfolio's overall efficiency. The basic procedure of constructing such a complete portfolio based on our proposed method is summarized as follows: Step I: The financial advisor gathers information from the investor. Questionnaires such as Figure 3.3 are used. The investor makes responses to the questionnaire provided by the financial advisor. The investor's investment objectives and general risk profile are obtained in this step. Step 2: The financial adwsor designs customized questionnaires such as Figure 3.5 to
66

assess the priority of .the investor's r multiple investment objectives^ The investor's responses to the questionnaires are tested for consistency and the relative preferences are evaluated using the AHP techniques. Spreadsheet models such as Figure 3.6 can be used to perform these tasks. The relative importance of the investor's objectives is obtained in this step: 

Step 3; The financial advisor transforms the investor's investment objectives into return requurements that can be used as objective functions of appropriate optimization models. The data from capital market research results should be available in this step. For mean-variance optimizations, the data of asset classes' expected return, standard deviation and correlations in terms of each objective are needed. Using these data, the efiBcient frontier in terms of each objective is obtained. In this step, the financial advisor provides the "market opportunities" to the investor. Step 4: The financial advisor generates candidate refermce portfolios with the aid of computer programs. The investor selects his own reference portfolios from the candidates. Questionnaires such as Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.9 are used. Reference portfolios that reflect the investor's risk attitude and personal preferences are obtained in this step. Step 5: The investor make responses to questionnaires such as Figure 4.10 to express his preference between his desired portfolio and reference portfolios in terms of each objective. The responses are tested for consistency and the investor's relative degree of preference between reference portfolios is evaluated using the AHP technique. Spreadsheet models such as Figure 4.11 are used to perform these tasks. The investor's risk tolerance is estimated in this step. Step 6: The financial advisor constructs each local optimal portfolio in tarns of each investment objective of the investor. Quadratic programming models such as Model 4.2 are used to combine the market opportunities with the investor's preferences. The local optimal portfolios associated with the investor's objectives are obtained in this stq). Step 7: The financial advisor constructs the complete portfolio by combining the local optimal portfolios according to the relative importance of their associated objectives. The complete portfolio, a mix of different asset classes, is obtained in this step.
67

5.2 Complete Portfolios for the Hypothetical Investor In Chapter 3, the relative importance of the six investment objectives of the hypothetical investor is obtained, as shown in Table 3.6 and the left sides of Tables 5.1,5.2 and 5.3. In Chapter 4, the investor's risk tolerance is incorporated into the associated optimization model to determine the local optimal portfolio for each objective. The local optimal portfolios for the hypothetical investor when he takes aggressive, normal and conservative actions are displayed in the right sides of Tables 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 respectively. The items for each portfolio include the relative weight, expected return, standard deviation, and the fraction of each assets making up the portfolio. The complete portfolios are obtained by combining the weighted local optimal portfolios according to their relative importance. The proportion of a complete portfolio invested in each individual asset class is obtained using formula (3.2.3). For the hypothetical investor when he takes aggressive, normal and conservative actions, the resulting complete portfolios are displayed at the bottom lines of Tables 5.1,5.2, and 5.3, respectively. As it is shown, the complete portfolio for the aggressive action is composed of 28.6% large-cap stocks, 26.6% small-cap stocks, 14.8% long-term corporate bonds, 0.9% Treasury bills, and 29.1% real estate. The complete portfolio for the normal action is composed of 28.2% large-cap stocks, 16.4% small-cap stocks, 17.7% long-term coiporate bonds, 4.0% Treasury bills, and 33.7% real estate. The complete portfolio for the conservation action is composed of 23.2% large-cap stocks, 8.1% small-cap stocks, 28.3% long-term corporate bonds, 0.1% long-term government bonds, 7.5% Treasury bills, and 32.8% real estate. Real estate makes up one of the major components in each case because it performs superior in terms of most of the objectives except the income and liquidity objectives. The investor's low liquidity requirement also contributes to the results. The results also indicate that the complete portfolio tends to smooth the extreme large and extreme small weights of individual assets in local optiihal portfolios. Therefore, it can be expected that the complete portfolio is less sensitive to input arors from individual local portfolios.

The complete portfolio obtained may not be optimal in terms of each individual objective. The associated efficient portfolios for the complete portfolios in terms o f each objective are summarized in Table 5.5. They are minimum variance portfolios with the same expected returns as the complete portfolio in terms of each objective. They are obtained by solving Model 4.1 with given expected returns. GAMS programs are written to perform these tasks, as given in Appendices 1.6,2.6,3.6,4.6,5.6, and 6.6. For example, the expected return of the normal action portfolio in terms of the total nominal return objective is 9.94% (see Table 5.4). With expected return of 9.94%, the standard deviation of the efficient portfolio in terms of the total nominal objective is 12.39% (dehoted as o* in Table 5.5), which is slightly less dian that of the complete portfolio, 12.53% (see Table 5.4). Note that an efficient portfolio that is "efficient" in all dimensions may not actually exist at all. Therefore, the efficient portfolios in Table 5.5 are the hypothetical combination of six portfolios, each of them is efficient for its associated objective only. The weighted returns,
70

shown at the bottom line of Table 5.4 and Table 5.5, are the weighted average returns for six objectives. They can be used to evaluate the overall aggressiveness of a portfolio in terms of overall investment objectives. Table 5.5: Associated efiBcient portfolios of complete portfolios

5.3 Measurement of Portfolio Efficiency A deviation index, DI, is used to measure the overall inefficiency of a complete portfolio. DI is defined as the sum of weighted relative deviations of portfolio standard deviations firom efficient portfolios in terms of all objectives. The formula of deviation index is written as; £T. - < 7 * . ·>..^ xlOO%

DI = ÿ w ,

(5.3.1)

where £>/= deviation index of the complete portfolio; wy= w e i^ t of objective oy= standard deviation of return of the complete portfolio in tarns of objective/, o/* = standard deviation of return of the efficient portfolio with the same expected return as the complete portfolio in terms of objective/; M = the number of objectives. The efficiency of the complete portfolio, E, can be written as. £ = 1 0 0 % - jD/, (5.3.2) Using formulae (5.3.1) and (53.2), the deviation index and efficiency for each of the three ; t · ' ' 71

complete portfolios can be calculated. The values of a,-and q,* are taken from Tables 5.4 and 5.5, respectively. The results are shown in Table 5.6.

Tradeoffs and priorities of these objectives are considered. Therefore, although the suitability of a portfolio is largely subjective, a portfolio constructed using our proposed method can be considered more suitable than the one obtained by using a single objective optimization method, which only considers the returns and risks according to one objective. As stated in Section 2.4, an optimal portfolio in terms of one objective may not also be optimal in terms of other objectives. Here the overall efficiency of the complete portfolios constructed using the proposed method is compared with those obtained using single-objective optimization. For the hypothetical investor, the weight of the after-tax return (ATR) objective dominates other objectives. Therefore three local optimal portfolios in terms of the after-tax return objective are used for comparisons. These three portfolios are obtained when the hypothetical investor takes aggressive, normal and conservative actions, respectively. The proportions of these three portfolios invested in each asset class are shown in Tables 5.1,5.2, and 5.3 respectively, under the after-tax return objective. For example, from Table 5.2, when the hypothetical investor takes a normal action, the local optimal portfolio for the after-tax return objective consists of 33.6% large-cap stocks, 72

19.3% small-cap stocks and 47.1% real estates. The performances of this portfolio in terms of each of the six objectives can be obtained by using formulaè (5.2.1) and (5.2.2). Revised GAMS programs shown in Appendices 1.5,2.5, 3.5,4.5, 5.5 and 6.5 are used to perform the calculations, replacing the set of parameters x(i) with {0.336,0.193,0,0,0,0.471}. For the aggressive and conservative actions, the sets of parameters x(i) are replaced, with (0.304,0.333,0,0, 0,0.363} and (0.290,0.085,0.148,0,0,0.477}, taken from Tables 5.1 and 5.3 for after-tax return objective respectively. The results are summarized in Table 5.7. Their associated efficient portfolios are summarized in Table 5.8, which are obtained by solving Model 4.1 for each given expected return in terms of each objective. GAMS programs given in Appendices 1.6, 2.6, 3.6, 4.6, 5.6 and 6.6 are used to perform these calculations.

The deviation index and efficiency of the three portfolios are obtained using formulae (5.3.1) and (5.3.2). The results are shown in Table 5.9. Table 5.9 also indicates that, when a

portfolio becomes more aggressive, it has a larger weighted deviation from efiBcient portfolios, and the efiSciency of the portfolio decreases. Comparisons between Tables 5.6 and 5.9 indicate in all three cases, the efficiencies of portfolios obtained from our proposed multiple objective method are higher than those of portfolios obtained by vising after-tax return objective optimization. The overall efficiency of the complete portfolios in terms of all investment objectives is improved.

Chapter 6: Conclusions and Fiiliife Work
6.1 Summary of Contributions The main contributions of this project rqjort are as follows: (1) An asset allocation model that is consistent with an individual investor's multiple investment objectives and preferences is developed. The concept of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed to construct the multiple objective decision model, while traditional portfolio optimization techniques are integrated into the hierarchy. Both of the suitability and efficiency of the complete portfolio are considered. In . comparison with single-objective optimization, improved overall efficiency in terms of all objectives is achieved. The complete portfolio constructed is less sensitive to input errors from individual optimization models. ·(2) A method to measure an individual investor's risk tolerance is proposed. In this method, risk tolerance is defined as the ratio of added portfolio variances to added portfolio returns, considering the investor's relative degree of preference between two reference portfolios. The investor selects his own reference portfolios from a list of candidates provided by the financial advisor. The relative degree of preference is estimated by the AHP technique. Risk tolerance measured using the proposed method can be incorporated into a quadratic programming model to determine a local optimal portfolio. (3) An interactive procedure based on the proposed model is suggested to implement the asset allocation process involving a financial advisor and an individual investor. Five sample questionnaires are designed for the following tasks: (i) to gather information about an investor's investment objectives and general risk profile; (ii) to assess an investor's preference over different investment objectives; (iii) to select aggressive and conservative reference portfolios; and (iv) to assess an investor's preference over the reference portfolios. (4) Computer programs are developed to perform the following tasks: (i) to find the global 75

minimum variance portfolios; (ii) to find the maximum return portfolios; and (iii) to generate the lists of aggressive and conservative reference portfolios. 36 sample programs are written for a hypothetical asset allocation example with jsix investment objectives and six asset classes. These programs can be generalized to solve mean-variance portfolio optimization models with N numbers of asset classes. (5) Two sample spreadsheet models based on the AHP technique are designed to perform priority analysis and to perform consistency tests for an investor's responses. 6.2 Future Work By utilizing the AHP method, die proposed method provides a mechanism to integrate portfolio optimization methods into a single asset allocation decision model. However, only classical mean-variance optimization techniques are employed in the hypothetical investment example in this project report No extra efforts are made to include other alternative portfolio optimization models. Considering only the variance as the portfolio risk surely cannot explain many investors' investment behaviors. One direction of future work is to consider various risk measurements according to an investor's risk attitude. For example, if an investor believes the downside variance, a measure of portfolio variability below the expected return, is a more appropriate portfolio risk measure in terms of current income objective, then mean-semivariance optimization methods can be used to obtain the local optimal portfolio in terms of the current income objective, while other local optimal portfolios maybe determined by using other appropriate optimization techniques. The quadratic programming models adopted in this report are based on the classical Markowitz models, which consider only the budget constrmnts and nonnegative weights of assets. No additional constraints, such as transaction costs and minimum transaction unit requirements, are considered. Ignoring these constraints is largely based on the consideration that general solution techniques are not available at present for specially structured portfolio problems. However, including these constraints to a model represent more realistic investment situations in real world. Tlierefore, the proposed model v/ould benefit fi' om the continuing research of portfolio optimization techniques.
