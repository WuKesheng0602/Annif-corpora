ABSTRACT

The dclcrioralion o f concrete can be due to; ( 1) the corrosion o f reinforcem ent: (2 ) freezing and thawing, including frost damage; (3) chloride ingress: (4) carbonation o f concrete;(5) sulphate attack: (6) acid attack: (7) alkali attack: (8) alkali - aggregate reaction: (9) salt attack: and (10) abrasion. Investigation o f the d ura b ility o l'co ncrete generally consists o f either the causes o f deterioration or the extent o f it. Usually, methods used to im prove the d urab ility o f concrete aim to prevent the causes o f deterioration: however, occasionally methods that lim it the extent o f damage are employed. In this context, and in order to propose test, w hich can assess the d u ra b ility between the material properties and deterioration mechanisms, is carried out. Such an analysis should help to focus the attention o f various investigators the key issues that u ltim ately determine the d urability o f concrete structures.

Concerning the various deterioration mechanisms described above, one o f the fundamental properties that influences the in itia tion and extent o f damage o f concrete is corrosion o f reinforcement in the concrete structure. Environmental effects such as the freezing and thaw ing cycles have caused deterioration o f the bridge decks and all other exposed reinforced concrete structures. Concrete is fu ll o f m icrocracks even when it is not loaded. When under vehicular tra ffic, some structural cracks form that can jo in the other already existing cracks, p ro viding an easy route to re in forcing steel lo r the deicing salt. The presence o f shrinkage and temperature cracks can also do the same. When chloride ions along w ith moisture reach the level o f re inforcing steel, they .start corroding the steel reinforcement. Corrosion o f steel reinforcement in concrete bridge decks and parking

structures is one o f the most common types o f deterioration, w hich has substantially reduced the useful life o f such facilities. This widespread problem and the rapidly

increasing cost o f maintenance and repair have resulted in great economic and social repercussions. The rising rate ol the use o f chloride deicing salt is a m ajor lactor causing corrosion, and tiiere is no leasiblc economic alternative to its use at present.

Corrosion may occupy a greater volum e than the parent steel reinforcem ent, thereby extending pressure on the upper concrete, causing it to spall o ff the main body o f concrete. Common types of deterioration and corrosion mechanisms of

reinforcem ent in concrete are reviewed w ith the view o f efleets o f the concrete environm ent on the process. It is feasible to study the effect o f the in d iv id u a l and combined causes on the onset and rate o f reinforcem ent corrosion.

The role o f concrete design and construction practices is discussed as the first protection resort available against corrosion. The importance o f concrete q u a lity in pro viding concrete, protection w hich may to reinforcement cannot be overemphasized. happen during construction, can result in Bleeding o f unfavorable

consequences and lead to unfavorable consequences and also to premature corrosion o f steel.

1. INTRODUCTION

D c ic in g .salts arc used increasingly on roads and c.xprcssways to m elt the snow and ice and to pro\ ide traction. T lic rate o f use o f d cicin g salt lias been on the increase in the past few years. M a n y studies have reported that the use o f deicing salt is linked to the increasing deterioration ol' bridge deck and parking structures due to corrosion o f reint'oreement and other deterioration mechanisms.

The concrete cover usually provides adequate corrosion protection to the steel reinlbrcem ent. M ost metals form a natural protective film on their surface after being exposed to a ir for a period o f tim e. In a sense this is corrosion, but once formed it prevents fu rth e r corrosion as long as the Him remains intact. A tig h tly adhering Him that passivates the steel and protects it from corrosion is usually form ed as a result o f the high alkaline environm ent in concrete. Furtherm ore, using a low water/cement ratio together w ith good q u a lity w orkm anship leads to lo w -p e rm e a bility concrete, w hich can m in im i/.c the ingress o f m oisture and a ir that can cause corrosion a fter the protective barrier is damaged o r lost.

C h lo rid e can be bound by the concrete, chem ically (b y alum inales in the concrete) and p h ysica lly (by adsorption on the pore w alls), the extent o f b in din g and its eli'ectivencss is not w e ll understood. H owever, it is know n that a reduction in pi 1 as caused by carbonation w ill break dow n the chloralum inates. I'his leads to a 'w a v e ' o f chlorides m o vin g in front o f the carbonation front. Consequently, structures w ith

chlorides in them that carbonate are more susceptible to corrosion than those w ith only one o f these com pounds [5 9 j.

Iiikcn fo r dcjinssivalion to occur depends on the crack widths: however, the times involved are neuiigible compared to the lile tin ie o rre in lb rce d concrete structure.

C orrosion in metals is caused by the Ilow o i'e le ctricity I'rom one metal to another or I'rom one part o f the suri'ace o f a metal to another where conditions permit the ilow o f electricity. This Ilo w o f energy can take place only w ith a moist conductor; i.e.. an electrolyte must be present. Therefore, i f corrosion is to take place in a metal there must be an electrolyte, an area or region o f the m etallic surface with a n e g a li\e charge in relation to a second area having a positive in opposition to the llrs l area. This Ilo w o f energy need not take place w ith in one piece o f metal. It may Ilow between a metal and some kind o f metal recipient, such as the soil or concrete, or it could take place between two d issim ilar metals. I f the soil is electrically negative relative to the metal and an electrolyte such as water or moisture is present, corrosion o f metal w ill result.

There are four substances or materials prerequisite to the electrochemical reactions required for corrosion to take place in a reinforced concrete structure; A n anode; an electrode by which the ions go into solution and electrons are released: A cathode: an electrode by which the electrons are consumed in the presence o f water and o.xygen: A c o n d u c to r: the steel itself, which permits the transfer o f electrons from the anodes to the cathode; and An e le ctro lyte : moist concrete, which permits the movement o f ions between the cathode and anode through the pores containing moisture.

The h ydroxyl ions produced due to the cathodic reaction combine w ith the ferrous ions at the anode to form ferrous hydroxide, and oxidation eonverts it into insoluble hydrous ferric oxide or rust. F c -^ F c -^ +2c (1-1)

The fin a l product is the fa m ilia r rust. The electrical resistivity o f concrete is increased by the low perm eability o f the concrete, w hich impedes the electrical current Ilo w . Corrosion o f steel occurs in all structures although to a very lo w and im perceptible level in many structures. However, corrosion o f steel can occur i f concrete is not o f good quality, i f the design and construction aspects were not properly coordinated for the service environm ent, or i f the services environm ent was changed after construction [ IJ.

C orrosion o f steel in conciete has received renewed interest in the last three decades because o f the rapid deterioration caused in certain types o f structures and the increasing cost o f repair and maintenance 11]. The consequences o f corrosion o f

embedded reinforcem ent bars in concrete were experienced earlier in o ff- shore and coastal structures and in chemical factories. Usually it occurs in bridges, parking garage structures and in some structures that are exposed to an aggressive environm ent 11 j.

There are five main sources o f trouble in the deterioration o f parking structures and bridge decks; the corrosive effects o f deicing salts: defective expansion jo in ts: structural movement due to the effects o f temperature and h um idity: im properly protected hardware (embedded parts, etc.); and attack due to effects o f the fre e/in g -tha w ing eycle.

The effects o f deicing salts on reinforcing steel, particularly in the upper portions ol unsealed slabs, are a m ajor cause o f damage. The salt water enters the decks either rapidly through the cracks or it slo w ly permeates the sound concrete; chlorides damage the passive protective layer on the steel reinforcement. It is carbonation that lowers pi 1 o f the concrete.

M acroeells start to form on the reinforcing bars once there is a difl'crence in the electropotential as a result o f inhomogeneities in the hardened cement paste along the surface o f rebars, fhe electropotential differences can arise I'rom many causes such as the gradient in chloride ion content, freezing-thaw ing cycles, carbonation o f port Iand cement paste, cracks in the concrete. slra\ currents. gaKanic effects due to local differences in the properties o f concrete, or exposure conditions 111 . Construction practices also play an im portant role in the development and propagation o f steel corrosion. One o f the most im portant factors is crack form ation in the hardened concrete due to subsidence o f concrete during the bleeding process, as w ill be discussed later. The concrete m ixture details and depth o f the protective concrete cover particularly a fleet the capacity and rate o f corrosion o f reinforcem ent bars 11 ].

The transformation o f m etallic iron into rust results in an increase in the \o lu m e and process o f the form ation o f rust, the pressure exerted on the surrounding concrete, the pressure exerted can greatly exceed the a b ility o f even the strongest concrete to resist the resulting tensile stresses. As a result, the concrete cracks, and i f the corrosion continues, it can spall o f f [ I j . It is a fact that corrosion causes loss o f bond strength between the steel and concrete, but others have pointed out that frictio n and adhesion between concrete and steel are generally reduced by the absence o f a rusty surface |5 j. In structures containing high-strength prestressing steel, the reduction in steel cross-section area is o f great interest because b rittle failure may be induced because o f a sm all amount o f steel loss caused by corrosion. A very localized anodic process may lead to cracking due to high permanent stresses, i f the steel is sensitive to this type o f failure. D uring the crack propagation stage, the anodic process occurs at the root o f the crack. I'his type o f brittle cracking is called stress corrosion cracking (SCC) [5 |.

The second type o f b rittle failure is a consequence o f the cathodic process, binder certain conditions, atom ic hydrogen is developed during the cathodic process as an intermediate product, and it may penetrate into the steel. The recom bination to m olecular

The quality o f concrete is by far the most important i'actor in providing protection against corrosion o f steel, lim itin g the intrusion o f chloride ions in reinforced eoncrete. O ther preventive measures in use include the application o f p ro te cti\e coating on reinforcem ent in new construction, the use o f corrosion protection in bridge decks and parking structures j 1]. inhibitors, and cathodic

Scope
Reinforced concrete is a re la tively new construction material, developed and

applied extensively o n ly in the 20th century. When it tlrsl appeared, reinforced concrete was regarded as an a rtific ia l stone that neither rusted like steel nor rotted or burned like w ood and lasted long. It has always been stated that the com bination o f concrete and re in fo rcin g steel is an optim al one not only because o f mechanical performance but also fro m the point o f v ie w o f long-term performance, fhe earlier decades ol plain and reinforced concrete structures, however, revealed complex interaction between reinforced concrete and its environment.

The

20th century

became a part o f history,

leaving

a legacy o i' many

accom plishm ents as w e ll as disappointments. N o w is an appropriate tim e to look into the futu re and learn from the past. Due to heightened public awareness o f energy, resources and ecological issues, and b illio n s o f dollars spent every year on bridge and parking structure maintenance and rehabilitation, the problem o f infrastructure deterioration needs ureater attention and must be tackled w ith care. tr

Considerable research has been carried out in the technology sector related to the achievem ent o f durable bridge decks and parking structures and to ide ntify the most suitable solutions, w hich could be developed further into realistic programs for

re h ab ilita tio n o f existing structures. The problem o f corrosion prevention and control is best solved p rio r to and during the design stage. In order to make basic design decisions.

it is necessary to understand the mechanism o f corrosion. Because o f the efforts o f lesearchers around the w orld, new data are continually being made available and may help future construction in the way some aspects o f the corrosion problems and their solutions are viewed.

M any factors inlluencc corrosion mechanisms in reinforcing steel embedded in concrete and its rehabilitation; and protection o f bridge decks, parking and other structures exposed to aggressive corrosion environments. There is much concern across Canada. United Slates, the M id d le East and around the w orld regarding the problen, o f deterioration o f such structures, and the causes, prevention, and speciilc measures that can be taken.

The purpose o f this study is to provide a summary o f the principles o f corrosion, various methods o f investigation and rehabilitation o f corrosion, assessing deteriorated structures, construction practices, and concrete quality. The projects also discuss a case study o f the rehabilitation o f 19th Avenue Bridge, in M arkham , O ntario. In this bridge the deck and beam so flits o f the bridge structure were severely deteriorated due to corrosion o f the reinforcing steel, spalling and the lack o f proper gradient in bridge decks. The bridge was o rig in a lly b u ilt in 1928 and partly rehabilitated in 1957. when o nly the deck was replaced.

('om nion Exposure Conditions The most serious problem in cone re te teehnology today is the premature

deterioration o f concrete structures that are subjected to liarsh environments. I here is o verw helm ing evidence from field e.xperienee that many o f the d u ra b ility problems, such as sulphate attack, reinforcem ent corrosion, carbonation, and a lka ii-silica reaction in concrete w ould not have occurred i f the concrete had been made impermeable at the time ol'exposure to the environm ent and during the intended service iil'e |4 |.

The durability-related issue in selecting must be addressed in selecting materials, aggregate m ix proportions, and construction practices using concrete, fhe industry must develop new, comprehensive models o f concrete deterioration and the quantification o f environm ental inHuenceson the perm eability o f concrete.

Concrete bridge decks and parking structures typ ic a lly have a concrete deck, reinforced w ith steel bars, post or pre-tensioning tendons, w h ich serve as the finished wearing surface and resist the abrasion o f tires on surfaces. Some o f these decks are exposed to rain and snow, and others are subjected indirectly to moisture carried on the undersides o f cars. M oisture may also be associated w ith deck cleaning and maintenance l etivities. D eicing salts are also brought on the undersides o f cars or are applied directly to the deck to m elt ice and snow for im proved traction. V irtu a lly all deicing salts used in current road and highw ay maintenance contain chlorides |n |. Exposure to and effects o f chlorides may worsen when the water stands on the deck surface. In offshore and marine areas, salty sand, salt-water spray, seawater, and prevalent high moisture conditions can also lead to serious corrosion problems.

The temperature o f these structures follo w s seasonal and daily temperature cycles, although a temperature lag always occurs in the materials. Differences in temperature

Such changes are frequently sm aller in the plan dimensions and exist in an environm ent w ith more constant temperature, h um idity, and moisture. Restraint o f volum e change can cause cracking o f decks and flo or slabs, beams and colum ns, w h ich , i f unprotected, may a llo w rapid ingress o f water and chlorides leading eventually to deterioration |4 |. When deicing salts are used, some o f these salts become absorbed by the cover o f the concrete. Under severe w etting, d ryin g, freezing and thaw ing cycles, these produce high osm otic and hydraulic pressures w ith a consequent movement o f water tow ard the coldest zone where freezing takes place. Damage w ill occur when the resulting tensile strain exceeds the tensile strain capacity o f the concrete, w hich varies w ith the age o f the concrete and the rate o f application o f strain. The extent o f damage varies from surface scaling to com plete disintegration as the layers o f ice arc form ed, starting at the exposed surface o f the concrete and progressing through its depth |5 |.

mechanisms by w h ich this strain may be generated w ith in the concrete, such as d ry in g shrinkage, expansion o r contraction due to temperature change, and plastic o r therm al shrinkage.

C racking may also occur in the concrete from any num ber o f causes. I'hese causes can usually be classified in three m ajor groups: ( I ) corrosion-induced cracking; (2) volum e changes due to temperature change, and h um idity change; and (3) structural cracking due to abrupt change in the geometry, members alignm ent. Structural loading, as a single standard o f judgem ent o f a cause o f cracking, appears to be blamed too often.

Diagonal tension and anchorage bond cracking n o rm a lly occur o n l\ at high load levels, and were once considered relatively unim portant, but there h a \c been several reported la ilures. i f diagonal tension or anchorage bond cracking docs occur, most often it docs not contribute to the cracking on the concrete cover surface. I 'lexural cracking is o f most concern when it occurs from negative bending moments in the decks, joists, beams, and girders reinforced w ith deformed bars o nly |4 |. C racking can occur from tension induced by the expansion o f the products o f corrosion fo rm in g around the steel reinforcem ent. I'hese cracks are often associated w ith delam ination and spalling o f the concrete [4].

A b ru p t changes o f geometry, such as the depth or the cross-sectional area, cause d iffe re n tia l plastic settlement leading to cracking, or induce local stress concentrations w h ich sooner o r later may create cracks, e.g.. ribbed slabs, trough sections, w a file slabs or voided slabs.

D ry in g shrinkage and decrease in temperature com bine to produce a shortening o f the concrete. When this volum e change is restrained by other parts o f the structure, cracks can form . T lie like lih o o d o f crack form ation from volum e change is enhanced by the presence o f geom etrical d isco ntin u ity, such as construction discontinuities (construction jo in ts ), co ntro l jo in ts , isolation jo in ts (expansion jo in ts ) and the tensile stress already e xistin g fro m bending moments. Cracks that occur in the surface o f fresh concrete soon a fter being placed and w h ile it is s till plastic are called plastic cracking. Plastic cracking may also develop under certain conditions during construction i f evaporation o f water from the surface exceeds the bleeding rate o f the water from the m oist concrete, fhe co n tro l o f plastic cracking is provided by adjusting the concrete m ix or construction means and methods in clu ding curing.

It provides d ire ct access fo r w ater where negative m om ent cracks in continuous T-beam extend through the entire slab thickness as shown schem atically in Figure 2.1. T w o basic approaches to the design o f slab systems are used: (1) sim ple span systems (u sually w ith precast o r precast prestressed components), or (2) continuous span system (u su ally castin-place construction w ith re in fo rcin g bars o r past tensioning reinforcem ent).

A schematic draw ing o f the type o f cracking and defo rm a tio n expected in sim ple span Hexural members is shown in Figure 2.3 and 2.4. A m a jo r advantage is that rotation at the ends o f members can cause re la tive ly w ide cracks over the supports.

W hen such fractures reach ihe surface, they a llo w the concrete to break away, le aving an open spall o r pothole.

2.2.2.Z M echanism o f Spaiiing O ver a given reinlbrcem cnt har. I'resh concrete has a tendenev to segregate, and the particles, o l various sizes, tend to How to one side or the other o f the har. Plastic shrinkage, d ry in g shrinkage, and thermal stresses find re lie f in this area by causing a crack, p a rticu la rly i f the steel is close to the surface and especially i f the concrete is \e ry w et and thus subject to considerable shrinkage. This crack over the top re in fo rc in g har. w h ich is usually transverse to the traveled roadway, is very com m on in bridge decks. Salt-laden w ater can ingress through cracks and permeate through the uncracked concrete. Bleed water that is trapped under a surface crust creates planes o f weakness that may cause early spaiiing [8].

D ifle re n t concentrations o f salt or m oisture are sulTicient to set up anodic and cathodic areas in a galvanic electrochem ical cell and eventually cause a 1 1o w o f corrosion current. Salt in solution provides an electrolyte, and oxygen in the w ater provides the o x id iz in g agent. The ferrous ions are later precipitated into rust on the anode. When the cracks f ill w ith water and freezing occurs, even greater pressures arc exerted. Passing tra ffic can create sig n ifican t compressive stresses caused m a in ly by lle xu re . thereby in d u cin g stress reversal and fatigue characteristics, w ith the result that the entire cover can be lost fro m this repeated a ctivity [8 ]. f igure 2.9 shows d iffe re n t factors causing s p a iiin g d u rin g and after construction.

Scaling

2.2.3.1 Phenomenon of Scaling Concrete sealing is a deterioration mechanism, the result o f attacks on the mortar fraction o f the concrete m ix. It is characterized in itia lly as a m inor tlaking and disintegration o f the concrete surface. W ith passing time it progresses deeper into the concrete, eventually exposing aggregate, w hich breaks away. This contributes lurther to the process by exposing more paste to the elements. In extreme cases, apparently sound concrete can be reduced to gravel in a relatively short period o f time |7|.

Scaling can also be caused by freezc-thaw action in the absences o f deicers. It can also be caused by chlorides w ithout freezing. But scaling is especially severe when coitcrete is subject to freeze-thawing action in the presence o f deicers. Scaling can be m arkedly reduced by air entrainment. It also can be s ig n illca n tly reduced by linseed oil treatment. But scaling can be virtu a lly elim inated by the proper use o f air entrainment in addition to linseed o il treatment where applicable. Scaling increases in concrete w ith a high water/cement ratio, but it is not related to spaiiing or deep cracking |8 |.

2.2.3.2 Mechanism of Scaling When fresh concrete hardens, capillary pores are caused by the dissipation o f water in the hydration reactions and by evaporating water. When water in a saturated cavity freezes, either the volume must expand (by 9%). or the excess water must be forced out o f the ca vity or the pore. In any system o f voids, moisture tends to move from the larger voids to the sm aller ones. Since the entrained air voids are far larger than the capillary voids, they remain essentially free o f moisture. I hey are available as points o f pressure relief. A fte r thawing, the moisture is drawn from tlie entrained a ir \o id s to the ca pilla ry cavities by capillary action. I f enough unfilled entrained air \o id s are present, disruptive hydraulic pressures w ill not develop. A lo w water/cement ratio paste w ill have smaller and few er potentially vulnerable capillary cavities and w ill therefore be more resistant to frost action [10].

iMacing sail on pavements for iee removal w ill increase llie eoneenlralion o l' sail in the capillary voids near the surface o f the pavement. As the salt solution free/es. a greater concentration o f salt results and osmotic pressure is built up in the capillary ea\ ilies. This increase o f pressure may be sul'tlcient to cause a rupture o f the cement gel near the surface o f the deck and consequently cause scaling.

D eicing salt not only creates additional forces through osmosis, but also pro\ ides an additional source o f surface moisture in freezing weather by m elting the ice and snow. As deicing salt melts snow and ice, the temperature im m ediately below the surface is reduced sig n ifican tly because o f the comparatively large heal o f fusion o f ice. This may cause a damaging temperature drop in the saturated zone im m ediately beneath the surface
[ 101.

2.2.4 Joint Deterioration 1he tw o most common provisions made for p roviding crack control, o r re lie f o f restraint in concrete slabs, are control jo in ts and expansion jo in ts. Such jo in ts ha\ e long been a source o f maintenance problems. Joints on supported slabs must be sealed against water leakage and intrusion. Both situations are damaging to the jo in ts system e.g.. repeated water pounding stained the concrete surface, and can cause the spaiiing. w hich later transform in to the steel reinforcem ent corrosion.

Construction jo in ts deteriorate fo r several reasons usually associated w ith the failure o f the sealant or failure o f the adjacent concrete e.g., incom patible sealant material, w rong alignm ent o f jo in ts , and im proper installation. Joint sealant may not have the required degree o f lle x ib ility . bond strength, or durability for a particular application. I f concrete adjacent to the jo in t is not su fllcie n tly durable, then local scaling w ill cause jo in t sealant failure.

In general practice, this may happen in the area o f weak point o f the structure (e.g.. leaky construction jo in ts and wide cracks), in com bination w ith poor concrete quality (g ra \e l pockets, high w/c ratio). I f the pi I o f concrete drops below 9 at reinforcement, or i f the chloride content exceeds a critical value, the passi\e film and the corrosion protection w ill be lost. Corrosion o f reinforcement is possible i f su fllcie n t moisture and oxygen are available. This can be assumed to be the ease for most structures in the open air. The principles o f passi\ation and depassi\ation hold true for both normal reinforcing and for prestressing steel [5. 22|.

A ll deterioration processes require water; 1ho im portant laetor is the moisture state in the concrete rallier than that ol the surrounding atm ospiicrc. (In d c r steady conditions, these w ill he constant, but under varying conditions concrete takes water from the cnt ironm cnt more rapidly than it loses and so the internal average h um idity lends to be higher than the average ambient hum idity. 'Ih e a va ila b ility o l o.xygen (dissolved) in chloride-elTected concrete is one ok the main factors that encourage the corrosion o l's te e l. Figure 3.1 shows that the rate o f oxygen d illtis io n through watersaturated concrete depends on the thickness and quality o f concrete | I3 |. as cited in 11J. O xygen d iffu s io n in concrete takes place m ainly through the ca pilla ry pores, damaged areas and m icrocracks. Therefore the rate o f oxygen diffu sio n through concrete is also sig n ific a n tly affected by the degree o f saturation o f concrete w ith water | l | . Ihe

prin cip le also holds true where members arc subject to w etting and d ry in g cycles: frequent w etting, as in ideal regions, can maintain concrete in saturated co ndition. 114].

Corrosion increases as the sodium chloride concentration is increased until a m axim um \a ltie is reached. Beyond this, the rate o f corrosion decreased despite the increase ch lo rid e ion concentration. This change in relationship between corrosion tind sodium ch loride concentration is attributed to the reduced .solubility and d ilT u s iv iiy o f oxygen, and therefore, affects the a vailab ility o f oxygen to sustain the corrosion process. 1his process describes corrosion in a salt solution: however, the av a ila b ility o f oxygen in wet concrete may be different.

There are three theories used currently to describe the role o f ch lo rid e ions in the corrosion process: (a) The oxide film theory. In this theory, it is believed that an oxide Him on the steel bar surface provides the passivity and thus protection against corrosion. The chloride ions are believed to penetrate the oxide film on steel through pores or deleets in the o xide Him in a way easier than other harm ful ions. In an alternative way, the oxide film may be e ollo id a lly dispersed by the chloride ions, thus fa c ilita tin g the penetration and ingress o f chlorides. (b) The adsorption theory. In this theory, it is believed the steel surface adsorbs

chlorides, oxygen and h ydroxyl ions. The iron ions are dissolved due to hydration o f metal ions aggravated by chloride ions. (c) The transitory com plex theory. This theory postulate lhat a soluble com plex o f iron ch lo rid e is form ed 11j, as cited in 111, in a com petition between ch lo rid e ions and h y d ro x y l ions to react w ith the ferrous ions. This reaction takes place at the anode where

iho soluble com plex ol iron chloride diffuses avvuy from the parent m etal, thus destroying the protective ferrous oxide layer and prom oting the process o f corrosion, t his com plex is dissoK cd again and breaks down at some distance from the electrode. Iron hydroxide is precipitated, and the chloride ion is Iree again to start a s im ila r cycle o r reaction, p e rm ittin g corrosion o f the anode to continue. In a sample o f broken concrete w ith active corrosion, a lig h t green sem isolid reaction product is usually found close to the steel surface, w h ich turns to black when exposed to a ir and lln a lly the usual rust c o lo r is o h se r\cd ( I ].

M o re ferrous ions are transported away from the anode and react w ith oxygen when available to form higher oxides. The corrosion process is not stille d and continues as long as all the reaction components are available. The product o f corrosion is many tim es greater than the volum e o f the o rig in al ingredients. W hen iron oxides are

transform ed to higher o xidation states, they expand and produce internal pressure. When the tensile stresses due to internal pressure exceed the concrete tensile strength, cracking occurs. It is belicwed also that the form ation o f iron ch lo rid e com plexes may also promote and increase the internal pressure [IJ .

It has been mentioned that steel become passive in calcium h ydroxid e solution due to the form ation o f an im pervious layer o f ferric products on the steel surface. I f for some reason the h ydroxyl ion concentration is reduced, the protective layer w ould be disrupted and corrosion w ould proceed. Shalon and Rapheel |211 found that the m in im u m pi I fo r in h ib itio n o f steel corrosion varies from I 1.5 to i 2.75. depending on the nature o f the corrosion and the degree o f aeration.

A severe consequence o f carbonation is the reduction o f a lka lin ity to the extent that the passivity o f embedded steel is affected. For high-quality concrete, carbonation is n orm a lly not a problem unless concrete has cracked. Localized corrosion o f the

reinforcem ent in cracked concrete may be accelerated due to carbonation. In addition to th e ir electrochem ical influence on the in itia tio n and rate o f corrosion, chlorides also can cause physical damage to the concrete surface. This is due in effect to "thermal shock" resulting from accelerated freeze-thaw cycles. Progressive surface spaiiing can occur, reducing or e lim ina tin g co\ er to steel reinforcement.

On the other hand, some degree o f autogenous healing can take place in the presence o f m oisture and carbon dioxide in the cracked concrete |2 4 |.

4. CONCRETE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PRACTICE

4.1

Structure o f Concrete and Permeability The risk o f corrosion o f reinforcing slcci should be m inim al in a w ell designed

reinforced concrete structure containing a sufficient depth o f good q u a lity concrete cover that has been properly placed and compacted. The concrete cover provides both chem ical and physical barriers to corrosion [53].

The chemical barrier is the high a lka lin ity o f the concrete pore water solution, w hich o rd in a rily has a pH value o f about 13. This enables the form ation and maintenance o f permanent protective passivating film on the surface o f the steel. I'he physical barrier is the density and im perm eability o f the concrete cover, w hich lim its the d iffu s io n o f oxygen toward the steel and thus may block the corrosion reaction, even i f the passivating film has been, disrupted [57].

Heterogeneous chemical reaction between a liq u id and a solid or gaseous phase constitutes the basis o f concrete deterioration processes. 'I'he deterioration o f concrete

may be caused by either the aggressive environm ent to w hich the concrete is exposed or by internal causes w ith in the concrete composition itself. I'he extent o f damage produeed by external causes depends largely on the quality o f concrete. Perm eability is believed to be the most im portant property o f concrete that facilitates corrosion o f the reinforcem ent IIV . 30. and 31 j. Increased water/cement ratio produces a decrease in the gel/space ratio, thus increasing the volume and size o f large pores and therefore perm eability. H ig li perm eability concrete can become saturated w ith water relatively easier than concrete w ith lo w perm eability [5|. When concrete w ith high perm eability becomes saturated its electrical conductivity relatively increases. Also, the ingress o f chlorides, oxygen and carbon dioxide to the reinforcing steel w ill be relatively easier [26].

In an environm ent where the structure is exposed to chloride ions, the concrete should be made w ith the lowest water/cement ratio consistent w ith achieving m axim um consolidation and density. The effects o f water/cement ratio and degree o f consolidation on the rate o f ingress o f chloride ions are shown in I'igure 4.1 and 4.2 [32]. as cited in [ 11. I f macro cells, w h ich may cause rapid corrosive attack, on the steel bars in concrete, are established in response to inhomogeneities in the cement paste concrete, sail concentration, aeration, and perm e ab ility throughout, the concrete w ill set up electrochemical a ctivity [26].

A ir ICiiiraiiinicnl The aii'-enlrained eoncrele is considered one o f the m ajor successes in concrete

technology. I'iierc arc two dilTerenl types ol' deterioration due to internal cracking and surl'ace scaling, and I'rcc/.ing-thawing cycles. The main I'actor in tlu cncin g the frost resistance o f concrete, as shown by investigations over the last few decades, is the content o f a ir in the hardened concrete introduced as a result o f the foam ing effect o l'a ircntrainm cnt additives added to the concrete m ix. A t present the production o f concretes w ith high and guaranteed frost resistance is invariably ensured by using structureform ing. air-entraining or gas-iberating additives. The a ir entrains w o rk in hardened concrete like a rtillc ia lly generated porosity (spherical pores) fille d w ith air and separated by barriers o f hardened cement o f definite thickness. These spherical pores act lik e scaled a ir pores. In the process o f freezing and tha ving a ir pores are gradually and s lo w ly fille d w ith water, and it is im portant that the degree o f critica l water saturation is not attained in one w inter season.

In such cases, the in itia l state o f water saturation is restored in the sum m er period and the concrete reverts to the original phase condition o f the hardened cement, strength and frost resistance. However, there arc other im portant benefits o f entrained a ir in both freshly m ixed and hardened concrete [33 ]. Since, fo r good q u a lit\' concrete, the presence o f an adequate system o f entrained-air voids is the only basic requirement to provide space tor expansion o f pore water upon freezing due to freezing- thaw ing cycles, the basic frost d u ra b ilit) problem (excluding deicing salt scaling) I'he selection o f a specillcd air content fo r (5% - + - 1%) in the I'ormwork. the a ir - void spacing i'actor o f 0.2 mm and a specified surface o f 25mm '' represented the best practice In normal strength concretes, the data available indicate that the dosage o f the air-entraining agent is the most

As the data indicate, a re la liv c ly lo w dosage may be sulTtcient in certain cases, the lower required dosages ol air - entraining adm i.\ture (A H A ) typ ic a lly occurred w ith the higher dosages o f water reducing adm ixtures (W R A ).

4.1.2

W ater/C cm cn t Ratio As noted earlier, the designers always want to use higher strength concrete than in

the past, and this requires special attention and care to the m ixture proportions. The high strength concretes can be achieved by the use o f strong and good q u a lity crushed stone aggregate, h igher cementing material contents and a lo w e r water/cement m aterial ratio |5 7 |. The water/cement ratio also exerts a sig n ifican t inlluence on frost resistance. Concrete prepared from mixes o f various w o rka b ilitie s and compacted by d iffe re n t methods shows a direct correlation between water content and frost resistance, w hich also depends on the volum e o f hardened cement since destructive stresses arise in it.

The m ajor cause o f lo w water/cement ratio is not o nly the concrete strength, but also other im portant properties o f both freshly m ixed and hardened concrete. For hardened concrete, the gel/space ratio is increased w ith lo w water/cement ratio, thus increasing the concrete strength and im perm eability. In fresh concrete w ith lo w

water/cement ratio, bleeding is reduced, therefore increasing concrete im perm eability, fhe gel/space ratio is a function o f water/cement ratio and the degree o f hydration |57]. Using a water/cement ratio less than specified in the m ix design a llow s the gain o f high gel/space ratio at early ages or in cold weather [14]. The increase in strength o f concrete may extend the tim e before corrosion-induced stresses cause cracking o f the concrete.

The im portance o f im perm eability in p ro viding a protective environm ent against corrosion of reinforcem ent has been discussed in Section 4.1.1. fhe use of

supcrplasticizcrs to reduce the water/cement ratio is also ad\antageous in producing concrete w ith less segregation and bleeding. There is no direct in llu e nce .o f a

superplasticizcr on shrinkage and creep, but as it reduces the water/cem ent ratio, shrinkage and creep are in turn reduced [5].

4.2. 4.2.1

Bleeding Nature and Causes o f Bleeding Bleeding is a form of.segregation in w hich some o f liie m ix in g w ater tends to rise

to the top .surface o f freshly placed concrete d uring the consolidation process. It can be expressed quantitatively, as the total settlement o f freshly placed concrete is usually slight and w ould hardly be noticed, but the appearance o f the accumulated layer o f water on the surface is usually observable. The amount o f bleeding water lends to be proportional to the settlement o f solid constituents o f freshly placed concrete under g ra vity forces [9 ].

For concrete treated to retard the setting time, bleeding and settlement are terminated due to the higher specified surface area o f cement as a result o f the hydration process. When the setting tim e is re la tively shorter, bleeding and settlement arc arrested m echanically by brid ging the inter-particle gaps w ith hydration products f l l j . fhe

structure o f the hardened concrete is affected to a large degree by the in itia l framew ork o f the cement paste established at the time o f setting [I5 J. It should be m entioned here that the destruction o f fresh concrete structure early in a stage o f hardening does no harm to the concrete q u a lity. Concrete may be im proved by re vib ra tion as long as the m ixtu re can be com pletely reconsolidated [9 ].

Norm al bleeding is a characteristic o f the flocculent state o f the fresh concrete in w hich the in te rio r particle attraction forces are balanced. B leeding takes place due to establishment o f the flo cculatio n forces. Figure 4.3 indicates that the am ount o f bleeding increases p ro p o rtio n a lly w ith the increase o f the water/cement ratio o f the concrete m ix.

A t high specific surface area o f cement grains (fineness), the average distance between particles is sm aller w ith stronger cohesive forces, and a ccordingly normal bleeding w ill be lim ited [9 ]. N orm al bleeding is an indication that in ter-p article forces arc strong enough to achieve adequate cohesion to the cement paste; the presence o f channels is an evidence o f partial d isruption o f the paste m a trix | 9].

F a ctors yV ffccting lilc e d in g it w ould be expected that the amount o f bleeding water w o u ld be increased w ith

an increase in the ambient temperature. Powers [9 ] considered the bleeding to be a phenomenon o f llu id How through a permeable body and that the bleeding rate w ill increase w ith the decreased viscosity at high temperatures. H ow ever, an increase o f temperature can lead to less amount and rate o f bleeding, and even early term ination because o l'th c associated early setting o f the cement paste. In concrete bridge decks and slabs where there is more dissipation o f heat o f hydration, bleeding is usually completed before early setting o f concrete takes place. The e fleet o f temperature on bleeding is more pronounced by its in lluence on the tim e o f setting than on the \ iscosity o f w ater [9J.

The increased w ater content o f the concrete m ix w ill

increase bleeding as

described in the previous section. G rading o f aggregate lias no direct efleet on bleeding, but as it affects die required water content, a suitable grading can co ntribu te to a decrease in bleeding | H |.

I'hoso joints introduce discontinuities in bridge decks and parking structures that interrupt the m o n olith ic nature o f the concrete surlacc. Because it is desirable to m aintain a w atertight surface, frequently these joints are provided w ith seal element that provide the fundamental resistance to water penetration from the top o f the d riv in g surface at the jo in t [41-

Several approaches have been developed in an attempt to make com m only used structural system more watertight. W ith some structural systems, such as sim ple span ilo o r systems, rotation and displacement at supports can be anticipated. The construction can be made more watertight by p ro viding sealed jo in ts at these locations.

Sealed control jo in ts located continuously along the ends o f double lees as shown in Figure 4.9 have been used in many parking structures using precast, prestressed double lee construction w ith a east-in-place reinforced concrete topping: w ith this type o f construction, cracks akso tend to occur in the topping near or along the edges o f double tees where the flanges meet.

Scaled control jo in ts located as shown in Figure 4.9 have been used above the llange-to-llange connections in many parking structures o f this t\p e o f construetion.

Sealed jo in ts located as shown in Figure 4.9 have performed moderately w ell in preventing water leakage through the concrete topping when cracks occur in the joints and m ovem ent is restrained by appropriate reinforcem ent in the topping and connections between the abutting underlying precast members. When water penetrates through the top p in g concrete o r seal, corrosion o f embedded reinforcing, other metals, or connection can occur [4 j.

For other structural systems, consideration should be given to c o n tro llin g cracks w ith joints at lik e ly locations o f concentrated cracking or mo\'ement. The type and location o f Joints and detailing o f the ir seals are unique to each project and deserve special consideration in construction using precast concrete Ilo o r system elements.

Construction jo in ts are often sources o f leakage through slabs in

parking

structures. I f dciccrs are allowed to penetrate through these joints, they may lead to corrosion o f the reinforcem ent or other embedded metals. In the case o f unbonded post tensioning tendons, this has been observed to lead to corrosion o f the tendon and anchorage hardware in a zone where forces are transferred between the tendon, anchorage, and concrete [35,36.4]. Construction jo in ts required for intermediate stressing anchorage introduce further areas subjected to possible corrosion.

The surfaces o f jo in ts w hich either do not have laitance removed by sandblasting o r include other abrasive methods p rio r to the second casting w ill have an increased tendency to a llo w m oisture penetration compared to cases where laitance is removed and /o r more positive bonding at the jo in t is provided. Figure 4.10 shows a construction jo in t provided w ith a sealed groove to reduce water penetration, .loint fille rs, which absorb or retain m oisture at construction and isolation jo in ts , have been observed to accelerate the corrosion o f adjacent steel. Scaling due to c yclic freezing and thaw ing may also increase. T h is is associated w ith the constant supply o f retained moisture at absorptive fille r when the sealant has failed [4].

STRUCTURAL REPAIR AND PROTECTION MEASURES

5.1

G eneral The llr s l step in the process o f repair and rehabilitation is the assessment o f the structure to evaluate the fo llo w in g ; Causes o f corrosion o f steel; I'h e extent o f damage; The expected progress o f damage; and 1'he influence o f damage on the structural safety o f structure, and on its serviceability

On the basis o f the in itia l assessment, the optim al strategy for repair and rehabilitation should be chosen. The strategy adopted should also take into account econom ic aspects, w hich include not only the cost o f the repairs, but also the overall state o f the structure and the additional tim e period it is expected to sei-vc. F-'our strategies can be generally considered: (1 ) Replacement o r reconstruction o f the damaged components. (2) Extensive repair to restore the integrity o f the damaged components and prevent additional corrosion. (3) Local repairs at regular intervals, and continuous m onitoring o f the developm ent o f damage. (4) P rovision o f an alternative supporting structural system.

The firs t objective o f repair and protection o f existing concrete bridge decks and parking structures, among other types o f reinforced concrete structures, is the restoration o f structural integrity. The second objective is to restore the functional in te g rity in the most effective way [53]. I'h c cause o f steel corrosion must be first

preventing

water,

and

most

im p ortantly, chlorides from entering the concrete. Several measures are available to arrest, control, or m inim ize corrosion, which can be taken either singly or in com bination (371.

The repair options o f corrosion o f the reinforcement embedded in concrete is usually carried out and directed toward one or more o f the fo llo w in g attempts: 1. Sealing the concrete surface from the corrosive environm ent (m oisture/water, oxygen, and chloride salts). 2. C o n tro llin g and m o d ifying the ambient environm ent to provide protection, 3. C o n tro llin g the potential o f steel to reduce the current flo w and thereby the rate o f corrosion.

P roviding a membrane and scalers on the repaired concrete surface to lim it the m oisture content o f the concrete and membrane and sealers w ill produce an

im perm eable bam er between the concrete surface and a corrosive environm ent. Various coating systems have been used. The most common o f these is linseed o il and epoxy resins |2 6 j. In Ontario, laboratory and field investigation o f the use o f linseed concrete started in 1965. and it was found that air entrained concrete was not d iffe re n t in d u ra b ility from concrete treated w ith linseed o il. Presently emphasis is placed upon the use o f properly a ir entrained concrete [26].

The impermeable barrier may be a protective coating on the conerete surface, or an elastomeric membrane, or an integral part o f the concrete m atrix as polym er im pregnation, or it may be an overlay o f special concrete or interna lly sealed concrete

Il l -

C o n tro llin g and m o d ifying the environm ent to reduce corrosion could be achieved by a voiding contam ination o f concrete w ith chlorides and by p ro vid in g a good drainage system to avoid saturation w ith water.

N ot all o f the above methods arc to be applied sim ultaneously. The choice o f the com bination o f treatments to be used, the material to be used, and the application methods depend on a variety o f factors. M ost im portant arc the causes o f damage and the extent o f the damage. A n im portant guideline is that the repair system should restore the passivation o f the steel that was disrupted either by carbonation or chloride

5.2

Patching o f Concrete Surface The concrete around the corroded steel bar should be removed to a depth o f at

least 50mm beyond the corroded portion. The bar should be exposed around all the circum ference o f the corroded zone, w ith clearance underneath the bar being at least 20m m . L ig h t chipping hammers are used to remove damaged and unsound concrete. T he exposed re in forcing bars are cleaned, replaced or re-anchored to sound concrete. P rio r to patch placement, the patch edges are saw cut to near vertical as shown in I-'igure 5.1.

In the removal o f concrete, care should be taken adequately to prepare the boundaries o f the path, to prevent feathered edge length. The saw cu ttin g should not cause any damage to existing reinforcement. Shoring may be provided d uring repair to support the repaired slab [4].

The rust should be removed from the corroded steel surface, to a llo w intim ate contact w ith the repair mortar o r concrete so as to achieve repassivation. G rit blasting is the recommended method fo r this purpose, but there is often a reluctance to use this method because o f the environmental problems, such as the dust and noise generated d u rin g blasting. High-pressure water je t w ith sand is also used to clean the corroded re in fo rcin g bars. A fte r the com pletion o f the removal o f deteriorated concrete and rust, there is a need to clean the resulting surface from rust. The contractor usually uses an industrial vacuum cleaner w ith a small hand brush.

There are traditional com positions consisting o f cem entitious m ortar fo r repair. H owever, traditional com position consisting o f cem entitious binder and fine aggregate do not provide adequate performance. There are modem cem entitious m ortars used for repair, consisting o f more sophisticated form ulations that often include a com bination o f cem entitious components w ith polym eric additives.

E poxy bonding agents and polym er-m odified grouts provide stronger bond but (hey are less re la tive ly used because o f the ir higher cost. The perform ance o f concrete patches depends on many factors such as the extent o f deterioration in the areas adjacent

to the patch. It is believed that a new patch promotes more rapid corrosion o f steel in the adjacent areas having high chloride content [4],

Cost-elTcctivcness is the m ajor advantage o f the patching method o f repair. O ther advantages are practicality and d u ra b ility. The exposed reinforcem ent may be coated by epoxy before patching.

Because o f the disruption o f services and the re la tively long curing tim e necessary fo r concrete patch m aterial, epoxy m ortar is frequently substituted for

concrete. D iffe re n t therm al expansion coefficients for epoxy and concrete cause failure near the bond line o f the patch w ith the o rig in al concrete. A lso , d iffe re n t m odulus o f e la sticity cause d iffe re n tia l deform ations under sustained load (4J.

When rapid tem porary repairs are necessary to m aintain fa c ility operations, rapid setting m aterials are used to patch damaged floors. P olym er concrete, magnesium phosphate cement mortars, and recently s illic a fume have been used as additives to concrete. S ilica fum e concrete has more rapid setting and a higher electrical resistance [4 |.

5.3

Bonded Concrete Overlays Bonded concrete overlays are most com m only used to restore concrete bridge

decks and p arkin g structures. The overlays applied to the treated substrates should have considerable d u ra b ility and co m p a tib ility w ith the substrates. D u ra b ility o f the overlays refers to the resistance o f both the overlay and substrate treatments to corrosive environm ents [3 9 ].

The new wearing, surface w ill be less permeable to m oisture and chloride penetration. The thickness o f concrete cover over the reinforcem ent w ill be increased, resulting in m ore protection against corrosion. There are three m aterials that are most frequently used as concrete overlay, namely latex m o d ified ; lo w slum p, high density; and superplasticized lo w water/cement ratio concretes [4 ].

L a te x-M o d ifie d Concrete Overlays The use o f p olym er latex, either in the form o f a liq u id .suspension or dry pow der

prem ixed in the m ortar, is com m on. Polym er latex used in cem entitious m ortar im parts im proved characteristics over conventional m ortar in clu ding : Im proved d u c tility and lle xu ra l strength; Reduced p erm eability, but retaining the a b ility fo r vapors m ovem ent to take place in the set m ortar; Im proved bond to the substrate; and Im proved w o rk a b ility .

The p olym er latex chosen fo r such form u la tion s should be com patible w ith the cem entitious m a trix, so that the polym eric phase in the form o f a film form ed d uring cu rin g w ill be stable in the a lka lin e m atrix. A lso , the content o f a ir that is entrained by the surface-active agents in the latex should not be excessive f A S T M C 1059 - 91 ]. The favorable bonding and d u ra b ility properties o f la te x-m o d ille d concrete have made it the m a jo r m aterial used in overlays. P olym eric latex is a co llo id a l dispersion o f plastic particles in water. L ate x-m o d ifie d concrete consists o f the same ingredients as

conventional concrete w ith the additions o f about I to 4 percent by w e ig h t o f concrete 1261.

The use o f la te x-m o d ifie d concrete fo llo w s re la tiv e ly conventional methods and procedures except fo r its fin is h in g and curing characteristics. For the best results and properties o f la tex-m o difie d concrete, the wet cu rin g period to hydrate port I and cement should be fo llo w e d by a d ryin g period to a llo w the latex particles to form a film .

T esting and investigation

by researchers have shown that latex-m o difie d

overlays are e ffe ctive in retarding the ingress o f chlorides and preventing chlorides from penetrating the u nd e rlyin g concrete, provided the thickness o f the overlay is at least 19mm [26 ].

The required thickness o f overlay determines w hether la tex-m o dille d m o rta r o r concrete is to be used. M o rta r overlay is used when the thickness is usually 25m m or less. Concrete overlays are used fo r thickness greater than 25m m w ith a m axim um size

A fte r that wet cu rin g , a ir cu rin g fo llo w s fo r 72 hours before opening the fa c ility to service [2 6 ].

L ow S lum p, H ig h Density Concrete The State o f Io w a has led the w ay in the use o f lo w slum p, high density

concrete. For this reason the system is usually referred to as the Iow a system, fh e firs t step is to rem ove all unsound concrete in a s c a rify in g operation, by w h ich a depth o f 6m m to 20m m o f the entire e xistin g concrete surface is rem oved. The s c a rify in g operation is intended to rem ove m ost contam inants such as o il d rip s and ch lo rid e salts. A fte r re m o vin g deteriorated concrete, the exposed concrete surface and steel bars are sandblasted and a s t if f m o rta r grout is applied to the d ry concrete surface. Then lo w slum p concrete overlay is placed and m oist cured. H ig h q u a lity control is essential For the success o f the system. Cem ent paste o r m ortar slu rry is u sua lly used to bond the o verlay w ith the exposed surface. Concrete m ust be m ixe d on the jo b site w ith a slu m p o f less than 25m m . The im p e rm e a b ility and resistance o f the concrete to the ingress o f m oisture and chlorides depend to a large extent on an adequate v ib ra tin g and co m p actin g operation.

5.3.3

Epoxy and Polym er M o rtars E poxy mortars have been used co m m e rcia lly in many repair w o rk applications.

I he epoxy consists o f tw o liq u id components. When the tw o parts are m ixe d together, the com ponents react w ith a strong chem ical bond to form the hardened epoxy. M ineral fille r is usually used w ith the epoxy binder to reduce the cost and im prove physical and m echanical properties. The co efficie n t o f thermal expansion o f an epoxy m ortar could be five tim es greater than that o f plain concrete [26]. The m ain advantage o f epoxy m ortar is its very high compressive and tensile strengths w ith excellent adhesion to a w id e range o f m aterials. O ther advantages include dimensional sta b ility, high resistance to chem ical attack, and good electrical insulation [5]. Epoxy concrete overlay may crack due to lack o f fie x ib ility , especially in lo w temperatures. Epoxy m ortars have m odulus o f e la sticity higher than that o f concrete, w h ich results in d iffe re n t defo rm a tio n under the same stress on overlays. This w ill create cracks and perm it the ingress o f w ater and chlorides into the underlying concrete [14 ], Because o f the above mentioned

disadvantages and the high cost o f m aterial and application o f epoxies, its use is lim ited n ow to patching operations.

The d is tin c tio n between the w a te rp ro o lln g barriers is between the liq u id applied in place and perform ed sheet system [2 6 ]. The w a te rp ro o lln g system usually requires a durable w e a rin g course to resist cracking and tra ffic w ear and sn ow plo w damage. A n asphalt p ro te ctive w earing surface overlay is generally used, but unfortunately the asphalt is permeable and porous and w ill a llo w the ingress o f salt-laden m oisture through to the m em brane surface. Furtherm ore, corrosion and deterioration o f the concrete cannot be delected In the early stages [26].

The m a jo r d iffic u lty in the w aterproofing system that affects its e ffic ie n c y and perform ance is b liste rin g. The trapped vapor pressure under the w a te rp ro o fin g

membrane w ill tend to separate it from the substrate and form blisters. T h is increase in vapor pressure is a response to environm ental change in tem perature and atm ospheric pressure [26 ].

Rubberized m astic asphalt w ith the asphalt em ulsion-coated glass fib e r systems were id e n tifie d as the m ost satisfactory in O ntario though th e ir perform ance is d o u b tfu l.

Principles and Development o f Cathodic Protection C e n c ra l C o rro sio n o f re in fo rcin g steel in concrete is a widespread and enorm ously costly

problem in m any parts o f the w o rld in clu ding the U nited Stale and Canada. Num erous concrete structures in clu d in g bridge decks and substructurs, p a rkin g garages, balconies and others are deteriorating as a result o f re in forcing steel corrosion. V irtu a lly any reinforced concrete structure is susceptible to the ravages o f corrosion i f subjected to the rig h t environm ent [5 8 ].

V is u a l signs o f corrosion-induced damage on m any types o f reinforced concrete structure are becom ing more and m ore prevalent. In m any parts o f the country, one can h a rd ly d riv e across the bridge o r enter a parking garage that does not have some degree o f corrosion damage. The rate o f concrete deterioration at any given tim e is dependent on many factors in clu d in g the corrosion rate, re in forcing steel concentration, concrete properties, eover and the environm ent. Once corrosion has begun, there is one th in g fo r certain - it w ill o n ly get worse and it w ill do so at an ever-increasing rate. U ltim a te ly , i f co rrosion is a llo w e d to continue, structural in teg rity can be com prom ised due to loss o f a section o f the re in fo rc in g steel and/or loss o f bond between the steel and the concrete, and replacem ent may be the o n ly so lution [57].

Cathodic Protection Cathodic protection (CP) is w idely used, and it is an cITeclive method o f

corrosion control. M any people, including engineers, believe CP is so com plicated and expensive that it has no practical use in the concrete rehabilitation industry. Then there arc those w ho say CP doesn't w o rk or that it is unreliable in the long term. In Iact. cathodic protection is one o f the most effective and available methods for the long-term protection o f actively corroding concrete bridge decks and parking structures. W hile m ost o f the remedial measures w ork by preventing o r retarding the ingress o f m oisture, oxygen and chloride to the level o f reinforcement, the cathodic protection method prevents corrosion in the presence o f salt, oxygen and water, regardless o f pH. The p rinciple o f cathodic protection is w ell understood and proven to be e ffe ctive in arresting reinforcing steel corrosion on approxim ately 1 1It y bridge decks and several parking structures in Canada and in the United Stales; fifteen o f those are in O nta rio alone [40]. Some o f the application details are still in the development stages and practical problems being currently encountered deal w ith criteria o f protection, design and m o n itoring the system performance. However, w o rk is co ntinuing to develop this e fficie n t method fo r cost-effective application procedures and to achieve fu ll understanding o f the detem iinable effects on concrete, steel, and p a rticu la rly on concrete/steel bond [41].

Besides stopping reinforcement corrosion, the other advantage o f the cathodic protection method is that its performance can be m onitored by non-destructive test methods [26 ]. Some researchers [42] believe that as a result o f the application o f the cathodic protection method, negative chloride ions are drawn away from the v ic in ity o f reinforcem ent to the anode, where they are oxidized to form chlorine gas; thus the reinforcem ent restores its passivating oxide layer due to the reverted alkaline stale o l' the surrounding concrete. However, the cathodic protection system may be applied o nly to decks in w hich the concrete is sound and properly a ir entrained. A ppropriate structural repairs should be performed before installing the system on deteriorated concrete slabs [4. 26]. A fte r m illio n s o f dollars o f expenditure on research in the area o f corrosion and its m itigation, cathodic protection evolved as the o nly technique that

could p o s itive ly arrest corrosion o f steel in the existing concrete structure. In fact, some time ago the Federal H ighw ay A dm in istratio n (F H W A ) acknowledged that cathodic protection is the only technique that had proven to stop corrosion in salt-contaminated bridge decks regardless o f the chloride content in the concrete [59|.

5 .5.2.1 . P rin c ip le s o f C a th o d ic P ro te ctio n The mechanism o f the electrochemical corrosion process o f re in forcing steel in chloride-contam inated concrete is discussed in Chapter 3 o f this report. Figures 5.3 (a), (b) and (c) show the corrosion reactions in a typical chloride contam inated concrete deck. In Figure 5.3 (a), the top rebar mat is most com m only anodic because o f chloride ion penetration and its higher concentration near the top o f the concrete cover area. The bottom mat is cathodic, and a difference in electric current w ill flo w between the connected top and bottom re bars w ith a How o f negative ions through the concrete, w h ich serves as an electrolyte, in Figure 5.3 (C ), the anodic corrosion reactions (production o f electrons) at the top o f the mat, and the cathodic reactions at bottom are shown w ith the ionic transfer through the saturated concrete deck [4 2 ]. It should be noted that the same reactions, cathodic and anodic, could take place in m icro-galvanic cells along the surface o f one rebar.

The protection at both the cathodic and the anode, shown by equations ( 3 - 1) and (3-2) is reversible. S upplying su fficien t current in the proper d ire ctio n causes the
cuiTcnt discharging anodes to become current receiving cathodes, and F ++ions w ill be

retained to Feo as shown [15. 42].

1 here arc two methods by w hich cathodic protection can be applied to concrete reinforcem ent, namely the galvanic or sacrificial anode and impressed current method.

5.5.2.2 G alvanic or Sacrificial Anode In this method. CP is based on the principles o f d issim ilar metal corrosion and the relative position o f specific metal in galvanic series. No external power is needed w ith this type o f system and mueh less maintenance is required. Such a system also provides protective current p rim a rily to areas on the steel surface, where it is most needed, fh e concrete reinforcem ent is electrically connected to a metal o r a llo y more negative, o r higher in the electrom otive series, than the re in forcing steel to be protected. M agnesium , zinc, and alum inum are the most suitable anodes that can be coupled for the protection o f steel in concrete. The natural potential difference between the steel and the sacrificed anode is the current d riv in g potential. The electrons m ove from tb to the cathode, thus p ro viding the negative charge to steel. The sacrificial an lode : . Z'n. c

.i.e is.

However, the relatively high resistivity o f the concrete led to early opinions that the lo w d riv in g voltage provided by such systems wonld be inadequate for CP o f steel in concrete. O ther disadvantages are the rapid consumption o f the sacrificial anode and the need fo r replacement, and the controlled nature o f the galvanic system after installation [59].

5.5.2.3 The Impressed C u rre n t System The impressed current cathodic protection is achieved by d riv in g low voltage direct current from re latively inert anode material through the concrete to the

re in forcing steel. D irect current o f su fficien t magnitude and direction is applied, so as to oppose the natural flo w o f current resulting from the electrochemical corrosion process, fhe direct current is supplied by an external power source, most often a CP rectifier. Recently, solar power has received attention and research is under way. The cost o f

The required power is as lo w as 0.22 watts per square meter oT concrete surface or less 150], The anode materials arc usually selected on the basis o f d u ra b ility and conductivity since they do not depend on the relative potentials o f anode and steel. High silicon cast iron and carbon are com m only used [26 ]. The mechanism o f the impressed current cathodic protection system is illustrated in Fig. 5.4 (a) and (b).

H alfC eU s l'Ücctrical potential measurements are made in order to determine and evaluate

the elTcct o f the cathodic protection on corrosion o f steel. Usually a copper electrode in saturated copper sulfate solution half-cells (CSE ha 11-cell) is used to take

measurements. The copper sulfate solution w ill be in contact w ith the concrete and the copper electrode is connected to the steel through a high resistance voltm eter. The measured electrical potential is essentially an indication o f corrosive tendency o f the steel in the concrete environm ent relative to the corrosive tendency o f the copper in its environm ent.

The re c tifie r is provided w ith circu itry to continuously compare the voltm eter to predetermined crite ria and to adjust the current supply to the system as requirements vary [41 j.

5.5.4

Potential C rite ria It was shown e arlie r that the corrosion rate o f steel in concrete is controlled by

oxygen a va ila b ility. In the cathodic protection system, polarization o f steel is controlled by the applied potential value [1 ]. A n a lytic procedures show that there should be a c ritic a l protective current flo w through the cathodic protection circu it below which protection is not su fficie n t and above w h ich the steel/concrete bond may be damaged [59]. Theoretical studies have shown that the optim um protective potential fo r steel in concrete depends on the chloride concentration [44].

The required crite ria for cathodically protected steel embedded in concrete are not clearly defined, and it appears that a single best criterion has not been agreed upon yet [59 ]. M ost com m only, a potential value o f -0 .8 5 V measured to standard coppercopper sulfate h alf-cell (SCE) is adapted as the measure o f the optim um level o f cathodic protection o f steel in concrete [41].

System Connection and C u rre n t Distribution A reinforced concrete deck re in fo rcin g steel consists generally o f a top and

bottom mat. The upper reinforcem ent is usually susceptible to the penetration o f deleterious materials and consequently corrosion. Theoretically, each rebar in the top mat to be protected must be connected to the negative term inal o f a DC rectifier. I'his is not p ractically feasible, and it is assumed that electrical co ntin u ity is provided by bar contact p o in t and tie wires. The top and bottom re in forcing mats and the structural steel are n orm a lly connected by tie wires and/or chairs [43]. E le ctrica lly isolated bars w ill receive little o r no current and w ill be affected by the cathodic protection circu it current and can be corroded by stray current. It should be noted that such isolated elements w ill corrode faster than before the application o f the cathodic protection system due to localized corrosion at the point o f current e xit from the rebar [41 ].

There are tw o systems to connect the positive term inal o i' the re ctifie r to the electrolyte (the concrete), the conductive overlay and the w ire or linear anode system, 'fh e conductive overlay method was the firs t and the most com m only used in cathodic protection systems in concrete decks. The conductive overlay system consists o f a cast silicon iron a llo y embedded in conductive coke breeze asphalt layer and covered by conventional asphalt concrete wearing course [43] (see Fig. 5.5). The use o f conductive overlay is associated w ith d u ra b ility and structural problem s as discussed in this section earlier. The w ire anode system uses long electrodes o f platinized niobium copper core w ire strands as the anode. The strands are placed into slots cut in the concrete In both the conductive overlay and w ire o r linear anode current d istrib utio n system, the conductive layer (the anode) must be kept isolated from the reinforcem ent otherwise the system w ill be short circuited [43].

5.5.6

Problems w ith System Perform ance and M aintenance In general, the evaluation measures have indicated that the application o f

cathodic protection system to new and existing concrete bridge decks and parking structures has been perform ing satisfactorily. However, one o f the m ajor problems o f current installations is d u ra b ility o f the conductive overlay.

continues to be a m a jo r problem all over the w o rld . A p p ro x im a te ly 564.000 bridges are standing in the U nited Slates. A t least 105,500 o f them need repair o r replacement. M illio n s o f square feet o f bridge decks show heavy deterioration, cra ckin g, spalling, co rro sio n o f reinforcem ent, chem ical attack, and the like . One such bridge, the 19th A ven u e B rid g e in M arkham , O N , was replaced in 1998. fh is was a ve ry b e a u tifu l, old single-span re in forced concrete bridge, b u ilt in 1928 at the m outh o f M arkh a m V a lle y.

A c c o rd in g to the T o w n o f M arkham records the deck o f the bridge was replaced in 1945 due to deterioration. The bridge is situated in a widespread residential sector between W arden A venue and K ennedy Road on 19th A venue, and is the o n ly ready tra nsportation route fo r local people and the surrounding business area. Due to M a rk h a m 's rapid expansion, road tra ffic has increased d ra m a tica lly in the past forty years or so. Since 1995 a num ber o f residential developm ents have been constructed, and a fair-size d residential sector has emerged.

Severe deterioration was found on the underside o f the deck slab in c lu d in g the expansion jo in ts . Leakage through the jo in ts had caused extensive corrosion o f the reinforcem ent, sp allin g and delam ination o f the concrete cover.

In some areas, the cracks were shallow and both parallel and norm al to the e xte rio r concrete surface. The cracks penetrated to a depth o f about 25m m to 55mm.The paste near the cracks was carbonated, in the in terior o f the concrete, the affected concrete particles had become soft and internally cracked w ith o ut the cracks extending in to the mortar. Carbonation results in various physical changes, but the main efleet is ;t reduction in the a lka lin ity o f concrete from approxim ately pi I 8.5 to 9.0. This change causes the re in forcing steel to become unprotected from corrosion because o f lo w ering o f p ll o f the concrete. The carbonation usually moves into concrete fro m exposed surface at a rate that is dependent upon the moisture content o f concrete. The carbonation fro n t progresses rapidly when the h um idity is between 50 % and 70% and is n e g lig ib ly slo w at both lo w and very high relative hum ilities.

6.3.3

C hloride Contents Sam pling and testing for total chloride content was carried out in accordance

w ith A A S H T O T-260. The shallow samples showed levels o f chlorides

.lat ranged

from 0.65 to 6.4 kg/m^ o f concrete, and the deep samples o f the chloride content ranged from 0.18 to 2.3 kg / m^

The total value o f the chlorides found at the level o f reinforcem ent in spal led areas was w e ll in excess o f critica l amounts o f chlorides required to create a corrosion problem . H igh salt concentration resulted from a progressive build-up o f ch lo rid e levels due to saline w ater passing through the expansion and construction jo in ts and the c a p illa ry m ovem ent o f saline solutions through the concrete. The am ount o f chlorides necessary to destroy the passive film on the reinforcing steel is not a single value fo r all situations. It depends on the value o f pH. water and oxygen contents, and the bond between concrete and reinforcing steel. The actual values are not available.

Evaluation and Decision M a k in g Based on all o f the above test results, we may note that the concrete is still in

good condition structurally, and it remains confined w ith in the re in forcing steel in the m a jo rity o f areas. Moreover, the pro ba b ility o f structural failure may be m inim ized by .slowing down expansion, requiring immediate rehabilitation measures. The existing structure was a single-lane bridge and was b u ilt o nly to serve local tra ffic. The Tow n o f M arkham had an objective to rehabilitate the existing structure i f possible and to increase the bridge w idth to accommodate tw o more lanes, one each w ay. The consultant subm itted tw o proposals to the tow n; I ) I o rehabilitate the existing portions o f the bridge and add a two-lane structure adjacent to the e xistin g bridge. 2) T o dem olish the existing bridge and b uild a new bridge, w h ich w ill be able to accommodate existing tra ffic and have reserve capacity for the future.

The T o w n o f Markham found its e lf more com fortable w ith the firs t option, because they were very nervous about the disturbance o f the natural landscape and w ith the new price. A ccording to the tow n regulations, before a decision is made, public o pinio n must be obtained. The tow n called a public m eeting before they gave the ir recommendation to the council com m ittee that usually makes the final decision. The local com m unity had a genuine concern that during the heavy ra in y season the water level in the creek goes higher than the deck top, and then nobody can pass the bridge. In the p u b lic meeting p ublic delegates, w ith the help o f their local councillors and members o f provincial parliam ent (M PP ). succeeded in their demand fo r the construction o f a new bridge. The decision was made, therefore, to construct a new bridge.

A ccording to CSA standard, m ajor bridges are designed to serve for 45 years, hut most bridge structures serve more than their design life span. C hallenging this longevity are not o n ly the normal physical and chemical attacks on the concrete its e lf and on the reinforcem ent, but also the intentional heavy applications o f salt to the decks o f bridges and. in the ease o f railroad and floating bridges, the accum ulation o f internal damage (fatigue) due to cyclic dynam ic loading

G reat progress has been made recently in id e n tifyin g causes and lln d in g preventive and m itigating measures aimed at sped He phenomena. Advanced laboratory technology and equipment have combined w ith field observations to describe the processes, prescribe tests fo r early diagnosis, and develop appropriate countermeasures.

A num ber o f tests o f specific parameters have recently been developed and are n ow being implemented as mandatory criteria for bridges designed for service lives in excess o f 45 years. Ever more refined nonlinear, inelastic, finite element analyses are being em ployed to reveal areas o f probable cracking due to structural response. R igid enforcem ent o f specified quantitative criteria, focused on specific parameters, ignores the interactive complex process involved. Excessive reliance on such criteria impedes rather than helps the constructions progress and may be counterproductive to d u ra b ility .

New S tru c tu re I he new bridge design was based on the d ura b ility principles. Sheet piles were

used to isolate the underground concrete footing from water contact, possible seepage o r other chem ical attack from the soil. The 6m m -thick corrugated sheet piles were driven 2.75m below the bottom o f the footing. The sheet piles were embedded in the concrete fo o tin g w ith 25m m -thick dowels welded to the sheet piles and embedded in the tbotings concrete.

Throughout the bridge epoxy-coated reinforcing steel bar {diam eter from 10mm to 25m m ) was used to protect the bar from corrosion or other chem ical attacks. The m ost im portant aspect during the construction phase was to m aintain the q uality o f the concrete, cover o f the reinforcement, and workm anship, as shown in Table I. The assigned inspector by the consultant strictly checked the cover, size and num ber and type o f re bars before a llo w in g the pouring o f concrete.

The concrete was supplied by one o f the reputable concrete m ix suppliers o f the area, specified by the M in is try o f Transportation o f O ntario (M T O ). A ll concrete was prepared s tric tly according to the M T O design m ix. The concrete q uality, slump, cylinders casting and tim e were s trictly checked and recorded. The concrete in the deck was poured through pum p to m aintain the qua lity and design w ith proper draining, ensuring that there w ill be no accum ulation o f water on the deck top. The deck top was properly screed to m aintain the slope and help drain the water. Figure 6.4 and I 'abic 3 shows screed elevation and spans.

The deck was properly waterproofed according to O ntario P rovincial standard (O PSD ), w ith hot asphalt rubberized membrane, by a specialized crew. A fte r

w a lc p ro o fin g the leakage/seepage tests were perform ed, in w hich lOOrnm-deep water was placed fo r 48 hours to check foi any leakage from the w aterproofing system. A fte r

Increasingly greater attention has been paid in recent years to tiie problem o f d u ra b ility o f reinforced concrete structures, fh e extensive a pp lication o f concrete

m aterials and th e ir lim ite d life in various media have necessitated a g ro w in g volum e o f repair and restoration o f reinforced concrete structures. C onsidering the d ifllc u ltie s o f such repairs, it is im perative to provide an adequate and guaranteed service life o f roinforced concrete rig h t at the tim e o f designing and construction o f structures. The

problem o f p re dictin g and designing reinforced concrete structures fo r a g i\ eii life can be resolved o n ly by studying the com plex structural m aterial and the environm ent. processes o f interaction between (he

Concrete is a construction material whose properties, in order to serx c as a strong, long-lasting and co st-effe ctive substance, in construction projects such as roads and bridges, m ust be com bined in a technological process that m axi mixes those properties, a process that takes in to consideration the actions o f o xid a tio n , temperature, h u m id ity and d u ra b ility co nd itio n s over tim e . These parameters arc o f conclusive im portance fo r the long-term s ta b ility and strength o f concrete structures over time.

D eterioration o f concrete bridge decks and parking structures (and even residential roadways) has become a very serious problem in recent years: m ajor repairs arc ty p ic a lly needed even in the early years o f service life. The extensive use o f d e icin g salts has caused accelerated corrosion o f re in fo rcin g steel and deterioration o f concrete decks. The products o f corrosion occupy considerably more volum e than the o rig in a l steel and exert substantial pressures on the surrounding concrete and cause sp allin g o f the concrete and its fracture.

M ost corrosion-related structural distress in concrete is generally caused by electrochem ical action due to the form a tion o f local electrochem ical o r galvanic cells

Tlic main iactors that inllueneo the onset and rale o l'c o rro s io n are: the electrical re sistivity o f the concrete; reduction in pi I: a v a ila b ility o f oxygen and m oisture; and temperature. The reduction in pH o f concrete can he a result oi' c h lo rid e salt penetration or carbonation. The inhom ogenetics in concrete along the surl'ace o f steel rehars are s u ffic ie n t to set up anodic and cathodic areas in a m acrogalvanic electrochem ical cell and eventually cause a 1 1o w o f current. This inhom ogenely causes a d ifference in electropotcntial and can arise from many causes, such as differences in ch lo rid e concentration, cycles o f w e ttin g and d ryin g , differences in pi 1 value, and exposure conditions.

P erm e ab ility is considered to be the most im portant p ro pcrl} o f the concrete a ffe c tin g co n o sio n o f the reinforcem ent. When concrete w ith high perm e ab ility

becomes saturated w ith water, its electrical co n d u ctivity re la tive ly increases. A lso , the ingress o f ch lo rid es, oxygen and carbon d io xid e into the surface o f re in fo rcin g steel w ill be re la liv ly easier. H ig h water/cem ent ratio, inadequate consolidation, and increased b lccd ir ; re m ain factors responsible fo r high perm eability or porous concrete.

B le e d in g o f freshly placed concrete during the consolidation process can lead to lin e a r depression and settlem ent cracks along the length o f rebars, leading to rapid corrosion. Zones o f weakness m ay be form ed in arches o f unstable fresh concrete between h o rizo n ta l bars, w h ich causes surface scaling and loss o f concrete co ve r over reinforcem ent.

The protective value o f the concrete cover over reinforcem ent against corrosion is attributed to the decrease in d iffu s io n o f chem ically deleterious substances, the reduction in plastic cracking, and the increased resistance o f concrete to b ursting forces caused by rust.

R epair and protection o f concrete decks are im portant in order to restore structural and fun ctio na l in te g rity o f the fa c ility . P ro vid ing an im perm eable barrier between the concrete surface and any corrosive environm ent is an attempt to prevent the

penetration ol' m oisture and chloride salts to the reinforcem ent and to increase the watertightness o f the structure. These attempts to im prove the d u ra b ility o f concrete have m et w ith va ry in g degrees o f sueeess (and failure).

C athodic protection has proven to be an e ffective means for the long-term protection o f co rro d in g concrete decks. The control o f current How arrests corrosion in the presence o f chloride salts, oxygen and water, regardless o f p ll. The evaluation

measures have indicated that the application o f cathodic protection system to new and e xistin g concrete decks has been p e rfo rm in g satisfactorily. W o rk is co n tin u in g to develop this technology into cost-effective application procedures and to a \o id the side effects that may affect the concrete, the steel, and the bond between the concrete and the reinforcem ent.

Present construction practices can produce both excellent and poor q u a lity concretes. M ore research w o rk is required to investigate the reasons w iiy concrete deterioration s till exists w ith current construction procedures. The matters o f budgets, b id din g , and local p o litics perhaps should be included in any investigation. M ore e ffo rt is needed in the fie ld o f im p ro vin g concrete q u a lity and d u ra b ility through reliable construction practices rather than concentrating on remedial measures a fte r the fact, such as sealing concrete surfaces. Renewed emphasis on d u ra b ility o f concrete is im perative in design, construction and maintenance o f the structure.
