There w ere no significant differences in the recovery of vitam in Da betw een th e tw o form ulations of vitamin Da used in any of the products (P>0.05). The recovery of vitam in Da in cheese, whey, yogurt and ice cream im m ediately after processing w as 87-90%, 7-9%, 97-99% and 99-100%, respectively. H ow ever, retention of vitam in Da in cheese, yogurt and ice cream over the storage periods

w as 93-100%, 100-102% and 98-99%, respectively. In conclusion, cheese, yogurt a n d ice cream w ere good vehicles for vitam in Da fortification, using either form.

1. LITERATURE REVIEW

1.1 V itam in D
V itam in D, also k n o w n as calciferol, is a fat-soluble vitam in. It is fo u n d in so m e fortified foods, b u t also can be m ade in the h u m an b o d y via exposure to u ltra violet rays from the sun. In the body, the liver and kidney help to convert v itam in D to its active h o rm o n e form (Feldm an et al, 1997). The p rim e function of vitam in D is to m aintain norm al blood levels of calcium and p h o sp h o ru s. V itam in D aids in the absorption of calcium, helping to form and m ain tain strong bones. Deficiency of tliis vitam in m ay cause rickets in children a n d osteoporosis in adults, w hich are skeletal diseases th at resu lt in defects th at w eaken bones (w w w .vitam ind.ucr.edu/m ilk.htm l). An excess of

vitam in D m a y cause hypercalcem ia, w hich is d u e to the excess absorption of calcium by the intestine and enhanced bone resorption (Collins and N orm an,

1991).
There are tw o form s of vitam in D, nam ely vitam in Dz (ergocalciferol) and vitam in Da (cholecalciferol). The n atu ral form of vit m i n D in hu m an s and

curimals is v itam in Da, w hich is p roduced in the body from cholesterol an d 7dehydrocholesterol. A n alternative, vitam in Dz, is derived from tlie yeast sterol ergosterol b y chem ical syntliesis (w w w .vitam ind.ucr.edu/m ilk.htm l)

F oods are fortified w ith vitam in D to protect the population, w h ich may b e insufficiently exposed to sunlight (Thom pson and Plouffe, 1993; Reichel et al, 1989). In the diet, fluid m ilk is considered to be the m ajor source of vitam in D. N u tritio n a l recom m endations specify 200 lU (5 pg) of vitam in D p er day for in fan ts an d for adu lts u n d e r age 50. For those betw een 51-70 years age, the

reco m m en d ed intake is 400 lU (10 pg) of vitam in D p er day; an d for adults over 70 years, 600 lU (15 pg) p er day is recom m ended (Vieth and Chem , 2001). Fluid m ilk is su p p lem en ted in US and C anada w ith vitam in D to m eet these req u irem en ts. V ariations in vitam in D concentration have been reported for fortified w h o le an d partially skim m ed m ilk products. In 1991 and 1993, 70% of m ilk

sam ples tak en from C anada aird the US contained < 80% of the am o u n t of v itam in D claim ed, an d half h ad less than 50% (Chen et al., 1993 and Holick et al., 1992). Also, 14% of the skim m ilk sam ples contained no detectable vitam in D. T an n er et al. (1988) reported th at only 15.8% of the US sam ples of fluid m ilk h ad concentrations w ith in 81 to
1 2 0

% of the label claims.

H an d erso n and

W ickrow ski (1978) fo und w ide variation betw een the am ounts found in the m ilk a n d the am o u n t p rin ted on the label. This discrepancy of vitam in D betw een claim ed values an d m easured values in skim m ilk m ay have been due to

chem ical deg rad atio n as concluded by Renken and W arthesen (1993) or to otlier ; ï , errors d u rin g m an u factu rin g (Faulkner et al, 2000).

centers are designated b y using the R, S notation; the configuration of the double bonds are notated E for "entgegen" or trans, and Z for "zuzammen" or cis. Thus the official nam e of vitam in Ds is 9,10-seco (5Z, 7E)-5,7,10(19) choies ta triene-3 [3ol, an d the official nam e of vitam in Dz is 9,10-seco (5Z, 7E)-5,7,10(19), 22ergostatetraene-3|3-ol (w w w .vitam ind.ucr.edu/m ilk.htm l).

H ealth benefits of vitam in D V itam in D helps in the absorption and utilization of calcium and

phosphorus. Vitam in D is necessary for norm al grow th in children, hr adults, it helps w itlr any function that utilizes calcium or phosphom s, such as

transm ission of nerves, the beating of the heart, blood clotting, and m any others (Feldm an et al, 1997) In children, vitam in D will insure that the body form s healthy teeth and bones. P ostm enopausal w om en are already advised to take vitam in D and

calcium to com bat bone-thinning osteoporosis (Vieth and Chem, 2001). O ther benefits of vitam in D supplem entation include: prevention of certain cancers.

osteoarthritis progression, m ultiple sclerosis and hypertension. A nim al studies show tliat V itam in D is im portant for im m une function. There is also evidence that vitam in D m ay n o t just help prevent cancer b u t m ay help in him or regression. A dditionally, vitam in D deficiency has been associated w ith an

increased risk for type 1 diabetes. The converse is also true - adequate vitam in D lowers diabetes.

1.1.3 Canadian legislation The C anadian Food and D rug Act m andates Üiat all fluid m ilk sold should contain vitam in Da in such an am ount that a reasonable daily intake of milk contains not less than 300 and not m ore than 400 lU of the vitam in. The

C anadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has sim plified the regulation by requiring all fortified m ilk to contain betw een 31.7 to 51.6 lU of vitam in D per 100 ml. This requirem ent, w hich has been in place for decades, has resulted in a dram atic reduction of disorders caused by deficiency of this vitam in (Faulkner et. al., 2000). Currently, m ilk-processing plants rely on the m anufacturer's inform ation and recom m endations for im plem enting their fortification processes w ith no adequate m onitoring of the final products. The Flealth Protection Branch of

H ealth and W elfare C anada has undertaken periodic sam pling and testing for vitam in D nationally. H owever, there is presently no system atic m onitoring of

R e p r o d u c e d with p e r m issio n o f th e co p y rig h t o w n e r . Further rep ro d u ctio n p roh ib ited w ith ou t p e r m is s io n

this vitam in by CFIA in the O ntario retail milk supply.

D airy processors

voluntarily have som e sam ples tested for vitam in A and then use the result of vitam in A to extrapolate vitam in D content in skim m ed and partially skim m ed milk. This is theoretically possible because the prem ix used for the fortification of skim m ed and partially skim m ed m ilk contains vitam in A and D, b u t w ithout actual analysis, it is difficult to m onitor vitam in losses during processing.

1.2

Background inform ation on dairy products
D airy products are traditionally classified into tw o broad p ro d u ct groups:

i) fluid o r m arket m ilk products and ii) m anufactured miUc products. Som e of the m ore common foods which are norm ally considered fluid milk products include whole milk,
2

% milk, low-fat milk, skim milk, chocolate

milk, egg nog, half and half cream, and cultured butter milk. These products m ay be fortified w ith vitam ins or minerals. Processing conditions m ay be

changed to produce pasteurized, hom ogenized, or other types of special products (H arper and Hall, 1976). M anufactured m ilk products include m ost of the non-beverage products, sx.ich !S cheese, yogurt, ice cream and frozen desserts, as w ell as condensed, evaporated, and/or dried milks.

1.2.1 Processing of dairy products The general m ethods of processing cheese, yogurt and ice cream will be discussed here, w ith some details on fortification w ith vitam in D.

C heese Cheese is the m ost com m on processed dairy product. M ilk from various

anim als, particularly cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep is used to m ake cheese (w w w .cip.ukcentre.com /cheese4htm l). Cheese is tire generic nam e for a group of ferm ented m ilk-based food products produced throughout the w orld in a great diversity of flavors, textures, and forms. Despite the lim ited range of raw

m aterials (bovine, ovine, caprine, or buffalo milk), there are -500 varieties of cheese recognized by the International Dairy Federation (Bukhalter, 1981).

1.2.1.1.1 Cheese production The production of all varieties of cheese involves a generally similar protocol as depicted in Figure 3.

FIGURE 3; General protocol for cheese manufacturing (www.efr.hvv.ac.uk/SDA/cheese2.htmI)

Cheese is m ad e by coagulating milk, cream, skim milk, butterm ilk, or a com bination of these and then draining p art or m ost of the w hey. Processing into cheese serves to concentrate the protein and fat w hile reducing the carbohydrate content. Pasteurized m ilk is used in most, b u t n o t all, cases. Use of m ilk concentrated by ultrafiltration is a]so used (Sfiarma et al., 1989). U ltrafiltration is a high-pressure filtration process that results in the rem oval of w ater and low -m olecular w eight solutes. The resulting re tenta te coagulates

il

m ore rapidly than regular m ilk and the form ed curd is also firm er than w ith regular m ilk (Kosikowski, 1982).

1) Coagulation M ilk u sed for cheese production m ay be clotted w ith rennin or acid or both. A bacterial culture is added for acid production. Formerly, the clotting of m ilk w as achieved by using rennin (the calf gastric enzym e chymosin). Rennin usually is used as a crude extract, rennet. Rennin acts m ost effectively at p H 6.7 (Bingham, 1971) and a tem perahire of about 40°C. Enzym atic coagulation of m ilk involves tw o phases. Rennin is involved in the first phase, in w hich a bond of K-casein is cleaved to form insoluble para-x-casein an d a soluble peptide (Bingham, 1971). In the second phase, a clot is form ed by the para-K-casein and calcium (Cheryan et al., 1976). Coagulation time decreases as the pH of the

second phase is decreased from 6.7 to 5.6 and as the tem perature increases (Cheryan et al, 1976b). H eating milk above 65°C and then cooling it prior to treatm ent w ith rennin reduces clotting rate and curd firm ness. A heat-induced interaction b etw een K-casein and p-lactoglobulin m ay delay the action of rennin on K-casein (Sawyer, 1969). Rennet is used from three anim al sources (veal calf, ad u lt bovine, and porcine pepsin) and three m icrobial sources (Mucor miehei, Mucor pusillus, and Endothia parasitica). Use of enzym es from different sources has necessitated

alterations in processing techniques and in some cases resulted in cheese that is pasty and bitter. M ore encouraging results m ay be possible for m icrobial

enzym es because th ey contain nonspecific p ro teases, w hich enhance o p portunity for form ation of a better flavor (Pczczola, 1988).

2) Curd treatment Follow ing coagulation, the curd is cut to allow drainage of the whey. C uttin g the curd into various-sized pieces controls this process. The curd is

h eated at lo w tem peratures to hasten the loss of w hey and produce a m ore com pact texture. Salts, acids and bacterial culhires are added at various steps in the process. The curd then is pressed to m ake the cheese firm er and m ore

com pact. A t that stage, variations in treatm ents lead to diversity in the kinds of cheese available. Cheese m ay be classified on the basis of their m oisture content. For

exam ple, h a rd cheeses, such as C heddar, contain 30-40% m oisture w hereas semi soft cheeses, such as M uenster, contain 50-75% m oisture (Fox et al, 2000)

3) Curing Cheese m ay be cured for varying length of tim e and at varying tem perature and h u m id ity in order to allow the product to rip en (Fox et al., 2000). The chem ical and physical changes associated w ith ripening result in a

13

change from a bland, tough, rubbery mass to a full-flavored, soft, m ellow p ro d u ct. Salt level is related to control of ripening. O m ission of salt speeds u p the rip en in g process, resulting in a pasty texture and the developm ent of an um iahiral, bitter, fruity, or flat flavor in C heddar cheese. These effects are

attrib u ted to increased bacterial activity in the unsalted cheese. D uring ripening, carbohydrate, fat, an d p rotein contents are altered. Lactose is rapidly converted to lactic acid, w hich helps to inhibit the grow th of undesirable m icroorganism s (Fox et al., 2000). Lipolytic enzym es liberate fatty acids, w hich contribute to the flavor. The typical flavor of C heddar cheese is not developed w h en skim m ilk is u sed , suggesting an im p o rtan t role for fat in flavor (O hren and Tuckey, 1969). Proteolytic enzym es such as rennin are responsible for the form ation of nitrogenous pro d u cts of interm ediate size, such as peptones and peptides. Enzym es act on these and oüier substances to form am ino acids, am ines, fatty acids, esters, aldehydes, alcohols, and ketones, in p a rt responsible for the characteristic sensory ath ib u tes of cheese (Cream er and Olson, 1982).

1.2.1.1.2 Processing of cheese on industrial scale The m anufacture of cheese has become a m ajor activity in m any dairyprocessing plants. It has been one of the last branches of the dairy in d u stry to becom e w ell m echanized. In fact, even today, tliere is no real continuous process u sed com m ercially for tire various types of cheese, although there are several
14

n e w an d in terestin g developm ents, w hich are em ploying autom ation to a certain extent. 1.2.1.1.2.1 C heese vat A v at consists of a m etal ourar box w ith an inner m etal tan k so placed th at the bo tto m of th e in n er tan k is su p p o rted on a second tank, allow ing a space for w ater b etw een tire tw o tanks. N ote that an FI-shaped steam pipe lies in the

bottom of the o u ter tank to d ish ib u te heat evenly to the in n er tank. The inner tank, o r v a t pan, is u su ally m ade of stainless steel w ith w elded-type construction. Cheese v a t are n o rm ally m ad e in sizes w ith a 4Ü0 to 6000 liters capacity.

1.2.1.1.2.2 C heese curd m ill T he curd m ill is u se d for cutting the curd to the p ro p er size for finishing in the m an u factu re of C h ed d a r and som e other types of cheese. This m achine is m ade to fit on the top of the cheese vat, is m ounted on a special dolly so th at it can be read ily m o v ed so that the cheese can be cut to different degrees of fineness. The sta n d a rd m ill cut is a 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm. 1.2.1.1.2.3 Agitator A m etal cheese v at w ith an autom atic, forking type agitator is used com m ercially to cool the curd after cutting. It is m otor-driven and travels on a track above the v a t so th a t it passes back and forth from one end of the v a t to the other, o r b etw ee n the lim its of adjustable stops.

1.2.1.1.2.4 C heese p ress There are different types of cheese press used com m ercially, b u t the m ost co m m o n is h y d rau lic cheese press. The cheese is p u t in hoops that are placed in a p ress to w h ich p ressure is applied. H oops are usually from 30 to 40 cm in diam eter.

Flavour, arom a and texture of y o g u rt vary from country to country, and these d e p en d on its origin as w ell as other factors including raw m aterial fo rm u latio n an d m anufachire process. In some areas, y o g u rt is pro d u ced in the fo rm of a h ig h ly viscous liquid, w hereas in other countries it takes the form of a softer gel. Y ogurt is also produced in drinking form and can be frozen or

b le n d e d w ith other ingredients (e.g., m ousse type products, sorbets, yo g u rt ice cream ) (Early, 1998). The popularity of yogurt has increased significantly in

recen t years, especially in the W estern w orld.

M an iifacttirm g of yogurt In

W hole m ilk, skim m ed milk, partially skim m ed m ilk m ay be used.

O th er y o g u rt ingredients m ay include concentrated skim milk, non-fat dry milk, w hey, lactose (to increase the non-fat solids), sw eeteners, stabilizers, flavors and colors (w w w .foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu). T he starter culhire for m ost yogurts in N orth America is a sym biotic blend of Streptococcus thermophitus (ST) and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (LB). These culhires are u sed together in o rd er to hasten the rate of acid production. ST grow s faster and p ro d u ces acid and carbon dioxide, wlrich stim ulates LB grow th. other h an d , LB produces peptides and am ino acid for use b y ST. O n the These

m icroorganism s are ultim ately responsible for the form ation of flavor and texture. The y o g u rt m ixture coagulates during ferm entation due to the reduction in pH . The ST is responsible for the initial p H drop of the yogurt m ixture to -5.0; further decrease in the p H to 4.3 is due to the LB (Tamime and Robinson, 1999).

The essential steps in the m anufacture of fresh stirred and set yogurt are o u tlin ed in Figure 4. D uring yo g u rt m anufacture, m ilk is clarified and separated into cream an d skim milk, then standardized to acliieve the desired fat content. The various ingredients are then blended together in a mix tank equipped w ith a pow der funnel and an agitation system. The m ixture is then pasteurized, typically w ith a continuous plate h eat exchanger for 30 m inutes at 85°C. The h eat treatm ent, w h ich is m uch m ore severe than fluid milk pasteurization, is necessary to achieve the following; · Produce a relatively sterile and conducive environm ent for the starter culhire. · D enature and coagulate w hey proteins to enhance the viscosity and texture an d prev en t rapid w heying off. The m ilk is then hom ogenized. Besides thoroughly m ixing the stabilizers and other ingredients, hom ogenization also helps to prev en t cream ing and w h eying off d u rin g incubation and storage. enhanced by hom ogenization. o p tim u m grow th Stability, consistency and body are

A fterw ards, the inoculate is added at a 1:1 ratio of ST to LB to a jacketed ferm entation tank. A tem perature of 43°C is m aintained for 4.-6 hours u n d er quiescent conditions. This tem perature is a com prom ise bet^veen the optim al grow th tem peratures of the two bacteria (ST @ 39°C vs LB @ 45°C). The titrable acidity is closely m onitored until it reaches to 0.85 to 0.90%. A t this stage, the hot w ater jacket is replaced w ith cool w ater and agitation begins, both of w hich stops the ferm entation. The coagulated product is cooled to 4-25°C, depending on the type of product. Fruit and flavors m ay be added at this time, and then packaged. The p roduct is now cooled and stored at refrigerated tem perature (4°C) to slow dow n physical, chemical and microbiological degradation

(w w w .foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu). The above description is the m anufachiring procedure for stirred type yogurt. In set style, the yogurt is packaged im m ediately after inoculation w ith the starter and is incubated inside the container.

1.2.1.3

Ice cream Ice cream is a frozen m ixture of milk, cream, sweeteners, stabilizers,

em ulsifiers an d flavoring. O dier ingredients such as egg products, colorings and starch hydrolysates m ay also be added. This m ixture called the "mix", is

pasteurized and hom ogenized before freezing. Freezing involves rapid rem oval of h eat w hile agitating vigorously to incorporate air, thus im parting the desired sm oothness and softness of the frozen product (Marshall and Arbuckle, 1996). Ice cream is defined by governm ent standards as containing no less than
1 0

% (w/w) m ilk fat and as high as 16% in some prem ium ice cream brands,

betw een 9-12% m ilk-solids-non-fat, which contains proteins (caseins and w hey proteins) and carbohydrate (lactose) found in milk. Sweeteners, usually a

com bination of sucrose and glucose, based on corn syrup sweeteners, stabilizers and em ulsifiers represent 12-16% of the final w eight

(w w w .foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/icform .htm l).

1.2.1.3.1 Ice cream manufacture Ice cream processing operations can be divided into two stages - mix m anufacture and freezing operations, as show n in Figure 5. Ingredients are

chosen o n the basis of desired quality, availability and cost. The ingredients are b lended together prio r to pasteurization (Goff, 1997).

Ice cream m anufacture consists of several unit operations: com bination and b lending of ingredients, batch or continuous pasteurization, hom ogenization and ageing of mix. The m ix is first pasteurized, so as to kill pathogens th at m ay be present, nam ely; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus. Listeria monocytogenes, and others that cause hum an disease. In addition, the role of pasteurization in colloid developm ent is to m elt the fat for proper hom ogenization (Marshall and Arbuckle, 1996; and Goff, 1997). The mix is Üien hom ogenized, w hich forms the fat em ulsion b y breaking dow n or reducing the size of the fat globules found in m ilk or cream to less than 1 pm. H om ogenization is responsible for em ulsion form ation by forcing hot mix through a sm all orifice u n d er m oderate pressures, depending on mix

com position. In m ilk containing 3.5% fat, hom ogenization reduces the average diam eter of fat globule from 3.3 to 0.4 pm, decreases the m axim um diam eter from 10.0 to
2 .0

pm, increases surface area from 0.08 to 0.75 mVml, and. increases

the n u m b er of globules from 0.015 to 12/pm^ (M arshall and Arbuckle, 1996). The actual m echanism of fat disruption during hom ogenization is d u e to turbulence, cavitations and the velocity gradients created (Pandolfe, 1982). H om ogenization also helps to produce a smootlr product w hen frozen. A fter hom ogenization, ageing for about 4 hours at 2-4°C allow s fat to cool dow n an d crystallize, and for tire protein and stabilizers to fully hydrate (some

25

viscosity increase occurs during the ageing period), and to produce a sm oother and better quality p ro d u ct (Iversen and Pedersen, 1982). The w hip p in g qualities of the mix are also im proved w ith ageing. Following mix processing, the m ix is draw n into a m ixing tan k w here any liquid flavors, fruit purees, or colors are added. The mix tlren enters into a The barrel

dynam ic freezing process, w here a portion of the w ater freezes.

freezer is a scraped-surface, tubular heat exchanger, w hich is jacketed w ith a refrigerant such as am m onia or freon. Mix is pum ped through this freezer and is d ra w n off the other en d in a m atter of 30 seconds, (or 10 to 15 m inutes in the case of b atch freezers) w ith -50% of its w ater frozen. There are rotating blades inside the barrel th at keep the ice scraped off the surface of the freezer and as w ell as dashers that assist in w hipping the mix and w ith air incorporation. Ice cream contains a considerable am ount of air, u p to half of its volum e (called overrun), w hich provides the characteristic lightness of the product. As the ice cream is draw n, particulate m atter (fruits, nuts, candy, etc.) is added to the sem i-frozen slurry. Soft serve ice cream is draw n into cones at this stage, w hile h ard serve ice cream is packaged an d placed into a blast freezer at -20°C to -30°C for subsequent hard en in g (w here m ost of the remcdning w ater freezes). Below about -25°C, ice cream is stable for an indefinite period of tim e w ithout danger of ice

1.2.1.3.2 Ice cream m aking on industrial scale A typical m o d ern ice cream operation consists of a tw o-tank blending system a n d a dry-ingredient blender to com bine liquid and d ry m ix ingredients. D esired am ounts of dairy ingredients including milk, cream, condensed milk, skim or w hole m ilk can be com bined w ith sw eeteners b y volum e through tire use of m eters in the su p p ly lines. Stabilizers, emulsifiers, and sm all am ounts of other ingredients, such as w hey solid, m ay then be introduced through the dry in gredient blender. A dequate soak tim e m u st be provided to ensure com plete hy d ratio n and blending of the stabilizers, w hich usually takes 10 to 20 m inutes. The mix is tlren pum ped to the pasteurizer, w here it is pasteurized at 80°C for 25 sec. The m ix is tlren transferred to the mix storage tairk for ageing prior to

flavoring an d freezing. A ged mix is p u m p ed from the storage tanks to the flavor tanks, w here coloring aird flavoring ingredients are incorporated. The flavor tanks are

equipped w ith positive displacem ent p u m p s used as m eters to transfer controlled quantities of m ix to the tank. After flavoring, the m ix is p u m p ed to ice cream freezers an d the frozen ice cream is discharged to the fillers. Large ice

27

cream operations use continuous freezers, w hereas som e sm all operations and soft-serve ice cream m akers use batch freezers. ' After freezing a n d packaging, ice cream is transferred to a hard en in g room to com plete the freezing operation. The hardening room is m aintained at 25 to -30°C. A n u m b er of m echanized and autom ated h ard en in g system s have b ee n utilized to som e degree in the industry.

It is the pu rp o se of this research w ork to d ev elo p w ays of incorporating vitam in D to dairy products otlier than fluid m ilk, n am ely C h ed d ar cheese, y o g u rt and ice cream.

U preti et al. (2002) fortified pasteurized process cheese w ith vitam in Do. Results of this s tu d y show ed th at there w as no loss of vitam in Ds d u rin g cheese m anufacture, an d th at the vitam in w as uniform ly distributed w ithin the product. N o losses occurred' d u rin g storage of the fortified cheeses over a 9-m onth period at 21 to 29°C an d 4 to 6 °C. There w as a -25-30% loss of the vitam in w h en cheeses w ere h eated in an oven at 232°C. There w ere no differences betw een the w ater and fat-dispersible form s of the vitam in.

2.1.2 Yogurt N o research is currently available on the fortification of yogurt w ith vitam in Da. Fortification of yogurt by vitam ins is targeted at children and has been m arketed in som e countries, including Canada. The stability of vitam in A and C in y o g u rt w as evaluated by I tic and Ashoor (1988). The concentration of b o th vitam ins decreased d u ring storage. This effect w as m im m ized by using w ater-m iscible b eadlets of p-carotene (Parker, 1996).

T he relative availability of vitam ins in yogurt is m uch m ore difficult to assess because, unlike m inerals, m any vitam ins are sensitive to the conditions of processing. Thus, the m ethod of fortification, for example, the addition of m ilk p o w d er o r m em brane processing, the heat treatm ent of the m ilk base, the strains of starter bacteria u sed and the conditions of ferm entation can all alter the concentrations of the m ore im portant vitam ins (Noh et al, 1994). The

fortification of y o g u rt w ith vitam ins such as vitam in A and C is possible and losses o v er the period of two weeks storage are ~50% (Tamime and Robinson,

1999).
Som e relevant aspects of the vitam in content of yogurt have been reported b y Rao an d Shahani (1987). It is interesting to note tliat certain B group vitam ins are synthesized by the starter culhires. Kneifel et al. (1989) m onitored these

vitam ins in y o g u rt during ferm entation and observed that by using short (i.e. 3-4 hours) incubation at 42°C, the starter culture enriched the vitam ins during ferm entation by m ore than
2 0

%.

In the fortification of yogurt w ith vitam in Ds, vitam in Ds m ay be ad d ed to tire fluid m ilk prio r to pasteurization and p repared as outlined in Figure 6 .

STABILITY OF VITAM IN D
There is a question w hether vitam in D variability reported in the literature

is due to inconsistencies in fortification or to instability of the vitam in itself. Early studies on its stability in w ater and m ilk w ith a biological assay were rep o rted by Suppléé et al. (1936). They reported that propylene glycol solutions of vitam in D w ere unstable w hen diluted witia w ater, b u t stable w hen diluted w ith milk. M ore studies on the stabilit}'' of propylene glycol solutions diluted w ith m ilk w ere reported by H uber and Barlow (1943). Using bioassays, they found n o evidence of vitam in D deterioration in milk sam ples held for refrigerated condition. In canned condensed milk stored for
6 8

days at

m onths at 40'"C or

15 m onths at room tem perahire (~23°C), Renken and W arthesen (1993) found that vitam in D w as stable. Crem in and Pow er (1985) show ed that vitam in D w as unstable to oxidation, light, and acid. Kutsky (1981) reported that vitam in D w as unstable to oxidation and light, b u t stable to acid and alkali. Pike and Brow n (1984) reported that vitam in D w as unstable to irradiation and acid while rem aining stable to

oxidation and alkali. K reutler (1980) reported that vitam in D was rem arkably
stable and th at exposure to light, heat and oxygen. A lthough inform ation on tlie stability of vitam in D in foods is quite lim ited, the general assum ption is that its stability is high (Kilcast, 1994).

H ow ever, individual studies have provided quite contradictory data and it appears th at the stability of this vitam in is strongly dependent on the processing techniques used and the environm ental conditions (Matilla et al, 1999). In

addition, various research groups have reached different conclusions regarding the stability of vitam in D in foods. Tliis is perhaps due to inconsistent, and in som e cases, poorly-controlled analytical m ethods. M aw er and Gomes (1994) determ ined the contents of vitam in D and its m etabolites in raw and cooked m eat and found it to be very stable during cooldirg. O n the other hand, Bennink and Ono (1982) reported 35-40% losses

du rin g cooking. N o losses of vitam in D w ere found during pasteurization and sterilization of m ilk or during production of dried and evaporated m ilk (Davidek et al, 1990). Furtherm ore, exposure to air did not affect the stability of vitam in D in milk, b u t some losses occurred w hen the m ilk w as exposed to light (Renken an d W arthesen, 1993). The loss of vitam in D could be explained by oxidation reactions in w hich light acted as catalyst.

OBJECTIVES A N D HYPOTHESES
The objectives of tlie present study are: a) To fortify C heddar cheese, yogurt and ice cream w itli vitam in Ds. b) To develop reproducible m ethods for the estim ation and fortification of vitam in D s in C heddar cheese, yogurt and ice cream. c) To determ ine the retention of vitamin Da in these products during and after processing. d) To exam ine the stability and shelf life of vitamin Da in these products after fortification.

The hypotheses for the research study are as follows: Since vitam in Da is liposoluble, fortification should be straightforw ard in high fat products such as C heddar cheese (33-35% milk fat) and ice cream (10-16% milk fat). On the other hand, in plain low-fat yogurt, fortification m ay be ham pered. As vitam in Da is quite stable in fats, it is inferred tliat it will show veiy m inor or no loss over the certain period of storage time in C heddar cheese and ice cream com pared to the yogurt. However, it is possible that the effects of time,

tem perature and p H m ay provoke degradation of vitam in Da and these effects m ust be characterized.

Statistical analysis
O ne-w ay ANOVA and T-tests were used to assess statistically significant

differences in fortification, treatments, storage stability and yield.

Statistical

analyses w ere m ade at a level of significance of P < 0.05. A statistical analysis softw are (SPSS version 8.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) w as used to perform all statistical analyses (Appendix A1 and A2). The T-test for com paring group m eans is appropriate w hen the

indep en d en t variable consists of two levels of a variable (i.e., w hen there are tw o and only tw o groups). If w e have 3 treatm ents to com pare (e.g.. A, B, C) then 3 separate T-tests (com paring A w ith B, A w ith C, and B w ith C) w ould be required. W ith 7 treatm ents, 21 separate T-tests w ould be required. This w ould be tim e-consuming, but m ore im portantly, it w ould be inherently flaw ed because in each T-test, thre is a 5% chance that the conclusion is w rong (at alpha = 5%). W ith 21 tests, by probability, one test w ould give a false result. Analysis of

variance (ANOVA) overcomes this problem by enabling detection of significant differences betw een the treatm ents as a whole (Polit, 1996).

6.0 RESULTS A N D D ISC U SSIO N
The results of this sh id y w ill be presented and discussed in tw o parts. Section 6.1 focuses on the m ethodology developed for the determ ination of vitam in Ds in w hole milk, C h ed dar cheese, whey, yogurt, ice cream and the ice cream mix. Section 6.2 focuses on tlie recovery and stability of vitam in Ds in these dairy products.

6.1 M eth od ology d evelopm en t for vitam in Ds determ ination
V itam in Ds is usually determ ined in three different types of sam ples, nam ely h u m a n fluids, processed food and pharm aceuticals. The determ ination of vitam in Ds in foods, w hich can be liquid, semi-solid or solid in nature, is generally determ ined using conventional large-scale extraction m ethods, w hich consist of a solid-liquid extraction, followed by solid phase extraction. The

pro ced u re usually involves 3 m ain steps: saponification, extraction, and q uantitation via HPLC. Saponification followed by extraction is the m ost w idely u sed sam ple prep aratio n m ethod for fat-soluble vitam ins in food sam ples. Saponification rem oves the bulk of the fat and facilitates extraction b y releasing fat-soluble vitam ins from the food matrix. Factors to be optim ized in any

saponification m ethod are sam ple size, base concentration, saponification tem perature and time, com position of the saponified solution before extraction

and extraction solvents. Saponification can be carried o u t at h ig h tem perahire for a sh o rt p erio d of tim e or overnight at am bient tem perature. Selection of an antioxidant an d rem oval of oxygen b y nitrogen are also im portant. Fat-soluble vitam ins are sensitive to extrem e pH, oxygen, light and h eat (Turner et al, 2001). It is still quite com m on to use conventional large-scale extraction m ethods w h en analyzing vitam in D in foods. These m ethods are, how ever, laborious and consum e large am ounts of reagents (Upreti et al, 2002, R enken an d W arthesen, 1993, Sliva et a l, 1992, Beklrof and van den Bedem, 1988). There have been a few small-scale extraction reported, b u t these have been for the sim ultaneous extraction of [3-carotene, tocopherol and all-frans-retinol from dairy products (Indyk, 1988; Panfili et al, 1994), and not vitam in D. In term of solvents used, vitam in Ü3 has been extracted from food using different organic solvents such as petroleum ether, diethyl ether (Renken and W arthesen, 1993 and U preti et al., 2002), hexane (Sliva et al, 1992) and chlorobutane (Bekhof and van den Bedem, 1988). W hen this research w ork w as started, the m ost difficult task w as to find an ap p ro p riate m etlrod to extract vitam in Ds in C heddar cheese, yogurt and ice cream , as tlrere w as no existing m ethod. Several large-scale m ethods w ere

available for the extraction of vitam in D content from other d airy products (e.g., fluid milk, m ilk pow der, infant form ula, pasteurized process cheese), b u t no

Banville et al. (2000), w h o com pared different fortification m eth o d s for fortifying C h ed d ar cheese vcith vitam in D. H ow ever, they d id not re p o rt their extraction m ethod. Sam ples w ere likely analyzed by an outside laboratory. Selection of an effective extraction m ethod is probably the single m ost im p o rtan t factor in achieving h ig h perform ance an d reproducible results. Given the extraction m eth o d s for vitam in D reported in the literature, a new com er in this field is faced w ith the follow ing question: whicli extraction m ethod is the best for a given application? This question led u s to characterize the available extraction m ethods, so th at the m o st prom ising m ethods could be selected. G iven th a t several p ap ers published m ethods on the extraction of vitam in D from different foods, it w as im possible to evaluate all of th e available m ethods. Therefore, the three m ost com m on large-scale m ethods of vitam in D extraction from dairy p ro d u cts w ere considered. The first m ethod w as presented b y Bekhof and v an d en Bedem (1988) on the extraction of vitam in D in fortified m ilk, m ilk p o w d e r an d in fa n t form ula; the second m ethod w as rep o rted b y R enken and W arüresen (1993) on vitam in D estim ation in fortified fluid milk, an d the third m ethod w as d ev elo p ed b y U preti et al. (2002) for the extraction of vitam in Ds in p aste u rized process cheese.

u p r e ti et al. (2002) developed a m ethod to estim ate vitam in D s in p asteu rized process cheese based on the m odifications in the m eth o d of R enken an d W arth esen (1993), w ho estim ated vitam in D content in m ilk. V itam in D s w as estim ated u sin g alkaline saponification w ith KOH follow ed by extraction with p etro le u m ethertdiethyl ether (90:10 v/v) and HPLC in b o th m ethods. C hanges w ere m ad e in the saponification m ethod and quantities of chem ical reagents u sed , according to the estim ated fat content in the cheese, otherw ise the tw o m eth o d s w ere identical. In the m ethod of U preti et al. (2002), a 60% aqueous

K O H solution w as u sed to saponify the cheese sam ple at 70°C for 30 m inutes w h ereas in the other m etlrod (Renken and W arthesen, 1993), 5% aqueous KOH so lu tio n for skim m ilk sam ples and 35% KOH solution (w /v in 85% ethanol) for w hole m ilk sam ples w ere u sed w ith overnight saponification at am bient tem p eratu re (~23°C). O vernight saponification at am bient tem perature is a

p referred w ay of rem oving the fat com ponents (hrdyk an d W oollard, 1985), as it red u ces the therm al isom erization of vitam in D s to its previtam in form (K everling B uism an et a^., 1968). These m odifications w ere m ad e d u e to the high fat levels in cheese as com pared to the fluid milk, w hich requires a stronger K O H solution to h y d ro ly ze the fat content in the processed cheese.

den B edem (1988) rep o rted the overall recoveries of 93% and 91.4% in dairy sam ples, respectively. For this research w ork, w e required a m ethod that could be u sed for b o th types of products, liquid (fluid milk) and sem i solid products (C heddar cheese, y o g u rt an d ice cream). Thus, the m ethod of Renken and W arthesen (1993) for quantifying v itam in Da in the fluid m ilk and the m ethod of U pred et a l (2002) to d eterm ine v itam in D s in sem i-solid products w ere selected. The reliability of

the m eth o d of Renken an d W arthesen (1993) w as determ ined by extracting vitam in D s from w hole m ilk sam ples. It w as then decided to use the heated saponification m eth o d (U preti et al, 2002) instead of overnight saponification m ethod (Renken an d W arthesen, 1993) to speed u p the process of extraction and to get the sam ples analyzed quickly. Tw o types of fluid m ilk sam ples w ere analyzed using this m ethod, one fortified w ith crystalline vitam in Ds and other fortified w ith Vitex D . The sam e m eth o d of m ilk fortification w ith vitam in D s v/as used as discussed in sections 5.1.2 an d 5.1.3 for the fortification of milk.

6.1.1

M ethod developm ent The m ethod of Bligh and Dyer (1959) for total lipid extraction was

considered. This m ethod w as used for lipid extraction from biological materials, later m odified by Vieth and Fraser (1979), for the quantification of vitam in D in rat kidney m itochondria. Lipids are a diverse group of biological substances m ade u p prim arily of non-polar com pounds (triglycerides, digiycerides, m onoglycerides and sterols) and m ore polar com pounds (free fatty acids, phospholipids and sphingolipids). Given that lipids m ay bind other molecules, com bined w ith the ability of solvent m ixhires to solubilize different lipid classes, has led to the concept of "total lipid extract" and "extractable lipids". Solvents used for lipid extraction should have a high solubility for all lipid com pounds and be sufficiently polar to remove them from their binding sites.

C hloroform /m ethanol m ixtures apply well as w as recognized b y Folch et al. (1957). This approach w as adapted by Bligh and D yer (1959) resulting in a

chloroform to produce a biphasic system, the chloroform layer of w hich should contain the lipids an d the m ethanol-w ater layer w hich contains non-lipids. Hence, a purified lipid extract should be obtained w h en the chloroform layer is isolated. As vitam in Dr is a non-polar, liposoluble vitamin, it has a strong binding affinity w ith triglycerides and triglycerides, 0.36% diglyce 0.027% free fatty acids and C soluble in chloroform. C ow 's milk has 97.5% re-, .027% monoglycerides, 0.31% cholesterol,

. mtal phospholipids. Given this compositional

variety, m odifications w ere necessary to make this technique viable for vitam in D extraction in dairy products. In o rder to tackle this problem, an additional saponification step was incorporated prior to extraction. Saponification w as perform ed as p er Upreti et al. (2002). Secondly, quantification of vitam m D: on small-scale is difficult due to typically low vitam in Da concentrations found in foods. In large sam ples (-3550g), a sufficient concentration of vitam in D is present to be detected via HPLC (Parrish, 1979). To address this problem in sm all sam ples (Ig), high

concentrations of vitam in Da w ere incorporated into the fluid milk, and as a

result, into the cheese, yogurt and ice cream. Thirdly, a sam ple preparation step prior to saponification w as m ade w h en cheese, yogurt and ice cream samples w ere analyzed. The metlaod of Bligh and Dyer (1959) and Vieth and Fraser

(1979) can be applied to any sam ple containing 80% w ater content. Thus, in the extraction of m aterials that do n o t contain 80% w ater, it is necessary to add distilled w ater to the sample. Therefore, the semi-solid nature of C heddar

cheese, y o g u rt an d ice cream and ice cream mix required an additional sample preparation step b y adding distilled w ater prior to saponification to enhance vitam in Da recovery. The fluid m ilk and clieese w hey d id not require any

additional step of sam ple preparation, as m ilk contains -80% w ater. Different am ounts of distilled w ater w ere added depending on the type of product to be analyzed. This sam ple preparation helps to extract the analytes, so as to obtain a m easurable response in a chrom atographic system. W hen the proper

proportions of w ater are added to the samples, the system separates the chloroform layer from m ethanol-w ater layer. The proportions m ay be chosen in such a m anner that the low er layer will be practically 100% chloroform and the u p p er layer nearly all m ethanol-w ater. In sum m ary, the developed extraction procedure presented here is partly based o n som e previous w ork (Bligh and Dyer, 1959 and V ieth and Fraser, 1979 and U preti et a l, 2002).

In addition, the m ethod of Renken and W arthesen (1993) w as very laborious and time consum ing as it took 4-5 hours to process one sam ple due to die larger sam ple size and the m ultiple extractions w ith large volum es of organic solvents. In contrast, the

developed m ethod was rap id and cost effective, as it took only 2 hours to process a set of extraction experim ents sim ultaneously. This m ethod was also cost

effective due to low reagents consum ption and less labour cost required to process vitam in Ds extraction from the dairy samples.

Q uantification of vitam in Ds was done by reverse phase HPLC. In the case of vitam in D com pounds, the use of a UV detector is preferred as it allows the use of vitam in Ds as an internal standard for vitam in Ds (Mattila, 1995). V itam in Ds w as m easured w ith two absorbance detectors at 254 n m and 228 nm.

M oreover, p-

lactoglobulin (6-LG), p resen t in w hey, has a binding affinity w ith vitam in D s. W ang et al. (1997) rep o rted the affinity of p-LG to vitam in D s. M ost evidence points tow ard the calyx form ed by p-barrel in ti-LG as the h ydrophobic b inding site (Chen et a l, 1993, Cho et al, 1994 and Papiz et al, 1986).

O n the basis of the above studies and experim ental results obtained from this study, w e conclude th a t vitam in D s h as a strong b inding affinity w ith the C h ed d ar cheese m ass and also som e binding affinity w ith the cheese w hey.

Recovery data indicate that there was no loss of vitamin Da during the manufachire of yogurt (Table 6).
Conflicting reports have been published regarding factors affecting the stability of vitam in D during the m anufacture of fortified foods. C rem in and Pow er (1985) stated th at vitam in D was unstable to light, oxidation and acid w hereas K utsky (1981) reported that vitam in D is susceptible to oxidation and light b u t stable to acid and alkali. Pike and Brown (1984) observed instability of vitam in D to irradiation and acid. However, the stability of vitam in Ds in

yogurts has never been reported in the literahire. In view of all these factors, potential losses of vitam in D w ere assessed d u rin g the m anufacture of yogurt. D uring yogurt m anufacture, a -2-3% loss of vitam in Ds w as observed, this loss m ight have occurred due to the rapid decrease of p H from 6.7 to 4.3 during ferm entation. It show s that acid production probably h a d little effect on the stability of vitam in Ds during m anufacture as these results are w ell w itliin experim ental error.

stability of vitam in Ds in ice cream w as presum ably d u e to the storage tem perature (-25°C) and die fact that sam ples were n o t exposed to light. Low storage tem peratures play an im portant role in the stability of vitam in Ds in ice cream. Below -4°C aU chemical reactions start slow dow n and are m ostly halted at -25°C. On the basis of our results, it is concluded that vitam in Ds is very stable during storage; how ever, proper storage conditions should be m aintained.

7. CONCLUSIO N
The fortification and retention of vitam in D 3 in C heddar cheese, yo g u rt and ice cream was estim ated, using two forms of the vitam in - crystalline and em ulsified (Vitex D ). Over 90% retention was observed in C heddar follow ing fortification w ith either form. Low am ounts of vitam in D s w ere also recovered in the cheese w hey. Stability of vitam in D s in cheese sam ples differed in b o th form s of vitam in D s over a period of three m onths - stability w as higher in cheese sam ples containing Vitex D . In yogurt, there w as no detectable difference observed betw een both form s of vitam in D s follow ing fortification. V itam in D s w as stable in

experim ental yogurts d u rin g 4 weeks of storage at refrigerahon regardless of vitam in Ds type. Likewise, no vitam in Ds w as lost during tire m anufacture of ice cream w ith either form of the vitam m . Storage stability m onitored every w eek for up to 4 w eeks at -25°C show ed n o deterioration, suggesting ice cream m ay be an excellent vehicle to h'ansport vitam in D to tire consum er m arket. In conclusion, given the dem onstrated stability of vitam in Ds during storage, these fortified dairy products may play a prom ising role as a carrier for su p plying this vitam in to the C anadian population.
