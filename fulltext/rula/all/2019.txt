M utli-channel analysis of E EG signals were analyzed in th e project to detect alco holism. A digital signal-processing algorithm th a t autom ates the classification of

signals as norm al or alcoholic is studied here. The m ethod exploits the existing dig ital signal processing concepts such as signal modeling and spectral estim ation for feature extraction and classification. T he m ulti-channel AR modeling and C epstral theory were used for feature extraction. The EEG signals used in the project include 32 channels recorded from different portions of the brain for three m inutes duration. 25 signals of each subject were taken for analysis. A classifier is developed based on Linear D iscrim inant Analysis (LDA) and Leave-One-Out m ethod (LWO). The fea tu re extracted from all the signals are included in the database and have to reference vectors as ''norm al" or " abnorm al" signal. First, the feature vector was com puted using th e LDA m ethod. T hen by using Leave-One-Out A lgorithm (LWO), the signal features were classified based on the norm distances to maximize the accuracy. M ax imum Likelihood M ethod (MLM) or Euclidean distance is used to extract the norm distance betw een the signal under test and the reference vector. This was repeated for th e entire training database. The classifier thus obtained gave the overall accuracy ra te of th e system . T he accuracy rate obtained w ith A R coefficients is 72% and the accuracy ra te w ith cepstral coefficients is 62%

T h e purpose of this chapter is to provide an introduction and overview of th is project. T h e ch ap ter provides an intro d u ctio n to alcoholism, some background inform ation ab o u t th e E E G signals, m otivation and objective of this project. Finally th e ch ap ter concludes w ith a preview of th e report.

IN T R O D U C T IO N TO A L C O H O L ISM

Alcoholism is a chronic, often progressive brain disease w ith sym ptom s th a t include stro n g need to consum e alcohol despite negative consequences, such as serious h ealth problem s. Like m any oth er diseases, it has a generally predictable course, has rec ognized sym ptom s, and is influenced by b o th genetic and environm ental factors. It leads to m any p rem atu re deaths, disrupts th e life of m any people and also elevates yearly m edical bills. All b rain functions involve com m unication among nerve cells in th e brain. T his com m unication involves b o th 'sending' an d 'receiving' neurons th a t com m unicate very frequently across th em called synapses. Messages are carried across synapses

by chem icals called n eurotransm itters.

Alcohol physically changes it by affecting

com m unication betw een neurons like intoxication and sleepiness. A fter its release, a n e u ro tra n sm itter crosses th e synapse and activates a receptor protein in the receiving neuron. A ctivating a receptor can cause th e receiving neuron to change. Prolonged or re p e ate d exposure to alcohol can cause such changes in neurons th a t can lead to th e developm ent of alcoholism. Hence, alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. It depresses th e areas of the b rain th a t are norm ally inhibitory. A cute consum ption of alcohol causes occurrence of seizures in individuals.

A N O V E R V IE W O F EE G

E lectroencephalograph (EEG ) is a recording of th e electric signals produced by the brain. T h e presence of electrical current in the brain was discovered by an English physician, R ichard C aton in 1875 [1]. It was not until 1924 th a t H ans Berger, a G er m an psychiatrist, used his ordinary radio equipm ent to am plify th e b rain 's electrical activ ity so th a t he could record it on graph pap er [2]. Berger noticed th a t rhythm ic changes varied w ith the individual's sta te of consciousness. T h e p a tte rn of activity changes w ith th e level of a p erso n 's arousal - if a person is relaxed, th en the E E G has m any slow waves; if a person is excited, th en th e E E G has m any fast waves. E E G record is presum ed to represent only cerebral activity. In reahty, it includes other electrical activity th a t is not of cerebral origin. T he activity of th e brain is th e signal of prim ary concern, and any other activity th a t appears in th e record will deterio rate th e brain signal. These undesired activities are called noise or artifacts. A rtifact m ay m im ic abnorm alities so it is im perative th a t sources

B ut when the E E G is being interp reted , th e record m ay take on an entirely different appearance, in a different setting. Therefore it is essential th a t artifacts be clearly identified by th e technologist and labeled during th e tim e of recording.

1.2.1

EEG FEA TU RES

T h e variability in E E G signal occurs in two dim ensions nam ely tim e a n d am plitude. A m p litude is an index of voltage. T he larger th e am plitude, th e higher th e voltage. T h e voltages in E E G are extrem ely small. T he variability in tim e is expressed as frequency as shown in Figure 1.1. E E G reading involves th e in te rp retatio n of waveforms largely by th eir frequency an d to a lesser extent by th e m orphology of th e wave or of the wave com plex of several waves. E E G characteristics are defined by several criteria, some of which are (a) h e a lth of th e person, (b) age of th e person, (c) frequency of observed E EG activity.

(d) voltage of th e observed E E G activity, (e) am ount of activity, (f) reactiv ity of th e E E G to various stim uli. Based on these criteria, norm al an d abnorm al activity can be described. T h e quantification of E E G s included th e classification into four general frequen cies: A lpha, B eta, T heta, and D elta as shown in Figure 1.1 below. A lpha waves have relatively large am plitude an d m oderate frequencies. B eta waves are th e result of heightened m ental activity; typically show rapid oscillations w ith sm all am phtudes. T h e ta waves accom pany feelings of em otional stress, are characterized by m oderately low frequencies. D elta waves result from an extrem ely low frequency oscillation th a t occurs during periods of deep sleep.

1.2.2

D uring th e E EG test, a num ber of electrodes (small silver discs) are attach ed to th e head a t specific points using a conductive gel. T he doctors m ay use various procedures (hyperventilation, sleep) during th e te st to stim ulate th e b rain and trigger certain b rain waves. To o b tain the EEG , th e activity being produced under one electrode is com pared w ith th a t of another and p lo tte d o u t th e difference betw een th e two. As brain activity is co n stantly changing, th e signal is recorded over a period of time. In clinical practice, several channels of th e E EG are recorded sim ultaneously from various locations on th e scalp. T he signals thus recorded are in the analogue form at. T hen it has to

be converted to digital form at for applying the various signal processing routines developed using C om puter software.

D a t a set: All signals used in this project were acquired using th e intern atio n al electrode placem ent system w ith a sam pling Frequency of 256 Hz. T he d a ta set

consists of 50 signals w ith 25 alcoholic and 25 non-alcoholic signals. All signals are recorded for three m inutes duratio n and include 32 channels recorded from different p o rtio n s of th e brain. So there are about 45000 samples. Each file size is approxi m ately 5MB. Eye m ovem ent (closed/open) recordings are also included in th e evalu atio n signal set. Usually, there could be considerable redundancy in th e E EG , and it is n o t necessary to review every m inute of EEG.

1.3

E E G S IG N A L A N A L Y SIS

T h e E E G signals are inherently com plicated due to their non-G aussian, non-stationary, and non-linear in n a tu re [2]. O n to p of th a t th e sm all am plitude of these signals re inforce th eir sensitivity to various artifacts and noise sources. E E G signal usually consists of m ultiple sim ultaneous recordings w ith inform ation from several regions of th e brain. Previously, b o th single and m ultiple channel type of analysis were considered using signal processing techniques to ex tract desired in fo rm ation from EEG . T here are instances w hen only a single channel of recording is available. However, generally it is sta te d th a t m ultiple sim ultaneous recordings of the d a ta are required for inform ation to be ex tracted through signal processing. M ore over, th e signal of interest could be present in a num ber of channels of a m ulti-channel recording. T his would help to increase th e efficiency of detecting th e abnorm ality. O n th e other side, th e difficulty of isolating all channels of in terest is th en increased.

E E G depicts th e electrical signals generated on th e surface of th e b rain w ith o u t opening th e skull. It is a com pletely non-invasive procedure th a t can be applied

rep eatedly in patients, norm al adults, and children w ith no risks or lim itations. T he E E G te st is painless. It does not deliver electricity to p a tie n t's scalp; it only m easures electrical current th a t is detectable through th e skin of p a tie n t's scalp. An EEG

recorded during a seizure is th e best possible way to tell if a seizure is caused by abnorm al brain activity. However, th e E EG often is norm al betw een seizures m aking it difficult to reach a conclusive diagnosis.

A P P L IC A T IO N S OF EE G

T h e E E G is widely used in th e biom edical field for the detection and tre a tm e n t of b rain disorders, such as epilepsy. It is also used to diagnose th e presence and type of seizure disorders, confusion, head injuries, brain tum ors, and infections th a t affect th e b rain [3]. It is also used to evaluate sleep disorders and to investigate periods of unconsciousness. T he E EG te st m ay be done to confirm brain d eath in a patient.

E E G activity changes w ith functional sta tu s of th e brain such as in sleep, epilepsy [2]. F irst, th e do ctor exam ines th e com plete E E G record visually. T h is analysis is perform ed system atically. T he nex t phase is to decide w hether th e d a ta is norm al or abnorm al. If it is abnorm al, th e type of abnorm ality should be determ ined. In th is

process, com puters assist the doctor in m aking th e diagnosis of brain disorders easier [2]. T here are several ways to diagnose brain disorders using EEG. EEG Neurofeed back is one of them . It is a non-invasive technique th a t occurs in real tim e. T he inform ation collected is presented back to th e person so th a t they can see th e changes in th e electrical sta te of the brain. Using th is com puterized feedback technology, th e b ra in will get th e ability to learn and m odify th e electrical states, overcome deficien cies. T his was originally m eant for diseases like stroke and epilepsy. Now th is is also used for learning difficulties. Once th e brain is train ed in a p articu lar sta te , it is th en em bedded perm anently, ju st like learning to ride a bike.

As indicated, several b rain disorders can be detected using E EG signals in a noninvasive m anner. G om puter-aided diagnosis of the signal helps the chnician in de tectin g abnorm alities in a faster and less tedious m anner. By using a u to m ate d detec tio n th e length of hospital stay can be significantly reduced. T his project specifically focuses on alcoholism. Alcohol cravings and several uncontrolled alcohol ingestion are strongly associated w ith im balances in certain brain neuro-chem icals. T his im balance is reflected in

certain frequency ranges of th e E EG in various regions of the brain. T he E EG activity is described in term s of several variables w ith single and m ulti-channel recordings. To e x tra c t m axim um inform ation of interest from all regions of th e brain affected by the im balance, a m ulti-channel signal processing technique is chosen in the project. Again, different p a rts of th e b rain do not em it the sam e b rain wave frequency simultaneously.

8

So th e m ultiple channels ex tracted from different p a rts of th e b rain are analyzed concurrently for a period of tim e. C om pression an d auto m atic detectio n / classification of th e signal are th e different steps associated w ith th e project, and is described in detail later in th e rep o rt.

1.6.1

OBJECTIVE

T h e objective of th is p roject is to develop a m ulti-channel E EG signal analysis tech  nique to auto m ate th e process of detecting alcoholism. T he E EG signals are to be com pressed based on feature extractio n and classified using statistical p a tte rn analysis techniques such as Linear D iscrim inant Analysis using Leave One O ut Classification.

A n E E G is usually m easured as a continuous function of tim e which can be analyzed m athem atically. In experim ental E E G recording, it is often th e changes of frequency content th a t are of interest. E EG signals can be categorized into broad or narrow frequency bands by th e use of selective filters.

2.1.1

E E G S IG N A L A N A L Y SIS

Initially, th e in te rp retatio n of E E G records is done by visual inspection and depends on recognizing p a tte rn s an d th eir association w ith norm al or pathological conditions. T h e w idespread use of these m ethods is due to th e relative technical ease w ith which th e records can be m ade, th e low cost of interpreting m any records by visual in spection and th e lack of inform ation on th e relative m erits of other m ethods. B ut,

11

12

these trad itio n a l m ethods have some disadvantages. Different diseases m ay give rise to ap p arently sim ilar abnorm alities an d different interpretations m ay be m ade of th e sam e record. It m ay be th a t th e E EG does not contain any inform ation which would im prove its reliability and diagnostic value, b u t m any alternative m ethods of deriv ing and analyzing E EG are being tried. One includes m easurem ent and analysis

techniques and associated developm ents in instrum entation. An analogue to digital conversion is done to analyze th e signal using C om puter. D igital com puters are more efficient w ith a predeterm ined num ber of d a ta values. In this case, E EG can be ana lyzed q u antitatively in order to describe it num erically w ith im proved reliability. T he analysis can be based either on tem poral or spatial localization. T he clinical use of th e E EG depends on th e recognition of p articu lar waveforms having diagnostic significance, and the detection of focal E EG phenom ena th a t have a relationship to focal pathology. T he spatial distribution of E EG features over

th e surface of th e head is thus of great im portance. A num ber of techniques have been used for m easuring and displaying th e spatial characteristics. F irst, any of the m ethods already described for single-channel analysis is applied to each channel of a m ulti-channel record. T he second m ethod a tte m p ts to develop transform ations of th e E EG which indicate th e site and distrib u tio n of abnorm al p a tte rn s as contour m aps. A feature of th e sp atial distrib u tio n of E EG signals is th a t w hen a waveform is present over a large area of th e head, sm all tim e differences can occur a t different sites.

Generally, there are three m ethods for seizure detection in EEG . F irst is a p aram etric approach based on a nonlinear estim ation of m odel param eters for detection. T he two o th er m ethods are nonparam etric. T he spectrum technique introduced by G otm an [9] uses frequency analysis to determ ine the changes in the dom inant peak of the frequency spectrum of short epochs of E E G data. T he autocorrelation technique

in tro d u ced by Liu [11] perform s analysis in the tim e dom ain using short epochs of E E G d a ta . All these techniques are based on th e assum ption th a t th e E EG signals are sta tio n ary or as a m inim um locally stationary. Some m ethods Of processing EEG signals are given below.

2 .1 .3

H JO R T H A N A L Y S IS

T he q u an titativ e description of E EG signals has been classified by H jorth (1970) [4] in to two types: (a) to define descriptive qualities for the general characterization of an am plitude / tim e p a ttern , e.g. th e application of m ath em atical-statistical m ethods w hich also include frequency considerations; (b) to describe individual p a tte rn s or to d etect specific p a tte rn s which can be defined in advance. H jorth analysis - H jorth (1970) has developed a m ethod of EEG -signal analysis which he would p u t in his type (a) class. T hree param eters of an E EG signal are m easured for successive epochs of one to several seconds duration. Two of these

p a ram eters are obtained from th e first an d second tim e derivatives of th e am plitude flu ctu ations in th e signal. T he three p aram eters used by H jorth are as follows. T he first is called 'a ctiv ity ' and is th e variance of the am plitude fluctuations in th e epoch.

14

T he second is called 'm obility'. T he th ird param eter is the 'com plexity'. It is th e ratio of th e m obility of th e first derivative of th e signal to the m obility of th e signal itself. T hus, for each analysis epoch three num bers are obtained th a t are representative of th e p a ttern . H jorth shows th a t these param eters describe th e signal wave shape and are m athem atically related to th e power spectrum of the signal. T he value of th e H jo rth p aram eters is reduced if the signals have more th a n one m ajor peak in th e power spectrum . D espite th is and th e above lim itations, they represent an im p o rtan t approach to th e problem of quantifying th e E EG w ith a sm all num ber of descriptors.

2 .1 .4

A U T O -R E G R E S S IV E A N A L Y SIS

T he E E G is an unpredictable signal and it may have to be described by statistical p aram eters such as th e m ean and variance of the frequency sp ectru m from epoch to epoch. No m a tte r how much is known about how th e signal has fluctuated in am p litude up to th e present in stan t of tim e. A nother feature of this ty p e of signal is th a t p a rticu lar m easurem ent will not be th e same from epoch to epoch, even when recording conditions, th e sta te of th e subject are constant. As these features are a function of th e process generating th e signal, it m ay be m ore ap p ro p riate to derive a m odel of a generator th a t could produce them rath er th a n describe th e signal itself. T he o u tp u t of such a generator m ust have th e sam e statistical properties as th e signal, although th e waveform generated by th e m odel m ay look considerably different from th e signal from which the m odel is derived. Two m odels are often used (Hurwicz, 1962). T he first is called additive because it assum es th a t th e random ness in th e signal results from th e addition of random am plitude values to a periodic fluctuation. T h e signal will have a constant-am plitude periodic fluctuation. T he signal will have

15

a constant-am plitude periodic auto-correlation function. T he second is called a u to  regressive. T he am plitude value at any tim e in stan t has two p a rts or com ponents. One is correlated w ith all p ast values while the other is an added random p ertu rb atio n . As a result of this, th e signal will have an exponentially decaying periodic au to  correlation function (Dawson, 1953). It was found th a t EEG signals are m ore usually represented by the la tte r m odel th a n by th e former. In th e additive process, th e tim e of occurrence of peaks and troughs of the signal can be at th e tim e determ ined by th e periodic com ponent. T hus a disturbance changing the tim e of one peak will not affect th e tim e of th e next one. In th e case of the auto-regressive model, a disturbance which shifts th e tim e of a peak or trough alters the tim ing of all subsequent waves. T h e result of averaging would be th a t successive epochs ten d to cancel each other and th e average becomes m ore random and sm aller in am plitude as th e num ber of epochs is increased. T his is w hat happens w ith E EG signals. T he auto-regressive m odel is described in detail in the next chapter.

T here is not yet a satisfactory m ethod available for a clear determ ination of the op tim al order of an auto-regressive model. However, in this project the approxim ate m odel order is determ ined by calculating the approxim ate num ber of peaks above a certain threshold in the frequency dom ain of the signal. Linear tim e series analysis tools such as linear prediction is used for extracting the features in th e AR model. Hence, it compresses th e d a ta w ithout losing much clinical inform ation.

CEPTSTRAL THEORY

Cepstral theory is applied to the EEG signals since it is widely used in periodic signals for spectral evaluation. The steps involved in forming the cepstrum from an EEG signal is shown diagrammatically in figure 3.5.

Gepstral analysis provides a means of determining the poles, zeros, and high fre quency gain of the modeling filter which will help the spectral estimation of the signal. The word cepstrum was coined by reversing the first syllable in the word spectrum. The cepstrum is a decaying function of time which exists in a domain referred to as quefrency (reversal of the first syllable in frequency), which has units of time [7]. The complex cepstrum of a data sequence is defined as the inverse Z-transform of the complex logarithm of the Z-transform of the data sequence, i.e.

^ lo g { X { z ) ) z ^ ^dz.

(3.4.1)

The cepstrum of a signal is defined as the inverse Fourier transform of the log power spectrum of the signal. If the signal is stable (all the coefficients are inside the unit circle, in the complex Z-plane, the logarithmic transfer function ln(H(z)) can be expressed as:

32

M ln H {z) = c(z) = a z-\

(3.4.2)

:=1 There is a non-linear relation between the AR coefficients [3] th at links the AR coefficients with the cepstral coefficients. T hat is: Cl = -- ai, 2 = 1, (3.4.3)

^ k Ci = - ü i - ^ ( 1 - -)atQ _t, 1 < z < M i=i *

(3.4.4)

Fourier Transform is the natural way to separate the transfer function H(z) and the excitation component E(z) of the signal. This produces the cepstral analysis. In figure 3.5, a segment of a signal is extracted with a hamming window. The application of the Hamming window reduces discontinuity. For one segment of a channel of alcoholic EEG, the resulting (real) cepstral analysis is shown in figure 3.6. Usually, most of the detail occurs near the origin and in peaks higher up the cepstrum. Thus the lower numbered coefficients provide the envelope information. The remainder of the detail is mostly contained in the peaks which are separated by the pitch period and provide the fine detail pitch information. Also, the determination of the relative positions of two signals on the time axis with the help of cepstral analysis is characterized by higher immunity to signal fluc tuations th an a direct measurement of their positions. The cepstrum is also widely used in speech processing to deconvolve the periodic voiced excitation signal from the effects of the vocal tract.

AR and cepstral coejSicients can be used to extract features of the signal and the signals can be reconstructed using these few coefficients. One im portant factor in extracting signal features is to select the maximum amount of information useful for discriminating the main properties of the signal with the minimum number of coefficients. The model order is also an important parameter in order to extract all the useful properties of the signal. To summarize, this chapter achieved data reduction by selecting only the central channels of the EEG which contains the core information. Following that, a fixed segmentation was applied on those channels. Then by applying cepstral analysis and AR modeling on the segments, feature extraction was attained. This process was attained by using the MATLAB software.The classification of EEG patterns based on these features is the next step in the project.

C hapter 4 P A T T E R N C LA SSIFIC A TIO N
It is apparent th at reliable interpretation of the EEG requires detection and discrim ination between different waveforms or wave patterns. In the case of EEG, methods for detecting specific patterns have been developed largely on an empirical or intuitive basis. The information necessary to recognize the patterns is derived using feature extraction. The information must then be processed in some way so that the pattern of features correlating with particular disease states can be determined. In this work, p attern classification was applied to distinguish between the normal and alcoholic signals. This chapter presents the theory involved in the pattern classification of the multi-channel analysis such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, Leave-One-Out method in the project.

4.1

LINEAR D ISC R IM IN A N T ANALYSIS (LDA)

One way to decide the features associated with a particular disease state is to use a statistical technique called linear discriminant analysis [5]. Discriminant analysis is a m ethod for distinguishing patterns containing many features by maximizing the ratio of between the class variance to the within class variance in any particular d ata set,

35

36

thereby guaranteeing maximum seperability. This can be used for multivariate d a ta analysis. In this project, Alcoholic and Normal signals are separated as two classes. LDA performs a dimensionality reduction while preserving as much of the class discrimi natory information as possible. It computes a class-dependent and class-independent based transformation. Class-dependent LDA produces one transformation per class to discriminate th at class from all other classes. Class-independent LDA produces only one transformation to maximally separate all classes. Thus, LDA creates feature vector based on each class model, i.e. for alcoholic and normal.

4.2

LEAVE ONE OUT ALGORITHM (LWO)

The accuracy rate of the system, and the selection of the reference vector are per formed using the Leave One Out (LWO) method, which extracts in each stage of the loop one reference signal based on each of alcoholic and normal subject model to train the system and leave the remaining as reference vectors. Then, the objective is to extract and compare the distance between the input p attern vector and all the reference vectors. There are several distances th at can be used. The normal Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance and the maximum likelihood measurement (MLM) are some of them [6]. The M a x im u m L ik elih o o d M e th o d (MLM) (or Euclidean distance) is used to extract the norm th at calculates the distance between the signal under test and the reference vector. The spectral estimates obtained by MLM and AR signal modeling are related.

37

The MLM is the reciprocal of the sum of all N number of AR spectral estimates. The performance of the MLM is determined by both the mean and variance vectors of the feature. The performance of the MLM becomes poorer as features with high variability increase. The MLM distance most closely approximates the optimal Bayes classifier and obtains the best discriminative efficiency among the three proposed clas sifiers, if the probability density functions of the features extracted are multivariate Gaussian. Let X be the random variable that refers the feature extracted accord ing to one of the above feature extraction methods. Assuming that the Probability Density Function (PDF), P(X\wi), is multivariate Gaussian:

= -

^

(4.2.1)

W here V is the covariance m atrix and M is the average m atrix of the process. The discriminant function becomes:

4 (X ) = - j l n { 2 7 , ) - iin lK l - i [ ( X -

- M,)]

(4.2.2)

For all j the first term is the same, so it can be dropped from the study, so:

d j { X) = -ln \V i\ -h -[(X --M j) Vj

- M,-)],

(4.2.3)

which is the distance between input samples and references vectors th at has been used in the experiments.

38

This distance will be used to estimate how far from the reference groups each sample signal is located. The procedure th at has been followed using the ''leave one out" algorithm (LWO) is to use the same sample signal under test as reference vector. This algorithm is repeated for the entire training database. T h at is, LWO excludes each signal from the reference vectors in each turn. Then during each turn, the Maximum Likelihood Method again computes the distance or norm between the signals under test and some reference vectors selected previously w ith the LWO method. So, LWO method maintains independence between the results and the d a ta set, since each signal is excluded from the reference vectors in each turn. To summarize, the feature extracted from all the signals are included in the database and have to reference vectors as "normal" or ''abnormal" signal. When a test signal is extracted from the reference database, the MLM or Euclidean distance of the test signal to the reference groups is computed. This operation is repeated for all the signals in the database. If the distance of the test signal to the group it orig inated is less than the other group, it means th at it has been successfully classified. The purpose of this method is to obtain the overall accuracy rate of the classifier.

4.2.1

PA TTER N ANALYSIS OF EEG SIGNAL

P attern classification was achieved by obtaining the necessary differentiation between the alcoholic and non-alcoholic EEG signal features after the application of Linear Discriminant Analysis using Leave One Out Classification technique. LDA extracted the feature vectors based on the norm distances calculated using MLM and Euclidean distance. Finally, using the statistical based LWO method the signal features were successfully classified. This process was implemented using a statistical software

39

package called SPSS. The detailed description of the results from the classifier are given in the next chapter.

RESULTS U SIN G FEATURE ANALYSIS

The alcoholic EEG signals used in the project include 32 channels recorded from different portions of the brain for three minutes duration. The sampling frequency of the signal is 256 Hz. 25 signals of each subject (Normal and Alcoholic) were taken for analysis. The core channels (Fz, F3, F4, Cz, C3, 04, Pz, P3, P4, 01 and 0 2 ) which are closer to the center were considered for the multi-channel analysis. Eye movements recordings (channel # 3 1 and 32) were also inspected simultaneously. Spectral estim ation of these channels show distinct changes. For example, the variation in the horizontal eye movement recordings between the alcoholic and normal EEG signal can be seen from Fig. 5.1. The alteration in one of the central channels of the alcoholic and normal signal is visible in Fig. 5.2.

First, the feature vector was computed using the LDA method. Once the initial parameters of the feature extraction block were selected, a proper analysis was made using the LWO m ethod by comparing the features extracted to the group of normal signals and the alcoholic groups. In other words, LWO excludes each signal from the reference vectors

during each tu rn based on the distance or norm computed between the signals under test and some reference vectors using the Maximum Likelihood Method. This was repeated for the entire training database. Using LWO, the signal features based

on AR were classified based on the norm distances to maximize the accuracy. The classifier thus obtained gave the overall accuracy rate of the system. The accuracy rate obtained is 72%.The results obtained after the classification is shown in Figure 5.4. T hen the Cepstral based accuracy rate was obtained as 62% and the tabulated results are shown in Figure 5.5. The possibilities of this analysis are very high since the classifier extracts any fea tures using the LWO m ethod th at make the difference between normal and abnormal cells. Thus, the results obtained in this phase of the project confirms the objective outlined earlier.

Using the statistical software package called SPSS, the signal features were success fully classified based on the LWO method with an accuracy rate of 72% with AR modeling and 62% with Cepstral theory for the cross-validated data set. This is ac quired from a d ata set of 50 signals. The results could be improved by applying the process to a different set of data with a longer period. The original grouped cases were classified correctly as alcoholic and non-alcoholic with 100% accuracy using both Cepstral and AR modeling. Overall, this is a powerful method th at can extract in form ation th a t is not apparent from single-channel temporal based analysis. The process in the project can extract information using multiple channel analysis with

46

reasonable accuracy from channels closer to the center of the scalp and the eye move m ent recordings. This m ethod preserves the spatial information and is encouraged to further explore to improve the precision. Another multichannel analysis technique called SLEX analysis could be combined with this to improve the accuracy of the classifier.
