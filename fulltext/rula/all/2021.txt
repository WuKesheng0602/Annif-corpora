ABSTRACT PHOTOLYTIC AND PHOTOCATALYTIC TREATMENT OF LINEAR ALKYLBENZENE SULFONATE IN WATER M aster of Applied Science, 2004 Sarah Rebecca Hatfield Venhuis Environmental Applied Science and M anagement, Ryerson University Treatment of linear aikylbenzene sulfonate using various photolytic and photocatalytic processes is described. Based on first order rates, it is shown that 5,000 mg/L of H2 O2 for degradation o f a 100 mg/L solution of linear aikylbenzene sulfonate is optimum. Two different photocatalysts, Degussa P25 and Hombikat UV 100 Ti02, are used to degrade LAS in slurry batch reactors. The optimum photocatalyst loading for Degussa P25 is 4.0 g/L while for Hombikat UV 100 2.0 g/L. The photoactivity for Degussa P25 is higher than UV 100 for treatment of LAS since >20% adsorbs to the surface of the UV 100 photocatalyst. Combination of photocatalysts does not improve degradation rates in batch tests. Combination of Degussa P25 and 600 mg/L H2 O2 and irradiation with either UV light at 254 or 365 nm does not improve degradation rates over the photocatalytic or photolytic processes individually. Photolysis of LAS with UV light at 254 nm and 600 mg/L H2 O2 added at different time intervals was not successful and no improvement in the first order rate constant was observed. For optimum results, the hydrogen peroxide was added at the beginning of irradiation.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

Surfactants are depended upon worldwide as cleaning agents. Their usage in such large quantities means that the waste and the potential for pollution is high. Many studies have been done over the last three decades encompassing treatment alternatives for both biodegradable and non-biodegradable surfactants and the environmental impact. It is accepted that surfactants pose a threat to the aquatic environment. Surfactants are used on a large-scale basis in everyday household use, industrial cleaning, and textile manufacturing. It has been well documented that surfactants make up a large percentage o f refractory COD in municipal wastewater treatment and in traditional septic-tile bed system effluents. One problem that is a result o f surfactant pollution is the ability o f surfactants to increase the solubility o f other toxic organic compounds when adsorbed to sewage sludge that is applied to land. Increased solubility can have a negative impact on sludge dewatering characteristics at municipal wastewater treatment plants. M any methods have been employed for the treatment o f surfactants including chemical treatment (flocculation and coagulation followed by settling) adsorption, advanced oxidation processes including Fenton's and photo-Fenton's treatment, addition o f H 2 O 2 and biological treatment. Chemical treatment often produces undesirable by-products such as biological or inorganic sludges and in some cases, toxic intermediate compounds. Advanced oxidation processes such as TiOz/UV, irradiation with low wavelength UV light (254 nm), hydrogen peroxide combined with UV and ozone do not produce sludges and can be less expensive therefore providing significant advantages. Although ideal, complete

mineralization of organic compounds is not feasible due to the high-energy requirement. However, use of advanced oxidation processes to degrade surfactants to compounds that do not have surfactant properties has potential.

1.1 Objectives The objectives of this research were to investigate the feasibility o f photolysis and photocatalysis as methods for degrading a model surfactant compound. The compound chosen for this study was linear aikylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), a commonly used additive to both household and industrial detergents. Treatment processes tested include TiOz combined with UV-A light, UV-C, and UV-C combined with hydrogen peroxide. The following research was completed to study the potential for these processes to degrade LAS: (1) Photolysis of LAS with UV-A and UV-C (2) Degradation and mineralization of LAS using UV-C and UV-C combined with hydrogen peroxide. (3) Degradation and mineralization of LAS with UV-A combined with one o f two types of TiOz (4) Investigation of combined processes a. UV-C with H2 O2 added at different times b. UV-A w ith mixtures of P25 and Hombikat UV 100 TiOz (5) Degradation of common detergents under optimum conditions.

It has been documented that surfactants make up a large percentage of refractory chemical oxygen demand (COD) in municipal wastewater treatment and in traditional septic-tile bed system effluents. Other problems that are a result of surfactant pollution include the ability of surfactants to increase the solubility of other toxic organic compounds when adsorbed to sludge, and surfactants can have a negative impact on sludge dewatering characteristics at municipal water treatment plants. Two suggestions for reducing surfactant pollution include dispensing only the quantity required of the major components for a particular wash cycle or to use environmentally friendly detergents (Hack, 1991). The following is a review o f the recent literature reporting advances in treatment of surfactants using advanced oxidation processes. Health effects, environmental impact, and the treatment of linear aikylbenzene sulfonate (an anionic surfactant) and alkylphenol ethoxylates (a nonionic surfactant group) including their metabolic products are discussed.

2.3 Fate and Environmental Impact of Surfactants

2.3.1 Fate and Environmental Impact of Linear Aikylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS) Linear aikylbenzene sulfonate, the primary surfactant in liquid household detergents, has been found both in rivers that receive municipal effluents and in drinking water supplies. In wastewater treatment, more than 99% of LAS is removed while the remaining LAS is released into surface waters. Organisms living near sewage outfalls potentially can

bioaccumulate LAS (Tolls et al., 2000). In Taiwan, less than 5% o f the population's wastewater is treated and concentrations o f 135 pg LAS/L have been found downstream from raw sewage outfalls in the Lao-Jie river (Ding et al., 1999). As well, it has been documented that LAS makes up 0-488 mg/kg o f the total dry weight o f sewage sludge and may influence microbial activity o f the soils. Another study reported a mean LAS concentration o f 530 mg/kg and a maximum o f 16000 mg/kg (dry weight) (Holmstrup and Krogh, 2001). Elsgaard et al. (2001) studied the impact o f LAS on agricultural soils that were amended by sewage sludge. They found that the short-term effects varied with LAS concentration and incubation time. As well, a previous study by Elsgaard et al. (2001) showed that LAS has the potential to inhibit biological activity. The data suggested that a terrestrial risk assessment based on short-term effects o f LAS completely describes the potential risk when LAS contaminated sewage sludge is applied to agricultural land. Holmstrup and Krogh (2001) found that LAS in concentrations greater than 40-60 mg/kg had toxic effects on reproduction and growth o f soil invertebrates. They found that earthworms and enchytracids were four times more sensitive to LAS than springtails and mites. A study by Gejlsbjerg et al. (2001) showed that LAS is rapidly mineralized (complete degradation to CO 2 and water) in the aerobic part o f the sludge-amended soil. Another study by Holmstrup et al. (2001) tested the toxicity o f LAS to the Collembolan (Folsomia fimetaria) and the earthworm (Aporrectodia caliginosd) and concluded that neither the chemical characteristics of the LAS or type o f soil have a large impact on toxicity. Kimerle and Swisher (1977) demonstrated that partial degradation o f LAS was effective in reducing the toxicity to water fleas {Daphni magrta) and fathead minnows (Pimphales promelus). Alternatively, Jensen et al. (2001) found that LAS does not pose a risk to fauna, plants, and

essential functions o f agricultural soils as a result of regular sewage sludge application. Mortensen et al. (2001) found that plant growth was stimulated by LAS biodégradation in sludge-amended soils. A study of the migration of LAS in soils based on the effects of freeze-thaw and wet-dry cycles on the formation of macropores showed that LAS was more mobile when these macropores were present (Ou et al., 1999). Studies have shown

that LAS is toxic to anaerobic digestion processes. Mosche and Meyer (2002) studied the inhibition of propionate and acetate in the presence of 14 and 27 mg/L LAS. They found that 14 mg/L LAS caused a 50% inhibition of acetate degradation while 27 mg/L LAS was sufficient to cause a 50% inhibition in propionate degradation. This study concluded that the optimization of anaerobic processes is highly dependent on understanding how surfactants have an effect, especially in industrial wastewaters that have high surfactant loadings. LAS pollution can also be because of onsite sewage systems that are not functioning properly. Nielsen et al. (2002) showed that LAS degradation exceeded 96% for an onsite system that had been in operation for 25 years (this site was chosen for its potential as a worst case scenario). Although these results show that LAS is fully biodegradable in onsite sewage treatment systems, it is important to note the functional operation varies widely due to installation, climate, and maintenance practices. They concluded that the mechanisms of removal were most likely due to biodégradation and sorption.

2.3.2 Environmental Concentrations of Surfactants Alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEO) are non-ionic surfactants used as detergents, emulsifiers, wetting agents, stabilizers, defoaming agents, are intermediates in the synthesis o f anionic surfactants, and are used as institutional and industrial surface cleaners

' (Takasu et al., 2002). APEOs are also used in the preparation o f phenolic resins, as heat stabilizers, in polymer production and as antioxidants (Ying et al., 2002). 55% o f APEOs manufactured are used in industrial applications other than as cleaning products, 30% are for industrial and institutional cleaning products, and 15% are manufactured for household cleaning products (Ying et al., 2002). APEOs have been found in air (0-81 ng/m^), surface waters, sediments, and in wastewaters. Tables 2.4 and 2.5 outline the concentrations found in these environments.

Ying et al. (2002) concluded that APEOs and their metabolites are "ubiquitous in the environment" due to their widespread use and lack o f adequate treatment. Bennett and Metcalfe (2000) stated that APEO distribution is localized in area close to the point o f discharge o f sewage treatment plant effluent. A Dutch study o f various surfactants in raw sewage, settled sewage, effluent and in primary removal gave the following results

Overall, the concentration in sewage treatment plant effluent is dependent of treatment efficiency and plant design (Ying et al., 2002). Feijtel et al. (1999) studied the 90'*' percentile surfactant concentrations 1 kilometre downstream from a sewage outfall by using information obtained on release, removal in sewer, treatment efficiency, in-stream removal and dilution in the Netherlands. Figure 2.0 shows the surfactant or soap concentration versus the in-stream removal rates. For all compounds, the lower the concentration, the higher the removal rate was observed.

2.4. Fate and Environmental Impact of Alkylphenol Ethoxylates (APEOs)

^ k

APEOs include nonylphenol ethoxylates with varying ethoxylate chain length. Entry into the environment is a result of anthropogenic activity since these compounds are not naturally produced. The majority of APEOs are introduced to the environment through wastewater treatment plant effluent in both the liquid and sludge forms and in pesticide application (Ying et al., 2002). These compounds have also been identified as a result of pollution from onsite systems (Rudel et al., 1998). A study by Nielsen et al. (2002) showed that more than 99% of APEOs were removed in an onsite system that had been in use for 25 years. McAvoy et al. (2002) developed a model to predict the fate of alcohol ethoxylates and alcohol ethoxylate sulfates in onsite sewage treatment systems. La Guardia et al. (2001) concluded that APEO degradation products in biosolids might cause a negative environmental impact in the U.S.A. as a result of widespread biosolids application. APEOs are of environmental concern because their biodégradation leads to more toxic and persistent compounds that may have estrogenic activity (Giger et al., 1981; LaGuardia et al., 2001; Jobling and Sumpler, 1993; Miles-Richardson et al., 1999). Their toxicological properties are influenced by the number of ethoxylate (EG) units. APEOs with short EO chains (less than four) are lipophilic and may lead to bioaccumulation or bioconcentration and those with greater than ten EO units are hydrophilic. Generally, the toxicity of APEOs increases as the number of EO units decreases (Takasu et al., 2002). Ekelund et al. (1990) studied the bioaccumulation of 4-nonylphenol (a primary metabolite of NPnEOs) in marine animals and found that bioconcentration factors exceeded those previously published for fish and mussels. The bioconcentration factor for fish was determined to be 1300 (5 times greater than published values) and 3400 for mussels (340

10

times greater than published values). McLeese et al. (1981) determined that the lethal thresholds for alkylphenols in aquatic fauna decrease with increasing Kow and the bioconcentration factor increases with increasing Kow in salmon. Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs) and their primary degradation products were measured in sediments in the Straight o f Georgia, B.C. near a municipal outfall. It was calculated that 30 tonnes o f NPnEO have been deposited in the Fraser River Delta Sediments while nearly 170 tonnes have been deposited in the entire Straight o f Georgia (Shang et al., 1999). Ferguson et al. (2001) studied the fate o f various alkylphenol ethoxylate metabolites in Jamaica Bay, Long Island, New York, and found concentrations o f 0.05-30 ng/g of NPnEO (nonylphenol ethoxylate with n ethoxylate groups) and 0.007-0.040 ng/g o f octylphenol ethoxylate metabolites in sediment. Maguire (1999) reported that some o f the degradation products o f NPEOs are not readily biodegradable under anaerobic conditions. A study by Hawrelak et al. (1999) on the fate o f alkylphenol ethoxylate primary degradation products in paper sludge spread onto farmers' fields showed that the concentration decreased by 84% over a 14-week period. They found an indication o f recalcitrant nonylphenol isomers but concluded that more research needs to be done to assess the risk o f APEO degradation products in these sludges used as soil amendments. W ater treatment processes available to municipal wastewater treatment plants are not always suitable for the removal o f surfactants at low concentrations. The treatment o f surfactants at the pollution source has many advantages including higher concentrations and the availability o f more specialized treatment techniques such as advanced oxidation processes.

2.5 Influential Factors in Surfactant Toxicity

In the literature, there are many conflicting studies of the toxicity of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in the aquatic environment. Many ecotoxicological studies have been conducted under laboratory conditions and do not sufficiently represent the varying water conditions in the water column. The main pathways responsible for LAS removal in the natural environment are biodégradation, adsorption, and precipitation. A study of the influence of Ca^^ to the toxicity of LAS on algae {D. Magna) showed that the toxicity of LAS increased with alkyl chain length and an increase in water hardness. Concentrations of LAS ranged from 33-335 mg/L as water hardness (as CaCOa) was varied from 200-2000 mg/L. Water hardness was found to stress D. Magna, thereby increasing LAS toxicity (Verge et al., 2001). This is just one water parameter that varies widely in the environment. The results of this study indicate that controlled laboratory toxicological tests are not a suitable indication of toxicity in the aquatic environment due to these varying parameters. Rosen et al. (2001) studied the relationship between interfacial properties and toxicity of several surfactants including octyl-, dodecyl-, tetradecyl-, hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride, octyl- and decyl-dimethyl-2-hyrdroxy ethyl ammonium chloride, and LAS. This study was completed using an immobilized artificial membrane and Rosen found that surfactant toxicity is primarily a function of the ability of the surfactant to adsorb and penetrate the cell membrane of aquatic organisms. Dyer et al. (2000) studied the structure-activity relationship for both acute and chronic toxicity of a variety of alcohol ether sulfates on Ceriodaphnia dubia. Acute toxicity was found to increase with alkyl chain length and decrease with an increasing number of ethoxylate units. Chronic toxicity tests were done using Brachionus Calyciflorus. Chronic toxicity was found to be related to the percentage of

12

the molecular surface associated with atoms possessing partial negative charges and with increasing length o f ethoxylate chain. Tolls et al. (2000) studied the bioconcentration o f alcohol ethoxylates in fathead minnows (Pimphales promelas) and concluded that it was dependent on alkyl and ethoxylate chain lengths. The bioconcentration factor ranged from less than 5 to 1660 L/kg/day. Metcalfe et al. (2001) studied the estrogenic potency o f alkylphenol ethoxylates and their metabolites on the Japanese Medaka. They found that the environmental concentrations o f nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOl and N PE02) were not within the range o f estrogenic activity. Spengler et al. (2001) studied the NPEO metabolic compounds in effluents o f sewage treatment plants. NPEOs are metabolized to 4-nonylphenol, 4-nonylphenoxyacetic acids and 4-nonylphenoldiethoxylate, and all are known to have estrogenic effects. Korner et al. (2 0 0 1 ) tested the estrogenicity o f sewage treatment plant effluent and concluded that these effluents are a major source o f estrogenic substances in the environment. STP outfalls are a perpetual source o f these types of compounds. Bjerregaard et al. (2001) studied the presence o f LAS in the environment close to sewage treatment plant outfalls. The concentration o f LAS in sewage treatment plant effluent was in the range o f 0.02-1.0 mg/L, which is in the range reported to have a physiological impact on marine life. This study reported that LAS can damage fish gills, cause excess mucus secretion, decrease respiration in the common goby, cause a reduced settling rate, and change swimming patterns in blue mussel larvae. LAS was found to disrupt the ionic homeostasis o f epithelial cells (these cells form the outermost barrier between the organism and the environment). Tolls and Sum (1999) found that biotransformation o f octaethylene glycol monotridecyl ether in fathead minnows played an important role in reducing the

13

biôbbncentration potential of this surfactant. Jorgensen and Christoffersen (2000) studied acute effects of LAS on freshwater plankton in field conditions. Different types of freshwater organisms were examined including bacteria to crustaceans. It was concluded that LAS has a negative impact on the survival of heterotrophic nanofiagellates and ciliates at very low concentrations. The no-effect concentration was found to be lower in field tests than for similar organisms tested under laboratory conditions. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) are often used in environmental risk assessment. PNEC values vary widely for the same surfactant. Table 2.6 shows some PNECs for common surfactants.

Fenner et al. (2002) proposed a method for the application of risk assessment employing ratios of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) and predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) to mixtures of surfactants and their metabolites. It was foimd that the two main factors influencing the risk assessment of the chemical in question are consideration o f metabolites and/or the number of metabolites considered. Feijtel et al.

14

(2 0 0 0 ) studied predictive exposure modeling and concluded that to understand the fate o f chemicals in the environment, it is important to remember that these models do not fully represent the real world although they can provide important statistical distributions o f concentrations. It has been demonstrated in the literature that the widespread usage o f surfactants has led to many environmental concerns. Treatment options play an important role in the protection o f environmental resources.

2.6 Surfactant Treatment The following section reviews o f the various advanced oxidation processes that have been tested or used to treat surfactants.

2.6.1 Biodégradation of Surfactants Biodegradability o f organic pollutants is a desired property because o f the relative ease o f removal from waste streams. Toxicity can be reduced or eliminated by biodégradation. Often, biological organisms can completely mineralize pollutants, producing carbon dioxide and water. In the following, the biodegradability o f alkylphenol ethoxylates and LAS are discussed.

2.6.2 Biodégradation of Alkylphenol Ethoxylates (APEOs) Jones and Westmoreland (1998) conducted a study o f nonylphenol ethoxylate degradation during sludge composting. The NPEO-contaminated water was a result o f the washing o f raw wool. This wash water typically is ten times more concentrated than conventional sewage.

15

Ustiallÿ, this wash water is treated using a chemical flocculation process and the sludge ends up with all of the surfactants from the detergent. This sludge was composted and it was shown that 14 weeks was sufficient to reduce the NPEO concentration by more than 96%. Rudling and Solyom (1974) studied the biodegradability of branched NPEOs and showed that there was no significant difference among the biodegradability of NPEOs containing
8

to

30 ethoxylate groups. It was also shown that the removal of NPEO was greater than 90% in activated sludge processes with no prior acclimatization, operating under plant conditions. The biodégradation of NPEOs and LAS (among other organic compounds) in sludgeamended soils was studied (Gejlsbjerg et al., 2001 and Gejlsbjerg et al., 2003). It was concluded that nonylphenol ethoxylates are mineralized in aerobic soil compartments (Gejlsbjerg et al., 2001). It was also determined that as the concentration of NPEO (2 ethoxylate groups) was increased in sludge amended soil, the relative maximum mineralization rate decreased and resulted in an increase in lag times (Gejlsbjerg et al., 2003). Biodégradation of alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs), alkyl ethoxylate sulfates (AESs), LAS, and primary metabolites in activated sludge treatment was reviewed by (McAvoy et al., 1998). Alcohol ethoxylates (AE) and alcohol ethoxylate sulfates (AES) were removed with an efficiency of 98% and 97%, respectively. Trickling filter treatment resulted in removal efficiencies for AE, AES and LAS to be 79-99.7%, 69.7-98.2%, and >99%, respectively. Battersby et al. (2001) reported AE removal during activated sludge treatment to be >99% based on measured levels in the influent sewage and the treated effluent. It was estimated that biodégradation was responsible for greater than 98.7% of the removal and the remainder adsorbed to the biomass. During winter operation, biodégradation was responsible for greater than 97.2% o f AE removal (Battersby et al., 2001). Marcomini et al. (2000) suggested that

16

the alkyl chain length o f alcohol polyethoxylates controlled the biodegradability rates and pathways. The half lives o f APEOs in acclimated sewage treatment plant sludges for ultimate biodégradation was one to four weeks (Staples et al., 2001). Anaerobic degradation o f alcohol sulfates was dependent on the surfactant-to-biomass ratios. A low surfactant-tobiomass ratio was important for efficient biodégradation. In addition, processes that result in acidification o f the wastewater prior to anaerobic treatment improve degradation and allow for a higher surfactant-to-biomass ratio without causing inhibition (Feitkenhauer and Meyer, 2002). Biodégradation o f alcohol ethoxylates by native soil microbes was studied (Ang and Abdul, 1992). In-situ surfactant washing is a process for cleaning contaminated soil and ground water systems. For example, a site with soil contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can be injected with a surfactant solution to enhance the mobility o f the PCBs and, therefore, the biodégradation. This ultimately leaves the surfactant in the soil. The study was conducted in order to assess the ability o f native soil microbes to degrade the surfactant. It was found that alcohol ethoxylate is readily biodegradable by indigenous groundwater and soil microbes under laboratory conditions. The rate o f surfactant degradation was enhanced by adding nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen.

2.6.3 Biodégradation of Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS) Rittmann et al. (2001) studied the biodégradation of LAS in activated sludge treatment, the importance o f sludge adaptation, and mass transfer in the biodégradation process. A model was developed to analyze the effects o f adsorption and biodégradation kinetics on the fate o f LAS in batch experiments with activated sludge adapted to different initial LAS

17

concênfràtioris. It Was shown that in batch experiments the mass transfer kinetics were sufficiently slow so that equilibrium was not reached and, therefore, the long-term biodégradation of LAS was limited by the increasing availability of LAS fi-om the unavailable LAS over time. McAvoy et al. (1998) reported that LAS removal during activated sludge treatment was greater than 99% while in a trickling filter was 72.2-98.6%. Boeije et al. (2000) built a pilot scale trickling filter to test LAS degradation and to develop a model for chemical fate in trickling filters. Krueger et al. (1998) studied the biodégradation of LAS in sewage-contaminated groundwater over a range of dissolved oxygen concentrations. This study concluded that the rate o f biodégradation increased with increasing alkyl chain length. Removal rates were found to be two to three times higher in laboratory experiments than those in field tests. Doi et al. (2002) investigated the sorption and biodegradability of LAS in three soil types below an onsite sewage system drain field. It was concluded that the rate of ultimate biodégradation of LAS decreased with increasing distance vertically below the surface of the ground. Percent mineralization of LAS was found to be 49.8% and 83.4% during test periods of 45 or 59 days, respectively. McAvoy et al. (2002) studied the applicability of a model developed to predict the fate and transport of surfactants in onsite wastewater treatment systems. The model takes into account adsorption and biodégradation effects on the transport of surfactants through the treatment system. It was found that the model under-predicted the LAS concentrations in groundwater down gradient from the disposal field since the groundwater beneath the disposal bed was sometimes anoxic. In addition, it was determined that the

18

biodégradation o f LAS was faster under fully oxygenated laboratory conditions than that in the field. Branner et al. (1999) studied the degradation o f LAS in soil columns under water-saturated conditions. It was found that primary degradation was close to 100% while mineralization only occurred up to 9%.

2.6.4 Biodégradation of Ditallowdimethyl Ammonium Chloride (DTDMAC) The biodégradation o f ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride, a cationic surfactant by activated sludge has been studied (Sullivan, 1983). DTDMAC is commonly used as a fabricsoftening agent. The biodégradation of DTDMAC was determined in semi-batch activated sludge reactors. It was found that extended periods o f aeration resulted in improved degradation rates. Although metabolites o f DTDMAC were observed, they did not persist in the sludge. It was concluded that DTDMAC removal is a result o f sorption, precipitation, and biodégradation mechanisms.

2.7

Treatment o f Surfactants Using Various Advanced Oxidation Technologies and

Separation Techniques In this section, the treatment o f various surfactants including alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs), alcohol ethoxylates (AEs), and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) by advanced oxidation processes including TiOz/UV, wet air oxidation, sonochemical treatment.

19

2.7.1 Wet Air Oxidation of Surfactants
In a study o f the applicability of wet air oxidation (WAG) o f various organic pollutants, Dietrich et al. (1985) outlined the basics of the process. WAG is suitable for the treatment of organic or inorganic pollutants dissolved in water. WAG is dependent on high temperatures and pressures operating in the range of 174-320 °C and 2169-20708 kPa, respectively. At high enough temperatures and pressures, the solubility of oxygen increases and provides the driving force for oxidation. In the Deitrich study, the source of oxygen was either compressed air or pure oxygen under pressure. The high pressures are required to keep the water in a liquid state and also serve as a catalyst. WAG provides the same oxidative ability as flame combustion but at much lower temperatures. Mantzavinos et al. (2001) studied the WAG of LAS and its effects on the biodégradation of LAS. The experiments were semi-batch with 1000 mg/L LAS at 473 K, O2 partial pressure of 1.3 MPa and a reaction time of 40 to 390 minutes. It was found that although LAS was easily oxidized by WAG to compounds that do not act as detergents, unoxidized LAS was more readily biodegradable than that of the treated LAS. Biodegradability of LAS decreased with an increasing degree of oxidation. Patterson et al. (2002) studied the WAG of LAS at 1600 mg/L, at temperatures ranging 180-240 °C and pressures ranging from 3.05 to 6.55 MPa. Identified products included low molecular weight VFAs (volatile fatty acids) such as formic and acetic acid, sulfonated aromatics, and sulfate. Gver a reaction time o f 120 minutes at 1.5 MPa Oj partial pressure, increasing the temperature produced an improvement in LAS removal from 79% to 100% and CGD removal from 23% to 70%. Increasing the pressure was found to have little impact on TGC and CGD removal. In another study, Mantzavinos et al. (2000) studied semi-batch WAG of

20

LAS at temperatures o f 453 and 473 K and total pressures o f 2.8 and 3.3 MPa with a reaction time o f 40-390 minutes. In agreement with the results obtained by Mantzavinos et al. (2001), LAS was readily degraded to smaller molecules that did not behave as surfactants. TOC removal only reached 50% because o f the resistance o f small organic acids to further oxidation.

2.7.2 Sonochem ical D egradation of Surfactants Vinodgopal (2001) studied the ultrasound-induced (363 kHz) degradation o f nonylphenol ethoxylate. Ultrasonic degradation is a result of ultrasound-induced cavitations. Acoustic cavitation involves the formation, growth, and implosion o f very small gas bubbles. The implosion o f the bubbles results in near adiabatic heating o f the gas and vapour inside the bubble. High local temperatures and pressures are referred to as hot spots. These conditions can result to the homolysis o f water molecules to produce H* and 'OH radicals. The attack o f the surfactant molecules by the radicals and thermal decomposition are the main pathways of degradation. The rates o f degradation are dependent on the initial surfactant concentrations. Destaillats et al. (2000) also studied the degradation o f alkylphenol ethoxylates by ultrasound. It was shown that the critical micelle concentration effectively shielded surfactant monomers from H* and 'O H radicals.

2.7.3

Foam Fractionation of Surfactants

Foam fractionation is accomplished by sparging air to produce tiny bubbles that collect surfactant molecules as they rise to the top o f the liquid and produce foam. The thin liquid film between the air bubbles is stabilized by the adsorbed surfactant. The liquid drains form

21

Mis iÉ H ifi iiquîà film due tb gravity (Tharapiwattananon et al., 1996). Foam fi-actionation was used as a method for the treatment of sodium dodecylsuifate contaminated water and provided 90% recovery (Tharapiwattananon et al., 1996). Wungrattanasopon et al. (1996) studied foam fractionation to remove tert-butylphenol by using sodium dodecylsuifate to and confirmed Tharapiwattananon's results of 90% surfactant recovery.

2.7.4

Electrocheraically Generated Coagulant Treatment of Surfactants

Electrochemically generated coagulants are formed by passing an electrical current through an iron or aluminum electrode (anode) that in turn releases Al^^ or Fe^^ as a result o f electron consumption. Hydrogen gas forms at the cathode. Depending on the pH, aluminum oxide or iron oxide floes form and float to the surface carrying the floes and contaminants. Ciorba et al. (2002) studied the removal of nonylphenol ethoxylates with electrochemicallygenerated aluminum and iron coagulants using aluminum and carbon steel electrodes with a current density o f 10 A/m^. It was found that the longer the ethoxylate chain, the more hydrophilic the NPEO, therefore, the less tendency to adsorb the floes leading to lower removal rates. Removal rates of NP4E0 (4 EO groups) were between 40 and 80% and for NP16E0 (16 EO groups) 30 to 50%.

2.7.5

Photofenton Treatment of Surfactants

Photofenton treatment involves the irradiation of a solution containing hydrogen peroxide and ferric ions in order to degrade organic pollutants. The ferric ion acts as a catalyst for the generation of hydroxyl radicals. A simplified photo Fenton reaction is as follows:

22

+7^202 -» F e ^ + 'O H + O H Fe^*+H ^O + h v - ^ Fe^^+'OH + H *

. (1) (2)

Brand et al. (1998) studied the photofenton degradation o f an alkylphenol ethoxylate (trade name Igepal CA 520). A UV source o f 365 nm was used. 60% removal was achieved in six hours. Exposure to sunlight for 24 hours resulted in 90% removal.

2.7.6

Fenton's Treatment of Surfactants

The Fenton reaction is as follows: Fe^* -> Fe^^+'OH + 0H ~ (3)

The radicals that are formed react with organic compounds and ultimately degrade them to carbon dioxide and water. Kitis et al. (1999) studied the enhancement o f biodegradability o f NPEO with Fenton's treatment. 1000 mg/L COD (NPEO) was used with 1000 mg/L hydrogen peroxide with an HzOi/Fe" equal to one. Batch aerobic experiments followed to test the biodegradability of the partially oxidized solution. It was concluded that Fenton's pretreatment reduced biodegradability with low hydrogen peroxide dosages and increased the biodegradability at higher H2 O 2 dosages. Lin et al. (1999) found optimum operating conditions for treating 10 mg/L LAS to be 90 mg/L FeS 0 4 , 60 mg/L hydrogen peroxide with a reaction time o f 50 minutes at pH 3 to achieve greater than 95% removal. A first order kinetic model was fitted to the experimental results. Final treatment with a chemical coagulant was found to be highly beneficial in removing small iron oxide floes formed during the reaction.

23

2.7.7

Ozonation of Surfactants

Narkis et al. (1984) studied the degradation of NPnEOs (n=4-30) in dilute solution. First order reaction rates were observed with respect to NPEO concentration. A linear relationship was observed between first order rate constants and a number of ethoxylate groups. It was concluded that the high O3 concentrations do not enhance mineralization but low concentrations of O3 are sufficient to enhance biodegradability. Beltran et al. (2000) studied the effect of pH and organic loading on the treatment of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDS) by ozonation. It was determined that alkaline conditions were favoured since hydroxyl radicals were preferentially formed and were the main route of degradation. Ozonation was only able to partially remove SDS and COD but was concluded that combined ozonation and biodégradation might enhance removal o f COD.

2.7.8 Treatm ent of Surfactants with TiOz Combined with Ultraviolet Light (UV) In the last 20 years, the potential for usage of photocatalysts for organic pollutant destruction has been realized (Aye, 2002; Cuzolla et ah, 2002; Hidaka et ah, 1988; Hidaka et ah, 1992; Mehrvar, 1998; Nadarajah et ah, 2002; Turchi, 1990; Venkatadri and Peters, 1993). An ideal photocatalyst is chemically and biologically inert, easily recovered, and reusable. Titanium dioxide fits this profile and hence has been tested extensively in the treatment of a wide variety of organic contaminants. Sherrard et ah (1996) studied the treatment of alcohol ethoxylates and nonylphenol ethoxylates in batch reactors. Experimental conditions were as follows: 0.1% w/v TiOz catalyst, 2000 mg/L surfactant and irradiation with a 400W black light lamp. It was found that NPEO more easily degraded than AE. Pelizzetti et ah (1989) studied NPnEO (where

24

n=2, 5 or 12) degradation in a batch reactor with P25 TiOz and a 1500 W UV lamp in an NPnEO solution with a concentration o f 0.1 mM. The degradation was monitored by measuring CO 2 evolution, DOC, and particulate organic carbon. The reaction pathway involved a hydroxyl radical attack on the ethoxylate chain and on the benzene ring. The rate o f reaction was dependent on adsorption o f the surfactant to the titanium dioxide surface. Horikoshi et al. (2002) studied the degradation o f NPEO in a cylindrical reactor where the titanium dioxide was immobilized on a fiberglass cloth. Saien et al. (2003) studied the photocatalytic degradation o f sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDS), a linear alkylbenzene sulfonate with 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. Degradation using Degussa P25 TiOz combined with UV light at 365nm was tested in batch mode. The batch setup included the UV lamp outside o f the reactor placed symmetrically over top o f the 500 mL pyrex reactor. Various optimization parameters were tested including pH, temperature, SDS and TiO: concentration. SDS concentrations tested were in the range o f 4,4-13.8 mg/L and TiO: concentrations from 5-32 mg/L. It was found that the optimum pH was 3, as the temperature increased (up to 45 °C) the rate increased, and the optimum Ti 0 2 concentration was
8

mg/L for a 10.8 mg/L SDS solution. Hidaka et al.

(1992) also studied the photocatalytic degradation of SDS under similar conditions. The concentrations used were 0.1 and 0.01 mM (34.8 and 348 mg/L) and 2.0 g/L Degussa P25 Ti 0 2 . Based on the results obtained from intermediate compounds formed during degradation, mechanisms for SDS degradation were proposed. The first proposed mechanism involved radical attack o f the aromatic ring (Figure 2 .2 ).

27

The second mechanism proposed involves radical a attack on the alkyl chain. Alkyl groups on aromatic rings behave as activating agents by donating electrons to the aromatic ring. Alkyl groups are ortho and para directors. Electrophilic additions to these locations on an aromatic ring promote stabilization o f formed intermediates by inductive and resonance effects. The sulfonate group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and is a meta deactivator. The directing effects of these two substituents oppose each other therefore, in the case of LAS or DBS; the para position to the sulfonate group is the only position open to electrophilic attack (McMurray, 1996). This is in agreement with the mechanism proposed by Hidaka et al. (1992) for SDS. Photocatalytic degradation rates of two compounds, sodium benzene sulfonate (BS) and sodium dodecylsuifate (DS) were compared to the degradation of SDS to determine how the degradation mechanism occurs. Studies o f intermediate compounds led to the conclusion that the aromatic and alkyl group competitively adsorb to the titanium dioxide surface and degrade. The rate influencing steps for degradation of SDS were suggested by Hidaka et al. (1992) to be as follows: (1) Surfactant adsorption on TiO; surface (2) Electron-hole pair formation or radical formation (3) Rate limiting steps included ring opening, peroxide, carboxylic acid, or aldehyde formation. (4) Complete mineralization to H^O and CO2 .

2.7.9 Concluding Remarks Surfactants play a major role in our society. Ultimately, their usage in such large quantities means that their ultimate fate is highly important (Hatfield Venhuis, S. & M.Mehrvar, 2004). It has been demonstrated that greater than 90% of many surfactants are removed in traditional biological wastewater treatment processes. The remainder can remain adsorbed to the biosolids at end up on agricultural land via reuse programs. Many methods of surfactant

28

degradation and removal have been discussed in this review and it has been shown that the treatment o f surfactant containing wastewaters at the source is a viable option.

2.8 Advanced Oxidation Processes Advanced oxidation processes refers to processes that utilize highly reactive oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), Fenton and photo Fenton's reagent (F e^/H 2 O 2 or Fe^^/H2 0 2 /UV), ultraviolet (low range UV or near visible) light, and ultraviolet/Ti0 2 and any combinations o f these processes to degrade organic compounds. Photocatalysis has many potential applications including degradation o f persistent organic pollutants including halogentated organ ics, metal recovery, air purification, disinfection, and sterilization. There are many advantages and disadvantages to photocatalysis. Some advantages include: -effective at ambient temperatures, -complete mineralization for most organic compounds, -pollutant is not transferred to a secondary medium that requires treatment -toxicity is generally reduced, -can enhance biodegradability. Some disadvantages include: -difficulty in recovery o f the photocatalyst in 1 i0 2 slurry reactors, -can be expensive; energy intensive, high chemical cost when combined with H 2 O 2 or another molecular oxidant, -low quantum yield efficiencies, -occasionally can produce a more toxic end product.

-may result in recalcitrant intermediates;

2.8.1 Basic Principles of Advanced Oxidation Processes 2.8.1.1. Photocatalysis Photocatalysis involves the irradiation of a semiconductor metal oxide such as titanium dioxide with ultraviolet light. For a photocatalyst to be useful, several characteristics are desired such as photoactivity, photostability, lifetime, and non-toxic, inexpensive and chemically and biologically inert. Irradiation with ultraviolet light causes different reactions to occur. Semi-conductors are characterized by a filled valence band and an empty conduction band. Semiconductors contain lattice defects that result in electron donating levels (Turchi, 1990).

There are several possible outcomes of electrons. The predominant outcome is recombination of electrons with holes that results in the low photo efficiency of these reactions. On average, 94% of the electrons recombine. Those that do react can be trapped on the surface forming oxygen or hydroxyl radicals. Below are the possible mechanisms of photocatalysis (Turchi, 1990).

Reactive species such as radicals then attack the organic pollutant at areas of high electron density by addition or abstraction of a hydrogen or halogen atom (Mehrvar, 2001). Organic compounds that are easily oxidized include aromatic, multiple bond organics such as alkenes and alkynes, amides, amines, thiols, sulphides etc. Compounds that are

32

difficult to degrade include those without areas o f high electron density such as alkanes and aromatic rings that contain strong electron withdrawing groups. There are several factors that affect the photocatalytic rate o f a reaction including light intensity, metal ions with a band gap similar to titanium dioxide, pH, initial concentration o f the contaminant, and competing ions such as carbonate species (Turchi, 1990).

2.8.1.2 Photolysis w ith Low W avelength UV Light Degradation o f organic compounds by photolysis occurs by direct bond breakage. Irradiation with UV-A light in the range o f 254 nm provides energy higher than that o f most organic covalent bonds. Organic molecules with areas o f high electron density are particularly susceptible to degradation by photolysis.

Once radicals have been formed, the degradation process continues to occur via degradation directly with UV light but also includes enhanced degradation with the radicals produced. The radicals generally react by hydrogen or halogen abstraction.

3.1 Materials The following materials were used in the photolysis and photocatalysis experiments.

3.1.1 Distilled Water Distilled deionized water was used for all experiments.

3.1.2 Linear Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate (LAS) Standard LAS with a concentration o f 1 mg LAS/mL (average carbon chain length, C=12) was used (Ricca Chemical Company, Arlington, TX). LAS used in experiments was donated by the Stepan Company (Northfield, Illinois, USA ) under the trade name Biosoft D 40. Properties o f Biosoft D 40 were provided by the manufacturer and are listed in Table 3.1.

Ralkyl represents a varying alkyl chain length (12-16 carbon atoms). Para to the alkyl chain is a sulfonate group with a sodium atom ionically bonded to one of the sulfonate oxygen atoms.

3.1.3 Detergents Three detergents were selected for comparison of degradation process with LAS. Gain (Proctor & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH, USA), Tide (Proctor & Gamble, Toronto, ON, Canada) and Purex (Dial Corporation, USA) were chosen based on cost. Purex is the least expensive while Tide is the most expensive. Figure 3.2 shows the results of the analysis of the detergents compared to LAS. Soluble COD, pH and LAS were measured. Detergents contain many ingredients, some of which are outlined in Table 3.2.

3.1.4 Titanium Dioxide (TiOi) Two types o f titanium dioxide were used as photocatalysts in this study. Degussa P25 TiO; was donated from the Degussa Corporation (Akron, Ohio, USA) and Hombikat UV 100 TiOi was donated from Sachtleben Chemie GmbH (Duisburg, Germany). The physical properties o f the titanium dioxides are shown in Table 3.2.

3.1.5 Hydrogen Peroxide A 50% w/v solution o f hydrogen peroxide was purchased from Hach Co. (Loveland, OH). This solution has a molarity o f 17.2. The concentration o f hydrogen peroxide was varied to optimize the LAS degradation.

39

3.1.6 UV Lamps For the photocatalytic experiments, a Phillips PLS 9W/10/UVA (Microlites Scientific) 365 nm lamp was used as the light source. For the photolysis experiments, a Phillips PLS TUV/PL-59W with a nominal wavelength of 254 nm was used. To ensure constant light intensity during experiments, the intensity of each lamp used was measured and recorded on a monthly basis. To measure the intensity o f the lamps, a Spectroline® Digital Radiometer (Spectronics Corporation, NY) was utilized. The radiometer is equipped to measure the intensity o f both 365 and 254 nm lamps.

3.1.7 Chloroform Omni-Solv, GC/HPLC grade chloroform, chemical formula CHCI3 (99.98%, CAS #67-66-3), purchased from EM Science, was used to extract LAS from water samples by transferring an ion pair formed by LAS and methylene blue from the aqueous phase to the organic phase.

3.1.8 Methylene Blue Methylene blue, chemical formula CieHjgCINsS H2 O (CAS# 7220-79-3; EM Science), was used to form an ion pair with LAS in aqueous solution. The ion pair when transferred to the organic chloroform phase absorbs strongly at 652nm and provides a convenient method for determination of LAS.

ec 40

3.1.9 Phenolphthalein Indicator For analysis o f LAS, phenolphthalein indicator, 1% alcoholic (CAS# 77-09-8; VW R Canlab, Mississauga, ON) was used. For analysis o f LAS by methylene blue active substances (MBAS) method, it is important for all samples to be acidic (pH=4.3). The indicator provides a simple visual method for adjusting the sample pH.

3.2 Equipment and Methods 3.2.1 Experimental Setup The experimental setup for all experiments is shown in Figure 3.3. For all experiments, one litre o f a 100 mg LAS/L solution was prepared and the required photocatalyst (Degussa P25 or Hombikat UV 100 TiOz) or oxidant (H 2 O2 ) was added to a 1.4 L beaker. The beaker was wrapped with aluminum foil to reflect the light back in to the reaction mixture and to protect eyes and skin, A UV lamp (either 365 for photocatalysis or 254 nm for photolysis) was immersed in the reaction solution. Throughout the reaction, the mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer to minimize mass transfer limitations.. All reactions were carried out at room temperature. The pH and temperature were monitored throughout the experiment.

3.2.2 pH M easurements The pH o f the reaction mixture was monitored using a glass gel filled pH probe (Thermo Orion M odel 9107BN) combined with a Thermo Orion Meter model 230A+. Prior to each reaction, the probe was calibrated using buffers with pHs o f 4, 7, and 10.

3.2.3 Analytical Techniques for LAS Measurements The following section describes the analytical method used for determination o f LAS including chemical preparation and extraction procedures. Analysis o f LAS was carried out using Standard Methods (1992) determination o f anionic surfactants as methylene blue active substances (MBAS). Methylene blue is a cationic dye that forms an ion pair with anionic surfactants in an aqueous phase and can transfer the ion pair to an immiscible organic solvent (chloroform). The blue colour of the ion pair in the chloroform phase is a measure o f the methylene blue active substances present in the water sample. This method involves three successive extractions from an acidic aqueous solution (containing an excess o f methylene blue) into chloroform followed by backwashing and measurement o f the absorbance o f the chloroform using a spectrophotometer at 652 nm. The MBAS method is not selective to LAS, however, when LAS is the only anionic surfactant present, the results are quantitative. For experiments using commercial detergents. Gain, Tide and Purex, the MBAS method is not selective to LAS. For these experiments, MBAS method is used to measure the total concentration of anionic surfactants present as LAS. Particulate in samples can cause an interference by adsorption o f methylene blue, therefore, all samples containing TiOz were centrifuged before analysis using an Adams Physician Compact centrifuge (Clay Adams, Parsippany, NJ).

3.2.3.1 Chemicals for LAS Determination This section describes the chemicals used and how they were prepared for LAS determination.

3.2.3.1.a. Stock LAS Solution The stock LAS solution is used for quality control analysis and standards. The stock solution was purchased from Ricca Chemical Company (Arlington, TX) and has a concentration of 1.00 mg LAS/1 mL solution (CAS# 7664-93-9).

3.2.3.1.b. Standard LAS Standard LAS solutions were prepared using the stock LAS solution to make concentrations ranging from 0 to 150 mg LAS/L. Distilled deionized water was used to prepare all standards.

3.2.3.1.C. 1 N NaOH Solution 1 N NaOH solution using ACS grade NaOH (Caledon Chemicals) 97% (CAS#1310-73-2) was prepared by dissolving 1 mole NaOH in distilled deionized water and diluting to 1 L in a volumetric flask.

N H 2 SO4 Solutions

Solutions o f IN and 6N H2 SO4 were prepared by diluting the required amount of concentrated sulfuric acid (98%w/v) with distilled deionized water in a volumetric flask.

44

3.2.3.1.e. M ethylene Blue Reagent 100 mg methylene blue was dissolved in deionized water and diluted to 100 mL in volumetric flask. 30 mL o f this solution, 41 mL o f 6 N H 2 SO 4 and 50 g o f sodium phosphate, monobasic, monohydrate were diluted to 1 L in a volumetric flask and dissolved.

3.2.3.1.f. W ash Solution In a 1 L volumetric flask, 41 mL o f 6 N H 2 SO 4 was added to approximately 500 mL o f distilled water. 50 g N a 2 H 2 P 0 4 'H 2 0 was added and dissolved by inverting the flask. The flask was filled to the 1 L mark and mixed well.

3.2.3.2. Procedure for LAS Determination This section describes the method followed for analysis o f LAS.

3.2.3.2.a. Calibration Curve Preparation A calibration curve was prepared each time a new batch o f analysis chemicals was made. LAS standard solutions were prepared in the range o f 0 to 150 mg LAS/L. The extraction procedure w as followed (3.2.3.2.b) and the mg LAS/L was plotted against absorption at 652 nm. A typical calibration curve in shown in Appendix A.

3.2.3.2.b. Extraction Procedure
The extraction procedure was modified slightly in order to reduce the required sample size and to use less chloroform since it is toxic and a suspected carcinogen. The detection limit with the modified method was experimentally found to be 2.0 mg LAS/L or 20 [ig LAS. The detection limit reported by Standard Methods is 10 pg LAS. 1. A 10 mL sample is required for each extraction and was added to a clean 14 mL centrifuge tube. If required, the sample was pre-centrifuged or filtered to remove particulate. 2. One drop of phenolphthalein indicator was added to the sample and mixed. 3. 1 N NaOH was added drop-wise to make the solution basic (solution will turn pink). 4. I N H2SO4 was then added drop-wise until the pink colour just disappeared (solution was slightly acidic). 5. 1 mL CHCI3 and 2.5 mL of methylene blue reagent was added to the tube. The tube was shaken vigorously for 30 seconds and then allowed time to separate. 6. The aqueous layer was withdrawn from the tube with a clean pipet and transferred to another clean tube. The tube with the chloroform fraction was capped to prevent losses. Extraction with 1 mL chloroform was repeated two more times. 7. 5 mL of wash solution was added to the chloroform extracts, shaken vigorously for 30 seconds and then allowed to separate. 8. The wash solution was extracted two times with 1 mL chloroform. 9. The chloroform extracts were diluted to 10 mL and the absorbance was measured at 652 nm against chloroform blank.

46

3.2.3.2.C. UV Spectrophotometry For all LAS determinations, a Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT, USA) Lambda 20 UV/VIS Spectrometer was used. Quartz Hellma cells were used. These cells had a 10 mm path length and were optically matched.

3.2.4 C hem ical Oxygen D em and COD o f samples was measured using prepared vials (Bioscience Inc Analytical, Bethlehem, PA, USA). Standard range vials were used for all tests (20-900 mg /L). 2 mL o f filtered or centrifuged sample was added to the digestion vial and digested at 150 °C for two hours. The samples were measured using the same spectrophotometer and quartz cell as in Section 3.2.3.2.C. The absorbance was measured after the samples had cooled to room temperature at 600 nm. The results were compared to a standard curve prepared by using potassium hydrogen phtalate (KHP) standard solutions.

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this chapter, the results from various photocatalytic and photolysis treatments are explained and discussed. Two TiO] photocatalysts were tested (Degussa P25 and Hombikat UV 100) to determine the effectiveness of each in destruction of the LAS compound. Batch experiments include treatment of 100 mg LAS/L with UV light with wavelengths of 365 and 254 nm, H2 O2 combined with UV254 nm, titanium dioxide combined with H 2 O 2 using either UV254 nmor UVsesnm and combined Ti0 2 with UVaesnm.

PHOTOCATALYTIC TREATMENT OF LAS 4.1 Control Experiments Dark experiments were carried out to ensure that reactions were primarily due to irradiation with UV light and titanium dioxide. The first set of dark adsorption experiments were conducted using the same experimental setup but without the UV lamp turned on. Figure 4.1 shows that there was no significant adsorption of LAS on the experimental setup. The initial concentration of LAS was varied from 100 to 840 mg LAS/L. As demonstrated in Figure 4.1, the LAS concentration did not have any impact on adsorption characteristics. For all experiments without titanium dioxide, adsorption of LAS was of no consequence. In the next set o f experiments, adsorption o f LAS on Degussa P25 titanium dioxide was completed.

All masses of titanium dioxide that were used for degradation were tested for adsorption. The Ti02 slurry was mixed during this test. Figure 4.2 shows that there was limited adsorption on P25 TiOz over a four-hour period. The next set of dark reactions involved testing of LAS adsorption on Hombikat UV 100 titanium dioxide. Figure 4.3 shows the results for 2.0g of titanium dioxide. Adsorption of LAS increased as concentration of titanium dioxide in suspension increased. This was a result of increased surface area, therefore, there were more sites for LAS to become adsorbed. Figure 4.4 shows the relationship between the concentration o f LAS adsorbed and the mass o f titanium dioxide used.

It was observed that the increasing adsorption with increasing TiOz followed a logarithmic relationship. An adsorption factor was determined by using the logarithmic relationship in Figure 4.4. fraction o f LAS adsorbed = Q.\Q'i*\n{gTi02) + ^ A l \ (19)

For each experiment, the concentration of LAS adsorbed on the surface of the titanium dioxide was calculated and used to correct the measured concentration. For reactions where both Degussa P25 and Hombikat UV 100 TiOz were used, the dark reactions were completed to confirm that the adsorption equation held true. Figure 4.5 shows exampled of adsorption for combined experiments. The adsorption of LAS on the titanium dioxide occurs within the first thirty minutes of the dark experiment.

4.2 Photolysis In this section, results from photolysis experiments are presented and discussed.

4.2.1 Photolysis with UV 365 nm Light Various concentrations of LAS were tested for degradation with UV light at 365 nm. Although theoretically UV light with this energy is not capable of direct bond breakage resulting in degradation, it was important to confirm that degradation of LAS in photocatalysis experiments was a result of titanium dioxide and not photolysis. As seen in the Figure 4.6, no degradation occurs when LAS was irradiated with UV 365nm and this process was not concentration dependent.

4.2.2 Photolysis with UV 254 nm Light This section summarizes the photolytic experiments that were completed. These experiments were used to compare effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide degradation of LAS with combined processes at low wavelength UV light. Figure 4.7 shows the results of LAS degradation using low wavelength UV light at 254 nm. Figure 4.8 shows the results of LAS degradation using low wavelength UV light as compared to the three model detergents. The first order rate constant for LAS is significantly greater

54

than that o f any detergent tested. Purex had the highest k followed by Gain and Tide respectively. Table 4.1 shows the numerical results o f these experiments.

Table 4.1; 1" order rate comparison of LAS with detergents.

D etergent LAS (Biosoft D40) Gain Tide Purex

k (min'*) 0.0041 0.0014 0.0012 0.0019

Table 4.1 shows that the best results for the degradation o f a detergent is Purex. The variation in rates as compared to LAS from Biosoft D40 suggests that other compounds in the detergent composition exert a significant oxidant demand. It is worth noting that an increase in detergent cost is proportional to LAS concentration, soluble COD, and oxidant demand. Degradation o f LAS with UV light does not significantly change the soluble COD over a five-hour period. This shows a lack o f mineralization of the compounds in the detergent formulation (Figure 4.9). Figure 4.10 shows the change in pH associated with the degradation using low wavelength UV light. In all cases, the pH decreased throughout the experiment but was more pronounced with the Biosoft D40 (LAS). Biosoft D40 does not have any added buffers as do the detergents. N o temperature control was employed during the experiments. Figure 4.11 shows how the temperature increased as a result o f UV irradiation and mixing. In all experiments, the temperature increased from around 22 °C to 33-37 °C as result o f mixing and UV lamp intensity. There was no attempt made in these experiments to control the temperature.

4.2.3 Photolysis w ith H 2 O 2 combined w ith UV 254 nm This section outlines the optimization o f UV combined with H 2 O 2 as well as a rate comparison o f LAS with the selected detergents. Figure 4.12 shows the optimization o f hydrogen peroxide for LAS BiosoA D40. The optimum rate for degradation o f LAS with combined hydrogen peroxide and UV light at 254 nm was at 5,000 mg/L for a lOOmg/L solution o f LAS. This amount o f hydrogen peroxide would not be realistic in a scaled-up situation, therefore, the degradation o f detergents was carried out at a lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide (1,560 mg/L). At this concentration, the first order rate was close to 10 times that for the optimum concentration o f Degussa P25 TiO;. Figure 4.13 depicts a comparison o f the first order rates for the three detergents compared with LAS. As it is shown in Figure 4.14, LAS had the highest rate constant while Gain and Purex rate constants were almost the same at 0.043 and 0.042 m in '\ respectively. Figure 4.14 is an example o f how the pH changes during the reaction for pure LAS as compared to the detergents. The pH drop is a result o f the formation o f organic acids such as different types o f carboxylic acids or alcohols, which are commonly found as degradation products for these types o f degradation mechanisms (Hatfield Venhuis, S. and M.Mehrvar, 2002). Although it was not confirmed in these experiments, it was accepted that organic acids were a product o f organics degradation when using photo lytic and photocatalytic treatment.

4.2.4 UV 254 nm degradation o f LAS w ith H 2 O 2 added at different tim e intervals Hydrogen peroxide was added at different time intervals to solutions o f 100 mg/L LAS under constant irradiation o f UV light at 254 nm. 600 mg/L H 2 O2 was used in each experiment. Figure 4.15 depicts the results o f LAS degradation. It was concluded that there is no improvement in LAS degradation rate when hydrogen peroxide is added at any time after illumination has started. For degradation o f LAS, it is most advantageous to add the hydrogen peroxide at the start o f irradiation.

4.3 Photocatalytic Treatm ent This section outlines the optimization experiments as well as degradation of detergents at the optimum titanium dioxide concentration.

4.3.1 Optimization of Degussa P25 TiOz Optimization experiments were completed by varying the titanium dioxide concentration by comparing the first order rate constants. Figure 4.16 depicts the results of LAS degradation with different TiO^ concentrations. At 4.0 g/L TiOz, the optimum degradation rate occurred for LAS. Above 4.0 g/L, TiOz. the rate decreased sharply. This was a result of the light blocking effect of the titanium dioxide. Since the LTV light was unable to penetrate deep into the solution, the TiOz surface area was not effectively used for oxidant production. Figure 4.17 depicts the results of the first order rate constant comparison of LAS with different detergents. For Degussa P25 TiOz, the best degradation rate occurred with the pure LAS at 0.035 min ' while for the three detergents, the rate varied between 0.01 -0.014 min''. The first order rate constant experimentally determined for 100 mg/L LAS and 2.0 g/L Degussa P25 TiOz, 0.012 min'', was similar to 0.018 min ' found by Hidaka et al. (1992) for 34.8 mg/L sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDS) and 2.0 g/L TiOz. The similarity in rate constants was expected since the difference in compounds was limited only to the alkyl chain length. The observed difference may be a result of the difference in LAS or SDS initial concentration. It is important to note the SDS degradation was monitored by the disappearance of the aromatic ring (Hidaka et. al, 1992). The results from this study cannot be directly related to the study by Saien et al. (2003) since the concentrations o f both the initial SDS and TiOz were much lower. Due to the similarities between SDS and the LAS used in this study (SDS has an alkyl chain with 12 carbon atoms while LAS is a mixture of compounds with 10-14 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain), it is expected that BiosoA D40 will follow a similar degradation path to that proposed by Hidaka et al. (1992).

The soluble COD varied significantly between the BiosoA D40 and the detergents tested (Figure 3.1). For Tide and Purex, the soluble COD decreased sharply over the first three hours of the experiment. LAS and Gain showed sharp decreases in soluble COD (Figure 4.18) during the first 20 minutes of the experiment. The difference can be attributed to the differences in detergent ingredients. The pH decreased throughout the degradation experiment as a result of organic acid formation. The pH of Purex decreased from 10 to 7.1, while for Tide, Gain and LAS the pH started at around 8.5 and decreased to just above 7.0. The ultimate pH is dependent upon the initial pH (Figure 4.19).

4.3.2 Optimization of Hombikat UV 100 /UV 365nm This set o f experiments was designed to optimize the Hombikat UV 100 titanium dioxide concentration. The concentration of Hombikat UV 100 TiOa was varied and the first order rate constants were compared. Figure 4.20 illustrates the experimental results for the first order rate constants in LAS degradation using Hombikat UV 100 TiO: photocatalytic processes. The optimum concentration of Hombikat UV 100 was found to be 2.0 g/L.

4.3.3 Comparison of Degussa P25 and Hombikat UV 100 TiOz for the degradation of LAS Degussa P25 TiOz had a maximum first order rate constant of 0.035 min ' at 4.0 g/L while Hombikat UV 100 TiOz had a maximum first order rate constant of 0.0098 min ' at 2.0 g/L. Figure 4.21 shows the first order rate constants for both types of TiOz. Since the Hombikat UV 100 titanium dioxide has a higher surface area, therefore, more active sites, the maximum first order rate constant by Hombikat UV 100 TiOz should be higher than that for Degussa P25 TiOz. Based on surface area, UV 100 TiOz should have 7 times the photoactivity of Degussa P25. It has been observed that for treatment of some organic compounds, the photoactivity of Hombikat UV 100 TiOz is only 2 times that of Degussa P25 TiOz (Aye et al., 2003). It has been reported that Hombikat UV 100 TiOz exhibits a higher photoactivity than that of Degussa P25 TiOz at high loadings (Mehrvar et al., 2002). The reverse was observed in this study. For degradation of LAS, Hombikat UV 100 was found to have a lower photoactivity than Degussa P25 TiOz. LAS adsorption on the surface of the Hombikat UV 100 TiOz (>25% adsorbed) reduces the sites available for oxidant production. Since LAS was not degraded by UV 365 nm alone (Figure 4.5), this severely limits the rate at which the LAS can degrade under these conditions. In studies where Hombikat UV 100 TiOz is reported to have a higher photoactivity, the adsorption of the model compounds tested was less than 10% and therefore, could be neglected. Another important observation was that first order rate constants were used in this study to compare photoactivity whereas the method of initial rates was used in other studies in which UV 100 had higher photoactivity. It has been shown that the method of initial rates has sensitivity issues (Mehrvar, 2000).

4.3.4 Combined Degussa P25 and Hombikat UV 100 TiOz at UV 365 nm The objective o f these experiments was to determine if by combining the two types o f titanium dioxide the degradation rate could be improved upon. It was thought that by combining the two types o f TiOz, the agglomeration effect discussed in section 4.5 could be effectively reduced, therefore, increasing the number of active sites available for oxidant production on the UV 100 titanium dioxide (Hatfield Venhuis, S. and M. Mehrvar, 2003). Figure 4.22 shows the results of the combined TiOz experiments. Based on the above results, there w as no added advantage in combining the two types o f titanium dioxide. The optimum rate occurs w ith Degussa P25 TiOz. Since there was no observed improvement in rates, as a result, the detergents were not tested.

4.3.5 Combined Degussa P25 and HzOz The following set o f experiments was completed to test for improved degradation o f LAS by combining titanium dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. Since the optimum wavelength for oxidant production on the surface o f titanium dioxide was at 365 nm and for photolysis o f the oxygen-oxygen bond in hydrogen peroxide for formation o f hydroxyl radicals was 254 nm, both wavelengths o f light were tested for the combined experiments. The results were compared with HzOz - UV 254 nm and Degussa P25 TiOz - UV 365 nm alone. Figure 4.23 shows the results for the photocatalytic and photolytic degradation o f LAS. The optimum concentrations for the individual processes were not used because in a real life situation, the cost o f 5,000 mg/L HzOz and 4.0 g/L TiOz would be inhibitory to any viable treatment process. Degussa P25 TiOz was used since it produced the best rate results even though more on a mass basis was required. The hydrogen peroxide concentration used was 600 mg/L. The first experiment was 3.0 g/L TiOz and 600 mg/L with HzOz in the presence o f light at 365 nm. The first order rate constant was lower than that of the TiOz/UV 365 nm alone. This was a result o f adsorbed hydrogen peroxide using available sites on the surface o f the titanium dioxide, therefore, lowering the production o f active species. Similar results were seen when TiOz w as combined with 600 mg/L HzOz and irradiated with UV 254 nm. The adsorbed hydrogen peroxide was not available for reaction with the UV light to produce hydroxyl radicals for reaction with LAS. The best rate was achieved with Degussa P25 TiOz combined with UV light 365 nm. Due to the poor results, Gain, Tide, and Purex were not tested.

CHAPTER 5

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1 Conclusions The conclusions listed below can be drawn from this study. (1) Irradiation of a 100 mg/L LAS with UV 365 nm was not successful. This wavelength of UV light did not have the required energy for direct bond breakage. (2) Photolysis with UV 254 nm successfully degraded LAS, however, the long reaction time (5 hours to achieve 80% degradation) was not energetically favourable. The first order rate constant for LAS was highest for BioSoft D40 (LAS) at 0.0041 min'' followed by Purex (0.0019 min''). Gain (0.0014 min ') and Tide (0.0012 min '). The soluble COD did not decrease over a five-hour period. (3) Optimum photolysis conditions for degradation of LAS were found with 5,000 mg/L H 2 O2 combined with UV light at 254 nm. The first order rate constant for degradation o f LAS under these conditions was 0.25 min''. For comparison o f LAS and detergent degradation, 1,560 mg/L H2 O2 was used. LAS had the highest first order rate constant (0.077 min ') followed by Gain (0.043 min''), Purex (0042 min ') and Tide (0.016 m in'). (4) Photolysis of LAS with UV light at 254 nm and 600 mg/L H 2 O2 added at different time intervals was not successful. No improvement in reaction rate was observed. For optimum results, the hydrogen peroxide is added at the beginning of irradiation. (5) The optimum concentration of Degussa P25 Ti02 was found to be 4.0 g/L for degradation of LAS. At this titanium dioxide loading, the first order rate constant was 0.035 min ' for LAS while for the detergents, the rates ranged from 0.01 to 0.014 min'. (6) The optimum concentration of Hombikat UV 100 Ti02 was 2.0 g/L. The first order rate constant for LAS degradation was 0.0098 min"'.

80

(7) For degradation o f LAS, Hombikat UV 100 TiOj had a lower photoactivity than that o f Degussa P25 TiO;. LAS adsorption on the surface o f the UV 100 TiOz (>25% adsorbed) reduced the number o f sites available for oxidant production. ( 8 ) Combination o f Degussa P25 and Hombikat UV 100 TiOz in different proportions did not provide a superior rate o f reaction. (9) Combination o f hydrogen peroxide with Degussa P25 titanium dioxide did not provide a superior rate of reaction.

5.2 R ecom m endations All photolysis and photocatalysis experiments gave satisfactory results for the removal o f LAS with the exception o f irradiation with UV 365nm. Complete mineralization was not achieved w ith the methods tested. Based on these experiments performed in this study, the following recommendations are proposed for future research on the removal o f LAS from water; (1) Investigation o f TOC/COD/BOD 5 relationships for various photolytic and photocatalytic LAS degradation processes. (2) Scaling-up o f photocatalytic or photolytic LAS treatment using a pilot scale reactor. (3) Optimization o f photolytic o f photocatalytic treatment combined with biological treatm ent for improved process cost and energy efficiency.

COD of samples was measured using pre prepared vials purchased from Bioscience Inc Analytical (Bethlehem, PA, USA). Standard range vials were used for all tests (20-900 mg /L). 2 mL of filtered or centrifuged sample was added to the digestion vial and digested at 150 °C for two hours. The samples were measured using the same spectrophotometer and quartz cell as described in Section 3.2.3.2.C. The absorbance was measured after the samples had cooled to room temperature at 600 nm. The results were compared to a standard curve prepared by using potassium hydrogen phtalate (KHP) standard solutions.
