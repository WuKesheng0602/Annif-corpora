FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF CORROSION AND BOND-SLIP
Mast o f Engineering, 2003, Yan Lan Department o f C ivil Engineering Ryerson University

ABSTRACT

Although reinforced concrete (RC) has an important advantage that it has virtue durability against an environmental attack, especially the resistance o f corrosion o f embedded reinforcements, due to the high alkalinity nature o f concrete property, unfortunately, the problems o f reinforcement corrosion still exist in many reinforced concrete structures. It has brought out many questions on the safety and serviceability o f these corroded RC structures. Thus, it needs more effective approach for structural performance evaluation o f the corroded structures. The residual capacity o f the corroded reinforcement was determined through the evaluation o f the volum e increase o f reinforcing steel and concrete crack propagation. The final determination o f the service life o f concrete structures was made based on the above evaluation results. Also, the effects o f reinforcement corrosion on structural behaviors o f RC members are

investigated so that the reliable evaluation o f structural performances o f corroded RC members can be achieved by finite elem ent method (FEM). The corrosion attack penetration has been given as a function o f the time as input in the analyses. The load o f corrosion applied inside the structural members can be m odeled by the displacement around the circumferential surface between the reinforcing bars and concrete. The reduction o f capability o f the structures is determined from the corrosion level in the service years.

Another com plex phenomenon that governs concrete behavior is the transfer o f shear force across the interface by bond mechanism between concrete and steel reinforcement. It is a fundamental to most aspects o f concrete behavior. The bond mechanism is influenced by multiple parameters, such as the strength o f the surrounding structures, the occurrence o f splitting cracks in the concrete and the yielding o f the reinforcement. However, when RC structures are analyzed using the FEM, it is quite com m on to assume that the bond stress depends solely on the slip between the bars and concrete. In this research the relationship o f bond slip is also studied using FEM.

An analytical study based on fracture m echanics was earned out to investigate the behavior o f three different types o f specim ens. In recent RC research, finite elem ent m odeling techniques have been developed to quickly evaluate the physical phenomena associated with cracking and bond. The nonlinear finite elem ent program ATENA with the nonlinear material m odels for concrete, reinforcement bar and bond-slip is used to analyze cracking propagation and bond failure process. The influence between corrosion

and bond slip in RC structure is also studied. Therefore, the understanding o f serviceability o f RC structure is improved.

It was concluded that with the increase o f load and the propagation o f the crack, stress redistributed in the steel- continues until the specim en is damaged. The nonlinear finite elem ent fracture analysis show s that nonlinear fracture m echanics can be effectively applied to investigate concrete fracture. A lso, comparisons between the analyses o f crack propagation and stress redistribution obtained using the finite elem ent analysis was in good agreement with tests fdbd in the literature.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Background
The deterioration o f concrete structures due to chloride-induced reinforcement corrosion is recognized as one of the major challenges facing the owners of facilities and infrastructure systems made up o f concrete structures. Chloride-induced corrosion of reinforcing steel in
-

concrete bridge decks, parking garage slabs and marine structures has been identified as the primary cause o f concrete deterioration. Structures exposed to marine environments or deicing salts are particularly at risk. Despite o f the durability o f reinforced concrete structures when compared to steel and timber structures, reinforced and prestressed concrete structures are vulnerable to the damaging effects of corrosion induced primarily by chlorides (from deicing slats and seawater) and to a lesser extent to carbonation-induced corrosion. It is estimated that one-third to one-half of the projected bridge rehabilitation costs in North America are related to bridge deck deterioration [Cady and Weyers, 1983; Lounis and Mirza, 2001]. The corrosion of the reinforcement leads to concrete fracture through cracking, delamination and spalling of the concrete cover, reduction of concrete and reinforcement cross sections, loss of bond between the reinforcement and concrete, reduction in strength (flexural, shear, etc.), and ductility. As a result, the safety and serviceability o f concrete structures are reduced, and their useful service lives shortened.

Reinforcement corrosion is the main cause o f damage and early failure o f reinforced concrete structures worldwide with subsequent enormous costs for maintenance, restoration and : f replacement. According to a 1997 report by Corrosion Doctors Organization, about 101,518 bridges were rated as structurally deficient as a result of corrosion of the 581,862 bridges in and off the U.S.A. federal-aid system. Most of these bridges were not in danger of collapse,

but they were likely to be load posted so that overweight trucks will be required to take a longer alternative route. The estimated cost to eliminate all backlog bridge deficiencies (including structurally and functionally) was approximately $78 billion, and it could increase to as much as $112 billion. The average annual cost, through year 2011, for just maintaining the overall bridge conditions, for example, the total number and the distribution of structurally and functionally deficient bridges in the US alone, was estimated to be $5.2 billions [http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Bridges/Introduction.htm].

Canada also faces huge infrastructures deterioration because o f lack o f funding and related political decisions leading to deferred maintenance. The cost of Canada's infi-astructure is estimated between three and five trillion dollars and approximately 10% of GDP annually is directed towards civil engineering construction. Furthermore, more than 80% of this investment is used in repair, rehabilitation, and renewal.

Usually concrete provides an ideal protective environment for the reinforcing steel. However, when some harmful salts such as chlorides or sulphates penetrate the concrete and reach the steel bars, corrosion commences. Chloride-induce corrosion o f reinforcing steel is a very common phenomenon in concrete bridge decks, parking garage slabs and marine structures as a result o f the use of deicing agents in the winter seasons in North America. Corrosion of RC has been identified as the primary cause of deterioration in the infrastructure system.

Two consequences of corrosion can manifest the damage and reduction o f the serviceability of reinforced concrete structures. First, corrosion produces expansive products that generate tensile stresses in the concrete surrounding the reinforcing steel, which may cause concrete cracking. Cracks can reduce the overall strength and stiffiiess o f the concrete structure and accelerate the ingress o f aggressive ions, leading to other type of concrete deterioration and resulting in further cracking [Metha and Gerwick, 1982]. Second, corrosion products are

highly porous, weak, and often form around reinforcing steel, thus decreasing the bond strength between the reinforcement and concrete [Wang and Monteiro, 1996].

To study these phenomena, some experimental studies have been carried out in the past research. Although it has shown some interesting features from the test results, the limitations still exist, such as difficulties of isolating factors affecting corrosion o f the reinforcing steel and the cost and duration of the tests.

In order to overcome these drawbacks, great efforts have been made by using numerical methods to study some these problems. One of the difficulties in such efforts is modeling of cracking which is very specific to reinforced concrete structures. Cracking has a significant influence in the service life of a reinforced concrete structure, hence, the development and propagation o f crack must be carefully modeled by the finite element method in the analysis. Some nonlinear analysis models of reinforced concrete structure in the cracking situation have been developed.

Another difficulty in the finite element analysis of reinforced concrete structures is to model bond slip which is the relative displacement between the bar and the concrete. Reinforced. concrete depends on the combined action of the concrete and its embedded reinforcement for satisfactory operation as a construction material. This action is produced by the interaction between both o f its components, plain concrete and reinforcing bars. The transfer of forces across the interface between these two materials is completed by the bond, so bond plays a very important role in most aspects o f reinforced concrete behavior. It is dependent on cohesion and adhesion at the steel concrete interface and the mechanical interlocking between the lugs or deformations of the reinforcing bar and the surrounding concrete.

Considerable research has been directed toward the study of bond-slip between the steel reinforcing bar and the surrounding concrete, and many attempts have been made to model bond-slip behavior using finite element analysis. Several laws to describe the behavior have been developed on experimental ground, and constitutive laws between the bond-slip on the interface have been formulated for theoretical analysis purposes. The fracture mechanics theory is applied to investigate the bond-slip problem in the present finite element analysis. In this research the software ATENA was carried out to achieve this objective.

The corrosion of reinforcement affects bond stress significantly in the reinforced concrete structures. In the past research it was mostly studied on the basis of experiment work, and some empirical formulas have been formulated such as those in the CEB-FIP, 2000. Basically, there are two effects between the corrosion of the reinforcement and the bond mechanism. 1) One is the increase volume of the steel reinforcing bar due to the corrosion of reinforcement, which leads to splitting stresses in the concrete; 2) Also corrosion is known to influence friction between the reinforcement and the concrete. Although many, models are set up to analyze the bond stress problem, however, no general analytical model with respect to the corrosion o f bars affecting bond mechanism is available, which has aroused many researchers' interest and great efforts have been made on it.

1.2 Scope and Objectives
The purpose of this project is to study the effect of corrosion and bond slip in the reinforced concrete structures. The analysis is based on the fracture mechanics and carried out by the finite element method. There are two major concerns in this research. They are: (1) Cause and propagation o f cracks due to the corrosion of reinforcing bar in the reinforced concrete structures. (2) Mechanisms o f cracking and bond stress-slip behavior in the reinforced concrete structures.

The first problem is studied by the stress analysis of concrete specimen in which the volume has increased around the reinforcing bar caused by the corrosion. Also, the propagation o f cracks in the concrete specimen during its service life is studied. The second problem is studied using finite element analysis of a tension specimen and a simply supported beam. In summary, it presents some new developments in the corrosion and bond slip problems. It is anticipated that the findings of this research program and its application will result in a better understanding o f the behavior of reinforced concrete structures in the complex conditions such as corrosion and cracking, and its influence on the bond between the steel and concrete.

1.3 Report Layout

Chapter 3 describes the background to the bond between the concrete and reinforcing bars. The chapter includes the factors affecting bond behavior and bond failure. Some analysis models and calculation methods are also studied. ITie relationship between bond and corrosion in the reinforced concrete members are presented. Chapter 4 discusses the finite element analysis used in this research, which is based on the fi-acture mechanics. Two basic models and analysis procedures are described. The material model used in software ATNEA is introduced. Chapter 5 reports and discusses the results obtained the calculation o f corrosion and bond-slip problems. Finally the conclusions are presented in Chapter 6, and recommendations for further research and development o f the influence of corrosion on bond behaviour at the steel-concrete interface are included.

Chapter 2 Corrosion of Steel in Concrete
This chapter presents some o f the latest literature review of the mechanisms of reinforcement corrosion, which have been the subject of intensive research over the past few decades. It discusses how the concrete environment protects the embedded steel. Also, it discusses the characteristics of the concrete of relevance to the corrosion of the reinforcing steel and presents the basic principles of corrosion. The emphasis is placed on the electrochemical process which is fundamental in the corrosion process, and two major factors affecting the corrosion are also discussed.

2.1 Introduction
Corrosion o f steel in concrete has received increasing attention in recent years. The corrosion o f steel reinforcement was first observed in marine structures and chemical manufacturing plants. More recently, numerous reports of its occurrence in bridge decks, parking structures, and other structures exposed to chlorides has made the problem particularly prominent.

The corrosion o f reinforcement in concrete structures is a very serious problem in North America. It may occur in all types of infrastructure such as parking garages, industrial

facilities, bridges and any other auxiliaries. Corrosion of steel reinforcement may lead to a catastrophic failure, such as Berlin Congress Hall (Figure. 2.1) [Isecke, 1982] and the parking garage in Minnesota (Figure 2.2) [Heidersbach, 1986]. In Canada this damage is also very heavy as a result o f using deicing agents during winter seasons. One of the frequent corrosion phenomena in Canada is the corrosion of reinforcing steel in bridges. Figure 2.3 shows the corroded reinforcing steel in one bridge abutment.

The consequence of corrosion may not be limited to engineering failure, but it can also deteriorate our economy. The corrosion damage is costing us billions of dollars annually on repair, rehabilitation, and maintenance of reinforced concrete structures. For example, in 1986 the Ontario Ministry of Housing estimated the cost for repair in the approximately 3000 existing parking structures was a $1 billion plus [Ministry of Housing, 1986], where most of the damage was due to reinforcement corrosion. This was only one province and refers to one type o f structure only. In United States, the annual direct cost o f corrosion for highway bridges is estimated to be $6.43 to $10.15 billion. In Europe these costs are also very significant, for example, in the U.K. the Depaitment of Transportation estimated a total

repair cost o f 1 billion EURO due to corrosion damage on motorway bridges. These bridges only represent about 10% o f the total inventory in the U.K. In addition, from life-cycle analysis it was estimated that the indirect costs due to traffic delays and lost productivity to the user may be more than 10 times the direct cost of corrosion damage

[www.corrosioncost.com]. Therefore, the total costs due to corrosion damage may be far beyond the current estimation.

2.2 Mechanisms of Corrosion of Steel in Concrete
2.2.1 Destroy of Passive Film It is well known that pure metals, such as iron and aluminum, exist in nature in the oxide forms. Iron is produced from iron ore through a process of iron oxide reduction. A lot of energy is involved in this process, and as a result the iron has higher energy level than the iron oxide. Since the most stable form of the material is always associated with the lowest energy level, the energy acquires by iron during its production is ready to be released and provides the driving force for corroding iron into an iron oxide form.

Steel reinforced concrete structures are a combination of materials that includes concrete and reinforcing steel, the corrosion o f steel in concrete is different with the corrosion of steel in

atmosphere. The concrete cover surrounding the steel forms a physical barrier that protects the steel bars from the corrosive environments. The concrete pore solution has a high pH value (usually 12.5-13.5), this alkaline condition can chemically interact with the surface of reinforcing steel leading to a passive layer forming on the steel surface. It is a dense, impenetrable film which, if fully established and maintained, prevents further corrosion of the steel. The layer formed on steel in concrete is probably part metal oxide/hydroxide and part mineral from the cement. A true passive layer is a very dense, thin layer o f oxide that leads to a very slow rate of oxidation (corrosion). Unfortunately, the physical barrier o f the cover concrete is not perfect, because the porous stmcture of concrete and existing microcracks allow the ingress o f aggressive species which cause the breakdown of the passive film. The most commonly encountered cause for reinforcing corrosion is associated with neutralization of the pore solution by atmospheric carbonation (CO 2) and chloride ions that penetrate into concrete.

Carbonation Carbon dioxide (CO 2), which is present in the air in proportions of around 0.3 percent by volume, dissolves in water to form a mildly acidic solution. Unlike other acids that may chemically attack and etch the surface of the concrete, this acid forms within the pores of the concrete itself where the carbon dioxide dissolves in any moisture present. Here it reacts with the alkaline calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H).

The carbonation process reduces pH value and destroys the passive film around the steel, but it seems to density the concrete surface and reduce the chloride ion penetration, by reducing the surface porosity and hence sorptivity in the concrete [Verbeck, 1958; Leber and Blakey, 1956; Dias, 2000]. Carbonation could have both positive and negative effects on concrete durability. Glass et al. (1991) pointed out that the presence of even a small amount of chloride in carbonated concrete enhances the corrosion rate resulted from carbonation of the concrete.

The basic factor influencing carbonation is the diffusivity of the hardened cement paste. Carbonation rate is controlled by the ingress of CO2 into concrete pore system by diffusion with a concentration gradient of CO2 acting as the driving force. Factors affecting diffusion rate include the type and amount of cement, porosity of the material, time o f curing, type and quantity o f pozzolanic additions [Roper and Baweja, 1991; V'eleva, 1998]. Moreover, several mechanical properties of concrete such as compressive strength, surface hardness and resistance to aggressive agents may change due to carbonation [Verbeck, 1958].

Chloride Attack The chloride-induced corrosion is the most prevalent and damaging cause of corrosion of steel in concrete. The role of the chloride ion in inducing reinforcement corrosion is well documented among them [Page and Treadaway, 1982; Mehta, 1993; Tuutti, 1982; Bazant, 1979].

Chlorides can be introduced when seawater or water with a high chloride concentration is used as mixing water, when chloride contaminated coarse or fine aggregates are used, or when chloride containing admixtures such as calcium chloride are used. In addition, chloride ions can enter into the concrete from deicing salts that are applied to the concrete surface, or from seawater in marine environment and chloride-contaminated soils.

While it has been determined that chloride ions act as catalysts for the loss of the protection offered by the passive film, the exact mechanisms of this process are not well understood. However, attack on the passive film by chloride ions is generally accepted to be a localized phenomenon. This form of attack causes microgalvanic cells to form on the reinforcing steel. In regions where the depassivation has occurred become anodic sites and iron will be lost by oxidation, and the areas that remain protected by the passive film will become cathodic and, thus, sites o f oxygen reduction.

To initiate corrosion, a chloride threshold (the amount of chloride required to initiate steel corrosion in reinforced concrete under a given set of exposure condition; commonly expressed in percent o f chloride ion by mass of cement) is required. Chloride ions exist in

concrete in two forms, which are bound and free. It is generally believed that only the free chloride ions-those dissolved in the pore solution-participate in the corrosion process. This threshold concentration o f chloride ions is dependent on so many factors including quality of concrete (water/cement ratio, mixture proportions, type of cement), relative humidity and temperature o f the concrete, the pH of the pore solution and sulfate content [Schiessl and Raupach, 1990; Berman, 1975]. Figure 2.4 illustrates the relation between some factors and the threshold o f chloride concentration given by CEE [CEE, 1985].

2.2.2.1 Electrochemical Processing The electrochemical process requires a flow of electric current and several chemical reactions in the corrosion of steel reinforcing bars. In order to achieve this process, four essential components of a galvanic corrosion cell are needed. They are: 1-Anode; 2-Cathode; 3-Electrolyte. 4- Electrical conductor The general relationship between the components of a corrosion cell is illustrated in Figure 2.5 [Hime, 1987].

The cathode reaction must consume the electrons produced by the anode process. There are two basic reactions which occur at the cathode depending on the pH o f the solution:

c. An electrolyte. This is the name given to the solution, which must, of necessity, conduct electricity. In the solution, the reactions can move from anodic to cathodic regions and anions move in opposite direction. d. Electrical connection. The anode and cathode must be in electrical contact for a current to flow in the corrosion cell.

The removal of any one o f the four components of the simple corrosion cell will stop the corrosion reaction.

If the steel in concrete in the presence of oxygen, but without chloride, the corrosion will take place in the following several steps: 1. At the anode, iron is oxidized to the ferrous state and release electrons.

The corrosion rate can also be increased by the presence o f other ions in the concrete. According to Hime and Erlin (1987), the reaction of ferrous ions and hydroxyl ions in the presence o f chloride ions can also result in the formation of the corrosion product Fe(0H)2.

The corrosion products are ferrous hydroxide [Fe(OH)2 ], ferric hydroxide [Fe(OH)3], and hydrated ferric oxide (rust) [Fe2 0 3 .H2 0 ] etc. The relative volumes of iron and its corrosion reaction products are shown in Figure 2.7 [Nielsen, 1985]. The corrosion products will occupy a volume equal to three to six times that o f the original steel. This increase in volume induces stresses in the concrete that result in cracking, delaminating, and spalling of the

However, the true crossing section o f reinforcing bars is reduced, which may lead to failure of the structural element in concrete structures. The detailed calculation of volume expansion due to corrosion is presented in Chapter 5.

2.2.2.3 Nernst Equation For any chemical reaction, occurring under conditions of constant temperature and pressure, the driving force is measured by the decrease in free energy which accompanies the transformation of molar quantities o f the reactants to the products.

Equation 2.17 is known as the Nernst equation and it has great theoretical and practical significance. As a consequence, it is common to introduce the numerical values into the equation.

2.2.2.4 Pourbaix Diagrams Thermodynamic data ( AG" and E° values) for chemical and electrochemical reactions that may influence the corrosion o f metals in aqueous environments at 25°C have been collected by Pourbaix and co-workers [Pourbaix, 1976]. They provide the means for deciding which set o f reactions are thermodynamically favored and for predicting the most stable reaction products under specified conditions of electrode potential and solution composition.

A convenient form o f representation of such information is the Equilibrium Potential/ pH diagram (or Pourbaix diagram) in which the axes are the electrode potential and solution pH value. The domains o f stability of the various substances considered are bounded by lines that represent conditions o f equilibrium for the following classes of reaction: -chemical reactions involving H^ or OH" (vertical lines) -electrochemical reactions involving H^ of OH" (sloping lines) -electrochemical reactions without participation ofH^ or OH" (horizontal lines).

2.2.2.S Polarization In an electrochemical reaction cell, the anode releases electrons while the cathode consumes electrons. The anodic and cathodic reactions are in balance if the production and the consumption o f electrons proceed at the same rate.

This does not always happen in nature. If reaction rate at the anode is slower than the reaction rate at the cathode, a deficiency of electrons occurs at the surface of anode because electrons are consumed at the cathode at a faster rate than the anode can supply them. This deficiency o f electrons produces a positive potential change at the anode (anodic overpotential, t /^), this potential change is called anodic polarization. When the positive potential change at the anode increases, the tendency for anodic dissolution also increases. On account of this, anodic polarization represents the driving force for corrosion reaction at the anode.

I

On the other hand, if the amount of electrons supplied by anode is greater than the amount that can be consumed at the cathode, extra electrons will accumulate at the surface o f cathode waiting for reaction. Since the electrons are negatively charged, the potential of the cathode

There are three kinds of polarizations which may act separately or simultaneously, namely concentration, resistance (Ohmic) and activation polarization. 1. Concentration Polarization. Concentration polarization is caused by the concentration on the electrode surface from that of the bulk solution. An example o f this would be depletion of oxygen at the cathode. The rate o f oxygen diffusion through the concrete to the reinforcement determines the rate o f corrosion. 2. Resistance (Ohmic) Polarization. An ohmic resistance gradient occurs through the electrolyte between working electrode and auxiliary electrode when the current. I, is passed in any polarization cell [Jones, 1992]. Resistance polarization is due to an ohmic resistance in a film, e.g. an oxide film on the electrode surface, causing an ohmic potential drop, which may be written as:

(2 .21)

where R is the film resistance for all the electrode surface. 3. Activation Polarization. When some step in the half-cell reaction controls the rate of charge (electron) flow, the reaction is said to be under activation of chargetransfer control, and activation polarization results. A logarithmic relationship is obtained based on the well-known Tafel's equation [Tafel, 1904] (for Ia>10Io):

r j ^ = b \ o g ^ = a + b\ogI,,

(2 .2 2 )

where a and b are constants known as the Tafel intercept and Tafel slope parameters, respectively, and can be determined empirically /,, is applied current, and lo exchange current. The parameter is related to the exchange current lo, which is the equilibrium current flowing back and forth through the electrode electrolyte interface at equilibrium and is measured by the reversibility of the reaction. The parameter b, on the other hand, gives an insight into mechanism of the electrode reaction [Steam, 1957]. The activation polarization is strongly

dependent on the composition of the solution, particularly its content and inhibitors.

1 2 .2.6 Passivity
Passivity o f a metal is generally characterized by a thin and tightly adherent oxide film on the metal surface, which tends to protect the metal against further corrosion. The exact composition of the thin and normally invisible film has been difficult to determine. It seems clear, however, that it is made up of chemical combinations of oxygen and is simply called an oxide film. Passivity is o f two kinds: chemical and mechanical passivity.

Chemical passivity: This type of passivity is due to an invisible thin but dense and semiconducting oxide film on the metal surface, displacing the electrode potential o f the metal strongly in the positive direction.

Mechanical passivity: Mechanical passivity is due to the precipitation of solid salts on the metal surface. The cause o f strongly reduced corrosion rate in this case is a thick but more or less porous salt layer, usually non-conducting in itself.

When a potential is applied to an iron electrode, the rate o f current flow depends on the state of passivity. Iron in concrete is generally passive, such that little current flows when a potential is progressively increased, eventually the current will flow. This is because, at this point, oxygen is evolved and the electrode reaction involves the electrolysis of water.

2.2.2.1 Corrosion Rate
Corrosion process involves production and consumption of electrons. The higher the rate of corrosion reaction, the higher the rate at which electrons are released from the anode and consumed at the cathode. Thus, a quantitative description of corrosion propagation is usually given in terms o f the corrosion rate. Corrosion rate can be measured as the weight loss of metal per unit o f surface area per unit o f time {mass I area ·tim e) or depth of penetration (given as depth o f penetration per unit o f time).

22

Electron flow is represented by the current I, which is typically reported in units of amperes. The relationship between the current, /, and mass reacted, m, in a corrosion reaction is given by Faraday's Law:

m =-- nF

(2.23)

where a is the atomic weight, t is the time in which the measurement is carried out, F is Faraday constant (96500 A - s / mol ), and n is the number of electrons lost (valence change).

Most non-destructive techniques currently used for monitoring the corrosion are based on electrochemical measurements, with the corrosion rate estimated in terms of a corrosion current density, Icorr [Andrade, 1996]. Dividing the previous equation by time, t, and the surface area o f the electrode. A, one gets the corrosion rate, r, as:

(2.24)

where Icorr is the current density in amperes per square meter (A/m^) and n equals 2 for steel. If iron corrodes as a corrosion current density o f 1 u A/m^, the

The effects of the concrete pore solution (electrolyte conductivity) and the conductivity of other phases, such as corrosion product and interfacial transition, is reflected in changes in the corrosion current density.

2.2.3 Factors affecting Corrosion 2.2.3.1 Concrete Concrete normally provides reinforcing steel with excellent corrosion protection. The high alkaline environment in concrete results in the formation of a tightly adhering film which passivates the steel and protects it from corrosion. In addition, concrete can be proportioned to have a low permeability which minimizes the penetration o f corrosion-inducing substances. Low permeability also increases the electrical resistivity o f concrete which impedes the flow of electrochemical corrosion currents. However, corrosion o f steel can occur if the concrete is not of adequate quality, the structure was not properly designed for the service environment, or the environment was not as anticipated or changes during the service life o f the concrete structure. On the one hand, Portland cement forms an alkaline environment to protect the embedded steel; meanwhile, the concrete quality and thickness of concrete cover influence this protection. On the other hand, concrete acts as an electrolyte which makes corrosion may occur in it. In order to understand the concrete's properties as an electrolyte, some relative bases o f concrete will be introduced.

1. Bases of Concrete Hydration o f Portland Cement The mineral components o f cement are mainly tricalcium silicate (C 3 S), dicalcium silicate (C2S), tricaalcium aluminate (C3A), and tetracalcium ferroaluminate (C4AP). The hydration products o f cement paste are calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), calcium hydroxide (CH), and calcium sulfoaluminate. Unhydrated cement particles may also exist in the paste.

Calcium silicate hydrate. The calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) phase makes up 50 to 60 percent of the volume o f solids in a completely hydrated Portland cement paste and is the most important in determining the properties o f the paste. The morphology o f C-S-H varies from poorly crystalline fibers to. reticular network. The internal crystal structure of C-S-H also remains unresolved.

Calcium hydroxide. Calcium hydroxide crystals constitute 20 to 25 percent o f the volume of solids in the hydrated paste. In contrast to the C-S-H, the calcium hydroxide Ca(0 H)2 is a

compound with a definite stoichiometry,. It tends to form large crystals with distinctive hexagonal-prism morphology. Also, calcium hydroxide in hydrated Portland cement has an adverse effect on chemical durability to acidic solutions because o f the higher solubility of calcium hydroxide than C-S-H.

Calcium sulfoaluminates. Calcium sulfoaluminate compounds occupy 15 to 20 percent of

3

the solids volume in the hydrated paste and therefore play only a minor role in the structureproperty relationships.

Voids o f Hydrated Cement Past In addition to the solids components, hydrated cement paste (hep) contains several types of voids which have an important influence on its properties.

Interlayer space in C-S-H. It accounts for 28 percent porosity in solid C-S-H and is too small to have an adverse affect on the strength and permeability o f the hep.

Capillary voids. Capillary voids represent the space not filled by the solid components of the hep. The volume and the size of the capillary voids are determined by the original distance between the anhydrous cement particles in the freshly mixed cement paste (i.e. water/cement ratio) and the degree o f cement hydration.

Air voids. Air can be entrapped in the fresh cement paste during the mixing operation. Both the entrapped and entrained air voids in the hep are much bigger than the capillary voids, and are capable of adversely affecting its strength and impermeability.

Cement Paste Pore Solution

The composition o f the pore solution is the decisive factor in determine whether embedded steel will be passivated or whether it will be actively corroded. Researchers on the influence of a number of factors on the composition of pore solution have shown that the presence o f sodium and potassium oxides in the cement, as well as calcium hydroxide produced in the

25

hydration reactions o f cement components can give the pore solution of ordinary Portland cement a pH o f about 13 while the pH of blended cement is somewhat lower. The range of high pH values o f typical concrete is within the pH domain in which insoluble oxides of irons are thermodynamically stable to maintain a passive film on steel surface. Unfortunately, the pH value of concrete can be reduced by carbonation and by leaching.

The structure and Distribution o f Pores The structure, pore size distribution and pore connectivity in the cement phase determine the availability o f oxygen and moisture at the steel surface, both of which are necessary for the maintenance o f a passive film. They also determine the penetration or diffusion rate of chloride ions and carbon dioxide which, as mentioned above, are the two most causes in the corrosion o f embedded steel in concrete common

Pore size distributions are mainly affected by the water/cement ratio, and the degree of hydration. The size o f interlayer space (gel pore) is too small to have an adverse affect on the permeability o f the hydrated cement paste, and water in these small voids are held by hydrogen bonding. It is the capillary pore system which is responsible for diffusion and permeation and, therefore, o f importance for corrosion

Interfacial Transition Zone The microstructure o f the paste near the aggregate appears to differ from that within the bulk [Taylor, 1992]. In fact, an interfacial transition zone (ITZ) has been identified by some writers [Metha and Montiero, 1992] as a distinct phase to which separate properties are given. The significant of the interfacial region is evident fi-om the fact that the particles of aggregate are separated by rather small distances, implying that a large fraction of the interparticle volume may be composed o f microstructural gradients.

Among the solid constituents o f concrete, it is the transition zone which is the weakest link of the chain that has the greatest influence on concrete strength, elastic modulus, and permeability. At early age, ettringite and calcium hydroxide in the transition zone make this layer weak and porous. If mineral admixtures are incorporated into concrete, calcium

As mentioned earlier, the permeation of air and water is a necessary prerequisite to corrosion of steel in concrete. The characteristics of transition zone influence the durability o f concrete. The existence o f microcracks in the transition zone at the interface with steel and coarse aggregate is the primary reason that concrete is more permeable than corresponding hep or mortar.

Water in Concrete The concrete pore system filled with pore water and air provides a path for corrosion elements and the electrolyte.

Water may accumulate in concrete pores and capillaries. The amount of water depends on the pore size distribution and the humidity o f the environment. This pore water solution can be classified into different types depending on how difficult it is to remove it from concrete. Water in the hardened cement paste, it can exist in the following forms:

1. Capillary water. This is the water present in voids larger than about 50 °A. 2. Adsorbed water. This is the water that is close to the solid surface; that is, under the influence o f attractive forces, water molecules are physically adsorbed onto the surface of solids in the hep. A major portion of the adsorbed water can be lost by drying the hep to 30 percent relative humidity. 3. Interlayer water. This water is associated with C-S-H structure. It has been suggested that a monomolecular water layer between the layers of C-S-H is strongly held by hydrogen bonding. The interlayer water is lost only on strong drying (i.e. below
11

percent relative humidity).

4. Chemically combined water. This is the water that is an integral part of the structure o f various cement hydration products. This water is not lost on drying; it is evolved when the hydrates decompose on heating.

2. Effects of Concrete Environment on Corrosion Portland cement. When Portland cement hydrates, the silicates react with water to produce C-S-H and calcium hydroxide. The following simplified equations give the main reactions o f Portland cement with water

2(3CuO· SiO^) + 6 H ^ 0 - ^ 3CaO · ISiO^ ·3H ^0 + 3C a {0 H \

(2.27)

2{3CaO · 5 /O2 ) + 4 7 / 2 (9 -> 3CaO ·ISiO^ ·3H ^0 + Ca{OH)^

(2.28)

As previously mentioned, the high alkalinity of the chemical environment normally present in concrete protects the embedded steel because of the formation of a protective oxide film on the steel. The integrity and protective quality of this film depends on the alkalinity (pH) of the environment.

Calcium hydroxide crystals may be 15 to 30 percent of the weight of the original cement in a well-hydrated Portland cem ent. This is usually sufficient to maintain a solution at a pH 13 in the concrete independent o f moisture content.

The silicates are the major components in Portland cement imparting strength to the matrix. No reactions have been detected between chloride ions and silicates. Calcium chloride seems to act as an accelerator in the hydration of tri calcium silicate as well as to promote the corrosion of steel.

The chemical combining o f C3A with chlorides is fi-equently referred to as a beneficial effect in that it will reduce the rate o f chloride penetration into concrete. According to Mehta (1993), a chemical binding o f penetrating chlorides cannot be expected unless the C 3A content is higher than about
8

percent. However, recent studies have found more corrosion-

induced distress associated with high C3A content.

Concrete Quality. Concrete will offer more protection against corrosion o f embedded steel if it is of a high quality. A low water/cement ratio will slow the diffusion o f chloride, carbon

oxide, and oxygen and also the increase in strength of the concrete, which may extend the time before corrosion-induced stresses cause cracking of the concrete. The pore volume and permeability can be reduced by lowering the water/cement ratio. The type o f cement or use of superplasticizers and mineral admixtures may also be an important factor in controlling the permeability and the ingress o f chlorides [Gjorv and Vennesland, 1979].

Thickness o f Concrete Cover over Steel. The amount of concrete cover over the steel should be as large as possible, consistent with good structural design, the severity of the service environment, and cost. The effect o f cover thickness is more than a simple linear relationship. Considering the normal diffusion of an electrolyte into a porous solid without chemical reaction, a relationship would be anticipated. However, in the case of cement paste, the diffusion o f chloride ions into the paste is accompanied by both physical adsorption and chemical binding. These effects reduce the concentration o f chloride ion at any particular site and hence the tendency for inward diffusion is further reduced.

Concrete as an Electrolyt The concrete pore system as mentioned above filled with air and pore water solution provides an excellent path for deleterious substance and acts as an electrolyte. In mature concrete water movement is controlled by cracking and the hep properties. Furthermore, the movement of water in hep depends on changes in pore structure due to continued hydration, as well as changing the solubility o f its constituents.

All properties o f concrete as an electrolyte will influence the character of the electrochemical reactions significantly by changing the conditions required for cathodic and anodic processes. The most fundamental characteristic of electrochemical reactions is the difference in mechanism and the rate o f oxygen supply under different corrosion conditions: through the liquid electrolyte (corrosion of metal in solution), through a thin film of electrolyte (such as atmospheric corrosion), or through a solid microporpus electrolyte (such as steel corrosion in concrete). In solution, access o f oxygen to the corroding surface o f the metal is dependent primarily on diffusion, and in concrete, on its structure (pore size distribution, porosity and pore connecticity), degree o f saturation and cover depth. The corrosion process (or rate of corrosion) in concrete also is dependent on the conductivity o f concrete electrolyte system.

Permeability in Hydrated Cement Paste. Permeability is defined as the ease with which a fluid can flow through a solid. It should be obvious that the size and continuity of the pores in the structure o f the solid determine its permeability. Stiength and permeability of the hep are two sides of the same coin in the sense that both are closely related to the capillary porosity or the solid/space ratio. As hydration proceeds, the void space between the originally discrete cement particles gradually begins to fill up with hydration products. It has been shown that the water/cement ratio and the degree of hydration determine the total capillary porosity, which decreases with the decreasing water/cement ratio and/or increasing degree o f hydration.

1.13.2 Other Effects
Moisture. The rate of electrochemical reaction in a corrosion cell depends upon the moisture content in the vicinity o f reinforcement in concrete. The moisture content in hardened concrete depends upon the water/cement ratio used for mixing the ingredients, and circulation of free water absorbed from the surrounding environment. The water content in fresh concrete must be just sufficient for hydration of cement. However, for easy workability more water is added. Evaporation o f this excess water makes concrete more permeable. Therefore, the water/cement ratio and the impermeability of concrete play an important role in the corrosion process in concrete structures.

Oxygen Availability. All o f the corrosion processes described above requires oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, the corrosion rate is appreciably reduced even with chloride concentration above the threshold level, except in acid solution. So, the availability of oxygen is one o f the main controlling factors for corrosion of steel. The penetration of oxygen in different concentrations at different places causes the formation of differential aeration cells which in turn produce the potential difference and flow o f current. The corrosion which is quantitatively measured in grams of steel per year depends upon the oxygen flow rate to the reinforcement through the concrete cover.

Chapter 3 Review of Bond Slip
In this Chapter the mechanisms of bond are discussed, first by introducing the conception of bond slip and the process of bond failure. The factors, which can affect the bond behavior significantly, are described. Two types of experiments that are frequently used in the study

of bond slip behavior are presented, and the general calculation in terms of bond slip is reviewed. The stress redistribution and deformations in concrete associated with bond are Finally the relationship between bond slip and corrosion is investigated.

3.1 Mechanism of Bond
3.1.1 Conception of Bond-Slip Tlie capability o f reinforced concrete member in resisting the external loads depend on the compatibility of the concrete materials and reinforcing bars in the tension area. In order to I I maintain composite action, some stress transformation between the concrete and steel bars is necessary, this transformation behavior is called bond. Usually it is assumed perfect bond in the analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) structures, which implies full compatibility between

concrete and reinforcement strains. This assumption is valid only in regions where there is no slip between the concrete and reinforcing bars [Keuser and Mehlhom, 1987], this behavior takes place at early loading stages and at low strain levels. The reinforcing bars have to undergo the same strain or deformation as the surrounding concrete in order to prevent the discontinuity or separation o f the two materials under loads. As the load increases, cracks will appear, and a certain amount of bond stresses in terms of relative displacement between concrete and reinforcement, usually called bond-slip, takes place. All of them will in turn affect the stress distribution in both steel and concrete. The stress and relative displacement between concrete and the reinforcement steel are extremely higher near the cracks. It results

in different strains in the steel rebars and in the surrounding concrete,

3.

n According to Lutz and Gergely (1967), bond can be conceived as compromising three components, chemical adhesion, friction, and mechanical interaction between concrete and steel. ol
ri

Bond of plain bar depends primarily on the first two of these mechanisms, although there is some mechanical interlocking due to the roughness of bar surface. The effect of the chemical adhesion in bond is normally considered very small. Once slip occurs, the bond of plain bar is only developed by means o f faction between the bar and the surrounding concrete.

Deformed bars primarily depend on the interlocking o f the ribs with the surrounding concrete. This does not mean that friction and chemical adhesion are negligible in the case of deformed bar, but they are secondary. This investigation will focus on the study of bond behavior in the deformed bars ` ?

According to ACI Committee 408 (1966), bond stress can be defined as the unit shear force acting parallel to the bar on the interface between bar and concrete. In transferring from concrete to bar, this shear stress - bond stress modifies the steel stress in the bar, either increasing or decreasing it. The bond stress is usually measured by the stress per unit area of bar surface, using the nominal surface o f the deformed bar which ignores the extra surface created by the lugs and ribs. Bond stress can also be measured by the rate of change of steel stress in the bar. Attention must be paid to that unless the bar stress changes, there is no bond stress existing between the concrete and reinforced bars. The principle is also correct in contra verse. } J

3.1.2 The Process of Bond Failure The process o f bond failure can be divided into several stages according to the phenomenon of failure of chemical cohesion, the appearance of cracks and crushed concrete in front of ribs (Figure 3.1).

deformations with no relative slip, or with negligible slip, but highly localized stresses arise close to rib tips.

After increasing the values o f average bond stress with the increasing of loads, interaction between the ribs and concrete occurs. This interaction induces large bearing stresses under the ribs. Also the highly localized tensile stresses at the tip of the ribs result in opening transverse cracks in the concrete (Figure 3.2).

Figure 3.3 shows the stresses developed between two ribs o f a deformed bars, they include: (a) Shear stresses V g, developed through adhesion along the surface o f the bar. (b) Bearing stresses fb, against the face of the rib. (c) Shear stresses V c, acting on the cylindrical concrete surface between adjacent ribs.

As soon as transverse cracking occurs, the transverse cracks decrease concrete stiffness and countenance bar slip. The concrete will be crushed in front of the ribs and form a crushed concrete wedge which enhances the wedging action of the bars against the surrounding concrete. Also large hoop stresses will arise in the concrete layer close to the bar, which may cause localized longitudinal cracks lying in plane passing through the bar axis which cause splitting cracking. The concrete keys will also deform in such a way that they tend to move away from the bar surface. As the chemical adhesion is destroyed, the wedging action of the ribs will push the concrete away and separate the concrete from steel as shown in Figure 3.4.

The stress condition in the vicinity of the crack is very complex. For an example. Figure 3.5 shows bond stress distribution in the area subjected to the pure moment in the simply supported beam test. It can be found that even when shear is zero and moment is constant, ' the bond stress is so variable that the average bond stress seems more significant than the 35

local value at any particular point, especially in the place where flexural cracking exists. Each such cracks, creates points o f bond stress concentration which influences the average usable stress.

As the load continue to increase, both transverse and longitudinal cracks spread; and the splitting tend to outbreak through the whole cover. In the case of deformed bars confined by an adequate amount of transverse reinforcement, bond failure would be pullout. On the contrary, in the case of the cover or confinement is insufficient, bond failure would occur in the form of splitting which means the splitting cracks spread across the whole cover of the bars.

3.2 Factors Affecting Bond Performance
3.2.1 Reinforcement Rusting The bar rusting, which consists o f a thin coating of iron oxide, is a result of the exposure of the steel bar to the environment. It may result from cooling down from rolling temperature. Such type of rusting can improve the bond behavior because it increases the surface roughness and hence the frictional force. But if corrosion happens and continues to rust, it will reduce bond stress between the reinforced bars and concrete.

Figure 3.6 Failure Mechanisms at the Ribs of Deformed Bars

Deformation Patterns of Steel Bars It has been proved by many researchers that the deformation pattern o f a reinforcing bar can affect bond response. It is characterized by the rib spacing (5/?), rib height (A), bar diameter (t/t), rib face angle and pattern. Furthermore, we can use the relative rib area (/Je) of the reinforcing bar can be used to represent these parameters in the analysis. The relative rib area is defined as the rib area perpendicular to the bar axis normalized by the bar surface area between ribs. A,

where Â r is the area o f the projection of a single rib on the cross-section of a bar. The generally accepted values 0.05-0.10 represent a good compromise for_/J? in terms of ultimate bond strength, splitting ability, industrial requirement, good service-load performances (limited crack opening and cover splitting). Results of study conducted by Darwin and Graham (1993) indicate that increased relative rib area results in increased bond stiffiiess and increased strength for specimens that do not exhibit a splitting-type bond failure. A study conducted by Hamad (1995) shows similar results through increased bond strength is observed for specimens that exhibit a splitting-type bond failure as well as for those that exhibit a pullout failure. Hamad concludes that specimens with rib face angles in excess of 45 degrees exhibit increased strength over bars with face angle less than 45 degrees. However, the importance of the confinement should be always kept in mind.

Steel Stress Level The non-linear behavior o f bond-slip depends on the steel stress level in the concrete. In the pullout tests, the steel stress is kept relatively small and cannot play any significant role. However, in long anchorages the reinforcement stresses are higher, but still their role can be neglected as long as rib bearing is the force transferring mechanism (with concrete crushing in front o f the ribs and/or cover splitting). In fact, the transverse deformation coupled with the longitudinal steel stress is small in comparison with rib height (Poissons' effect). However, when the force transfer mechanism is based mostly on friction (as in smooth bars and pretensioned strands) the local transverse deformation of the bar cannot be disregarded, since the surface roughness and the transverse reduction o f bar diameter may have the same magnitude. This transverse contraction may considerably reduce the radial compressive stress and, hence, the frictional bond stress.

For ribbed bars the influence o f steel stress is small as long as the steel is in the elastic range. However, experimental results show that yielding has a drastic negative effect on the bond

mechanism resulting in a non-linear descending branch in the bond-slip relationship at the very onset o f yielding [Shima et al., 1987]. Hence, the bond stress-slip relationship can be influenced not only by the softening of surrounding concrete, but also by the softening o f the steel at yielding. The effect on the bond-stress development similar to the effect of splitting cracks through the concrete cover. The influence of steel yielding is yet not well understood.

3.2.2 Concrete Quality and Stress State Since bond action results from the localized pressure underneath the ribs and is directly related to the shear component of the interface forces, bond performances depend on both concrete multiaxial behavior in compression fc and on concrete tensile strength fd. Mirza and Houde (1979) examined the influence of concrete strength and the thickness of the concrete cover, they found that the slip increases linearly with the increase in the concrete strength and the specimen dimension up to a certain size.

The stress state in the concrete surrounding a bar also has a significant effect on bond action. Transverse tensile forces worsen the behavior o f both splitting-prone anchorages and splices, and may even turn a pullout failure into a splitting failure. In both cases, the situation is even worse if further tensile stresses are present, owing to temperature and shrinkage effects.

Transverse compressive forces favor bond action, depending on their nature (active or passive confinement). Active confinement is always favorable, particularly in a splitting-prone situation, but becomes almost irrelevant in a friction-type situation with large cover values. Passive confinement requires a certain amount of crack slip and opening to be activated, and is helpful after cover splitting. Finally, it should be noted that the state of tension within the concrete that is parallel to the reinforcement impairs the efficiency o f bond markedly [CEB-FIP, 2000].

3.2.3 Load History Bond behavior is also influenced by load history. Since the load repetition, rate, frequency and long-term action have a remarkable influence on concrete strength and defonnability, they can affect bond performance significantly. As a result, not only the bond-stress relationship, but also the failure model, either splitting or pullout, are affected by the load history. The loading rate has a strong influence on bond stiffness and resistance. The higher

the loading rate and the higher the concrete strength, the greater the mechanical properties of the bond in deformed bars.

The data provided by Eligehausen et al. (1983) contributes to characterization of the bond-slip response for deformed reinforcement subjected to monotonie load history. Figure 3.7 shows bond stress distribution curves corresponding to a number of load increments. As the tensile load increased, the form of the distribution curve generally changes slightly. Nevertheless, it was impossible to describe the curves by any simple consistent form. In general, with increasing load, there was a consistent increase in the bond stress at almost all points.

For the cyclic load condition, the reverse cycling at low bond stress deteriorates bond behavior during cycling, but not at ultimate. On the contrary, reverse cycling (above 80% of bond static strength) leads to sort of shake down [ACI Committee 408,1966].

3.3 Experimental Investigation
There are many types o f experiments are available in the study of bond behavior shown from the past research. One o f them is pullout test which was first introduced by Rehm in 1958. The test is carried out by anchoring one deformed bar in a plain concrete block, then it is subjected to monotonically increasing tensile load till failure. It is noted that sufficient concrete cover must be provided in order to guarantee the failure in the form of pullout.

Rehm (1958) did series of pullout tests with the face angle of ribs on the reinforcing bar varied from 30 to 105 degrees. He concluded that the response of specimens with rib face angles greater than 40 degrees was approximately in the same bond stress value and thus apparently is independent of rib face angle.

Later Lutz et al. (1966) convinced the Rehm's test results, they pointed out that the concrete in the vicinity of the bar and extending in front of the ribs a distance equal to 5 to 7 times of the height of the ribs is crushed under moderate bond demand and that a zone of crushed concrete extending in front of the ribs a distance of at most twice the height of the ribs, moves with the reinforcing bar as slip occurs.

Lutz and Gergeley (1967) carried out another investigation of bond response, they presented a comprehensive evaluation of the mechanisms of bond response for systems with deformed reinforcement. It shows that the bond of deformed bars is developed mainly by bearing pressure of the bar ribs against the concrete. According to Lutz and Gergeley, slip of deformed bars can occur in two ways: (1) the ribs can push the concrete away from the bar

(wedging action), and (2) the ribs can crush the concrete.

Lutz and Gergely (1967) also investigated the effect of cracking on the bond stress and the stress distribution in the concrete beam. One simply supported beam is used in their experiment as shown in Figure 3.8.

Figure 3.8 Beam Dimensions for Test by Lutz and Gergely (1967)

The test results show that the circumferential tensile stresses in the concrete around the bar are very small prior to flexural cracking. However, near transverse cracks bonding forces cause large circumferential tensile stress. Also, radial tensile stresses, acting normal to the concrete-steel interface, destroy contact near the crack and allow separation and slip of the bar (Figure 3.4). Due to the large longitudinal concrete tensile stresses, internal transverse cracks form, and radial (splitting) cracks can start at transverse cracks due to the large circumferential stresses. They also used elastic finite element method to analyze a cylinder of concrete with a concentrically embedded reinforcing bar. The results of the finite element analysis are quite close to the situation existing between two flexural cracks near a reinforcing bar in a reinforced concrete as shown in Figure 3.9.

Goto (1971) conducted tension test and provided additional understanding of the wedging action o f reinforcing ribs acting against concrete. This experimental investigation focused on characterizing the concrete damage associated with tensile bond stress. The prototype specimen consists o f a single, deformed reinforcing bar embedded in a plain concrete prism. The tension was loaded through the exposed ends of the bar. Cracks in the concrete were penetrated by ink from special injection holes. Afterwards the prisms were cut axially and the cracks colored by the ink became visible. The slopes of the internal cracks, from 45 to 80 degrees, indicate the trajectories along which the compressive forces leave the ribs of the deformed bar and spread out into the concrete. Their slope also depends on whether the ribs are lateral, diagonal or staggered about the axis of the bar. The slopes of the internal cracks would be different and have different values on each side o f the bar if the test specimen constituted an anchorage zone in a beam. The dimensions o f the surrounding concrete will

also influence the slope.

A study presented by Tepfers (1979) was one of the first investigations to focus on predication o f bond strength for deformed reinforcement. Tepfer studied theoretically the circumferential stress distribution over the thick-walled cylinder confining the reinforcing bar. These circumferential tensile stresses are caused by the outward stresses from the action of the deformed bar on the concrete cylinder as shown in Figure 3.10. Tepfers proposed that bond strength is determined by the capacity of the concrete surrounding the reinforcing bars to carry the hoop stresses. Three modes of system failure were proposed: elastic, partially cracked-elastic and plastic. The data presented by Tepfers supported the proposition that bond strength is determined by the hoop stresses developed in the surrounding concrete. The data also supported the conclusion that the partially cracked elastic model proposed by Tepfers results in a lower bound bond strength.

5) The size effect; 6) The concrete type (HSC, NSC, FEC); 7) The environment and the effect on bond (bar corrosion; high/low temperature);

8) The boundary conditions. As it is very difficulty to include all of the above aspects in the calculation, only some parts o f effects are considered in the analysis approach. In this investigation, the bond slip in the macroscopic level was considered.

Since the Young modulus of elasticity of steel varies between the elastic and the non-elastic region (Figure 3.13), Marti's assumption was based on the change of the Young modulus of elasticity o f steel, and he conceded that the bond stress will have two constant values one before yielding and one after it.

3.4.2 Stress Redistribution After Cracking Concrete is a type of material that is very weak in tension, so whenever it is subjected to tensile force greater than its tensile strength, primary cracks (Figure 3.16), which are at roughly right angles to element axis (transverse cracking), start to form.

The analysis o f transverse cracking should be based on bond modeling since concrete strain mainly depends on steel strain. So in this case, a nonlinear relationship should be used (Figure 3.17) [Russo and Romano, 1992].

Once the elastic behavior of concrete ends a transverse crack starts to appear but since cracking is not controlled, the fracture process spreads abruptly across the whole section.

3.4.2.1 Transient Cracking In case of a member that is subjected to tension from both sides (Figure 3.15), for a low

of load and steel strain at the loaded end, the slip vanishes before reaching the

symmetry axis (as in long members). The element will not crack as long as there is no enough length for which the steel will transmit enough strain to concrete in order to crack. In this case, any further load increase may produce a different member response [Ouyan and Shah, 1994];

After the formation of the first primary crack, a second-generation of primary cracks occur, for a somewhat higher load levels. Before this second generation each part is in a load situation similar to the one of the original (uncracked) member but with a smaller length. A crack pattern reaches to a stabilized state when the length of a single part is no more sufficient to allow the concrete strain to reach the failure value in tension.

Figure 3.19 Steel, Concrete and Bond Stress Variation along the Bar at Different States

As a result for the transient cracking bond property will be affected and it will start to fluctuate each time a new crack take place. The bond variation comes as compatibility requirement as both concrete and steel stress varies drastically at crack location. Hence, theoretically stresses distribution for all variable will have the shapes proposed by Leonhardt [1964] (Figure 3.19).

3.4.2.2 Tension Stiffening In a reinforced concrete member that is subjected to tension, its tensile force is resisted by both the reinforcing steel and surrounding concrete. Only across a crack is the load carried entirely by the reinforcement. Consequently the strains in a bar embedded in concrete are smaller than those in a naked one. So, the decrease in steel strain due to the concrete may be considered as a stiffness increase of the reinforcement compared to the naked bar. This bond-related phenomenon is known as "tension-stiffening" [Giuriani, 1982].

Figure 3.20 Tension Stiffening: Tensile Stress Versus (Mean) Tensile Strain

The increase of stiffiiess in the regions between adjacent cracks (tension stiifening) can be included by either considering the tensile resistance of concrete or by increasing the tensile stiffness and strength o f the steel bar. Tension stiffening mostly affects the member response under serviceability conditions, because the effect of bond is completely lost when member failure occurs.

3.5 Relationship between Corrosion and Bond Slip
Corrosion can affect bond behavior significantly in the reinforced concrete members. The loss of bond strength may also result from the opening of longitudinal cracks along the reinforcement due to radial tensile stresses induced at the steel/concrete interface by the expansive products of conosion. This strength loss can even cause serviceability failure in reinforced concrete members, if it reaches a certain extent. So it is very important to study the relationship between corrosion and bond slip.

Corrosion can affect bond strength in several ways. The relationship between bond slip and corrosion is shown in Figure 3.21 ;

·

Increase in the diameter o f a corroding bar at first leads to an increase in radial stress between bar and concrete and hence increase the friction component of bond. However, further corrosion will lead to development of longitudinal cracking and a reduction in the resistance to the bursting forces generated by bond action.

·

Corrosion products at the bar/concrete interface will affect friction at the interface. A firmly adherent layer o f rust may contribute to an enhancement in bond strength at early stages of corrosion [Al-Sulaimani et al., 1990; Amleh and Mirza, 1999]. At more advanced stages o f corrosion, weak and friable material between bar and

concrete will certainly be at least partially responsible for reductions in bond strength [Cabrera and Ghodussi, 1992], · Corrosion may reduce the height of the ribs of a deformed bar. However, this is unlikely to be significant except at advanced stages of corrosion. · Disengagement o f ribs and concrete. The layer of corrosion products formed by oxidation o f the steel may force the concrete away fi' om the bar and reduce the effective bearing area o f the ribs.

Many researchers have carried out experimental work to investigate the relationship between bond and corrosion [Al-Sulaimani et al., 1990; Andrade et al., 1993; Almusallam et al., 1996; Amleh and Mirza, 1999; Amleh, 2000]. From their test, we can conclude that:

(a) Effects o f corrosion on the slip and ultimate bond strength For a small degree o f corrosion in the precracking stage (0-4%), the ultimate load increases with the degree of corrosion increasing, whereas the corresponding slip at the ultimate load decreases. It has been observed that for a small degree of corrosion of the reinforcing bar, significant mechanical pressure is exerted on the surrounding concrete before cracking occurs. This pressure is caused by the development of expansive corrosion products which increase the reactionary confinement and the mechanical interlocking of concrete around the bar. Secondly, in the initial stages of corrosion, the roughness o f the bar is also increased, thereby enhancing the friction between the bar and the surrounding concrete. Both of these effects increase the bond resistance and decrease the slip of the bar. In this precracking stage, the bond failure o f the specimen resulted from the crushing of concrete keys adjacent to the lugs without any splitting o f the specimen.

In the cracking stage (4-6%), the specimens with a relative low level o f corrosion (4-5%), exhibited a linear relationship between load and slip up to almost ultimate bond strength;

thereafter, a sudden drop occurs which continues to show increasing slip at decreasing loads. The reason for the sudden drop in load-slip curve at ultimate load can be attributed to the sudden splitting o f the concrete cover over the bar.

In the post-cracking corrosion (8% or more), considerable slip occurred at ultimate load stage, before failure was observed. Also, the value of the ultimate bond strength remains more or less the same. The reason for this behavior can be explained as follows; (1) With an increased level o f reinforcement corrosion, a significant degradation of the ribs occurs and the deformed steel bar starts acting more and more like a plain bar. The horizontal component of the bearing force produced as a result o f mechanical interlocking of the ribs is therefore significantly reduced. The pullout action is therefore facilitated and occurs at a lower load. (2) Accumulation of a heavy layer of the flaky corroded material around the bar acts as a lubricant and reduces the fiiction component of the bond strength. (3) The third important factor in the post-cracking stage is the width of the crack corresponding to a particular level of corrosion. The formation of cracks around the reinforcing bar reduces its confinement in the concrete to the extent that practically any cumulative negative effect of the above mentioned two parameters (1) and (2) do not affect the ultimate bond strength..

(b) Effect o f crack width on the bond strength From the test results done by other researchers [Stanish, 1997; Alonso et al., 1998; Amleh and Mirza, 1999; Amleh, 2000], it is shown that the ultimate bond load is reduced abruptly at the initial stages of the formation of cracks and the associated resulting reduction in the confinement. After a certain degree of corrosion, the effect of crack width on the bond strength decreases, and beyond a certain level, it does not affect the bond strength significantly. The reason for this is that, because of sufficiently wide cracks, the reinforcing

61

·(

bar has already lost much of its confinement, and a further increase in crack width does not cause any further reduction in the confining force.

The loss in the rib profile also affects the ultimate bond strength. Initially an increase in the bond strength was noted with a loss of rib profile. However, sharp reduction in the ultimate bond strength for rib degradation was recorded. After about 43% loss in the rib profile, the bond strength does not vary significantly right up to 100% rib degradation. The cause for such a change in the ultimate bond strength with rib profile degradation can be explained as follows: (1) Initially, in the precracking stage, the increase in the bond strength, in spite of some loss in the rib profile, can be attributed to the increase both in the reactionary confinement and the roughness of the bar in contact with

concrete. The increase in bond strength, as a result of both of these factors, overshadows the reduction in the bond strength due to rib degradation. (2) A sharp reduction in the ultimate bond strength for a reduction in the rib profile may be attributed to the formation of small corrosion cracks around the reinforcing bars and a significant reduction in the rib profile with resulting reduction in the interlocking action between ribs and concrete. (3) The significant change in the bond strength due to the reduction in the rib profile in the range 43-100% indicates that the ribs are degraded to the extent that their interlocking action with the concrete becomes negligible. The confinement of the bar with the concrete is therefore significantly reduced. Thus, beyond this level of corrosion, further degradation of the ribs does not affect the bond strength to any noticeable extent.

Chapter 4 Finite Element Modeling
As discussed in Chapter 2, one of the phenomena as result o f corrosion of steel bars in the concrete structures is cracking. In this chapter, an introduction to ATENA software is first presented. The progress of cracking due to corrosion is analyzed by the finite element method. Two finite element models, smeared crack model and discrete crack model, are introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are discussed. The software ATENA is used in this research. It is based on the smeared crack model. Some basic concepts of smeared crack model are described. The formulation and analysis procedure of fracture analysis o f concrete are studied. The SBETA material model is adopted in the research.

4.1 ATENA Program
Nonlinear finite element analysis of concrete and reinforced concrete structures has developed steadily in recent decades. The worldwide research effort led to the formulation of sound constitutive models as well as numerical techniques for their implementation in computer software. ATENA is such new generation software established on the basis of finite element (FE) software SBETA. It is targeted for tlie simulation of the real behavior of concrete and reinforced concrete structures.

The advantage o f ATENA is that it can apply nonlinear finite element analysis in the practical engineering design. This program featuring nonlinear material models provides the analysis of entire structures, or structural members with very realistic material behavior, and a simulation of structural performance under real loading conditions and reflects current practice codes and standards.

Nonlinear finite element analysis can eliminate the inconsistency, which exists in the currently used design procedures between the internal force distributions determined from a linear elastic analysis and the section proportioning based on a nonlinear material behavior. The redistribution o f internal forces due to a nonlinear material behavior is taken fully into account and a resulting stress and deformation state satisfies all three requirements of mechanics: equilibrium of forces, compatibility of deformations and material laws.

The constitutive model in SBETA covers all important features of concrete and reinforced concrete behavior. It is based on the concept of smeared cracks, damage and fracture mechanics discussed in Chapter 4. The smeared concept allows using the standard FE technique, known well from the linear elastic analysis. Furthermore, it extends to the nonlinear behavior in the pre-failure range including both material and geometrical nonlinearities. For this state prior to failure, SBETA uses a diffused damage concept.

The band crack theory is implemented in the software. The concrete failure in both, tension (cracking) and compression (crushing) causes discontinuities in the displacement fields, which are in basic disagreement with the assumptions of continuum mechanics. On the macro level concrete failure exhibits itself in the form of strain softening, and is of strongly localized nature. Therefore, the special techniques based on localization limiters in form of crack bands are used in order to handle properly the post-peak behavior of concrete within the finite element model.

Besides, the reinforcement is modeled in two ways, either as smeared one, or as discrete bar elements. The software provides efficient solution techniques, pre- and post-processing routines make it possible to monitor the structural behavior with all details. Large deformations, effects of temperature, shrinkage and prestressing can also be considered.

Although it can also deal with the three-dimensional material behavior, it is limited to the two-dimensional plane stress state in this research.

In summary, the ATENA program, which is determined for nonlinear finite element analysis o f structures, provides all tools necessary for this investigation especially for computer simulation of concrete and reinforced concrete structure behavior.

4.2 Finite Element Modeling of Crack
The Finite Element Method has been proved to be an efficient method in structural analysis and broadly used in the current engineering practice and research work. One of application is to study the propagation of crack in the concrete structures. Due to the difference in the material properties between the concrete and steel, the finite element modeling for the fracture o f concrete is more complex than that for metal.

4.2.1 Two Basic Models Although there are lots of models available in the research paper, traditionally, the description o f cracking and failure within finite element analysis of concrete has led to two fundamental different approaches; smeared crack model and discrete inter-element crack model. They represent two distinct viewpoints on the problem of modeling damage in quasi-brittle materials. In this section, two models are introduced and the advantages and disadvantages o f each model are discussed. As more convenient in application, the smeared crack model is more popular than discrete crack model in the fracture analysis of concrete. The discrete crack approach is the direct application of the type o f material models. If uses discrete cracks that form between the elements shown in Figure 4.1 (a). Methods pertaining to discrete crack approach account for each crack individually in an explicit way in the FE mesh. After pioneering works in which cracks would be allowed to open between existing continuum elements according to a maximum stress criterion [Ngo and Scordelis, 1967;

65

Nilson, 1968], procedures for general crack propagation with remeshing based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) were developed for concrete structures [Ingraffea, 1977; Saouma, 1981]. In this approach, elastic behavior is assumed everywhere in the structure except at the crack tip, where a stress singularity develops and energy is dissipated to propagate the crack. Soon, though, it was recognized that for quasi-brittle materials, a fracture process zone (FPZ) with dimensions related to the size o f microstructural heterogeneities exists ahead o f the crack tip, where material behavior is nonlinear and energy is dissipated. Except for very large structures where the size of the FPZ is negligible and LEFM is applicable, consideration of the FPZ turns out to be very important in quasi-brittle materials. In the fictitious crack model (FCM) [Hillerborg et al., 1976], the FPZ is represented by a fictitious extension of the crack beyond the tip, with normal opening related to the normal stress by a softening law enclosing an area gJ (fracture energy under Mode I). Although not strictly required [Carpinteri, 1989; Gopalaratnam and Ye, 1991], the most flexible implementation of the FCM in an FE context is achieved by using zero-thickness interface elements along the crack path [Bittencourt et al., 1992]. This in general requires remeshing when the crack propagates, although in some cases that can be avoided if crack path is known in advance (e.g., a three-point bending beam) or by introducing interface elements along all conceivable paths from the beginning of the analysis.

The counterpart o f the discrete crack concept is the smeared crack concept, in which a cracked solid is imagined to be a continuum with the notion of stress and strain. It characterizes cracking as systems of parallel cracks continuously distributed over finite element as shown in Figure 4.1 (b). The behavior o f cracked concrete can then be described in terms of stress-strain relations and it is sufficient to switch from the initial isotropic stress-strain relation to an orthotropic stress-strain relation upon cracking. As a consequence, the topology of the original finite element mesh remains preserved which is computationally convenient.

Figure 4.1 Two Finite Element Models of Crack Analysis

The smeared crack approach, introduced by Rashid (1968), has become the most widely used approach in practice. The reasons may be given for adopting this approach; 1. The procedure is computationally convenient. 2. Distributed damage in general and densely distributed parallel cracks in particular are often observed in structures (measurements of the locations of sound emission sources provide evidence of a zone of distributed damage in fi-ont of a fracture). 3. At many size scales, a crack in concrete is not straight but highly tortuous, and such a crack may be adequately represented by a smeared crack bond.

However, there are serious problems with the classical smeared crack models. They are in principle nonobjective, since they can exhibit spurious mesh sensitivity [Bazant, 1976], i.e., the results may depend significantly on the choiee of the mesh size (element size) by the analyst. Bazant (1983) modified this method, he proposed blunt cracked band model whose distinguishing characteristic is that no finite element is allowed to become smaller than a certain characteristic length W c which is material property and is related to the size of inhomogeneity in the material. The cracked band theory solved the problems encountered in the previous application of smeared crack model such as exhibiting spurious mesh sensitivity

and convergence to an incorrect failure mode with zero energy dissipation in the stability analysis of strain softening and no size effect in the geometrically similar meshes, while test results for brittle failures o f concrete structures as well as fracture specimens show a pronounced size effect. Extended to describe progressive cracking characterized by gradual strain softening, the crack band model was shown to agree with all of the basic experiment data fi'om concrete or rock fi-acture testing.

Theoretically the discrete crack model is more suitable to capture the failure localization as it is directly based on the principles of fracture mechanics or the fractious crack concepts. However, since an adaptive re-meshing technique is required to account for phenomena such as progressive failure, the smeared crack model is more acceptable for engineering practice. In smeared crack model the cracking can be analyzed by modification of the material properties of the cracked elements. That means it is more easily ineorporated in the current structural analysis software and no special software packages are needed.

The geometry of finite element is very important factor in the modeling o f structures by finite element method. In the discrete crack model a node must be separated into two nodes to allow the crack to form, thus increasing the number of nodes, changing the topological connectivity of the mesh, and destroying the band structure of the structural stiffiiess matrix. Furthermore the discrete crack model is not easy in computation of no bias for the direction and unknown crack direction, since this may need re-mesh or refine the original mesh when the new crack direction does not closely coincides with existing element lines. Also it might be less realistic to achieve required objective, since no condition on minimum admissible crack spacing is used in this model.

As mentioned before, basically two models are equivalent for the reason that fracture propagation depends essentially on the flux of energy into the fracture process zone at the

68

crack front, and this flux is global characteristic of the entire structure, depending little on the detail stress and strain distributions near the fracture front. But since the smeared crack model is more efficient for computation in the finite element method, now the smeared crack model seems to retain the dominant role in the fracture analysis of concrete. In this research smeared crack model is used by the application of software ATENA.

4.2.2 Basic Concepts in Crack Modeling 4.2.2.1 Strain Softening Strain softening is a phenomenon that within the fracture zone, stress decreases with increasing tensile strain. A widely used assumption is a triangular stress-strain diagram for uniaxial loading. Figure 4.2a shows a linear strain softening, stress (cracking initiation); and is the strain at the peak

cracking). Later various experimental evidences indicate that it is more realistic to assume a strain-softening curve with a steep initial decline followed by an extended tail. Figure 4.2b shows such exponential strain softening.

4.2.2.2 Fracture Process Zone (Blunt Front Zone) The fracture process zone representing that part of nonlinear zone in which the material undergoes progressive microcracking manifested by strain softening. It is usually small in ductile fracture of metals, but in concrete it is often very large (compared to the cross section o f the structure), due to the large size of aggregate. In addition, since the plastic deformation o f concrete in tension is negligible and a horizontal plateau does not precede strain softening in tensile test, the boundary of the fracture process zone may be considered to be nearly identical to the boundary of the nonlinear zone, whereas in metals these boundaries are far apart as demonstrated in Figure 4.3. Consequently, compared to fracture analysis of metals by J-integral, the energy of the crack band can be directly use in analysis the fracture. Thus the analysis can be carried out following the hypothesis that fracture in a heterogeneous material can be modeled as a band of parallel, density distributed microcracks within this blunt front zone.

experiences both displacement and stress discontinuity. The second part, the fracture process zone, is an area o f microcracking. Stresses may still be transferred across the fracture process zone. This area experiences the displacement discontinuity but stress continuity. The last part is the intact material. This area extends from the tip of fracture process zone into concrete and is an undamaged area. The concrete tensile stress is equal to / , ' at the tip o f the fracture process zone and decreases through the fracture process zone to become zero at the beginning of the true crack. The crack is assumed to propagate when stress at the tip of the fracture process zone equals / / .

The softening behavior of concrete and its relation to the fictitious crack model is also shown in Figure 4.4. Point W2 begins zero stress area on the graph, and this corresponds to the tip of the true crack of the Hillerborg model. Since there is nothing bridging the true crack, stress can be transmitted across it, as shown by the zero stress value at point W2 on the graph. The area between W2 and Wj corresponds to an area o f cracking the fracture process zone where the crack is bridged by aggregate. Because of the aggregate bridging stresses may be transmitted cross the crack. This is shown by the slope between point W2 and Wj on the graph. For a given crack opening in the fracture process zone, there will be some stress transmitted. Above point W] on the graph, the slope of the line increases, this corresponds to the area o f the fracture process zone where microcracking occurs. Since there is no true crack or any aggregate bridging in this area, the stresses can be transmitted across the area better than in the area of the fracture process zone with aggregate bridging. At the crack tip, the stress reaches and the crack opening is zero, which is the zero point on the graph and the

the strain softening is caused not only by microcracking but also by any bond ruptures, the fracture process zone could be much wider (as well as longer) than the region of visible microcracks. The scatter for the microcracks relative to a smooth line for the macrocraks approximated by homogeneous continuum can be characterized as a microcrack band.

inhomogeneous materials, the equivalent continuum stresses and strains are defined as the averages o f the microstresses and microstrains over a certain representative volume. The cross section of this volume should be idealized to be much larger than the size of the in homogeneities, usually several times the maximum aggregate size for the concrete. That means the analysis result only reflect the average stress and accumulated strain over the cross section o f the representative volume in the usual analysis (see Figure 4.5).

This criterion can also be applied in the finite element modeling. As the actual crack path is not smooth but highly tortuous that it passes around the hard aggregate pieces and randomly sways to the side o f the straight path by distances roughly equal to the aggregate size and the actual stress (microstress) variation over such distances, we must try to control the width of the crack band to get the stresses and strains result for the homogeneous contiuum (macrostresses and macrostrains). Other effects such as the instability of strain-softening continuum and local strains also result in that the width of crack band or the minimum size of the finite element must be equal to several times the maximum aggregate size for the concrete in finite element analysis. Generally it is possible to assume ~ 3d ^.

4.2.1.4 Fracture Energy
The fracture energy, G/ is the energy consumed in the formation and opening of all microcracks per unite area of plane (x, y). The progressive microcracking in the fracture process zone may be described by a triaxial stress-strain relation that exhibits strain softening with gradual reduction of the maximum principle stress cr^ to 0. The uniaxial special form o f this stress-strain relation may be simply considered as a bilinear stress-strain diagram shown in Figure 4.6.

4.2.2.5 Element Size Effect and Element Orientation Effect One of the fundamental problems in the prediction of fracture is structural size effect. As fracture theories are based on the tests which are normally conducted on relatively small specimens in the laboratory, while in practice the structures are often far larger than those specimens, so structural size effect must be considered to extrapolate the information of real structure.

In terms o f the size effect, basically two types of theories may be distinguished: (1) Strength theory (or the concept of failure surfaces), in which the failure criterions is expressed in terms o f stresses (or strains), calculated according to theories of elasticity, plasticity or viscoplasticity. (2) Linear or nonlinear fi-acture mechanics, in which failure criterion is expressed in terms of energy consumed per unit crack length increment.

The elastic finite element analysis is based on the strength criterion. But after the crack is formed, the stress is infinite at the tip of the crack and that causes incorrect prediction of crack extension at an infinitely small load even if refining the mesh has be done. For the

geometrically similar specimen or structural of various sizes, the strength criteria will result in same nominal failure stress indicated by a horizontal line in Figure 4.7 which doesn't agree with test results that nominal failure stress decreases with an increase in size.

In fracture mechanics, the basic criterion is that the released energy is needed to create the crack surface. According to the classical linear fracture mechanics, the nominal failure stress is proportion to (size)'*'^, shown by the inclined line in Figure 4.7. However, with the exception o f very large structures, this slope appears to be too steep in comparison with most existing data.

Bazant and Oh (1983) proposed the crack band theory to remedy this deficiency in original smeared crack model for the size effect. He assumed the fracture process zone or crack band at the front o f crack in the concrete has certain characteristic width, W c. Usually it is about several times the maximum aggregate size for the concrete.

In the original smeared crack model, it may also meet element orientation problems such as; (1) In the case o f zig-zag crack band propagation through the mesh, one needs to introduce

some mathematics artifices to prevent spurious locking of the rugged opposite sides of the crack band (2) The mesh, typically a square mesh, inevitably introduces a certain degree of direction bias for the crack propagation, favoring propagation along the mesh lines or along the diagonals of the mesh, and suppressing propagation directions of small inclination with regard to the mesh line.

The element orientation effect problems can be solved by nonlocal continuum approach which is called localization limiter in ATENA. The nonlocal continuum is a continuum for which at least some variables are defined by spatial averaging. For the fracture analysis of concrete, nonlocal treatment should be applied only to those variables which cause strain softening, while the other variables, especially the elastic strain should be local. It means that the damage (U, which represents what is known in continuum damage mechanics as damage and may be regarded as the cracked area fi-action, should be modeled nonlocal fi'om the equation. This is accomplished by specifying it as a function of the average (nonlocal) strain, which is defined by spatial averaging. It can succeed in overcoming element orientation effect and also element size effect in the finite element analysis.

For ATENA, Figure 4.8 shows the definition of localization bands. The direction of failure plane is assumed to be normal to the principle stresses in tension and compression, respectively. The failure bands (for tension L, and for compression La) are defined as projections o f the finite element dimensions on the failure planes.

The element orientation effect is reduced, by further increasing of the failure band for skew meshes, by the following formulas [Cervenka et al., 1995]. 4 = / 4 (4.3) (4.4) y = l+(y -_ l).A ^ e (0 ;4 5 ) (4.5)

An angle 6 is the angle between the direction of the normal to the failure plane and the element side. In case o f general quadrilateral element, it is an average angle.

4.3.1 Stress-Strain Relations for Concrete 4.3.1.1 Equivalent Uniaxial Law The nonlinear behavior of concrete in biaxial stress state is described by means of so called effective stress, e r f , and the equivalent uniaxial strain, [Chen and Salrrb, 1982]. In this

section the stress-strain relationships of concrete in the uniaxial condition is discussed.

The purpose of the introduction of effective stress and equivalent uniaxial strain is to eliminate the Poisson's effect in the plane stress state. The effective stress in most cases is a principal stress. It can be expressed as:

^

(4.7)

where cr^, is the stress in a unaxial test and

is the modulus associated with the

direction i. Within this assumption, the nonlinearity representing damage is caused only by the governing stress, cr^,.

The complete equivalent uniaxial stress-strain diagram for concrete is shown in Figure 4.10. Unloading is a linear function to the origin. Thus, the relation between stress erf and strain
e" ^

is not unique and depends on the load history. A change from loading to unloading

occurs, when the increment o f the effective strain changes the sign. If subsequent reloading occurs the linear unloading path is followed until the last loading point, U, is reached again, then, the loading function is resumed.

The softening law in compression is linearly descending. Two models of strain softening in compression are available in ATENA: one based on dissipated energy, and other based on the local strain softening. In this research the later model is used. The stress-strain relation is shown in Figure 4.11, it assumes that compression failure is localized in a plane normal to the direction of compressive principal stress. All post-peak compressive displacements and energy dissipation are localized in this plane and are independent on the size of the structure. This hypothesis is supported by experiments conducted by Van Mier (1986). Two points define the slop of the softening part o f the stress-strain: a peak of the diagram at the maximal stress and a limit compressive strain, plastic displacement, Wj , and band size, , at the zero stress. This strain is calculated from a , according to the following expression:

4.3.1.4 Biaxial Stress Failure Criterion of Concrete The biaxial stress failure criterion used in ATENA is according to Kupfer et al. (1969) as shown in Figure 4.12. In the biaxial stress state, the strength of concrete is predicted under the assumption o f a proportion stress path.

For the compressive failure, in the biaxial compressive stress state the failure function is:

(4.18)

where <T^,,cr^2 are the principal stress in concrete and / j is the uniaxial cylinder strength. In the tension-compression state, the failure function continues linearly from the point cr^i = 0, cr^2 = fc the tension-compression region with the linear decreasing strength:

tensile strength. It is assumed that the cracks are uniformly distributed within the material volume. This is reflected in the constitutive model by an introduction o f orthotropy.

In the fixed crack model the crack direction is given by the principal stress direction at the time of the crack initiation and will not change with the further loading. Figure 4.14 shows stress and strain state in fixed crack model. After cracking the weak material axis, mi, is normal to the crack direction and strong axis, m 2, is parallel with the crack are fixed and will not rotate with principal strain axes and . In the rotated crack model both principal

strain and crack coordinate systems rotate with the increase of load as shown in Figure 4.15.

For fixed crack model, as two axes are not coincide, it results in a shear stress on the crack face demonstrated in Figure 4.14. The stress cr^i and cr^j are not principal stresses due to shear stress r . The shear modulus is reduced with growing strain normal to the crack as shown in Figure 4.16.

The secant and tangent shear modulus of cracked concrete are equal.

For the rotated crack model, in order to ensure the co-axialilty of the principal strain axes with the material axes the tangent shear modulus G, is calculated according to Crisfield and Wills (1989) as:

4.3.3 Reinforcement Properties Two forms can model the reinforcement: discrete and smeared model. The discrete reinforcement is in form of reinforcing bars and is modeled by truss element. The smeared reinforcement is a component of composite material and can be considered either as a single (only one-constituent) material in the element under consideration or as one of the more such constituent.

The smeared reinforcement model is used to evaluate the stress in the cracks. Therefore it also includes a part o f stress due to tension stiffening. The tension stiffening effect can be described as a contribution o f cracked concrete to tensile stifBiess of reinforcing bars. This stiffness is provided by the uncracked concrete or not fully opened crack and is generated by the strain localization process. It was verified by simulation experiments and published in paper [Margoldova et al., 1998]. It can be expressed as:

=0-^+0".

(4.28)

Where cr\ is the steel stress between the cracks (the steel stress in smeared reinforcement), is the steel stress in crack. For the discrete reinforcement model the o-,, = 0 thus the steel stress is always equal to = <rj

The reinforcement in both forms, smeared and discrete, is in the uniaxial stress state in material model SBETA. The stress-stain relationship of reinforcement follows the multi-linear laws, which consists of four regions, the linear region (elastic), yield plateau, strain hardening and fracture. The multi-line can be defined by four points 1,2, 3 ,4 as shown in Figure 4.17. For simplicity the fracture is not considered in this research. Thus a trilinear curve was used for modeling stress-strain relationship of the reinforcement, which means that point 4 will equal to point 3.

4.4 Fracture Analysis by Finite Element Method The formulation of constitutive relations considered in this research is in the plane stress state. A smeared approach is used to model the material properties, such as cracks or distributed reinforcement. This means that material properties defined for a material point are valid within a certain material volume, which in this case is associated with the entire finite element. The constitutive model is based on the stiffness and is described by the equation of equilibrium in a material point that:

The stress vector s can be decomposed into the material components due to concrete and reinforcement as:

The concrete stress Sc is acting on the material area of concrete, which is approximately set equal to the cross section o f the composite material m A (the area o f concrete occupied

For the cracked concrete the matrix has the form of the elastic matrix for the orthotropic material. The matrix is formulated in a coordinate system mi, m2, Figure 4.14 and Figure 4.15, which is coincident with the crack direction. The local coordinate system is referred to the superscript L later. The direction 1 is normal to the crack and the direction 2 is parallel with the crack. The definition o f the elastic constants for the orthotropic material in the plane stress state follows from the flexibility relation:

The microscopic analysis is for the stress state in the neighborhood of the reinforcement [Gajer and Dux, 1990; Ingraffea et al., 1984]. The macroscopic analysis is for the global behavior of a member or a structural assemblage [Ngo and Scordels, 1967; Nilson, 1968; Keuser and Mehlhom, 1987].

In micro-level, the stress transfer mechanism by bond is treated as the local contact in front of the bar ribs. The interface slip is due to crushing of concrete within limited zone in front of ribs, and can be derived from material properties and the configuration of the bars. Through the study of local concrete stress nearby the reinforcement, the initiation and propagation of internal cracks can be analyzed, both longitudinal splitting and cone-shape cracks, and thus the local bond stress versus the local slip relationship can be derived.

In a macro-level a relative slip displacement between reinforcement and concrete is directly modeled by one or two dimensional bond element using constitutive law derived from experimental data or the results o f microscopic analysis. The stress state of the concrete nearby the reinforcement is simplified and not as realistic as that analyzed by the microscopic analysis. In current research the analysis is carried out in this level.

This "bond" strength is specified by so called cohesion stress in ATENA. The bond-slip element is denoted as CCBarWithBond. Typical reinforcement bar of this type is depicted in the Figure 4.21. Figure 4.21 shows undeformed and deformed shape of a segment of the bar. The original length, U. will change to / due to displacement, u, of the surrounding body and bar slips, 8 .

Its derivative is compared with the cohesion stress. If the cohesion stress between the bar and the surrounding concrete is becoming too high, the bar will slip to reduce this stress.

The Eq. 4.51 together with Eq. 4.54 complete the element description. The element can be used to model realistically the cohesion between the reinforcing bars and concrete. Such a model is needed for analysis of pullout tests etc. Although the adopted solution is fairly simple, it provides reasonable results accuracy at low computation cost. A more elaborate model of cohesion between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding concrete can be achieved by using a special interface element that is described in the next chapter.

Chapter 5 Result of Finite Element Analysis
This chapter presents a practical corrosion analysis. The residual capacity of the corroded reinforcement was determined through the evaluation o f the increase o f steel volume and crack propagation. The final determination of the service life of concrete structures was made based on the above evaluation results. Finally, the volume expansion o f corroded reinforcement bars is analyzed, and one example is presented to improve the understanding of such analysis.

A finite element analysis, using ATNEA software, was carried out to help clarify the influence o f corrosion and bond behavior. The three different specimens used are corrosion expansion, pull-out, and beam specimen. Details of the three different specimens and their analytical results which investigated aspects of the bond behavior between the concrete and reinforcing steel are also presented. The specimens were considered fi-om first cracking until failure.

5.1 Material Properties
The detailed material modeling for concrete and reinforcement steel is described in Chapter 4. In the three different specimens, the cube strength of concrete, /,, , (nominal strength) is 30MPa. The corresponding parameters of concrete material are summarized in Table. 5.1. While The relative parameters o f the uniaxial stress state o f the reinforcing steel bars that was used in the three specimens are listed in Table 5.2.

5.2 Corrosion Analysis
5.2.1 M ethods and Procedures When a certain level o f corrosion of reinforcement bars in the concrete elements is reached, structures are out o f service which means the service life of structures is ended. Some repairs may be needed or even new structures must be built. In order to evaluate the intensity of

the corrosion and its environment factors which effect the service-life of the structural members, two process must be studied. They are:

(1 ) The process of rust production and build up of corrosion product around the bar (2) The propagation of cracks through the cover.

The corrosion damage analysis is consisted of several steps. The first one can be analyzed by the volume expansion o f rust production with the time. The second can be calculated by width or/and length of crack in the concrete element at a determined time. After studying the intensity o f the corrosion and crack, the residual development capacity o f reinforcement anchorages can be evaluated by the stress analysis of bond slip in the concrete members. Finally, a decision that the structures are to be repaired or demolished will be made.

Cracking can often be found in the existing concrete structures. The causes of cracking are variable and have been studied extensively. One critical cracking in the concrete structures is due to the corrosion o f reinforcement in concrete. When the reinforcement is corroded, corrosion products increase the volume of the reinforcement and hence generate tensile stress around it. Because concrete can endure less tensile stress than compressive stress, tensile cracks will appear. With the propagation of crack in concrete, the reinforcement bars are exposed to the environment as a result they are more venerable to the attack. It may accelerate the corrosion and consequently more new cracks appear. Figure 5.1 shows corrosion-cracking cycle. The detailed crack analysis is discussed in Chapter 4. Here only first process is studied.

5.2.2 Volume Increase of the Corrosion Products Depending on the level of oxidation, iron may expand by as much as six times its original volume, shown in Figure 2.5 [Liu and Weyers, 1998], The actual volume increase depends on the fraction by which the various oxide forms in the corrosion products. Composition of rust cannot be credibly postulated because it depends largely on circumstantial factors such as the chloride concentration, oxygen supply and moisture. In modeling the mechanical effects of corrosion, the general practice is to represent the density of the rust product p,. as a fixed fraction of that o f the iron consumed for the reaction; i.e., p ^ = p j , where p , is the

4 [Andrade et al., 1993; Liu and Weyers, 1998].

5.2.3 Mathematical Simulation of Corrosion In this simulation, a constant rate of rust production is assumed. The mass o f iron Ms consumed over time is related to the amount o f current Icorr (A) that flows through the electrochemical corrosion cell (comprising anodic and cathodic bar areas and the pore solution through which ions are conducted). The process is prescribed by Faraday's law as below:

d M s/d t = I^,, A I(nF )

(5.1)

where A is the atomic weight of the ion being dissolved (for Fe, A=55.85 g/mol), and F is Faraday's constant f =96500 C/mol. Because little is known on the chemical composition of the product, the valency o f the reaction n is empirically usually taken equal to 2, [A value of n =2 assumes that all the corrosion product is Fe(0H)2] it follows that

= 2.893 X10"^

Integration of d M sld t over time produces the total mass of

iron consumed since initiation o f corrosion, we have

The total mass o f rust produced at the anode is Mr = Ms I y

with y^ (the ratio of steel

mass and rust mass) ranging between 0.523 and 0.622 [Liu and Weyers, 1998; Bazant, 1979]. For constant Forr, Faraday's law implies a linear increase of the mass of rust with time.

To calculate the volume o f rust produced at the anode, Andrade et al. (1993) established an empirical relationship between current density icon- and the volume of steel consumed at the anode {icon is defined as the mean annual corrosion current per unit anodic surface area of steel ( u Acm^)].

Martin-Perez (1998) used early results by Bazant (1979) to describe the rate o f production of hydrated red rust [Fe(0H)3] per unit of anodic surface area in the bar, Jr=dMr/dt [Jr (kg/m^-s)=5.536xlO''icorr, where icorr is in amperes per square meters [Bazant, 1979]. The mass o f hydrated red rust formed per unit length o f rebar AMr is equal to
7d)i,J^At = 5.536x\0~''TvD^^At-i^^

(kg/m), where At = t - t ^ is the duration o f ongoing

corrosion since initiation (unit is second, s). The mass of steel consumed for reaction per unit length o f rebar AMs required to produce AMr is AMs=0.523AMr. The volume of steel consumed is obtained from the ratio of mass per density. Thus, conforming again with Faraday's law and Eq.(5.5).

Assuming uniform corrosion on the bar surface, the bar diameter is reduced, because of iron depletion, to Rrt- If the volume reduction o f steel per unit length of bar AFs is known [estimated from current density by Eqs (5.4) to (5.6)] then

5.3 Two-Dimensional Corrosion-Cracking Analysis Example (Specimen I)
Chapter 2 investigated the increase in the volume of reinforcement due to the corrosion. As mentioned earlier, such increase in volume results in radial pressure around the surface of concrete and the reinforcing steel. When the corrosion reaches a high level, spalling and cracking will occur in the concrete nearby the reinforcement. In this section, a finite element method will be used to study this crack propagation due to corrosion products expansion. The calculation o f corrosion attack penetration and the increase of diameter o f the steel bar due to the corrosion is demonstrated in section 5.2,

In the test, a specimen with a concentrically embedded reinforcing bar was 100x100x200 mm, as shown in Figure 5,3. Here, a slice (section A-A) of it was analyzed, corresponding with a plane strain assumption. A smeared crack model was used in this test. The bar is processing corrosion which creates uniform corrosion products around its surface. The corrosion rate is constant during the whole procedure. The load of corrosion is applied by the radial displacement around the surface of concrete and bar. There are 10 steps of analysis in which each o f them represents a one-year o f corrosion. The applied load history is obtained from section 5.2 and summarized in Table 5.4.

The finite element mesh type is quadrilateral, and the element size is 0.01m. Due to the limitation of element numbers in the software, the reinforcement is approximated by a hexagon. But the cracking progress will not have significant difference with that of circular. The boundary condition is to hinge the cross section at the four comers.

Figure 5.5 to Figure 5.10 illustrate the failure progress in the 10 years. The propagation of crack and the stress distribution are also shown in these diagrams. The accumulated maximum crack width at the end of each year is listed in Table. 5.4. It can be seen that the maximum crack width is nearly 1mm after ten years of corrosion in this case. The relationship between corrosion penetration and maximum crack width is shown in Figure 5.11.

Corrosion Penetration (mm)

Figure 5.11 Corrosion Penetration Verse Max. Crack Width Response

From the calculation results, we can find that the cracking propagates away from the vicinity o f the bar. The first visible crack appears in the elements around the bar at a corrosion level equivalent to radial expansion of 0.03 mm. Basically the location probability of the first crack can be either vertical or horizontal. In this case it is in horizontal direction. It must be noted that some microcracks have existed before any visible crack appeared as shown in the result of analysis Stepl. After the first crack is formed, this crack continues to expand wider and wider and eventually extends to the surface o f the specimen. During this procedure some

new cracks will continue to appear around the reinforcing bar. The crack extending to the surface, which can be observed by the naked eye, indicates that the intensity of corrosion is high in the reinforced concrete members. At this time the reinforcing bar become more venerable because the harmful material can easily go through the crack, at a much faster rate and as a result the corrosion rate will be accelerated. However, the corrosion products, which cause the radial expansion in the concrete, may decrease because such product can flow out through the crack. As we can observe in the reinforced concrete structures, the rust products frequently appear along the crack after corrosion initiates. That means the width of crack may not be expanded further. This leads to more difficulty in predicting the true cracking progress in the structure. In this research such factors are not considered and further research may be needed.

In order to consider the bond slip effect between the concrete and reinforcing bar, an additional material called `bond for reinforcement' is specified in the finite element analysis. This material considers the bond effect by treating the concrete around the steel bar as a composite material as discussed in Chapter 4. The type of steel bar is ribbed reinforcement and bond quality is defined as in the poor condition. The bond stress to slip model is according to CEB-FIP Model Code 1990 as shown in Figure 3.12. The curve of bond-stress slip relationship used in this study is determined by 7 points and the related parameters are listed in Table 5.5. The bond slip-stress response is shown in Figure 5.13.

Bond Slip (mm)

Figure 5.13 Bond Slip-Stress Relationship Used in This Study

The load is applied at the two ends of reinforcing bar. The slip will occur when the stress exceeds a certain level. The increment o f load at each load step is 1 kN. The total analysis steps are 10. The specimen is restrained at the middle of its length to prevent the horizontal and vertical movement, but the cross-section can still be free to contract. The calculation results are shown in Figures 5.14 to 5.19. Table 5.5 shows the development o f bond stress at the two ends o f the specimen. The variation of steel stress along the bar for the tension simulation is shown in Figure 5.20 under P = 1 kN.

From the analysis results, the bond stress was found to be increasing rapidly at the end of the specimen after the tension load was applied. The first group of cracks is also formed in this area after the tension stress exceeded the limitation. Because the concrete is not a homogenous material, the cracks may develop more quickly at one end. Then the bond stress at one end continually increases, while the stress at the other end may either decrease or increase as shown in Table 5.6. The value of bond stress in the crack is equal to zero and reaches the peak in the vicinity o f the crack. It agrees with the experimental results as shown

in Figure in Chapter 3. With the increase of tension forces, more cracks appear around this area and some stress redistribution occurs. Finally, the bond stress develops in the whole reinforcement as a result o f the change of stress along all the length o f the bar. The tension stress is also developed in the concrete by the bond effect. Eventually the cracks are evenly distributed within the specimen. The bond stress is redistributed with the development of cracks. As can be observed in the diagrams, the bond stress redistribution is a very complex progress and unpredictable and the crack propagation in the inhomogeneous concrete material can make it more difficult.

Both the concrete and reinforcement material properties are the same as those used in the previous analysis. The bond slip is modeled by `bond for reinforcement' material as discussed in Example 1. The type o f steel bar is ribbed reinforcement and bond quality is specified as in good condition.

Two vertical concentrated loads are applied at the top of beam. The increment o f load at each step is 0.5kN. The total analysis steps are 10. The supports are two steel plates with 50 mm width and 30 mm thickness. The boundary condition is: the left support is a pin support and the right support is roller. The calculation results are shown in Figures 5.23 to 5.33.

The displacements at the middle of the span and the resisting forces in the left support are obtained by setting two monitor points in the calculation. The one in the support A can give resisting force after each load step. The forces are balanced by the applied loads which means the calculation results are correct. Another monitor point is at the bottom of mid-span

The stress distribution along the height of the cross section is studied, and three cross sections are defined in the analysis. The first one is at the middle o f span, the second one is at the point where the external load is applied and the third one is in the support. The calculation results are shown in Figure 5.22 to Figure 5.31. It can be seen that the compression block is reduced with the increase o f load and the development of crack.

The propagation o f crack is also demonstrated in this example. Initially the flexural cracks appear at the middle of the span in the beam. Then cracks appear near the support due to the large shear stress in this area with an angle equal to 45 degrees. Finally this kind of cracks extends to the top o f beam. The beam is finally in the flexural shear failure which is in agreement with the experimental results.

Before cracking occurs, the bond stress exists on the interface between the bars and concrete as a result o f the change of stress in the reinforcement. Due to the loading, no bond stresses exist between the concrete and the reinforcing bar in the middle third of the beam. In the outer thirds o f the beam, where constant shear force and a corresponding change in moment exist, the steel and the concrete elongate the same amount over any given length. However, due to the difference in the elastic modulus of the two materials, a larger stress change in the steel than in the concrete over a unit length, leading to a bond stress.

After a crack forms in the constant moment region of the beam, the stress condition in the vicinity of the crack is very complex. The tensile stress at the section o f crack in the concrete disappeared. This unloading o f tensile concrete allows the crack to open at the surface of the beam. This makes certain amount of stress redistributed in the steel. With the increase o f load and the propagation o f the crack, this kind of redistribution continues until the beam is damaged. These phenomena can be observed in this example.

Chapter 6 Conclusion and Future Direction
6.1 Conclusion The mechanical behavior of corrosion was studied in this research. The electrochemical process of corrosion is discussed in details. It is believed that the rust behaves like a granular material, which led to the change of the mechanical behavior of bond between the concrete and the reinforcing bars, together with the volume increase of the corrosive products compared with the virgin steel. The corrosion attack penetration has been given as a function of the time as input in the analyses. The load of corrosion applied inside the structural members can be modeled by the displacement around the circumferential surface between the reinforcing bars and concrete. The reduction of capability of the structures is determined from the corrosion level in the service years. Thereby, it would be possible to analyze a structure to investigate its lifetime, and to see what effect of environments would have on for example the deformations and the load-bearing capacity of a structure.

The bond between steel reinforcement and concrete is the critical feature of reinforced concrete structure. It enables the use of concrete, which has low-tension stresses, as a structural material. Consequently, the attention was centralized to develop certain bond slip models in the structural analysis of reinforced concrete structures. This study has been taken to understand the mechanisms of bond-slip and predict analytically the bond-slip behavior from these mechanisms. A finite element modeling method based on nonlinear fracture was presented. The "tension-softening" concept was introduced for the purpose of modeling of bond-slip. In this approach, bond-slip and cracking in concrete are treated in a coherent maimer, using basic material properties as input to the analysis.

It is clear that in finite element modeling of the reinforced concrete structures, the internal stresses in the concrete, the formation and stability of concrete cracks, and the distribution

. 148

of the stress in the steel reinforcement are profoundly influenced by the proper modeling of concrete and steel material, especially for the concrete. In developing useful finite element models, it is essential to provide not only the constitutive relationships to describe the behavior of concrete and steel material, hut also to develop and incorporate analogous relationships for the interface between the two. The nonlinear finite element fracture analysis shows that nonlinear fracture mechanics can be effectively applied to investigate concrete fracture. In this research, three finite element analyses in terms of corrosion, tension and simply supported beam are carried out. It was concluded that

with the increase of load and the propagation of the crack, stress redistributed in the steel continues until the specimen is damaged. Comparisons between the analyses of crack propagation and stress redistribution obtained using the finite element analysis was in good agreement with tests fond in the literature.

6.2 Current N eeds and Future Directions A large number of uncertainties are associated with the modeling of corrosion darnage in concrete. These include: a) difficulties related to the determination of the onset and the rate of corrosion; b) the randomness of the geometry of the corrosion buildup on the surface of the reinforcing bars; c) the dependence of corrosion damage on other stresses and load histories. In view of these uncertainties, the future research work may present approximate techniques that could be used to estimate the progression of corrosion-induced damage in the concrete.

The effect of the corrosion is modeled as a volume increase of the corrosive products compared with the original diameter of steel bar in this research. In fact, corrosion of reinforcing bars also decreases the friction between the reinforcement and the concrete. However, in the tests of bond mechanism of corroded reinforcement in past research, only the bond stress and the slip have been measured. The normal stress in the bond mechanism, or the effect of the normal stress, has not been measured. Therefore, it is very difficult to evaluate the friction between the reinforcement and the concrete affected by

corrosion o f the bars. Further research is needed to study this problem.

A s the information is still not enough on the mechanical behavior o f the corrosive products, it results in the difficulties in the analytical m odeling o f this phenomenon. A s presented by Petre-Lazar and Gerard (2000), there m ight be a possibility for the rust to fill up the pores close to the reinforcing bars before starting to apply stresses in the structures. It means that properties o f the concrete, such as porosity, w ill influence the m echanical behavior o f the corrosive products. A lso the properties o f the concrete might influence what type o f corrosive products that w ill form, and thereby the m echanical behavior o f it. Further efforts may be made on using a combination o f test results and analysis method to investigate such bond behavior.

In this research, w e use finite elem ent method to analyze the cracking and bond slip problem. There are several deficiencies and unknowns in the current m odel applied in engineering practice, the future research m ay also include improvement o f this part o f work. Although linear elastic m odels w ill still be w idely used in the determination o f behavior under normal loads and m ay continue to represent the vast majority o f applications, it believes that more and more com m onplace for practicing engineers rely on nonlinear methods for assessing structural behavior. Moreover, computer-based m ethods w ill principally play an important role in the new analysis. A key ingredient o f new generation o f structural analysis software w ill be the accurate m odeling o f all aspects o f structural response, including bond and slippage under load and corrosion. It is the objective for the code writing organizations to provide a unified consensus approach for bond m odeling in these applications to ensure accuracy and safety in the analysis.
