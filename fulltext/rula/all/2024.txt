MODELING OF ETHYLENE POLYMERIZATION WITH ZIEGLER-NATTA CATALYST IN A BUBBLING FLUIDÏZED BED REACTOR

Neda Felorzabihi, 2004 Master of Applied Science Chemical Engineering Department Ryerson University
A bstract

In the present study, a new dynam ic fluidized bed reactor (FBR) model is developed to account for the effect o f bubble growth in the bed height on the dynam ic behaviour o f the reactor and the m olecular properties o f the polymer product. The model takes into account the existence o f solid catalyst in both phases and consequently, the occurrence o f polym erization reaction in both bubble and em ulsion phases. A dynamic two-phase model is employed for predicting the key hydrodynam ic parameters o f the bed. A com prehensive kinetic model for ethylene polym erization in the presence o f m ultiple-site Ziegler-Natta catalyst is considered to describe the num ber and m olecular weight averages and m olecular weight distribution of polym er in the FBR. The hydrodynamic model and the kinetic model have been coupled and solved simultaneously to simulate the performance o f the fluidized bed reactor. The study incorporates the effects o f the most im portant reactor param eters such as superficial gas velocity, mean particle size, inlet gas temperature, bubble size, recycle stream and chain transfer agent on the steady-state behaviour o f the FBR. The proposed dynamic model is capable o f predicting both the performance o f the reactor and the polymer physicochemical properties.

Polyethylene (PE) is one o f the largest synthetic com modity and engineering polym ers and is widely used throughout the world for its versatile physical and chem ical properties. Characteristics o f polyethylene include excellent toughness, good tear and burst strength, excellent chemical resistance, translucency, low heat resistance and low price because o f sim ple production processes. The w ide range o f PE properties gives rise to a wide range o f applications including coatings, packaging, fibres, films, plastic-w are and autom otive parts. Polyethylene was originally produced by high-pressure, high-tem perature free radical polym erization on com mercial scale for the production o f flexible polym er referred to as lowdensity polyethylene (LDPE). The invention o f Ziegler-Natta catalysts in early fifty's led to the production o f other polyethylene types such as: High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). High-density polyethylene is a highly crystalline polym er with no long or short chain branching. Because o f its crystalline structure, it produces more rigid polym er products in comparison with other t)'pes o f polyethylene (Figure 1.1). LLDPE is a copolym er o f ethylene and a-olefins. For the incorporation o f these two m onom ers, the LLDPE polymer product has short chain branching and consequently, is less A M r, dense and less crystalline than HDPE. M odern polyethylene plants are continuous processes using Ziegler-N atta catalyst in bulk, solution, slurry or gas phase. In particular, the gas phase polym erization process is one o f the m o st modern and versatile techniques. Due to its technological and econom ical advantages, j !' f ii th e gas phase polym erization has been challenging other processes particularly for m arket share. It offers several distinguished characteristics m aking it a unique process (Xie et ah, 1994): It is a dry process since it does not involve any liquid in the reaction zone. Thus, it is free o f mass and heat transfer lim itations inherent to viscous slurry and bulk systems. The catalyst/polym er system in the gas phase fluidized bed reactor has a good heat transfer.

This process can also produce polym ers w ith a w ide range o f densities and m olecular w eight distributions (M W Ds). Production o f high com onom er content polym ers, such as high im pact ethylenepropylene copolymers is another m ajor advantage o f the gas phase process. There are no solvent removal costs.

This investigation requires the study o f the hydrodynam ic behaviour, heat/m ass transfer, reaction rates and flow patterns in a conventional fluidized bed reactor (FBR) for predicting its characteristics and behaviour. In a gas-solid fluidized bed reactor, the flow and contacting patterns are im portant factors to study and model. Early m odels o f gas-solid fluidized bed reactors w ere generated on sim ple contacting models and flow patterns such as plug, mixed, and dispersion flows. After the developm ent o f a tw o-region model by Toom ey and Johnstone (1952), several models have been derived to describe their perform ance.

Hydrodynam ic m odels interpret the behaviour o f fluidized beds in physical term s such as bubble perform ance and gas jets behaviour. They include three-phase m odels (K unii and Levenspiel, 1968) and tw o-phase m odels (D avidson and H arrison, 1963; K ato and W en, 1969; Fryer and Potter, 1976). Some o f the tw o-region m odels consider the cloud as a part o f the bubble or the em ulsion; others assume bubble, cloud, and em ulsion as three different phases w ith the w ake being a part o f the cloud or the bubble. McAuleyf et al. (1990) developed a m odel for gas phase ethylene copolym erization in a fluidized bed reactor using Ziegler-N atta catalyst w ith m ultiple active sites. A pplying Stockm ayer's bivariate distribution function to each active site, they calculated average m olecular weights and copolym er distributions for ethylene copolym ers. Choi and Ray (1985) proposed a FB R m odel, based on the concept o f tw o-phase fluidization. The model incorporates tem perature and concentration variations w ithin the gas bubble phase throughout the bed and interaction o f separate em ulsion and bubble phases. M cA uley et al. (1994) revised the model o f Choi and Ray (1985), constant m ean bubble size m odel, establishing a m axim um stable bubble size. In the m odel o f M cA uley et al. (1994) it is assum ed that there is unrestricted heat and m ass transfer rate betw een the bubble and em ulsion phase. H ow ever, this assum ption is valid when small bubbles are presented in the bed also w hen the rate o f heat and mass transfer betw een phases is relatively high. In both studies the em ulsion phase w as considered to behave as a fully m ixed reactor. H atzantonis et al. (2000) extended previous w ork on gas phase olefin polym erization reactors to account for the effects o f varying bubble size. In their study, a com prehensive kinetic model w as proposed for ethylene copolym erization in the presence o f m ulti-site Z iegler-N atta catalysts. The study com pared the proposed bubble grow th m odel w ith the previous w ell-m ixed and constant bubble size models. The constant bubble size m odel overpredicted the em ulsion phase tem perature and m onom er conversion; the w ell-m ixed m odel underestim ated them , w hereas the proposed model showed an interm ediate behaviour. Fernandes et al. (2000) studied the influence o f prepo 1 ym erization on the behaviour o f fluidized bed reactors, related mainly to the tem perature and concentration gradients throughout the bed. They dem onstrated that the use o f prepolym erized catalyst particles could reduce th e reaction activity in the catalyst-feeding region, leading to low er tem perature gradient in the bed.

Fernandes et al. (2001a) proposed a new steady-state model incorporating interactions betw een separate bubbles, em ulsion gas phase and em ulsion solid particles. The m ain difference o f this m odel w ith previous ones is that the em ulsion phase is considered to be in a counter-current plug flow regim e. It differs from conventional w ell-m ixed fluidized bed m odels by assum ing particle segregation w ithin the bed. M oreover, Fernandes et al. (2001b) developed a heterogeneous dynam ic m odel describing the behaviour o f fluidized bed reactors in polym er production. The m odel focuses m ainly on the influence o f polym er yield and variations in operational condition on reactor behaviour and polym er properties. M ore recently, Fernandes et al. (2002) studied the effect o f mass diffusion into polym er particles in a fluidized bed reactor. Polym er particle grow th was considered for low and high reactor residence tim es. The study show ed that the influence o f intraparticle m ass transfer is im portant for low residence tim e but also insignificant for high residence time. A lizadeh et al. (2004) developed a pseudo-hom ogeneous model for predicting the behaviour o f a LLD PE fluidized bed reactor. In particular, average concentrations o f particles were predicted based on a dynam ic tw o-phase structure. M ost o f the previous m odels assum ed w ell-m ixed flow regim es in the em ulsion phase. It should be em phasized that such assum ption is reasonable only for laboratory scale and pilotplant fluidized bed reactors w hich are violently fluidized w ith a height to diam eter ratio close to one (Lynch and W anke, 1991). H ow ever, for industrial large-scale fluidized bed reactors w ith a bed height to diam eter ratio m uch greater than one, this assum ption is not acceptable. Besides, based on the correlation o f W u and Baeyens (1998), the m ixing index in a fluidized bed reactor ranges from 0.4 to 0.5, which can be interpreted as a poor m ixing. Further, according to the study o f D avidson (1992) on pilot-plant and industrial reactors, it is much more plausible to consider a plug flow regim e in both em ulsion and bubble phases. In spite o f several efforts on m odeling fluidized bed reactors (FBRs) for sim ple first order catalytic reactions, only a lim ited num ber o f studies tried to model the catalytic gas-phase olefin polym erization in fluidized bed reactors. The gas phase polym erization process involves a com plex physicochem ical transition from gaseous m onom er to solid polymer. Therefore, a deep understanding o f transport phenom ena and chem ical reactions is required to m odel gas-phase fluidized bed reactors. The m ain objective o f the current dynam ic model is

to achieve a com prehensive understanding o f the effect o f operational param eters on perform ance o f industrial polyethylene reactors and polym er properties. The model gives insight as to w hich conditions w ould optim ize reactor perform ance in order to increase m onom er conversion. Specifically, the model can verify how changes in reactor key param eters, such as superficial gas velocity, mean particle size, bubble size and inlet tem perature, will influence th e dynam ic and steady state behaviour o f FBRs. The thesis is organized into six chapters. In Chapter 2 a b rief description is presented for the PE gas phase polym erization process and the Ziegler-N atta catalyst system . C hapter 3 describes the hydrodynam ics o f bubbling fluidized bed and im portant em pirical and semiem pirical correlations for predicting hydrodynam ics key param eters. The reaction m echanism and kinetic model for ethylene polym erization with Ziegler-N atta catalyst is introduced in detail in C hapter 4. D ynam ic m olar species and energy balances are derived to predict concentration o f the reactants (m onom er, catalyst, cocatalyst, chain transfer agent), the reaction tem perature and th e average m olecular properties o f polym er (num ber average, m olecular w eight average and m olecular w eight distribution) in the fluidized bed reactor. Furtherm ore, the num erical approach to solve the dynamic model is described in detail. The com plem entary results and discussion for the application o f the m odel and the effect o f important param eters on th e behaviour o f the FBR are discussed in C hapter 5.

2.1 P oiym erization F luidized B ed R eactor
Fluidized beds utilizing solid catalysts for olefin polym erization have been long recognized as im portant m anufacturing processes. The first fluidized reactor for gas phase olefin polym erization was constructed by U nion Carbide Company. The process com m only called U NIPO L h as becom e the dom inant option for producing H D PE and LLD PE. In such a process, sm all catalyst particles (e.g. 20-80 pm in diam eter) are continuously fed into the reactor (H atzantonis et al., 1998). The catalyst can be injected at about 5-30 % o f the bed height above the distributor plate and react w ith the incom ing fluidizing gas. Therefore, the polym erization is started in the bed by m eans o f the ascending gas stream com prising the gaseous reaction m onom er and the bed can be m aintained in a fluidized state. A n inert diluent gas such as argon and nitrogen or a gaseous chain transfer agent like hydrogen is preferably used to carry the catalyst in the bed. The fluidized bed reactor consists o f a reaction zone and a disengagem ent zone. The latter is norm ally larger in diam eter than the polym erization zone to reduce the gas flow and facilitate the settling o f solid particles. To m aintain a stable fluidized bed, superficial flow through th e bed is about 3-6 tim es the m inim um flow required for the fluidization (W agner et ah, 1981). The reactor usually operates at pressure betw een 20-35 atm and tem peratures betw een 86-110 °C for H D PE and 30-85 °C for LLDPE productions. In industrial fluidized bed reactors it is necessary to use a fluidization grid or distributor plate to allow the gas spreading out in the bed. The grid can also act as a support for the bed in case the gas supply is cut-off. The polym er product is continuously w ithdraw n from the reactor at a point ju st above the distributor plate. Polym erization o f olefins is an exotherm ic reaction; it is therefore necessary to rem ove the heat o f reaction. The heat o f reaction is rem oved by unreacted gases exiting th e bed that are subsequently com pressed, cooled up to above recycle gas dew point and recycled back into the reactor. The tem perature o f the recycled gas m ixture can be adjusted in a heat exchanger to m aintain the FB R tem perature at a desired value. During start-up, the reaction zone is usually charged w ith a base o f polym er particles before introducing m onom er gas into the reactor. This can prevent the form ation o f localized "hot «

2.2 C atalysts for G as P hase P olym erization

g) Good com onom er incorporation.

O ver the last decades, three m ajor catalyst fam ilies have been used com m ercially in ethylene polym erization. These catalysts include titanium /vanadium -based catalyst (ZieglerN atta catalyst), chrom ium oxide-based catalysts (Philips catalyst), and hom ogeneous catalysts (M etallocene catalyst). A typical industrial catalyst consists o f active m etal, m odifiers and inert support (Xie et al., 1994). The Ti-based catalyst is usually prepared in three steps:

a) Preparation o f a precursor containing Ti; b) Incorporation o f the precursor onto the support; c) A ctivation o f the catalyst.

These steps are usually accom plished by partial reaction o f a catalyst and a cocatalyst. The main solid catalyst prepared using m ethod 2 in Table 2.1, is then im pregnated onto a porous support, such as silica or m agnesium halide. The support is then im pregnated w ith the precursor by dissolving the precursor in the electron donor com pound. A fterw ards, the solvent should be rem oved by drying at a tem perature up to 80 °C (Jorgensen et al., 1982). W hen the size o f catalyst is relatively small (m ethod 3 in Table 2.1), the catalyst particles cannot be used directly in the bed. In this case, the precursor and cocatalyst are converted into prepolym er particles in a prepolym erization stage and then the prepolym er is fed to the bed.

Hence, the role o f prepolymerization is to form a support for gas phase ethylene polym erization, instead o f silica support.

Cr-based catalysts are the first generation o f catalysts that have been used for gas phase polym erization. The m ajor difference between Cr-based and Ti-based catalysts is that the Chrom ium oxide based catalyst produce polymers with broader m olecular w eight distribution (M W D ) than Ti-based catalysts (M ethod 1 in Table 2.1).

Ziegler-Natta catalysts are a rem arkable group o f catalysts. They are especially useful because they can make polymers that can't be made by any other ways such as linear unbranched polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene. Free radical vinyl polym erization can only produce branched polyethylene and polypropylene cannot be polym erized by free radical polymerization. There are different com binations o f Ziegler-Natta catalysts but titaniumaluminium systems, m ore specifically TiCla with Al(CzH 5 ) 2 Cl and TiCU w ith A l(C 2 Hs ) 3 are the most studied systems. The first generation o f Ziegler-Natta catalysts had very low activity. However, for the new generation o f Ziegler catalysts, increasing the effective surface area o f the active com ponent has remarkably increased the activity o f these catalysts. This is accomplished by using a magnesium chloride (solid) support. Also by addition o f electrondonor additives stereospecificity was kept high. Therefore, a typical recipe for a present day superactive catalyst system involves initial ball-m illing (mechanical grinding or m ixing) o f magnesium chloride (or the alkoxide) and TiCU followed by addition o f A l(C 2 Ha) 3 with an organic Lewis base solvent (Chien et al., 1982).

2.3 Reaction M echanism o f Ziegler-N atta Polym erization
Quite a few stimctures have been proposed for the active sites in Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems. However, due to the com plexity o f the com ponents that can be produced by this catalyst, the proposed structures in the literature are commonly diverse. The proposed active centres fall into either o f two general categories: monometallic m echanism and bimetallic mechanism (Odian 1991). For monom etallic centres the active site occurs at the transition metal carbon bond, whereas bim etallic mechanisms maintain that the active site occurs as a complex between the transition metal and the cocatalyst metal. Figure 2.2 illustrates these two types o f mechanism.

2.3.1 Propagation M echanism A typical propagation mechanism based on m onom etallic active sites is depicted in Figure 2.3. The reaction mechanism is called Cossee mechanism, which is currently the most widely accepted mechanism explaining olefin insertion into a transition metal-carbon bond. A t first, m onom er coordinates at the vacant orbital o f transition metal. Then a com plex is formed involving the Ti-electrons o f the alkene double bond and the empty orbitals o f transition metal. A fter olefin coordination at the vacant site, a four-membered transition state is formed with the titanium and methylene o f the Ti-C bond. Afterwards, the latter bond breaks and new Ti-C and C-C cr-bonds form between titanium, the last inserted m onom er and the previously attached alkyl group. The polym er chain moves into the coordination site formerly occupied by the com plexing monomer, and then a new vacant site for olefin coordination becomes available. Repetition o f this process results in the propagation o f the polym er chain (Figure 2.3). The conventional cocatalyst usually used with Ziegler-Natta catalyst is alum inium alkyls such as tricthylaluminium (AlEt?). The main role o f a cocatalyst is to activate a catalyst. In addition, A lEtj also acts as a scavenger o f impurities in the polym erization system (M cAuley et al., 1990). Other roles such as alkylating agent and reducing agent have been proposed by som e researchers. According to Chien et al. (1987), AlEts can also reduce M gC b support particle size and increase surface area if AlEt] is used as an internal m odifier during the

Polym erization o f olefins with single-site metallocene catalysts allow s the production o f polyolefins (e.g. polyethylene and polypropylene) with a highly ordered and superior structure. M oreover, the structure o f metallocene catalysts can be varied in order to control the m olecular structure o f polym er and eventually, the properties o f the polymer. At first, m etallocene was used to describe a complex with a metal sandwich between two eta- 5 -cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands. Later on, a large number o f metallocene catalysts have been invented in a wide variety o f organometallic structures such as those w ith substituted Cp rings, those with bent sandwich structures, and the half-sandwich or m ono-Cp complexes (Figure 2.4).

F ixed bed reactors have several drawbacks for highly exothermic reactions. They favor the production o f unw anted by-products and also produce localized hot or cold spots in the bed. However, in com parison w ith fixed beds, fluidized beds have several advantages. Once a solid is fluidized in the bed, it behaves like a liquid. This liquid-like behaviour enables a continuous feeding, handling and withdraw al o f solids. These benefits o f fluidized solids raised interests for flow m odeling and contacting patterns inside the FBR. Fluidized bed reactor m odels rely heavily on the use o f em pirical and semi-empirical correlations for predicting key model param eters, such as m inim um fluidization velocity, bubble size and interphase mass and heat transfer coefficients. The traditional two-phase theory considers the existence o f tw o phases only in a fluidized bed reactor, i.e. the solid free bubbles (e = 1) and em ulsion phase (dense phase) at m inim um fluidization (e = This

approach postulates that the bubbles are solid free; hence reactions occur in the em ulsion phase only. However, the actual flow structure in the fluidized beds is m uch more com plicated than that at the m inim um fluidization, and the bubbles may contain various am ounts o f particles as reported by Cui et al. (2000) and Li et al. (1996). A lso the m ean voidage in the bubble and em ulsion phases and, that o f the phase fractions vary with the superficial gas velocity. This phenom enon results in a dynamic gas-solid distribution o f the phases with the voidage, which has a considerable effect on m ass/heat transfer and apparent polym erization rate in fluidized bed reactors. The required hydrodynamic param eters and m ass/heat transfer correlations are presented in the next sections.

3.1 M inim um F luidization V elocity
In FBR calculations the first step is to determine the minimum fluidization velocity, i.e. the velocity at w hich the bed starts to fluidize. A t the minimum fluidization velocity, all the particles are essentially supported by the gas stream. The pressure drop through the bed is defined as the w eight divided by the cross-sectional area o f the bed AP = W / A . Below the m inim um fluidization velocity, an increase in gas velocity usually causes an increase in pressure drop (Figure 3.1). However, at m inim um fluidization velocity, further increase in the

B ubbles, having exceeded the m axim um , will break up and becom e sm aller in size to m aintain system stability. According to D avidson and H arrison (1963) bubbles m ay becom e unstable i f their rising velocities becom e larger than the term inal velocity o f particles in the bed.

Polyolefins made with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts have usually broad m olecular weight distribution (M W D) and chemical composition distribution (CCD). The presence o f

K

multiple types o f catalytic sites on the surface o f heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts is generally considered to be responsible for broadness o f M W Ds and CCDs. Each site type has its own kinetic constants and produces polymer with often different M W D, CCDs and stereoregularitics (de Carvalho et al., 1989; McAuley et al., 1990; Soares and Hamielec, 1995; Soares and Hamielec. 1996). The existence o f multiple site types on heterogeneous ZieglerN atta catalysts is supported by experimental data (Zucchini and Cecchin, 1983; Keii et al., 1984; U sam i et al., 1986). In this work, a dynamic model is developed for hom opolym erization o f ethylene using multiple-site heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts in a fluidized bed reactor.

4.1 R eaction M echanism
The polym erization kinetics includes steps o f site formation, initiation, propagation, transfer to monom er, transfer to cocatalyst, transfer to hydrogen, spontaneous transfer (P-hydride elimination) and deactivation. These elementary steps are employed to describe the majority o f experimental polym erization data o f olefins using Ziegler-Natta and metallocene catalysts ' (Soares and Hamielec, 1996). In the kinetic equations below, C* stands for a potential active site on the catalyst surface, R ' represents a live polym er chain which is chemically bonded to the active metal centre and f is a dead polym er chain. M onomer molecules are represented by M , cocatalyst by A and hydrogen by / / , · The indexes j and r represents the type o f active sites and the length (in m onom er units) o f the polym er chain. In this study a Ziegler-N atta catalyst with two active sites is employed in kinetic model development (/'=!, 2 ).

The purpose o f the m odel is to study the evolution o f the consumed components, the formation o f polymer species as well as the average weight distribution and molecular weight distribution o f the polymer.

Model Assumptions For the model development, few hypothesis were considered: 1. Polymerization reaction occurs both in the emulsion phase and the bubble phase. I I 2. Emulsion phase does not remain at its minimum fluidization velocity and travels up through the bed in a plug flow regime. 3. Bubbles grow only to a maximum stable size and travel up the reactor in a plug flow regime. 4. Particles are assumed to have a constant mean diameter, i I I ; T V s ? I ÿ Î

Ethylene, hydrogen, nitrogen and cocatalyst are assumed to be present in the gas phase. Hom opolym erization o f ethylene is assumed.

. Radical concentrations and temperature gradients within the bed, resistance to material transfer between gas and solids and élutriation are assumed to be negligible.

In the mole balance relations, the rate equations can be written for each species (e.g. hydrogen, cocatalyst...) in each phase (bubble phase and emulsion phase) based on the corresponding monomer, active sites, cocatalyst and hydrogen concentrations. and /=i /.i,

A FB R behaves as a tubular reactor and the m odel should take into account the rate o f accum ulation and th e rate o f advection along w ith the rate o f transfer o f m aterial or energy. Hence, the m aterial and energy balance equations in the em ulsion and bubble phases were developed for each reactant concentration (monom er, chain transfer agent, cocatalyst, active sites) and for the reactor tem perature throughout the bed.

Therefore, the change in the m onom er m olar balance in the bubble phase is represented by:

4.4 Polym er Properties
Based on the m om ent's balance, polym er properties such as number and weight average molecular weight, polydispersity index and m olecular weight distribution o f polym er can be determined.

4.4.1 Number Average and Molecular Weight Average The num ber and w eight average m olecular weight o f growing polymer can be defined as:

^
./=!
A'.v

+A , (./) --------------------------------------------------------------

>1_____________ M , = MwJÿ, N\--------------------

(4.64)

W here M w is the m olecular weight o f the monom er and A, and / i , , the m om ents o f live and dead polymers, are defined in Equation (4.12):

4.4.2 Polvdisnersity Index The polydispersity index (FDI) o f polym er chain can be defined by the ratio o f the weight average to number average m olecular weight and can be written as: PDI = ^ M.. (4.65)

4.4.3 Molecular W eight Distribution M olecular weight distribution (M W D) is an important polym er property because it reflects the kinetics and mechanistic history o f the polymer synthesis. Also it is an im portant tool to assess the quality o f a polym er product for a specific application. Two polymers being similar by standard methods o f chemical analysis may be different in M W D; consequently, their physical, mechanical and reological properties are different as well.

i;

Flory's m ost probable distribution (Flory, 1953) can be used to describe the instantaneous M W D of polyolefins with linear chains made with single-site type catalysts: M '{r) = T' r e x p (-n ') (4.66)

where n'(r) is the weight chain length distribution o f chains o f length r and r is the ratio o f transfer rates to propagation rate.

The ratio o f rate o f transfer reactions to propagation ra te r can be written as: r = I 1 I I I ^'1" ^ I (4 6 7 )

where

and

are the rates o f propagation, spontaneous transfer,

transfc]- to monom er, transfer to transfer agent (hydrogen in this study) and transfer to cocatalyst respectively. Many Ziegler-N atta and metallocene catalysts produce polyolefins w ith M W D that can be closely predicted by Flory's m ost probable distribution. It turns out that for polym ers obeying Flory's distribution, the polydispersity index is equal 2 and the num ber average chain length, r,,, o f polym er is equal to 1/ r . For multiple site catalysts, some researchers have demonstrated that each site type produces polymer chains that instantaneously follow Flory's distribution. In this case, the instantaneous MWD for the whole polym er will be a weighted sum o f individual Flory's distribution (Soares and Hamielec, 1995). _____ N x w(/-) = ^/MyU' y(r) = ./ ./ .r^r e x p ( - r .r ) (4.68)

where / indicates active site type and mj is the mass fraction of polym er produces with each site type.

4.5 N um erical Solutions
In this section the numerical solution o f the reactor model is discussed.

4.5.1 S tead y -S tate M odel The steady-state model describes the variations o f concentrations for monom er, catalyst, cocatalyst, hydrogen, bulk polym er and reactor temperature along the bed. The final system o f ordinary differential equations consists o f twenty-eight ordinary differential equations and can be solved using several numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equation. In this w ork we employed M ATLAB software using multi-step G ear's m ethod for stiff equations. The software is capable o f finding the best initial step size for each set o f ordinary differential equations in each run. The boundar}' conditions that were considered for this model are presented in section 4.3.6.

4.5.2 D ynam ic M odel The dynamic model describes the variations o f the monomer, catalyst, cocatalyst, hydrogen and polymer com ponent with axial position in the reactor and tim e, for non-isotherm al conditions. The model can be solved by the method o f Finite Differences. W ith this method the set o f partial differential equations can be converted to a set o f ordinary differential equations by using proper grid points along the reactor height. Therefore, this set o f equations can be solved by m ulti-step G ear's method for stiff equations. The boundary and initial conditions are presented in section 4.3.6.

Finite D ifference M eth o d Finite difference m ethod is a simple and efficient method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDFs) in problem regions with simple boundaries. The method requires the construction of a mesh defining local coordinate surfaces. For each node o f this mesh, the unknown function values are found, replacing the differential equations by difference equations. Employing Taylor series expansion we can derive the finite-divided-difference approximations o f derivatives. Forward, backward and centered difference approxim ations are three main approxim ations derived from Taylor series expansions. The Finite Difference approximations can be represented generally as:

5.1 S tead y-S tate M od el
The reactor model is com prised o f a hydrodynam ic model and a kinetic m odel for ethylene polym erization. The hydrodynam ic m odel representing physical phenom ena describes the properties o f bubble and em ulsion phases. The kinetic model representing the chem ical phenom ena describes the chem ical changes occurring in each phase. The reactor model is superior to a traditional tw o-phase concept in that it considers the progress o f reaction with the existence o f solid particles in bo th phases. A lso, it shows a m ore realistic understanding o f the phenom ena encountered in a FBR. A com prehensive kinetic model has been developed for polym erization o f ethylene. C haracterization o f polym er properties is sim ulated using the m ethod o f m om ents (Felorzabihi, 2004b). A pplication o f the m ethod o f m om ents enables prediction o f useful inform ation (polym er production rate, m onom er conversion, active site inform ation) and th e physicochem ical characteristics o f the polym er (average m olecular w eights, density, polydispersity, m elt index, branching frequency). The hydrodynam ic model and the kinetic model w ere coupled and solved sim ultaneously to show a com plete sim ulation o f the fluidized bed reactor. The m odel ability to predict th e behaviour o f the reactor is assessed through several runs for ethylene polym erization in the presence o f Ziegler-N atta catalyst under different reactor operating conditions. The physical properties o f the inlet gas to the reactor were calculated using Hysis sim ulation package. The model output show s interesting results for the reactants concentrations in the bed. The basic param eters used in this study are show n in Table 5.1. The effects o f model main param eters and reactor operating conditions are investigated for the highest ethylene conversion along the bed.

5.1.1 Steady-State and Isothermal In contrast to m ost conventional fluidized bed reactors, the solid phase (polym er) is o f prim e im portance in gas phase olefin polym erization (Choi and Ray, 1985). The co .version

I

o f m onom er per one pass in a fluidized bed reactor is relativ ely low and it is about 1% to 5% per one pass (M cA uley et ah, 1994). A typical result for m onom er conversion and m olecular properties o f polym er under isotherm al condition is shown in Figures 5.1-5.5. O ther relevant plots are arranged in A ppendix B. As show n in Figures 5.1.a and S .l.b , m onom er conversion is m uch higher in em ulsion phase than in bubble phase because o f higher reaction rate (Figure B.4). This is due to the existence o f more solid catalyst particles in the em ulsion phase and also because o f higher residence tim e for polym erization reaction and diffusion o f m onom er in the em ulsion phase. T he profile o f overall m onom er conversion in the bed according to Equation (4.29) is shown in Figure 5 . I.e. The overall m onom er conversion is about 1% per pass in the fluidized bed reactor under isotherm al condition.

The cum ulative num ber average and w eight average m olecular w eight o f polym er per pass versus conversion are plotted in Figures 5.2 and 5.3, respectively. They decrease with m onom er conversion. This is due to a high reduction in concentration o f reactants in com parison with form ation o f living polym er chains. Besides, and decrease m ore

rapidly in the em ulsion phase than in th e bubble phase because o f higher reaction rate. M ,, is in the range o f 60600 in the bed, w hereas M,,, is in the range o f 135600, giving a polydispersity index o f 2.24. These values are in good agreem ent w ith actual data reported for num ber and w eight average m olecular w eights o f H D PE polym er produced with ZieglerN atta catalysts (O dian, 1991). H ow ever the PDI in this study is low er than the actual

Profiles o f polydispersity index are shown in Figure 5.4. Polydispersity index increases slightly in the bubble phase, whereas in the emulsion phase it decreases from 2.24 to about 2.22. The overall polydispersity index in the bed obeys the same trends as bubble phase does. These values are basically dependent on the numerical values o f kinetic rate constants and operating conditions and can also be above these values. Figures 5.5.a, 5.5.b and 5.5.c show profiles o f molecular weight distribution M W D o f the polym er for bubble phase, em ulsion phase and overall M WD in the bed, respectively. The mode] considers the existence o f two active sites on Ziegler-Natta catalyst and simulations showed that about 94 % (by weight) o f solid polymer is produced by site one and 6% by site two (for both bubble and em ulsion phases). The simulation predicts that site one produces polymer with broader molecular weight distribution than site two.

for polymerization. However, more cocatalyst is consumed in the emulsion phase than the
bubble phase because o f higher polymerization rate. Figures B .l and B.2 in A ppendix B show catalyst and cocatalyst consumption in both phases and their overall concentration in the bed. In the bubble phase catalyst consumption remains relatively low, but in em ulsion phase catalyst concentration decreases slightly from 0.05 mol/L to about 0.0496 mol/L per pass in the bed. Hydrogen is used as a chain transfer agent in ethylene polym erization to control the molecular weight o f the polymer. It also can be used for transferring solid catalyst particles into the bed. Figure B.3 shows a relatively small consumption rate o f hydrogen in both phases. In FBR the bubble size, which depends on the distributor character, is an im portant and influential hydrodynamic parameter, which affects bubble velocity and heat/m ass transfer coefficients. The bubble size increases along the bed height until it reaches to its maximum allowable size. Figure B.5 shows the profile o f bubble growth along the bed.

The profile o f reactor tem perature is shown in Figure 5.11. The reactor tem perature increases gradually along the bed from 380 K to about 383 K in the bubble phase and to about 389 K in em ulsion phase. The top portion o f reactor is much warm er than the low er portion. The tem perature increase is attributed to a higher activity o f catalyst in the propagation o f young polymer particles (as fluidizing gas moves upward in the bed and react with the catalyst, more active sites undergo initiation process). Also, reactor tem perature increases more rapidly in em ulsion phase than in the bubble phase because o f higher polym erization rate in emulsion phase (Figure B.9). Catalyst consum ption in the bubble phase is not significantly influenced in a non-isotherm al process. Cocatalyst consum ption in the bubble phase and em ulsion phase is not altered significantly in the non-isotherm al process (Figure B.7).

5.2 E ffects of O ther O perational Param eters (Steady-State)
The effect o f im portant reactor param eters (e.g. superficial gas velocity, mean particle size, bubble size, gas feed temperature, chain transfer agent and recycle stream), on the steady-state behavior o f the FBR is thoroughly investigated.

5.2.1 Superficial Gas Velocibv' The superficial velocity is an im portant parameter. It m ust rem ain sufficiently high to entrain large solid particles m oving upward in the bed and at the same time perm it good heat removal (Choi and Ray, 1985). Therefore, as reported by W agner et al. (1981), industrial polyethylene fluidizcd bed reactors operate at superficial gas velocities ranging from 3 to 6 times the minimum fluidization velocity. Increasing superficial gas velocity allows bubble growth size to expand (Figure C.5 in Appendix C) and reduces interfacial area between phases, w hich ultim ately reduces m ass/heat interchange between phases. On the other hand, a decrease in the superficial gas velocity results in an increase o f reactants mean residence tim e in the bed. As a result, concentrations

o f m onom er, hydrogen and cocatalyst in both phases decrease m ore rapidly. H ow ever, this effect is more significant in bubble phase than in emulsion phase. The effect o f superficial gas velocity on m onom er conversion is illustrated in Figure 5.12.

It can be seen that reducing superficial gas velocity by h a lf will alm ost double the conversion o f m onom er in the em ulsion phase and triple the conversion in the bubble phase. Also, the tem perature increases more rapidly along the bed w ith low er superficial gas velocities for both phases (Figure 5.13).

Figures 5.14 and 5.15 show the effect o f superficial gas velocity on the profiles o f num ber and w eight average m olecular w eight o f polym er in the bed. The figures dem onstrate that processes w ith low er superficial gas velocities has higher at high conversions M,, and and at low conversions but

are lower with low er superficial gas velocities. As

superficial gas velocity decreases, the rate o f heat and mass transfer betw een the phases increase, therefore, the production o f active sites and m om ents o f polym er increases. As a result M,, and M ,, increases. B ut as the reaction proceeds, m ore active sites undergo and becom e low er at higher

deactivation process therefore m om ents o f polym er and conversions.

The effect o f superficial gas velocity on the polydispersity index is show n in Figure

5.1 6.

The PD I in the bubble phase is low ered as superficial gas velocity decreases. H ow ever in em ulsion phase, this trend is opposite. The P D I profile in the bed is illustrated in Figure
5.16.C .

This plot shows that the superficial gas velocity affects significantly the profile o f

overall polydispersity index in the bed.

Figure C.2 in A ppendix C illustrates the effect o f superficial gas velocity on cocatalyst consum ption in the bed. B ut at higher superficial gas velocities there is no significant difference in cocatalyst consum ption rate in bubble phase. However, at low er superficial gas velocities (uO=3 cm /s), there is a steep decrease in cocatalyst concentration. Sim ilar trend is predicted fo r catalyst in the bubble phase (Figure C .l.a). In em ulsion phase, catalyst and cocatalyst concentrations decrease with reducing superficial gas velocity, w hich is prim arily attributed to an increase in the polym erization rate. The effect o f superficial gas velocity on polym erization rate in both phases is illustrated in Figure C.4. This variable has a very significant effect on im proving the reaction rate in the bubble phase. Reducing superficial gas velocity by h alf will alm ost double the polym erization rate in the em ulsion phase and increase it in the bubble phase by m ore than ten times.

5.2.2 M ean Particle Size In practice, the continuous addition o f catalyst and rem oval o f product leads to a distribution o f particle size in the bed ranging from 0.005 to 0.2 cm (M cA uley, et al. 1994). If all particles in the FBR have the sam e size, then an increase in the particle size im plicitly affects all main fluidization param eters including m inim um fluidization velocity, term inal velocity, m axim um stable bubble size and heat and m ass transfer coefficient betw een the bubble phase and em ulsion phase. Figure 5.17 and 5.20 illustrate the effect o f m ean particle size on the steady state m onom er conversion and tem perature, respectively. M onom er conversion and tem perature vary significantly w ith the average particle size in the bubble phase. It is im portant to note that an increase in the m ean particle size results in an increase in the m inim um fluidization velocity. A secondary effect is to increase the term inal velocity and m axim um stable bubble size (Figure C.IO). In the bubble phase, an increase in the bubble growth reduces interfacial area betw een the phases. As a result, the heat and m ass transfer rate between the phases reduces significantly. On the other hand, using larger particle size in the bed increases m inim um fluidization velocity. H ence, em ulsion velocity increases and its residence tim e decreases accordingly. Therefore, polym erization rate is low ered by increasing particle size in the em ulsion phase (Figure C.9.b) Profiles o f num ber average m olecular w eight and P D I are shown in Figures 5.18 and 5.19, respectively. A ccording to these figures, processes w ith sm aller particle size may produce polymers w ith higher num ber and w eight average m olecular w eights and low er P D I .

5.2.3 Gas Feed Tem perature Figure 5.21 illustrates profiles o f the monom er concentration in a FB R for bubble and emulsion phases and for three different gas-feed temperatures. As the inlet gas tem perature rises, the concentration o f reactants falls because o f the higher reaction rate. In the first 25% o f the reactor, there is no significant difference between m onom er conversion profiles at the three different tem peratures. However, in the upper reactor portion, ethylene concentration decreases faster with higher gas feed temperatures due to higher reaction rate. For a 10 K increase in the inlet gas temperature, the monomer conversion alm ost doubles in the bed. Similar trend is obtained for catalyst and cocatalyst in the first 10 % o f the reactor height and for hydrogen in the first 25% o f the height (Figures C .l 1, C.12 and C.13).

Further, similar trend is obtained for weight average m olecular weights o f the polymer along the bed. A t low conversions, higher inlet tem peratures produce polymers w ith elevated higher conversions (at the exit o f the bed) temperatures. Increasing inlet gas tem perature reduces P D I in the bubble phase (Figure 5.24), but it has hardly any effect on P D I in the em ulsion phase. Furthermore, no effect is registered îox M W D o f polymer in this range o f tem peratures, even though it is expected that M W D becomes narrower as tem perature increases. and and M ,, ,. But at

5.2.4 B ub b le Size To investigate the im portance o f using an accurate bubble growth size, sim ulations were performed to determ ine the effect o f the bubble growth size on model prediction. The bubble diam eter has been varied by changing the m aximum stable bubble diam eter in the bed. Since this param eter directly affects the profile o f bubble growth in the bed (Figure C .l 8). For the operating conditions o f Table 5.1, the Davidson-Harrison correlation predicts a m aximum bubble size o f approxim ately 23.46 cm. However, Grace (1986) recom m ended that this param eter should be taken with caution since the m aximum bubble diam eter depends strongly on the type o f solid particles in the FBR and the fluidization mode. Figure 5.25 shows the effect o f maxim um bubble diam eter on steady-state model predictions o f monomer conversion in the bed.

size in a fluidizcd bed causes low m onom er conversion and also low tem perature rise in the bubble phase (Figures 5.25 and 5.28). In the first half o f the bed, m onom er conversion in the emulsion phase is not appreciably influenced by bubble growth rate. In tire second h alf it increases w ith larger bubble size due to increase in diffusion o f gases from em ulsion phase to the bubble phase. I r contradiction with the finding o f M cAuley et al. (1994), the simulation has shown that the maximum bubble size is not a critical system param eter. This result is in good agreement with the findings o f Hatzantonis et al. (2000). The num ber and weight average molecular weights o f polym er increase w ith reducing m aximum bubble size in the bubble. But, M ,,, and P D I are not altered significantly for

all the ranges o f m aximum bubble size in the em ulsion phase.

As in Figure 5.28, the tem perature increases more rapidly in bubble phase w ith smaller bubble size due to higher heat and mass transfer rates. In em ulsion phase it has opposite trend. B ut this effect is more significant in the bubble phase. Furtherm ore, profiles o f cocatalyst and hydrogen concentration are show n in Figures C .l6 and C .l7, respectively, and it is show n that the m axim um bubble size does not have any effect on the average concentrations o f cocatalyst and hydrogen in the bed.

5.2.5 Recycle Stream 0' The conversion o f m onom er p er one pass in a fiuidized bed reactor is relatively low and it is about 1% to 5% per one pass (M cAuley et al., 1994). Furtherm ore, olefin polym erization is a highly exotherm ic reaction and a recycle stream equipped w ith a cooling system should rem ove the excess heat o f reaction as it is described in detail in Chapter 2. In order to assess the performance o f the system w ith a recycle stream, the previous model has been m odified to accom m odate the effect o f a recycle. It is assumed that the cooling system (heat exchanger and com pressor) reduces the tem perature o f the recycled gas to the inlet tem perature o f the m ain stream, w hich rem ains unchanged in terms o f com position. M onom er conversion is plotted in Figure 5.29. After 20, 30 and 40 passes m onom er conversion reaches about 84%, 89% and 92% , respectively, in the bed in steady-state mode. Furthermore, increasing the num ber o f passes results in decreasing num ber average molecular w eight o f polym er from 11000 to about 5000 and w eight average m olecular w eight o f polym er from 22500 to about 12000. A lso, M,, and em ulsion phase. Figure 5.32 shows that polydispersity index decreases when adding num ber o f cycles due to decrease in num ber and weight average m olecular weights in the bubble phase. In the em ulsion phase, there is an overshoot in the P D I as conversion increases per each pass in the bed. A lso higher num ber o f cycles favors P D I'm the em ulsion phase, leading to an increase in polydispersity index o f the polym er in the bed. in the bubble phase have narrower distribution in com parison to

It is observed that the tem perature in both phases decreases w ith increasing nu m b er o f passes. In Figure 5.33, the effect o f changing num ber o f cycles on the m olecular w eight distribution is illustrated. C learly, reducing the num ber o f passes broadens the m olecular w eight distribution o f polyethylene. T he explanation is that as tem perature increases, the rate o f propagation increases, but the rate o f term ination goes up to a greater extent, since chain term inations reactions have greater activation energies than propagation reactions. The rate constants o f term ination are less affected by a tem perature increase. C onsequently, the ratio o f the rate o f propagation to th a t o f term inations decreases, since the denom inator o f Equation (5.1) increases m ore rapidly than its num erator fo r an increase in the tem perature. The overall result is a decrease in the degree o f polym erization and hence the average m olecular weight. --------------------- M M ] --------------------V [M ] + V lA ] + + k,,, +... (5,1)

The effects o f adding a recycle stream on m onom er conversion are better quantified in Figure 5.35. There is a relatively high increase in m onom er conversion from 3 passes to 15 passes, w hereas after th at m onom er conversion increases gradually by the addition o f cycles. Furtherm ore, the sim ulation dem onstrates that the m onom er conversion can go up to 96 % after about 50 passes.

5.2.6 Chain Transfer Agent
H ydrogen is w ell know n as a good chain transfer agent for low ering m olecular w eight w hen producing polym er w ith Ziegler-N atta catalyst. I f w e assum e that transfer to hydrogen is the only significant reaction controlling m olecular w eight, it is evident that catalyst system s w ith higher hydrogen concentration produce shorter chains. Besides, chain transfer to hydrogen prevents other chain grow th reactions from producing longer chains. A s a result shorter chains w ith low er m olecular w eight are produced. Figure 5.36 show s the significant variation o f the num ber average m olecular w eights w ith hydrogen concentration. Sim ilar trend is predicted for w eight average m olecular w eights o f the polym er. Furtherm ore, high hydrogen concentration favours P D I in the bubble phase only, but it has no significant effect on the P D I in the em ulsion phase. The overall P D I in the bed has sim ilar trends as in the bubble phase. A lso as illustrated in Figure 5.38, higher hydrogen content in the gas feed produces narrow er m olecular w eight distribution in both phases, for both site one and two and the total distribution o f m olecular w eight in each phase. This is due to the increase in the rate o f transfer reactions to the propagation reaction.

5.3 D y n a m ic M o d e l The dynamic model describes variations o f monomer, catalyst cocatalyst, chain transfer agent and polymer chains with axial position in the reactor and polymerization time. The mode! has been solved by improved first order Finite Difference method. The model is capable of predicting reactants profile at each position in the bed with respect to tune. Also sixty grid points has been used in solving the sets o f partial differential equations. For instance, Figure 5.39 shows tlie profile of monomer conversion versus time in both bubble and emulsion phases at the reactor exit. Monomer conversion reaches 99% in nearly one hour. At this time the average catalyst concentration decreases from 0.05 mol/L to 4.45x10'^ mol/L and cocatalyst concentration from 0.7 mol/L to 0.694 mol/L (Figures D.l and D.2). Tire number average molecular weight is reduced significantly from about 60000 to 5000 when conversion reaches 97% (Figure 5.40). Similarly, M,,, of the polymer decreases from 135600 to about 10000 (Figure 5.41).

Evolution o f the P D l in the reactor is illustrated in Figure 5.42, giving a P D I value o f 2.24. As shown in this diagram, polydispersity index increases slightly in the bubble phase and decreases after the conversion reaches about 85% due to the reduction in the second moments o f polymer. Similarly in em ulsion phase at conversion about 90% polydispersity index decreases from 2.24 to about 1.8. A t this region almost all o f m onom er is consumed. T he profile o f polymerization rate is shown in Figure D.4. As shown in this diagram polym erization rate in both phases have its highest values at about 25% m onom er conversion that is attributed to the increase in formation o f active sites. Above this point polym erization reduces gradually until all monom er is converted to polymer. M oreover, according to the simulation results, polym erization is above 30 times higher in the vnulsion phase than in the bubble phase.

a) C oncluding R em arks A kinetic model has been derived from m olar balances o f the main com ponents in ethylene polym erization using multiple sites Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The kinetic scheme accounts for the formation, initiation and deactivation o f active sites as well as for spontaneous transfer and transfer reactions to hydrogen, m onom er and cocatalyst. A tw o-phase flow structure was employed to takes into account the hydrodynamics o f particles inside the bubble phase and the dynamics o f particle concentration In the emulsion phase, in terms o f the superficial gas velocity in the reactor.

The hydrodynamic and kinetic models were integrated together to make a com prehensive PDE model describing the dynamics the HDPE production along the gas-phase FB R reactor. The model takes into account the variation o f bubble size and bubble and em ulsion velocity along the reactor height. It is capable o f predicting profiles o f the main polym erizing components (monom er, hydrogen, potential active sites and cocatalyst) and also o f predicting o f the properties o f the polym er such as average molecular weights, polydispersity index and molecular weight distribution. Hence, the PDE model was integrated using an im proved first order Finite Difference method. The predictive capabilities o f the model are tested through extensive simulation runs that were carried out in order to assess the relative effects o f the main process parameters.

Sensitivity analyses o f the operating conditions showed that an inlet gas tem perature rise favours monom er conversion and number and weight average m olecular weights o f polymer per one pass in the bed. Higher hydrogen content in the gas feed produces polym ers with lower molecular weight and narrow er molecular weight distribution in both bubble and em ulsion phases. Also reducing superficial gas velocity by h alf alm ost doubles the conversion o f m onom er in the bed. Further, the reactor temperature goes up rapidly w ith low er superficial gas velocities in both phases and results in higher and Af,,,. W ith a decreasing bubble

phase were predicted. However, simulation tests have shown that the bubble size is not a critical parameter as claim ed by Hatzantonis et al. (2000) and it has little effect on the overall , MW D and PDI.

W ith a recycle stream, m onom er conversion can go over 90% in 40 passes. Increasing number o f cycles further resulted in lowering the number and weight average molecular weights of polymer. Although no data are available to validate the m odel, the simulation profiles for m onom er conversion and molecular properties o f polym er show that the model provides qualitatively reasonable results, based using proper-patented data only. In particular, the model confirm s a broadened molecular weight distribution, which is typical o f commercial high-density polyethylene.

b) R ecom m endations This work can be extended to investigate effects o f im purities in the system and modified further for copolym erization o f ethylene. Application o f an optim ization technique can also provide more inform ation on the process. Also the model can be further m odified to take into account the jet penetration region and the disengagement zone in the fluidized bed reactor. In the jetting region, mass and heat transfer rates are expected to be very high and therefore significantly affect the behaviour o f the system in this region. Furtherm ore, due to the wide range o f particle size in the bed (from small catalyst particles to large polym er particles) a particle population balance can be employed to predict the particle size distribution in the bed.
