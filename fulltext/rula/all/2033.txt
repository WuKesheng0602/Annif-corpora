An Investigation of the Performance of District Heating Substations using  Computer Simulation 
Master of Applied Science, 2011  Edmund Siu Wing Wong  Building Science  Ryerson University 

Abstract 
Low primary temperature drop across district heating substations is an undesirable  phenomenon observed in the district heating industry.  Professionals in the industry have  argued that this is caused by inappropriate sizing and controls of district heating substations.   The thesis aims to investigate the impact of design and operation parameters on the  performance of district heating substations, so that building designers and engineers can  potentially better design and operate new and existing district heating substations.  The thesis  shows that, by developing and using a physical model as a computational tool for sensitivity  analysis, different design and operation parameters can be evaluated.  This generates insights  for energy conserving control strategies to be developed.  A preliminary control strategy was  proposed for district heating substations, and simulation results show energy saving potentials.        iii

1. Introduction 
This thesis is concerned with the investigation of the impact of design and operation  parameters on the performance of district heating substations.  It aims to generate knowledge  for building designers and engineers to better understand and evaluate the performance of  district heating substations under different conditions, so that the performance of new and  existing district heating substations can be enhanced by better design and operation.   

1.1 Background 
The operation of residential and commercial buildings accounts for approximately 30%  of the total energy consumption in Canada, and 56% of that energy is used for space heating  [Natural Resource Canada (NRCan), 2008].  Residential and commercial buildings also account  for 28% of total greenhouse gas emissions [NRCan, 2008].  As concerns for climate change  continue to grow, a strong emphasis has been placed across the globe to reduce energy  consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of buildings.  Improving the energy efficiency of  building heating systems can contribute to the global effort in energy conservation and  reduction in greenhouse gas emission. 

Case studies have shown that adopting district energy systems can potentially achieved  a wide range of social, economic, and environmental benefits [Sibbitt et al., 2007;  Gabrielaitiene, Bohn, & Sunden, 2007; Hu, Zhou, Wang, & Neumaier, 2005; NRCan, 2004; Nijjar,  Fung, Hughes, & Taherian, 2009].  International Energy Association (1998) and Euroheat &  Power (2005) have also promoted district heating as a sustainable energy system that can aid 

1   

nations to effectively reduce global fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  In  Canada, interests in district heating systems are growing, and lowdensity communities are  starting to adopt district heating systems to replace conventional onsite heating systems.   Examples of lowdensity communities in Canada that have adopted district heating systems  include, but not limited to, the Drake Landing community, Markham downtown and the Band  Council of OujeBougoumou.    

To harness the potential benefits for adopting district heating systems, it is essential  that district heating substations are designed and operated effectively.  Ineffective design and  operation of district heating substations lead to poor energy performance and uncomfortable  indoor environments.  Poor energy performance is reflected by a low primary temperature  drop across district heating substations.  Low primary temperature drop across district heating  substations is detrimental to the overall performance of a district heating system, and is  undesirable to both the district heating suppliers and endusers.    Professionals in the district heating industry have questioned that low primary  temperature drop is potentially caused by inappropriate design and control of district heating  substations.  The challenge is that the interactions between district heating substations and  hydronic heating systems are complex.  It is difficult for building designers and engineers to  evaluate the impact of design and operation parameters on the performance of district heating  substations.  The challenge is further enhanced when novel and innovative building service and  control systems are involved.  Without the use of a computer simulation model, it is difficult to  evaluate the performance of district heating substations in professional practises.   

2   

Reducing primary temperature drop across district heating substations is a research  problem addressed in literature [Gustafsson, Delsing, & van Deventer, 2010; Li & Zaheeruddin,  2007; Xu, Hung, Fu, & Di, 2011; Zhao, Bohn, & Ravn, 1995; Zsebik & Siku, 2011].  Gustafsson et  al. (2010) proposed a control strategy of secondary supply temperature based on primary  supply temperature.  Li and Zaheeruddin (2007) proposed six hybrid fuzzy logic control  strategies to regulate fuel firing rate, water flow rate or water temperature in a district heating  system.  Xu et al. (2011) suggested daily and hourly adjustment of supply water temperature  according to the flow performance of the distribution network.  Zhao, Bohn, & Ravn (1995)  investigated the time delay and thermal storage in distribution network to optimize the  performance of a district heating system.  Zsebik and Siku (2001) investigated the connection  types of heat exchangers in a substation and their effect on primary return temperature.    Despite a rigorous literature review, the question of how the design of a district heating  substation affects its energy performance remains unanswered.  This thesis focuses on  investigating the positive or negative impacts of over and undersizing of heating equipment  on the performance of a district heating substation under different climatic and operating  conditions. 

1.2 Research Objective 
The research objective of this thesis is to investigate the thermodynamic interactions  between a district heating substation and a heating system within a building under different  design and operation parameters.  It aims to generate new knowledge for building designers 

3   

and engineers to better design and operate district heating substations, and in turn improves  the energy performance of district heating systems.  This is done by three steps:  (1) developing a physical model of a district heating substation connected to a hydronic  heating system   (2) investigating the impact of sizing of heating devices on the performance of a district  heating substation under different climate and operating conditions, and  (3) devising a new control strategy for district heating substations.  A physical model for a district heating substation and a heating system is developed.   The physical model serves as a computational tool that can enable building designers and  engineers to investigate the thermodynamic interactions between heating equipment.   A simulation study is conducted to investigate the impact of sizing on the performance  of a district heating substation under different climate and operating conditions.  Indoor  temperature and primary return temperature are considered as the main variables to assess  performance.  The positive and negative impacts of over and undersizing are discussed, and a  solution is presented to remediate the ineffective performance caused by an undersize system.  A new, preliminary control strategy is proposed to further enhance the energy  performance of district heating substations.  The performance between the proposed and  conventional control strategies are compared using the simulation model.  Simulation results  show that the new control strategy has the potentials to increase primary water temperature  drop.  The successful development of the proposed control strategy can be applied to district 

4   

heating substations, and potentially improve the overall energy performance of district heating  systems.   

1.3 Methodologies 
The mechanical equipment within a district heating substation and a residential building  are individually modelled based on firstprinciple heat and mass transfer equations.  The  physical modelling of different mechanical equipment are then joined together to generate an  integrated model.  Matlab Simulink is used as the computational platform to implement the  simulation model.  The simulation model allows the users to overcome the barrier of complex  thermodynamic interactions between heating equipment.  It can also be used to evaluate the  control strategy proposed.  After the simulation model is developed, sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate  the impact of sizing under different primary supply conditions and Canadian climates.  Toronto,  Vancouver, and Montreal were chosen as the locations for the simulation study as they  represent the three biggest and most populated cities in Canada.  Canadian Weather for Energy  Calculations (CWEC) climatic data for the nearest weather stations is used.  The building and  heating equipment design conditions, such as envelope structure and equipment sizing are  chosen according to literature and design guidelines to best reflect the residential homes in  Canada.

1.4 Thesis Outline 
This thesis begins with introduction, where the research problem is presented and the  research objective and methodologies are described.  The remaining of this thesis is organized  into 4 chapters as below:  Chapter 2 is a background review of district heating systems.  It introduces the  fundamentals of district heating, type of equipment involved and some modern district heating  systems.  Practical problems experienced in the district heating industry are also elaborated.    Chapter 3 describes the modelling approach, the theory behind development of the  simulation model, and the governing fundamental heat transfer equations.  Assumptions are  listed out and the design and operation parameters are explained.  Design load is calculated  based on ASHRAE guidelines.  Chapter 4 presents the simulation results of a district heating substation connected to a  singledetached residential house.  Simulations were performed using five different ratio of  capacitytoload, three different locations and three different primary water supply schemes.   The impact of different design parameters on primary water return temperature and indoor  temperature is investigated.  A method to remediate an undersized heating system is also  presented.  In chapter 5, a new control strategy which aims to increase the primary water  temperature drop across district heating substations is proposed.  The performance of the new  control strategy is simulated and compared with the conventional control method.  The  simulation was performed using three different locations and three different primary water  6   

supply schemes.  Potential benefits and limitations of the proposed control strategy are  discussed.   Chapter 6 concludes this thesis and points out the future work.

2. Overview of District Heating Systems 
2.1 Introduction 
The application of district heating systems had been limited to high density  communities.   But over the past decades, there has been significant technological  advancement in district heating systems.  The applicability of district heating systems has been  extended from urban to rural settings. New district heating systems can incorporate the usage  of renewable resources and energy conservation measures, making district heating an effective  energy system that can potentially reduce the dependence of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas  emissions [Joagoda, R. Lonseth, A. Lonseth, & Jackman, 2011].   The upcoming sections present  the fundamentals of district heating systems, their potential benefits, existing district heating  systems in Canada and practice problems observed in district heating systems. 

2.2 Background of District Heating Systems 
  District heating system distributes heat generated at a centralized location for heating 

requirements in buildings such as space heating and domestic hot water supply (DHWS).  There  are many existing district heating systems around the world.  The exact operation mode of each  district heating system varies, but there exists some general similarities.  A district heating  system can be divided into three main parts: (1) the centralized production plant, (2) the  distribution network, and (3) the consumers.  Figure 1 depicts the main parts of a district  heating system in a simplified diagram.

2.2.1 Centralized Production Plant 
A centralized production plant generates thermal energy by burning combustible  materials such as natural gas, oil and coal.  Other fuel sources have also been used in district  heating systems such as biomass, solar energy, and geothermal energy.  Regardless of the fuel  source used, all centralized production plants generate and transfer heat to a circulation  medium for distribution.  The circulation medium used for district heating is commonly hot  water or steam [Arkay & Blais, 1995].    Typically, the centralized production plant generates only thermal energy.  However,  many modern district heating systems can generate both electricity and thermal energy at the  same time.  This is known as Combined Heat and Power, and is often abbreviated as CHP.  CHP  utilizes the waste heat from electricity production process for district heating.  Figure 2 depicts  a simplified CHP process based on the Rankine cycle [Smith, Van Ness, & Abbott, 2005].  Water  9   

is heated at the boiler to generate high pressure steam.  The high pressure steam passes across  the turbine for electricity generation, and its pressure is decreased.  Then, the heat in the low  pressure steam is extracted by the condenser, which is connected to a district heating network.   The low pressure steam becomes liquid after passing through the condenser and is pumped  back into the boiler, and the process repeats.

Other than using combustible fuel, solar and geothermal energy can be used as fuel  sources in district heating systems.  Example of a solar district heating system is presented in  Section 2.4.  Solar energy and geothermal energy are considered as renewable energy.  They  can reduce the dependence of fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gases emissions.  Kyoto  protocol, signed by 37 countries, has forced governments to curtail emissions of greenhouse  gas.  This caused many countries to introduce incentive programs to convert their energy 

10   

sources from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources [Jagoda et al., 2011], increasing interests  in solar and geothermal district heating systems.     

2.2.2 Distribution Network 
In a district heating system, the distribution network is a circulation loop of below grade, insulated pipes where hot water or steam is transported from the centralized plant to  the consumers.  Modern district heating systems use a closed distribution loop, where water is  returned to the centralized plant after passing through the distribution network.  The  distribution network is also known as the primary loop.  As a result, the water or steam that is  supplied to consumers is called the primary supply, and the water that is returned to the  centralized plant is called the primary return.    There are losses of thermal energy at the distribution network, and this is due to the  temperature gradient between the circulation medium and the ground.  A higher temperature  in the circulation medium will increase the distribution losses.  Therefore, it is advantageous to  maintain the primary supply at a reasonable low temperature.  The distribution losses of a  steambased district heating system are usually higher than a waterbased system.  This is one  reason why waterbased systems are more advantageous than steambased systems.     Waterbased systems are also more advantageous than steambased systems when  district heating is used in tandem with CHP.  In CHP, production of steam pressure at over 150  psi or above reduces the efficiency of electricity production by 50%, whereas the production of  hot water reduces efficiency by less than 10% [Arkay & Blais, 1995].  A disadvantage of using  liquid as a circulation medium is that pumps are required in the distribution network.     11   

The primary supply temperature is different among existing district heating systems.   For example, the district heating system in downtown Toronto supplies saturated steam to its  customers at 200oC allyear round, whereas the Drake Landing solar district heating system  supplies hot water with its temperature varies between 40 to 50oC.  Many district heating  systems vary the primary supply temperature depending on outdoor temperature, as shown in  Figure 3.  Euroheat & Power [Euroheat & Power, 2008] suggests that the primary supply  temperature produced by the centralized plant should be no less than 60 to 75oC, depending on  local conditions.  Because of the low water supply temperature used in Drake Landing  community, specially designed airhandling units are required for adequate heat distribution  [Sibbitt et al., 2007].  The system design and choice of primary supply temperature levels are  strongly related to historical and traditional factors.  New district heating networks are often  built using water as a circulation medium with relatively low design temperatures.  This is to  reduce distribution losses and to provide the possibility to combine with CHP plants  [Gustafsson, 2011].

2.2.3 District Heating Substation and Building Heating System 
A district heating substation is a system unit that transfers thermal energy from the  distribution network to heating systems in buildings [Euroheat & Power, 2008].  The main  components of a district heating substation include a terminal heat exchanger, a controller, a  control valve, and an outdoor temperature compensator.  For district heating systems, hydronic  radiator systems are commonly employed to provide space heating, and the circulation loop  that connects the terminal heat exchanger and the hot water radiators is called secondary loop.   Therefore, the hot water that is supplied to the radiators is called secondary supply, and the  water that is returned to the terminal heat exchanger is called the secondary return.  Figure 4 depicts a simplified system schematic of a district heating substation connected  to a radiator.    The terminal heat exchanger transfers heat from the distribution network to the  heating system.  It prevents hot water supplied from centralized production plant to be directly  fed to the radiators in the building, thus allowing the substation to control the water  temperature supplied to radiators and other terminal devices.      The controller regulates the primary flow rate into the heat exchanger via the control  valve on the primary loop.  By controlling the primary flow rate into the heat exchanger, the  secondary supply temperature is maintained at a desired level.  The setpoint of the secondary  supply temperature is determined by the controller via the outdoor temperature compensator.    The outdoor temperature compensator measures the outdoor temperature and determines a  secondary supply temperature setpoint according to a temperature curve, as shown in Figure  5. 

13   

The hot water radiators are used to provide space heating within a building.  Note that  in practice, the hot water radiators within a building vary in sizes and numbers.  A hot water  radiator provides space heating via radiative and convective heat transfer.  The amount of heat  released from a radiator is controlled by a TRV (Thermostatic Radiator Valve).  A TRV is a self regulating valve that controls the indoor temperature by regulating the water flow rate across a  radiator.

It is important to note that some district heating systems do not employ terminal heat  exchangers, and the circulation medium from the centralized plant is directly fed to the  radiators within buildings for space heating.  This is referred as a directly coupled district  heating system.  The usage of terminal heat exchangers is known as an indirectly coupled  district heating system.   

2.3 Potential Benefits of District Heating Systems 
District heating can be more energy efficient than conventional heating system.  Based  on statistical data from 32 European Nations, it was reported that district heating system could  obtain an average primary resource factor of 0.82, the lowest relative to other common onsite  heating systems, see Figure 6 [Euroheat & Power, 2005].   The primary resource factor is  defined as the ratio between the nonregenerative energy input and final energy use.  Another 

15   

case study has also shown that fuel reduction ranging from 47% to 86% was achieved by  adopting district heating systems in China [Hu, Zhou, Wang, & Neumaier, 2005].   

 
Figure 6: Average primary resource factors of heating systems based on data from 32 European  nations 

CHP district heating plant is substantially more energy efficient than separate  generation of electricity and thermal energy, because heat that is normally wasted in  conventional power generation is recovered.  Conventional electricityonly power plant has a  fuel efficiency ranged between 30 to 40%, whereas a CHP plant can reach fuel efficiency up to  90% [International Energy Agency (IEA), 1998; Euroheat & Power, 2005], resulting in overall fuel  reduction.  The generation of electricity also provides energy security on a community level.   Following the Northeast Blackout in 2003, which left many communities in New York, New  Jersey, Vermont, Connecticut, and most of Ontario without power, the idea for smart grid is  propelled.  CHP can help the power industry to shift towards a more decentralized electricity  supply and bidirectional power flow.     

16   

International Energy Agency [IEA, 1998] has reported that existing district heating  systems, including industrial CHP, had reduced CO2 emissions from fuel combustion by  approximately 3 to 4% annually.  Adopting district heating systems has been recognized by  Euroheat & Power (2008) as one of the main initiatives to help the European nations in  reducing GHG emissions.   In recent years, interests of district heating systems in Canada are  growing and more district energy systems are being applied to smallsize communities.  For  example, the Markham District Energy Inc. (MDEI) is a new district energy company that utilizes  CHP to provide heating, cooling and electricity to Markham, Ontario, Canada.  It is estimated  that the system will reduce 50% of CO2 emission and 78% of NOx emission annually.  Other  communities that have recently adopted district energy systems include, but not limited to,  OujeBougoumou in Quebec, Dockside Green in British Columbia and Drake Landing in Alberta.   

2.4 District Heating Systems in Canada 
District heating systems have been used in Canada since the 1880s, primarily in the form  of group systems serving university, hospital, and government complexes [Arkay & Blais, 1995].   A small list of current Canadian district heating systems is displayed in Table 1.  While there are  several successful district energy systems, Canada has been well behind many other countries  in awareness and application of district energy technologies [Arkay & Blais, 1995].  In recent  years, interest of district heating in Canada is growing and advanced district energy system is  being applied to smaller communities.   

The Drake Landing Solar Community Project in Okotoks, Calgary, Canada, is an example  of an innovative district heating system that is applied to a small community [Sibbitt et al.,  17   

2007].  Figure 7 depicts a simplified system schematic of the solar district heating.  In spring and  summer, solar energy is collected by solar collectors placed on garage roofs.  The collected solar  energy is stored in a field of insulated, underground boreholes.  In winter, the thermal energy  stored in the boreholes is extracted to provide space heating for buildings via a district heating  loop.  Data of preliminary operation indicated all major subsystems are operational, and a solar  fraction of 90% will be achieved in 5 years from the initiation of system operation. 

 
Figure 7: A simplified system schematic of the Drake Landing Solar Community Project [Sibbitt et al.,  2007] 

The community of OujeBougoumou, Quebec is another example where district heating  system is applied to a smallsize community.  The town of OujeBougoumou has a population of  approximately 500 people, and employs a district heating system that uses local renewable  materials such as sawdust and other wood waste as fuel source, with oil as backup.  The  district system services 122 houses and 19 public buildings, with a capacity of 3.7MW.

2.5 Practical Problems 
  It is desirable to have a large primary temperature drop across the district heating  substations in a district heating system, particularly for CHP operation.  By having a higher  temperature drop across the district heating network, more energy per unit volume of  distributed water will be utilized, thus reducing the energy used in distribution pumps.   Increasing the primary temperature drop also enhances the operational efficiency of the  19   

centralized production plant.  In a CHP plant, lower return water temperature increase the  steamcondensation capabilities of the condenser to condense the hot steam return from the  electricity producing turbines, resulting in a larger pressure drop across the turbine and thus  increasing electricity production and efficiency.  Study has suggested that an increase of  primary temperature drop of 10oC in a district heating system can results in an approximately  55% reduction in required pumping power, and fuel savings up to 14% [Persson, 2005].  Similar  study has also pointed out that a reduction of 1oC of return water temperature leads to an  increase of the system primary resource factor between 0.007 and 0.02 [Henze & Floss, 2011].   The primary energy factor relates the number of fuel energy units required for every unit of  delivered energy.    Reducing primary return temperature in a district heating system is a research problem  addressed by many researches [Zsebik & Sitku, 2001; Gustafsson et al., 2010, Li & Zaheeruddin,  2007; Lauenburg & Wollerstrand, 2010].   Zsebik and Sitku (2001) analyzed different connection  schemes of heat exchangers in a district heating substations and their effects on return water  temperature.  Gustafsson et al. (2010) proposed a new control strategy for district heating  substation to minimize the primary return temperature.  Li and Zaheeruddin (2007) proposed  six different hybrid fuzzy logic control strategies to regulate primary supply water temperature  in a directcoupled district heating system.  Lauenburg and Wollerstrand (2010) described how  the control of a hydronic system connected to a district heating network can be optimised to  provide the lowest possible primary return temperature.   

20   

A high primary return temperature is detrimental to the overall performance of the  district heating system and is not favoured by both the district heating provider and enduser.   It has been argued by professionals in the industry that the major causes of high primary return  temperature are inappropriate sizing of the district heating substation.  Based on literature  review, no research was found that is related to the impact of sizing on the performance of  district heating substation under the Canadian context.  It is of interest to investigate the  impact of design and operation parameters on the performance of a district heating substation,  so that building designer and engineers can potentially better design and operate new and  existing district heating systems.    

2.6 Concluding Remarks 
  The application of district heating systems can provide a wide range of potential 

economic and environmental benefits.  Case studies and statistical data have proved district  heating as a sustainable and reliable method to provide space heating, and can effectively  reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  As concerns of a limited fossil  fuel future and threats of global warming due to high CO2 emissions continue to grow, district  heating systems have an obvious place in the future energy systems.    To fully harness the economic and environmental benefits of district heating systems,  achieving a high primary temperature drop is essential.   However, low primary temperature  drop is an existing problem in district heating industry today.  A study on the design and  operation parameters of district heating substation can help address this problem, and  potentially generate new energy initiatives for district heating systems.

3. Development of a Dynamic Physical Model 
3.1 Introduction 
There are many different aspects to consider when developing a simulation model of a  district heating system.  Simulating the entire district heating system with a centralized  production plant, transmission pipelines and pumps, heat exchange substations, and the  heating equipment in a building is ideal, but the focus of this study is on the performance of  district heating substations and primary temperature drop.  For this reason, the boundary of  the simulation scope is limited to the thermodynamic interaction between a district heating  substation and a hydronic heating system. 

3.2 Approach for Developing a Physical Model for a District Heating Substation 
Commercial simulation packages for district heating exist, namely TERMIS and APROS,  and have been used in the literature for performance optimization [Gabrielaitiene et al., 2007;  Iversen, Ougaard, & Leppenthien, 2006; Li, Dalla Rosa, & Svendsen, 2010].  These simulation  packages have the capability to simulate the temperature profile and pressure difference  throughout an entire hydraulic network of a district energy system.  This is particularly useful in  the optimization of supply water temperature and plant production efficiency.  These  simulation packages, however, emphasize on the modelling of the entire hydraulic distribution  network and the equipment in a centralized production plant, and are not best suited for the  scope of this study.  A simulation tool is needed to account for the thermodynamic behaviour of  district heating substation in details, and provide flexibility on testing different control  strategies.  22   

Commercial thermal simulation programs such as EnergyPlus, DOE2, TRNSYS, and DeST  can be used to simulate the thermal performance of buildings connected to district heating  system.  However, Xu et al. (2011) argued that these existing commercial software focus heavily  on the building's characteristics but do not take into account the details of the heating systems,  e.g. TRV control processes, transport delay in radiators and heat exchangers, hydraulic  interactions between consumers.  These details are particularly important to analyze different  control strategies such as response time, setpoint overshoots and the degree of oscillation.       Many researches derived their own simulation models to account for the 

thermodynamic behaviours of buildings and their equipment [Xu, Fu, & Di, 2008; Liao & Dexter,  2004; Hong  & Jiang, 1997; Li & Zaheeruddin, 2004; Gustafsson et al, 2008; Tahersima et al.,  2010].   Hudson and Underwood (1999) outlined a simple building modelling procedure for a  thermodynamic building for Matlab Simulink.  Hong and Jiang (1997) outlined a statespace  method to simulate the thermal behaviour of a room, and then used it to develop a multizone  model.  Liao and Dexter (2004) developed a simplified physical model for estimating the  average air temperature in multizone heating systems for use in an inferential boiler control  scheme.  Li and Zaheeruddin (2007) developed a simplified physical model to evaluate six  different hybrid fuzzy logic control strategies that regulate primary supply water temperature in  a directly coupled district heating system.  Xu et al. (2008) developed a simulation model to  study the control effectiveness of thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) in directly coupled district  heating systems.  Gustafsson et al. (2010) developed a simulation model to evaluate the  efficiency improvement of a new control strategy for district heating substation.  Most of the  literature mentioned utilized Matlab Simulink to implement their simulation models.  23   

 

Statistical method is an alternative approach to determine thermodynamic behaviours 

by using building performance data [Letherman, Pailing, & Park, 1982; Crawford & Woods,  1985; Andersen et al., 2002; Madsen & Holst, 1995; Braun & Chaturvedi, 2002; Wang and Xu,  2006].  Letherman et al. (1982) described a technique to measure room thermal responses  using pseudorandom binary sequences.  Crawford and Woods (1985) described a method for  estimation of continuoustime models for the heat dynamics of buildings using discretetime  building performance data.  Andersen et al. (2002) proposed a continuous time modelling of  the heat dynamics of a building where statistical methods are used in parameter estimation  and model validation, while physical knowledge is used in forming the model structure.  Wang  and Xu (2006) developed a genetic algorithm estimator to estimate the lumped internal  thermal parameters of the building thermal network model using the operation data collected.   The major drawback of developing statistical model is that it requires a significant amount of  performance data, and may not be applicable to different buildings to reflect their physical  behaviours.  Statistical approach is also not recommended for the evaluation of control  strategies [Wang & Xu, 2006].  Matlab Simulink is chosen as the computational platform for the implementation of the  physical model.  Matlab Simulink provides a graphical interface where the thermodynamic  details and control process of a heating system can be freely designed, modelled and modified.   Matlab Simulink is also a reliable computational platform, as many researches had  implemented their physical models of district heating systems using Matlab Simulink [Xu, Fu, &  Di, 2008; Liao & Dexter, 2004; Hong  & Jiang, 1997; Li & Zaheeruddin, 2004; Gustafsson et al,  2008; Tahersima et al., 2010].   24   

3.3 Physical Modelling of a Dynamic System using LumpedCapacitance Method 
This section presents the fundamental heat transfer equations used for the physical  modelling of a heat exchanger, a radiator and a thermodynamic building.  The lumped capacitance model is applied to reduce the thermal system to a number of discrete nodes.  The  temperature is assumed to be uniform within each node, but may change over time.  This  approximation is useful to simplify complex partial differential heat equations to ordinary  differential equations.  The application of the lumpedcapacitance model to simulate the  thermodynamics of buildings were explained by Hudson and Underwood (1999), and had been  applied to the simulation of buildings and control systems [Kulkarni and Hong, 2004; Tahersima  F. et al., 2010; Gustafsson et al., 2010].   The fundamentals of heat transfer presented in this  thesis are based on heat transfer textbooks [Holman, 2002; Welty et al, 2001; Bejan & Kraus,  2003]. Three basic types of heat transfer are described: conductive, convective, and radiative.     For onedimensional heat conduction, Fourier's law can be applied as in Equation 1 

Assuming temperature difference across the thickness of the material and thermal conductivity  is constant, Equation 1 can be rewritten as 2, which is analogous with Ohm's law, where   is  analogous to electrical resistance.  (1)   (2)

The radiation between two surfaces or between a surface and its surroundings can be  described by the StefanBoltzmann equation as Equation 4 [Holman, 2002].  For small  temperature difference, the radiation heat transfer can be rewritten to Equation 5, and the  total heat transfer by both convection and radiation can be put together on a common basis in  Equation 6 [Bejan & Kraus, 2003].

3.3.1 Physical Modelling of a Dynamic System ­ Heat Transfer across Building  Envelope 
The envelope of a building consists of multiple layers of different size and construction  materials.  The temperature distribution across each layer can be calculated analogously as an  electrical circuit with heat current as electrical current and each wall layer as an electrical  resistor.  To calculate the surface temperature of the inner first layer of the wall envelope, a  heat balancing can be performed on the inner half of the first layer of wall envelope.  Assuming  a wall envelope with N number of layer, the heat balance equation of the first layer (indoor) of  the wall envelope (i = 1) can be described, using the lumpedcapacitance model, in Equation 7a.   Equation 7a can be simplified and rewritten as Equation 7b.

A fourlayer wall model with five temperature nodes is implemented in Matlab Simulink.   The simulation parameters used are described in Section 2.4.  Figure 11 shows the inter connections between each temperature node.  The wall model takes the input of indoor  temperature and outdoor temperature and calculates the instantaneous heat transfer from the  room to the wall.  The indoor temperature is calculated by the room model, and the outdoor  temperature is obtained from climatic data from Canadian Weather for Energy Calculations  (CWEC) [Environment Canada, 2005].

3.3.2 Physical Modelling of a Dynamic System ­ Hot Water Radiator 
The thermodynamic behaviour of a hot water radiator cannot be simply described by  Equation 5 because the hot water temperature across the radiator is not uniform.  One could  take an arithmetic average of the inlet and outlet water temperature, but literature suggests a  more accurate method by applying the Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference ( [Bejan & Karus, 2003] as expressed in Equation 11.  Note that this Logarithmic Mean  Temperature Difference is similar, but not identical to the ones commonly used in the heat  transfer calculations of heat exchangers.  The heat transfer rate of a radiator can be expressed  as Equation 12.  Note that F is a correction factor for pressure, capacity rate ratio and flow  arrangement, and can be expressed as an approximate radiator constant n.  For most  applications, the radiator constant is commonly set at 1.3 [Tashersima et al., 2010; Gustaffson  et al., 2008].    ) 

31   

A heat balance can be performed on the outlet of the radiator, as expressed in Equation  14.  The thermal energy supplied by the inlet water is expressed by Equation 13 and the outlet  water temperature of radiator can be calculated by Equation 15.

The radiator model takes the secondary supply  temperature, secondary mass flow rate, and indoor temperature as inputs and calculates the  secondary return temperature.

3.3.3 Physical Modelling of a Dynamic System ­ Heat Exchanger 
The thermodynamic behaviour of a heat exchanger is similar to that of a hot water  radiator.  One can treat the hot side and cold side outlets of a heat exchanger as nodes using  the lumpedcapacitance method, as shown in Equation 16 and 17.  But the log mean  temperature difference includes both the hot side and the cold side outlet temperature,  making Equation 16 and 17 nonlinear differential equations.   The complication of nonlinearity  can be resolved by adding a node to the heat exchange wall between the hot and cold fluid  [Gabrielaitiene et al., 2006, Gustafsson et al, 2008].  As a result, the heat transfer between the  two fluids becomes convective heat transfer between a fluid and the heat exchanger wall.   33   

Thus, the log mean temperature difference is split into linear Equations, as shown in Equations  19 to 21.

The heat transfer rate is not uniform across the heat transfer surface of a heat exchanger  [Bejan & Kraus, 2003].  To better model the distribution of temperature across the heat transfer  surface, the heat exchanger is divided into a finite number of discrete stages or nodes, as  shown in Figure 13.  The accuracy in calculating the physical temperature distribution across a  heat exchanger is proportional to the number of discrete stages, but simulation time gets more  intensive as the number of discrete stages increases.  Gustafsson et al. (2008) used three  discrete stages in series for the modelling of heat exchangers in a district heating substation.   An example of the mathematical setup of a heat exchanger with three discrete stages is shown  in Equations 22 to 30.

The heat exchanger model takes the primary flow rate, secondary flow rate, primary 

supply temperature and secondary return temperature as inputs, and calculates the primary  return temperature and secondary supply temperature.  The heat exchanger model is 

36   

developed by Gustafsson et al. (2008).  Figure 14 shows the Simulink implementation of the  heat exchanger model.

3.3.4 Physical Modelling of a Dynamic System ­ Interior Room 
The thermal indoor environment can be described by the room air temperature using  the lumpedcapacitance model.   Assuming temperature distribution is uniform within a zone of  a building, the room air temperature of a single zone can be calculated by summing all the heat  transfer rates as shown in Equation 31.  Figure 15 illustrates the heat transfer processes within  a zone of a building.

Figure 15: A sketch of heat transfer dynamics within a zone [Xu et al., 2008] 

The heat transfer process in a room includes:    Heat transfer from the hot water to the radiator shell through convection  Heat exchange between the air and the inner layer of the envelope (wall, ground and  roof) with thermal inertia      Solar radiation  Heat transfer through glazing without thermal inertia  Heat transfer via air infiltration through crack and openings  Heat transfer between neighbouring zone

Multiple zones can be setup by an additional term in Equation 31.  The heat transfer  rate between zones via internal partition can be calculated using Equation 7 to 10.  The heat  transfer rate between interconnected zones must be added to the heat balance equation of  each zone as shown in Equation 32.  Figure 16 shows the interior room model developed in  Matlab Simulink environment.

3.3.5 Thermostatic Radiator Valve 
A thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) controls the hot water flow rate across a radiator by  sensing the indoor temperature.  The sensor contains an actuator that passively adjusts the  valve opening based on the temperature in the room.  Control equations of the flow rate across  TRV can be set up based on the works of Gustafsson et al. (2010).  Equation 33 describes the  control behaviour of the TRV.  Figure 17 presents the thermostatic radiator valve model in  Matlab Simulink environment.     3600

3.3.6 Controller at a District Heating Substation 
Traditionally, the temperature setpoint for hot water flowing across a radiator is fixed  yearround.  In the past decade, temperature compensators are commonly available and they  can be used in district heating substations to adjust the secondary water supply temperature  setpoint according to outside temperature.  This reduces the possibility of having excessively  hot supply water flowing to radiators during intermediate seasons, and allows the TRV to  compensate as little as possible even at large outdoor temperature change.  This is expected to  remediate a lot of overheating phenomena in directcoupled district heating system described  in literature [Xu et al., 2008].    The controller defines the secondary supply temperature setpoint based on the  secondary temperature curve in Figure 5.  It measures the error in the secondary supply  temperature and regulates the control valve located on the primary loop on the outlet of the  heat exchanger.  By adjusting the control valve, the water flow rate flowing into the heat 

41   

exchanger is regulated.  A regular PIcontroller is employed and the signal equation of the PI  controller is described by Equation 34 [Liptak, 1995].

3.4 Integrated Model 
  The physical models of different heating devices presented from Section 3.3.1 to 3.3.4 

are combined together to form an integrated simulation model.  Figure 19 presents the overall  structure of the simulation model.  It shows the inputs and outputs of each subprocesses and  how they are interconnected with each other.  Overall, the integrated simulation model takes  climatic data and primary supply temperature to simulate the primary return temperature and  indoor temperature.  The heat exchanger model and the heat exchanger controller model are  considered part of the district heating substation, while the radiator model, TRV model, and the  room model are considered part of the thermodynamic building.

3.5 Model Parameters 
Based on the statistical data in 2008, singledetached houses made up of 56.5% of all  residential types in Canada and this percentage remained consistent since 1990, see Table 2  and 3 [NRCan, 2008].  Singledetached houses also account for 74.4% of the total energy used  for residential space heating in Canada in 2008 [NRCan, 2008].  Because of these factors, a  singledetached residential house is chosen as the simulation subject, as they represent the  most significant building type in terms of quantities and energy consumption.   The three provinces with the largest number of residential buildings are selected, which  are Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia.  The three metropolitan cities selected are Toronto,  Montreal, and Vancouver, as they contain the largest population in their respectively provinces  [Statistics Canada, 2010].

District energy such as CHP to provide both space heating and cooling is common. In  Canada, however, space heating is the predominate end use of energy, about 40 times more  than cooling, see Table 4 [NRCan, 2008]. Thus, the scope of this study is limited to the heating  season only.  Heating season is considered to be from September to May.

A typical house located in Toronto is selected and used as the subject for the simulation  study.  The geometry and building materials of the model house are presented in Table 5 and 6.   The abovegrade walls are constructed with a 100mm brick layer on the exterior face, followed  by layers of 25 mm air cavity, 95mm extruded polystyrene insulation (EPS), and gypsum board  on the inside. The belowgrade wall consists of a layer of 200mm concrete, followed by layers  of 25mm EPS insulation, plywood, and gypsum board on the inside. The roof is topped with a  layer of roofing clay tile and is insulated with a layer of 145 mm EPS insulation. The windows  are clear, double glazed units framed with polyvinylchloride (PVC) with a Uvalue of  2.27W/m2.K.  Example of the thermal properties of the building materials are presented in  Table 6.

The distribution medium used in each district heating system is different.  For example,  district network at downtown Toronto uses steam as circulation medium and Cornwall, Ontario  uses hot water [Arkay & Blais, 1995].  The advantages of using steam as a medium are that no  pump is required at the distribution network, and steam can be used for winter humidification.   However, using steam will result in higher distribution heat losses.  The advantages of using hot  water as a medium are that it is relatively safer and easier to satisfy operation codes than  steam.  It incurs a less heat losses during transmission and there are less expensive piping  requirements.  More importantly, hot water is more favoured over steam when a district  heating system is in tandem with CHP, as discussed in Section 2.2.2.  Therefore, hot water is  used as the distribution medium for the simulation model.   The heating devices in the simulation model are sized according to ASHRAE guidelines  [ASHRAE, 2009].  This is a method commonly used by engineers in the industry to size HVAC  equipment.  The Carrier System Design Manual also provides guidelines for design load  calculation, and is commonly used by HVAC designers.  Details of the calculations on design  load are presented in the Appendix.   

46   

Ratio of capacitytoload (RCL) is used to associate the capacity of heating devices.  It is  defined as the actual capacity over design load of a heating device, as shown in Equation 35.  In  the simulation study, five arbitrary RCL of 0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.3 will be used to mimic over  and under sized heating equipment.  The associated design flow rate and heat transfer area of  the terminal heat exchanger at district heating substation are presented in Table 7.  The  hydronic radiator that regulates indoor temperature is essentially a heat exchanger, and is sized  similarly to the sizing of the terminal heat exchanger, with the same value of power output.

3.6 Concluding Remarks 
In this chapter, different approaches for developing a physical model for a district  heating substation and heating equipment are investigated.  Many existing commercial  software are available to perform dynamic building simulations, but they usually do not take  into account the details of the heating system or do not provide the flexible for users to readily  48   

assess and modify the underlying mathematical algorithms.  This is particularly important in  analyzing control strategies.  As a result, a physical model is specifically developed via basic  fundamental principles in the Matlab Simulink environment.     A method to develop a physical model for a district heating substation and a  thermodynamic building is presented in this chapter.  Model parameters are specified  according to literature and standard design guidelines.  The physical models of different heating  devices are connected together to create an integrated model in Matlab Simulink.  The  simulation model is now available to compute the performance of a residential singledetached  home connected to district heating.  In the next chapter, different design and operation  parameters are used in the simulation to evaluate the impact of these variables on the  building's performance.

4. Simulation for a Canadian Residential House connected to District Heating 
4.1 Introduction  
In North America, oversizing is often mentioned as a common observed problem in  heating system.  Oversized heating equipment can lead to energy inefficient operations, create  uncomfortable conditions and large temperature swings in the house [U.S. Department of  Energy, 2011; Andersen et al., 2000; Humphreys & Nicol, 2002].  United States Department of  Energy mentioned that heating systems have been found two or three times larger than is  needed for a given structure [US Department of Energy, 2011].  Other publications have also  mentioned that some heating contractors and designers use simplified rules of thumb to  determine how large a heating system is needed [US Department of Energy, 2011, Taunton  Press, 1999].  For example, a case was observed where contractors on the West Coast in the  United States use 40 Btu/hft2 (126 W/m2) as a basis for sizing heating equipment, where heat  loss calculations show that 11 Btu/hft2 (35 W/m2) should be used [Ali, 2009].    The thermodynamic interactions among heating devices connected to district heating  are different from conventional onsite heating systems, and the impact of over and under sizing of heating devices on the performance and indoor thermal comfort is also different.    Based on literature review, no research was found that investigated the impact of oversizing on  the performance of district heating substations.  As interests in district energy system  proliferate in Canada, it would be valuable to determine the positive or negative impacts of  over and undersizing on the performance of district heating substations. 

50   

In the previous chapter, an integrated simulation model for a district heating substation,  a thermodynamic building and its associated heating equipment was developed.  In this  chapter, sensitivity analyses are performed using the simulation model to better understand  the impacts of design and operation parameters on the performance of a district heating  substation under the Canadian climate.  Specifically, the sizing of heating equipment under  different primary supply modes and building locations is investigated.  Through this study, the  capability of the simulation model developed can be displayed, and potential optimization  strategies for the performance of district heating substations can be proposed.  The simulation is performed using three different hot water supply modes, at three  different locations, with five different ratios of capacitytoload (RCL) for heating equipment.   Details of the simulation cases are presented in Table 8.  This combines to a total number of 45  simulation cases.  The three supply modes are chosen according to actual common practices by  centralized plants [Gustasson et al., 2010].  The first supply mode (supply mode A) is a  conventional supply temperature scheme, where primary hot water supply temperature varies  with outdoor temperature, as shown in Figure 5.  The second supply mode (supply mode B)  uses a constant supply temperature at 100oC, which represents a constant high supply  temperature.  The third supply mode uses a constant supply temperature at 70oC (supply mode  C), which represents a constant low supply temperature.

  It should be noted that there are district heating systems in which primary supply  temperature is much lower than 70oC.  District heating systems that utilized renewable energy  sources are observed to use low primary supply temperature [Sibbitt et al., 2007; Ostergaard &  Lund, 2011].  For these district heating systems, specialized airhandling unit or heat pumps are  employed, and traditional radiator systems may not be suitable.  Since the heating system  subjected to study is a hydronic system in an indirectly coupled district heating system, a  constant primary supply temperature of 70oC is considered low [Euroheat & Power, 2008]. 

4.2 Methods of Performance Evaluation 
Unlike furnace and hot water boiler, residential houses on district heating network  receive heat from the terminal heat exchangers at district heating substations.  The  classification for operation efficiency of such system is different and much more complicated  than traditional heating systems.  In terms of fuel efficiency, a holistic evaluation would include  the electricity and steam production at the centralized plant, to pump power and transmission  losses in the distribution network, to the heat transfer efficiency of heat exchangers at heat  transfer terminals, to pump power required for hot water circulation in buildings.  In terms of  52   

cost for endusers, district heating users in Europe are commonly charged based on the amount  of energy they extract from the district heating network, which is calculated by multiplying the  primary mass flow rate across the heat exchanger and the primary temperature drop (T).  In  downtown Toronto, customers are charged based on the only primary mass flow rate.  In  Beijing, district heating cost is based on the floor area of the building and not consumption  pattern [Beijing International, 2003].  Charging schemes for endusers vary for each district  energy system.    Thermal comfort and energy performance are two important factors when evaluating  operation performance, for which the evaluation on thermal comfort is more abstract and  subjective.  Thermal comfort is defined by ASHRAE as the state of mind that expresses  satisfaction with the surrounding environment [ASHRAE, 2009].  The most common method to  address thermal comfort is the Fanger's model, which is a set of comprehensive heatbalance  equations based on the various elements of energy exchange.  The equations can be solved to  predict thermal comfort for any combination of environmental conditions and variables  outlined below:        Air temperature  Mean radiant temperature  Air movement/velocity  Relative humidity   Human clothing  Activity levels 

53   

Fanger (1970) devised a means of estimating a predicted mean vote (PMV) based on the  six characteristics above.  PMV is a rating of a positive and negative scale centered at zero as  optimal thermal comfort.  Using the PMV, the percentage of people dissatisfied (PPD) can be  predicted.  But the acceptable range of comfortable temperature can be different based on  local climate, culture, race, living habits, sex, age, etc.  The Fanger's model is based on  experimental results obtained during winter from American collegeage subjects under  exposures of three hours to uniform condition [Fanger, 1970].  Because of this, many  researches have been carried out in different countries with different climatic zones and  geographical locations [De Dear et al., 1991; Chung and Tong, 1990; Tanabe & Kimura, 1994].   Although, the results show no significant difference between comfort requirements in different  climatic zones, ages, sex, and body build.    Calculating variables such as indoor air velocity, relative humidity, human clothing and  activity levels brings an extended degree of sophistication to physical modelling.   Another  study has pointed out that it can be considered acceptable when the width of comfort zone  band is within ±2oC of temperature setpoint under the condition of no cloth changing or  behavioural adjusting [Humphreys & Nicol, 2002].  Assenting to this study, Xu et al. (2008)  defined overheating degree (OHD) and insufficient heat degree (IHD) to evaluate the control  effectiveness of heating equipment based on room temperature.  The mathematical definition  of OHD and IHD are described in Equation 36 and 37, respectively.      · ·

,        when Troom(t) > Tsetpt(t)+2  ,        when Troom(t) < Tsetpt(t)2  54 

(36)  (37) 

 

The definition of OHD and IHD provides a direct mean for a comparison study on the  control effectiveness of heating equipment based on room temperature.  It is relatively more difficult to assess the energy performance for district heating  substations than for conventional heating systems.  For example, fuel efficiency of a heating  system is defined as the thermal energy output per fuel consumed in joules, as shown in  Equation 38.  For conventional heating system, fuel is converted into thermal energy onsite,  and fuel input and energy output can be directly measured to calculate fuel efficiency.  For  district heating system, the production and consumption of thermal energy is not at the same  place.  Fuel is converted into thermal energy at a centralized location, and the thermal energy is  consumed by a group of buildings.  As a result, there is no direct, quantitative method to  measure the fuel efficiency of a district heating substation.   
   

Fuel efficiency =

100%  

(38) 

Based upon previous researches, the energy performance assessment of district heating  substations are based on the primary loop water temperature drop across the terminal heat  exchanger [Gustafsson et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2011, Henze & Floss, 2011].  This parameter is also  known as the degradation of temperature difference, which is defined as the reduction of  temperature difference between supply and return flow in a district heating system [Henze &  Floss, 2011].  Maximizing the primary water temperature drop across district heating substations is a  crucial factor in district energy system and has been cited in literature [Zsebik & Sitku, 2001;  Gustafsson et al., 2010, Li & Zaheeruddin, 2007; Lauenburg & Wollerstrand, 2010].  The reasons  55   

why it is desirable to achieve large temperature drop across district heating substations was  discussed in Section 2.5.   To assess the energy performance of district heating substations, the  following parameter, average primary temperature drop (  ) is defined.     where,   is the primary water supply temperature (K) and    is the primary water return temperature (K).  Pump power used to circulate water in the secondary loop can account for significant amount  of energy in a large building.   For residential hydronic heating systems in singledetached  houses and townhouses, small inline circulation pumps of 1/25 to 1/20 horsepower (30 to  37W) are typically employed.  The performance evaluation for pumps is described in Chapter 12  of ASHRAE handbook ­ HVAC Systems and Equipment.  Performance curves for the small inline  pumps can be obtained from manufacturers [Taco Inc., 2009; Grundfos Inc., 2001; Armstrong  Ltd., 2009; Bell & Gossett Inc., 2008] but the efficiency curves are not listed due of their small  power consumption.  Because of their relatively small energy consumption, pump power on the  secondary loop is not considered in this study.     (39) 

         

4.3 Simulation Results and Discussions 
According to the simulation parameters outlined in Table 8, simulations were performed  to investigate the impact of ratio of designtoload, primary water supply mode, and location on  indoor temperature of the thermodynamic building and primary water temperature drop at the  56   

heat exchange terminal.   Using the climatic data from Canadian Weather for Energy  Calculations (2005), simulation is performed for the period from 1st of January to the 31st of  May, with January to March to represent high heating load period and April to May to  represent low heating load period.  The simulation timestep is 5 minutes, and the simulation  data is repeated in a 30minute interval.  The OHD, IHD, and   are calculated from the  simulated results and summarized in Table 9 and 10.  Discussions of the simulation results are  presented in the upcoming sections.

4.3.1 Impact of Ratio of CapacitytoLoad 
During low heating load period, larger heating equipment are observed to have a higher  number of OHD.  This is aligned to findings from literature.  With a PI controller at the heat  exchange terminal, the order of magnitude in OHD is in the range of 10 to 100  · .  This is 

59   

close to the simulation study performed by Xu et al. (2008) for hot water radiator with proper  TRV controls.    This level of OHD is quite acceptable for indoor temperature control, as it is  difficult to completely eliminate overheating during intermediate seasons.  According to their  study, the order of magnitude of OHD in a directcoupled system with no TRVs can reach up to  more than 10000 ·  within a heating season.  During low load period, all simulation cases 

are able to maintain consistent indoor temperature profile, see Figure 20 to 22.  Oversized  heating equipment by 30% (RCL 1.3) increased the OHD by 56% and 25% for Toronto and  Montreal, respectively.  Simulation results show acceptable indoor condition where ASHRAE guidelines were  used to calculate the design load for the heating systems.  With a RCL of 1.3, a heating system  did not produce an unstable indoor temperature profile.  Also, hot water radiators are usually  directlycoupled in older district heating systems.  With a substation and an outdoor  temperature compensator attached to the substation, overly hot water fed to radiator is  prevented.  Excessive supply water temperature is a major cause for indoor overheating  phenomena [Xu et al., 2011, Tahersima et al., 2010].    In high heating load period, indoor temperature profile deviates from temperature set point as RCL decreases.  From Figure 20 and 21, it is observed that by undersizing heating  equipment to a RCL of 0.7, indoor temperature can still be maintained consistently within ±2oC  of indoor temperature setpoint (22oC) for the case in Toronto and Montreal.  For the case of  Vancouver, however, indoor temperature begins to fall outside the ±2oC range of indoor  temperature setpoint at RCL of 0.9 (Figure 22).  At RCL of 0.7, indoor temperature falls 

60   

completely out of the ±2oC range of indoor temperature setpoint, and has an IHD up to more  than 2000 · .  Figure 23 presents the instantaneous heat transfer rate of the heating 

systems.  For Toronto and Montreal, the instantaneous heat transfer rate is almost identical for  all cases of RCL, except during peak loads for RCL 0.7.  For Vancouver, the instantaneous heat  transfer rate is consistently lower with RCL of 0.7 and 0.9, showing the system is unable to  provide heat as a rate as needed throughout the entire simulated period.  An undersized  heating system creates a more significant impact on indoor temperature for a location with  warmer climate.  This is counterintuitive.  The reason for this is investigated in the next section  where the impact of location on indoor temperature is discussed.     Primary water temperature drop (Tpr) is observed to increase with RCL based on all  simulation cases performed at both high and low heating load periods.  Figure 24 and 25  present the profiles of primary water temperature drop with different RCLs.  The figures show  consistent trends of higher RCL resulting in a higher primary water temperature drop.  This is  because with a larger heat transfer area, same amount of heat can be transferred with a lower  flow rate.  With a lower flow rate, heat transfer coefficient is also decreased, but water is  allowed longer time inside the heat exchanger (or radiator), transferring more energy per unit  of volume.  As a result, a higher temperature drop is achieved.  This does not mean equipping a  bigger size heating system leads to better performance, because larger system increases  overheating phenomena during intermediate seasons.  The amount of increase in primary  temperature drop is also bounded to diminish with larger size of heating system.   The  relationship of diminishing return between primary temperature drop and RCL can be further  explored in future studies.  61

4.3.2 Impact of Climatic Locations  
  Based on simulation results, heating system with a lower RCL has a stronger impact on 

operation performance in Vancouver than in Toronto and Montreal.  Heating systems with RCL  of 0.7 were able to provide sufficient heating in Toronto and Montreal except during peak load  periods, but for Vancouver, it is unable to provide sufficient heating throughout the entire  heating season.  It is seemingly contrary that an undersized heating system creates a more  significant impact on indoor temperature for a location with warmer climate.  This  contradictory phenomenon is caused by the outdoor temperature compensator at the district  heating substation.    Recall that the secondary supply temperature is controlled by the outdoor temperature  compensator using the secondary supply temperature curve shown in Figure 5.  Because of the  warmer climate in Vancouver comparing to Toronto and Montreal, the outdoor temperature  compensator has a lower temperature setpoint for hot water supplied to radiator.  Figure 26  and 27 are plots of outdoor temperature and the corresponding secondary supply temperature  setpoint for Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.  It is observed that the district heating  substation supply a lower temperature to the secondary loop because of the higher outdoor  temperature in Vancouver.  The temperature difference between radiator supply temperature  and indoor temperature is the driving force for heat transfer between the secondary loop and  indoor environment.  As a result, the control system attempts to meet the required heating  load by increasing the secondary flow rate.  However, the water flow rate can only be increased  up to a limit in valves and pipes.  As observed in Figure 28, the secondary flow rate increases as 

68   

RCL increases, but it is not able to increase its flow rate beyond the limit of the thermostatic  radiator valve, at 0.42 kg/s.

To overcome this design problem, one can employ larger sized pipelines and valve to  allow higher flow.  An alternative method is to skew the secondary supply temperature curve,  for example, by 20% as shown in Figure 29.  This will increase the temperature difference and  thus, increase the heat transfer rate.   

 
Figure 29: Radiator system control curve based on outdoor temperature 

Simulation is performed to verify this solution, using a primary water supply  temperature of 70oC in Vancouver with a RCL of 0.7 for the heating equipment.  The results  indicate that indoor temperature can be properly maintained, as shown in Figure 30.  There are  zero IHD throughout the entire simulated, high load period.  The tradeoff is a much higher  primary flow rate and lower primary temperature drop, see Figure 31 and 32.  The average  decrease in primary water temperature drop is about 9oC.  Recall that previous study has 

71   

suggested that a T of 10oC in a district heating system can results in an approximately 55%  difference in required pumping power, and a fuel efficiency difference up to 14% [Persson,  2005].  Higher primary flow rate and lower primary water temperature drop are obviously not  desirable.  It is more favourable to equip a heating system with an appropriate RCL at the  design stage, or a system with high heat transfer area such as radiant floor heating.    This suggests that when designing heating systems connected district heating systems  for different climate, appropriate sizing and secondary supply temperature curve are important  to achieve desirable performance.  It should also be noted that by carefully changing operation  parameters, even an undersized heating system can still provide satisfactory indoor  temperature.

4.3.3 Impact of Primary Water Supply Modes 
In this section, the impact of three common primary water supply modes on the  performance of a residential singledetached house is investigated.  Note that the optimal  73   

primary water supply mode is largely dependent on the operation mode of the centralized  plant.  Typically, centralized production plant supplies water at a temperature range that would  yield the best production efficiency.  As a result, this analysis is not meant to determine the  optimal primary water supply mode for Canadian residential houses, but to obtain a better  understanding on how district heating endusers in Canada would perform under different  primary water supply modes.    Table 10 shows that heating systems with a RCL of 1.0 are able to maintain acceptable 

indoor conditions with all primary water supply modes, except for Montreal, where  underheating is observed with a primary supply mode C.  At RCL of 0.7, underheating was  observed to at all locations with primary supply mode C.  Based on the simulation results,  comparisons of indoor temperature profiles with different primary water supply modes at RCL  of 1.0 and 0.7 were generated and presented in Figure 33 and 34, respectively.  From the  figures, it was observed that primary supply mode A and B lead to similar indoor temperature  profiles for Toronto and Montreal, while indoor temperature profiles are consistent regardless  of primary supply temperature modes for Vancouver.  With a RCL of 0.7, the temperature  profile generated by primary supply mode C for Toronto and Montreal often falls outside the  acceptable range of comfortable indoor temperature (22±2oC).  Figure 35 shows the instantaneous heat transfer rate at the heat exchanger with RCL 1.0  and 0.7 with primary supply mode C for the model house in Toronto.  It can be observed that  even with an RCL of 1.0, primary supply mode C fails to meet heating demand.  The same can  be observed in Montreal as depicted in Figure 35.  With a lower primary water supply 

74   

temperature, the temperature drop across the heat exchanger at the district heating substation  is too low.  Therefore, primary supply mode C is not suitable for Toronto's and Montreal's  climate as it cannot provide sufficient heat transfer potentials at substations to meet heating  load demand.  Table 9 indicates that primary supply mode C provided a higher average primary water  temperature drop than primary mode A, which is not observed in the cases for Toronto and  Montreal.  This is because primary supply mode A adjusts the primary water supply  temperature according to outdoor temperature.  Figure 36 shows the primary water supply  temperature profiles with primary supply mode A and C.  It was observed that primary water  supply temperature with primary supply mode A is frequently below the primary water supply  temperature with primary supply mode C.  Nonetheless, both primary modes are able to  provide sufficient heating with heating systems at an RCL of 1.0.  Looking at their respective  primary flow rate in Figure 37, primary supply mode A provides a more stable profile  throughout the entire simulated period.  This may be more advantageous for pump operation  because it can allow pumps to more frequently operate at a range with higher efficiency.

4.4 Concluding Remarks 
In this chapter, the performance of a singledetached residential house is simulated at  three different climatic locations, five different ratios of capacitytoload, and three different  primary supply schemes.  Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the capability of the  simulation model developed. The operation and thermodynamic behaviour of district heating  substation, a residential singledetached house and its heating equipment are better 

79   

understood.  A total number of 45 simulation cases are performed.  The simulation results show  that:   A heating system with a larger RCL will results in a higher primary temperature drop,  reducing primary and secondary flow rate, without creating unacceptable indoor  temperature during high load period.     With a 30% increase in the size of heating equipment, OHD is increased by 56% and 25%  during intermediate season for Toronto and Montreal respectively.      When designing heating systems connected district heating systems for different  climate, suitable secondary supply temperature curve is important to achieve effective  performance.   Insufficient heating caused by an undersized heating system can be remediated by  changing the control parameters, for example, by skewing the radiator supply control  curve.  The tradeoff is a higher primary return temperature and higher primary and  secondary flow rate.  It is more desirable to accurately size heating system to maximize  primary T and reduce primary flow rate.   Primary water supply mode C (constant supply temperature at 70oC) is not suitable for  residential homes in Toronto and Montreal, which has a colder climate than Vancouver.   With this primary supply mode, heating system with a RCL of 0.7 fails to provide  satisfactory indoor temperature for all three climatic locations.   Primary water supply mode A is able to provide a more stable profile of primary water  flow rate.  This may be advantageous for pump operation optimization. 

80   



Having an oversized system may incur more OHD during low load period, but it can also  induce a lower average primary return temperature.  The simulation model developed is a useful tool that can be used to evaluate different 

design parameters and control strategies for a heat exchange terminal in different climatic  conditions, and with different size of buildings.  In the next chapter, the simulation model will  be used to evaluate a new control strategy on heat exchange terminal under the context of  Canadian's climate.

5. Improving the Performance of District Heating Substation  
5.1 Introduction 
In the previous chapter, the performance of a district heating substation connected to  residential singledetached house is simulated with different size of heating equipment and  primary supply schemes.  Through this work, the performance of a Canadian residential house  connected to district heating under different design and operation parameters is better  understood. In this chapter, a new control strategy is proposed to optimize the energy  performance of district heating system.  Using the simulation model, the proposed control  strategy is compared with conventional control method.  The objective is to quantitatively  evaluate the performance improvement of the new control strategy. 

5.2 Previous Researches 
Throughout the past decades, there have been many researches that had proposed  different approaches to optimize district energy system, for example, developing a  mathematical model to select primary supply water temperature for minimal operational costs  [Benonysson et al., 1995], using the thermal mass of the district heating system to adjust heat  output in order to enhance plant operation efficiency [Lin & Yi, 2000], energy optimization of  distribution pump operation [Indenbirken et al., 1995], improving the accuracy of predicting  primary loop transport delay [Zhao et al., 1995; Li & Zaheeruddin, 2004], using alternative fuel  type [Bahadorani et al., 2009; Nijjar et al., 2009] and using exergetic analysis [Ertesvag, 2007;  Snoek & Kluiters, 2010].  Many of these researches, however, used a perspective of the  centralized production plant, and used groups of large buildings as their study subjects.   82   

Li and Zaheeruddin (2007) had proposed the use of six different hybrid fuzzy logic  control strategies to regulate primary supply water temperature in a directcoupled district  heating system.  Simulation results indicated that, with the proposed hybrid fuzzy logic control  strategies, better zone temperature control in buildings is attained, distribution pumping cost is  decreased and up to 17% of energy saving can be achieved.    Xu et al. (2008) developed a simulation model using Matlab Simulink to extensively  study the control effectiveness of thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) in directcoupled district  heating systems.  The simulation includes a hydraulic model that considers the hydraulic  coupling between consumers.  Results showed that TRVs can significantly reduce overheating  phenomena caused by an excessive supply water temperature and radiator area.  However, it  could not eliminate the phenomena of overheating entirely.  It was suggested that low system  flow rate can easily leads to control difficulties of TRVs.  Control strategies of hourly and daily  adjustment on supply water temperature were proposed and simulated.  The idea is that the  change in system flow rate can be a good representation of changes in room temperature and  heating load.  This means that taking the change in system flow rate as feedback and adjusting  the supply water temperature can better accommodate the changes in the system head  demand and thus can keep the system flow rate within appropriate range.  Simulated results  shows that the proposed control strategies can reduce overheating degree, reduce pump  power consumption, and control the fluctuation range of the system flow rate within 50 to  100% of design flow rate, but it did not result in any evident difference in TRV control  effectiveness.  It is concluded that it is not necessary to adjust the primary supply water  temperature too precisely because of the inertia influence of the DHS and buildings.    83   

Performance improvement includes better controls of indoor environment.  Literature  had reported that it is common to observe unstable oscillation of indoor temperature at part  load conditions for homes using hydronic radiators [Tahersima et al., 2010, Andersen et al.,  2000].  To overcome this problem, an adaptive control that utilizes a controller gain scheduling  can be employed [Tahersima et al., 2010] or using an advanced pump control that estimates  the position of thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) so that it operates in a suitable area [Andersen  et al., 2000].  These studies, however, focused only on the elimination of temperature  oscillation and did not account for the energy consumption or return water temperature.   Many studies investigated the performance optimization of district heating substations  by focusing on minimizing primary return water temperature.  Zsebik and Sitku (2001) analyzed  different connection schemes of heat exchangers in a district heating substations and their  effects on return water temperature.  Gustafsson et al. (2010) proposed a new control strategy  to adjust the temperature setpoint of hot water supply to radiator based on primary supply  temperature.  Based upon simulation results, the proposed control strategy is able to achieve  up to 10% increase in primary water temperature drop.  When applied to all residential homes,  the proposed control strategy can achieved significant amount of collective savings.  The guidelines from Euroheat & Power (2008) stated that lower return temperature can  be obtained by varying system flow according to system loading.  Frederiksen and Wollerstrand  (1987) analyzed three different types of operation modes for district heating substations, and  discussed the idea of lowering radiator supply temperature and reducing water flow rate in the  secondary loop.  By reducing flow rate in the secondary loop, primary return temperature is 

84   

affected differently at low, medium and high heat load conditions.  At low heat load, primary  return temperature increases from reduced secondary flow rate.  At high heat loads, the  reduction in primary return temperature is depended strongly on the size of heat exchanger.   With an ordinarilysized heat exchanger, a secondary flow reduction is detrimental to the  primary return temperature.  In other literature, control of secondary flow rate by using  variable speed pump was proposed but was claimed to be difficult to predict and control with  varying pressure difference [Langendries, 1988; Petitjean, 1995].    Lauenburg and Wollerstrand (2010) presented a method of adaptive control of the  radiator system to obtain a lowest possible return temperature.  This idea originated from heat  exchangers and radiator systems are often oversized due to safety margins.  This fact renders it  possible to reduce return water temperature.  Lower return water temperature is achieved by  operating with an optimal combination of radiator circuit supply temperature and circulation  flow rate.  When determining the optimal combination of operation parameters, however, the  existing control system is not considered.  In other words, the constraints of the system on  controllable variables are not considered in determining the optimal operation parameters.    

5.3 Theory  
With the current control system, hot water temperature supplied to radiator is  regulated by the controller at district heating substation according to outdoor temperature.   With a terminal heat exchanger, there is regulation on the water temperature supplied to  radiator.  This results in less frequent secondary flow rate fluctuation and a more stable indoor  temperature when comparing to a directlycoupled district heating system.    

85   

Literature have suggested that choosing an appropriate combination of flow rate and  supply water temperature can lead to better operation performance of a district heating  system [Euroheat & Power, 2008; Lauenburg & Wollerstrand, 2010].  Figure 38 displays the  relationship between secondary supply temperature and secondary flow rate for a given system  under different outdoor temperature.  The curves show that a lower secondary supply  temperature can be used to satisfy a given heating demand with a higher secondary flow, and  vice versa.    Conventionally, the controller at the district heating substation does not control the  secondary flow rate.  The secondary flow is selfregulated by the TRV to maintain comfortable  indoor temperature.  Actively controlling both the secondary flow rate using a variable speed  pump and secondary supply temperature was shown to be difficult and added a great deal of  complexity to the control algorithm [Langendries, 1988; Petitjean, 1995].  From the simulation  study in the previous chapter, it was observed that the control curve of secondary supply  temperature can be adaptively adjusted to meet a given heat demand, and results with a  different secondary flow rate.  In other words, the secondary flow rate can be indirectly  manipulated by adjusting the secondary supply temperature control curve.      For a given heating demand, it may be more advantageous to operate with a higher  secondary flow rate and a lower secondary supply temperature.  Because a lower radiator  supply temperature can induce a larger temperature difference between primary supply  temperature and secondary supply temperature at the substation's heat exchanger, resulting in  a lower primary return temperature.  The hypothesis is that by adaptively adjusting the control 

86   

curve of secondary supply temperature according to secondary flow rate, a lower primary  water return temperature can be achieved. The underlying assumption is that the system has  the potentials for secondary flow rate to be increased.  This assumption is generally valid  because heating systems are designed for extreme climate conditions and should operate  frequently at conditions lower than their design conditions.  Based on the simulation results, it  was observed that the secondary flow rate is frequently operating at a value much lower than  the design value, shown in Figure 39.

5.4 Proposed Control Scheme 
In a conventional control scheme, the controller at the district heating substation  regulates secondary supply temperature based on outdoor temperature.  Figure 40 depicts the  conventional control scheme for the district heating substation.  The conventional control  scheme ensures that sufficient heating can be provided by the system when there is a sudden  increase in heating load due to a sudden decrease in outdoor temperature.  However, it does  not necessarily operate at a condition that maximizes primary water temperature drop.   

88   

Figure 40: Conventional control scheme of district heating substation and secondary loop 

It was hypothesized that by operating at a lower radiator supply temperature and a  higher secondary flow rate for a given heating demand, a lower primary return water  temperature can be achieved.  Therefore, the goal of the proposed control method is to  measure the secondary flow rate, and then to adaptively adjust the control curve of secondary  water supply temperature.   A control diagram of the proposed control method is displayed in  Figure 41. 

89   

 
Figure 41: Diagram of the new proposed control scheme 

The flow control actuator adjusts the control curve of secondary supply temperature  until a certain secondary flow rate is reached.  Based on a study by Xu et al. (2010), TRV works  within a comfortable range when the flow rate is 50 to 100% of its design value.  Therefore, the  secondary design flow rate is chosen to be the target value of the secondary flow rate used in  the flow control actuator.    Note that this does not mean that the system is operating at design conditions for  extreme climate.   When the system is operating at design conditions, both the secondary flow  rate and the secondary supply temperature operate at design values.

The control behaviour of the flow control actuator is described by Equation 40 and  displayed in Figure 42.   The constant K is set at 10 so that the maximum temperature  adjustment by the flow control actuator is 10oC.

5.5 Simulation Results and Discussion 
To evaluate the new control strategy, simulation was performed with various primary  supply temperature schemes to compare its performance against the conventional control  method.  Similar to the previous chapter, the first supply mode (supply mode A) is the  conventional supply temperature scheme, where primary hot water supply temperature varies  with the outdoor temperature, as shown in Figure 5.  The second supply mode (supply mode B)  uses a constant supply temperature at 100oC, which represents a constant high supply  temperature.  The third supply mode uses a constant supply temperature at 70oC (supply mode  C), which represents a constant low supply temperature.   Heating equipment are sized with a 

91   

RCL of 1.0, and climatic weather data of Toronto obtained from Canadian Weather for Energy  Calculations (CWEC) was used.  The simulations were run for the high load period.    Simulation results of primary temperature drop, secondary flow rate and indoor  temperature are presented in Figure 43 to 45, and the mean values are presented in Table 11.   Based on the simulated results, the new control scheme clearly shows that it increased the  primary    and lowered the primary return water temperature, in all primary supply modes  considered.  The indoor temperature remained stable with the new control scheme and is  consistent to the conventional control method.  The primary mass flow is also lowered by using  the new control strategy.  This means that more energy per unit volume of distributed water is  utilized, and distribution pump power can be reduced.

  An optimal heat transfer conditions requires a good combination of supply temperature  and flow.  The conventional control strategy operates with its only constraint being radiator  supply temperature.  As a result, flow condition is not optimized and results with energy waste  in primary return water.  The proposed control strategy devises a new algorithm that controls 

92   

the secondary flow by adaptively adjusting control curve of radiator supply temperature.  Using  the dynamic simulation model developed with realworld weather data, the new control  method shows that it can effectively satisfy heating demand with a lower secondary supply  temperature and a higher secondary flow rate.  The benefit of the new control method is that it  can decrease the primary return temperature meanwhile still maintaining stable indoor  temperature.  If this method is applied on a large scale throughout a district heating  community, the environmental and financial gains would be substantial.

5.6 Limitations 
  Most traditional radiator control systems utilized constant speed centrifugal pumps.   Very often, the secondary flow rate is not measured.  Adding a new flow sensor would be both  expensive and timeconsuming, especially considering that the new control method must be  applied in most substations across the district heating network to result in a collective  difference.  Most substation and radiator control systems are equipped with manometers to  monitor the system pressure.  When a constant speed centrifugal pump is employed, the  measured system pressure can be converted into flow rate, given that the system head curve is  known.  For variable or adjustable speed pumps, system pressure conversion is still possible,  but more complicated.      It is important to note that the current simulation model is a single zone model.  This 

assumption is not ideal because practically there are often multiple radiators equipped in a  residential house.  For a multizone model, hydraulic balancing should be considered in order to  account for the hydraulic pressure difference between different zones.  The physical modelling  of a hydraulic network is outlined by Xu et al. (2008).  Liao and Dexter (2004) had proposed a  simplified physical model for estimating the average air temperature in multizone heating  systems for control systems.  The performance of proposed control method should be  evaluated using a multizone model in future studies.

5.7 Concluding Remarks 
      A new control strategy for district heating substation is devised in order to reduce the 

primary return water temperature.  Conventional control strategy operates with its only  constraint being radiator supply temperature.  The new control scheme operates the system at  a more optimal combination of flow and supply temperature.  This is done by measuring the  secondary flow rate and then adaptively adjusts the control curve of the radiator supply  temperature.  Simulation results show that, by using the new control scheme, primary return  water temperature is lowered compared to the conventional control method, in all primary  supply modes considered.  The new control strategy can effectively regulate the secondary flow  rate so that it is closer to its design value during operation.  There is no detrimental effect  observed on indoor temperature with the new control method.  Collective saving can be  significant when the new control method applied to a community across the district heating  network.

6. Conclusions and Future Studies 
6.1 Conclusions 
A physical model was developed in Matlab Simulink to simulate the thermodynamic  behaviour of a district heating substation, a thermodynamic building and its heating equipment.   The simulation model provides a computational platform to evaluate design and operation  parameters, as well as control strategies for a district heating substation connected to a  hydronic heating system.    Using the simulation model, the performance of a district heating substation is  simulated at different capacity of heating devices, with different primary supply schemes, at  different climatic locations.  Simulation results show that oversized heating devices increased  overheating degrees during partload periods.  At the same time, oversized heating devices also  induced a larger primary water temperature drop.  This does not mean equipping a bigger size  heating system leads to better performance, because it increases overheating phenomena.  The  amount of increase in primary temperature drop is also bounded to diminish with larger size of  heating system.  Simulation results show that undersizing heating devices can leads to insufficient  heating phenomena, and this effect is much more severe for Vancouver's than for Toronto's  and Montreal's.  This is caused by the inappropriate secondary supply temperature curve of the  outdoor temperature compensator.   By modifying the secondary supply temperature curve,  indoor temperature can be properly maintained throughout the simulated period with under sized heating devices.  The tradeoffs are higher primary flow rate and a lower primary  99   

temperature drop.  When designing heating devices for different climatic locations, it is  important to use a suitable secondary supply temperature curve in order to achieve desirable  performance of district heating substation.    Based upon the knowledge generated from the simulation study, a new control strategy  is proposed by operating the system at a lower secondary supply temperature and a higher  secondary flow rate.  This is achieved by adaptively changing the secondary supply temperature  curve based on secondary flow rate.  The control strategy is evaluated using the simulation  model.  Simulation results show that a lower primary return temperature is obtained with all  three primary supply schemes considered.  By operating at a more optimal combination of  radiator supply temperature and secondary flow rate, energy saving is realized without  compromising indoor environmental conditions.  

6.2 Future Studies 
This thesis had focused on common and a limited amount of design and operation  parameters.  In reality, there exist infinite combinations of design and operation parameters.   There are many different heating devices that are commonly used and can be setup with  district heating, namely, forced air radiator, radiant floor system, heat pumps, etc.  Evaluation  of performance with different heating equipment can be remarkably beneficial and can  generate useful information for design and operation guidelines and energy saving strategies.   The physical modelling of new heating systems will require an extensive literature research and  may require experimental measurement.   

100   

According to a survey study performed, building occupants in Canada commonly  experience thermal discomfort due to their heating system being unable to maintain consistent  temperature across different zones [Ng K.L.R., 2010].  Control strategies for a multizone system  should be considered in future studies.  Hydraulic balance should be considered to account for  the hydraulic pressure difference between different zones.  The physical modelling of a  hydraulic network is outlined by Xu B. et al.  After a physical model is developed, a control  strategy is needed for the district heating substation to maintain the indoor conditions of  multiple zones.  Liao and Dexter (2004) had proposed a simplified physical model for estimating  the average air temperature in multizone heating systems.  The application of the model can  be applied to control the operation of district heating substation.

Appendix ­ Calculating Design Load using ASHRAE guidelines 
According to ASHRAE fundamentals  handbook, the calculation of design heating load  can be divided in the following:        Heat loss across exterior opaque surface  Heat loss across exterior transparent surface  Heat loss across the floor  Heat loss from infiltration  Heat load for ventilation  Distribution loss  The design data for the model house are obtained from ASHRAE fundamentals   Handbook, and are tabulated in Table 12.  The thermal resistance of different components of  the building envelope are tabulated in Table 13.  Using these values, the design heat loss across  the exterior surface of the building can be calculated using a steadystate 1dimensional heat  balance equation: 
   A1 

where,   qes is the heat loss across the exterior surface (W),   U is the overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m2 K),   A is the surface area (m2), and  T is the design temperature difference (oC).    102   

Studies have shown that heat loss from an unheated concrete slab floor is mostly through the  perimeter rather than through the floor and into the ground.  ASHRAE has outlined a simplified  approach to estimate slab heat loss through slab perimeter. 
   A2 

where,   = heat loss through perimeter (W),  Fp = heat loss coefficient per foot of perimeter (W/mK), and  p = perimeter of floor (m).  The heat loss coefficient per foot of perimeter for an insulated brick facing wall is  approximately 0.85. The design heat losses across different surfaces are tabulated in Table 14.

The heat loss via air infiltration can be calculated by the sets of equations listed below.   The typical values of constants for solving the equations below are obtained in 2005 ASHRAE  HandbookFundamentals, Chapter 27 and 28.  
qinfiltration =       Qi = ACH(V/3.6)       IDF        A6  A5  A4  A3 

where,   = air sensible heat factor (W/LsK) (equals to 1.23 at sea level),   = air volumetric flow rate via infiltration (L/s),  ACH = air exchange per hour (change/hr)  V = volume of the house (m3)  = building effective leakage area at reference pressure difference = 4Pa,  IDF = infiltration driving force (L/scm),   = building exposed surface area (m2), and   = unit leakage area (cm2/m2) (2.8cm2/m2 for average typical current housing). 

104   

To calculate the ventilation air flow rate from mechanical systems, one should note that  mechanical pressurization may modify the infiltration leakage rate.  To assess this effect, overall  supply and exhaust flow rates must be determined and then divided into "balanced" and  "unbalanced" components: 
Qbal = min(Qsup, Qexh)  Qunbal = max(Qsup,Qexh)Qbal  A7  A 8  

where,  Qbal = balanced airflow rate (L/s),  Qsup = total ventilation supply airflow rate (L/s),  Qexh = total ventilation exhaust airflow rate (L/s), and  Qunbal = unbalanced airflow rate (L/s).  The combined infiltration/ventilation flow rate is thus calculated as follows: 
Qvi = max(Qunbal, Qi+0.5Qunbal)  A9 

Equipment like exhaust fans that operate intermittently via manual control are generally not  included in load calculations.  With no heat recovery unit or energy recovery unit, the design  heat load for ventilation is calculated based on required minimum wholebuilding ventilation  rate outlined in ASHRAE Standard 62.22004 as:  
0.05 3.5 1   A10 

where,  

105   

 = required ventilation flow rate (L/s),   = building conditioned floor area (m2), and   = number of bedrooms (not less than 1).  Using Acf = 288.4m2 and Nbr =3, the resulting required ventilation flow rate is calculated and  presented in Table 15.  For design purposes, assume that this requirement is met by a  mechanical system with balanced supply and exhaust flow rates (Qunbal = 0) [ASHRAE, 2009].   The resulting combined infiltration/ventilation flow rate and heat load are summarized in Table  15.

Distribution losses are contributed by the duck work in the attic.  The distribution loss  factors are estimated from Table 6 of Chapter 29 of 2005 ASHRAE FundamentalHandbook at  0.12.  A summary of the model house total design heating loads is presented in Table 16.

The design heat transfer coefficient, and inlet and outlet temperature of heat  exchangers are based on the previous researches on detached residential home on district  heating by Gustafsson J. et al.  The design heat transfer coefficient is verified to be within the  range of a common watertowater heat exchanger [Holman J.P., 2002].  The design  specifications of heat exchangers are listed in Table 17.  The design secondary flow rate is  calculated by a 1D steadystate heat balance: 

·  

  A11 

where, 
design = design secondary flow rate (kg/s), 

qdesign = design power of heat exchanger (W),  Cp = heat capacity of water (J/kgK), and  Tsec = temperature drop of the secondary loop (K).  The design heat transfer area of the heat exchanger is calculated by the heat transfer equation: 

   

A12 

107   

where,  Adesign = design heat transfer area of heat exchanger (m2)  U = design heat transfer coefficient (W/m2K), and   = design log mean temperature difference (K).  Based on the two equations above, the design heat transfer area and secondary flow rate for a  singledetached residential home in Toronto are presented in Table 17.
