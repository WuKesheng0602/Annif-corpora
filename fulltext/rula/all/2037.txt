Abstract
Throughput Analysis of Opportunistic Channel Access Techniques in Cognitive Radio Systems
c Sivasothy Senthuran, 2012 Doctor of Philosophy Electrical and Computer Engineering Ryerson University In recent studies it was found out that previously allocated frequency spectrum is not fully utilized in all the wireless systems. Cognitive radio is the new concept to access this underutilized spectrum and, also a promising technology to cope with the ever increasing bandwidth demand for next generation wireless networks. Cognitive radio network can be classified into three different categories: interweave, underlay and overlay. In an interweave cognitive radio system, the unoccupied spectrum holes can be shared by cognitive users with minimal collision with primary users (spectrum owners) whereas in an underlay system, concurrent transmission is allowed with an interference threshold to the primary users. In an underlay system, cognitive users generally transmit at very low power. In an overlay system, cognitive users, similar to underlay cognitive radio systems, concurrently transmit with primary users but cognitive users may know the codewords of the primary transmitter. Hence, using that knowledge, cognitive transmitter may adopt different coding techniques to cancel/mitigate the interference at the primary receiver and/or it may assist the primary system by relaying primary user's data. In this thesis, we improve the throughput/bit error rate performance of a cognitive radio system by effectively accessing the channels. Throughout the thesis we assume that cognitive user can sense only one channel at a time and we analyze the performance with perfect and imperfect sensing. iii

First, we propose a novel opportunistic access scheme for cognitive radios in an interweave cognitive system, that considers the channel gain as well as the predicted idle channel probability (primary user occupancy: busy/idle). In contrast to previous work where a cognitive user vacates a channel only when that channel becomes busy, the proposed scheme requires the cognitive user to switch to the channel with the next highest idle probability if the current channel's gain is below a certain threshold. We derive the threshold values that maximize the long term throughput for various primary user transition probabilities and cognitive user's relative movement (Doppler spread). Then, we propose a three state Markov model to analyze the performance of a hybrid interweave-underlay system where the primary user's occupancy states are hidden, but their activity statistics, ranges of transmission, and interference thresholds are known. The primary user is assumed to be in one of the three transmission modes as seen by the cognitive user: busy, concurrent and idle. We derive the transmission mode selection criteria (interweave/underlay) to improve the long term throughput of a cognitive user based on the primary user traffic characteristics and the achievable throughput ratio between the two modes of operation. Later, we incorporate the sensing error in our analysis where we study the optimal access strategy. Since the optimal policy requires the channel to be sensed in each time-slot, we propose and analyze a forward algorithm based cross-layer frame based sensing policy. Finally, we focus on the overlay cognitive radio system where cognitive relay nodes assist the primary transmission. As an initial study, we select a two-hop decode-and-forward orthogonal frequency and code division multiplexing based relay network. For this system, we propose adaptive channel allocation and, power allocation strategies and the bit error rate performance is numerically evaluated. This preliminary analysis can be extended to overlay cognitive systems.

Chapter 1 Introduction
Wireless communication has become an integral part of human life. Recent exponential growth in the use of wireless phones has been attributed to the advances in device technology and applications development in addition to various communication technologies. One of them is the advent of cognitive radio technology.

1.1

Cognitive Radio System

The under-utilization of the scarce spectrum triggered the need for opportunistic spectrum sharing among mobile radio users recently [1]. Cognitive radio is one of the most promising technologies to cope with the ever increasing bandwidth demand for future generation wireless networks. Due to current non-dynamic allocation of wireless spectrum, it is severely under-utilized in TV transmission band and amateur radio band, and extremely crowded in consumer radio communications band [2]. Motivated by the FCC study in the USA, the cognitive radio networks have been incepted for the dynamic and opportunistic utilization of the under-utilized spectrum, where an opportunistic cognitive user (also known as secondary user) can reuse an unoccupied piece of spectrum (also called a spectrum hole) licensed to 1

a primary user temporarily. The users who own the spectrum (primary users) usually get higher access privilege while the cognitive users usually look for opportunistic access [3]. There are three types of cognitive radio systems : interweave, underlay and overlay. In an interweave cognitive radio system, the unoccupied spectrum holes should be shared by cognitive users with minimal collision with primary users whereas in an underlay system, concurrent transmission and the interference threshold to the primary users are the main concerns [4­8]. Similar to underlay cognitive radio system, cognitive user transmits simultaneously in the same band as the primary transmitter in an overlay cognitive radio system but cognitive user may know the code words of the primary transmitter. Hence, using that knowledge, cognitive transmitter may adopt different coding techniques to cancel/mitigate the interference at the primary receiver and/or it may assist the primary system by relaying its data. We will briefly discuss this classification in the following.

1.1.1

Interweave Cognitive Radio System

Interweave communication is the first concept evolved with cognitive radio communication. It was found during the initial study by FCC that most of the assigned spectrum is not fully utilized [9]. That is, there exist temporary time-frequency-space voids and can be opportunistically used by cognitive users. Opportunistically using those spectrum holes by the cognitive users without affecting the primary users is called interweave communication. In an interweave communication, cognitive users are prohibited to transmit while primary user is occupying that spectrum. In order to use the spectrum holes with minimal collision with primary users, cognitive users must sense the spectrum before using it. Cognitive users may use the primary users' spectrum occupancy statistics in addition to spectrum sensing in order to effectively utilize the spectrum holes. Cognitive user should be intelligent enough to

2

sense the wide spectrum and opportunistically use the spectrum holes for its communication with minimal interference to the primary users. We use interweave communication system model in chapter 2 and, in chapters 3 and 4, it is used as a part of the interweave-underlay hybrid system.

1.1.2

Underlay Cognitive Radio System

In underlay cognitive radio systems, cognitive users transmit in the presence of primary users with the knowledge of interference caused by the cognitive transmitter to primary receivers [3]. Even though the concurrent transmission is allowed in underlay cognitive radio system, interference threshold to the primary receiver is highly respected. Interference to the primary receiver can be minimized using directional antennae at the cognitive transmitter. In most cases, the cognitive transmitter spreads its power across wider bands so that the transmission causes acceptable level of interference to the primary receiver [2]. This technique is used in ultra-wide-band communication. Cognitive transmitter can estimate the interference to the primary receiver via channel reciprocity if it can overhear cognitive receiver's signal. It can also adopt a conservative transmission policy that may result in shorter range of communication. If there is a mechanism to broadcast periodically the primary receiver's interference level, it would be easier to adopt the transmission policy at the cognitive transmitter. A discussion on underlay communication and fundamental limitations in resource allocations can be found in [10, 11]. Underlay cognitive system model is used in chapter 3 with perfect sensing and in chapter 4 with sensing error along with interweave cognitive system model in this thesis.

1.1.3

Overlay Cognitive Radio System

In overlay communication, cognitive transmitter is assumed to know the code words of the primary transmitter so that cognitive user can transmit at the same time in the same band without affecting the primary receiver. Primary users' codebooks may be publicly available or communicated to the cognitive user by broadcasting. Cognitive user may detect the signal and adopt a transmission scheme, such as dirty paper coding, so that it can mitigate/cancel the interference at the primary receiver [3]. In some cases, cognitive transmitter assists the primary user transmission by relaying the primary user's data. Cognitive user may split the transmission power between its own transmission and in assisting primary user. In unlicensed bands, sharing the codebooks allows cognitive users to mitigate the interference. In licensed bands, they can use that knowledge to cancel the interference or in assisting the primary receiver. The overlay system model is used in the chapter 4.

1.1.4

Channel Sensing and Access

In order to reuse spectrum holes, a cognitive user must perform out-of-band sensing. If a spectrum hole is found, the cognitive user can use it for its data transmission. However, it needs to also conduct in-band sensing periodically so that it can vacate the acquired channel when the incumbent user re-appears. In IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Networks, primary users should be detected within two seconds of their reappearance with the sensing error probabilities no greater than 0.1 [12]. In order to avoid interference among multiple sensors and achieve reliable sensing, all the cognitive users should sense the channel during the quiet period. In the quiet period, all cognitive users should postpone their transmission so that any sensor monitoring the channel may observe the presence/absence of primary user signals without interference. Different physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC)

4

layer techniques for efficient sensing and accessing exist in the literature. In [13], a decentralized MAC protocol for ad hoc cognitive radio networks has been proposed that senses channel in each time-slot and takes opportunistic channel access decision. The authors in [14] extended the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) based optimal and myopic greedy suboptimal techniques of [13] for cooperative sensing cognitive radio networks. In [15], the authors studied the problem of designing the sensing slot duration to maximize the achievable throughput. A comparative study of energy detection and feature detection in-band spectrum sensing techniques in wireless regional area networks can be found in [12]. While above works consider that the primary user's state may be in one of the two states, namely, busy and idle, we consider a third state that a primary user may occupy, and have studied opportunistic access strategies for hybrid cognitive radio networks. An information theoretic perspective of three paradigms, namely, underlay, overlay and interweave, has been given in [3]. Motivated by the above studies, in this thesis, we study the channel access schemes in a cognitive radio system in all three forms of cognitive radio systems.

1.2

Thesis Contribution

The key contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows: We considered a cognitive radio system where a cognitive user can sense only one primary channel at a time. For that system, we propose and analyze different channel access schemes. In an interweave cognitive radio system, cognitive user looks for an spectrum hole to access that primary channel. Based on the primary user occupancy statistics, cognitive user selects the best channel to sense, and if that is vacant then cognitive user can occupy the channel. We first propose an channel access/switching strategy based on the primary user occupancy 5

statistics as well as the cognitive user's received signal to noise ratio in a Rayleigh fading channel. Hence, we developed and analyzed an effective channel access strategy for a system with two primary channel as well as multiple channels. Based on the analysis, effective throughput of a cognitive user can be increased by implementing the proposed strategy. Further, in a cognitive radio system, there are opportunities to access the spectrum in underlay or interweave modes. Hence, there is need for an effective access strategy for selecting the best mode of transmission. We propose a three state Markov framework to analyze the interweave-underlay mode of transmission. Based on the primary user traffic characteristics and effective throughput ratio between the two mode of transmissions, optimal channel access strategy is proposed, analyzed and verified through simulations. In practice, there is uncertainty in sensing. Therefore, we incorporated the sensing error in the above interweave-underlay cognitive radio system to find an optimal access strategy. The problem is formulated as finite-horizon POMDP and the optimal solution technique is given using incremental-pruning algorithm that optimizes the throughput and avoids the interference to primary users. We studied the throughput and collision performance analysis via simulation for different primary user occupancy characteristics. Finally, we considered the overlay cognitive radio system where cognitive relay nodes assist the primary user transmission. In our study, we considered an orthogonal frequency and code division multiplexing (OFCDM) based decode-and-forward relay and we propose an adaptive channel (OFCDM subcarrier) allocation scheme to improve the system throughput based on the primary and cognitive user links (channel gains). The analysis mainly focuses on the performance of the cognitive relay assisted primary user throughput. At system level, the optimal power allocation between the primary user and cognitive relay is also analyzed. Most of the works reported in this dissertation can be found in peer reviewed research publications [16­23]. chapter 2 appeared in [16, 17]. The work of chapter 3 can be found 6

in [18, 19]. The work in chapter 4 can be found in [20] and chapter 5 in [21­23].

Figure 1.1: Chapter organization. The thesis is organized as follows: In chapter 2, we propose and analyze a channel access scheme for a cognitive user that operates in an interweave system, based on the traffic characteristics of the primary system and Doppler spread of the cognitive user. Throughput performance is analytically evaluated and verified via simulations. In chapter 3, the above work is extended to hybrid interweave-underlay cognitive radio system. In this chapter, we propose a three state model for the analysis and study the transmission mode selection with channel access in a hybrid underlay-interweave cognitive 7

radio systems based on cognitive user throughput ratio between underlay and interweave transmission modes and the primary user traffic statistics while cognitive user can sense only one channel. Again the analytical work is verified with simulation. The chapter 3 work is extended to a system with sensing error in chapter 4. In this chapter, we study the channel access and power adaptation techniques for a hybrid interweaveunderlay cognitive radio system. We first study the optimal channel access and power adaptation strategy by formulating the problem as a finite-horizon POMDP. The optimal solution technique is given using incremental-pruning algorithm that optimizes the throughput and avoids the interference to primary users. Since the optimal algorithm requires channel to be sensed in every time-slot, we propose a novel cross-layer forward algorithm based technique that updates the state belief using spectrum sensing result in the first time-slot and then using positive/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NAK) information of the previous time-slot (obtained from data link layer) in the rest of the frame. We study the throughput and collision performance results via simulation for different cases of primary user channel mixing rates and error occurrence both in sensing and in feedback. Chapter 5 presents the channel and power allocation of an overlay cognitive radio system. In this chapter, we first propose an adaptive channel allocation algorithm for a two-hop decode-and-forward OFCDM based cognitive relay system and then its performance is formulated and numerically evaluated via Monte-Carlo simulation. The effect of considering the CSI of source-base station and source-cognitive relay links are evaluated in an overlay cognitive radio system. In addition to that, different power allocation schemes between the source and the cognitive relay nodes are analyzed and numerically evaluated for a two-hop decode-and-forward OFCDM based cognitive relay network. The contributions of this dissertation is summarized in chapter 6. In addition, the future research directions relevant to the works in this thesis are discussed. 8

Chapter 2 Channel Access in Interweave Cognitive Radio System
Opportunistic communication over fading channels is a well studied subject where the adaptive radio resource allocation and multiuser selection in transmission often exploit the channel fading characteristics [24]. The limited frequency spectrum and under-utilization of the assigned spectrum triggered the need for opportunistic spectrum sharing [1] among users. The users who own the spectrum get higher access privilege, and the opportunistic users (also known as cognitive users) usually look for opportunistic channel access. In an interweave cognitive radio system, the unoccupied spectrum holes should be shared by cognitive users with minimal collision [2]. That is, an effective sensing scheme should be used to find the vacant channels in order to avoid collision. There are many spectrum sensing algorithms proposed in the literature with different techniques [25]. The objective of a channel access scheme is to maximize the long-term throughput of a cognitive user with minimal interference to the primary users. In [26], multi-channel opportunistic sensing was proposed where a cognitive user senses the channel before the

9

access and the cognitive user is limited to sense only one channel at a time. This problem is treated as partially observable Markov decision process for generally correlated channels and their proposed optimal access scheme is intractable and computationally complex. A simple myopic access scheme was proposed in [27, 28] and it was designed to maximize the throughput of each slot neglecting the impact on the future potential throughput. Hence, this myopic scheme was modeled as a static optimization problem rather than a sequential decision making process. It was not only simple and robust, but also proved to be optimal under the i.i.d. Gilbert-Elliot channel model [29]. It was proposed in [28] that a cognitive user senses the most probable idle channel in each slot, and if primary user's traffic is positively correlated, the cognitive user occupies that channel until it becomes busy, i.e., until the primary user starts to use that channel. In that work, the channel fading characteristic was not considered; hence, even if the cognitive user occupies a weak channel, it will stay with that channel until it becomes busy. There could be other channels with good channel gains that are potentially idle for use by cognitive users. This motivates us to investigate a new channel switching strategy in cognitive radio systems. In this chapter, a channel switching scheme based on the primary user channel occupancy statistics as well as the cognitive user's received signal to noise ratio (SNR) is proposed, analyzed and verified for a cognitive radio system. Rather than staying in a channel when the cognitive user's received SNR goes below a threshold, a cognitive radio switches to the channel with the next highest idle probability to improve the throughput. Following the formulation of this channel switching problem, optimal switching thresholds that maximize the long term throughput of the cognitive radios are analytically found for different primary users' traffic characteristics using a Markov chain model. Our contributions in this chapter can be summarized as follows:

· Analytically evaluating the throughput performance of a cognitive user with channel switching for different traffic characteristics of primary users and the relative motion (Doppler spread) of cognitive users. · Proposing an opportunistic channel switching algorithm and analytically obtaining the optimal channel switching threshold for an interweave cognitive radio system. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2.1 describes the system model under consideration. Section 2.2 analyzes the performance of the proposed interweave access scheme with two primary channels and a system with multiple primary channels is analyzed in Section 2.3. Finally, the chapter is summarized in Section 2.4.

2.1

Interweave System Model

We assume that there are many primary user channels, and one cognitive user pair tries to access an idle channel. Also, we assume that a cognitive user can sense/access only one channel during a time slot and occupies that channel if it is idle; otherwise, it waits for the next time slot. After each sensing, the cognitive user updates the belief vector (O ) of the primary user occupancy as given in (2.1). If the first slot is idle, then it will transmit in that slot and updates the belief vector (H ) of the cognitive user's received SNR. During the next time slot, if that current channel's primary user occupancy and cognitive user's SNR prediction are favorable, then the cognitive user will sense the same channel. Otherwise, based on the primary users occupancy prediction (O ), the cognitive user will switch the sensing to the most probable idle channel other than the current channel. The primary user's occupancy state prediction and received SNR state prediction models are explained in subsection 2.1.1 and subsection 2.1.2 respectively.

11

In this work, the initial analysis is done for a system that has two identical but independent primary channels and one cognitive user that tries to opportunistically occupy a primary user channel as shown in Fig. 2.1.

2.1.1

Channel Occupancy State

We use a multi-channel cognitive radio system to develop our access scheme. There are N independent, stochastically identical slotted channels, each of which is modeled using a two state Markov chain [29] as in Fig. 2.2. The busy and idle state of the channel are denoted with State B and State I respectively. The transition probability of this Markov chain is denoted by {Pqr }q,r=B,I . PII denotes the probability that a channel becomes idle in the next time slot given that it is idle during the current slot. PBI denotes the probability that a channel becomes idle given that the channel is currently busy; that is, the probability that a primary user leaves the channel during the next time slot after occupying the current slot. The idle probability of channel i (O i ) is updated after each slot based on the sensing outcome [26]. That is,

Case 3 denotes that at time t, the channel i is not selected for sensing. The cognitive user communicates opportunistically by using the idle channels of the primary users. The primary user channel state (busy or idle) predication is incorporated with our channel switching strategy. When PII >PBI , the probability of an idle channel (State I ) during the current slot becoming idle in the following slot (PII ) is higher than that of a busy channel (State B ) becoming idle (PBI ). Therefore, when a cognitive user senses a channel as idle and when PII >PBI , it is better to transmit during that slot and stay in that channel, since there is a higher probability that the channel will become idle during the next time slot. On the other hand, when PBI >PII , the probability of an idle channel during the current slot becoming idle in the following slot (PII ) is lower than that of a busy channel becoming idle (PBI ). Therefore, when a cognitive user senses a channel as idle and when PBI >PII , it is better to transmit during that slot and move out of that channel in the next slot, since there is a higher probability that the channel will become busy during the next time slot. The steady state probability if State I and State B can be written as PI = PBI /(PBI + PIB ) and PB = 1 - PI respectively. 13

2.1.2

Channel Gain State

In a rich multipath propagation environment, the instantaneous received signal amplitude is commonly modeled with the Rayleigh distribution. A slowly varying Rayleigh channel can be modeled as a finite state Markov channel [30] by partitioning the received SNR, which is proportional to the squared of the received signal amplitude, into a finite number of K nonoverlapping states. As mentioned in [31], this first order Markov model accurately models the practical fading channel for packet/block level communication when the block length is sufficiently large. Let h be the normalized SNR at the receiver when the transmitter power is Ppower . The pdf of h is exponentially distributed and can be written as (cf. [32]), where h0 is the average received SNR. p(h) =
h -h 1 0 e h0

, for h  0;

(2.2)

Let PHl and PHh denote the steady state probabilities associated with states Hl and Hh respectively. Hence, PHl =
 0   p(h)dh = 1 - exp(- h ) and PHh = exp(- h ). 0 0

We assume that the Rayleigh fading channel is slow enough so that the received SNR remains within the certain state for the duration of a block.

14

The transition probability, PHl Hh from state Hl to state Hk is approximated by the ratio of the expected number of level crossings at the received SNR (), and the average transmission rate in state Hl . Similarly, the transition probability, PHh Hl from state Hh to state Hl is approximated by the ratio of the expected number of level crossings at the received SNR  and the average transmission rate in state Hh . Let the number of blocks per second of the block-fading channel be RB , so the average number of blocks/second during which the
l channel is in state Hl is RB = PHl RB [33]. Therefore, the crossover transition probabilities

can be written as, P Hl Hh  and similarly, P Hh Hl  N () , h RB N () , l RB

where N () is the expected number of times per second the received SNR passes downward across the corresponding threshold  and is given by, N () = 2  fm e h0

.

In this expression, fm = v/ is the maximum Doppler frequency, where v is the speed of the mobile terminal and  is the wavelength of the radio wave. The transition probability of staying in the same state can be found as, PHl Hl = 1 - PHl Hh and PHh Hh = 1 - PHh Hl . Average channel capacity (RHh ) in state Hh (assuming unit bandwidth) can be calculated as follows:

The probability of a channel i being in state Hh (H i )is updated after each slot based on the sensing outcome. That is,     P Hh Hh , Case 1 ;    H P Hl Hh , Case 2 ; i (t + 1) =      H  H i (t)PHh Hh + (1 - i (t))PHl Hh , Case 3 ,

where Case 1 and Case 2 denote that at time t, the channel i is selected for sensing and it is sensed as idle. During the transmission it is found that the channel is state Hh and Hl respectively. Case 3 denotes that at time t, the channel i is not selected for sensing or sensed as busy.

2.1.3

Channel Access Scheme

As mentioned earlier, our proposed access scheme incorporates prediction of the primary user occupancy state and SNR of the cognitive user. Therefore, even when the current channel has higher probability to become idle during the next time slot, if the cognitive user's predicted SNR is below a threshold (), then the cognitive user switches the sensing

16

to the other channel to potentially improve the throughput in the proposed scheme. The cognitive user switches the channel for sensing due to the following two cases: i) Case 1: The cognitive user's predicted SNR of the current channel for the next slot is lower than the threshold () or, ii) Case 2: The cognitive user senses that the channel is busy (when PII >PBI ) or idle (when PBI >PII ) during the current slot. The proposed channel access scheme is described as follows: (See Fig. 2.4 for corresponding flow chart):

1. Initially the idle probability for all the channels is set to their steady state probability (PBI /(PBI + PIB )), if not known. 2. Select the most (or second most, from step 4) probable idle channel (arg max O i (t)) and sense. Update the occupancy belief (2.1) 3. If it is available, occupy that channel (transmit and update the channel gain belief (2.4)) during that slot else go to step 2 and wait for the next slot. 4. During the transmission if the corresponding received SNR is above a specified threshold, go to step 2 and sense the most probable idle channel or else sense the second most probable idle channel.

We consider in the following sections that primary user's occupancy and cognitive user's received SNR are positively correlated. That is, PII > PBI and PHh Hh > PHl Hh . In that case, the algorithm will be simplified as follows: 17

1. Sense the channel, if it is idle (State I ) transmit during that slot and go to step 2 else switch1 the channel and wait for the next slot to sense again (step 1) 2. During the transmission if the received SNR is in State Hh , stay in that channel and go to step 1 else switch the channel and go to step 1

2.2

Two-Channel System

In this section, we analyze a cognitive radio system with two primary channels. As we mentioned in subsection 2.1.3, if the predicted SNR is low or the predicted occupancy state is busy, then cognitive user will switch the channel. We combine occupancy state transition (shown in Fig. 2.2) channel gain transition (shown in Fig. 2.3) into a four state model in

Figure 2.5: Sensing cycle: One cognitive user accesses the primary user channels when PII > PBI . Cognitive user switches the channel either due to, the current sensed channel is in busy state or the predicted SNR of the current channel for the next slot is lower than the specific threshold. this chapter and assume these notations PIB = , PBI =  , PHh Hl =  and PHl Hh =  . The combined transition matrix can be defined using four states IHh , IHl , BHh and BHl and denoted by 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 respectively. The combined transition matrix TC can be defined as, 1 (IHh ) 2 (IHl ) 3 (BHh ) 4 (BHl )

(2.5)

A cognitive user may leave a channel if, either the occupancy state of the channel is busy (3 ) or the predicted SNR during the next slot is low (2 ) or both (4 ). If the channel is in state 1 , cognitive user may stay in that channel. For the analysis purpose, we model the problem into nine different states based on the last state of the current channel and previous channel as in Table 2.1. Based on the state classification, the state transitions possibilities can be derived as in (2.6).

We do the analysis based on the above nine states. Each of these nine states can be divided

continuously in a channel in state SK (K =1,2,3,..,9.). Fig. 2.6 shows the channel switching between two channels and its state transitions. For example, consider the following scenario. At time t=3, a cognitive user switches the channel from Channel B to Channel A, as Channel B was in State 3 . It again switches back to Channel B as it finds the state of the Channel A as 4 . We consider this one slot stay (at t=4) of the cognitive user in Channel A. The state of the last slot of the current channel (Channel A, t=4) is 4 and previous channel (Channel B, t=3) is 3 , from Table 2.1. Then, we can decide the state of that stay as S8 .
1 Further, as the cognitive user stayed for only one slot, that stay is denoted by S8 . Similarly,

if we consider the three slots stay in Channel B (t=10 to t=12), cognitive user is leaving the channel B during the current visit at t=12 as it is in State 2 and cognitive user left previous
3 channel (Channel A, t=9) as it was in State 3 , then that stay is denoted by S7 .

for n slots continuously and then moves to State SK2 and stays for m slots before leaving that channel. In Fig. 2.6, cognitive user moves from Channel A to Channel B at t=4 with

the channel after staying for one slot and the state of that channel is 3 (Channel B, t=5)
1 from Table 2.1. As the cognitive user stayed only one slot in the Channel A (S8 ) during the

last channel switch, the transition probability can be written as T3 2 . That is, T3 2 denotes the transition probability from State 3 to State 2 after two slots and it can be found from
1 4 (2.5). Similarly, at t=5, the cognitive user switches from State S4 to S9 . That implies, the

cognitive user left the Channel A in the previous visit when the last slot was 4 and stayed one slot in Channel B, then switched back to Channel A and stays for four slots and leave the channel as it is in State 3 .

The cognitive user switches a channel in the states S1 , S4 and S7 only because of the predicted SNR is low even though the channel is idle (2 ). Therefore, a cognitive user may transmit during that last slot and leave that channel. On the other hand, cognitive user leaves the other states as the primary channel is busy. Hence, cognitive user will not transmit during the last of those six states. The last slot throughput can be written as,


C1 = RHl

and during the other slots, gain state of the channel would be higher. Hence, throughput (for L > 2) can be written as,

Similarly for different scenarios, we can find the optimal channel switching strategy.

Multi-Channel system

In this section, we analyze the performance of a cognitive radio system with multiple primary user channels. We assume that there are more than N (> 2) primary channels and a cognitive user can access any channel if it is not occupied by the primary user. As we consider the round robin access, if there are enough channels, the state of the first slot of a channel that 29

the cognitive user accessed long time back will have steady state probabilities after few time slots. That assumption made the analysis simpler compare to the two channel case

2.3.1

Steady State Analysis

As we consider channel occupancy state (B or I ) and SNR state (Hl or Hh ), the first slot can be in any combination. If the sensed channel is busy (B ), or idle (I ) with lower SNR (Hl ), the cognitive user will leave that channel. In that case, it is considered as cognitive user stayed only one slot (L = 1) in that channel (Fig. 2.5(a)). If that channel is in busy state, without transmission, cognitive user will switch the channel. If that channel is idle but with lower SNR, with probability PI PHl /(PB + PI PHl ), it will transmit during that slot and leave that channel right after. Probability of success in accessing the first slot (f s) of a primary channel can be written, using the steady state probabilities, as Pf s = PI PHh . Therefore, if cognitive user stays only one slot, the reward can be written as RL=1 = (1 - Pf s ) P I P Hl RHl , P B + P I P Hl

where RHl denotes the reward (throughput) during the low SNR (State Hl ) transmission. When sensing, if the channel is idle (I ) and having higher gain (Hh ), then cognitive user will transmit and will stay in that channel to sense during the next time slot. Probability of staying in the same channel during the next slot (ns) can be written as Pns = PII PHh Hh and probability of leaving a currently occupied channel can be written as (1 - Pns ). When the cognitive user stays L (> 1) number of slots, it may leave the channel when the channel occupancy state becomes busy or the SNR state becomes Hl (Fig. 2.5(b)). If a cognitive user leaves the channel due to busy state, it will not transmit in the last slot. Hence, the reward during the last slot can be written, considering one slot before the last

30

slot was in state I with Hh , as: RLastSlot = PII PHh Hl RHl . PIB + PII PHh Hl

Therefore, if a cognitive user stays in a channel for L(> 1) slots, the reward can be written as, R = (1 - Pf s ) P I P Hl RHl + Pf s P B + P I P Hl PII PHh Hl 1 RHh + RHl . 1 - Pns PIB + PII PHh Hl (2.30)

2.3.2

Analytical Results and Discussion

In this section, we present and discuss the throughput performance of the proposed access scheme for a cognitive radio system with multiple primary channels. The proposed channel switching scheme provides the optimal channel switching threshold for a given traffic characteristics of primary users and the relative motion (Doppler spread) of cognitive user given that cognitive user can sense only one channel. The cognitive user's throughput performance for different channel switching thresholds is shown for different primary user occupancy statistics. For Doppler spread fm = 20Hz, PBI = 0.1 and PIB = 0.1, the optimal channel switching threshold,  = 2.6, can be found in Fig. 2.9. That is, when the received SNR is below 2.6, it is better to switch the channel for long term throughput benefit even the current channel is in idle state. Also we can find that  = 2.8 when PBI = 0.5. In a positively correlated primary user traffic, the cognitive user leaves a channel when it finds that channel is in State B. When a cognitive user switches the channel, it expects that the channels were in busy state during its previous visit may be in idle state after few slots. If the channel's PBB is higher, there is lower probability that the switched channel will be in idle state compared to the channel with lower PBB . Therefore, it is better to stay in the same channel if it is idle even the predicted SNR is not good. We can observe in Fig. 2.9 that when PBI decreases (or PBB increases) the channel switching 31

threshold also decreases. That is, the access scheme encourages the users to stay in the same channel if it is idle even the predicted SNR is not good for the long term throughput advantage when PBB increases (PBB = 1 - PBI ).

When the Doppler spread increases, the SNR prediction is not reliable and hence, the channel switching threshold decreases. That is, in a dynamic environment the channel switching based on the channel gain is discouraged for the long term throughput benefit of the cognitive user. We can observe that in Fig. 2.11 for PBI = PIB = 0.1, when Doppler spread fm increases from

Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we analyzed a channel access scheme for a cognitive user that operates in an interweave system, based on the traffic characteristics of the primary system and Doppler spread of the cognitive user. In a positively correlated primary user traffic, the cognitive user switches the channel either when the sensed primary channel is busy or predicted SNR is below a specific threshold. It is found that, when the primary user traffic is highly correlated (higher PBB and PII ) or cognitive user is more dynamic (higher fm ), it is not beneficial to switch the channel frequently in order to gain long term throughput advantage. For given statistics about primary user traffic, an optimal channel switching threshold can be found 33

Chapter 3 Channel Access in Interweave-Underlay Cognitive Radio System with Perfect Sensing
In the last chapter, we studied the performance of an interweave cognitive radio system where we showed that a cognitive radio can switch the channel sensing for possible transmission and hence improve throughput based on primary user traffic characteristics. In reality, the cognitive user may get opportunity to transmit both in interweave and underlay modes of transmission in future wireless systems [3]. Therefore, in this chapter, we evaluate the throughput performance of a cognitive user in both transmission modes and develop a framework for the transmission mode selection. Our contributions in this chapter can be summarized as follows: · Proposing a new analytical study on transmission mode selection with channel switching in hybrid underlay-interweave systems based on cognitive user throughput ratio between underlay and interweave transmission modes (RU /RI ) and the primary user 35

traffic statistics (T ) while cognitive user can sense only one channel, · Developing a three-state Markov framework to analyze such a hybrid mode of transmission for a positively correlated primary user traffic, · Analytically deriving the optimal thresholds for transmission mode selection considering throughput performance of a cognitive user and, · Showing both analytically and via simulation that proper transmission mode selection can provide up to 8% throughput advantage in hybrid cognitive radio networks. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.1 describes the system model under consideration. Section 3.2 analyzes the performance of the proposed hybrid system and results are given in Section 3.3 Finally, the chapter is summarized in Section 3.4.

3.1

Interweave-Underlay System Model with Perfect Sensing

In this work, the initial analysis is done for a system that has two identical but independent primary channels and one cognitive user that tries to opportunistically occupy a primary user channel as shown in Fig. 3.1. The detailed system description of primary and cognitive users are given in the following subsections.

3.1.1

Primary User

In a cognitive radio network, the cognitive users use the primary channels opportunistically. We classify the state of a primary user channel into three states in the view of a cognitive user. They are: 36

PU SU PU
Channel X Channel Y

PU: Primary user SU: Secondary user

PU PU SU

Figure 3.1: System model (2 primary user channels and 1 cognitive user pair). 1. The channel is not being used by the primary user and hence the channel is said to be idle. The cognitive user can opportunistically use that channel and its state is denoted by State I (idle). 2. The primary user occupies the channel and the cognitive user occupancy will cause interference to the primary user. Since the primary users get higher priority, the cognitive users are not allowed to use that channel. This state of the channel is denoted by State B (busy). 3. In few instances (where the interference caused by the cognitive users to the primary user is below a certain threshold), cognitive users are allowed to share the channel with primary users. In that case, both primary and cognitive users share the channel but cognitive user transmits with low power. Hence, the data rate would be lower. This channel state is denoted by State U (similar to underlay). Therefore, we use a three state Markov chain to model each primary user channel as shown in Fig. 3.2. The states are defined for a single primary user channel as summarized below: · State I : The channel is idle and it can be occupied by the cognitive user.

37

· State B : The channel is occupied by the primary user and no cognitive user can share this channel. · State U : The channel is occupied by the primary user but it can be used by the cognitive user with low transmit power. The transition probability from State B to State I is denoted by PBI . Similarly, other transition probabilities are denoted. The corresponding transition matrix is given by,

3.1.2

Cognitive User

The cognitive user is not having any pre-assigned channels to transmit and it uses the primary channels opportunistically. During the interweave (when the state is idle) transmission, the 38

cognitive user gains throughput advantage compared to the underlay transmission as it can transmit at maximum power. The cognitive user makes the transmission strategy based on the state and traffic characteristics of the primary users as well as the throughput ratio between the interweave and underlay transmissions. In this section, we consider the following two transmission strategies. 1. Strategy A: cognitive user occupies the primary user channel when the channel is in either State I (idle) or in State U (share with the primary user with lower data rate). 2. Strategy B : cognitive user occupies the channel only when it is idle (State I ) (no co-existence with the primary user). We assume that the cognitive user can sense only one channel at a time. Therefore, cognitive user does not know the states of the other channels when cognitive user senses one channel, but it can predict the states of the other channels based on the previously sensed data and the state transition probabilities of the primary user using the Bayes rule [28]. The state of a channel k at time slot t is denoted by Sk (t) and the channel sensed during the time slot t is denoted by a(t). The predicted state probability of a channel k (k=1,2 for two channel system), during the time slot t, being in State B, State I and State U are denoted by k (t), kI (t) and kU (t) respectively. They can be calculated as follows, B    a(t)=k , Sa(t) (t)=B ;  PBX ,       PIX , a(t)=k , Sa(t) (t)=I ; kX (t + 1) =    a(t)=k , Sa(t) (t)=U ; PU X ,        (t)P +  (t)P +  (t)P , a(t)=k . kB BX kI IX kU UX where X  {B, I, U }, PBU = 1 - PBB - PBI , PIU = 1 - PIB - PII , PU U = 1 - PU B - PU I and kB (t) + kI (t) + kU (t) = 1.

39

We also assume that, based on the sensing result and predefined interference threshold, cognitive user decides whether to share the channel with primary user or not. Let S be the sensed power level, and O and U (> O ) be the sensed power thresholds for interweave and underlay (sharable) modes respectively. All these parameters are defined at the cognitive transmitter. Primary receiver interference threshold is denoted by S . The detail operational descriptions are stated in the subsection 3.2.3. · If S > U , then no transmission is allowed. · If S < O , then interweave mode of transmission. The interweave threshold is tighter to protect primary user transmission during time slots (with the acceptable tolerance of mis-detection and false alarm). During that slot, cognitive user will operate with its full power to gain maximum throughput. · If O < S < U , then underlay mode of transmission. Underlay threshold is little compromised to allow for limited cognitive user transmission. When the cognitive user finds that the sensed power level is above the interweave threshold but safely below the underlay threshold, then it will transmit with lower power to gain some throughput. Hence, based on the sensing result of the primary user's signal and the predefined thresholds, the cognitive user decides whether the primary user channel is in state U or B [34] [35]. The cognitive user's behaviour is analyzed using a Markov chain where each state represents the length of the continuous stay of a cognitive user in terms of time slots (L = 1, 2, 3, . . .) before switching to another channel. It is shown in Fig. 3.3, where Pnm denotes the transition probability of cognitive user for staying in a channel for L = n slots and switching to the other channel for L = m slots. The probability of staying in a channel for a consecutive L slots is written as PL . Note that each primary user channel is modeled as in Fig. 3.2 and each cognitive user's stay in a channel is modeled as in Fig. 3.3. 40

Figure 3.3: Markov chain model for the cognitive user: states represent the length (L) of the stay of a cognitive user in a channel continuously. In the literature, for a two state case (B or I), the analysis was done for positively and negatively correlated primary user traffic . The positively correlated primary user traffic implies that PBB > PIB . A myopic strategy was proposed in [28] as, in positively correlated traffic, the cognitive user switches the channel when it senses the primary channel as busy; and in negatively correlated traffic, the cognitive user stays in that channel when it senses the channel as busy. Cognitive user does the opposite when it senses as idle. In our case with three states, we consider a scenario in which the primary user traffic is positively correlated with time. That is, when a primary user occupies a channel, it stays in that channel for few slots (PBB > {PIB or PU B }). Hence, if the currently sensed channel is busy, then the predicted state of that channel during the next slot will be busy with higher probability. In that case, the cognitive user prefers to switch the channel expecting to transmit in the other channel. In a negatively correlated traffic, it would be other way. That is, the cognitive user may find it beneficial to stay in that channel without any transmission when the sensed slot is busy and it will wait for the next slot hoping that the primary user may vacate that channel. We believe that positively correlated primary user traffic represents a more common case of a stable system with enough data at primary user for transmission. Therefore, we assume that cognitive user switches the channel when it senses the primary channel as busy in the analysis. The detailed operational details are given in Section 3.2.3.

Throughput Analysis

As mentioned earlier, the analysis is done for a two-primary user channel system with one cognitive user. The objective is to maximize the throughput of a cognitive user without affecting the primary users. We assume that the cognitive user has enough data to transmit continuously and it looks for a better selection of a primary user channel to transmit its data. The critical decision for a cognitive user is whether to stay in a channel and transmit at a lower rate or, leave that channel and sense the other channels when the currently sensed channel is in State U. The other channel can be in one of the three states. If it is in State I, then the switching would be beneficial. If it is in the State B, then it would reduce the throughput.

3.2.1

Strategy A: Cognitive access with simultaneous channel sharing

In this strategy, the cognitive user occupies a channel when it is in State I (idle) or State U (coexistence with primary user). When the channel state becomes State B, cognitive user leaves that channel without transmitting as we assume that primary user traffic is positively correlated. In order to compute the cognitive user's throughput in this strategy, we need to find both the transition and the steady state probabilities of the Markov chain described in Fig. 3.3. The calculation of a transition probability in a two-primary user channel system can be illustrated using an example as follows: A cognitive user had stayed in the first channel (say channel X) for L = m slots, then moved to the second channel (say channel Y) when the channel X became busy (State B ). Then it stayed in the channel Y for L = n slots before 42

moving back to the channel X in our two-primary user channel system as shown in Fig. 3.4. Here, m and n can be any positive integers but we first consider the case for n  2. Always a cognitive user switches the channel if that channel becomes busy to allow for primary user's privileged access. If the first slot of the channel Y is in State I (slot m + 1), then the transition probability should be PBI
(m+1)

where PBI

(m+1)

denotes the transition probability of

a channel becoming State I from State B after m + 1 slots. Similarly, if the slot m + 1 is in State U, then the transition probability should be PBU
(m+1)

. For staying the rest of n - 1

slots in the channel Y, the channel should be in either State I or U for the next n - 2 slots ((m + 2) - (m + n - 1)) and of course, the last slot ((m + n)th slot) should be in State B. ¯ as defined in (3.2) from the original transition We consider an extracted transition matrix T matrix T to characterize the channel transition. The transition probability for staying in a channel for L = n, (n  2) slots provided that cognitive user had stayed in the other channel for L = m slots before switching to this channel can be written as shown below for four different scenarios.  (m+1) ¯ (n-2)   PBI P PIB , Slot (m + 1) and (m + n - 1) are in State I ;  II       P (m+1) P ¯ (n-2) PU B , Slot (m + 1) and (m + n - 1) are in State I and State U respectively; BI IU  (m+1) ¯ (n-2)   PBU P PIB , Slot (m + 1) and (m + n - 1) are in State U and State I respectively;  UI      P (m+1) P ¯ (n-2) PU B , Slot (m + 1) and (m + n - 1) are in State U.

¯ (n-2) is defined as transition probability of a channel from State I to become State I where P II after n - 2 slots (there should not be any State B within n - 2 slots) and other notations can also be interpreted similarly. The transition probabilities are calculated from the transition 43

In order to solve (3.3)-(3.5), we need to simplify the infinite series. For that we need to find the relationship between the states. The states are sub-divided as shown below to find the relationships among them. From (3.4), we can write: P2 = P21 + P22 , where P21 =

The series sum can be calculated using eigenvalue decomposition. The square matrix T defined in (3.1) can be written as, T = V DV -1 , where D and V denote a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and a full matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors of matrix T respectively. The diagonal elements of the ¯ , defined in (3.2) can matrix D can be denoted by 1 , 2 and 3 . Similarly the matrix T ¯ (1,1) = 1 and ¯ = V ¯D ¯V ¯ -1 where the diagonal elements are denoted by D be written as T ¯ (2,2) = 2 where D(m,n) denotes the mth row and nth column element of the matrix D ¯ for D any positive integer m, n. Using the above properties, PBU , for any positive integer i, can be calculated as PBU = (V Di V -1 )(1,3) . The infinite series sum can be found as shown below,

Similarly, we can find the other infinite series sum. Solving the linear equations (3.3)-(3.5) after simplifying them as shown above, we can find the steady state probabilities of each state analytically. The steady state probability PL gives the probability that a cognitive user continuously stays in a channel for L number of slots. The last slot should be in State B and previous L - 1 slots can be in either State I or State U. As mentioned earlier, if it is in State U, the cognitive user shares the channel with primary user and the throughput would be reduced. Therefore, we need to identify the probability distribution of State I and State U for each state PL in the throughput calculation. That is, for each state L  2, the probability of staying in State I (PLI ) and State U (PLU ) needs to be calculated. This can be done using a tree diagram [36] concept. For that calculation, we need to know the probability of the first slot being in State I (PIf ) and State U (PUf ) for the states L  2 and PIf can be found as,


PI f =
i=1

Pi PBI ,

(i+1)

and similar equation can be written for the probability of the first slot being in State U (PUf ). We assume that the cognitive user's data rate is RI when it is in State I and RU when the channel is in State U. Then the transmitted data can be defined as,


CI =
i=2

(i - 1)Pi (PiI RI + PiU RU ).

(3.10)

The average length of a continuous stay of a cognitive user in a channel (in number of slots) can be found as,

Using (3.10) and (3.11), we can write the throughput of the cognitive user as, ¯I = CI . C ¯I L 47

3.2.2

Strategy B: Cognitive access without simultaneous channel sharing

In this section, the Strategy B is discussed with throughput analysis. Note that Strategy B is cognitive user occupies the channel only when it is idle (State I ) (no co-existence with the primary user). In the analysis, as defined earlier in Fig. 3.3, an infinite state Markov chain having states L = 1, 2, 3 . . . is used. As cognitive user senses only one channel at a time, the state of the other channel (B/U/I ) is predicted from the last visit. If a channel was visited n slots before and it was in State B, then the probability of being in State I in the next slot would be PBI
(n+1)

. Similarly, we can predict the other transition probabilities.

In this prediction, we are using the state of the channel when it was sensed during the last visit. In Strategy B, a cognitive user occupies a channel only when it is in State I (idle) and leaves a channel if the sensed channel was in either State B or State U. That is, if a cognitive user senses the channel as in either State B or State U, then it switches the sensing to the next channel in the next slot. During the sensing slot, if that channel is in State B, the cognitive user will not transmit during that slot; on the other hand, if the sensed channel is in State U, then cognitive user will transmit with lower power during that slot and switch the sensing to the other channel. Hence, it is noted that cognitive user stays in only one slot (L = 1) even though it does not transmit when the channel is in State B, and it transmits only in one slot at lower rate when the sensed channel is in State U before switching the sensing to the other channel. It is considered in the throughput calculation of state L = 1. For L  2 states, the first L - 1 slots are in State I and the last slot is State B or State U. In the analysis, we denote it with W , that is channel state of the last slot can be either State B or State U. The probability of last slot being in State U before the cognitive user

48

leaves a channel can be written as  = PIU /(PIU + PIB ) for L  2. Similarly, we can write that probability of last slot being in State B as 1 -  . As mentioned earlier, the L = 1 state is either due to State B or State U. For the analytical purpose, the State L = 1 is divided into 6 states (1BB , 1BU , 1UU , 1UB , 1BW and 1UW ) and for L  2, each state is divided into 3 states (LB , LU and LW ) based on the state of the previous visit. That is, State 1BU denotes that cognitive user stays in only one slot (L = 1) (during the sensing slot) and then, leaves it as that channel is in State B ; and the cognitive user had left that channel on its previous visit as it was in State U (denoted by the subscript letter U ). For simplicity in notation, we use BB instead of 1BB (state notation without "1"). The corresponding steady state probabilities are denoted by PBB , PBU , PUU , PUB , PBW and PUW for the state L = 1, and PLB , PLU and PLW for the states L  2, where P1 = PBB + PBU + PUU + PUB + PBW + PUW , and PL = PLB + PLW + PLU for L  2. The modified representation of Fig. 3.3 is shown in Fig. 3.5. This modification is done to facilitate the analysis for Strategy B. The subscript of the state notation denotes the state of channel during the previous visit. That is, LB denotes that the cognitive user stays L slots continuously in a channel and the state of the channel during cognitive user's previous visit was State B. LU and LB states are only one step transition states. That is, whenever a cognitive user moves from a L = 1 state to L ( 2) states, it will go to one of the LU states (L  2) if its previous state was L = 1 and State U or it will go to one of the LB states (L  2) if its previous state was L = 1 and State B. Since LB and LU are transition states, there will not be any transitions within LB or LU states or between LB and LU states. After staying L ( 2) slots in either LB or LU state, cognitive user can move to either State BW (L = 1 and State B ) or State UW (L = 1 and State U ) or State LW (L  2, the first L - 1 slots are in State I and last slot is in either State B or State U ). That is, the transition 49

depends on the state of the newly switched channel. The state transitions are possible within State LW . That is, we can find the transition probability, if the cognitive user moves from any State LW (L  2) to any State LW (L  2). The state descriptions are summarized below. The state of the channel during the last visit is used in the transition probability calculations. · BB - The cognitive user left the channel on its previous visit as the channel was in State B, it stays in only one slot (L = 1) during the current sensing slot, and then leaves that channel as the channel is in State B. · BU - The cognitive user left the channel on its previous visit as the channel was in State U, it stays in only one slot (L = 1) during the current sensing slot, and then leaves that channel as the channel is in State B. · UB - The cognitive user left the channel on its previous visit as the channel was in State B, it stays in only one slot (L = 1) during the current sensing slot, and then leaves that channel as the channel is in State U. · UU - The cognitive user left the channel on its previous visit as the channel was in State U, it stays in only one slot (L = 1) during the current sensing slot, and then leaves that channel as the channel is in State U. · BW - The cognitive user left the channel on its previous visit as the channel was in either State B or State U, it stays in only one slot (L = 1) during the current sensing slot, and then leaves that channel as the channel is in State B . · UW - The cognitive user left the channel on its previous visit as the channel was in State B or State U, it stays in only one slot (L = 1) during the sensing slot, and then leaves that channel as the channel is in State U. 50

· LB - The cognitive user left the channel on its previous visit as the channel was in State B, it stays in L slots during the current visit. · LU - The cognitive user left the channel on its previous visit as the channel was in State U. it stays in L slots during the current visit. · LW - The cognitive user left the channel on its previous visit as the channel was in either State B or State U. it stays in L slots during the current visit.

At steady state, we can write the steady state equation for State 2B (L = 2) as follows: P2B = PBB PBI (PIB + PIU ) + PBU PU I (PIB + PIU ) + PBW (PU I + (1 -  )PBI )(PIB + PIU ),

In Strategy B, the cognitive user stays in the same channel only when the state of the channel is State I. As mentioned earlier, we consider a two primary channel system (say, channel X and Y). The State UB denotes that state of the current channel (say channel X) is State U and stays in only one slot (L = 1). The state of the previous channel (channel Y) was State B denoted by the subscript. Since the cognitive user stays in only one slot in channel X (as it is in State UB ) and switches back to the previous channel (channel Y), we can find the transition probability of a channel (in this example, channel Y) from State B to State B after 2 slots as PBB . Note that, PBB denotes the transition probability of a channel becoming State B from State B after 2 slots. Hence, we can write the transition probability from State UB to State BU as PBB . Similarly, we can write the transition probability from State UU to State BU as PU B . Next we will find the transition probability from State UW to 52
(2) (2) (2) (2)

State BU . The State UW denotes that the current state of the channel is State U and L = 1, and the state of the previous channel's last slot was either State B or State U (denoted by subscript W ). That is, the cognitive user stayed in the previous channel for L ( 2) slots and left that channel since the last slot of that channel was either State B or State U. Since the cognitive user was in that channel for more than one slot, the one before the last slot should be State I. Hence, the probability of last slot being in State U can be written as  = PIU /(PIU + PIB ) and last slot being in State B can be written as 1 -  . Hence we can write the transition probability from State UW to State BU as PU B + (1 -  )PBB . As we already know the transition probabilities from State UU to State BU , State UB to State BU and State UW to State BU , we can write the steady state equation for the State BU as,
(2) (2)

PBU = PU B PUU + PBB PUB + (PU B + (1 -  )PBB )PUW .

Similarly, we can write P2 = W(1,2) P2B + W(3,2) P2U (PIB + PIU ) + (W(3,2) + (1 -  )W(1,2) )(PIB + PIU )P2 . Solving these linear equations (3.14) with (3.13), we can find the steady state probabilities of each state.

When L = 1, the cognitive user switches the channel after staying in only one slot and that slot, should be either State U or State B. If it is in State U, then cognitive user transmits at lower rate (RU ) before the switch. On the other hand, if the channel is in State B, cognitive user leaves that channel without transmitting as we assume that primary user traffic is positively correlated. Then the transmitted data can be calculated based on the probability of State U when L = 1 as, Ca = (PUU + PUB + PUW )RU . 54 (3.16)

For L  2, in the last slot, the cognitive user leaves the channel due to the channel becoming either State U or State B. If the reason for leaving the channel was due to State U, then the cognitive user would have transmitted in the last slot with a lower rate before leaving. Hence, the transmitted data in the last slot can be calculated as,

Operational Details

As we discussed earlier, the cognitive user should accurately detect the presence of the primary user in the interweave transmission. When the primary user is not active or not within the range of the cognitive user transmission, the cognitive user can transmit. There are many sensing algorithms in the literature [25,27] that can be used to detect the primary user transmission. On the other hand, in an underlay transmission mode, a cognitive user can transmit while a primary user is active as long as the interference to the primary system is within the threshold. We propose to use two different power levels PO and PU (< PO ) during the interweave (when the state is idle) and underlay modes of transmission of cognitive users; however, more 55

than two levels can also be considered. As these power levels are known to the cognitive transmitter, the throughput ratio (RU /RI ) of the cognitive user between the interweave and underlay transmission modes can be roughly calculated before the transmission. In our implementation, noting that achievable data rate is proportional to transmit power, we initially set RU /RI = PU /PI where PU and PI are underlay and interweave mode transmission power respectively. During the transmission, throughput can be reported back to the cognitive transmitter by the cognitive receiver and hence fine-tuned. We use the interference region model commonly used in [37­39] as shown in Fig. 3.6. In this model, it is assumed that a cognitive user knows the pilot power of the primary transmitter (Pp ), interference threshold at the primary receiver (s ) and communication range of the primary transmitter (R). With the pilot power, the distance between the primary and cognitive transmitters can be calculated (R + D ) where D is the interference range of the cognitive transmitter.

Figure 3.6: System model: Cognitive user in the presence of primary transceiver. If the cognitive user's underlay mode transmission with power PU is not causing interfer-

56

ence to the primary receiver, then the underlay transmission is possible. This interference threshold constraint can be written as
PP L(R) PU L(D )+Pn

> s , where L(d) and Pn are denoted by

total path loss at distance d from the transmitter, and the noise power level at the primary receiver respectively [37]. After estimating the distance of the primary user with the detected primary signal level during the sensing at the cognitive transmitter, the above interference constraint can be checked to see if it is met or not; and if it is, underlay transmission with power PU is decided. We re-define the following notations with additional details: s The interference threshold at the primary receiver. If the SINR is below this threshold, primary receiver cannot decode the signal properly. S The sensed power level at the cognitive transmitter. O Power threshold at cognitive transmitter that determines the presence of the primary user transmission. If the sensed power level at the cognitive transmitter is below this threshold (i.e., S < O ), then it can be assumed safely that primary user is not active on that sensed channel. This threshold can be calculated based on the probability of false alarm and detection requirements [40] and [15]. U Power threshold at cognitive transmitter for underlay transmission. If the sensed power level (S ) is such that O < S < U , then it can be assumed that cognitive user can safely transmit in underlay mode without exceeding the interference threshold of the primary receiver. If the sensed power level at the cognitive transmitter is above this threshold (i.e., S > U ), then it can be assumed that the primary user is active and underlay transmission of the cognitive user may affect the primary system. This threshold can be calculated using the sensed signal level Pp L(R + D ). Following, the

57

location of the primary transmitter can be estimated (R + D ) and then the interference range D can be calculated. Hence, with the received signal level S , the distance and the corresponding interference level can be calculated for a specific transmission power level PU . Note that U is a specific sensed power level, at which the underlay transmission with power PU causes interference to exceed the interference threshold (s ) to the primary system. The above discussed scenarios are summarized as follows: · State B : S > U , No transmission · State I : S < O , Interweave transmission · State U : U > S > O , Underlay transmission As mentioned in Section 3.1.2, in a cognitive radio system with positively correlated primary user traffic, cognitive user will stay or leave a primary channel when the sensed state of that channel is idle or busy respectively. When the channel is in State U, the cognitive user can stay in that channel with underlay transmission until that channel becomes State B or, cognitive user can switch that channel and look for interweave transmission (State I). When switching, cognitive user may end up with a channel with State B and it may reduce the throughput. Following our framework and analysis, a cognitive user can decide, based on the primary user network statistics, which mode of transmission (underlay/interweave) gives better long term throughput as evident from the figures from Section 3.3. Further, we assume that the primary user's transition matrix (T ) as a long term statistic and not instantaneous quantity. The cognitive user can monitor the network over a period of time and, based on the sensed power level of the primary user S with the thresholds O and U , it can build and model the primary user statistics (state transition matrix, 58

T ) [30]. Also, the cognitive users can use any learning algorithms to model the primary user statistics [41] [42]. Another approach is to use databases where these statistics can be stored and provided to cognitive users upon request.

3.3

Analytical Results and Discussion

In this section, we present and discuss the performance difference between the two schemes. The transition probabilities are randomly picked to do the analysis. The Monte-Carlo simulation results are compared with analytical results in Fig. 3.8 for different transition probabilities of PBI (busy to idle) when the data ratio
RU RI

is 0.6. As noted in the figure, analytical

and simulation results are in close agreement. We verified the analysis with simulation results for other transition probabilities as well. As we mentioned earlier, we assume that the primary user traffic is positively correlated with time. That is, when a primary user occupies the channel, it stays in that channel for few slots (PBB > {PIB or PU B }). Based on this assumption, we evaluated the underlayinterweave mode selection strategy for the cognitive user. Our analysis and simulation show the best strategy selection under this scenario (that is, cognitive user switches the channel when it senses the primary channel as busy). The strategy selection may change for other scenarios such as with (PIB > {PBB or PU B }) or (PU B > {PIB or PBB }) and, those cases are not shown in the plots. We believe the analysis for other scenarios can be done similarly by following the same steps and principles for the considered case.

3.3.1

Different primary user characteristics in channel sharing mode

When the primary user occupies the channel, it can stay in that channel for longer/shorter duration or it can share the channel with the cognitive user. Longer the primary user occupies the channel alone, lower the throughput of the cognitive user will be. In Fig. 3.9, the throughput performance for different transition probabilities PBU are considered for the above scenario. As PBB + PBI + PBU =1, for a specific PBI , if PBU is higher, then PBB would be lower. That is, if a primary user uses the channel (busy) for a short duration then the cognitive user's throughput would be higher. We can see from Fig. 3.9 that depending on the length of stay of a primary user, different strategies can be chosen by the cognitive user. When the primary users stays longer in a channel (i.e., PBB is higher), the Strategy A is useful. That is, cognitive user should look for an idle/sharing channel. The exact strategy switching thresholds can be found from the analysis for different primary user characteristics. In Fig. 3.9, it is found that the Strategy B performs better when PBI > 0.1 for PBU = 0.4 and when PBI > 0.22 for PBU = 0.1 respectively. Similarly, we can select the best strategy provided the statistical data of primary users are given.

3.3.2

Different data rates in channel sharing

The strategy selection not only depends on the primary user characteristics but also on the data rate of the cognitive user when sharing the channel. As discussed earlier, there exists a strategy switching threshold that directs the best strategy to follow. This threshold changes with different data rates. We consider the ratio between the data rate of the cognitive user when sharing the channel with primary user (RU ) and the data rate when using the channel alone (RI ). We do not assume any specific data rates, rather consider the ratio to make 60

the analysis more generic. The throughput performance comparison is shown in Fig. 3.10 and Fig. 3.11 for different data rates while sharing the channel with primary user for the ratio of 0.3 and 0.6 respectively. As expected, Strategy A performs better when the
RU RI

ratio

increases. Hence, we can also see that for PIU = 0.1, the strategy switching point shifts from PIB = 0.3 to PIB = 0.2 when
RU RI

changes from 0.3 to 0.6 while other transition probabilities

are kept fixed. That is, when the shared channel data rate (RU ) of a cognitive user increases, the Strategy A performs better. These analytical figures give better understanding of the throughput performance of the cognitive users in these different strategies. In Fig. 3.10, we can see that proper use of strategy gives up to 8% throughput advantage when PIB = 0.1. Similarly, we can find different thruput advantage for different conditions. In Fig. 3.12, the strategy selection criteria for different throughput ratio (RU /RI ) are shown for different set of primary user statistics. For example, when RU /RI = 0.6 and PBI > 0.23, it is better to select Strategy B. Also, we can see from Fig. 10 that for higher RU /RI , the strategy selection is towards Strategy B (underlay) when the probability PU U is higher. These data can be calculated analytically form our framework for different primary user statistics and can be stored in a lookup table, if needed, to speed up the decision process by the cognitive users to select the optimal transmission mode.

3.4

Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we analyzed two different opportunistic access strategies with different primary user channel conditions where the cognitive user can use an idle channel alone or can share with primary user under certain circumstances. When the primary user channel characteristics are given, we can find the best access strategy for the cognitive user from our analysis. When the data rate ratio (RU /RI ) increases, the Strategy A (underlay access, 61

sharing the channel) performs better for a positively correlated primary user traffic. That is, it is beneficial for a cognitive user to look for an idle/shared channel. If the ratio decreases, it is better to look for an idle channel only (Strategy B (interweave), access without sharing the channel). If a primary user occupies the channel (busy) for a long period, then it is better to look for Strategy A. The exact strategy switching thresholds (mode selection) can be found from our analysis and it depends on the transition probabilities of the primary user and the throughput ratio between the two modes of operation. The proper strategy selection can provide throughput gain over the other based on the scenario. The performance loss due to imperfect sensing and the gain due to sensing of multiple channels can be evaluated when using the proposed transmission mode selection. In this chapter we assumed perfect sensing of channel in the interweave-underlay cognitive system. However, in practice, there would be errors in both sensing and acknowledgement. Hence, in the following chapter, we analyze the optimal access strategy of a cognitive user in a single primary channel of a hybrid interweave-underlay system with sensing and/or acknowledgement errors.

Chapter 4 Channel Access in Interweave-Underlay Cognitive Radio System with Imperfect Sensing
In the previous chapter, we analyzed the channel switching strategy in a hybrid underlayinterweave system. There, we assumed that there are no channel sensing or receiver acknowledgement errors. In this chapter, we find an optimal access strategy of a primary channel given that the sensing is erroneous. While optimal and suboptimal myopic access strategies are investigated in the literature for two-state interweave primary user systems, in this chapter we consider and analyze the performance of a cognitive radio system when there are three possible hidden states. We propose forward algorithm to update the belief of the activity states of the primary user using information from two sources: the sensor output at the transmitter and the feedback signal from the receiver. Using these beliefs, the controller at the transmitter takes decision on the spectrum access and the power allocation based on the optimal alpha vectors calculated using finite-horizon POMDP formulation

67

and incremental redundancy solution technique. We compare the throughput that can be obtained using the forward algorithm based scheduler for partially observable state system with the optimal scheduler for completely observable state system. Our contributions in this chapter can be summarized as follows: · Investigating the spectrum access and power adaptation techniques for an opportunistic cognitive user in a cognitive radio network to optimize its throughput with specified sensing error limit to avoid the unnecessary collision with the primary user where the primary users' states are hidden, · Formulating the problem as a finite-horizon partially observable Markov decision process with the objective of maximizing the throughput, where the actions are notransmission and transmission with any of the two pre-set power levels based on interweave/underlay modes. · Proposing and analyzing a forward algorithm based technique that updates belief using the sensor output in the first slot and using the positive/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NAK) feedback of the previous time-slots in the rest of the slots of a frame to reduce the sensing burden to the cognitive user. The chapter is organized as follows. In Section 4.1, we describe the system model for the considered problem. The formulation of the problem as a POMDP and its optimal solution techniques are given in Section 4.2. Above problem is analyzed with a practical limited sensing scenario in Section 4.3. We provide simulation results in Section 4.4 and conclude in Section 4.5.

4.1

Interweave-Underlay System Model with Sensing Error

We consider a cognitive radio system where the primary users own the channels and a cognitive user uses those channels when they are unused by the primary users. We assume that the time is discretized into time-slots of duration Tslot sec and several discrete time-slots constitute a radio frame of duration Tf = H × Tslot , where H is called the horizon of the problem. Each time-slot possibly consists of sensing time Ts sec and data transmission time Td = Tslot - Ts sec as shown in Fig. 4.1(a). Data transmission time also includes the control and feedback signal times. At the beginning of a radio frame, a cognitive user decides how many channels and which channels to sense and then it carries out the out-of-band spectrum sensing. Our model is general enough to accommodate any physical layer (PHY) in-band channel sensing schemes. We assume that the performance of the channel sensing scheme only affects the accuracy of the mis-detection and false alarm probabilities, PM D and PF A . We assume that depending on the out-of-band sensing results, the cognitive user picks up one or more best channels and starts transmitting on that channels for the remaining of the time-slots. In the next time-slot of the frame, the cognitive user carries out in-band spectrum sensing and transmits packets if it is still free. In the next horizon, the cognitive user again starts the out-of-band or in-band channel sensing and selection depending on its strategy and the availability status of the previously occupied channel, and then repeats the transmission process. Upon receiving the data packet, the receiver sends an ACK/NAK feedback for the transmission. Let Pf e denote the probability of feedback error.

69

Problem Formulation: POMDP Based Interweave-Underlay Mode Selection We are concerned with the problem of optimal utilization of the channel and adaptation of power based on interweave-underlay mode selection in order to maximize the throughput and avoid the collision occurrence in a cognitive radio system. Since the exact instantaneous state of the primary user is unknown to the cognitive user, but the cognitive user wants to adapt the transmission with respect to primary user activity, the problem falls in the scope of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which has the following ingredients: a set of states S , a set of actions A, transition probability matrices Ps , a set of observations O, observation probability matrices Q, and reward matrix R.

System States Let us assume that S = {B, U, I } = {s1 , s2 , s3 } denotes the set of activity modes of the primary users as determined by the cognitive user, where B , U and I correspond to busy (s1 ), concurrent (s2 ) and idle (s3 ) states respectively. The brief description of the states are given below: 1. Busy State B (s1 ): The primary user occupies the channel and does not expect any kind of channel access by the cognitive user. When a cognitive user tries to access the channel while primary user is in state B , it will cause undesirable interference to primary user. 2. Concurrent State U (s2 ): The cognitive user can transmit simultaneously with the primary user, possibly using lower transmission power than that in state I . In this state, the receivers of the primary user network do not need higher quality of service (QoS) requirement and it can tolerate a higher level of interference than normal (i.e., than in state B ). In this state, the cognitive user transmitter may also use dirty paper 70

(b) The state diagram and observations for the POMDP problem. coding techniques to zero-force interference for its own receiver's signal and uses a part of its power to amplify and relay primary user signal to compensate the interference it causes. 3. Idle State I (s3 ): The channel is completely free to use by the cognitive user. The cognitive user can use it with any actions. Although all actions are allowable in state I , higher power action is most preferable since it can transmit at higher rate with this action.

Power Adaptation Actions based on interweave-underlay mode selection During a radio frame, at each time-slot, the controller of the cognitive transmitter takes decision whether or not to access the channel. The controller also decides what power it 71








 



 







will use to transmit data to the cognitive receiver if the channel is not in state B . Let A = {a1 , a2 , a3 } = {zero power, low power, high power} be the set of power actions, where each action corresponds to a specific transmission rate for the corresponding power. Note that action a1 corresponds to no transmission when the primary user in state B . When the primary user is in state U (concurrent), low power transmission is available (underlay mode of transmission) and when the primary user is in state I (idle), cognitive user may transmit with high power (interweave mode of transmission).

State Transition Matrix The transition probability matrix for a particular action expresses the probability of switching from one state to another, and for action ai  A, it can be written as,   PBB (ai ) PBU (ai ) PBI (ai )     Ps (ai ) = PU B (ai ) PU U (ai ) PU I (ai ) .     PIB (ai ) PIU (ai ) PII (ai ) (4.1)

Note that state transitions of the primary user activity are independent of the cognitive user's choice of action for the problem at hand. Therefore, we can write, Psi sj (ai ) = Psi sj , ai  A. State Observation and its Probability The sensing outcomes on the hidden system state form the observation vector Os = {o1 , o2 , o3 } = ^ U, ^ I ^}, where o1 = B ^ , o2 = U ^ and o3 = I ^ are the spectrum sensor's outputs for cor{B, responding hidden states B , U and I respectively. The relationship between the spectrum sensor outputs and the hidden states are shown in Fig. 4.1(b), where the probability of a state being in a particular state for a particular action is expressed in terms of observation probabilities P (oj |si, ak ), si  S , oj  O, ak  A.

72

Reward Matrix At the beginning of a time-slot, the system moves to the next state according to the state transition probability matrix of the hidden core process (primary user activity process) and an observation of the state is received through spectrum sensor. The controller at the cognitive user transmitter takes an action based on the updated belief of the state. The system also receives a reward or incurs a cost depending on the action choice. The controller chooses action that is expected to give best reward. Let Rsi (a) denote the reward value received in state si if action a is chosen. Therefore, the reward values for each state should be assigned in such way so that the controller chooses best action. In this chapter, unless specified otherwise, we use superscript t, t = 0, 1, · · · , H to denote a variable at time-slot T t . For example, the state of the primary user at time-slot T t is represented as st . Contrary, we use subscript n to denote n time-slots to go to reach the end of the horizon as shown in Fig. 4.1.

4.2

Optimal Solution Techniques

For the considered POMDP problem, the cognitive user transmitter only know the observations probabilities. Therefore unlike MDP problem (where the states of the system are completely observable, i.e., observation probability is either 1 or 0), the optimal solution for POMDP problem cannot be found using dynamic programming algorithm. However, information state vector, which can be tracked and updated with the observations, provides sufficient statistics for POMDP problem.

73

Information State An information or belief vector, Z is a probability distribution over the set of states S , where Z (s) is the probability associated with hidden state s, called information state of state s. Note that the value of Z (s) is a continuous positive real number and bounded by 0 and 1. The information state at time-slot T t can be calculated when the sequence of observations and actions so far are known using relation: Z (st ) = P (st |at-1 , ot-1 , · · · , a0 , o0 , s0 ), where o0 and a0 are the observation and corresponding action at the starting time-slot T 0 . It can be noted that this conditional probability is essentially a filtering task, and the new information state can be calculated recursively from the previous information state and the new observation-action pair. At any time, information vector is a sufficient statistic of the past sequence of observations. If Z (st ) is the previous information state, and the agent perceives observation ot and takes action at , then the new information state at time-slot T t+1 is given by, Z (st+1 ) = P (ot|st+1 , at )
st

Pst ,st+1 (at )Z (st ),

(4.2)

where  is a normalizing constant that makes the information state sum to be 1. We can write transformation function Z (st+1 ) = T (Z |a, o) as, Z (st+1 ) = P (ot |st+1 , at ) st Pst ,st+1 (at )Z (st ) . t t+1 , at ) t t st+1 P (o |s st Pst ,st+1 (a )Z (s ) (4.3)

Transformation function T (Z |a, o) updates the information state Z (st ), st  S at time-slot T t to the information state Z (st+1 ), st+1  S at time-slot T t+1 . Once the observation probabilities are known, we can find the term P (ot |st+1 , at ), st+1  S by P (ot |st+1 , at ) =
st S

P (ot |st , at )Pst ,st+1 (at ). It can be noted that the observation probability of a state is

dependent only on the underlying hidden state and is independent of the action. Therefore, we can write P (ot |si, at ) = P (ot |si ), ot  O, si  S . 74

Value Function The value functions are mappings from the information states to expected discounted total reward. Let Vn (Z ) be the maximum expected reward that the system can accrue during the lifetime of the process if the current information vector is Z and there are n slots remaining before the process terminates. The recursive equation for the value function can be written as, Vn (Z ) = max Z.R(a) + 
aA oO

P (o|Z, a)Vn-1[T (Z |a, o)] ,

(4.4)

where 0 <   1 is a discount factor for the expected reward and P (o|Z, a) =

Z (s i )

Psi sj (a)P (o|sj , a) is the probability of observing output o

if the current information vector is Z and action a is taken. Therefore, the value for an information state Z is the value of the best action that can be taken from Z of the expected immediate reward for that action plus the expected discounted value of the resulting information state. Value function Vn (Z ) is piecewise, linear and convex [43]. It can be written as,

(4.5)

k k k (n), 2 (n), 3 (n)], k = 1, 2, · · · . The for some set of vectors, called -vectors, k (n) = [1

exact numbers of -vectors depend on the numbers of action-observation pairs. It is clear from the above relation (4.5) that once the alpha vectors for various time-slots in the horizon are calculated, the policy that maximizes Vn (I ) for a given information vector is the optimal policy.

Algorithm for Calculating Alpha Vectors There exist several algorithms (e.g., enumeration, witness and incremental pruning) to find the optimal policy for the formulated finite-horizon discounted reward POMDP problem, 75

where the algorithm calculates the best policy for a given information vector in each timeslot during the finite horizon. In [43], the authors have discussed different techniques for calculating the alpha vectors for (4.5) and their relative merits and limitations. In this paper, we use incremental pruning algorithm to calculate the alpha vectors over the horizon, which is shown to perform the best in [43]. The basic idea behind this algorithm is to form transformed value function sets for a particular action and all observations, and then combining all choices incrementally observation by observation (e.g., value functions for first and second observations are combined first, then the results are combined with third, and so on) to find dominant sets. The process is repeated for the other actions and then the alpha vector sets are obtained by combining and eliminating dominated sets.

PHY Optimal Policy with Every Time-Slot Sensing (POPETS) Once the alpha vectors are determined for a problem, the next steps for finding optimal policy works as follows: 1. in every time-slot, the scheduler obtains the observation and it updates the information vector. The initial information vector is initialized randomly, 2. the value of information vector is plugged into the respective slot's alpha vector sets 3. the alpha vector that maximizes the value function for the information vector is the optimal alpha vector and the corresponding action is the optimal action.

4.3

Limited Sensing Policy

The optimal policy for the POMDP problem requires channel sensing in all the time-slots in a frame. However, sensing in all the time-slots consumes both the bandwidth and the power 76

for sensing. Since ACK/NAK information for the previous time-slot is already known at the link-layer. Using cross-layer interaction, the scheduler at the PHY can use those already available information to reduce the burden of sensing. We propose a novel cross-layer policy with first time slot sensing (XLPFTS) using the forward algorithm that estimates and maintains the probability distribution of the states, also called belief, from both the sensing observation result and the feedback ACK/NAK observations. We assume that the transmitter senses the channel in the first time-slot and thereafter it uses feedback observation during the rest of the slots to update the belief of the states. The belief of the states in each time-slot is then used to pick up the best alpha vector and associated action using (4.5). We discuss the forward algorithm that deals with the updating and propagating the belief below.

Hidden State Belief Estimation Suppose O1:m := o1 , o2 , · · · , om denotes a given sequence of observations (either from sensor or from feedback). Therefore, the probability of state si given the observations can be written as: fo:m (si ) = P (sm = si |o1 , o2 , · · · , om ,  ), (4.6)

where  is the belief of the states at the starting time-slot. When current belief and the new observation are known, the belief of the hidden states can be updated iteratively as follows: fo:m (si ) = Od Ps fo:m-1 , (4.7)

where Od is the diagonal observation matrix whose diagonal elements Od [i, i] are the observation probabilities for states si  S and other elements are zeros. After normalizing the probabilities so that the sum is equal to 1, we can write the

77

normalized belief vectors as follows: ^ fo:m =  Od Ps^ fo:m-1 , where  is the normalizing factor. (4.8)

Belief Update in the First Slot In order to utilize unused spectrum opportunistically and at the same time avoid interference to the returning primary users, spectrum sensing is done periodically. Among the different spectrum sensing methods, energy detection is the most popular due to its simple design and smaller sensing time [12]. Without loss of generality, we continue our discussion using energy detection technique, where the collected energy after sampling and frequency domain operations forms the test statistics, X (y ) of the energy detector's received signal y . The probability density function (pdf), p(y ) of the test statistic can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution [15]. The cognitive user transmitter senses the channel energy and compares with two different thresholds 1 and 2 to determine the state of the primary user [19]. ^ |I ), which is the probability of the sensor falsely The probability of false alarm P (B declaring the presence of primary signal in lower state when it is actually in upper state, ^|B ), which is the can be written as P r (X (y ) > 1 |I ). The probability of mis-detection P (I probability of the sensor incorrectly declaring the presence of primary signal in state that is upper than actual state, can be written as P r (X (y ) < 2 |B ). Similarly, other false alarm ^ |I ) and P (B ^ |U ), and mis-detection probabilities P (U ^ |B ) and P (I ^|U ) can be probabilities P (U evaluated using appropriate thresholds. The diagonal observation matrix Od , for observation ^ in (4.7), can be written as Od = diag(P (o1|B ), P (o1 |U ), P (o1|I )). B

78

Belief Update in the Other Slots In a particular time-slot, in state st when the controller takes a particular action at , the cognitive transmitter obtains an observation using the feedback from the receiver. When the receiver receives the packet sent from the transmitter successfully, it sends an ACK. Therefore, when an ACK is received, the transmitter assumes that no collision occurred with primary user's transmission. The absence of ACK is interpreted as collision with the primary user's transmission. Hence, the set of feedback observations can be written as Of = {q1 , q2 }={No Collision, Collision}. Although the actual states of the primary user's activity are hidden, the cognitive user gets an idea of them using the previous observations. The relationship between the actual state and the observation for each action can be expressed in terms of 3 × 2 feedback observation matrix and can be expressed as Q = [qik ], where qik = P (q t = qk |st = si i, at ), qk  Of , si  S . The diagonal observation matrix Od can be written for ACK (no collision) feedback as follows: Od = diag(q11 , q21 , q31 ).

4.4

Simulation Results and Discussion

In this section, we present simulation results for the PHY-optimal policy and the cross-layer policy using Monte-Carlo technique for 106 time-slots. As discussed before, the belief of the states is updated using sensing information in each time-slot for POPETS. For XLPFTS case, it is updated using channel sensing information in the first time-slot and using previous ACK/NAK information in the other time-slots. We compare both policies with the fully observable optimal policy (FOOP) that gives maximum possible throughput over the simulation period. The throughput results for FOOP are obtained assuming that states are completely known and the action that gives maximum throughput without any collision 79

are chosen. For both POPETS and XLPFTS cases, the action for a particular time-slot is obtained by substituting the respective updated belief in (4.5). Note that the alpha vectors are obtained using incremental pruning algorithm. We assume that spectrum sensing requires 10% (approximately 1ms [12]) of time in a slot. The duration of each slot is Tslot = 10 ms [44]. The horizon length (frame size), H is varied from 2 to 20. The number of radio frames for each scenario is found according to the frame size, H . Although any activity statistics of primary user are valid for the problem, without loss of generality, we consider three cases where the self-transition probabilities, Pst = Psi si , si  S are 0.99, 0.97 and 0.95. When in state B and I , the adjacent transition probability, Psi sj , |i - j | = 1 is 0.8(1 - Psisi ) and other transition probability is 0.2(1 - Psisi ). When in state U , both adjacent states are equally probable, i.e., Psisj = 0.5(1-Psi si ), |i-j | = 1. We use the following rewards so that the occurrence of collision among primary user and cognitive user can be avoided: RB (a1 ) = 0, RU (a2 ) = 1, RI (a3 ) = 2, RI (a2 ) = 1, and others are -1. We use positive reward and negative reward for an action when it is expected and is not expected in a state respectively. That is, the negative value discourages the scheduler for taking actions when a higher positive reward exists. For example, when in state B , action a2 and a3 are not permitted as both of these two actions will introduce interference to the primary user. Therefore, the rewards corresponding to these actions in state B are negative. The reward for action a1 is zero, which is better than negative reward, so the scheduler chooses a1 over a2 and a3 . In state U , our expected action is a2 because a3 will introduce interference and a1 will miss spectrum opportunity. Likewise, in state I , expected action is a3 , but a2 is permitted since it does not either introduce interference or miss spectrum opportunity. The reward is lower because the throughput obtained using a2 is less than that using a3 . Action a1 is not expected in state I as discussed above. Note that the reward matrices are not the same as throughput matrices. We assume that we receive 80

throughput of 1 and 2 for actions a2 and a3 respectively when no collision happened. In state si  S collision occurs for action aj  A when i < j . We use 1 and 0 to express collision and successful events find average collision per-slot. We have found that the policy does not depend on the initial belief and therefore, it is initialized to steady-state vector.

Figure 4.2: Throughput vs horizon size when sensing/feedback error is zero In Figs. 4.2 and 4.3, we show the average throughput and the average collision for the three policies discussed above with self-transition probability, Pst as parameter and assuming zero sensing and feedback errors. It can be interestingly seen that when Pst = 0.99, the effective throughput obtainable in the XLPFTS is greater than the POPETS case for every size of the horizon. However, the average collision for XLPFTS case is slightly less than 0.5% while it is zero for POPETS. Since POPETS case loses 0.1Tslot sec in every slots and XLPFTS loses that only in first time-slot, the average throughput per slot is more for the latter. As 81

Figure 4.5: Collision vs horizon size for non-zero sensing and feedback error the channel self-transition rate decreases to 0.97 and then to 0.95, XLPFTS case gives more throughput up to H = 12 and H = 7 respectively. The average collision also increases as the channel mixing rate and horizon size increases. We show the effect of spectrum sensing error and feedback errors for Pst = 0.97 in Figs. 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. It can be noted from the figures that as the sensing error probability, Pse = PM D = PF A increases to 0.05 from 0, the average throughput decreases and average collision is non-zero for POPETS case also. However, they are not dependent on the feedback error probability, Pf e . When both the sensing and/or the feedback error probabilities are non-zero, the average throughput decreases and average collision increases for XLPFTS case. However, up to H = 6, the loss of throughput due to sensing error is more than feedback error. The situations reverses after H = 6. The collision curves also exhibit the same trends, but switching happens at different value of H as can be seen in the Fig. 4.5. 83

Chapter Summary

We investigated the throughput and the collision performances of a cognitive radio system when the primary user has possibly three hidden states. We provided POMDP-based formulation and incremental-pruning algorithm based solution techniques to find alpha vectors needed to compute policy for a particular belief vector. For a particular belief vector in a particular time-slot, the power adaptation actions are found by plugging the belief vector in the alpha vector sets and by finding maximum value of the scalar products of them. We studied two policies: in order to track the belief, while first technique requires channel to be sensed in each time-slot, second technique requires channel sensing in the first time-slot only. In the other time-slots, ACK/NAK feedback from previous slot is used in the latter technique. We evaluated the throughput and the collision performances of both policies and compared them with fully observable optimal policy. Simulation results showed that the proposed cross-layer policy is more throughput efficient than the physical layer optimal policy, specially when the primary user's state transition rate is slower and/or frame size is smaller.

Chapter 5 Channel Access in Overlay Cognitive Radio System
In the previous chapters, we studied the performance of underlay and interweave cognitive communication system. In this chapter, we do the preliminary study of the last variant of the cognitive radio system called overlay cognitive radio system. In an overlay system, the cognitive user operates concurrently with primary user. In contrast to underlay system, the cognitive user assists the primary user communication while operating in overlay mode of transmission. In overlay mode, it is assumed that primary user information is available at cognitive user. The knowledge of the primary user's message is used to mitigate or cancel the interference at the primary and cognitive receiver. Relaying the primary user information plays a crucial role in an overlay system. On the other hand, orthogonal frequency and code division multiplexing (OFCDM) based access technology is considered as a good candidate for the next generation wireless standards [45, 46]. Hence, in this chapter, we evaluate the performance of an OFCDM based relay network and the analysis can be extended to the overlay cognitive radio system.

85

For wideband applications, code division multiple access (CDMA) based systems deployed on multicarriers could provide effective multiple access capabilities. First was the multicarrier direct-sequence CDMA [47] system where multicarrier modulation was used with time spreading. The other was the multicarrier CDMA [48] where multicarrier modulation and frequency domain spreading were used. Even though multicarrier CDMA provides frequency diversity, it is vulnerable to multiple access interference in frequency selective subcarriers. In order to realize the benefits from both systems, a multicarrier CDMA system was proposed in [49] where both frequency and time spreading codes were used according to the channel conditions. This proposed system was shown to provide frequency diversity while reducing the multiple access interference. Channels can be selected orthogonally, and OFCDM system was proposed in [50]. OFCDM uses data spreading in both time and frequency domain, where each data stream is segmented into multiple substreams and spread over multiple channels and several OFCDM symbols, exploiting additional frequency and time diversity. OFDM technology is incorporated in standard IEEE 802.11 for wireless local area networks, in IEEE 802.16 for metropolitan area networks [51] and in LTE [52]. In [53], OFDM based two dimensional spreading was proposed for future 4G wireless networks [54] and field test was done by NTT DoCoMo to support the needs of OFCDM technology in future wideband communications [45]. There has been quite an amount of research work on channel grouping and allocation to further improve the performance in OFCDM systems. For example, channels are grouped and adaptively allocated in [55] to users by improving the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) while minimizing the multiple access interference. On the other hand, the transmission range of the next generation wireless networks is limited due to the higher operating frequencies [56]. Cooperative cognitive relay systems can improve the throughput, coverage and the reliability [57, 58] in wideband wireless com86

munications. In order to get better performance, relaying was incorporated in the standard IEEE 802.16j (WiMAX) amendment and in 4G networks [59]. In future generations networks, OFCDM based relay networks would provide better performance. CDMA technique was introduced in relay systems in [60] [61] to take advantage of spread spectrum techniques. In [62], multicarrier CDMA decode-and-forward relay system performance was analyzed. The power allocation was analyzed in [63] for a CDMA based decode-and-forward relay system and cognitive relay networks are recently studied in different articles [64­66]. However, there have been not much work done for OFCDM based relay networks. In the future overlay cognitive systems, OFCDM based relaying would be more beneficial as mentioned earlier. In this chapter, channel and power allocation schemes are proposed and analyzed for different scenarios for a two-hop decode-and-forward OFCDM based relay network. Our contributions in this chapter can be summarized as follows: · Deriving the bit error performance of the proposed channel and power allocation schemes for a two-hop decode-and-forward OFCDM based cognitive relay network. · Numerically evaluating the effect of considering the channel state information (CSI) of source-base station and source-relay in channel allocation. · Numerically analyzing the BER performance for different power allocation ratio between the source and relay nodes. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows: In Section 5.1, the system model for a two-hop relay network and a modified adaptive channel and power allocation algorithms are presented. In Section 5.2, relevant literature for one-hop and BER derivation for a twohop OFCDM based decode-and-forward relay network are presented. Section 5.3 presents

87

the performance comparison for different channel and power allocation schemes for different time-frequency spreading codes. Finally, this chapter concludes in Section 5.4 with future work.

5.1

Two-hop Overlay System Model

We consider a two-hop wireless system where OFCDM is employed as multiple access technology. Users are denoted by Uk and total number of users is K (assumed to be even number). Odd numbered users (U1 , U3 , . . . , UK -1 ) are classified into one group and even numbered users (U2 , U4 , . . . , UK ) into another group as done in [62]. Further, it is assumed that there is an one-to-one mapping between two groups of users and they are paired (as partners) for cooperative relaying. Source nodes and relaying nodes are allocated separate channels (time slots) during the transmission. Each node transmits its own data as well as the estimated data of its partner which was received in the previous time slot. All the users have their own spreading codes. Each partner node is aware of its own spreading code as well as its partner's spreading code. Every user's information is retransmitted using that user's spreading code. That is, source transmits its own information using its own spreading code. Relay node decodes and forwards the information of its partner using its partner's spreading code and, at the same time transmit its own information using its own code [67]. Fig. 5.1 shows a couple of transmission cycles to understand the pair-wise communication (t = j, j + 1)and Table 5.1 shows 4 consecutive transmission time instances. The User 1 is considered as source and the User 2 as relay. Further, the binary data stream of user k is ^k denoted by bk j = ±1 and its estimate at the relay node by bj where j  indicates the time instance. 88

Table 5.1: Two user cooperative communication during 4 time slots In the analysis, the channel is assumed to be slowly varying with respect to the OFCDM symbol duration. It is also assumed that channel spacing is larger than the coherence bandwidth of the channel in a group and hence, frequency non-selective fading occurs on each channel within a channel group [3]. This allows the frequency domain channel to be modeled as:
k k Hj,m = j,m eij,m ,
k

where i =



k -1. The term j,m is the Rayleigh fading gain for the mth channel of the k th

user during the j th transmitted bit. The phase is an uniformly distributed random variable over the interval (0, 2 ], which is assumed to be independent for each bit, user, and channel.

89

Channel and Power Allocation in a Relay Network In this section, a modified adaptive channel allocation algorithm for an OFCDM based relay network is first proposed and then the power allocation parameters and the scenarios are discussed for the subsequent analysis.

Channel Allocation In [55], an adaptive channel allocation algorithm was proposed for a single link transmission to improve the overall BER performance of an OFCDM system. The channels are assigned to users that are having higher SINR at the same time reducing the interference caused by this assignment to other users in the same channel group. This algorithm is modified later in this section for a decode-and-forward OFCDM based two-hop relay system. In a two-hop relay system, there are 3 links, namely (sr, sbs and r bs) that contribute to the overall BER performance of the system. As described earlier, the two consecutive time slot transmission from the source and the relay are assumed to fade independently; hence, the channel allocation is also done separately. During the j th time slot, the source will transmit and, the base station and the cooperating relay node will receive on a same set of channel group (Gy,s ). Therefore, the channel allocation algorithm is carried out based on the availability of the channel state information (CSI) of the links sr , and sbs. We introduce a parameter  (0    1), called cooperative CSI (C-CSI) which weighs in end-to-end SINR for a two-hop transmission and hence provides different impact on channel allocation.  =0.5 means that the channel allocation algorithm tries to optimize both links (sbs and sr ) simultaneously giving equal weight. In this case, maximizing the SINR while minimizing the multiple access interference would be performed on both links together

90

with equal weight. When  =1, the channel allocation is done solely based on the CSI of the link sbs whereas when  =0, it is solely on the CSI of the link sr .  is therefore called cooperative CSI that adjusts the weight of different cooperative links. Hereafter, the time instance j is dropped in the notations for simplicity. Decision variable (i.e., SINR) in channel allocation for a two-hop relay system for user k is defined giving different weights to cooperative links as:
k k,bs k,r y = y + (1 -  )y ,

(5.1)

k,bs k,r and y are defined as SINR of user k belonging to channel group y at the base where y

station and the relay node respectively and they are calculated as in (5.8). The channel allocation algorithm is described briefly as follows:

k (a) Channel group that has the largest SINR y as defined in (5.1) for all k users is found

as follows:
k k k k max = max{1 , 2 , . . . , Y }. k The index denoted ymax is recorded.

(b) From the result in (a), the channel group with the smallest SINR is found as follows:
1 2 K , max , . . . , max }. min = min{max

The index of the user with the lowest SINR value, denoted kmin is recorded.

kmin (c) User kmin is assigned to the channel group ymax and the SINR is re-calculated for

that assigned group using (5.8). The algorithm is repeated until all the data streams are assigned.

91

The channel group with the highest SINR for each user will produce the best BER
k (in step (b)) performance for each user (in step (a)). When the user with the smallest max

is provisioned to the channel group first (in step (c)), it reduces the average fading gain in the group, and consequently reduces the amount of interference to other users.

strategies among the source and the relay node are discussed with different channel allocation schemes. Further, the BER performance analysis is carried out for two different scenarios. · Case 1: Equal channel gains for all three links (sbs, sr and r bs) · Case 2: Strong source to relay link ( dB better than other two links). This case is more practical as one would normally resort to relay communication under this condition. The power allocation strategies are discussed in the Section 5.3.

5.2

Bit Error Rate Analysis

In this section, BER performance for an one-hop OFCDM system with adaptive channel allocation is first reviewed and for the two-hop decode-and-forward OFCDM based relay system is derived later. 92

5.2.1

BER Derivation: One-hop (single link) Transmission

For a direct one-hop transmission, the adaptive channel allocation for an OFCDM system was proposed in [55]. In order to recover the data from User 1 at the receiver, the received signal is copied to the channel branches that are assigned to User 1 and then signal on each channel is restored to the baseband considering the phase response of the channel. Then each branch is multiplied by the synchronized time domain spreading sequence and the frequency domain pseudo-random chip. The despread signal is then multiplied by the
1 fading gain, j,m , according to the maximal ratio combining algorithm. Finally, the channels

are summed, integrated over the bit period, and sampled to yield the decision variable for User 1 as:
1 1 1 1 Zj = Dj + Ij + j ,

(5.3)

1 1 where Dj is the desired signal, Ij is the interference from the other users on group y , 1 y = {1, 2, . . . , Y }, where Y is total number of channel groups and j is the noise term which

is considered as the AWGN noise signal with a double-sided power spectral density of No /2 during j th bit duration. Further, Gy , My and Ky denote the set of channels, number of channels and the number of users respectively occupying a group y simultaneously. Since we are not concerned with the absolute performance of the receiver/detection schemes, we could use any receiver. Maximal ratio combining receiver has been widely used in the literature [49, 55, 68­70] for similar work. A multi-user detection scheme such as minimum mean square error can also be used; however, it will not affect our conclusions, though one would expect relative BER performance degradation in maximal ratio combining receiver with an increase in the number of active users compared to multi-user detection schemes. The desired signal can be written as [55] for a single link direct transmission,  1 Dj = N c b1 j
m Gy 1 (j,m )2 ,

(5.4)

93

where c is the chip energy and N is the length of the pseudo-random sequence.
1 . The power of the desired signal for user 1 is determined by computing the variance Dj

Since the bit stream, b1 j has zero mean, the power of the desired signal can be written as:
2 1 PD j

(5.5)

where Var[.] is the variance. The interference term is calculated by considering the correlation between the received signals from all Ky users occupying channel group y simultaneously, with the time and frequency domain spreading sequences for User 1. The interference power can be approximated as a Gaussian random variable when the number of users is moderate to large, and the input data stream is random [49] [71]. The resulting interference power is, PI1j = Nc (Ky - 1)E (y )2
m Gy 1 (j,m )2 ,

(5.6)

where E (y )2 is the average fading gain for the Ky users and My channels in group y . It can be calculated as follows: E[(y )2 ] = 1 Ky My
k (j,m )2 . k Gy mGy

The noise power at output of the correlation can be written as:
1 1 = Var j = NNo P j m Gy 1 (j,m )2 .

(5.7)

Based on the equations (5.5)-(5.7), the SINR for User 1 during the j th bit assigned to
1 channel group y , j,y can be written as: 1 j,y =

Nc

1 2 m Gy (j,m )

(Ky - 1)c E (y )2 + No 94

.

(5.8)

Further, the probability of bit error can be determined for the j th bit as follows assuming BPSK modulation, Pr1 bj = Q
1 2j,y .

(5.9)

5.2.2

BER Derivation: Two-hop Relay Transmission

Based on the results in the previous section for one-hop system, the BER performance of the two-hop relay system is derived in this section. Few additional notations sr , sbs and r bs are incorporated in the channel gain to differentiate the links, denoting source-relay link, source-base station link, and relay-base station link respectively. As shown in Fig. 5.1, the same source information is received at the base station (bs) during two consecutive time slots. In the j th time slot, the information is received from the source (s) and, during the (j + 1)th time slot the information is decoded and forwarded by the corresponding relaying (r ) node. The combined decision variables with equal confidence on both the links of User 1 after two consecutive time slots (j, j + 1) at the base station receiver can be written as below. The source node and the relay node chip energies are denoted by The desired signal from (5.4) is:

Performance Analysis

The analysis for the overall BER performance is done in this section for the scheme where the channel allocation is done giving equal weight to the links sbs and sr ( =0.5). This 96

analysis can be extended to other schemes as well. For the analytical purpose, equation (5.14) is simply denoted as: Pe = (1 - er )ec + er ef , (5.16)

where each term represents the corresponding term in (5.14). First, we consider the term


ec = Q



1,c 2(Dj +1,bs )

1 j +1,bs

. It can be assumed that both the links s  bs and r  bs have similar

fading characteristics when the relay node is used for the diversity advantage. Hence, the number of channels and the total channel gains within a channel group can be assumed approximately the same in (8)-(10). Further, in an interference-limited system, the noise power can also be neglected compared to the interference power. Based on these assumptions, ec can be approximated as: ec  Q  K(  
cr cs + cr

cs cs

+ +

cr )

,

(5.17) =

where K is constant for a fading block. It can be further simplified by substituting
c

as:   ec  Q K (  + 1 - ) . (5.18)

Equation (5.18) is a convex function and it has the minimum when the power is equally shared between the source and the relay node (i.e., =0.5) as shown in the Fig. 5.2. Similarly, it can be shown that the term ef has the worst performance when =0.5. On the other hand, the term er monotonically decreases with  as the Q(.) function does. Therefore, the term (1-er ) is an increasing function. These observations are used to interpret the results later.

Higher Eb /No The sr link error probability (er ) is comparatively minimal at higher Eb /No range even though the power allocation strategies vary at the source. In this case, the second term 97

Figure 5.2: Normalized curve for ec vs . in (5.16), er .ef , would be negligibly smaller compared to the other term (1 - er )ec . As we discussed in previous section, when  is closer to one, the the performance of ec and (1 - er ) are getting worse; hence, the system performance is worse at higher Eb /No for higher . At lower , even though ec is getting worse, (1 - er ) is improving and hence, slightly better performance can be noticed compared to higher  values (this can be seen later in Fig. 5.5 at 20 dB).

Lower Eb /No At lower Eb /No values, the sr link performance will vary widely based on the received SINR at the relay node. If the transmit power is higher at the source node or sr link is having better channel gains, the BER at the relay node would be better. At lower Eb /No values, the lower power allocation (lower ) to the source node leads to higher BER (er ) at the relay node. Further, the higher power allocation to the relay node makes the relay node transmit the incorrectly decoded bits with high power. This affects the term ef further, but the performance of the term ec remains almost the same irrespective to the power 98

allocation. Hence, the second term er .ef is highly determining the overall BER of the system at lower Eb /No (as shown later in the Fig. 5.5 at 0 dB for Case 1). The performance should be analyzed using both the terms in (5.16) when the link sr has different channel gain compared to the other two links.

5.3

Numerical Results and Discussion

In this section, the simulation scenarios and the BER performance for different schemes are discussed. The BER performance results are numerically evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulation. The channel allocation is done based on the availability of the CSI between the links sr and sbs. Channels are grouped so that within a group, all the channels undergo independent fading. Further, the uplink bandwidth is assumed to be 20MHz with 128 channels. There are 64 users grouped into two and paired. In one time slot, 32 users are assigned to the channel by the channel allocation algorithm. Each of the users is assumed to be traveling at a velocity of 5km/h, which corresponds to a Doppler frequency of 23.14Hz and to a coherence time of approximately 18s. It is assumed that delay spread is 6.4s which is common in urban areas [71]. The numerical simulation is carried out for the decode-and-forward OFCDM based twohop relay system with different power allocation schemes. When a time domain spreading factor of 4 is utilized with a frequency domain processing gain of 8, it is denoted by 4×8. For the sake of comparison, we fix the total spreading factor to be 32. The total spreading factor is equal to the spreading factor in the time domain multiplied by the spreading factor in the frequency domain.

Channel Allocation

In this section, different channel allocation schemes are evaluated for a system with equal power sharing between the source and the relay nodes (=0.5). Fig. 5.3(a) shows the different BER performance of a 4×8 (time x frequency) spread two-hop decode-and-forward relay system for different C-CSI ( ) values. From this figure, we can notice that the channel allocation of a decode-and-forward two-hop relay depends on the channel state information of the link sr as further explained next.

Figure 5.3: BER performance comparison for different spreading systems with different CCSI ( ): (a) 4×8 (b) 8×4. In a typical relay system, the CSI of the link sbs is usually available. When the CSI of both links sbs and sr are available and equal weight is given (i.e.,  =0.5) in the channel allocation, it gives 4 dB gain over the channel allocation with  =0.75, where channel allocation is done mainly based on the link sbs at BER of 10-2 . Interestingly, when the channel allocation is done mainly based on the link sr ( =0.25), it outperforms 100

the allocation which is done mainly based on the link sbs ( =0.75) by 5 dB at BER of 10-2 . The decision variable at the receiver (bs) is considered during the decoding process giving equal weight on both the received signal from the source and the forwarded signal from its partner. Therefore, the incorrectly decoded bits at the relay node will cause higher error probability at the base station. At higher Eb /No , it is better to do the channel allocation considering mainly the inter-partner (source-relay) CSI, provided it is accurate. Similar characteristic is observed in Fig. 5.3(b) for a system with spreading factor of 8×4. We can notice that the error floor improves when the value of  decreases, i.e., the channel allocation is done giving higher weight to the link sr . The error floor is 0.0169 when  =0.75 whereas it is 0.0125 when  =0.25. The performance is highly interferencelimited at higher Eb /No for higher time spreading schemes as shown in Fig. 5.3. Further, the error floors for the schemes 16×2 and2×16 are shown in Table 5.2 and explained in detail in Section 5.3.2. In the case of a specific spreading factor (for example 8×4), different Eb /No values influence in selecting the index  when both link CSIs are perfectly available. For example, even though  =0.25 is performing better at higher Eb /No , for Eb /No < 0 dB,  =0.5 is preferred over  =0.25 for an 8×4 system as shown in Fig. 5.3. We also observed the significance of this selection in higher time spreading systems such as 16×2 and 32×1. Even though the selection of  in channel allocation is less significant for the schemes with higher frequency spreading, it influences the schemes with higher time spreading. In Fig. 5.4, BER performance is shown for different spreading factors, from higher (lower) time (frequency) spreading to lower (higher), by varying the parameter C-CSI ( ). At lower Eb /No, it is better to use higher spreading in time, and lower spreading in frequency as also reported in [55]. The cross-over point is defined as an Eb /No value around which the performance of the frequency spreading becomes better than the time spreading. In Fig. 101

5.4, when  increases from 0.25 to 0.75, the cross-over point (Eb /No ) value moves from 4 dB to 1 dB. It is also tabulated for different values of  the Table 5.3 and it shows a relationship between the cross-over point (Eb /No) and the C-CSI ( ) which provide additional flexibility in operating environment for OFCDM systems between time and frequency spreading.

Figure 5.5: BER performance comparison for 2×16 scheme with different power allocation at Eb /No =0 dB,10 dB and 20 dB ( =0.5). For the equal link gain (Case 1, at higher Eb /No (20 dB)), the BER performance is optimum when 0.8. When  increases further, that is source node power is increased, the performance deteriorates at a faster rate than when  decreases. Therefore, when  takes the value less than the optimum, it is less sensitive to the BER performance and hence, it

103

is safe to operate in the region 0.6    0.85 with less than 10% performance degradation. On the other hand, at lower Eb /No values, the BER performance is also sensitive when  decreases. Hence, the operating region shrinks to 0.75    0.85. In the case of stronger sr link (Case 2) considering here we consider  =5 dB, we can notice a similar trend at higher Eb /No values but at lower Eb /No values, Case 2 performance is better when lower power is allocated to the source node compared to Case 1. That is, the optimal cooperative power ratio moves towards 0.65 for lower Eb /No values when the sr has 5 dB better channel gain compared to the other two links as shown in Fig. 5.5. Fig. 5.6(a) and Fig. 5.6(b) show the BER performance for different cooperative power ratio for both the cases when the channel allocation is done giving equal weight ( =0.5) on both the links sbs and sr . As we discussed earlier, at higher Eb /No , BER performance reaches the interference-limited error floor according to the power allocation scheme in both cases. Fig. 5.6(b) shows that when the channel gain on the link sr is better, it gives better performance on low-to-moderate Eb /No region; but at higher Eb /No , it reaches the same error floors. Further, it shows 5 dB, 1.5 dB and 1 dB gains at =0.25, =0.5 and =0.75 respectively at BER of 10-2 for the system with better channel gain of 5 dB between the sr link than the one having equal gain. Table 5.4 shows the above results. Required Eb /No at BER of 10-2 Power Allocation Ratio () Equal Gain 0.25 0.50 0.75 8.25 10.5 17.0 Strong sr Link 7.25 8.0 13.0

Figure 5.6: BER performance comparison for 2×16 scheme with C-CSI,  =0.5, for various power allocation with: (a) Equal Channel Gain (Case 1) (b) 5 dB higher sr link (Case 2). We can notice at higher Eb /No when the link sr is stronger, the interference-limited error remains the same for both the cases and there is no significant difference in optimal power allocation strategy (). On the other hand, at lower Eb /No values, different power allocation strategies have different impact.

Different Time-Frequency Spreading Schemes Fig. 5.7 shows the BER performance of different spreading schemes (4×8, 8×4) for different Eb /No values. We notice the similar phenomena as discussed earlier for 2×16 scheme. We also notice that at low Eb /No (0 dB) the performance is better for an 8×4 scheme than the 4×8 scheme whereas, at higher Eb /No (10 dB, 20 dB), 4×8 scheme outperforms the other. At lower Eb /No , the performance is limited by thermal noise. Higher number of groups with few channels lead to allocate channels with best channel conditions. Therefore, lower

Figure 5.7: BER performance comparison for 4×8 and 8×4 schemes with different power allocation at Eb /No =0 dB,10 dB and 20 dB ( =0.5). frequency spreading with higher time spreading offers better performance. Also the multiple access interference is minimal since a relatively lower number of users is sharing each group of channels. On the other hand, at higher Eb /No, the system performance is limited by multiple access interference. Therefore, selecting a better channel does not necessarily offer better performance. Further, larger group size offers better frequency diversity and at higher Eb /No it is better to have higher frequency spreading with lower time spreading as also reported in [55]. The optimal power allocation strategy is not dependent on different spreading factors, but the power allocation affects differently at the extreme power allocation conditions ( 0/1) for different spreading schemes.

Chapter Summary

We first proposed a cooperative CSI-based channel allocation algorithm for an OFCDMbased two-hop decode-and-forward relay system. Its BER performance was evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation. In the case of equal confidence given at the base station receiver for the source and its partner's forwarded data in a decode-and-forward OFCDM two-hop relay diversity system, CSI of the source-relay link (with lower cooperative CSI ) influences the channel allocation at moderate to high Eb /No values. Further, when channel allocation is done giving higher weight on the CSI of the link sbs (as  is increased) the time-frequency spreading cross-over point moves towards lower Eb /No values. Secondly we evaluated the power allocation schemes. There is an optimal power allocation between the source node and the relay node and that varies for different operating Eb /No values. When all three links have equal gains, the optimal power allocation ratio is 0.8. Further, if a system has better sr link, it will improve the performance at lower Eb /No values but not the interference-limited error floor. For a such system, at lower Eb /No values, the optimal power allocation ratio is 0.65. Further, the optimal power allocation strategy is not highly dependent on different time-frequency spreading factors. We can conclude from the above results that optimal power allocation between the sourcerelay nodes combined with proper channel allocation significantly improves the system performance of an OFCDM based decode-and-forward relay network. This concept can be applied to the overlay cognitive system where the cognitive user acts as relay and assisting the primary user transmission. As the future work, the throughput performance of the overlay cognitive radio can be analyzed with the proposed channel and power allocation schemes.

Chapter 6 Conclusions and Future work
This dissertation mainly focused on channel access in cognitive radio communication. The main contributions of this dissertation are summarized as follows with the discussion of the future work:

6.1

Summary

First we considered an interweave cognitive radio system where cognitive user can only access the channel when the primary user is not active. As interfering with the primary user is strictly prohibited, cognitive user senses the channel every time before it transmits. In practice, cognitive user can sense only one channel at a time. Therefore, we considered first, an interweave cognitive radio system where a primary user accesses two primary channels. We developed an access scheme that considers primary user's occupancy and cognitive user's channel gain prediction in order to get an optimal channel switching threshold to maximize the cognitive user throughput. We mainly focused on a positively correlated primary user traffic. It was found that, when the primary user traffic is highly correlated or cognitive user is more dynamic (higher Doppler spread), it is not beneficial to switch the channel 108

frequently in order to gain long term throughput advantage. From our analysis, given that primary user occupancy statistics and cognitive user's relative movements (Doppler spread) are given, the proposed access scheme would instruct cognitive user to leave the current channel when its received SNR is below a certain threshold even if that channel is idle. We further investigated the channel access in a hybrid interweave-underlay cognitive radio system. Based on the primary user traffic characteristics and throughput ratio between the interweave and underlay mode of transmission, we proposed a transmission mode switching strategy between interweave and underlay modes. It was shown that, proper transmission mode selection based on our proposed access scheme can provide better throughput. In the previous analysis, we assumed perfect sensing but in practice, it is not true. Hence, we analyzed the performance of a hybrid interweave-underlay cognitive radio system with imperfect sensing. We formulated the problem as partially observable Markov decision process. We studied two policies in order to track the belief; while first technique requires channel to be sensed in each time-slot, second technique requires channel sensing in the first time-slot only. In other time-slots of a frame, ACK/NAK feedback from previous slot is used in the latter technique. We evaluated the throughput and the collision performances of both policies and compared them with fully observable optimal policy. Simulation results showed that the proposed frame-based sensing with ACK/NACK feedback policy is more throughput efficient than the policy with sensing every slot, specially when the primary user traffic is correlated and/or frame size is smaller. Later we investigated the channel and power allocation on a cognitive relay based network. As in overlay cognitive radio systems, the relay nodes assist the primary transmission. We did the preliminary analysis on a decode-and-forward relay network with orthogonal frequency and code division multiplexing access scheme (OFCDM). We proposed a adaptive channel allocation scheme based on the channel gains between the source-destination and 109

source-cognitive relay node links. Also we proposed, how the frequency-time spreading need to be done based on the channel gains of source-destination and source-relay links. Apart from that, to achieve the better overall throughput, how the power should be allocated between source and relays nodes were also analyzed. Further, it was found that, the optimal power allocation strategy is not highly dependent on different time-frequency spreading factors. We observed that optimal power allocation between the source-relay nodes combined with proper channel allocation significantly improves the system performance of an OFCDM based decode-and-forward relay network.

6.2

Future Work

Even though several research contributions have been made in this dissertation for cognitive radio access schemes, there are a number of research topics to be explored as extensions of this work. We assumed that cognitive user can sense only one channel at once, but there are many schemes with cooperative sensing and multiples channel sensing at a time in the literature. Performance improvement in the proposed access schemes with cooperative sensing needs to be evaluated. We considered only the interweave-underlay hybrid system, but in the future, cognitive radio should be more flexible to select the transmission modes between interweave-underlay-overlay. We would like to extend our work to a generalized framework for transmission mode selection with imperfect sensing Our research work rely on the availability/estimation of the primary user traffic characteristics. Uncertainty analysis on that parameter would be beneficial. We did most of the analysis on a positively correlated primary user traffic environment. Even though the analysis is similar, it is better to have and validate the findings on negatively correlated traffic. We have done channel-power allocation 110

on decode-and-forward OFCDM based relay network. This work can be extended on overlay network focusing on interference limitation to the primary receiver with different coding techniques.
