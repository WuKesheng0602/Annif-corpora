Abstract    
   A  post-occupancy  evaluation  (POE)  is  a  comprehensive  building  performance  review   that  includes  occupant  surveys  and  provides  feedback  on  the  overall  success  of  a   building  design  in  addressing  end-user  requirements.  In  doing  so,  POE  often  identifies   disparities  between  expected  and  actual  energy  usage  patterns.  Part  of  determining   the  source  of  these  disparities  is  the  evaluation  of  tenant  responses.  Since  these  are   heavily  dependent  on  the  users'  ability  to  accurately  recall  their  usage  patterns,  their   potential  inaccuracy  may  misinform  building  retrofits  and  future  projects.  This  study   seeks  to  compare  occupant  self-assessed  behaviour  to  actual  metered  consumption.      A  recently  retrofit  multi-unit  residential  building  (MURB)  and  Tower  Renewal  pilot   project  was  selected  for  the  evaluation,  and  access  to  the  electricity  consumption  of   the  pilot  was  obtained  from  building  management.  The  project  has  146  units,  each   approximately  20.5m2,  whose  electricity  consumption  is  metered  individually.  These   readings  are  done  electronically,  and  the  data  goes  back  to  October  2010.  Individual   unit  electricity  loading  and  a  holistic  building  consumption  parameters  were  analyzed   based  on  metered  utilities  and  were  found  to  fall  within  the  average  consumption   values  for  buildings  of  equivalent  type  and  vintage  in  Ontario  (78.59  kWh/m2/year   and  192  ekWh/m2/year  respectively).  It  was  also  determined  that  no  other  formal   parameters  affect  electricity  loading  in  the  individual  units.        A  post-retrofit  survey  has  been  carried  out,  which  amongst  other  factors  attempted  to   collect  information  on  small  appliances  and  electronics  and  their  use.  48  valid   samples  were  obtained.  The  monthly  electricity  consumption  of  each  unit  has  been   calculated  based  on  the  tenant  responses,  and  these  values  have  been  compared  to   actual  consumption  values  from  the  electronic  meters.  The  average  estimated   consumption  was  found  to  be  45%  more  than  the  average  metered  consumption,  with   46%  of  the  survey-based  estimates  exceeding  their  respective  metered  readings  by   more  than  50%.  As  many  as  86%  of  tenants  whose  consumption  estimate  exceeded   50%  of  the  metered  value  incurred  time  overestimation,  while  23%  incurred   statistical  bias.  It  was  also  found  that  all  tenants  who  incurred  statistical  bias  also   incurred  time  overestimation.        While  individual  estimates  tend  to  disagree  with  metered  data,  large-sample   assessments  may  still  be  possible.  Mode-based  assessments  help  to  limit  sources  of   discrepancy  by  eliminating  tenant  responses  that  occur  infrequently,  thus  creating   sample  cases  that  resemble  the  contents  of  a  `typical  unit'.  However,  great  care  must   be  taken  to  avoid  introducing  further  bias.  To  this  end,  more  rigorous  statistical   analysis  is  required.  It  is  recommended  that  future  surveys  avoid  overestimation  by   arranging  time-related  questions  in  a  manner  that  allows  quick  revision,  tightening   the  ranges  for  usage  questions  to  minimize  assumptions  made,  and  including  relevant   custom-made  questions  that  either  clarify  questions  for  the  tenants  or  minimize   ambiguity  in  the  results.

1.  Introduction:  Tower  Renewal  Project  and  Post  Occupancy  Evaluation  
   Energy  performance  has  become  an  increasingly  important  parameter  in  building   design,  particularly  in  projects  where  construction  and  operational  (consumption)   costs  are  shouldered  by  the  same  entity.  While  the  current  crop  of  Multi-Unit   Residential  Buildings  (MURB's)  in  Toronto  does  not  follow  this  payment  structure,  the   same  cannot  be  said  of  the  older  building  stock  in  the  city,  namely  towers  built   between  the  50's  and  80's.  There  are  more  than  1,000  apartment  towers  that  fit  these   criteria  in  Toronto,  and  the  trend  to  construct  high-density  residential  structures  has   only  increased  over  time  (City  of  Toronto,  2012).  The  problem  is  that  the  majority  of   towers  built  between  the  50's  and  80's  were  designed  under  the  assumption  that   energy  costs  would  remain  relatively  low,  which  resulted  in  the  construction  of  a   number  of  towers  host  to  vast  energy  inefficiencies  (City  of  Toronto,  2012).  Many  of   these  towers  have  since  become  rental  properties,  often  subsidized  by  the  city,   making  energy  inefficiencies  both  an  environmental  and  capital  burden  on  the  city   (City  of  Toronto,  2012).          The  Tower  Renewal  Project  (TRP)  was  introduced  in  2007  to  provide  solutions  to  this   problem,  resolving  issues  ranging  from  poor  insulation  values  in  towers,  to  improved   mechanical  systems,  higher  quality  indoor  environment  and  build  new  communities   (City  of  Toronto,  2012).  To  this  end,  the  TRP  has  set  in  motion  a  number  of  pilot   projects  to  determine  the  proper  course  of  action  in  retrofitting  Toronto's  towers,  and   assessing  the  cost  efficiency  of  such  a  process  (City  of  Toronto,  2012).  This  study  will   make  use  of  the  consumption  parameters  for  one  of  these  pilots,  referred  to  as  "Green   Project"  (GP).

2.  State  of  the  Art  ­  Background      
2.1.  Importance  of  Post  Occupancy  Evaluation  
   Simulated  building  performance  during  the  design  stage  often  differs  from  actual   building  performance.  This  difference,  referred  to  as  the  `performance  gap',  has  been   the  subject  of  a  multitude  of  studies  and  has  been  generally  attributed  to  the   unrealistic  input  parameters  pertaining  to  occupant  behavior  (Menezes,  Cripps,   Bouchlaghem,  &  Buswell,  Predicted  vs.  actual  energy  performance  of  non-domestic   buildings:  Using  post-occupancy  evaluation  data  to  reduce  the  performance  gap,   2010).  To  minimize  the  gap,  post  occupancy  evaluations  (POE's)  have  been  designed   as  a  holistic  building  evaluation  tool  that  includes,  amongst  other  items,  actual  energy   use  data  and  operator/  manager  and  occupant  surveys.  The  content  of  the  surveys   determines  the  occupant  satisfaction  in  the  designed  spaces  and  is  a  powerful  tool  in   determining  design  shortcomings,  which  in  turn  may  be  used  to  resolve  problems  in   the  existing  design  and  to  set  the  criteria  for  future  projects  (Zagreus,  Huizenga,   Arens,  &  Lehrer,  2004).    However,  the  validity  of  the  occupant  surveys,  and   subsequently  the  opportunity  for  improvement  based  on  these  findings,  depends   entirely  on  the  accuracy  of  responses  given  by  occupants.  The  validity  of  these   responses,  specifically  when  it  comes  to  energy  consumption  questions,  has  not  been   brought  into  question.  Determining  the  difference  between  these  responses  and   metered  values  is  the  subject  of  this  study.          To  establish  the  relationship  between  occupant  responses  and  consumption,  the   building  must  be  assessed  holistically  to  ensure  no  externalities  affect  the   consumption  parameters,  and  individual  units'  plug  loading  must  be  evaluated  to   ensure  it  falls  within  range  of  an  acceptable  benchmark.    

2.2.  Total  Energy  Consumption  Benchmarks  

   The  literature  suggests  that,  independently  of  individual  tenant  behavior,  there  are   two  major  factors  that  determine  a  MURB's  energy  consumption:  vintage  and  tenancy   type  (CMHC,  2000)  (Office  of  Energy  Efficiency,  2012)  (RDH  Group,  2011).  The   findings  by  CMHC  through  the  HiSTAR  database  suggest  that  seniors  consume  the   most  energy  (281ekWh/m2/year),  followed  by  singles  (221ekWh/m2/year),  and   family  households  (163ekWh/m2/year).  This  is  likely  the  effect  of  family  apartments   being  larger  (2+  bedrooms)  than  single  and  senior  apartments  (1  bedroom  or   bachelor)  while  maintaining  relatively  similar  energy  requirements.      In  terms  of  vintage,  results  vary  depending  on  the  study  being  carried  out.        HiSTAR:  40  MURB's  across  Canada,    12'000  units,  total  average  279ekWh/m2/year   Buildings  built  between  1961  and  1980  -  212ekWh/m2/year   Buildings  built  between  1981  and  1993  -  317ekWh/m2/year

   Table  1:  Whole  Building  Consumption  Benchmarks  (ekWh/m2)  

   Differences  between  the  studies  can  be  attributed  to  sample  size,  sample  type  and   averaging  method.  Both  the  CMHC  and  RDH  studies  involved  relatively  small  samples   and  grouped  buildings  by  vintage.  However,  while  the  CHMC  study  selected   apartment  buildings  at  random  throughout  the  country,  RDH  worked  with  buildings   within  the  Vancouver  region  exclusively.  Since  neither  study  factored  in  the  effect  of   weather,  the  data  sets  are  difficult  to  compare.  It  is  possible  that  the  higher   consumption  values  obtained  by  CMHC  are  the  result  of  using  only  apartment   buildings  (rental  properties,  likely  including  utility  fees  in  the  rental  agreement,  thus   discouraging  energy  saving  strategies)  and  using  samples  from  significantly  colder   locations  in  the  country,  which  drive  up  consumption  values.  The  OEE  study  is  the   most  robust,  but  also  the  least  specific.  While  the  sample  size  is  significantly  larger   than  both  CHMC  and  RDH,  and  is  located  in  Ontario,  the  study  groups  buildings   incrementally  rather  than  isolating  building  samples  by  vintage.  The  consumption   value  is  thus  an  aggregate  and  is  not  representative  of  any  particular  vintage  but  of   the  building  stock  at  any  given  time.        The  3  studies  provide  a  general  idea  of  where  the  consumption  of  GP  should  be.  OEE   sets  a  general  performance  standard  for  the  retrofit.  Carried  out  in  2009,  the  GP   retrofit  should  aim  to  meet  or  exceed  the  consumption  average  for  the  building  stock   at  this  time.  The  studies  by  RHD  and  CMHC  supplement  the  findings  of  OEE  by   outlining  project-specific  tolerances,  such  as  the  impact  of  rental  vs  owned,  and  age   group.

2.3.  Electricity  Consumption  Benchmarks    
   The  electricity  consumption  of  individual  units  in  MURB's  is  a  function  of  both  usage   and  individual  loads,  resulting  in  a  wide  data  range.  As  such,  establishing  a   comparable  benchmark  may  be  difficult  given  the  variation,  and  only  be   approximated  through  statistical  analysis.  While  this  method  may  fail  to  provide  a   bias-free  comparison,  it  is  assumed  that  using  a  `per-household'  comparison  should   yield  approximately  equivalent  results  (CMHC,  2000)  (Office  of  Energy  Efficiency,   2012).  Based  on  the  total  building  stock  in  2009,  the  OEE  has  assembled  MURB   energy  consumption  data  into  5  separate  categories:  space  heating,  water  heating,   appliances,  lighting,  and  space  cooling  (47,  30,  19,  2,  and  2%  respectively)(See  Figure   1).  These  values  include  all  energy  usage,  regardless  of  source  type.  Separately,  the   OEE  groups  MURB  energy  usage  by  energy  type  into  5  categories:  electricity,  natural   gas,  heating  oil,  other,  and  wood  (31,  63,  2,  1,  and  3%  respectively)(See  Figure  2).   Finally,  the  OEE  has  determined  the  average  annual  energy  consumption  of  MURB's  to   be  202.78ekWh/m2  and  16,111.11ekWh/unit,  suggesting  the  average  unit  size   (including  common  areas  distributed  equally  amongst  the  units)  is  79.5m2.  These  sets   of  data  must  be  looked  at  simultaneously  to  determine  a  suitable  set  of  benchmarks   applicable  to  GP,  namely  total  annual  average-unit  energy  consumption  as  described   above,  and  annual  average-unit  electricity  consumption  (63.67kWh/m2  and   5,058.89kWh/unit)  based  on  the  whole  building  consumption.  Obtaining  benchmark   parameters  at  the  unit  level  using  the  OEE  database  is  difficult,  namely  because   consumption  values  do  not  specifically  state  if  common  elements,  such  as  lighting  and   mechanical  equipment,  are  included  in  the  categories  and  averaged  across  all  units,  or   if  the  values  are  exclusively  in-unit  parameters.  Furthermore,  it  is  difficult  to   adequately  address  certain  parameters,  particularly  heating  and  cooling  loads,  since   the  system  implemented  at  GP  uses  both  gas  consumption  at  the  boilers  (usually   grouped  into  `space  heating')  and  electricity  consumption  at  both  the  fan-coil  units   (usually  grouped  into  `appliance'  or  `plug  loading')  and  the  geothermal  setup   (grouped  into  `space  heating').

The  study  by  CMHC  did  not  implicitly  provide  a  study-wide  `total  consumption  per   unit'  parameter,  but  it  did  indicate  the  total  consumption  per  unit  averaged  by   building  vintage.  These  values  were  22,266ekWh/unit  for  the  26  buildings  built   between  1961  and  1980,  and  21,437ekWh/unit  for  the  9  buildings  sampled  from   1980  to  present.  An  equivalent  building  stock  average,  taking  into  account  the   number  of  buildings  sampled  and  the  respective  vintage  averages,  yields   approximately  22,052ekWh/unit.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  this  average   assumes  an  equal  number  of  units  in  each  building  sampled,  which  is  not  necessarily   correct,  and  therefore  is  only  an  approximation.  Once  again,  the  value  obtained  by   CMHC  is  37%  higher  than  that  of  OEE.  Further  suggesting  the  studies  are   incomparable.          The  study  by  RDH  separated  the  total  energy  consumption  (222ekWh/m2/year)  into   9  categories:  ventilation  and  heating,  DWH,  lights  (common),  lights  (unit),  plug  and   appliances  (unit),  equipment  and  amenity  (common),  elevators,  electric  baseboard   heating,  and  fireplaces  (39,  9,  2,  7,  9,  9,  1,  8,  and  16%  respectively)(See  Figure  3).   From  this  study  the  following  benchmarks  can  be  derived:  in-suit  lighting   consumption  (15.54kWh/m2)  and  in-unit  plug+appliance  consumption   (19.98kWh/m2).  Once  again  there  are  issues  separating  the  electricity  loading   resulting  from  the  fans  in  the  fan-coil  units  from  the  gas  consumption  at  the  boilers.   Furthermore,  since  the  study  by  RDH  did  not  address  a  total  consumption/unit   parameter,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  how  this  study  compares  to  GP  or  the  findings  by   OEE  and  CMHC.

3.  Research  Question  and  Scope    
   Thorough  post  occupancy  evaluations  seek  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of   measures  implemented  in  these  pilot  projects,  and  are  essential  to  the  optimization   and  replication  of  favourable  results.  However,  without  more  extensive  monitoring,   plug-loading  analysis  relies  on  tenants'  ability  to  accurately  recall  their  usage   patterns.  This  study  seeks  to  compare  occupant  self-assessed  behaviour  to  actual   metered  consumption.  As  such,  the  scope  of  this  study  will  be  limited  to  the  analysis   of  electricity  consumption  by  tenants  and  the  occupant  survey  carried  out  in  the   midrise  pilot  project  (Roque,  Straka,  &  Fung,  2012).  Gas  data  will  only  be  used  to   establish  the  consumption  of  the  pilot  project  against  the  building  stock  as  a  whole.   Other  parameters,  particularly  those  relating  to  socio-cultural  aspects  of  the  occupant   survey,  will  be  omitted  from  this  study  in  an  effort  to  limit  the  variables  present  in  the   system  and  provide  a  simpler  benchmark  for  future  studies  to  explore  in  greater   detail.

4.  Pilot  Project  
4.1.  Building  History  
   The  pilot  project  under  question  is  in  fact  not  a  single  building  but  two  buildings,  a   mid-rise  tower  built  in  1976  and  a  low-rise  housing  development  acquired  in  2006   but  of  equivalent  vintage.  The  tower  houses  136  units,  each  approximately  20.5m2,   while  the  lower  structure  houses  10  apartments  ranging  from  27  to  57.5m2.  As  of   2008,  both  structures  are  serviced  by  the  same  mechanical  systems  and  are  invoiced   together,  totaling  5,727m2  of  gross  floor  area.    According  to  the  "Green  Project"   Foundation  (GPF)  the  idea  to  retrofit  the  facilities  dates  back  to  2002,  however  the   plan  was  not  put  into  motion  until  the  possibility  of  funding  through  the  TRP  was   made  available  in  early  2007.  Further  contributions  in  the  forms  of  fundraising  and   investment  by  the  owning  corporation  have  been  on-going  from  2006  through  to   2009,  when  the  retrofit  project  was  made  possible  (GPF,  2012).    Table  2  describes  the   floor  areas  as  calculated  from  the  as-built  drawings  provided.

4.2.  Renovation  and  Consumption  
   Renovations  to  the  property  began  in  March  2009,  and  were  carried  through  until   June  2010,  when  the  retrofit  was  deemed  complete.  The  renovation  included  the   upgrade  of  windows  (  U-value  of  2W/m2K),  wall  assemblies  (RSI  of  6.47m2K/W)  and   mechanical  upgrades  from  electric-baseboard  heaters  to  hydronic  fan-coil  units  (See   Appendix  A)  in  the  tower  and  in-floor  heating  for  the  low-rise,  both  supplemented  by  

  

7  

geothermal  and  solar  thermal  DHWH  (GPF,  2012).  Ventilation  was  upgraded  to   include  a  7000cfm  air-handling  unit  with  enthalpy  recovery  (See  Appendix  B).  The   system  is  designed  to  supply  the  hallways  of  the  tower  with  fresh  air,  leak  into  the   units  and  get  ducted  back,  along  with  exhaust  from  bathrooms  and  kitchens,  to  the   rooftop  unit  for  enthalpy  recovery  before  being  exhausted  out.  The  total  cost  of  the   project  is  approximately  $7.5  Million  (GPF,  2012).  A  summary  of  the  retrofit  condition   can  be  seen  on  Appendix  C.      Electricity  consumption  drives  the  fan-coil  units  and  plug  loads,  while  gas   consumption  drives  the  pre-heated  boiler  draw  for  all  hot  water  supply  to  the  units.   During  the  summer,  no  natural  gas  is  required  to  heat  the  showers  and  sinks,  as  100%   of  this  load  is  supplied  by  the  solar-plate  collectors  (M,  2011-2012).  The  system  has   been  designed  to  have  no  cooling  other  than  whatever  can  be  supplied  through  the   geothermal  setup,  with  an  air  supply  ranging  from  170C  to  190C  during  the  cooling   season,  which  has  been  deemed  insufficient  by  tenants  and  building  management  (M,   2011-2012).        Since  then,  there  have  been  a  number  of  rounds  of  commissioning  ending  as  recent  as   early  2011  (GPF,  2012).  The  extended  commissioning  process  was  the  result  of   inconsistencies  between  the  modeled  consumption  estimates  and  the  actual   consumption  values  in  the  building.  Many  of  these  inconsistencies  have  since  been   addressed,  however  a  few  issues  are  still  under  investigation.  Most  notably,  issues   with  the  boiler  valves  and  the  untimely  operation  of  the  heat  recovery  system  on  the   roof  have  caused  dramatic  spikes  in  the  electricity  and  gas  consumption,  particularly   in  the  summer  of  2010,  when  gas  consumption  spiked  due  to  a  leaky  valve.  As  a  result,   most  of  the  post-retrofit  consumption  data  available  for  analysis  has  been   compromised,  as  it  does  not  represent  the  design  intent  of  the  retrofit,  or  the  capacity   of  the  system  under  proper  operation  (M,  2011-2012).  For  this  reason,  the  data   samples  to  be  used  will  limit  pre-retrofit  data  to  the  data  collected  in  2008,  as  it  is  the   only  whole-year  sample  that  includes  both  buildings  before  the  retrofit.  The  data   samples  used  to  represent  the  post-retrofit  condition  will  include  data  collected   starting  in  2011,  as  it  reflects  the  retrofit  capacity  far  more  accurately  than  previous   years.  Even  so,  some  minor  details  are  currently  under  commissioning,  namely  issues   with  the  lack  of  fresh  air  infiltration  from  the  supply  point  at  the  hallways  into  the   units  (M,  2011-2012).    As  part  of  the  ongoing  review  of  GP's  performance,  Miles   Roque  carried  out  an  occupant  survey  in  early  2012.  This  survey,  presented  in  `Survey   Of  Household  Energy  Use  In  A  Rental  High-Rise  Multi-Unit  Residential  Building  (MURB)'   will  be  one  of  the  primary  sources  used  for  this  analysis  (See  Appendix  D).

5.  Methodology  
5.1.  Whole  Building  Analysis    
   First,  it  must  be  established  that  the  building  as  a  whole  is  not  host  to  abnormal   consumption  patterns  resulting  from  the  building's  characteristics  rather  than  the   occupants'  behavior.  To  this  end,  the  energy  performance  of  the  building  has  been   evaluated  and  compared  to  a  suitable  set  of  benchmarks.  Furthermore,  unit   consumption  patterns  have  been  evaluated  to  establish  abnormalities  resulting  from   formal  bias  such  as  orientation  and  vertical  placement  within  the  structure  (impact  of   stack  effect),  as  well  as  the  thermal  difference  between  external  and  internal  walls.     5.1.1.  Whole-Building  Consumption      The  holistic  energy  analysis  is  comprised  of  energy  consumption  bills  for  the  years   2008,  2011  and  2012.  This  includes  electricity  invoices  from  Toronto  Hydro  (See   Appendix  E)  natural  gas  invoices  from  Enbridge  Inc.  (See  Appendix  F).  Based  on  these,   the  total  energy  intensity  at  GP  has  been  established  and  compared  to  suitable   benchmarks.     5.1.2.  Consumption  Distribution  Assessment        Once  the  building  benchmark  was  determined  and  compared  to  a  suitable  sample  set,   the  actual  consumption  at  the  unit  level  was  analyzed.  This  process  served  to   determine  the  relationship  between  three  parameters  in  relation  to  consumption   levels:  orientation,  season,  and  floor  elevation  using  the  electronic  monthly  readings   collected  for  each  unit  (See  Appendix  G).  This  whole-building  analysis  compared  the   total  monthly  consumption  average  of  units  facing  East  and  units  facing  West  to   determine  an  overall  trend.  Monthly  averages  were  then  be  grouped  into  seasonal   averages  in  order  to  determine  correlations  between  consumption,  season  and   orientation.  A  floor-by-floor  analysis  was  then  be  carried  out  in  the  same  manner  as   the  whole  building  analysis.  Finally,  the  annual  consumption  averages  per  unit  will  be   plotted  on  the  building  floor  plans,  and  analyzed  for  consumption  patterns.     

5.2  Consumption  Matrix    
   In  order  to  objectively  compare  tenant  survey  responses  to  actual  consumption   readings,  a  matrix  has  been  constructed  using  three  primary  parameters:  tenant   responses,  plug-load  consumption  rates,  and  actual  consumption  values  obtained   from  the  electronic  meters.  Tenant  responses  from  the  survey  provide  up  to  28   different  loads  types  present  in  the  units,  from  TV's  to  cell  phone  chargers  to  fans.  The   survey  may  also  supply  usage  times  for  a  number  of  these  loads,  such  as  stoves,  or  it   may  not,  as  is  the  case  with  toaster  ovens,  coffee  makers,  and  other  smaller   equipment.  These  load  types  are  then  converted  into  consumption  values  using  the   particular  appliance  specification  or  a  statistically  derived  consumption  rate  from  a     

9  

reliable  database.  For  load  types  whose  usage  has  been  specified  by  the  survey,  this   consumption  rate  takes  the  form  of  wattage,  otherwise  consumption  values  are   statistical  values  in  kWh/month.  The  matrix  then  takes  these  parameters  and   calculates  the  various  consumption  values  for  each  load  type  and  a  total  monthly   consumption  for  each  unit.  These  values  are  then  compared  to  their  respective   metered  values,  and  the  whole-sample  estimation  average  is  compared  to  the  whole- sample  metered  average,  obtaining  a  relative  summary  of  the  matrix  findings.       

5.3  Matrix  Assessment  
   The  matrix  is  made  up  of  a  number  of  variables,  some  of  which  are  specifically   defined,  such  as  the  stove  and  fridge,  and  some  that  are  not,  such  as  fans  and  toasters.   This  ambiguity  extends  beyond  load  types  to  include  usage  times.  Not  only  are  some   usage  times  undefined,  but  those  specifically  addressed  by  the  survey  take  the  form  of   ranges  rather  than  single  numbers.  Further  complicating  the  assessment  are  those   assumptions  required  to  provide  the  matrix  with  sufficient  information  to  calculate   consumption  values,  such  as  the  size  of  the  average  TV  and  the  usage  time  for   personal  heaters  and  fans.  While  it  may  be  impossible  to  address  the  accuracy  of  the   matrix  without  extensive  monitoring  and  a  superior  inventory  of  loads,  a  few  `checks'   have  been  built  into  the  matrix  in  order  to  reduce  the  effect  of  ambiguity  and  explore   the  possible  range  of  responses.      5.3.1  Matrix  Range        Because  load  usage  responses  were  given  in  the  form  of  rages,  the  matrix  has  been   constructed  as  three  separate  instances:  the  lower-bound,  the  average,  and  the  upper- bound.  As  an  example,  if  a  tenant  responded  their  TV  usage  is  1  to  3  hours,  the  lower- bound  matrix  uses  1h,  the  average  matrix  uses  2,  and  the  upper-bound  matrix  uses  3.   Results  obtained  from  the  lower-bound  matrix  determine  the  lowest  possible   outcome  of  the  matrix  in  the  assumption  that  all  other  parameters  are  consistent.   Inversely,  the  upper-bound  matrix  provides  the  largest  possible  outcome.  The  average   matrix  provides  results  in  the  middle,  and  is  arguably  the  most  reliable  given  a  large   enough  sample.  However,  it  is  worth  noting  that  results  can  fall  anywhere  between   the  lower  and  upper  bounds.  The  average  is  simply  the  point  in  the  middle  and  is  not   necessarily  the  most  accurate.        5.3.2  Case-based  Assessment      Since  this  study  seeks  to  determine  the  difference  between  survey  based  estimates   and  actual  metered  values,  the  assessment  has  been  prepared  to  handle  the  possible   outcomes:  tenants  are  unable  to  estimate  their  consumption  (over/underestimate)  or   tenants  are  able  to  predict  their  consumption  within  a  certain  tolerance.  This   assessment  strategy  has  been  organized  into  three  separate  cases,  each  designed  to  

  

10  

summarize  the  overall  performance  of  tenants  during  the  survey  while  attempting  to   limit  the  effect  of  possible  sources  of  bias  and  estimation  issues.        Case  1:  Survey  Mode   Case  1  is  set  up  the  same  way  as  the  individual  unit  assessments,  having  a  set  of  load   types  and  usage  times,  ultimately  resulting  in  a  total  monthly  consumption  parameter.   Both  the  load  types  and  the  usage  times  in  case  1  have  been  selected  based  on  the   survey  responses  that  appear  most  often  either  in  the  survey  (when  parameters  were   specifically  addressed)  or  in  the  matrix  (when  parameters  were  determined  through     assumptions).  For  example,  the  most  common  response  to  the  question  "What  type  of   TV  do  you  own?"  was  LED/LCD,  and  the  most  common  response  to  TV  usage  was  2h.   Based  on  these  two  pieces  of  data,  the  matrix  calculates  the  case  1  TV  load  on  a   monthly  basis  as  it  did  with  the  individual  units.  In  short,  case  1  is  the  collection  of   modes  for  the  questions  present  in  the  survey.  Whenever  a  load  type  mode  is  `0'  or  `no   load',  as  is  the  case  with  stereo  systems,  any  potential  usage  time  associated  with  the   load  is  disregarded,  since  technically  there  is  no  appliance  to  operate.  It  is  worth   noting  that  the  selected  values  that  make  up  case  1  are  the  modes  for  each  question,   not  averages.        The  value  of  case  1  lies  in  that  it  nulls  the  effect  of  unusually  high  or  low  usage  time   responses  without  the  requirement  for  a  larger  sample  group.  Likewise,  using  the   load  type  mode  allows  case  1  to  null  the  effect  of  load  types  that  are  uncommon,  such   as  game  consoles  and  stereo  systems.  Ultimately,  case  1  represents  the  `basic  unit',  a   collection  of  the  most  common  loads  and  usage  times.  Because  case  1  is  ultimately  the   bare-bones  scenario,  it  will  always  be  at  the  lower  end  of  all  matrix  instances.   Case  2:  Load  Mode  +  Usage  Average     Case  2  is  very  similar  to  case  1,  as  it  is  comprised  of  a  set  of  loads  types  and  usage   times,  ultimately  resulting  in  a  total  monthly  consumption  parameter.  However,  while   case  2  uses  modes  to  select  the  load  types,  it  uses  whole-sample  averages  to   determine  those  loads'  usage  times.    For  example,  the  most  common  response  to  the   question  "What  type  of  TV  do  you  own?"  was  LED/LCD,  and  the  average  TV  usage   across  the  sample  was  3.5h.  The  difference  between  cases  1  and  2  is  subtle,  but  the   result  can  be  significant.  Like  case  1,  case  2  constructs  a  summary  of  the  loads  most   commonly  found  in  a  unit,  but  by  using  the  average  usage  times  rather  than  the   modes,  case  2  allows  unusually  high  and  low  time  usage  estimates  to  affect  the  result.   This  is  critical  because  the  reality  is  that  while  most  people  use  their  appliances  for  a   particular  length  of  time  (2h  for  TV  sets),  over-users  and  under-users  affect  the   overall  consumption  that  can  be  attributed  to  this  load  type,  a  fact  that  case  1  does  not   address.  For  this  reason,  case  2  creates  a  summary  of  monthly  loads  that  will  more   closely  resemble  the  sample  average.       

  

11  

Case  3:  Survey  Average   Unlike  cases  1  and  2,  case  3  does  not  address  load  type  or  usage  time  responses.  Case   3  is  constructed  from  the  averages  for  each  load  type  across  the  matrix,  for  example:   the  average  TV-related  consumption  across  the  matrix  was  16kWh/month/unit.   These  load  consumption  averages  are  then  added  into  a  total  average   consumption/unit  value,  which  is  a  summary  of  the  matrix  results.  Because  this  case   only  looks  at  the  consumption  values  calculated  across  the  matrix,  it  accounts  for  all   eccentricities  present  in  the  survey,  both  by  load  type  and  usage  time,  and  therefore  is   a  direct  representation  of  the  whole  matrix,  rather  than  any  particular  unit.  As  such,   this  case  most  clearly  displays  trends  present  in  matrix,  and  when  compared  to  the   metered  sample  average,  provides  the  clearest  answer  to  the  research  question.        Important  Note:  Mode  Bias      Earlier  it  was  mentioned  that  there  may  be  a  significant  difference  between  averages   and  modes.  This  difference  is  directly  dependent  on  how  often  the  mode  repeats  itself   within  the  sample,  with  a  low  recurrence  resulting  in  a  higher  difference  between  the   sample  average  and  the  sample  mode.  This  difference  will  be  referred  to  as  `mode   bias'.  To  illustrate  this  bias,  consider  the  following  example:  5  tenants  are  asked  the   question  "On  an  average  day,  how  many  hours  do  you  spend  watching  TV?"  and  their   answers  are  0h,  1h,  1h,  5h,  and  10h.  For  this  particular  set  of  responses,  the  mode  is   1h  because  it  is  the  answer  that  came  up  most  often,  and  the  recurrence  of  this  mode   is  40%.  However,  the  average  for  the  same  set  is  3.4h.  This  difference  can  be  rather   substantial,  and  affect  the  assessment  by  large  factors,  resulting  in  a  severe   underestimation  of  the  average  consumption.  Mode-based  assessments  can  be   strengthened  by  having  larger  sample  sets  (in  which  case  averages  also  work  well)  or   by  ensuring  the  mode  recurrence  is  high  (reducing  the  possible  responses).  Because   cases  1  and  2  are  mode-based,  they  are  susceptible  to  this  form  of  bias,  with  the   impact  being  directly  depended  on  the  mode  recurrence  for  each  survey  question.

6.  Results  and  Analysis  
6.1  Whole  Building  Energy  Assessment      
   The  holistic  energy  analysis  is  comprised  of  a  total  of  43  readings,  27  electricity   invoices  (See  Appendix  E)  and  16  natural  gas  invoices  (See  Appendix  F).  Figure  4   shows  an  electricity  consumption  spike  during  the  heating  season  in  2008  that  is   absent  in  the  post-retrofit  condition.  This  is  because  the  2008  system  utilizes   baseboard  heaters  as  the  primary  source  of  heat-generation,  while  the  post-retrofit   condition  utilizes  only  as  much  electricity  as  is  needed  to  run  the  fans  in  the  fan-coil   units.  The  increased  electricity  consumption  during  the  cooling  season  for  2011   compared  to  2008  is  likely  the  result  of  the  geothermal  electricity  consumption   (pumps  and  fans)  and  the  retrofit  system's  inability  to  generate  sufficient  cooling   power,  forcing  tenants  to  install  fans  and  window-mounted  AC  units  despite   management's  best  efforts  to  limit  this  kind  of  behavior  (M,  2011-2012).  Overall,  the   retrofit  has  resulted  in  an  electricity  loading  reduction  from  736,000kWh/year  to   692,000kWh/year,  a  6%  reduction.

Gas  consumption  goes  through  highs  and  lows  depending  on  climatic  conditions.  In   2008,  natural  gas  loading  is  determined  exclusively  by  the  hot  water  supply  to  the   rooftop  unit  and  to  the  tanks  supplying  showers  and  sinks;  so  it  is  not  surprising  that   Figure  5  shows  consumption  spikes  during  the  heating  season.  Gas  consumption  is   significantly  lower  during  the  cooling  season,  as  it  is  only  being  used  to  supply  hot   water  to  sinks  and  showers  (Cobalt  Engineering,  2006).  In  the  post-retrofit  condition,   gas  consumption  during  the  cooling  season  drops  dramatically  because  gas  is  no

longer  required  to  supply  the  showers  and  sinks,  since  the  solar  thermal  collectors  are   working  to  cover  100%  of  the  demand  (M,  2011-2012).  Overall,  the  retrofit  has   resulted  in  a  gas  load  reduction  from  70,160m3/year  to  36,300m3/year,  a  49%   reduction.

The  combined  gas  and  electricity  consumption  has  been  converted  to  equivalent   kilowatt  hours  (ekWh)  and  divided  by  the  total  gross  area  of  the  design,  thus   establishing  the  energy  intensity  for  GP  of  268ekWh/m2  before  the  retrofit  and  a   192ekWh/m2  after.  The  total  consumption  reduction  amounts  to  431,000ekWh/year,   28%  of  the  total  load.    The  post-retrofit  condition  is  31%  lower  than  CHMC's   281ekWh/m2  for  MURB's  of  the  same  tenancy,  and  5%  lower  than  the  average   building  sampling  by  both  OEE  and  RDH.

The  electricity  consumption  benchmark  at  GP  has  been  established  based  on  the  total   building  gross  area  and  the  total  electricity  consumption.  This  value  is  120.83kWh/m2   annually,  63%  higher  than  the  63.67kWh/m2  determined  by  OEE.  However,   comparing  the  electricity  consumption  per  unit  in  both  samples  yields  a  completely   different  result.  Dividing  the  total  electric  consumption  of  GP  by  the  146  units  yields  a   consumption  of  4,739.73kWh/unit.  Despite  this  number  including  the  consumption  of   common  elements  (hallway  lighting,  lobby,  etc),  this  value  is  6%  below  findings  by   OEE,  and  66%  lower  than  the  building  sample  in  the  CHMC  study.  The  disagreement   found  when  using  kWh/m2  as  the  comparison  metric  is  the  result  of  the  difference  in   average  unit  size  for  each  sample.  Based  on  the  consumption-per-unit  and  the   consumption-per-m2  averages  in  the  OEE  sample  it  is  revealed  that  the  OEE  study   sampled  units  whose  average  size  is  approximately  80m2,  whereas  at  GP  this  value  is   closer  to  40m2.  This  is  not  surprising,  since  in  the  absence  of  electric  heating,  the   highest  electrical  load  sinks  in  both  cases  are  similar  (stove,  fridge,  TV,  etc)  regardless   of  the  size  of  the  apartment.

In  general,  GP's  performance  for  total  energy  use  and  electricity  consumption  is   comparable  to  the  building  stock  benchmark  in  Ontario.      
  

6.2  Consumption  Distribution  Assessment  
   The  three  parameters  under  observation  (orientation,  season,  and  floor  elevation)   were  evaluated  over  a  time  period  dating  back  to  October  2010.  The  electronic   readings  included  the  appliance,  lighting,  and  plug  loading  in  each  unit,  along  with  the   electricity  consumption  resulting  from  each  fan-coil  unit  installed.  Based  on  these,  the   average  monthly  consumption  was  calculated  for  each  unit.  Units  were  grouped  into   West  and  East  facing  units  to  determine  an  overall  trend.  Monthly  averages  were   grouped  into  seasonal  averages:  Winter  (December,  January,  and  February),  Spring   (March,  April,  and,  May),  Summer  (June,  July,  and,  August),  and  Fall  (September,   October,  and  November)  in  order  to  determine  correlations  between  consumption,   season  and  orientation.        Figures  7  and  8  show  and  overall  decline  in  electricity  consumption  per  unit,  likely  the   positive  effect  of  the  ongoing  commissioning  process  at  GP,  particularly  the   optimization  of  operational  temperatures  for  the  boilers  resulting  in  a  decreased  need   to  supplement  them  by  electric  means  (heaters,  stoves,  etc)  (M,  2011-2012).  While   figure  8  suggests  an  overall  pattern  (summer  consumption  spike  on  the  East  facing   units,  and  a  winter  consumption  spike  for  the  West  units).

   The  floor-by-floor  analysis  was  carried  out  in  the  same  manner  as  the  whole  building   analysis,  with  averages  obtained  by  floor  and  orientation,  both  monthly  and   seasonally.  Looking  at  the  consumption  patterns  for  the  individual  floors  (Figures  9- 14  and  Appendix  H),  the  pattern  established  by  Figure  8  is  no  longer  discernible.   Figures  9-14  describe,  shown  in  cross-section,  the  East  and  West-facing  consumption   averages  for  each  floor  for  the  whole  building  during  a  particular  season.  The  delta   values  located  on  the  left  side  describe  the  consumption  difference  between   orientations  per  floor.  Darker  values  represent  higher  West-facing  consumption,   while  the  lighter  values  represent  higher  East-facing  consumption.  It  becomes   obvious  looking  at  the  individual  figures  that  the  alternating  colours  discredit  the   clear-cut  pattern  established  by  figure  8.  In  fact,  whatever  pattern  may  be  discernible   seasonally  fails  to  repeat  itself  in  the  following  year,  further  discouraging  the  chance   of  there  being  any  relationship  whatsoever.  Given  that  the  standard  deviation  for  the   unit  consumption  average  is  77.05kWh/month,  the  peaks  and  valleys  present  in   Figure  8  (range  =  31.5kWh)  seem  rather  insignificant.

Finally,  the  annual  electrical  consumption  averages  per  unit  were  plotted  on  the   building  floor  plans,  and  analyzed  for  consumption  patterns,  such  as  interior  vs.   corner  units,  vertically  reoccurring  sinks,  and  differences  between  average  unit   consumption  per  floor.  Appendix  I  provides  a  graphical  analysis  of  the  consumption   averages  for  every  unit  at  GP.  Once  again,  there  appears  to  be  no  pattern  present.   There  is  no  clear  relationship  between  units  and  their  respective  placement  within   the  floor  plan.  Units  with  higher  exposure  areas  (corner  units)  do  not  seem  prone  to   high  consumption  rates  any  more  than  internal  units,  which  benefit  from  having   fewer  exterior  walls.  Furthermore,  there  appears  to  be  no  vertical  patterns   established  across  the  floors.        Overall,  it  is  difficult  to  discern  any  particular  pattern.  Units  with  high  consumption   averages  appear  sporadically  through  the  floor  plans  and  show  no  particular   relationship  to  their  location  within  the  structure  (corners,  floor,  or  orientation).   Without  further  investigation,  it  may  only  be  assumed  that  consumption  variation  is   the  direct  result  of  tenant  behavior.

6.3  Occupant  Responses  vs.  Meter  Readings  
   The  matrix  is  comprised  of  tenant  responses,  plug-load  consumption  rates,  and  actual   consumption  values  obtained  from  the  electronic  meters.  The  tenant  responses   selected  are  those  related  to  the  28  different  load  types  addressed  by  the  survey.  The   particular  questions  selected  are  outlined  in  Appendix  J.  Note  that  usage-related   responses,  given  as  ranges,  have  been  addressed  by  the  three  matrix  instances:  lower- bound,  average,  and  upper-bound  as  described  in  the  methodology.  Further  to  this,  a   number  of  necessary  usage  parameters  cannot  be  derived  directly  from  the  survey  or   the  statistical  databases,  and  must  be  estimated  based  on  a  combination  of  available   data  and  assumptions.  These  parameters  and  their  respective  assumptions  are   summarized  in  Table  4.        Item   Assumptions   Cable  box   - When  `Left  on'  is  selected,  usage  will  be  set  to  24h/day   - Otherwise,  time  on  TV  =  time  on  cable  box   Internet     - Only  available  for  tenants  with  computers   - Time  on  computer  =  time  on  internet   - Time  not  on  computer  incurs  modem  standby  usage   Cell  phone     - Assume  a  single  3h  charge  every  other  day   Speakers   - Available  to  tenants  with  TV  sets  and/or  Computers.   - Assume  computer  speakers  when  both  TV  and  computer  are   Slow  cooker     Rice  cooker   Air  conditioner   Heating   Equipment   Cooling   Equipment   Personal   Heater   - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Assume  a  `typical  day'  averaged  over  the  year  based  on  daily   average  temperatures  above  240C  based  on  sample  year  2011.   23  days  over  240C  /  365  =  6%,  24h*6%=2h/day  averaged  over  a   year.

Table  4:  Usage  Assumptions  

The  second  set  of  parameters  is  the  plug-load  consumption  rates.  These  are  presented   either  as  wattage  +  standby  power,  for  appliances  whose  usage  has  been  determined   through  the  survey  such  as  television  sets  and  computers,  or  as  monthly  consumption   values  (kWh/month)  for  those  items  whose  usage  was  not  implicitly  determined  in   the  survey,  such  as  radio  or  vacuum  usage.  Some  of  these  values  are  common  to  all   units,  namely  the  stove  wattage  (Electrolux  ),  the  refrigerator  monthly  consumption   (Moffat  Appliances),  and  the  electricity  draw  (W)  of  the  fan-coil  units  (Johnson   Controls),  all  of  which  were  obtained  directly  from  the  manufacturer  specifications.   The  values  that  had  to  be  determined  based  on  the  limited  data  available  were   retrieved  from  various  databases,  namely  the  U.S.  Energy  Information  Administration   and  the  `Energy  Data  Sourcebook  for  the  U.S.  Residential  Sector'  by  Wenzel,  T.  P.,   Koomey,  J.  G.,  Rosenquist,  G.  J.,  Sanchez,  M.,  &  Handford,  J.  W.  Both  of  these  sources   built  their  databases  from  thousands  of  samples  in  the  US,  and  are  considered  to  be   statistically  reliable  sources.  The  complete  list  of  all  loads,  assumptions  and  sources  is   available  in  Appendix  J.  The  last  set  of  parameters  is  the  actual  consumption  values   from  the  electronic  meters,  which  were  used  to  determine  discrepancies  in  the   survey-based  estimate.      6.3.1  Matrix  Instances      Based  on  the  range-style  responses  to  usage  time,  3  separate  instances  of  the  matrix   have  been  created  and  results  extracted.  These  instances  are  the  lower-bound,   average,  and  upper-bound  conditions.  As  their  names  suggest,  the  lower  and  upper   bound  instances  use  the  lower  and  upper  bounds  of  each  of  the  usage  time  ranged   responses,  with  the  average  instance  using  the  time  in  the  middle  of  the  range.    The   results  are  as  follows:

Not  surprisingly,  the  results  for  the  lower-bound  instance  tend  toward  under- estimation.  This  is  primarily  because  the  cooking-related  loads  are  zero  in  77%  of  the   samples.  Inversely,  the  results  from  the  upper-bound  instance  tend  toward  over- estimation.  This  resulted  from  73%  of  the  tenants  having  excessive  cooking  times.   Both  of  these  outcomes  are  the  result  of  the  same  problem:  the  consumption  rates  of   cooking  appliances,  namely  the  stove  and  oven,  are  much  higher  than  any  other  load   type,  and  the  usage  range  for  these  loads  is  too  broad.  With  the  typical  tenant   selecting  the  lowest  allowable  usage  range,  the  lower-bound  instance  tends  to  zero,   while  the  upper-bound  instance  (1h)  is  much  higher  than  the  tenant  intended  to   select.  As  highlighted  by  the  cooking-related  consumption  issues  presented  above,  the   upper  and  lower  bound  instances  are  generally  unreliable,  as  they  represent  extremes   and  are  not  necessarily  comparable  to  the  individual  units.  In  fact,  their  respective   results  support  using  the  average  matrix  instance,  as  it  is  the  closest  approximation  to   the  actual  metered  readings.  For  the  complete  unit-by-unit  average  matrix  instance   See  Appendix  L.        Overall,  the  ratio  of  overestimates  to  underestimates  is  high  (3:1  in  the  average   instance),  indicating  that  while  half  of  the  respondents  came  relatively  close  to  their   actual  metered  consumption,  the  large  majority  of  respondents  tended  toward   overestimating  their  respective  metered  consumption.  A  closer  look  at  the  matrix   results  reveals  two  primary  sources  of  discrepancy:  time  overestimates  and  statistical   bias.   6.3.2  Discrepancy  Sources     Time  Overestimates   In  order  to  establish  a  total  monthly  consumption  for  each  unit,  survey  questions  of   two  types  were  considered:  those  relating  to  appliance  inventory  and  those  related  to   usage,  which  were  estimated  by  tenants.  Not  surprisingly,  the  most  volatile  parameter   was  also  the  one  that  was  related  to  estimation  rather  than  the  more  straight-forward   appliance  inventory.  These  overestimates  take  two  forms,  time  allocation  and  cooking   overestimates.        Time  Allocation:  Time  allocation  was  verified  based  on  each  tenant's  response  to   "how  many  hours  do  you  spend  in  your  apartment  (includes  sleeping)?"  and  the   number  of  hours  allocated  to  cooking,  using  the  computer,  and  watching  TV.  Three   sets  of  checks  were  set  up.  The  first  check  (a  more  stringent  check)  assumed  that   cooking  (the  larger  between  oven  and  stove  usage),  using  the  computer,  and  watching   TV  were  not  be  performed  simultaneously.  The  sum  of  these  estimates  was  subtracted   from  the  `time  spent  at  home'  and  a  value,  presumably  `average  sleeping  time',  was   determined.  40%  of  tenants  reported  average  sleeping  times  less  than  6h.  The  second   check  (a  more  lenient  check)  assumed  that  using  the  computer  and  watching  TV   would  always  take  place  simultaneously.  In  this  case  33%  of  tenants  reported  less   than  6h  sleep  averages,  with  8%  of  the  total  sample  reporting  less  than  1h.  Finally,   allowing  for  all  tasks  to  happen  simultaneously  (a  rather  synchronized  effort),  29%  of   all  samples  reported  less  than  the  6H  sleep  cycle.  This  suggests  that  a  large  portion  of  

  

29  

the  sample  (approximately  a  third)  were  unable  to  accurately  describe  their  typical   daily  schedule  while  answering  the  survey  questions,  resulting  in  inflated  usage   estimates.  These  time-management  overestimates,  in  turn,  resulted  in  higher   consumption  estimates.        Cooking  Time:  Figure  39  has  a  very  obvious  implication:  usage  estimates  for  cooking   dominate  the  overall  consumption  estimate,  as  it  amounts  to  almost  half  of  the  total   consumption,  and  55%  of  the  total  unknown  load  (the  refrigerator  load  is  assumed   constant  based  on  the  product  specification  sheet).  While  time  over-estimates   anywhere  in  the  matrix  affect  the  final  result,  minimal  estimation  errors  in  this   parameter,  at  a  rate  of  96.2kWh/h  for  the  average  month,  dramatically  affect  the  final   result.    For  this  reason,  a  cooking  overestimate  check  has  been  built  into  the  matrix.  A   monthly  `base  consumption'  parameter  was  determined  based  on  the  consumption  of   the  basic  appliances  (Fridge,  stove,  microwave)  and  unit  lighting.  This  number,  which   excludes  all  other  electronic  loads  (and  therefore  avoids  `statistical  error'  as  described   in  the  following  section),  is  then  compared  to  each  unit's  respective  average   consumption.  If  the  base  consumption  is  higher  than  the  metered  average,  error  can   be  attributed  to  a  cooking  time  overestimate,  since  it  is  the  only  significant  variable  in   the  equation.  Of  the  units  whose  consumption  estimate  surpassed  the  metered   consumption  by  more  than  half,  59%  were  found  to  incur  cooking  time  over   estimates.        Statistical  Bias   Average  monthly  consumption  values  derived  from  statistical  analysis  are  not   necessarily  reliable  in  combination,  as  they  do  not  account  for  the  effect  of  having   various  similar  loads.  This  issue  is  illustrated  by  the  example  case  where  tenants  have   both  a  VCR  and  a  DVD  player.    In  this  case,  the  statistical  analysis  has  determined  a   consumption  value  for  each  appliance  based  on  their  average  usage  time  across  a   large  sample  and  the  average  consumption  rate  for  each  appliance.  However,  since   both  of  these  devices  perform  the  same  function  (watch  movies)  the  average  usage   time,  or  movie-watching  time,  should  be  shared.    In  this  case  the  statistical   consumption  is  not  a  simple  addition  of  values,  but  a  combination  of  both,  a  weighted   average  dependent  of  the  ratio  of  VCR  to  DVD  usage.  Furthermore,  this  bias  is   cumulative,  depending  directly  on  the  number  of  electronic  devices  selected  by  the   tenant,  and  not  just  on  how  similar  they  are.  Since  there  is  only  so  much  time  in  a  day,   a  tenant  with  an  excessive  number  of  electronic  gadgets  would  not  be  able  to  use  each   gadget  as  often  as  the  statistical  average  would  suggest,  ultimately  consuming  less   energy  than  the  addition  of  all  the  individual  statistical  loads.  This  bias  is  present  in   36%  of  the  samples  whose  consumption  exceeded  50%.   6.3.3  Cases  Results      Further  to  this  unit-by-unit  analysis,  3  separate  cases  were  constructed  to  evaluate   the  overall  performance  of  tenants  during  the  survey  while  attempting  to  limit  the   effect  of  the  established  sources  of  bias  and  over  estimates.  Note  the  following:

Table  8:  Matrix  Assessment  for  Cases  1  to  3  

Case  1:  Survey  Mode   Both  the  load  types  and  the  usage  times  in  case  1  have  been  selected  based  on  the   survey  responses  that  appear  most  often  either  in  the  survey  (when  parameters  were   specifically  addressed)  or  in  the  matrix  (when  parameters  were  determined  by   algorithms  or  assumptions)  creating  a  `basic  unit',  an  inventory  of  the  most  common   load  types  and  usage  times  across  the  sample.  This  case  falls  at  the  lower  end  of  the   average  (-42%)  because  it  inherently  reduces  time  overestimates  and  statistical  bias   by  removing  all  eccentricities  from  the  analysis,  such  as  uncommon  gadgetry  or   excessive  cooking  times.  Unfortunately,  by  removing  all  eccentricities,  this  method   also  removes  abnormal  consumption  patterns  that  are  in  fact  present  in  the  sample,   causing  the  `base  unit'  to  consume  less  than  the  actual  metered  average  (incurs  mode   bias).  As  a  result  of  this  bias,  the  consumption  of  case  1  does  not  include  loads  related   to  heating,  cooling,  or  computers.

Case  2:  Appliance  Mode  +  Usage  Average   Like  case  1,  case  2  provides  an  inventory  of  the  most  common  loads  present  in  units   by  using  the  mode  of  load  type  questions.  However,  unlike  case  1,  case  2  determines   how  long  the  loads  are  running  based  on  a  whole-sample  average.  In  doing  so,  case  2   accommodates  eccentricities  present  in  usage  patterns,  such  as  abnormally  long   cooking  times.  The  resulting  `basic  unit'  is  one  that  more  closely  resembles  the   consumption  average  for  the  whole  sample  while  still  avoiding  statistical  bias.        This  assessment  case  is  particularly  effective  in  this  study  because  the  units  at  GP,   being  relatively  small,  cannot  accommodate  many  appliances.  This  means  that  load   type  modes  (basic  appliances  found  in  the  majority  of  units)  have  high  a  mode   recurrence,  making  the  case  more  accurate.  This  in  turn  places  emphasis  on  usage   time  responses  as  the  dominant  variables  in  the  matrix  and  obtaining  their  average   serves  to  capture  all  the  eccentricities  present  in  the  sample.  As  a  result,  the  electricity   consumption  of  case  2  (5%)  most  closely  resembles  the  consumption  average  of  the   units  at  GP.  However,  it  is  worth  noting  that,  like  case  1,  case  2    incurs  mode  bias  and   does  not  include  loads  related  to  heating,  cooling,  or  computers.

   Case  3:  Consumption  Average   Case  3  calculates  the  load  consumption  averages  for  each  load  type  and  then  adds   them  into  a  total  average  consumption/unit  value,  which  is  a  summary  of  the  matrix   results.  Because  this  case  only  looks  at  the  consumption  values  calculated  across  the     

34  

matrix,  it  accounts  for  all  eccentricities  present  in  the  survey,  both  by  load  type  and   usage,  and  therefore  incurs  both  time  overestimates  and  statistical  bias.  As  a  result,   this  value  (+45%)  is  the  highest  of  the  3  cases  because  it  is  the  most  susceptible  to   overestimation  by  tenants.  Figure  17  outlines  the  survey-based  electricity   consumption  distribution  amongst  the  load  types.

   It  is  worth  noting  that  the  values  obtained  in  case  3  are  not  representative  of  any   particular  unit,  but  rather  represent  the  averaged  outcome  of  the  matrix.  For  this   reason,  comparison  to  this  inflated  average  should  exceed  the  established  RDH   benchmarks.  However,  comparing  the  in-unit  lighting  load  (5.83kWh/m2/year)  and   total  plug  load  (97.8kWh/m2/year)  at  GP  to  the  benchmark  set  up  by  RDH  yields   interesting  results.  At  GP,  lighting  consumption  is  only  38%  of  the  expected  load,   while  plug  loading  is  almost  5  times  that  of  RDH.  Considering  that  the  whole-building   analysis  declared  the  samples  equivalent,  these  discrepancies  can  only  be  attributed   to  the  effect  of  average  unit  size.  RDH  likely  sampled  units  that  are  significantly  larger   than  those  at  GP  (after  all,  units  at  GP  are  a  mere  20.7m2).  Larger  units  require  more   lighting  due  to  larger  surface  areas  and  the  introduction  of  partitions  (GP  units  are   bachelor-style),  yet  the  basic  plug  loads  are  the  same  (fridge,  stove,  TV,  etc)  meaning   that  consumption  in  a  per-m2  basis  would  yield  a  lower  value.

7.  Conclusions    
   Comparing  occupant  self-assessed  behaviour  to  actual  metered  consumption  hinges   on  the  assessment's  ability  to  convert  survey  responses  and  statistical  consumption   values  into  a  consumption/month  value  for  each  unit  in  the  sample.  This  has  proven   to  be  quite  difficult  given  the  number  of  variables  in  the  study  and  the  quality  of  the   responses  obtained  from  the  survey,  particularly  when  it  comes  to  missing  usage   times  and  response  ranges  that  are  too  large.  Assessing  the  upper  and  lower  bound   instance  for  the  matrix  makes  it  clear  that  usage  time  ranges  can  dramatically  affect   the  matrix  results  if  the  load  type  is  significant  enough  and  the  range  it  too  large   (stove/oven  usage).    As  a  whole,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  accuracy  of  the  study   without  making  dramatic  changes  to  the  survey  and/or  the  means  of  establishing  the   monthly  consumption  loads  (individual  metering  per  load  type),  coupled  with  more   advanced  statistical  analysis.          Based  on  the  results  obtained  from  the  average  matrix  instance,  the  individual  unit   estimates  were  found  to  be  only  approximately  50%  reliable  given  a  50%  tolerance;  a   considerable  value  given  the  standard  is  10%.  Furthermore,  the  ratio  of  overestimates   to  underestimates  is  3:1.  This  tendency  to  overestimate  results  from  discrepancies   related  to  time  management  and  cooking  overestimates,  which  amounts  to  40%  and   38%  of  all  samples  respectively,  affecting  a  total  of  60%  of  all  samples.  Given  a  more   accurate  assessment  strategy  (including  monitored  plug  loads),  results  like  these   could  lead  to  the  miss-allocation  of  resources  during  a  retrofit  (over-sizing  of  supply   lines,  downplaying  the  use  of  the  fan-coil  units,  offsetting  the  perceived  balance  of   unit-to-common  loading,  etc)  and  can  easily  mislead  energy-saving  strategies  when  it   comes  to  appliance  upgrades  based  on  usage  and  overall  efficiency.        The  discrepancies  found  in  the  individual  unit  estimates  may  be  filtered  out  through   the  use  of  mode-based  cases.  These  are  particularly  effective  when  sample  sizes  are   not  large  enough  for  averages  to  handle  unusually  high  and  low  responses.  However   great  care  must  be  taken  to  avoid  `mode  bias'  as  described  in  the  methodology.      

8.  Recommendations    
   The  most  prevalent  source  of  discrepancy  in  the  study  is  time  overestimates.  These   can  be  mediated  by  presenting  all  time-allocation  questions  in  a  manner  that  forces   respondents  to  reconcile  their  numbers,  such  as  having  these  questions  presented  in   sequence  and  in  the  same  page,  where  tenants  can  see  their  previous  answers  to   inform  their  current  estimates.  Further  to  this,  `usage  time'  questions  should  have   tighter  answer  ranges,  particularly  for  items  with  very  high  consumption  rates  such   as  ovens.  Allowing  more  stringent  ranges  and/or  giving  respondents  the  opportunity   to  fill  their  own  responses  minimizes  assumptions  during  processing  and  strengthens   the  validity  of  average-based  analysis  while  minimizing  the  chance  of  `mode  bias'.       

  

37  

Beyond  these  time-based  considerations,  it  may  be  worth  introducing  custom-made   questions  into  the  survey  where  the  tenancy  type  or  building  characteristics  require   it.  In  the  case  of  GP,  it  would  be  helpful  to  determine  whether  tenants  are  aware  of   and  can  operate  the  technology  present  in  their  units,  such  as  the  air-tight  window   latches  and  fan-coil  settings.  Based  on  the  responses  given  in  the  survey,  it  is  likely   that  tenants  answered  seasonal  set-point  questions  inaccurately  because  they  did  not   understand  the  system  or  the  question  (most  selected  no  heating  during  the  winter).   These  context-sensitive  questions  could  help  to  either  clarify  questions  for  the  tenants   or  minimize  ambiguity  in  processing  the  responses.

In the case of a full cabinet unit, the unit must obviously be handled by the exterior casing. This is acceptable providing the unit is again maintained in an upright position and no impact forces are applied that may damage internal components or painted surfaces. The equipment covered in this manual IS NOT suitable for outdoor installations. The equipment should never be stored or installed where it may be subjected to a hostile environment such as rain, snow, or extreme temperatures.
During and after installation, special care must be taken to prevent foreign material such as paint, plaster, and drywall dust from being deposited in the drain pan or on the motor or blower wheels. Failure to do so may have serious adverse effects on unit operation and in the case of the motor and blower assembly, may result in immediate or premature failure. All manufacturers' warranties are void if foreign material is deposited on the motor or blower wheels of any unit. Some units andl or job conditions may require some fonn of temporary covering during construction. While the manufacturer does not become involved in the design and selection of support methods and components, it should be noted that unacceptable system operating characteristics andlor perfonnance may result from improper or inadequate unit structural support. In addition, adequate clearance must be provided for service and removal of the equipment and its accessory components. Anchoring the equipment in place is accomplished by using the mounting points provided and positioning the unit to maintain the unit on a LEVEL plane. The drain pan is internally sloped toward the outlet connection. Care must be taken to insure that the unit drain pan does not slope away from the outlet connection.

If equipped with optional leveling legs, the legs can be adjusted with a wrench before anchoring the unit in place. The type of mounting device is a matter of choice, however the mounting point should always be that provided in the chassis, or cabinet. Refer to the unit product drawing for mounting hole location and sizes. If equipped with optional falseback spacers or subbases, these accessories must first be assembled and mounted to the unit before anchoring. After mounting the unit, it is then ready for the various service connections such as water, drain and electrical. At this time it should be verified that the proper types of service are actually provided to the unit. On those units requiring chilled water andlor hot water, the proper line size and water temperature should be available to the unit. In the case of refrigerant cooling, the proper line size and refrigerant type should be available at the unit. The auxiliary drain pan is shipped loose for field installation. See the Auxiliary Drain Pan Installation Details for instructions (next page). On units with steam heating coils, the proper line sizing and routing should be verified and the maximum steam pressure applied to the unit should never exceed 15 psig. The drain piping and steam trap should be sized and routed to allow for proper condensate flow. The electrical service to the unit should be compared to the unit nameplate to verify compatibility. The routing and sizing of all piping, and the type and sizing of aU wiring and other electrical components such as circuit breakers, disconnect switches, etc. should be detennined by the individual job requirements and should not be based on the size andlor type of connection provided on the equipment. All installations should be made in compliance with all governing codes and ordinances. Compliance with all codes is the responsibility of the installing contractor.

FORM ET115.24-NOM9 (908)

Submittals and Product Catalogs detailing unit operation, controls, and connections should be thoroughly reviewed BEFORE beginning the connection of the various cooling and/or heating mediums to the unit. All documentation may be found at www.enviro-tec.com. All accessory valve packages should be installed as required, and all service valves should be checked for proper operation. If coil and valve package connections are to be made with "sweat" or solder joint, care should be taken to assure that no components in the valve package are subjected to a high temperature which may damage seals or other materials. Many two-position electric control valves, depending on valve operation, are provided with a manual-opening lever. This lever should be placed in the "open" position during all soldering or brazing operations. Valve bodies should be wrapped with a wet rag to help dissipate heat encountered during brazing. If the valve package connection at the coil is made with a union, the coil side of the union must be prevented from twisting ("backed up") during tightening to prevent damage to the coil tubing. Over-tightening must be avoided to prevent distorting the union seal surface and ~ destroying the union.

In the case of field installed valves and piping, the chilled water valve cluster (or expansion valve on DX units) should be installed in such a way that any dripping or sweating is contained in the auxiliary drain pan or other device. After the connections are completed, the system should then be tested for leaks. Since some components are not designed to hold pressure with a gas, hydronic systems should be tested with water.

( CAUTION)

All water coils must be protectedfrom freezing after initialfilling with water. Even ifthe system is drained, unit coils may still hold enough water to cause damage when exposed to temperatures below freezing.

Refrigerant systems should be tested with dry nitrogen rather than air to prevent the introduction of moisture into the system. In the event that leaking or defective components are discovered, the Sales Representative must be notified BEFORE any repairs are attempted. All leaks should be repaired before proceeding with the installation.

After system integrity has been established the piping should be insulated in accordance with the project specifications. ALL chilled water piping and valves or refrigerant suction piping not located over drain pans must be insulated to prevent damage from sweating. This includes factory and field piping inside the unit cabinet. The drain should always be connected and piped to an acceptable disposal point. For proper moisture canyoff, the drain piping should be sloped away from the unit at least 1/8" per foot. A drain trap may be required by local codes and it is strongly recommended for odor containment.
DUCTWORK CONNECTIONS

ELECTRICAL CONNECnONS

The unit nameplate lists the unit electrical characteristics such as the required supply voltage, fan and heater amperage and required circuit ampacities. The unitwiring diagram shows all unit and field wiring. Since each project is different and each unit on a project may be different, the installer must be familiar with the wiring diagram and nameplate on the unit BEFORE beginning any wiring. All components furnished for field installation, by either the factory or the controls contractor should be located and checked for proper function and compatibility. All internal components should be checked for shipping damage and all electrical connections should be tightened to minimize problems during start-up. Any devices such as fan switches or thermostats that have been furnished from the factory for field installation must be wired in strict accordance with the applicable wiring diagrams. Failure to do so could result in personal injury or damage to components and will void all manufacturers' warranties. The fan motor(s) should never be controlled by any wiring or device other than the factory furnished switch, thermostat/switch combination, without factory authorization. All field wiring should be done in accordance with governing codes and ordinances. Any modification of the unit wiring without factory authorization will result in voiding of all factory warranties and will nullify any agency listings. The manufacturer assumes no responsibility for any damages and/or injuries resulting from improperly field installed or wired components.

All ductwork and/or supply and return grilles should be installed in accordance with the project plans and specifications. If not included on the unit or furnished from the factory, supply and return grilles should be provided as recommended in the product catalog. All units must be installed in non-combustible areas. Some models are designed to be connected to duct-work with a MINIMUM amount of external static pressure. These units may be damaged by operation without the proper ductwork connected. Consult the approved submittals and the product catalog for unit external static pressure limitations. Units provided with outside air for ventilation should have some form of low temperature protection to prevent coil freeze-up. It should be noted that none of these methods would adequately protect a coil in the event of power failure. The safest method of freeze protection is to use glycol in the proper percent solution for the coldest expected air temperature. The manufacturer assumes no responsibility for undesirable system operation due to improper design, equipment or component selection, and/or installation of ductwork, grilles, and other field supplied components.

SECTION 2 - START-UP
GENERAL

Before beginning any start-up operation, the startup personnel should familiarize themselves with the unit, options and accessories, and control sequence to understand the proper system operation. All personnel should have a good working knowledge of general start-up procedures and have the appropriate start-up and balancing guides available for consultation. The initial step in any startup operation should be a final visual inspection. All equipment, plenums, duct-work, and piping should be inspected to verify that all systems are complete and properly installed and mounted, and that no debris or foreign articles such as paper or drink cans are left in the units or other areas. Each unit should be checked for loose wires, free blower wheel operation, and loose or missing access panels or doors. Except as required during start-up and balancing operations, no fan coil units should be operated without all the proper ductwork attached, supply and return grilles in place, and all access doors and panels in place and secure. A clean filter of the proper size and type must also be installed. Failure to do so could result in damage to the equipment or building and furnishings, and/or void all manufacturers' warranties.
COOLING/HEAnNG SYSTEM

The air l1ent prol1ided on the unit is not intended to replace the main system air l1ents and may not release air trapped in (CAUTION) otherparts ofthe system. Inspect the entire system for potentitil air traps and l1ent those areas as required, independently. In addition, some systems may require repellted l1enting Ol1er a period oftime to properly eliminate air from the system.
AIR SYSTEM BALANCING

All ductwork must be complete and connected, and all grilles, filters, access doors and panels must be properly installed to establish actual system operating conditions BEFORE beginning air balancing operations. Each individual unit and attached ductwork is a unique system with its own operating characteristics. For this reason, balance specialists who are familiar with all procedures required to properly establish air distribution and fan system operating conditions normally do air balancing. Unqualified personnel should not attempt these procedures. Exposed units with no ductwork do not require air balancing other than selecting the desired fan speed. After the proper system operation is established, the actual unit air delivery and the actual fan motor amperage draw for each unit should be recorded in a convenient place for future reference such as the inspection, installation, & start-up check sheet, a copy of which is provided at the back of this manual. Contact the Sales Representative or the factory for additional copies of this sheet.
WATER SYSTEM BALANCING

Prior to the water system start-up and balancing, the chilledlhot water systems should be flushed to clean out dirt and debris, which may have collected in the piping during construction. During this procedure, all unit service valves must be in the closed position. This prevents foreign matter from entering the unit and clogging the valves and metering devices. Strainers should be installed in the piping mains to prevent this material from entering the units during normal operation. During system filling, air venting from the unit is accomplished by the use of the standard, manual or optional automatic air vent fitting installed on the coil. In the case of the manual air vent fitting, the screw should be turned counterclockwise no more than 1-1/2 turns to operate the air vent. Automatic air vents may be unscrewed one tum counterclockwise to speed initial venting but should be screwed in for automatic venting after start-up operations.

A complete knowledge of the hydronic system, its components, and controls is essential to proper water system balancing and this procedure should not be attempted by unqualified personnel. The system must be complete and all components must be in operating condition BEFORE beginning water system balancing operations.

10

JOHNSON CONTROLS

FORM ET115.24-NOM9 (908)

Each hydronic system has different operating characteristics depending on the devices and controls in the system. The actual balancing technique may vary from one system to another. After the proper system operation is established, the appropriate system operating conditions such as various water temperatures and flow rates should be recorded in a convenient place for future reference such as the inspection, installation, & start-up check sheet, a copy ofwhich is provided on the back of this manual. Contact the Sales Representative or the factory for additional copies of this sheet. Before and during water system balancing, conditions may exist which can result in noticeable water noise or undesired valve operation due to incorrect system pressures. After the entire system is balanced, these conditions will not exist on properly designed systems.

CONTROLS OPERATION

Before proper control operation can be verified all other systems must be in proper operation. The correct water and air temperatures must be present for the control function being tested. Some controls and features are designed to not operate under certain conditions. A wide range of controls and electrical options and accessories may be used with the equipment covered in this manual. Consult the approved unit submittals, order acknowledgement, and other manuals for detailed information regarding each individual unit and its controls. Since controls and features may vary from one unit to another, care should be taken to identify the controls to be used on each unit and their proper control sequence. Information provided by component manufacturers regarding installation, operation, and maintenance of their individual controls is available upon request.

SECTION 3 - NORMAL OPERATION & PERIODIC MAINTENANCE
GENERAL ELECTRIC RESISTANCE HEATER ASSEMBLY

Each unit on a job will have its own unique operating environment and conditions that may dictate a maintenance schedule for that unit that is different from other equipment on the job. A formal schedule of regular maintenance and an individual unit log should be established and maintained. This will help to achieve the maximum performance and service life of each unit on the job.

(

CD
NOTE )

Information regarding safety precautions contained in the preface at the beginning of this manual should be followed during any service and maintenance operations.

Electric resistance heaters typically require no normal periodic maintenance when unit air filters are changed properly. Other conditions and equipment may affect the operation and service life in the system. The two most important operating conditions for an electric heater are proper airflow and proper supply voltage. High supply voltage and/or poorly distributed or insufficient airflow over the element will result in element overheating. This condition may result in the heater cycling on the high limit thermal cutout Sheathed type heaters provided have an automatic reset switch with a back-up high limit thermal switch. Automatic reset switches are as the name implies; they reset automatically after the heater has cooled down. High limit thermal switches must be replaced once the circuit has been broken. The high limit thermal cutout device is a safety device only and is not intended for continuous operation. With proper unit application and during normal operation, the high limit thermal cutout will not operate. This device only operates when some problem exists and ANY condition that causes high limit cutout MUST be corrected immediately. High supply voltage also causes excessive amperage draw and may result in tripping of the circuit breaker or blowing of the fuses on the incoming power supply.
FAN DECK

For more detailed information concerning service operations, consult your Sales Representative or the Factory.
MOTORIBLOWER ASSEMBLY

The type of fan operation is determined by the control components and their method of wiring, and may vary from unit to unit. Refer to the wiring diagram for each

unitfor that unit sindividual operating characteristics.
Motors are permanently lubricated, PSC type and do not require field lubrication. Should the assembly require more extensive service, the motorlblower assembly may be removed from the unit to facilitate such operations as motor or blower wheellhousing replacement, etc. Dirt and dust should not be allowed to accumulate on the blower wheel or housing. This can result in an unbalanced blower wheel condition that can damage a blower wheel or motor. The wheel and housing may be cleaned periodically using a vacuum cleaner and a brush taking care not to dislodge the factory balancing weights on the blower wheel blades.
COIL

The fan/drain pan assembly is easily removable for service access to motors and blowers at, or away from, the unit.
ELECTRICAL WIRING & CONTROLS

Coils may be cleaned in place by removing the motorl blower assemblies and brushing the entering air face between fins with a stiffbrush. Cleaning with a vacuum cleaner should follow brushing. If a compressed air source is available, the coil may also be cleaned by blowing air through the coil fins from the leaving air face. Vacuuming should again follow this. Units provided with the proper type of air filters, replaced regularly, will require coil cleaning.

The electrical operation of each unit is determined by the components and wiring of the unit and may vary from unit to unit. Consult the wiring diagram for the actual type and number of controls provided on each unit. The integrity of all electrical connections should be verified at least twice during the first year of operation. Afterwards, all controls should be inspected regularly for proper operation. Some components may experience erratic operation or failure due to age. Wall thermostats may also become clogged with dust and lint and should be periodically inspected and cleaned to provide reliable operation.

14

JOHNSON CONTROLS

FORM ET115.24-NOM9 (908)

When replacing any components such as fuses, contactors, or relays, use only the exact type, size, and voltage component as furnished from the factory. Any deviation without factory authorization could result in personnel injury or damage to the unit and will void all factory warranties. All repair work should be done in such a manner as to maintain the equipment in compliance with governing codes and ordinances or testing agency listings. More specific information regarding the use and operating characteristics of the standard controls offered by this manufacturer is contained in other manuals. VALVES & PIPING No formal maintenance is required on the valve package components most commonly used with fan coil units other than a visual inspection for possible leaks in the course of other normal periodic maintenance. In the event that a valve should need replacement, the same precautions taken during the initial installation to protect the valve package from excessive heat should also be used during replacement. FILTERS, THROWAWAY The type of throwaway filter most commonly used on fan coil units should be replaced on a regular basis. The time interval between each replacement should be established based on regular inspection of the filter and should be recorded in the log for each unit. Refer

DRAIN The drain should be checked before initial start-up and at the beginning of each cooling season to assure that the lines are clear. If it is clogged, steps should be taken to clear the debris so that condensate will flow easily. Periodic checks of the drain should be made during the cooling season to maintain a free flowing condensate. Should the growth of algae and/or bacteria be a concern, consult an air conditioning and refrigeration supply organization familiar with local conditions for chemicals available to control these agents. REPLACEMENT PARTS Factory replacement parts should be used wherever possible to maintain the unit performance and operating characteristics and the testing agency listings. Replacement parts may be purchased through the local Sales Representative. Contact the local Sales Representative or the factory before attempting any unit modifications. Any modifications not authorized by the factory could result in personnel injury and damage to the unit and could void all factory warranties. When ordering parts, the following information must be supplied to ensure proper part identification: 1. Complete unit model number. 2. Unit hand connection (right or left hand) while facing into the return air stream. 3. Complete part description including any numbers.

to the product catalog for the recommended filter size for each product type and size. If the replacement filters are not purchased from the factory, the filters used should be the same type and size as that furnished from or recommended by the factory. Pleated media or extended surface filters should not be used since the high air pressure drops encountered with these types of filters is not compatible with the type of fan coil unit covered in this manual. Consult the factory for applications using filter types other than the factory standard or optional product.

On warranty replacements, in addition to the information
previously listed, the project CO # that appears on the unit nameplate, is required. Contact the factory for authorization to return any parts such as defective parts replaced in warranty. All shipments returned to the factory MUST be marked with a Return Authorization Number, which is provided by the factory. All equipment and components sold through the Parts Department are warranted under the same conditions as the standard manufacturer's warranty with the exception that the warranty period is 12 months unless the component is furnished as warranty replacement. Parts furnished as warranty replacements are warranted for the remaining tenn of the original unit warranties.

Dear "Green Project" tenant, Ryerson University team supported by the sponsors listed on the cover page is launching a project to look at tenant's energy/water usage and their attitude towards energy/ water use. How can tenants save energy and water? Do tenant engagement strategies really work? The purpose of this study is to see whether tenant engagement strategies will conserve energy and water in Toronto's "Green Project" building. Tenants will have the opportunity to participate and be exposed to various tenant engagement strategies such as informational tools (e.g. poster and brochures), workshops, and energywater--saving commitments. For more details, please see the posters throughout the building. Confidentiality will be maintained and only general non-identifying data will be disclosed in any report and research publication. Further details regarding the protection of your privacy are in the "Ryerson University Consent Agreement" included with the survey.
