A Locaî-Feedback-Global-Cascade M odel For Hierarchical Heart Rate Variability In Healthy Humans
Xiuzhong Gao, Master of Applied Science in the program of Mechanical Engineering, Ryerson University 2004

ABSTRACT
A broad view on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) study is made and the hierarchical structure is shown in Local-feedback-Global-Cascade (LFGC) model, whieh is built to explore the role of reflex feedback. This feedback, which integrates additive and multiple functionalities in multifractal cascade models, functions on the She-Waymire (SW) form o f the hierarchical structure so that the concept of defect dynamics can be applied to LFGC model. The experimental evidence verified the existence of the hierarchical structure and showed discrete scale invariance in data supported the additive feedback law, which may exist in the cardiovascular system in harmony with this dynamical cascade model.

Introduction

1.1 Introduction of Cardiovascular Regulation
The study of cardiovascular regulation consists of at least two major subfields: the heart and its peripheral organs and the dynamics and control of the heart rate. The former subject concerns mainly the mechanics of the heart, the vascular systems and the lung. The latter subject concerns the interaction between the autonomic nervous system with the heart, the vascular and respiratory systems as well as their integration in the higher control centers in the brain stem. Hence, the heart rate fluctuation describes one of the most complex phenomena in nature. In particular, it characterizes the system behavior of the whole body and cannot be related to just one single set of organ functionalities. Given the vast body o f literature on this subject, the scope of this introduction will be focused on the basic elements in the regulation of the heart rate.

The main objectives of cardiovascular regulation are to provide rapid transport of oxygen and nutrients, as well as to take away heat and metabolic wastes around the body. It relies on many "sensors" and "actuators" distributed in the body to achieve coordination of heart rate, blood circulation and respiration in order to perform the complicated task of cardiovascular regulation. The sensor inputs, or more commonly known as the afferent

inputs, are derived from the so-called receptor sites in various locations of the body. They eventually converge at the spinal cord and then travel to the cardiovascular centers at the brain stem. After processing such signals via still largely unknown mechanisms, outputs or the efferent signals will arrive at the "actuator" sites in the lung, vascular system and the heart to perform normal ftmctions of these organs.

At the level of the heart, the efferent signal reaches the heart at the primary pacemaker site known as the sino-atiial (SA) node. The sequence o f events following the excitation o f the SA node can be summarized in four stages (Figure 1); the contraction of the a,tria, excitation o f the atrial-ventricular node located at the wall between atria and ventricles, excitation o f the Perkinje fibers, and the contraction of the ventricles. The occurrence of these events can be measured fi*om the (small) potential difference on the surface of the chest. This type o f measurement is used to produce what is called the electrocardiogram (ECG). The contraction of the ventricles introduces a sharp peak in the ECG time trace and its location is designated as the R wave. The time span between the R waves, known as the RR interval (RRi), is precisely the inverse of the heart rate (See Figure 1). Mainly due to it easy access, RRi has been used as the primary variable for analysis in Heart Rate Variability.

The messenger system that is responsible for delivering sensor and actuator signals is the highly convoluted autonomic nervous system. When minor disturbance from either an internal or external source is present, the vascular system may regulate the blood circulation via muscle constriction or dilation. When a disturbance persists and reaches a

significant level, the regulation must be accompanied by a system response such as increasing or decreasing the heart rate.

Although using RRi to assess cardiovascular health is desirable since it is noninvasive, it captures nothing but the overall behavior of the cardiovascular dynamical system. It thus represents one of the most complex signals known in nature. It is known that a healthy cardiovascular system manifests itself in violent fluctuation of RRi. Counterintuitive to the conventional belief, heart disease is normally associated with significantly lower RRi variability. The purpose and the '. fin of heart rate fluctuation remain largely unknown

to-date, and they continue to be the subject of interest for clinicians, physiologists, physicists and mathematicians.

1.2 Heart Rate Variability and Characteristics of Ambulatory RR Intervals
Heart rate variability (HRV) is the term used to describe the apparent random fluctuation of RRi on a beat-to-beat basis. From the autonomic regulation point of view, HRV is a result of the intricate balance between the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous systems (PNS), where SNS tends to accelerate tlie heart rate (shorten RRi) and PNS tends to decelerate the heart rate (lengthen RRi). Although little is known regarding its physiological background, clinical data already show that HRV can provide an indirect measure of the health of the cardiovascular system since the mortality rate of heart diseased patients has been found to be inversely proportional to the degree of HRV. This section will demonstrate the characterization of RRi fluctuation. Following the language in statistical physics, this characterization is called HRV phenomenology.

Throughout the entire thesis, r{t) will be used to denote the RRi between the rth and ( t +1) th heart beats and the RRi increment defined at a given time scale t is given by:

Af{z) = r{t+ x) --r(t)

A. 1/f Power Spectrum
Given the r(t ) , the power spectral density function, G(f ) , can be calculated using discrete-time fast Fourier transform (DFT):

)) '

where oe is the frequency, j = V ^ . Numerically, the time series is divided into overlapping sections, each of which is first detrended, and then Hanning windowed. The magnitude squared of the DFT of the sections are finally averaged to give G{f) up to the Nyquist frequency = 0.5.

Kobayoshi and Musha [1] reported the earliest result of power law in HRV. They found the power spectrum of r(t) has the following form

(2)

where G is the power spectral density,/is the frequency in either Hz or 1/beat, and p > 0 is the power law exponent. For healthy subjects, p was found to be w 1. In general, p can vary with physiological or pathological conditions [2, 3]. In particular, p in heart disease is typically larger. In a clinical setting, this finding was used to suggest an inverse relationship between the degree of HRV and the health of the cardiovascular system. The RRi power spectrum from the daytime, ambulatory, RRi recording of a healthy subject is plotted in Figure 1*. The 1/f-like power law is evident.

B. Self-similar Fluctuation of RRi
The 1/f-like power spectrum is known as the necessary condition for the property called self-similarity or scale invariance. A self-similar process is also called a fractal process. This property inaplies long-time memory or correlation in tlie underlying cardiac control process and supports the view that HRV is temporally_/racra/ [4].

Mathematically, the notion of a self-similar process x{t) can be formulated as

power spectrum in Figure 2 is plotted in Figure 3. It is possible to qualitatively find the self-similarity of this time series. For example, Figure 4 plotted the same time series over 17600 <t < 18300. It is seen that similar patterns exist in Figures 3 and 4. This is the demonstration of self-similarity in HRV. It should he noted quantitative verification of self-similarity cannot be achieved by (3) since it is not possible to find the exact distribution from numerical data. Generally, one may rely on the statistics derived from the distribution. For example, the power spectrum, which characterizes the second order statistics o f the distribution, is a necessary condition for self-similarity.

C. Increment Probability Density Function (PDF)
It was found that the increment probability density function (PDF) of healthy RRi typically shows the stretch-exponential -- > exponential -- > Gaussian (SEG) transition as the time r increases [5], The same data in previous Figures is used to calculate normalized histograms of At (t ) fonr= 2°,2'',2®,2'' . The results are used to approximate the increment PDF plotted in Figure 5. The SEG transition is evident.

The SEG transition has also been found in the PDF of the velocity increment. It has been successfully demonstrated in some turbulence models [6 ] and time series models constructed by summing Gaussian variables on the dyadic tree [7]. The transition may be characterized quantitatively by using conventional statistics. In what follows, the kurtosis of the increment PDF will be used to characterize the SEG transition.

The kurtosis K is defined as the normalized fourth order central moment: given any random variable X with mean /i and variance or ^

f -

(4)

where N is the number of samples [8 ]. Although kurtosis has been a classical statistic, there is in fact no agreement as to what it can specifically characterize [9]. Some reseachers show that kurtosis captures the peakedness and flatness of the PDF and others emphasize the dependence of kurtosis on the tail behaviour [ 1 0 ,
1 1 ].

For the purpose o f this work, the K value o f the increment PDF is used to compare the theoretical values in the SEG transition. Specifically, the kurtosis for normal distribution has a value X = 3. A larger K> 3 results for distributions which are more outlier-prone than the normal distribution. In particular, the kurtosis of the exponential distribution is

The range of values covered by K is clearly compatible to the view o f SEG transition suggested by Figure 5. Furthermore, the existence of a power law relationship was found:

(5)

This power law relationship can be explained by the empirical law:

where (·) denotes statistical average and ^ > 0 is a real number. Equation (6 ) can be applied in (4) by letting x = A r(r). Since jj. = (Ar(r)) = 0, the kurtosis becomes

_,ç{4)-2ç(2)

Hence, y =

( d ) - 2^ (2). More details about the empirical law (6 ) are discussed next.

D. Multifractal HRV
The empirical law (6 ) describes a power law structure function in HRV. This can be observed in Figure 7 where 5 i.2(î) of the data used previously is plotted against r in loglog scales. Such a power law is in fact consistent with the definition o f a scale invariant process (3). However, (3) cannot predict the property of the scaling exponent ^(p). By varying p = 0.25, 0.5, ..., 5, (p) can be estimated numerically and is shown in Figure 8 .

It is seen that ^ (p) is nonlinear. This is a typical property for HRV [5]. In the literature, a fractal process showing linear ^ (/») is said to exhibit monofractal scaling. In contrast, a nonlinear ^ (p) implies multifractal scaling [5]. The notion o f multifractality has been established in the frameworks o f martingale theory o f stochastic processes and large deviation theory in probability theory. It is beyond the scope o f this thesis to conduct the analysis following such rigors. To study and investigate the change of the scaling property in HRV, C(p) will be used as a working definition to distinguish m ulti- (a nonlinear ^(p)) and monofractality (a linear Ç(p)).

1.3 Heart Rate V ariai, .ty as a Complex Dynamics Problem: Turbulence Analogy and Phenomenological Models
It was found that the HRV phenomenology is in many ways compatible to those observed in fluid turbulence. For example, both systems exhibit power law, SEG transition o f the increment PDF and multifractal scaling. This has been known as the turbulence analogy o f long-term HRV [12]. Following this analogy, it was further found that the HRV phenomenology can be effectively captured by using the multiplicative random cascade. The purpose o f this section is to review two recent HRV models; the stochastic feedback model (SFM) and the cascade model. These two models provide a sharp contrast in that SFM relies solely on the additive mechanism to generate HRV, whereas cascade relies on the multiplicative mechanism. Both models provide the reference for the new model proposed in this work.

1.3.1 Stochastic Feedback Model
SFM was introduced by P.C. Ivanov et al. to simulate the 1/f-like power law spectrum in HRV [13]. It was the first model that contains elements related to the physiology of the cardiovascular system. This particular aspect provides the main contrast to the entire phenomenology-- based cascade model introduced in the next. Although SFM contains certain physiology elements, it missed the very basic component of multiplicative mechanism or cascade in HRV.

13

The SFM assumes a time-dependent "equilibrium state" on which the cardiovascular regulation is based. It relies on feedback control to carry out the regulation so that the heart rate can return to the equilibrium state. The quantity that is controlled is exactly the RRi increment At(t) as introduced in Section 1.2. To relate to the physiology, SFM assumes inputs from the SA node activity, I sa, and SNS and PNS activities, /sns and /pns, respectively. The RRi increment is determined based on the rule: Ar(T) = I sa + ZsNS + ipNSHence, the fluctuation is determined entirely by an additive mechanism. Each of the I sa, ZsNs, fpNS has its beat-to-beat "equilibrium state" or set-point value denoted as R sa, .^sns, ^PNS, respectively. These set-point values are themselves random variables subject to some probability laws and correlation. Tire physiological activities I sa, Ism , h m are thus "driven" by the fluctuation of the "equilibrium states."

The SFM was found to be very effective in capturing the 1/f-like power law spectrum of RRi. It also predicts some pathologic states by exploring different combinations of the set-point values. However, these "numerical pathologies" are yet to be verified in clinical data.

1.3.2 Multiplicative Random Cascade Model
The cascade model was first proposed by D.C. Lin and R.L. Hughson to capture a broader range o f HRV characteristics [5]. The model consists o f three elements: the multiplicative data generation, the probability law for the cascade component and the branching rule. Let the cascade RRi between fth and ( t 1) th heart beats be K j (t ) . The

Since A > 1, cOjit) for small j is referred to as the large time scale components, as they fluctuate slowly, and those for large j as the small time scale components, as they fluctuate faster. In this thesis, A = 2 is only considered and the resulting cascade is called the dyadic cascade.

The simulation conducted in the past assumed that cO j it) = Hj +wcr^. where t e { } , //; = 1, and w is a Gaussian variable with <w> = 0 and <w^> = 1. Assuming independent co/tys helps to simplify the analysis and allows one to write down the analytical form of certain statistics [12,14,15]. Using a different distribution for (Djit) will not change the result presented below. Finally, having cr^ varying with j is motivated from the fact that RRi must be bounded. In addition to the obvious upper bound, RRi is also bounded below since the cardiac cells are refractory: namely, there is a finite time period before the cell membrane can be repolarized to propagate nerve impulses [16]. To ensure a

bounded r j{ t) even in the limit J -- >oo, c Tj is assumed to be decreasing in j so cO j (t) 's for small 7 are capable of large amplitude fluctuation and those for large j fluctuate mostly around the mean value 1. The implementation of < X j links the spatial and temporal scales o f ( t) in a specific way: namely, the large amplitude fluctuation is

associated with the large time scale and the small amplitude fluctuation with the small time scale. This spatiotemporal condition further relates the large (small) time scale components to the low ( h i^ ) frequency content r j { t ) . The cascade component with decaying oj has been called bounded cascade in the literature.

Using cTj =cTo2""^-'"'^ with

= 2'''^, a = 0.2 and J = 15, the bounded cascade model is

able to capture the phenomenology summarized in SEC. 1.2 very well. The simulation result is shown in Figure 9.

1.4 Objectives of Thesis
The main objective of the thesis is to further explore the HRV turbulence analogy by considering the hierarchical structure which was recently discovered in fluid turbulence [17]. The existence of the hierarchy provides an interesting alternative for the cascade construction in HRV. It is o f great interest to explore this alternative since the current cascade model contains only a multiplicative mechanism and a biological system is also known to operate via feedback regulation which functions in principle on an addition law.

Chapter 2 The Hierarchical Structure in HRV
In this Chapter, the turbulence analogy of HRV is further exploited and the evidence of a hierarchical structure in the ambulatory daytime RRi taken from healthy subjects is presented. The hierarchy, first proposed by She and Leveque (SL) to understand the statistical properties of turbulent flows [18], provides a successful framework to characterize the deficiency of the Kolmogorov's fluid turbulence theory. In section 2.1, the hierarchy in its fluid turbulence context is reviewed. In section 2 .2 , the idea of turbulence hierarchy is applied to HRV and the evidence o f a HRV hierarchy in the RRi from healthy subjects is showed. In section 2.3, the only known cascade solution that solves the SL hierarchy exactly is introduced. The HRV model proposed in this research is motivated by this solution.

hierarchy captures the law o f energy cascade from the large scale to the small scale. Since 5 " (/) is dominated by the statistics of large Av(/), it characterizes the most intense fluctuation in the turbulence field. Given the scaling law 5^ (/) ~ implies the scaling model [18]: = + (1 0 ) , the hierarchy

where Ag,C are two other parameters of the hierarchy.

Substituting (10) in to (9) and using 5"^ (/) ~

can verify the scaling model and bring

further interpretations of the other parameters. Specifically, the ratios of the structure functions can now be given by:

Substituting (11) and (12) into (9) shows that the hierarchy can be established if and only if 5'" (/) =/^'". Hence, is the scaling exponent for the most intense fluctuation in the

turbulence field. In fluid turbulence, the parameter C measures the codimension of the physical space which is occupied by the flow showing the most intense fluctuation [18].

It thus quantifies the size of the nei^boring space surrounding the most intense structure in the turbulence flow. In isotropic turbulence, a one-dimensional vortex has been suggested to represent such a violent structure. Hence, the corresponding C parameter equals 3 - 1 = 2 . Since the equation of motion of cardiovascular dynamical system has not yet been written down, it is not possible to give a geometrical meaning to the C parameter in HRV. In this thesis, it will only be considered as a codimension parameter.

2.2 Experimental Evidence of She-Leveque Hierarchy in Healthy HRV

Based on the turbulence analogy (section 1.3) and the empirically observed

(t) ~

in HRV, it is reasonable to assume that the hierarchy exists. The purpose of this section is to first formulate the hierarchy analysis in HRV and then to present evidence of the hierarchy in RRi from healthy subjects. To apply the turbulence hierarchy to HRV, the following comparison is made: RRi versus velocity and the temporal scale ( r ) versus the spatial scale (/). Hence, by hierarchy, it means that the same moment relationship (9) applied to the RRi structure fiinction, namely, using = ^|Ar(r)|^^ and substituting rfo r I in (9).

To check the hierarchy, consider for a pair o f fixed Tj andr^ :

If (9) holds, then (15), considered as a function of p , describes a power law with the scaling exponent given by .

To apply this result, 9 sets o f ambulatory RRi recording taken from healthy subjects conducting normal daily activities were used. The actual recording was carried out in 24 hours in The Cardiovascular and Respiratory Dynamics Laboratory at the Kinesiology Department of the University of Waterloo. The participating subjects are volunteers that do not have any record of heart problems (mean age: 25, mean height: 174 cm, mean weight: 74 kg). A standard 2-lead electrocardiogram (EGG) recording was applied with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The demonstrations given in Chapter 1 are taken from this database.

2.3 The She-Way mire Cascade

The She-Waymire (SW) cascade is an exact solution to the SL hierarchy [17]. The philosophy o f the SW cascade forms the basis of the HRV model proposed in this thesis. In this section, the main ingredients of the SW cascade and its relationship with the SL hierarchy will be briefly covered. These ideas in Chapter 3 will be applied to develop the HRV model.

SW cascade is similar to the regular cascade but has a different construction of its cascade components. Since it has its origin in fluid turbulence, spatial scale / will be used again in this section.

The SW cascade assumes, for arbitrary scales /,/,,, that the cascade is given by

H 'CO. \m=l J

,y

(17)

where /3 < 1 is the same parameter used in the SL hierarchy Equation (9) and T is a Poisson random variable. Since0 < yô < 1, the multiplicative of can be considered as a

modulating event. She and Waymire described this term as "defect dynamics," since it creates the effect o f dampening the fluctuation.

The pûi order moment o f Wi, can be written as.

Chapter 3 The Local-Feedback-Global-Caseade M odel

3.1 Motivation
Biological systems normally rely on feedback mechanisms to achieve local regulations that can sometimes create system-wide effects. For example, regional increase of the mean arterial pressure will be sensed and regulated by the vascular system. When the effect of blood pressure increase reaches major barorecepter sites, the effect o f feedback regulation may be sent to the cardiovascular centers in the brain stem to bring about a slower heart rate.

The feedback action is in principle governed by additive laws. Although cascade is able to capture HRV phenomenology very well (section 1.3.2), the additive mechanism is completely missing in its construction. The main objective of the model introduced in this Chapter is to integrate an additive law as local feedback into the cascade. Such a model is called a local-feedback-global-cascade (LFGC) model.

The way the feedback is introduced into the cascade is largely motivated by the empirical observation of SL hierarchy (section 2.2) and the philosophy of the SW cascade. In particular, the modulating effect in the SW cascade is simulated by using feedback. First, the feedback mechanism will be introduced in section 3.2. In Section 3.3, its integration

with the cascade structure will be described. Finally, the numerical experiments to be executed by the LFGC will be given in section 3.4.

3.2 The Local Feedback Law in LFGC
As motivated by the SW cascade, the objective of the feedback in LFGC model is to reduce the fluctuation of the cascade component. The novelty of the model is the introduction of a scheduling law, which determines the timing of the feedback activation for the cascade components. Specifically, the following four assumptions form the basis of the feedback control in LFGC model; A. There exist control set points Vj,j = 1 ,2 ,..., J, for the feedback on the cascade component. B. The control is "one way" based on the a scheduling law: namely, the control applied to the cascade component o f theyth generation is scheduled by the cascade component of the (/ - l)th generation. Hence, it can be said the control is "directed" from the large to the small time scale components. C. The scheduling law is defined by the branching rule of the cascade: namely, the control firom the (/ - l)th generation to the jûi generation will take effect only at the instants when C D j_ ^ changes its value. D. The feedback control is a "mean-field" type position feedback. The objective is to bring the cascade component C O j closer to the mean value jU j according to

(0 = Mj+'wOj (Fj - Bj_^ )

(31)

where w is a the same Gaussian variable defined in the bounded cascade model (Section 1.3.2) and, for t,, = nSj-j, « = 1, 2, ...,

V'=

It is seen that the feedback quantity, as determined by the

parameter, is the average

o f the absolute difference between o /t) and the control set point V j . In this work, Vj will be set to be close to fij and Vj » oj. Hence, when there is a large deviation of cO j (t)

from Vj , Bj_^ will be large. As a result, oej {t) after control will tend to its mean value fij as the factor (Vj in (31) tends to be smaller.

3 3 Integrating feedback to cascade
The integration o f the local feedback into the cascade can be best described by the simulation algorithm of the LFGC time series provided in Figure 12. The actual implementation is carried out by the numerical package MATLAB [19].

The simulation starts by initializing the parameters J, a j , H j , V j , j

..., J. The

calculation starts at r = 1 and ends some pre-set terminal time t = N. The cascade component

C O j is updated randomly according to the branching rule introduced in Section 1.3.2. The feedback control is applied at the instant determined by the scheduling law according to (29). The time for control application is determined based on the assumption C in the previous Section. In numerical simulation, it can be easily found by using the modfunction in MATLAB, i.e. the control is applied whenever mod (ï, 5j_^ ) = 0 (recall < 5 ^ . =2^'^"''\y= 1,..., J). Figure 13 shows the schematics of the scheduling law. This process will repeat until the terminal time / = N is reached. Then, the simulated J LFGC time series rj(t) is obtained by the product

.

3.4 Numerical Experiments
To study the LFGC model, it was considered as being parameterized by four sets of parameters; {Vj, j = \ ~ J ) , { Hj , j = \ ~ J ) , a an do g.

These parameters are varied in the numerical experiment described in this section. For each selected set of parameters, 100 LFGC time series were generated and used to form the ensemble for studying increment PDF, structure function and hierarchy.

In order to make systematic comparisons, the reference using F) = 1 ,

= \ , a = 0.2 and

ao = 2"''^ is defined and is called control case. This set o f parameters was found to capture HRV phenomenology in healthy state very well; see Section 1.3.2.

The numerical experiments conducted in this thesis consist in varying the a and fu parameters o f the model. For the a parameter, it is varied in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 with increment A a = 0.025 (a total of 9 cases). The corresponding model set is referred to as the a -group. For the fi parameter, it is varied from 0.4 to 1.6 with increment A/i = 0.2 (a total of 7 cases) and the corresponding model set is referred to as the fx -group.

The a -group is designed to study the qualitative change o f the scaling property under the influence o f the feedback. It can be shown that the multiplicative mechanism turns into an additive one as a increases [5]. This is due to the fact cr^. = for large a , in which case. and cjj 1

Chapter 4 Simulation Results
In this chapter, the simulation results of the LFGC model described in Chapter 3 v/ill be reported. First, the simulation o f HRV phenomenology summarized in section 1.2 will be shown. Then, evidence o f hierarchy of the SL type will be presented. All computed quantities in the a - and jj. -groups were averaged ftom the ensemble o f 100 sets of LFGC generated time series /y {t) of the corresponding parameter setting.

4.1 LFGC phenomenology

In this section, the phenomenology exhibited by the LFGC generated will be presented. As shown below, the LFGC phenomenology given in this section is consistent with those observed in the real data summarized in section 1.2.

A. 1/f power law
It may be expected that the 1/f-like power spectrum continues to hold in the LFGC generated data since self-similarity was built-in by the branching rule o f the cascade. Indeed, Figures 14 and 15 show such a 1/flaw in the simulated data taken from th ea and fj. -groups respectively. It is seen that a larger a leads to a larger 1/f spectral exponent.

B. Self-similarity
Since self-similarity is bnilt-in from the branching rule o f the cascade, the simulated LFGC time series Tj (t) and the fragmented part o f it should exhibit self-similarity. Figures 18 and 19 show a representative case taken from the a -group with {Vj = 1}, {/ij = I}, a = 0.2 and oo = 2'*'^. Figure 19 shows the segment in the rectangular region o f Figure 18. Self-similar patterns can be seen. The 1/f-like power spectrum and the property o f self-similarity imply a fractal LFGC time series /y (t ) . They suggest more details in the scaling o f LFGC generated time series, as investigated in C and D below.

The simulated LFGC time series Vj (t) were use to calculate its increment according to (1), Ar}(t ) = rj{t + x) - Kj{t). The increment PDF suggests the same SEG transition as observed in Section 1.2. In what follows, the increment PDF's of the simulated time series in a - and /i -groups at different t values are shown. Then, the kurtosis is used to compare the theoretical values o f the SEG transition.

are shown in Figure 26. Except for a = 0.1 ~ 0.175 and /i = 0.6 ~ 0.8, all other cases exhibit the following two properties: (a) the kurtosis of the increment PDF crosses over the theoretical values from exponential to Gaussian distribution as r increases and (b) the kurtosis exhibits a power law relationship with r. The property (a) suggests the SEG transition and the property (b) suggests (r) ~ , following the same argument in

Section 1.2.C that the structure function scaling implies K { x ) ~ x ^ and;;- = ^ (4 )-2 ^ (2). As shown next, the power law structure function can indeed be found in the LFGC generated time series. For the cases which do not show these two characteristics, the kurtosis value is bigger than 3 even for the largest rvalue used in the simulation.

However, the decaying kurtosis curve suggests the transition will eventually take place as the approach to the Gaussian distribution to be realized in much larger rvalue. Compared with the result of the real data (Figure 5), it implies these parameter values cannot be \ used to simulate healthy HRV phenomenology.

Two observations can be made regarding the a -group results: (a) there is less curvature in the ^ (^) in small p a s a increases and (b) there is a saturation o f and the saturation point is located at smaller p values for larger a . (p) =1 in all cases

The first observation (a) is consistent with the past simulation result where a larger a value results in an approximately additive model, which in turns implies a more linear ^ (p) ; see Section 3.3. The second observation (b) is a property of the bounded model. This is because the high order moment is dominated by large increments. Due to the boundedness o f the model, there is a finite cutoff at the tails. This implies Sj p (r) ~ 5p,(r) for/7, p '> 1, and thus C{p) ~C (p') for large p.

For the p -group results, it is seen that the ^ (p) does not vary too much with p . This implies the mismatch between the control set point and the mean value of a> j is not critical for the scaling property to exist.

Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the change of the standard deviation with p in the a --and p -group, respectively. It is seen that a larger a ox p value leads to a smaller standard deviation of Çip).

4.2 Hierarchy

To prove the hierarchical structure in LFGC model, the same approach is followed in Section 2.2 by substituting the structure function o f the LFGC generated /y (r) into (13) and (14); i.e., for a pair o f fixed andz^, consider

Then the power law relationship (16) is checked to validate the hierarchy in the LFGC generated time series:

(IS)

where

(p) = ( s , ,, ( r J / ( r , ) ) / ( 5 , ( r , ) / S ^(z , )).

As p varies from 0.25 to 5, the power law behavior indeed was found when both sides of (16) are plotted on a log-log scale; see Figure 32 and Figure 33 for the typical case (V j1, p =l,û! =0.2). Also, Ti and are varied to check the consistency o f estimate.

Table 4 and Table 5 show the results o f this calculation. The estimated J3 value is found to vary slightly with the t, and Zj parameters, as it should be.

The (5 values o f the a - and p - group are summarized in Figures 34 and 35, respectively. In both cases, the estimates are made for r, =2^ a n d = 2 '°. Figure 33 shows that /?is an increasing function o f a. This is consistent with the model (10) and the Ç{p) results in Section 4.1. For (10), it can be seen that, as /? approaches 1, the corresponding ^(p) becomes more linear. In the Ç{p) results, it was found the consistent result that a larger a implies &Ç(p) with less curvature. Figure 35 shows a similar rising trend between p and p,.

Chapter 5 Conclusion and Future Work

From the simulation results it can be concluded that the LFGC model can effectively capture the HRV phenomenology; including the 1/f power law, self-similarity, SEG transition o f the increment PDF and multifractality. From the signal property point of view, this result implies a rather "stable" cascade-generated HRV phenomenology against "perturbation" by the feedback. In terms of the cardiovascular regulation, the numerical results suggest that feedback plays a less dominant role in the HRV genesis. It can be conjectured that the apparent random fluctuation o f the heart rate is caused by the interaction of the higher control centers in the brain stem and the autonomic nervous system. This view is consistent with the recent study of the prolonged bad rest test [20]: it was found that the feedback-dominant baroreflex mechanism generates very different dynamics in the blood pressure fluctuation than the RRi dynamics.

The observation o f the SL hierarchy in HRV provides the main motivation for the LFGC model. Although comparing the effect of the modulation effect in SW cascade with biological feedback and the scheduling law of the LFGC model are assumptions which cannot be easily verified in physiological terms, LFGC is interesting in its own right as it may represent a second solution to the SL hierarchy besides the SW cascade. However, more numerical tests are necessary to confirm this possibility [21].

The physiological implementation of the numerical results is not clear at this stage. More tests are needed for this purpose in the future. Also, only the parameters a and n are varied. In this work, the influence o f the paiameter Vj to the underlying LFGC phenomenology remains to be tested in the future. It would also be interesting to test the outcomes o f the model by perturbing the cascade, such as its tree structure, distribution of the cascade component, multiplicative law, as well as the feedback control with a different scheduling law.

Appendix A Moments of Product of Ca e Components

The moment of the product of cascade components, which characterizes how the observable varies at different scales, has a relationship with the underlying scales. This can be most easily shown in the cascade generated by independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) components. In fluid turbulence, such a multiplicative structure is normally used to characterize the dissipation and the primary variable of interest is the product o f the cascade components (rather than the increment). In this case, the dependence of the statistics on scales can be found analytically.

Consider the cascade generated by i.i.d. components. The product of the cascade components observed at two scales / and /,, is given by

w 'u =n®.
m --l

where (%'s are assumed i.i.d. Assuming dyadic cascade as in the present work and there are «-generation between scales I and logarithmic scales then/?*-order moment of can be written in

n

u J

where

= log 2 ((^| co 1^^). Hence, the product of i.i.d. random variables on regular dyadic

cascade has its moment statistics dependent on the scales via a power law relationship.

For bounded cascade where the cascade components are not i.i.d., the formulation is more involved. When the primary statistic of interest is the moment o f the increment, such as the structure function, numerical simulation indicated a similar scale dependence relationship [5]. However, no analytical result for the structure function has been worked out for the bounded cascade in the past.
