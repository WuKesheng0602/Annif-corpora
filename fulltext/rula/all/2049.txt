FLEXURAI. STRENGTHENING OF REINFORCED CONCRETE BEAMS W ITH MECHANICAL

Master of Applied Science, Department of Civil Engineering RYERSON UNIVERSITY, Canada, 2004

BONDED STEEL PLATES

ABSTRACT
Steel plate bonding technology is widely accepted for the strengthening o f reinforced concrete structures. Researches in the past showed that epoxy bonded steel plated composite beams are highly prone to variation in temperature and environmental conditions. This research study introduces a novel approach to steel plate composite beam in which bond between the concrete and the steel plate is provided by welding the steel plate to the legs of the uniformly spaced stinmps. Experimental investigation showed that the parameters such as interface connections, geometric dimensions, stirrups spacing and thickness o f steel plate have a gieat influence on the strength, deformation and failure characteristics o f such composite beams. A finite element model has been developed using commercial software, ABAQUS, to predict the strength of such composite beams and its perfoimance is validated through experimental results. The direct finite element simulation o f proposed composite beams with developed finite element model gives an average o f experimental to predicted strength ratio of 0.99, which confirms the accuracy o f prediction. The finite element model is then used to simulate a large number o f numerical beams with varying geometric and material properties to formulate design guidelines. Design charts are developed and their performance is validated tlirough test results with experimental to design chart predictions giving an average value o f 0.94. Design procedures for such beams are illustrated with calculated design examples. Such simple design procedures can be adopted in the actual design o f proposed composite beams in practical applications.

Introduction

Need for Strengthening Structures

A large number of reinforced concrete infrastructures in the U.S. and Canada are structurally deficient by today's standards and are cuirently deteriorating much faster than they are being rehabilitated or replaced. The main contributing factors are changes in their use, an increase in load requirements, or deterioration due to exposure to an aggressive environment. In order to preserve those infrastructures, rehabilitation is often considered essential to maintain their capability and to increase public safety. Busel and Bamo (1996) stated that tire estimated size of U.S concrete construction market was $8 billion/year, of which 70% is for repairs and remediation services, whereas only 30% (2.4 billion) is for new construction. In Canada, the infrastructure deficit - the gap

I

between needed and actual infrastructure investment --is estimated to be $74 billion (ISIS Canada 1997; Neale 2001).

Î

In Alberta, more than 5000 bridges require retrofitting in the next 10-20 years due to increase o f 30% of truckloads with less design requirement at the time, when these

Î

bridges were built. Another emerging problem parallel to bridge rehabilitation is the deterioration o f parking garages (Bonaci and Maalej 2000; Ali and Oehlers 2003).

Strengthening of a structural member is required when the strength o f the existing

instances where the capacity has been reduced by environmental effects, manmadt hazards, or human error, such as a tall vehicle striking the girders beneath a bridge etc.

If load resisting strength o f a structure is taken as a function o f time and taking int< consideration other factors, which are causing reduction in the strength o f structure, it cai be observed that strength of structures is decreasing with time while the load for wliicl the structure was designed is increasing (Mirza et al. 2003). Fig. 1.1, represents genera durability design procedure for structure having load "S (t)" and resistance "R (t)" as function of time (Siemes 1996).

In this sense, damage tolerance is defined as the ability o f a material or stnicture to resist failure and continue performing at prescribed levels of performance in the presence o f flaws, cracks, or other forms o f damage/degradation for a specified period o f time under specified environmental conditions. The overall concept is shown schematically in Fig. 1.2 (Kabahari et al. 2003).

This research deals with the 2"^* period presented in Fig. 1.1 and concentrates on the residual life of a structure in which effort has been made to strengthen the structural performance and to increase the residual life rather than demolish the whole structure and built a new one, depending on severity of deterioration and financial conditions.

Identification of Problems and Prediction of Solution

Columns and beams are frequently wrapped with steel or fiber reinforced polymer (FRP] laminates to increase the capacity and to make them behave in a ductile manner, A common strengthening method currently in use is to use adhesive bond strips or "thit plates" o f steel or FRP laminates bonded to the surface o f concrete beams or slabs tc strengthen in shear or flexure depending upon the distress mechanism.

The bond between concrete and composite plates, using epoxy is highly prone to thi temperature and enviromnent (Tadeu and Branco 2000). In addition, the method o construction such as surface preparation, drying time and maintaining appropriât thickness o f adhesive layers is found to have a great influence on overall strength o structural components (Chajes et al. 1996; Tureyen and Frosch 2002). Hence, it i desirable to develop new, innovative, optimized strengthening techniques, which ar simple as well as cost effective. Advance composites such as Carbon Fiber Reinforce Polymer (CFRP) and Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) are not easily available o the market and strengthening reinforced concrete stractures using these composite require high cost as compared to conventional composites such as steel plate. Thi situation reflects the attention o f researchers towards the commonly available and loi cost material, steel.

Typical reinforced concrete flexural members are designed such that the tensile stei reinforcement yields well before the concrete fails in compression. This desig methodology results in a ductile member, wliich undergoes large deflection when tf load approaches the ultimate capacity. The use o f larger amount o f tensile stei

reinforcement which lead to an over reinforced member is not desirable because o f the prospect o f a concrete crushing failure associated w ith lower ductility.

Strengthening o f reinforced concrete flexural members by using external steel strips began in the late 1960s. These early methods consisted of bonding a steel strip to the tension side o f an existing flexural member with an epoxy. The concrete surface has to be made smooth, which required careful grinding, sandblasting, and priming. Typically, anchor bolts at the ends o f the steel strip are used, mainly to prevent the steel strip from falling if the integrity o f the adhesive is destroyed by fire (Garden and Hollaway 1998).

The adhesive layer between concrete and FRP strip can cause problems and can govern the behavior o f the strengthened member. Peeling stresses are induced at the ends o f the FRP or steel strip, which tend to pull the strip away from the concrete. If these peeling stresses are larger than the strength o f the adhesive, the strip will peel away from the beam suddenly, resulting in the loss o f strength, and may cause a sudden and undesirable failure. The strip can also detach if the vertical displacement o f two sides o f cracks occurs on tension face of strengthened member that contact the adhesive layer, resulting sudden failure without warning (Marco and Nanra 1997). ^

Plan of Investigations

To conduct the research efficiently, a plan o f investigation has been developed so that each part o f the research can contribute in a meaningful way to the overall research. First, an experimental data is collected fi-om previous research projects (Nupiri 2000, Jim 1999, Hossain 2001).

Strengthening of Reinforced Concrete Beams with Adhesively Bonded Steel Plates

The first documented application of externally bonded steel plate for repairing or strengthening o f reinforced concrete (RC) stimctures was found in 1964, when the

basement beams of an apartment complex in South Africa were strengthened with epoxy bonded steel plate because o f accidental omission of steel reinforcements during construction (Xanthakos 1996). Thereafter, this technique was used to sti'engthen a variety of structures in various countries. The types o f application of steel plate bonding based on the infrastructure statistics for the past 30 years are illustrated in Fig. 2.1 (Bonaci and Maalej 2000).

Debonding of Steel Plates Due to Flexural and Shear Peeling Stresses

Reinforced concrete beams can be strengthened and stiffened by gluing steel plates to the tension face o f the concrete. This procedure has been used to repair buildings (Van Gemert 1981) and to strengthen bridges (1978) and it has been used in various countries (Jones et al. 1988). Despite the overwhelming strength enhancement provided by the steel plate when bonded with epoxy resin, many of the research goes into studying because of tire un-confmement o f steel plate (not gripped) with concrete that results in peeling o f the plate under increasing curvature o f the beam as shown in Fig. 2.2 (Oehlers and Moran 1990).

Hermite and Bresson (1967) carried out tests on concrete beams with steel plate bonded by epoxy resins to the tension surface. Tests were also performed on beams constructed by pouring concrete into U-shaped permanent forms coated with epoxy resin.

Solomon et al. (1976) working at the Wolfson Bridge Unit at Dundee University performed a series o f flexural tests on double skin slabs and beams and investigated the suitability o f the design procedures. Two types o f specimens were considered, one where steel plates were glued on both faces o f the hardened concrete core and the others where casting of concrete were performed directly against steel plates coated with adhesives in the mould. The failure o f all beams took place after the slippage between the tensile plate and the concrete core at interface before the yielding in steel plate except in one test where yield stress was achieved. The strain in the upper s.eel plate remained well below the yield strength with no indication o f buckling prior to failure reported. Mays and Smith (1980) updated the work carried out at the Wolfson Bridge Research Unit and confirmed the viability o f bonded steel plates as a viable structural option but suggested further work was required on the long temi durability and perfonnance under actual traffic conditions.

compositely. For optimum strength and ductility, a 1-mm minimum adhesive thickness was suggested.

MacDonald (1978) reported on a series o f tests on reinforced concrete beams with steel plates bonded to their tension flanges. The tests cormected to the possible use for increasing the load capacity o f existing bridges. An interesting result o f the experiments was the failure of the beams at load similar to that of the unplated beams because of premature failure at the interface of the steel plate and the concrete. Variables such as type o f resins, thickness o f plate, the effect o f load cycling had little effect on the load causing plate separation.

Based on the experimental study (Oehlers and Moran 1990), it was concluded that the presence o f stirrups in reinforced concrete beams can increase the shear strength of beams by up to a factor o f six but the load at which the peeling occurred does not increase. Therefore, it was assumed that the shear peeling is a function o f shear strength o f the beam without stirrups, which is the strength that can be found in most of the codes.

Oehlers (1992) found a very strong inter-relation between flexural and shear peeling of the plate. Based on the failure envelope plotted with the slope o f one and through all the mean values o f experimental results as shown in Fig. 2.3, the recommended design procedure as represented in Eq. 2.1, for platting the soffit of reinforced concrete beams so that the plate does not debond until the design load is reached.

Hamoush and Ahmad (1990) developed a finite element model to investigate the failure mechanism by interface debonding o f the plate and the adhesive layer due to high interface shear stresses, which exist at the interface. Investigation also includes the variation o f critical strain energy release rate, which causes the interfacial crack to propagate.

It was concluded that the strain energy release rate peaks when the ratio o f interfacial crack length to the half o f beam span reaches 0.083 that correspond to the crack length of 100 mm (Hamoush and Ahmad 1990). This indicates that the shear stress distribution at the crack tip is maximum where the lengtlr o f interfacial crack is approximately equal to

the height of flexural crack. It was also concluded that the presence o f large number of flexural cracks (greater than five) releases the shear stresses at the interface and leads to the reduction o f strain energy release rate and stress intensity factor. The proposed design rule represented by Eq. 2.2 includes the critical load (Per) as a function o f the applied load (?applied) and the strain energy release rates Gcr and GappHed- The teirn G c can be computed through experimental and analytical procedures.

M any of the research in the early 1990s were concentrated on the behavior o f stress transfer through bond at the concrete-steel plate interface. Chajes et al. (1996) played a vital role in investigating the behavior o f the force transfer tlnough bond and length of plate required based on single lap shear test. According to the study, if the failure mode o f the joint is governed by the shearing o f the concrete directly beneath the bond, the value of ultimate bond strength will be proportional to · The strain distribution

along the bonded length decreases at fairly linear rate (especially at or below service load levels) meaning that the force transfer is largely uniform which lead to a constant value id o f bond resistance (R).

curtailment and quickly diminishes near the high moment varying zone. Furthermore, the biggest geometrical influence on the level o f shear and peeling stresses is the distance between the support and the plate end. In order to minimize these stresses, the distance of plate end from the support should be kept minimum. Also, increasing stiffness o f epoxy or steel plate increases shear and peeling stresses at the plate end.

Tadeu et al. (2000) showed the other factors such as temperature variation and type of concrete have a great influence on the occurrence of failure as they performed shear test under high temperature. According to them, at 60 °C, epoxy such as SIKA ICOSIT K-AC loses half of its strength, and at about 90 °C, the strength reduces to 24-29%. Moreover, at 120 °C, a film o f water was observed on the surface o f the concrete, in addition to the deterioration o f the resin. This may be caused by the release o f free water present within the concrete by evaporation at 100 °C. The migration o f free water causes the appearance o f pressure on the bond, contributing to tlie failures.

Aprile et al. (2001) used the bond slip model proposed by Spacone and Limkatanyu (2000) and developed a simple and accurate displacement-based fiber frame element to evaluate the shear stress distribution under increasing load by taking into account all the nonlinearity o f material including tension stiffening o f concrete. They concluded that the failure o f plated beams always started by plate debonding, either at plate ends or somewhere in a cracked concrete zone.

Leung (2000) further worked out on a model based on fracture mechanics to find the combination o f parameters affecting the delamination o f steel plate v/ith respect to shear stresses fonned under increasing load. It was concluded that delamination was favored by large member sized, low adhesive thickness, low plate stiffness and small contact area between plate and adhesive. This was contrary to the statement o f Oehlers and All (2003) that beams plated over part o f their width had an increased flexural peeling strength.

A new approach was implemented after realizing the fact that the brittle failure (shear bond failure) initiated, when the plate ends were placed in predominantly shear regions. The model proposed is represented in Eq. 2.5, which is based on plasticity concept for shear strength in reinforced concrete plated beams. The proposed diagonal cracking load can be obtained by taking moments o f all the forces about point O, as shown in Fig. 2.6.

Hui-Shen and Yang (2001), found that all the previous theories about interfacial shear stress between steel plate and concrete had suffered from some limitations. It was observed that, the maximum value o f the shear stress at adhesive-to-concrete interface is slightly greater than the plate-to-adhesive interface but the maximum value o f normal stress at the concrete-to-adhesive interface is much greater than that o f the plate-toadhesive interface, indicating that the adhesive-to-concrete is much more critical interface for debonding failure.

Mukhopadhyaya and Swamy (2001) realized the urgent need for the development o f a simple model for design against debonding o f plated beams. To capture the influencing parameters that caused premature debonding failure, the experimental investigation done by Robert (1989) was carefully reviewed (Mukhopadhyaya and Swamy 2001). It was concluded that, the value o f the shear stress at which plate debonding failure occurs was influenced by the elastic modulus o f the plate material (E), stress-strain profile o f the plate material, ratio o f moment canies by the internal reinforcing bars to that o f moment carries by external plate, geometry o f beam, the shear span to depth ratio and also to a lesser extent, by the concrete strength.

It has also been documented that to prevent abrupt debonding failure at the plate end, bolt shear connectors can be used to increase the resistance against debonding o f epoxy bonded steel plated beams. However, according to Ali and Oehlers (2003), it is not

20

recommended to apply such a technique because the bolted shear connector requires interface slip to transfer shear stresses and hence adhesively bonded steel plate will debond before the bolts become active.

Parallel to adhesive bonded connections, mechanical connections have also been facilitated. Solomon (1976) & Solomon and Goplani (1979) described a series o f 5 tests on beams externally reinforced by a single 1.84 m m thick mild steel sheet o f 4 m length and 0.36 m width. The stirrups were welded to the surface o f the sheet. The beams were tested under four points loading and deflection and strains in concrete and steel were recorded during the test. No bond failure at the steel concrete interface nor indication o f shear cracking within the shear span was observed. All beams collapsed due to the

failure of the upper concrete in flexural compression following tension yielding o f the lower steel sheet. Solomon et al. (1979) concluded that the beams satisfied the ultimate and serviceability requirements and that the main economics o f this approach would be in the ease o f constmction and the reduction in reinforcing steel and form work.

One o f the largest bodies o f work investigating the application o f double skin composite beams and columns where mechanical devices are used to secure bond between steel and concrete has been performed at the University o f W ales College o f Cardiff. The system was originally devised for submerged tube tunnels (Fig. 2.7) by a team o f consultants in Cardiff (Tomlinson and Partners with Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners). The system proposed by Naraynan et al. (1987) consisted o f a double-skin steel plated construction

The advantages over traditional reinforced concrete tunnels included fabrication in sections, speedier construction and better quality control. Also, in conventional concrete tube tunnels, an outer steel layer is required to ensure water tightness but w ith external steel skin reinforcements, this would not be required. Tests were performed on full and half scale models o f the tunnel sections.

The h a lf scale tests with a rectangular cross-section 250 mm deep x 800 mm w ide and 4 m long had steel plates 6 ram and 3 mm thick secured to the outside and inside o f the concrete by 6 m m diameter m ild steel bolts. The failure o f the beams in simply supported and cantilevered tests was exhibited by shear cracks developing in the concrete at the quarter span positions with steel plate buckling and yielding accompanied by stud shearing.

This type o f failure was prevented by introducing long studs to provide shear reinforcement. Local buckling o f the compression plate reduced the value o f ultimate load in some tests and so a maximum stud spacing/plate thickness ratio o f 30 was proposed. Oduyemi and W right (1989) concluded that flexural failure o f the beam could be realized by providing short studs to transfer shear bond and long studs to carry diagonal tension stresses. In order to take account o f the effects o f combined shear, axial and bending stresses, the design strength o f the shear studs was recommended to be 55% in the tension zone and 80% in the compression zone o f the ultimate strength obtained firom push-out tests.

Oduyemi and Wright (1990) continued the previous investigations by testing 12 scale model beam/column elements. There were three groups o f 4 tests each. The first group o f tests investigating the variations in the axial load failed in a flexural manner w ith cracks appearing at higher load levels for greater axial loads. In the second group, where the spacing between the connectors varied, those tests with the studs closely spaced failed in flexure while the later tests with studs further apart collapsed due to longitudinal shear. In the final group looking at the effect o f thickness, the tests with thin plates failed in flexure because o f yielding o f the steel and the test witli thickest plate shear studs failed, before yield, at the steel/concrete interface. The authors concluded that the shear connection at the tension plate was critical in determining the behavior o f the element but with correct design, predictable critical loads could be achieved.

Kountoris (1990) produced design charts for the double skin composite elements based on the requirements of BS8110 with modifications to take account o f failure at the steel/concrete interface. The design curves showed greater convergence to experimental as the load eccentricity increased probably because flexural rather than axial failure 1 occurred.

Wright, Oduyemi and Evans (1991) described design developments based on the series of tests on double skin beams, columns and beam/columns. The design basis was similar to that o f reinforced concrete but with the additional considerations of the possibility of plate buckling and adequate provision o f shear connector. The ultimate strength in bending was based on the BS8110 stress block with a partial safety factor of 1.5 on the concrete and 1.15 of the steel strength. These equations assumed full connection between the steel plate and the concrete, which require sufficient shear connectors capable of transferring the full yield load to the steel. Design recommendations were made to avoid buckling o f compression plate, for basic design shear strength and for combined axial and bending effects. f I ;ï ! y i : , | ; I ^ ;

Previous research (Oehlers 1992) has shown that this system has many

ad\fantages: the side profiled sheets can substantially increase the flexural strength without loss of ductility and are more ductile than reinforced concrete beams o f same flexural strength; the side sheets also increase the sheai- strength and shear ductility; encasement o f concrete reduces shrinkage and creep of concrete, which can reduce deflections by as much as 40% and allow an increase in span/depth ratio o f the order o f 20%. Oehlers found that the flexural strength o f the profiled beams can be affected by the local buckling o f the sheet between the ribs of the decking.

Oehlers, Wright and Burnet (1994) developed simple design procedures to prevent local buckling o f the profiled sheeting before the ultimate strength is reached, and to determine the flexural strength o f the beam for various strength o f shear bond which allows for the variation in the bond forces at the interface due to slip. They confnmed that the shear bond failure has only a small effect on the ultimate strength.

Foley and Buckhouse (1999) proposed a technique, which was very simple and devoid of complex formulas as basic principle o f reinforced concrete was used in design. They successfully tried to increase the capacity and stiffness by bonding steel channels through bolts at regular intervals on the underside o f concrete, but they also informed the lack o f ductility at ultimate stages.

New A pproach to Steel Plate Bonding

A new approach to steel plate bonding in which steel plate was welded to the legs o f the uniformly distributed stirrups to alleviate the complexities associated with the peeling

26

stress developed in the epoxy bonded steel plate (Hossain 1999, Jim 1999, Nupiri 2000, Kashif et al. 2004) as shown in Fig. 2.9. The advantages of this technique are to utilize the stirrups (embedded in concrete beams) for two purposes: (a) to provide adequate shear resistance (b) To provide plate with a strong mechanically bonded connections in resisting horizontal slip.

t
In this system, shear stirrups are supposed to act like a shear stud and provide resistance to both diagonal tension failure and horizontal slip at the connection. This technique also has a potential to be used to construct beams and girders in bridges and buildings. Failure of such beams was found to depend on the mode o f interface connection, geometric dimensions of beams, and spacing of shear reinforcement and thickness o f steel plate (Hossain 2001, Hossain 1999). Depending on the relative influence o f such parameters, the beams failed either by tearing of steel plate or by interface failure (without horizontal

slip).

Test results showed that beams welded with relatively thin plates (i.e. 0.5 mm etc.) failed by tearing o f sheets rather than due to crushing o f concrete at the top or by failure at the spot welded locations as found in beams welded with thicker steel plate (Hossain 1999).

The technique o f welding steel plate with stud embedded in concrete shows a simple and straightforward procedure in designing double skin sandwich composite beams and columns. The failure associated with horizontal slip, buckling o f composite plate was determined, and design guidelines have been proposed to overcome these kinds o f failure modes (Wright, Oduyemi and Evans 1991). Similar to that approach, a procedure for strengthening reinforced concrete beams with welded steel plate to the legs o f stirrups is proposed to overcome some o f the problems associated with adhesively bonded composites techniques as discussed earlier.

This new strengthening system also has potential to be used as a new technique to effectively construct beams or girders in buildings, bridges and other forms o f new constmction. The problems associated with adhesives is removed using strong spot

welded connection and the variation in temperature as well as complex design calculation for limiting adhesive thickness, extensive surface preparation and provision for adhesive drying time are completely eliminated. Moreover, the problem o f flexural and shear peeling stress that can cause debonding o f steel could be converged into two simple modes o f failure such as tearing o f plate and failure o f spot weld. Failure o f spot weld in beams welded with thicker plate was also reported (Hossain 1999, Nupiri 2000, Hossain
2001 ).

The literature review suggests the novelty o f this fonn o f constmction. Currently design guidelines are not available for this new form of constmction and hence, there is a need for the development o f design guidelines. The current research will focus on this aspect. Comprehensive finite element analysis based on experimental results will be conducted in order to develop a reliable finite element model, which can be used to simulate numerous computer model beams with variable geometric and material properties. The results fi-om computer model beams will be used to develop quick, simple and accurate design guidelines for practical applications.

A New Approach to Steel Plate Bonding Technique: Review o f Experimental Investigations

3.1.

Introduction

This chapter describes the proposed strengthening technique in details with its application procedures for frequent field applications and enlightens the significance o f this technique over other prevailing techniques. Experiments conducted by Jim (1999) and Nupiri (2000) on beams with the proposed strengthening technique reported by Hossain (2001), are described in order to understand the overall behavior and failure modes o f member strengthen with such a technique. Factors affecting the strength and failure modes of beams with the proposed strengthening technique are critically reviewed so that they can be used for efficient modeling o f such a system by finite element analysis.

3.2.

Introduction of New Approach

Conventional methods using epoxy bonded steel plates for strengthening reinforced concrete members have shown problems with epoxy, surface preparation techniques and premature debonding. The proposed method with steel plate mechanically bonded to the stirrup through welded connections (Fig. 2.9) can avoid deficiencies observed in conventional methods. The variables affecting the performance o f such beams are the strength o f weld, geometric properties o f beam, thickness o f the steel plate and the amount o f longitudinal and shear reinforcement o f the existing beam. Strength o f spot weld can vary in order to achieve desired contact stiffness. Steel plate o f optimum size

should be selected as welding may cause some material damage due to residual stress depending on the strength and thickness o f steel plate. Compatibility o f weld strength and the strength o f steel plate and stirrups should he analyzed prior to implement this technique.

3.3.

Characteristics of Proposed Technique

This technique can avoid peeling o f plates as well as temperature effects on bonding as observed in epoxy-bonded methods. The potential pre-fabrication o f this technique and avoidance o f extensive surface preparation for epoxy bonding or complex procedure associated with bolting o f steel plate to concrete can be contributing factors to make this system as a simple and cost effective in construction. The use o f unskilled labor and reduction in construction time can also lead to cost effective solution to upcoming needs for strengthening.

This

strengthening technique offers

different arrangement o f steel plates

for

strengthening. Typical forms o f such beams with various modes o f mechanical connections are shown in Fig 3.1 (a-d). Main reinforcement can also be used with steel : i plates to strengthen beams as shown in Fig. 3.1(b-c). Two steel plates can be used inside the stirrups for ease in casting o f concrete as shown in Fig. 3.1(c). This form o f arrangement has also a potential to be use in new construction. The stirrup-plate assembly ? acts as both shear and m ain reinforcement in such beams.

Field A pplication P ro ced u re

The proposed technique is simple to implement in retrofitting or strengthening damaged beams. Normally concrete cover from existing beams is chipped o ff to expose the steel stirrups. The stirrups are then cleaned with wire brush to remove dust and stains. The steel plate o f optimum tliickness (as per design) is then placed parallel to tension face o f existing concrete members and welded to the legs o f stirrups. M ore or less the same procedure can be adopted with different plate arrangement shown in Fig. 3.1 (a-d). For ease in construction at site, the following procedure can be adopted: (a) steel plate-

3.5.

Experimental Studies

Comprehensive series o f tests were conducted to investigate the behavior o f such composite beam s (Hossain 2001, Hossain 1999, Jim 1998, Nupiri 2000). Heavily instrumented tests provided details information on the load deflection response and failure modes o f the system. Test parameters included were: · · · · Spacing o f shear reinforcement, M echanical bonding at interface, Thickness o f steel plate, and Longitudinal reinforcement.

Two series o f beams w ill be the focus o f attention throughout the research and describe as series 1 and series 2 beams. Series 1 beams have steel plate-stirraps assembly without longitudinal reinforcement while series 2 beams have 5-mm diameter longitudinal reinforcement (Hossain 2001).

Fabrication, Casting, Curing and Material Properties

The stirrups-steel plate-main reinforcement assembly for each o f beam s was fabricated first (Hossain 2001). Connection between steel plate and stirrups was provided b y spot welding. The whole assembly was then placed in w ooden mould for casting concrete (Fig. 3.3). Compaction o f concrete was done by poker vibrator in a single layer. Control concrete cylinders and cubes were cast at the same time for compressive strength test. The beams were remolded after 24 hours o f casting and m oist cured until tested at 30^ day.

Failure Modes of Tested Beams Beams with 0.4-mm Thick Plate

Failure modes in all beams having 0.4-mm thick plate were initiated with the initial debonding o f the steel plate between adjacent spot-weld locations. Progressive loading yielded further initiation o f cracks starting from the bottom and propagating towards the center o f the beam as represented in Fig. 3.7. Beam S 1B 50 and SiBioo failed by tearing of plate with cracking extended to the full depth o f the beam.

For SiBiso and SjBiso beams, the failure was due to the insufficient shear reinforcement. Series 2 beams, failed by tearing o f steel plate with the development o f cracks extending up to full depth o f beams. Failure o f both Series 1 and Series 2 beams was predominantly due to tearing o f plate because o f excessive flexural stresses as shown in Fig 3.7 and Fig. 3 j.

It is worth noting that in all tested beams, failure was either due to the tearing o f sheeting or weld failure. SjBioo beam showed large deflection among those o f series 1 beams. This might be due to the fact that the cracks propagated very quickly to the compression zone resulting in crushing at the top. Flexure cracks also induced interface shear between spot welded sections o f the steel plate. S 2B 50 failed predominantly in flexure due to tearing of plate followed by flexure cracks propagated straight to the top. S2 B 100, S2 B 150 and S 2B 180 beams failed in a mixed mode o f flexure-shear failure with tearing o f plate as shown in Fig. 3.8.

Fig. 3.9(a-b) shows the variation o f strain with load for Series 1 and Series 2 beams. The tensile strains in the steel in Series 2 beams were found to be greater then those in Series 1 beams. This may he due to the fact that the cracks in concrete propagated very quickly to the compression zone and crushing failure at the top eventually led to the fracture o f steel plate and the heam collapsed.

All beams in Series 1, S 1B 50 , SiBioo, SjBiso and SiBjgo failed due to peeling o f steel plate as a result spot weld failure and propagation o f flexural cracks started from mechanical joint location up to the full depth of beam with some inclination towards the center. Peeling o f the bottom steel plate as a consequence o f spot weld failure extended from the supports towards the center as the beams reached its ultimate load carrying capacity as shown in Fig. 3.10.

In Series 2 beams, the failure was found to be due to the crushing o f concrete because o f flexural cracks that extended towards the top nearly about three quarters to the total depth of the beam during the loading history (Nupiri 2000 and Hossain 2001). These beams failed at much higher loads as compared to the beams without longitudinal reinforcements as shown in Table 3.3. It was also observed that beams with lower stirrup spacing such as S2B 50 and S2 B 100, initiated more flexural cracks than beams with 150 m m and 180 mm spacing o f stirrups (Nupiri 2000 and Hossain 2001).

Effect of Variable Parameters on Failure Modes of Pilot Beams

Two kinds o f failure modes were observed when analyzing two series o f beams having steel plate without longitudinal reinforcement and steel plate with internal longitudinal reinforcement respectively, with varying steel plate thickness and stirrups spacing: (a) Debonding o f spot weld, (b) Tearing o f steel plate.

For beams having 0.4-mm thick steel plate o f without longitudinal reinforcement, the load at which the first debonding occurred was higher as compared to the same beam having closely spaced stirrups (Table 3.3). However, beams with 3-mm thick steel plate with higher stirrup spacing showed higher first debonding load than those with less spacing stirrups. The presence o f longitudinal reinforcement increased the loading carrying capacity of beams (Table 3.3).

For beams having thin steel plate (0.4-mm) with internal reinforcement, the failure occurred due to the tearing o f plate as shown in Fig. 3.8, rather than failure o f spot-weld connections. This might be due to the reason that the presence o f longitudinal reinforcement gave relaxation to the shear/peeling stresses occurred at the interface connection o f steel plate and concrete via spot weld.

Experiments had shown that by increasing the plate thickness (3-mm), the mode o f failure o f such beams had been shifted to shear rather than flexure in the presence o f internal longitudinal reinforcement as the amount o f tensile reinforcement in teims o f greater thickness o f steel plate was provided.

For beams without tensile reinforcement and reinforced with thick plate, failure happened due to the failure o f weld as the stirrups alone were responsible for the strength o f mechanical connection (Fig. 3.10). Moreover, failure o f Series 2 beams (having internal longitudinal tensile reinforcement) due to tearing o f the tliin plate as shown in Fig. 3.8, can be eliminated by using steel plate o f optimum thickness and high strength o f spot weld.

Load -Deflection Responses of Beams Beams with 0.4mm Thick Plate

Load - deflection responses for Series 1 and Series 2 beams with 0.4 mm thick steel plate are compared in Fig. 3.10. For Series 1 beams, the ultimate load decreased with the increase o f the spacing o f stirrups as spacing o f stirrups is directly associated with the strength o f connection.

For Series 2 beams, the spacing o f stirrups had little or negligible effect on the ultimate load, as the failure load o f all beams was found to be the same as shown in Fig. 3.11. Tliis

might be due to the fact that the strength enhancement due to the presence o f longitudinal reinforcement superseded the benefit o f thin gauge steel plate.

Beams with 3-mm Thick Plate

Load deflection responses o f Series 1 and Series 2 beams are presented in Fig. 3.13. It is found clearly that the spacing o f stirrups has great influence on ultimate load carrying capacity and corresponding deflection. Beams having closely spaced stirrups exhibited much higher load than beams with increased stirrup spacing. In addition, it was observed from both Series 1 and Series 2 beams that the ultimate load decreased proportionally w ith the increase o f the stirrup spacing as shown in Fig. 3.13 and Fig. 3.14. S2 B 50 beam failed at m uch higher load though it was a singly reinforced beam but it had closely spaced stirrups. S2 B 100 , S2 B 150 and S2B 180 beams showed proportional decrease in failure load with reduced deflection as these beams were doubly reinforced (Fig. 3.14). The increase in plate thickness in Series 2 beams, changed the mode o f failure to brittle shear failure (leading to the debonding o f plate due to weld failure) rather than plate tearing as additional plate thickness together with internal longitudinal reinforcement increased the reinforcement ratio corresponding to the cross section o f the beam.

Effect of Variable Parameters on Ultimate Load-Deflection Response

Comparative study to analyze the effect o f the presence o f internal longitudinal reinforcement on ultimate load and central deflection o f beams is shown in Fig. 3.15 and Fig. 3.16. It is clearly seen from Fig. 3.15 and Fig. 3.16, that the presence o f internal longitudinal reinforcement has a great influence on the ultimate load carrying capacity o f the beam. Moreover, the stirrup spacing has small or negligible influence on the ultimate load of the beams with thin steel plate and with longitudinal reinforcement as compared to the beam without reinforcement. This might be due to the fact that the strength enhancement due to the presence o f longitudinal reinforcement superseded the benefit of thin plate as tension reinforcement. Moreover, the presence o f internal steel increases the ultimate deflection as depicted from Fig. 3.17 and Fig. 3.18.

The influence o f stirrup spacing has little or negligible effect on ultimate load carrying capacity and deflection associated with ultimate failure (Fig. 3.15) but their variation affected the mode o f failure. For example, if closely spaced stirrups are used with thin plate, the mode of failure will be pure flexure with tearing o f steel plate as concluded from Table 3.3. Increase in stirrup spacing can result in tearing o f thin plate after that shear cracks heading towards the top of beam with certain inclination (Jim 1998, Hossain

2001 ).

More or less the beam will follow the same behavior if relatively thick steel plate is used but this time, failure will happen at the interface connection (weld location) rather than plate tearing due to increased capacity o f thick steel plate (Fig. 3.10). Increasing o f the spacing o f stirrups for beams having thick plate may result in shear failure combined with peeling o f plate due to weld failure (Table 3.3).

As shown in Fig. 3.19 and Fig. 3.20, the ultimate load increases with the increase o f plate thickness i.e. beam with thick plate (3-mm) failed at a higher load than those with thin plate (0.4 mm). Moreover, it is evident that the increase in plate thickness converts failure mode from ductile (flexure failure combined with tearing o f plate) to brittle failure (peeling o f plate due to welded failure at the interface o f concrete and steel plate) as mentioned in Table 3.3.

The effect o f plate thickness on deflection o f beams is much greater (40 to 50% reduction in deflection) than the effect o f variable stirrup spacing in such beams.

with increasing plate thickness but failure mode had been changed from tearing o f steel plate to debonding due to failure at spot welded connection (Jim 1999 and Nupiri 2000).

It was well understood from the tests that the performance o f such beams depends on the steel plate o f optimum thickness and effective shear connection devices that did not fail prematurely (Hossain 2001). The steel-plate stirrups assembly can be used for strengthening purposes instead o f steel plate alone, with high strength spot weld to give more strength to this kind o f mechanical connections.

From experimental observations, it is concluded that the factors such as variation in steel plate thickness, stirrups spacing and the presence o f internal longitudinal reinforcement have great influence on the failure modes and ultimate strength o f the such novel form beams. These factors are taken into consideration for the development o f finite element model and design guidelines.

Introduction

This chapter describe in details, the development o f a finite element model to simulate the behavior o f experimental beams discussed in Chapter 3, using general purpose finite element software, ABAQUS (Abaqus User's Manual Voulime 1, 2004). In this chapter an arbitrary experimental beam (SaBioo) with 0.4-mm thick plate (Jim 1999), has been selected and idealized into numerical model using finite element and its performance has been checked using various types o f elements and its compatibility with different types of interface connections. A finite element model is then selected to analyze the behavior of all 8-experimental beams (Jim 1999, Hossain 2001) with 0.4-mm thick steel plate and to validate the performance o f the developed finite element model.

A schematic representation of general beam is shown is Fig. 4.1. Reinforced concrete beam having longitudinal bars embedded in the concrete while steel plate connected to different interface connections in order to check their performance. Shear reinforcements are introduced in terms o f uniformly spaced steel stirrups.

An arbitrary experimental beam, S2B 100 (Jim 1999, Hossain 2001) o f Chapter 3, having a cross-section o f 100 mm x 150 mm with an effective length o f 800 mm, is selected and idealized numerically using the finite element model. (

Modeling the Non-Linear Behavior of Concrete Cracking Behavior of Concrete

The development of a model for the behavior o f concrete is a challenging task because it behaves differently under uni-axial and multi-axial loading conditions. In this model, concrete is assumed to be an isotropic material prior to cracking. The response of concrete that is incorporated in the model is illustrated by the uni-axial response o f a specimen shown in Fig. 4.3.

A smeared cracking approach is used to represent the cracked concrete as an orthotropic material in the sense that it does not track individual "micro cracks" . Consecutive calculations are performed independently at each integration point in the finite element model.

Cracking is assumed to occur when the stress reaches a failure surface called "crack detection surface" as illustrated in Fig. 4.4. The strength o f concrete in bi-axial compression is greater than the uni-axial compression and generally taken as 105-107%

........................................................................................................................... (4.1)

Even though researchers (Yang et al. 2003, Kachlakev and Miller 2001, Thevendran et al. 1999 and Sebestian et al. 2000) reported three different crack directions such as orthogonal cracks, rotating cracks and fixed multidirectional cracks, ABAQUS uses fixed orthogonal direction o f cracks. In addition, ABAQUS allows orthogonal crack to be used with shear retention by modifying shear retention property so that the shear stresses tend to be zero with increasing crack openings. Traditionally, the shear retention model does not converge to zero whereas ABAQUS allows shear stresses to become zero as the deflection along the crack interface increases (Abaqus User's Manual Volume I I 2004).

ABAQUS model defines the total shear stresses as a function o f shear strain whereas traditional shear retention model define the shear stress-strain relationship by incremental form. In this way, it is possible to achieve a shear retention model, which will decrease shear stresses to zero when large deflection occurs. Therefore, orthogonal cracks are allowed with the shear retention model. These cracks aie recoverable and they will remain in the calculation but it may open or close based on loading and unloading conditions.

Tensile Behavior o f Concrete

Concrete in tension is considered as a linear-elastic material until the uni-axial tensile strength, at which, the concrete cracks and later, exhibit a linear softening behavior. The tensile strength o f concrete is typically 8-10% o f the compressive strength (MacGregor and Barlett 2000).

A linear softening model has been used to represent the post failure behavior in tension. The softening behavior depends on the size o f the element in a cracked region. The post failure behavior across cracks is modeled with ^TENSION STIFFENING option available in ABAQUS, which allows the definition o f the strain-softening behavior for cracked concrete. This option allows for the effect o f the interaction between embedded reinforcement and concrete. The tension stiffening model in ABAQUS, is represented in Fig. 4.5.

A reasonable starting point for a relatively heavily reinforced concrete beam with fairly detailed m esh is to assume that the strain softening after failure reduces the stress linearly to zero at a total strain about 10 times the strain at failure. The strain at failure in conventional concrete is typically 10'^, wliich suggests that the tension stiffening that reduces the stress to zero at a total strain o f about 10'^ is reasonable (Abaqus User's M anual Volume I I 2004).

4.2.2.3.

Compressive Behavior o f Concrete

W hen the principal stress components are dom inantly in compression, the response o f the concrete is modeled by an elastic-plastic model using a simple form o f the yield surface written in terms o f equivalent pressure stress, p, and the Von-Mises equivalent stress, q. CONCRETE option in ABAQ U S (Abaqus U ser's M anual Volume II, 2004) is used to define the stress-strain behavior o f the concrete in an inelastic range. This option allows the user to define the compressive stress as a function o f compressive stress-inelastic strain data in a tabular form.

The stress strain curve can be defined beyond the ultim ate stress, into the strain-softening regime. In the selected model, the uni-axial stress strain curve is assumed to be linear up to 0.3 f \ (McGregor and Barlett 2000), beyond that point a model proposed by (Desayi and K rishnan 1964, Eq. 4.2) is used up to the stage when the concrete reaches its ultimate compressive stress, f \ . The strain , at which the maximum compressive stress occurs

is generally taken as 0.002-0.0025 (M cGregor and Barlett 2000), but in this study, the model proposed by (Desayi and Krishnan 1964, Eq. 4.3) is used.

M odeling of Shear Retention in Concrete

As concrete cracks, its shear stiffness diminishes. This effect is called shear retention and is defined by invoking * SHEAR RETENTION option exclusively available in ABAQ U S (Abaqus U ser's Manual Volume II 2004) as a function o f strain across the cracks. The decrease o f shear transfer capability o f concrete across the crack is taken into account by introducing a factor "p", a function o f tensile strain across the crack. The shear retention

and superimposed on the mesh o f standard element type used for modeling the concrete. W ith this approach, the concrete behavior is considered independent o f the steel rebars. The effect associated w ith the rebar/concrete interface is difficult to model with this approach. This effect however, can be modeled approximately b y introducing "Tension . Stiffening" into the concrete model to simulate the load transfer across the crack through rebars assuming perfect bond between steel and concrete.

The rebar is defined as smeared layer o f uniformly spaced reinforcing bars in shell and solid elements. Such layer thickness is equal to the area o f reinforcing bar divided b y the spacing between each rebar. Reinforcement, can be defined as single rebar in solid element or in a layer o f rebars having uniform spacing. The rebars in three-dimensional continuum elements are defined as layers lying in surfaces (Abaqus User Manual Volume II 2004),

The steel in the finite element model was generally assumed to be an elastic-perfectly plastic material and identical intension and compression w ith a Poisson's ratio generally taken as 0.3 (M acGregor and Barlett 2000). Typical representation o f the stress-strain response used by different researchers (Yang et al. 2003, Yang and Ye 2002, Kachlakev and M iller 2001, Tedesco et al. 1999) is shown in Fig. 4.8.

Since considerable nonlinearities may occur in terms o f both material and geometry, resulting in the formation o f negative stiffhess matrix by the load deflection response, a static equilibrium states during the unstable phase o f the responses can be achieved by using the "Modified Riks Method (mRA)". This method is used where the loading is proportional; that is, where the load magnitudes are governed by a single scale vector. This method can provide solution even for the complex, unstable response shown in Fig. 4.9.

The Riks method uses the load magnitude as an additional unknown; it solves simultaneously for load and displacement. Therefore, another quantity m ust be used to measure the progress o f the solution; ABAQUS uses arc length "L", along static equilibrium path in load displacement space. This approach provides solution regardless o f whether the response is stable or unstable (Abaqus User Manual Volume I 2004).

The loading during the Riks step is always proportional and the current load magnitude, Ptotai is defined by;

- ^ ) ........................................................................................... (4.7) Where Po is the initial incremental load, Pref is the reference load vector and "A ." is the "load proportionality factor and it is found as a part o f the solution.

The initial load proportionality factor is calculated by:

increment. In nonlinear analysis, the total load applied to a finite element model is divided into a series o f load increments called load steps. At the completion o f each incremental solution, the stiffiiess matrix o f the model is adjusted to reflect nonlinear changes in structural stiffness before proceeding to the next load increment.

The ABAQUS program uses Newton-Raphson equilibrium iterations for updating the model stiffness. Newton-Raphson equilibrium iterations provide convergence at the end o f each load increment within tolerance limits. Fig. 4.13, shows the use o f the NewtonRaphson approach in a single degree of freedom nonlinear analysis for two load steps.

Load Steps and Response of Finite Element Model

For the nonlinear analysis, automatic time stepping in the ABAQUS program predicts and controls load step sizes. Based on the previous solution history and the physics o f the

69

model, if the convergence behavior is smooth, automatic time stepping will increase the load increment up to a selected maximum load step size. If the convergence behavior is abrupt, automatic time stepping will bisect the load increment until it is equal to a selected minimum load step size. The maximum and minimum load step sizes are required for the automatic time stepping.

Prior to each solution, the Newton-Raphson approach assesses the out-of-balance load vector, which is tlie difference between the restoring forces (the loads corresponding to the element stresses) and the applied loads. Subsequently, the i mgram carries out a linear solution, using the out-of-balance loads, and checks for convergence. If convergence criteria's are not satisfied, the out-of-balance load vector is re-evaluated, the stiffhess matrix is updated, and a new solution is attained. This iterative procedure continues until the problem converges.

Finite Element Analysis vvdth Various Interface Models

Two interface models have been used in the finite element analysis to simulate the behavior o f experimental beams discussed in Chapter 3 and to develop a FE model for prediction purposes.

4.2 6.1.

Use of 2D Shell Element

Initially, connector elements are used to create a link between steel stim.ips and steel plate through welded options (Fig. 4.11) but problems have been faced to connect these connector elements with the steel stirrups as shear reinforcements are modeled using *REBAR option which creates rebars as hypothetical elements embedded in concrete

using ^EMBEDDED option in ABAQUS (Abaqus User Manual Volume II 2004). Therefore, it is impossible with this type o f modeling to get discrete element o f rebar and their associated nodes to achieve a physical interface connection required to simulate the actual behavior o f experimental beams. Rebar

Fig. 4.11 Connection o f hypothetical rebar with steel plate using connector element

The experimental beams described in Chapter 3 showed no horizontal interface/slip failure (Hossain 2001). These phenomena eventually reinforce the assumption that full interaction between concrete and steel plate can provide a reliable simulation of the behavior o f experimental beams. Therefore for simplicity, failure o f spot weld in model 1 is assumed to happen at a level where yield strength o f steel plate is reached. For this reason, reduced yield strength o f steel plate (i.e. reduce by 8%) due to residual stress at the time o f welding at spot weld location obtained from experimental coupon test is used. Moreover, the tearing failure o f steel plate rather than weld failure o f experimental beams suggests that this type mechanical connection can be idealized assuming full interaction between concrete and steel plate.

y

In many instances, connector elements perfonn the same functions similar to multi-point constraint available with *MPC option in ABAQUS (Abaqus Standard User's Manual Volume 111 2004) and are more efficient than connector elements (ABAQUS Standard, User's Manual Volume 11 2004). MFCs are preferred and used in this study instead o f connectors, after a careful performance study on experimental beams. The use o f multipoint constraint has been previously reported by Nethercot and Ahmed (1996) for the analysis o f composite connections and composite frames with full interaction.

Since all nodes lying on the tension face o f concrete and steel plate (Fig. 4.12), is constrained to be intact at all stages o f load increment, it is assumed that there will be a full interaction between concrete and steel plate. This ensures fidl transfer o f all stresses from the concrete to the steel plate causing steel plate to yield.

As an initial step, a finite element model requires descritization o f the structure. The structure is divided into a number of small elements, and after loading, stresses and strains at integration points of these small elements as well as force and displacement at nodes are obtained (Bathe 1996; Nethercot and Ahmed 1996).

In developing Model 1, both concrete and steel plate is modeled using 2-dimentional shell elements. Typical FE descritization o f an experimental beam (S 2 B 100) with 4-node shell elements connected using multi-point constraint is shown in Fig. 4.12.

Both longitudinal and transverse reinforcement are modeled using smeared layer embedded in shell element using *REBAR LAYER. Layer 1 and layer 2 have an area of 20-mm^ corresponding to 5-mm diameter stirrups uniformly spaced at 100-mm (in case of S2 B 100) while layer 3 and layer 4 have an area of 20-mm^ spaced at 100 mm in order to provide 2-5 mm diameter rebars. Tliese rebar layers have been provided with reference to raid surface o f shell elements as shown in Fig. 4.12.

An important step in finite element modeling is the selection o f the m esh density, which can be performed through mesh and element type optimization process. A convergence o f results is obtained when an adequate number o f elements are used in the model. This is practically achieved when an increase in the mesh density has a negligible effect on the results (Sebestian 2000).

An extensive parametric finite element analysis is carried out to optimize the mesh size to achieve an appropriate mesh density. In order to optimize the interface connections with different types o f MFCs, both concrete and steel plate are modeled using 4 and shell elements such as 84, S4R,

In order to check the performance o f various shell elements available in ABAQUS, an arbitrary mesh size with 50-mm for both concrete and steel plate has been chosen for this study and tie constraint has been selected to provide an interface connection.

The performance o f different types o f shell elements is checked against the ultimate load capacity (47 KN) and the central deflection (10.47 mm) o f the experimental beam,

against the various types o f shell elements. It can be seen from Fig. 4.13 that the performance o f S4 elements is good to predict the ultimate load but for ultimate central deflection, the model is very much stiffer than the result obtained from experiments (error of 93.50%). Fig. 4.14 compares the load versus central deflection curves obtained numerically with experimental one. It can be seen that almost all numerical beams exhibit lower ductility when compared with the experimental beam with 0.4-mm thick'plate.

Combined Use of 3D Solid and 2D Shell Elements

Based on the poor performance o f the model with two dimensional shell elements, it was decided to use hexagonal solid/brick element having six degrees o f freedom at each node for concrete and 2D shell elements for the steel plate. Tie constraint is used to represent the connections between the steel plate and the concrete for the development o f the finite element m odel. Tie constraint was used because o f its good perform ance in simulating the steel plate - concrete interface as confirmed from the param etric study o f model with 2D shell elements.

Both longitudinal and transverse reinforcement were modeled using a smeared layer embedded in the solid element used to model the concrete beam. A typical finite element descritization o f beams in this model is shown in Fig.4.16.

Fig. 4.16 Typical Finite Element descritization o f the beam with mixed solid and shell elements

A parametric study was conducted to investigate the performance o f the model with different elements and mesh sizes. The S 2B 100 beam having 0.4-mm thick plate (Jim 1999) was also selected for the numerical investigation.

There are various types o f linear and quadratic solid elements available by ABAQ U S for the numerical modeling, some o f them are listed as C3D8, C3D8R, C3D8I, C3D8H, C3D20R, C3D20H and C3D20RH. The First letter C; corresponds to a Continuum/Solid element followed by 2D or 3D, which corresponds to the 2D or 3D nature o f the solid element. The second number denotes the number o f nodes followed b y an alphabet R, I,

or H , which denotes that either a solid element has reduced integration points, is hybrid or incompatible in nature.

In the first stage, the prediction o f the numerical model is checked b y using various mesh sizes ranging from 25 to 225 mm. A 3-dimentional solid element having 8 nodes with reduced integration scheme (i.e. C3D8R) is arbitrary selected to model the concrete beam and 4-node linear shell element (i.e. S4) is used to model the steel plate.

Tie constraint, because o f its better performance has been used to create an interaction between the elements lying on the concrete tension face and the steel plate, which is kept constant tlrroughout the development of the mixed model. The effect o f varying the mesh size on the load-central deflection response o f the beam is shown in Fig. 4.17.

It w as decided to keep the 4-node shell element (S4) which was used to model the steel plate, to check the performance o f various solid elements with regards to the ultimate load-deflection response o f the numerical S2 B 100 beam.

On the other hand, it can be seen that the performance o f linear 8-node solid element with reduced integration (C3D8R) is comparatively much better tlian other elements.

After selecting the C3D8R element to model the concrete beam, further optimization is done to obtain an appropriate shell element to model the steel plate. For this purpose, shell elements o f various types are used while using C3D8R element constant, to model concrete and the tie constraint to simulate the interface between the concrete and the steel plate.

It can be seen that among the different types of shell elements, the linear 8-node shell element with reduce integration (S8R) yields excellent results that correspond to an error o f 1% and 5% (Fig. 4.22) for the ultimate load and central deflection respectively.

Based on the result obtained, a 3D 8-node solid element with reduce integration (C3D8R) is used to model the concrete part and an 8-node shell element with reduced integration (S8R) is used to model the steel plate in all beams with an optimized mesh size o f 200-mm. Tie constraint is also kept constant at the interface o f concrete and the steel plate. This optimized mixed model is then implemented to model all beams tested by Jim (1999). Load-deflection responses comparing experimental results with those obtained from FE analysis are shown in Fig. 4.23 to Fig. 4.26.From Fig. 4.23 to Fig. 4.26, it can be seen that the numerical analysis with mixed model approach yield close results to those obtained experimentally.

Tensile stress contours at the ultimate stage in the longitudinal direction for the S2 B 100 beam with 0.4-mm thick plate are shown in Fig. 4.27. All numerical beams failed due to yielding o f steel plate when modeled with mixed (solid-shell) element approach.

Fig. 4.33 Optimization o f element type to model the steel plate in the shear stud model

This optimized model (Shear-Stud) is then implemented to simulate all experimental beams having 0.4-mm thin steel plate (Jim 1999). Simulated load-deflection responses o f all 8 experimental beams using this model are shown in Fig. 4.34 to Fig. 4.37.

Comparative Study on Finite Element Models

The results o f simulations using different finite element models are presented in Table 4.1. The results o f all numerical models presented in Table 4.1 are also compared with the experimental results (Jim 1999) in Table 4.2. The comparative study shows that the numerical results obtained with shell elements in M odel-1 with shell elements predicts the ultimate load carrying capacity o f beams reasonably well with an average experimentto-predicted ultimate load ratio of 0.98 while under predict the ultimate deflection with an average factor o f 5. The same can be said for the shear-stud model. The model using the mixed element approach gives the best results in predicting both the ultimate load and the central deflection. The m ixed model predict reasonably well the ultimate load and the central deflection with an average experimental to predicted load and deflection ratio o f 1.08 and 1.16, respectively as shown in Table 4.2.

Development of Design Guidelines and Performance Validation

5.1.

Introduction

This chapter describes the development of design guidelines that can be used during the process o f strengthening reinforced concrete beams with mechanically bonded steel plates. Discussions on the effect o f some parameters, on the ultimate load carrying capacity o f numerically simulated beams are also presented. Design guidelines are presented in terms o f Design Charts developed from a large number o f computer models and their performance validation is made against the prediction o f 16 experimented beams (Jim 1999 and Nupiri 2000). To highlight the significance o f these Design Charts for quick and accurate prediction o f the strength o f mechanically bonded strengthened beam, a design example is presented at the end o f this chapter to assist potential users.

Development of Design Guidelines

Normally, there are three possible solutions to design and predict the ultimate strength o f novel form of structural members and those are as follows: · · · Experimental investigation; Code based mathematical models/governing equations; Finite element modeling leading to design charts and graphs.

Finite element modeling has the advantage over the other two methods. Experimental investigation can be time consuming and expensive. On the other hand, existing Code

based procedures may not be suitable for the prediction o f ultimate strength o f novel forms o f structural elements and may lead to unreliable design. The development o f a finite element model whose performance is validated through selective experimental results on novel form o f structural elements and its subsequent use in the simulation of large number o f such numerical structural elements can provide a cost-effective means of developing design guidelines.

The finite element using the mixed element approach, presented in Chapter 4, is used to simulate thousands o f beams with mechanically bonded steel plates by varying material and geometric properties in order to develop design guidelines for such beams. The performance o f developing design guidelines is validated through further experimental results o f such beams, experimental results from other researcher and various Codes based design procedures.

5.3.

Development of Design Charts by Finite Element Predictions

The finite element model is used for developing design guidelines by generating a database o f load-deflection response for over 9000 cases o f steel plated beams by varying material and geometrical properties. Such design charts could serve for quick and accu Y ultimate strength determination o f such beams. The establishment o f a reliable finite element model that is capable o f giving quick and accurate prediction o f strength o f structural elements has many implications. The database can be used for the development o f knowledge based system or neural network for the design o f proposed steel plated beams (Famiyesin and Hossain 1998a, 1998b; Famiyesin et al. 2001).

The computer model beams are analyzed as simply supported with one end pinned and the other on roller to allow relative movement. Cover to the internal steel reinforcement is assumed to be as 10% o f the overall depth "h" of the beams with consideration of interior and exterior exposures.

Load-deflection responses o f all 9000 computer model beams are simulated using ABAQUS. A typical INPUT file for finite element model (Mixed model) is also presented in Appendix A. Flexural strength o f all experimental beams are calculated using various codes and presented in Appendix B. Peak loads derived from the finite element simulation are used to calculate the moment or flexural capacity o f all beams. Detailed results showing strength o f all computer model beams in terms o f their moment resisting capacity are presented in Appendix C.

Design C h arts

From the results obtained through finite element simulation o f 9000 computer model beams, 200 design charts are developed to facilitate thé design o f such beams with various material and geometric properties. Design charts consists o f 2"^ degree polynomial curves (trend lines) fitted through the data points and can be used to predict the moment capacity o f an arbitrary beam when its material and geometric properties are known. A polynomial trend line is a curved line that is used when data fluctuates. value (coefficient o f correlation) is an indicator from 0 to 1 that reveals how closely the estimated value o f a trend line to our actual data obtained from finite element simulations. A trend line is more reliable when the value is near to 1. The coefficient

The design chart has been established for a particular concrete cylinder stren g th /c, yield strength of steel reinforcement fys, yield strength o f composite steel plate fyp, length to depth ratio L/h, reinforcement ratio "p" and thickness o f steel plate tp (shown on the chart). Design moments are expressed as a function o f cross-sectional area o f beams varying from 0 to 0.25 m^. The combination o f beam cross-section area and ratio o f total length to depth (L/h) helps the user to select b and h o f the designed beam.

The geometrical properties and area of internal reinforcement are known for the case of an existing reinforced concrete beam to strengthen. Based on parameters mentioned on top of each design charts, a user can select appropriate design chart for a typical beam to be strengthened. The ultimate moment capacity can be determined by selecting the required steel plate thickness corresponding to the cross-sectional area o f the beam using a trial and error analysis. The user must design the beam under study for shear prior to use the proposed design chart for the prediction o f moment capacity.

Performance Validation of Design Chart

The performance o f design charts in the prediction o f moments is validated through further test results (Hossain 2001 and Nupiri 2000), results obtained from direct finite element analysis o f experimental beams reported by Jim (1998) and various code based design procedures such as AGI (318-2002), CSA (1994), Australian Code (AS 36001988) and Euro Code-2 and are summarized in Table 5.3.

In addition to the eight beams having 0.4-mm thick steel plate tested by Jim (1999) and eight new experimental beams having 3-mm steel plate (Hossain 2001 and Nupiri 2000) are used to validate the performance o f developed design charts. The description o f all 16- beams is presented in Table 5.2. The use o f design charts in predicting the moment capacity o f beams strengthened with steel plates is illustrated in Figs. 5.10 to Fig. 5.25. Experimental moment capacities o f such beams are also shown on the chart for comparative purpose. Material Properties Beam Designation

From Table 5.3, the ratio o f chart prediction to direct finite element prediction is found in range between 0.94 and 1.03 with a m ean value o f 0.99 showing that the chart is as accurate as the finite element analysis. The ratio o f chart prediction to experiments ranges between 0.80 and 1.00 w ith a mean value o f 0.94 showing the accuracy o f developed design charts.

Moreover, the code based design equations over predict the ultim ate m om ent capacity o f beams. From Table 5.3, the design procedure based on the Canadian Code over predicts the ultimate m om ent capacity for beams especially beams strengthened w ith thick plates. The Canadian codes prediction to experiment prediction is found to be in a range between 0.74 and 3.20 w ith a mean value o f 1.40 showing that the predictions based on Canadian code over predict the ultimate moment capacity o f the beams. The ACI code prediction to experiment prediction ranges between 0.71 and 3.14 w ith a m ean value o f 1.37 showing an over prediction when ACI code is used. The Australian code (AUS 3600, 1988) yields more or less the same m ean value o f 1.40, w hen compared with the experiments as shown in Table 5.3. Ratio o f prediction based on European code (Euro-2) to experiment ranges between 0.71 to 3.16 w ith a m ean value o f 1.34.

Hence, it is clear that Code based design procedures are not suitable for the design o f the proposed steel plated beams and proposed design charts are proved to be accurate in predicting the m om ent capacity o f the proposed beams and can be used for design purposes.

Applicability of Design Charts for Beams with D ifferent Strengthening Systems

These design charts can also be used to predict the flexural capacity o f adhesively bonded steel plates provided that the failure o f beams happen specifically in flexure either due to the crushing o f concrete at the top or excessive yielding o f steel plate. A n attempt has been made to verify the performance o f the proposed design charts in predicting the flexural capacity o f adhesively bonded steel plated beams. For this purpose, experimental beams firom Byung et al. (2003), Oehler (1992), Aprile et al. (2001), Hussain et al. (1995) and Ritchie et al. (1991) are selected. The detailed description o f such experimental beams is presented in Table 5.4. All beams selected to compare the prediction based on design charts fails predominantly in flexure.

Two beams (S23 and S43S1) have been selected from the experiments done by Byung et al. (2003). Each beam had a cross-section area o f 150 mm x 250 m m (0.038 m^) with an effective length o f 2.1 m. Two 16-mm diameter and two 13-mm diameter steel bars were provided as tensile longitudinal reinforcement at the bottom and top location respectively. External reinforcement in the form o f 2-mm and 4-mm thick steel plates were attached using epoxy adhesive. 6-mm diameter steel bars uniformly spaced at 110 mm were provided for shear resistance. Details o f material properties associated with the strength o f concrete and steel are presented in Table 5.4.

From the experimental investigation done b y Oehlers (1992), two beams (Beam 2/2/S and 2/4/S) have selected for prediction o f mom ent capacity w ith the proposed design charts. The cross-section o f beams was 130 m m x 175 m m (0.023 m^) with length to

depth ratio o f 8.4. These beams were reinforced for shear w ith 4-mm diameter o f steel stirrups uniformly spaced at 75 m m and 45 m m respectively. 5-mm thick plate was attached on tension side o f reinforced concrete beam. Longitudinal reinforcement was present in terms o f a total steel area o f 402 mm^ at the bottom and 157 mm^ at top o f the beam. Material properties associated with concrete, rebars and steel plate are shown in Table 5.4.

One beam has been selected from the 14 reinforced concrete beams tested by Aprile et al. (2001). The beam had a cross-section dimension o f 200 m m x 300 m m (0.06m^) with an effective length o f 2.88 m. The beam was strengthened with 4-mm thick steel plate. The reinforcement ratio was fixed to be 0.56% o f the balanced steel ratio. 6-mm diameter stirrups with a uniform spacing o f 100 mm were provided as shear reinforcement. Details o f material properties are presented in Table 5.4.

From the w ork done by Hussain et al, (1995), two beams (FBR2 and FBR3) are selected to test the predictions based on design charts. Each beam had a cross-section area o f 150 m m

One beam was selected from the experiments done by Riche in 1991. The beam had a cross-sectional area o f 150 mm x 305 mm (0.464 m^) with an effective length to depth

All experimental beams summarized in Table 5.4, fails primarily in flexure and it is found that the moment capacity o f such beams can be safely predicted using proposed design chart presented in Appendix C.

However, the proposed design charts should be used with caution and is not recommended for the design o f all such beams. Engineers m ust rely on their experience and judgement before using the proposed design charts for the prediction o f such composite beams. However, these design charts can be used in preliminary design to have an idea of the moment capacity before final design.

5.8.

Use of Proposed Design C harts - Design Exam ple

Let us consider, a simply supported existing deteriorated beam having a cross sectional area o f 300 ram x 650 mm carrying a uniformly distributed load o f 65 kN/m over its entire length o f 6 m. Top bars consist o f 2 - M l 5 steel bars while bottom bars consist o f 5 - M20 bars (Fig. 5.34). A uniformly spaced lOM stirrups at 200 mm was provided to increase the shear resistance capacity o f the beam. There is a loss o f about 15% o f the internal longitudinal reinforcement areas due to corrosion. This beam requires strengthening in order to take a load, which is 35% more than the existing load and the proposed mechanically bonded steel plate technique is chosen to retrofit beam. The compressive strength o f concrete is found to be 38 MPa and yield strength o f steel is 435 MPa.

Solution:

Step 1: Calculation of M oment Capacity

The moment for which the beam was designed = Mmax = --
8

= 292 kN-m

The balanced steel ratio = Pb ~ 0.026 (CSA 1994) Actual steel ratio o f existing beam with respect to the cross-section area = p = 0.009 Since p < Pb - beam was designed as an under reinforced beam The resisting moment (before loss in internal steel) = 333 kN-m (CSA 1994)

The residual moment of resistance (after corrosion result in loss o f steel area)

=M re = 280 kN-m

Hence, this beam is critical even for existing load carrying capacity, which requires immediate strengthening either to resist the existing load or the load, specified in this example. The moment for which the beam is to be strengthened = 1.35 x 292 = 394 kN-m.

Step 2: Selection of Appropriate Design Chart In order to use design charts, the following parameter should be determined first. · Existing beam should be check for shear (in order to minimize the risk o f brittle shear failure after strengthening) prior to obtained ultimate moment capacity from proposed design chart. · · · · · Ratio o f existing length to total depth o f the beam (L/h), Cross-sectional area o f reinforced concrete beam (b x h), Compressive strength o f concrete (/'c), Yield strength o f steel (/y^), Yield strength o f steel plate to be provided for strengthening o f existing member
(/Yp),

· ·

Existing steel ratio (p), Ratio o f steel area o f stirrups to spacing o f stirrups.

For the given beam, these parameters are calculated as follows: Compressive strength o f concrete: / c= 3 8 Yield strength o f reinforcement: = 433 =350 (MPa) (MPa) (MPa)

Conclusions and R ecom m endations

6.1. An

Summary of Research Effort innovative technique of strengthening reinforced concrete members with

mechanically bonded steel plate using welded connection has been presented in this research.

Based on the experimental investigation performed by other researchers, a finite element study was performed using the finite element software, ABAQUS. A n attempt has been made to develop a finite element model that can simulate the behavior o f experimented beams. Once the finite element model is developed and its performance is validated, it has been used to generate design charts to predict the ultimate moment capacity o f strengthened beams.

The performance validation o f these design charts has been presented by comparing their prediction to the results o f a number o f experimental investigations. Performance validation shows that these design charts can be helpful to predict the ultimate moment capacity if strengthened beams. Prevailing codes do not shows good co-relation with the experimental results

Another worth noted-advantage o f these design charts is its utilization under different connection systems, such as adhesively bonded connection system provided that the mode o f failure is ductile. These design charts proved to be reasonable source o f strength

Suggestion for Further Research

Further research can be done in the following areas:
#

The behavior o f mechanically bonded beams should be analyzed b y welding steel plate inside the stirrups at the bottom. Further experiment can be done to predict the ultimate flexural capacity o f such novel form beams under cyclic and fatigue loading.

As experiments have been done on a small scale to testify the mechanical strengthening procedures, the technique o f welding steel plate to strengthen existing beams should be implemented in the field to analyze the behavior o f strengthened beam under practical conditions.

Feed back should be obtained from the construction industry to marketize this novel form strengthening technique.
