A b stra ct
In this thesis, a m ethod for segmenting textnred images using G abor filters is presented. O ne of the m ost recent approaches for texture segmentation and analysis is multi-channel filtering. There are several applicable choices as filter banks which are used for textured images. Gaussian filters m odulated by exponential or by sinusoidal filters, knowm as G abor filters, have been proven to be very useful for texture analysis for th e images containing specific frequency and orientation characteristics. Resembling the hum an visual cortical cells, G abor function is a popular sub-band filter for multi-channel decomposition. O ptim um joint spatial/ spatial-frequency uncertainty principle and its ability to recognize and pass specific frequencies and orientations are attributes of Gabor filter th a t make it more attractive. G abor function with these attrib u tes could simulate th e task of simple visual cells in the cortex. Gabor function has several param eters th a t determine the sub-band G abor filter and m ust be determ ined accurately to extract th e features precisely for texture discrimination. A wide selection range for each param eter exists and many combinations of these param eters are possible. A ccurate selection and

com bination of values for the param eters are of crucial im portance. Hence a diflncult goal is minimizing the number of filters. On the other hand a variety of approaches of texture analysis and recognition have been presented in remote sensing applications, including land cover/land use classification and urb an scene segmentation. W ith the availability of very high-resolution commercial satellite imagery such as IKONOS, it is possible to obtain detailed inform ation on u rb an land use and change detection th a t are of particular interest to urban and regional planners. In this thesis considering th e attributes of hum an visual system, a hybrid algorithm is implemented using m ulti-channel decomposition by Gabor filter bank for feature extrac tion in conjunction w ith Artificial Neural Networks for both feature reduction and texture segmentation. Three approaches are implemented to optimize G abor filter b an k for image segmentation. Eventually the proposed m ethod is successfully applied for segm entation of IKONOS satellite images. ii

C hapter 1 In trod u ction
Several rem o te sensing satellites are circling th e E arth , each acquiring a very specific type of im agery. In th is section a brief introduction to rem ote sensing and its applications will b e given. T h e m ost im p o rtan t rem ote sensing concept is w hat a satellite image actually

is and h ow it is acquired. A lm ost all commercial rem ote sensing satellites acquire images w ith d ig ita l sensors which o perate like th e new digital cameras th a t have recently become popular a n d on th e same principles. A satellite sensor like a digital cam era has no film b u t it has th o u san d s of tiny detectors th a t m easure th e am ount of energy (i.e. electrom agnetic rad iatio n ) reflecting from th e E a rth 's surface known as spectral m easurem ents and objects on it. T h e se spectral reflectance values are recorded as digital num bers. To create an

image t h a t looks like a photograph, these num bers should tran sm it back to th e E a rth and convert in to colors or grey scale brightness levels by com puters. Sensors m easure reflectance of energy in th e visible, near-infrared, short-wave infrared, therm al infrared, and microwave portions o f th e electrom agnetic spectrum depending on th e sensitivity of th e detectors. M ost of rem o te sensing satellites m easure energj'' in well-defined and very specific wavelengths of th e sp ectru m . C reated images from reflectance m easurem ents provide extrem ely accurate re p re se n ta tio n of w h at objects and surface features on th e ground look like to th e naked eye according to shape, s'ze, color and overall visual appearance. This representation is known as th e s p a tia l content of th e image. D igital images not only show those spatial details,

b u t m o re th a n th a t those reflectance m easurem ents can help reveal thousands of invisible

details known as th e spectral content of a satellite image such as th e physical composition of buildings, the mineral content of rocks, the health of vegetation and the moisture of soil. Since digital sensors measure th e energy reflectance this spectral inform ation is visible to them. All object's characteristics such as chemical make-up, density, w ater content and other unseen conditions and characteristics of a particular surface feature influence how energy in various spectra or wavelengths interact w ith th a t feature and reflect off it. Insight to those invisible conditions and characteristics is provided by spectral interaction which, in turn, is measured by the digital sensor. Interpretation of digital images is the most im portant task to extract useful spatial and spectral inform ation th a t are reflected in them [1].

Im age Interpretation
Spectral values are only p art of the information contained in satellite images and each pixel has both spectral and spatial inform ation th a t means we can identify objects and ground features visually by their physical appearance. For instance, a round football field will look round or a square building will appear square. The color intensity of the image reveals spectral inform ation too. For example if the color red has been chosen to represent nearinfrared reflectance in the image, green objects such as vegetation which reflect energy in th a t wavelength completely will be appeared very bright red. Image interpretation can

range from simple visual inspection of th e image to the use of sophisticated image processing systems which analyze and classify based on the digital value of th e spectral signatures th a t are reflected from ground features. The analysis and classification of ground features can be done by image processing and mapping softwares much more accurately th an w hat the hum an eye can. T he following products could be derived by the analysis of these digital images; · Classification Maps which are called them atic, morphology or clutter maps as well: In these maps land areas have been clustered and classified into groups of similar land cover or land use. It may be a broad classification such as urban, forested, open fields and water or it may be more specific such as differentiating wheat, soybean, beet and

corn fields [2]. · D igital Elevation Model (DEM) are also referred to as digital terrain model [3]: DEM are used extensively in three dimensional modelling and visualization software packages commonly utilized in geologic mapping, flight sim ulation and civil engineering. In these d a ta sets photogram m etric processes are applied to overlapping stereo image pairs to derive terrain elevation measurements. · Mosaics: W hen one satellite image scene does not cover the entire project area, two or m ore adjacent scenes can be ordered and stitched together using complex com puter algorithm s th a t balance colors and match th e edges of the scenes exactly to create a large seamless area dataset. · M erging satellite images: To create a hybrid product, two different types of satellite images can be merged by com puter to gain the benefits of b o th images. T he most common is to merge a high-resolution panchrom atic w ith a lower resolution such as merging a SPO T 10-meter image w ith a SPO T 20-meter or Landsat 30-meter multispectral image. The resulting merged image has b o th the spectral content of the

m ulti-spectral d a ta and the spatial detail of th e panchrom atic image. · Change detection of th e same scene: Applying specialized algorithm s on two satellite images of th e same area which are acquired a t different times creates a change detection image. H ere an overview of satellite imagery, its applications and high resolution satellite imagery, texture, tex tu re analysis and th e im portance of texture analysis to interpret satellite images are presented as following.

ing on our individual experience and perception. A t the tim e of d ata acquisition a detailed record of features on th e ground is provided. These recorded features in conjunction w ith other supporting m aterials such as field observation reports and maps are used to interpret the images. Satellite images m ay be interpreted and processed w ith different levels of com plexity from object recognition on the ea rth 's surface to th e interactions among earth surface and subsurfaces. There are numerous applications which would benefit from a reliable and true processing and interpretation of satellite imagery. Some of the m ost popular ones are discussed in the next section.

Land U se/L a n d Cover M apping
For many m anagem ent and planning activities, the knowledge of land use and land cover is im portant and is considered an essential element for modeling and understanding the earth as a system. Presently land cover maps are being developed from local to national to global scales. Land cover explains and relates to th e type of feature th a t is present on the surface of the earth such as corn fields, maple trees, concrete highways and lakes. Economic function or human activities associated w ith a specific piece of land is defined by land use. For example a tract of land on an urban area th a t is used for single family housing could be described as single family residential use, residential use or urban use regarding the term of land use and level of mapping detail. Land cover consisting of trees, grass, pavement and roof would be considered for th e same tra c t of land [Ij.

G eologic and Soil M apping
By geologic and soil m apping through visual image interpretation, the earth materials and structures can be identified and evaluated. Although geologic and soil mapping requires a considerable am ount of field exploration, through the use of visual image interpretation the mapping process could be greatly facilitated.

F orestry A pplications
Forestry applications focus on forest m anagement for wildlife, water, wood and recreation. T h e m a in concern of forestry is maintenance, management and improvement of existing forest fields and. fire control. Image interpretation is a feasible means to m onitor forests conditions such as t r e e species identification, harvested areas studies and disease and insect detection. Tree sp ecies identification is generally a more difficult task in comparison w ith agricultural crop identification. A forest land area is usually occupied by a m ixture of different tree species in contrast w ith relatively uniform agricultural fields. Tree species can be identified th ro u g h th e elimination process. In the first step the species whose presence in an area is im possible or im probable because of location or climate are eliminated. I r th e second step based o n knowledge of the common species associations and their requirements, groups of species m a y occur in th e area are established and finally using basic image interpretation principles individual tree species are identified.

H ig h R e so lu tio n S a te llite Im agery

To ach iev e higher resolution satellite imagery th a n available m oderate and low resolution satellite imagery, numerous high resolution land satellites are in development phase or have been lu n c h e d already. Some of th e most widely available sources of high resolution satellite im ages a r e IKONOS, SPIN-2 and QuickBird.

IK O N O S Satellite Im ages
IK O N O S is developed by Space Imaging and was successfully lunched in September 1999 after t h e first lunch has been failed in April 1999. IKONOS has occupied a 682 km sunsy n ch ro n o u s orbit having an equatorial crossing tim e of 10:30 A.M. Although the ground trac k o f th e system repeats every 11 days, based on tilt and latitu d e of th e system th a t are se le c te d to acquire any given image the revisit tim e for imaging is less than 11 days. T h e s y s te m is capable of collecting d a ta a t angles of 45° from vertical in th e both across and a lo n g track directions. This provides the opportunity for frequently covering a given

area. A typical image size is 11 by 11 km b u t user specified image strips can be collected. Linear array technology is employed in IKONOS and d a ta in four m ulti spectral bands including blue (0.45 to 0.52 yum), green (0.51 to 0.60 ^m ), red (0.63 to 0.70 iim ) and near IR (0.76 to 0.85 p.m) a t 4m nominal ground resolution are collected. An effective 1 m spatial resolution can be provided by pan-sharpened m ulti-spectral imagery. Pan-sharpened imagery is concluded by combining one-meter panchrom atic imagery and the multi-spectral bands. A d ata set w ith 1 m spatial resolution pan-sharpened IKONOS satellite images of an urban residential area is employed for applying to th e proposed algorithm. The 1 m resolution IKONOS satellite imagery used in this study covers a complex urban residential area mixing roads, paths, houses, and trees. It is located in the northwest of the G reater Toronto Area (GTA), Ontario, C anada, near the Pearson International A irport and was acquired in August 2001. T he IKONOS imagery was geometrically corrected in two dimensions (X and Y) in the Universal Transverse M ercator (UTM) projection coordinate system, zone 17 in the Geodetic Reference System of 1980 (GRS80) and N orth American Horizontal D atum of 1983 (NAD83) [1]. T he roads in th e image are continuous regions which form a network. Houses are very dense in the image, some roofs of which have similar spectral characteristics as roads. Trees along the road are located close to houses.

Texture segm entation is happening in human vision system to segment and interpret images in real time. O n th e other hand in digital routes for image processing, researchers try to mimic and im itate hum an vision system. Since texture recog nition is a fundam ental p art in human image segmentation, using textures and developing some algorithm s to recognize and segment textures have been noticed recently by a lot of researchers [5, 6, 7].

Simplifying assum ptions about the uniform ity of intensities in local image regions are con sidered in m any image processing and m achine vision techniques. However, n atural images and real objects usually do n o t exhibit regions of uniform intensities. For example, the im age of a. n atu ral surface has variations of intensities and is not uniform. These variations of intensities form certain repeated patterns loiown as visual texture. T he p attern s may be the result of reflectance differences such as th e surface and color or can be the result of physical surface properties which often have a tactile quality such as softness, roughness and oriented

strands. A lthough w hen we see tex tu re we recognize it, defining it is very difficult. The large num ber of different tex tu re definitions, which are presented by image and vision re searchers dem onstrate this difficulty. T he following definition for tex tu re is given by Oxford D ictionary [8]: T h e way a surface, substance or fabric feels when you touch it, for example, how rough, smooth, h a rd or soft it is.

More com plete definition for tex tu re is given by W ebster D ictionary [9]: · Function; noun · Etymology: L atin textura, from textus, past participle of texere · Description -- som ething composed of closely interwoven elements; specifically : woven cloth -- th e stru ctu re formed by th e threads of a fabric -- essential p a rt : SUBSTANCE -- identifying quality : CH ARA CTER -- th e disposition or m anner of union of th e particles of a body or substance -- th e visual or tactile surface characteristics and appearance of something; the texture of an oil painting A catalogue of tex tu re definitions in th e com puter vision literatu re is collected by Cog gins [10].

In this section an overview of some applications of tex tu re analysis and recognition systems th a t are more im p o rtan t is presented.

S a te llite R e m o te S e n sin g : M easurem ent of specific properties of objects from far distance is called rem ote sensing. T h e num ber of E arth observation satellites th a t are in operation is rising every year. These satellites carry a diverse spectrum of rad ar and optical sensors capa ble of acquiring im agery th a t utilizes for a broad range of applications. There are a variety of different rem ote sensing techniques including very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, synthetic apertu re rad ar (SAR), satellite m ulti-spectral imagery, seismic surveys, sonar sur veys, etc. A variety of num erous approaches for tex tu re analysis and recognition have been presented in rem ote sensing. A pplications include land cover/land use classification [14], ur ban area and facility segm entation, road network m ap updating, cloud classification [15], sea floor m apping, seismic p a tte rn recognition, sea ice segm entation, m apping, urban planning, civil engineering, defence, agriculture, environm ental science, land m anagem ent and a lot of other applications [1, 14, 16, 17].

M e d ic a l im a g in g : M edical images are usually obtained by non-intrusive m ethods such as x-ray, photography, M agnetic Resonance Im agery (M Rl), ultrasound, tomography, CT scan, etc. O n th e other hand, some medical images such as microscopic photography of biopsies are obtained by intrusive m ethods. T extural properties in m ost of these types of images are im p o rtan t to diagnose th e disease. A wide variety of different diseases like cancer are often recognized and characterized by characteristics of textures obtained by different m edical im aging m ethods. M ost effective way to reduce m ortality of some diseases is early detection of th e disease. For exam ple th e B reast cancer am ong women is one of th e leading

cause of cancer d eaths [18]. For early detection of th is cancer, m am m ography screening is currently th e best m ethod. In m am m ography images lesion detection is successfully accom plished b y applying texture recognition techniques [19]. T he other applications of medical im age segm entation are lung and liver cancer diagnosis. Electron m icroscope images of thin cell slices of th e liver and lung are tak en to diagnose th e lesion by te x tu re analysis and the te x tu re characteristics of the lesion would be extracted. Also for th is kind of images, texture techniques have been applied successfully for cancer detection [20].

V is u a l c o n t e n t b a s e d r e tr ie v a l: Since m anual labelling of th e images is a tedious task and in som e cases is n o t feasible a t all, content-based retrieval m ethods to search th e visual d a ta are h o t area in th e com puter vision. R etrieving an image w ith some specific contents is a difficult task on th e internet and num erous num ber of technics have been developed to search a n d m anage images in visual d a ta banks. D ue to th e n atu re of im ages in a specific d a ta b an k , th e content types usually have some te x tu re characteristics th a t are very useful to search a n d ex tract th e image. Hence, tex tu re analysis and recognition m ethods are in high d em and for visual retrieval systems. Using te x tu re analysis, autom atically feature extraction and d atab ases search is possible.

I n d u s t r i a l d e fe c t in s p e c tio n : Defect detection of raw m aterials and m anufactured prod ucts is very im p o rtan t in industrial processes. A utom atic visual inspection system s are

preferred since m anual inspection n o t only is a tedious ta sk b u t also is n o t enough accurate. T ex tu re recognition technics are useful to analyze th e surface characteristic for defect detec tio n a n d surface qualification. A pplications of au tom atic inspection are growing and a lot of approach es using different tex tu re analysis technics are proposed [21, 22, 23].

Chapter 2 Texture Segm entation and Filter Bank M odel
2.1 S e g m en ta tio n

T he shape of an object can be described in term s of: (1) its boundary, and (2) the region th a t is occupied by th e object. T he first one can be achieved by edge detection of the image and the second one requires segmenting the image into homogeneous regions using homo geneous characteristics of image regions such as intensity and texture. Segmentation is the process of distinguishing objects in the d a ta set from their surroundings so as to facilitate the creation of geometric models. To segment an image, intensity provides less robust classi fication inform ation th a n texture. Intensity does n o t identify different homogeneous regions consistently and it provides poor directional information. Finding regions th a t represent objects or meaningful p arts of objects is the goal of image segmentation. As it is m entioned in chapter one, there are numerous applications for satellite image segmentation. To accom plish these applications, some im portant features are obtained by image segmentation. As a result satellite image segm entation can facilitate th e d a ta extraction from satellite imagery by: · Measuring features such as: shape, surface area and volume · Partitioning regions such as: land cover, urban area and vegetation · M apping the satellite imagery and existing m aps and databases. 16

T extu re segm entation
T exture segm entation and analysis are im portant aspects of p attern recognition and digital im age processing. In image analysis, textures have been used to perform scene segmentation, object, shape and region recognition and surface classification. In texture analysis attributes which, are useful to discriminate, recognize and segment different texture types should be identified. Texture segm entation involves accurately partitioning an image into sections

according to the textured regions or by recognizing the borders between different textures in th e scene or image.

To discover the mysteries of hum an visual system and improve our knowledge about bio logical vision, animal models are used by scientists. By improving our understanding about th e h u m a n visual system, more accurate artificial vision systems can be .implemented and u sed as comparison basis to measure the performance of machine vision models. Julesz [4] ex p lain ed pre-attentive aspects of hum an visual perception and developed the concept of te x to n s . Although th e concept of texton was first proposed by Julesz twenty years ago, a clear definition is still in debate. Textons are suspected to have positional relationship with h u m a n visual system and to direct it to identify the patterns in the scene. To avoid the com plexities of hum an visual system, an abbreviate explanation of the interconnections is p re se n te d . Electrical impulses are passed from receptor cells th a t are located on th e back in n e r surface of the eyes to the visual cortex placed in the brain. To reach the visual cortex th e y are passed through various nervous pathways and the optic nerve. Scientists discovered t h a t various cells in th e visual cortex perform different processing taslrs on th e incoming sig n a ls. Responses of the visual cortex in cats were tested by Hubei and Wiesel [24] and they d e d u c e d th a t simple cells are tuned to specific orientations. It means individual simple cells re s p o n d to a certain range of frequencies. Campbell [25] explained th a t hum an vision system is s e n sitiv e to bo th orientation and spatial frequency and presented a model made up of a

num ber of independent detectors. Detectors are preceded by relatively narrow band filters th a t are tuned to different frequencies and each filter-detector pairs would be considered as a separate channel. In the other experiments Pollen and Ronner [26] have shown th a t the frequency bandw idth of simple cells in th e visual cortex is about one octave. Recent study on th e hum an vision system indicates th a t the spatial-frequency represen ta tio n is adequate to characterize texture properties. On the other hand, experiments on visual system of some mammals like cats show th a t their visual system is similar to th a t of humans [27]. In these inaimnals th e image is decomposed to several filtered images by the vi sual system. The decomposition filters have different radial frequencies and orientations and generate tuned filtered images to the specified frequencies and orientations [28]. Researchers have been motivated by this experiments and observations to develop multi-resolution tex tu re models for texture segm entation and analysis.

One of th e most recent approaches for texture segmentation and analysis is M ulti-channel filtering. In this m ethod an image is processed using a bank of filters w ith multiple resolution. Having th e ability to decompose the image, the filter bank extracts th e relevant texture features from the image. Several researchers in this field [5, 7, 11, 6] have proposed texture segmentation and analysis m ethods based on a filter bank model which is motivated by the hum an vision system 's (HVS) unique capabilities for texture segmentation [26, 29]. In this model, a set of filters in th e frequency domain (or a set of masks in spatial domain) are applied in parallel to an input image to decompose it into a set of filtered images accordingly. The set of filtered images are used directly as feature images or they are processed an d /o r combined to extract th e features. Eventually extracted features are used for the segmentation of the input image. Each individual filter in the bank is designed to focus on a specific local spatial region and a specific range of frequency to make spatial/spatial-frequency decomposition possible. T h e joint spatial/spatial-frequency decomposition, unlike Fourier analysis considers the local

frequency variations th a t vary w ith position in th e image. Textured images th a t are encoded in narrow spatial frequencies and orientation channels can be recognized and segmented by filtered images th a t carry out the tex tu re features. These features describe local spatialfrequencies and orientations to wlrich th e channels are tuned. Therefore texture can be regarded as a region information carrier and the local structure of a texture can be explained b y the frequencies and orientations of th e carrier th a t is contained in th e channel outputs. T here are several applicable choices as filter banks which are used for textured images. From a practical point of view, some filters m ay be more useful for specific segmentation tasks b u t not for th e others. Gaussian filters m odulated by exponential or by sinusoidal filters, known as G abor filters, have been proven to be very useful for tex tu re analysis for th e images containing specific frequency and orientation characteristics [30, 7, 31, 32]. While different filter banks can perform joint spatial/spatial-frequency decomposition, Gabor filter b an k using a G abor base function is one of th e most attractive ones. This set of filters has an optim al localization in the jo in t spatial/spatial-frequency dom ain according to the uncertainty principle. These selective b an d pass filters w ith different radial spatial frequency an d orientation have optimum resolution in the tim e and frequency domains th a t resemble th e simple visual cortical cell characteristics [26, 29].

Considerable research has been performed using G abor filters for texture segm entation and analysis. T he research invohdng th e use of G abor filters for texture segm entation can be divided into three m ajor disciplines: 1. Investigating th e best frequencies and orientations (bandwidth) according to the char acteristics of a specific textured image. 2. Inventing robust feature extraction and feature reduction m ethods. 3. Em ploying th e best classification and segm entation methods to devote to th e optimal extracted features.

Bovik and C lark [5] in their research have proposed a com putational approach for analyzing visible textures. In their m ethod they detect boundaries between textures by comparing the channel am plitude responses and detecting discontinuities in the texture phase by locating large variations in the channel phase responses. D unn and Higgins have investigated design ing the optim al G abor filters [7] and argued th a t G abor filter outputs can be presented as a Rician model and developed an algorithm to select optim al filter param eters to discrim inate texture pairs. Jain and Farrokhnia proposed a filter selection m ethod [6] based on reconstruction of the input image from th e filtered images. They also proposed th e optimum radial frequencies and orientations for different channels th a t have been used widely by many researchers. Unser and Eden described an unsupervised texture segmentation m ethod [32] using Karhunen-Loeve transform on the resulting features of Gabor filters to reduce the fea tu re vector dimension. Weldon et. al. presented a m ethod [31] to design a single Gabor filter for m ulti-textured image segmentation. Clausi and Jernigan investigated and compared dif ferent techniques [33] used to extract texture features and Jain and K aru proposed a neural network tex tu re classification m ethod [34] as a generalization of the multi-channel filtering method.

An overview of the elements of the general multi-channel filtering model will be explained before proceeding w ith th e description of G abor filter approach. Consider two simple textures generated by sinusoids and composed as a synthetic image. One is low frequency and the other is a sum m ation of the same low frequency and a high frequency sinusoids as depicted in Fig. 2.1. The first step in th e decomposition model depicted in Fig. 2.2 is filtering the input tex tu red image. If the filter passes the high frequency sinusoid and stops the low frequency one, the filter output for this textured image would be like Fig. 2.3. Filter output has a low energy response for the low frequency texture and Ifigh response for the other. Classification of the image by th e filter response is still erroneous and will result in a high classification error. To reduce th e error, applying nonlinearity and smoothing functions to

To estim ate the local energy in the filter response, local energy function would be applied. Since each filter in the filter bank has its specified frequency and orientation, local energy function passes regions w ith strong local sub-band energy in each channel. Supporting high spatial resolution and high spatial-frequency resolution a t th e same tim e is n o t possible since these are conflicting goals. To localize the edges accurately, liigh spatial resolution should be provided and accurate estim ation of th e local energy, needs high spatial-frequency resolution. T he objective of sm oothing function is to sm ooth out the variations in th e filter response after applying th e nonlinearity. One of the well known and widely used sm oothing filters is low pass G aussian filter. This low pass filter has optim um joint resolution in spatial and spatial-frequency domain. T h e spatial-frequency of th e channel is used to determ ine th e size of th e sm oothing filter. For low spatial-frequency channels, the low pass filter m ust be wide to accurate estim ate of the local energy of the channel. On the other hand local energy

D C T for im age segm entation
D iscrete cosine transform (DCT) helps separate the image into p arts known as spectral sub-bands of differing im portance with respect to the im age's visual quality. Since DCT transform s a signal or image from the spatial domain to th e frequency domain, it is similar to the discrete Fourier transform . The D C T input is an by iV m atrix of integers. This

m atrix contains each pixel's gray scale level (from 0 to 255 for 8 b it per pixel representation). For m ost images, much of th e signal energy lies a t low frequencies; these will appear in the upper left corner of the D CT and the lower right values represent higher frequencies, and are often smaller values.

The proposed method, CM LP-GFHF, is a hybrid algorithm using Competitive layer and M ulti-Layer Perceptron (CMLP) in conjunction with Gabor Filter bank and High Frequency com ponent (GFHF). The segm entation algorithm is described in the following chapters. M ulti-channel decomposition is explained in this chapter and Artificial Neural Networks will be discussed in the next chapter.

M u lti-C h a n n el D e c o m p o sitio n

klulti-channel decomposition is achieved by applying the filter bank to generate filtered images and local energy estim ation for feature extraction as shown in Fig. 3.1. In the first step a textured input image is decomposed into filtered images. In the second stage, to estim ate th e local energy, a function consisting of nonlinearity and smoothing is applied to the o u tp u t of Gabor filter bank for feature extraction. In this step each channel corresponding to a different filter is tuned to a different radial frequency or orientation to capture local characteristics of different textures such as spatial-freciuency in the input image [38]. After th e second stage, a set of feature images or a feature vector corresponding to each pixel in th e input image is generated. The dimension of feature vectors is equal to (or multiplied by 34

T he filter banks consisting of 20 and 30 filters using 45° and 30° orientations, respectively were used widely in previous research [6, 33, 11, 34]. Here th e th ird filter bank using 22.5° angular bandw idths and orientations is introduced. In several experiments w ith a variety of different textures using all three filter banks, the preserved energies in the filtered images are computed. By com paring and sorting the filtered images according to th e preserved energies, it was observed th a t by dividing the angular bandw idth by two, i.e., 22.5° in pla.ce of 45° and covering th e frequency dom ain by this angular bandw idth, not only the textures w ith 45° orientations i.e., 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°, could be caught b u t also textures w ith 22.5° orientations i.e., 22.5°, 67.5°, 112.5° and 157.5°, could be b etter discrim inated and classified. G abor filters in spatial domain w ith 22.5° orientations are depicted in Fig. 3.2 and Fig. 3.3.

It was noticed th a t for some textures, maximum energy is preserved by filters w ith 45° orientations (and 22.5° angular bandw idths) and filters w ith 22.5° orientations (and 22.5° angular bandw idths) would preserve th e maxim um energy for the other textures. By applying

In the proposed m ethod, th e spatial im plem entation for th e G abor filter bank is optim ized considering the diagonal high frequency and very low frequency components.

where hx and hy are horizontal and vertical Gabor kernels, respectively. By separating the 2D convolution into two ID convolutions, the com putation is reduced from O(A^M ^) to 0 ( 2 N ^ M ) for an M x M G abor kernel and an N x N image.

In this step each channel corresponding to a different filter is tuned to a different radial frequency or orientation to capture local characteristics of different textures in th e input im age such as spatial-frequency, edge intensity and direction [38]. After applying th e filter bank, local energy is estim ated to com pute the features. To estim ate the local energy,

square function is used as nonlinearity and low pass gaussian filter is used for smoothing. To determ ine the size of sm oothing function, as it can be observed in Fig. 3.9 by increasing the rad ial frequency th e G abor function will be narrower, and a smaller smoothing function can be used.

The dimension of feature vectors is equal to (or multiplied by a.n integer) the number of filters in the filter bank. Two m ethods to construct the feature vectors are used. In the first method, the feature vector for each pixel of the input image is composed of respected pixels from all feature images as depicted in Fig. 3.10. Ha.ving 42 filters in th e filter bank results in 42 featured images th a t are used to form feature vectors. Bach featm'e image corresponds to one element in the feature vectors and each feature vector corresponds to one image pixel. As a result the features are obtained for each pixel are 42 or the feature vectors are 42 dimensional.

A lthough th e field of neural networks has a history of some five decades, this field has found solid application only in th e past fifteen years, and it is still developing rapidly. Hence, this field is distinctly different from the fields of optim ization or control system s where th e basic m athem atics, and design procedures have been firmly established and applied for a long time. ANNs are a sim ulation of a real hum an nervous system th a t contains a collection of neurons which com m unicate w ith each other via connections known as axons. Such a model resembles axons an d dendrites in the hum an nervous system. In neural networks, simple elements operate in parallel. The connections between elements determ ine th e network function, as in nature. To perform a particular function, a neural network can be train ed by adjusting the weights o f the connections between elements. It is estim ated th a t the hum an brain contains over 100 billion (10^^) neurons and lO^'* synapses in th e hum an nervous system. Studies of 49

A lthough th e neuron's switch tim e is about a million times slower th a n current com puter elements (a few milliseconds), their connectivity is a thousand tim es greater th a n to d ay 's supercom puters. To lead particular inputs to a specific target output, neural networks are trained and weights are adjusted. T he first basic model for neural networks was proposed by McCulloch and P itts in 1943 in term s of a com putational model of " nervous activity" . T he proposed neuron was a binary device and each neuron has fixed threshold logic. This model leads the works of the other researchers such as Jhon von Neumann, Marvin Minsky, Frank R osenblatt, and many others [40, 41, 42, 43].

T he neural networks are commonly classified into three categories in term s of their corre sponding training algorithm s and how th e synaptic weights are obtained: 1. Fixed-weights networks 2. Unsupervised networks 3. Supervised networks The synaptic weights can be considered as the memory of a neural network th a t may be either pre-stored or adaptively train ed by a learning mechanism. There is no learning required for the fixed-weight networks, so a learning mode is supervised or unsupervised. Associative memory networlts are an instance of fixed-weight networks. They are m ostly designed for the best recovering of th e original p attern from an incomplete or distorted signal. T he main characteristic of th e fixed-weight association networks is th a t the synaptic weights are pre com puted and pre-stored. Since th ey cannot ad ap t according to the change of the input environm ent, th e fixed-weight models have limited applications.

By reducing th e dimension of d a ta set, the d a ta is represented by a reduced num ber of features th a t retain m ost of im portant inform ation of th e data. Assume th a t r-dim ensional vector p is transform ed to Z-dimensional vector a, w here I < r. T he easiest way to reduce th e dimension is truncating th e vector p to reach (-dimensionality. Such dimension reduction causes a mean-square

If an invertible linear transform ation T can be found such th a t th e tru n cated vector Tp has th e optim um mean square error, m ost of th e intrinsic inform ation content of d a ta p would have be retained in feature a.

C o m p e t it iv e N e tw o r k s

C om petitive Learning Networks are unsupervised networks whose synaptic weights ad ap t according to unsupervised learning rules. These models can learn in th e absence of teacher's guidance and exclusively based on th e in p u t training p attern s [43, 40]. A basic com petitive learning netw ork has one feedforward excitatory layer of input neurons. An in p u t p a tte rn p is a sam ple point in th e r-dim ensional real or binary vector space. U nsupervised classifica tion procedures are often based on some kind of clustering strategy, which forms groups of sim ilar p attern s. T he clustering technique is very useful for p a tte rn classification problems. F urtherm ore, it plays a basic role in many com petitive learning networks. For a clustering procedure, it is necessary to define a sim ilarity m easure to be used for evaluating how close the p a tte rn s are. Some popular m easures are: (1) Inner P roduct, (2) Euclidean distance and (3) W eighted Euclidean D istance. Among th em th e m ost common is th e Euclidean distance. W hen several neurons are grouped into a single layer and a com petitive netw ork is formed,

58 each neuron th a t is a single processing element, shares its processing functions w ith other neurons and responds to a group of input vectors in a different cluster maximally. This layer of neurons can classify any input vector, since the neuron w ith the strongest response for a given inp u t identifies the cluster to which the in p u t vector most likely belongs to. In this layer no external judge is to decide which neuron m ust win, hence the neurons m ust decide who is th e winner themselves and decision making process needs communication among all neurons in th e layer [40]. To reduce th e feature vector dimension a com petitive network is used. In a competitive layer the neurons are distributed in order to recognize frequently presented in p u t vectors in an unsupervised manner. The competitive transfer function accepts a net in p u t for each neuron in th e layer and returns neuron outputs of 0 for all neurons except for th e winner, which ou tputs 1. In a com petitive layer each neuron competes to respond to an input vector p, the neuron whose weight vector is closest to p gets the highest net input and, therefore, wins the com petition and outp u ts 1 and all other neurons output 0.Considering the single layer feedforward network depicted in Fig. 4.5 and making the following assumptions: 1. Neurons in the layer are linear , 2. Network has r inputs and I neurons th a t generate I outputs , 3. 1 < r, it means outputs of network are fewer th a n inputs , the outpu t ai{t) is calculated as:

j = 1 ,2 ,...,/ .

T he set of synaptic weights Wji are subject to training and adjusted during th e training phase. In this phase to adjust th e winner so as to move it closer to the input th e weights of neurons are adjusted by: = Tjaj\pi{t)-'^Wki{t)ak{t)], fe=i %= 1,2, ...,r & j = l,2 , ...,Z, (4.20)

where p, w and

(4.22) p'{t) = p(t) - Y,Wk(t)ak(t) , k=l are an input vector, a weight vector and a learning rate respectively. Since

this learning rule allows the weights to learn an in p u t vector, it is useful in recognition appli cations. Thus, th e neuron whose weight vector is closest to th e input vector will be updated to be even closer. As a result the winning neuron is more likely to win th e com petition when a similar vector is provided, and less likely to win if a very different input vector is provided. During training, as more inputs are presented, each neuron in th e layer closest to a group of input vectors adjusts its weights to more closely resemble th e inputs. Eventually, the com petitive network will categorize th e input vectors and every cluster of similar input vectors vdll have a neuron th a t identifies the presented vector if it belongs to th a t cluster [41]. According to th e equation 4.21 the following results are made: 1. The first principal com ponent of the input p is discovered by the first neuron in the Fig. 4.5, since p'{t) = p{t), j --1 

2. T he second neuron converges to th e first com ponent of p'{t) or equivalently to the second principal o fp (t). The reason is th a t th e first principal component or the first

In order to derive th e backpropagation learning rule, th e chain rule is used to rew rite the gradient error for each p a tte rn as th e product of two p artial derivatives. T he change in error as a function of th e net in p u t is reflected by th e first p artial derivative, and by th e second p artial derivative, th e effect of a weight change on a change in th e n e t input is reflected [36, 41].

Some practical aspects are considered and presented here to get good results when imple m enting M LP for segm entation. These aspects are discussed in following section and include selecting th e num ber of layers and th e num ber of neurons in each layer.

In a wide variety of applications generalized linear models are adequate an d hidden layers m ay n o t be needed at all. C ascading m ultiple layers of linear networks has no real bene fit in linear system s and th e p ro d u ct of th e weight m atrices of different layers provides an equivalent weight m atrix for th e network. Having nonlinear neurons in h idden layers makes a quite different situ atio n and more layers are used, m ore powerful networks are created. However, a simple linear m odel m ay provide b e tte r generalization th a n a com plicated non linear m odel. W hen th e function we w ant to approxim ate is m ildly nonlinear or enough d a ta is n o t available to estim ate th e nonlinearities by th e network accurately, a simple linear m odel is preferred. A lthough excessive num ber of layers provides more com plex function approxim ation, in practice it may n o t be productive and slower convergence m ay be caused 70

in the backpropagation learning. Therefore, identifying th e proper num ber of layers in the network is essential. In general, to approxim ate any nonlinear function, two layer networks are adequate and for any polyhedral separable decision regions, three layer networks are sufficed. As a result, for m ost applications two or th ree layers are adequate [45]. To select th e right num ber of layers for th e proposed M LP we should consider the n atu re of our problem th a t is image segm entation. Since classifying different textures in the given image is a nonlinear model, a nonlinear function should be approxim ated. Therefore a single layer M LP is n o t ap p ro p riate and proposed M LP m ust have two or m ore layers including one o u tp u t layer and a t least one hidden layer. As it was mentioned before, for universal approxim ation of any nonlinear function, two layer netw ork should be adequate. On the other hand a three layer network suffices for polyhedral separable decision region. As a result a M LP w ith two or three layers should be adequate for our application. To select the right num ber of layers between two and th ree layer perceptrons, b o th M LPs were im plem ented and fed w ith th e feature vectors. A ccording to th e train in g convergence curve, the required tim e (num ber of epoches) for train in g and classification error, th e num ber of layers for M LP are chosen. T h e results are discussed as follows. In Fig. 5.1 th e perform ance goal i.e. the estim ated error com puted by least m ean square is equal
0 .0 1

and th e m axim um num ber of

epoches is set to 3000. As we can observe in Pig. 5.1 according to th e num ber of epochs th e convergence curve of th e 3 layer perceptron converge faster th a n th e 2 layer perception to th e sam e perform ance goal. T he classification error of 3 layer perceptron in this case is less th a n th a t of 2 layer perceptron. It was 11.6 percent for 3 layer and 12.33 for 2 layer perceptron. O n th e o th er hand as depicted in Fig. 5.2 after passing th e same num ber

of epoches, th e achieved perform ance of 3 layer perceptron is b etter th a n th a t of

perceptron. T his perform ance is 0.0024 for 3 layer percep tro n and 0.0045 for 2 layer as well. T he m easured classification error is
8 .6

percent for 3 layer an d 9.28 for 2 layer, therefor In Fig. 5.3, although th e

achieved perform ance is b e tte r fo r 3 layer again in th is case.

perform ance of 3 layer is b etter th a n 2 layer i.e. 0.0018 for 3 layer perceptron and 0.0040 for 2 layer, th e observed classification error is 10.87 for 3 layer an d 10.01 for 2 layer. J u st in

such cases the measured classification of 2 layer is better th a n th a t of 3 layer. The reason of having bigger classification error despite achieving b etter performance goal in training could be explained by overfitting.

5 .1 .2

O v e r fittin g

O verfitting can be explained as getting large error in test phase in spite of driving the error on the training set to a very small value. It happens when th e network has memorized the training examples, b u t it has not learned to generalize the new situations. There are some m ethods to improve network generalization and to prevent from overfitting. One of these m ethods is to use a network th a t is ju st large enough to provide an adequate fit. By employing a larger network, th e estim ated function by the network is more complex. If we use a small enough network, it is less probable to overfit th e data. Since in m ost cases the proposed 3 layer perceptron has b etter performance and b etter classification error th an the 2 layer perceptron, we prefer to keep the number of layers equal to 3. Another m ethod to prevent overfitting is driving th e error on the training set to a small enough value to m aintain both a good performance and prevent overfitting or achieve b etter generalization. As we can observe in Fig. 5.3(a) which 2 layer perceptron reached the b etter classification error th a n 3 layer one, the performance goal is obtained by 3 layer is smaller th a n th a t of 2 layer and is th e smallest value th a t was achieved. As a result, we set th e performance to a small enough value for b etter generalization.

hill or valley w ith a relatively small num ber of u n its in the previous hidden layer [46]. For more com plicated targ et functions, especially those with several hills or valleys, it is useful to h-ive several units in the last hidden layer. A separate hill or valley can be approxim ated by ea.ch u n it in th e last hidden layer. A M LP w ith two hidden layers can often yield an accurate approxim ation with fewer weights th a n a MLP with one hidden layer and a M LP w ith three hidden layers can yield an approxim ation with fewer weights th a n a MLP w ith two hidden layers. In th e experiments, the number of neurons in th e last hidden layer (or o u tp u t layer) is considered as equal to the number of textures in th e image. Thus MLP can learn several hills and valleys equal to the number of textures. O n the other hand the number of neurons in the in p u t layer (first hidden layer) m ust be equal to th e dimension of extracted feature vectors and it is known. To Set the num ber of neurons in the first and last hidden layers or in the in p u t and o u tp u t layers, we should determ ine the number of neurons in the second or interm ediate hidden layer. A simple role to select th e number of neurons in th e interm ediate layers of M LPs is taking average on the num ber of neurons in the previous and next layers of th a t layer. Since propos<=d MLP is formed of 3 layers and the number of neurons in the input and o u tp u t layers are known, the num ber of neurons in the interm ediate hidden layer would be calculated by taking average on in p u t and ou tp u t layers. As it was mentioned before in th is section, the higher the number of neurons the more complex function would be approxim ated. Hence, we set th e number of neurons in the middle layer to different numbers in a range from half of the obtained average to two times of th a t number. Considering this range for th e num ber of neurons and m easuring th e performance goal in training phase and classification error in the test phase the num ber of neurons is chosen. To get th e b etter results and have a variety of choices a small range of num bers are proposed to select the number of neurons in the interm ediate layer. In Fig. 5.4 th e performance of the network according to the different num ber of neurons in th e middle layer are depicted. As we can observe, the performance of th e network in the Fig. 5.4(a) which the number of neurons is equal half the number of average of first and third layer is equal to 0.00578 and the classification error is

A backpropagation network follows th e contour of an error surface because it uses a gradient descent procedure. T he weight updates moving backpropagation network in th e direction of steepest descent in the error surface. For two layer networks the error surface is bowl shaped and there is not a problem using gradient descent to minimize the error so th a t the network will always find an errorless solution a t the bottom of the bowl. Such solutions are called global m inim a since they are errorless. However, to solve more difficult problems we m ust increase the num ber of layers. For example when an extra hidden layer is added, error surface may become more complex and may contain several minima. In such cases some minima could be deeper th a n the others and it is possible th a t a global m inim a wouldn't be found by gradient descent. In such cases th e network fall into local m inim a and would represent suboptim al solutions. W hen we train a backpropagation network we prefer to avoid local m inim a and this may be difficult to do in some cases. As a general rule. The more hidden units you have in a network th e less likely you are to encounter a local minimum during training. A lthough additional hidden units increase the complexity of the error

surface, th e number of possible escape routes will be increased by the ex tra dimensionality. Since m ore complex networks may cause the overfitting and increasing th e error in th e test phase, we prefer to keep th e network small enough. Using some other techniques such as adaptive learning ra te and m om entum can speed up backpropagation learning and made it less sensitive to small features in th e error surface such as shallow local m inim a .

There is no easy way of choosing a good learning rate for nonlinear m ulti-layer networks unlike linear networks. Choosing a too large learning rate leads to unstable learning and a learning ra te th a t is too small results in long training tim es conversely. T he problem is th a t nonlinear transfer functions in multi-layer networks introduce several local m inim a in the error surface. As gradient descent is performed on th e error surface it is possible for th e network solution to become trap p e d in one of these local minima. T rapping in a local minimum may be good or bad. It depends on how low an error is required and how close th e local minimum is to th e global minimum. Networks are also sensitive to the num ber of neurons in their hidden layers. Too few neurons can lead to underfitting. Too many neurons can contribute to overfitting. The selection of a learning ra te is an im portance issue in finding th e tru e global m inim um of th e error distance. B ackpropagation training w ith too sm all learning rate will make incredibly slow progress. Too large a learning rate will proceed much faster, b u t may simply produce oscillations between relatively poor solutions. Typical values for th e learning rate param eter are numbers between zero an d one:

0.01 < 7 7 < 0.75
Using the largest learning rate th a t still converges to the m inim um is preferred.

To speed up th e convergence in th e backpropagation algorithm and avoiding possible local minima, I use a fraction of previous weight change called m om entum to revise weights in the backpropagation learning. The idea is stabilizing the weight change and sm ooth updating by means of combining a fraction of th e previous weight change w ith th e gradient decreasing term : Awji{n) = 'qd-pjüpi + a A w j i{ n -- 1) where a istaken 0 < a < 0.9, and n is th e index of the current weight change.This (5.2) helps

80 direction unless th e gradient term causes an opposite direction. The m om entum has the following effects: · T h e weight changes may be sm oothed by m om entum and oscillations across th e error valley are suppressed · If weight changes are all in th e same direction, the learning rate will be amplified by th e m om entum and causes a faster convergence as a result · It enables to escape from local m inim a on the error surface solution For stable learning small learning rates are generally required using th e gradient descent algorithm and so it will be slow. T he m om entum variation is usually faster th a n simple gradient descent, since it allows higher learning rates while m aintaining stability.

In this section, some results obtained by applying the proposed approach and two widely used approaches for texture segmentation, Discrete Cosine Ti'ansform (DOT) and Laws filters are presented. As it is mentioned before in C hapter

, because of th e fast im plem entation

and good results, DCT n o t only is used in image compression algorithm s such as JPE G compression standard b u t also in image segm entation algorithm s such as 3 by 3 D C T th a t is introduced by Ng et. al. [37] to extract features from textured images. This filter bank has th e same 3 filters b o th in vertical and horizontal directions which results in a bank of 9 filters. Meanwhile separable filter bank introduced by Laws [35] to identify different textures generates good results for texture segmentation. This filter bank is composed of five filters in each dimension which concludes a group of 25 filters in th e filter bank. The results are obtained by applying th e proposed m ethod, D C T and Laws filters to two different types of images. T he first set formed of synthetic textured images and the second one is IKONOS satellite images. The segmentation results are com pared for b o th d ata types.

The improvement of results in comparison with DGT and Laws filters is presented in Table 6.1. As it can be observed in this table, CPM LP-GFH F has improved the classification results by 80% and 91% in com parison w ith DCT and Laws filters respectively. This am ounts are 85% and 93% for G D CT and AGFB using ju st 3 filters improved the segmentation by 12% and 58% com paring w ith D C T and Laws respectively. Segmentation results obtained by CPM LP-GFHF and G D CT are better th a n the other results. These approaches with 0.59% and 0.43% misclassification concludes almost a perfect classification for Fig. 6.1(a).

IK O N O S S a te llite Im ages

T he continuous grow th and expansion of urban areas is occurring on all megacities in the world like th e G reater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. The 2001 Census in C anada counted a population of 5.1 million in th e CTA, an increase of 9.8% from 1996. T he CTA accounted for 44.5% of O ntario's population in 2001, up from 43% in 1996. The main factor behind the population growth in the GTA was im m igration to Toronto. Between the 1996 and 2001 Census, Toronto received 69% and 53% of immigrants to the CTA and O ntario, respectively (M inistry of Finance Ontario, 2003) [50]. Like other N orth American megacities, the CTA is expending rapidly into adjacent landscape. This change in land-use and land-cover is of concern to urban and regional planners and m etropolitan government agencies, because th is growth has profound im pacts on th e available water resources, crop land and limited remaining space. A spatio-tem poral analysis of growth patterns is essential in order to

develop sufficient infrastructure to support the growth. Of particular interest to urban and regional planners are th e available tools and information th a t can be used to m onitor the spatial grow th of th e urban areas. Conventional surveying and mapping m ethods cannot deliver th e necessary inform ation in a timely and cost-effective mode. W ith th e availability of commercial very high-resolution satellite imagery such as IKONOS and QuickBird (up to 61 cm spatial resolution and 1 - 3 days tem poral resolution), it is possible to obtain detailed

information on urban land use and change detection. U rban growth analyses became more sophisticated w ith the use of a variety of image processing techniques w ith varying degrees of success, such as principal component analysis [51], V-I-S analysis [52], post-classification feature extraction [53], post-classification com parison [54], integration of rem ote sensing and GIS [55], normalized difference built-up index [56], combined fuzzy pixel-based an d objectbased classification [57], tex tu re analysis [58], spatial m etrics and texture measures [59]. However, classification and segm entation of satellite images of complex urban environm ents is a very difficult task due to mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and the tex tu red appearance of many land-use and land-cover types in urban areas. Conventional m ethods for pixel-based classification of m ulti-spectral satellite imagery such as parallelepiped, minimum distance from means, and m aximum likelihood [l]only utilize spectral inform ation and consequently have limited success in classifying high-resolution u rb an m ulti-spectral satellite images [60]. As m any urban land-use and land-cover types, such as roads, buildings, parking lots, etc., are spectrally similar, spatial information such as texture and context m ust be exploited to produce more accurate classification maps [61]. T he second set of images is 1 m spatial resolution pan-sharpened IKONOS satellite images of an urb an residential area. T he imagery used in this study covers a complex urban residential area mixing roads, paths, houses, and trees. It is located in th e northw est of the GTA, O ntario, C anada, near the Pearson International A irport. T he IKONOS imagery was geometrically corrected in two dimensions (X and Y) in th e Universal Transverse M ercator (UTM) projection coordinate system, zone 17 in th e Geodetic Reference System of 1980 (GRS 8 G) and N orth American Horizontal D atum of 1983 (NAD83). T he roads in th e image are continuous regions which form a network. Houses are very dense in th e image, some roofs of which have similar spectral characteristics as roads. Trees along the road are located close to houses. The results are obtained by applying th e proposed C M LP-G FH F m ethod, DCT and Laws filters to different sets of IKONOS satellite images. The segm entation results obtained using th e proposed CM LP-GFH F m ethod and th e com parison w ith th e D C T and Laws m ethods are shown and explained as following.

92 The images in Fig. 6.3(a) and Fig. 6.4(a) are sub-images of a large IKONOS satellite image of an urban residential area. The sub-images cover a complex urban residential area mixing roads, houses, and trees. T he segmentation results obtained by applying CPM LPG FH F, D C T and Laws to Fig. 6.3(a) are depicted in Fig. 6.3(b), Fig. 6.3(c) an d Fig. 6.3(d) respectively. A nother IKONOS sub-image of an urban residential area near international pearson airp o rt is segmented by proposed m ethod. Fig. 6.4(b) shows the segm entation results obtained by applying C PM LP-G FH F to Fig. 6.4(a). The segm entation results obtained by D C T and Laws are depicted in Fig. 6.4(c) and Fig. 6.4(d) respectively. As it can be visually observed, th e segm entation results of CPM LP-G FH F is much b etter th a n D CT and Laws filter bank. CM LP-G FH F m ethod has shown superior results for dealing w ith th e complex urb an residential situations. For example, vegetation (e.g., trees) and non-vegetation (e.g., buildings, roads, etc.) CM LP-G FH F method. are clearly classified in th e segmented images obtained using the

R e fin e m e n t t h e R e s u lts

To improve th e segm entation results obtained by applying th e proposed m ethod to the satel lite imagery, the results are refined according to a refinement m ethod th a t is presented. The proposed refinement m ethod is a greedy point m ethod with some attrib u tes inherited from region growing and split and merge methods. Boundary based segm entation is based on find ing the boundaries between regions which are based on discontinuities in gray level or using thresholds based on th e distribution of pixel properties. Conversely region based segmenta tio n m ethods are based on directly finding regions to achieve the goal th a t is partitioning th e image to th e regions.

If the entire image is represented by region G, region growing m ethod partitions O into R subregions, G i, G 2 , ..., O r , such that: · Pixels in a region m ust be connected: Gj is a connected region for j -- 1, 2,..., R

93 · The pixels in segmented region m ust satisfy some properties: W hen P { G j ) is a logical predicate defined over th e points in set Gj , P { G j ) = T r u e for j = 1 ,2 , R

· According to th e predicate P regions are different; P { G j U Gk) -- False, j ^ k · Each pixel must belong to a region and segm entation m ust be complete: UjLi Gj = G · The region must be disjoint: Gj U Gk = $, j k

Region growing based on some predefined criteria groups pixel or sub regions larger. W ith a set of seed points the approach is started and grow region by appending those neighboring pixels to each seed th a t have properties sim ilar to th e seed. For th e gray level images region analysis could be performed based on gray levels and spatial properties such as tex tu re or mom ents. If th e assum ption of a m odel of expected results is available, some additional criteria would improve a region growing algorithm based on th e available assum ptions which may utilize th e concept of the shape, size, likeness between a candidate pixel and th e pixels grown in the region so far, such as a com parison of th e average gray level of th e grown region and th e gray level of th e candidate pixel.

O n the oth er hand, split and merge algorithm initially subdivide an image to disjoint regions and th e n merge th e regions if some properties are satisfies by th e adjacent regions. This m ethod iteratively split the image to Gj distinct p artitions and sp littin g will be contin ued for any region th a t P{ Gj ) = F A L S E . W hen th e property P { Gj ) = T R U E is satisfied by th e pixels in the region, the process stops sp litting th a t region. M erge process starts as soon as all regions satisfy the property P { G j ) = T R U E . All adjacent regions Gj and Gk iteratively will be merged iî P { G j U Gk) = T R U E . W hen no further m erging or splitting is possible the algorithm will stop.

Since th e image is segmented, there are a few num ber of gray tones according to the num ber of classes so th a t pixels w ith th e sam e gray level are in the sam e class. In th e first

step of th is greedy p oint m ethod all of th e pixels belong to th e same class (possibly lo cated in different regions) in th e segm ented image are recognized and registered to th e same clusters. T h en boundary pixels will b e adjusted to th e neighboring cluster of this pixel ac cording to th e inter cluster distance criteria. T he inter class distance of clusters is defined as:
F
/=i

F o rj, fc = 1 ,2 ,..., C, j ^ k

where, F is th e num ber of the filters of th e G abor filter bank, C is th e num ber of classes, Gj and Gk are th e of an d classes respectively and is mean of class j over th e o u tp u t

filter of th e G abor filter bank. If by adjusting th e boundary pixel to th e neighbor

class of th is pixel th e inter class distance increase due to th is adjustm ent, th e pixel will be adjusted to th e neighbor class. O therw ise the boundary pixel remains in th e sam e class and will not be adjusted th a t m eans by adjusting th is pixel to th e neighbor class th e inter class distance will decrease. T he process will continue by following on from left to right and top to b otto m of th e segm ented image pixel by pixel. This m ethod is iterative and will be ended after some iterations.

There are some regions th a t are very small and m ay not be considered as a region in th e segm ented image. Thus next step of th e refinem ent algorithm sta rts by recognizing

all distinct regions of th e segm ented result. Since th e image is segm ented, th ere are some lim ited num ber of gray tones according to th e num ber of classes. T he homogeneity criteria in this step is gray level of th e pixels in th e segm ented result. After all adjacent pixels th a t satisfy th e m entioned property are grouped to th e proper regions, the regions among them w hich have very small sizes are recognized and will be merged w ith th e adjacent regions. A fter all d istin ct regions satisfy th e m inim um acceptable size the m erging process stops. The refinem ent algorithm can be ab stracted as; · B oundary A djustm ent

T h e refinem ent algorithm is applied to th e segm entation results obtained by C PM LP-G FH F. Fig. 6.3(e) shows th e result th a t is provided by refining th e Fig. 6.3(b). T he segmented resu lt of Fig. 6.4(b) after refinem ent is depicted in Fig. 6.4(e).

T he proposed m e th o d provided b e tte r results b o th for synthetic te x tu re d atase t images an d IKON O S satellite images. In case of sy n th etic images this m ethod reduced th e classifi cation error by 12% to 93% com paring th e results obtained by D C T and Laws, respectively. A pplying C P M L P -G F H F to th e satellite images, it can b e visually observed th a t th e segmen ta tio n results g enerated by this m eth o d are m uch b e tte r th a n D C T and Laws.

Chapter 7 Conclusion and Future Work
Discoveries about H um an Visual System (HVS) have proved th a t electrical impulses are passed from receptor cells th a t are located on th e back inner surface of th e eyes to the visual cortex placed in the brain. To reach th e visual cortex they are passed through various nervous pathways and the optic nerve. There is a considerable compression in the number of nerve fibers when this visual inform ation is transferred from the eye to the optic nerves. D ata compression and redundant inform ation removal lead to this fact th a t HVS performs some kind of coding before d a ta be received by th e visual cortex. These discoveries about th e mysteries of biological vision show th a t HVS is a complex system composed of different kinds of visual cells and very sophisticated various nervous pathways th a t transfer inform ation to optic nerves and visual cortex in th e brain. This was th e m otivation tow ard im plementing a very abbreviate im itation of HVS. To mimic this system G abor filter bank is used as the first stage for feature extraction. E xtracted features by simple cells in visual cortex are condensed, redundant information are removed and compressed inform ation are sent by hum an nervous system to hum an brain for segmentation and recognition. Neural Networks are used to remove redundant informa tion and segment the final extracted features because of their attributes which bear a strong resemblance with general functions th a t an abbreviated simple simulation of human visual system and hum an nervous system m ust performs.

C o n clu sio n

In this thesis, a m ethod for segmenting textm 'ed images using G abor filters has been pre sented. Considering th e attrib u tes of HVS, a hybrid algorithm was im plem ented using m ulti channel decomposition by G abor filter bank for feature extraction in conjunction w ith Artifi cial N eural Networks for b o th feature reduction and texture segmentation. T hree approaches were im plem ented to optimize G abor filter bank for image segm entation as follows; · F irst, A bank of 42 narrow band G abor filters composed of 40 G abor filters, low frequency and high frequency components. G abor filters have 22.5° angular bandw idth and k x 22.5° orientations when k changes from 0 to 7 and five radial frequencies having one octave bandw idth. T he low frequency com ponent is obtained by a G aussian low pass filter and th e high frequency com ponent is com puted by using th e G abor filter b an k and G aussian low pass filter. T he feature vectors have 42 elements for each pixel of th e image. This approach is nam ed C PM LP-G FH F as: C om petitive layer and M ulti-Layer Perceptron (CMLP) in conjunction w ith G abor F ilter bank and High Frequency com ponent (GFHF) · Second, A bank of 28 filters composed of 20 G abor filters w ith 45° bandvfidth, k x 45° orientations w hen k changes from 0 to 3 and five radial frequencies, and 8 D C T filters. B oth Gabor filter bank and D C T are applied to the textured image to generate a total num ber of 28 filtered images including 20 images generated by G abor filter bank and th e 8 others provided by DCT. T he resultant fea ure vectors have 28 elements for each pixel of the image. This approach is nam ed G D C T as; a joint G abor filter bank and DCT · T hird, A daptive G abor filter bank which composed of adaptively selected filters from th e G abor filter bank w ith 22.5° angular bandw idth. In this approach th e best Gabor filters are selected so th a t the energy ratio is maximum for each pair of distinct tex tures in a m ultiple textured image. T he num ber of elements in feature vectors differs

according to th e num ber of tex tu res in the image. This algorithm is referred AGFB as: A daptive G abor Filter Bank PGA was used to reduce th e feature dimension of the first approach. The im portant practical application of PGA is providing an effective m ethod to reduce the dimension of input d a ta space. By elim inating those linear combinations th a t have small variances the number of necessary features for effective d a ta representation could be reduced. To im itate HVS, a com petitive network was im plem ented for performing PGA to reduce th e dimension of extracted features. Gompetitive layer is trained by appl)dng th e training samples th a t are selected random ly from different regions of th e image. Eventually M LP will accomplish th e segm entation by learning the nonlinear relationship between quantized vectors and desired outputs. After M LP is trained, quantized feature vectors corresponds to each pixel of th e image are segmented to proper regions. The learning m ethod is backpropagation and m ean square error is employed as the performance of the network. The segm entation problem is form ulated as a com binational optim um problem to obtain a b etter filter bank, to reduce feature dimension and to segment with a b etter classifier. The m ain advantages of th e m ethod include: · It enables the use of larger filter iranks consisting of a higher num ber of channels. · It is capable to select b etter discrim inative features. · G apability of ex tract and combine th e information from multiple banks of filters. · The feature quantization and classification component of this algorithm is a generic approach w ith th e ability to learn and process different kinds of input feature vectors to quantize and segment. · This algorithm is capable of segmenting complex textured images. By three m entioned approaches G abor filter bank is optimized either by achieving more accurate results and reducing th e classification error or by reducing the filter bank size and

as a result feature dim ension reduction. C PM LP-G FH F and G D C T produces b e tte r results for both sjm thetic and satellite images th a n D C T and Laws filters and outperform s them . On th e other h an d AGFB, despite noticeable feature dimension reduction provides com parable results. A lthough for synthetic images the segmented results of D C T are acceptable, in the case of satellite images th e classification error is very high. On th e other hand Laws filter bank is more consistent th a n D C T to segment b o th synthetic and satellite images and it b e tte r performs to segm ent images.

Since there are several unknowns regarding G abor filter im plem entation which m ust be determ ined accurately to ex tract the features precisely for texture discrim ination, designing a b e tte r filter bank, more accurate selection from a wide range of values for each param eter and com bination of these values have a crucial im portance and m ay improve th e accuracy of this algorithm . A nother active area for future research is minimizing th e num ber of filters in th e G abor filter bank which is a very im portant and difficult challenging goal. Using a b e tte r learning m ethod for neural networks m ay also improve th e accuracy of this algorithm . T he algorithm could also be extended to problem s of segmenting th e biomedical images. It should be pointed out th a t although using proposed m ethod for segm entation of satel lite images good results are obtained, there are several overlapped classes in IKONOS satellite images of u rb an areas such as th e roof of the houses and th e roads which cause negative effect in th e accuracy level of th e classification process. T he overlapping areas have th e same te x tu al signatures an d are one of the m ain problems in segm entation. Hence, considering some excessive features (such as colour inform ation) m ay improve th e segm entation results of these overlapped areas. Future research also could be conducted on the application of th e proposed technique for segm entation of the other varieties of satellite images and SAR tex tu re images.

On th e other hand, this area is a broad research area an d is still developing rapidly. By improving our understanding about th e HVS, m ore accurate artificial vision system s could be im plem ented to mimic HVS and be used as com parison basis to m easure th e perform ance of machine vision models.
