MODELING THE BOND STRESS AT STEEL-CONCRETE INTERFACE FOR UNCORRODED AND CORRODED REINFORCING STEEL Alaka Ghosh MASc., Department of Civil Engineering, Ryerson University, 2004

Abstract
Corrosion of reinforcing steel causes cracking and spalling of concrete structures, reduces the effective cross-sectional area o f the reinforcing steel and the concrete and simultaneously decreases the bond strength at the steel-concrete interface. The detrimental effect o f corrosion on the service life of reinforced concrete structures highlights the need for modeling of bond strength between the corroded steel and the concrete. This research presents a nonlinear finite element model for the bond stress at the steelconcrete interface for both uncorroded and corroded reinforcing steel. The nonlinear finite element program ABAQUS is used for this purpose. The expanded volume of corroded product of reinforcing steel produces radial and hoop stresses which cause longitudinal cracks in the concrete. The increased longitudinal crack width, the loss of effective cross-sectional area of the steel and the concrete and the deterioration of rib height reduces the contact pressure which acts normal to the steel-concrete interface. The frictional force between the reinforcing steel and the concrete is also reduced due to the lubricating effect of flaky corroded layer. This research models the loss of contact pressure and the decrease of friction coefficient with the mass loss of the reinforcing steel. The model analyzes the pullout tests of Amleh (2000) and a good agreement is noted between the analytical and the experimental results. Both in FE analysis and experimental results, the loss of bond capacity is almost linear with mass loss o f rebar. FE analysis and experimental results show that, up to 5% mass loss, the bond capacity loss is moderate, at 10 to 15 % mass loss, significant amount of bond capacity is lost and at about 20% mass almost all bond capacity is lost. The model is also validated by analyzing the pullout tests performed by Cabrera and Ghoddoussis (1992) and those by Al-Sulaimani et al. (1990).

Chapter 1 Introduction

1.1 Background

The durability of reinforced concrete structures depends largely on the resistance of concrete against the chemical and physical factors and its ability to protect its embedded reinforcing steel against corrosion. Chloride-induced corrosion o f reinforcing steel in concrete bridge decks, parking garage slabs and marine structures is considered as the primary cause of deterioration of reinforced concrete structures. Corrosion o f the reinforcement leads to cracking, delamination and spalling o f concrete cover, reduction in the cross-sectional area of the reinforcing steel and the concrete and thus deteriorating the bond at the steel-concrete interface.

The reinforcing steel is protected in concrete against corrosion due to the high alkalinity of concrete. The steel is protected from corrosion by the oxide film that chiefly consists of .The penetration of carbonation or chloride ions causes the depassivation o f the

oxide film and corrosion of reinforcing steel commences. The expanded volume of corrosion products on the steel bar surface produces radial and hoop stresses at the steelconcrete interface which causes high tensile forces in the concrete specimen. As concrete is weak in tension, longitudinal cracks are formed in concrete specimens. The cracks allow oxygen and moisture to travel directly to the reinforcing steel at a faster rate, which in turn increases the rate of corrosion. With the increase o f corrosion, the width of longitudinal cracks is increased, which reduces the holding capacity and confinement of concrete. Therefore the normal contact pressure at steel concrete interface is reduced which is an important parameter for the bond characteristics at steel-concrete interface. In addition, the corrosion of steel deteriorates the rib height, thus reducing the bearing force of ribs and the mechanical interlocking between the steel and the concrete, which significantly deteriorates the contact pressure. The flaky corroded layer acts as a lubricant, which reduces the frictional force at the steel-concrete interface. This reduction

of contact pressure and frictional force causes considerable amount of deterioration of bond between the reinforcing steel and the concrete.

Bond stress is an important phenomenon for reinforcing steel embedded in conerete as it is responsible for transferring the load between the steel and the concrete. Therefore, it is very important to study the effect of corrosion on bond specially to model the bond stress at the corroded steel-concrete interface. To study this phenomenon some experimental works have been carried out in the past. Although these experimental studies showed many interesting features, several limitations still exist, such as determining the residual bond strength due to corrosion which is very important in predieting the service life of structures. Modeling the bond stress at the corroded steel-concrete interface is the first step in determining the residual bond strength.

Some researches have attempted to model the bond-slip behaviour at the steel-concrete interface by finite element analysis. No research is carried out to model the reduction of contact pressure and fnction at the steel-concrete interface due to corrosion. The purpose o f this research is to model the contact pressure and frictional force and thus model the bond stress at the uncorroded and the corroded steel-concrete interfaces.

1.2 Scope and Objective

The purpose of the study is to model the bond stress at both uncorroded and corrodedsteel concrete interface. The nonlinear finite element software ABAQUS is used for this purpose. There are two major objectives o f this research:

1. Modeling the material properties o f steel and concrete: The elastic and plastic behaviour of steel and concrete are defined to express the nonlinearity o f the response. The smeared cracking model is used to express the post cracking behaviour o f the concrete. Tension stiffening is defined to express the tension carrying capacity o f concrete after cracking.

2. Modeling the contact pressure and friction at steel-concrete interface and modeling the effect of corrosion on them: Two important phenomena associated with the bond stress such as contact pressure and friction are modeled. Moreover the effect of corrosion on them is also modeled.

The experimental data of the pullout test of Amleh (2000) are used to calibrate the model. Then the model is validated using the data of pullout tests of Cabrera and Ghoddoussis (1992) and that by Al-Sulaimani et al. (1990).

1.3 Thesis Layout

This thesis comprises seven chapters. This chapter (chapter one) addresses the background and scope of the research. Chapter two presents the background o f the bond between the reinforcing steel and the concrete. This chapter includes the mechanisms of bond, the factors affecting the bond behaviour and the modes o f failure o f bond. The effect o f corrosion on bond mechanism is also included. Chapter three reviews some models of bond behaviour for both uncorroded and corroded reinforcing steel. Chapter four presents the finite element model used in this research. Chapter five discusses the results obtained from the finite element analysis. It also reports the comparison o f finite element results with the experimental results. Chapter six presents the validation o f the model, which is done by using some experimental results. Finally, the conclusions and recommendations for further research are presented in Chapter seven.

Fundamentals of Bond between Steel and Concrete

2.1 Introduction

The behaviour of reinforced concrete structure largely depends on the bond at the steelconcrete interface. This chapter presents some basic information o f bond behaviour such as mechanisms of bond, bond failure mode, and the factors affecting the bond. It also presents how corrosion affects the bond behaviour at the steel-concrete interface.

2.2 Definition of Bond stress

"Bond stress is the name assigned to the shear stress at the bar-concrete interface which, by transferring load between the bar and the surrounding concrete, modifies the steel stress." (ACl Committee 408, 1966) This bond, when efficiently developed, enables the two materials to form a composite structure. The attainment of satisfactory performance in bond is the most important aim of the detailing o f reinforcement in structural components. Bond stresses in reinforced concrete members arise from two distinct situations: from the anchorage o f bars, and from the change of bar force along its length due to change in bending moment along the member.

2.3 Bond Mechanisms

According to Lutz and Gergely (1967), the bond mechanisms, that is transfer of the force from reinforcement to concrete and vice versa, depends on mechanical interlocking, adhesion and friction between the reinforcing steel and the concrete.

According to Park and Paulay (1975), the bond strength developed between the two ribs on the reinforcing bar is associated with the following stresses (Fig 2.1):

1. Shear stresses Ua, developed through adhesion along the surface o f the bar. 2. Bearing stresses /b, against the face o f the rib. 3. Shear stresses Uc, acting on the cylindrical concrete surface between the adjacent ribs.

Figure 2.1: The stresses between two ribs of a deformed bar (Park and Paulay, 1975)

For very small values o f the average bond stress t, the only resisting mechanism is the chemical adhesion, which enables concrete to follow steel deformations with no relative slip, or with negligible slip (Figure 2.2, r < r,, ).

At increasing values of the average bond stress, the chemical adhesion is destroyed as a consequence of the wedging action of the ribs, which pushes the concrete away and separates the concrete from the steel. As soon as transverse cracking occurs, the concrete

keys get deformed (Figure 2.3) in such a way that they tend to move away from the bar surface, between the ribs.

After the break down of the chemical adhesion, the next mechanism is due to the interaction between the ribs and the concrete. This interaction induces large bearing stresses under the ribs, and highly localized tensile stresses in the concrete at the tip of the ribs (Figure 2.4).

Figure 2.4: Longitudinal tensile stresses at the tip of the rib (Gambarova and Karakoc, 1982)

First internal crack develops as soon as the bond stress reaches a value r, (Figure 2.2) which is strongly dependent on the state of stress in the solid concrete close to the bar. The deformations of the concrete resulting from the stresses so generated tend to pull the concrete away from the steel in the vicinity of a major crack as shown in Figure 2.5. The tensile strength of the adhesive bond between the steel and the concrete is then reached, and the surrounding concrete separates from the steel. Different internal secondary cracks also form which may not propagate to the external surface of the concrete. In plain bars the bond stresses can be expected to disappear completely when separation between steel and concrete occurred. With deformed bars, bond forces are transmitted by rib bearing which is shown in Figure 2.5. By injecting ink between the reinforcing bar and the surrounding concrete. Goto found the sloping secondary cracks radiating from each rib as shown in Figure 2.6.

Figure 2.6: Formation of internal cracks (Goto, 1971)

When the concrete separates itself from the reinforcing bar at a primary crack, the circumference of the concrete surface, previously in contact with the bar, increases; hence, circumferential tensile stresses are induced. These stresses can lead to the longitudinal splitting cracks.

When the ultimate capacity in bond transfer is being approached, there would be some crushed concrete in front of the ribs. The compacted concrete powder, extending in front of the rib at a distance of up to three times the rib height, forms a flat wedge and this tends to push the concrete further away from the bar. Hence additional circumferential tensile stresses are generated which may cause a splitting failure.

Tepfers (1973) studied the circumferential stress distribution over the thickness o f the concrete cylinder, confining the reinforcing bars. These circumferential tensile stresses are the effect of the outward radial stresses which is caused from the action of the deformed bars on the concrete cylinder as shown in Figure 2.7. He assumed three stages in the bond response of the concrete cylinder: the uncracked stage, partially cracked stage and the plastic stage. In the plastic stage, a uniform tensile stress distribution was assumed over the thickness of the concrete cylinder.

Figure 2.7: Tensile stress ring (Tepfers, 1973)

Assuming short anchorage lengths, Tepfers (1979) derived equations for the three stages and found good agreement between the measured values of the short anchorage tests and

the

partially cracked theory. According to the cracked clasticbehaviour, the bond

strength, m^, at the cracking o f the concrete cover is given by equation 2.1.

u,=0.6{0.5 + c l d , ) f ,

(2.1)

For larger concrete cover thickness, the assumption o f a plastic behaviour at the steelconcrete interface gives:

u ,= 2 ( d d ,') f ,

(2.2)

where, = bond strength when the concrete cracks

c = minimum concrete cover thickness
db = diameter of the steel reinforcing bar / , = concrete tensile strength

2.4 Failure Modes of Bond

According to Rehm (1968) and Lutz and Gergely (1967), failure of bond between deformed bars and concrete can occur due to following reasons:

1) Crushing o f the concrete in front of the ribs. 2) Splitting o f the concrete by wedging action.

Rehm (1968) succeeded in relating the mode of failure o f the bond with the geometric parameter a/c (the ratio of the rib height to the rib spacing). When the ribs are high and spaced too closely, the shear stress will govern the behaviour and the bar will pull out.

When the rib spacing is larger than approximately 10 times the rib's height, the partially

10

crushed concrete may form a wedge in front of the rib, and failure is normally due to the splitting of the surrounding concrete. The two types of failure mechanisms associated with the rib are shown in Figure 2.8.

2.5

Factors Affecting the Bond Strength

The bond strength between the steel and the concrete depends on many factors such as concrete strength, steel strength, concrete cover thickness, embedment length of steel, rib geometry o f bar, spacing of bars, stirrups, temperature, corrosion etc. A brief discussion of different factors that affect the bond at the steel-concrete interface is presented in the following sections.

2.5.1 Influence of Concrete Strength

Compressive strength is considered to be a significant parameter because the force between steel and concrete is transferred mainly by bearing and bond failure may occur by splitting and shearing of the concrete (Orangun, et al. 1977). Tepfers (1973) showed

11

that with higher concrete strength, the slope of the bond str ess distribution varies considerably over the splice length compared to that with lower concrete strength.

The tensile and compressive stresses contribute to the development o f bond stress. For example, transverse micro cracks depend on the tensile stress of concrete while bearing stress induces high compressive stress in front o f the ribs. The tensile strength of concrete has a strong relationship with compressive strength of concrete.

Based on pullout test, Martin (1982) observed that for a slip range o f 0.1 to 1 mm, the bond stress is proportional to the compressive strength when concrete strength varies from 16 to SOMPa. He also found that for a very small slip, less than 0.01 mm, and for a high slip, larger than 1 mm, the influence of concrete compressive strength is less important and proportional to the 2/3 power of the concrete compressive strength.

2.5.2 Effect of Concrete Cover Thickness

Concrete cover gives the protection against transverse cracking which has a great effect on bond strength. Hence, bond strength increases with the increase of concrete cover thickness. Tepfers (1973) and Orangun et al., (1977) observed that the concrete cover and the reinforcement spacing significantly influence the type o f bond failure. Splitting tensile failure occurs with small concrete covers and bond capacity in pullout will be higher for the larger cover thickness.

2.5.3 Bar Profile

The geometry o f the bar ribs have great influence on bond strength. Rehm (1968) succeeded in relating aspects of bond problem to the geometric parameter a/c (rib height/rib spacing). He found the most satisfactory performance o f a bar embedded in concrete over the short length c when a/c was in the vicinity of 0.065. Figure 2.8 shows

12

the two types of failure mechanisms, associated with the geometric shape and size of the ribs. The deformation requirements of ASTM A 615-72 (1972), give the following range of values for a/c: 0.057 < a / c <0.072 (2.3)

Rehm (1957) and Lutz (1966) showed that for bars with steep rib face angle a (larger than 40 degrees with the bar axis) slip occurs only by the compression of the concrete in front of the bar rib, while in bars with flat ribs, i.e., the angle a is small, slip occurs with the ribs sliding relative to the concrete as the rib tends to push the concrete away from the bar.

Darwin and Graham (1993), found that the bond force-slip response is a fimction o f the relative rib area (projected rib area normal to the bar axis/ (nominal bar perimeter xcentre-to centre rib spacing)) of the bars. They concluded that under conditions of low confinement, bond strength is independent of the deformation pattern. Under conditions in which additional bar confinement is provided by transverse reinforcement or higher covers, the bond strength increases with an increase in the relative rib area.

2.5.4 Effect of Corrosion

Reinforcing steel corrosion is a major cause of the deterioration of reinforced eoncrete structures. At the initial stage of corrosion, the expansion o f corrosion product leads to increase of bond strength. However, with progressive increase in corrosion, the expanded volume o f corrosion product increases the radial stresses at the steel-concrete interface which causes longitudinal cracks of concrete. The increase of longitudinal cracks reduces the contact pressure at the steel-concrete interface which decreases the bond strength. At higher level of corrosion, the deterioration of the rib height also decreases the bearing area of the ribs. Al-Sulaimani et a l, (1990) state that the development of corrosion products along the bar surface causes significant loss o f bond between the concrete and the reinforcement due to the following two reasons: firstly, due to a reduction of

13

confinement pressure by the opening of longitudinal cracks along the reinforcement and secondly, due to significant changes at the steel-concrete interface caused by changes in the surface conditions o f the steel. The changes in the surface conditions due to corrosion are characterized initially by changes in the roughness of the surface, then by the development of a less firmly adhering interstitial layer o f corrosion products between the concrete and the steel and eventually, by local damage in terms of heavy pitting and degradation in the profile o f the bar ribs.

Cabrera and Ghoddossi (1992) found that the bond strength in pullout specimen is significantly decreased due to corrosion o f the reinforcing steel. Ami eh and Mirza (1999) stated that corrosion especially when severely localized, causes a significant reduction of interlocking forces between the ribs and concrete keys due to the deterioration o f the reinforcing bar ribs. Hence, the bond strength decreases significantly. Yoon et. al (2000) stated that corrosion reduces the cross-sectional area o f the reinforcing steel and it may cause stress concentrations in the reinforcing steel, decreasing ductility o f the structures, especially when pitting corrosion occurs.

The effect o f corrosion on bond strength is explained in CEP-FIP 2000. Figure 2.9 shows the effect of corrosion on the residual strength o f reinforced concrete structures.

2.6 Summary

Bond mechanisms at the steel-concrete interface largely depend on mechanical interlocking, friction and adhesion. The mode of failure o f bond depends on rib geometry of the bar. Corrosion of the steel in concrete is considered a fondamental problem in all concrete structures as the bond behaviour is seriously affected by corrosion o f the reinforcing steel.

3.2 Review of Models for Bond in Uncorroded Bar

Some models which described the bond stress at steel-concrete interface are reviewed in this section.

3.2.1 Mirza-Houde Model (1978)

Mirza and Houde tested 62 concentric tension specimens and measured the end slips, elongation o f the embedded bar. Following bond stress-slip relationship was derived using the experimental data.

3.2.2 The Comité Euro-International du Béton (CEB) Code Model (1990)

This model was proposed by Ciampi et al. (1981). The following equations were developed to describe the ascending and descending branches o f the model which is shown in Figure 3.2.

Where a is an empirical constant (0 < a < 1) that describes the shape of the bond stressslip curve.

The CEB Model Code states that the ascending branch refers to the stage where the ribs on the reinforcement penetrate into the mortar matrix, characterized by the local crushing and micro-craeking. Hence, in the ascending branch, the bond stress increases nonlinearly up to a point where the slip S is equal to Si (equation 3.17). The horizontal level between Si and S%occurs only for confined eoncrete, referring to advanced crushing and shearing off the concrete between the ribs (equation 3.18). During this stage, the bond stress is a constant maximum. The descending branch refers to the reduction of bond stress due to the splitting cracks along the bars (equation 3.19). The last horizontal part represents a residual bond capacity, which is maintained by minimum transverse reinforcement, keeping a certain degree of integrity intact (equation 3.20).

M artl's Model ( 1 9 9 9 )

Marti's approach is based on one main simplified assumption. His rigid-plastic assumption is that the bond stress is constant with respect to the variation of slip. Since the Young modulus o f steel varies between the elastic and the non-elastic region (Figure 3.3), Marti's assumption was on the change o f the Young modulus of steel, and he concluded that the bond stress would have two constant values, one before yielding and one after it. Figure 3.4 shows the rigid plastic assumption that has been made; in order to develop a bond-slip relationship before yielding and after yielding.

According to Marti, Bond stress before yielding is; î'io = 2 -0/,, (3.21)

The bond stress after Yielding is:

Lundgren and Gylltoft (2000) developed a model whieh deseribes the three dimensional analysis of bond stress at the steel-eonerete interface. In this model, splitting stresses of the bond action and the radial deformation between reinforcement bar and concrete were included. The model is a frictional model, using elasto-plastic theory to describe the relations between the stresses and the deformations. The relation between traction t and the relative displacements u is expressed in equation 3.25 and is shown in Figure 3.6.

3.3 Review of Bond Models in Corroded Bars

This section reviewed some models describing the bond strength for corroded reinforcing steel.

3.3.1 Coronelli's Model for Bond Strength of Corroded Rebar (2002)

Coronelli (2002) developed a model which predicted the bond strength for corroded bars in reinforced concrete structures. For this purpose he studied the interface pressure caused by the expansion of corrosion product at different confinement situations.

3.3.1.1 Bar-Concrete pressure

C rack width calculation- Coronelli (2002) used the relationship between the depth X of the corrosion attack and total crack width Wcr which was established by Molina et. al (1993) and presented in equation 3.41

(3.41, a) with

l = (V ,, - l) X

(3.41, b)

where,

t = thickness of corrosion product ^icorr ~ opening of each single radial crack;
ratio between the volumes of corroded and virgin steel

Equation 3.41 is established assuming that all corrosion products accumulate around the corroded bar. But the corrosion products tend to penetrate into the cracks and reach to the

31

external surface of the cover. Hence, Coronelli modified the Equation 3.41 which is presented in equation 3.42 and is shown in Figure 3.10 and 3.11.

Pressure Development in Confined Concrete- Coronelli modeled the concrete cover as a beam, with the cross section defined by the two orthogonal directions (Figure 3.12 (a)). The beam is loaded by a distributed force representing the resultant o f the pressure caused by the expansion of the corrosion products, and rests on evenly spaced supports that represent the confinement exerted by the surrounding concrete. The beam is also restrained by evenly spaced rods that model the legs of the stirrups.

3.3.2 Lundgren`s Model for Bond between Corroded Reinforcement and Concrete

(2002)

The free increase of the radius; i.e. how much the radius would increase if the normal stresses were zero is calculated from equation 3.50

3.4 Summary

The analytical models that were developed to discuss the bond strength o f uncorroded and corroded bars are reviewed. Corrosion of steel causes the change in contact pressure and fiiction coefficient at steel-concrete interface which are very important parameters of bond. Detailed research is needed to model the change o f contact pressure and friction coefficient due to corrosion of steel in concrete.

Finite Element Modeling of Bond Stress between Concrete and Uncorroded or Corroded Reinforcing Steel

A finite element (FE) model, describing the average bond stress at the steel-concrete interface and the effect of corrosion on the bond stress, is developed. The nonlinear FE software "ABAQUS" is used for this purpose. The results of the experimental study performed by Amleh (2000) on pull-out tests of concrete cylinders with uncorroded and corroded steel bars have been analyzed by finite element method. This chapter describes the procedure of developing the bond stress model for concrete and uncorroded or corroded reinforcing steel.

4.1 Modeling the Bond at the Steel-Concrete Interface The forces acting on the steel-concrete interface are shown in Figure 4.1. The radial force and the vertical component of reaction of lug cause the contact pressure at steel concrete interface which is modeled in the analysis.

The bond stress is computed by modeling the normal contact pressure and the friction at the steel-concrete interface. These phenomena are modeled for both uncorroded and corroded steel. Both elastic and plastic properties are assigned to express the nonlinear behaviour of steel and concrete. The analysis is carried out by the performing following tasks; 1) Details o f specimens 2) Assigning the material properties of steel and concrete 3) Defining the contact surfaces and assigning the properties at steel concrete contact interface 4) Assigning boundary conditions and loads 5) Making the mesh

4.2 Details of Pullout Specimens Amleh, (2000) used two types of concrete mixtures, 60MPa and 50 MPa for her pullout specimens. For each concrete mixture, four specimens with 25 mm, 50 mm, 75 mm and 100 mm thick concrete cover were used. The reinforcing steel used for all specimens are 20 mm diameter bars which are embedded concentrically in each cylinder. The embedded length of the bar is also fixed at 280 mm. The details of the test specimens are shown in Figure 4.2.

43.2.2 Concrete Smeared Cracking Model

The concrete smeared cracking model was used to express the behaviour o f concrete after cracking. In smeared crack model, the individual microcracks are not considered. The constitutive characteristic calculations are performed independently at each integration point of the finite element model and the presence of cracks enters into these calculations in which the cracks influence the stress and material stiffness associated with the integration point. The model consists of following parameters: · · Tension stiffening Stress ratios and strain ratio to define failure surfaces

4.3.2.2.1 Tension Stiffening

The tensile force in a reinforced concrete member is carried by both the reinforcing steel and the surrounding concrete. The tension stiffening effect represents the capacity o f the concrete between cracks to continue to carry tensile stresses and contribute to the overall stiffness. Figure 4.7 represents the variation of tensile stress with tensile strain for both the bare bar and the embedded bar. Figure 4.7 shows that at same tensile stress, the strain in the embedded bar is less than the strain in the bare bar. This smaller strain in the embedded bar is due to the contribution of concrete in carrying tensile stress. This phenomenon is termed as tension stiffening.

Tension stiffening option is used to define the behaviour o f concrete after cracking. The postfailure behaviour for direct straining across cracks is modeled with the tension stiffening option which defines the strain-softening behaviour for the cracked concrete. This option is used to define the residual tensile stress of the concrete normal to a crack as a function o f the deformation in the direction o f the normal to the crack. Tension stiffening describes the reinforcement interaction with concrete in a simple manner.

Figure 4.7: Tensile stiffening: Tensile stress versus tensile strain

The postfailure stress-strain relationship is used to express the tension stiffening. In postfailure stress-strain relationship, postfailure stress is used as a function of strain across the crack. Figure 4.8 shows the tension stiffening model where the tensile stress of concrete is a function of the tensile strain. In Figure 4.8 the concrete starts crack when it reaches the tensile strength cr" and after that point tensile stress at the crack is assumed to decrease to zero linearly, which describes the strain softening behaviour of concrete.

Input for tension stiffening

Figure 4.9 shows the variation of the ratio of tensile stress to the cracking tensile strength ( / « ) with the difference between the direct strain and the cracking strain (g - s "). It is

assumed that the strain softening after failure reduces the stress linearly to zero at a total strain of about 10 times the strain at the maximum stress. The strain at failure in standard concretes is typically 10"^, which suggests that tension stiffening that reduces the stress to zero at a total strain of about 10'^ is reasonable (Abaqus/Standard User Manual, Volume 2). According to the manual, the difference between the strain at failure and the strain at zero tensile stress is 0.0009. However, in the present investigation, this parameter is calibrated to 0.001 where it gave very good match with the experimental results. In Figure 4.8, the point A is the maximum stress point and the point B is the point when

47

tensile stress is reduced to zero. The coordinates of points A and B are defined in the analysis and are shown in Table 4.2.

43.2,2.2 Stress Ratios and Strain Ratio to Define Failure Surface

ABAQUS uses failure ratios to define the shape of the failure curves for the concrete model. Four values can be entered as data for this option:

1) The ratio of the ultimate biaxial compressive stress to the ultimate uniaxial compressive stress. The default value is 1.16.

2) The absolute value of the ratio of the uniaxial tensile stress at failure to the ultimate uniaxial compressive stress.

3) The ratio of the magnitude of a principal component of plastic strain at ultimate stress in biaxial compression to the plastic strain at ultimate stress in uniaxial compression. The default value is 1.28.

4) The ratio o f the principal tensile stress at cracking, in plane stress, when the other principal stress is at the ultimate compressive value, to the cracking tensile stress under uniaxial tension. The default value is 1/3.

The Figure 4.10 represents the failure surfaces for the concrete where cr, and cTj represent the principle stresses in directions 1 and 2, respectively. The point `biaxial tension stress' means pure tension in both directions 1 and 2. Similarly `biaxial compression stress' means pure compression in both directions 1 and 2. `Compressive yield surface' represents the inelastic response of the concrete when the principal stresses are dominantly compressive. `The crack detection surface' determines the stress at which crack takes place.

4.4 Material Properties of Reinforcing Steel Two types o f properties are used. 1) Elastic properties 2) Plastic properties

The properties o f reinforcing steel obtained from the experimental data that are used in the analysis are: Bar size: 20 mm diameter Yield strength: 433 MPa Modulus o f elasticity, Eg: 200,000 MPa

4.5 Modeling Contact Interface between Reinforcing Steel and Concrete Many engineering problems involve contact between two or more components. In these problems, a force normal to the contact surfaces acts on the two bodies, when they touch each other. If there is friction between the surfaces, shear forces can be created that resist the tangential motion (sliding) of the bodies.

51

There are three steps in defining a contact simulation: 1) Defining the surfaces of the bodies that could potentially be in contact. 2) Specifying which surfaces interact with one another. 3) Defining the mechanical and thermal surface interaction models that govern the behaviour of the surfaces when they are in contact.

4.5.1 Defining Contact Surfaces The inner surface of concrete cylinder and the outer surface of steel bar, which are in contact with each other, are defined in the model. ABAQUS uses a pure master-slave contact algorithm. Nodes on one surface (the slave) cannot penetrate the segments that make up the other surface (the master), as shown in Figure 4.11.

Master surface (nodes)

Penetration of master surface

Figure 4.11: Master surface and slave surface (Abaqus/Standard User's Manual Volume 3) Criteria for choosing the master and the slave surface of a contact pair between two bodies: When both surfaces are deformable, the master surface should be chosen as the surface of the stiffer body or as the surface with a coarser mesh. In the case of reinforced concrete

52

the two surfaces in contact are the inner surface of the concrete cylinder and the outer surface of the steel bar.

The stiffness of the concrete cylinder, A T , = -^ ^ = 3.69xlO^N/mm (considering 25 mm cover specimen and compressive strength as 50 MPa) The stiffness o f steel bar, A T , = -- = 2.2 x 10' N/mm Because the concrete cylinder is stiffer than the bar, the analysis used the inner surface of concrete cylinder as the master surface and the outer surface of steel bar as the slave surface. Figure 4.12 and 4.13 show the slave and master surfaces that were used in the analysis.

4.5.2 Modeling Contact Pressure and Friction There are different methods for defining the components o f a mechanical surface interaction model (Abaqus/Standard User's Manual, Volume 3) · · · Friction (Interaction tangential to the surface) Relative surface motion Softened contact (Interaction normal to the surface)

4.5.2.1 Modeling the Contact Pressure

The following contact pressure-overclosure relationships are used in ABAQUS to define the contact model: · The "hard" contact relationship, which allows no penetration o f the slave nodes into the master surface and no transfer of tensile stress across the interface;

54

·

A modified "hard" contact relationship, which allows some limited penetration of the slave nodes into the master surface and some transfer o f tensile stress across the interface;

·

A "softened" contact relationship in which the contact pressure is a linear function of the clearance between the surfaces;

·

A "softened" contact relationship in which the contact pressure is an exponential function of the clearance between the surfaces;

· A "softened" contact relationship in which the contact pressure is a piecewise linear (tabular) function of the clearance between the surfaces; · A relationship in which there is no separation of the surfaces once they contact; · A clearance-dependent viscous damping relationship. In this model, the softened contact, in which the contact pressure is an exponential function of the clearance between the surfaces, is used. "Softened" Contact Model Three types of "softened" contact relationships are available. The pressure-overclosure relationship can be prescribed by: · · · Using an exponential law. Using a tabular piecewise- linear law. Using a linear law.

Softened Contact Defined With an Exponential Law Figure 4.14 shows the softened contact at the contact interface where the X axis defines the clearance between the contact surfaces and Y axis defines the contact pressure which acts normal to the contact surfaces.

In softened contact, the surfaces begin to transmit contact pressure once the clearance between them, measured in the contact (normal) direction, reduces to c. The contact

55

pressure transmitted between the surfaces then increases exponentially as the clearance continues to diminish. Here, p* ^ is the contact pressure at zero clearance and c is the clearance between the surfaces at which contact pressure decreases to zero.

4.5.2.1.1 Modeling Contact Pressure at the Uncorroded-Steel Concrete Interface

In the bond model, p° varies with concrete cover thickness as it is the only variable. Different values of p® are taken as a trial and the results are compared with the experimental results. When the results give better agreement with the experimental results then the data is taken as an input. Using regression analysis, an equation expressing the relationship between contact pressure at zero overclosure and the concrete cover thickness is derived which can be used to calculate contact pressure for any concrete cover thickness. Figure 4.15 shows the relationship between the contact pressure and the concrete cover thickness.

p°= contact pressure

4.5.2.1.2 Modeling Contact Pressure at the Corroded Steel-Concrete Interface

The contact pressure at the steel-concrete interface decreases due to the corrosion of reinforcing steel. The expanded volume of corrosion products on the steel surface

58

produces the radial and hoop stresses which cause high tensile forces in concrete and the longitudinal cracks are formed in concrete. With further volume expansion o f corrosion products the width of longitudinal cracks increases and it propagates; this reduces the contact pressure gradually. At higher level of corrosion, the rib height decreases significantly due to the deterioration of the ribs. Due to large amount of degradation of lugs, the deformed bar act as a plain bar and the horizontal component o f bearing force produced by mechanical interlocking is significantly reduced. Therefore, the deterioration of the rib height and the loss of effective cross-sectional area of reinforcing steel cause a significant decrease in the contact pressure. The flaky layer of the corrosion products decreases the holding capacity of the concrete which also reduces the contact pressure. The loss o f contact pressure due to corrosion depends on several factors such as the mass loss of reinforcing steel, concrete cover thickness, compressive strength o f concrete and the diameter o f the steel bar. In the present analysis the variables are concrete cover thickness, mass loss of steel and compressive strength of concrete. For each concrete cover thickness, different contact pressures are used and compared with the experimental results. When the results match well with experimental results it is taken as an input. Figure 4.16 shows the variation of loss of contact pressure with mass loss o f reinforcing steel for 60 MPa concrete specimens. Equations showing how loss of contact pressure varies with mass loss for different concrete cover thickness are developed. For 60 MPa concrete, equations (4.12, a) to (4.12, d) show the loss of contact pressure with mass loss of steel for different concrete cover thickness and are:

Z, = 3.88M Zj = 3.5M Zj = 3.1M

By using regression analysis o f the constants of equation (4.14, a) to (4.14, c) with concrete cover thickness a general equation for 50 MPa specimens is derived as:

L = (-0.0148C + 4.3)M

(4.15)

where,

L = percentage loss o f contact pressure
C = concrete cover thickness

M = percentage mass loss of reinforcing steel

Combining equations (4.13) and (4.15), a general equation for all specimens is developed as:

L = ((-0.00024/; - 0.0028) C +4.3) M
where, = compressive strength of concrete

(4.16)

So using the above equation, the loss of contact pressure at different level o f corrosion for any specimen can be calculated.

4.S.2.2 Modeling Friction at the Steel-Concrete Interface

When surfaces are in contact, they usually transmit shear as well as normal forces across their interface. There is generally a relationship between these two force components. The relationship, known as the friction between the contacting bodies, is usually expressed in terms of the stresses at the interface of the bodies. The available friction model in ABAQUS (Abaqus /Standard User Manual volume, 3) is as follows: · Extended version of the classical isotropic Coulomb friction model

62

·

Friction coefficient in terms of the slip, contact pressure, average surface temperature at the contact point and field variables

·

Exponential decay friction model in which user can define a static and kinetic fiiction coefficient with a smooth transition zone defined by an exponential curve

· Shear stress limit which is the maximum value of shear stress that can be carried by the interface before the surfaces begin to slide · Anisotropic fiiction model · A stiffness (penalty ) method · Lagrange multiplier method to model sticking conditions exactly

Exponential decay fiiction model is the best for analyzing the fiiction at the steelconcrete interface.

4.5.2.2.1 Modeling Friction Coefficient at the Uncorroded Steel-Concrete Interface In this model, it is assumed that the fiiction coefficient decays exponentially from the static value to the kinetic value according to the equation:

(4.17) where, is the kinetic friction coefficient - the fiiction coefficient at highest slip rate. is the static friction coefficient - the fiiction coefficient that opposes the initiation of slipping from a sticking condition. In the default model the static friction coefficient corresponds to the value given at zero slip rates is a user defined decay coefficient. is the slip .

Lundgren and Gylltofr (2000) developed a relationship between the friction coefficient and the slip using some tests results of Tepfers and Olsson (1992). The relationship is shown in Figure 4.18.

4.S.2.2.2 Modeling Friction Coefficient at the Corroded Steel-Concrete Interface

When the reinforcing steel is corroded, the accumulation of a heavy layer o f the flaky corroded material around the bars acts as a lubricant and reduces the friction at the steelconcrete interface. The value of the kinetic fiiction coefficient is constant at 0.4. The value of static fiiction coefficient decreases with the mass loss. Using parametric studies, the relationship between the static fiiction coefficient and mass loss is obtained. The variation of the decaying coefficient with mass loss is also obtained by parametric studies. Figures 4.21 and 4.22 show the variations of the static fiiction coefficient and the decaying function at different mass losses, which are obtained by regression analysis.

Figure 4.23 shows the variation of friction coefficient with slip at different mass losses. From Figure 4.23, it is clear that up to 5 to 10% mass loss, the decrease of friction coefficient is not significant. However when the mass loss is more than 10% the friction coefficient becomes very small, because at high level of corrosion, the flaky corroded layers of steel act as a lubricant which reduces the friction significantly.

The bond stress at the steel-concrete interface is modeled by developing the contact properties such as contact pressure and friction at the steel-concrete interface. The effect of corrosion on contact pressure and friction is also modeled at the corroded steelconcrete interface. The elastic and plastic properties of both the reinforcing steel and the concrete are assigned to provide nonlinear analysis.

Analysis of Results of Finite Element Analysis

This chapter presents the results obtained from finite element analysis o f some pullout tests, performed by Amleh (2000) to investigate the effect of corrosion on the bond strength at the steel-concrete interface. The results of finite element model are compared with experimental results. The model is also validated by analyzing some pullout tests of Cabrera and Ghoddoussis (1992) and Al-Sulaimani et al. (1990).

5.1 Analysis of Results of Uncorroded Specimens

5.1.1 Relationship of Bond Stress and Slip

In pull-out tests, slip is measured at the loaded end for each load increment up to failure, which can be due to the splitting of the concrete or pullout o f the bar from the specimen or yielding o f steel bar. The average bond stress is obtained by dividing the applied load by the total surface area of embedded portion of the bar. The average bond stress is given by:

where,

u = average bond stress P = maximum load L = embedded length of reinforcing steel df, = diameter of reinforcing bar, (# 20 bar was used for all specimens)

75

The bond stress at each load level is plotted against the loaded end slip for the experimental values and the results from the finite element analysis. Figures 5.1 to 5.6 show the comparison of the experimental results with those of FE analysis. The failure is defined as the point of maximum bond stress and corresponding slip is called the slip at failure.

Good agreement is noted between the results obtained from FE analysis and experiments. As can be seen from Figures 5.1 to 5.6, the bond stress-slip curves obtained experimentally and from FE analysis show a linear relationship between bond stress and slip up to 50 to 70% of the maximum bond stress. Thereafter, the bond stress increases gradually with the increase in slip. When the point of maximum bond stress is reached, the slip increases with constant bond stress.

5.1.2 Bond Stress and Slip using Very Fine Mesh

The variation of bond stress with slip for 25 mm cover is obtained using very fine mesh. Then the result is compared with that of relatively coarser mesh and also with experimental results which is shown in Figure 5.7. The Figure 5.7 shows that both the curves obtained using very fine mesh and relatively coarser mesh match well with experimental results. Therefore, the coarser mesh is used as it is time effective.

5.1.3 Effect of Concrete Cover Thickness on Bond Strength

Concrete cover is an important parameter for bond strength. Figures 5.8 to 5.11 show that the average bond strength increases with the increase of concrete cover thickness for both 60 MPa and 50 MPa concretes.

In Figure 5.10, both the computed and experimentally observed results show that bond strength increases with the increase o f concrete cover thickness. In FE analysis, with 60 MPa concrete, the average bond strengths for 25 mm, 50 mm and 75 mm thick concrete cover are 4.8 MPa, 8.6 MPa and 9.2 MPa respectively. Bond strength for 50 mm cover is 78.8% higher than that of the 25 mm cover, whereas bond strength of 75 mm cover is 7.3% larger than that of 50 mm concrete. Therefore, the model predicts well the effect of concrete cover thickness on bond strength that is typical of that observed in the experiments.

80

The FE analysis reveals that with the 50 MPa concrete, bond strengths for 25 mm, 50 mm and 75 mm cover are 3.2MPa, 8.6 MPa and 9.0 MPa, respectively, as shown in Figure 5.11. Therefore, the difference between bond strengths of 50 and 75 mm cover is 4.6%, whereas the difference is around 165% for that of concrete covers of 25 mm and 50 mm thickness.

In FE analysis, the computed average bond strengths for 60 MPa concrete are 54%, 5% and 3% higher than those for 50 MPa concrete for 25 mm, 50 mm and 75 mm thick concrete cover respectively. In experimental observation, these differences are 63%, 0% and 18% for 25 mm, 50 mm and 75 mm concrete cover respectively.

5.1.5 Comparison of Finite Element Analysis with Experimental Results

The comparison between the bond strengths for different cover thickness obtained from FE analysis and experimental results is shown in Table 5.1 and 5.2. Table 5.1 shows that for 60 MPa concrete, the differences of bond strength, obtained from the FE analysis and from the experimental results, are 6%, 11% and 26% for 25 mm, 50 mm and 75 mm thick concrete covers respectively. Again, Table 5.2 shows that, for 50 MPa concrete, these differences are 2.8%, 10.7% and 8.8% for 25 mm, 50 mm and 75 mm thick concrete covers respectively.

The bond stress-slip curves (Figure 5.1 through 5.6) show that initial slopes of the bond stress-slip curves obtained from FE analysis are higher than those of experimental results. However the ultimate bond strengths obtained from the experiment are little bit higher than those of FE analysis.

5.2 Analysis of Results of Corroded Specimens

5.2.1 Bond Stress-Sllp Relationship for Corroded Specimens

The variation of bond stress with slip at different levels of corrosion for different types of concrete cover thickness is shown in Figures 5.14 to 5.19. The figures also feature the comparison between experimental results and the results from the FE analysis. Good agreements are found between these two results. Specifically, 25 mm cover specimens showed very good agreement.

These plots show the effect of corrosion in both experiment and FE analysis, which decreases the average bond strength and increases the slip. The effect o f corrosion on

the initial slip is clear from the figures, as was obtained from the experimental results. The initial slope o f the average bond stress-slip curve for the FE analysis decreases with corrosion and high amount of slip occurs at higher level of corrosion. It was also observed that with low level of corrosion, the average bond strength increases as the roughness o f the steel bar increases slightly due to corrosion products. With higher level

86

of corrosion, the initial firm layer o f corrosion product converts into flaky layers. Due to the lubricating effect of flaky layer, a small amount of load causes a larger slip. The following observations are made for the specimens with 25 mm thick concrete cover:

1) At 2.5% mass loss, the slip started at a very small load and in FE model the loss of bond capacity is 26% for 60 MPa concrete where this loss is 27% for 50 MPa concrete. The experimental bond capacity losses are 26% and 24% for 60 MPa and 50 MPa concretes, respectively. At this level of corrosion, the expanded volume o f corroded product causes longitudinal cracks which reduce the contact pressure at the steel-concrete interface and the model showing the reduction of contact pressure with corrosion is shown in equation 4.16 in Chapter 4.

2) When the mass loss is 5 %, the loaded end slip is very high and almost 50% loss of bond capacity is noted both in FE analysis and experimental results. At this level of corrosion, the longitudinal crack width is so high that the contact pressure reduces significantly and failure occurs due to the splitting o f the concrete.

3) At 10% mass loss, the shape o f the average bond stress-slip curve is different from that for uncorroded specimen. Large amount of slip occurs fi' om the very begirming. Around 80% bond capacity loss is noted in both FE and experimental analysis. At this level of corrosion, the degradation o f lugs, accumulation of heavy flaky corroded layer and large longitudinal cracks cause a larger reduction of contact pressure and friction which are modeled as shown in equations 4.16 and 4.20 in Chapter 4.

The following observations are made for the specimens with 50 mm thick concrete cover:

1) At a mass loss o f 2.5%, the bond stress-slip behaviour is almost the same as for the uncorroded specimens with a loss o f about 4% o f the bond capacity in FE analysis results and a bond capacity loss of 1.5% for experimental analysis. 2) For 5% mass loss, the initial slope of the average bond stress-slip curves for both the FE analysis and experimental results decreases, but not significantly and bond capacity

87

loss is around 20%. At this level o f corrosion, the longitudinal cracking commenced and some degradation of lug height is also noted which causes degradation o f bearing pressure and contact pressure at the steel- concrete interface which are modeled following the procedures in Chapter 4.

3) For 10 % mass loss due to corrosion, the shape of bond stress and slip is almost the same as for the uncorroded specimen but initial slope decreases significantly and a 50% bond capacity is lost in both FE analysis and experiment results. The width of the longitudinal crack is significant. Significant amount of degradation o f lug height reduces the bearing force and mechanical interlocking between the steel and the concrete. The fHction between steel and concrete also decreases.

4) The experimental and FE analysis results for 15 to 20 % bar mass loss show that the shape of bond stress-slip curves are totally different fi'om those for the uncorroded specimen. A large amount of slip occurs with a small application of load and about 70 to 90% bond capacity is lost. At this level o f corrosion, due to large amount o f degradation o f lugs, the deformed bars behave similar to plain bars and the horizontal component of the bearing force produced by mechanical interlocking is significantly reduced. The pullout of the rebar is, therefore, facilitated and occurs at a lower load. Besides, the accumulation of a heavy layer o f flaky corroded material around the bars acts as a lubricant and reduces the frictional component of the bond strength.

The following observations are made for the specimens with 75 mm thick concrete cover:

1) For a mass loss of 2.5%, the results for the experimental and FE analysis show that the bond stress-slip curves are almost same as for the uncorroded specimen but the bond capacity increases by about 5%. For this level o f corrosion, the expanded volume of corroded product increases mechanical contact pressure at steel-concrete interface and the roughness of the corroded product also increases the friction which increases the bond capacity at this level of corrosion.

88

2) When rebar mass loss is 5%, the decrease o f the initial slope of bond-slip curve is very small and around 10% of the bond capacity is lost. The longitudinal cracks start at this point, but this is not significant, and the degradation of bond capacity is also small.

3) For a rebar mass loss o f 10%, the initial slope of bond-slip curve decreases but not significantly and the loss of bond capacity is around 38%. At this level o f corrosion, the width of longitudinal cracks and degradation of lugs height are significantly larger.

4) From FE analysis and experimental results, it is observed that fori 5% to 20% rebar mass loss, the decrease of bond stress- slip is very high and around 65% to 90% bond capacity losses occur. At this level of corrosion very low load causes large slip.

In the experimental results, high level of corrosion resulted in large slips from the very beginning o f the test but suddenly the slope of the bond stress-slip curves increased i.e. with a small increase of slip, large amount of average bond stress was noted. This occurs because during pulling of the bar occasionally the corrosion products accumulated at some places along the rebar and grip the concrete which increased the stiffness temporarily. This phenomenon was disregarded in the FE analysis. It should be noted that in FE analysis the corrosion was assumed to be uniform over the entire embedded length. However, in experiments it was difficult to maintain uniform corrosion especially for long embedment lengths. The bars removed from the corroded specimens, show some pitting corrosion which caused sudden decrease o f bond capacity at different locations.

5.2.2 Effect of Corrosion on Bond Strength

The effect of corrosion in terms of mass loss on bond strength is shown in Figure 5.20 throu^i Figure 5.23 where the mass loss is the percentage of loss o f weight o f the bar. Figure 5.20 and Figure 5.21 show the bond strength at different levels o f corrosion for both FE analysis and experimental results. Figure 5.22 and Figure 5.23 show how bond strength decreases with the mass loss.

It is clear from Figure 5.22 and 5.23 that both the experimental and FE analysis results show that the rate of bond capacity loss in case of 25 mm cover is the highest. The loss of bond capacity is almost linear with mass loss. In FE analysis, for 50 mm thick concrete cover specimens with 60 MPa concrete mixtures, at 2.5 % mass loss, the loss of bond strength is 4.8% where at 5% mass loss the loss of bond strength is 20% and at 10% mass loss the loss of bond strength is about 50%. Therefore the rate of loss of bond capacity is higher at higher level of corrosion. Good agreement was noted between the experimental and the finite element analysis results.

Figures 5.22 and 5.23 show that for both FE analysis and experimental results, up to 5% mass loss, the bond capacity loss is moderate, at 10 to 15 % mass loss, significant amount of bond capacity is lost and at about 20% mass almost all bond capacity is lost.

From the Table 5.3 and 5.4 it is clear that both in the FE analysis and experimental results 50% bond capacity is lost at 5% mass loss for 25 mm thick cover, at 10% mass loss for 50 mm thick cover and at 15 % mass loss for 75 mm thick cover. Tables 5.3 and 5.4 show good agreements between the results of FE analysis and those from the experimental works.

5.2.3 Effect of Concrete Cover Thickness on the Bond strength at the Corroded Steel-Concrete Interface

The concrete cover thickness is an important parameter on the effect of corrosion. When the rebar is corroded, the increased volume of corrosion product produces the bursting force which causes cracking of concrete. The resistance of bursting force depends on cover thickness of concrete. Therefore the concrete cover thickness and bar diameter ratio(c/db) is considered as a significant parameter.

Figures 5.24 to 5.27 show the effect of concrete cover on the loss o f bond capacity at 5% and 10% mass loss. The variation of the loss of bond capacity with concrete cover thickness is almost linear. In FE analysis, for 60 MPa concrete at 5 % mass loss, the loss of bond capacity are 54%, 19% and 13% for 25 mm, 50mm and 75 mm concrete cover thicknesses, respectively.

5.2.4 Effect of Compressive Strength of Concrete on the Bond strength at the Corroded Steel-Concrete Interface

The effect of compressive strength on the loss of bond strength due to corrosion is shown in Figure 5.28 to 5.31. In the case of 25 mm concrete cover thickness, 60 MPa concrete demonstrates better performance as compared to the specimens with 50 MPa concrete with the same concrete cover. It should be noted that the effect of corrosion is almost same for concrete covers 50 mm and 75 mm thick.

5.3 Validation of the Model

The model developed to determine the bond stress at uncorroded and corroded steelconcrete interface is validated by analyzing some pullout tests. The pullout tests performed by Cabrera and Ghoddoussis (1992) and Al-Sulaimani et al. (1990) were analyzed with the model, and the FE and experimental results are compared.

5.3.1 Cabrera and Ghoddoussis' (1992) Pullout Test

The bond model is validated by using the results of Cabrera and Ghoddoussiss' (1992) pullout tests which were performed on 150 mm cubes with 12 mm diameter reinforcing bar centrally embedded in the cube to find the effect of corrosion on the bond strength at the steel-concrete interface. A short embedded length, that is 4 times the bar diameter of the reinforcing steel is chosen to ensure the splitting failure or the failure by yielding of the reinforcing steel. The average 28 day compressive strength of concrete mixture was 56 MPa. Figure 6.1 shows the variation of bond stress with slip for both the experimental and FE analysis results at different level of corrosion. Figures 5.31 and 5.32 show that the bond strength decreases with corrosion in both experiment and FE analysis. The results of finite element analysis show very good agreement with the experimental results as shown in Figures 5.32 to 5.34.

5.3.2 Pullout Tests of Al-Sulaimani etal. (1990)

The bond model is used to analyze the results of pullout tests conducted by Al-Sulaimani et al. (1990). The pullout tests were conducted on 150 mm cubic concrete specimens with 10 mm diameter reinforcing bar surrounded centrally. The ratio of embedded length and bar diameter (L/dy) is 4, and the average compressive strength of concrete is 30 MPa. Figures 5.35 to 5.37 show how the corrosion affects the average bond stress at the steelconcrete interface in both FE and experimental analysis. The FE analysis results compare well with experimental results.

5.4 Summary

The bond model developed in Chapter 4 is calibrated by analyzing the pull-out test performed by Amleb (2000). The results obtained from the experiment and the FE analysis, are compared by plotting the bond stress-slip curve for specimens with corroded and uncorroded reinforcing steel, the bond strength at different level of corrosion etc. The FE model shows very good agreement with the experimental results.

The model is also validated by analyzing some pullout tests o f Cabrera and Ghoddoussis (1992) and Al-Sulaimani et al. (1990) and the FE analysis and experimental results are compared. A good agreement was noted between the results of the experiment and the FE analysis; this shows a good validation of the model.

Conclusions and Future Recommendations

6.1 Conclusions

A model of bond stress at the steel-concrete interface for both uncorroded and corroded reinforcing steel is developed. The nonlinear finite element software "ABAQUS" is used to develop the model. The mechanical behaviour o f contact interface between the steel and the concrete is developed by modeling the contact pressure and the fiiction.

The bond between steel and concrete is the critical feature of reinforced concrete structures. It enables the use of concrete, which has low-tension, as a structural material. For developing the model of bond stress, it is very important to define the mechanical behaviour at the steel-concrete interface. Therefore, the model defines the contact pressure which acts normal to the steel concrete interface and the fiiction acting parallel to the contact surfaces.

When the reinforcing steel is corroded, the expanded volume o f corrosion product increases the hoop and radial stresses which cause longitudinal cracks on the concrete. With the increase of corrosion, these cracks propagate and the width of the cracks increases. Therefore, the holding capacity of concrete is decreased which reduces the contact pressure at the steel concrete interface. Moreover, due to deterioration of the ribs, the rib height decreases significantly which affects the interlocking capacity of the steel and the concrete and the horizontal component of the bearing force of the ribs also decreases. Therefore, the deterioration of the ribs and the reduction o f the effective crosssectional area of the steel bar cause the significant reduction of the contact pressure.

109

The flaky corroded layer acts as a lubricant which reduces the friction at the steelconcrete interface. The reduction of contact pressure and fiiction at different level of corrosion is modeled. The equations describing the contact pressure and fiiction at different levels of corrosion are developed. Thus the bond stress at the steel-concrete interface is computed.

The pullout tests performed by Amleh (- 000) are used to calibrate the model. Then the results o f finite element (FE) analysis a e compared with the experimental results of Amleh which show good agreement. Boll, in FE analysis and experimental results, the loss of bond capacity is almost linear with mass loss o f rebar. FE analysis and experimental results show that, up to 5% mass loss, the bond capacity loss is moderate, at 10 to 15 % mass loss, significant amount of bond capacity is lost and at about 20% mass almost all bond capacity is lost.

The model is validated by finite element analysis of the pullout tests, performed by Cabrera and Ghoddoussis (1992) and Al-Sulaimani et al. (1990). The FE results are compared with the experimental results and a good agreement is noted.

6.2 Future Research Work

The future researches can emphasize on the followings;

1. Modeling the effect of corrosion on bond strength of flexural members such as beams.

2. Bridges are mostly deteriorated due to corrosion i The prestressing tendons. Therefore, modeling the bond stress o f corroded prestressiug tendons in prestressed concrete structure is very important. 3. In the current study, the effect of corrosion is modeled by modeling the contact pressure and friction at steel-concrete interface, and modeling the effect o f corrosion on

1 1 0

contact pressure and friction. But the effect of corrosion on crack width is not included. A study should be undertaken to model the crack width at different level of corrosion.

4. As the information is still inadequate on the mechanical behaviour of the corrosive products, it is very difficult to model this phenomenon. As presented by Peter-Lazar and Gerard (2000), there might be possibilities for the rust to fill up the pores of the concrete close to the reinforcing steel, before starting to apply stresses on the structures. It means that the porosity of the concrete is very important on the bond behavoiur. Further efforts can be made on experimental and analytical studies to investigate such bond behaviour.

5. An extensive study is needed to determine the residual bond strength which is very important to determine the remaining service life of deteriorated concrete structures due to corrosion.
