ABSTRACT
Intersection sight distance (ISO) for stop-control intersections refers to the provision of adequate sight distance between a minor-road stopped vehicle and a major-road vehicle. The AASHTO policy for ISO for intersections on straight roadways Is based on the extreme values of the component design variables, such as major-road design speed and time gap, and assumes that these variables are deterministic. This research presents a reliability method that considers the moments (mean and variance) of the probability distribution of each random variable instead of the extreme values. This reliability method also accounts for the correlations among the component random variables. A performance function in terms of a safety margin is defined as the difference between the expected available and expected required ISO. Relationships for the mean and standard deviation of the safety margin are developed using FirstOrder Second-Moment analysis. Design graphs for the obstruction location are established for different radii of horizontal curves, design speed, and probability of failure. The reliability method is very useful as it provides the reliability associated with I8D design values. For evaluation purposes, the method can be used to determine the probability of failure of a particular intersection for an existing obstruction and current traffic conditions. The method can also be used to design the obstruction location for a given probability of failure. It was found that the deterministic method generally provides a higher probability of failure when the obstruction is closer to the minor road.

Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background

Traditionally, geotechnical

reliability (probabilistic) analysis has been used structural or engineering, but not in transportation engineering Highway

geometric design guides, such as the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials AASHTO (2001) and the Transportation Association of Canada TAG (1999), provide the minimum and desirable values of different highway geometric design elements, but do not quantify the reliability level. The design guides work on the assumption that if the recommended design values are correctly applied, the resulting road design would have an adequate margin of safety. This assumption is also accepted by the courts whenever there is a ruling on the designer's liability for vehicular collisions, where road geometry or operation is alleged.

Reliability analysis in transportation engineering uses highway design variables. These variables are mostly random variables. A performance function, in terms of the safety margin, is used to estimate the reliability level. The reliability level for existing conditions and potential improvements is evaluated in terms of the probability of failure. A small probability of failure reflects a h>gh reliability level, and vice versa.

Intersection sight distance (ISD) is one of the most important design aspects of highway geometric design. The intersection sight distance is the distance that provides the driver with an unobstructed view of the entire intersection. It is generally considered that if the sight distance available for turning or crossing vehicle movements is equal to or more than the sight distance required on the major-road, drivers should have sufficient sight distance to avoid a collision.. There is, however, no measure of reliability associated with sight distance evaluation for stop-control intersections at a major-road on a horizontal curve. To

quantify the reliability associated with sight distance for stop-control intersections at a major-road on a horizontal curve; this research developed a reliability model. The following sections discuss various aspects involved in the modelling of intersection sight distance. 1.1.1 intersection An intersection is defined as the general area where two or more roadways intersect or cross. It is an integral and important part of the highway system as the efficiency, safety, cost of operation, maintenance, and the capacity of the highway network depends on the intersection design. From a highway geometric point of view, an intersection is the most sensitive part of the highway since many activities occur at the intersection in a very short period of time.

The selection of an intersection depends on several factors such as highway classification, traffic volume, safety, topography, and highway user benefits. There are three general types of intersections most commonly used in North America; 3-legged, 4-legged, and multi-legged intersections. Different types of intersections given in AASHTO (2001) and TAG (1999) are shown in Figure 1.1.

A 3-legged intersection consists of 3 entry/exits paths. Each path may be twoway or one-way. This type of intersection may be channelized or unchannelized and is generally used where the minor road is connected to the major road. A 4legged intersection is the intersection of two major roads, two minor roads, or one major road and one minor road. This type of intersection consists of four entry/exit paths that may be one way or two ways and may be channelized or unchannelized. The configuration of 4-legged intersection depends on traffic volume, traffic type and topography of the area. A multi-legged intersection has more than 4 legs. It is a very complicated type of intersection and should be avoided if possible.

1.1.2 Intersection Sight Distance The concept of intersection sight distance can be explained from the sight triangle given in Figure 1.2. Each quadrant of an intersection should contain a triangular area free of obstruction that might block an approaching/departing driver's view of potentially conflicting vehicles (AASHTO 2001). One leg of this
1,1

angle is along the minor road while the other is along the major road. There

are two types of sight triangles: approach sight triangle, and departure sight triangle.

For uncontrolled or yield-control intersections, AASHTO (2001) recommends that a clear approach triangle should be provided for an approaching vehicle in order to avoid any conflict. For stop-control intersections, a clear sight triangle

called a departure triangle should be provided on both sides of the minor road. The intersection sight distance in both directions along the major road should be equal to the distance traveled by the major-road vehicle at the design speed, during the time gap required by the minor-road vehicle to manoeuvre safely.

The traffic control provided at any intersection depends on the type of traffic and the location of the intersection. AASHTO (2001) recommends that sight distance requirements at an intersection should be determined according to the type of traffic control used at that intersection. With respect to controls, intersections are generally categorized as: · · · · · · Case A. Intersection with no control Case B. Intersection with stop-control on the minor road Case C. Intersection with yield-control on the minor road Case D. Intersection with traffic signal control Case E. Intersection with all-way stop control Case F. Left turn from the major road

The details of the above categories can be found in AASHTO (2001). Since this research focuses on stop-control intersections (Case B), the procedure for the calculation of sight distance for only this case is described here. At a Case B intersection, a stopped vehicle on the minor road has the following three choices. · · · Case B1. Left turn from the minor road Case B2. Right turn from the minor road Case B3. Crossing manoeuvre from the minor road

For all cases, length of departure sight triangle leg along the major road (left or right) is calculated by multiplying the major-road design speed by the time gap required for the minor-road vehicle. The time gap values depend on the type of minor-road vehicle, the type of manoeuvre, and the number of lanes on the major-road. Note that the time gap values for Case B2 or Case B3 are less than those for Case B1, for all types of vehicles. 1.1.3 Speed Speed is one of the most important factors considered by travelers in selecting alternative routes (AASHTO 2001). The different types of speed used in highway geometric design include design speed, operating speed and posted speed. The design speed is the maximum safe speed that can be maintained over a specified section of highway when conditions are so favourable that the design features of the highway govern (AASHTO 1994). Design speed is a selected speed used to determine the various geometric features of the roadway (AASHTO 2001). The facility should accom m odate nearly all dem ands with reasonable dem ands. adequacy The and should design not collapse coeed of any under extrem e traffic highway should be

operating the ir vehicles during free-flow conditions. Operating speed is less than design speed. The 85^"^ percentile of the distribution of observed speeds is the m ost frequently used measure o f the operating speed associated with a particular location or highway geom etric element. The posted speed is the speed limit, posted on the highway. This speed also entails legal considerations. The posted speed is generally less than the design speed, but operating speeds ma exceed the posted speed. Recent

studies o f National C ooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) report 504 (Fitzpatrick et al. 2003) have shown that the 85^'^ percentile of the operating speed exceeds the posted speed limits and that the 50^

percentile o f the operating speed is closer to or exceeds the posted speed limit.

1.1.4 Tim e Gap A driver stopped on a minor-road approach must observe the gaps in the opposing traffic stream s and determ ine w hether a gap is adequate to com plete a crossing or turning manoeuvre. A fter accepting a gap, the driver can com plete the m anoeuvre safely. Recent research w ork (Harwood et al, 1996) recom m ended time gap values for different type of vehicles. These values are given in AASH TO (2001). Details of the developm ent of tim e gap m odels can be found in the NCHRP report 383 (Harwood et al. 1996).

1.2 Research Problem Statement The design values for ISD analysis of stop-control intersections in AASHTO (2001) and TAG (1999) design guides are based on the extreme values at a certain percentile of the variables involved in the design (deterministic approach). There is no particular criterion to reflect the measure of reliability of ISD especially when the major road has a horizontal curve. It is possible that an existing/proposed obstruction does not satisfy the deterministic design values, but may have a reliability value that is deemed acceptable to the designer.

Hence, it is important to estimate the reliability level in terms of the probability of failure associated w\\h any existing or proposed intersection design associated with any existing or proposed intersection design. 1.3 Research Objectives The objectives of this research are as follows: · To develop a modified deterministic mathematical model for the evaluation of available sight distance at existing/proposed stop-control intersections with a horizontal curve on the major road. · To develop a reliability model to quantify the reliability level of sight distance at stop-control intersections with a horizontal curve on the major road. · To develop design aids to help designers evaluate ISD easily.

e To apply the models developed to actual and hypothetical intersections to illustrate the application of the models.

1.4 Thesis Organization The thesis is organized in 6 chapters. A brief description of each chapter is given Figure 1.3: · Chapter 1 addressed general concepts including intersection types,

intersection sight distance, speed, and time gap. The research problem statement and objectives were also described. · Chapter 2 contains a comprehensive literature review of intersection sight distance based on the deterministic and reliability methods. A description of previous research conducted using reliability analysis in the area of

highway geometric design is also presented. · Chapter 3 provides information about reliability analysis, parameters of reliability analysis (such as mean, variance, variation coefficient, reliability index), and probability of failure. Some important concepts used in reliability analysis are also presented. · Chapter 4 presents the development of modified deterministic and reliability 7

models, guideline for data preparation for the reliability analysis and model verification, sensitivity analysis, comparison of both models developed, and the design aids. · Chapter 5 presents the practical application of the models developed to an actual and hypothetical intersection for illustration. Some suggestions for the improvement of existing ISD are also presented. · Chapter 6 contains conclusions and recommendations for future research. The conclusions are related to features of the model and to the applicability of the models.

Chapter 2: LSTERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Deterministic ISO Models

Intersection sight distance at intersections between minor and major roads is the adequate sight distance that should be provided for vehicles on the minor road. Several ISD determ inistic models have been developed for stop-control and signalized intersections. Most models are based on the minimum sight distance required by AASHTO policy. This sight distance is a function of the major-road design speed and the gap-acceptance time for the minor-road vehicle.

2.1.1 ISO for Stop-Control Intersections Fitzpatrick et al. (1990, 1998) and Harwood et al. (2000) found that the gapacceptance time for the minor-road vehicle depends on the type of minor- road vehicle and the number o f lanes of the major road to be crossed. Gattis et al. (1998) found that if the intersection has an acute angle on the right side of the minor road that can improve the intersection sight distance. But acute angle, on the left side of the minor road may obstruct the minor-road driver's line of sight. Gattis (1992) introduced analytical geometry to determine the intersection sight distance for horizontally curved roadways with tangential intersections and found that this type o f intersection may have inadequate ISD. Easa et al. (2004) presented a three-dimensional model for stop-control intersection sight distance that provides a new idea for the analysis of sight distance for intersections on three-dimensional alignments. The study also considered the surface of the

major-road and off-road obstructions.

2.1.2 ISD for Signalized Intersections

In a study conducted by McCoy et al. (1992, 1997), the authors developed guidelines for offsetting opposing left-turn lanes to eliminate left-turn sight

distance problems. The minimum offsets needed between opposing left-turn lanes to provide adequate sight distance were determined by setting the available sight distance equal to the required sight distance of AASHTO and then solving for the offset. The concept of critical gap across all design speeds depends on the type of vehicle and the number of lanes to be crossed by the left-turn vehicle. It was found that the offset of the opposing left-turn lanes is a function o f the available sight distance.

The offset is the distance from the right-edge of the left-turn lane median to the left-edge of the opposite left-turn vehicle lane line. When the two left-turn lanes are exactly aligned, the offset distance has a value of zero. A negative offset describes the situation where the opposing left-turn lane line is shifted to the left of the inner side left-turn lane median. A positive offset describes the situation where the opposing left-turn lane line is shifted to the right of the inner side of the left-turn lane median as in shown Figure 2.1. The left-turn lanes that are aligned or that have a positive offset provide greater sight distances than those that have a negative offset. A positive offset provides greater sight distance than the aligned left-turn lanes. Easa and All (2004) developed modified guidelines for intersection offsets using the proper location of the point of conflict of the leftturn and opposing through-lane vehicles. Easa et al. (2004) have also extended left-turn sight distance analysis to intersections located on horizontal curves.

2.2 Reliability Analysis in Highway Geometric Design

Reliability analysis is most commonly used in areas of civil engineering such as geotechnica! and structural engineering. A performance function is defined by the difference of the available and the required values of the design variables. The available and the required components can be explained easily by defining a highway system where the driver-vehicle component requires (demands) a specific dimension of the geometric element and the highway geometry provides (supplies) a different dim ension of that com ponent. In the context o f sight

distance, it is always desirable that the "supplied" sight distance should be at least equal to or greater than the required sight distance. W henever the required sight distance exceeds the available sight distance, failure occurs. The probability associated with this failure can be estimated.

The probability o f failure in highway geometric design does not necessarily mean that a collision will occur, but it clearly indicates a potential for a collision. The probability of failure corresponds to the area where the function is negative Figure 2.2. Reliability analysis provides a direct way of measuring safety rather than designing a component using the extreme value of the design variables. The analysis can provide the designers with an estimate of the reliability level that may be useful for safety conscious design procedures. Reliability analysis has been applied to some areas of transportation engineering. The following sections provide a brief literature review of existing applications of reliability analysis in traffic operation and highway geometric design.

2.2.1 Intergreen Interval

A reliability-based approach to the design of intergreen interval at traffic signals was introduced by Easa (1993). His applied probabilistic method considered approach speed, reaction time, deceleration rate, and vehicle length as random variables. A dilemma (failure) zone was explained within which a driver, faced with yellow, could neither stop nor clear the intersection. The research concluded that the intergreen interval based on the probabilistic method may be considerably greater than the deterministic interval. The author also suggested that, unlike the deterministic method, the probabilistic method provides

information on the percentage of drivers with a probability of failure associated with the dilemma zone.

2.2.2 ISD at Intersections

author recognized that the reliability procedure for the three manoeuvres (crossing, turning right, and turning left) of the stopped vehicles is similar, he presented only the procedure for the crossing manoeuvre. AASHTO WB-15 was used as the design vehicle. It was concluded that the current AASHTO design values of ISD appear to have high reliability levels. The author also suggested that the reliability method has the advantage of providing the designer with alternative design values that have a range of reliability levels. Thus, a designer can design a new intersection based on a specific reliability level or can estimate the reliability for an existing obstruction and evaluate necessary improvements.

Easa and Hussain (2004) have also developed a new probabilistic approach to evaluate offset requirements for left-turn vehicles at signalized intersections with four-lane divided major roads. It was found that the deterministic method provides higher reliability at lower design speeds, but that the reliability level decreases with an increase in speed along the major road. It was recommended that the reliability index should be carefully examined for high-speed major roads.

2.2.3 Design Consistency

Hirsh

Moshe

(1987) applied the

reliability approach to evaluate design

consistency in geometric design for horizontal curves. The researcher showed that the design consistency method based on comparing two speed distributions (for tangent and horizontal curve sections) does not give the full picture of all the speed changes that the drivers incur. In the extreme case, it is argued that theoretically, even when the two distributions are identical, it is still possible that each driver might experience a speed change. Hence it was proposed to obtain and analyze the distribution of the speed differences within the same section. A simulation method of reliability analysis was compared with the desired speed distribution at the tangent section, using a dataset of mean speeds

corresponding to various curve radii and, then, the distributions were plotted for the simulated data to determine the mean speed of the different radii of

horizontal curve, it was shown that the existing approach was likely to underestimate the amount of speed changes, and hence, was prone to accept inconsistent designs as consistent. The proposed approach was theoretical due to lack of data and hence, there were no practical applications presented in this research.

2.2.4 ISD at Railroad Crossings

Easa (1994) introduced reliability analysis for sight distance studies at railroad crossings. In this research, two cases were considered; ( 1 ) sight distance required along the highway and the railroad for an approaching vehicle and (2 ) sight distance required along the railroad for a stopped vehicle. The probabilistic method used was based on the first-order second moment (FOSM) of reliability analysis. Case 1 was modeled as a system with two parallel components. The probabilities of failures of each component and of the system were developed. Case 2 was modeled as a single-component system, and a design graph for the sight distance required along the railroad was presented. The normality assumption of the safety margin used in the reliability analysis was confirmed using Monte Carlo simulation.

2.2.5 Geometric Elements

Navin (1990) calculated the safety factor of isolated highway geometric design elements such as stopping sight distance, horizontal curves, decision sight distance, passing sight distance, and vertical curves. The reliability levels were calculated using the FOSM method at low and high values of the component design variables recommend by various design guides. It was concluded that the results based on preliminary data indicate that the safety index is the most meaningful safety measure of road design. Navin et al. (1998) applied the reliability approach to highway geometric design in relation to vehicle dynamics and driver expectation. The approach requires that designers explicitly input the

mean and variance of the design variables and incorporate the dynamic features of the driver, vehicle, and roadway. The authors indicated that the methodology encourages designers to be more aware of the link between driver-vehicle-road and that the methodology should lead to a more safety conscious design. The additional burden on the designer is the need for more information and more analysis.

Chapter 3: RELIABILITY APPROACH
3.1 Introduction In general, any engineering design consists of a balanced system of elements that satisfies various criteria of serviceability, durability, performance, and safety based on the demands made on the design. For example, a structure should be strong enough to resist all types of expected loadings. There are always uncertainties in the design depending on the variables involved. Reliability analysis is used to identify and quantify the uncertainties in a system design. .

The reliability level of any designed system cannot be established using a deterministic approach even though the design must involve a known and agreed safety margin. Instead, reliability analysis is based on a probabilistic approach that defines reliability in terms of the probability of failure. In the deterministic approach, the system is designed using extreme values of the system's components design variables but, in the probabilistic approach, the system is designed using probability distributions of the system's component variables. The following sections present information about the parameters of reliability analysis, existing reliability methods, and several important concepts used in reliability approach.

3.2 Parameters of Reliability Analysis

Any physical quantity that does not have a fixed numerical value is called a variable. A variable that can have any of a range of values that are equally likely to occur but can be described probabilistically is known as a random variable. In analytical models, variables are accounted for and it is assumed that the processes are uniformly distributed. Any random variable Y can be expressed as a function which assumes the values in the interval (- oo, oo). The assumed value of a random variable is unpredictable and dependent on some chance system. Random variables are used in simulation techniques and their interactions also

influence the results of the system. The parameters of a random variable include the mean, variance, correlation coefficient, and co e fficie n t of variation.

The mean is the arithmetic average of any dataset. It can be obtained by summing up all dataset values and dividing the sum by the number of values. In statistics, the mean is a measure of the center of any distribution. The variance is the arithmetic average of the squared differences between the values and the mean value. The variance is a measure of the degree of dispersion of the dataset values around the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

The interrelation between random variables is called the correlation of random variables. Let X and Y be two random variables. Mathematically, the correlation between the two random variables is measured by the coefficient of correlation as given below:

,, =

O' y ex y

(3.1)

where ctx and ay are the standard deviations of the random variables X and Y. The value of the correlation coefficient ranges from - 1 to + 1. A relationship in which the values of two variables increase or decrease together is called a positive correlation and vice versa when the value of one variable increases as the value of the other variable decreases. The two random variables can be considered to be statistically independent if the correlation coefficient is less than ±0.3; they can be considered to be perfectly correlated if the correlation coefficient is greater than ±0.9 (Haidar et al, 2000). An intermediate value of 0.5 is normally used for analysis purposes.

The variation coefficient (CV) is a relative measure of data dispersion compared to mean. This can be explained by taking the ratio of the standard deviation and

the mean and this can be expressed as

C% /=--

(3.2)

where a and p are the standard deviation and mean respectively of the dataset selected. CV has no units. It may be reported as decimal values or as a percentage. If the standard deviation of a dataset is very small, the values are closely bunched with a very small variation coefficient. If the standard deviation of a dataset is high, the values are scattered and give a high value for the coefficient of variation. For example, for p = 20 and a = 10, CV will be 0.5 or 50% which means that there is a huge dispersion of data compared to the mean values. If p = 100 and a = 2, CV will be 0.02 or 2% which means that there is very little dispersion of the data compared to the mean values. In many engineering problems, a CV of 0.1 to 0.3 is commonly used for a random variable (Haidar et al. 2000).

3.3 Existing Reliability Methods

Various methods have been proposed in order to measure the reliability of any design. Current reliability methods are classified into three groups: the exact reliability method, the point-estimate method, and the first-order second-moment method.

3.3.1 Exact Reliability Method The exact reliability method requires full probability distributions for all the variables involved. This method may use analytical, numerical, or simulation techniques and is used where the probability of failure is of critical importance.. The method is very difficult to use due to the nonlinear behaviour of performance functions in engineering systems, but it is widely used in structural and geotechnical engineering. 19

3.3.2 Point-Estimate Method

The point-estimate method is used when the performance functions are available in the form of charts or as finite-eiement solutions. This method can account for up to three central moments (mean value, standard deviation, and skewness). The method is used when the reliability analysis concerns

unbiasedness, efficiency, sufficiency, and consistency of the random variable. Rosenblueth (1975) developed a point-estimate method which is still in practice for approximating the low-order moments of a function of random variables.

3.3.3 First-Order Second-Moment Method (FOSM)

The first-order second-moment method (FOSM) is very simple and consists of straightforward mathematical techniques. It is based on the truncated Taylor's expansion series. FOSM requires the mean and variance of the random variables. It requires only an approximation of the first two moments (expected value and variance) of a random variable as a non-linear function of other random variables.

The FOSM method is widely used in almost all types of engineering fields and now appears to be recognized as an important tool in transportation engineering. Failure in branches of civil engineering, such as structural and geotechnical engineering, may have catastrophic consequences in which case the FOSM approach may be inappropriate. In highway geometric design, where the probability of failure does not necessarily mean a collision will occur, the relatively higher values of the probability of failure may be acceptable. As the FOSM method was used in the current research, it is useful to describe the method before presenting the ISD reliability analysis.

Suppose that Z is a non-linear function of several random variables:

The preceding analysis does not require any assumptions about the form of the probability distributions of the variables. In addition, the analysis does not rely on any specific percentile values of the component variables, but only on the moments of their probability of distributions (mean and standard deviation).

3.4 Important Concepts 3.4.1 Safety Margin The idea of the safety margin can be best explained by a simple example of supply and demand for any entity. Supply is that which is provided and demand is that which is required. The difference between the supply and demand is called the safety margin. If the supply is more than the demand, the safety margin will be positive but if the supply is less than the demand, then the safety

margin will be negative. Let Da be the supply and Dr be the demand. The difference between Dg and Dr, is the safety margin F, which is given by

= D , --D r

(3 S»a)

If Dg and Dr are statistically independent random variables, i.e. there is no correlation between Dg and Dr. The expected value of F is given by

(3.10)

and the standard deviation of F is given by

cr,, = ^Var[D^ J+ Var[D, j

(3.11)

3.4.2 R e lia b ility Index

The ratio between the expected value of the safety margin, E[F] and the standard deviation of the safety margin is commonly known as the safety

index or reliability index, denoted by p.Since the safety margin is afunction of many random variables, itsdistribution tends to be normal even if the

component variables are not normal (Ang et al. 1975 and Haidar et al. 2000). The distribution of the safety margin is shown in Figure 3.1.The reliability index is given by

=

cr,..

From the Equation (3.13) above, it can be noted that the reliability index value is directly proportional to the expected value of the safety margin and inversely proportional to the square root of its variance. In other words, we can say that the reliability index of the safety margin is inversely proportional to its variation coefficient.

3.4.3 Probability o f Failure

When the expected demand is greater than the expected supply, then a relatively high probability of failure exists, in Figure 3.1, the shaded area represents the probability o f failure where F < 0. A large value of (3 indicates that the probability o f failure is small. The estimate of the probability of failure for a normal random variable F, is as follows

where <f>(p) is the area under the probability density function of the standard normal variate from - co to - p. This area can be obtained from tables of the standard normal variate. Substituting for p in Equation (3.14) from Equation (3.13), the probability of failure can be expressed as:

jF » =1

(3.15) ^V ar[D ^\+V ar{D ,\

For the positive values of p, the probability of failure will be less than 50% and vice versa for negative values of p. It is to be noted that the probability of failure using Equation (3.15) assumes that the random variables Dg and Dr are statically independent. This assumption is valid since Dg and Dr do not have correlated random variables.

Chapter 4: DEVELOPMENT OF RELIABILITY-BASED ISD MODEL
4.1 Introduction

Two models were developed: (1) a modified deterministic model for calculating available sight distance, and (2 ) a probabilistic model fo r quantifying the reliability level of ISD. Both models assume that the major road has a horizontal curve and that the intersection angle is 90°. The models are directly applicable to existing or proposed intersections.

The modified deterministic method was developed using analytical geometry and extreme values for all variables. Available sight distance was calculated and compared with the required sight distance to determine the lateral clearance needed for the obstruction. The FOSM method was then applied to develop a reliability model. The dataset used for the modified deterministic and the reliability models was taken from existing research. Using the modified

deterministic and reliability models developed, design aids were established to facilitate the design and evaluation of ISD at proposed and existing intersections. The following sections present the model development, verification and

sensitivity analysis.

The calculation for the m inim um radius of the m ajor road horizontal curve is directly proportional to the square of the design speed and inversely proportional to

4.4 Modelling Using Reliability Analysis The FOSM method requires two moments (mean and variance) as described already in Chapter 3. In the reliability analysis, it is important to determine the random variables. The proposed model involves the following random variables: · · · Vehicle width (Vw) Distance between the driver's eye and the front of the minor-road vehicle (Yp) Distance between the driver's eye and the left side of the minor-road vehicle
(Y i)

· ·

Distance between left side of the vehicle and the right side of the lane line (Y J Distance between the front of minor-road vehicle and the edge of the major road pavement (D)

4.4.6 Guideline for Data Preparation

The FOSM method used for reliability analysis in this research requires data based on the two moments (mean and variance). Some guidelines for data preparation were developed for use in the proposed analysis. Suppose that there are `n' types of vehicles using a particular intersection. Let a given random variable (e.g. vehicle width) be denoted by R. The percentage frequencies of all types of vehicles are fi, fa, ..., fp where
(=1 1 0 0

and the corresponding

values of the vehicle widths are Ri, Ra, .... Rn- Then the mean and the standard deviation of R, {R andcr^j) are given by

(4.31)

(4.32)
n - 1

The reliability method requires data on the means, variances, and correlations of various random variables. The means and standard deviations can be

determined through

observations at the

intersection

being analyzed. To

determine the mean of other random variables, extreme values with respect to the percentile values can be used. Assuming that the random variables are

39

Ronmrll IP .fiH \A /ith normîccinn nf thû onrw/rinht

Piirthzir rzin rn W i i/^tlr\n

it

normally distributed, the relationship between the mean and extreme values is given by

(1 + ZCF,,)

where pxi = mean value of random variable Xi, Exi = extreme value of random variable corresponding to a certain percentile value, Z = number of standard deviations of the normal distribution corresponding to a certain percentile value, and CVxi = co-efficient of variation of random variable Xi.

Note that Z is positive (negative) for variables for which the extreme values are based on a high (low) percentile value. For example, the Z value of any random variable with respect to the 95^'^ percentile value will be 1.64 and the percentile value for the same random variable will be -1 .6 4 . For large values of the standard normal variate, tables of the normal distribution do not provide the area under the distribution for the fine values of the variate. The following leastsquares approximation can be used (Easa 1992).

4.5 Model Verification 4.5.1 Verification of modified Deterministic Model The modified deterministic model developed in this research was verified graphically using AUTOCAD, and mathematically using ISO values of AASHTO (2001), for the straight intersections. The values of Rn and Y were computed by using Equation (4.9) and (4.15), as 197.29 m and 6.29 m respectively. For the

graphical verification, an on scale arc of radius 197.29 m and a line crossing through the center of the circle were drawn. The arc showed the moving path of a major-road vehicle approaching from the left side. The vertical line represented the minor-road vehicle path. The observer was placed on the minor road 6.29 m from the moving path of the major-road vehicle. The object location was found from the following relationship:

where Sr = 125.1 m using Equation (4.20) for Vmaj = 60 km/h and Tg = 7.5 sec (passenger car).

The central angle between the minor-road driver's eye and the object was calculated using Equation (4.36) as 0.6341 radians. Other geometric data were used from Table 4.3. A line of sight was established between the object and the observer.

An obstruction was placed anywhere on the line of sight. The values of m 2 and m i were measured graphically. The value of m 2 was inputted to the software developed in Microsoft Excel and the value of mi was determined by iteration for the condition Sr - Sa = 0. The graphical values were compared with those obtained analytically. The graphical and analytical results were identical. For the mathematical verification, the required sight distance was calculated using Equation (4.20) as 166.8m, for major-road design speed of 80 km/h and a minor-road stopped vehicle (passenger car). A departure triangle was made for a vehicle approaching from the left whose leg length along the major road was 166.8 m and whose leg length along the m inor road was 6.29 m.

An obstruction was placed at m 2 = 20 m.

The value of M 2 = 24.743 m was

computed using Equation (4.13). By interpolating, the value of Mi was calculated

41

as 5.357 m and from Equation (4.11), the value of mi was determined to be 4.667 m.

In the modified deterministic model, a very large radius of 1x10^ m was used. This made the major-road horizontal curve virtually flat. The value of m 2 = 20 m was input, and mi = 4.671 m was calculated using the "Solver" tool of Excel for the condition of Sr - Sa = 0. The results showed that the model added 0.08% to the value of mi which is negligible. This shows that the mathematical model was working well.

4.5.2 Verification of Reliability Model

The reliability model developed in this research is based on the modified deterministic method which was verified in the preceding section. In the reliability analysis, the variation coefficient is an important parameter for expressing the relative measure of dispersion of the data around the mean value. The details of the variation coefficient were discussed in Chapter 3.

For the specific dataset of Tables 4.3 and 4.5, design graphs illustrated a specific design speed of 60 km/h and probability of failure 5%, CV = 5% and 1%, Figures 4.3-4.4. The graphs show that by decreasing the CV of all random variables, the results calculated by the reliability model are, as expected, getting closer to the results calculated by the deterministic model. The results also

show that for the case when CV = 0, the values of all variables approach the extreme values and correspond to the modified deterministic model, Figure 4.5.

4.6 S ensitivity A nalysis and C om parison of Models 4.6.1 S en sitivity A nalysis of Random V ariables A sensitivity analysis was performed to check the effect of the variations in the random variables on the obstruction location, m i and m 2 . This analysis also

provides information about the importance of the random variables. The base case used for the sensitivity analysis with m2 =
8

m, CV = 10% for all random

variables, Pvwyl= 0.5, pvwvi = 0.5, and Pf = 5% (Table 4.5).

For the sensitivity analysis, three groups of design speeds were selected; 40 km/h, 60 km/h, and 100 km/h. The effects of a 20% increase in the mean value of each random variable were computed and are shown in Tables 4.6 - 4.8. These tables show that as the mean values of the random variables increase, the mi increases. The most sensitive random variables are major-road speed and the time gap, distance between the front of minor-road vehicle and the edge of the major road, distance between the minor-road driver eye and the front of vehicle, vehicle width, and distance between left side of the vehicle and the right side of the lane line. The most sensitive random variable is distance between the minor-road driver eye and the left side of the vehicle. At lower major-road speeds, the effect of the increase in the mean values is greater as compared with higher speeds.

The results of the sensitivity analysis of the variation coefficient of all random variables to mi are shown in Table 4.9. The effect of the variation coefficient of the major-road speed only (keeping CV constant for all other random variables) were also examined (Table 4.10). The results indicate that by decreasing the variation coefficient of all random variables, the corresponding value of mi increases, and vice versa. Similar effects were found by varying the variation coefficient of speed only. The effect of the variation coefficient on mi decreases as the radius increases. The effect of the correlation coefficients P vw V L and pvwvi t on mi is shown in Table 4.11. As the sensitivity analysis for the correlation coefficient indicated that mi is quite insensitive to the correlation coefficients, intermediate values of the correlation coefficient may be used.

4.6.2 Comparison between Modified Deterministic and Reliability Models

A

hypothetical example was used for the comparison of the

modified

deterministic and reliability models. The data used were: R = 400 m, Vmaj= 60 km/h, Tg = 7.5 sec (passenger car), and CV = 10%. The values of the other variables and random variables were those shown in Tables 4.3 and 4.5. Probability of failures of 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10% and 20% were used for illustration.

The values of the modified deterministic model were very close to Pf = 0.1% at all radii. It was interesting, however, that for values of mz of less than
1 0

m, the

deterministic curve was closer to Pf = 1% for almost all radii,. This implies that the values obtained from the modified deterministic model exhibit a higher probability of failure when the obstruction is closer to the observer. Figure 4.6 compares the modified deterministic and reliability models at different

probabilities of failure.

4.7 Establishing Design Graphs

4.7.1 Design graphs of Modified Deterministic Model

Since stop-control intersections are likely to exist on 2-lane rural and urban highways, both the major and minor roads are assumed to be
2

-lane roadways.

It is also assumed that the minor road has no skew or grade, Figure 4.2. The vehicle width (passenger car) was obtained from AASHTO (2001) and the values of the other variables were obtained from the literature. The database used to illustrate the design graphs is presented in Table 4.3 for a major road with a horizontal curve and for a minor road with level grade. The radii of curvature were selected using the criteria provided in AASHTO (2001), as shown in Table 4.1. The variables used for a typical intersection are; Major-road lane width, Lwmaj= 3.6 m Minor-road lane width, Lwm in = 3.6 m Major-road width, Wmaj = 7.2 m Minor-road width, Wmin = 7.2 m Number of lanes on the major road, n = 2 Distance from edge of the major road to the front of the minor-road vehicle, D --3 m.

The extreme values of the random variables used in the analysis are, Vw = 2.1 m, Yp = 2.4 m, Yj = 0.533 m, Y l = 0.61 m, Tg = 7.5 sec (passenger car) and D = 3 m. Substituting the above values in Equation (4.19), a simple form of this equation is obtained as

Here Vmaj. Tg, R, are the input variables to determine the mi or m 2 . For a given design speed and radius of the curvature, mi or m 2 were calculated by inputting one of them in Equation (4.38). A working sheet was prepared in Excel and tool "Solver" was used for iterations to determine the values of mi for respective values of m 2 for the condition Sg- Sr = 0. For a specific radius and design speed.

by inputting m2 values, the corresponding mi values were computed and the design graphs were developed. The design graphs based on the modified deterministic method are shown in Appendix C, Figures C4.1-C4.4. The graphs provide the mi on (y-axis) corresponding to m 2 on (x-axis). Each graph represents the mi and m2 for a set of R = 200 m, 400 m, 600 m and 800 m, at a given design speed. It should be noted that the graphs are shown for major-road design speeds of 40 km/h, 60 km/h, 80 km/h and 100 km/h. For a particular design speed and radius of horizontal curve, if mi (m2 ) is known, it may be plotted on the corresponding graph so that the minimum value of m2 (mi) can be determined. Note that for flat horizontal curves with radii greater than 200 m, the rate of increase in mi is likely to decrease with the increase in m 2 especially at lower speeds. A negative slope of the curve in the design graph indicates that the closer corner of obstruction to the minor-road vehicle controls, and vice versa when the farther corner of obstruction controls.

4.7.2 Data used fo r Reliability Analysis The means and standard deviations of the random variables can be determined through observations at the intersection being analyzed. For analysis purposes, extreme values with respect to the percentile values of the random variables were used to determine the mean values, assuming that all random variables were normally distributed. The mean values were determined from Equation (4.33). The standard deviations were calculated by using Equation (3.9).

The extreme values of the random variables are Vw = 2.1 m (99*^ percentile, Z =2.32), Yp = 2.4 m (85^"^ percentile, Z = 1.013), Y| = 0.533 m (99th percentile, Z = 2.32), Y l = 0.61 m (95th percentile, Z = 1.64), D = 3.0 m (85th percentile, Z = 1.013), Tg = 7.5 sec. (85"^ percentile, Z = 1.013). pvwYL = pvwvi = 0.5. The mean and the standard deviation of the major-road speed were computed assuming

4.7.3 Design Graphs of Reliability Analysis Table 4.4 shows the values of the reliability index corresponding to the probability of failure used in the analysis. Intermediate correlation coefficient values of 0.5 were used.

The model could not be shown in closed form due to the very long equations. A computer program was developed in Excel. For a specified design speed, radius, variation coefficient of all variables, probability of failure and ms, the

Design graphs were developed for m 2 on the x-axis and mi on the y-axis for different design speeds, CV, and probabilities of failure.

Figures D4.1 - D4.8 correspond to Pf = 0.1%, Figures D4.9 - 04.16 correspond to Pf = 1%, Figures 04.17 - 04.24 correspond to Pf = 5%, and Figures 04.25-0 4.32 correspond to Pf = 10%. CV = 5% and CV = 10% were used for each set of design speeds and probability of failure. The radius of 100 m was included only in the design graphs with design speed of 40 km/h.

Note that for the lowest probability of failures, mi increases with the increase in the variation coefficient of all random variables, but that for the higher probability of failure (e.g. 5% or greater), mi decreases with the increase in the variation coefficient of all random variables. The design graphs are very easy to use and can be used to analyze an existing or proposed intersection.

C h a p te r 5: PRACTICAL APPLICATION
The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate the application of the modified deterministic and reliability models. An actual intersection, located in the City of Toronto (Dundas Street and Pembroke Street), was used for this purpose. In addition, a hypothetical example was used to illustrate the use of the developed design aids.

5.1 Actual Intersection

It is important to mention here that the intersection of Dundas Street (major-road) and Pembroke Street (minor-road) is not directly applicable to the developed models as the Pembroke Street operates one-way only (southbound), which means that the vehicles on the minor-road travel towards the center of the horizontal curve and therefore, the obstruction is critical for the minor-road vehicle on the outside of the curve. For the purpose of illustration, it was assumed that the traffic on the Pembroke Street is not restricted to one-way. The reliability of the intersection was evaluated for the vehicle on the inside of the horizontal curve

5.1.1 Intersection Geometry

At the intersection of Dundas and Pembroke, Dundas, the major road, is a fourlane undivided highway (East-West bound) and Pembroke, the minor road, is a two-lane undivided residential street (North-South bound). There is a pedestrian crossing with mounted flashers at a mid block location on the major road near the intersection. It should be noted that street cars run in the central two lanes of the major road. As shown in Figure 5.1, the major-road has a horizontal curve right on the intersection. Although a little skew is present at the location, it was assumed for simplicity that the skew is zero. It was also assumed that there was no slope on the major or minor road. Some geometric variables were measured

Details of the geometric input data are given in Table 5.1. Note that this intersection has typical road widths (3.6 m for the minor and major road). The following sections present the procedure followed by the analysis in detail.

5.1.2 Model Application

5.1.2.1 Modified Deterministic Model
The radius of the horizontal curve (centerline of the major road) was taken as the average of the radii of curves along internal and external edges of the major road (i.e. (152.40 + 132.26)/2 = 142.33 m). To determine the available sight distance, the calculations are shown for two cases; vehicle approach from the left side and vehicle approach from the right side. For a vehicle approaching from the left, using Equations (4.9), (4.11), (4.13), and (4.15), Rn, Mi, M2 , and Y are calculated as:

Rn = 142.33 - 0.5

X

14.40 + 3.6 - 0.61-2.1 = 136.02 m

mi = (20.14-1 4 .4 )/2 = 2.87 m

Mi = 2.87 + 3.6 - 0.61-2.1 = 3.76 m

mz = (2 0.10-7 .2)/2 = 6.45 m

M2 = 6 .4 5 + 0 . 5 x 7 . 2 + 0.61+ .533= 11.193 m

The above calculations show that the available sight distance is less than the required sight distance in both cases, i.e. the sightline to the object is obstructed. The results also confirmed our expectation that the critical case occurs when the major-road vehicle is approaching from the left. The big difference between the Sa from the left and the Sa from the right, might be due to skew on the left of the intersection, it should be noted that the above calculations are based on the extreme values. It might be possible that the above design has a reliability value that is acceptable to the designer.

The following section describes the procedure for quantifying the reliability level of the existing design of the intersection. The reliability model is applied only to the critical case, the approaching vehicle from the left.

5.2 Results and Discussion

The results obtained from the modified deterministic method show that the available sight distance is not adequate at the modelled intersection for the minor-road vehicle on the inside of the curve. As the probability of failure for the vehicle approaching from the left is very large, it would be appropriate to conclude that the intersection does not fulfill minimum sight distance

requirements for vehicles approaching from the left or right. The results also indicate that two-way operation of Pembroke Street at Dundas Street is not advisable due to the existing ISO constraint.

To

improve

the

sight distance

at the

intersection,

using

the

modified

deterministic model, for the existing value of mi = 2.87 m, mg = 62.62 m is required but the existing m 2 is only 6.45 m. As the intersection is located in a developed area and it is not possible to increase m 2 ,. Another way to improve the sight distance is to keep the m 2 fixed and change mi. For the existing m 2 = 6.45 m, the minimum required mi is 7.55 m, an increase of 4.68 m. Therefore changing the mi might be possible at this location.

Using the reliability model Figure 04.29, for a radius of 142.33 m, the values of mi are in the range of 5.84 - 6.74 m and in the range of 0 - 20 m for m 2 ,. Assuming that m 2 will be fixed at 6.45 m, the required value of mi will be approximately to 6.40 m for Pf = 10%. For a higher probability of failure, for example Pf = 20%, mi are in the range of 5.65 -6. 18 m, for m 2 in the range of 0 20 m and, for the fixed value of m 2 = 6.45 m, the required mi is approximately to 6.11 m. A design with a higher probability of failure would require less value of mi.

U îf 5.3 Hypothetical Example

A hypothetical example was used to illustrate the application of the model using the design aids. A hypothetical intersection is located in a rural setting. The major and minor roads are two-lane roadways with lane widths of 3.6 m each. There is a horizontal curve of radius 400 m on the major road at the intersection. The major-road design speed is 60 km/h. An obstruction is located on the inside of the horizontal curve to the left of the minor road. The far corner of the obstruction is at a distance of m 2 =
8 .1

m from the edge of the minor road and at

a distance of mi = 6.05 m from the inner edge of the major road. The location of the obstruction is being questioned by the authorities due to the increasing number of collisions at the intersection. The designer argues that he used graphical techniques to establish sightlines and insists that the sightlines are unobstructed, but he does not have a quantifiable measure to substantiate his argument. A senior designer suggests that a reliability analysis should be carried out at the location to estimate the reliability level of the intersection sight distance at the intersection.

Using the modified deterministic model, from Figure C4.2, for m 2 = 8.1 m, required m i is 6.57 m. The required mi is less than the current m i at the location, but the difference is small (0.52 m). Using the reliability model and assuming CV = 10%, from Figure D4.25 the probability of failure of this intersection is estimated to be approximately 5% or less. As a probability of failure of 5% is deemed acceptable in geometric design, it might not be appropriate to suggest that the designer placed the obstruction incorrectly.

Chapter 6: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 Conclusions

This thesis has presented a new reliability model for the analysis of sight distance at stop-control intersections with horizontal curves on major roads. It was assumed that the minor road has no skew and zero grades. Graphical design aids, which are easy to use, were developed to determine the obstruction location for different probabilities of failure, design speeds, and curve radii. Based on the research, the following comments are offered; 1. The reliability model developed in this research is simple and

straightforward. It requires only the means and standard deviations of the random variables. The reliability level is defined in terms of a reliability index and the probability of failure is related to the reliability level. A small probability of failure reflects a high reliability level, and vice versa. 2. The reliability model presented in this thesis can be used to determine the reliability level (probability of failure) of sight distance for stop-control intersections. The results show that the deterministic model generally produces higher probabilities of failure when the obstruction is closer to the minor road. 3. The reliability model may also be useful in defining different levels of safety for intersections with respect to the reliability level. For example, high-speed intersections may be designed with higher reliability levels, and vice versa for low-speed intersections. 4. Using the design aids established in this thesis, the probability of failure of any stop-control intersection (existing or proposed) can be easily

determined using the major-road design speed, horizontal curve radius, and obstruction location. In addition, for a desired probability of failure, the obstruction location can be determined. If an existing intersection does not satisfy sight distance requirements, the proposed reliability model can be

used to estimate the existing reliability level and to recommend necessary improvements. 5. The design aids in this research were established for the case of a left-turn of a minor-road stopped vehicle. For the case of a right-turn and for crossing manoeuvres, the model presented will provide conservative obstruction clearance values with less probabilities of failure.
6

.

The sensitivity analysis of the reliability model shows that the most sensitive random variables are major-road speed, vehicle characteristics, and time gap of the minor-road vehicle. The sensitivity to the obstruction clearances decreases with the increase in radius of curvature. The sensitivity analysis for mean values of the random variables also shows that mean of vehicle width is less sensitive to the obstruction clearance values, so the model is also applicable to the ISD of truck traffic.

6.2

Recommendations

Areas proposed for future research include the following: 1. The reliability model presented in this research covers only one situation (stop-control intersection, where the obstruction is inside the horizontal curve).The model should be extended to include situations where the obstruction is outside the horizontal alignment. 2. The model considers only horizontal alignments on the major road. It was also assumed that the minor road has a zero grade and no skew. This model should be extended to include three-dimensional intersections that have both horizontal and vertical alignments on the major road and to include cases where the minor road has a skew and a grade. 3. This research should be extended to include other cases of intersection sight distance presented in AASHTO. A comprehensive research is also required to establish a database that can provide information about the statistical nature and distributions of the various variables used in

APPENDIX B: First Derivative of The Random Variables
The first derivatives of E[Sg], Equation (4.21) with respect to the random variables , Vw, Y l, Yj, Yp and D, were computed using Mathematics, a powerful mathematical software package. The results involved in very long equations and all could not be included in this thesis. Only one is being placed here as a sample. Software can not accept all types of alpha and numeric values due to some limitations. Original variables were replaced by some single word, and are shown in Table below:
