Abstract
A Computational Study o f Structure Development and Texture Formation in Carbonaceous Mesophase Fibers

Master of Applied Science

2004 Shujuan Hong

Chemical Engineering Ryerson University

In this thesis, thermal relaxation phenomena after the melt-extrusion of a rigid discotic uniaxial nematic mesophase pitch were studied using mathematical modeling and computer simulation. The Ericksen and Landau-de Gennes continuum theories were used to investigate the structure development and texture formation across mesophase pitch based carbon fibers.

It is found that during the thermal relaxation, discotic nematic molecules stored elastic fine energy decays. The distorted nematic molecular profile reoriented to release the

stored elastic free energy. The difference in time scales for molecular reorientation and thermal relaxation resulted in different transverse textures. The rate at which the fibers are cooled is the main factor in controlling the structure development. A slow cooling rate would permit nematic discotic molecules to reorient to a well developed (radial or onion) texture. The random texture is a result o f rapid quenching. The numerical results are consistent with published experimental observations.

Chapter 1

General Introduction
In this chapter, carbon fibers formation, structure and specific properties are briefly introduced. This is followed by a description o f the thesis objectives, thesis outline and methodology of the thesis development.

1.1

Introduction to Carbon Fibers

Carbon fiber is a new class o f advanced engineering material, which consists o f 90 to 100 percent carbon content, with imperfect graphite crystalline or amorphous structure arranged along the fiber axis [1]. Because o f their lightweight, high strength, high

modulus and stiffness, carbon fibers are used in many high demand applications ranging from the aerospace industry to sporting goods. The excellent mechanical and transport properties o f carbon fibers originate from the molecular structure. The three most commonly used precursors to produce carbon fibers are viscous rayon, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and petroleum or coal tar pitch [1,2]. The first commercialized rayon-based carbon fibers have been phased out due to the low yield and high cost of stabilization and high temperature heat treatment under high tension. Presently, the

majority o f carbon fiber is produced from PAN or mesophase pitch (MP) through filament spinning and post treatment processes.

PAN-based carbon fibers contain folded and interlinked fibril structure with no regular tliree-dimensional order [3]. The fibrillar structure gives this kind o f carbon fiber high tensile and compressional strength. High strength PAN-based carbon fibers are usually used as hybrid composite with other materials, such as polymers, plastics, metals, and

even cement. PAN-based carbon fiber reinforced composites are widely used in the main structure o f military combat aircrafts, missiles, spacecraft and passenger airplanes. In contrast, mesophase pitch based carbon fibers possess high degree o f order both in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the fiber axis. The ordered structure gives

mesophase pitch based carbon fibers high modulus and excellent transport properties such as thermal and electrical conductivities. High performance carbon fibers made fiom mesophase pitch have modulus up to 1000 GPa and thermal conductivity 3 times that of copper [4]. High modulus mesophase pitch based carbon fibers are mainly used in

engineering applications, such as the aerospace industry. Because o f the high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion, this class of carbon fibers is also being developed for applications where heat transfer is critical, such as brakes and engine rotating blades [5]. To provide some comparative information. Table 1.1 compares the properties of PAN based and mesophase pitch based carbon fibers, and Table 1.2 shows applications and characteristics o f carbon fibers.

Mesophase Pitch Based Carbon Fibers

Nowadays researchers and industry are more interested in the mesophase pitch based carbon fibers. Compared with PAN-based carbon fiber, mesophase pitch based carbon fibers have the following advantages: (1) Lower cost o f raw materials ($0.25/kg comp ured to $0.90/kg for PAN) [6]; (2) Higher yield (80% compared to 40-45% for PAN) [2]; (3) Superior mechanical, thermal and electrical properties if produced

properly [2]; and (4) The most important characteristic of the mesophase pitch material is its structure can be controlled by manipulating the material properties and melt spinning parameters. The process o f producing mesophase pitch based carbon fibers begins with pitch being converted into liquid crystalline state through thermal treatment, then extruded using a melt spinning process followed by a series of post treatment specifically named as stabilization, carbonization and graphitization.

1.3

Mesophase Pitch Based Carbon Fibers Structure Formation

High performance mesophase pitch based carbon fibers consist o f nematic discotic molecules that can be aligned in certain directions to form an ordered structure. Studies show that fiber structure is generated during the melt spinning process. Successful

manufacturing o f high performance carbon fiber from mesophase pitch depends on the control of texture formation, i.e., molecular orientation. The different orientations o f the discotic molecules give rise to various ordered cross-sectional textures. The most

commonly observed are random, zigzagged radial, radial, quasi-onion, and onion textures [1-3]. The structure formation is a comprehensive process involving mode (radial or onion) selection and the degree o f molecule orientation evolution.

1.3.1

Mode Selection

The mesophase pitch based carbon fibers structure formation results from the application o f a series o f extremely complex stress and thermal fields on a textured anisotropic viscoelastic material. Previous work [7-9] indicated that the mode selection between

radial and onion is controlled by the spinning temperature, pitch structure and its anchoring behaviours, and the dimensions o f the spinnerets. Mochida et al [10] and Ogale et a/ [11] observed that higher spinning temperature tend to form an onion texture; lower spinning temperature favors a radial texture. An intermediate temperature would produce fibers with a random texture. Matsumoto [12] and Hamada et a/ [13] formed the onion concentric texture by stirring the upstream pitch melt and using a capillary with large diameter.

1.3.2

Structure Development

Melt spinning is a complex non-isothermal process involving uniaxial flow, cooling and solidification. After leaving the spinneret, the melt pitch is cooled and solidified to form a fiber. This thermal relaxation involves heat transfer from the melt pitch to the cooling medium, which creates a radial temperature gradient across the fiber. Moreover, it is also during this theimal relaxation that the flow-induced structure starts to relax from a stressed high-energy to a low-energy state. The orientation o f the molecules evolves The High

viscosity and fast quenching hinder the order development, causing a random texture. Lower viscosity and slow cooling impart the molecule reorientation and lead to an ordered structure [14].

molecular orientation develop higher modulus, and the strengths can be increased by controlling the molecular orientation during fiber formation. It is also found that

linearizing molecular orientation during fiber formation can yield carbon fibers with enhanced thermal conductivities [15,16]. Although considerable progress has been made over the past four decades, the origin and development o f structure development and texture formation is still not completely understood for mesophase pitch based carbon fibers. Currently research work is being made to control the molecule orientation o f

fibers in order to optimize preferred properties, such as thermal conductivity.

1.4

Thesis Objectives

The overall goal o f this thesis is to study the carbon fibers transverse texture formation and structure development for mesophase pitch based carbon fiber during the melt spinning process in a nonhomogenous temperature field. The aim is to investigate the effects o f the process variables and material properties on the texture evolutions. The objectives o f this thesis are as follows:

(1) To develop a mathematical model that describes the thermodynamic behaviour of liquid crystalline molecules under thermal relaxation process after steady extensional flow for a model incompressible uniaxial nematic pitch phase composed o f rigid disc-like molecules using the Ericksen and Landau-de Gennes nematic continuum theories. (2) To implement, solve and validate a one-dimensional model as specified and developed. To characterize the structure development and texture formation during

thermal relaxation after cessation o f extensional flow. An emphasis is placed on the understanding o f the effect o f process variables and material properties on the texture evolution.

(3) To implement, solve and validate a two-dimensional model as specified and developed. An emphasis is placed on the analysis o f the structural morphology To examine the effects of

Liquid Crystal Basic Concepts
Definition of Liquid Crystal Phases (Mesophases)

Liquid crystal (mesophase) is a name for an intermediate phase between solid and liquid phases. Like mesophase pitch, many organic materials undergo more than one

intermediate phase before heated into liquid phase from solid state [17]. These phases, also called mesophases, have both liquid-like fluidity and crystalline molecular order. The phases flow like a liquid. However, their molecules m aintain some degree o f

rotational order. The flow behavior of mesophase is much more complex than that o f simple fluid flow due to the simultaneous effect o f orientation and fluid flow.

processed by melt spinning or injection molding at temperature range w hen they are liquid crystal melt [18].

Liquid crystal phases are further classified into nematic, cholesteric and smectic according to the phase symmetry. The three different phases are shown in Figure 2.1. In a nematic phase the molecules tend to align parallel to each other. The preferred average molecular orientation is defined as director n, which is a unit vector [19]. Cholesteric phase has a similar nematic order on a local scale, i.e., the molecules tend to align with the director. However, on the larger scale, the director exhibits a helical pattern. Smectic phase has a layered structure and the molecules are aligned parallel w ithin the layer. There are several types o f smectic phases. Figure 2.1c depicts the smectic-A phase.

Compared to smectic and cholesteric phases, the nematic phase has the following characteristics: (1) nematic has cylindrical symmetry; and (2) nematic phase has longrange orientational order but no long-range translational order. Although mesophase

pitch behaves as either thermotropic or lyotripic, it is usually modeled as a discotic nematic thermotropic phase [9].

Orientational Order

In a nematic phase, the molecules tend to align parallel to each other. The orientational order has uniaxial symmetry. This preferred direction is defined by the director n. This unit vector represents the local mean direction o f molecules. As Figure 2.2 shows n is parallel to the long axis in a rod-like nematics, and normal to the molecules if the molecule is discotic. A second local variable is the scalar order parameter, S, which is a measurement o f the degree o f molecular alignment along the director.

Frank-Oseen-Zocher Static Elastic Continuum Theory

Wlien we consider a spatial region inside a macroscopic sample of nematic liquid crj'Stal, it contains a sufficiently large number o f molecules so that the long-range orientational order is well defined within that region. In each of the region we have an orientational director n. The variations o f n are only important over distance much larger than the molecular dimensions. A nematic can still be taken locally uniaxial, and S can then be considered the average degree o f orientation with respect to the local director. In other words, the spatial dependence o f n and the temperature dependence of S can be treated separately. For a definite value o f S(T), the nematic sample may consists different This is the basis o f the following continuum theory o f

arrangement o f director n(r). liquid crystals [19].

In an ideal nematic single liquid crystal, the molecules are aligned along one common director n. If the system is imposed by external fields, such as magnetic, electric or the limiting surface, the orientation o f director n will change from point to point. The

distorted state is described in terms o f a vector field n(r). r is defined as the position of the single liquid crystal in the uniaxial liquid crystal system. The unit length director n(r) varies its orientation slowly and smoothly everywhere. The spatial gradients o f n increase the elastic free energy density o f the system. If the gradient o f the director is small enough to ignore the change in n over the length of a single molecule, the liquid crystals can be described as a continuous medium with a set of elastic constants. Then the increased free energy invoked by the distortion o f n can be

described by a continuum theory. Oseen [23], Zocher [24] and Frank [25] derived the following formula o f the elastic free energy density using the cylindrical symmetry of nematic phases:

Leslie-Ericksen Continuum Theory

The Leslie-Ericksen continuum theory was developed initially for rod-like nematic liquid crystals. It considers the orientation o f molecule rotation, and thus requires the

incorporation of the Frank free energy density. Due to the coupling between molecular orientation and fluid flow, the flow behaviour o f the nematic liquid crystals is much more complex than that o f the conventional fluid flow. The following simplified interpretation o f the Leslie-Ericksen continuum theory considers the following assumptions:

Mass Balance

By applying the conservation law o f mass, the mass balance in Cartesian tensorial notation for an incompressible fluid balance equation is [9,19];

(VV) = 0

(2.4)

where V is the velocity o f the nematic phase. The equation is same as an incompressible fluid flow.

2.3.2

Linear Momentum Balance

In Cartesian tensorial notation for an incompressible fluid, the linear momentum balance equation is [20]:

p V = F + V-T

(2.5)

where p is the fluid density, V is the velocity, and F is the external body force per unit volume. The superposed dot denotes the material time derivative, x is the viscous stress tensor and its constitutive expression is given as [21]:

In equation (2.7a-c), the {aj}, z = 1,..., 6 are known as the viscosity coefficients,p is the pressure and Ã´ is the unit tensor. A is the rate of deformation tensor, N is the angular velocity o f the director relative to that of the fluid, and Â£Ã® is the vorticity tensor. Compared with ordinary isotropic flow, nematic flow has six viscous terms in the stress tensor, because the theory accounts the fact that the stress tensor depends not only on the velocity gradients, but also on the orientation and rotation o f the director. Note that all the terms on the right hand side involve the director orientation except the fourth term A , which is the same term that for an isotropic fluid = 2tj [9].

2.3.3

Angular Momentum Balance

The tensorial notation of the internal angular momentum balance equations in Cartesian coordinate for an incompressible fluid is:

[nXh] = -(cKg -(%2)[nxN]-(<Z; +o: 2)[n x[A n]]

(2.8)

where h is the molecular field. The angular momentum balance governs the director angular motion. The right hand side o f the equation (2.8) defines the elastic torque r ^ on the director per unit volume. The molecular internal elastic field arises from the elasticity o f the nematic material [22]. Differentiation o f the equation (2.2) yields the expression for the molecular internal elastic field defined as follows [9, 19-21]:

Landau-de Gennes Nematic Continuum Theory

Frank elastic free energy density describes the energy increased in a nematic phase when liquid crystal molecules deviate from a uniform phase. At equilibrium, the Helmholtz

free energy density o f a nematic system can be approximated by the following low order polynomial expression in 5 [19];

( 2 i4 )
4 4 lo

where j^(7) is the isotropic free energy density at temperature T, and A, B, C, are material constants. is a temperature slightly below the clearing temperature where the first

order transition occurs. It is also expressed as Tc in liquid crystal literatures [17, 19].

When the scalar order parameter S is constant across the sample, the nematic is characterized by the director field n(r). If there is variation o f temperature across the sample, the scalar order parameter S will be defined as S(r). The nematic free energy density induced by director gradient is not simply given by Frank expression, but also contains terms coming from the gradients o f the scalar order parameter Â« S [17].

Landau [17] made a far-reaching speculation about the functional dependence o f the freeenergy density on the order parameter and its spatial derivatives near a second-order transition point. The theory is intended to express the second-order phase transition, but it can be generalized to include the first-order phase transitions [17]. The free energy density is expressed as a power series in terms o f one or more long-range order parameters and their spatial derivatives. Since only the leading terms are important near the transition point, the resulting expansion is a low-order polynomial with temperature dependent coefficients, de Gennes [19] later applied Landau's theory to the first order phase transition o f nematic phases successfully. For a nematic phase, the order parameter is the scalar order parameter defined by equation (2.1).

Equation (2.15) contains four groups o f terms. The first four terms contain only the scalar order parameter. The next two terms account for the spatial variations in S. The following three terms account for director spatial variation, and is expanded as such to resemble the Frank-Oseen-Zocher free energy density, which is expressed as equation (2.2). The last two terms in equation (2.15) represent the interaction between spatial

variations o f S and spatial variations o f n. In this paper these four group o f terms in equation (2.15) are conveniently called the molecular free energy density fs, the molecular elastic free energy density the Frank elastic free energy density /a, and the

coupling elastic free energy densityyfc, respectively [27].

Ericksen Continuum Theory for Nonhomogenously Ordered Nematic Phases

The Leslie-Ericksen continuum theory describes the dynamic behavior o f the nematic directors in an homogenously ordered system and incorporates the Frank elastic free energy density. Ericksen [28] later proposed a modified version o f the Leslie-Ericksen continuum theory to model the more complex behavior o f nematic directors in a nonhomogenously ordered phase. The modified version contains the essential terms in the elementary static models used to describe the nematic and its scalar order parameter gradient. The most significant changes to the Leslie-Ericksen theory are the addition o f S, and its spatial and temporal gradients.

The balance equations for n and S are defined, respectively, as follows [28]:

The superposed dot denotes the material time derivative, and 5 /^ / Ã´ ( * ) denotes the functional derivative o f _/[ with respect to (*).

Literature Review
In this chapter, mesophase pitch liquid crystal properties, melt spinning process and process variables that affect mesophase pitch based carbon fiber structure and properties are introduced. The commonly observed textures from published production and

experimental observations are also presented. Lastly, the simulation results from previous mathematical models are analyzed.

3.1

Introduction to Mesophase Pitch

Brooks and Taylor [30] first found that in a series o f heat-treated coking tar pitch there is another anisotropic phase coexisting with isotropic phase under optical microscope with polarized light. Brooks and Taylor later defined the anisotropic intermediate phase as mesophase. The mesophase is formed by anisotropic spheres, which are aromatic

molecules stacked together through oligomer formation, coalescence and adhesion. The optical anisotropy observed is due to the layered stacking of its aromatic sheet as shown in Figure 3.1 [2].

Mochida et al [31] later systemically analyzed the mesophase formation mechanism, its liquid crystalline properties, and its ordered structure due to molecular orientation utilizing optical microscopes, microscopes. scanning electron microscopes and transmission electron

The planar molecules in the mesophase pitch stack together and form

Mesophase pitch has been found exhibiting both thermotropic and lytropic liquid crystal nature [32,33]. It remains anisotropic within a certain temperature range below the

transition temperature. The mesophase existence also depends on the pitch composition. It disappears or reappears by adding or removing certain lower molecular weight components. Mesophase pitch also exhibits discotic liquid crystal structural properties. Despite the variety o f formation method, the general molecules are disc shape, and the average molecular weight is 400-4000 [31]. The melt flows in a liquid state above its soften point and maintains the molecule orientation order in a certain temperature range as it flows. The viscosity o f the mesophase is very dependent on the temperature, shear rate.

and mesophase structure.

Unlike small molecular liquid, mesophase pitch flow has

non-Newtonian behaviour. Nazem [34] compared the viscosity o f mesophase pitch and isotropic pitch and other melt spun polymers and found mesophase pitch viscosity is far more temperature dependent than typical melt-spun polymer such as nylon-6. comparison is shown in Figure 3.2. This

Melt Spinning and Process Effect on Fibers Structures and Properties

ThÃ© methods o f mesophase pitch preparation have been investigated since mesophase melt from petroleum or coal tar came into production in the 1950s. More recently, Singer [35]

investigated the mesophase pitch spinnability and rheology, and suggested that it might deform at high temperature by shear or eiongational forces before it become an infusible coke. With his coworkers they first designed the monofilament spinning apparatus with piston feed. The first mesophase pitch based carbon fibers with highly oriented and

organized structure were produced by Union Carbide in the 1960s. After stabilization, carbonization and graphitization the final fibers can achieve extremely high modulus approaching the theoretical limit of graphite (10`^ Pa) [35]. Ever since the very beginning o f the mesophase pitch production, the correlation among the oriented structure, the properties and the spinning process had become the most interesting subject for experimental observation and theoretical studies.

3.2.1

Melt Spinning Process and Process Parameters

Atypical melt spinning process is shown in Figure 3.3 [2]. After some preparational heat treatment mesophase pitch is loaded into a set o f screw extruder where it is heated and mixed to form a viscous melt. Then the viscous melt is forced into the spin pack. Upon existing the spin pack, the extruded filaments are simultaneously quenched and drawn down by a winding device to form solid fibers. Spinning conditions for melt spinning mesophase pitch include; pitch properties (glass transition temperature Tg, density p , viscosity y ), quench air temperature 7c, spinning melt temperature 7g, winder speed V\, cross-flow air velocity, spirmeret diameter [36].

By applying energy, mass and force balances, Edie and Dunham [36] showed that the mesophase melt-spinning process is extremely sensitive to small changes in process conditions. Although the model did not use liquid crystal theories, their results still

indicate that the spinning temperature and heat-treatment rate are the most important process variables among the melt spinning process parameters. # This is because the

mesophase pitch viscosity is extremely temperature sensitive compared to usual fluids. The model predicated a small change in process variables would dramatically affect fiber properties. However, the model could not predict the process effect on the structure formation since the model does not incorporate the physics o f mesophase pitch molecules.

Process Variable Dependent Textures

Hamada et al [13] and McHugh and Edie [37] concluded that different orientations of discotic molecules give rise to various ordered cross sectional textures. Previous work by Hamada et al [13], White and Buechler [14], McHugh and Edie [37] indicated that this

ordered structure is created during melt spinning process; spinning parameters such as the melt spinning temperature, the heat treatment rate, and spinneret geometry all affect the structure texture. Hong et al [38] proved the mesophase pitch based carbon fibers texture is formed during melt spinning stage; the following post treatments only refine the formed texture. They compared the samples taken before and after heat treatment process. The transverse cross-sectional surface was observed by a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM). The as-spun samples were observed after platinum coating, and the heat-treated fibers at 700Â°C or higher without coating. The as-spun fibers spun at 300Â°C, 310Â°C, and 340Â°C exhibit radial, random, and onion textures, respectively. The heat-treated fiber spun at 300Â°C, 3 10Â°C, and 340Â°C exhibit radial texture with open crack, random, and onion with voids in the fiber center, respectively. They concluded high temperature induces onion structure, low temperature would yield radial structure, and intermediate temperature favors a random structure. White and Buechler [14], however, argued that the random texture results from high viscosity and rapid quenching, while the radial texture would form at lower viscosity and slow cooling.

3.2.3

Different Textures Observed from The Experimental Work

In order to explore carbon fibers application, some experimental work is performed to obtain different transverse textures. Hamada et al [13] changed transverse structure by disrupting the flow profile prior to extrusion. Another important experimental observation is the effect o f spinneret geometry on the transverse texture formation. Matsumoto [12] and Edie et al [16] used extrusion capillaries with noncircular cross-sections to produce ribbon shaped carbon. The ribbon shaped fiber has high degree o f orientation than the commonly produced round-shaped fiber. The experimental results show this ribbon

shaped fiber has superior thermal and electrical conductivity and require lower graphitization temperature than the round-shaped fiber. Fortin et al [39] also reported that

their thin fiber tape extruded from siit-shaped nozzle exhibits 2% higher degree of orientation than the round shaped fiber spun through circular nozzle under the some spinning conditions. Edie [2] Anther predicated that this could extend carbon fiber to a new field application where thermal transfer is critical. Gallego and Edie [15] suggested if the degree o f the order o f the structure could be improved during melt spinning process, it will greatly reduce the production cost by decreasing the graphitization temperature.

3.2.4

Texture Dependent Properties

Robinson and Edie [40] indicated that different observed textures exhibit different mechanical and transport properties. For example, mesophase fibers with random textures have higher tensile and compressive strength. By contrast, fibers with ordered transverse textures appear to develop better lattice dependent properties, such as thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity. Bright and Singer [41] also found that the transverse texture could affect the degree o f graphitization. Fibers with radial texture developed large

crystalline with higher degree o f orientation than that o f fibers with random texture. The properties, the texture formation and the mode o f growth have been the subject of numerous articles [12-16,39].

Beginning with the work by Matsumoto [12], Hamada et al [13], and McHugh and Edie [37], it became apparent that the texture o f mesophase fibers was created and thus could be controlled during melt spinning. Since that time numerous researchers have demonstrated that flow during melt spinning can be controlled to create mesophase fibers with a variety of textures, each with certain advantages.

Mathematical Models

Theoretical studies using available liquid crystal continuum theories to model and simulate the ordered structure selection process have been performed by McHugh and Edie [9, 37] and Singh and Rey [42-46]. McHugh and Edie [9,37] modeled mesophase pitch molecules as rigid discotic nematics and studied their molecular orientation during fully developed channel flow. Their numerical results were consistent with pitch observed under a

polarized light microscope. Singh and Rey [42-46] examined continuum theories such as Leslie-Ericksen theory developed for rod-like liquid crystals and proposed that the theories can be extended to low molecular weight disc-like liquid crystal molecules to describe the flow behaviour o f mesophase pitch. Several studies have analyzed the effect o f spinning variables on the structure fonnation o f mesophase pitch based carbon fibers. Spinning temperature and die geometry appear to be the most important variables [47-50].

3.3.1

Wang and Key's Elastic Model

Wang and Rey [50] approximated the melt pitch to be a nematic discotic liquid crystal and assumed the melt spinning process to be an isothermal, incompressible, uniaxial, extensional flow. They modeled the dynamic behavior using the Leslie-Ericksen and

Frank elastic free energy theories and assumed a homogeneous order parameter S. Their simulation results concluded that: (1) minimizing the Frank elastic free energy is the mechanism o f mode selection between radial and onion texture, (2) the onion texture forms at high temperature when bend elastic constant is larger than splay elastic constant K\,

the radial texture forms at low temperature when bend elastic constant K t , is smaller than . I splay elastic constant K \, and (3) a random texture is created in an intermediate temperature range when elastic constants K 3 and Xj are equal. The simulation results are shown in Figure 3.4.

applicable to describe discotic mesophase pitch molecular dynamics.

By applying mass, linear momentum and angular momentum balances using equations (2.1), (2.5), and (2.8), M cHugh and Edie [9] formulated a set o f equations to govern the molecular orientation behaviors in capillary and channel flows. The analytical solution of their model is, as displayed in Figure 3.5: (1) round fibers spun through a circular spinneret tend to exhibit the radial texture, and (2) ribbon-shaped fibers extruded through a rectangular spinneret tend to form line-origin textures. Later studies investigated the

non-circular fiber structure and indicated that carbon fibers with this kind o f texture

The model results show that melt spinning through non-circular spinnerets offers the possibility to improve degree o f orientation o f mesophase pitch based carbon fibers. Studies [16, 39] have shown that the high degree o f ordered texture is the desired structure for materials requiring excellent thermal conductivity.

Figure 3.5 McHugh and Edie's model results. It shows that the round shape spinnerets generate a radial texture fiber; the non-circular cross sectional shape spinnerets will create a fiber with linear texture, which would have higher degree o f orientation [16,39].

These experimental and mathematical studies show that the textures o f mesophase pitch based carbon fibers will vary with the composition o f the mesophase pitch, the spinning temperature, the geometry o f the orifice, etc.. In order to obtain certain product fiber properties, it is necessary to modify the pitch precursor, spinneret structure and spinning conditions such as spinning temperatures [3,4]. However, the degree o f molecular

orientation development during the melt spinning process remains less investigated, but an important issue. Since the material properties o f carbon fibers depend on the molecular structure, it is crucial to investigate the structure development during the melt spinning process in order to capture the fibers degree o f orientation evolution. Gallego and Edie [15] indicated current commercialized fibers possess poorly optimized molecular orientation.

To improve the degree o f the molecular orientation, the present production method is to apply high temperature graphitization, which accounts for most o f the processing cost o f mesophase pitch based carbon fibers. If the molecular orientation c optimized during melt spinning, a lower temperature may be used to graphite the cux,^l fiber and eventually reduce the production cost.

Chapter 4 One-Dimensional Model Development, Results and Discussion
4.1 Introduction to One-Dimensional Model

This chapter studies the relaxation phenomena and the dynamic o f mesophase pitch molecules during cooling process after melt extrusion, using the more general Ericksen and Landau-de Gennes nematic continuum theories. This thermal relaxation involves

heat transfer from the melt pitch to the cooling medium, which creates a radial temperature gradient across the fiber. Moreover, it is also during this thermal relaxation

that the flow-induced structure starts to relax from a stressed high-energy to a low-energy state. Since the material properties o f carbon fibers depend on the molecular structure,

it is crucial to understand the time evolution o f the director and the order parameter during the thermal relaxation period.

The aim o f this chapter is to investigate numerically the structure development and texture formation during the thermal relaxation after cessation o f uniaxial flow for a carbonaceous mesophase pitch. Furthermore, this chapter examines specifically the

effects that the m elt spinning process parameters and material properties have on the time for structure development and the final texture formation. This information is important

for producing a specified fiber structure with desired mechanical and transportation properties.

simulation results, discussions on the solution o f these equations under different conditions, and a section o f summary and concluding remarks.

The following assumptions are used in this one-dimensional model:

(1) The mesophase pitch is thermotropic, which means that the phase transition o f the melt is only affected by temperature changes. (2) Mesophase is incompressible, i.e., the mesophase pitch density p are constant. (3) There are no external body forces, such as the gravitational field. Hence, F = 0.

(4) The director remains within the jc-y plane and there is cylindrical symmetry about z-axis (i.e., the fiber axis). the x-y plane (5) Backflows are negligible and neglected, and (6) The inertia o f the director is negligible and neglected. Mesophase pitch thermal conductivity is a constant within

inhibits the liquid crystal molecular reorientation and limits the texture development. Lower viscosity and slow cooling provides more time for liquid crystal molecular reorientation and allows fiber cross sectional structure to develop into a well-defined texture.

The simulation results are consistent with White and Buechler's prediction [14].

That is

the radial texture is formed at low viscosity and slow cooling, the random texture results from high viscosity and rapid quenching, and intermediate textures result from partial annihilation o f declinations. These simulation results provide additional information on

molecular orientation during post melt spinning process, which helps to improve the product properties and to reduce the post treatment process cost.

Two-Dimensional Model Development, Results and Discussion
Chapter 4 presents the one-dimensional modeling and simulation o f the texture formation for mesophase pitch based carbon fibers. It is capable o f capturing the structure

development in a nonisothermal system where the scalar order parameter and temperature is nonhomogeneous across the fiber radius. The transverse texture formation, however, is better to describe in a two-dimensional space. This chapter is dedicated to developing and simulation of texture formation for mesophase pitch based carbon fibers using the Erickesen and Landau-de Gennes continuum theories in a two-dimension space. In

addition, this chapter also examines specifically the effects that the melt spinning process parameters and material properties, such as liquid crystal surface anchoring behavior and pitch melt textures, on the structure evolution and the final texture formation. This

information is important for producing a specified fiber structure with desired mechanical and transportation properties.

The rest o f the chapter consists of the development o f the partial differential equations I I g: % # that govern the relaxation phenomena o f noniiomogeneously ordered mesophase melt after extrusion flow in a two-dimensional space. It also contains physical and

mathematical interpretations o f the results, discussions on the solutions o f these equations, comparison marks with one-dimensional results, and a section o f summary.

The following assumptions are used in this two-dimensional study;

(1) The mesophase pitch is thermotropic. The phase transition is only effected by teinperatuie changes.

(2) Mesophase is incompressible, i.e., the mesophase pitch density p i s a constant. (3) There are no external body forces, such as the gravitational field. Hence, F = 0. (4) The director remains within the x-y plane. Mesophase pitch thermal conductivity fcth is a constant within the x-y plane. (5) Backflows are negligible. (6) The inertia o f the director is negligible and neglected.

Since there are three unknowns, three balance equations are needed. The three equations that govern the behaviour o f temperature T, director 0 , and the scalar order parameter S are the energy balance equation o f the system, the z-component internal angular momentum balance equation, and the scalar order parameter balance equation, respectively.

Balance Equation Formulation

This section consists o f the development o f the two-dimensional partial differential equations that govern the time evolution of temperature, director, and the scalar order parameter within the carbonaceous mesophase fiber during the cooling process after it is pulled out o f the spinneret. First, the Landau-de Germes energy term in the Ericksen continuum theory is defined in the two-dimensional space. Then the balance equations for director and the scalar order parameter are derived according to the modified version o f the Leslie-Ericksen continuum theory. Lastly, the set o f partial differential equations is nondimensionalized.

5.2.1

Landau-de Gennes Free Energy

In the Ericksen continuum theory, the static energy term is defined by Landau-de Gennes energy density expressed by equation (2.15). The coefficients A , B, and C in the Landaude Gennes free energy density (eqution (2.15)) are not known for a mesophase pitch. It is then convenient to replace the terms introduced by these coefficients in the free energy density by the Doi and Edwards [29] approximation expressed by equation (2.19). The Landau-de Gennes free energy density o f the system then can be expressed as:

The material physical properties and the melt spinning process parameters used in this chapter are also same as those that aie used in Chapter 4 and are tabulated in Tables 4.1 to 4.3. The values for K, Ks, and K(, are obtained by assuming the same ratio o f Za / L\, as defined in Chapter 4, which is in the same range as published theoretical work [20-23]. The absolute values o f the three elastic constants are of the order o f 10'^^ N [24]. Furthermore, the elastic constants satisfy the constitutive hypothesis set by the following conditions [34]:

Auxiliary Equations
Initial Conditions

The initial molecular orientation are formed during melt spinning extrusion flow and aligned along the flow direction with some thermal fluctuation [9,13,37]. The fluctuation is assumed to be random, which generated by a build-in random number generator. Then the initial director field can be expressed as:

(5.14)

where do represent director field initial average orientation angle, e is a random number determined using a standard random number generator and is within the range 0 < e < 1, and ?/ is a factor that controls the magnitude o f the fluctuation. In this study, rj = 0.5 is used. The choice o f the algebraic operation Â± is determined randomly by using a random number generator with a different seed than that used to generate e. I If the random

number generated is less than 0.5, the sign is negative; otherwise, it is positive.

Initial temperatures take as the spinning temperature at everywhere o f the fiber cross section, and the initial scalar order parameters are assumed as at the equilibrium value. According to above assumptions, the initial conditions can be expressed in the following equations:

Boundary Conditions

The realistic boundary conditions for molecular orientation used in this study represent two typical surface anchoring behaviours o f mesophase pitch molecules during the fabrication o f carbon fibers. One boundary condition represents the case where the

discotic liquid crystalline molecules are oriented with the aromatic rings perpendicular to the spinneret. This is obtained by setting the directors, which are perpendicular to the discotic molecules at = 0. Another possible boundary condition for the director field

is where the discotic liquid crystalline molecules are aligned parallel (i.e., tangential) to the spinneret surface. This is represented in the model by setting the director orientation angles at the spirmeret surface to be 90Â°, i.e., 6^= tv 12 radians.

Boundary conditions for temperature and the scalar order parameter fields are assumed as Dirichlet conditions. For temperature field, the surface o f fiber takes the cooling air

temperature; the scalar order parameters take the equilibrium value at the surface temperature.

The boundary conditions are expressed as follows:

The governing equations derived in this study are three coupled non-linear partial differential equations, and require numerical method for solution. The Galerkin finite

element method (GFEM) and the first order Euler predictor-corrector time integrator are used in the study to solve the set of equations. Detailed description o f the GFEM can be found elsewhere [53-55]. The GFEM are used to discrete the space to generate a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations. Gaussian Quadrature method.

A mesh o f 300 quadrilateral elements with 321 nodes is used in this study. The source code is written using Fortran 77. The computational solutions are obtained by running the source code on a SunUltra 60 Workstation. The CPU time required for the two-dimensional model is about 6 days.

representative results for the molecular orientations, which are plotted through simulations for the two cases using the initial and boundary conditions listed in Table 5.1. The followed presentation and discussion on the free energy, temperature and the scalar order parameter fields are typical and applicable to both cases in Table 5.1. In this

chapter, the representative case chosen is when a = 10^ and ^ = 10''. The section begins by showing the time evolution of the molecular field, and temperature and the scalar order parameter spatial profiles for a = 10^ and 15= 10''. This is followed by a discussion on the effect of the dimensionless thermal diffusivity a on the thermal relaxation phenomenon. This section concludes with a discussion on how the dimensionless

thermal diffusivity a affects the order development and texture formation in carbon fibers.

5.5.1

Mode Selection

Figure 5.2 shows the two-dimensional relaxation phenomena of the molecular field when Â« = 10^ and for case 1 (first column), and case 2 (second column) at the following

dimensionless times t : (a) 0.0, (b) 0.01, (c) 0.016, (d) 0.05. The short line segments represent the edges o f the discotic molecules, and are obtained by noting that a director is normal to the disc-like molecule. The first column shows that, under the initial and

boundary conditions restricted by case 1, the molecules go from a randomly aligned state to a quasi-onion state, and finally evolving into a perfectly concentric (i.e., onion) texture. In contrast, the second column shows that, under the initial and boundary conditions restricted by case 2, the molecules go from a randomly aligned state to a zigzagged state, and eventually evolving into a perfectly radial texture. This is consistent with the

experimental observations reported in the literatures [12,13]. Matsumoto [12] reported that extrusion tlirough a large diameter capillary could yield fibers with concentric textures. Hamada et al [13] formed onion fibers by stirring the pitch upstream. Wang

and Ray [50] predicted that at low temperature the bend elastic constant X3 < K\, leading to a bend mode deformation, causing the pitch molecules to orient radially in fibers cross section; at high temperature, Ã3 > Ki, yielding a concentric, onion arrangement o f the molecules in fibers cross-section [50]. In this study, due to the assumption K\ -- K-i, the

model could not predict the elastic constant effect on the texture selection. Nevertheless, the results show tliat the texture selection is dependency of multivariable, such as the initial texture, surface-anchoring effect, and consistent with prior published theoretical work [37,56].

5.5.2

S tructure Development

Figure 5.2 also shows the fiber transverse structure development during the thermal relaxation period. It shows that the fiber textures evolve from stressed high-energy states to structures with minimal distortion Frank elastic free energy at steady state. The

driving force for the structure development is the minimization o f the stored Frank elastic free energy F ^ , as shown in Figure 5.3.

In summary, the scientific visualizations o f the fiber cross-sectional textures plotted from the computer simulations indicate that the mesophase pitch based carbon fiber texture formation is a combination o f mode (radial or onion) selection and structure development. The mode selection between radial and onion textures depends on the

mesophase pitch textures inherited from upstream and surface anchoring behaviours of mesophase pitch molecules. The stiucture development can be well explained using the

Frank elastic free energy theory. Discotic nematics are elastic materials, where energy is stored by orientation strains. The driving force for the texture developing from a

randomly aligned texture to a perfectly organized texture is the minimization o f the stored Frank elastic free energy.

Time Evolution of Frank Elastic Free Energy

Figure 5.3 is a plot o f the stored Frank elastic free energy Fi versus dimensionless time t*. The two-dimensional dimensionless form FÃ * may be obtained using equation (2.2) and is expressed as:

In order to characterize the time evolution o f the molecular reorientation from the totally random oriented state to the well-defined structure at steady state, and are defined

(in the same way as in Chapter 4) as the time required for the molecules to reorient such that the Frank elastic free energy Fd decreases by 86.5% and 98%, respectively. For this case, Tj = 0.016 and = 0.05. This figure shows that the Frank elastic free energy Fd

evolution goes through three stages; fast, intermediate, and weak relaxation. The three relaxation stages are consistent with the texture development exhibited in Figure 5.2. In the fast relaxation stage, corresponding to t* < 0.016 (or Td) in Figure 5.2, the molecules are initially randomly oriented which leads to a strained texture. This initial texture

stores the greatest-level distortion free energy, which is the driving force for the fast relaxation rate for t* < %. In stage 2, corresponding to 0.016 (or %) < t* < 0.05 (or Tq) in Figure 5.2, the Frank free energy Fd" decreases from 13.5% to 2% o f its initial value; the molecules fomr well-defined structures at the end o f this time period. In the final weak relaxation stage, corresponding to t"> 0.05 (or %) in Figure 5.2, the residue o f the Frank elastic free energy Fd* is the small driving force to reorient the molecules into the onion or radial textures. This is consistent with the time evolution of the Frank elastic free However, the total

energy Fd* obtained from the one-dimensional model in Chapter 4.

amount o f the Frank elastic free energy Fd" in this model is less than that o f the one dimensional model calculated in Chapter 4, because this model used a smaller random number and generated a less randomly oriented initial structure.

phenomena across the fiber transverse section. The fiber exits the spinneret at spiiming temperature Ts = 600 K, and is suddenly exposed to cooling air temperature o f Tq -- 373 K. It is assumed that there is perfect thermal contact between the cooling air and the mesophase pitch. Therefore, when the two-dimensional temperature profile becomes

Time Evolution of Molecular Free Energy Fs

Effect of a on The Thermal Relaxation

This part study uses the same routine as that used in Chapter 4, the dimensionless process time scales % and ta are simulated for different dimensionless thermal diffusivity

a and plotted in Figure 5.7. This figure is used to discuss the effect o f the dimensionless thermal diffusivity a on mesophase pitch based carbon fiber texture formation and ordered structure development. The slanted dashed line indicates that the thermal

relaxation process steady state time Xa decreases monotonically with dimensionless thermal diffusivity a. This means that the time for S and T to reach steady state The reason for this phenomenon is that the dimensionless

decreases as a increases.

thermal diffusivity is the factor that controls the rate o f the heat transfer between the mesophase pitch and the cooling air (see equation (5.10a)), i.e., the rate o f heat transfer increases with a. The two solid near-horizontal lines represent the dependencies o f the dimensionless director reorientation times % and % versus the dimensionless theimal diffusivity a. The nearly flat lines show that the dimensionless thermal diffusivity a has little effect on the director field relaxation. These results are consistent with the one dimensional simulation conclusion, and also can be explained by the time evolution of molecular orientation equation. The dynamic behaviour o f the director reorientation is

governed by equation (5.10b). The right side of equation (5.10b) has eight terms. The first term, the second term and the last six terms are obtained, respectively, from 7^*,/Ã *, and 7c'The simulation results indicated that, compared with Frank elastic free energy,

and 7c* induced by interaction between S and n spatial gradients are negligible. Therefore, the effect o f the first term and the last six terms on the director reorientation in equation (5.10b) can be neglected. Consequently, the time evolution of the director field in two-dimensional space can be expressed as:

Equation (5.20) shows that the relaxation o f director field is not affected by the thermal

diffusivity because the dimensionless elastic function at,*, is related only to Landau elastic constants (see equation (A.3b)). The other two terms o f equation (5.10b) have little effect on the director time evolution. This leads to the director reorientation behaviour being nearly independent o f the scalar order parameter S' and temperature T fields.

Using the same way as Chapter 4, to characterize the thermal diffusivity effect on the texture formation and the ordered structure development, % is defined as the value of a

i

at the space cross over point of % and

and the value at the cross over point between

Ta and T d is denoted as cxa- As discussed above. Ta may be taken as the time for the temperature T and the scalar order parameter profile's spatial profiles to reach steady

state. Furthermore, % and % may be taken as the time for the liquid crystal molecule spatial profile to reorient to within 86.5% and 98%, respectively, o f its steady state profile. It should be noticed that this dimensionless thermal diffusivity a also counts in the ratio o f viscosity and elastic properties expressed as / Ã . Consequently, high

value o f a indicates higher viscosity, lower elasticity, and fast cooling rate, low value o f (Zrepresents lower viscosity, higher elasticity, and slow cooling process.

As Figure 5.7 shows that for a > Od, the process time Ta is less than reorientation times % d and T o. This means there is little time available for discotic molecules to rotate, leading a partially aligned texture depicted in Figure (5.2b). For Figure 5.7

shows T d < Ta < To. W hen a is between this values, the molecules will have more time to reorient into the well-defined structures (i.e., radial or onion textures) exhibited in Figure (5.2c). For a<O o, the plot shows Ta > % and This means the reorientation time

provided by the thermal relaxation process for molecules to rotate is longer than the time that the molecules require to reorient to well-defined radial or onion structures as exhibited in Figure (5.2d).

Summary

In this chapter, a two-dimensional model that describes the dynamic o f mesophase pitch molecules in a nonisothermal system was developed and solved to study the structure development and texture formation in a discotic uniaxial nematic mesophase pitch based carbon fiber after cessation of extensional flow.

The simulation results are consistent with that obtained from the one-dimensional model. The structure development is affected by the cooling rate, pitch melt viscosity and elasticity. High thermal diffusivity caused by higher viscosity and fast cooling inhibits Lower

the liquid crystal molecular reorientation and limits the texture development.

viscosity and slow cooling provides more time for liquid crystal molecular reorientation and allows fiber cross sectional structures to develop into well-defined radial or onion textures.

Furthermore, the two-dimensional model is able of capturing five types o f texture patterns, which match the commonly observed texture for mesophase pitch based carbon

fibers. They are random, folded radial, radial, quasi-onion, and onion. These various textures represent the various combinations possible from the interplay between texture selection and structure development during the fiber spinning process. The mode

selection between radial and onion textures are affected by the original texture and the surface anchoring behaviour o f mesophase pitch molecules. The numerical results are consistent with production and experimental observations [12,13].

Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work
6.1 Conclusions

A mathematical model that describes the dynamic behavior o f mesophase pitch molecules in a nonhomogenous temperature system has been developed, and solved in one dimensional and two-dimensional space, respectively. The simulation results from the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models are consistent. The results from the

present work proved that the mesophase pitch based carbon fiber texture formation is a combination o f texture selection and structure development during cooling process. The textures obtained from the study are similar to that observed through experimental studies. They are: random, radial, zigzag radial, onion, and quasi-onion. Several

important conclusions can be drawn from the understanding o f this study:

(1) The results from the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models both indicate that the cooling step involves the relaxation o f Frank elastic free energy account director distortion. taking into

developed texture (the radial or onion) to release the Frank elastic free energy

(2) High dimensionless thermal diffusivity caused by higher viscosity and fast cooling inhibits the liquid crystal molecular reorientation and limits the texture development. Lower viscosity and slow cooling provides more time for liquid crystal molecular reorientation and allows fiber cross sectional structure to develop into a well-ordered texture.

(3) The results from the two-dimensional model shows that the mode selection between radial and onion textures are affected by the original texture and anchoring behaviors o f mesophase pitch molecules. Wang and Rey's model indicated the stable texture depends on the relative size o f the elastic constants {Ki and K^) related with bend and splay deformation o f the mesophase pitch. The Landau-de Gennes free energy used in this are equal, therefore the current model could

model assumes elastic constants Ki and

not predict elastic constants effect on texture formation.

(4) Compared with one-dimensional model, the two-dimensional model gives better insight on the texture formation across mesophase pitch based carbon fibers, although the one-dimension model is capable o f capturing the structure development for mesophase pitch based carbon fibers. Another advantage o f the two-dimensional model is that it describes the transportation phenomena more accurately. The process time for heat

transfer across the carbonaceous mesophase fiber cross section obtained from the twodimension model is much slower than that obtained from the one-dimensional model, and is closer to that o f the actual thermal transportation in melt spinning process reported by the current literature [2]. In addition, the two-dimensional model has fewer assumptions and limitations, thus provided a better understanding on the structure development and texture formation for mesophase pitch based carbon fibers.

6.2

Contributions

The viscoelastic model, compared to previous mathematical studies, contributes to the current texture formation o f mesophase pitch based carbon fibers in the following aspects;

(1) The model takes into consideration o f temperature gradients, which are present during the actual spinning fabrication process.

(2) The model demonstrates the structure development from random to well-defined textures.

92

(3) The model is capable o f predicting the process effect, such as the cooling rate, on texture formation.

(4) The elasticity and viscosity o f mesophase pitch are both taken into account in the model.

(5) The effect o f the liquid crystal molecular anchoring behaviour on the texture formation is also investigated in the model.

6.3

Recommendations for Future Work

Based on the findings presented in this work, the following recommendations are made for fiirther study o f the mesophase pitch carbon fiber texture formation:

(1) The simplifying assumptions that the material properties are constant in different directions should be removed.

(2) The effect o f different shape geometry o f the spinneret on the texture formation should be investigated.

(3) More realistie boundary conditions should be imposed.

If the glass transition

temperature T' g were incorporated in the boundary conditions, the results may be more realistic.
