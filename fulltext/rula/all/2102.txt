Combined Electrochemical & Biological Treatment of Industrial Wastewater using Porous Electrodes and a Packed Bed Aerator, M.A.Sc., 2004, Robert Mitzakov, Department of Chemical Engineering, Ryerson University

ABSTRACT

Zinc, nickel and propylene glycol methyl ether were simultaneously removed from simulated wastewater in a column containing a counter-current packed bed and an electrochemical cell. Rectangular porous aluminum foam cathode and porous stainless steel anode were used in a plate-in-tank configuration. During combined biological and electrochemical treatment the wastewater flux was 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^-m'^-s'* at a constant volumetric air flux of 0.0518 m^-m'^-s'*. Over a 72 hour treatment period the BOD 5 was reduced by 32% and 55% for each volumetric liquid flux, respectively; zinc was reduced by 98% for both fluxes, and nickel was reduced by 95% and 82%, respectively. For sole electrochemical treatment of 48 hours, laminar and turbulent flow conditions were studied. Operating in the laminar flow region of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^-m'^- s*'; zinc was reduced by 95% for both fluxes; nickel was reduced by 80% and 60%, respectively. For the turbulent region in the electrochemical cell, the volumetric liquid fluxes were 0.0137, 0.0229, 0.0321 and 0.0366 m^-m'^-s'*. Per cent reduction of both zinc and nickel in this region was less than that encountered in laminar flow. For all fluxes in the turbulent region zinc was reduced by 82%; nickel was reduced by 55% at a flux of 0.0137 m^ m'^ s ' and 60% at a flux of 0.0366 m^-m'^-s"'. Increasing electrode surface area as a means of improving heavy metal reduction by using rectangular porous material in a plate-in-tank configuration is not a viable option at higher volumetric liquid fluxes.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION
The present study is concerned with the treatment of wastewater generated from an

electro-coating process in the automotive industry. Electro-coating is a method of paint application in which a paint film is deposited onto a metallic substrate by the passage of an electric current between the substrate being coated and another electrode while immersed in a bath of water-thinned paint [1]. Electro-coating provides corrosion protection to automotive bodies and components. To understand the origin of the wastewater generated and the contaminants a brief outline of the electro-coat process is presented. This process involves the following four general stages [ 1 ]:

1

. Pretreatment: To clean and prepare the metal parts for painting. Cleaning is required to remove such soils as metal lubricants and drawing compounds from the surface of the substrate. These compounds are generally organic in nature. After the cleaning stages the substrate is rinsed in a series of rinses to remove the surface cleaner residue and remove loose soils. The wastewater generated in this stage is from spent cleaning solutions and rinse waters. Following the cleaning stages, the metallic substrate is then sent to a phosphate conversion coating stage where a protective coating is applied, typically zinc as it offers better corrosion protection. This stage contains such chemicals as phosphoric acid, phosphate salts and other reagents. Upon removal of the parts from this bath there are further rinsing stages to remove any residual zinc and chemical compounds. Wastewater generated from this stage includes spent process solution and rinse waters.

2. Electro-coat bath: Application of the paint to the metallic substrate. The paint bath contains pigment, resin, deionized water and other additives. These additives include coalescing solvents such as propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME). 3. Rinsing: To remove any undeposited paint from parts coated in the paint bath. The aqueous painting solution and rinses are usually treated through an ultrafiltration system, from which the concentrate is returned to the paint bath and the permeate reused as rinse water. Wastewater generated typically comes from a bleed stream, and from spent rinse water.

Introduction

4. Curing: A temperature induced chemical reaction conversion to create cross-linked and tight seal on the metallic substrate.

1.1

Conventional treatm ent processes The outline of the electro-coat process indicates the generation of large amounts of

wastewater from rinse stages, and from spent cleaning solutions. As indicated this wastewater contains heavy metals such as zinc, nickel, and organic compounds from the pretreatment rinses and from the paint bath rinses. Treating wastewater falls under two categories; pollution prevention practices, and end-of pipe. Pollution prevention practices entail reducing water use, extending the life of process bath constituents or adding recycle or reuse technologies [2]. The recycle and reuse option is also known as in-process prevention that include a variety of options such as activated carbon adsorption, electrodialysis, electrolytic recovery, and ion exchange, to name a few. A review of these technologies can be found in the literature [2, 3]. End-of pipe methods treat the wastewater prior to discharge to municipal sewer system. The most common end-of pipe treatment for dissolved metals is chemical precipitation and flocculation followed by gravity clarification. Chemical precipitation includes hydroxide, sulfide, or carbonate precipitation [2]. The most common is through the use of calcium, sodium or magnesium hydroxide. These chemicals form a metallic precipitate through an increase in the wastewater pH. Precipitation of most metals occurs in the range of 8.5 to 10.0 so that pH adjustment is required. The precipitate generated is of a colloidal nature that primarily remains in solution. To increase particle size and thereby improve settling coagulant and flocculating agents are used that are eventually removed in a gravity clarifier. Prior to discharge to municipal sewers the treated wastewater requires a pH adjustment to between 6.0 and 7.0. This whole process requires extensive use of chemicals for pH adjustment, and for coagulation and flocculation. In addition, this process generates large amounts of sludge that contain a high concentration of heavy metals. Consequently, further treatment of the sludge is required to make it suitable for disposal. The use of all these chemicals and disposal costs for removal of the sludge from an industrial site lead to increased costs of operation.

Introduction

In terms of organic material, the wastewater generated contains dissolved organic matter from the paint solvents and cleaner rinses. The most common conventional treatment of liquid industrial organic matter includes aerated lagoons and trickling filters. Aerated lagoons require long retention times ranging from a few days to two weeks [4]. Consequently, they require a large area requirement and are usually limited to industries discharging low daily volumes of waste [4]. The trickling filter entails distribution of the water over an inert packing material covered by a biofilm by which organic matter is removed. As the biofilm grows it becomes thicker leading to anaerobic conditions below a defined depth in the film. This portion of the biofilm limits the ability of the filter to remove BOD by the aerobic activity of the filter film [4]. Further, the reaction rate constant for soluble industrial wastewaters is relatively low so that these filters are not economically attractive in achieving high treatment efficiencies for BOD reduction greater than 85 percent [4].

1.2

Effluent discharge limits
The conventional treatment methods described may no longer be sufficient for meeting

the changes in regulations on discharge limits. Chemical precipitation for heavy metals is dependent on the pH of the wastewater. Each dissolved metal has a corresponding optimum pH for which the solubility is a minimum. The wastewater generated from an electro-coat paint process will have a mixture of metals such as zinc and nickel. Hydroxide precipitation is generally carried out at a compromised pH for metals [5]. As a result, the minimum concentration of a metal may not be at its minimum so that concentration discharge limits may not be reached. In practice, if zinc is the only metal to be removed an effluent concentration of 0.5 mg l ' using calcium hydroxide as the precipitating agent is achievable [6 ]. On the other hand, if nickel is the only metal to be removed a concentration of 0.5 mg l ' can be achieved using sodium sulfate as the precipitating agent [6 ]. However, with a mixture of metals in the effluent, the achievable concentration may not be met so that higher concentrations in the effluent would violate discharge limits.

Introduction

For organic pollutants, discharge limits are usually expressed in terms of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). This parameter represents the amount of oxygen required for oxidation of biodegradable organic matter. Recently, as of 2003 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established daily effluent maximum concentrations for existing indirect dischargers in the Metal Plating and Machinery (MP&M) sector. These limits are even lower than those previous. The following table summarizes current and previous maximum daily discharge limits for zinc and nickel in the MP&M sector [2]. Also in this table are discharge limits for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and as a comparison, discharge limits from the City of Toronto [7].

Introduction

1.3

Alternative treatm ent Over the past two decades application of electrochemistry to environmental problems

has found increasing use [6,8-10]. Electrochemistry can be used for the removal of heavy metals from dilute process liquid streams, and recalcitrant organic compounds through electrochemical oxidation. Generally a dilute liquid is characterized by (1) the nature of polluting inorganics and organics, (2) the concentration range is lower than 1000 ppm, (3) nature and concentration of a supporting electrolyte is lower than 1000 ppm, and (4) the specific conductivity of the solution is lower than 1 G '' m`* [9]. Typical electrochemical technologies for treating dilute solutions include direct reduction of the inorganic at a cathode, electrodialysis or ion exchange assisted electrodialysis [9]. Direct electrolysis can include the use of two-or three-dimensional electrodes. Two-dimensional electrodes are typically flat plate whereas three-dimensional can include fixed-bed, perforated plates, or metallic foams. Organic concentration of the wastewater as indicated by the BOD may need to be reduced to acceptable discharge limits prior to entering a municipal sewer system. The conventional treatment methods for reducing organic concentration may meet the discharge limits but as mentioned, they have other limitations that do not make them amenable for some industrial situations. The aeration of wastewater in a packed column has been shown to be an effective alternative to the trickling filter in treating dilute organic loads [11]. Completely submerged packed bed or Buidized-bed reactors have also shown to be effective [ 1 2 ].

1.4

Objectives The wastewater generated from an electro-coating paint process typically has zinc and

nickel concentrations of 20 ppm, and BOD concentration of 200 ppm [11]. This wastewater is amenable for treatment by direct electrolysis for heavy metal reduction, and an aerated packedcolumn for reduction in organic matter. The simultaneous treatment of such wastewater was previously investigated by Doan et al. [13] in which successful reduction of zinc, nickel, and propylene glycol methyl ether was achieved.

Introduction

The present is a continuation of this work with the following objectives;

1. The previous study used rectangular flat plate electrodes to carry out heavy metal reduction. The treatment of dilute aqueous metallic streams is mass-transfer limited resulting in low conversions per pass. To improve mass transport in dilute solutions would require either increased turbulence or increased electrode surface area. Therefore, in the present study porous electrodes are used with rectangular geometry.

Theoretical Considerations

2.1.1.1 Electrochemical cell The oxidation-reduction reaction in an electrochemical cell is heterogeneous as the reaction occurs on the electrode surface. In these types of reactions there is the loss of electrons by one species and a gain of electrons by another species. The species that gains electrons has a reduction in its oxidation number while the species that loses electrons has an increase in its oxidation number. A general expression that describes a half-reaction of an oxidation-reduction reaction where species 0 is reduced to species R can be expressed as follows:

0

+ 7ie <

>R

(2.1)

A typical electrochemical cell consists of electrodes, cathode and anode, electrolyte and external wiring and loads. The oxidation of a species occurs at the anode while reduction occurs at the cathode. Equation (2.1) describes the reaction at the cathode. The opposite of this equation occurs at the anode, where species R loses electrons to become oxidized to O. These coupled reactions produce an electric current, that is, the flow of electrons through a circuit, either spontaneously or non-spontaneously. The spontaneity of such reactions is defined by the Gibbs free energy change of the system. The resulting expression represents the maximum useful work that can be obtained from this reaction. The equilibrium cell potential is related to the Gibbs free energy change through the following expression [14]:

Literature Review

nFE^^,, = -n F (E ^-E ^) For a process to be spontaneous the change in Gibbs free energy must be less than zero. For this to occur the cell potential, E, must be a positive value. This cell potential is based on the standard reduction potential of a reaction occurring at the appropriate electrode. As there is no means of measuring an absolute electrode potential the standard reduction potentials are stated relative to the hydrogen electrode which is arbitrarily assigned a potential of zero volts. The following are standard reduction potentials for zinc and nickel at 25° C [15]:

Ni (s)

£ " = -0.23 V

(2.3b)

The negative reduction potential in these equations indicates both species have greater reducing strengths and readily lose electrons. Based on this zinc would have a greater tendency than nickel to lose electrons. If the resulting cell potential is negative the change in Gibbs free energy of the system would be positive indicating a non-spontaneous process. In such a situation, an external power source would be required to provide a potential greater than the potential that the spontaneous reverse reaction would produce. Most often, the reduction potential of oxidized and reduced species is not in their standard states, namely, a temperature of 25°C and an activity of 1.0. To account for the situation in which the equilibrium potential of the half-reactions are not in their standard states the Nemst equation was developed [14]:

AE" = A E ^

(2.4)

When there is a net flow of current through the electrode there will be a shift in the electrodes potential from its equilibrium position. This shift represents an overvoltage that is

Literature Review

dependent on resistance of the electrolyte, activation energy barrier limitations, and concentration effects through transport limitations [16]. The overvoltage is often considered as a sum of these factors:

E = E" +

(2.5)

The first factor is due to the resistance of the electrolyte between the two electrodes. However, when considering the entire electro-cell as a whole, resistances are also encountered from the electrodes themselves, wiring, and external loads. All these resistances can be

lumped together into an overall cell resistance, and represented through Ohm's Law for the cell:

V oh m

ce ll

The second factor is due to the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction which is linked to the activation energy of the reaction. Slow kinetics is due to a large activation energy barrier. To overcome slow kinetics either an increase in temperature could be used or an increase in the applied voltage across the electrodes could be used to achieve any appreciable current flow. The activation overvoltage is also linked to the third factor, namely, concentration overvoltage. A current will be established provided that there is a continuous supply of reactants to the electrode. This is affected by the rate of mass transport. The reaction occurring at the electrode consumes the reactant creating a concentration gradient between the reactant at the electrode surface, outside the diffuse part of the double layer, and in the bulk liquid. A double layer forms when cations are attracted to a negatively charged surface that displace some solvent dipoles from the surface and form a compact organized layer [14]. Outside this layer the ions in solution retain some structure resulting form the electrostatic influences of the electrode surface [14]. The extent of the concentration gradient is dependent on the rate of mass transport. For a fast electrode reaction, a reactant must be replaced at an appreciable rate ifl order to maintain the reaction. In such a case, mass transport becomes a limiting factor.

Literature Review

2.1.1.2 Mass Transport The rate of an electrochemical reaction cannot occur faster than the rate at which the electroactive species reaches the electrode surface. There are three modes of mass transfer that can take place in an electrochemical reactor: 1. Migration, due to a potential gradient;
2

. Diffusion, due to a concentration gradient;

3. Convection, due to convective movement of the liquid For dilute solutions, mass transfer becomes the dominant factor. In order to obtain any appreciable rate of reaction so that process is viable, a means of increasing the transport of electroactive species towards the electrode surface is required. The general expression describing the rate or more specifically the flux of the species for a dilute solution is given as the following [17]:

Nj =-z,//,Fc,.VO-£>,.Vc,.+ c,y
fliLX migration diffusion convection

(2.7)

In this expression convection will be the predominant mode of transport for a flow system. Migration and diffusion are more important when situations involve studying the role of diffusion or in obtaining diffusion coefficients for a particular electrolyte system. For the treatment of dilute effluent streams convection is of importance. In studies on diffusion coefficients for example, a supporting electrolyte is used to minimize the transport by migration of the electroactive species under study. The importance here is that migration is due to the movement of charged species due to a potential gradient so that the presence of the supporting electrolyte is solely for the transport of charge as charge does not discriminate based on the type of ion. Further, the supporting electrolyte is an inert substance that does not partake in the electrode reactions, and aides in increasing solution conductivity to reduce the ohmic overvoltage described previously. Improving the transport of mass by convection cannot entirely eliminate the diffusive and migratory terms in the flux density expression. Increased convection will bring

Literature Review

electroactive species closer to the electrode surface but there still remains a laminar layer adjacent to the electrode whereby diffusion and migration occur. The importance of increasing convection is to reduce the thickness of this layer, and the resistance to mass transfer that it creates as diffusion and migration are slow processes relative to convection. As the focus of the present study is on increasing mass transport through convective means, migration and diffusion will not be discussed in detail.

2.1.1.3 Convection The transport of mass is part of the overall electrode reaction. This reaction can be considered as consisting of a sequence of mass transport and electron transfer mechanisms [14]:

For industrial situations, the flux density equation as written in Equation (2.7) becomes very difficult to solve. Situations encountered include unstirred or agitated solutions, flow of the electrolyte and current path may occur in different directions to one another known as fiow-by or flow-through, or the electrode geometry and structure can be quite complex as in porous-type electrodes [14]. One method of alleviating this problem is through the use of dimensionless correlations to account for the convective and diffusive terms of the electroactive species. This method only provides insight into the macroscopic averaged properties of the mass transport conditions in the cell. The typical functional relationship to describe mass transfer within the electrochemical cell is through a power correlation in terms of the Sherwood number, Sh as a function of the Reynolds number. Re, and the Schmidt number. Sc:

Sh = {c)Re` ' ·Sc''

(2.9)

11

Literature Review

In this expression the Sherwood number represents the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient, the Reynolds number is a measure of the inertial to viscous effects, and the Schmidt number is a measure of transport by viscous to diffusive forces. The constants C, a and b are experimentally determined. The current density is indicative of the rate of reaction per unit area of electrode. The transport of electrons in the Equation (2.8b) generates a charge that is indicative of the extent of the electrochemical reaction and is given by Faraday's Law of Electrolysis which relates the charge produced, q to the number of moles, m of reacting species:

q = J/dt = mtiF
0

(2.10)

In this expression i represents the current density, n is the number of electrons transferred, m represents the number of moles of electroactive species and, F is Faraday's constant (96,485 A s mol '). For a mass transport controlled process this reaction rate will be limited by the rate of transport of the electroactive species to the electrode surface:

i-A = nFN,,-A

(2.11)

In this equation i represents the current density, A is the electrode area, n is the number of electrons and N,, is the flux of species O as given in Equation (2.8a). The flux of species O from the bulk of the liquid to the boundary layer is due to convective transport and is given by the following expression:

N .= k ,{c :-c J

(2.12)

Therefore combining equation (2.11) with equation (2.12) illustrates the relationship between the current and mass transfer (or mass transport coefficient):

(2.13)

In this expression,

represents the instantaneous current density at time t. When the

rate of transport is sufficient enough to provide electroactive species to the electrode surface the concentration at the surface, C os, will be zero indicating a fast reaction. In this case the process is under complete mass transport control at which point the mass transfer coefficient becomes known as the limiting mass transfer coefficient:

For electrochemical processes the Sherwood number can also be expressed by substituting the limiting current as this is a function of the mass transfer coefficient:

Sh=

nFc:D

(2.15)

Average mass transfer coefficient could be obtained through direct measurement of the limiting current. This approach is applicable if the bulk concentration, c ~ , does not change appreciable throughout the reactor. In such situations, a current density versus electrode overpotential graph results, also known as a voltamogram. An idealized voltamogram is presented in Figure 2.1. A well behaved voltamogram would produce a distinct plateau as in the figure. At this point the limiting current is reached. Applying greater potential will eventually lead to unwanted side reactions, such as hydrogen evolution. Prior to reaching the limiting current plateau, the system is in a state of mixed control where both mass transfer and charge transfer occur. Charge transfer relates to the kinetics of the reaction A slow electrode reaction produces slow charge transfer. The treatment of dilute aqueous streams requires that the bulk concentrations become reduced in the electroactive species so that limiting current is not reached under typical operating conditions. In such situations, voltammetric method is not applicable. Another

approach to obtaining the average mass transfer coefficient is through concentration decay measurements of the electroactive species such as that encountered in typical batch reactors.

2.1.2

Mass transfer studies for dilute solutions The wastewaters generated from such industries as electroplating produce wastewater

with the presence of heavy metals such as zinc and nickel. Due to increasing stricter legislation for effluent discharge the permissible concentration of metal ions has been greatly decreased as previously mentioned in Introduction. The use of electrochemical means can be used to meet discharge limits. As these wastewaters are dilute in concentration (i.e. at most 1000 ppm of the heavy metal), the processes are mass transport limited. At very low concentrations, the rate of mass transport controlled processes greatly decreases. Further, at very low concentrations typically below 0.05 ppm electrolysis is no longer economical due to increased time for treatment and large space-time yields [6 ]. The space-time yield is a measure of reactor performance as it expresses the mass of product that could be obtained per unit time per unit reactor volume [14]. The space-time yield of the reactor could be improved by enhancing the

14

Literature Review

mass transport through agitation of the liquid, and by increasing electrode surface area through the use of porous electrodes. The configuration of electrochemical reactors can be classified according to the geometry of the electrodes; two dimensional such as a flat plate, or three-dimensional such as a packed bed or foam type material. A review of some typical cell designs typically used for industrial applications can be found in the literature [6,8,14].

2.1.2.1 Flat plate electrodes and improving mass transport
Two-dimensional flat plate electrodes are used in conjunction with some means of turbulence promotion. This includes forced solution flow through or along the electrode, rotation of the electrode and gas bubble evolution on the electrode [9]. A typical electrochemical configuration is of the filter-press type. Usual means of increasing mass transport are through the use of a plastic mesh or fluidized inert particles [6 ]. Some current studies concerned with increasing mass transport for two-dimensional electrodes can be divided based on either static or dynamic operation. The first case includes the use of turbulence promoters on static electrodes whereas the second case includes agitation of the electrolyte through vibration of the electrodes. Turbulence promoters were studied by Subbaiah et al. [18]. Their work focused on mass transfer studies using displaced rectangular plate promoters in an electrolytic cell with flat plate electrodes. According to their research, the majority of studies at the time were focused on cylindrical and spherical promoters. Figure 2.2 depicts their experimental arrangement. Under forced convective flow the improvement in the mass transfer coefficient was four times that under natural convection. It was determined that under forced convective flow the overall mass transfer coefficient varied with the velocity with an exponent of 0.13 for a range of Reynolds number between 100 and 1000. The characteristic length was based on the hydraulic diameter of the flow channel, which was essentially the dimension of the electro cell. The use of rectangular turbulence promoters was more effective than the curved surface offered by cylindrical promoters.

Oduoza and Wragg [19] also employed turbulence promoters, but instead of having them attached on the bottom of the electro-cell as was done by Subbaiah et al. [18], rectangular baffles were placed on the frame of the electro-cell. This placement also created a "serpentine flow path." Their study also examined the effect of baffle length on the overall mass transfer coefficient. Figure 2.3 depicts a schematic diagram of their apparatus with nickel flat plates as electrodes. It was concluded that a longer baffle length increased the mass transfer coefficient. The dimensionless correlation obtained indicated a Reynolds number exponent of 0.6 for the range of 2500-20000 based on the hydraulic diameter. Other researchers [20,21] have examined the effect that moving electrodes through vibrations have on mass transfer. Buso et al. [20] studied the effect of agitation level on the removal of iodine, by using reciprocating sieve-plate electrodes. It was concluded that the agitation level does increase mass transfer coefficient. Agitation of electrolyte by means of vibrating the electrodes was also studied by Panizza et al. in [21]. In this study, multiple

vibrating flat plate electrodes were used to investigate the effect of removal efficiency of copper from industrial wastewater. They examined the effect that flow rate has on the removal efficiency of copper from which it was concluded that flow rate influenced residence time rather than mass transport. The reduction of the copper to meet discharge limits was unattainable even though multiple flat plates would increase the available surface for deposition and increased agitation of the electrolyte caused by the vibration of electrodes would seem to increase mass transport. Consequently, they decided to study three-dimensional electrodes due to the higher electroactive area available for treating dilute solutions [2 1 ].

2.1.2.2 Porous Electrodes
The removal of heavy metal ions from dilute aqueous streams using porous electrodes has been discussed frequently in the literature. There is a broad definition for the term porous encountered in the literature. This term can refer to a packed bed of particles or intermeshing elements as in steel wool, a regular array of electrodes as in perforated plates; or, a continuous porous matrix as in reticulated materials of carbon or metal [14].

17

Literature Review

The generation of current in electrochemical cells using porous electrodes, typically in the packed-bed arrangement, can be classified as either flow-by in which the current is perpendicular to the flow of electrolyte; or, flow-through in which the current is parallel to the flow of electrolyte. The use of three-dimensional, porous electrodes offers a large specific surface area relative to two-dimensional, planar electrodes. A variety of material has been employed for porous electrodes. These include metallic foams [22-26], reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) [27-32], carbon and graphite felts [33-37], packed beds of either nickel or graphite [38,39], nickel felts [40], iron felts [41,42], stacked nets or screens [43-45] or carbon cloth [46,47].

2.1.2.2.1 Reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) Reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) is a trademark material characterized as an open pore material with a honeycomb structure composed of vitreous carbon. RVC is currently manufactured by ERG Aerospace and Materials of California. In general, vitreous carbon is a glass-like carbon that combines some of the properties of glass with some of those of industrial grade carbon [48,49]. The use of RVC as an electrode material was surveyed by Wang [50] in terms of its physical, chemical, and electrochemical characteristics. Some of the earlier studies on the use of RVC as an electrode material were performed by Wang and Dewald [51] and by Agarwal and co-workers [52]. Wang and Dewald [51] showed the feasibility of RVC as a cathode in a flow-through configuration for the removal of Cu^^, Ag^"^, and Pb^^ with initial concentrations of 10'^ M. In the case of Cu^\ 99% removal was achieved. Agarwal et al. [52] used RVC in a flow-through configuration for the removal of copper, cadmium, chromium, lead, uranium, and zinc from dilute aqueous streams. Their studies indicated that use of RVC leads to high current efficiencies and high rates of mass transfer. For zinc removal, 50 pM ZnS 0 4 solution was used in which
1 0 0

% metal deposition was achieved after five times of recirculation

through the electro-cell at a flow rate of 2 2 ml-min'*.

Literature Review

2.1.2.2.2 Use of porous electrodes for the removal of heavy metals The first use of porous electrodes in the application for the removal of heavy metals from dilute aqueous streams was performed by Bennion and Newman [53] in 1972. In their research they used a porous flow-through fixed-bed of graphite chips for removal of copper ions from dilute solutions. Since then, the technique has been applied to a variety of electro cell configurations such as filter-press type or packed bed
[6

and 9]; and for the removal of a

variety of metallic ions such as copper, mercury, lead, zinc, and nickel, to name just a few. One of the main disadvantages to the use of packed-bed electrodes is due to the possibility of large spatial electrode potential variations that can cause a loss of reaction selectivity [54]. In a study by Pickett and Stanmore [54], a single layer packed-bed electrode was used as a means of overcoming this problem through the deposition of copper from copper sulfate medium. Although removal efficiencies were not stated, their study did indicate small enough variations in potential that selectivity was ensured. In the previous study by Panizza et al. [21] on the removal of copper ions from industrial effluent fiat plate electrodes were found to be ineffective on meeting copper discharge limits. In a subsequent study, Panizza et al. [25] used porous electrodes of polyurethane foam coated with a thin layer of copper. In this study batch-recycle mode was used in which they were able to reduce the initial copper concentration by 98% operating at the highest flow rate. Other researchers have also demonstrated success in the removal of copper using porous electrodes. Simonsson [39] utilized a particulate bed electrode composed of graphite grains to reduce copper from a copper sulfate solution from an initial copper concentration of 67 mg r ' to a final concentration of 0.03 mg l '\ Pak et al. [55] investigated the mass transfer of copper electrodeposition using polyurethane coated with nickel as a cathode. A removal efficiency of 99% was reached under a batch-recycle mode of operation. Hor and Mohamed [56] examined the feasibility of removing copper from electroplating rinse water. Their process was different than those previously mention in that a galvanic process was used as opposed to an electrolytic one. A galvanic process is one in which the Gibbs free energy change is negative indicating a spontaneous process. Spontaneity was achieved based on the spontaneous reaction between a copper-iron couple. Hor and

19

Literature Review

Mohamed [56] used RVC (80 ppi) and a porous graphite sheet as cathode materials. It was determined that the RVC was more suitable as an electrode material. For the treatment of a real wastewater sample with an initial concentration of 74.2 mg l ' of Cu^\ 80.2% removal was achieved for a single-pass through the reactor operating at the highest flow rate. The use of porous electrodes for the removal of mercury ions was successfully demonstrated by Matlosz and Newman [57] and Grau and Bisang [41]. All employed different materials for their electrodes. Matlosz and Newman [57] used a flow-through electrode cylinder of RVC to act as a porous-bed cathode for the removal of Hg^^ from brine solutions. They were able to reduce the initial concentration of 55 ppm to 0.018 ppm Hg^'*'. Grau and Bisang [41] used iron felt in a flow-through cell. In this study the iron felt acted as a reducing agent so that the process occurred spontaneously with no intervention of an external power supply to drive the reaction. A reduction of Hg^^ from 100 ppm to approximately 0.07 ppm was achieved. RVC was successfully used as a cathode material by Ponce de Leon and Fletcher [31] and Widner et al. [58] for removal of lead ions. Ponce de Leon and Fletcher [31] used a flowby configuration in removing lead from various pH 2 solutions. Widner et al. [58] employed a flow-through configuration. Removal rates were better at higher flow rates and cathode porosities. In all cases, a reduction of Pb^^ from an average concentration of 46 mg dm'^ to 0.1 mg-dm'^ was reached. Removal of zinc ions by using RVC has already proven to be successful by Agarwal et al. [52]. Lanza and Bertazzoli [28] also used RVC as a cathode in the removal of zinc from an aqueous zinc chloride medium under batch recycle operation. Reduction of zinc from 50 to 0.1 mg-dm'^ was reported. On the other hand, in the study by Simonsson [39], use of a graphite bed electrode was used to achieve 99% reduction of zinc ions from a zinc sulfate solution with potassium sulfate acting as the supporting electrolyte. The removal of nickel ions using porous electrodes has also been investigated. Njau and co-workers [59]. Electrode materials consisting of a bed of graphite particles, RVC, and a stack of expanded nickel sheets were used. It was observed that the low porosity offered by the bed of graphite particles became blocked over longer treatment times. It was concluded that electrodes with a high porosity and having large pores were advantageous for nickel removal. In another study, Njau et al. [60] examined the behaviour of a gas diffusion electrode (serving

20

Literature Review

as the anode) and packed bed electrode (serving as the cathode) cell for the removal of nickel ions. The cathode was composed of a stack of expanded nickel gauzes. Penetration depth studies on a three expanded gauzes indicated that approximately 90% of the deposit occurred on the first gauze while less than
1 0

% occurred on the rear gauze attached to the current

collector plate. It was concluded that in this case the porous electrode behaved as a planar electrode and provided no industrial advantage. The previous discussions in this section were all examples of using stationary threedimensional electrodes. An example of a dynamic three-dimensional electrode was that used by Orhan et al. [61] who employed a rotating packed cell of metal granules for the removal of nickel ions. The rotation of the electrolysis cell combined with the increase in surface area of the granules provided an increase to mass transfer. A 90% reduction in nickel concentration was reported.

2.1.2.2.3 Mass transfer studies using porous electrodes As porous electrodes have proved to be effective in the removal of heavy metal ions from dilute aqueous streams, numerous published literature as those studies just discussed have also reported on mass transfer correlations for these electrodes. These correlations were in the form of a power expression as given by Equation (2.9). The porous electrodes encountered in the literature for the present study have indicated packed-bed configurations. The difference was in the choice of materials, for example; granules of varying size to foam-type materials of varying porosity. The trend of the exponent on the Reynolds numbers for these studies indicated similar range of values. For electro-cells with packed-bed configuration typical values for the exponent, under the laminar region are between 0.3 to 0.5; while under turbulent flow region the values are between 0.45 to 0.8 [63]. A summary of these correlations for flow-by and flow-through configurations can be found in Appendix 1.

Biological Treatment

2.2.1

Theoretical considerations
The biological oxidation of organic matter depends on the type of microorganisms

used, the supply of oxygen for the microbes in the case of aerobic degradation, and the type of organic matter or substrate. Typically the organic matter present in industrial wastewaters is composed of numerous compounds having similar characteristics so that analysis for a single compound may not be possible. Therefore aggregate quantities are used to characterize the strength of the wastewater. Two of the most common are the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD). These are used to measure gross concentrations of organic matter greater than
1 .0

mg l ' [ 1 2 ].

The most frequently used parameter of organic pollution is the 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5 ). This parameter involves the measurement of dissolved oxygen (DO) used by microorganisms as they biologically oxidize the organic matter. If enough dissolved oxygen is present, the decomposition of the organic pollutant will continue until all the waste is consumed. The COD parameter is used to measure the oxygen equivalent of organic material that can be oxidized by strong chemical oxidizers such as potassium dichromate or potassium permanganate. As oxidation is achieved by chemical rather than biological means, organic matter that is not readily biodegradable will be oxidized by these substances. Therefore, COD parameter represents complete oxidation, and as such will have a higher value than that of BOD5.

2.2.1.1 Biodégradation mechanism
Whether biochemical oxidation occurs through a BOD 5 test or in an aerated packed column, the microorganisms responsible for the degradation of the organic matter require the use of oxygen and substrate for energy production, and the formation of new cell mass. The biodégradation process generally consists of the following steps [ 1 2 ]:

In Equation (2.16a) COHNS, represents organic waste throughthe elements of carbon, C, oxygen, O, hydrogen, H, nitrogen, N, and sulfur, S.

(2.16c)

For the organic matter to be utilized by the microbes, the matter must be in a form for which the microbes can oxidize it and thereby use it as energy and for the formation of new cells. This occurs by a breakdown in the organic matter into smaller molecules that can then be readily handled by the microbes. This breakdown is dependent on the nature of the organic matter, and the concentration of the microbial mass. The transport of substrate depends on the rate at which it is transferred from bulk liquid to the surface of biofilm, and on its transport within the biofilm from subsequent consumption.

23

Literature Review

2.2.1.2 The biofilm
A biofilm can be considered as a highly hydrated biological structure attached to a support, composed of microorganisms, extra cellular polymeric substances, as well as abiotic particles captured from the liquid stream and incorporated within the film [64]. Based on this definition, a biofilm can be considered like a porous catalyst for which modeling of diffusion and reaction is similar to those encountered in porous catalytic reactions. Therefore, three main steps occur for the transport of substrate to the microbes [64]:

1

. external mass transport of the substrate from the bulk of the liquid stream to the surface of the biofilm and subsequent diffusion through the diffusion layer;

2

. internal mass transport by diffusion of the substrate within the biofilm;

3. biochemical reaction of the substrate by the microorganisms

The transport of substrates from the outside of the biofilm to the inside is driven by concentration gradients, with the concentration gradient in the biofilm much less than that encountered on the outside. Therefore, the rate of substrate utilization and cell growth are not uniform, but depend on the cell's location with the biofilm [64]. The diffusion of substrate occurs through vertical and horizontal pores present on the biofilm [64]. The growth of the biofilm does not occur indefinitely. When turbulence is high, pressure fluctuations can exert axial forces to the biofilm surface [65]. Additional forces caused by abrasion from particle-to-particle collisions can also have an affect.

2.2.1.3 External mass transfer
The hydrodynamic regime, biofilm surface geometry, substrate loading rates, and diffusivities can affect the rate of external mass transport [6 6 ]. The mass transport of nutrients from the bulk liquid can sometimes control the growth of biofilm as the rate of nutrient uptake by the microorganisms is faster than the rate of mass transport. The growth of the biofilm and metabolic activity within the biofilm are then controlled by the rate of diffusion of nutrients through the film [67]. Therefore, conditions that improve the rate of mass transport of nutrients and substrate to the biofilm surface would seem advantageous as the organic material is

24

Literature Review

consumed at a faster rate. However, the biofilm will also inerease in thickness with time. This will result in an increase in the diffusional resistance of the nutrients, which control the rate of metabolism in the inner portions of the biofilm [67]. The development of a thicker biofilm is also subject to greater shear forces leading to more biofilm detachment as previously mentioned [67]. Two resistances to mass transport arise; one is caused by the external diffusional layer and the second due to internal diffusional resistance [67]. The flux of substrate and oxygen across the liquid-biofilm interface can be expressed through the following typieal relationship:

W ,= t,(c - - C j)

(2.17)

In Equation (2.17), Na represents the molar flux of substrate, and kc is the average mass transfer coefficient of the substrate in the bulk liquid. Generally, it is accepted that roughness under any conditions has a favourable effeet on mass transfer [6 8 ]. This was observed for studies of mass transfer in a rough pipe. However, Picioreanu et al. [6 8 ] have shown that a larger surface created by the rough biofilm leads to poor convective transport within the "valleys" of the biofilm surface. They also indieated that the biofilm "peaks" are exposed to high coneentration gradients which lead to high local mass transfer coefficients. In contrast, the substrate flux in "valleys" leads to low local mass transfer coefficient [6 8 ]. On an average, the flux enhaneement gained in "peak" regions ean be completely lost in "valleys" [6 8 ]. It was shown that Sherwood number values for a fiat biofilm were larger than those for a rough surface. The external resistances to mass transfer as taken into account by the mass transfer coefficient in Equation (2.17) should not only include the hydrodynamic conditions but also the biofilm geometry and surface characteristics. These factors are correlated through an average Sherwood number that may display the following functional relationship [6 8 ]:

Sh = Sh (Re, Sc, ç)^, K, geometric ratios)

(2.18)

In the above relationship, < p ^ is the Thiele number, which represents a measure for the ratio of a surface reaction rate to the rate of diffusion through a catalyst pellet [62]. In this case

the biofilm is assumed to be like that of a catalyst; and K represents a Monod constant. Also, in the above relationship, geometric ratio term takes into account the non-uniformity of biomass layer. The geometric ratios include depth of biofilm valleys and distance between biofilm peaks [6 8 ].

2.2.1.4

Oxygen transfer
Aeration in a packed-column bioreactor involves the transfer of oxygen from air to the

liquid stream. The steps that describe oxygen transport in a three-phase bioreactor are as follows [4]:

· convective gas flow in the packed bed · transfer of oxygen from the gas phase to the liquid phase (Since oxygen is slightly soluble in water it is assumed that the major resistance to mass transfer is due to the liquid phase) · transfer of oxygen across the biofilm surface from the liquid phase · reaction and diffusion within the biofilm

The first two steps represent the aeration process for the wastewater stream. As oxygen is slightly soluble in water, the main resistance to the transfer of oxygen from the gas phase into the liquid phase is that from liquid. The flux of oxygen across the gas-liquid interface is described by the following typical expression:

N = - D ,^ = k, (c,-c-) ay

(2.19)

In the above expression k,^ represents the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen based on the liquid side, Cj represents the oxygen concentration at saturation that would be in equilibrium with air and c"" represents bulk liquid oxygen concentration. From Equation (2.19) the rate of oxygen transfer per unit volume of the packed bed aerator can also be obtained:

2.2.2

Packed beds for bioloeical treatment The use of fixed bed reactors has been shown to be effective in the treatment of

biodegradable organic matter [4,12,64]. The earliest fixed-bed process was that of a trickling filter in England in the 1890s [12]. Rocks served as the packing material for these reactors. Since the 1950s, however, plastic material has been used in the US [12]. The general operation of the trickling filter entails the flow of wastewater over the packing medium with aeration provided by the natural air draft due to the temperature difference between the ambient air and the air in the column. Relying on a temperature difference to induce air flow can cause problems as the temperature difference can be negligible so that there is minimal to no air flow. This can lead to loss of treatment efficiency, losses of biofilm due to slougbing and odours [12]. To overcome the reliance on a temperature difference, forced-air ventilation can be used. The use of forced-air flow is also a means of providing continued aeration to allow for sufficient oxygen transfer to the biofilm. More recent (ca. 1970s and 1980s) advances to the trickling filter concept are the use of packed-beds that are completely submerged with either up-flow or down-fiow operation [12]. This operation offers complete wetting of the packing, longer contact time and high oxygen mass transfer [69]. In addition to increased oxygen transfer, a packed-bed is effective in treating dilute wastewater [ 1 2 ]. A significant feature of all attached growth processes is its mass transfer limitations. As mentioned in Sub-section 2.2.1.1, substrate removal occurs within the biofilm. The performance of a biofilm process is dependent on diffusional limitations.

27

Literature Review

2.2.2.1 Fixed-bed bioreactor studies
The work by Deront et al. [69] used a completely submerged up-flow packed bed with co-current aeration to develop a correlation for small packings with low Reynolds numbers; for gases this was in the range of Re 0.197 to 0.593, and for liquids the Re range was 3.875 to 9.315. The use of co-current operation was selected as it was noted by the authors to have more suitable water and air distribution thereby making treatment more efficient through better use of the reactor volume. In another study by Deront et al. [70] using a completely submerged packed-bed, the biokinetic and mass transfer parameters were estimated through segmentation of the column. Their view was that biological parameters were generally determined with suspensions of microorganisms grown in stirred tanks, which resulted in parameters different than that encountered in fixed biofilm applications. Their study was successful in estimating such parameters as the oxygen mass transfer coefficient and oxygen diffusion coefficient within a biofilm. Brinke-Seiferth et al. [71] studied a biofilm filter sequencing batch reactor that could act as both a fiuidized-bed and fixed bed. The fiuidized-bed mode of operation was appropriate for high concentration of organic matter and for nitrification. The fixed-bed mode could be used to treat low concentration or residual compounds and was also applicable for nitrification. It was noted for fixed-bed operation there is the occurrence of a stagnant volume of water in the column that will affect the rate of reaction since a part of the biofilm surface is not being used. It was also noted that increasing the air or water superficial velocity beyond a specific limit would result in a reduction in the reaction rate for nitrification. An increase in the air flow rate was seen to create larger bubbles that were not broken down at increased liquid flow rates. In order for successful nitrification in a packed-bed process the use of fine bubble aeration would be required at high liquid superficial velocities to ensure adequate oxygen transfer. The removal of BOD in a counter-current packed bed bioreactor was shown to be effective by Doan et al. [11]. A dilute concentration on the order of 200 ppm propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) was selected as a model pollutant from an electro-coating process, where it was demonstrated that BOD could be reduced to 70% after four days of treatment compared with 10% removal from a stagnant tank. When compared to natural draft operation as in a trickling filter, 40% BOD removal was obtained. It was also noted that the effect of airflow rate did not have a significant effect on the removal of BOD.

28

Literature Review

An up-flow submerged packed bed reactor was used by Cannon et al. [72] for the removal of concentrated BOD 5 (3000 to 5000 mg-l'*) and nitrification of wastewater generated from a dairy farm. It was demonstrated that the process was well suited for the nitrification in a farming context but was less appropriate if the principle application is for bulk BOD 5 removal. A comparison was made between a packed bed and an empty column in which it was shown that after certain retention time both reactors provided similar effluent BOD 5 values. At shorter retention times the effluent BOD 5 for the packed bed case was shown to be inconsistent with poor removal efficiency. The poor performance in the packed bed at high loading rates was attributed to congestion in the bed causing a reduction in retention time and also a reduction in active surface area. These results exemplify that submerged packed-bed reactors are advantageous towards treating dilute wastewaters [12,71]. The use of a double-layer submerged aerated filter was studied by Osorio and Hontoria [73]. The top layer was a ceramic material and the bottom layer was polyethylene beads. It was mentioned that ceramic-based materials provided for good adsorption and filtering capacity while the plastic material was advantageous in reducing energy consumption during the baekwashing stages encountered in submerged paeked-bed filters. It was shown that operation in counter-current flow was more effective than co-current operation in removing total BOD 5 and suspended solids. When the column operated only with ceramic material approximately 72% reduction in total BOD 5 was achieved. When combined with the plastic packing material approximately 90% reduction resulted.

EXPERIMENTAL

3.1

Experimental Apparatus
The experimental apparatus used is presented in Figure 3.1. The packed column, electro

cell and holding tank were constructed from PVC. The apparatus operated in batch recirculation with counter-current flow of wastewater entering the top of the packed column and air entering the bottom of the column. The wastewater would then flow into the electro cell from the bottom of the packed column. A cylindrical weir was placed in the center of the electro-cell which allowed the wastewater to remain in the c e llJb c a certain residence time. The wastewater would flow from the weir to the holding tank. For experimental runs requiring a higher liquid volumetric flux greater than 0.00915 m^ m'^ s '\ the weir was made inoperable by placing a plastic cap over the opening. Instead, orifices were drilled at the bottom of the electro-cell. A typical arrangement of the orifices is presented in Figure 3.2. A by-pass line leading back to the holding tank from the outlet of the holding tank was used to provide for mixing in the tank as well as to regulate the liquid flow rate. Upon exiting the holding tank the wastewater would flow through a heat exchanger. This was used to maintain the temperature of the wastewater around 25°C for all runs. The wastewater would then flow to the top of the packed column thus completing the hydraulic circuit.

3.1.1 Packed column
The column had an internal diameter of 15.0 cm and a height of 55.0 cm. The bed depth was 12.5 cm, and consisted of hollow plastic spheres with a diameter of 1.3 cm. Filtered compressed air from a laboratory bench was used. A variable area direct reading flowmeter (Blue White Ind., Westmister, CA) was used to measure the air flow rate having a range of readings from 0 to 320 scfh. A variable area direct reading flowmeter (Hedland®, Racine, WI) was also used for liquid flow measurement with a range of 0 to 2 0 1/min.

Electro-cell The electro-cell had an internal diameter of 15.0 cm and a height of 10.0 cm. The

diameter of the weir was 5.5 cm and a height of 8.0 cm. The main characteristics of the electrodes are presented in Table 3.1. In a preliminary study [73], the material selected for the anode was RVC (ERG Aerospace and Materials, CA). However, after about 15 days of use it became brittle. Therefore, stainless steel (SS) was chosen as an anode material. A porous SS anode was constructed in-house. A 4-mesh size AISI 316 SS and AISI 316 SS netting were used. The netting was specific for electrowinning applications and was supplied by Microwire, Toronto, Ontario. The stainless steel netting was

sandwiched between the two stainless steel meshes. Sixteen layers of netting were used. The anode was compressed to a thickness of
1 .2

cm and the resulting sandwich held in place by

stainless steel tie wires at the four comers of the electrode. The current feeder consisted of a stainless steel tie wire extending from the top of the electrode. This tie wire was located approximately at the mid point of the top end of the electrode and inserted into the stainless steel netting. The placement of the electrodes in the electro-cell is presented in the following figure.

The cathode was aluminum foam [75] (ERG Aerospace and Materials, CA) with a grade of 20 pores per inch (ppi). An aluminum base plate/current collector was attached to the 11 cm edge of the electrode. The surface area of the cathode was determined from the manufacture's literature [75]. A graph of specific surface area in ft^-ff^ versus density was used to determine the surface area for a 20 ppi foam. The density of the aluminum foam had a relative density of 3%. A Heathkit regulated power supply (model IP-27) was used to maintain a voltage of 10 V. A Sargent-Welch ammeter was connected in series for current measurement.

3.1.3 Solutions Zinc sulfate heptahydrate and nickel sulfate hexahydrate (BDH Chemicals and J.T. Baker) were used to make the simulated wastewater with zinc and nickel ion concentrations of 20ppm. Potassium sulfate (J.T. Baker) was used for the supporting electrolyte at a concentration of 500 ppm. For runs with biological treatment, 200 ppm of propylene glycol methyl ether (POME) was used. Adjustment to pH of the simulated wastewater was done by adding 1.0 M potassium hydroxide (J.T. Baker).

3.3.2

Samvlins Plan
The simulated wastewater in the experimental apparatus was allowed to mix for at least

30 minutes for those runs with electrochemical treatment and approximately 24 hours for those undergoing biological treatment. Approximately 100 ml grab samples were obtained from the holding tank for those runs undergoing combined biological and electrochemical treatment. Also for those runs with combined treatment 80 ml samples were taken from the electro-cell. Only 80 ml samples were obtained from the holding tank for those runs in which sole electrochemical treatment was employed. Samples were obtained over a 24 hour period for duration of 3 days. For those runs employing biological treatment as well, samples were also obtained at the
8

hour and 32 hour

intervals. For those runs with electrochemical treatment, samples were also taken at two hour intervals during the first
8

hours of treatment.

Samples were collected in clean 100 ml beakers. Analysis was performed immediately upon obtaining the sample. Analysis of the wastewater samples was performed in accordance with the Standard Methods [76]:

3.3.3 Activities prior to exyerimental runs
Before any experimental work was started a check was performed to ascertain the quality of the deionized water. Results of the quality check are presented in Table 3.4. Prior to any experimental runs the apparatus was cleaned with deionized water. Deionized water was flushed through the system for at least 1 hour and then drained.

37

Experimental

Experimental runs that required electrochemical treatment electrodes were cleaned prior to the run. The stainless steel anode was brushed with a steel brush to remove any loose deposits. The anode was then rinsed with deionized water and allowed to dry. The aluminum cathode was cleaned by soaking in an acetic acid bath of pH 2.5 for approximately 15 minutes. In reference [46] a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) cathode was stripped of any deposits by soaking in 1:1 molar aqueous nitric acid for 60 minutes. For the present study the stability of the aluminum foam was uncertain if exposed to such an acid, so that acetic acid was selected as a means of lowering the pH sufficiently to allow for the redissolution of any electrically deposited metal during the previous run. The cathode was then washed with tap water and rinsed with deionized water and allowed to dry. All glassware was cleaned before any run and before samples were taken. Glassware was cleaned by using a mild detergent, followed by at least three rinses with tap water, then a final rinse with deionized water. Seed solution used for BOD measurements was prepared a day before the run. One Polyseed® capsule was added to a clean, dry 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing a magnetic stir bar. 500 ml of deionized water was added to the flask. The seed solution was then mechanically stirred and aerated for at least 5 hours. The aerated seed solution was then stoppered and placed in the incubator at 20±1°C. The seed solution was used for the duration of a run. The dilution water used for BOD measurements was aerated deionized water. Approximately 3 liters of deionized water was added to a clean, dry 4 liter Erlenmeyer flask. Filtered, compressed air was bubbled into the water for at least 30 minutes using Tygon tubing. Prior to inserting the tubing into the water, it was cleaned with a mild detergent and tap water, and then rinsed with deionized water. During the aeration period the dilution water was placed in a cold-water bath to maintain the temperature at 20±1°C.

3.3.4 Preparation o f simulated wastewater
The simulated wastewater used for biological treatment had a concentration of 200ppm propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) and 4 Polyseed ® capsules. For combined treatment the wastewater also contained 20 ppm zinc ions, 20 ppm nickel ions and 500 ppm potassium sulfate. For electrochemical treatment only, the simulated wastewater had 20 ppm of zinc, 20 ppm of nickel ions, and 500 ppm potassium sulfate. The volume of simulated wastewater used for any experimental run was 35 liters. The wastewater was prepared a day in advance of a run. This was especially required for acclimation of the seed to their environment for such parameters as pH, temperature, organic concentration, heavy metal concentration, and the packing structure. A concentration of 100 ppm PGME was used during this acclimation period. When biological treatment was not employed preparation of the wastewater was also performed a day in advance. The heavy metals portion of the simulated wastewater was prepared separately in a 4 liter Erlenmeyer flask. For 20 ppm zinc ion concentration, 3.076 g were weighed and added to the flask. This mass of zinc heptahydrate actually gave a concentration in the order of 40 ppm zinc ions. Possible loss of the hydrated water due to evaporation from the crystal structure of this reagent may have occurred. For 20-ppm nickel ion concentration, 3.172 g of nickel hexahydrate were weighed and added to the flask. 17.5 g of potassium sulfate was required for 500-ppm concentration. Approximately two liters of deionized water was added to the flask. The content was then stirred to dissolve the solutes. This was then added to the holding tank of the apparatus. The biological portion of the simulated wastewater was prepared in another 4 liter Erlenmeyer flask. Four Polyseed® capsules were added to two liters of deionized water. To determine the volume of propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) required for a concentration of 200-ppm, a 25 ml pycnometer calibrated at 20" C was used to determine the density of PGME. From this measurement, a calculated volume of 7.65 ml for PGME was used. Due to the acclimation period 3.83 ml of PGME was added to the seed solution. This was then added to the holding tank. On the day of a run an additional 3.83 ml was added to the holding tank for a total concentration of 200-ppm PGME. Approximately 30 minutes was allowed to ensure complete mixing for the additional PGME.

Experimental

3.3.5 Activities during an exyerimental run

3.3.5.1 Heavy metals concentration measurement
The concentration of heavy metals was measured for runs with combined treatment and sole electrochemical treatment. The concentration of zinc and nickel was measured using the Orbeco-Hellige spectrophotometer. The zincon method was used for the detection of zinc. The procedure followed for this method was that provided by the manufacturer (model 975 PM Orbeco-Hellige, Farmingdale, New York). According to the manufacture's literature the detection range for zinc in this method was 0 to 4 mg l ' at a wavelength of 640 nm. Dimethylgloxime (Heptoxime) method was used for the detection of nickel. The procedure for this method was that provided by the manufacturer (Orbeco-Hellige). The detection range for nickel was 0 to 0.12 mg l ' at a wavelength of 528 nm according to the manufacture's literature.

3.3.5.2 Dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements
For BOD 5 determination dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements were performed on diluted wastewater samples. 100 ml sample was collected from the holding tank. The sample was then stirred. 300 ml BOD bottles were used in which aliquots of the sample were taken according to the following schedule:

Experimental

One of each of the above aliquots was prepared. To each of the aliquots, 10 ml of seed solution from Sub-section 3.3.3 with the remaining volume filled with the dilution water from section 3.3. Dissolved oxygen readings were taken once any visible air bubbles had disappeared. Upon completion of the measurement the BOD bottle was topped up with dilution water and stoppered. A tin foil "cap" was than placed over the stopper. The bottle with sample was then incubated (Incubator VWR) at 20±1° C for a period of 5 days. One seed control of 10 ml and a blank were also prepared. These were also incubated at 20±1° C for a period of 5 days. The same batches of 4 BOD bottles were used for each interval for all runs. After the 5-day incubation period the final dissolved oxygen for each was measured. The BOD for each interval was calculated by the following expression [77]:

Prior to any dissolved oxygen measurements, the probe was calibrated according to the manufacturers (YSI, Inc.) instructions. The determination of the ultimate BOD was made by using a 30 ml sample with 10 ml seed solution from Sub-section 3.3.3. A seed control of 10 ml and blank were also prepared. DO measurements were performed in the same manner as for 5-day BOD, however, DO measurements were performed on a two to three day interval for a period of 60 days. After this, less frequent measurements were made, typically five to seven day intervals. The BOD for every interval was calculated by using an accumulated DO value according to the following expression:

day, and the dissolved oxygen reading of the diluted seed sample at the present

day measurement, respectively. Re-aeration of the diluted sample was performed when the DO reading was approximately 2 mg-f* [77].

3.3.5.3 Chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurements
The sample collected for DO measurements from Section 3.3.5.2 was also used for COD. The COD determination was a closed reflux colorimetric method. The procedure for this method was followed according to the manufactures (Orbeco-Hellige, Farmingdale, New York) instructions. The method was for mid-range COD concentrations in the range of 20 to 900 mg-r* at a wavelength of 608 nm. At least 30 minutes prior to COD measurement, the COD digestor (Bioscience, Inc.) was turned on to achieve a temperature of 150 ± 2°C. The wastewater sample was filtered to remove any biofilm or other organic matter present that would result in a positive bias of the COD results. Vacuum filtration with a Buchner funnel and low ash 32 Whatman filter paper was used. 2.5 ml of the filtered sample was added to the COD vials (Bioscience, Inc.) and heated at 150 ± 2°C for 2 hours. Upon cooling to room temperature the COD concentration was determined. As the COD readings appeared to fluctuate it was difficult to obtain an accurate reading. Therefore multiple readings were obtained, any outlier values were discarded, and an average COD concentration was calculated. To ensure the spectrophotometer (Orbeco-Hellige) was providing reliable results, a COD calibration curve was established. A 1000 ppm COD standard, hydrogen pthalate solution was made, from which dilutions of 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 ppm were prepared. 2.5 ml of each dilution were added to separate COD vials and digested for 2 hrs. A PhramaciaUltraspec III UY-YIS spectrophotometer was then used to prepare the calibration curve at an optimal wavelength of 605 nm from the digested dilutions.

Experimental

3.3.S.4 pH and Conductivity measurements
The pH of the sample was measured with a Coming 220 pH meter. The meter was calibrated on a daily basis using buffers of 4 and 7. A wastewater pH range of
6

to 6.5 was

desired for combined treatment. This required the addition of 1.0 M potassium hydroxide. Typically 30 to 35 ml was used over the course of a run. The conductivity of the sample was measured with a YSI 3200 conductivity meter. The meter was calibrated as per the manufacturer's instructions at the start of a run using a 1407.8 pS-cm'* standard solution.

3.3.6

Viscosity calculation
The dynamic viscosity of the simulated wastewater was calculated from the method

described in [78] for multicomponent electrolytic solutions. Microsoft Excel® was used to calculate the dynamic viscosity. A discussion on the calculation of the dynamic viscosity can be found in Appendix 2. The viscosity of the simulated wastewater for sole biological treatment was assumed to be that of water at the prevailing experimental temperature of around 25°C

3.3.7 Diffusivity calculation
The diffusion coefficient was calculated by the method developed by Anderko and Lenka [79]. This method described the calculation of the self-diffusion coefficient for multicomponent electrolytic solutions up to 1.0 molar in concentration. A Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet was created to calculate the self-diffusion coefficient of zinc and nickel ions. Details of appropriate equations are found in Appendix 2.

Orifice calculation When only electrochemical treatment was employed at higher volumetric liquid fluxes;

0.0137 to 0.0366 m^-m'^-s'', the weir was made inoperable. Oriflces were instead drilled at the bottom of the electro-cell was shown in Figure 3.2. As a first approximation for the size of orifice, the following equation was used [80]:

Ap = 1.7267 X10-^-yO-v^

(3.3)

In the above expression Ap is the differential pressure in psia, p is the density of the liquid in lbm*ft'^, and v is the liquid velocity in ft s '. The pressure difference was the pressure exerted by the column of water at the base of the electro-cell. The height of the electro-cell was
6

inches. From this expression the liquid velocity was calculated. From the liquid flow

rate in the system and the desired number of orifices, the area and thereby the diameter for a single orifice was calculated. For example, for a volumetric liquid flux of 0.0137 m^ m'^ s ' and
8

orifices a flux through a single orifice was 0.00172 m^-m'^ · s''.

3.4

Data Analysis The absolute uncertainty in the dissolved oxygen (DO) readings was calculated

according to the manufacturer's (YSI Inc.) instructions. Calculation in the BOD5 was based on the method of Kline and McClintock [81] for uncertainties in single-sample experiments. A sample calculation for estimating the uncertainty in the BOD5 is presented in Appendix 3. Similarly, the uncertainty in the average mass transfer coefficients and Sherwood numbers for zinc and nickel were calculated using the same procedure. A sample calculation for this is also presented in Appendix 3. Uncertainties associated with chemical oxygen demand (COD), and concentrations of zinc and nickel were calculated from multiple readings. Any outlier values were discarded and the average and standard deviations [82] calculated from remaining data.

In the above expressions dco / dt and dci / dt represent the change in concentration of the eleetroaetive species with time; c,- and C o represent the inlet and outlet concentrations of the eleetroaetive species of the electro-cell, respectively; Q represents the volumetric flow rate; and, Vr and Vm represent the volumes of the reactor (i.e. Eleetro-cell) and holding tank, respectively. The reaction rate term, r, describes the consumption rate of eleetroaetive species at the electrode. As discussed in Sub-section 2.1.1.3, this was expressed by Faraday's Law to account for the generation of current. In the case of dilute concentrations of eleetroaetive species, the process is under mass transport control conditions. For the situation of complete

dci r = ---- = -- k, Ac, dt ^ '

(4.3)

Solving for c,- in Equation (4.2) yields the following expression:

C ..= ^ .^ +r Q dt

Equation (4.4) is then substituted into Equation (4.3) to provide the following expression for the reaction rate:

This model describes the change in electro-cell concentration with time. The inlet concentration to the electro-cell is not necessarily expressed by the same model. Walker and Wragg [83] have developed an expression for the change in inlet concentration with time. However, for a small reactant conversion per pass as typically would occur under most operational conditions, the outlet concentration as described by Equation (4.7) would suffice to describe the change in concentration for the whole system [84]. The solution to Equation (4.7) was given by Pickett [84]. The purpose of the present study is to provide a basis for the simplification of this model in the subsequent paragraphs. As has been shown by other authors [29,83,84] the above model can be greatly simplified for the case when the electro-cell volume, Vr, is substantially less than the holding tank volume, Vht- In this instance, t r « tht- This would reduce the above model to one of a simple batch reactor without recirculation. For this situation the outlet reactor concentration, Co, can simply be expressed as C(t). The resulting model thus becomes:

In this instance the electro-cell is so small that it can be regarded as part of the holding tank which then becomes equivalent to a cell of large volume but with a very small electrode area [84]. This statement would satisfy the following condition:

Q

Therefore Equation (4.8) is reduced to the following:

(4.10) dt Vj

In this expression the holding tank volume, Vht, has simply been replaced by the total electrolyte volume, W, present in the system as there is now no need to differentiate between the volumes of the electro-cell and holding tank. The average mass transfer coefficient in Equation (4.10) could be determined from the limiting current, it as mentioned in the Section 2.1.1.3. However, as the concentration of the eleetroaetive species changes appreciably with time in a batch process, the bulk concentration does not remain constant as required to determine the limiting current so that it may not be obtained for this situation. However, the average mass transfer coefficient could be determined by considering that for a batch process the change in concentration of eleetroaetive species follows first-order kinetics:

dc, dt

(4.11)

Comparing this expression with that from Equation (4.10) indicates that the apparent rate constant, k, in Equation (4.11) is dependent on the mass transfer coefficient, ki and the electrode area, A\

Vj

(4.12)

48

Modeling

Actually, A, refers to the eleetroaetive area of the electrode and may be difficult to know precisely as it depends on flow conditions, extent of gas evolution, degree of solid product build-up and cell geometry [14]. In this case, the mass transfer coefficient is lumped together with the eleetroaetive area per unit volume. The apparent rate constant thus becomes equivalent to a volumetric mass transfer coefficient:

k =k^^A s= ^ Vr

(4.13)

In this expression As refers to the active electrode area per unit of reactor volume. Dilute solutions are affected by mass transport limitations so that in order for an appreciable rate of reaction to occur improved mass transport through turbulence promotion would be required. Another means of improving the efficiency of such a process would be through the use of increased surface area. For example, a porous material such as aluminum foam as was used in the present study. Such an electrode also provides for improved turbulent mass transfer conditions adjacent to the electrode surface [63]. If a porous electrode is used the volumetric mass transfer coefficient would be expressed as:

k=

k ,A V , Vt

(4.14)

In this equation, Ag, is the active electrode area per unit volume of electrode, Vg For a given liquid flow rate, the mass transfer coefficient, k^, would be expected to remain constant as the physical properties (i.e. density and viscosity) of the liquid would not change significantly with concentration so that the Schmidt number should remain approximately constant [85]. Therefore, the apparent rate constant, k, would be affected by changes in the eleetroaetive area, A of the electrode and/or volume, V, of electrolyte.

Modeling biochemical oxygen demand in a BOD bottle

The rate of BOD reduction is typically modeled on the assumption that the amount of organic matter remaining at any time is governed by first-order kinetics [12]. The change in concentration of organic material the bottle is a batch process so that the following mass balance results:

^ ^ ^ = -kBOD dt

(4.15)

Upon rearranging this equation and integrating between the limits of t=0 and t=t and
B O D u

and

B O D ,

the following expression results for the amount of organic matter remaining

at time t:

BOD^ = BODy{e~'``)

(4.16)

In Equation (4.16), BODr represents the amount of organic material remaining at time t, and is based on the oxygen required to oxidize carbonaceous organic material remaining;
B O D u

represents the total carbonaceous oxygen demand and is based on the oxygen required

to oxidize organic material initially present; and k represents a first-order rate constant.

Modeling BOD removal in a packed bed aerator The operation of the packed aerator was a batch process with continuous recycle of the

wastewater. The oxidation of propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) will occur in two areas of the experimental apparatus (Figure 3.1). One is in the packed column itself where the substrate (PGME) will diffuse from the liquid across the liquid-biofilm interface into the biofilm where microbial oxidation will occur. The second area is from oxidation of microbes suspended within the liquid. Therefore, the system (packed column plus holding tank) can be modeled as a batch process [85]:

Bulk electrolyte pH prior to electrochemical treatment
The bulk pH for runs with
8

hours and 48 hours of sole electrochemical treatment after

approximately one hour of mixing was slightly acidic, typically with a value of 5.5. However, for those runs with only biological treatment the bulk pH prior to treatment had a typical value of 6.5. The differences between pH for sole biological and electrochemical treatment can be explained by considering the nature of the electrolytes. Generally, water weakly dissociates to form hydrogen and hydroxide ions [14]:

(5 .1)

In Equation (4.1), Ky, is the ion product constant for water. For runs with only biological treatment this would be the main ionization reaction present. The addition of metallic salts such as zinc sulfate and nickel sulfate would cause the solution to become acidic. In the present case the acidity was due to the presence of Z n ^ and Ni"^ ions. The contribution of ions from the potassium sulfate supporting electrolyte was not believed to have

contributed to the acidity. This ion tends to be weakly hydrated due to weak electrostatic interactions between the K^--OH2 bonds [8 6 ]. In addition would not combine with the OH'

ions to form potassium hydroxide as this is a strong base with complete dissociation:

The presence of zinc and nickel in an aqueous solution do not exist as bare ions. Instead, they exist within a sheath of water molecules. In the case of zinc and nickel the most stable form has an octahedral shape [8 6 ]:

In Equations (5.4a) and (5.4b), Kg is the acid dissociation constant for zinc and nickel. As their respective constants indicate, hydrolysis of Z n ^ and Ni"^ would occur under basic conditions. In the present study, the typical bulk pH was around 5.5, so that the main form believed to have been present was that of the octahedral form. Typically it is assumed that the presence of the anion, such as sulfate, from zinc and nickel sulfate, in the electrolyte does not form a complex with hydrolyzed metallic ion [87]. Therefore, the same will be assumed in the present study. However, the presence of the sulfate ions was believed to have been involved in the formation of a pH buffer agent, namely, the bisulfate ion [15]:

Knowing the acid dissociation constant of the bisulfate ion and the ionization constant of water, the corresponding basic dissociation constant for the sulfate was calculated as:

Comparison of the acid dissociation constants of both zinc and nickel with that of the basic dissociation constant for sulfate would indicate the existence of a slightly acidic solution. This would explain the weak acidic nature of the synthetic wastewater encountered prior to electrochemical treatment that was not encountered under sole biological treatment.

Electrochemical; 8 hours of treatment; Effect of bulk p H
The effect of bulk electrolyte pH was examined for eight hours of electrochemical

5.2.1.1 Porous electrodes
Figure 5.1 presents the percent reduction in zinc ions for two volumetric liquid fluxes in the laminar region. This graph shows that zinc reduction increased with pH control. For example at flux of 0.00915 m3 m'^ s '\ a percent reduction of 48% was achieved at the end of 8 hours of treatment for runs with pH control, whereas approximately 25% was reached for runs without pH control for which a typical pH value encountered was 4.25. Figure 5.2 presents the normalized concentration for zinc ion reduction for cases with and without pH control in the laminar region. In all cases a slight exponential behaviour was noted. A semi-log plot of the normalized concentration versus treatment time was prepared from which the apparent rate constants were obtained from the slope of the regression line. These are presented in Table 5.1 The results for nickel ion reduction are presented in Figure 5.3. During
8

hours of

treatment there appears to be no observable difference for experiments with or without pH control at both fluxes of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m3 m'^ s '\ In all situations the reduction of the nickel ions was approximately 16 % which was within the margin errors for each run as indicated in the figure. The same can also be said for the normalized concentration as depicted in Figure 5.4. As with zinc, a slight exponential behaviour was determined during this time in which the reaction rate constant for these situations was determined. A summary of these rate constants for are also presented in Table 5.1.

5.2.1.1.1 Observed deposit The nature of the deposit on the porous cathode was similar for experimental runs with and without pH control. After eight hours of electrolysis the deposit appeared to be pale green in colour with a paste-like texture. Upon air drying, the deposit still had the pale-green color but with a chalk-like texture. There was no appreciable deposit on the back of the cathode, that is, that surface not facing the anode. There was appreciable deposit build-up on the edges of the cathode and on the surface of the cathode facing the anode. It was difficult to ascertain as to the depth of the deposit within the porous structure. The deposit did not completely cover the front surface of the cathode so pores still remained open, although the fraction of pores blocked by deposit was not determined. Figure 5.5 illustrates the typical deposit pattern on the front surface of the cathode.

5.2.1.2 Flat plate electrodes Percent zinc reduction for flat plate electrodes is presented in Figure 5.6. An increase in zinc reduction with pH control is also noted as was the case for porous electrodes. A greater percent reduction was observed for runs with and without pH control for the flat plate cathode than for the porous electrode at the same volumetric liquid flux of 0.00915 m^-m'^-s''. 65% reduction was achieved with pH control compared with 32% reduction without pH control. Comparison of these results with the porous cathode indicated percent reduction to be approximately twice the amount when bulk pH was controlled. Figure 5.7 presents the normalized concentration for zinc ions reduction for cases with and without pH control. As with the porous electrodes, there was slight exponential behaviour.

For nickel reduction there was no clear difference between the situations with and without pH control as presented in Figure 5.8. The percent reduction in nickel at the end of treatment was
8

and 15% for runs without pH control and for runs with pH control,

respectively. Although there is a difference in values at the end of treatment, examination of Figure 5.8 does not instill a high degree of confidence as to the overall trend between the two situations. Figure 5.9 presents the normalized nickel concentration. Again, there is a lack of values. For

confidence in the trend of these curves as indicated by their respective

comparison purposes with other graphs, an exponential behaviour is assumed. To obtain a better model more samples should have been taken, specifically between the 4 to

intervals as a more notieeable change occurs during this time. A summary of the reaction rate constants for nickel are also presented in Table 5.1.

5.2.1.2.1 Observed deposit The nature of the deposit on the flat plate cathode was similar for runs with and without pH control. There was a noticeable difference between these deposits and those observed for the porous cathodes. As with the porous cathode there was no appreciable deposit on the back of the cathode. Deposit build-up was noted on the edges of the plate and on the front surface. The colour of the deposit appeared to be light grey. The deposit appeared to be adhered as fragmented sheets on the front surface of the cathode. There was no noticeable green deposit as with the case of the porous cathode. A typical deposit pattern observed for the flat plate cathode is illustrated in Figure 5.10.

5.2.1.3 Discussion o f uncontrolled bulk electrolyte p H fo r both fla t plates and porous electrodes With the onset of electrochemical treatment the pH was observed to decrease. A decrease in electrolyte pH was also observed by other researchers in treating dilute concentrations of metallic wastewater. For example, Ohran et al. [61] in their study on nickel removal noted that a decrease in pH impeded the electrolytic process. They noted that in a pH range between 5.45 and 5.55, 90% of nickel was removed, compared to only 37.5% with no control of pH. In the study by Simonsson [39] for zinc removal, the author similarly noted a low rate of deposition in an acidic medium compared to that in an alkaline one. Doan et al. [13] also observed that changes in bulk pH had an effect on the removal of zinc and nickel. It was observed that under slightly acidic conditions of a pH of 6.0, the reaction rate constant was twice that at bulk pH of 4.21. The decrease in bulk electrolyte pH was believed to have occurred from the electrolysis of water at the anode. In typical electrodeposition of alloys that employ insoluble anodes, a

66

Results and Discussion

decrease in bulk pH due to the electrolysis of water is always observed [87]. For electrolysis of water under neutral and acidic solutions the reaction at the anode is [15]:

H^O

+ Y20^+ 2e-

= -1 .2 3 V

(5.7)

The reactions known to have oceurred at the cathode were the reduction of the zinc and nickel ions as given by equations (2.3 a and b). It must be noted that in these reactions the metallie ions are the hydrated species as indicated by Equations (5.4 a and b), but are not explicitly as such so as to focus attention on the electrochemical aspects as opposed to strict solution chemistry. Assuming these to be the only reactions at the cathode, the standard cell potential based on the galvanic sign convention is calculated to be:

= 1 .2 3 -(-0 .7 6 ) = 1.99 V

(5.8)

This calculation indicates that a minimum applied potential of 1.99 V would be required for the electrolytic reaction to proceed. In addition, the overvoltages associated with the electrode materials and ohmic resistance associated with the electrolyte should also be taken into account. In the present study an applied potential of 10 V was used and was believed to have been sufficient to overcome the aforementioned resistances. However, other reactions are also known to occur during electrodeposition of metals. The consumption of hydrogen ions through the decomposition of water, reduction of oxygen gas, or through the evolution of hydrogen gas all could lead to an increase in the pH of the cathode diffusion layer. Water decomposition would lead to the formation of hydroxide ions which would be involved in a neutralization reaction with the hydrogen ions in the cathode diffusion layer. The decomposition of water at the cathode is represented by the following reaction [15]:

2H,0(,) + 2e-

= -0.83 V

(5.9)

67

Results and Discussion

The presence of dissolved oxygen and its reaction at the cathode should also be considered when dealing with low metal ion concentrations of less than solubility of molecular oxygen is approximately
8 2 0

ppm as the

ppm in aqueous solutions at room

temperature [8 8 ]. The reduction of oxygen gas at the cathode is represented by the following reaction [15]:

0^+AH^ +A e ~ ^ 2 H ^ 0

£ " = + 1.23 V

(5.10)

As the standard reduction potential for oxygen reduction indicates, oxygen is a strongly oxidizing species. In order to bring about the reduction of oxygen at cathode, a potential of at least 1.23 volts would be required. However, the overpotential required for oxygen reduction can be very high as it involves the transfer of four electrons and four hydrogen ions. The reaction kinetics associated with this is slow due to the presence of the strong oxygen double bond. In order to obtain an appreciable rate of reaction an electrode exhibiting catalytic properties is required. Typically platinum is used to establish any reasonable current density at overpotential of at least 0.3 V [14], that is, above and beyond the standard reduction potential of oxygen. Electrode materials such as mercury and some carbons would require an electrode overvoltage greater than 1.5 V [14]. Based on these arguments it would seem improbable that oxygen reduction occurred in this study so that consumption of hydrogen ions through this reaction may not have occurred. The third possible side reaction would be that of hydrogen evolution:

2 H ;,) + 2c- ^

= 0.00 V

(5.11)

As zinc and nickel both have negative standard reduction potentials relative to hydrogen, it would seem reasonable to assume that hydrogen reduction also occurred as a side reaction. However, hydrogen evolution occurs at a more negative potential than its equilibrium value on many kinds of metal electrodes [87]. Further, for systems under complete mass transport control, as is the case when dealing with dilute metal concentrations, the potential at which hydrogen evolution occurs would be greater than the potential at the (mass transport) controlled limiting current. This was depicted in Figure 2.1, which illustrated a typical current

68

Results and Discussion

density versus potential curve. In order to obtain the limiting current value it would be necessary to maintain the bulk concentration of the electroactive species at a constant value. This would ensure an adequate supply of the species be available for transport to maintain the existence of a zero concentration value at the cathode surface. For the removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater there would be a decrease in metal concentration with time as the metals become electrolytically deposited onto the cathode. The bulk concentration in this situation is continually decreasing with time and therefore the rate of transport becomes the controlling factor. During the initial hours of treatment the limiting current for dilute solutions may not be reached as this bulk value decreases with time. In this instance, it would not be possible to reach the limiting current as such; the system would not be in a state of complete mass transport control. Instead, the system would be operating in the exponential rise portion of the curve in Figure 2.1 where there is both mass transfer and charge transfer control. Therefore, it was not probable that the potential necessary for hydrogen evolution was encountered during those runs in which hours of electrochemical treatment was employed. It was observed for runs without pH control and electrochemical treatment times of 48 hours, there was an increase in the bulk pH at the end of treatment. This could be attributed to the decrease in the zinc and nickel ionic concentrations as these have a natural tendency to increase the acidity of the water. The trend of the normalized concentrations of both zinc and nickel indicated an exponential decay behavior. The normalized concentrations eventually reached an asymptotic value. This indicated that the concentration in the bulk liquid remained fairly constant at the end of treatment as indicated by Figure 4.15 for zinc and Figure 4.16 for nickel. These graphs indicate a substantial reduction in heavy metal concentration. As there were then less electro active species present in the cathode diffusion layer, the excess electrons produced by an applied cell potential of
10 8

volts would have to be utilized by another reaction

such as hydrogen evolution. It was possible then, towards the end of treatment that the limiting current for the zinc and nickel was reached as the concentrations of these approached a constant value. The reduction of hydrogen ions as a side reaction to use the excess electrons generated by the applied cell potential of
10

volts could be a possible explanation as to the

observed pH increase in the bulk electrolyte towards the end of 48 hours of electrochemical treatment.

69

Results and Discussion

Therefore, during the course of 8 hours of electrochemical treatment the additional side reaction at the cathode surface was believed to be that of the decomposition of water. The standard cell potential based on the galvanic sign convention is now calculated as:

El,I

1.23 - (-0.83) = 2.06 V

(5.12)

Again, the applied cell potential of 10 volts was believed to have been sufficient to meet this minimum cell potential.

5.2.1.4 Discussion o f controlled bulk electrolyte pH and anomalous co-deposition
Bulk electrolyte pH was controlled in the range of 5.6 to 5.8 for runs with
8

hour of

electrochemical treatment. As Figure 5.1 has indicated there appeared to be an increase in the zinc reduction. The same could not be said for certainty in the case of nickel reduction in Figure 5.3. The increase in zinc deposition by controlling the bulk pH may be explained by considering the concept of anomalous co-deposition. The following subsection is a brief aside discussion on anomalous co-deposition.

5.2.1.4.1 Anomalous co-deposition Up to this point in the discussion, it was taken for granted that zinc was always removed to a greater extent than was nickel. However, as mentioned in the Sub-section 2.1.1.1, the standard reduction potential of zinc is greater than that of nickel implying that nickel should in fact be reduced more readily than zinc. A zinc-nickel system is a typical example of anomalous co-deposition that occurs when two or more metals are to be electrolytically deposited in which the less noble metal is preferentially deposited instead of the more noble metal [87]. An early theory to explain this phenomena, Brenner [87] proposed an "addition agent theory" in which an agent formed by the cathode reaction hindered deposition of the more noble metal. The formation of this agent was believed to have occurred by the cathode reaction

70

Results and Discussion

only when the current density was sufficiently high to significantly raise the pH of the cathode diffusion layer [87]. Since this first theory, other hypotheses have been developed. Dahms and Croll [89] investigated anomalous co-deposition of nickel-iron alloys. They demonstrated that the suppression of nickel deposition occurred when the rate of hydrogen evolution exceeded the diffusion-limited current due to hydrogen ions resulting in the formation of metallic hydroxides. In their study it was believed that the formation of ferrous hydroxide blocked nickel discharge while iron was discharged readily from this layer. They had developed a model in which they had shown that the electrode surface pH could rise to as much as 9 for an iron-nickel system having a bulk liquid pH of 2.5. Since this theory was first introduced, others have substantiated the hydroxide suppression of the more-noble metal, for a zinc-cobalt system [27]; or for a zinc-nickel system [90]. The hypothesis of Dahms and Croll [89] has fallen under scrutiny as it fails to explain some phenomena during anomalous co-deposition such as; the lack of hydrogen reduction, or the increase in nickel content in the alloy with an increase in pH [91]. Therefore other theories have been developed that utilize kinetic aspects in developing a mechanism to describe anomalous co-deposition. These mechanisms include adsorbed intermediates that act as catalysts in the deposition of the less-noble metal. Studies include zinc-nickel systems from a chloride medium [92] or from a sulfate medium [91,93]. As observed by Deligianni and Romankiw [94] for an iron-nickel system, in the presence of agitation the surface pH was lower than that required for the formation of ferrous hydroxide. In fact, the electrode surface pH increased only by three pH units above that of the bulk pH value of 2.0 when buffering agents such as the hydrolyzed iron was present. For a zinc-nickel system hydrolyzed ions of zinc and nickel are given by Equations (5.4 a and b). Fabri-Miranda et al. [91] have shown that anomalous co-deposition occurs without permanent surface alkalination. It was observed that at a bulk pH of 3.0 the surface pH was nearly potential independent and remained close to the bulk pH. One of the drawbacks to the theory developed by Dahms and Croll [89] was that it was based on a derived model in which they were able to calculate the surface concentration of hydrogen ions from other measurable quantities. The pH corresponding to this calculated hydrogen ion concentration may be greater than that actually encountered in practice. Nevertheless, the results of researchers that have measured surface pH for anomalous co-deposition have identified that an increase does occur.

71

Results and Discussion

The difference in views appears to lie in the extent and permanency of this pH rise and its ability to induce a metallic hydroxide film. As there was no means of measuring the surface pH or in employing methods to determine the presence of intermediate catalytic adsorbates, the theory as proposed by Dahms and Croll [89] and which has been substantiated by other researchers appears to provide a reasonable explanation as to the observations and results encountered in the present study.

5.2.1.4.2 Control of bulk electrolvte pH With this brief outline on anomalous co-deposition, the zinc- nickel system in the present study could be explained by the rise in cathode surface pH, primarily believed to be due to the decomposition of water as given by Equation (5.9). This reaction would generate hydroxyl ions in the cathode diffusion layer that would combine with hydrogen ions transported from the bulk solution. This would cause the pH to rise at the surface until it reached a value amenable for hydrolysis of the metallic ion. As given by Equations 5.4a and b for zinc and nickel ion hydrolysis, the pKa values indicate that hydrolysis of both species would occur under alkaline conditions with zinc having the lower value of 8.96 compared with 9.86 for nickel. These hydrolysis reactions generate additional hydrogen ions that would tend to suppress the rise in surface pH [94]. However, as zinc and nickel were present in dilute concentrations it was believed that the hydrolysis as described by these reactions would not be extensive and that generation of hydrogen ions from these reactions would not be sufficient to slow the rise in surface pH. The rise in surface pH would thus establish precipitation of zinc hydroxide that would become adsorbed on the cathode surface. According to Dahms and Croll [89] hypothesis, for the present study, a zinc hydroxide film would suppress the deposition of the hydrolyzed nickel ion. In the study by Dahms and Croll [89], they observed a high rate of iron discharge as opposed to nickel. This was attributed to the presence of the iron hydroxide film as it provided the source for iron discharge. Similarly, the same could be said for the present study. An adsorbed zinc hydroxide film would provide the source for the discharge of zinc ions. As postulated by Brenner [87] in his theory on anomalous co-deposition, nickel deposition is retarded because nickel is sensitive to such influences as adsorption. In this case

72

Results and Discussion

the adsorbed species would be the hydroxide film that would influence the nickel deposition. Brenner [87] has given an example on the effect that addition agents have in alloy plating when added to a nickel-cobalt plating bath in which the deposition of nickel was suppressed. The initial adsorbed zinc hydroxide layer would affect the nickel deposition mechanism as the nickel deposit grows according to a nucleation-nucleus growth process [95]. In order to maintain the bulk pH in the range of 5.6 to 5.8, 1.0 molar KOH was used. The presence of a high concentration of hydroxyl ions probably made conditions favourable at the cathode diffusion layer for the formation of a zinc hydroxide film. The increased concentration of hydroxyl ions may have increased the rate of hydrolysis (Equation 5.4a and b) through the consumption of iT" or the rate of adsorption. The hydrolysis reactions of zinc and nickel ions occur under alkaline conditions, so that by the addition of hydroxyl ions this may have increased the rate by which the cathode surface pH rises. Therefore, there would be an earlier onset of a zinc hydroxide layer as compared to the runs without pH control. For zinc ions it has been shown that zinc deposition is relatively pH independent in the range of 4.0 to 5.5 [28]. The present study employed a pH range of 5.6 to 5.8, just outside this limit. This would thus make zinc removal slightly more favourable as observed by others such as Simonsson [39] and Doan e ta l [13]. In the case of nickel ions, a bulk pH greater than 5.5 would result in the ratio between metallic nickel and nickel hydroxide deposition to decrease [59]. It has been shown that when the bulk pH was greater than 5.0, NiOH^ is formed. Whether there was in fact the formation of nickel hydroxide species on the cathode in the present study was not known. However, Njau et al. [59] have reported that for bulk solution pH less than 5.0, nickel deposits as a metal, while within the range of 5.0 to 9.0 a mixture of both metallic nickel and nickel hydroxide deposits occur. The increase in surface pH then, was probably sufficient to cause a zinc hydroxide film to form as the bulk pH was greater than 5.5 thereby making the surface pH greater than this value. Whether the surface pH was greater than 9.0 for complete nickel hydroxide deposition was not known. Only visual observations were performed to give some additional insight into the nature of the deposits obtained in the current study. These observations were outlined in Sub-sections 5.2.1.1.1 and 5.2.1.2.1.

73

Results and Discussion

In one study, Njau et al. [60] examined nickel removal from industrial wastewater who observed at a low current density of 63 PJrt? a deposit of pure nickel. At a high current density of 188 AJvc? two deposits were observed. A black powder that analysis indicated to be nickel oxyhydroxide; and, a green powder that was identified as nickel oxide and hydroxide. In another study by Njau et al. [59] identified that at a bulk pH of less than 5.5 the deposit was metallic nickel while at a bulk pH greater than 5.5 the deposit was both metallic nickel and probably nickel hydroxide. For this situation the deposit was observed to be dark and powdery. Similar deposits were obtained by Deligianni and Romankiw [94] for a 0.2 M NiCl solution having a bulk pH of 2.0. A surface pH of 8.5 was observed in the absence of buffering agents such as the hydrolyzed nickel ion as given by equation (5.4b) The analysis of the deposit revealed a precipitation of a hydroxylated nickel species. Morphological studies for concentrated zinc-nickel sulfate systems were performed by Fabri-Miranda et al. [91] and Zhou and O'Keefe [96]. Fabri-Miranda et al. [91] observed at a cathodic polarization the presence of zinc-rich alloys in which the deposits were "light colored'', while at a low cathodic polarization nickel-rich deposits were observed that were "dark colored." Similarly, Zhou and O'Keefe [96] observed results that indicated smooth, silver to grey deposits. Comparing the visually observed deposits obtained in the current investigation; two different forms of deposit between the porous electrode and the flat plate electrode could be elucidated. Upon removal of the porous cathode immediately following
8

hours of treatment the

deposits had the appearance of a pale green color with paste-like texture. When allowed to air dry the deposits flaked-off and had a chalk-like texture. These deposits appear to resemble those of Njau et al. [60] or Deligianni and Romankiw [94] for sole nickel deposition in which a hydroxide species was formed. The pale colour observed may be similar to that of the "light" colour observed by Fabri-Miranda et al. [91]. For the flat plate cathode the deposit on the front surface (i.e. facing the anode) had a light gray colour and was deposited as flakes or sheets. These deposits appear to resemble those observed by Zhou and O'Keefe [96]. Similar observations were made by Doan et al. [13] who observed dark and densely packed deposits.

74

Results and Discussion

The differences in deposit formation maybe explained through the kinetics associated with porous versus flat plate electrodes. Generally, porous electrodes have a non-uniform potential distribution [14]. This non-uniformity leads to a low current efficiency. This might explain the believed presence of hydroxylated deposits of zinc. As mentioned in Sub-section
5

.2 . 1 . 1 . 1 , the porous cathode appeared to have areas in which a bubble layer was present on

both the front and back surfaces. However, it could not be stated with certainty whether this was due to entrained air bubbles from the falling liquid or due to the formation of hydrogen gas. The bubble layer was more noticeable when the volumetric liquid flux was at 0.00183 m^-m`^-s`* in which the liquid within the electro-cell appeared to be more quiescent then at the higher fluxes. The probability of hydrogen gas formation is not without possibility. The non uniformity of the potential distribution in porous electrodes could lead to areas of the having experienced excessively high current densities. The excessive current densities are often known to contribute to dendrite formation or oxide/hydroxide formation due to localized pH increases [14]. This would lead to localized areas of large deposit build-up with possible blocking of the pores. The flat plate electrodes on the other hand, had a greater similarity in their geometric shape and surface area as opposed to the porous electrodes. The flat plate cathode and anode had surface areas of 0.0206 m^. In contrast, the porous cathode and anode had surface areas of 0.176 m^ and 0.271 m^, respectively. The uniformity of the flat plates thus provided for less anisotropic conditions with respect to electrode conductivity, electrolyte flow and concentration of the electroactive species [14]. This could explain the more even distribution of deposit formation and the possibility of less zinc hydroxide. There was no observable presence of a bubble layer for the flat plates as there was for the porous cathode. This could mean the absence of areas of high current density that could lead to the formation of hydrogen gas and with it a rise in surface pH to form a zinc hydroxide layer. As previously mentioned, it was believed that the potential at which hydrogen evolution occurs at was not reached so that the rise in the cathode surface pH was attributed to the decomposition of water. In the case of the porous cathode the believed areas of localized increase in current density may also have lead to hydrogen gas evolution, although there was no way of knowing for certainty. Therefore, like the flat plate cathode, it was assumed that the

75

potential for hydrogen evolution was not reached for those runs with electrochemical treatment.

Electrochemical; 48 hours of treatment; Effect of volumetric liquid flux on mass transfer
The effect of volumetric liquid flux on the reduction of zinc and nickel was performed

for 48 hours using flat plate and porous electrodes. The characterization of the flow regime, either laminar or turbulent, was based on the electro-cell and weir diameter. The electro-cell was considered as being composed of two short, concentric pipes. In this case, the transition from laminar to turbulent occurred within the typical Reynolds number range for internal flow in a pipe of 2100 to 4000. Initially, the weir was used for both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. However, at higher fluxes, at least greater than 0.00915 m^-m'^-s*', bypassing of the wastewater directly into the opening of the weir was observed. As the water exited from the bottom of the packed column a substantial portion would immediately became funneled through the opening of the weir, without being treated electrochemically. These observations are presented in Figure 5.11. This figure presents data for zinc and nickel reduction after 24 hours of treatment using only the porous cathode at low fluxes in the laminar region and higher fluxes in more turbulent regions. As noted from this figure, there is a gradual decrease in reduction with an increase in liquid flux. Furthermore, with the fluxes greater than 0.00915 m^-m'^-s'* there was observed intense agitation of the liquid in the electro-cell to an approximate depth of 2 to
3

cm from the

liquid surface. Below this depth the water appeared to be stagnant. Upon removal of the porous cathode after 48 hours, it was noted that there was a great degree of product build-up on the upper portion of the electrode; approximately 14 of the 11.5 cm height of cathode had deposit. The remaining portion of electrode that was exposed to the stagnant water had minimal deposit. In order to study the effect of higher volumetric liquid fluxes in the electro-cell, the weir was made inoperable. Instead, orifices were drilled at the bottom of the electro-cell, the diameters of which corresponded to the required flux. It must be noted that in so doing, the flow pattern under turbulent conditions within the electro-cell was probably different to

Figure 5.12 is a bar graph displaying the per cent reduction of zinc and nickel after 48 hours with fluxes of 0.0137, 0.0321 and 0.0366 m^*m'^*s'* using both the flat plate and porous cathode. Analysis of this figure indicates that zinc reduction is insensitive to changes in volumetric liquid flux for both materials. Nickel reduction appears to show a slight sensitivity to changes in flow, particularly when using the flat plate cathode.

5.3.1

Laminar flow
The results for the laminar flow situation are presented in Figures 5.13 to 5.16. The

percent reduction of zinc ions as depicted in Figure 5.13, indicate greater reduction at the end of 48 hours when using the porous cathode as opposed to the flat plate. The results suggest approximately 95% reduction with the porous material while 85% was achieved with the flat plate. There does not appear to be a significant difference on zinc per cent reduction between the fluxes of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^-m'^-s'* for either material at the end of 48 hours as compared with Figure 5.11 that indicated a difference after 24 hours of treatment. Figure 5.14 presents the per cent reduction for nickel. As with zinc, there is a greater reduction with the porous cathode as compared with the flat plate. There also appears to be a difference in per cent reduction between the fluxes of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^ m'^ s '\ The most reduction occurs with the lowest flux of 0.00183 m^-m-`^-s`*; 52% with the flat plate and 80% with the porous material. The normalized concentration of zinc and nickel reduction is presented in Figures 5.15 and 5.16, respectively. Again, these graphs indicate the similar observations as in Figures 5.7.and 5.9 for
8

hours of treatment. The apparent rate constants

from Figures 5.15 and 5.16 were obtained from a semi-log plot of the normalized concentration versus time. These constants are summarized in Table 5.2. Examination of this table indicates that the apparent rate constant for zinc reduction using both materials remains constant over the 48 hour treatment period. In the case of the porous material, a change of only 7.4% results between the two fluxes. This is similar to the case of
8

hours of treatment

presented in Table 5.1; for the porous material without pH control, a change in the apparent rate constant for zinc reduction resulted in 6.7%.

Results and Discussion

In terms of nickel reduction, the apparent rate constant decreases with an increase in liquid flux for both materials. Using the porous material there is a 37% difference between the lowest and highest flux; while the flat plates produce a 25% difference between the lowest and highest flux. A similar trend is also observed for the case of
8

hours of treatment presented in

Table 5.1; there is a decrease in the nickel apparent rate constant with an increase in liquid flux in the laminar region.

Observed deposit The observed deposit on both materials was similar to that as presented under Sub

section 5.2.1.1.1. There was minimal pore blockage on the top surface of the porous cathode; however, the edges did show appreciable deposit build-up with pore blockage. It must also be noted that minimal to no deposit was observed on the back of the cathode for both materials. This observation was also true for the experimental runs that employed pH control for
8

hours of electrochemical treatment. An explanation to this

observation may lie in considering the potential distribution pattern. Figure 5.17 illustrates a possible pattern that may have existed in the electro-cell and which would account for the preferential location of the deposits on front surface and edges of cathode.

On the other hand, use of the flat plate electrode shows no appreciable difference at the end of 48 hours; having on the average, 85% reduction. The per cent reduction in nickel appears to show slight difference with flux as indicated in Figure 5.20. At 0.0137 m^-m'^-s'* 55% reduction is achieved compared to 60% reduction atO.0366 m^-m'^-s'*.

marginal improvement, at best, for nickel reduction at the highest flux of 0.0366 m^-m'^-s"'. In contrast, the highest volumetric flux of 0.00915 m^-m'^-s'' in laminar flow also resulted in approximately 60% reduction in nickel. The normalized concentration of zinc and nickel reduction is presented in Figures 5.19 and 5.21, respectively. The apparent rate constants from Figures 5.19 and 5.21 were obtained from the slope of a linear regression line from a semi-log plot of the normalized concentration versus treatment time. These constants are summarized in Table 5.3.

Table 5.3: Apparent rate constant for zinc & nickel ion reduction during 48 hours of electrochemical treatment without pH control- Turbulent flow k(l Volumetric liquid flux (m m'^ s'^ ) 0.0137 0.0229 0.0321 0.0366 Zinc

Examination of this table indicates that the apparent rate constant remains unchanged with increasing flow rate in the turbulent region for zinc reduction. This trend is similar to 48 hours of treatment under laminar flow as presented in Table 5.2 in which the apparent rate constant for zinc was unaffected by changes in liquid flux. Similarly, the same trend exists for nickel reduction under turbulent flow. There is a 7.4% difference in nickel reduction between the lowest and highest fluxes in the turbulent region.

5.3.2.1 Observed deposit The nature of the observed deposit was similar to that previously described for porous cathodes. However, the build-up of deposit for the turbulent flow condition appeared to occur more on the top surface of the cathode. The deposits were also noted to be larger than under laminar flow. The deposits also appeared to block some of the pore on the top surface and also on the edges of the cathode, although an exact figure of pore blockage was not known. For the

90

present purpose, it was sufficient to know that greater amount of pores were blocked under turbulent flow relative to that under laminar flow.

5.3.3

Mass transfer in electrochemical reactor durins 48 hours o f treatment The model in equation (4.10) would describe the exponential decay behaviour of zinc

and nickel with treatment time as observed in Figures 5.2, 5.7 and 5.15 for zinc, and Figures 5.4, 5.9 and 5.16 for nickel. From these figures the apparent rate constant, k, was determined and presented in Table 5.1, for
8

hours of treatment and. Tables 5.2 and 5.3 for 48 hours of

treatment. As has been shown, the average mass transfer coefficient could be extracted from this term assuming that the entire electrode area is electro-active. The surface area of the flat plate cathode was 0.0206 m^ while that of the porous cathode was 0.169 m^. The observed deposit pattern as depicted in Figure 4.10 for the flat plate indicated approximately 1/3 of the total area had deposit on it. In contrast, deposition for the porous cathode occurred not only on the exterior surface as depicted in Figure 5.5, but also within the structure. Further, as discussed in sub-section 5.2.1.4.2, the localized areas of pH increases in the porous cathode would have allowed for increased removal of zinc as a hydroxide. The combination of reduced active surface area on the flat plate cathode and the localized areas of pH increase in the porous cathode could possibly explain the increase in zinc reduction over the 48 hour period when using the porous cathode. The configuration of the electro-cell in the present study had a weir within it as depicted in Figure 3.3. This configuration was viewed as consisting of two short concentric pipes. The flow regimes for mass transport described in this study were thus based on the respective diameters of the weir and electro-cell, the geometry of which was an annulus. As the liquid traversed the length of the electro-cell it would remain for a certain residence time during electrochemical treatment. The reduction of zinc and nickel was studied with various fluxes under the laminar and turbulent flow regimes. The fluxes selected for laminar flow were 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^-m`^*s'* corresponding to Reynolds numbers of 390 and 1949, respectively. This represented minimum and maximum values for laminar flow in the present system. The fluxes selected for transitional and turbulent flow were in the range of 0.0137 to 0.0366 m^ m'^-s ' corresponding to a range of Reynolds numbers between 2900 and 7700.

91

Results and Discussion

5.3.3.1 L am inar flow As presented in sub-section 5.3.1, greater per cent zinc reduction was achieved with the porous cathode over a 48 hour period, as compared to the flat plate, although it appeared to be insensitive to changes in liquid volumetric flux within the laminar region. Similarly, greater nickel reduction was achieved with the porous material however; nickel appeared to be more sensitive to changes in flux, having a decrease in per cent reduction with an increase in flux within the laminar region. Generally, a lower flux should result in less turbulence within the electro-cell. This would cause an increase in thickness of the cathode diffusion layer and therefore an increase in the resistance to mass transfer of the electroactive species, namely, the zinc and nickel ions. For the flat plate cathode the mass transfer coefficient for zinc did not indicate any conclusive changes; only changing from 6.75 cm h ' at a flux of 0.00183 m^ m'^ s '\ to 7.02 cm-h`* at a flux of 0.00915 m^ m'^ s '\ However, the mass transfer coefficient for nickel reduction indicated an opposite trend for the same fluxes; going from 2.63 cm-h'* to 1.99 cm h '\ The improved mass transport for zinc under a slow flux such as 0.00183 m^-m'^-s'* was quite evident when compared to the results obtained by Doan et al. [13] for a zinc-nickel system in a simple batch reactor with mild agitation of the electrolyte using a flat plate aluminum cathode. For a solution pH of 4.21, which was closer to the lowest value of 4.6 typically encountered in the present study, mass transfer coefficients of 1.90 cm h'^ and 1.64 cm-h'* for zinc and nickel, respectively, were reported. The study by Doan et al. [13] also had a supporting electrolyte concentration of 250 ppm consisting of ammonium sulfate and potassium chloride, compared with 500 ppm of potassium sulfate in the present study. The increase in concentration of supporting electrolyte would aide in increasing the metal deposition. In an earlier study [74] that also used a 20 ppi porous aluminum cathode, zinc and nickel reduction increased with increasing supporting electrolyte concentration. At 300 ppm of potassium sulfate, over 90% of zinc ions were removed after 48 hours with an applied voltage of 15 V while 32% reduction in nickel ions resulted. With a lower concentration of 100 ppm potassium sulfate, however, nickel reduction.

Results and Discussion

It is also known, however, that the presence of chloride ions can promote the deposition of nickel as shown by Ji et al. [97]. In their study sodium chloride was shown to increase the current efficiency of nickel deposition. Therefore, the apparent rate constant obtained by Doan et at. [13] for nickel would be influenced by the presence of the chloride ions. The increase in the mass transfer coefficients for zinc and nickel in the present situation could thus be attributed to an increase in supporting electrolyte and an increase in flow of the synthetic wastewater. When the porous cathode was used under laminar flow conditions a similar trend to that of the flat plate was observed in the mass transfer coefficient for zinc and nickel. Under the same liquid volumetric fluxes of 0.00183 and 0.00195 m^-m'^*s'\ the average mass transfer coefficient for zinc increased from 1.28 cm h ' to 1.38 cm h '\ respectively. The average mass transfer coefficient for nickel decreased from 0.63 cm h ' to 0.40 cm h"\ respectively. Even though the system was operating in the laminar region the changes in flux corresponding to minimum and maximum Reynolds numbers of 390 and 1949, respectively, would still provide for increased in mass transport. The increased flux would increase the convective transport of the electroactive species towards the cathode diffusion layer while reducing its thickness and at the same time causing an increase in the concentration of the metal ions. Assuming that deposition in the present study follows the hypothesis proposed by Dahms and Croll [89] for anomalous co-deposition, an increase in the concentration of zinc in the cathode diffusion layer should result in an increase in the rate of formation of a zinc hydroxide film that would retard the deposition of nickel ions. Brenner [87] gave an example of a nickel-cobalt system in which agitation of the electrolyte caused an increase in deposition of cobalt, which in this case, was the less noble metal. The increase in flow rate within the laminar region probably did not provide sufficient agitation of the synthetic wastewater, but instead reduced the residence time of nickel in the electro-cell. This decrease in residence time would seem to have a negative effect on nickel ion discharge.

S.3.3.2 Turbulent flow
Increasing the flux above the laminar flow regime would cause for greater turbulence, but with an appreciable decrease in residence time in the electro-cell. Nonetheless, the

increased turbulence of the bulk liquid would be expected to cause a considerable decrease in the cathode diffusion layer as compared to the laminar case and reduce the resistance to mass transfer of the electroactive species towards the cathode surface. During deposition, the cathode diffusion layer would become depleted in zinc and nickel ions, which for dilute solutions, is of great importance. Turbulent flow as a means of increasing mass transport would be required to replenish the ions in the cathode diffusion layer. The effect of the increase in flux with reduction of zinc and nickel were presented in sub-section 5.3.2. As presented in that section, an increase in volumetric liquid flux actually reduced the per cent reduction of zinc when using the porous cathode. On average there was a 12% decrease in per cent reduction of zinc as compared to laminar flow having 95% reduction. Also, changes in flux within the turbulent region appeared to have no effect of removal of zinc for the porous cathode. Similarly, zinc reduction using the flat plates appeared to be insensitive to changes in the flux as the reduction was maintained around case. The apparent rate constant for zinc deposition under turbulent flow with the porous cathode was presented in Table 5.3. As the flux was increased there was no change in the mass transfer coefficient; having values of 0.726, 0.732, 0.734, and 0.740 cm-h`* for liquid fluxes of 0.0137, 0.0229, 0.0321, and 0.0366 m^ m " s '\ respectively. Comparisons of these mass transfer coefficients with those obtained in the literature however suggest an agreement at least in magnitude. Using an RVC cathode Bertazzoli et al. [98] demonstrated that increasing the porosity from 45 ppi to 100 ppi improved the efficiency of zinc ion reduction up to a porosity of 80 ppi after which the mass transfer coefficient remained constant. Operating in the turbulent region with a volumetric liquid flux of 2 . 0 1 min'% a mass transfer coefficient for a 4 5 ppi grade RVC resulted in a value of 0.08 cm-min"' while an 80 ppi grade produced a mass transfer coefficient of 0.16cm-min`'. In the present study, typical mass transfer coefficients for zinc in the turbulent region was 0.012 cm min '. This value is 85% less than that given Bertazzoli et al. [98] for a 45 ppi RVC cathode. This would be expected as increasing the grade of foam material leads to increased surface that are available for zinc deposition. Further, a 0.1 molar (7360 ppm) potassium chloride supporting electrolyte was used in their study compared to 500 ppm potassium sulfate used in the current investigation. The high

Results and Discussion

concentration of supporting electrolyte would substantially increase the conductivity of the solution thereby enhancing the deposition of zinc. In terms of nickel reduction, there was also a decrease in the per cent removal as compared to laminar flow. Increasing the turbulence within the electro-cell appeared to have an increase in percent reduction for both porous and flat plate materials, although more pronounced for the case of the flat plate. At the highest flux of 0.0366 m^ m'^ s '\ the percent reduction in nickel for both materials approached that of the highest flux of 0.00915 m^-m'^-s'* within the laminar flow regime. Still, the best removal was at the lowest flux of 0.00183 m^-m' ^·s'' corresponding to the greatest residence time. The apparent rate constants for nickel reduction under various fluxes in the transitional and turbulent region were presented in Table 5.3. It appears that an increase in flux produced a negligible increase in the mass transfer coefficient of nickel; 0.400, 0.419, 0.419, and 0.429 cm h'^ for liquid fluxes of 0.0137, 0.0229, 0.0321, and 0.0366 m^-m'^-s'*, respectively. The apparent rate constant obtained at the highest flux was approximately
11

times less than that

reported by Njau et al. [60] of approximately 0.229 h'* [13]. In their study, a graphite packed bed was used with a large concentration of supporting electrolyte (20 mol m'^ or 2640 ppm of ammonium sulfate and 100 mol m'^ or 14200 ppm sodium sulfate) [13]. The high concentration of the supporting electrolyte caused an increase in the current and therefore an increased rate of nickel reduction was achieved in their study. From the discussion so far, it appeared that the reduction of both zinc and nickel was greatly affected by the residence time and was less affected with increased turbulence of the bulk flow. Comparing the per cent reduction of zinc and nickel under turbulent flow with those under laminar flow indicated greater reduction with laminar flow which corresponded to an increase in the residence time. The current electrode arrangement and flow appears to provide poor results with increased flux above the laminar region. A decrease in removal efficiency with an increase in flux however, is not without precedent and has been also observed by others. Hor and Mohamed [56] studied the galvanic removal of copper in a single-pass reactor, without recirculation of the electrolyte, using both an 80 ppi RVC cathode and porous graphite sheet. With both materials, they observed a decrease in percentage copper removal with increased flow rate. They noted that the residence time had a more pronounced effect when

95

Results and Discussion

compared to the increase in the mass transfer coefficient at the higher flow rates. Comparing the trend in the zinc mass transfer coefficients in the present study with those of Hor and Mohamed [56] indicates that an increase in flow rate should result in an increase in However this was not the case in the present study for zinc deposition as the average mass transfer coefficient appeared to be insensitive towards changes in flow rate. Matlosz and Newman [57] employed a cylinder of RVC that acted as packed bed for the removal of mercury. Even though the flow rate caused an increase in convection within the cathode pores, the effect of the associated decrease in residence time was greater so that the outlet concentration had a greater concentration in mercury at the higher flow rates. Again, comparing the trend in the zinc mass transfer coefficient with those of Matlosz and Newman [57] indicated the insensitivity of this coefficient with changes in flow rate. The observed trends in the present study on the mass transfer coefficients of zinc and nickel show relatively a constant value. This behaviour may be explained by considering that the mass transfer coefficient was extracted from the apparent rate constant (Equation 4.14) assuming a 100% electro-active surface area. The mass transfer coefficients obtained by Hor and Mohamed [56] and Matlosz and Newman [57] were based on the limiting current which is a more fundamental quantity. In contrast, the mass transfer coefficient of Bertazzoli et al. [98] was obtained from the manufactures literature on the specific surface area of the RVC cathode. Furthermore, consideration should also be given as to how the laminar and turbulent flow regimes were designated in the present study. The designation of laminar and turbulent flow for the present investigation was based on the diameters of the weir and electro-cell. For the flat plate electrodes this designation may be adequate as these electrodes were two-dimensional such that their surface area would be exposed to the bulk liquid flow conditions. For porous electrodes this designation may not be adequate to describe the flow within a porous matrix. In the case of the porous cathode, laminar flow conditions would have occurred in the bulk liquid. However, as the cathode was three-dimensional, the flow conditions to which it was exposed to may have consisted of both longitudinal and transverse flow patterns, as depicted in Figure 5.22.

The circulatory motion of these flow patterns may have exposed more electrode surface area that would lead to an increase in the deposition of electroaetive species within the porous structure. In this case, effective use of both internal and external surface area of the cathode would have resulted. Considering bulk liquid turbulent flow conditions, the present arrangement of the porous electrodes may not have been effective. A possible, idealized flow pattern that has occurred with this arrangement is depicted in the following Figure 5.23. This pattern suggests that, on the average, the flow was parallel to the cathode surface as it traversed the length of the electro-cell. The outer surface of the cathode was probably exposed to the bulk liquid turbulent flow. The inner surface may not necessarily have experienced the same flow conditions; it may have been exposed to less turbulent flow. As observed, there was significant deposit on the outer surface that was not noticeable during laminar flow operation. During laminar flow, the deposit was observed to be more uniform throughout the outer surface. Increasing the flux would be expected to cause a reduction in the resistance to mass transfer of zinc and nickel and thereby cause an increase in the rate of

discharge of both species. However, with the present arrangement of the porous cathode in turbulent flow, there was not observed. As discussed by Janssen and Koene [9] deposition on the outer surface of a three-dimensional electrode can drastically reduce the porosity; in such an instance it behaves as a two-dimensional electrode. For the present study, the porous cathode may actually have had less surface area available for deposition than that of the flat plate material based on the configuration of the cathode. In the present study, there was observed to be greater product build-up on the surface of the porous cathode under bulk turbulent flow. Increasing the flow rate, thereby increasing km, may not have necessarily increased the product, k,,^e. The reduction in available surface area caused by this would decrease Ae, as this is a function of the active electrode area such that this decrease may be more substantial than the increase in k,,, as this is a function of the linear velocity of the liquid. The apparent rate constant for nickel deposition in Table 5.2 indicated a decrease with increasing flux in the laminar region for both the flat plate and porous material. This may be due to the preferential adsorption of zinc as a hydroxide layer. As nickel was believed to have

98

Results and Discussion

deposited primarily as a metallic species as discussed under sub-section 5.2.1.4.2, the poor conductive nature of the zinc hydroxide film would have made it difficult for this to occur requiring greater time for any appreciable deposition of nickel to occur. This prolonged period of time would be achieved at the lowest flux of 0.00183 m^-m'^-s'* corresponding to the greatest residence time. As the flux was increased in the laminar region an increase in the rate of zinc hydroxide was deposited altering the active electrode area, A. This would result in a decrease in the product of k,,Ae, and thereby the apparent rate constant for a constant electrolyte volume, V. Increasing the flux within the bulk liquid turbulent region appeared to cause a negligible change in the apparent rate constant of nickel as previously noted and indicated in Table 5.2.

5.3.4

Mass transfer correlation usinQ porous electrodes under turbulent flow

The average mass transfer coefficients obtained from Equation (4.14) were used to develop a dimensionless correlation for zinc and nickel for the present system using porous electrodes. This correlation combined the Sherwood number, Reynolds number and Schmidt number in the form of a power expression as given by Equation (2.9). The diffusion coefficient, D, in the Sherwood and Schmidt was not measured nor was one located in the literature for a similar aqueous solution of zinc-nickel-potassium sulfate as used in the present study. A means of calculating one for both zinc and nickel was used instead. A "mixing rule formula" for mixed electrolyte was developed by Anderko and Lenka [79]. A brief description of this model, appropriate assumptions made, and the relevant equations used are presented in Appendix 2. The resulting self-diffusion coefficients for zinc and nickel were calculated as 7.016 x 10'^ cm^-s'* and 6.132 x
1 0

'^ cm^-s'*, respectively.

Comparison of these coefficients with those at infinite dilution illustrates closeness in the results; 7.027 x 10'^ cm^-s'* for zinc and 6.141 x 10`®cm^-s'* for nickel. Closeness would be expected since zinc and nickel are both present in dilute concentrations of 2 0 ppm. The exponent on the Schmidt number was chosen a priori as 1/3. This value was based from boundary-layer theory for flow of liquids past a solid surface [99]. In the absence of a chemical reaction, fluids with constant physical properties and for large Schmidt numbers

99

Results and Discussion

greater than 1 .0 , the ratio of the concentration boundary layer to the velocity boundary layer is a constant ratio depending only on the value of the Schmidt number [99]. This result has been demonstrated experimentally for binary system of liquids in turbulent flow in circular pipes for Schmidt numbers in the range of 0.6 to 3000 [62]. From the calculation of the self-diffusion coefficients, as given in Appendix 2 for zinc and nickel, the Schmidt numbers for a zinc and nickel solution were 1268 and 1451, respectively. From these results a log-log plot of Sh/Sc'^ versus Reynolds number should produce a straight line with a slope equal to a and intercept equal to logC. Figure 5.24 presents such a plot for zinc and nickel deposition using a porous cathode. The slopes and intercepts from the linear regression lines produced the following correlations:

The coefficients of determination are 0.9065 and 0.9007 for the zinc and nickel reduction, respectively. The associated linear correlation coefficients, r, for zinc and nickel are both 0.95. The probability that the mass transfer coefficient, and the linear velocity, u, of

the liquid are uncorrelated for a set of four data points is 5% [82]. For a highly significant correlation between two variables a probability of less than 1% is required [82]. The 5% probability obtained is therefore insufficient to conclude that k,,, and u are correlated. A possible explanation for this includes repeated use of the cathode. Although the cathode was cleaned prior to each run as outlined in the Sub-section 3.3.3, there were still noticeable deposits from previous runs. In this regard the active area of the cathode was reduced after each successive run. Additional factors to consider include kinetic and geometric.

Results and Discussion

The present system may not have been operating under complete mass transfer control so that mixed control may also have occurred. Mixed control includes the effect of electron transfer as indicated by Equation (2.8b). For this case the system would be operating in the exponential rise portion of a polarization curve, Figure 2.1 such that the mass transport limiting current was not reached. The geometric factor includes the arrangement of the porous electrodes in the electro cell. The placement of these electrodes as depicted in Figure 3.3 may not have been suitable. It is believed that under turbulent flow the outer surface of the cathode was exposed to the bulk liquid turbulent flow while the internal surface may have experienced different flow conditions. The characteristic length selected to define the flow regimes in the electro-cell was based on the annulus created by the weir diameter and electro-cell diameter. This may have been acceptable to describe the flow conditions for the outer surface of the cathode, but may not necessarily be adequate to describe the flow within the porous structure. Other studies [29,31] that have used an electro-cell diameter as their characteristic length, employed packed bed configuration so that the entire volume of the electro-cell was occupied by the electrode. In the present study, the electrodes occupied a fraction of the electro-cell volume. In order to facilitate comparison of the above correlations for zinc and nickel with other correlations from the literature, the general power correlation given in Equation (2.9) is expanded as below:

K (5.14)

As previously mentioned to know an explicit expression of k,,,, would require knowing the active electrode area, which is often unknown. Therefore the above expression is multiplied by the electrode area per unit volume of electrolyte, Ae as defined by Equation (4.14) for a porous material. Equation (5.14) then becomes:

m-LY (

v

V^

D

(5.15)

102

Results and Discussion

For a constant temperature process with dilute concentration of electroactive species the kinematic viscosity and diffusivity can be assumed constant. The characteristic length can also be treated as a constant as for the present study it was based on the diameters of the weir and electro-cell. Equation (5.15) is thus expressed as:

k = k ^ A ,= { c )-A ^ -u ` '

(5.16)

In this equation k represents the apparent rate constant as discussed in Modeling section
4 .1

where it was shown that this is essentially the volumetric mass transfer coefficient.

The apparent rate constant is a function of both the flow velocity and the specific electrode area that in turn is dependent on the electroactive area of the cathode. To compare the power dependence of Re obtained in the present study with those from others required similar foam type material and, as mentioned, characteristic length based on the flow channel of the electrolyte. Comparison with such studies indicated that the values obtained are substantially lower. However, it is relevant to note that the liquid flowed parallel to the electrode while flow-through arrangement was used in the other studies. In the work by Fletcher and co-workers [29] the exponent on Re was 0.48 with the hydraulic diameter as the characteristic length. They studied the removal of copper ions using four grades of RVC as a cylinder or block arrangement that acted as a packed bed in which the electrolyte flowed through the porous electrode. They observed no significant difference between the flow rate with the four grades so that the expression they obtained was a composite of the data of the four grades. For electro-cells with packed-bed configuration typical values for the exponent a, under the laminar region are between 0.3 to 0.5; while under turbulent flow region the values are between 0.45 to 0.8 [63]. This indicates that their flow regime is bordering between laminar and turbulent flow. In a similar study by Ponce de Leon and Fletcher [31] using three grades of RVC in a packed bed arrangement for the removal of lead ions, no significant difference was observed with the differing grades with changes in liquid flow rate. Therefore, the results were lumped together to achieve an exponent of 0.44 on Re also based on the hydraulic diameter of the electro-cell. The exponent obtained would indicate laminar flow based on the previously mentioned criteria for packed bed electro-cells.

103

Results and Discussion

Comparing the zinc power expression exponent on the Reynolds number with that from Fletcher et al. [29] and Ponce de Leon and Fletcher [31] indicated this to be approximately 25 times less than those authors. The nickel power expression exponent was approximately 3.65 times less. In both of the other studies RVC was used in a packed-bed arrangement so that more surface area was available than that encountered in the present investigation. As discussed in sub-section 5.3.3.2, the electrodes were directly immersed into the electro-cell as a plate-in-tank arrangement in so doing the predominant electrolyte flow was believed to be parallel to the electrodes. Further, these previous studies examined the deposition of a single metal, copper or lead, whereas in the present study, co-deposition of zinc and nickel occurred. In the case of nickel reduction, this was inhibited by the deposition of zinc so that either increased residence time in the electro-cell or increased mass transfer from an increase in flux would be expected to achieve an appreciable rate of conversion than would be the case for sole nickel deposition. Another factor to consider was the method used to obtain the average mass transfer coefficient. Both Fletcher et al. [29] and Fonce de Leon and Fletcher [31] used the limiting current technique. In the present investigation the system was modeled by Equation (4.10) from which the mass transfer coefficient was extracted from the apparent rate constant assuming the cathode area was 100% electrically active. As discussed in Section 5.1, this was believed not to be entirely true as it was assumed that zinc deposited primarily as a hydroxide which reduced the conductivity of the cathode. Further, it was believed that at the higher flux between 0.0137 and 0.0366 m^-m'^-s'*, the majority of deposition occurred on the top surface of the cathode and that partial blocking of the pores along with the parallel flow pattern of the electrolyte did not make effective use of the internal surface area. This essentially reduced the available surface area that the porous cathode had, and instead may have had less surface area than a regular flat plate electrode.

Combined biological and electrochemical treatment: 72 hours of treatment
Biological oxidation and electrochemical reduction of synthetic wastewater occurred

simultaneously over a period of 72 hours. 200 ppm of propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) was oxidized in a countercurrent aerated packed column at volumetric liquid fluxes of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^-m'^-s'* with a volumetric air flux of 0.0518 m^-m'^-s''. Concurrent electrochemical reduction of zinc and nickel with concentrations of
2 0

ppm occurred in the

electro-cell using a 2 0 ppi aluminum foam cathode and a porous stainless steel anode.

5.4.1 Electrochemical treatment
The percent reduction of zinc and nickel at fluxes of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^-m'^-s'* is presented in Figure 5.25. At both fluxes the percent reduction in zinc is approximately 98% after 72 hours. It appears for nickel reduction greater removal occurred at the lowest flux of 0.00183 m^-m'^ s ' achieving 95% reduction whereas at 0.00915 m^-m'^-s ' 82% reduction was achieved. The figure also indicates that nickel reduction under both fluxes is more gradual as opposed to zinc in which the majority of the reduction occurred in the first 24 hours of treatment. Figure 5.26 presents the normalized concentration for zinc and nickel ion reduction for the fluxes of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^-m'^-s'*. In both cases an exponential behaviour is observed. Semi-log plots of the normalized concentrations from these figures versus treatment time were prepared from which the apparent rate constants were obtained from the slope of regression lines. The apparent rate constants are summarized in Table 5.4.

These constants represent a similar trend to those obtained during 48 hours of sole electrochemical treatment using porous electrodes as presented in Table 5.2. In Table 5.4 there is a 3% change in the zinc constant compared with those from Table 5.2 in which there was a 1% change. In the case of nickel, there is 38% change its rate constant during 72 hours of treatment. Similarly, during 48 hours of treatment there was a 37% change.

5.4.2.1 Effect o f volumetric liquid flu x on BOD removal The effect of volumetric liquid flux on biological oxidation of PGME is presented in Figure 5.27. During the first 48 hours of treatment there appears no clear trend in the percent reduction of BOD. After this time and towards the end of treatment a flux of 0.00915 m^ m'^ s' ' does appear to have an effect on BOD reduction obtaining approximately 55% removal. The lower flux of 0.00183 m^-m'^-s`* during this same time interval appears to level-off to approximately 32% BOD reduction. During the 72 hours of treatment no clear trend could be observed although at the end of treatment the volumetric liquid flux of 0.00915 m^ -m'^-s'* appeared to provide the greatest per cent reduction at a value of 55%. To substantiate whether a clear trend occurs after 48 hours of treatment additional sampling intervals would be required. Based on the data presented in this figure, it will be concluded that over the 72 hours of treatment it is probable that a trend does not exist. Similar observations were noted by Doan and Wu [11] in a previous study on biological oxidation of PGME in an aerated packed column. In their study wastewater from an actual polymer coating process was used as opposed to synthetic wastewater that was used in the present study. An explanation on this observation was attributed to the slow kinetics of the biological oxidation of organic materials. The rate of oxygen consumption by the biological oxidation in the wastewater was much lower than the rate of oxygen transfer from air to water in the packed column [11]. For this situation the oxygen content was maintained at an adequate level for BOD reduction at the various liquid flow rates [ 1 1 ].

S.4.2.2 Effect o f aeration, seeding and voltage Figure 5.28 illustrates the effect of seeding the synthetic wastewater with microorganisms as well as the effect of forced air. The greatest percent reduction in BOD occurred when the wastewater was seeded and with an air volumetric flux of 0.0518 m^-m'^-s*'. In this case approximately 55% removal was achieved. The lowest removal was at 10% which was the case to account for any stripping that may have occurred of PGME. Reduction due to natural draft resulted in approximately 25% BOD removal less than half that occurred under forced air conditions. For the same cases as were presented in Figure 5.28, the percent reduction in COD is presented in Figure 5.29. To determine whether PGME was being oxidized during combined electrochemical treatment an experimental run was performed without seeding and without aeration at an applied cell potential of 10 volts. Approximately 5% reduction in COD was observed for this case. It appeared that the greatest reduction occurred during 48 hours of treatment. The greatest reduction in COD occurred with forced air flow of 0.0518 m^ m'^ s ' and in the presence of microorganisms with approximately 30 percent removal being achieved. However, this is in contrast to the 55% reduction in BOD for the same conditions as indicated by Figure 5.28. Similar results are also observed for the cases of no seeding with aeration, and for seeding with natural draft. The effectiveness of an aerated packed column in biological oxidation is illustrated in Figure 5.28 and 5.29 for percent reduction in BOD and COD, respectively. The greatest BOD removal of 55% was achieved in the presence of forced air flow and with microbial seeding of the wastewater, while only 30% COD reduction occurred under the same process conditions. In terms of BOD reduction, similar results were obtained by Doan et at. [13] in a previous study in which 55.7% BOD reduction in PGME was achieved. In contrast, under natural draft conditions, approximately 23% BOD reduction was achieved whereas COD was reduced by 13%. The application of forced air flow resulted in an increase in BOD reduction of 32%. In comparing the percent reduction of BOD 5 (Figure 5.28) with that of COD (Figure 5.29) it appeared that biological oxidation resulted in greater removal than with chemical oxidation. However, the results obtained for either biological or chemical oxidation are relative

to their respective initial concentrations. For example, a typical initial BOD 5 is about 203.40 mg*r' while the COD has an initial value of about 428 mg-l'V Comparison of the difference between the initial and final values after 72 hours of treatment indicate that the change is COD is slightly larger than that of BOD 5 for most of the runs. For example, a 116 mg4`` change in BOD 5 results compared with a 142 mg-l`* change in COD. The closeness in values would be expected as the primary organic species oxidized was propylene glycol methyl ether. The larger value in the COD change could be attributed to additional organic matter such as biofilm that may have been sloughed off from the packing during treatment. Prior to performing the COD test, the wastewater sample was vacuum filtered. Some microscopic organic matter may have passed through the pore opening of the filter paper used thus contributing to the higher COD value. In Figures 5.28 and 5.29, a run was also performed to examine the effect of stripping on the PGME during bio-oxidation. This run was performed in the absence of any seeded microorganisms. The family of compounds of propylene glycol ethers has low to moderate vapour pressures ranging from less than 1.0 to greater than 1573 Pa at 25°C and with low to moderate volatility corresponding to a Henry's Law constant range of 0.0003 to 5 Pa m^ mol ' [100]. PGME has a Henry's Law constant of 0.28 Pa-m^ mol ' [100]. Generally, chemicals with a Henry's Law constant greater than 1.013 Pa-m^- mol ' and with a molecular weight less than 200 g mol ' are considered as volatile chemicals [101]. Based on these criteria PGME is marginally volatile. As presented in Figure 5.28, approximately 10% reduction in BOD 5 resulted. This value is less than half of that obtained by Doan et al. [13] in a previous study in which 23% reduction resulted. The difference was attributed to the gas phase resistance. The solubility of PGME in water is one of the more miscible species in the propylene glycol ether family having a solubility of 200g l ' at 20°C [101]. As this species is readily soluble in water the major resistance to mass transfer would lie within the gas phase. To improve the mass transfer of PGME would require increasing the turbulence of the gas phase. The result obtained by Doan et al. [13] for the stripping effect on PGME occurred at a volumetric air flux of 0.0778 m^-m' ^·s'' whereas in the present study a volumetric air flux of 0.0518 m^-m'^-s'' was used. Also, the same volumetric liquid flux of 0.000915 m^-m'^ s ' was used in the present study as was used

in the previous study by Doan et al. [13]. The increased gas flux, then, caused the increase in mass transfer of PGME to the gas phase. To determine if propylene glycol methyl ether was being oxidized at the electrodes during combined operation the COD was measured for an experimental run in the absence of both seeding and forced air flow. The packing was also removed from the column to reduce the presence of biofilm. The system was also thoroughly rinsed with a dilute solution of acetic acid and rinsed with distilled water. After three 72 hours of treatment with an applied potential of 10 volts approximately 5% reduction in COD resulted as presented in Figure 5.29. The removal of organic pollutants through electrochemical means has been shown to be a possible alternative to biological processes [6,102]. This is specifically true for recalcitrant organic species [102]. The primary model pollutant investigated is phenol and its derivatives, although studies have been performed on a variety of other biorefractory species such as alcohols and dyes [6 ].

S.4.2.3 Biochemical oxygen demand removal in a BOD bottle Figure 5.30 presents the biological oxidation of propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) over a 90 day period. Confirmation of an exponential behaviour is indicated in Figure 5.31 in which a semi-log plot of BOD versus time resulted in a linear relationship. These results were based on the change in PGME concentration in a BOD bottle. The model describing this change was given by Equation (4.16). As indicated by Figure 5.31 the ultimate BOD, BODu, and rate constant, k, was determined from the intercept and slope, respectively. Therefore, Equation (4.16) could be expressed as follows for the biological oxidation of PGME:

Results and Discussion

The rate constant of 0.0595 d`* is approximately 22% less than that obtained by Doan and Wu [11] in a previous study for the same substance. In the present study determination of BOD was strictly due to the biological oxidation of PGME in the absence of any other biological food source or nutrients. The study by Doan and Wu [ 1 1 ] used real effluent from a polymer coating process that contained chemicals from part-cleaning solutions that were mixtures of organic and inorganic compounds.

S.4.2.4 Biochemical oxygen demand removal in a packed bed aerator The model describing this was presented in Sub-section 4.3 and given by Equation (4.17). To model the reduction of BOD in the packed column, an experiment was performed in which no packing was employed. This was done so as to examine the oxidation of the biological matter, PGME, from the suspended microbes in the holding tank. Figure 5.32 shows the comparison of normalized BOD 5 versus treatment time for runs with and without packing. Similarly, Figure 5.33 shows the comparison of normalized COD versus treatment time for the same set of runs. The run with column packing indicates a slight increase in oxidation of PGME for both figures. A summary of the reaction rate constants obtained form both figures are presented in Table 5.5.

Results and Discussion

As indicated by both figures, the presence of packing appears to provide a marginal increase in the oxidation of PGME. The reaction rate constant for the case with packing material represents the combined effect of k and in Equation (4.17).

Due to experimental errors it is difficult to conclude that the packing has a substantial effect on BOD reduction. This may be due to insufficient acclimation of the microorganisms in forming a biofilm on the packing. Typically 24 hours was allowed for this acclimation period which may have been inadequate. Although, it was observed after successive runs under sole biological treatment there was a greater development in biofilm, particularly on the lower 14 of the column. This could be attributed to the counter-current operation of the column, in which air entered the bottom of the column. This is where the concentration of oxygen in the liquid is the greatest so that the majority of oxidation of organic matter would occur at this location. Based on the results obtained the second term in Equation (4.17) appears to be negligible so that the model for BOD removal in the packed column for the present study can be expressed as follows: dc = -K c ^ dt (5.18)

This model describes the exponential decay behaviour as indicated in Figure 5.32 or in Figure 5.33 for the case with column packing. The rate constant, K in Equation (5.18) lumps together the effect of the decay rate constant, k and average mass transfer coefficient, , as

given in Equation (4.17). Figures 5.32 and 5.33 represent a normalized concentration so that the rate constant, K, is equal to unity in this case. As presented in Figure 5.32, the r^ values for both cases are low indicating a poor correlation between BOD and treatment time. Figure 5.33 for the COD parameter indicates a highly significant correlation. Therefore, the model describing the change in organic material will be based on the change of the COD parameter with treatment time. This is described by the following model:

Conclusion

CONCLUSION The present study investigated the removal of zinc and nickel ions, and propylene

glycol methyl ether (PGME) as model pollutants

from an electro-coating paint process.

Simultaneous treatment occurred in a combined aerated packed bed and electrochemical reactor. From analysis of the results the following conclusions could be drawn in relation to the objectives set forth in the Introduction:

·

Porous electrodes were effective in achieving greater zinc and nickel reduction as compared to flat plate electrodes under laminar flow conditions. After 48 hours of treatment using porous electrodes, on the order of 95% zinc reduction occurred for volumetric liquid fluxes of 0.00183 m^-m'^-s*' and 0.00915 m^ m'^ s '\ For the same fluxes, nickel was reduced by 60% and 80 %, respectively. On the other hand, using flat plate electrodes, zinc was reduced by approximately
8 6

%

for volumetric liquid fluxes of 0.00183 m^-m'^-s'* and 0.00915 m^-m'^-s'*. Nickel was reduced by 41% and 52% for the same fluxes, respectively. · Controlling bulk electrolyte pH in the range of 5.6 to 5.8 increased zinc reduction while no conclusive trend was observed for nickel. After
8

hours of treatment 48%

reduction in zinc occurred with pH control whereas 25% reduction occurred without pH control. · Increasing surface area of rectangular flat plates through the substitution of a

rectangular porous material is ineffective in the removal of dilute concentration of heavy metals at high liquid fluxes. Having the porous electrodes configured in a platein-tank arrangement resulted in less zinc and nickel reduction under turbulent flow conditions than was the previous case for laminar flow. · Increasing the liquid volumetric flux to more turbulent conditions between 0.0137 and 0.0366 m^'m'^'S'* resulted in a decrease in zinc and nickel reduction over the 48 hour treatment period as compared to the fluxes of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^ m'^ s '. Approximately 82% reduction in zinc resulted for the fluxes in the range of 0.0137 to 0.0366 m^ m'^ s '. For the same range of fluxes, nickel reduction was more sensitive to changes in flow. The greatest nickel reduction of 60% occurred at the highest

121

Conclusion

volumetric flux of 0.0366

This was less than that encountered at 0.00915

m^ m'^ s ' for laminar flow conditions for the same duration of treatment. Biological oxidation of organic matter (PGME) was shown to be effective by using a forced air packed-bed reactor. After 72 hours of treatment 56% reduction in BOD5 resulted as compared to 26% reduction in BOD5 for a natural draft packed column. BOD5 reduction was shown to increase with an increase in volumetric liquid flux. 32% and 56% reduction resulted for liquid fluxes of 0.00183 and 0.00915 m^ m'^ s'% respectively. Simultaneous treatment of zinc and nickel, and organic matter (PGME) has been shown to be effective over a period of 72 hours of treatment. Operating at the lowest flux of 0.00183 m^-m'^-s'', zinc and nickel were reduced by 99.25% and 95%, respectively. However, the greatest BOD 5 reduction occurred at the 0.00915 m^ m'^ s ' in which 56% reduction was achieved as compared to 32% at 0.00183 m^«m'^ s '. Operating at the lowest volumetric flux of 0.00183 m^-m'^ s ' would meet legislated discharge limits of zinc and nickel to municipal sanitary sewers. The treated effluent would have final concentrations of 0.2 mg l ' and 0.7 mg l ' for zinc and nickel, respectively. The reduction in BOD 5 would be 141 mg 1"', which is less than half required by the City of Toronto Sewer Use by-law as indicated in Table 1.1.

Recommendations

RECOMMENDATIONS
A different electrode configuration, such as a packed bed should be investigated to

improve the reduction in heavy metals at higher fluxes as greater reduction in BOD 5 occurred at a higher liquid flux. Consequently, the treatment period of 72 hours may be reduced. A single electrified packed bed could also be studied as a means of removing both the heavy metals and organic matter. Organic matter has been shown to be oxidized at the anode. Under the present arrangement a real wastewater sample from an electro-coating facility could be used to examine the performance of the apparatus towards treating this wastewater. If a packed bed electrode is chosen, additional design parameters can be selected for developing a design equation for scale-up, for example bed depth or packing size could be used in Sherwood correlation. The removal of individual metals, such as zinc and nickel, should also be studied to determine the influence of one metal on the electrodeposition of the other metal.

2. APPENDIX 2.1. Diffusivity calculation
A model was developed by Anderko and Lenka [79] for the calculation of selfdiffusion coefficients in multicomponent aqueous electrolyte systems of concentrations up to 1.0 molar. The model combined the self-diffusion coefficients of a selected tracer ion diffusing through various hypothetical single solute systems into one overall diffusion coefficient for the tracer ion. The literature indicates a variety of terminology for the term, diffusion coefficient. As noted by Mills and Lobo [103], self-diffusion can refer to binary or multicomponent electrolyte solutions where a labeled species is isotopic with another component, or where the diffusing species is not isotopic with that component and present in trace amounts. Turq et al [104] define self-diffusion as being an individual ionic property such as ionic mobility. Mutual diffusion, as noted by Mills and Lobo [103] is associated with binary type systems such as in a binary electrolyte whereby both cations and anions move with equal velocity to maintain electro neutrality of the solution [103]. Turq et al. [104] describes mutual diffusion as being a phase property such as electrical conductance.

1.0 Self-diffusion in a single solute svstem

The model took into account the contributions of long-range (Coulombic) interactions and short-range interactions between ions. These interactions were combined into the following expression for the self-diffusion coefficient of an ion [79]:

The first term in this expression was the diffusion coefficient at infinite dilution and is given by the Nemst-Einstein equation [79]:

135

Appendices

The second term describes the hard-sphere contribution and is applicable at higher concentrations. The third term describes the long-range contribution which is represented through the relaxation effect.

1.1 Hard-sohere contribution

The hard-sphere contribution used was that suggested by Tham and Gubbins [105]. This expression described the diffusion coefficient based from the Enskog theory of hard spheres. The expression by Tham and Gubbins was the following [105]:

-1 -1 ^i,ENs - X j-- + X^-- + X ^ (ALLS)

In the above expression x refers to the mole fractions of cation, anion, and solvent; gÿ refers to the radial distribution function at contact for rigid spheres; and, dij refers to the dilute gas diffusion coefficient for a mixture of molecules i and j. The radial distribution function was given by that proposed by Boublik [106]:

where the average diameter is defined as [79]:

The resulting equation for the hard-sphere contribution in Equation (A l.l.l) was given by the following ratio between the mixture to that of the pure solvent [79]:

^

(AJ.J.6)

1.2 Electrostatic contribution

The electrostatic contribution was given by the relaxation effect [1067. The expression for this effect was that developed by Chhih et al. [108]. This expression for a tracer ion i was the following:

1.3 Self-diffusion in a multi-component electrolytic svstem

The self-diffusion coefficients from Equation ( A l.l.l) were then combined into an overall mixing formula that would describe the self-diffusion of a particular ion in a multicomponent electrolytic solution. The resulting diffusion coefficient for this particular ion under study was given by the following [79]:

(AL1.12)

^i( d)

The first term in the denominator describes the self-diffusion coefficient of a particular ion diffusing in a solution of a single solute, d. For example, zinc ion diffusing in a zinc sulfate solution and zinc ion diffusing in a nickel sulfate solution.

138

Appendices

In Equation (AL 1.12) the second term in the denominator describes the diffusion of a particular ion diffusing in a solution of a single neutral solute, /. For example, zinc ion diffusing in a dissolved oxygen gas solution. Associated with this formula were the following auxiliary relationships [79]:

The following points should be noted with respect to this model and its application for the present study.

1. The model

for multi-component self-diffusion

was applicable for

completely dissociated electrolytes. The self-diffusion coefficients for the individual ions as given by Equation (A l.l.l) represented that of the free ions. Symmetrical electrolytes, such as ZnS 0 4 and N 1S 0 4 are known to form neutral ion pairs [110]. To account for this association, the following expression is used for symmetrical electrolytes [ 1 1 0 ]:

D , = aD.

-h (l - a)D]p

(Al. 1.19)

In this expression D 'i refers to the self-diffusion coefficient of free ions obtained from the self-diffusion coefficient for completely dissociated electrolytes and D 'w refers to the diffusion coefficient of the ion-pair. The resulting self-diffusion coefficient, D, obtained from this expression was then used in the mixing rule. Equation (ALL 12). 2. For both contributions a crystallographic radius was used for each ionic species. This was acceptable as a first approximation for the sizes of ions in dilute aqueous solutions. 3. Species i refers to the tracer ion. 4. Summations in the relaxation term are performed over the two distinct ions of the solute.

140

Appendices

5. Summations in the multi-component self-diffusion model are with respect to the tracer ion î diffusing into a hypothetical single solute systems of electrolytes and neutral species.

. Neutral species (excluding water which was the solvent) assumed were oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen.

'^ cm^-s`* for nickel.

Viscosity and Density Calculation for Multi-component Electrolytic Solutions [78]
The dynamic viscosity of a multi-component electrolytic solution can be calculated

from the following expression:

Tj = T}yexpV

(A l.l.l)

In the above expression, rjo is the viscosity of water which was obtained from Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook [113] at the experimental temperature. V was given by the following equation:

V = ^ C f · (Ao, + A,,r + AjjC; + Ay^t)
i=\

(A l.l.l)

In the above expression, c, is the mass fraction of a species in the percent, and

are

coefficients for each electrolyte. The reported percent error of these coefficients for zinc sulfate, nickel sulfate and potassium sulfate was 2.39%, 1.54%, and 0.30%, respectively. To determine the mass fraction of each species the density of the solution was required. The density of the solution was calculated from the following formula:

P = Po+ ^ C f·
f=l

+ ByCj )

(Al.1.3)

141

Appendices

In the above expression, /),, is the density of water; kg/m^ and Bij are coefficients for the electrolytic species present. The reported percent error for these coefficients for zinc sulfate, nickel sulfate, and potassium sulfate was 0.27%, 0.23%, and 0.13%, respectively. The density of water was obtained from Perry's Chemical Engineers Handbook [113] at the experimental temperature of around 25°C. The density expression required the mass fraction in percent of each species. An iterative process was required for this. Therefore the following expression was used for this with an initial value of the density of the solution selected:

In the above expression, c; is the mass fraction of the species, M -, is the molecular weight of the species, and Q is the mass concentration of the species. The mass fraction of each species was determined when a prescribed tolerance was reached. With the mass fraction calculated, the dynamic viscosity of the solution was calculated from Equation (A1.21). The density and viscosity for the present study of a multi-component electrolytic solution with concentrations of 20 ppm for zinc and nickel and 500 ppm potassium sulfate were calculated as: · · Density: 997.31 g*r' Viscosity: 0.00087 Pa s
