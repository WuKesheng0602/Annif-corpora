Abstract
A New Strategy For Multi-Objective Dynamic and Kinematic Optimization of a Robotic Manipulator with Application in Haptic Interfaces Behrooz Alae , Master of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering, Ryerson University, May 2006

There is an increasing demand for higher performance in modern robotic applications. To meet the need for more accuracy and fast dynamic response, considering inertial effects is necessary. This thesis proposes a new global multi-objective optimization strategy to tune the geo metric and dynamic capabilities of a manipulator. Then, as a case study, the kinematics and dynamic behavior of a five-bar-linkage haptic interface is analyzed and a new design procedure is obtained using a new global and constrained multi-objective technique. The minimax culling algorithm was used to design parameters for optimal kinematics and dy namic dexterity measure.

Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION

1.1

Previous Work

The world of robotics has entered a stage where the traditional repetitive task of assem bling of mechanical elements is just part of robotic applications. Robotics is finding its way in surgerical devices [1], astronomy, teleoperation, training and demonstrations [2] as well as haptic interfaces [3] used for interaction between people and computers. Thus not only workspace size and resolution and payload requirements [4] but also inertial parameter adjustments for mass, inertia and acceleration are important specifications that should be adjusted to do high precision tasks as mentioned above. Given that the relationsliip between robot end-effector and actuators varies with position and direction, minimizing this variation and consequently maximizing mechanical isotropy [21] throughout the workspace is highly desirable in modern robotic applications. Study ing directional and scale isotropic behavior is really essential for a optimum actuator and controller design [2]. Increasing the isotropy strengthens the worst-case performance of the manipulator and allows smaller actuators to be used, leading to a smaller inertia for whole manipulator [2]. In other words, the robot should perform the task homogenously in differ ent directions. Considerable research has been done to design an isotropic robot in a special
1

configuration [5] to move along a trajectory [5] or to explore a workspace [6] [7]. Ma and Angeles [5] described the concept of dynamic isotropic configurations and tried to optimize geometrical and dynamical parameters for a serial planar three DOF manipu lator to find the isotropic configurations of the manipulator. They introduced the dynamic conditioning index (DCI) to quantitatively measure the difference between a given position and the dynamic isotropic configuration [5]. They also applied the concept in the problem of robot trajectory planning and finally they developed a basic theorem about the rela tion between the kinematic and dynamic pure isotropy for a parallel manipulator in specific isotropic configurations [8]. More research on isotropy and its effect on controller design are presented by Salcudean et al. [9] and a special analytical example of a five-bar haptic device control design was presented as a case-study by Nenchev [10]. To extend the mechanical capability of a manipulator, a suitable measure should be in troduced to provide useful information for both the design of multi-purpose robot task as well as planning their efficient motion. Considering the manipulator kinematic properties such as Jacobian, Yoshikawa [11] suggested a measure based on volume of the velocity ma nipulability ellipsoids. This measure was defined as the set of end-effector velocities which can be performed by joint velocities belonging to a unit sphere. Moreover, according to the duality principle, the force manipulability ellipsoid is defined as the ability of exerting end-effector forces along each task-space direction for a given set of joint torques. Although both ellipsoids principle axes coincide but the lengthes of the axes are inversely propor tional. Chiu viewed a manipular as a ''mechanical transformer" and introduced the term of task compatibility index as a basis for computing postures that optimize the robot's performance at a special task application [12]. In many applications the manipulator dynamics can not be neglected, which means quan tifying dynamic and acceleration capabilities of a robot manipulator is really critical in robot

design. Yoshikawa [13] proposed another measure, known as the dynamic manipulability measure which incorporates the manipulator mass matrix in addition to Jacobian to find the best dynamic manipulability posture for a planar two-link manipulator. The dynamic manipulability ellipsoids can be imagined as a measure to describe end-effector acceleration with the the joint torques adopted from a unit sphere. Manipulability ellipsoids are effective tools for performing task space analysis of robotic manipulators. The shape of these ellipsoids demonstrates the ability of the robot to apply velocity, acceleration or force in different directions and various configuration. These measure determine the maximum available performance of a manipulator in a given posture and end-effectors direction of motion. This may be helpful in robotic design where the best manipulator structure and size is needed to execute a given task. Chiacchio et al. [14] demonstrated that gravity shifts the dynamic manipulability ellipsoid center. Rosenstien [15] investigated the role of velocity, Coriolis and Centrifugal forces on dynamic manipulability . A new definition of dynamic dexterity ellipsoid was proposed by Chiacchio [16] which led to more correct results in evaluating manipulator capabilities in terms of task-space accelerations. Yoshikawa [17] also proposed a method to investigate the compliant motion manipulability for a given compliant motion trajectory. The haptic interface design is effected by different geometrical, kinematical, dynamical and engineering factors. Since the device is a human-machine interface, it should meet the minimum ergonomic requirement. Device size, inertia, frequency response criteria [18] and workspace size all are the main design factors for the optimum kinematic and dynamic design of a industrial haptic device [7]. The actual size of the mechanism should be around desktop size with minimum possible mass. Also translational motions should occur in the largest portable area within the task-space [7]. Clearly, an optimum kinematical and dynamical design, a multi-dimensional multi-objective optimization method would be required.

Karadis et al [19] designed a dynamically counterbalanced five-bar linkage for micro probing applications. Hayward et al [7] proposed kinematic optimization of a five-bar mech anism to get a general rough design of a planar 2D0F haptic robotic interface. Stocco in troduced a novel approach based on the culling algorithm [6] with a new dynamic dexterity measure to optimize five-bar haptic device both kinematically and dynamically [3]. Design and kinematic optimization of a 5-DOF twin-Pantograph haptic pen [3], twin-Pantograph hybrid manipulator [3], and Stewart platform [6] was presented in reference [2], [22]. A new design matrix normalization technique is presented to cope with the problem of nonhomogeneous physical units for manipulators having both translational and rotational para meters [23], [24].

1.2

M otivation

Although a significant research in multi-objective kinematic and dynamic optimization of haptic interfaces was done by Stocco [3], but still the algorithm needs to be modified to challenge, more practical applications. Only rough approximation of inertia matrix was used in [3]. Since the method is dynamically a one dimensional multi-objective optimization technique, parameter space is very small. The method in Stocco [3] ignores multi-dimensional optimization along all possible dynamic parameter space. For example, inertia and mass of each link must be treated independent of each other and of geometry of mechanism (kinematics). Therefore, there is a need to perform dynamic analysis and establish a multi dimensional multi-objective method to address the nature of this multi-objective design problem. Also it is necessary to have a good understanding of nature of dynamic equations of 5 bar mechanism for optimization purpose. The optimization technique presented in this thesis is a four dimensional multi-objective optimization problem. The parameter space is big enough, the inertia matrix used for 5 bar linkage is exact, and the results are more

realistic.

1.3

Contributions

In this thesis, a new multi-dimensional multi-objective optimization method is introduced to design a kinematically and dynamically conditioned haptic device. The culling algorithm [3] is used as a global optimization method in place of other existing optimization methods such as Genetic Algorithm [26] which cannot guarantee the global optimum [25] [27] [28] . Also the inertia matrix used for optimization purpose is completely valid with no approximation involved, which could be one of the major contributions of this research. A new vision toward dynamic parameter analysis of five-bar linkage is presented and to avoid the trivial answer involved, with the global optimization a new constrained multi-objective optimization method is proposed based on the design guideline and procedures. During the optimization process, due to the nature of Culling Algorithm, the end-effector may hit positions with bad conditions i.e, self-motion [29],[30] and singularity points [31],[32]. Therefore, having a good knowledge of these concepts presented in respective references would be really crucial in computer programming to avoid divergence in culling algorithm. In short, the main contributions by this research include: · Using the exact inertia matrix for 5-bar mechanism in optimization process. · Presenting a new multi-objective optimization. · A new dimensionless analysis for dynamic parameters of 5-bar linkage. · Presenting a new optimal design procedure and guideline.

Chapter 2 M ANIPULABILITY ELLIPSOIDS

Design of robotic manipulators requires optimization of their manipulation ability. For this purpose, manipulability and dexterity measures have been developed. In this chapter, mea sures and analysis associated with the manipulability will be reviewed and the concept of manipulability ellipsoid will be presented as an index characterizing manipulation ability of a robotic manipulator. The manipulability ellipsoid can be defined and used in kinematic and dynamic contexts to graphically demonstrate the manipulation ability of a robotic ma nipulator in different kinematic and dynamic configurations. The introduced measures and ellipsoids will be utilized in the next chapters for optimizing the five-bar structure.

2.1

K inem atic M anipulability Ellipsoids

Consider the planar manipulator in Fig. (2.1) . The Jacobian matrix is a matrix that relates end-effector velocities to the joint rates denoted by v and q, respectively [21]. This relation is defined as follows : q = J(q)v. (2.1)

This matrix generally is a function of the manipulator configuration q and can be assumed as a transmission ratio between the actuator and end-effector.

Figure 2.2: Joint-rate/end-effector ellipses

Consider the set of joint velocities of constant unit norm as follows q^q = 1. (2.2)

The above equation shows all velocity vectors as points on the surface of a unit sphere in the joint velocity space. It is desired to describe the operational space velocities in end-effector that can be generated by the given set of joint velocities. Substitution of eq. (2.1) in eq. (2.2) yields v^J^(q)J(q)v = 1. (2.3)

this ellipsoid describes all the points in the end-effector velocity space and is called kinematic manipulability ellipsoid [21]. As shown in Fig. (2.2), all the point on the surface of the sphere are mapped onto the surface of the ellipsoid in the end-effector velocity space . The kinematic manipulability ellipsoid is a measure that shows direction of dexterous manipulability. The end-effector can move with large velocity along the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoid, while the smaller end-effector velocities are obtained along the direction of the minor axes. The closer the ellipsoid is to a unit-sphere, the more capable the end-effector is in moving in diflferent directions of the workspace. It is known from basic mathematics that the general geometry of the ellipsoid is highly dependent on the core of quadratic form introduced in eq. (2.3). Also the sharpness and the orientation of ellipsoid depends on the core matrix which is generally a function of configuration. Therefore, the sensitivity of the motion in different directions is dependent on manipulator posture, while shape of manipulability ellipsoid is dependent on the characteristic of its core matrix J^ J. The direction of the principle axes of the ellipsoid are determined by the eigenvectors of the matrix J ^ J, while the dimension is completely dependant on singular value of J defined as (Xi= \J Ai(J^J) i = 1, ,n (2.4)

where A{(JJ^) denotes the eigenvalues of J^ J. A well-known measure to represent the manipulation ability is the volume of the ellipsoid which is proportional to the following quantity w (q)= ^det(J^(q)J(q)). (2.5)

This measure is called Kinematic Manipulity Measure and in the case of non-redundant manipulator it can be reduced to w(q) = det(J(q)). (2.6)

It is concluded from the above definition that the manipulability measure is always non negative and is equal to zero in singular points. Therefore, in a way, this measure shows how much the cuiyent configuration is far from the singularity configuration. It is clear that in positions near the singularities, when the manipulator is outstretched, the ellipsoid is very thin along vertical direction. On the other hand, when the manipulator is retracted, the ellipsoid is very thin along the vertical axes. As it is shown, the eigenvalues approaches zero near the singular configuration. The best advantage of the manipulability measure index is that it can be computed easily through the determinant of J ^ J matrix. On the other hand, since the values computed for manipulabil ity measures cannot demonstrate how close the mechanism is to singularity, this could be imagined as one of the its main disadvantages. For example, in case when different units and scales are used for the links' length, our computation will get different performance results which differ from each other, almost around four order of magnitude. Therefore, in general, when it is not easy to find a simple and meaningful index for manipulability measure to meet the the above mentioned problems, one can consider the ratio between the minimum and maximum singular values of the Jacobian ominimax as an effective isotropy performance indicator. This index is called dynamic dexterity measure
10

and is equivalent to inverse of condition number and gives not only a measure of closeness to singularity configuration but also provides an index to measure the ellipsoid eccentricity directly. On the other hand, the complex relation between this measure and configuration of the manipulator can be considered as one of its major disadvantages. Also, most of the time, it is impossible to find an explicit relationship based on the coordination of the manipulator.

2.2

D ynam ic M anipulability Ellipsoids

Dynamic manipulability and dexterity is discussed exclusively in [15] and will be completely reviewed in this section for its importance in our research. The equation of motion for an open-loop manipulator with n rigid links can be expressed as

r = M (q )q + C (q ,q ) + G(q).

(2.7)

In above equation effects of disturbances ,e.g., friction is ignored in dynamic analysis and r is an n X 1 vector of joint actuator torques and q, q and q are n x 1 vectors of generalized joint positions, velocities and accelerations respectively. In eq. (2.7), M (q) is the n x n inertia matrix that demonstrates the configuration dependent inertial properties, C(q, q) represents Coriolis and Centrifugal forces, and G(q) accounts for the vector of joint torques due to gravity. Also x = [xi X2 Xm]^ represents the m-dimensional task-space vector

which introduces the coordinates of the tip of end-effector. In this thesis, it is assumed that end-effector has just translational acceleration and m < 3. The equations describing the relations between positions from joint space to task space is nonlinear, and the m x n Jacobian matrix J represents the first-order term in a Taylor series of the respective mapping. By differentiating the definition of Jacobian Matrix the corresponding relationship for acceleration is obtained. x = J(q )q -f j(q ,q )q .
11

(2.8)

Since the mass matrix is positive definite and invertible, the eq. (2.7) can be solved for q as follows: q = M - i ( T - C ( q ,q ) - G ( q ) ) . (2.9)

Substituting eq. (2.9) in eq. (2.8) and dropping the explicit dependencies on q and q yields:

X

= J M - ^ r - C - G) + jq .

(2.10)

It is notable that the result is in terms of actuator torques rather than joint accelerations and can be simplified to:

X = JM"V + X,,e/+ Xgrau, where x,,e/ = -JM ~ ^C + j q and Xgrat. = -JM -^ G . we assume that torque limits are symmetric as in ref. [16] such that _^iimu < n < - i = 1,................... , n,

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

then we can introduce f as a normalized actuator torque

f = where L= diap(rf""`, torques is defined as: ||r||oo< 1.
12

(2.15)

and with the help of eq. (2.14 ), a limit for admissible

(2.16)

Changing eq. (2.11) to the new form with normalized actuator torques denoted as f yields: X = JM ~^Lf + X,,e/+ Xprot; = JM -^L f + xwa^, where the bias acceleration defined as x^ias in following equation.
Xftias ~ X ueJ " f- ÿ^grav^ (2.19)

(2.17) (2.18)

To have a better imagination about the xwasi we can imagine it as the end-effector acceler ation while f = 0 [15]. The inequality ||f||oo < 1 introduces an n-dimensional hypercube which is mapped by eq. (2.18) to an m-dimensional polytope that delimits the set of feasible end-effector accelerations (the bias term is ignored for simplicity). Alternatively, eq. (2.18) can be imagined as a matrix transformation of the n-dimensional sphere defined by r ^ f < 1, (2.20)

to an m-dimensional ellipsoid. This dynamic manipulability ellipsoid is derived by solving eq. (2.18) for f and substituting the results into eq. (2.20):
(x - xw .a)^(JM -^L )-^(JM -^L )-X x X b ia s) <

1-

(2.21)

Since the inertia matrix and L are representing a symmetric matrix, the final inequality for dynamic manipulability ends up to the following equation:

{X-Xuasf{J-'^M L-^M 3-^){X-XHas)<l.

( 2 .22 )

The shape of the dynamic manipulability ellipsoid can be determined by the matrix which is determined by previous equation.
13

On the other hand, in case when the actuator torque limits are the same, L matrix reduces to identity matrix which indicates that there is no need for actuator torque limits [15]. The ellipsoid principle axes is specified by the eigenvectors u, of manipulability matrix and the length of the eigenvectors is equal to l / y / w l , where Wi is the corresponding eigenvalues. On the other hand, the shape of kinematic manipulability ellipsoids can be defined by ignoring the manipulator's inertia and actuator torque limits. The dynamic dexterity measure [15] (DDM) can be introduced as:

where matrix J is Jacobian matrix, M is inertia matrix of the manipulator and a and â represents minimum and maximum eigenvalues, respectively.

Chapter 3 CULLING OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
3.1 Introduction

In previous section, dexterity measure is introduced as a good quantity to measure how well a robotic manipulator can react in different configurations while satisfying a designated performance function. Maximizing kinematic or dynamic dexterity measure is the main goal for optimization and there is just a few algorithm that can address the optimization problem. For the functions such as condition number or dexterity measure, since the objective function is highly nonlinear, discrete, discontinuous and even unbounded the optimization problem is more complicated. Descent algorithms which usually use differentiation of the objective function go to local optimum points and there is no clear definition for stopping criteria [3]. The performance of global search gets more poor as the search resolution gets smaller. In the next section the nature of a typical minimax problem is discussed. The culling algorithm as an effective method to deal with optimization problem is discussed in section
3.3. This new algorithm guarantees finding the same results as global search but ends up

to the same solution with fewer steps in algorithm. The culling algorithm basically searches through the sub-optimal parameter space, evaluating all its elements and then culls the
15

non-optimal elements until it just ends to one element which naturally is the global optimal element. Then in section 3.4, a two degree of freedom minimax problem is discussed to show a more sensible geometrical view to the optimization process.

3.2

M inim ax O ptim ization Problem

Basically the minimax optimization problem arises when mathematically we are looking for saddle points of a function. Consider a function with two variable such as

y =A + {x-B f-{p -C f

(3.1)

A three dimensional view is illustrated in Fig. (3.1). As it can be checked from basic calculus Point A(b, c) is the saddle point of the function and its magnitude is equal to the value a. According to mathematical definition, the saddle point is acting as minimum point in one direction such as x axis and maximum in other direction such as p axis. So if we are starting from an initial condition such as point A(x, p), with the help of following algorithm the process of searching ends up to saddle point and eventually the culling algorithm will be introduced as follows.
1. Set P{x,p) as initial point on the surface. 2. Repeat the algorithm until points P and M gets to the same point.

3. Move along x direction with a fixed parameter p to find the minimum point as N. 4. Move along p direction with a fixed position x to find the minimum point as C. 5. Go to 2 Ideally when we have a two-variable quadratic function it just take two step to reach to optimal point and for more complex functions the process of optimization will take more
16

p ( manipulator parameters)

X (end-effector position)

Figure 3.1: Saddle point of a two dimensional quadratic function steps. This algorithm makes a lot of sense in the problems called ''best worst-case scenario". In these type of problems for finding the worst-case scenario we have to minimize a function and after finding the minimum we have to try to maximize that minimum to get to an overall good performance over a defined workspace. More discussion is done in section 3.3 where a optimization problem is explained for a simplified example of a two degree of freedom planar manipulator.

3.3

The M inim ax Culling A lgorithm

In this research, minimax culling optimization algorithm is introduced as as a very useful form of manipulator optimization technique. Culling algorithm is basically a discrete optimization algorithm that belongs to the branch and bound family of optimization algorithms [3]. The algorithm checks all the parameter space and identifies the non-optimal ones and culls them from the parameter domain, resulting a domain with just one element which represents the saddle point or the minimax point of the function. Hayward [7] used dynamic dexterity measure as the objective function s(p, x) =

List of symbols looping index Pi set of all the parameter in parameter space Pi design parameter ' Pi best known design parameter W set of all positions in workspace X end-effector position X position with the smallest performance value Sj : Pi -- % minimum performance measure upper bounding function Si : Pi -- % maximum performance measure lower bounding function s performance measure k~^ inverse of condition number s performance measure of best known design parameter i to optimize a planar pantograph haptic interface. This performance measure is not workspace inclusive and is a local function which make it easy for us to apply the new minimax opti mization algorithm. Dynamic dexterity measure index varies from zero to one as the manipulator travels from a singular point to ideally a best possible performance point over a workspace W and it is desired to find p* which is the best worst-case behavior of the manipulator throughout the I whole the workplace. p* = arg max min s{p, x) (3.2)

Minimax culling algorithm is specially designed to solve such a minimax problem. The algorithm is introduced in following flowchart from steps 1 to 10. Minimax Culling Algorithm 1. set z -- 0)

new best known parameter pi+i and a new best known performance measure sj+i will be calculated (step 5). In step (6) performance measure is calculated for each p in Pi at fixed æ ,- and the upper bound of optimal design will be updated. In step 7 the parameter with the performance worse than new upper bound will be culled from our search domain. As it is shown in the flowchart of algorithm, the parameter with the largest performance measure is transferred as the new optimum candidate Pi in step 8. All the step between 2 to 10 are repeated and in each iteration, culling algorithm will cancel part of parameter domain and

19

this process will continue until just one global optimum element remain in the parameter domain which is the global optimum answer. Since the algorithm is designed in a way, that just elements with singular value ratios worse than other elements will be culled from the domain, the global optimum is guaranteed. Moreover, as it is shown in algorithm flowchart, by keeping a constant search strategy, the culling algorithm is exploring the whole workspace in different configurations and gradually gets close to a sub-optimal space which is the key for convergence of the algorithm to optimum element [3]. Culling algorithm also exhibit a good efficiency due to the fact that in a bounded continuous range of parameter the algorithm remain continuous and holds more or less same quality of performance in that neighborhood. In another word, if the manipulator acts poorly in a configuration, mostly around that neighborhood, the quality of the operation of robot, nevertheless kinematically or dynamically, would be more or less the same. Therefore, if an specific point is culled from the parameter space, more likely the points in its neighborhood would be the best candidate to be culled from parameter space when evaluated at that position.

A n Exam ple of a Two Degree of Freedom M inim ax O ptim ization Problem

Consider the planar elbow manipulator of Fig. (3.2). In this example, a two dimensional geometrical concept of the algorithm is introduced to visualize the optimization process and have a general sense about the efficiency and reliability of the minimax culling algorithm. The example is illustrated in a good perspective to show how the algorithm converges. The performance index is s(x,p) = , the one that Hayward [7] used for examining

the manipulability of a two degree of freedom planar pantograph kinematic. For better geometrical imagination, it is necessary to reduce the parameter space to one dimension as
20

well as the workspace dimension. Therefore, a constraint will be introduced to ensure that the boundaries of usable and reachable workspace are separated well enough, ko and A :i are two safety margins to keep the manipulator away from the singularity points in internal and external boundaries shown in Fig. (3.2). Also a minimum safety margin of length K is introduced as a general safety margin such that [fco ^i] > K and I2 is defined as [6 ] I2 = max i\\y/^liax + y % \ \ y - h \ \ ) + K. (3.3)

this index is plotted in Fig. (3.3) against two variables, one working in operational space denoted as x and the another is p in parameter space. The value of Z i =
6 is selected as an initial condition for the best known parameter

As it is clear by this process the condition index is updated by (step 5). Now the parameter space at the configuration with x = 0.4 will be searched, and the upperbound 2% will get updated for each parameter (step 6), then parameters that have poor performance (non-optimal space) are culled from the original parameter space (step 7). li = 2.9 is the maximum point for s(x,p) curve while configuration is fixed at a: = 0.4 (step 8). In the next step the workspace of the li = 2.9 is explored (step 4 again) and s{x,p) reaches its maximum at s(5,2.9) = .16

Analysis of Culling Algorithm

The culling algorithm is specially designed for solving minimax problems and it is essentially part of family of optimization algorithm named branch and bound. In the process of bound ing there is no need to any worst-case estimate of the objective function and the algorithm works through explicit function evaluations [3]. The algorithm evaluates the condition index of a candidate parameter, then the computed value is used to push up the lower bound . Also for each new position, the condition number is computed for different parameter, and the value is used to push down the upper bound . When the value of the lower bound on the optimal performance index exceeds the upper bound on the performance index of any parameter, then the algorithm culls that parameter from the parameter space. The process of branching is also the other essential part of the culling algorithm where it can go to different direction exploring all the variables by switching between workplace

24

variable optimization to parameter space variable optimization and visa versa to end up to an integrated culling strategy. Simply in branching part of the algorithm, there is couple of successive alternation between workspace searches with fixed parameter and parameter space searches with a fixed position while the parameter and position is inherited from the result of previous iteration. It is essential to note that the result of the exhaustive global search will end up to the same global minimum obtained from culling algorithm in a more time consuming process [3].

Chapter 4 KINEMATIC DESIGN OF FIVE-BAR PLANAR HAPTIC DEVICE

Five-bar haptic device has a lot of applications in designing surgery devices. Karidis [1] introduced a balanced five-bar mechanism for micro probing. The basic design vision on kinematic optimization of a five-bar planar haptic device was presented by Hayward et al. [7]. Stocco [3] introduced a new definition of global isotropy and re-examined the kinematic and dynamic properties of a five-bar mechanism to achieve a dynamically and kinematically optimal design of a manipulator.

4.1

General Guideline For D esign and M ulti-objective O ptim ization of a Linkage For a H aptic Interface : A Case Study

There are many factors affecting the design of optimized linkage for a haptic device. Factors such as size, workspace, intrusion, inertia, response and structural properties are considered as the most important parameters influencing the design measures. The relationship between these parameters is discussed by Hayward [7]. As a haptic interface is essentially a human

26

machine interface, it must have the general features of an ergonomic design. In particular, the linkage for haptic applications should be compact and the workspace has to have a big size compared to the whole task space size. The haptic device should be designed in a way to fit on a table and its size should be about the size of a book [7]. On the other hand, having minimum intrusion in the work area of the user is another qualifying factor for the best design and usually it is difficult to quantify. However, quantitatively a low profile design compatible with the human hand would be the best choice [7 ]. Thus the size relations are the first general indicators of performance. Inertia could be another concern too. Practically, by considering the latest technology for designing the actuators and selecting the lightest design, an ideal inertia of fraction of a gram throughout a workspace (of the order .01 m^) [7] seems unreachable. Therefore, our trial will be focused on minimizing the inertia- of the whole mechanism. As it is shown in basic dynamics, first natural frequency is really a critical parameter for dynamic design. Therefore, the response of a haptic device, operating below first natural frequency, will be governed by its multi-body dynamics.The frequency of output stimulator should be far enough from the first natural frequency. On the other hand, the frequency response must be wide enough since humans are known to perceive force stimuli well above 300 Hz [7]. The manipulator should be designed in a environment free of backlash, friction, and other disturbing dynamics [7]. Although feedback and feedforward techniques can be applied to compensate for variation of transfer function, the expense for such a controller and suitable actuators could be high [2 ] and by making the design matrix such as Jacobian or inertia matrix more isotropic, the better and cheaper design for controller and smaller actuator can be achievable [2].

K inem atic D esign and O ptim ization of Planar FiveBar Linkage

Hayward [7] examined the five-bar linkage based haptic interface by using the inverse of condition number as dexterity measure and introduced the general strategy for optimizing the five-bar mechanism. Using culling algorithm and new definition of global isotropy as kinematic dexterity measure, Stocco [3] established a more detailed research about the planar five-bar mechanism dynamics and kinematics. The performance of a robot is highly affected by many parameters such as robot geometry and workplace position. As shown in Fig. (4.1), the workspace shape is assumed to be square with length w and position of the robot's workspace are represented by two parameters (r, 7) as polar coordinate of center of workspace and rj represents the angle of the workspace from the horizontal axes (workspace orientation). The main motivation for introducing 7 and rj as workspace parameters is to investigate symmetric properties of the device and to obtain for future design optimization. The geometry of the mechanism is defined by three parameter a, h and c representing the length for three links. The length of the ground link is represented by parameter 2o; shoulder link by parameter b and elbow link by parameter c. To create an environment with more robotic applications and more compatibility to different tasks, non of these parameter is allowed to be zero. In the formulation (4.1), (%, qi) act as input to the haptic device and (x, y) represent the output of the mechanism in the end-effector. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix that explains the relation between these inputs and outputs. As shown in eq. (4.1) to eq. (4.9) [3], the Jacobian matrix is function of position and link lengths.

Table 4.1: Reduced parameter space.

The isotropy is dependant on

[3] which is the ratio between resolution of movement

in the workspace and r (which shows the overall mechanism size). Since isotropy improves when r -- >oo ov w -- >0 , to avoid trivial answers, the w and r should be fixed in the whole process of optimization. Stocco [3] investigated effect of variation of all the seven independent parameter (a, bo, bi, cq, ci, 7, tj) and proved that the center of optimized workspace should be located on y axis (7 = 90°) and the workspace has no horizontal deviation angle ( 7 7= 0). As we mentioned before, all throughout the process two parameters are fixed (w = 1 0 and A(w) = 0.1). Moreover it was shown that the global optimization has the right and left symmetry of both robot and workspace and different shoulders and elbows have the same length (6 1= 6 0 ; Cl =
Co).

Therefore, for furthermore optimization just only three parameter

(a, b = bo = bi, c = cq = ci) need to be optimized in half of the operational workspace {x > 0) [3]. All mentioned stooco results is shown in table (4.2) [6 ]. In the next step to get to more practical manipulator, Stocco [3] optimized the link length of a symmetric five-bar planar haptic device kinematically and dynamically [3]. Using culling algorithm. Result of kinematical optimization for different locations of the workspace while constraining the elbow angles Aq, Ai G {0....7 t} is illustrated in Fig. (4.2) [3]. Fig. (4.3) shows a typical view of the workspace assuming r = 10 cm; w = 10 cm and

Table 4.1 represents the reduced parameter space [3] used during the optimization. Also Fig. (4.4) shows the dexterity and manipulability measure for a non-optimal parameter such as a = 5 cm; b = 11 cm; c = 17 cm; r =
30

15 cm. Fig. (4.5) also shows the

dexterity and manipulability measure for manipulator in the optimal point introduced as a = 4 cm ; 6= 9 cm; c = 15 cm; r = 15 cm. As it can be examined from Fig. (4.2) the optimized manipulator can be categorized to 4 general postures depending on how far the workspace is from the base. 1. elbow up:
2. "M" posture:

10 < r < 25 --8 < r < 10 --12 < r < -- 8 --25 < r < --12.

3. star posture: 4. elbow in:

4.3

K inem atic O ptim ization Conclusions

As it is clear on Fig. (4.2), Kinematic Dexterity curve is non-smooth and the optimal parameter curves (a, b and c) are discontinuous in r. These discontinuities happens in special locations on the Kinematic Dexterity curve when there is a switch from one posture to other. It can be concluded that although the performance curve is almost level in both star and M postures, the dexterity measure is not high enough and link lengths are longer than other postures which should be avoided. Elbow-up and elbow-in postures have good dexterity measures comparing to other two postures while elbow-out postures have smaller link lengths. Therefore, it seems that more compact mechanisms can be constructed by elbow-out postures having a relatively high acceptable dexterity measure. So from perspective of kinematic optimization, "M" posture is the best and the dexterity measure increases when r -- >oo. On the other hand, due to ergonomic constraints intro duced by hayward [7] the mechanism, should be assembled on a desktop and hold a space around a book which indirectly introduce upper constraint for r and consequently upper

So it can be concluded that all the elbow-out postures with r > 1 0 (when workspace width is 1 0 ) are in optimal space depending on r which is the distance between workspace and the base. In other words, the global optimum point for kinematic optimization exists and it can be obtained as r -- oo. A more natural method

of keeping device sizes reasonable is introduced in new multi-objective optimization method introduced in next section.

Chapter 5 A NEW STRATEGY IN MULTI-OBJECTIVE CONSTRAINT DYNAM IC OPTIMIZATION OF MANIPULATORS

Stocco managed to optimize 5 bar linkage kinematically [3]. To avoid complexity of multi dimensional multi-objective dynamic optimization, he introduced relationship between geo metric and inertial parameters and ended up with a one dimensional dynamic optimization problem [3] which is too simplified and is not so realistic. In this chapter, a new method for constraint multi-objective multi-dimensional dynamic and kinematic optimization is pre sented and the planar five bar linkage is used as a basic planar parallel manipulators for our case study.

Global M ulti-O bjective M inim ax O ptim ization of a Planar Five-bar H aptic D evice

In this section, the culling algorithm and dynamic and kinematic dexterity measures are used to re-examine the five-bar linkage based haptic interface for both dynamic and kinematic conditioning. In Fig. (4.1), the general feature of five-bar linkage with a square workspace is shown. For an inertial optimization, it is assumed that the device is held with a light finger grip so hand inertia is neglected. Stocco optimized the mechanism due to kinematic

39

conditioning and established the following symmetry and positioning guidelines for the device [3].
1 . Center of square workspace is located on y axis. (7 = 90°)

2. The square workspace is parallel to x axis.()y = 0) 3. The manipulator is symmetric to y axis.(6 0= 6 1 ;
c q=

ci)

4. The manipulator should not pass the singular points as it travels in the symmetric workspace. (0 < A q < 180°;
0 < Ai < 180°) [3].

Since the computation cost for global minimax algorithm is highly dependant on number of independent parameters, to avoid numerical complexities in matter of multi-objective optimization problems, it is necessary to have more simplified dynamic inertia in terms of number of independent variables [6 ]. In section 4.2 of this thesis, more symmetry and inertia guidelines were introduced to get to a more simplified model such as simplified inertia matrix derived in (5.3). In this section, a new global multi-objective algorithm is introduced to meet the complex ity problem of kinematic and dynamic conditioning of a planar five-bar mechanism. To get to best overall behavior from a reasonably small device, one should consider both kinematic and dynamic criteria simultaneously [6 ]. One option is to define a weighted function based on linear combination of kinematic and dynamic dexterity. Since the number of optimiza tion parameter increases, such methods could be computationally expensive and because of different nature of kinematic and dynamic dexterity, sometime the interpretation of result will be really complex or even meaningless. To avoid the difficulties involved in creating a weighted performance function, the parameter space of kinematic optimization problem has to be optimized and its domain must be narrowed down to kinematic optimal space. Then this kinematical optimum parameter space will be assumed as a sub-optimal domain to dynamic conditioning optimization problem to get to a final multi-objective optimal re
40

suits. In other word, the output of kinematic analysis will be used as input for dynamic analysis and the method could be computationally expensive. As it was discussed in section 3.4, kinematically optimized 5-bar linkage has the "Elbow out" posture (when r > 10 cm) and the performance increases as r -- >oo. The optimal link lengths are calculated by the culling algorithm and are illustrated as functions of r in Fig. (4.2). As shown in eqs. (5.11) to (5.14), inertia matrix of the whole the manipulator is function of four independent dynamic parameters r, /i, I 2 , m 2 {X 2 X 3 X are assumed to be constant). The objective function for our optimization problem denoted as S is the dynamic dexterity measure defined as: 5 (r, h , I 2 , m 2 ) = D D M = (5.33)

where matrix J is Jacobian matrix, M is inertia matrix of the manipulator and g_ and cr represents minimum and maximum eigenvalues, respectively. As shown in eq. (5.34) Finding the best worst case scenario of the objective function (S*) over entire workspace is our optimization problem.

S* = max min S (r, h , I 2 , m 2 )

(5.34)

The culling algorithm is proposed as an effective optimization method for finding the best worst case scenario problem, specially in manipulator design [6 ]. Solving the optimization problem respective to 4 independent variable (r, A, I 2 , m 2 ) results in a trivial answer which is presented in following conditions.

As described in the previous section, conditions explained as trivial answers are the global optimum solution for multi-objective optimization of a planar 5-bar haptic device. These answers are obviously not feasible answers. It can easily be imagined that since /sopt -- and rri2opt -- ^ 0

0, the optimum feasible answer must be the lowerbound of these two

parameters and , similarly, since ropt -- ^ oo

and Iiopt -- * oo , the upperbound of

these parameters must be the optimum feasible answers for the multi-objective optimization problem. So simply these feasible answers can be written in the following equations.

In the next section, a design guideline is proposed to find the lower and upper bounds of the inertial parameters. Moreover, the analysis will be based on the main characteristics of a good quality desktop planar haptic device that was investigated by Hayward [7]. In [7], the rough guideline for its size, in term of its footprint, was proposed to be around the size of a book. For practical purposes, the inertia of the whole system should be smallest within different design choices considering the lowest possible weight for actuators.

Since the whole mechanism should be constructed as a desktop device around size of a book, Topt ispredictable andcan be assume as r,,pt = 25 cm. The joint and rotor inertia is

dominatedby the inertia ofthe linkages which are made from circular cross-section 2024-T4 aluminum tubing of thickness t. Center of mass of the tube is in links geometric center and massper unit length is a function of wall thickness t and diameter d.Parameter t is assumed to beconstant and the minimum mass per unit lengthis calculated based on following equation to avoid resonance of the structure [3]. TUm m = d = 8.71 d (gr/cm) 5.1 X 10"® (6opf + CoptY w (cm) (5.39) (5.40)

By having rrimin as minimum mass per unit length, m^-iaw can be computed as:

Analysis of The Inertia Param eter On The D y  nam ic D exterity Meeisure (D im ensional A nalysis)

The dynamic equations for a planar five-bar haptic device is introduced through eqs (5.1) to (5.5). As it was already discussed, inertial behavior of such a mechanism is dependent on four variables (r, Ii, fg, mg) assuming that the manipulator already been geometrically optimized to get to sub-optimal link length domain defined in Fig. (4.2). Therefore, the link length are functions of r and can be written as a(r), b(r), c(r). Since in evaluation of dynamic dexterity measure introduced in (2.34) only the ratio between eigenvalues are important, it can be proved that the actual dexterity measure is only dependant just on three variables ( r, ^ ).

Validity of previous theorem can be easily shown by examining the different property of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix in basic matrix calculus. The theorem is, if a matrix is multiplied by a diagonal matrix or a scalar value, all the eigenvalues will be multiplied by the same scalar but the ratio of the eigenvalues remains the same. As it can be seen in (5.1) to (5.5), the value 7i can be factored as an scalar from the mass matrix as follows: M =h

It is proved from basic calculus that /i, as a scalar, has no effect on the dynamic dex terity performance. Therefore, two dynamic ratios M 2, 12 as dynamic parameters and r as workspace location are main three dominant dynamic parameters. In the new proposed multi-objective optimization method, the output of kinematic optimization will be used. It means that link lengths are assumed to be function of r Fig (4.2). Fig. (5.3B) shows the relation between M 2 and 12 in different workspace locations, ( parameters M2 and 12 are dimensionless and the resulting figure will make more sense ). Also in Fig (5.3A) the re lation between the D D M as dynamic dexterity performance relative to M2 is illustrated for different desktop sizes and results for r== 20 cm is presented in Table 5.1. The width of workspace is fixed to 1 0 cm and the resolution is A{w) = 0. 1 . Also the dexterity and the manipulability for a non-optimal and optimal dynamic parameter was shown in Fig. (5.4) and Fig. (5.5) during the process of the optimization.

In order to be able to compare the results in this thesis and Stocco method, the same design parameter will be assumed throughout this research, r^ax is 25cm and the elbow length is found to be c = 25 cm from the Fig. (4.2). Minimum mass per unit length is computed from eqs. (5.39) and (5.40) by considering Cm in = 25 cm and bmin = 13 cm from the Fig. (4.2). d = (5.1)10"®(13 cm + 25 cm)^(2007r) = .93 cm rrimin = 8.7 - ^ ?

It is concluded from (5.37) that m 2opt = m 2 -iow = 40 gr and hopt = h-up = 162,240 gr. By evaluating the parameter M2 by eq. (5.49) we can calculate 12 and consequently hopt from eq. (5.50). M2=m2opt 12 = .87 hopt = 12 hopt = (.87) (162,240) = 141,000 gr cm^ Therefor at the end the optimum parameters are introduced as follows: opt " 25 cm hopt = 162,240 gr cm^ hopt = 141,000 gr cm^ fn 2opt = 40 gr and mi = 960 gr Dynamic dexterity performance = .68 (dimensionless) = Î604o (25)^ = .1541 dimensionless

Case Study w ith Stocco's M ulti-objective O ptim iza tion M ethod

Stocco [3] proposed a multi-objective one-dimensional optimization method based on dy namic and kinematic conditioning. The method picks up the kinematically optimized geo metric parameters for different values of r Fig (4.2) and then tries to find configurations with best dynamic dexterity performance. Masses of links are calculated from (5.39) and (5.40) and assuming a uniform cross section of aluminum tubing for link structure, the mass moment of inertia of link relative to its end point can be calculated from equation I = All geometric parameters (a, b and c) are chosen as a function of r from Fig.(4.2) and just r is the only independent variable.After evaluation of dynamic dexterity introduced in (2.34), the maximum value for its performance canbe easily found fromFig.(5.6) and the optimum geometric parameters are:

Comparison Of Proposed M ethod W ith S tocco's M ethod

As it is shown in table 5.2 by applying the new multi-objective method proposed on the manipulator with the same dynamic and kinematic parameters, the actual dynamic perfor mance will be calculated as .5243 cm which is too far from .6810 which is the dexterity performance calculated by our new multi-objective method. Kinematic dexterity measure obtained from the new method is also better than Stocco method. Therefore, it can be concluded that the optimized 5 bar linkage with proposed method is more dexterous both kinematically and dynamically comparing to the manipulator optimized by Stocco Method. Since Stocco method is dynamically a one dimensional multi-objective optimization tech nique along parameter r, parameter space is very small and the method ignores more possible dynamic optimization along other main dynamic parameters such as (/i, I 2 , m 2 ) resulting poor outputs. But the optimization technique presented in this thesis is a four dimensional multi-objective optimization technique along four parameter (r, /i, I 2 , m 2 ). Parameter space is big enough and the results are more liable. Moreover, Stocco proposed Fig. (4.2) for kinematic design of 5 bar linkage and there is a high need for the respective optimization curves in dynamic studies. Presenting Fig. (5.3) and Table 5.1 as dynamic optimization results, in dimensionless form, could be one of the major contributions of this research which was totally ignored by Stocco's Research.

Chapter 6 CONCLUSIONS

6.1

Contributions

This chapter outlines the main contributions in this thesis and also some the challenging areas for future works is introduced. The contributions are summarized as follows:

· The exact inertia matrix for 5-bar planar haptic device. Comparing to other works [3] [11], this research uses the exact inertia matrix for the five-bar planar manipulator [34] and the optimization results are more realistic due to having a good dynamical model for the system. · Dimensional analysis of dynamic and geometric parameters. By using dimensional analysis, number of inertial parameters (/i, I 2 , m 2 ) reduced from three dependent variables to just two dimensionless independent variables {12, M2) introduced in section 5.5 . · The global multi-dimensional multi-objective optimization technique. As in other technique introduced by Stocco [3], there was a coupling between kine matic and dynamic parameters, due to (5.37) and (5.38), and these method can be

54

imagined more constrained optimization method rather than a global techniques. In the new techniques proposed the relation between geometrical parameter and dynamic parameters is removed and more number of dynamical parameter is explored to get to actual optimum parameters. Hence, the result of these optimizations are more close to a global optimum result than stocco multi-objective method. Moreover, due to the fact that, the new global multi-objective optimization techniques has a non-feasible trivial result , a new constrained techniques is developed by appli cation of design guidelines to avoid unrealistic results. In other word, since the global optimum is not achievable in reality, the closest parameters is selected as the feasible optimum results. · New design procedure and guidelines for five-bar linkage haptic device. A new design procedure for designing an dynamical and kinematical optimized desktop size haptic device is presented in section (5.4) and Fig. (5.2) . The main objective is to protect the device from resonance [7] [3] and consequently structural failure. Also in order to have a more fast-dynamic response system, the inertia of the system has to be minimized [7].

6.2

Future work

The future proposed works for dynamic and kinematic research of a five-bar linkage can be summarized as follows: · Effect of natural frequency of five-bar mechanism on the design. A very rough estimation of minimum natural frequency response is used by stocco [7] [3] as an additional design parameter. The mass per unit length is assumed to be uniform which is not an assumption in the new design method introduced in this thesis.
55

Therefore, more attempt is needed to have a better estimate of vibrational behavior of a five-bar haptic device with a non-uniform mass per unit length. Then we could use the results as more realistic constraint for finding a more realistic manipulator for industrial applications. · Application of the new technique on more complex manipulators with different dex terity measures. From point of view of engineering design for constructing a more dynamically fastresponse device, minimizing total mass of the whole mechanism is very important [7] [3]. Stocco introduced new dynamic dexterity measure to meet this requirement and proposed a new performance measure as which a is the biggest eigenvalue of the

dynamic dexterity matrix introduced in (2.34). The multi-objective optimization re sults is illustrated in Fig. (5.6) which is completely different from results in Fig. (5.5). Implementation of the Stocco dynamic dexterity with the new proposed algorithm in this thesis can be another interesting and challenging problem . Also application of the new method on more complex haptic devices such as twin-pantograph haptic pen or twin-pantograph hybrid manipulator [3] [2] [22] could be a good challenge for our new optimization strategy. · More theoretical and computational base sensitivity studies of all new optimization strategies in different kinematical and dynamical parameters and domains. Since in our optimization strategy all parameters discredited and some of them as sumed to be constant and there is lot of coupling between these variables and moreover just limited domain of parameters is selected during optimization process, so basically there is no guarantee for generalizing the results to other parameter domain,unless by establishing a convergence analysis independent than discritization and parameter
56

dimensions and domains [6].
