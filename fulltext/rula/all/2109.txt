Methodology for Fabricating High Temperature Composite Panel and Evaluation
  Gopinath Thamilselvan ­ Ryerson University, Toronto  Master of Applied Science ­ Aerospace Engineering ­ 2011    ABSTRACT    Ever  increasing  demand  for  composite  materials  in  the  aerospace  industry  has  lead  composite  manufacturers  to  develop  numerous  innovations  in  the  field  of  manufacturing.  Composites  play  an  important  role  in  engine  components  and  highspeed  jet  crafts  where  weight  saving  materials  that  can  sustain  high  temperatures,  with  little  reduction  in  performance  are  desired.  A  cost  effective  inhouse  novel  manufacturing  technique  aimed  at  producing  high  glass  transition  temperature  (Tg)  composite  panels  on  par  with  autoclave  manufacturing  technology  has  been  designed  and  built.  The  designed  compression  molding  system  is  integrated  with  an  oven,  to  cater  the  need  for  high  temperature  and  high  pressure  manufacturing  system  which  can  be  a  potential  alternative  for  autoclaves  in  terms  of  fabricating  panels  for  structural  testing.  Quality  of  the  panel  was  demonstrated  by  conducting  ultimate  tensile  test,  fatigue  test  and  microscopic  examination  results.  High  temperature  mechanical  testing  was  also carried out to study the behavior of high Tg IM7/RP46 composites fabricated at the laboratory.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 MOTIVATION   Advancement in the field of structural technology has paved the way for intensive research on materials  that  is  stable  at  extreme  environmental  conditions.  The  success  of  the  material  depends  on  the  flexibility,  durability,  ease  of  manufacturing,  damage  tolerance,  and  low  maintenance  cost.  One  such  innovation in structural application is advanced composite materials.  

Advanced  composite  materials  are  solid  materials  composed  of  continuous  fibre  arrangements  held  together  by  a  matrix  that  holds  and  surrounds  the  fibres  in  place.  Matrix  is  the  continuous  phase,  which  protects  the  reinforcement,  transfers  the  load  to  reinforcement,  but  often  a  limiting  factor  in  terms  of  operating  temperature.  The  highly  favorable  strength  to  weight  ratio  characteristics  of  advanced  composites  have  not  been  taken  advantage  of  in  high  temperature  applications  due  to  the  aforementioned  limitations.  While  numerous  research  programs  have  been  carried  out  on  low  to  moderate  temperature  composites  limited  studies  have  been  published  on  the  high  temperature  variety,  once  again  due  to  limitations  associated  with  the  polymeric  matrix  material.  Some  of  the  High  temperature  matrix  used  in  the  industry  includes  bismaleimides,  cynate  esters,  AMB21,  PMR15,  PMR II,  Avimid  N,  AFR700B,  and  RP46.  Researchers  have  found  the  applicability  of  those  materials  depends  on the ease of manufacturing, processability, nontoxic nature, and economic production.  Thermoset polyimides have been proven to be a viable solution for high temperature application as they  have  exceptionally  high  thermo  oxidative  stability  and  superior  mechanical  performances  at  elevated  temperatures.  Some  polyimides  along  with  fibre  reinforcements  have  used  temperature  ranging  from  100°C ­ 371°C, with the advantage of weight saving compared to a regular epoxy material, and excellent  resistance  to  moisture,  chemical  attacks  and  corrosion.  Fabrication  of  polyimide  composites  has  always  1   

been a feasible task but with heavy cost investment as it requires high processing temperature and high  pressure.   There  are  numerous  composites  manufacturing  processes  like  autoclave,  pultrusion,  compression  molding,  hand  layup,  filament  winding,  tow  placement,  and  resin  infusion  technology  that  exist  in  the  industry.  The  abovementioned  production  techniques  have  been  established  and  exploited  in  the  past  to  fabricate  composites  that  are  used  in  the  aerospace,  automobile,  and  sports  industry.  The  futuristic  research  relies  on  producing  advanced  composite  materials,  which  could  be  used  in  aero  engine  application, building small  satellites, and space exploration and give way to high speed civil  transport. In  order  to  study  the  suitability  of  the  materials  for  specific  application  experimental  studies  are  mandatory.  Therefore,  present  research  is  targeted  towards  the  futuristic  research  in  terms  of  manufacturing  advanced  composite  materials  in  a  cost  effective  manner  that  could  be  used  for  experimental  studies.  Very  few  technologies  are  compatible  for  producing  high  Tg  composites  which  involves  huge  equipment  cost.  So,  project  studies  were  focused  in  analyzing  and  coining  a  novel  technique  to  produce  the  samples  for  laboratory  experiments  with  an  economic  budget  instead  of  installing huge machineries whose expenses would increase  the production cost tenfold and  also invoke  heavy  maintenance  cost  in  the  long  run.  Hence,  the  need  for  cost  effective  production  technique  that  could produce test coupons to study the materials behavior is addressed with the solution in the current  research.

1.2 RESEARCH OBJECTIVE  The main aim of this research is to fabricate advanced high Tg(325°C) quality assured composite panels.  In  order  to  manufacture  the  advanced  composites,  resin  rheology  of  RP46  polyimides  and  other  high  Tg  resin  systems  were  studied.  Compatibility  of  the  fibre  reinforcement  and  the  cure  cycle  of  the  resin  system  were  thoroughly  understood  before  selecting  the  material  for  fabrication  process.  Cost  analysis  and  feasibility  studies  were  carried  out  in  order  to  design  a  cost  effective  manufacturing  set  up  for  producing advanced composite panels.   To  fulfill  the  objective,  a  selfreacting  mechanical  frame  structure  was  designed  in  general  purpose  CAD  software  in  consideration  with  the  available  space  and  economic  budget.  The  finite  element  analysis  was  performed  on  the  designed  cold  steel  frame  system  to  evaluate  the  structural  strength,  as  the  cure  cycle  required  a  highpressure  system  for  manufacturing  the  test  coupons.  Programmable  High  temperature  industrial oven was used  to control the  cure  cycle of  the resin system.  The  provisions were  made  on  the  high  temperature  industrial  oven  to  integrate  the  designed  mechanical  system  without  compromising the performance of the oven. The integration process necessitated a support structure to  carry  the  mechanical  system,  which  was  catered  by  L  frame.  Hand  layup  technique  was  studied  and  employed  to  wet  out  the  reinforcement,  which  was  later  transferred  to  compression  molding  tool  followed by curing procedure.  Final  stage  of  the  research  was  to  qualify  the  fabricated  composite  panel  by  conducting  microscopic  analysis,  scanning  electron  microscope  imaging,  uniaxial  ultimate  static  testing,  high  temperature  static  testing, and fatigue test.

2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW: 
Composites  have  been  playing  a  major  role  in  a  variety  of  aerospace  structural  applications.  Light  weight,  high  strength,  low  production  cost,  and  the  ability  to  tailor  the  mechanical  properties  makes  composites  a  fascinating  material  for  use  in  various  industries.  Research  is  being  carried  out  in  the  area  of  high  temperature  composites  in  order  to  coalesce  the  advantage  of  weight  saving.  Ceramic  matrix  composites with high temperature fibres and carboncarbon composites are limited due to the high cost  involved  in  their  fabrication  as  a  result  of  the  high  temperature  curing  as  well  as  the  cost  of  the  fibre.  The  emergence  of  high  speed  civil  aircraft  and  need  for  low  weight  engine  components  has  led  to  processing  of  various  high  temperature  polymer  matrices  that  have  both  thermo  oxidative  stability  and  high glass transition temperature. 

PMR  15  developed  by  NASA  was  the  forerunner  in  the  advent  of  high  temperature  resin  for  advanced  composites  in  high  temperature  application.  PMR  15  was  easy  to  process  and  also  had  high  thermal  stability  compared  to  the  conventional  epoxy  systems.  Restrictions  in  microcracking  from  thermal  cycling,  quality  control,  and  health  hazards,  limited  the  applications.  The  pursuit  for  ideal  high  temperature  resin  systems  still  continues  in  the  market  of  advanced  composite  materials,  as  a  result  a  number  of  high  temperature  polymer  systems  have  been  developed  and  employed  for  high  temperature applications.   Maverick  Corporation  has  developed  an  ultra  hightemperature  polyimide  [3],  MVK19  capable  of  withstanding  jet  engine  environments  up  to  700°F.  The  composite  parts  made  up  of  MVK19/Carbon  fibre  have  been  qualified  to  be  used  in  the  hottest  compressor  stages  of  military  and  commercial  jet  engines  since  1994.  MVK19  has  a  glass  transition  temperature  range  of  700725°F.  In  terms  of  thermal  oxidative  stability,  it  is  observed  to  have  24%  weight  loss  in  a  simulated  jet  engine  environment  at  4   

700°F,  at  70  psi  for  a  period  of  100  hours.  Thermal  gravimetric  analysis  shows  0.05%  weight  loss  from  200325°C.  High  temperature  thermosetting  polymers  such  as  bismaleimides  commonly  incorporate  a  discrete  toughening  phase  to  improve  impact  resistance.  Isothermal  aging  studies  at  temperatures  above  150°C  have  shown  a  tendency  for  these  systems  to  undergo  phase  separation.  The  phase  separation  can  be  observed with an optical microscope since it shows considerable darkening as exposure time increases.  Most  critical  damage  mechanisms  in  high  temperature  polymer  composites  are  due  to  the  formation  of  transverse  ply  cracks  and  inplane  micro  cracks  in  the  matrix  polymers  of  multiaxial  composites.  Matrix  cracking  can  result  from  initial  laminating  processing,  residual  stress  due  to  hygrothermal  exposures,  thermal  cycling  and  combined  effects  of  mechanical  and  environmental  cycles  [2].  Degradation  of  the  polymer  matrix  is  more  likely  due  to  thermal  instability  and  the  accelerating  effects  of  oxidative  attack.   Matrix polymers are stable in the inert atmosphere due to their highly crosslinked and aromatic nature.  Unfortunately,  Most  of  the  high  temperature  applications  involve  exposure  in  an  oxidizing  environment  where  both  carbon  fibre  and  polymer  matrix  are  susceptible  to  oxidative  degradation.  However,  oxidation  of  high  temperature  polymers  must  be  considered  in  composite  design  and  characterization.  Oxidation  is  usually  characterized  in  terms  of  weight  loss.  Various  matrix  systems  have  been  considered  for  high  temperature  application  such  as  bismaleimides,  cyanate  esters,  benzocyclobutene,  and  polyimides.  Studies  [20]  have  been  carried  out  and  candidate  polymers  were  ranked  in  terms  of  oxidative resistance from most stable to least stable: Polyimides, Polyarylenes   Bismaleimides, Cynate esters, Epoxies.

             The  advent  of  numerous  high  temperature  polymer  systems  demanded  composite  manufacturing  technologies  like  autoclave  and  compression  press  system.  One  such  attempt  to  manufacture  HTPC,  namely  RP46/carbon  composite,  using  an  in  house  developed  methodology  will  be  explained  in  detail.  Construction  of  IM7/RP  46  composite  panels  using  dry  molding  cycle  design  and  wet  molding  cycle  design  has  already  been  proposed[5].Results  show  that  both  the  cycle  yielded  wellconsolidated,  void  free  IM7/RP  46  composite  parts.  Unidirectional  IM7/RP46  laminates  with  62%  fibre  volume  fraction  were  manufactured  in  a  Wabash  hot  press  by  using  the  prepregs,  which  were  used  to  study  the  interlaminar  mode  I  fracture  of  composite  at  high  temperature  [21].  Feasibility  studies  related  to  cost  effective  manufacturing  of  composites  with  an  RP46  system  employing  vacuum  assisted  resin  transfer  molding  (VARTM)  was  found  to  have  issues  with  void  contents  due  to  release  of  volatiles  such  as  7   

methanol  and  water  during  the  infusion  stage  of  the  process  [13].  Laminates  made  by  VARTM  process  was  tested  for  mechanical  properties  and  thermal  properties  and  compared  with  the  RP46  samples  produced using the autoclave procedure.   Filament  winding and  tow placement were also  attempted by  industries  to  overcome  the  labour  intensive  prepreg  layup  methods  [17].  Pultrusion  techniques  were  investigated on PMR15 composite by Alcoa [10]. Results concluded that fully imidized PMR15 could be  successfully  pultruded,  although  the  mechanical  properties  and  void  content  indicated  that  further  research has to be done to produce a quality assured panel.  2.1 COST ANALYSIS OF HIGH TEMPERATURE COMPOSITES MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES  The  following  table  shows  the  cost  of  manufacturing  the  high  temperature  composite  panel  using  various  fabrication  techniques,  which  is  prevalent  in  the  aerospace  industry.

3.0 MATERIALS SELECTION FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE LAMINATES 
Material  selection  is  of  prime  importance  for  the  best  output  and  production  efficiency.  It's  a  part  of  process  development  to  exploit  the  properties  of  the  materials  to  favor  the  manufacturing  project.  Factors  such  as  overall  product  design,  processing  methodology,  and  environmental  conditions  under  which the final product could work efficiently are some important considerations. The material selection  process  involves  studying  the  available  resources  in  the  composite  industry  and  compatibility  of  the  resin system with the reinforcement. The production of high temperature composites has two aspects: n  labour  intensive  prepreg  production  and  component  fabrication.  A  short  introduction  about  the  reinforcements  and  prepregs  will  be  presented  in  the  upcoming  sections.  It  is  required  to  review  the  basic  terminologies  involved  in  the  composites  industry  in  order  to  understand  the  material  selection  process.  3.0.1 Classification of laminates  1. Unidirectional laminates ­ fibres are oriented in single direction   2. Bidirectional laminates ­ fibres run in 0 and 90 degrees.  3. Multidirectional Laminates  fibres oriented in various directions.  4. Woven  Fabric  Laminates  ­  patterns  of  fibre  weaved  to  form  a  sheet.  (Currently  used  in  the  research)  5. Interplay Hybrid Laminates ­ different layers of fibres laminated together ( Ex: Carbon, Kevlar)  3.0.2 Fibre Terminologies   Fibres have high aspect ratio. Fibre lengths less than 0.5 cm are classified as whiskers. Chopped fibres of  length  0.54.00cm  in  are  called  staple  fibres.    Group  of  filaments  are  called  tow  or  strand.  The  longitudinal  direction  of  the  fibres  is  called  the  warp  or  machine  direction  at  usually  0°.  The  direction  of  9   

interwoven  crossing  fibres  is  called  the  weft,  woof,  fill  or  transverse  direction.  The  direction  that  cuts  fibre at 45° is called the bias. Edges of the rolls are called slevage edges.   3.0.3Prepregs:  Optimum  performance  of  laminate  is  obtained  using  unidirectional  prepregs.  Crimping  diminishes  the  strength  in  the  woven  prepregs  fabric.  Unidirectional  or  interwoven  fibres  with  partially  cured  resin  matrix  are  called  prepregs  (Fabrics  preimpregnated  with  matrix  resin).  The  prepregs  are  then  partially  cured  so  that  it  does  not  run  off  the  fibre.  Bstaged  resin  coating  must  include  the  entire  hardening  agent and required constituents for full curing. Typically prepregs are refrigerated for 6 months at 0°C. A  comb  like  structure  is  used  to  collimate  the  fibres  so  that  they  do  not  cross  over  each  other  resulting  in  uniform  columns.  This  is  later  drawn  in  sheets  of  fibres  that  are  directed  onto  a  surface  of  thin  papers  which  has  a  thin  coating  of  resin.  Prepreg  sheets  are  placed  on  another  sheet  of  resin  with  the  coated  paper  on  top.  These  sheets  are  then  pressed  into  the  rolls  to  achieve  wet  out.  Prepregs  have  drape,  the  property that helps it to conform to the shape of the mold. It also has tack, as the resin is not fully cured.    3.1 REINFORCEMENTS INTRODUCTION:  Composites  are  made  up  of  fibre  and  matrix.  The  fibre  has  the  major  influence  on  the  mechanical  properties  of  the  composite  part.  Fibres  have  high  aspect  ratio  hence  load  can  be  transferred  onto  the  fibres  along  the  long  axis.  It  was  believed  that  fibres  with  noncircular  cross  sections  having  larger  perimeters  than  circular  fibres  might  have  improved  adhesion  to  the  matrix  materials  and  therefore  improved  properties  in  the  final  composite  part.  Initially  some  favorable  results  were  reported  but  they  are  not  widely  used  in  industry  and  are  typically  not  commercially  available.  The  rates  of  composite  properties  like  tensile  strength,  modulus  of  elasticity,  flexural  strength  and  elongation  are  noticed  to  increase sharply until fibre are about 3 inches.  

10   

 An  important  consideration  that  has  been  proven  significant  in  the  selection  of  type  of  fibre  is  mechanical  properties  and  density,  which  is  a  combination  of  the  advantage  of  strength,  stiffness  and  light weight.  3.1.1 Types of Reinforcements and its Applications:  In  the  present  section  different  types  of  reinforcements  are  addressed  with  reference  to  their  characteristics  and  properties.  A  thorough  knowledge  of  reinforcements  could  assist  in  narrowing  down  the  process  of  material  selection.  In  the  present  research  availability  of  material,  material  cost,  processability,  storage  ability,  and  feasibility  were  considered  in  selecting  the  material  for  manufacturing with an inhouse built fabrication technique. 

 Glass  fibre  is  an  amorphous  material  that  consists  of  silica  with  various  oxides  to  give  specific  compositions  and  properties.  Glass  fibres  have  high  specific  strength  and  used  in  high  volume  for  manufacturing  modern  composite  due  to  low  cost.  These  fibres  are  almost  always  used  in  combination  with  polymeric  resin  as  the  matrix,  hence  the  class  of  materials  is  known  as  Fibre  reinforced  Plastics  (FRP).    There  are  varieties  of  glass  fibre  used  in  the  composite  industry  namely  Eglass,  Sglass,  Cglass  and  quartz.  Eglass  fibres  are  used  in  electrical  devices  as  it  has  high  electrical  resistivity,  good  strength  and  low  cost.  Sglass  has  higher  strength  and  better  retention  of  mechanical  properties  at  elevated  temperature  in  par  with  Eglass.  Whereas  quartz  is  used  in  applications  where  superior  softening  point  temperature and superior electrical transparency are needed.    Continued  demand  for  high  strength  and  higher  stiffness  led  to  the  development  of  carbon  fibres.  Presently, carbon fibre has the highest specific strength and highest specific modulus of any material.  Carbon  fibres  are  manufactured  using  polyacrylonitrile  (PAN),  Pitch,  and  rayon.   PAN  based  fibres  have  good properties with low cost for standard modulus products. Pitchbased fibres have high modulus and  good  thermal  conductivity.  Rayonbased  fibres  were  the  first  carbon  fibres  that  were  manufactured  in 

11   

the  composite  industry.  PAN  and  pitch  undergoes  various  steps  like  stabilization  under  tension  followed  by  carbonization  and  graphitization  in  the  nitrogen  atmosphere,  achieving  high  strength  and  stiffness  properties.  The  PAN  and  pitch  based  carbon  fibres  are  further  categorized  into  standard  modulus,  intermediate modulus and ultra high modulus.    Carbon  fibre  has  high  tensile  strength,  high  tensile  modules,  high  stiffness,  low  weight,  negative  coefficient  of  thermal  expansion,  excellent  thermal  conductivity,  creep  resistant,  not  susceptible  to  fatigue,  chemically  inert  and  possesses  an  excellent  damping  characteristic  which  makes  it  a  unique  option for a number of applications.  The  other  classes  of  fibres  are  aramid  and  organic  fibres,  which  include  ultra  high  molecular  weight  polyethylene,  nylon  fibres,  Kevlar  etc.   Aramid  fibre  often  doesn't  require  sizing  unlike  glass  and  carbon  fibres.  Aramid  fibre  has  more  elongation  than  any  other  fibre,  which  results  in  high  toughness  an  important  property  makes  it  compatible  for  the  majority  of  applications  involving  composite  materials.  When  fibres  fail,  they  break  into  small  fibrils  this  unique  failure  mechanism  of  aramids  are  responsible  for  their  high  strength  and  high  toughness.  Aramid  is  resistant  to  most  of  the  solvents  and  has  good  resistance to  heat. Light weight, strength, modulus, toughness, impact  damage  prevention and pressure  strength retention has found a special niche in making bullet proof vests and high performance pressure  vessel.  Powder  of  ultrahighmolecularweight  polythene  has  been  molded  into  articles  such  as  cutting  boards,  snowboards  where  high  strength  and  scuff  resistance  are  important.  UHMWPE  are  also  called  extended  chain  polythene  fibres  (ECPE).  Molecules  of  ECPE  have  a  crease  rod  like  structural  shape  similar  to  aramid  fibres  that  have  a  high  degree  of  molecular  orientation  and  high  crystallinity.  UHMWPE  fibres  have same toughness as aramid fibres have the advantage over weight.  Boron  and  silicon  carbide  are  high  modulus  reinforcements  made  from  chemical  vapor  deposition  process.  Boron  fibres  have  the  unique  feature  that  combines  good  tensile  properties  with  good  12   

compressive  properties.  Boron  fibres  have  been  used  in  construction  of  stabilizers  for  F14  and  F1  aircrafts  as  well  as  many  sports  products.  Boron  fibres  combined  with  metals  like  aluminum  are  used  as  tubular  struts  in  frame,  rib  truss  members  in  space  shuttles.  Silicon  carbide  has  the  ability  to  retain  bonding  strength  to  the  matrix  even  at  high  temperature  processing.  SiC  fibres  with  aluminum  have  been  used  in  aircraft  wing  structural  elements  as  well  as  missile  body  casting.  Applications  also  include  SiC fibres in a titanium matrix for drive shafts and fan blade construction.

The number of parameters considered in selecting the reinforcement is dependent upon the application  being  considered.  Some  of  these  important  parameters  are  yarn  weight,  thread  count,  weave  pattern,  and fabric finish. The fabric thickness, weight, and strength are determined by the yarn weight.  The  basic  weave  patterns  that  are  normally  used  in  the  industry  are  plain,  twill,  basket,  four  harness,  eight  harness,  and  leno.  However,  woven  fabrics  are  not  limited  to  these  styles  as  they  can  be  tailored  to any desired pattern and style depending on the application.  The  plain  weave  consists  of  yarns  interlaced  in  an  alternating  fashion,  one  over  and  one  under  every  other yarn, which provides good fabric stability but is not considered beneficial in terms of pliability. The 

14   

plain  weave  intermediate  modulus  carbon  fabric  is  currently  used  in  the  high  temperature  panel  fabrication.  Basket  weave  is  more  pliable,  flatter  and  stronger  but  is  not  as  stable  as  plain  weave.  The  four  harness  and  eight  harness  fabric  are  similar  in  weave  pattern  and  both  have  the  advantage  of  pliability  which  makes  them  a  better  choice  for  forming  over  curved  surface.  Twill  weave  is  pliable  and  has  better  drapability  than  plain  weave  while  has  more  fabric  stability  than  four  or  eight  harness  satin  weave.  In the present study we are focusing on producing thin flat advanced composite panels by implementing  a  novel  manufacturing  apparatus.  More  stable,  stiff  plain  weave  carbon  fabric  is  easily  available  in  the  industry,  which  is  commonly  used  for  manufacturing  composite  components.  Plain  weave  helps  the  manufacturing technique by producing an ideally void free flat panel.   3.2 MATRIX SYSTEMS  Matrix  is  the  dispersed  phase  in  the  composite  structure,  which  provides  bulk  form  to  the  materials  by  holding  the  fibres  in  a  certain  orientation.  They  protect  the  reinforcement  from  abrasion;  helps  transfer  the  loads  uniformly  between  the  fibres  and  provide  interlaminar  shear  strength.  The  matrix  has  influences  the  mechanical  properties  of  composites  such  as  transverse  modulus,  shear  properties  and  properties  in  compression.  Normally,  matrix  materials  limit  a  composite's  service  temperature  in  high  temperature application. 

Polymers  are  the  most  commonly  used  matrix  materials  for  the  fibre  composite.  Depending  on  their  structure,  temperature  increases  the  effect  on  their  properties  and  classification  of  thermoplastics  or  thermosets.  Thermoplastics  consist  of  linear  or  branched  chain  molecules  having  strong  intermolecular  bonds,  which  can  be  melted  or  solidified  reversibly  and  reshaped  with  the  application  of  heat  and  pressure. The thermosets have crosslinked covalent bond between molecules. Once solidified by curing, 

15   

it  cannot  be  reshaped  or  melted.  It  can  only  decompose  to  an  amorphous  polymer  structure  above  a  certain temperature called the glass transition temperature.      Table 2: Properties of some commonly used Thermoplastic and Thermosetting Polymers [Ref. 1] 

                          3.2.1 Phenolics  Phenolics  are  formed  from  the  condensation  polymerization  reaction  between  phenol  (an  aromatic  molecule)  and  formaldehyde.  They  have  high  shrinkage  and  are  quite  brittle  because  of  high  cross  link  densities.  Phenolics  have  excellent  flammability  performance,  low  smoke  generation,  low  smoke  toxicity,  low  heat  transfer,  high  thermal  stability,  high  electrical  resistance,  excellent  resistance  to  chlorinated  solvents,  chemical  resistance  and  good  adhesion.  Despite  above  mentioned  properties  and  attractive  price.  Phenolics  are  less  commonly  used  than  epoxies  and  polyesters  due  to  the  difficulty  in  processing  phenolics.  When  compression  molding  the  phenolics  in  a  hot  press,  the  mold  is  slightly 

16   

opened  during  the  cure  cycle  permitting  the  vapors  to  escape,  this  process  is  called  bumping  or  breathing the mould.  

To  minimize  the  condensated  bubbles,  phenolics  are  often  initially  cured  at  temperatures  below  the  boiling  point  of  water  and  then  post  cured  at  higher  temperatures  to  advance  the  amount  of  cross  linking.  Phenolics  have  less  flame  spread  index  and  specific  optical  index  when  compared  to  epoxies,  vinyl esters and flameresistant polyester.  The  phenolic  matrix  system  can  be  molded  to  composites  using  pultrusion,  filament  winding,  sheet  molding  compound  and  hand  layup  technique.  Filament  wound  pipes  made  of  latent  acid  cured  phenolic matrix attains a Tg of 230°C after post curing process.  3.2.2 Cyanate Ester (CE) Resin   Cyanate  ester  (CE)  resins  belong  to  a  family  of  high  temperature  thermosetting  resins  that  bridges  the  gap  in  the  thermal  performance  between  the  epoxy  and  polyimide.  CE  is  high  cost  resin  with  a  good  combination  of  desirable  characteristics  like  low  dielectric  loss,  low  moisture  absorption,  low  shrinkage  and  low  out  gassing.  The  CE  systems  produce  fewer  micro  cracks  overall  after  2000  cycles,  with  micro  crack density increasing rapidly from zero to 500 cycles and then stabilizing (Ref. ASTM chap CE, Pg: 128)  Some  of  the  cyanate  ester  resins  are:  Bisphenol  A  dicyanate,  ortho  Methyl  dicyanate,  Arocy  L10,  Phenol  triazine,  and  XU71787  0.2L  whose  Tg  varies  between  a  range  of  252°C  to  320°C.  CE  is  available  as  hot  melt  prepregs,  tow  prepreg,  Resin  Transfer  Molding  (RTM)  resin,  adhesive  system,  and  syntactic  core  material  which  can  be  produced  into  composites  using  auto  clave,  press,  Pultrusion,  RTM,  Seaman's  composite  resin  injection  molding  or  Vacuum  assisted  resin  transfer  molding  methods.  CE  resins  are  normally post cured to 235°C to 315° C for structural service temperatures at or above 180°C. 

17   

3.2.3 Bismaleimide Resins (BMI)  BMIs  are  also  most  commonly  used  thermoset  polyimides  in  the  advance  composite  industry.  BMI  monomers  are  prepared  by  the  reaction  of  maleic  anhydride  with  a  diamine.  BMI's  have  excellent  process  ability,  balance  of  thermal  and  mechanical  properties,  and  almost  constant  electrical  properties  over a wide range of temperature. It can be operated up to temperature of 232°C (450°F) and processed  using  Resin  Transfer  Molding.  BMI's  have  high  compression  after  impact  strength  which  certifies  itself  for  aerospace  applications  namely  F22  fighter  jet  wings,  C17  aft  flap  hinge,  thrust  reverser  structures,  and helicopter tail boom.

3.2.4 LaRC RP46  LaRC  RP46  is  an  ultra  high  temperature  thermosetting  polyimide  resin.  RP  46  has  exceptionally  high  thermooxidative  stability  and  higher  mechanical  property  even  at  elevated  temperatures.  Composites  made  of  RP  46  have  a  service  temperature  ranging  between 100°  to  370°C  and  withstands  up  to  816°C  for  a  few  seconds.  RP  46  has  excellent  resistance  to  corrosion,  moisture,  chemical,  low  dielectric  constant  and  low  coefficient  of  thermal  expansion.  RP46  provides  considerable  weight  savings  over  any  epoxies,  which  offer  advantages  for  use  in  aircraft  engine  components,  small  satellites,  missiles  and  electronic circuit boards [10].   RP46  was  used  in  the  current  research.  It  was  found  to  be  economic  and  easily  processable  when  compared  to  other  high  Tg  resin  system.  The  curing  cycle  of  RP46  is  designed  to  remove  the  air  pockets  or  voids  caused  due  to  moisture  entrapment.  The  reason  for  selecting  the  RP46  resin  system  was  favourable  cure  cycle.  Staging  at  the  initial  curing  phase  helps  removal  of  methanol  or  any  moisture  entrapped between the fibre and matrix interphases.   3.3 POLYIMIDE RESIN  Experience from the past  about chemical structure reveals that aromatic polyimides with stiff molecular  backbone  from  internal  bonding,  crosslinking  or  high  crystalline  were  found  to  have  outstanding  thermal  and  thermooxidative  stability.  One  such  polymer  is  polyimide,  which  can  be  classified  as  either  thermoplastic  or  thermoset.  There  are  two  types  of  polyimide,  condensation  type  and  additional  type.  End capped polyimides are synthesized by combining three monomers: two react to form polyimide and  one  attaches  to  the  ends  of  the  chains  to  form  the  end  caps.  Polyimides  tend  to  be  hard  to  process  due  to their condensation reaction emitting water during cure and are relatively brittle when cured.

3.3.1 Polyimide for Aerospace Application  In  order  to  overcome  the  deficiency  of  the  conventional  materials  namely  density,  strength,  temperature  resistance,  thermal  cycling,  water  absorption  and  retention,  radiation  shielding  capability,  acid  and  base  resistance,  transmissivity,  thermal  resistance,  and  bonding  capabilities,  novel  multifunctional  polyimides  have  been  produced  by  NASA's  Langley  Research  Center.  We  know  aluminum  structure  for  the  satellite  weighs  in  the  scale  of  tons,  which  could  be  replaced  with  LaRC  RP46,  a  novel  material  embodied  with  new  states  of  matter.  SprayOn  Polyimide  (SOP)  foam  could  be  used  on  the  inside  of  the  fuel  tank  instead  of  the  elastomeric  foam  with  limited  temperature  range  on  the  exterior  of  the  external  tank.  This  application  will  save  weights  by  four  fold  in  addition  to  providing  dual  thermal  protection  to  the  structures.  The  advantage  of  using  SOP  is  low  density,  higher  temperature  resistance,  and  better  light  and  chemical  resistance.  In  compensation  for  the  high  cost  it  has  ten  times  better  shelf  life  and  reproducibility,  reliability,  and  dependability  than  conventional  materials. 

High  temperature  polyimide  foams,  known  as  TEEK  developed  using  saltlike  process  are  not  flammable  when  tested  at  1090°C  for  25  sec.  They  have  excellent  hydrolytic  stability,  limited  oxygen  index,  compression strength, thermal insulation and cryogenic capability.  Flexible  TEEK  foams  are  well  suited  for  acoustic  and  thermal  insulation  in  variety  of  applications  including  aircraft,  spacecraft,  ship  hulls,  automobiles,  electronics  and  building  construction.  Structural  components  such  as  panels,  struts,  ball  bearings,  races,  tubing,  connectors,  pressure  vessels,  housing,  casings  and  stringers  can  be  made  with  RP  46  polyimide.  The  Polyimide/graphite  composites  have  a  density  of  1.50  g/cc  compared  to  lightest  lithiumaluminum  metal  alloy  with  2.53  g/cc  and  also  has  high  specific strength in temperature range of 320°C. Experiments show that exposure of T650/RP 46 has less  weight loss and thermooxidation induced damage than T650/PMR15 at 343°C for 500 hrs.

PMR15  is  one  of  the  leading  high  temperature  matrix  resin  developed  by  NASA  in  1970s.  However,  PMR15 had serious limitations such as nonreproducible processing and severe micro cracking, which is  aggravated  by  thermal  cycling.  PMR15  is  an  endcapped  polyimide.  It  is  synthesized  by  an  imidization  reaction  and  then  the  chainlengthening  step  follows  an  end  cap  step.  PMR15  can  be  typically  used  in  the temperature range of 550600 °F for continuous service and at 900°F for short durations.  Polyamides  carry  a  high  surface  charge  potential,  which  could  be  exploited  to  be  used  as  an  outer  surface  coating  for  lunar  space  suits  to  adjust  the  surface  potential  voltages  to  repel  lunar  dust,  which  was  earlier  reported  as  a  severe  problem  in  Apollo  16  mission.    Some  of  the  commercially  available  polyimides  are  AvimidN,  AvimidK3A,  AFR  700B,  PMR15,  PMRII50,  LARCSI,  PETI5  and  superimide  800.Here is a graph depicting the service temperature of the polymer matrix materials.

                                                3.4 CONCLUDING REMARKS    In this chapter we had a detailed discussion about the various options available for the selection of fibre  reinforcements  and  matrix  systems  for  fabricating  high  temperature  flat  composite  panels.  The  reason  for  selecting  RP  46  resin  system  and  carbon  fibre  reinforcement  was  discussed  briefly.  In  the  following  section a review of manufacturing technologies that is already used in the industry is discussed in detail,  which  serves  as  the  base  for  designing  a  new  manufacturing  system  to  produce  consistent  quality  panels.          22   

 

CHAPTER 4    
4.0 MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES 
Advancement  in  the  field  of  aerospace  industry  has  led  development  of  various  design  and  manufacturing  process  to  meet  the  ever  increasing  demand  for  advanced  materials.  Therefore  manufacturing  processes,  aerospace  materials,  and  associated  designs  must  be  optimized  in  an  integrated  manner  to  deliver  product  competitiveness.  With  the  advent  of  new  materials,  product  development  and  manufacturing,  processes  have  to  be  given  more  importance  to  produce  defect  free  final products with minimal wastages in raw materials. 

Materials  selection  and  contour  of  the  final  product  also  plays  an  important  role  in  selection  of  manufacturing  process.  In  producing  composites  there  is  a  wide  option  in  selection  of  fibre  reinforcement  and  resin  material  to  attain  unique  set  of  properties  such  as  strength,  stiffness,  heat  resistance,  etc.    Some  of  the  common  manufacturing  processes  in  producing  composites  are  discussed  in the following section to compare the feasibility and cost effectiveness in producing the component.  4.1 OPEN MOLDING OF ADVANCED COMPOSITES  Manufacturing  methods  for  advanced  composites  are  established  taking  into  account  the  difficulties  faced in the standard manufacturing process. 

1. Fairness in controlling the fibre/resin ration  2. Wetting out the entire fibre volume  3. Minimizing the void content  4. Controllability in aligning the fibre direction  5. Optimizing the amount of fibre to get the maximum benefit

4.1.1 LayUp Molding  Almost  any  size  and  shape  parts  can  be  manufactured  by  layup  processes  at  low  production  rates.  Various  forms  of  reinforcements  include  chopped  strand  mats,  woven  roving,  woven  yarns,  or  cloths,  usually  available  in  the  form  of  a  roll.  Unrolled  fibres  are  cut  to  desired  shapes  using  templates  or  patterns at  desired orientations. The simplicity of the layup process and general manual nature of resin  application  allows  a  wide  variety  of  resin  selection  such  as  polyester,  vinyl  ester,  phenolic  and  epoxy.  The hand layup process involves low investment cost and little prior working knowledge, but it is highly  sensitive  to  the  skill  level  of  the  operator.  This  is  considered  as  one  of  the  potential  methodology  for  producing  flat  panels  of  uniform  thickness  in  the  low  production  facility,  which  better  suits  our  current  requirement. 

 
Figure 4: Hand Layup/Wet Layup [Ref. 18] 

4.1.1(a) Manufacturing Procedure:   The  first  step  in  the  hand  layup  is  cleaning  the  surface  of  the  mould,  followed  by  the  application  of  release agent for easy part removal. Thin layer of gel coat is normally applied for better surface finish of  the final product. After the gel coat is set, alternating layers of fibre and resin is placed on top of the gel  coat.  Resins  are  generally  catalyzed  with  hardeners  and  accelerators.  Fibre  impregnation,  removal  of  air  24   

bubbles,  and  coverage  of  all  reinforcement  is  accomplished  with  rollers,  squeegees,  or  stipple  brushes.  Generally the brush method is used for the application of resin in the case of low production rates, while  spray  guns  or  pumping  systems  are  preferred  by  manufacturers  to  achieve  consistent  resin  mix  for  better  fabric  wet  out.  The  wetted  fibre  is  then  cured  in  standard  atmosphere  or  in  oven  at  elevated  temperatures.  The  completely  cured  part  is  finally  removed  from  the  mould  and  unwanted  edges  are  trimmed to produce the final product.  Despite  being  a  simple  technique,  hand  layup/wet  layup  has  limitations  in  terms  of  production  rate.  Laminate  quality  depends  on  the  skill  level  of  the  personnel  like  mixing  resin  without  bubble  formation,  controlling laminate resin content.  4.1.1(b) Prepreg Layup  The  prepregs  layup  room  should  be  environmentally  controlled  by  maintaining  constant  temperature  and  filtering  the  air  to  eliminate  dust.  Contamination  with  silicone  impurities  on  the  layer  is  an  important  consideration  as  it  affects  the  ability  of  bonding  prepregs  layer  to  another  layer.  Hence  silicone  based  mold  releases  are  not  used,  if  unavoidable,  then  type  that  is  less  volatile  and  nonaerosol  is employed. Automated machine layup suits well with flat panels and parts with moderate curvature. 

When using thermoplastic prepregs for manufacturing they are softened by heating with a hot air gun or  on a heating table as these materials do not have tack and drape under normal conditions.       4.1.2 Bag Molding  Though  prime  care  is  taken  during  the  hand  layup,  air  is  inevitably  trapped  between  the  layers  of  prepregs  or  fabric.  The  process  of  removing  the  air  after  the  layup  and  before  the  curing  is  called  debulking. Debulking is usually done after the layup of every four to six layers. This technique compacts  the  laminate  on  the  open  mould  surface.  Applying  the  vacuum  helps  remove  the  volatiles  in  the  resin  and  helps  in  the  movement  of  resin  during  the  curing  stage.  This  helps  is  lower  void  content  of  the  final  25   

part  and  eliminates  any  boundary  between  the  layers  thereby  reducing  the  chance  of  delamination.  High temperature composites can be manufactured by dry molding process or wet molding process. The  wet  molding  process  involves  the  usage  of  vacuum  bagging  procedure  at  certain  time  intervals  in  the  curing cycle.  4.2 VACUUM BAGGING PROCEDURE  Mold  is  prepared  by  coating  it  with  the  appropriate  mold  release.  The  part  is  built  with  the  desired  orientation  up  to  the  required  thickness  and  number  of  layers.  Release  film  (commonly  used  perforated  Teflon  sheet  or  Tefloncoated  glass  fabric)  or  peel  ply  is  placed  over  the  part  to  facilitate  pulling  all  the  bagging materials after the part is cured. Generally release films are porous to allow excess resin to flow  through  them.  Bleeder  is  applied  on  top  of  release  films,  which  serves  as  absorbent  for  excess  resin  in  the  system.  Resin  content  of  the  final  part  depends  on  the  ability  of  the  bleeder  material  to  absorb  the  required  amount  of  resin,  thereby  necessitating  thickness  calculation.  Breather  materials  are  applied  on  top  of  the  bleeder  that  acts  as  a  distributor  for  air  and  helps  escape  volatiles  and  gasses.  A  sealant  material usually a sticky polymeric tape is placed around the entire setup. Finally a vacuum bag made of  flexible  polymeric  film  is  pressed  onto  the  sealant  to  create  an  airtight  seal.  Vacuum  valve  connections  are  made  and  connected  to  the  vacuum  pump  to  suck  the  air  from  the  assembly  eventually  evacuating  the volatiles and gasses released during the curing process.

Figure 5: Vacuum Bagging Method [Ref. 18] 

4.2.1Pressure Bagging Procedure  In  pressure  bag  molding  positive  pressure  is  applied  to  inflate  an  elastomeric  bag  covering  the  laminate  on  the  open  mold  surface.  Magnitude  of  the  pressure  applied  can  be  approximately  300  kpa  compared  to 98 kpa in the vacuum bag method.  4.3 SPRAY UP MOLDING  Spray  Up  process  is  faster  when  compared  to  Hand  Lay  Up  in  terms  of  production  rate.  Parts  with  considerable  size  and  simplicity  in  design  can  be  manufactured  with  ease.  Spray  Up  process  requires  spraying  equipment,  more  limited  resin  choice  in  terms  of  viscosity,  and  high  air  pollution  because  of  spraying  the  resin.  The  major  drawback  is  its  inability  to  control  the  orientation  of  the  fibre  and  it  also  requires  highly  skilled  labour  to  manufacture  with  uniformly  distributed  and  controlled  thickness  for  better curing. Spray up molding is preferred to make boat hulls and decks for luxury cruisers, however it  is not considered ideal for producing flat panels.  

27   

The  spraying  equipment  has  a  chopping  mechanism  attached  to  the  gun.  The  fibres  are  fed  into  the  chopper  as  roving  and  then  chopped  so  that  they  fall  into  the  stream  of  resin  at  the  tip  of  the  nozzle.  Chopped fibres have to be short (13 in) for ease of spraying and to fill the tight areas of the mold. After  the  fibre  and  resin  are  sprayed  onto  the  mold,  a  roller  is  used  to  wet  out  the  fibre  bundles.  Normally  spray molding is used with polyester and glass roving. 

                                 
Figure 6: Spray up molding [Ref. 18] 

 

4.3.1 Drawbacks   Laminates  tends  to  be  uneven  in  resinrich  areas.  The  use  of  short  fibres  severely  limits  the  mechanical  properties  of  the  laminate.  Resin  has  to  be  low  in  viscosity  to  be  spray  able.  High  styrene  content  of  the  spray layup resins has the potential to be harmful.  4.4 COMPRESSION MOLDING (MATCHED DIE MOULDING)  Compression  molding  is  used  in  industries  were  high  volume  production  and  part  repeatability  is  required. In this method charge of uncured resin and fibre is placed in a cavity of the matched mold. The  male  mold  is  then  pressed  against  the  female  halves  thereby  exerting  the  pressure  and  squeezing  the  excess  material,  leaving  uniformly  filled  material  in  the  cavity.  The  application  of  pressure  and  elevated  temperature  causes  the  compound  to  flow  into  the  mould.  Heat  is  applied  through  the  heated  press 

28   

which  cures  the  material.  There  is  low  void  content  as  the  excess  materials  are  squeezed  out  and  amount  of  scrap  is  minimal.  Fillers  (calcium  carbonate  or  kaolin  clay)  are  used  as  inert  addictives  to  reduce the CTE, modify the viscosity, and increase hardness, rigidity, and dimensional stability. 

In  bulk  molding  compounds  (BMC),  chopped  fibre  is  mixed  with  initiated  resin  and  filler  to  form  a dough or paste like mass, whereas in sheet molding compounds (SMC) initiated resin and filler paste is  spread  onto  a  wide  carrier  film  and  then  fibreglass  is  chopped  and  sprinkled  across  the  coated  film.  Another  layer  of  coated  film  is  placed  on  top  of  the  chopped  fibreglass  and  the  sandwich  of  material  is  kneaded  between  rollers  to  wet  out  the  fibres.  The  initiator  is  normally  heat  active  peroxide  that  helps  maintaining  minimal  curing  during  the  manufacturing  process.  Compression  molding  technique  is  currently applied in the novel inhouse manufacturing set up.   4.5 RESIN INFUSION TECHNOLOGIES  Resin Infusion Technology can be used to manufacture advanced composite parts where direction of the  fibre  is  considered  important  in  terms  of  part  performance.  Some  of  the  advantages  of  using  resin  transfer  molding  are  better  quality,  repeatability,  lower  emission,  low  labour  requirements,  and  does  not involve additional equipment like autoclave, freezers, and bagging materials. 

Fabrics are laid up as dry stacks of materials, in many cases the fabric is prepressed to the mould shape  and  held  together  by  a  binder  known  as  preforms.  These  performs  are  laid  on  the  base  mould  and  the  second  mould  tool  is  clamped  over  the  base  mould.  The  resin  is  then  pressure  injected  into  the  cavity  wetting  the  fabric  completely  with  resin.  The  resin  is  allowed  to  cure  and  mold  is  opened  to  extract  the  final  part.  There  are  number  of  variations  applied  to  infusion  system  to  manufacture  composite  products, some of them are briefly discussed in this section. 

29   

Vacuum  is  applied  to  the  mould  cavity  to  assist  resin  being  drawn  into  fabrics.  Usually,  one  end  of  the  tool  is  fitted  with  the  resin  inlet  and  the  other  end  is  connected  to  the  vacuum  outlet.  The  vacuum  suction  pulls  the  liquid  into  the  preform,  enabling  complete  wet  out,  this  process  is  known  as  vacuum  assisted  resin  injection  (VARI)  or  vacuum  assisted  resin  transfer  molding  (VARTM).  It  requires  resin  of  lower  viscosity  and  unimpregnated  areas  can  occur  resulting  in  scrap  parts.  Generally  epoxy  resin,  vinyl  ester, phenolic, and high temperature reins like bismaleimides can also be used in the RTM process.  Resins  with  high  viscosity,  typically  resin  films,  are  used  in  the  manufacturing  process  called  resin  film  infusion.  Dry  fabrics  are  laid  on  the  mould  with  layers  of  thin  resin  film  in  between  the  layers.  The  lay  up  is  then  vacuum  bagged  to  remove  any  trapped  air  in  the  dry  preform  followed  by  application  of  heat  and pressure which allows resin's viscosity to decrease, permitting it to infuse into the preform.  4.6 FILAMENT WINDING:  This  process  is  normally  used  for  manufacturing  cylindrical,  hollow  circular  or  oval  section  components  like  pipes  and  cylindrical  tanks.  The  fibre  spools are mounted  on  a  rack  called  creek,  which  are  gathered  together  and  fed  through  the  comb  to  make  a  band  of  fibres.  The  band  enters  the  resin  bath  where  fibres  are  soaked  with  resin.  The  fibres  are  then  passed  through  the  roller  or  wiper  system  to  remove  excess  resin  and  directed  onto  a  mandrel  through  the  payoff.  The  payoff  is  placed  on  a  carriage  that  moves  along  the  long  axis  of  the  mandrel,  so  as  the  mandrel  rotates  synchronized  payoff  motion  produces  various  fibre  patterns  on  the  mandrel.  Filament  winding  is  suitable  for  making  composite  pipe  structure, pressure vessel, fuselage, rocket motors, power transmission shafts and sporting goods. Most  common  winding  patterns  are  hoop  or  circumferential,  helical,  longitudinal  or  axial  windings.  This  method  is  very  fast  and  economic  which  can  yield  very  good  structural  laminate  properties.  Recently,  highly  automated  fibre  placement  techniques  are  used  in  the  composite  manufacturing.  Fibre  placement  machines  have  an  advanced  controller,  a  high  precision  head  that  lays  the  fibres  and  a 

30   

carriage.  It  can  lay  up  fibres  up  to  nine  axis  of  rotation  essentially  required  to  manufacture  any  shape  part.

4.7 PULTRUSION  Pultrusion  is  a  continuous  process  with  high  material  utilization  and  can  be  used  for  high  volume  manufacturing  of  parts  with  constant  cross  section.  The  continuous  fibres  are  drawn  from  reels  through  a  resin  bath.  The  fibres  are  wetted  by  resin,  converged  and  passed  through  a  heated  die.  Inside  the  die  fibre  gets  impregnated  and  resin  contents  are  controlled.  The  wetted  reinforcement  is  cured  in  the  die,  which  is  then  pulled,  moved  into  the  cutter  and  trimming  station  where  the  finishing  process  is  performed. 

Advantages  of  pultrusion  are  fast  and  economic,  controlled  resin  content,  minimized  fibres  cost,  and  very  low  scrap  rates.  Pultrusion  method  was  used  for  manufacturing  composites  with  PMR15,  the  mechanical  properties  and  void  content  indicated  that  further  work  has  to  be  done  to  improve  the  production  process.  Pultrusion  is  a  cost  effective  automated  process,  which  is  apt  for  manufacturing  continuous and constant crosssection composite shapes.

4.8 DRY MOLDING OF ADVANCED COMPOSITES (USING PREPREGS)   Although  wet  layup  is  simple  to  process  and  needs  minimum  labour  skill,  there  are  a  number  of  reasons  for  using  a  dry  molding  technique  for  manufacturing  advanced  composites.  The  difficulty  in  aligning  the  fibres  exactly,  controlling  the  fibre/resin  ratio,  achieving  full  wet  out,  reducing  the  void  content,  difficulty  in  mixing  the  resin  and  application  of  the  resin  adds  up  to  the  complexity  in  hand  lay  up  using  resin  and  fabric.   On  the  other  hand  dry  molding  systems  enable  the  control  of  ply  thickness,  fibreresin ratio, and reduce internal stresses.   4.9 CONCLUDING REMARKS    A  clear  understanding  of  the  manufacturing  techniques  was  necessary  to  select  the  manufacturing  process  that  could  be  applied  for  high  temperature  composites  production  process.  The  manufacturing  techniques  present  in  the  industry  were  studied  in  detail  in  the  current  chapter  followed  by  detailed  description of the introduced novel manufacturing technology in the subsequent chapter.

CHAPTER 5            
 5.0 MANUFACTURING SET UP 
5.0.1 Scope of High Temperature Polymer Composite  Glass  transition  temperature  of  BMIs(bismaleimides)  were  limited  to  230°C  and  PMR15  faced  environmental  restriction  due  to  the  44``methylenedianiline  (MDA)  constituent  which  eventually  lead  to active research in the area of hightemperature polymeric materials to find more stable, low cost and  easily processable materials.  (Quickstep, 2010) 

In  the  1990s,  NASA  Langley  research  centre  developed  LARC  ­  RP46  by  replacing  MDA  with  3,  4 oxydianiline.  It  retained  the  properties  or  PMR15  combined  with  superior  processability  and  excellent  process  reproducibility.  The  composites  made  with  RP46  significantly  improved  thermooxidative  stability at 371°C when compared with existing PMR systems.  5.1 MANUFACTURING OF HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIALS  Increasing demand for high temperature materials has resulted in the development of various advanced  manufacturing  technologies  in  the  composites  industry.  However,  costs  involved  in  the  production  of  high  temperature  composites  remained  high  regardless  of  advancements  in  manufacturing  methods.  Due  to  the  demanding  temperature  requirements  and  applications  of  pressure  for  manufacturing  high  temperature  composites,  autoclaves  became  necessity  for  a  number  of  manufacturing  processes.  Cost  factor,  size  limitations,  and  complexity  involved  in  operating  autoclaves  led  to  the  proposal  of  novel  methodologies  to  produce  defect  free  high  temperature  composites.  One  such  attempt  made  in  the  present  study  to  replace  usage  of  an  autoclave,  with  a  novel  inhouse  manufacturing  technique  that  produces void free aerospace standard panels.

5.2 NOVEL MANUFACTURING METHODOLOGIES TO REDUCE PRODUCTION COST:  Review  The  following  section  discusses  the  possibilities  for  manufacturing  high  temperature  composites  by  not  using an autoclave, which increases the manufacturing cost by manifold.   5.2.1 Quick Step Technology  In  this  process  the  laminate  is  placed  in  between  the  flexible  bladder,  which  is  encapsulated  in  the  pressure  chamber.  The  pressure  chamber  is  filled  with  hot  fluid,  which  supplies  heat  required  for  curing  the  laminate.  The  circulating  fluid  exerts  pressure  through  the  flexible  membrane  onto  the  laminate  mould.  Features of Quick Step Curing:  · · Rapidly applying heat to the laminate, placed between a rigid and semi rigid mould  Mould  and  laminate  are  separated  from  the  circulation  HTF  (heat  transfer  fluid)  by  a  flexible  membrane  · · Use of balanced pressure and vacuum on the laminate to cure the part  Economical construction due to low pressure in both chambers

5.2.2 Construction of Pressure Vessel  An  alternate  production  apparatus  to  an  autoclave  is  a  pressure  vessel  with  a  heating  element  and  pressure  control.  The  metallic  cylinder  with  a  hemispherical  door  was  proposed  with  a  heating  element  used  to  heat  the  chamber.  A  distributor  fan  circulates  the  heat  produced  by  the  heating  coil  thereby  maintaining  uniform  heat  throughout  the  chamber.  Compressed  air  is  supplied  through  the  pressure  port  to  pressurize  the  component.  The  features  of  the  pressure  vessel  include  the  pressure  relief  valve,  pressure  sensor  transducer,  and  sealed  accessible  door  with  locks.  Although  the  pressure  vessel  surpassed the need for an autoclave, the cost associated with the design and production of the pressure  vessel was still beyond the economic budget.  5.2.3 Compression Press Molding    Literature  studies  show  that  high  temperature  composites  produced  using  hot  compression  press  yielded  laminates  of  void  content  less  than  0.1%  [2].  These  laminates  were  fabricated  with  prepregs  employing a dry molding cycle for which a vacuum was not required for part consolidation. 

 
Figure 10: Heated Compression platen (wabashmpi)

Wabash heated platen is used in industries for manufacturing flat advanced composite panel of uniform  thickness.  The  compression  press  is  hydraulically  operated  with  adjustable  platen  closing  and  opening  speed.  The  platens  are  heated  with  the  electric  cartridges  and  the  PID  digital  controllers  monitor  the  temperature.  The  available  clamp  pressure  force  varies  from  15  tons  to  150  tons.  The  heated  platens  have optional watercooling system with platen size varying from 12 to 48 Sq.in.   The  equipment  costs  were  still  high  and  beyond  the  economic  budget  with  reference  to  production  of  test coupons. Hence, there was a need for the new in house technique that could produce cost effective  test specimens.   5.2.4 Concept of Self Reacting Mold; Integrated with Oven  In  present  work,  innovation  is  brought  into  reality  through  the  novel  idea  of  applying  pressure  and  maintaining  the  cure  cycle  temperature  by  integrating  two  different  systems.  A  frame  structure  with  a  selfreacting  concept  is  designed  and  is  made  of  high  strength  heattreated  steel.  The  high  temperature  laminate  is  laidup  on  the  molding  tool  with  male  and  female  molds  that  have  fine  surface  finishes.  The  mold  tool  is  pressurized  by  the  hydraulic  actuators  to  the  required  manufacturing  pressure.  The  cure  cycle temperature is programmed in the oven.

5.3 INITIAL DESIGN OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEM  The  manufacturing  of  high  temperature  composites  involved  compatibility  assessment  and  preliminary  design  phases,  which  are  discussed  briefly  in  the  following  section.  The  critical  element  in  the  manufacturing  set  up  is  integration  of  the  selfreacting  frame  (pressure  controller)  and  compact  industrial oven (temperature controller). 

The  highpressure  requirement  to  manufacture  the  IM7/RP46  composite  panel  was  catered  by  implementing  a  mechanical  system.  The  industrial  oven  space  was  wisely  exploited  to  install  the  mechanical  system.  The  equally  spaced  vent  holes  on  the  top  of  the  oven  body  were  taken  as  a  reference  point  for  building  the  oven,  centre  to  centre  distance  between  the  ventilation  holes  were  found  to  be  19",  the  same  was  taken  as  the  distance  between  the  supporting  rods  in  the  mechanical  system.  The  diameter  of  the  hole  was  0.65".  The  Inner  supporting  rods  were  designed  to  be  0.75"  with  reference  to  the  results  obtained  from  the  FEM  analysis.  The  outer  rods  had  diameter  of  1.25"  as  they  were required to have a bigger diameter to cater the design.  To  accommodate  the  self  reacting  mold  in  the  heating  oven,  precision  holes  had  been  drilled  with  the  aid  of  a  nibbler.  Grinding  tools  with  different  grits  were  used  over  the  holes  to  remove  the  burr,  to  present smooth and clean finish. Concentricity was kept in mind while drilling the oven holes whose wall  thickness was 4.5 inches.  The  oven  top  was  constructed  with  two  parallel  steel  sheets,  which  were  filled  with  insulation  in  between.  Concentric  holes  of  0.60"  were  cut  out  on  the  top  of  the  oven  for  the  exhaust  purpose  and  were  enlarged  to  1.25"  to  accommodate  the  outer  rod  of  the  frame.  Allowance  of  0.10"  was  set  for  the  frames  to  move  freely  while  applying  the  pressure.  A  concentric  hole  was  marked  on  the  surface  with  a  scribing  tool,  using  a  rod  element  whose  stem  diameter  is  0.65"  fitted  to  a  disc  of  diameter  1.25".  The 

37   

holes  were  carefully  cut  out  using  a  hand  held  nibbler.  Finally  the  sides  were  smoothed  and  grinded  to  exact dimension.    The  designed  selfreacting  frame  was  made  with  high  strength,  heat  treated  steel.  The  total  weight  of  the  frame  was  140  pounds  including  the  compression  mold.  These  frames  were  designed  to  be  accommodated  in  the  oven  tray.  As  per  the  oven  specification  each  oven  tray  was  rated  for  a  maximum  load capacity of 20 pounds.  In  order  to  support  the  structure  an  L  frame  was  designed.  The  selfreacting  frame  structures  were  expected  to  be  suspended  on  the  abovementioned  L  frame.  Four  L  frames  were  manufactured  and  fixed to the concrete wall surfaces to carry a load of 140 pounds.   5.3.1 Frame Support:  L Bracket  The  idea  of  external  support  was  proposed  as  the  cold  treated  steel  frame  was  too  heavy  to  be  accommodated  onto  the  oven  self.  In  order  to  support  the  selfreacting  frame  a  L  shaped  bracket  was  designed  in  Catia  V12  and  static  analysis  was  performed  using  a  workbench  in  Ansys,  to  decide  the  thickness  of  the  flat  steel  bar.  The  bracket  was  custom  fabricated,  as  the  length  requirements  did  not  match  with  the  similar  kind  of  brackets  available  on  the  market.  A  diagonal  bar  was  welded  between  two  ends  to  avoid  excessive  bending  of  the  cantilever  bar  support.  The  holes  were  drilled  onto  the  concrete wall using a hammer drill. Four Lbrackets were fixed to the wall to provide firm support to the  heavy frame. Precautions were taken in order to maintain the level of all four brackets.

Figure 13: Hydraulic Actuator Circuit 

The  above  diagram  represents  the  hydraulic  schema  of  the  selfreacting  molding  system.  The  above  detailed  hydraulic  actuator  fits  in  between  the  top  and  mid  plate  of  the  molding  frame.  The  hand  pump  with a Tjoint at both ends was connected to the inlet and outlet of the cylinders. Highpressure polymer  hoses with a  rating of 2030 psi and high temperature insulation  were used for all hydraulic connections.  39   

The  hydraulic  circuit  had  pressure  gage,  ball  valve,  and  quick  disconnect  fittings.  Hydraulic  cylinders  are  the main source of the pressure applied on the compression mold to produce RP46 panels.    5.4 FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF THE SELF REACTING FRAME STRUCTURE  The  main  objective  of  this  work  was  to  use  compressionmolding  technique  to  fabricate  high  temperature  composite  panel.  It  is  apparent  that  the  mould  deformation  under  curing  pressure  would  leave  an  imprint  on  the  fabricated  panels.  The  excessive  deformation  of  the  mould  would  translate  to  variation  in  thickness  of  the  fabricated  sample.  The  selfreacting  frame  for  manufacturing  the  high  temperature  composite  was  designed  to  withstand  the  compression  load  during  the  fabrication  of  the  IM7/RP46  specimen.  The  selfreacting  frame  was  made  from  steel  4140  heat  treated  to  210  ksi  of  yield  strength.  Steel was found to be economical and feasible to construct the frames system.

The  design  was  proposed  keeping  in  mind  the  ease  of  manufacturing  by  avoiding  intricate  dimensions,  very  small  components,  easy  assembling  features  and  robust  construction.  The  initial  design  was  made  using CATIA (V5 R19 Dassualt System 2010) to visualize the three dimensional and the three dimensional  model  was  converted  to  Initial  Graphics  Exchange  Specification  (IGES)  format.    The  IGS  then  was  transferred to MSC MARC Finite Element Analysis software (MSC family of Product, California, 2010) and  the solid model then was discredited. Figure 14 depicts the threedimensional model of the self reacting  frame and molding. Tri linear hexagonal 8noded elements were used in the analysis with fine meshes at  contact  surfaces  and  circular  pockets.  The  solid  model  had  140888  elements.    Thermal  effects  were  negligible and were not included in the analysis.  As  it  was  explain  earlier,  the  selfreacting  plate  consists  of  four  Plates  of  similar  dimensions  that  house  the  twopart  mold.  There  are  two  rods,  one  with  0.75  inches  (main  rod)  that  slides  through  the  second  rod  of  1.25  inches  diameter  (Hollow  hub).  The  main  rods  connect  the  two  outer  plates  and  the  hubs  connect  the  two  inner  plates,  thereby  giving  sliding  capability  to  the  inner  plates  to  move  up  and/or  down  depending  on  the  load.  This  capability  was  simulated  in  finite  element  analysis  to  obtain  realistic  results.  In  order  to  perform  FE  simulation  correctly,  various  contact  schemes  were  used  to  simulate  the  fabrication  process.  For  instance,  a  touching  contact  between  male  and  female  mold  was  defined  using  Frictional  Coulomb  contact  definition,  or  the  two  main  rods  were  connected  to  the  two  outer  plates  using  contact  glue  scheme.  On  the  other  hand,  the  fabrication  pressures  exerted  by  the  hydraulic  actuators  were  simulated  using  distributed  load  as  boundary  conditions.  Figure  15  depicts  the  various  contacts used in this analysis.

5.4(a) Static Analysis of Frame Structure  It  was  extremely  important  to  perform  the  FE  analysis  of  the  selfreacting  frame  system  to  determine  the  geometry  and  select  the  material.  The  FE  analyses  of  various  selfreacting  designs  were  performed  on  to  determine  the  deflection  of  each  frame.  Ultimately,  the  frame  with  minimum  deflection  was  chosen.  This  was  due  to  the  fact  that  composite  panel  with  a  uniform  thickness  could  not  have  been  fabricated  in  a  frame  that  experiences  high  deformation  during  fabrication  process.  The  FEM  analysis  42   

was  performed  using  MSC  Marc®  by  invoking  a  material  nonlinear  solution  (elasticplastic  analysis  utilizing  CowperSimon  strain  hardening).  The  importance  of  the  FEM  was  to  study  the  deformation  pattern  of  the  selfreacting  mold  at  high  pressure  and  temperature.  In  order  to  obtain  the  high  quality  flat  panel  it  is  required  to  keep  the  deformation  of  the  mold  to  very  small  level  as  to  avoid  interfering  with  the  flatness  of  the  composite  panel.  Figure  16  shows  the  Cauchy  stress;  clearly  the  stress  level  is  below yield limit of the material. 

 
Figure 16: Equivalent Cauchy Stress plot 

Figure  17  and  Figure  18  depicts  the  displacement  and  strain  respectively.  As  the  contour  plot  show,  the  displacement  between  male  and  female  mold  is  approximately  0.003  inches  and  strain  is  297  micron.  Clearly,  the  deformation  and  strain  during  fabrication  is  within  an  acceptable  range  and  does  not  cause  appreciable thickness variation.

5.5 MANUFACTURING PROCEDURE  IM7/RP46  composite  can  be  manufactured  using  an  autoclave  curing  or  compression  molding  process.  The  production  procedure  and  curing  cycle  varies  for  both  autoclave  curing  and  compression  molding  process each manufacturing procedure described in the following section.  5.5.1 Autoclave Curing Process  Autoclave  curing  is  believed  to  be  an  ideal  method  for  manufacturing  composites  as  it  can  control  pressure  and  temperature  simultaneously.  Processing  of  RP46  composites  requires  high  pressure  and  temperature,  which  is  applied  in  various  steps.  It  is  essentially  similar  to  compression  molding  with  trivial  change  in  application  of  pressure  and  post  cure  condition.  After  layup,  the  mold  tool  is  kept  vacuum  bagged  till  the  end  of  the  cycle,  to  avoid  entrapment  of  air  in  between  the  laminate  during  the  curing  process.  Initially  30  inch  of  vacuum  are  applied  followed  by  a  temperature  raise  to  430°F  at  the  rate of 5°F per minute. Depending upon the number of plies in the laminate, it is staged for one to three  hours at 430°F.The temperature is then raised to 475°F and staged for one hour. A pressure of 200 psi is  then applied and it is held for one hour. The temperature is further raised to 617°F at the rate of 5°F per  minute where it has to be staged for two hours. The composite part is now cooled slowly to 150°F when  both  pressure  and  vacuum  is  released.  The  Vacuumed  part  is  then  post  cured  by  slowly  raising  the  temperature  from  74°F  (23°C)  to  663°F  (350°C)  at  the  rate  of  2°C  per  minute.  The  part  is  staged  for  four  hours  at  663°F  and  cooled  slowly  (2°C  per  minute)  to  room  temperature  in  an  air  circulating  oven  in  a  free state. Thus post cured RP46/Carbon composite is expected to have a Tg range of 380°C400°C.

5.5.2 Compression Molding  In  the  compression  molding  process,  the  dry  fabric  is  impregnated  with  RP46  resin  solution  to  get  desired  fibre  and  resin  volume  fraction.  The  preimpregnated  fabric  is  then  staged  at  160  °F  for  10  to  15  minutes in the convection  oven to remove the major  portion of methanol as well as to imidize the  RP46  resin solution before layup. Staging allows volatiles to escape partially, though volatiles are expected to  evolve  during  the  curing  cycle.  It  is  advantageous  to  remove  possible  maximum  volatiles  to  alleviate  excess  voids  in  the  cured  composite  structure,  followed  by  second  staging  of  impregnated  cloth  in  the  convection oven at 400°F for one hour. The staged Prepregs are then laidup to desired fibre orientation  in  the  compression  molding  tool.  The  molding  tool  is  placed  into  the  preheated  press  at  450°F  and  held  for  15  minutes.  Compression  at  of  250  psi  is  applied  to  the  assembly,  while  holding  the  pressure  the  temperature  is  ramped  up  to  617°F  at  a  rate  of  5°F  per  minute.  The  assembly  is  put  on  hold  for  a  minimum  of  one  hour  at  250  psi  upon  attaining  617°F.  Finally,  the  assembly  is  slowly  cooled  to  350°F  a  ranging between 8°F 10°F before releasing 250 psi pressure.

5.5.3 Initial Setup Process  The  preliminary  step  in  the  manufacturing  setup  is  the  enlargement  of  vent  holes  to  accommodate  the  1.25"  rod.  As  the  oven  had  no  critical  component  except  the  thermal  insulation  material  on  the  top  surface  it  was  easy  to  cut  out  the  holes  .The  ventilation  hole  centre  to  centre  distance  was  measured  to  be  19",  which  was  taken  as  the  reference  element  for  enlarging  the  holes  to  1.25"  diameter.  The  stainless  steel  sheet  was  cut  with  the  metal  nibbler  and  the  edges  were  levelled  with  a  handgrinding  tool. 

The  second  stage  in  the  manufacturing  setup  was  to  fix  the  supporting  L  brackets.  The  purpose  of  the  brackets was to carry the integrated mechanical system with the compression mold. The initial markings  were  made  to  position  the  brackets  after  which  holes  were  drilled  using  an  industrial  drilling  machine.  Precautions  were  taken  to  fix  the  brackets  at  the  uniform  level  to  avoid  the  tilting  of  the  mechanical  system.  After assembling the mechanical system, the top plate was secured to the bracket to arrest the  movement of the frame. 

Finally,  the  hydraulic  circuit  was  assembled  after  securing  the  bracket  fixtures  and  frames  assembly  firmly.  The  compact  cylinders  were  placed  in  between  the  top  plate  and  mid  press  with  ports  facing  the  front of the assembly to facilitate visual inspection in case of any problems such as an oil leak. The room  at  the  rear  of  the  brackets  were  used  to  place  the  hand  pump  that  kept  the  system  handy  and  feasible.  After  the  setup  was  completed  the  final  inspection  was  carried  out  including  checking  the  movement  of  the  frame  rods,  checking  the  operation  of  the  cylinder,  and  verifying  the  level  of  the  four  plates  of  the  frames.

5.5.4 Industrial OvenSelf Reacting Frames Integration Procedure  The  Lframes  were  first  secured  on  the  concrete  wall  and  leveled  .The  frame  was  designed  and  fabricated  with  the  threads  along  the  entire  length  of  the  rod,  which  facilitated  the  assembly  and  the  fine  adjustment  of  the  frames  level.  The  rods  were  dropped  from  the  top  side  of  the  oven  through  the  machined  hole.  The  bottom  portion  of  the  base  frame  and  midpress  were  Then,  assembled  with  the  bolts  on  either  side  of  the  frame  followed  by  the  top  portion  of  the  assembly.   The  four  plates  of  the  frames  were  assembled  parallel  to  one  another  and  parallelisms  were  verified  using  a  magnetic  toolbox  level. The frames were then suspended on the L frame and connected with nuts and bolts to secure the  position firmly.

The hydraulic units were placed at equal distances from the centre line of the frame with the piston end  facing  up  and  the  base  supported  on  the  mid  press.  The  inlets  and  outlets  of  the  cylinder  were  connected  to  the  hand  pump  with  the  Tjoint.  The  hydraulic  unit  was  fitted  with  the  pressure  gage  to  read the pressure applied to the compression mold. The entire unit was seated on the rear side of the L  frame.  

49   

A  19"  clamp  was  fixed  at  the  middle  of  the  assembly  to  facilitate  placement  of  the  male  and  female  mold  after  the  layup  of  the  prepregs.  Clamps  assisted  in  the  easy  movement  of  the  mid  press  and  also  helped in the alignment of the mold at the centre of the frame.

5.6 COMPRESSION MOLDING WITH SELF REACTING FRAME ­ WORKING PRINCIPLE  The  resin  coated  carbon  fabric  was  placed  in  the  oven  tray  and  staged  at  160°F  and  400°F,  for  15  minutes  and  60  minutes  correspondingly.   The  staged  prepreg  was  placed  in  the  mould  in  the  designed  orientation and then placed in the oven with the aid of the Cclamps. The suspended selfreacting frame  was  assembled  with  the  compact  hydraulic  cylinders  located  equidistant  from  the  centre  of  the  frame.  The  hydraulic  fluid  was  pressurised  by  hand  cranking  the  lever  in  the  hand  pump,  which  extends  the  piston  of  the  cylinder.  The  extension  of  the  piston  pushes  the  top  and  midpress  apart  on  the  topside,  while compressing the mould between the mid press and bottom plate. The external frame experienced  tension  force  while  the  inner  mid  press  was  in  compression  phase.  Sufficient  pressure  was  applied  and  monitored  by  the  pressure  gage.  The  temperature  was  measured  by  the  J  type  thermocouple  in  the  oven.

  5.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS  Viable  manufacturing  equipments  were  compared  in  terms  of  production  cost  with  the  present  novel  technique.  The  working  principles  and  experimental  set  of  the  manufacturing  technique  were  explained in  detail in  the  current chapter. The following chapter  will discuss about the quality of the  panels produced using the inhouse manufacturing setup and test carried to verify the quality of the  manufactured specimen.      51   

CHAPTER 6      
6.0 QUALITY OF IM7/RP46 PANELS 
Initial phase of manufacturing revealed various intricacies involved in the manufacturing procedure. The  chemistry  of  the  resin  and  workability  of  the  fabric  was  understood  in  order  to  produce  a  fair  quality  composite  panel.  The  resin  was  found  to  be  easily  workable  at  room  temperature.  It  was  evident  from  the  static  testing  that  hand  layup  involves  various  parameters  that  affect  the  quality  of  the  panel.  The  proficiency  of  the  manufacturer  is  of  prime  importance.  The  quality  of  the  specimen  was  found  to  be  sensitive depending on the skill level of the layup personnel.  

In  the  current  section,  the  initial  manufacturing  procedures  and  improvised  manufacturing  procedure  that resulted in good quality panels will be discussed in detail.  6.1 NOVICE MANUFACTURING PROCEDURE  The  Carbon  fabric  roll  was  cut  into  3  x  11  Sq.in  layers  with  the  templates  that  were  made  out  of  hard  cardboard.  A  Stanley  knife  was  used  to  cut  the  fabric.  A  selfresilient  cutting  mat  made  of  urethane  was  placed  at  the  bottom  of  the  fabric  roll  to  make  a  clear  cut  of  the  layers.  The  cut  fabric  was  drawn  out  from the fabric roll by finishing the template with the carbon shears. 

The  RP46  resin  was  taken  out  of  the  freezer  at 18°C  (0.4°F)  and  allowed  to  reach  room  temperature.  Practically,  it  was  found  that  the  RP46  resin  reaches  room  temperature  in  approximately  30  minutes.  Cooling  the  resin  to  room  temperature  is  important  because  the  viscosity  at  room  temperature  is  perfectly apt for the layup, whereas below room temperature the RP46 resin remains highly viscous. The  remaining  resin  was  purged  with  the  nitrogen  gas  to  provide  inert  gas  blanket  in  order  to  prevent  entrapment of moisture into the resin container.

Figure 25: Aluminum Caul Plate 

The  flat  aluminum  caul  plate  (12  x  12  Sq.in)  was  coated  with  release  agent  before  placing  the  fabric  for  wetting  with  RP  46  resin.  After  the  coating  was  dried,  a  layer  of  carbon  fabric  was  placed  on  the  plate  and  RP46  was  applied  using  the  hard  bristles  hand  brush.  Precautions  were  taken  to  make  sure  a  uniform  coating  of  resin  was  applied  to  the  fabric  layer.  It  was  noted  that  after  30  minutes  the  resin  in  the caul plate started sticking to the carbon fabric and removing the resin impregnated fabric was found  to be difficult. The wetted fabric was then transformed onto the oven tray for staging.

    6.2 CURING PROCEDURE  The  resin  impregnated  carbon  fibre  was  placed  on  the  oven  tray  and  staged  inside  the  oven.  The  prepreg was staged at 160°F for 15 minutes to remove 10% of the volatile contents. 
Figure 27: Staging Tray

The  prepreg  was  taken  out  of  the  oven  and  the  oven  was  now  set  to  ramp  up  to  400°F  for  the  second  staging.   Once  the  required  temperature  of  400°F  was  reached  the  prepreg  was  tossed  inside  the  oven  and staged for 1 hour. At this stage the pliable prepreg partially cured and was observed to be a stiff ply. 

 
Figure 28: Partially cured prepreg at 400°F 

54   

The  partially  cured  prepreg  was  cut  into  2.9  x  11  sq.in  and  stacked  up  on  the  female  mold.  The  male  mold  was  placed  on  top  of  the  female  mold  aligning  the  edges.  Simultaneously,  the  oven  temperature  was  ramped  up  to  450°F.  The  male  and  female  molds  were  then  placed  between  the  bottom  and  lower  mid  press.  The  mid  press  was  lifted  up  using  the  Cclamp  set  up,  which  created  enough  room  to  place  the  compression  mold.  The  mold  was  placed  at  the  centre  of  the  frame  to  ensure  the  uniform  distribution  of  pressure.  During  the  initial  stage  of  manufacturing  considerable  amount  of  time  was  spent  for  aligning  the  mold  at  the  centre.  Lately,  lines  were  marked  for  ensuring  the  alignment  of  the  mold with the frame, which reduced the setup time. 

 
Figure 29: Prepregs on female compression mold 

After  placing  the  mold,  the  temperature  was  ramped  up  again,  to  450°F,  leading  to  approximately  45  minutes  of  wait  time.  Once  the  target  temperature  was  reached  the  third  hold  started  at  450°F  for  15  minutes.  The  oven  had  the  feature  of  setting  up  the  profile  to  ramp  up  at  a  particular  rate,  hold  at  a  certain  temperature,  and  ramp  again  continually,  which  facilitated  partial  automation  of  the  curing  process. 

55   

The  temperature  started  ramping  up  at  the  rate  of  5°F  per  minute  upon  completing  the  hold  at  450°F.  Simultaneously  the  pressure  was  applied  to  the  compression  mold  by  hand  cranking  the  hydraulic  system  while  monitoring  the  magnitude  of  pressure  on  the  gage.  When  the  pressure  reached  1400psi,  the  supply  valve  was  closed  to  hold  the  applied  pressure.  The  ramp  up  rate  and  the  pressure  was  monitored periodically. As the temperature profile was automated, the temperature ramped to 617°F at  the  rate  of  5°F  per  minute  and  was  held  there  for  1  hour.  The  oven  power  control  goes  off  once  the  profile  is  completed.  The  temperature  is  allowed  to  cool  down  at  a  rate  of  between  810°F  until  it  reached  350°F.  At  350°F  the  supply  valve  of  the  hydraulic  system  was  opened  and  the  pressure  valve  was  released  thus  the  applied  pressure  fell  to  zero.   The  mold  was  allowed  to  cool  down  slowly  to  the  room  temperature.  The  cured  IM7/RP46  panel  was  removed  from  the  mold  and  the  edges  were  trimmed, to cut out the two specimens size 1x10 sq.in.   6.3 OBSERVATION OF THE INITIAL IM7/RP46 COMPOSITE PANEL  6.3.1 Warping of Panel  First panel was manufacture with odd number of layers, which resulted in pre strained panel. The panel  appeared to be warped and twisted.

Figure 31: Flat view of the Warped Sample 

Interesting  observations  were  made  with  the  partially  cured  prepreg  that  were  staged  at  400°F  for  one  hour.  These  prepregs  were  stored  at  room  temperature  approximately  for  a  day  and  stacked  on  the  compression  mold  to  continue  the  rest  of  the  curing  cycle.  The  cure  cycle  was  completed  and  the  cured  panel appeared to be straight with noticeable observations.   The  panel  was  unusually  thicker  than  that  of  the  regular  panels.  It  had  yellow  powder  dispersed  to  the  surface  intermittently  and  had  dull  appearance  throughout  the  panel.  It  also  had  dark  spots  around  the  centre region of the panel, which revealed the moisture entrapment in the panel.

6.3.2 Misalignment of the Compression Mold:  The  male and female  molds were designed with allowable tolerance so as to  match perfectly. When  the  mold  is  loaded  with  stiff  prepregs  the  male  mold  sits  on  top  of  the  female  mold  in  a  way  that  even  a  slight  movement  of  the  male  mold  could  cause  misalignment  of  the  mold  set  up.  One  such  case  was  observed  during  the  initial  phase  of  the  production.  After  placing  the  mold  inside  the  frame  set  up,  failure  to  verify  the  alignment  resulted  in  the  unevenly  pressed  specimen.  This  case  called  for  verifying  the level and alignment of the male and female mold after placing it in frame set up.

Figure 34: Front view of the mold misaligned panel 

6.3.3 Combined Staging and Curing Cycle  It was noticed that the alignment of the mold was necessary after stacking up the prepregs. An alternate  approach  was  adopted  to  manufacture  the  specimen  without  taking  it  out  of  the  oven  after  the  second  58   

staging  at  400°F.  The  prepregs  were  pliable  and  soft  at  the  end  of  the  first  staging  at  160°F.  These  prepregs  were  stacked  inside  the  female  mold  and  male  mold  was  placed  on   top  without  applying  any  pressure.  It  was  observed  that  the  weight  of  the  male  mold  exerted  some  pressure  on  the  prepregs  while staging at 400°F. This led to accumulation of moisture in the panel, as the male mold pressure was  high enough to prevent the venting of volatile and moisture escape from the resin. 

Finally, resulting in moisture trapped dark spots on the resin similar to the one observed in the second  panel. 

Moisture entrapped       Spots

6.3.4 Resin Poor Areas in the IM7/RP46 Panel  Flex  sealer  GP  was  initially  applied  on  the  surface  of  the  compression  mold.  After  sealer  GP  was  dried,  the  coating  of  Flex  mold  release  6.0  was  applied.  Though  release  coat  was  applied  to  the  mold,  the  excess  resin  that  squeezed  during  the  compression  process,  cured  along  the  edges  of  the  mold,  which

later  created  an  issue  while  removing  the  panel.  Thus,  removal  of  panel  was  intricate  at  the  end  of  the  manufacturing cycle.  In  order  to  avoid  the  problem  of  removing  the  panel,  the  edges  of  the  fabric  were  not  wetted  with  the  resin.  Assuming  that  on  application  of  pressure,  the  excess  resin  at  the  centre  of  the  panel  would  flow  towards  the  edges  and  help  in  wetting  the  edge  portion  of  the  specimen.  But,  the  flow  of  resin  was  not  sufficient enough to wet the entire panel, leaving resin poor areas around the edges of the cured panel.

6.4 GOOD QUALITY SPECIMEN; ESTABLISHED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUE  The  manufacturing  setup  was  completely  understood  after  production  of  four  panels.  The  production  became familiarised after key observations from the earlier trails were understood to avoid repeating in  upcoming  samples.    Few  new  handling  techniques  were  adapted  and  cure  cycles  were  completed  without any interruption during the alignment of the mold.

  Figure 37: Caul Plate enfolded with peel Ply 

The  caul  plate  was  insulated  with  the  peel  ply,  which  assisted  in  the  easy  removal  of  the  fabric  after  wetting  with  resin  solution.  The  staging  tray  was  covered  with  the  Vacuum  bagging  film,  which  prevented the sticking of the prepreg on the tray.   The mold and frame structure were marked with permanent white marker to make the alignment easy.  The prepregs were sheared after the first staging at 160°F unlike after the second staging at 400°F in the  earlier procedure which facilitated trimming operations.  The  pressure  was  constantly  monitored  as  a  pressure  drop  was  noticed  around  550°F  .To  compensate  the  pressure  drop due to the polymerization of the resin additional pressure has to be supplied by hand  cranking the pump.  In  order  to  avoid  the  resin  poor  areas,  carbon  fabric  was  cut  to  2.90  x  11  Sq.in  leaving  some  room  along  the  corner  of  the  compression  mould.  This  helped  in  easy  removal  of  the  panel  and  also  avoided  resin  poor areas along the edges. Use of peel ply could also help in getting the 3 x 11 inch specimen with ease  and not needing to use release coat in terms of removal of the panel.

The  IM7/RP46  specimen  obtained  lately  was  proved  to  have  more  strength  than  the  initial  panels.  It  is  evident  that  the  quality  of  the  panel  greatly  varies  depending  on  the  skill  level  of  the  manufacturer.  Cleanliness  of  the  manufacturing  atmosphere,  following  standard  procedures,  constant  ramping  rate  of  the  oven  and  familiarization  of  resin  cure  cycle  are  the  important  parameters  that  help  improve  the  quality of the panel consistently.

6.5 FIBRE AND RESIN VOLUME CALCULATION BY WEIGHT  The Volume fraction of the constituents in composite panel is calculated by measuring their individual  weight. The weight of the dry carbon fabric of dimension 3 X 11 Sq.in was measured to be 4 grams. After  the application of the resin the prepreg weighed 6 grams. The total weight of the panel was found to be  60 grams. The IM7/RP 46 panels have a total of ten layers carbon fabric.

6.6 SPECIMEN TESTING  In  the  case  of  orthotropic  symmetric  laminates,  tensile  test  on  the  specimen  of  thickness  "t"  under  uniform axial force per unit length can give effective axial modulus and poisson ratio. Tensile testing also  helps  to  determine  the  stressstrain  behaviour  of  the  material  as  either  elastic  or  nonelastic.  The  ultimate  stress  of  the  material  was  calculated  from  the  maximum  force  applied  per  unit  length  and  thickness  of  the  sample.  The  manufactured  specimens  were  tested  in  accordance  with  ASTM  D  3039/D  3039M, which is described in the following sections.   6.6.1 Ultimate Static Testing  The  manufactured  IM7/RP46  panels  were  perfectly  flat  and  had  a  thickness  of  0.08".  The  edges  of  the  panels  were  trimmed  off  to  get  two  specimens  of  size  1x10  Sq.in.  The  MTS  322  test  frame  was  used  to  carry  out  the  tensile  testing  of  the  specimen.  The  main  focus  of  the  tensile  testing  was  to  find  the  maximum  axial  load  and  ultimate  failure  stress  of  the  manufactured  IM7/RP46  sample.  It  was  assumed  consistent  manufacturing  procedures  would  produce  specimens  that  have  close  range  of  tensile  strengths. 

Extensometers  were  clamped  at  the  mid  section  of  the  specimen  for  strain  measurements.  Two  springs  provided  the  clamping  force  on  either  edge  of  specimen  of  1"  width.  They  provide  a  measurement  of  the average strain over the finite length.  The  MTS  322  test  frame  had  wedge  shaped  hydraulic  grips  with  a  maximum  pressure  of  69  MPa.  The  emery  cloth  was  initially  used  to  grip  the  specimen.  As  the  emery  cloth  caused  slipping  of  the  test  specimen,  aluminum  tabs  with  10°  taper  were  used  for  gripping  the  specimen.  The  bonding  ends  of  composite  specimens  were  sanded  with  a  320  grit  sand  paper  and  degreased  before  bonding.  Similarly,  aluminum tabs were also sanded with 320 grit sand paper and degreased to avoid entrapment of foreign  particles for effective bonding. The ideal gripping pressure was found to be 2750 psi. 

64   

The tension load was applied to the specimen at the rate of 2 mm per minute. The specimen was loaded  until  failure  to  determine  the  ultimate  failure  load  in  order  to  determine  the  ultimate  stress  of  the  fabricated specimen.    0.08" 10°           2"

6.6.2 Stress ­ Strain Curve of the Specimen  The  IM7/RP46  produced  by  selfreacting  compression  molding  procedure  showed  linear  elastic  behavior.  Stress  values  were  calculated  with  the  maximum  applied  load  by  cross  section  area.  Strain  values were obtained with the extensometer clamped at the gauge length of the specimen. The slope of  the  curve  was  plotted  to  determine  the  Young's  modulus  of  the  specimen.  The  average  slope  of  the  tested  specimen  was  found  to  be  81.4354  GPa.  The  stress  values  in  pounds  per  square  inch  are  plotted  against the percentage strain values as shown below.

6.7 IM7/RP 46 STATIC FAILURE PATTERN ­ OBSERVATION  As  we  know  at  microlevel  fibrous  composite  exhibit  various  failure  mechanism  which  include  fibre  fracture,  fibre  splitting,  fibre  pull  out,  matrix  cracking  and  fibre/matrix  debonding.  Interesting  failure  patterns were observed among the IM7/RP46 composites manufactured in the laboratory. Among them  was  a  failure  pattern  of  the  panel  manufactured  from  the  prepreg  that  was  stored  in  the  room  temperature for a day, followed by compression molding the next day. The appearance of the panel was  described  before  in  the  novice  panel  section.  On  loading  the  specimen  beyond  8000  pounds  force  the  matrix  powder  started  falling  off  the  sample,  followed  by  rapid  delamination.  The  fibre  rupture  was  observed at the edges of the sample.

Figure 44: Top view of matrix failure specimen 

Transverse  fibre  fracture  was  observed  in  common  among  the  manufactured  specimen  as  fibres  are  the  major  loadcarrying  members.  Fibre  fracture  occurred  in  the  IM7/RP46  specimen  as  the  tensile  load  of  the  fibre  was  exceeded  beyond  the  maximum  axial  tensile  stress.  The  sample  had  transverse  cut  and  failing at two or three regions simultaneously or in fractions of time difference.

Figure 48: Edge pull out followed by delamination 

The failure surface in all the case was perpendicular to the loading direction. Edges pull out and  delamination was not dominantly found among the coupons but was noticed in a couple of specimens.   6.8 HIGH TEMPERATURE TESTING OF IM7/RP46 COUPONS  The  produced  IM7/RP46  specimens  were  tested  at  elevated  temperature  in  the  simulated  environmental  chamber.   Ultimate  static  testing  and  fatigue  testing  was  carried  out  in  order  to  qualify  the  manufacturing  procedure  with  reference  to  high  temperature  application.  Initial  static  testing  was  performed  to  generalize  the  uniformity  of  the  samples  produced  from  inhouse  manufacturing  set  up.  The real application of the  material relies on the result of the high  temperature  testing as the polyimide  resin  system  was  used  in  verifying  practicality  of  the  manufacturing  apparatus.  The  established  cost  effective method focuses on producing the advanced composites.  6.8.1 Elevated Temperature Experimental Setup  The  high  temperature  polymer  composite  was  tested  using  an  inhouse  designed  and  manufactured  solid  steel  mechanical  grip.  The  mechanical  grips  had  six  bolts  on  each  segment  that  enabled  setting  up  the gripping pressure of the test material. MTS 647 hydraulic wedge grips were replaced with the above  mentioned mechanical grips to overcome the temperature limitation. 

A  high  temperature  environmental  chamber  with  a  maximum  temperature  of  800°F  was  mounted  on  the  MTS  test  frame.  The  heating  chamber  has  a  temperature  control  system  to  maintain  the  72   

temperature accuracy within ±1°C of the required temperature. A Vortec's cold air gun was used to cool  the  top  and  bottom  load  cell  with  the  compressed  air.  High  temperature  extensometer  with  a  gage  length  of  1"  inch  was  employed  to  measure  the  strain  in  the  specimen  under  testing.  The  above  mentioned  high  temperature  apparatus  setup  [12]  at  FRAMES  lab  was  used  to  carry  out  both  static  and  fatigue testing on the IM7/RP46 composite coupons.

6.8.2 High Temperature Static Testing of IM7/RP46  The  test  specimen  dimensions  were  strictly  the  same  as  followed  for  the  room  temperature  ultimate  static  testing  of  IM7/RP46  composites.  The  end  tabs  were  bonded  to  the  specimen  with  the  polyimide  tape  on  the  edges  [18].   70  footpound  Torque  force  was  used  to  grip  the  specimen  for  ultimate  static  testing.  The  torque  force  applied  to  the  mechanical  grip  was  sufficient  to  hold  the  specimen  in  position.  The  torque  wrench  was  used  to  apply  the  required  specimen  gripping  pressure.  The  test  specimen  fits  inbetween  the  one  inch  groove  of  the  mechanical  grip  and  the  friction  force  aids  to  hold  the  specimen  in place while testing.

Figure 50: Static testing of IM7/RP46 using mechanical grips 

The  IM7/RP46  specimens  were  initially  aligned  with  the  grips  followed  by  application  of  torque  force.  The  target  temperature  was  set  up  in  the  ATS  temperature  control  system  with  a  ramp  up  rate  of  6°C 

74   

per  minute.  Once  the  target  temperature  of  225°C  was  reached,  the  system  was  held  for  40  minutes  to  attain  the  uniform  temperature  throughout  the  chamber  and  the  test  specimen.  The  specimen  was  subjected  to  tension,  for  example:  pulled  at  a  rate  of  2.00  mm/minute  until  failure  occurs.  The  failed  specimen was prepared for microscopic evaluation.  6.8.3 High Temperature Fatigue Testing  The  high  temperature  fatigue  testing  of  IM7/RP46  specimen  was  performed  at  225°C  to  predict  the  design  life  of  manufactured  specimen.  The  fatigue  testing  could  predict  inservice  life  of  the  manufactured  specimen.  Coupons  with  heavy  void  content,  improper  bonding  between  layers  and  inclusions will eventually lead to failure at lower load cycles.  The  specimen was loaded up to 60% of the  ultimate  failure  load.  The  stress  ratio  used  in  the  fatigue  testing  is  0.1.  The  specimen  was  cycled  between  maximum  of  6000  lbs  and  minimum  600lbs  at  a  frequency  of  5  Hz.  The  manufactured  IM7/RP46  successfully  survived  up  to  250,000  cycles  and  the  fatigueloaded  specimen  was  subjected  to  microscopic evaluation.

  Microscopic evaluation of the fatigue tested specimen showed no significant damage or cracks along the  cross section, which can be clearly seen in the above picture.  6.8.4 Failure Pattern and StressStrain Plot of IM7/RP46 at Elevated Temperature  The  stress  strain  plot  and  failure  pattern  of  IM7/RP46  at  225°C  was  similar  to  the  results  obtained  at  room  temperature.  The  Young's  modulus  of  the  specimen  obtained  from  the  slope  of  the  stressstrain  curve was found to be 68.9 GPa.

Chapter 7  
7.0 MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF IM7/RP46 SPECIMEN 
Image  analysis  is  a  branch  of  metallography,  which  is  the  study  of  material  microstructure.  Analysis  of  the  material's  microstructure  aids  us  to  determine  whether  the  material  had  been  processed  correctly,  reliability of the material, and reason for the material failure. 

The  first  step  in  the  image  analysis  is  sectioning  followed  by  the  cutting  operation.  Sectioning  has  to  be  done  at  the  areas  of  interest  or  at  regions  that  need  to  be  investigated.  Proper  sectioning  is  required  to  minimize  the  damage,  which  might  produce  changes  in  microstructure  that  might  lead  to  erroneous  characterization.    Correctness  in  selection  of  the  cutting  method  is  important  in  order  to  cut  the  material  without  damaging  the  microstructure.  The  parameters  to  be  considered  for  efficient  cutting  operation include selection of abrasive type, bonding, cutting speed, load and coolant.  The  sections  close  to  the  failed  locations  were  selected  to  study  the  effect  of  loading  on  the  matrix,  matrixfibre  interface,  and  the  fibre.  The  virgin  specimens  were  also  sectioned  and  cut  out  to  check  for  manufacturing voids or any impurities that might have been trapped during the layup process.  The sectioned specimens were marked with the permanent marker before cutting. The IM7/RP46 panels  were  cut  with  the  diamond  coated  rotary  blades  that  ran  at  approximately  3000  rpm.  The  blade  is  cooled by water in order to avoid any damage to the composite and to produce a smooth finish.  7.1 SPECIMEN PREPARATION  The  cut  specimens  were  grinded  through  various  coarse  and  fine  silicon  carbide  grit  sheets  before  the  final  inspection.  The  initial  step  requires  rough  polishing  which  removes  the  damage  produced  during  cutting  and  planar  grinding. Proper  rough  polishing  will  maintain  specimen  flatness  and  retain  all  inclusions or secondary phases. By eliminating the previous damage and maintaining the microstructural  79   

integrity  of  the  specimen  at  this  step,  a  minimal  amount  of  time  should  be  required  to  remove  the  cosmetic damage at the final polishing step. 

 The  specimen  was  grinded  with  the  220  grit  silicon  carbide  sheet  with  enough  water,  to  avoid  damage  to  the  fibre  and  matrix  in  the  sample.  At  this  stage  it  was  required  to  maintain  the  flatness  of  the  specimen  and  to  rub  on  the  carbide  sheet  with  gentle  pressure  for  90  seconds.  After  rubbing,  cotton  gauze  was  used  to  wipe  off  water  from  the  surface  of  the  specimen.  Finally,  the  surface  was  cleaned  with  a  jet  of  compressed  air  and  a  drop  of  alcohol,  which  was  wiped  off  with  the  cotton  ball.  The  specimen  was  allowed  to  dry  and  the  next  polishing  was  done  with  the  320  grit  silicon  carbide  sheet  which is finer than the 220 grit.   The  polishing  process  started  with  the  coarse  220  grit  abrasive  paper,  followed  by  320,  600  and  1200  fine  grit  abrasive  paper.  The  final  step  in  specimen  preparation  was  rubbing  the  sample  with  the  microcloth  on  a  mixture  of  microid  diamond  compound  and  diamond  extender  for  about  two  minutes.  The  specimen  was  mounted  on  the  microscope  with  the  mounting  clips,  focused  with  the  eyepiece  and  adjusted to have a clear image. The finely adjusted image is captured with a digital microscope imager.

7.2 MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF IM7/RP46  After  the  polishing  was  completed  the  specimen  was  mounted  on  the  inspection  bed  for  analysis  and  the  distance  of  the  eyepiece  was  tuned  to  get  a  clear  picture.   The  cross  section  of  the  tested  and  virgin  specimen was inspected.

7.3 SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE  The  SEM  was  performed  on  IM7/RP46  composites  using  JEOL  JSM6380,  which  is  a  highperformance  scanning  electron  microscope  with  a  resolution  of  3.0nm.  An  operating  voltage  of  20kv  was  used  for  imaging.  The  specimens  were  mounted  on  the  epoxy  puck  of  1"  diameter  and  spur  coated  with  the  bronze  foil  along  the  composite  edge.  The  polishing  procedures  were  same  as  outlined  for  microscopic  inspection. 

SEM  imaging  of  the  initially  manufactured  specimen  had  more  void  contents,  which  were  clearly  captured at various high magnification levels.

Figure 59: Void content of Novice specimen 

Understanding of the cure cycle, established manufacturing setup along with the improved skill level of  the fabricator the amount of void content was greatly reduced. Very few isolated voids were observed 

83   

in the lately manufactured specimen. Thus, SEM imaging revealed the true quality of the specimen and  room for improving the quality of IM7/RP46 panels.

SEM  investigation  of  the  manufactured  IM7/RP46  specimen  revealed  few  isolated  void  contents  along  the  cross  section  which  could  have  occurred  due  to  air  entrapment  during  the  compression  cycle  because  of  the  air  blown  inside  the  convection  oven.  It  may  have  occurred  due  to  the  bubbles  that  might have formed during the staging process, the staging process removes the moisture trapped in  the  fibre  and  brings  to  the  top  surface  consecutive  layup  results  in  entrapment  of  these  bubbles  between  the fabric layers. These voids could be possible reduced by using vacuum bagging during the initial stage  of the compression, which could remove any voids when the resin solidifies to bond the fabric layers.  SEM  did  not  reveal  any  surface  pinholes,  blisters,  or  fibre  buckling  of  foreign  particles  (inserts)  in  the  composite panel.

7.4 SEM EVALUATION OF FAILED IM7/RP46 SPECIMEN  The tested IM7/RP46 specimen was cut near the failed area to view the local influence of failure in the  fibrematrix interface. The above described specimen preparation procedure was followed to view the  sample in the scanning electron microscope.

7.6 CONCLUDING REMARKS 

  Specimen  preparation  for  microscopic  evaluation  was  described  in  the  previous  chapter.  The 
images  captured  through  the  microscope  and  scanning  electron  microscopes  were  presented.  The  following  chapters  discuss  obtained  test  results  and  scope  for  improving  the  inhouse  manufacturing setup.

8.1 CONCLUSION  The  set  objective  was  accomplished  by  implementing  the  design  of  the  selfreacting  frame  system  for  fabricating  advanced  high  Tg  composite  panels.  Initial  design  processes  were  verified  by  producing  consistent  quality  flat  panels  of  uniform  thickness.  As  discussed  earlier,  two  IM7/RP46  test  coupons  were  obtained  at  the  end  of  each  manufacturing  cycle  which  was  trimmed  and  end  tabbed  for  further  material  testing.  Uniaxial  static  tensile  testing  was  conducted  on  the  coupons  and  ultimate  stresses  of  the  samples  were  calculated.  A  statistical  approach  was  taken  to  find  the  mean  value  of  the  test  results  of the specimen.  Four  values  out  of  nine  values  were  found  to  be  under  the  bell  curve  area.  The  statistical  approach  revealed  the  need  for  more  static  testing  in  order  to  build  a  range  of  test  figures.  Considering  the  economic  approach,  it  was  decided  to  carry  out  high  temperature  ultimate  static  testing  to  give  more  valuable  results  concerned  with  the  behavior  of  the  IM7/RP46  panel  as  later  manufactured  specimen  yielded  consistent  stress  values.  The  consistent  stress  values  revealed  that  the  fabricator  was  able  to  produce panels of same strength and standard quality panels with the established manufacturing set up.  8.2 FUTURE SCOPE  The  established  manufacturing  procedure  could  be  used  for  compression  molding  of  advanced  and  room  temperature  flat  composite  panels.  The  manufacture  specimen  can  be  cut  into  coupons  for  structural  testing  purposes.  High  temperature  composites  manufacturing  processes  could  be  semi  automated  by  application  of  sensors  for  monitoring  temperature  and  cure  cycle.    Part  temperature  could  be  closely  monitored  by  implementing  a  thermocouple  under  the  compression  molding  tool.  Provisions  can  be  made  in  the  frame  structure  to  self  align  the  compression  molds.  Cost  effective  manufacturing setup can be successfully used for producing high Tg composite panels on a long run.   91
