A downlink scheduling scheme, called coordinated location dependent downlink scheduling scheme (CLDSS), that combines the intra-cell power allocation and inter-cell transmission coordination is proposed to be used in TD-CDMA networks. In the proposed scheme, each cell in the cellular network is partitioned into co-centric areas based on the load distribution in the cell. The transmissions from base stations are controlled based on the intra-cell load as well as coordinated to minimize inter-cell interference. The average throughput employing the CLDSS is analyzed for a 2-(square) cell system in shadow fading environment with 2 (square) partitioned areas for each cell. Simulation study is also done to validate the numerical results obtained from the analytical study. It is shown th at CLDSS scheme can provide soft throughput, i.e., the average throughput remains relatively invariant with the number of users and also provide good performance even in the non-uniform user distribution within a cell. The CLDSS scheme can also improve the fairness in term s of achievable throughput to users anywhere in the cell.

C hapter 1 Introduction

I

N recent years, high data rate (HDR) wireless data service has become increasingly popular as an effective downlink transmission technique. Especially, with the de

velopment of the Internet and rapid growth and nearly universal coverage of wireless communication, the requirement to increase the transmission rate of wireless data service continues to rise. Internet services almost exist every where. People can get the news, documents, music, movie, game and other kinds of information via Internet anytime. Internet also works as a very efficient tool for the individuals in business and the professionals. Currently, the wireline communication system can provide high speed Internet service which can normally meet the requirement of users, such as digital subscriber line and cable can provide the Internet service with data rates above 2 Mbps. Meanwhile, the subscribers of a wireless communication system also want to access the Internet with high data rate. When users absent from their office (in transit or professional meetings), it is essential for them to retrieve e-mail or report, order airline tickets, browse web and so on through the Internet. Generally, they demand the same data service available in their home base. Hence, how to improve the data rate of wireless communication system is a key topic. For the purpose of understanding the concepts and the developing trends of wireless communication, we recall a brief history of the evolution of wireless communication. The cellular concept was first developed in 1970s. Since 1990, the cellular communication

in d u stry has grow n explosively. In a cellular system (see Fig. 1.1), th ere are m any low power tra n sm itte rs each of them covers a sm all p o rtio n of th e service area - which is called " cell" . E ach base sta tio n in a cell is assigned a p o rtio n of th e to ta l channels allocated to th e entire system . T h e neighbor base statio n s can be allocated different groups of channels in order to reduce th e co-channel interference betw een th e base statio n s and th e mobile users. W h en two cells are separated from each o th er and th e distance is large enough to keep th e interference levels w ithin tolerable lim its, th e base sta tio n in th e two cells can be allo cated th e sam e group of channels, th is concept is called "frequency reuse" . By m eans of frequency reuse, we can improve the capacity of th e cellular system . In Fig. 1.1, A, B, C, D, E, F, G represent the groups of channels allocated to th e cells respectively. If tw o cells have th e sam e letter, it m eans th a t th e two cells are allocated th e sam e group of channels, w hich are com m only called " co-channel" cells .

F igure 1.1: A Cellular System. To su p p o rt m ultiple access, th ere are several techniques in use for wireless com m u nications. Frequency Division M ultiple Access (FD M A), Tim e Division M ultiple Access (T D M A ) an d C ode Division M ultiple Access (CDM A) are th e m ajo r and popular schemes
[!]·

3 · FDMA is the division of the frequency band allocated for wireless cellular commu

nication into many channels, each of which can carry a voice conversation or, with digital service, carry digital data. FDMA is a basic technology in the analog Ad vanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), the most widely installed cellular telephone system in North America. W ith FDMA, each channel can be assigned to only one user at a time in a cell. · TDMA is digital transmission technology that allows a number of users to access a single radio-frequency (RF) channel without interference by the allocation of unique time slots to each user within each channel. The current TDMA standard for

cellular divides a single channel into six time slots, with each signal (or user) using two slots, providing up to 3-fold capacity gain over advanced mobile-phone service (AMPS). TDMA system uses a buffer-a.nd-burst method to transmit data to the mobile users, as a result, the transmission is non-continuous. The TDMA frame structure is shown as Fig. 1.2, where a frame is comprised of N time slots. The frame is cyclically repeated over time. The users in TDMA system interlace the transmission with each other. · CDMA is a digital cellular technology that uses spread-spectrum techniques. Unlike competing systems, such as ''Global System for Mobile Communication" (GSM), that use TDMA, CDMA does not assign a specific frequency to each user. Instead, every channel uses the full available spectrum. Individual conversations are encoded with a pseudo-random digital sequence. Each channel in CDMA system is assigned a unique pseudo-noise (PN) code which is (approximately) orthogonal to PN codes used by other users as shown in Fig. 1.3. Today, some worldwide standards have been developed. If we focus on the current cellular networks which are commonly called second generation or 2G technologies, we can note that the most popular standards include three TDMA standards and one CDMA standard: (1) Global System Mobile (GSM), (2) Interim Standard 136 (IS-136), (3) Pacific

Because of the advantages of CDMA which will be discussed in detail in the next chapter, CDMA is widely deployed by carriers in North America. W ith the widespread use of Internet, the 20 standards are modified or retrofit for compatibility; as a result, the 2.50 (IS-95B) and 30 (CDMA2000) standards are proposed as shown in Fig. 1.4.

Figure 1.4: Various Upgrade Paths for 2G Technologies [1]. 3 0 systems promise several advantages, such as, multi-magabit Internet access, com munication using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), increased network capacity [2]. In the 3 0 wireless communication system, the characteristics of high speed data communica tion are fundamentally different from voice communication, including traffic asymmetry and tolerance to latency. For high speed data communication, such as downloading from the Internet, the throughput demanded by downlink (transmission from base station to mobile users) is likely to be several times greater than the uplink (transmission from mo bile users to base station). In the meantime, two-way conversational speech requires strict adherence to symmetry. On the other hand, interference suppression is very critical to increase the throughput

of th e system based on CDM A technology. B ased on these new features of 3G system s, we propose a scheduling scheme - Co ordinated Location-based D ownlink Scheduling Schem e (C L D SS) P artitioned Cells. T he m o tiv atio n of th is proposed scheme is to im prove the dow nlink th ro u g h p u t of th e system by reducing th e interference coming from neighbor cells. In general, w hen a user is located near th e b o rd er of a cell, th e user is far away from th e home base station, therefore the base sta tio n has to tra n sm it signal w ith high power. B ut in a CDM A system , this power also produces co-channel interference to th e neighbor cell's users; especially, th is affects th e users located near th is border. T he proposed scheme coordinates th e transm ission of different cells based on th e location of th e m obile users. We p a rtitio n a cell into flexible co-centric areas an d allocate tim e slots to th e m obile users based on the d istrib u tio n of th e users in th e two areas. We assign different levels of radio signal power to th e users b ased on th eir location. If th e distance betw een th e user and base sta tio n is short, the base sta tio n tra n sm its d a ta signal w ith low power; otherw ise, th e radio signal power is high. In th e m eantim e, th e cells coordinate th eir transm issions w ith each other. T h e c o n trib u tio n of th e thesis is th a t: in th is research work, 1. We propose a downlink scheduling scheme, called coordinated location dependent dow nlink scheduling scheme (CLDSS), th a t com bined th e intra-cell power alloca tio n and inter-cell transm ission coordination proposed to be used in TD -C D M A netw orks. 2. We analyze th e average th ro u g h p u t em ploying the CLDSS for a 2-cell system in shadow fading environm ent w ith 2 p a rtitio n e d areas for each cell. 3. We perform a sim ulation stu d y to validate th e num erical results o btained from the an aly tical study. 4. We show th a t th e proposed schem e can (a) provide soft th ro u g h p u t, (b) perform b e tte r even w ith th e non-uniform d istrib u tio n of users, (c) im prove th e fairness in term s of achievable th ro u g h p u t to users anyw here in th e cell.

7 5. We compute the appropriate size of the partitioned areas by analysis and also con

firmed by the simulation - useful in the design of the network. The thesis is organized in the following way. Next chapter introduces the characteristic of a TD-CDMA system. Chapter 3 discusses previous scheduling schemes in HDR-like system. We propose a new scheduling scheme (CLDSS) for downlink of a CDMA system in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 analyzes the performance of the CLDSS scheme. In chapter 6, we provide the results of the simulation studies based on the proposed scheme. We summarize the thesis in Chapter 7 with the conclusion of the thesis and future work.

We can involve some scheduling algorithm s in th e tim e slots in order to control th e d a ta tra n s mission. T he o th er m otivation is to take advantage of th e characteristics of th e CDM A in order to lim it interference from other users an d other base stations. T he T D D -C D M A technology can be used to im prove the perform ance of the wireless com m unications for the high speed d a ta services. T he T D D -C D M A technology has been em ployed in 3 0 system s. For instance, two T D D -C D M A stan d ard s have already been ad o p ted in th e sta n d ard s of 3 0 com m unication: (1) tim e-division/code-division m ultiple access (T D -C D M A ) is p a rt of th e 3 0 P P sta n d a rd s [2] (see Fig. 1.4) and (2) the tim e-division/synchron o u s code-

2.1

E lem ents o f a W ireless C om m unication S y stem

When we design and analyze a wireless communication system, one of the most im portant and difficult parts is the characteristics of the physical channels through which the sig nals are transm itted. In the wireless communication, not only the channels change with the movement of the mobile users, but also they are effected by the environment which includes path loss, multi-path and fading effects. At present, some technologies have been developed to mitigate these effects, i.e., power control, exploiting multi-path signal arrival and antenna diversity which are shown in blocks in Fig. 2.1 [3] [4].

The information source may be voice or video which can be converted into a digital stream by a source encoder, or may be a data stream, such as a T C P /IP source. Then, the source is modulated in a CDMA system-the narrow signal bandwidth is spread over a large frequency spectrum. Mobile communication channels are generally characterized by m ulti-path signal arrival and fading. Power control (or allocation) and transmission diversity are necessary in order to compensate for the effects of channel fading. The TDDCDMA technology can play a very important role in the power control (or allocation), diversity transmission (and reception), and adaptive antenna functions.

T h ere are several m ethods to achieve th e duplex transm ission of inform ation betw een users an d base stations. T he m ost com m on m eth o d s are FDD and TDD transmission. FD D technology uses sep arate frequency channels for duplex transm ission (uplink and dow nlink directions). T D D technology uses th e sam e frequency b and for tra n sm ittin g an d receiving altern a tely as shown in Fig. 2.2.

Figure 2.2: The TD D Transmission. In a T D D system , uplink and downlink tra n s m it in th e sam e frequency band. T he T D D system accom plishes th e duplex transm ission by ways of allocating certain tim e slots for each transm ission and sw itching altern ately by th e uplink an d downlink. T he len g th s of tim e slots can be unequal and th e num ber of the tim e .slots for th e uplink an d dow nlink can be flexible which are based on th e requirem ents of users. For exam ple, because of traffic asym m etry of Internet service, we can allocate m ost of th e tim e slots for th e dow nlink transm ission in order to im prove the transm ission rate. In a m ulti-user system , we can assign different tim e slots to different users which realize th e m ultiple access services. As well, we can allocate m ore tim e slots to a c ertain user to im prove th e

11 performance l>ased on the channel condition or the service priority. On the other hand,

based the characteristics of the high speed data services (discussed in the next chapter), the communication system demands the base station to transmit data information to one user at a time, and the system has the capacity to provide multiple access. The TDD technology gives us the opportunity to involve some scheduling schemes to achieve this goal. There are some advantages of TDD technology which make the performance of TDD to be better than FDD technology; · TDD technology can efficiently utilize bandwidth. Since the uplink and downlink transmission share the same frequency bandwidth in a TDD system, TDD technol ogy can be realized in non-paired and continuous bands. · Since both uplink and downlink transmission use the same frequency channel in TDD system, the channel characteristics are reciprocal for the two direction. The channel reciprocity is very important, which can be used for power control (or allo cation) and transmission diversity responding to the time-varying mobile channel. · The design of TDD system is simple. Since there is only one set of electronics (i.e filters, oscillators) required at both mobile users and base stations for both uplink and downlink transmission.

D ow nlink o f a C D M A S ystem

In a CDMA system, as discussed in the previous chapter, the narrow-band information signal is multiplied by a very large bandwidth signal called the spreading signal. All users share the same frequency bandwidth and can transm it simultaneously. Each user is assigned a unique code (pseudo-random codeword) to encode the information signal. The receiver knowing the code sequences of the user can decode the received signal after reception and recover the original data (as shown in Fig. 2.3).

T h e CD M A technology offer exclusive advantages, which m ade CD M A to be quite successful as a second-generation cellular system and adopted by th e 3G stan d ard s, such as cdm a2000 an d W C D M A (as shown in Fig. 1.4). T hese advantages include: · M any users can share th e sam e frequency b andw idth in a CDM A system ; eith er T D D or FD D technology can be used. · CD M A has a soft capacity lim it which m eans there is no absolute lim it on the nu m b er of users in a CDM A system . B ut, th e perform ance of th e system degrades gradually as th e num ber of users is increased. · CD M A can reject interference. C ross-correlating the code signal w ith a narrow 

b a n d signal will spread th e power of th e narrow -band signal thereby reducing the interfering pow er in th e inform ation b an d w id th (see Fig. 2.3).

Today, in a non-real tim e d a ta com m unication system (i.e dow nloading files from a wireless In tern e t netw ork), th e downlink transm ission dem ands

13 more throughput than the uplink transmission (i.e, uploading some information to a

server). How to improve the performance of the downlink transmission is one of the hottest topics in 3G wireless communication research. Since CDMA uses co-channel cells, the downlink suffers interference from a small number of other high-power base stations shown in Fig. 2.4. For the downlink transmis sion, the power allocation replaces of the power control (power control is used for uplink transmission) in accordance with the needs of individual subscribers in the cell.

On the other hand, the transmission paths between the base stations and mobile users for the wireless communication can vary severely. The condition of paths can be affected by the environment, such as, buildings, mountains, and foliage. Hence, there are some statistical models to simulate the real world. The model considered in this thesis is based on the log-distance path loss and log-normal shadowing (discussed in detail in the next chapter).

channel conditions in each time slot and serves the packets destined for them first. But, one obvious disadvantage of this scheme is that if an M T is subject to long-term fading due to its location, for example, if a user is located near the border of the cells, its data may not be transm itted for an extended period of time.

A lgorithm 2: H D R -as proposed originally by Q ual com m

The high-data-rate (HDR) [6 ] system is based on Internet protocols adapted to the mobile environment. The HDR scheduling algorithm was designed for the downlink transmission. Because of the vastly different requirements, high-data-rate users are separated from lowrate voice users by different RF carriers. The high-data-rate users are scheduled over time slots, where the slot lengths depend on channel conditions and transmission is executed with a constant maximum transmit power. In the HDR system, rate control replaces the power control [6 ] [7]. In the HDR scheme, in order to take advantage of the temporal variations of the channel, the system schedules transmission to a mobile user who has the strongest signal levels. Before we introduce the algorithm in detail, we present some terms defined in the HDR algorithm. DRC is the rate requested by the mobile user in a given time slot. R is the average rate received by the mobile user over a window of appropriate size. N is the number of the mobile user in the system. Ri{t) is the estimate of the average rate for user i at time slot t, i -- 1, ...fV. Similarly, during the time slot t, DRCi{t) is the D R C for user i. The aim for the algorithm is to send data to the mobile user that has the highest D R C jR . It works as follows: · To estimate and transmit: The user with the highest ratio of DRCi{t)/Ri{t) out of all N users will receive transmission at each decision time.

19 In the original HDR system, a mobile user determines the D R C from the prediction of

the S I R expected to be seen by the mobile user over the slot during which the transmission will occur. S I R predictions are made from current and past S I R estimates. In order to achieve a small packet error rate (PER), D R C requests are conservative, especially in fast changing channel conditions. These conservative requests often result in excess S IR , which could have been used to achieve increased throughput. The H-ARQ scheme employs an acknowledgement bit which is transmitted on the uplink after every slot in a potentially multi-slot downlink packet transmission. The bit indicates whether or not the mobile user has successfully decoded the transm itted packet Multi-slot transmissions are therefore terminated as soon as the mobile user successfully decodes a packet. As a result, H-ARQ scheme can increase the effective bit rate, improves the overall throughput of the system and implicitly reduce the excess S IR .

A lgorithm 4: Pow er A llocation Schem e in th e H D R System

In original HDR, when the base station chooses a mobile user, it always transmits signal with full power in order to improve the throughput of the system. But, when a mobile user is located close to a base station, the user acquires an excessive signal to interference power ration (S IR ) for a maximum achievable data rate. This excessive power results in lower S I R for users at cell boundaries. By allocating lower power for user near a base station than the maximum power, other cell interference can be alleviated to users near cell boundaries [1 0 ] [1 1 ]. For a HDR system, base stations transmit data at a maximum power so that one can achieve a high data rate, which results in rate control instead of power control. The difference between the power control and the rate control has analogy with CDMA and TDMA. Generally, many users share the radio resources for graceful degradation in CDMA system. The best result for the same rate users is obtained under perfect power control. On the contrary, only one user can be served during a time interval and ideally

A lgorith m 5: Inter-C ell C oordination Schem es

Motivation of the inter-cell coordination schemes is to improve the ''fairness" of the service seen by the users of an " HDR-like" system. In the downlink transmission of a CDMA system, system uses variable spreading gain to achieve different data rates for users based on their received S IR s. Although such schemes work efficiently, but they are not " fair" in that there is great inequality of the data rates achieved by various users. There are two schemes proposed in [1 2 ]. · Time Coordinated Transmission In the scheme, system adopts round robin type of scheduling. Base stations in each neighboring cells share frame duration T f , containing a coordinated period, Tc and an uncoordinated period, as shown in Fig. 3.1.

from a given base sta tio n . T h e num ber of user sym bols p er slot period depends on th e p a rtic u la r radio propagation environm ent. D uring th e coordinated period, each base sta tio n is " 0 N " for slots and ''O F F " for N g /f slots in "rou n d -ro b in "

fashion. D uring coordinated period, only one of th e bases in th e neighborhood is active a t any m om ent. T he uncoordinated period contains a fixed num ber {Nu) tim e slots, d u rin g th is period, th e base statio n s tra n sm it signals to th e users in th eir own cells sim ultaneously w ith o u t considering th e transm issions of th e neighboring cells. · Soft H and-off Scheduling E ach base sta tio n has no t only its own d a ta which is tra n s m itte d to th e users located in its own cell, b u t also it has a copy of th e d a ta of o th er base statio n s which sh o u ld be tra n s m itte d to th e users located in th e neighboring cells. As previous tim e coordinated transmission scheme, each cell site has a period, Tu, during which th e base sta tio n tra n sm its only to its own users, and a period, during which it

tra n s m its th e soft hand-off d a ta to assist users belonging to oth er cells. W h en co o rd in atio n is used as th e proposed scheme, th e S I R is im proved d u rin g th e c o o rd in a te d period. O n th e o th er hand, th is schem e works as " ro u nd-robin" fashion, some users m ay end up w ith extrem ely low th ro u g h p u t, despite receiving th eir fair share of th e n u m b er of slots. However, because th is scheme does no t consider th e oth er param eters, such as th e channel conditions, th e user d istrib u tio n of th e cell, it m ay degrade th e perfor m an ce of th e system . Especially, the uncoordinated period 7k is no t suitable for reducing th e interference. O therw ise, during th e coordinated period 7k, each base " w astes" some of its tim e tra n s m ittin g d a ta to users in its own cell.

Finally, the time during which none of its neighbors is transmitting is termed as 0 -time. In the data-only networks, the base station, when ON, should transmit to only one data user at a time with maximum power for optimality. In this inter-cell scheduling, base station are allowed to alternate between ON-periods and OFF-periods in a a coordinated manner. There exist some optimality conditions to improve the throughput: · Subsets of outer users on either side of the cell that should be served when only the neighboring base station in the opposite side is ON.

In stead , th e adap tiv e algorithm s for determ ining th e op tim al rev enue vector online in an ite rativ e fashion, w ith o u t the need for explicit knowledge of th e channel behavior. T h e scheduling algorithm is able to m ain tain the ta rg e t th ro u g h p u t ratio s an d can tra c k su d d en changes in th e channel conditions or th ro u g h p u t targ e ts well. D ep en d ing on th e specific situ atio n , th ere are various perform ance criteria th a t m ight be a d o p ted . One of th e m ost com m on perform ance objectives is th ro u g h p u t m axim iza tio n . T h is can be achieved by sim ply assigning each slot to th e user w ith th e cu rren tly

25 highest feasible rate, such as the Best Channel First scheme (discussed in Algorithm 1 ).

The disadvantage is th at typically only a few strong users will ever be selected for trans mission, causing starvation of all others. But, the Dynamic Channel-Sensitive Scheduling Algorithm focuses on maximum revenue. It introduces a class of revenue-based scheduling strategies. Suppose that there are rewards per bit transm itted to the various

users. A revenue-based strategy assigns the n th transmission slot to the user m*{n) with the current maximum rate-reward product, i.e., m*{n) = max[wTTiAm(M)], m = 1,..., M, (3.3)

where M is the number of the data users served by a base station, Rm{'^) representing the feasible rate for user m in the nth slot. Hence, the above principle maximizes the revenue earned in each individual slot and the total cumulative revenue as well as the average revenue.

O ther Scheduling A lgorithm s

There are also other HDR-like scheduling algorithms proposed for the high speed data transmission. For example: · ''Joint Power Control and Intra-cell Scheduling of DS-CDMA Non-real Time Data" [16]: The scheme uses time division so that users transmit in a one-by-one fashion within each cell. As well as, the scheme combines the intracell scheduling with a suggested distributed power control algorithm for the inter-cell interference man agement. · " Opportunistic Transmission Scheduling W ith Resource-Sharing Constraints in Wire less Networks" [17]: the scheme exploits time-varying channel conditions and max imizes the system performance stochastically under a certain resource allocation constraint.

26 · ''F air Scheduling in W ireless P acket N etw orks" [18]: B ased on a n a d a p ta tio n of fluid

fair queueing (F F Q ) to handle location-dependent error bursts. · " D ow nlink R esource A llocation and P ricing for W ireless N etw orks" [19]. T he schem e applies to eith er a tim e-slo tted system (e.g., H D R schem e) or a CDM A system whose fea tu re is th a t th e channel quality varies across th e users. T h e algorithm uses a pric ing schem e for th e allocation of radio resources. In o rder to m axim ize revenue in such a system , th e base sta tio n should allocate resources in a discrim inatory m an n er, w here different users are charged different prices based in p a rt on th eir channel quality.

T

h e current packet networks have been designed mainly for voice calls with symmet ric transmission rate requirements from base stations {BSs) to mobile terminals

{M Ts) or vice versa. W ith the development of Internet, more and more mobile users access Internet via wireless networks. Most users require higher downlink (i.e, from B S s to M T s) rates than uplink (i.e, from M T s to B Ss) rates, which makes the nature of the data traffic to be asymmetric [6 ]. This thesis focuses on the downlink transmission and proposes a scheduling scheme which is called coordinated location-based downlink scheduling scheme (CLDSS) to support high data rate in cellular CDMA systems. In CDMA systems as discussed in the previous chapter, all of M T s transmit in the same frequency band and access the transmission medium simultaneously. The original narrow-hand signals are multiplied by a very large bandwidth signals - a set of unique spreading code sequences, that generates wide-band signals for transmission. Each M T has its own pseudo-random (PN) codeword which is approximately orthogonal to all other codewords. In the downlink, each B S transmits to all of its M T s simultaneously and each user recovers the signal intended for it by despreading with its assigned code. Except for the desired signal that will be despreaded, all other M T 's signals coming from its home base station as well as other base stations will remain spread and appear effectively as

28 noise. T h is rad io access technology for cellular com m unication m akes th e CD M A system to have m any advantages, such as soft capacity lim it and noise im m unity. In 3 0 wireless netw orks, th ese advantages have been fu rth er exploited to su p p o rt m ultim edia com m u n icatio n over th e tim e-varying wireless channels. Since th e capacity of CDM A system s is ty p ically interference-lim ited, th e tra n sm it power m ust be carefully controlled. O th er wise, th e signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of on-going connections will degrade which will resu lt in higher b it error rates. In theory, it is possible, a t least in th e downlink, to use o rth o g o n al sig n atu re sequences of codes for different M T s to avoid interference am ong different codes. However, in practice, m u lti-p ath effects decrease th e orthogonality at

th e receiver, a n d th e signal intended for one user becom es interference for oth er users. T h e careful allocation of tran sm it power is one m eth o d of controlling th e interference. O n th e o th er h an d , th e characteristics an d requirem ents of h igh-rate d a ta services and low -rate voice services are different; for exam ple, two-way conversational speech requires stric t adherence to sym m etry. However, high-speed d a ta th a t needs to be dow nloaded from a server can to le ra te some delay, b u t it requires a very high th ro u g h p u t which m akes th e B S to tra n s m it signal to th e intended user w ith large power.

S ystem M od el D escription

In order to take advantage of the channel conditions of the time-varying wireless envi ronment and to deal with the problem of multi-user interference, scheduling is used in a time-slotted CDMA system. The concept of time-slotted CDMA system comes from the TDD (time-division duplex)-CDMA system, so called TD-CDMA system. In TDCDMA systems, both of the uplink and downlink transmissions use the same frequency channel. The B S allocates certain time-slots for each transmission and does switching the transmission alternately between the two links. The TD-CDMA system provides the performance as well as the flexibility to fulfill the service requirements [20]. Fig. 4.1 shows the structure of the frame in the TD-CDMA system where the frame is divided by several time slots.

In each slot, the B S can schedule the transmission. For example, a B S has the flexibil ity to choose the user, assign different data rate and decide the direction of transmission (uplink or downlink). The proposed HDR-like scheduling scheme focuses on the downlink transmission; hence, all of the slots are allocated for downlink direction in the CDMA system in our work. This kind of TD-CDMA model is called time-slotted CDMA in the proposed

scheduling scheme. The advantage of this model is that pooling of CDMA codes and

30 T D M A tim e slots can easily provide th e capacity dem anded by a c ertain user (i.e., by th e

allo catio n of several codes an d T D M A tim e slots, or b o th to a single user). T he proposed scheduling schem e can adaptively allocate th e tim e slots to different users based on th e netw ork load or d a ta ra te required by M T s an d also allocate th e tra n sm it pow er based on th e user locations to control the interference. We consider two neighboring cells in a square geom etry (see Fig. 4.2). T here are base sta tio n s B S q an d B S \ in th e cell 0 and cell

respectively. We divide each cell into two

co-centric areas as a re a A (inner) and area B (outer). T he distances betw een th e edges of o u ter a n d in n er areas, an d th e center are D an d d respectively as show n in Fig. 4.2.

Intra C ell Scheduling: H D R -like Scheduling

There can be several users in one cell. If a B S transmits the signals to these users simultaneously, all of the users share the power of the B S and interfere with each other

[ 14 ].

In o rd er to show th e advantages of th e in tra cell scheduling schem e, we consider two cases as follows: · C ase A: L et us consider a tim e interval d u rin g which th e to ta l tra n s m itte d power levels are Pjo from B S q and Pu from B S i respectively.

C ase B: Here, each user i is allocated th e to ta l power Pto (cell 0), b u t only for a fractio n 4> i of th e interval. In o th er words, 4 > i is used as a tim e-sharing ra th e r th a n a pow er-sharing p aram eter. D uring th e period th a t user i receives signals from th e B S , no pow er is used to tran sm it signals to o th er users in th e cell, which m eans user i does n o t receive interference from o th er user in th e sam e cell a t th e sam e tim e. Hence, th e ra te received by user i during th a t period is:

(4. 5)

W h en com paring th e two schemes, th e th ro u g h p u t ratio is;

(4. 6)

F rom th e above inequality, th e system should m eet one of th e below conditions at equality:

· Only one user in the cell can be scheduled for transmission, so th at condition, the case A and case B are same. Note that 0 < < 1.

33 = 1. In this

· There are perfect orthogonality conditions between received signals and no multipath signals, so that fi = 0. However, in practice, because of the time delay and the dynamic fading, the m ultipath impacts the orthogonality and sometimes the influence is very high. In our analysis, we assume ft -- 1, that is the worst case scenario for orthogonality between signals. In conclusion, to improve the throughput of system, it is better to transmit to one user at a time rather than transm it to several users simultaneously. In other words, it is better to schedule one user in one cell (intra-cell scheduling) at one time as done in the proposed scheme.

4.3

Inter C ell Scheduling: P rop osed Scheduling Schem e (C LDSS)

The purpose of the proposed scheduling scheme is to improve the downlink throughput of the CDMA system by reducing the interference from the neighboring cells. Prom the results in previous section, the proposed scheduling scheme chooses only one (data) user in each cell during one time slot. The proposed scheduling scheme will incur delays to many users and hence is appropriate for delay insensitive data users. Therefore, in the following we refer the user as data user. Because the two-cells share the same frequency band and the multipath reduces the orthogonality of the pseudo-random codewords, there is co-channel interference between the two M T s located in different cells. The interference is based on the location of the user and the transmission power of the base station. When a M T is located near the border of the cells, it would more likely experience interference from the other B S. When the distance between the user and the neighboring base station reduces, the interference power increases. Meanwhile, the distance between the user and its home base station

increases, w hich m akes th e desired signal pow er to reduce.

34 T h e result is th e reduced

SIR a t th e M T ' s receiver. One of the m ethods to deal w ith th is effect is to reduce th e tran sm issio n pow er of th e neighboring B S a t th is tim e an d to keep a c ertain level of tran sm issio n power of its hom e base sta tio n to th e desired user. O n th e o th er h an d , w hen a M T is located close to th e B S^ usually, th e channel condi tio n is b e tte r due to closer distance. Since th e system has a preset m axim um transm ission ra te (for exam ple, 2M bps), it does not need full power to tra n sm it d a ta . Therefore, we can allocate p a rt of th e m axim um power to th e M T located in th e inner area. T h ere are tw o advantages of th is technique: it can reduce th e interference to o th er M T s located in th e neighboring cell as well as it can save th eir b a tte ry power. T he proposed scheduling algorithm works as follows:

· T h e to ta l m axim um power available a t b o th base stations is P. · T h e system allocates th e num ber of tim e slots to MTg located in th e inner an d o u ter a re a d epending on th e d istrib u tio n of th e users in th e cells. For exam ple, if th ere are

th e users w hich are located in th e inner area, and other 80% tim e slots are assigned to th e users lo cated in th e outer area.

B ecause we consider th e power level based on th e traffic load which relates to th e

35 user distribution and the area of the cell, we set < /? as a function of the ratio of inner

area A and outer area B. The area of inner and outer area are A x (P and 4 x respectively, so that (p = When

allocates power p x P. In the same time slot, B S i chooses MTi which is located in the outer area (area B) of cell 1 and transmits data with power P. During a time slot, the base station chooses one user in one of the areas (area A or area B) based on some criteria, e.g., random- or channel condition- or prioritybased user selection algorithm.

The scheduling scheme and power allocation in the proposed scheme can be described using Fig. 4.3 for different time slots.

Sum m ary

In order to improve the throughput of the high speed data communication service, we pro posed a new scheduling scheme (CLDSS) based on the characteristics of wireless commu nication. In our proposed scheduling scheme, we employed time slots in CDMA systems; The transmission from a cell was coordinated with the transmission of the neighboring cell. We divided a cell as inner area (close to the base station) and as outer area (close to

36 th e b o rd er). W e involved a power ad ju stm en t factor {ip) to control th e signal power allo

c a te d to th e users in th e inner or outer areas. In one tim e slot, th e base sta tio n choosed one user from its own cell. We allocated tim e slots to th e users depending on th e user d istrib u tio n in th e cell. T h e proposed scheme can im prove th e perform of th e CDM A sy stem b y reducing th e interference from th e neighboring cell. In th e nex t chapter, th e p ro p o sed CLDSS schem e is analyzed for th ro u g h p u t.

T h ere have been m any studies showing th e capacity gain of CDM A, in w hich uniform d istrib u tio n of th e user popu latio n was assum ed across th e coverage area. C om pared to th e m ore general case of non-uniform user distribution, th e use of uniform d istrib u tio n m odel usually overestim ates th e capacity of th e system . In th e proposed scheduling scheme, CLDSS assum es non-uniform d istrib u tio n of users in each cell to analyze th e capacity of th e system . T h e m odel of th e non-uniform d istrib u tio n of users can be described as follows: · T h e to ta l num ber of users in a cell is N . · T h e cell is divided into two parts, as shown in Fig. 4.2. · T h e d istrib u tio n of users in area A and area B are uniform respectively w ith prob ab ility density pa an d pi, as shown in Fig. 5.1.

where (/? is a power adjustment factor which is the ratio of the assigned power to a user located in the inner area (area A) and the assigned power to a user located in the outer area (area B). In the proposed scheduling scheme, let y depend on the ratio of the area of the inner part (area A) and the area of the outer part (area B) in one cell, so = (d/D)^,

hence, 0 < < /? < 1. Note that ip -- I corresponds to the ULISS scheme which will be discussed later. Because ^oo and ^oi are assumed to be independent, letting C oo --^oi = %, the difference X is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance 2 cr^. In general, in a CDMA system, when the achieved SIR is less than a certain value, the system can not effectively decode the signals. For this reason, CLDSS scheme sets up a condition for transmission, that is, when the SIR is less than a certain value, the B S should stop to transmit any information to the user until the end of time slot. CLDSS scheme sets the threshold of SIR as r. The relationship between the parameters of the system is as follows;

g/E =

>T .

(5.5)

In accordance with the CLDSS scheme, the transmission power assigned by the base station is dependent on the location (that is affected by the distance and shadowing of the user), so that the expression of the condition to transmit is different between area A and area B. · For the user located in the area A:

B ecause th e proposed schem e is based on th e location of the users, how to p a rtitio n the cell is very im p o rta n t. In order to analyze the proposed scheduling scheme, first of all, we have to d eterm ine th e distance betw een th e center of th e cell and the b ord er of the inner area. O ne of th e reasons is th a t th e power adjustm ent factor (p is a function of th e norm alized distance d* of th e inner area. We dehne th e norm alized distance of the inner a re a as d* -- . T h e other reason is how to allocate th e tim e slots to th e users

of the contribution from the inner area and another from the outer area (which will be discussed later). There are some trends that can be observed from Fig. 5.2: 1. The normalized throughput increases as long as the normalized distance reduces. Hence, if one wants to get higher throughput, one should keep the normalized dis tance d* as small as possible. 2. In the limit when d* =
1,

(or d = D), we turn the CLDSS scheme into the traditional

uncoordinated location independent scheduling scheme (ULISS) where each base station schedules a user in its own cell without considering the location of the user. 3. When d* < 0.4, the throughput of the CLDSS scheme can be analyzed using the curve-fitted formula T = 1 . 6 x l 0 ® x approximately.

The normalized throughput of the system is influenced by parameters, such as the density of the user distribution in the cell, the total users of the cell and environment of the wireless communication. When we optimistically set d*, we can realize the influence on the throughput contributed by these parameters. We compare the performance of the CLDSS scheme with two other scheduling schemes, which are Uncoordinated Location-Independent Scheduling Scheme (ULISS) and Coordi nated Location-Independent Scheduling Scheme (CLISS). · Uncoordinated Location-Independent Scheduling Scheme (ULISS): In this scheme, we set
99

=

1.

This means no power adjustment is done and each

B S transmits with full power (F) to any M T in any time slot without considering the location of the user. The transmissions in the two cells are independent, which means the two cells do not coordinate with each other. Additionally the base station randomly chooses the users in the inner or outer areas. To be consistent with the CLDSS scheme, the ULISS scheme allocates the time slots to the two areas (area A and area B) based on the user distribution of the two areas. For an instance, when
20%

users are located in the inner area, the base station allocate

20%

time slots

44

to th e users in th e inner area. W ith in these allocated tim e slots, each base sta tio n selects a ran d o m user in either inner or o u ter area. Coordinated Location - Independent Scheduling Scheme (CLISS): In th is schem e, we set y? = 0.5. The B S tran sm its full power (P ) to th e M T s lo c a te d in th e o u ter area (area B) and half power (0.5P ) to th e M T s located in th e in n er a re a (area A). In addition, while a base statio n tran sm its signal to th e user lo ca te d in th e inner, th e neighboring base sta tio n chooses the user located in the o u te r a re a to tra n sm it signal (coordinated scheduling). Similarly, th e percentage of th e tim e slots allocated to th e users in th e inner (or outer) area depends on the p e rcen tag e of th e users located in th e inner (or outer area). T he m ain difference b etw een CLISS and CLDSS is the power ad ju stm en t factor. In CLDSS, th e power is a llo cated in p ro p o rtio n to th e areas (or num ber of users) and in CLISS, equally in areas disregarding th e num ber of users in these areas. In sum m ary, th e p aram eters for th e above three schemes can be seen in Fig. 5.3.

· W h en th e norm alized distance {d*) of th e inner area is less th a n ab o u t 0.33, th e perform ance of th e proposed scheduling is superior. For exam ple, if th e d* is equal to 0.2, th e norm alized m ean of th ro u g h p u t using the CLDSS scheme is 6.81 x 10^ and th a t using th e ULISS scheme is 9.21 x 10^, so th e average th ro u g h p u t is im proved 640% by th e proposed scheduling scheme. However, th e users should no t be too close to th e base statio n , in words, d* > > 0. Firstly, it is clear th a t (4.1) does n o t hold for £ = 0, and th e system m odel evaluates the th ro u g h p u t for values of d istan ce (betw een base sta tio n and user location) which are in th e far-field of th e tra n s m ittin g an ten n a. Secondly, because we employ a power a d ju stm en t factor < p, if d* is very sm all, th e n the radio signal power assigned to the users located in th e in n er area w ould n o t be large enough to tran sm it d a ta th a t can be decoded usefully in th e presence of noise. · If d* > 0.33, th e perform ance of th e ULISS scheme is b e tte r th a n th e CLDSS schem e. T h e reason is th a t the average th ro u g h p u t of a cell is com prised of two p a rts: th e th ro u g h p u t contribution from th e inner area and outer areas. C om paring w ith ULISS scheme, because of th e effect of factor c/9, the radio signal power to th e users located in th e inner area is reduced by (fP when we employ th e CLDSS schem e. A t th e sam e tim e, th e base statio n of neighboring cell tran sm its signal w ith full pow er P w hich is sam e as th e transm ission power used in the ULISS scheme. U n d er th is condition, th e desired signal power is reduced an d the interference power is n o t changed. W hen we com pare th e CLDSS scheme w ith th e ULISS scheme, the S I R in using th e CLDSS scheme is reduced. Therefore, the th ro u g h p u t of th e inner a re a reduces, w hich is a sacrifice. Oppositely, we use th e full power P to tra n sm it signals to th e users located in the outer area, which m akes th e desired signal power to b e im proved. In th e m eantim e, th e neighboring base sta tio n assigns p a rt of th e pow er as (pP to tra n s m it signal to th e user located in its own cell, which m akes th e interference to be reduced.

the outer area is improved. So that the throughput of the outer area increases, which is a compensation. Fig. 5.4 shows us beyond this point {d* = 0.33), the reduction of throughput provided by users in the inner area can not be compensated by the improvement of throughput provided by users in the outer area. · There is a key point for the normalized distance, which is d* = 0.33. Therefore, we conclude that the normalized distance (d*) should be less than 0.33 for the CLDSS scheme under the condition with uniform distribution of users in a cell in order to improve the throughput comparing with the ULISS scheme.

We now analyze the performance of non-uniform user distribution in the cell. We set the density of the user distribution in the inner area (pa) to be either 1.7 x 10" ® o r 5 X 10"®(users/m^). From Fig. 5.5, we can analyze the
average

throughput by employing

the proposed scheduling scheme (CLDSS) with that by employing no power adjustable scheme (ULISS). From Fig. 5.5, it can be seen that: · In the ULISS system, as the density Pa decreases, which means more users are located far away from the base station and near the border of the cell area (if we fix the normalized distance of the inner area d*), the throughput of the system reduces distinctly. But the change of the average throughput using CLDSS scheme is small. · The change of the normalized mean of throughput with different density of the user distribution in the inner area using the ULISS scheme is much larger, when we compared it with the CLDSS scheme. For example, if we set the density (pa) to be 5

10"® (users/m^) and 1.7 x 10"® (users/m^) respectively and the normalized

distance {d*) to be 0.33, the change in throughput by using the ULISS scheme is 1.13

IQ-s (users/m^) is 9.05 x 10^ and the throughput with p& = 1.7 x 10"^

(users/m^) is 9.49 x 10^. · The effect of user density on the throughput using the proposed scheduling scheme is very small., When the normalized distance d* is less than 0.4, the difference between the two throughput with the different density is minimal. Hence, the proposed scheduling scheme can improve the fairness of the system in terms of providing throughput. · Similarly, because of the effect of the power adjustment factor ^p discussed before, there is also a key point {d* = 0.28) for the non-uniform user distribution system. When d* < 0.28, the throughput using the CLDSS scheme is much better than th at of the ULISS system. For example, when d* = 0.2 and pa = 1.7 x 10"^ (users/m^), the throughput using the CLDSS scheme is 6.62 x 10'^ and that of the ULISS scheme is 6.83

10^. But, beyond this point, when more users are located near the base

station, the throughput of the ULISS scheme is better, e.g., when d* = 0.3 and Pa = 5

10"^ (users/m^), the throughput of the ULISS scheme is 1.76 x 10^ and

that of the CLDSS scheme is 1.28 x 10" ^. Based on the results discussed before, there are some key points of the normalized distance of the inner area. That is, when we set the normalized distance d* to be less than these key points, the throughput of the system using the CLDSS scheme is better than the ULISS scheme. The key points are affected by the user density of the inner area. The relationship between the key points and the user density is shown in Fig. 5.6.

T h e re is also a key po in t for th e density of th e user d istrib u tio n in th e inner area, it is Pa = 1.8 X 10^4 (users/m ^) corresponding to d* = 0.2. W h en Pa reduces, th e m ore users are located in th e o u ter area (which is 97% of th e e n tire cell) an d the average th ro u g h p u t of th e CLDSS schem e increases. As we assum ed th e norm alized distance [d*) is 0.2, th e power ad ju stm en t factor (<p) sh o u ld be 0.04. In accordance w ith the CLDSS scheme, th e base sta tio n assigns th e full signal pow er (P ) to the users located in th e o u ter area and 0 .0 4 P to the users lo c a te d in th e inner area. As we discussed before, by com paring w ith the ULISS schem e, th e pow er a d ju stm en t factor can improve th e th ro u g h p u t of th e o u ter area, b u t it also sacrifices some of th e th ro u g h p u t of th e inner area. W hen m ore users are

53

located far away from the base station (i.e.,the percentage of the users located in the outer area increases), the time slots allocated to the outer area are increased. Hence, the contribution of the throughput coming from the outer area increases. Contrary, the average distance between the base station and the users increase which make the throughput of the ULISS scheme to be reduced. · The effect of user density on the CLDSS scheme is not significant comparing with the ULISS scheme. For example, using the CLDSS scheme, the throughput is 6.38 x 10^ when Pa = 5 X 10"^ (users/m^) and the throughput is 2.4 x 10^ when pa = 6 x 10"^ (users/m^). The difference of throughput between the largest and smallest user density is 60%. On the contrary, using the ULISS scheme, the throughput is 1.63 x 10"* when Pa = 5 x 10"^ (users/m^) and the throughput is 1.75 x 10^. The difference is 970% as shown in Fig. 5.7. Because of the characteristic of the CLDSS scheme, the CLDSS scheme can improve the fairness for the non-uniform distribution of users in the CDMA system. Typically, when more users are located near the border of the cell comparing with the ULISS scheme, and the CLDSS scheme can improve the average throughput of the system.

The result of the optimization is shown in Fig. 5.9. · In order to improve the fairness of the system with non-uniform user distribution in the cell, we involve fairness adjustment parameter K into the power adjustment the ULISS

In accordance w ith th e CLDSS scheme proposed in previous chapter, we coordinated th e tran sm issio n s betw een th e neighboring cells. Since we employed a power a d ju stm en t facto r to co n tro l th e radio signal power to users based on th e locations and allocated th e c e rtain tim e slots to users based on th e load of users, th e CLDSS was useful to lim it th e neighboring cell interference and to improved the perform ance of th e non-uniform user d istrib u tio n system . In this chapter, we presented some num erical results from th e analysis of th e CLDSS. T h e proposed scheduling scheme has some advantages which were discussed using th e num erical results.

In th e next ch ap ter, we evaluate th e perform ance of th e proposed CLDSS scheme by sim ulation studies.

Chapter 6 Sim ulation and R esults

S

y s t e m simulation is implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed CLDSS scheduling scheme. As discussed in the previous chapter, the CLDSS scheme

coordinates the transmission between the inter-cell mobile terminals (M Ts) in a downlink CDMA system. In the CLDSS scheme, a cell is divided into two flexible co-centric areas based on the traffic load in the cell. The base stations (BSs) allocate the transmission power based on the distance between M T s and B S s with a power adjustment factor. When one B S transmits data to a M T which is located in the inner area with lower power, the neighboring B S transmits data to a M T located in the outer area with more power during the same time slot and vice versa. The number of the time slots assigned to the inner or outer area is based on the user distribution of the two-cell system. How to choose the users to be scheduled in the inner and outer area can be determined by various performance criteria, such as channel condition, priority, revenue and throughput. Within the simulation, we assume a two-cell system model as shown in Fig. 4.2.

The distance between the base station and the edge of the outer area (D) is 1000m. We do not count the users located in the area too close to the base station (the area is a square with side distance of 100m). We assume the mobile channels are affected by the log-distance path loss and log-normal shadowing where the corresponding parameters are a = 4 and the a ~ 8 dB. This model gives an attenuation which is the product of the fourth power of the distance and a log-normal random variable whose standard

scheme, we use the random selection of users in our simulation. Employing this selection criterion, during the period of transmissions to users in the inner area, we randomly choose a user from the inner area. We call this scheme as " CLDSS I". Similarly, we randomly choose a user in the outer area during the time slots in which B S transmits signals to the users located in the outer area. On the other hand, we use a ''Best Channel First" selection criterion in order to realize the full capacity of the CLDSS scheme for the system. In this scheme, we choose a user who has the best channel. We call this scheme as "CLDSS 11" . In the simulation, the procedure to calculate the average throughput of the system is outlined in the flowchart in Fig. 6.2. During the transmissions,
1.

the base station determines the number of time slots allocated to the users located in the inner and outer areas, which is based on the percentage of the users in the two areas. For example, if there are 20% users located in the inner area, the base station allocates
20%

time slots to the inner area.

2

. during this period, the base stations randomly choose the users in accordance with CLDSS I scheme or choose the users who have the best channel in accordance with CLDSS II scheme.

3. the base station sets the power adjustment factor (ip) based on the division of the inner and outer areas. Then, the base station allocates the signal power level to the users. That is, the lower signal power is transm itted to the users located in the inner area and the higher signal power is transm itted to the users located in the outer area which are affected by the factor ip. 4. the base stations transmit signal to the certain users with allocated power level and scheduled time slots.

From these Figures, we can make the following observations; · when the normalized distance (d*) of the inner area is less than about performance of the CLDSS I scheme is the best. · if d* > 0.33, the performance of the ULISS scheme is the best. · There is a key point for the normalized distance, which is d* = 0.33 with uniform user distribution of users in the cell. The reasons were discussed in the chapter 5. From the figure, we can conclude that the simulated and analyzed results are in close agreement.

From Fig. 6.5, we can get: · In the ULISS scheme, when the density Pa decreases, the throughput of system reduces distinctly. However, the change of the average throughput with increasing inner user density in the CLISS I system is small. · There is also a key point {d* = 0.29); th at is, when d* < 0.29, the performance of CLDSS I is better than ULISS for inner user density of 5 x

with other cells, we can increase the throughput as well as the fairness. However, there is also some room to improve the performance by considering different ways to choose the users depending on different criteria. For example, we can choose the best channel in any time slot (CLDSS II) instead of randomly choosing any user in each of the inner and outer area (CLDSS I). Using CLDSS II, it is possible to achieve higher throughput in the system. In order to compare the performances of the two versions of the CLDSS scheme, the results of the simulation are shown next:

6.2.1

Fig. 6.9 shows the results of the CLDSS schemes with uniform user distribution, where the number of users is 100 and density Pa = Pb = 2.525 x 10"^ (users/m^). There are some features of the CLDSS II comparing with the CLDSS I;

T he throughput of the CLDSS II is obviously higher than that of the CLDSS I.

Because th e CLDSS II scheme picks th e b est channel user to tra n sm it d a ta , it can achieve higher d a ta rate. · W ith th e norm alized distance (d*) reducing, th e th ro u g h p u t of th e system increases. T h e power a d ju stm en t factor ip = {d/D)"^ = w hen d* reduces, also reduces.

T h a t is, w hen base statio n tran sm its d a ta to a user located near th e border w ith full pow er P , th e neighboring base sta tio n chooses a user located in its inner area w ith lower power cpP. Hence, the neighboring interference should be reduced, which is useful to im prove the throughput. A t this point, th e two versions of th e CLDSS schem e are sim ilarly behaving in providing the th ro u g h p u t.

Effect o f U ser D en sity on th e T hroughput

The effect of user density on both of the two versions of the CLDSS scheme is similar as shown in Fig. 6.11, where the number of users is 100 and the normalized distance is 0.2. When Pa increases, there are less users located in the outer area. On one hand, in general, because the distance between the base station and the users located in the outer area is larger, the channel condition is weaker. On the other hand, the base station allocates lower signal power to users located in the inner area, in other words, the neighboring interference is reduced. If the factor p is small enough, such as < /? = 0.04, the signalto-noise ratio for users located in the outer area is increased. The throughput can be compensated by the users located in the outer area. But, with the number of users in the outer area reducing, the time slots allocated to the outer area is reduced. As a result, the compensation of throughput from the outer area is reduced, so that the throughput of the system is reduced as shown in Fig. 6.11.

6.2.4

Effect o f U ser N u m b er on th e T hroughput

The effect of the number of the users on the throughput with non-uniform user distribution is not significant, because the base stations just chooses one user, either using random selection in CLDSS I or choose a user who has the best channel in CLDSS II during any time slot. The feature of the CLDSS scheme makes the system to have ''soft throughput", that is, the CLDSS scheme is not very sensitive to traffic in the cell as shown in Fig. 6.12.

6.3

Sum m ary

In this chapter, we presented the results from the simulation studies. Simulation results showed the consistency with the theoretical analysis. In the meantime, simulation study also demonstrated that the proposed scheme can limit the interference from the neighbor ing base stations and improve the performance of the CDMA system. When we set the normalized distance d* and the user density of inner area to be less than the key points, the throughput of the system using the CLDSS scheme was better the the ULISS scheme. Otherwise, the ULISS scheme can achieve higher throughput. Therefore, we modified the CLDSS scheme as: if d* and pa ware less than the key point, we used the original CLDSS scheme; if d* and Pa was larger than the key point, we used the ULISS scheme in order to achieve higher throughput. In the meantime, the CLDSS scheme can improve the fairness for non-uniform user distribution system and make the CDMA to have "soft throughput". The relationship between the key points, the normalized distance {d*) and the density of users in the inner area (p^) can be shown in Fig. 6.13, where the number of users is 100. On the other hand, when we employed Best Channel First (BCF) based user selection in our CLDSS scheme, the throughput of the system increased significantly. However, using the BCF selection, some users with weak channel conditions can not get the data rate from the base station which reduces the fairness, although we alternatively choosed the users from the inner and outer area based on the percentage of time slots.

Chapter 7 Summary
7.1 C onclusion

With the development of the digital communication techniques, especially, popularization of the Internet service, the requirements for high speed data services are rising rapidly. Currently, the wireline Internet services can provide the data rate more than 2Mbps. More and more wireless subscribers demand the same quality-of-service (QoS) of high speed data service as the wireline communication system. Hence, 3G communication standards have been proposed and 3 G system are in deployment in order to meet the requirements of the high data rates. 3G systems promise multi-maga bit Internet access, communications using Voice over Internet Protocol, increased network capacity. Because the characteristics of the high speed data communication are fundamentally different from voice communication, notably, (i) throughput required by the downlink is much higher than that of uplink transmission, (ii) most of the high speed data services can tolerate some delay and data traffic is bursty, and (iii) data rate requirements are very high. On the other hand, the mobile channel conditions vary with the mobile environment timely. Therefore, the relative delay tolerance of data applications, together with bursty traffic characteristics, open up the possibility for scheduling transmissions so as to optimize throughput by exploiting the variation in the channel conditions. TDD-CDMA scheme is one of the schemes adopted in the 3G communication system. TDD-CDMA combines the TDMA and CDMA technologies which inherit their own advantages, such as, the high
75

intra-cell cap acity of T D M A an d th e inter-cell interference suppression ability of CDM A.

76

M oreover, we can em ploy some scheduling algorithm s in the TD D -C D M A system to im prove th e perform ance of th e high speed d a ta services based on several perform ance criteria. T h e H D R scheduling algorithm was designed for the downlink transm ission w ithin w hich th e system schedules transm ission to a mobile user th a t has th e strongest signal levels. T h e H D R algorithm satisfies fairness property known as proportional fairn ess and was a d o p ted in th e 3G variation by some standards. However, there are some disadvan tages. For exam ple, th e use of m axim um power increases th e interference to users in th e neighboring cell (especially, the users located near the border). M eanwhile, tra n sm ittin g d a ta to th e users w hich are located closer to base statio n w ith full transm ission power can usually get m uch higher d a ta ra te th a n th e m axim um rate of the system . Hence, th ere are som e H D R-like algorithm s proposed in order to achieve different kind of perform ance in accordance w ith th e different criteria, such as priority, channel condition or m axim um achievable rate. T h e " HD R-like" scheduling algorithm s are based on th e original H D R schem e p roposed by Q ualcom m w ith th e feature th a t, in any tim e slot, only a subset of users are scheduled for transm ission based on some criteria. For th e dow nlink transm ission, th e m ajor interference comes from the neighboring base statio n s. Especially, w hen users are located near the border of the cells, th ey re ceive stro n g er interference power. Currently, to our knowledge, there is not a HDR-like scheduling alg o rith m w hich combines th e coordination of transm issions and th e power allo catio n alg o rithm s for dow nlink transm ission in the cellular com m unication system . Hence, we proposed a new scheduling scheme- Coordinated Location-based Dovnilink Scheduling Schem e (CLD SS). T h e m otivation of th e proposed scheme is to exploit th e tim e varying channel a n d to lim it th e interference from th e neighboring base stations. In th e CLDSS schem e, th e system chooses one user to be tran sm itte d a t one tim e slot in one cell. A cell is divided into tw o flexible co-centric areas based on th e traffic load in th e cell. We involve a pow er a d ju stm e n t factor which is a function of the locations of th e two areas,

77

as ip = {d /D y . The base station allocates full power (P) to the users located in the outer area, as well, allocates lower power {(pP) to the users located in the inner area. The transmissions are coordinated with the transmissions in the neighborhood. That is, when a base station transmits data to a user that is located in the inner area, the neighboring base station has to choose a user who is located in the outer area of its home cell and vice versa. The system assigns the number of time slots to the users in the inner and outer areas based on the user distribution. In other words, if there are more users located in the inner area, then the system allocates more time slots to the inner area. Since the CLDSS scheme can control the allocation of the radio signal power and coordinate the transmissions between cells, the scheme is useful to restrain the interference. When we transmit data to the user in the inner area, generally, with better channel condition, we use lower signal power to reduce the co-channel interference to the user of the neighboring cells. On the other hand, when we transmit data to the user located in the outer area with full power, the neighboring base station chooses the user located in its inner area and transmits data with lower signal power in accordance with the coordinated scheme. Therefore, the neighboring interference is lower, which is useful to improve the signalto-noise ratio. As a result, the data rate for the user located in the outer area can be compensated. Prom the results of the numerical analysis and simulation studies, we showed th at the CLDSS scheme can increase the throughput of the system when we set the normalized distance of the inner area {d*) to be less than some ''key point". And the CLDSS scheme can improve the fairness and make the system to have "soft throughput" , especially, when more users are located near the border of the cells. In addition, when we choose the users in the two areas with different methods based on different performance criteria, the CLDSS scheme can meet the different requirements, such as, ( 1 ) Random selection-which is useful to improve the fairness for the users in the cell and the control is simple; (2 ) Best-Channel-First selection- which is useful to improve the throughput of the system.

78

Since th e CLDSS schem e can coordinate the transm issions in th e cellular system , it can im prove th e perform ance of th e system . However, there is room to m odify th e proposed C LDSS schem e, because th e original CLDSS scheme ju s t considered two-cell system b o th in analysis an d sim ulation which is relatively simple. In th e future, we plan to consum m ate th e C LD SS schem e from two facets: one is to increase th e levels of co-centric areas; the o th er one is to increase th e num ber of cells to m ate it a real cellular system . Sim ilarly, th e cell is divided by several co-concentric areas based on th e traffic load of th e system . T h e fu tu re m odel of th e modified CLDSS scheme is shown as Fig. 7.1.

F igu re 7.1: The Model for the Future Work. W e cre ate a power a d ju stm en t factor to build up a pool of radio signal powers. T he pow er a d ju stm e n t ip can be set as: (d ^

(7.1)

w here i is th e level of co-centric area, i.e., i -- 1 , 2 , ...,n . di is th e distance betw een the edge of th e i level of co-centric area and th e base statio n . D is th e distance betw een the

79

edge of the cell and the base station. Because ^p can not be too small, otherwise, the radio signal power with ipP is too small to transmit to data. Hence, we set 1 < m < 2. After a base station chooses a user, it will choose a radio signal power from the power pool to transmit data based on the location of the user. In the meantime, the cells of the system will coordinate their transmissions. In general, when a base station transmits data to a user located near the border of cells, the neighboring base station should avoid to transmit any data to any user who is located near the other scheduled user.
