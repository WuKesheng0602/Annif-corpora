ABSTRACT
A parametric study was conducted, using the finite-element method, to study the load distribution characteristics o f curved composite I-girder bridges under truck loading. The influence o f several geometric parameters on the moment, and deflection distribution factors, as well as warping stresses in straight and curved composite I-girder bridges was examined. For straight bridges, the moment distribution factors were correlated with those specified in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code of 2000, CHBDC. Also, the magnitudes o f warping stresses in the steel bottom flanges were correlated with the specified limits in bridge codes. The results showed that the CHBDC moment distribution factors significantly overestimate the structural response o f straight bridges considered in this study. It was also observed that the curvature limitation specified in the CHBDC to treat a curved bridge o f low curvature as a straight one underestimate the structural response.

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION

1.1,

General
In structural design, it is necessary to obtain an appropriate geometric shape for the

structure so that it can safely and economically carry the loads imposed on it. Nowadays, horizontally curved bridges became an important component in urban bridges, especially where tight geometric restrictions are encountered. Curved bridges allow for smooth traffic flow and create a painless directional transition at interchanges. This directly results in fewer traffic jams, less air pollution due to idle-car emissions, and less road rage. Due to its increasing use in modem highways, the impact o f curved bridges, both socially and economically, is cause for the intense research, which has been performed in previous years. Increasing complex interchanges and the desire to conform to existing terrain have made curved steel I-girder bridges the preferred choice because o f its simplicity o f fabrication and construction, fast speed o f erection and excellent serviceability performance. These bridges are mostly located on and off ramps and characterized by complex vertical and horizontal geometries.

Generally, bridges can be constructed entirely from reinforced concrete, pre stressed concrete, steel, or composite concrete deck-steel girders. These bridges m ay be comprised o f a concrete slab deck or steel deck on concrete or steel box girders or Igirders. In the case o f curved steel plate girders, as shown in Figure 1. 1, there are two fabrication methods that are usually employed. The first method involves cutting curved

flanges from straight plates to the required curvature and then welding them on the m echanically bent plates or webs, which are curved. The second method involves préfabrication o f straight webs followed by either cold bending or heat curving in which a straight girder is curved to the stipulated radius by applying heat to the edges o f the flanges to achieve the required curvature. This actual curving o f girders has allowed

m ore aesthetically pleasing structures than straight girders used as chords in forming a curved alignment. Figure 1.2 shows a typical cross-section o f a four-girder bridge. It consists o f concrete deck slab supported over steel 1-girders. Cross-bracings as well as top and bottom chords are used at equal intervals between bridge support lines to stabilize the girders during construction and enhance its structural integrity.

1.2.

The Problem
Although horizontally curved steel bridges constitute roughly one third (Zureick and Naqib 1999) o f all steel bridges, the structural behavior is still not well understood. Based on the literature review, the investigation o f the load distribution characteristics o f such bridges is needed. Currently, the Canadian H ighw ay Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2000) recognizes plan curvature as a factor affecting the structural behaviour o f bridges. The North American Codes o f Practice (AASHTO-LRFD, 2004; AASHTO, 1996) specify load distribution factor equations for the design o f straight composite 1-girder bridges and provide a geom etrically defined criterion when horizontally curved bridges may be treated as straight bridges. In both cases, there is no practical design method in the form

o f expressions for moment and deflection distribution factor for com posite concrete-steel I-girder bridges with significant curved alignment. The AASHTO Guide Specifications for Horizontally Curved Bridges, (Guide, 2003), recommend few numerical and analytical methods for the analysis o f such bridges. Among them is the finite-element method. In practice, detailed finite-element method (FEM) is frequently employed for accurate results. Unfortunately, most engineers are not familiar with FEM procedure. The FEM procedure is quite time consuming, especially in preliminary design when girder dimensions are not known. Simplified formulas are desired to predict accurate live load distribution for curved bridges. Therefore, to meet the practical requirements arising during the design process, a simple design method is needed for curved composite I-girder bridges in the form o f load distribution factors for bending stresses, warping stresses and girder deflection to fill the gaps found in bridge codes.

1.3

The objectives o f this study are: 1. To identify the key parameters that influence the lateral distribution o f loads in curved composite concrete deck-over steel I-girder bridges. 2.

LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Concept o f Lateral Load Distribution Factor
Bridges are subjected to dead load and truck loading. The calculation o f dead load, in the ease o f straight bridges, is simple. The deck slab, wearing surface, and curbs o r traffic barriers can be considered to be distributed evenly am ong girders. Since curbs o r traffic b am ers are constructed after the concrete deck is cured, for better accuracy, these dead loads can also be considered as live load. For sure, this approach is not valid in the case o f horizontally curved bridges due to the torsion effects resulting from curvature.

To calculate the live load carried by each girder in the case o f a straight bridge, lateral load distribution factor is a key issue. For simplicity, a straight single girder and m ulti-girder bridge are used herein to introduce the concept o f lateral load distribution factor. Figure 2.1a show s the free body diagram o f a straight single girder under live load P. C onsidering r\ (x) the influence line o f a certain section o f the girder, then the internal force at this section can be calculated as F = P x rj (x). This is a sim ple two-dim ensional problem since both the load and the girder deform ation is in the plane o f xoz. However, for m ulti-girder straight bridge subject to live load P, as shown in Figure 2.1b, the m echanism is totally different. Lateral rigidity m akes the live load P to distribute in the lateral direction (y direction) as well as in the longitudinal direction (x direction). Therefore, the live load on the bridge is shared am ong the girders. Each girder is

subjected to different magnitude o f the live load. The live load position and structural deformation are three-dimensional and consequently three-dimension approach is required to solve the internal forces of the structure. The common characteristic o f threedimension approach is that the internal forces and deformation at any point o f the structure can be solved directly.

Alternatively, the internal forces can be calculated using the influence surface, just like using the influence line to determine the internal forces in a single girder. Considering r|(x,y) the influence surface o f a certain section o f the structure under live load, the response o f the structure is then F=P x q (x,y). Since the live loads on the bridge are multiple concentrated wheel loads, which can move both longitudinally and transversely, using influence surface to determine the maximum internal forces will be tedious and complicated. Therefore, the influence surface method is not widely used in practice.

A frequently used method is to convert the complex three-dimensional problem (Figure 2.1b) into a simple two-dimensional problem (Figure 2.1a). The principle o f this method is to convert the two-variable influence surface function q (x,y) into the product o f two single-variable functions, that is, q (x,y) = q (x) x q (y). The internal force at the section is then F= P
X

q (x,y) = P X q (x)

X

q (y)

(2.1)

Where q (x) is the longitudinal influence line o f that section for a single girder (Figure
2 . 1a), q (y) is the live load distributed to one certain girder when a unit load moves

transversely across the bridge, t] (y) is referred to as the transverse influence line for that girder and P x x\ (y) is the load distributed to that girder w hen live load P is at point a(x,

y) (Figure 2.1b). Therefore, the internal forces at a certain section for a specific girder can
be determ ined using the longitudinal and transverse influence lines, which sim plifies the three-dim ensional problem.

In reality, actual truck loads are m ultiple wheel loads moving on the bridge. Figure 2.2a show s a m ulti-girder bridge subjected to truck loads. The rear, m iddle and front axle loads o f the truck are PI, P2 and P3, respectively. To determ ine the m axim um response at point k o f girder No. 3, for instance, the transverse influence line o f girder No. 3, and the w orst loading position to determ ine the m axim um m agnitude o f each axle load distributed to girder No. 3 are first obtained. Secondly, the m axim um response at section k o f girder No. 3 using the longitudinal single girder influence line at section k is determ ined. O bviously, if the positions o f the truck wheels on the bridge are fixed, the load distributed to girder No. 3 is fixed. In practice, the product o f a factor g and the axle load expresses this fixed value. Therefore, the loads distributed to girder No. 3 o f the rear, m iddle, and front truck axle loads can be expressed as g P l, gP2, and gP3, respectively, as show n in Figure 2.2b. The factor g is referred to as lateral load distribution factor. It show s that the m axim um load distributed to one certain girder (here is girder No. 3) is a fraction o f each axle load (usually less than one).

It should be noted, that it is an approxim ate approach to convert the threedim ensional problem into a two-dimensional problem, since the paths o f the load being

distributed to the adjacent girders are complex. The concentrated load at one girder would no longer be concentrated load at the same longitudinal position after being distributed to the adjacent girders. However, theoretical and experimental research (Yoo, 1990) showed that the error was relatively small for lateral load distribution. Moreover, the actual truck load on the bridge is not one single concentrated load, but several wheel loads distributed at different longitudinal positions. Therefore, the error would be even smaller for truck loading.

Obviously, the distribution factor g for each girder is different within the same bridge. It also varies with the variation o f truck configuration, truck longitudinal location on the bridge, and the bridge lateral rigidity. The effect o f truck longitudinal location is insignificant and usually the distribution factor at girder maximum response location is used for design. The bridge lateral rigidity is related to the relative stiffness o f the girders and the deck. The load distribution between girders is poor for transversely flexible bridges and is even for transversely stiff bridges. Figure 2.3 shows how the bridge girders in a cross section may deflect when subjected to applied load P. In this Figure, E I t is the bridge transverse or lateral rigidity. Figure 2.3a shows the deformation o f the bridge structure when the bridge transverse rigidity E Ij is zero and the middle girder is subjected to load P. Since the load can only transfer to the middle girder, the distribution factor g for the middle girder is one and for other girders is zero. However, when the bridge transverse rigidity is infinity and the same load P is applied at the middle girder position, every girder has the same deflection and the same magnitude o f the load. Therefore, the distribution factor g for every girder is MN, where N is the number o f girders^For a five-

girder bridge shown in Figure 2.3c, the distribution factor g is 0.2. For concrete, reinforced concrete, and steel girder bridges, the transverse rigidity is between zero and infinity. W hen the m iddle girder is subjected to a load P, as shown in Figure 2.3b, the distribution factor for each girder is between I /# and one. To determ ine the exact m agnitude o f the live load distributed to each girder is the key issue in bridge analysis and has been studied by m any researchers.

W ith the developm ent o f high speed and capacity computers, they can be used to accurately analyze the structures under dead and live loads. One w ay to estim ate the m axim um m om ent and shear response in individual bridge girder would be to m odel the entire bridge in three dim ensions using the finite element method (FEM ) or other analytical m ethods and determ ine the m om ent and shear in individual member. The loading is varied, both in longitudinal and transverse positions, to find the worst loading positions. For bridges w ith veiy com plex configurations, this method might be the only w ay to determ ine the accurate maximum m om ent and shear under live load for each girder. H ow ever, for m any types o f bridges, this process could be very cum bersom e and unnecessary. D istribution factors and empirical m ethods are still the main m ethods used in design o f m o d em bridges in N orth America. Empirical formulas were obtained by analyzing m any bridge systems. The procedure used in the developm ent o f curved girder distribution factors follow ed the same technique em ployed in determ ining the straight girder load distribution equations. To analysis o f a curved system is more com plicated than that o f a straight one. For this reason, available literature for both straight bridges and curved bridges are review ed in the following sections.

Review of Previous Research on Load Distribution
Review of Study on Distribution Factors for Straight Bridges
Based on the level o f bridge lateral rigidity, different methodologies are

employed in practice, including lever rule, eccentric compression method, hinged joint method, fixed joint method, orthotropic plate analogy, AASHTO Standard and AASHTO-LRFD methods.

2.2.1.1

Lever Rule Method (Yao 1990)
The lever rule is one o f the most frequently used methods for calculation

distribution factors. This method assumes that the deck between the girders acts as a simply supported beam or cantilever beam, as shown in Figure 2.4. In this case, the load on each girder shall be taken as the reaction o f the wheel loads. The lever rule method is very accurate for two girder bridges. The lever rule method can also be used for shear distribution near support, since the load would pass to the pier or abutment mostly through the adjacent two girders. When the bridge transverse stiffness is relatively flexible, lever rule can also give very good results. However, the results usually would be slightly conservative for the interior girders and unconservative for the exterior girders.

2.2.1.2

Eccentric Compression Method (Yao 1990)
This method can be applied to "Narrow Bridge" with adequate diaphragms along

bridge span. "Narrow Bridge" is defined as that the ratio of bridge width, B. to span length, L, is less than or equal to 0.5 satisfying the ratios of bridge longitudinal rigidity

11

per unit length, Dy, to transverse rigidity per unit width, Dy is greater than 0.48. The deflection o f a narrow bridge with adequate diaphragm s under truck load is sim ilar to that o f an eccentric com pression member, as shown in Figure 2.5. From the theory o f m echanics, when the girder k is subjected to a load P, the load distributed to girder / is: Ij

Therefore, the transverse influence line can be obtained from Equation 2.2 when load P is equal to one. If all the girders have the sam e cross section o r the same m om ent o f inertia, the control values o f the transverse influence line for girder No. 1 are simplified as (note that ai^as):

Hinged Joint Method (Yao 1990) Hinged Joint Method for Slab Bridges

This method can be used for slab bridges with pre-cast members connected by tongue-and-groove joint. The deflection of a slab bridge under concentrated wheel load is shown in Figure 2.6a. Figure 2.6b shows the general internal forces occurred at the tongue and groove joint, which are vertical shear g(x), transverse moment m(x), longitudinal shear t(x). and normal force n(x). Longitudinal shear t(x) and normal force

13

n(x) are relatively sm all com pared w ith vertical shear g{x) when the bridge is subjected to
truck load. Since the jo in t is relatively short in configuration and very flexible in resisting m om ent, the transverse m om ent m(x) as well as the longitudinal shear t(x) and normal force n(x) can be neglected in analysis. Therefore, the joint can be sim plified as a hinge, assum ing only vertical shear force g(x) exists, as shown in Figure 2.6c. To convert the three-dim ensional problem into a two-dim ensional problem, the ratio o f the deflection, m om ent, shear, and applied load, in any two strips or girders m ust be equal to a constant, that is,

Sinusoidal load is assum ed to m eet this requirem ent and the sinusoidal load is in the form of

7 C X F(x) = Po sin - j --

(2.7)

T he free body diagram o f a slab strip under sinusoidal load is shown in Figure 2.7. The error o f th e sinusoidal load assum ption is very small since along the bridge span there will be m any w heel loads. To obtain the distribution factor, the girder transverse influence line m ust be obtained first. For a bridge with n strips, an indeterm inate problem o f n-\ order is to be solved to obtain the influence line. For convenience, transverse influence line control values for bridges with 3 to TO slab strips are tabulated and the tables can be found in Bridge Engineering (Yao, 1990). After the transverse influence

14

line is obtained, trucks can then be arranged transversely across the bridge to find the worst situation and the maximum distribution factors.

2.2.1.3.2

Hinged Joint Method for T-Shaped Girder Bridge

The hinged joint method can also be used for small span concrete T-shaped girder bridges without intermediate diaphragms. Figures 2.8a and 2.8b show the free body diagrams o f unit length section at bridge middle span o f the hinged T-shaped girder bridge under unit sinusoidal load. Different from slab bridges, the deflection o f the Tshaped girder flanges must be considered, as shown in Figures 2.8c and 2.8d. W hen the cantilever length is within 0.80 m and the span length is greater than 10 m, the tables found in Bridge Engineering (Yao, 1990) for calculating transverse influence line values for hinged slab bridges can also be used for hinged girder bridges. For better accuracy, detailed calculation is required for bridges beyond this range.

2.2.1.4

Fixed Joint Girder method (Yao 1990)
When the lateral connection between girders is stiffer, the joint can be considered

as a fixed joint. In addition to shear force at the joint, moment must be considered, as shown in Figure 2.9. For an «-girder bridge, a 2(«-l) order of indeterminate problem is to be solved to obtain the shear and moment at each joint. However, only shearing force g, is considered for calculating distribution factor. Once g,- is known, the same procedure as in hinged joint method can be followed to obtain the transverse influence line as well as the distribution factors.

2.2.1.5

Orthotropic Plate Analogy (Guyon-Massonnet or G-M Method) (Yao 1990)
For concrete bridges w ith continuous slab and interm ediate diaphragms and with

the bridge w idth to span length ratio B/L greater than 0.5, grillage system may be used to sim ulate the bridge system. Or, the bridge m ay be analogized to a rectangular thin plate, which is called orthotropic plate analogy or Guyon-M assonnet (G-M ) method (Yao 1990). O rthotropic plate is referred to as a plate with the elastic properties different in x and y directions. Figure 2.10a shows the longitudinal and transverse configuration o f a bridge structure. In this case, the girder spacing is considered as S, girder m om ent o f inertia and torsional inertia are A and 7^, respectively, diaphragm spacing is S^, and diaphragm m om ent o f inertia and torsional inertia are /,, and /n, respectively. For very sm all values o f S and Sc compared to the bridge width and span length, and for fully com posite action, we can distribute girder moment o f inertia and torsional inertia /» and

and Ijy to the distance S^. Thus, the real grid system (Figure 2.10a) is analogized to an im aginary plate (Figure 2.10b). In Figure 2.10b, the thickness in the x direction is shown in dashed line, w hich indicates that, the equivalent thickness in the x and y direction are different for the analogized plate. The m oment o f inertia and torsional inertia per unit w idth in the x and y directions for the analogized plate are considered as follows:

For beam and slab concrete bridges and prestressed concrete bridges, Poisson's ratio V can be neglected for simplicity. In that case, the bridge can be analogized to an orthotropic plate with rigidity per unit width

which is identical to the differential equation for orthotropic plate (in material elastic properties). This means that analogized orthotropic (in configuration) plate can be solved the same way as orthotropic ( in material properties ) plate, except that that the stiffness constants contained in the equations are different.

The internal forces can be obtained by solving this equation for displacement w under applied load. Directly solving the partial differential equation is difficult. For. convenience, Guyon and Massonnet had developed solution charts, which can be found in Bridge Engineering (Yao 1990) and can be used to easily obtain the transverse influence line. Once the transverse influence line is obtained, the distribution factors can be obtained by arranging the trucks transversely on the bridge.

2.2.1.6

AASHTO Methods
Compared with the theoretical methods mentioned above, AASHTO empirical

methods are more convenient to use. AASHTO defines the distribution factor as the ratio o f the moment (or shear) obtained from the bridge system to the moment (or shear) obtained from a single girder loaded by one truck wheel line {AASHTO Standard 1996)

17

o r the axle loads {AASHTO-LRFD 2004). It should be noted that AA SH TO Standard Specifications and AASHTO LRFD Specifications define the live load differently. The live load in the Standard specifications consists o f an HS 20 truck or a lane load. W hile, the live load in the LRFD specifications consists o f an HS 20 truck in conjunction with a lane load. Since both trucks have a 1.8 m axle (gauge) width, it is assumed that the difference in the live load configuration does not affect the lateral load distribution.

2.2.1.6.1

AASHTO Standard Method (1996)

A A SH TO Standard specifications (1996) adopted the sim plified form ulas for distribution factors based on the work done in the 1940s by Newm ark (1948). The form ulas are in th e form at o f S/D, where S is the girder spacing in feet and D is a constant based on the bridge type. This method is applicable to straight and right (i.e. nonskewed) bridges only. It w as proved to be accurate when girder spacing was near 1.8m and span length w as about 18 m (Zokaie, 2000). For relatively m eduim or long bridges, these form ulas w ould lose accuracy.

2.2.1.6.2

AASHTO LRFD Method

D uring the past 20 years or so, structural design has been m oving toward a m ore rational and probability-based design procedure referred to as Load and Resistance Factor Design, (LRFD ). AASHTO LRFD Specifications have becom e m ore and more attractive for bridge engineers because o f its incentive perm itting the better and m ore economical use o f m aterials. The rationality o f LRFD and its m any advantages over the allowable stress design m ethods, ASD, are indicative that the design philosophy will relegate ASD

18

to the background in the next few years (Salmon and Johnson, 1996). AASHTO LRFD (1998) adopted the research results o f the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) 12-26 project, which was entitled "Distribution o f Live Loads on Highway Bridges" and initiated in 1985. More parameters, such as girder spacing, bridge length, slab thickness, girder longitudinal stiffness, and skew effect are considered in the developed formulas. The research results were first adopted by AASHTO Standards in 1994 and were then officially adopted by AASHTO-LRFD in 1998. The AASHTOLRFD formulas, evaluated by Shahawy and Huang (2001), showed good agreement with test results for bridges with two or more design lanes loaded, provided that girder spacing and deck overhang did not exceed 2.4 m and 0.9 m, respectively. Outside o f these ranges, the error could be as much as up to 30%. For one design lane loaded, the relative error was less than 10% for interior girders and could be as high as 100% and as low as -30% for exterior girders. Shahawy and Huang (2001) presented modification factors for the AASHTO LRFD formulas and the results o f the modified formulas showed good agreement with the test results.

2.2.1.7 Other Studies
Besides the AASHTO formulas, numerous papers have been published for load distribution factors since 1950. They are invaluable for further studies. Ko stem and DeCastro (1977) showed that the contribution o f diaphragms to lateral load distribution was marginal regardless o f the loading pattern. Hayes et al. (1986) developed a program, SALOD, to evaluate the lateral load distribution o f simple-span bridges in flexure. Span length was found to be an important parameter in calculating the distribution factor.

19

B akht and M oses (1988) presented a procedure to calculate the constant D in the A A SH TO load distribution formula {S/D). Tarshini and Frederick (1992), using FEM, studied the effect o f various param eters on wheel load distribution for I-girder highway bridges and found that com posite and non com posite construction showed a negligible effect; the effect o f the m ost common types o f channel diaphragm and cross bracing betw een beam s had negligible effect.

Review of Study on Distribution Factors for Curved Bridges
M any articles on curved bridges have been published in the literature as listed by

M cM anus et al. (1969), discussed by Ketchek (1969) and Pandit et al. (1970), and recently stated b y Zureick and Naqib (1999). However, valuable studies related to the analysis and design o f horizontally curved bridges began only in 1969 when the Federal H ighw ay A dm inistration (FHW A) o f the United States formed the Consortium o f U niversity Research Team s (CURT). This team consisted o f Carnegie M ellon University, U niversity o f Pennsylvania, University o f Rhode Island, and Syracuse University, whose research efforts, along with those at University o f M aryland, resulted in the initial developm ent o f w orking Stress Design (W SD) or Allowable Stress Design (ASD) criteria and tentative design specifications. The American Society o f Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the A A SH TO Task Com m ittee (1977) compiled the results o f most o f the research efforts prior to 1976 and presented a set o f recom m endations pertaining to the design o f curved I-girder bridges. The CU RT research activity was followed by the developm ent o f Load Factor D esign (LFD) criteria ( Stegmann and G alam bos 1976, Galam bos 1978) adopted by A A SH T O to go along with the ASD criteria. These provisions appeared in the first

20

Guide (1980) as well as the Guide (1993). Studies on curved bridges will be concluded in the following lines such as Heins and Siminou's study (1970), AASHTO Guide and its Commentary methods, AASHTO with V-load modification method, Heins and Jin 's method (1984), Brockenbrough's study (1986); Yoo and Littrell's study (1986), Davidson, Keller and Yoo's study (1996), Schelling, Namini, Fu's study (1989), Sennah, Eissa, and Lee's Study (2000) and Zhang's study (2002).

2.2.2.1

Heins and Siminou's Study (1970)
Heins and Siminou presented a series o f simplified equations, which perm it

evaluation o f internal forces and deformation in a single, two, and three-span curved girder system. These forces can then be utilized to estimate preliminary section properties, which are necessary in utilizing various computer programs. These studies, resulting in design equations, have the following limitations; 1. Girder spacing may be 2.1, 2 .4 , 1.1 ox 3 m. 2. Individual girder span lengths varied from 15 to 30m. 3. The girders o f the system must have a constant curvature and are limited to radii o f 30 to 180 m. 4. The number o f girders in the system may be 4, 6 or 8 . 5. Only two-and three-span continuous bridges were examined, with all interior end spans o f equal length. The main reason why the Heins-Siminou's result is too conservative is that the entire deck in the three-dimensional model was not included and the bridge centerline length in equations was used rather than the individual actual girder length.

AASHTO Methods AASHTO Guide Commentary Method

The Com m entary o f the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Highway Bridges o f 1993, (Guide, 1993), which adopted the research results o f Heins and Siminou (1970), gives the distribution factors for bending m om ent as: S f L -- g= -- ( N + 3) -- +0.7 5.5 4R where S = girder spacing in ft (7 ft < S <12 ft). (2.11)

R N = ------ ( R > 100 A), 100 L = span length in ft, and R = radius o f curvature in ft (R > 100ft). It should be noted that Equation 2.11 is analogous to AASHTO Standard equation S/D. This equation is intended to present the outside exterior girder m om ent distribution and w ould be increasingly conservative for other girders across the bridge. This method was om itted from the current version o f the AASHTO Guide (Guide, 2004)

2.2.2.2.2

AASHTO Guide Method

The equation specified in the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Horizontally C urved Bridges (1993) takes into account the effect o f lateral bracing, connecting the bottom flanges o f the girders. For both ASD and LRFD, the distribution factors, in terms o f the resulting m axim um live load (normal stress com ponent + warping stress com ponent) bottom flange stress in the girder, can be calculated as:

where, in equations 2.12 through 2.15, L is the outside exterior girder span length in feet, S is the girder spacing in feet, and R is the radius o f curvature o f the outside exterior girder in feet. The maximum live load flange stress is obtained by multiplying the distribution factor with the maximum stress based on grid analysis.

2.2.2.2.3

AASHTO with V-Load M odification M ethod

To equilibrate the torsional couple on the cross bracing, vertical shear forces (V) are developed at each end of the cross bracing as a result of cross-frame rigidity and fixity (Figure 2.11). These shear forces then react on the girders resulting in a set o f selfequilibrating girder shears. The net effect of the shears is to shift the total load on the curved bridge toward the outside girder. These girder shears, which are applied as the external loads to the equivalent straight structure to account for the curvature, are known as the V- loads. Application of the external V-loads ensures that the internal forces in the

23

straight structure be nearly the same as those that exist in the curved structure under applied vertical loads. In the V-Load analysis o f a system, the bending m om ents caused by th e applied vertical loads at the cross bracings in each isolated developed straight girder are first determ ined by applying the loads to straight girders. These verticalbending m om ents will hereafter be referred to as prim ary moments. The corresponding V -load m om ents, which are caused by the V-load and are referred to as secondary m om ent, are then determ ined by applying the V- loads in the proper directions to the straight girders at the cross bracings. The final moment in the curved girder are then obtained by sim ply sum m ing the respective straight-girder prim ary and secondary m om ents. T he V -load is calculated by (Grubb, 1984):

This method is referred to as the AASHTO with modified V-load Method. The results were proved to agree with those from the FEM analysis (Brockenbrough 1986) for exterior girder and to be conservative for the interior girders.

2.2.2.3

Heins and Jin's Method (1984)
Heins and Jin (1984) studied the effect o f cross bracing spacing on curved bridge

distribution factors and found the following relationship:

S r Sc L? g = -- 0.0083 -------------- + 1.0 5.5 L S R J Where Sc is the cross bracing spacing in feet.

(2.18)

This factor differs from the traditional factor in that it includes the effect o f the warping stresses. With warping included, the cross bracing is important and the relationship in Equation 2.18 shows good agreement with Brockenbrough's Study.

2.2.2.4

Brockenbrough's study (1986)
Brockenbrough (1986) studied the effects o f various parameters on load

distribution for only four girder-curved bridges using FEM. He found that (1) the central angle per span including the combined effect o f curvature and span length has larger effect; (2) girder spacing has larger effect; (3) cross bracing spacing has negligible effect; and (4) girder stiffness has relatively small effect on distribution factor. Brockenbrough also provided charts depicting the variation o f the distribution factors with the variation o f the parameters. These findings and the charts are valuable to examine load distribution factors in curved bridges. However, the charts are inconvenient to use in practice

2.2.2.5

Yoo and Littrell's Study (1986)
The response o f a system o f horizontally curved girders connected by a slab and

cross-bracings was evaluated (Yoo and Littrell, 1985), using the finite-clem ent method, for dead and line loads. In investigating the effects o f radius, length, and num ber o f braced intervals on curved system, empirical design equations were developed to predict the ratio of: ( 1) M axim um bending stress; (2) M axim um warping stress; (3) M axim um deck deflection for a curved bridge to corresponding param eters o f a straight bridge o f equal length. It was observed that m axim um bending stress and m axim um deck deflections stabilized with minimal bracing but warping stresses were sensitive to the num ber o f braced intervals. Therefore, an equation based on a com bination o f dead and live loads w as chosen to lim it allowable bracing spacing.

2.2.2.6

Davidson, Keller, and Yoo's Study (1996)
D avidson et al. (1996) used the fmite-element method to create detailed m odels o f

horizontally curved steel 1-girder bridges connected by cross-bracings. In investigating the effects o f different param eters on curved system, it was concluded that span length, radius o f curvature, flange width, and cross-bracing spacing have the greatest effect on the w arping-to-bending stress ratio. Based on this information, a regression analysis was perform ed to predict the effect o f these parameters on the warping-to-bending stress ratio. A n equation was developed from this regression analysis and proposed for prelim inary cross-fram e spacing design as follows: Rbf
Smax L - In (

where Sm« is the maximum bracing spacing in m, L is the span length in m, R is
the radius o f curvature in m, and bf is the flange width in mm.

Schelling, Namini, Fu's Study (1989)
The moment distribution factors for dead load at construction phase, considering the significance o f the spacing of cross-bracing and the presence o f horizontal bracings connecting the steel flanges, were obtained (Schelling et al, 1989) for twogirder, four, and six girders. Imperial equations were developed to determine the stresses in the lateral bracing system due to construction loads. The drawback o f these equations is that it can be used in conjunction with the results given by the two-dimensional grid analysis method. Also, the range of bridge spans considered in this study (36 m to 90) in not practical for slab-on-steel I-girder bridges.

2.2.2.8

Sennah, Eissa, and Lee's Study (2000)
In investigating the effect of different parameters on composite concrete deck-

steel I-girder bridges when shoring is not used at construction phase, Sennah et al. (2000) constructed a fmite-element model capable o f capturing the response after pouring, and before hardening of, the concrete deck slab. It was concluded that span length, radius o f curvature, number o f girders, and girder spacing have significant effect on the longitudinal bending moments carried by each steel girder. Empirical expressions were proposed for computing the moment distribution factors carried by outer, central, and inner steel girders due to construction loads.

2.2.2.9

Zhang's study (2002)
T he load distribution factors for curved steel I girder bridges w ere studied by

Zhang, 2002, using the fm ite-element method, when subjected to AASHTO truck loading. The param eters considered in the study were: Radius o f curvature; 45 to 450 m; G irder spacing; 1.8 to 5.0 m; Span length; 15 to 70 m; Slab thickness; 170 to 300 mm; Longitudinal stiffness; 32122 to 72226 cm'*; Torsional inertia; 772 to 3850 cm'*; N um ber o f girders; 3 to 7; D istance from centre o f exterior girder and inside edge o f traffic barrier; 0.3 to 1.5 m; Cross fram e spacing; 2 to 7 m; R atio o f girder stiffness to overall bridge stiffness; 0.1492 to 0.3882.

T h e study showed that radius o f curvature, girder spacing, and distance from centre o f exterior girder and inside edge o f traffic barrier, num ber o f girders or ratio o f girder stiffness to overall bridge stiffness had significant effect on the load distribution. Span length, slab thickness, and longitudinal stiffness had slight effect. Effect o f cross bracing spacing and girder torsional inertia could be neglected. Simplified formulas for positive m om ent, negative moment, and shear distribution factors for inside and outside exterior girders due to one-lane loading and m ultiple-lane loading were developed. It was found that the distribution factors o f outside exterior girder positive m om ent obtained

28

from AASHTO Guide Commentary method (1993) for multiple-lane loading were less
conservative compared with the results o f FEM analysis. However, the results obtained from AASHTO Guide Commentary were too conservative for other cases. AASHTOLRFD formulas for straight bridges led to either larger or smaller results when used for curved bridges. The Heins and Jin's formula was too conservative for all cases. The proposed formulas are recommended for preliminary design o f curved steel I-girder bridges. Since the formulas were calibrated by limited amount o f real bridges, the formulas would be most accurate when applied to bridges with similar restraints. For bridges beyond these application ranges or special recommended for more accurate results. cases, detailed analysis is

Review of Linear Elastic Behaviour of Curved I- Girder System
The behavior o f thin-walled members o f open cross-section under flexure and

torsion has been established for a long time and has been reviewed in many books on elementary mechanics. A recent comprehensive presentation o f the basic theory o f thinwalled beams, including flexure, torsion, distortion, and stress distribution, can be found in ` '^Analysis and Design o f Curved Steel Bridges" (Nakai and Yoo, 1988). In curved bridge, the curvature makes the cross bracings (or diaphragms) the primary members to resist torsional loads, which are of importance for curved bridge stability.

Correspondingly, cross bracings introduce restoring torques to the girders and therefore cause nonuniform torsions in the girders. The torsions are resisted in part by St.-Venant torsion and in part by warping torsion. The warping causes lateral bending moment o f the top and bottom flanges. The product o f the lateral flange moment and lever arm o f the

29

couple (less than girder depth) is often referred to as bim om ent (in the unit o f force x length^). This bim om ent causes twisting o f the curved girders about their longitudinal axes. For com pression flange, the axial flange force tends to accentuate curvature while the lateral flange bending moment tends to reduce it. However, the net effect is always to increase curvature o f the compression flange. For tension flange, the axial force tends to reduce the curvature and the lateral flange bending moment tends to increase it. The net effect can be either to increase or decrease the curvature o f the tension flange, depending on flange stress and stiffness.

Tw o approxim ate methods; AASHTO Guide (1993) and V-load method presented below , can be used to estim ate the flange lateral bending moment. M u t

Review of Methods of Analysis for Curved System
In the literature, six major methodologies have been applied in curved bridge

analysis as shown in the following subsections.

2.4.1

The V-Load method (Grubb 1984)
The V-Load method is a simplified approximate analysis method for curved open

girder bridges. It can be considered as a two-step process. First, equivalent straight girders with span lengths equal to the arc lengths instead o f the individual curved girders are used so that the applied vertical loads are assumed to induce only longitudinal girder stresses. Next, self-equilibrating external vertical shear forces (acting on diaphragm location) are applied to the straight structure so that the resulting internal forces are the same as those that exist in the curved structure subjected to only vertical load (refer to Figure 2.11). Thus, in the V-Load development, the curvature forces on the equivalent straight structure are treated as externally applied load. These loads are dependent on the radius o f curvature, the bridge width, and diaphragm spacing (refer to Equation 2.16). The V-load method was found suitable for approximate analysis o f composite sections, variable radius o f curvature, and skewed supports. The effects o f bracing in the plane o f the bottom flange are not considered. The dead load results obtained from the V-load method were proved to be very close to those obtained from the FEM analysis. For live

33

load, the lateral load distribution factor used in the V-load analysis has a significant influence on the results.

2.4.2

Finite Strip Method (FSM)
This approach divides the curved bridge into many narrow strips in the

circum ferential direction that are supported in their radial direction. Bending, m em brane action, warping, and distortional effect, are considered in the analysis. This m ethod has been successfully used to analyze composite curved box/plate girders with com plete and incom plete interaction using curved strip elements for the concrete slab and steel girder and spring elem ents for the shear connectors (Arizumi al et. 1982). Since only one single variable in the circum ferential direction is considered in the function, the analysis requires sm aller num ber o f unknowns and provides some sim plicity and economy over FEM . It is difficult to apply this method for continuous bridges with diaphragms since it lacks flexibility and versatility
\

2.4.3

Finite Difference Method
In this m ethod, a grid is superimposed on the structure and the governing

differential equations are replaced by algebraic difference equations that are solved for each grid point. This m ethod was used in dynam ic analysis for curved bridges with large deflections and small rotations (Tene al et. 1975; Sheinman 1982).

34

2.4.4

Analytical Solution to Differential Equations
An analytical solution to the Governing Differential Equations (ODE) is obtained in

the method. The solution is usually a closed form or a convergent series solution, such as a Fourier series. This method was used in studying eurved bridge dynamie response (Culver 1969; Montalvao e Silva and Urgueira 1988).

2.4.5

Slope Deflection Method
The partial differential equations are established in terms o f slope-deflection

equations, and the solution is assumed to be a Fourier series. The analysis includes the effeets o f eurvature, nonuniform torsion, and diaphragms. The COBRA (Curved Orthotropie Bridge Analysis) program (Bell and Heins 1969), developed at the University o f Maryland, is based on analytical techniques of the slop-deflection Fourier series and is recommended by the eurrent AASHTO Guide Speeifieations of 1993 to study eomposite or noncomposite girder-slab action. This method was proved by experiment to be an aecurate analytieal method o f curved orthotropic deck bridge systems (Heins and Bell 1972).

2.4.6

Finite Element Method (FEM)
This numerieal method discretizes the structure into small divisions, or elements,

where each element is defined by a specified number o f nodes. The behavior o f eaeh element, and ultimately the strueture, is assumed to be a function of its nodal quantities (displacements), which serve as the primary unknowns in the formula. This is one o f the most general and aecurate methods to use, since it does not put any limitation on the geometry, loads, or boundary conditions. This method ean be applied to any shape o f girders

35

for static or dynam ic analysis. Also, the structure's response can always be improved by refining the mesh. Two m ajor categories o f the finite element models can be classified; approxim ate and refined methods. Approximate methods require a minimal modeling effort on part o f the designer, and therefore, are adequate for preliminary analysis and design purpose. Plane grid and space frame are the most frequently used approximate methods. Refined methods, on the other hand, are somewhat more elaborate, computationally intensive, and tim e-consum ing terms o f modeling. Refined methods usually are used for final or detailed analysis. Three-dimensional plate/shell is the most frequently used element.

2.4.6.1

Plane-Grid or Grillage Approach
This m ethod models the structure as an assemblage o f one-dimensional grid

m em bers w ith four degrees o f freedom (DOF) at each node. In a curved steel I-grid bridge system, the two translational displacements in the plane o f curvature o f the bridge and the rotational displacement about the axis perpendicular to the plane o f curvature are small com pared to the out-of plane displacements and thus may be neglected. This is the basic assum ption o f grillage method, which assumes four DOF at each node, including a warping degree o f freedom. The CURVBRG computer program (Mondkar and Powell 1974), developed by University o f California at Berkeley, and the CUGAR2 computer programs (Tavelle at el. 1971; Tavelle and Tasks 1975a,b), developed at the University o f Rhode Island, w ere proved to be very accurate m analyzing curved bridges and are recommended by the current Guide Specifications. Plane grid model is considered the most appropriate approach for practical analysis of open girder bridges. A major advantage o f plane gnd analysis is that shear and moment values o f girders are directly obtained and integration o f

36

stresses is not needed. When loads are applied between nodal points, the simple beam theoiy
can be used to distribute wheel loads to adjacent nodes. With a plane gnd idealization, the computer running time is reasonably short and only moderate effort is required for modeling. The disadvantages are: a) the method is nonrigorous and does not exactly converge to the exact solution of the mathematical model; b) obtaining good solutions requires some experience with the grillage method; and c) the assignment o f the cross section properties requires some discretion.

2.4.Ô.2

Space-Frame Approach
This method idealized the curved members as three-dimensional straight members,

while the diaphragms and lateral bracing are assumed as truss members that can carry only axial loads. The Three-Dimensional Analysis program (Brennan and Mandel 1973) developed at Syracuse University is recommended for this type o f analysis by the current

Guide Specifications.

2.4.Ô.3

Three-Dimensional plate/shell Approach
The STACRE (Shore and Wilson 1973) computer program developed at the

University o f Pennsylvania is characterized by a fully compatible three-dimensional flat plate circular element. A lot o f different elements and shape functions have been studied since then, including using segmental and quadrilateral element for plate bending, annular conforming and fully compatible four-noded segment element for thin plates, horizontally curved three-noded isoparametric beam element, three-dimensional beam element with axial and transverse displacements or arbitrary polynomial order, and so on. General finite

and

M SC/NA STRA N are also frequently used for curved bridges. The high-speed and capacity com puter allows three-dimensional modeling to be possible. The bridge deck is usually m odeled as shell element, including membrane and bending effects. Girder flanges are usually m odeled as beam elements to include axial and bending strains in two directions and torsional effects. Girder web can be modeled as shell element to account for the bending stif&iess. Rigid beams are usually used to connect the deck slab to girder flange and

sim ulate the com posite action with slab. Cross bracings and wind bracings can be modeled as hinged bar element. Three-dimensional plate/shell models can consider unusual geometry and complex configuration and can get the most accurate results. The disadvantages are: a) since most o f the program s do not allow loads to be placed at any point on the elements, equivalent nodal loads m ust be calculated with care and the mesh must be fine enough to minimize errors that m ay arise because o f load approximations; b) since the programs report stresses and strains other than shear and moment values, calculation o f shear and moment values from the stresses m ust be carefully performed through integration over the beam section, and c) integration o f stresses at node points is normally less accurate and may lead to inaccurate results.

CHAPTER III

FINITE-ELEMENT ANALYSIS

3.1

General
The Canadian Highway Bndge Design Code (CHBDC 2000) permits the use o f

six different refined methods o f analysis for short and medium span bridges. The finite element method is one o f the methods recognized by the CHBDC. It is also considered to be the most powerful, and versatile o f all the six permitted methods. The most important advantages o f the finite element method include: 1- It permits the combination o f various structural elements such as plates, beams, and shells. 2- It is able to analyze structures having arbitrary geometries with any material variations . Therefore, the fmite-element method is very suitable for the analysis o f curved composite I-girder bridges. Because o f recent development in computers, it is now possible to model a bridge in a very realistic manner and to provide a full description of its structural response within the elastic and post-plastic stages o f loading, using the fmite-element method.

This chapter includes descriptions o f modeling the different components o f the composite I-girder bridges. The finite-element model includes the reinforced concrete deck slab, top steel flanges, steel webs, bottom steel flange, and the cross-bracings as described in subsequent sections in this chapter. The finite-element program, SAP2000,

39

w as used throughout this study to exam ine the structural behaviour. A general description o f this program is presented later in this chapter. This chapter also explains the procedure to conduct an extensive parametric study on selected straight and curved bridge prototypes to study their load distnbution characteristics. T he sim ple presence o f curvature in curved girders causes nonuniform torsion and consequently, lateral bending moment (warping or biom om ent) in the flanges o f the girder m ust be considered, which greatly complicates the analysis and design o f the structure. Torque can be neglected in straight girders, whereas it plays an im portant part in curved bridge stability. At the end o f this chapter, the methodology to obtain the w arping-to-bending stress ratio for the bridges considered in this study is presented.

3.2

Finite-Element Approach
The finite-element method is a numerical method for solving problems in

engineering and mathematical physics.

In structural problems, the solution is typically

concerned with determining stresses and displacements and will yield approximate values o f the unknow ns at discrete number o f points in a continuum. This numerical method o f analysis starts by discretizing a model. Discretization is the process where a body is divided into an equivalent system o f smaller bodies or sub-regions (elements) interconnected at points (nodes) com m on to two or more elements and/or boundary lines and/or surfaces. These sub-regions can be in the form o f line elements, planar two-dimensional triangular, quadrilateral shaped elements, or three-dimensional solid shaped elements. An equation is then form ulated combining all the elements to obtain a solution for one whole body. Using a displacem ent formulation, the stiffness matrix o f each element is derived and the global

40

stiffness matrix o f the entire structure can be formulated by the direct stifi&iess method. This global stiffness matrix, along with the given displacement boundary conditions and applied loads, is then solved, thus that the displacements and stresses for the entire system are determined. The global stiffness matrix represents the nodal force-displacement

relationships and is expressed in a matrix equation form as follows;

[P ] -[ K ] [ U ]
where: [P] [K] [U] = = = nodal load vector; the global stifftiess matrix; the nodal displacement vector;

SAP2000 Computer Program
SAP2000 (Wilson, and Habibullah, 1999) is a structural analysis program that

employs the finite-element method and has a range o f capabilities depending on the version used. SAP2000 is also capable o f analyzing structures in static and/or dynamic modes. Its finite-element library consists o f six elements. 1- Three-dimensional FRAME element. 2- Three-dimensional SHELL element 3- Two-dimensional PLANE element 4- Two-dimensional SOLID element 5- Three-dimensional SOLID element 6- Three- dimensional NLLINK element In addition, subsets of these elements with varying degrees o f freedom are available in the form o f truss, frame, membrane, beam, strain, gap, and hook elements.

CHBDC Specifications For Truck Loading
The critical live load for the design of highway bridges in Canada consists o f a

specified truck and lane load. The live load specified in the new Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2000) was utilized in this study. Figure 3.1 shows a view o f CL-W truck loading as well as the CL-W lane load. The CL-W truck is an idealized five-axle truck. The number "W" indicates the gross load o f the CL-W truck in KN. Wheel and axle loads are shown in terms of W, and are also shown specifically for CL625 truck. The CL-W lane load consists of CL-W truck, with each axle load reduced to 80% o f the value, superimposed within a uniformly distributed load o f 9 KN/m, that is

43

3.0 m wide. Three different CHBDC truck loading configurations w ere considered, nam ely: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 truck, Figure 3.2 shows the configurations o f each o f these load levels. The Level 1; truck was used for bridges with span o f 15 m, while Level 2 : truck was considered in case o f 25-m-span bridges. Level 3: truck was applied to bridges o f 35-m span. In studying the m om ent and deflection distributions, the loading on the bridge prototype was applied in such a way to produce maxim um m id-span longitudinal stresses.

3.6

Loading Conditions
Considerations were given to the effects o f highway truck loads and bridge dead

loads on the distribution o f loads among girders. CHBDC specifies both the CL-625 truck load and CL-625 lane loading in bridge design, whichever gives the greatest design values. A sensitivity study on this regard showed that the CL-625 truck- load provides the design bending m om ent for a single girder o f 15, 25 or 35 m span. As a result, the CL625 lane loading was not considered in this study. The design o f bridge superstructure based on the CH BD C is characterized by three limit states, namely: (i) the ultim ate limit state, (i) the serviceability limit state, and (iii) the fatigue limit state. As such, loading conditions considered herein include dead load case and truck loading case for each o f the three lim it states o f design. According to CHBDC, for the fatigue limit state, the traffic load shall be one truck, placed at centre o f one travelled lane. Since the bridge configurations considered in this study include one-lane, two-lane, three-lane and fourlane bridges, four different sets o f loading cases were considered in this study. Figures 3.3, 3.4; 3.5 and 3.6 show schematic diagrams o f the loading cases considered for flexural

44

design o f the exterior girder, internal girder and middle girders. It should be noted that the exterior girder here is the one far away from the centre o f curvature and the internal girder is the closest girder to the centre of eurvature.

As an example o f the loading eases, the diagrams shown in Figure 3 .# w ill be explained herein. Loading ease ( 1) was always the dead load o f the strueture. For the

exterior girder, two truck loading cases were eonsidered. Load ease (2) ineluded a truck load located in the outer lane far away from the eentre o f eurvature, on which the outer wheel load was located 0.6 m from the barrier. Load ease (3) included two trucks one in each lane with the outer wheel load located 0.6 m from the barrier for the first truck and 0.6 m from the outer edge o f the inner lane for the second truck. Load case (4) was intended to provide the maximum load on the middle girder, which is at or very close to the centroid o f the bridge eross-seetion. In this ease one truck was considered in each lane and loeated as shown in Figure 3.4. Load case (5) was intended to provide the m axim um moment in the internal girder. It was similar to load case (2) for the exterior girder. Load cases (6) and (7) were intended to provide the maximum moment in the girders for fatigue design. In this case, CDBHC specifies only a truck load located at the centre o f the actual lane.

3.7

I-Girder Bridge Configurations
192 bridge configurations were considered for fmite-element analysis in the

parametric study. The span lengths (L) o f the bridges were taken 15, 25, and 35 m. The spacing o f the girders (S) was taken as 2, 2.5, and 3 m. The number o f girders (N) was

45

considered as 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 for girder spacing o f 2 m; 6, 5, 4, 3 for girder spacing o f 2.5 m, and 5, 4, 3 for girder spacing o f 3 m. The decision to choose these numbers o f girders w as based on the range o f bridge width for num ber o f lanes ranging from 1 to 4 as specified in the CH BDC (see table 3.1). For 15-m-span bridges, the span-to-radius o f curvature ratio (L/R) was taken 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. W hile for 25-m-span bridges, it was taken as 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5. For 35m span bridges, L/R was considered as 0, 0.1, 0.4, and 0.7. The overhang slab length was taken half o f the girder spacing. The thickness o f the deck slab was taken as 225 mm. The width o f the deck (Wc) was taken equal to the bridge w idth m inus 1 m to allow for two parapets o f 0.50 m thickness on each side o f the bridge. T he depth o f the girder webs was taken 1/20 o f the centre line span and their thickness w as 16mm. The w idth o f the bottom and top steel flanges were taken 300 mm, with 20 m m thickness. Figure 3.7 shows details o f the typical steel girder cross-section dim ensions used in this study.

A ccording to CHBDC, deck widths, ranging between 10 and 13.5 m, should be designed for both 2 and 3 design lane configurations. Table 3.1 shows details o f bridge cross-section dim ensions and the associated num ber o f design lanes per the CHBDC specifications. Figures 3.7 shows typical cross-section o f the com posite 1-girder bridge w ith exterior girder far away from the centre o f curvature and internal girder, the closest to the center o f curvature. X-type bracings with top and bottom chords were considered at equal intervals between the support lines and were made o f single angles

(L 150xl50x25m m ) o f 0.0075 m^ cross-sectional area. They were typically spaced at intervals based on equation 2.19, developed by Davidson et al. (1996). It should be noted

46

that this equation was developed to limit the warping-to-bending stress ratio to 0.25 in case o f noncomposite steel girders subjected to construction loads. Figure 3.8 shows typical plan o f a straight bridge with transverse bracings and a curved bridge with radial bracings. The shear connecters were considered of M22 studs. The study was based on the following assumptions: 1. the reinforced concrete slab deck had complete composite action with the top steel flange o f the girders ( 100% shear interaction); 2. the bridges were simply-supported; 3. all materials were elastic and homogenous; 4. the effect o f road superelevation, and curbs were ignored; 5. bridges had constant radii o f curvature between support lines. The modulus o f elasticity o f concrete material was taken 28 GPa with Poisson's ratio o f 0.20 while they were 200 GPa and 0.30, respectively, for steel material.

Finite-Element Modeling of Composite I-Girder Bridges
Geometric Modeling
A three-dimensional finite-element model was used to analyze all composite

bridges included. The structure was divided into a concrete deck slab, steel top flanges, steel webs, steel bottom flange and cross bracing. Concrete slab bridges, upper flanges, lower flanges and webs were modeled using four-node shell elements with six degrees o f freedom at each node. Cross bracings with top and bottom chords were modeled as frame elements, pinned at both ends. Based on previous work on finite element modeling, four vertical elements were used in each web, four elements between webs were used

47

horizontally for the concrete slab; two elements were used horizontally for the overhang slab; and for the upper and low er steel flanges. 72 elem ents in the longitudinal direction w ere considered. One row o f shell elements o f 0.000774 m thickness was considered to sim ulate com posite action between the deck and upper flange. Figure 3.9 shows a finite elem ent discretization o f a four-girder cross-section. Figure 3.10a shows view o f the SA P2000 finite-elem ent model o f a curved bridge with the concrete deck slab. W hile Figure 3.10b shows a sim ilar view but without the concrete deck slab.

To sim ulate and verify the full composite action between the deck, and upper flange, a sensitivity study on one o f the bridges described in Table 3.1 was performed. A straight bridge o f 35-m span, with number o f girders, N, equal to 7, and girder spacing, S, equal to 2 m, was analyzed in this study. Then, a 2000 KN concentrated load per girder, was applied at the m id-span o f the seven girders. The bridge was first analysed, using the finite-elem ent m ethod, for a case representing the M22 studs o f 0.5 m spacing as frame elem ents and for a case representing the M22 studs as shell elem ent with the equivalent area,( A ppendix E). The results, that were verified m anually using the flexural beam theory, show ed the same mid-span stresses, 640,000 KN/m^, in the bottom steel flange fibres for all girders in both m odeling configurations. W hile the mid-span deflection o f the girders w hen m odeling the studs as frame elem ent (0.197 m) was less than the corresponding deflection when modeling the studs as shell elements (0.235 m). However, the latter agrees w ith the manual calculation o f deflection using the flexural beam theory.

48

3.8.2

Boundary Conditions In modelling bridge support conditions, the lower nodes o f the web at its two ends

were restrained against translation to simulate temperature-free bridge superstructure. The most-internal support point, close to the centre of curvature, at the left end o f the bridge, was restrained from moving in all directions, while the most-internal support point at the right end o f the bridge was restrained from moving vertically and in the transverse direction of the bridge or normal to the chord line passing between the left and the right end o f the bridge. All other support points were restrained in the vertical direction only. Samples o f the resulting input files are given in Appendices A and B. The individual steps involved in creating input data files are outlined in the SAP2000 Users Manual (W ilson and Habibullah).

From the finite-element modeling, the maximum longitudinal stresses along the bottom flange for fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, fatigue loading case, and dead load; were determined. Then, the moment distribution factors, M DF, w ere calculated from the following relationships for the exterior, interior and m iddle girders as followst-

3.10 Calculation of Deflection Distribution Factors
In order to determ ine the deflection distribution factor (DDF) for curved girder, the m id-span deflection, (Asjmpie)iruck, (AsimpieloL, were calculated for a straight sim ply supported girder subjected to CHBDC truck loading, and dead loads, respectively. The span o f the straight sim ply supported girder is taken as the curved length o f the bridge centreline. The deflection values o f the idealized girder due to truck loading and dead load, w ere calculated using SAP2000 software, and then verified by manual calculations. Results o f these calculations are presented in Appendix C. From the finite-element m odeling, the m id-span deflection values at the m iddle o f the bottom flange for fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, fatigue-loading case, and dead load, were

determ ined. Then, the deflection distribution factors, (DDF), were calculated from the follow ing relationships, for the exterior, interior and m iddle girders as follows:-

3.11 Warping to-bending stress ratio
It is well established that curved 1-girders undergo a coupled lateral-bending moment in the top and bottom flanges due to curvature as shown in Figure 3.12. This lateral moment is called also: "torsional warping moment" or "bimoment", which induces

53

w arping o f the girder cross-section. The increase in longitudinal flexural stress in the flange due to this m om ent is called "warping stress". To exam ine the change in warping stress w ith the change in bridge configuration or loading cases, the ratio between warping stress to the average bending stress in the bottom flange is examined herein, and considered as: W BR = C Tw /C T b =CTi 0 3 /0 3

CHAPTER IV

PARAMETRIC STUDY
4.1 General
This chapter presents the results from the parametric study conducted on 192 simply supported straight and curved concrete slab-on-steel I-girder bridge prototypes, using the finite-element analysis method. The bridge prototypes were analyzed to evaluate their structural response when subjected to dead loading as well as the Canadian Highway Bridge Design truck loading, CHBDC truck. The parametric study included the investigation o f the following in simply supported straight and curved slab-on-girder bridges: (i) moment distribution among composite girders; (ii) deflection distribution among composite girders and; (iii) warping distribution in steel flanges. The key parameters considered in this study included span-to-radius o f curvature ratio (L/R), span length (L), number o f longitudinal girders (N), girder spacing (S), number o f cross bracing intervals between the support lines and loading conditions. Based on the results generated from this parametric study, a simplified design method is proposed for this type o f bridges when subjected to dead loading as well as CHBDC truck loading. Thus, the objectives o f this parametric study were to; 1. Investigate the influence of major parameters affecting the straining actions of composite I-girder bridges. 2. Generate a database for the maximum longitudinal stresses developed in the bridges due to the bending moment.

Moment distribution in simply supported curved bridges
Effect of curvature
The results o f the current parametric study revealed that curvature o f the bridge is

one o f the m ost significant parameters affecting the distribution o f moments between the longitudinal beams. Figures 4.1 to 4.4 show the change in the moment distribution factor for the exterior girder o f two-lane four-girder bridges with the increase o f the span-to-radius o f curvature ratio (L/R) due to dead load, fully-loaded lanes with truck loading, partiallyloaded lanes with truck loading and fatigue loading, respectively. Description o f these loading configurations is shown in Figure 3.4. It can be observed that the moment distribution factor for the exterior girder increases with increase in span-to-radius o f curvature ratio. For example, the moment distribution factor o f 15-m-span bridge increases from 1.0 for L/R = 0 (straight bridge type) to 1.88 for L/R = 0.3. Thus, the exterior girder bending m om ent increases by 88% as a result o f curvature. Also, it can be noticed that the rate o f increase o f the moment distribution factor generally increases with increase in span length. Figures 4.5 to 4.7 show similar relationships for the middle girder due to dead loading, fully-loaded lanes and fatigue loading. These relationships are similar to those for the exterior girder. Figures 4.8 to 4.11 present the relationships between moment distribution factors for the internal girder, the closest to the center o f curvature, due to dead load, fully-loaded lanes with truck loading, partially-loaded lanes with truck loading and fatigue loading, respectively. For 15-m-span bridges, it can be observed that the moment distribution factors for the internal girder increase with increase in span-to-radius o f curvature ratio, for dead load case (Figure 4.8), fully-loaded lane case (Figure 4.9) and fatigue loading case (Figure 4.11). However, in the case o f partially-loaded lane shown in
56

Figure 4.10, there is no observed trend with increase in curvature, the moment distribution factor seems fluctuating around the value for straight bridges. The latter observation may not affect the design o f such girder since the moment distribution factors obtained from fullyloaded lane case are always more than those obtained form the case o f partially-loaded lanes. With the increase o f span length from 15 m to 25 m, the trend observed is changed with the inerease o f curvature. It can be noticed that the moment distribution factor increases with the increase o f curvature up to a certain value o f L/R, after which the moment distribution factor decreases with the inerease in curvature. This may be attributed to the fact that there are two parameters affecting the moment distribution factor, the former is the inerease o f span-to-radius o f curvature ratio and the latter is the decrease of the span length o f the interior girder. For low curvature, it appears that the increase in curvature dominates the decrease in span length, but with the inerease in curvature, the situation is reversed.

It should be noted that the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code o f 2000 (CHBDC, 2000) states that curved bridges may be treated as straight bridges in structural design i f L^/bR is less or equal I, where L is the curved span o f bridge centre line, b is half the bridge width and R is the radius of curvature. Applying this provision to the curved bridges considered in this study, the limiting value o f L/R is 0.33 in case o f 15-m span, 0.20 in case o f 25-m span and 0.143 in case o f 35-m span. Applying these limiting values to Figures 4.1 to 4.11 shows that this specified limiting value underestimates the moment distribution factors for the external, middle and internal girders of curved system o f two-lane cross-section. To provide more confidence o f this finding, sensitivity study was conducted on different bridge configurations, shown in Table 4.1. This includes

57

considering num ber o f girders as 3, 4, 5, and 6, num ber o f lanes as 1, 2, 3 and 4 and span lengths as 15, 25 and 35 m. Two cases o f loading were considered for the exterior girder, nam ely: dead load and fully-loaded lanes with truck loading. The lim itations provided by other N orth Am erican codes (AASHTO Guide, 2003; AASHTO-LRFD, 2004) to treat a curved bridge as a straight one in the structural design were also included in the sensitivity study. The AASHTO Guide Specifications for Horizontally Curved Bridges state that a curved bridge can be designed as a straight one if the span-to-radius o f curvature ratio is less than 0.06. While, the AASHTO-LRFD Specifications state that a curved bridge can be treated as a straight one in structural design if the central angle is less than 3° for bridge cross-section made o f three or four girders and 4° if the num ber o f girders is 5 or more. Table 4.1 presents the results from this sensitivity study for the m om ent distribution factors o f exterior girders due to dead load. W hile Table 4.2 shows curvature lim itations by North American Codes for the m om ent distribution factors o f exterior girders due to fully-loaded lanes with truck loading. It is evident from the results presented in these tables that the limitation specified in the AASHTO G uide o f 2003 is the m ost applicable one to simply-supported com posite concrete slab-on-steel girder bridges.

4.2.2

Effect of span length
Figures 4.12 and 4.13 show selected results for the effect o f bridge span length on

the m om ent distribution factors for the external girders o f two-lane four-girder bridges due to dead load and fully-loaded lanes, respectively. It can be observed that the effect o f the span length on the moment distribution factor is insignificant for straight bridges with

58

L/R=0 . Similar behaviour was observed in the case of the middle girder o f straight bridges. However, for curved bridges, the moment distribution factor of the exterior girder is observed to increase with the increase in span length as shown in Figures 4.12 and 4.13. As an example, the moment distribution factor of the exterior girder, in a two-lane four-girder bridges full-loaded with truck loading, increases from 1.75 to 2.12 when the bridge span increases from 15 to 25 m.

4.2.3

Effect of number of longitudinal girders
To study the effect of number o f girders on the moment distribution factors, a bridge

with 2.5-m girder spacing and 25-m span length is considered. Figures 4.14, 4.15, 4.16 and 4.17 show the effect o f number of longitudinal girders on the moment distribution factors due to dead load, fully-loaded lanes, partially-loaded lanes and fatigue loading cases, respectively. Generally, in the case of dead load, there is insignificant change in the moment distribution factor with the increase in number of girders. However, in the case o f fully loaded lanes and fatigue loading, it can be observed that the moment distribution factor increases with the increase o f number o f girders untill reaching a peak point at the number o f longitudinal girders o f 5. Nevertheless, in the case of parti ally-loaded lanes, the moment distribution factor is observed to increase with the increase in the number o f girders. Figures 4.18 to 4.20 present the relationship between number of girders and moment distribution factors for the middle girder due to dead load, fully-loaded lanes and fatigue loading cases, respectively. While Figures 4.21 and 4.22 show the effect o f number o f girders on moment distribution factor o f the internal girder due to the cases of dead load and fully-loaded lanes.

59

respectively. No general trend is the observed in case o f the middle girder and internal girder, as compared to that o f the external girder.

4.2.4

Effect of spacing of girders
Figures 4.23 to 4.25 show the effect o f the spacing o f longitudinal girders on the

m om ent distribution factors for the exterior girder o f two-lane curved bridges o f 25-m span and num ber o f longitudinal girders of 4 due to dead load, fully-loaded lanes and partiallyloaded lanes, respectively. Generally, it can be observed that the moment distribution factor for the external girder increases with the increase in girder spacing for live load and fatigue case, w hile it is almost unchanged with the increase in girder spacing in case o f dead load. Sim ilar behaviour is observed in the case o f middle girder (Figure 4.26) and internal girder (Figure 4.27).

4.2.5

Effect of loading conditions
To examine the effect o f number o f loaded lanes on the moment distribution factors

o f the exterior or interior girders, two loading cases were considered, namely: fully-loaded lanes with truck loading and partially-loaded lanes with truck loading, as shown in Figures 3.3 through 3.6. Figures 4.28 to 4.30 present the moment distribution factors due to fullyloaded lanes against those due to partially-loaded lanes for 15-m, 25-m and 35-m span bridges, respectively. These plotted values are for all bridges irrespective on number lanes, num ber o f girders and girder spacing. Figures 4.31 to 4.33 show similar relationships but for the internal girder. It can be observed that the case o f partially-loaded lanes sometimes provides the design value for the moment distribution factor in spite o f the fact that the case

60

o f fully-loaded lanes has almost double the live load compared to that for partially-loadedlane case.

4.3
4,3.1

Deflection distribution in simply supported curved bridges
Effect of curvature
The results o f the current parametric study revealed that the curvature of the bridge

is one o f the most significant parameters affecting the distribution o f deflection between the longitudinal girders. Figures 4.34 through 4.44 examine the effect of curvature on the deflection distribution factors o f the exterior, middle and interior girders of two-lane curved bridges of 25-m span and 2.5-m spacing for the dead, live and fatigue loading cases shown in Figure 3.4. It can be observed that deflection distribution factors for the external and middle girders increase with the increase of span-to-radius of curvature ratio. On the other hand, it can be observed that there is no general trend regarding the effect of the curvature on the deflection distribution factor for interior girders. It can be noticed that the deflection distribution factor for the interior girder increases with the increase of curvature in case of dead load and fully-loaded lanes, while in the cases o f partially-loaded lanes and fatigue loading, this increase is observed to be up to a certain value o f L/R, after which the deflection distribution factor decreases with the increase in curvature. This may be attributed to the fact that there are two parameters affecting the deflection distribution factor, the former is the increase o f span-to-radius of curvature ratio and the latter is the decrease o f the span length o f the interior girder. For low curvature, it appears that the increase in curvature dominates the decrease in span length, but with increase in curvature, the situation is reversed.

61

It should be noted that the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code o f 2000 (CH B D C, 2000) states that curved bridges may be treated as straight bridges in structural design if L /bR is less or equal I, where L is the curved span o f bridge centre line, b is h a lf the bridge width and R is the radius o f curvature. Applying this provision to the curved bridges considered in this study, the limiting value o f L/R is 0.33 in case o f 15-m span, 0.20 in case o f 25-m span and 0.143 in case o f 35-m span. Applying these limiting values to Figures 4.34 to 4.44 shows that this specified limiting value underestim ates the deflection distribution factors for the external, m iddle and internal girders o f the curved system o f tw o-lane cross-section. To provide m ore confidence o f this finding, sensitivity study was conducted on different bridge configurations, shown in Table 4.3. This includes considering num ber o f girders as 3, 4, 5, and 6, num ber o f lanes as 1, 2, 3 and 4 and span lengths as 15, 25 and 35 m. Two cases o f loading were considered for the exterior girder, namely; dead load and fully-loaded lanes with truck loading. The lim itations provided by other North American codes (AASHTO Guide, 2003; AASHTOLRFD, 2004) to treat a curved bridge as a straight one in the structural design were also included in the sensitivity study. The AASHTO Guide Specifications for Horizontally Curved Bridges state that a curved bridge can be designed a straight one if the span-toradius o f curvature ratio is less than 0.06. While, the AASHTO-LRFD Specifications state that a curved bridge can be treated as a straight one in structural design if the central angle is less than 3° for bridge cross-section made o f three or four girders and 4° i f the num ber o f girders is 5 or more. Table 4.3 presents the results from this sensitivity study for the deflection distribution factors o f exterior girders due to dead load. W hile Table 4.4

62

shows curvature limitations by North American Codes for the deflection distribution factors o f exterior girders due to fully-loaded lanes with truck loading. It is evident from the results presented in there tables that the limitation specified in the AASHTO Guide o f 2003 is the most applicable one to simply-supported composite concrete slab-on-steel girder bridges.

4.3.2

Effect of span length
Figures 4.45 and 4.46 show selected results for the deflection distribution factors for

the external girder o f a two-lane four-girder bridge with 2.5 m spacing, with different span length and degree o f curvature. It can be observed that the effect o f the span length on the deflection distribution factor is insignificant for straight bridges, L/R = 0. However, for curved bridges, a slight change in the deflection distribution factor is observed with increase in span length.

4.3.3

Effect of number of longitudinal girders
To study the effect o f the number of girders on the deflection distribution factors, a

bridge with 2.5-m girder spacing and 25-m span length is considered. Figures 4.47 to 4.50 show the effect o f the number of longitudinal girders on the deflection distribution factors due to dead load, fully-loaded lanes, partially-loaded lanes and fatigue loading cases, respectively. Generally, in the case of dead load, there is an insignificant change in the deflection distribution factor with the increase in number of girders. However, in the case o f fully loaded lanes and fatigue loading, it can be observed that the deflection distribution factor increases with the increase of number of girders till reaching a peak point at the number o f longitudinal girders o f 5. However, in the case o f partially-loaded lanes, the 63

deflection distribution factor is observ ed to increase with inerease in number o f girders. Figures 4.51 to 4.53 present the relationship between number o f girders and deflection distribution factors for the middle girder due to dead load, fully-loaded lanes and fatigue loading cases, respectively. While Figures 4.54 and 4.55 show the effect o f number o f girders on the deflection distribution factor of the internal girder due to the cases o f dead load and fully-loaded lanes, respectively. No general trend is observed in case o f the middle girder and internal girder, as compared to that o f the external girder.

4.3.4

Effect of spacing of girders
Figures 4.56 through 4.60 show selected results for the effect o f spacing o f

longitudinal girders on the deflection distribution factors for two-lane, four-girder, bridges o f 25-m span. Generally, it can be observed that the deflection distribution factors for the external and internal girders increase with the increase in girder spacing for live and fatigue loading cases. On the other hand, the deflection distribution factors are almost unchanged with the increase o f spacing for dead load case similar behaviour is observed in case o f the m iddle girder.

4.3.5

Effect of loading conditions
To exam ine the effect o f number o f loaded lanes on the deflection distribution

factors o f the exterior or interior girders, two loading cases were considered, namely: fullyloaded lanes with truck loading and partially-loaded lanes with truck loading, as shown in Figures 3.3 through 3.6. Figures 4.61 to 4.63 present the deflection distribution factors due to fully-loaded lanes against those due to partially-loaded lanes for 15-m, 25-m and 35-m

64

span bridges, respectively. These plotted values are for all bridges irrespective on number lanes, number o f girders and girder spacing. Figures 4.64 to 4.66 show similar relationships but for the internal girder. It can be observed that the case of partially-loaded lanes sometimes provides the design value for the deflection distribution factor in spite the fact that the case o f fully-loaded lanes has almost double the live load compared to that for partially-loaded-lane case.

4.4

Warping stress distribution in simply-supported curved bridges
It is well established that curved I-girders undergo a coupled lateral-bending

moment in the top and bottom flanges due to curvature as shown in Figure 3.12. This lateral moment is called also; "torsional warping moment" or "bimoment", which induces warping o f the girder cross-section. The increase in longitudinal flexural stress in the bottom steel flange due to this moment is called "warping stress". To examine the change in warping stress with the change in bridge configuration or loading cases, the ratio between warping stress to the average bending stress in the bottom steel flange (W BR as calculated in equation 3.35) is examined herein. The AASHTO Guide Specifications for Horizontally Curved Bridges (Guide, 2003) states that warping-to-bending stress ratio in steel flanges o f 1-girder bridges should be limited to 0.5 for structural stability reason. In this parametric study, the ratio WBR was calculated for the exterior, middle and interior girder for each loading case considered herein.

Figures 4.67 to 4.70 present the ratio WBR for the exterior girder o f all the curved bridges considered in this study in ascending order, for dead load, fully-loaded lanes,

65

partially-loaded lanes and fatigue loading cases, respectively. It should be noted that WBR should be an absolute value, however these figures show it in both negative and positive values. This is attributed to the fact that the orientation o f the lateral moment in steel flanges changes with the change in truck loading cases. It can be observed that warping-to-bending stress ratio, W BR, increases with the increase in span length. Also, it increases with the increase in span-to-radius o f curvature ratio. Moreover, it can be observed that the upper bound o f all the recorded values o f WBR for the exterior girder is 0.3, which falls within the limit provided by the AASHTO Guide o f 2003. Figures 4.71 to 4.73 present the ratio W BR for the m iddle girders o f all the curved bridges considered in this study in ascending order, for dead load, fully-loaded lanes and fatigue loading cases, respectively. Similar trend to that o f the exterior girder is observed for the middle girder.

Figures 4.74 to 4.77 present the ratio W BR for the interior girders o f all the curved bridges considered in this study in ascending order, for dead load, fully-loaded lanes and fatigue loading cases, respectively. It can be observed that the values o f WBR are within the specified limit for all bridge types considered herein except those with span length o f 35 m and span-to-radius o f curvature o f 0.7. This value reached 16.5 in some cases. After examining the database generated from this parametric study, it was observed that this significant increase in WBR happened for most o f the loading cases with L/R = 0.7 and L = 35 m. By reviewing the assumptions and limitations o f the parametric study conduced by D avidson et al. (1996) to determine the minimum num ber o f cross-bracing intervals in curved non-com posite steel-girder bridges subjected to construction loads, it was observed that the developed equation (equation 2.19 in this thesis) was based on limiting

66

the warping-to-bending stress ratio, WBR, of the exterior girders to 0.25 for bridge o f span-to-radius o f curvature ratio, L/R, of less than or equal 0.5. In this thesis, it is considered that the minimum radius of curvature is 50 m as per the Geometric Design Standards for Ontario Highways (Ministry of Transportation and communications, 1985). As such, a span-to-radius o f curvature ratio of 0.7 for bridge span o f 35 m is considered in this parametric study. This L/R ratio was not considered in the work conducted by Davidson et al. As a result, a new equation, in replacement o f equation 2.19, should be developed to include L/R ratios more that 0.5 and those values o f WBR for the composite interior girder due to dead load at service to be in the conservative side since the maximum values for WBR were observed for dead load case. To assist in developing this equation, a sensitivity study is conducted herein to determine the change in W BR with the change in number of bracing internals for 35-m span bridges with span-to-radius or curvature rations, L/R, o f 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7. Table 4.5 presents the results from this study for four-girder bridges, while Table 4.6 presents similar results but for five-girder bridges.

4.5

Comparison between CHBDC load distribution equations and those obtained from the current finite-element analysis
The CHBDC moment distribution factor equations were developed for slab-on-

girder bridges, including reinforced concrete girders, prestressed concrete girders and composite steel girders. These girders are assumed to be supported laterally by diaphragms at the support lines and at equal intervals between the support lines as specified in the CHBDC o f 2000. The stiffness of the lateral diaphragms differs from one
67

bridge type to the other. In the current study, cross-bracing type with top and bottom chords is considered as lateral supports to the steel girders. These diaphragm s would assist in enhancing the load distribution among girders.

To exam ine the empirical expression for m om ent distribution factors specified in CH BD C for slab-on-girder bridges, the results from the current study, using the finiteelem ent m odeling, and those specified in the CHBDC are presented against each other in a graphical format. Figures 4.78 and 4.79 show the correlation between the moment distribution factors o f the exterior girder due to truck loading and fatigue loading, respectively, as specified in the CHBDC and those from the present study. Also, Figures 4.80 and 4.81 show sim ilar correlation but for the m iddle girder. It can be observed that the CH BD C m om ent distribution equations always overestim ate the structural response except for som e cases for fatigue loading shown in Figure 4.79. To examine the CHBDC deflection distribution factors which are similar to those for moment, the moment and deflection distribution factors obtained from the current finite-element m odeling are plotted against each other on Figures 4.82 and 4.83 for the exterior girder and Figures, 4.84 and 4.85 for the m iddle girder, for live and fatigue loading cases, respectively. It can be observed that the deflection distribution factors correlate very well with the m om ent distribution factors o f this study, which proves that the deflection distribution factors specified in the CH BDC, also overestimates the structural response.

68

4.6 Effect of number of bracing intervals on the structural response
Based on the recommendation stated above in section 4.4 to modify equation 2.19, the number o f cross-bracing intervals is expected to be increased. The Design engineer may question the effect of increasing the number of bracing intervals on the values obtained in this study for moment and deflection distribution factors. To answer this question, a sensitivity study was conducted on two-lane, five-girder bridge with span length o f 25 m and span-to-radius of curvature ratio o f 0.5. Three loading cases were considered herein, namely: dead load, fully-loaded lanes and partially-loaded lanes. Figure 4.86 shows the effect of increasing the number of cross-bracing intervals on the moment distribution factor o f the exterior girder. It can be observed that the m om ent distribution factor significantly decreases with the increase of the number o f bracing intervals up to 8 bracing intervals, behind which insignificant increase is observed. Figure 4.87 shows similar results but for the deflection distribution factor. It can be observed that the deflection distribution factor remains unchanged when the number o f bracing intervals is more that 4. Figure 4.88 presents the change in the warping-to-bending stress ratio, WBR, with the increase in number of bracing intervals. It can be observed that the WBR significantly decreases with the increase in the number of bracing intervals up to a certain value behind which WBR remains almost unchanged.

4.7 Development of new load distribution factor equations for straight and curved composite concrete slab-on-steel I-girder bridges
The current parametric study provides a database for the moment and deflection distribution factors for both straight and curved slab-on-steel I-girder bridges. This
69

database can be used to develop expressions for the moment and shear distribution factors for such bridges. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) software can be incorporated to establish a predictive model capable o f accurately predicting the moment and deflection distribution factors for such bridges. It can also be extended to develop softw are for analysis and design o f bridge superstructures. In developing the empirical expressions for the m om ent and deflection distribution factors or using Artificial Neural N etw orks application, the following comments can be considered: 1- T he results presented in Figures 4.82 to 4.85 show that moment and deflection distribution factors are in very good correlation for straight bridges, L/R =0. As a result, one equation can be developed for both factors. However, this equation should be extended to other two equations for moment and deflection distribution factors for curved bridges, respectively. This is because the results presented in Figures 4.82 to 4.85 show that the deflection distribution factors are always greater than the corresponding m om ent distribution factors for curved bridges. 2- The database generated in this study is for the exterior, middle and interior girders. H ow ever, no available data is available for girders between the exterior and m iddle girders and between the middle and interior girder. Figures 4.89 and 4.90 show the m om ent and deflection distribution factors, respectively, for each girder in a three-lane, five-girder bridge with span length o f 25 m, girder spacing o f 2.5 m and span-to-radius o f curvature ratio o f 0.3. These figures include all the loading cases considered in this study. It can be observed that the distribution is alm ost linear betw een the exterior and interior girders for the design values that will be used to derive the em pirical equations. As a result, the values o f the moment and deflection

70

distribution factors for girders other than the exterior, middle and interior girders can be obtained by linear interpolation using the values from the developed equations.

CHAPTER V

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1

Conclusions
Num erical and Analytical studies were carried out to investigate the static

response o f curved com posite concrete slab-on-steel I-girder bridges. A literature review w as conducted in order to establish the foundation o f this study. It was observed that there is a lack o f inform ation on the behaviour o f such structures. It should be noted that the Canadian Highw ay Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2000) does not provide any guidance w ith respect to load distribution characteristics in curved slab-on-girder bridges. In this thesis, a practical-design-oriented parametric study was conducted to investigate the structural response o f such bridges. The influences o f several parameters on the m om ent, deflection and warping stress distribution in such bridges were examined with the com m ercially available finite-element computer program SAP2000. In the performed param etric study, the prototype bridges were subjected to Canadian Highway Bridge D esign C ode (CH BD C) truck and dead loading. Based on the results from the param etric study, the follow ing conclusions are drawn: 1- Curvature is the m ost critical parameter that influences the design o f curved girders in slab-on-girder bridges. Moment and deflection distribution factors as well as the warping-to-bending stress ratio increase with the increase in bridge curvature.

2- Span length, number o f girders and girder spacing generally affect the values o f
the m om ent and deflection distribution factors. 72

3- Loading alJ bridge lanes with CHBDC truck loading does not guarantee the highest value o f the moment or deflection distribution factors in curved bridges. Results show that the loading case o f partially-loaded lanes sometimes provides the design value compared to the loaded case o f fully-loaded lanes. 4- Warping-to-bending stress ratios o f the studied curved bridges are within the recommended limit except for bridge span o f 35 m and span-to-radius o f curvature o f 0.7. A new empirical equation for the minimum number o f bracing intervals can be deduced based on the results obtained from this study to include span-to-radius o f curvature ratios up to 0.7. 5- The study proved that the CHBDC moment and deflection distribution factors overestimate the structural response o f interior girders by 10% and 20 % at least due to truck and fatigue loading respectively and underestimate the structural response o f external girders due to fatigue loading by a percentage which reaches 38% in some cases, for straight composite concrete slab-on-steel I-girder bridges. The database generated from this parametric study can be used to refine CHBDC equations.
6 - The provision in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code o f 2000 treating

curved bridges as straight ones in the structural design (L^/bR is less or equal 1) underestimates the structural response. We recommend those specified in the AASHTO-LRFD Specifications of 2004, instead. Besides, applying the

distribution factors o f live load to the dead load distribution, generally and using 3 equally spaced bracing intervals at least for 15m span bridges

73

7-

can be used to develop expressions for the moment and deflection

distribution factors for the curved system.

5.2

Recommendations for Future Research

It is recom m ended that further research efforts be directed towards the following: 1- U sing the database obtained in this study, empirical expressions for bridge analysis can be deduced, and/or Neural Network software can be used to establish an integrated tool to obtain accurate distribution factors based on the developed database in this thesis. 2- The study o f shear distribution factors in curved slab-on-I-girder bridges. 3- The study o f load distribution in continuous curved slab-on-I-girder bridges. 4- The study o f the load distribution in curved slab-on-I-girder bridges at higher load levels to include effects o f concrete cracking and yielding o f steel.
