Abstract  The Mediating Role of Motivations for Sex in the Relationship Between Childhood Sexual  Abuse and Sexual Health Outcomes Among Homeless Youth in Canada  Master of Arts, 2010  Danielle R. Schwartz  Psychology, Ryerson University  Childhood sexual abuse (CSA), which is disproportionately common among homeless youth, is  associated with adverse sexual health outcomes.  However, there is a lack of data as to how CSA  is related to adverse sexual health outcomes among homeless youth.  The current study examined  motivations for sex as mediators in the relationships between CSA and 1) sexual risk behaviours  and 2) sexual functioning among homeless youth.  179 youth (ages 1621) completed measures  examining CSA, motivations for sex, and sexual health outcomes.  CSA was associated with  earlier age of first intercourse among females and involvement in sex trading among males.  CSA was also associated with motivations to have sex for partner approval and coping.  Sex for  partner approval mediated the relationship between CSA and age of first intercourse among  females.  This study highlights the importance of targeting motivations in the reduction of  adverse sexual health outcomes among homeless youth in Canada.

The Mediating Role of Motivations for Sex in the Relationship Between Childhood Sexual  Abuse and Sexual Health Outcomes Among Homeless Youth in Canada  Compared to the general population of youth in Canada, homeless youth are at an  increased risk for a host of adverse health consequences.  Sexual health problems are particularly  widespread among homeless youth.  The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) provided  data on these sexual health outcomes and related sexual behaviours among homeless youth (ages  1524) in seven urban centres across Canada.  This largescale crosssectional study, the  Enhanced Surveillance of Canadian Street Youth (ESYS), collected data at three separate time  points ­ 1999, 2001, and 2003 (PHAC, 2006).  According to ESYS, the overall proportion of  homeless youth reporting a lifetime sexually transmitted infection (STI) ranged from 20.8%  26.6% over the threeyear study period (PHAC, 2006).  Lifetime prevalence of STIs was even  higher in a separate sample of Montreal homeless youth (ages 1325), in which 31.7% reported a  past STI (Roy et al., 2000).  These rates appear significantly higher than the STI prevalence  among the general Canadian youth population (ages 1524), which is approximately 4%  (Rotermann, 2005).  Rates of specific STIs and HIV are also higher among Canadian homeless youth.  In E  SYS, the prevalence of chlamydia ranged from 8.6%11.5%, approximately ten times higher than  the prevalence among youth in the general population (PHAC, 2006).  Other Canadian studies of  homeless youth have reported similar rates of 6.6% (Haley et al., 2002) and 8.6% (Shields et al.,  2004).  In ESYS, prevalence of gonorrhoea was 2030 times higher than rates in the general  youth population, and increased significantly over the study period.  Homeless youth are also at  an increased risk of contracting hepatitis B and C (Beech, Myers, & Beech, 2002 Nyamathi et  al., 2002 PHAC, 2006) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2), the primary cause of genital herpes

1 

(PHAC, 2006).  Studies of homeless youth in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver have reported  high HIV prevalence among homeless youth, ranging from 1.9%2.8% (DeMatteo et al., 1999  Marshall, Kerr, Livingstone, Montaner, & Wood, 2008 Roy et al., 2000).  Pregnancy or impregnation is also very common among homeless youth.  In one  Canadian study, 47.1% of the females reported at least one past pregnancy and 35.6% of the  males reported having impregnated a female (Roy et al., 2000).  This is markedly higher than  rates from a national sample of Canadian students in grades 9 and 11, in which 3.0% of females  reported lifetime pregnancy and 1.7% of males reported having impregnated a female (Boyce et  al., 2006).  Similarly, in a nationally representative U.S. study comparing prevalence rates of  lifetime pregnancy among homeless and nonhomeless female youth (ages 1417), youth living  on the streets (48.2%) and youth living in shelters (32.2%) reported significantly higher rates of  lifetime pregnancy compared to nonhomeless female youth (7.2%) (Greene & Ringwalt, 1998).  Sexual Risk Behaviours Among Homeless Youth  Poor sexual health outcomes among homeless youth may be related to a relatively higher  prevalence of sexual risk behaviours compared to the general population.  In ESYS, more than  95% had previously engaged in sexual intercourse, with 14 years as the average age of first  intercourse (PHAC, 2006).  Similarly, among street youth in Montreal, 99.3% were sexually  active with a mean age of 13.7 for first intercourse (Roy et al., 2000).  This is notably younger  than the average age among the general population in Canada (16.8 years Hansen, Mann, Wong,  & McMahon, 2004) and the U.S. (17.7 years ElseQuest, Hyde, & DeLamater, 2005).  Homeless youth are also more likely to engage in unprotected sex than youth in the  general population.  In a national study of Canadian youth drawn from the general population  (ages 15 to 19), 43% reported being sexually active (i.e., having sex at least once) and 25% of

2 

these youth reported not using a condom at last intercourse (Rotermann, 2008).  In contrast, in a  national study of Canadian homeless youth, 95% reported being sexually active.  Of these youth,  41%51% reported not using a condom with a female partner and 47%56% reported not using a  condom with a male partner at their last sexual encounter (i.e., vaginal or anal intercourse  PHAC, 2006).  In a Montreal sample of homeless youth, 98.2% had ever engaged in vaginal  intercourse and 31.8% had ever engaged in anal intercourse.  Of these youth, 86.8% who had  engaged in vaginal intercourse and 67.6% who had engaged in anal sex did not always use a  condom (Roy et al., 2000).  U.S. studies have generated similarly high findings, with 41.9%  45.5% of homeless youth reporting past unprotected intercourse (Bailey, Camlin, & Ennett,  1998 Halcón  & Lifson, 2004).  Additionally, homeless youth report higher numbers of sexual partners than youth in the  general population.  In the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS), a national U.S. study of youth  in grades 9 to 12, 13.8% of the sample reported having sexual intercourse with four or more  partners (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009).  In contrast, Roy et al. (2000) found  that 20.6% of sexually active homeless youth reported between 620 sexual partners in the past  six months, and 7.6% reported more than 20 sexual partners.  Across two years of ESYS, male  youth reported an average of 2123 lifetime sexual partners and female youth reported an  average of 1722 lifetime sexual partners (PHAC, 2006).  In addition, high proportions of youth  in ESYS engaged in sexual activity with highrisk sexual partners, including partners who had  an STI, partners who were involved in sex trading and partners who were under the influence of  drugs during their last sexual encounter.  Rates of "survival sex" or sex trading (i.e., exchange of sex for shelter, food, drugs, or  money) have been found to be quite high among homeless youth.  In ESYS, 21.2% of homeless

3 

youth reported lifetime involvement in sex trade (PHAC, 2006).  Other Canadian and U.S.  studies have reported similar or higher rates of lifetime sex trade involvement, ranging from  21.4%46.6% (Bailey et al., 1998 Ennett, Bailey, & Federman, 1999 Greene, Ennett, &  Ringwalt, 1999 Halcón  & Lifson, 2004 Kral, Molnar, Booth, & Watters, 1997 Roy et al.,  2000 Weber, Boivin, Blais, Haley, & Roy, 2002).  These rates appear significantly higher than  those reported among youth in the general population.  For example, one nationally  representative U.S. study of 13,294 youth reported that 3.5% of the sample had ever exchanged  sex for drugs or money (Edwards, Iritani, & Hallfors, 2006).  Childhood Sexual Abuse and Its Relation to Sexual Health Outcomes  Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a significant risk factor for both homelessness and poor  sexual health among youth.  In one study of homeless youth, over 60% of the sample (50% of  males and 72.7% of females) reported a history of CSA (Rew, TaylorSeehafer, & Fitzgerald,  2001).  In another sample of 775 homeless youth living in large urban cities throughout the U.S.,  CSA was reported by 70% of females and 24% of males (Molnar, Shade, Kral, Booth, &  Watters, 1998).  Further, among homeless youth between the ages of 1522, nearly half of the  sample reported a history of CSA (Rew, TaylorSeehafer, Thomas, & Yockey, 2001).  These  rates appear significantly higher than those reported in the general population, ranging from  5.8%34% among females and 2%11% among males (Walker, Carey, Mohr, Stein, & Seedat,  2004).  Given that CSA has been identified as a consistent predictor of negative sexual health  outcomes in a range of populations, including homeless youth (see Senn, Carey, & Vanable,  2008 for a review), it is a fundamental variable to explore when examining sexual health  behaviours among homeless youth.

CSA and risky sexual behaviour.  There has been a substantial amount of research  examining the association between CSA and sexual risk behaviours among adults.  Results from  a large Swedish sample demonstrated that, compared to nonabused participants, participants  who had experienced child or adolescent sexual abuse demonstrated significantly more sexual  risk behaviours, including younger age at first intercourse, younger age at diagnosis of an STI,  greater frequency of unintended pregnancy, greater likelihood of participation in group sex,  greater likelihood of engaging in sex trading, and increased sexual and physical assault (Steel &  Herlitz, 2005).  In another study of adult men and women attending an STI clinic, CSA was  significantly associated with increased sexual risk behaviours including more sexual partners,  unprotected sex, and sex trading (Senn, Carey, Vanable, CouryDoniger, & Urban, 2006).  Similar findings have emerged from studies examining this relationship among youth.  Results from one study indicated that youth who had been sexually abused were more likely than  nonabused youth to have had intercourse before the age of 14, to have had three or more sexual  partners in the last three months, and to have a had a past STI (Buzi et al., 2003).  Further, the  Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a U.S. national schoolbased study, found that CSA was associated  with multiple sexual partners, unprotected sex, and alcohol or drug use during last sexual  encounter (Howard & Wang, 2005).  Fewer studies have directly examined the association between CSA and sexual risk  behaviours among homeless youth (Johnson, Rew, & Sternglanz, 2006 RotheramBorus,  Mahler, Koopman, & Langabeer, 1996 Yates, MacKenzie, Pennbridge, & Swofford, 1991  Simons & Whitbeck, 1991 Tyler, 2009).  Consistent with research on other populations, the  studies that have examined this association repeatedly show that CSA is associated with a wide  range of sexual risk behaviours.  RotheramBorus and colleagues (1996) found that homeless

5 

youth with a history of CSA were significantly more likely than nonabused homeless youth to  engage in unprotected sex and to have more sexual partners.  Similarly, Johnson et al. (2006)  found that homeless youth who had experienced CSA engaged in more sexual risk behaviours  than nonabused homeless youth.   Other studies have reported that CSA is a significant predictor  of later sex trading among homeless adolescents (Simons & Whitbeck, 1991 Tyler, 2009 Yates  et al., 1991).  A recent review examined the published studies investigating the relationship between  CSA and sexual health outcomes across a variety of youth and adult populations (Senn et al.,  2008).  Across studies, there was a consistent association between CSA and sexual risk  behaviours ­ specifically, earlier age of first intercourse, higher numbers of sexual partners, and  increased sex trading.  These findings were demonstrated among both males and females, adults  and adolescents, and in the general population as well as in vulnerable populations, including  homeless youth.  CSA and problems with sexual functioning.  In addition to the research investigating  the relationship between CSA and later sexual risk behaviour, studies have also explored the  association between CSA and sexual functioning.  These studies, which have been primarily  conducted among adult women, have consistently reported that individuals who experienced  CSA demonstrate later problems with sexual functioning (Davis & PetreticJackson, 2000  DiLillo, 2001 Heiman & HeardDavison, 2004 Leonard, Iverson, & Follette, 2008 Najman,  Dunne, Purdie, Boyle, & Coxeter, 2005 RumsteinMcKean & Hunsley, 2001 Sarwer & Durlak,  1996 see Leonard & Follette, 2002 and Loeb, Williams, Carmona, Rivkin, & Wyatt, 2002 for  reviews).  Across a range of clinical, college, and community samples, these studies show that

6 

CSA is associated with a range of sexual functioning problems, including lack of sexual desire  and/or sexual arousal, fear of sexual contact, and sexual dissatisfaction.  Two studies (Feiring, Simon, & Cleland, 2009 Simon & Feiring, 2008) have reported  that CSA puts youth at an increased risk for the development of sexual functioning problems, as  defined by the sexual concerns (e.g., perceptions of sexual problems in relationships, sexual  dissatisfaction, and unwanted sexual thoughts and feelings) and dysfunctional sexual behaviours  (e.g., using sex to combat loneliness, reduce distress, or gain love or attention) subscales of the  Trauma Symptom Inventory (Briere, Elliott, Harris, & Cotman, 1995).  These findings suggest  that the association between CSA and sexual functioning problems, which has been well  established among female adults, also exists among youth.  However, the subscales used to  measure sexual functioning problems in these studies very broadly assessed sexual problems,  and specifically sexual problems that may arise as a result of trauma.  These measures did not  assess specific areas of sexual functioning such as arousal, desire, orgasm, or pain.  Therefore,  although these studies suggest some association between CSA and sexual functioning problems  among youth, research in this area remains quite limited, with no studies examining this  association among homeless youth.  Gender differences in sexual risk behaviours and sexual functioning.  When  examining sexual health outcomes among homeless youth, attention must be given to potential  gender differences (Tevendale, Lightfoot, & Slocum, 2009).  Although both male and female  homeless youth are at considerable risk for adverse sexual health outcomes, there are gender  differences in the frequency and nature of sexual risk behaviours and prevalence of STIs among  homeless youth.  Across studies in Canada and the U.S., female homeless youth reported higher  STI prevalence rates, were less likely to use condoms consistently, were more likely to have had

7 

a sexual partner with an STI history, and were more likely to engage in sex trading.  Male  homeless youth reported more frequent intercourse with regular and casual partners, more  lifetime sex partners, and were more likely to have engaged in anal sex (Halcón  & Lifson, 2004  MacKellar et al., 2000 PHAC, 2006 Roy et al., 2000 Solorio, Milburn, RotheramBorus,  Higgins, & Gelberg, 2006 Tevendale, Lightfoot, & Slocum, 2009).  HIV prevalence was also  higher among male homeless youth compared to female homeless youth (DeMatteo et al., 1999  Roy et al., 2000).  With regard to sexual functioning, the majority of studies examining the relationship  between CSA and sexual functioning have focused primarily on adult females, with limited  research specifically examining sexual functioning among youth ­ particularly male youth.  Those which have focused on males have found inconsistent associations between CSA and  sexual functioning problems.  For example, in a representative U.S. study of 1410 men (ages 18  59), those who had experienced CSA (defined as adultchild contact) were three times more  likely to experience erectile dysfunction and approximately twice as likely to experience  premature ejaculation and low sexual desire compared to men who had not experienced CSA  (Laumann, Paik, & Rosen, 1999).  Conversely, in a representative sample of Australian adults,  CSA was not associated with symptoms of sexual dysfunction among men (Najman et al., 2005).  CSA was also not associated with sexual dysfunction among heterosexual men seeking sexual  dysfunction treatment (Sarwer, Crawford, & Durlak, 1997).  The inconsistent findings for males,  coupled with a lack of research examining sexual functioning problems among youth of either  gender, suggest the need to examine whether gender differences exist in the relationship between  CSA and sexual functioning among homeless youth and other youth populations.

8 

Motivations for Sex as Mediators in the Relationship between CSA and Sexual Health  Outcomes  A number of theoretical models have been proposed to explain the relationship between  CSA and adverse health outcomes.  According to Finkelhor and Browne (1985), the sexual  health consequences of CSA can be understood through a process of "traumatic sexualization,"  in which children who have experienced CSA develop inappropriate and dysfunctional sexual  feelings and attitudes as a result of their abuse.  According to this theory, CSA disrupts normal  sexual development and leads children to have skewed perceptions of sexuality.  For example,  sexually abused children may develop maladaptive sexual associations and, through the  perpetrator's use of rewards (e.g., affection, attention, privileges and gifts), may learn that sex is  a necessary means of being or becoming valued by others.  Similarly, Browning and Laumann  (1997) proposed that CSA leads children to develop a culturally inappropriate model of sexuality  which subsequently increases their probability of engaging in sexual risk behaviours in  adolescent and adulthood.  Cognitive models have also demonstrated that CSA may lead  individuals to have negative sexual selfschemas (i.e., cognitive generalizations about sexual  aspects of oneself), which may impact subsequent sexual behaviour and functioning (Feiring et  al., 2009 Meston & Heiman, 2000 Meston, Rellini, & Heiman, 2006 Reissing, Binik, Khalife,  Cohen, & Amsel, 2003).  These theories indicate that CSA influences individuals' sexual perceptions and  cognitions however, they do not specify how CSA directly influences behaviour.  From a  functional analytic perspective, behaviours are best understood in terms of the functions they  serve (Snyder, 1993).  Therefore, in order to understand why sexually abused youth engage in  sexual risk behaviours, it is crucial to explore the motivations underlying these behaviours

9 

(Cooper, Shapiro, and Powers, 1998).  Past theory and research that has shown that sexually  abused children engage in increased sexual risk behaviours (e.g., Senn et al., 2008) and  experience skewed perceptions of sexuality and normal sexual behaviours (e.g., Browning &  Laumann, 1997 Finkelhor & Browne, 1985).  Building upon this, it is expected that sexually  abused individuals will experience distinct motivations for sex compared to nonabused  individuals as a result of their altered sexual perceptions.  These motivations for sex may then  influence individuals' sexual risk behaviours and subsequent sexual functioning.  Past studies have demonstrated that motivations for sex are associated with CSA  (Bornovalova, Daughters, & Lejuez, 2010) and sexual health outcomes (Cooper, Shapiro, and  Powers, 1998 Gebhardt, Kuyper, & Greunsven, 2003).  In a recent study of highrisk inner city  drug users, CSA was associated with increased motivations to have sex to escape emotional  distress and to communicate emotional distress to others (Bornovalova, Daughters, & Lejuez,  2010).  As well, one study of youth with a history of CSA found that with views of sexual  intimacy, a construct closely resembling sexual motivations, were associated with sexual risk  behaviours and sexual problems (Simon & Feiring, 2008).  Specifically, views of sex for  recreation (i.e., sex for fun or physical gratification) were positively associated with number of  sexual partners.  Further, partnerfocused views of sex (i.e., sex focused on partners needs more  than personal needs) were positively associated with selfreports of sexual concerns (e.g.,  problems in relationships, sexual dissatisfaction, and unwanted sexual thoughts and feelings).  Given that all participants in this sample had experienced CSA, this particular study does not  outline the differences in sexual motivations between individuals who had and had not  experienced CSA.  However, taken together, these two studies suggest that motivations for sex  may be influenced by CSA experiences.

10 

Motivations for sex have also been linked with sexual risk behaviours and sexual health  outcomes in normative samples (Cooper, Shapiro, and Powers, 1998 Gebhardt, Kuyper, &  Greunsven, 2003).  Cooper and colleagues (1998) described that sex for enhancement (i.e.,  having sex to enhance physical pleasure), sex for coping (i.e., having sex to avoid negative  emotions), and sex for partner approval (i.e., having sex to please one's partner) predicted a  distinct pattern of sexual risk behaviours in adolescent and community samples.  Specifically,  enhancement motivations were negatively associated with age of first intercourse and positively  associated with lifetime frequency of sex, number of lifetime partners, number of unplanned  pregnancies, and number of STIs.  Coping motivations were associated with having multiple  sexual partners, having intercourse with a stranger or prostitute, and having intercourse in  exchange for money or drugs.  Similarly, sex for partner approval was associated with less  effective birth control use and unplanned pregnancy.  Similar findings emerged in a second study investigating the relationship between  motivations for sex and sexual behaviours among adolescents (Gebhardt, Kuyper, & Greunsven,  2003).  Compared to adolescents who had not engaged in casual sex, those who had engaged in  casual sex were more likely to endorse sex for enhancement, sex for partner approval, and sex  for coping as motivations for having sex.  Further, among those who had engaged in casual sex,  sex for coping and sex for partner approval were associated with increased number of casual  partners.  Among females, sex for enhancement and partnerapproval was negatively associated  with condom use.  Motivations for sex may be particularly important to explore given the extensive body of  research which has demonstrated that maladaptive health behaviours are amenable to change via  psychological interventions that target motivations (Miller & Rollnick, 2002).  Specifically,

11 

motivational interviewing, a treatment approach which focuses on individuals' intrinsic  motivations for behavioural change, has been found to reduce a range of negative health  behaviours including sexual risk behaviours (e.g., Carey et al., 1997 Carey & Lewis, 1999  Kiene & Barta, 2006).  As such, identifying the specific motivations for sex that mediate the  relationship between CSA and sexual health outcomes may guide future HIV prevention  interventions and clinical treatments.  Purpose and Hypotheses  In summary, research has demonstrated a consistent association between CSA and  adverse sexual health outcomes, including sexual risk behaviours and sexual functioning  problems.  In addition, among youth who have experienced CSA, there appears to be a  significant relationship between motivations for sex and both sexual risk behaviours and  problems with sexual functioning.  However, findings regarding problems with sexual  functioning and findings regarding motivations for sex have yet to be extended to populations of  homeless youth.  The current study sought to investigate how experiences of CSA among  homeless youth may be associated with individuals' motivations for sex, sexual risk behaviours,  and sexual functioning.  This study examined the mediating role of motivations for sex in the relationship between  CSA and 1) sexual risk behaviours and 2) problems with sexual functioning in two separate  models.  Motivations for sex that have been linked to adverse sexual health outcomes (i.e., sex  for enhancement, sex for coping, and sex for partner approval Cooper et al., 1998 Gebhardt et  al.,  2003) were included in analyses.  Given that male and female homeless youth engage in  different types of sexual risk behaviours (Halcón  & Lifson, 2004 Roy et al., 2000), and

12 

demonstrate differential responses to CSA in terms of sexual functioning (Najman et al., 2005),  separate gender analyses were conducted.  Model 1: Motivations for Sex as Mediators in the Relationship between CSA and Sexual  Risk Behaviours  The first model proposed that motivations for sex would mediate the relationship between  a history of CSA and sexual risk behaviours.  Sexual risk behaviours included: age of first  intercourse, number of lifetime sexual partners, and lifetime involvement in sex trading.  These  behaviours were selected as they have been consistently linked to CSA throughout the literature  (Senn et al., 2008).  In addition, exploratory analyses were conducted to determine if CSA was  associated with other sexual health variables, including past STI, past pregnancy/impregnation,  and sexual risk behaviours in the past six months (i.e., number of sexual partners, UVI, UAI,  drug or alcohol use during last sexual encounter).  Based on Baron and Kenny's (1986)  mediational model, the following hypotheses were tested (see Figure 1 for model):  Hypothesis 1a): A history of CSA will be positively associated with sexual risk behaviours.  Hypothesis 1b): A history of CSA will be positively associated with the following motivations  for sex: i) sex for enhancement, ii) sex for coping, and iii) sex for partner approval.  Hypothesis 1c): Controlling for a history of CSA, motivations for sex will be positively  associated with sexual risk behaviours.  Hypothesis 1d): Controlling for motivations for sex, there will be a significant reduction in the  relationship between CSA and sexual risk behaviours.

Model 2: Motivations for Sex as Mediators in the Relationship between CSA and Sexual  Functioning Problems  The second model proposed that motivations for sex would mediate the relationship  between CSA and problems with sexual functioning.  For females, sexual functioning problems  were measured by six domains and a total score: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction,  and pain (Rosen et al., 2000).  For males, sexual functioning problems were measured by five  domains and a total score: sexual drive, erections, ejaculation, problem assessment, and overall  satisfaction (O'Leary et al., 1995).  Based on Baron and Kenny's (1986) mediational model, the  following hypotheses were tested (see Figure 2 for model):  Hypothesis 2a): CSA will be positively associated with sexual functioning problems.  Hypothesis 2b): CSA will be positively associated with the following motivations for sex: i) sex  for enhancement, ii) sex for coping, and iii) sex for partner approval.  Hypothesis 2c): Controlling for CSA, motivations for sex will be positively associated with  sexual functioning problems.  14 

Hypothesis 2d): Controlling for motivations for sex, there will be a significant reduction in the  relationship between CSA and sexual functioning problems.

Method  Participants  Data were collected over a 10month period from 179 youth (58% male).  Participants  were recruited from five shelters that serve homeless and atrisk youth in the Greater Toronto  Area.  The shelters offer a range of services, including residential programs which provide beds  and meals to youth, employment programs which provide job opportunities to youth, housing  programs which assist youth to obtain longterm or permanent housing, and dropin programs  which offer food, shelter, clothing, and counselling referrals.  To be eligible for the study, youth  needed to be residents at one of the participating shelters and between the ages of 16 and 21.  Although youth under the age of 18 are typically required to provide assent accompanied by  parental consent, it has been argued that obtaining parental consent when conducting sexual  health research with adolescents may be unnecessary and potentially harmful (Flicker & Guta,  2008).  Participants in the present sample were residents at a homeless shelter and many did not  have direct involvement with a parent or guardian.  As well, this study involved minimal risk to  participants.  Accordingly, the Research Ethics Boards at York University and Ryerson  University provided approval for adolescents under the age of 18 to participate in this study  without parental consent.  Table 1 presents a breakdown of the present study sample by shelter,  as well as demographic information of study participants.  Procedure  Shelter staff agreed to assist in recruitment by making announcements about the study to  residents and by posting recruitment flyers and signup sheets in the shelters.  Interested youth  had the opportunity to sign up for scheduled data collection sessions at each shelter.  Under the  supervision of the researchers and shelter staff, large group administrations of up to 15

participants were held at the shelters.  All researchers were fully trained on questionnaire content  and administration and were able to answer any questions that arose during the sessions.  Prior to questionnaire administration, the voluntary nature, freedom to withdraw, and  purpose of the study was explained to the youth.  Participants were verbally informed that their  names or other identifying information would in no way be connected to their questionnaire  package, and that no one but the research staff would see their responses.  Youth were informed  that they would be compensated financially for their participation.  Youth were then asked to  sign an informed consent form (see Appendix A) outlining the purpose of the study, the  procedures, risks, benefits, compensation, confidentiality and their right to refuse participation.  Participants then had the opportunity to ask any questions of the researcher or centre staff prior  to completing the questionnaire.  Participants completed the questionnaire package in approximately one hour.  Participants were instructed to approach the researchers if they needed any clarification.  To  ensure confidentiality, participants were assigned an ID number, which was kept separate from  their names.  At the end of data collection, youth were given $20 cash for their participation.  All  youth were provided with a debriefing form, outlining in greater detail the purpose of the study  as well as a referral list of community resources, including mental health facilities, sexual health  clinics, job counselling sites, and various youth shelters (see Appendix B).  The measures for this study were part of a larger questionnaire package, which focused  on child abuse experiences, current mental health and sexual functioning, and health risk  behaviours.  Separate questionnaire packages were created for male and female participants.  The  packages were identical with the exception of three items: a) females were asked "Have you ever  been pregnant?" and males were asked "Have you ever gotten someone pregnant?" b) the item

18 

asking females about using birth control was removed from the male package and c) the  wording on items asking about condom use in females was changed from "you" to "your  partner".  As well, separate measures were used to assess male and female sexual functioning  (see Appendix C for combined male and female measures).  Measures Demographic variables.  Participants completed a demographics questionnaire assessing  gender, age, ethnic background, sexual orientation, and education level.  Childhood abuse.  Experiences of child abuse were assessed using the Childhood  Trauma Questionnaire ­ Short Form (CTQSF, Bernstein et al., 2003).  The CTQSF is a 28item  selfreport scale based on the original 70item CTQ (Bernstein et al., 1994).  The CTQSF is  rated on a fivepoint Likerttype scale (1 = never true 5 = often true).  There are five subscales  in the CTQ: 1) emotional abuse, 2) physical abuse, 3) sexual abuse, 4) emotional neglect, and 5)  physical neglect.  Total scores on each subscale ranged from 5 to 25.  For the purpose of this  study, only the sexual abuse factor was examined.  Examples of items from the sexual abuse  subscale include, "Someone tried to touch me in a sexual way, or tried to make me touch them"  and "Someone molested me."  CTQSF sexual abuse scores were dichotomized, with a total  score of 5 equalling "no history of CSA" and a total score of 6 or higher equalling "history of  CSA."  This dichotomization has been used in past research (see Baker & Maiorino, 2010 for a  review) and was based on the categories provided by the CTQSF manual, in which a score of 5  represents no/minimal CSA and scores of 6 and higher represent mild/moderate to extreme CSA  (Bernstein & Fink, 1998).  In addition, this study builds upon models that examine the presence  or absence of CSA (e.g., Finkelhor & Browne, 1985), as opposed to the severity of CSA.

19 

The internal consistencies for the CTQSF sexual abuse factor were high in a sample of  adolescent psychiatric inpatients ( = .95), adult substance abusing patients, adult substance  abusers in the community, and a normative sample of adults (s =.93, .94 and .92, respectively  Bernstein et al., 2003).  Further, the CTQSF has demonstrated high criterion validity, with the  sexual abuse factor showing a correlation of r = .75 with therapists' ratings of CSA history in an  adolescent sample.  The CTQSF also showed good convergent validity, with high correlations  with therapist reports of client CSA, and good divergent validity, with low correlations with  therapist reports of other forms of abuse history (Bernstein et al., 2003).  The sexual abuse  subscale of the CTQSF demonstrated high internal consistency in the present sample ( = .94).  Motivations for sexual behaviours.  The Sex Motives Scale (SMS Cooper et al., 1998)  was used to measure motivations for sexual behaviour.  The SMS is a 29item selfreport scale in  which respondents were asked to report how often they have engaged in sex for a variety of  reasons in the past 12 months.  Responses are provided on a 5point Likerttype scale, ranging  from 1 (never/almost never) to 5 (almost always/always).  The SMS examines six motivational  categories: 1) enhancement, 2) intimacy, 3) coping, 4) selfaffirmation, 5) partner approval, and  6) peer approval.  For the purpose of the current study, only enhancement motivations (e.g.,  "How often do you have sex because it feels good?"), coping motivations (e.g., "How often do  you have sex to cope with upset feelings?"), and partner approval motivations (e.g., "How often  do you have sex out of fear that your partner won't love you anymore if you don't?") were  examined, as they have been consistently linked to increased sexual risk behaviours and poor  sexual health outcomes (Cooper et al., 1998).  A study of college and community samples demonstrated high internal consistencies  across SMS subscales, ranging from a = .83 to .90 for males, and from a = .85 to .90 for

20 

females.  Testretest reliability was also good, with correlations ranging from r = .47 to .67  across subscales over a 1.5 year interval (Cooper et al., 1998).   In another study of college  students, internal consistency was high and ranged from a = .83 to .96 across subscales  (Schachner & Shaver, 2004).  The enhancement, coping, and partner approval subscales of the  SMS have also been found to predict a range of risky sexual behaviours including higher  frequency of sex and more sexual partners (Cooper et al., 1998).  Internal consistencies in the  present sample were high, ranging from a= .89 to .94 across the three subscales used in the  present study.  Sexual risk behaviours.  Participants were asked a series of questions pertaining to their  sexual behaviours.  Because sexual behaviours can be confounded with experiences of CSA  experiences (see Senn et al., 2008), participants were specifically instructed not to include any  abuse experiences in their responses to sexual behaviour items.  Three sexual risk behaviours  were examined as outcome variables in this study ­ age of first vaginal or anal intercourse,  number of lifetime sexual partners (protected and unprotected sex), and past involvement in sex  trading.  These three particular items were used to measure sexual risk behaviours as they have  been consistently associated with CSA in a range of populations across studies (Senn et al.,  2008).  Participants were also asked about other sexual health outcomes, including lifetime STIs  and pregnancy/impregnation.  In addition, they were asked about their sexual behaviours in the  past six months, including number of sexual partners, unprotected vaginal intercourse (UVI),  unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), and drug or alcohol use during their last sexual encounter.  Female Sexual Functioning.  The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI Rosen et al.,  2000) was used to assess female sexual functioning.  The FSFI is a 19item selfreport measure  which examines sexual functioning over the past four weeks.  The FSFI measures six domains:

21 

1) desire (e.g., "Over the past 4 weeks, how often did you feel sexual desire or interest?"), 2)  arousal (e.g., "Over the past 4 weeks, how often did you feel sexual aroused (`turned on') during  sexual activity or intercourse?"), 3) lubrication ("Over the past 4 weeks, how often did you  become lubricated (`wet') during sexual activity or intercourse?"), 4) orgasm (Over the past 4  weeks, when you had sexual stimulation or intercourse, how often did you reach orgasm?"), 5)  satisfaction (e.g., "Over the past 4 weeks, how satisfied were you with your ability to reach  orgasm during sexual activity or intercourse?"), and 6) pain (e.g., "How often did you experience  discomfort or pain during vaginal penetration?").  The FSFI has been called the "gold standard" in the assessment of female sexual  functioning (Sand, Rosen, Meston, & Brotto, 2009) and has been validated in eight separate  psychometric studies (e.g., Meston, 2003 Rosen et al., 2000 Wiegel, Meston, & Rosen, 2005).  For example, in a sample of 131 controls and 128 agematched females with sexual arousal  disorder, the FSFI demonstrated high internal consistency across domains, with Cronbach's s  ranging from .89 to .96.  Testretest reliability was also high after a two to four week period, with  correlations ranging from .79 to .86 across the domains (Rosen et al., 2000).  The FSFI has also  demonstrated strong discriminant validity by reliably distinguishing between healthy controls  and females with sexual arousal disorder (Rosen et al., 2000), female orgasmic disorder, and  hypoactive desire disorder (Meston, 2003).  To date, the FSFI has not been used to measure  sexual functioning among female youth.  However, given that no measures have been  specifically developed to measure sexual functioning in this population, the FSFI was selected  given its sound psychometric properties across adult samples.  In the present sample, the internal  consistency of the FSFI total scale was  = .93, with subscales ranging from a = .77 to .93.

22 

Male Sexual Functioning.  To measure sexual functioning among males, the Brief Male  Sexual Function Inventory (BSFI O'Leary et al., 1995) was used.  The BSFI is an 11item self  report measure which examines 3 functional domains (i.e., sexual drive, erection, and  ejaculation), as well as problem assessment of these domains (i.e., perceptions of problems in  each area, and overall satisfaction).  Examples of items include, "During the past 30 days, on  how many days have you felt sexual drive?" and "How much difficulty did you have getting an  erection during the past 30 days?"  In a sample of men attending a sexual dysfunction clinic and men attending a general  medical clinic, internal consistency ranged from a = .62 to .95.  After a oneweek interval, test  retest reliability ranged from r = .79  .90.  Discriminant validity was found for three domains ­  erectile function, sexual satisfaction, and problem assessment (O'Leary et al., 1995).  The BSFI  has also been validated in a community sample of 2115 men (O'Leary et al., 2003), and in a  normative sample of 1185 men from Norway (Mykletun, O'Leary, and Fossa, 2006).  Like the  FSFI, the BSFI has not been used to assess sexual functioning among male youth.  However,  given that no measures have been specifically developed to measure sexual functioning in this  population, the BSFI was selected given its sound psychometric properties across adult samples.  In the present sample, internal consistency for the overall BSFI was a = .88, with subscales  ranging from a = .67 to .82.  Consistent with past studies, the ejaculation subscale demonstrated  poor reliability (a = .62 in the O'Leary, 1995 study and a = .67 in the present sample), with all  other subscales demonstrating good reliability.  Therefore, results based on the ejaculation  subscale were interpreted with caution.

23 

Data Analyses  Before testing the study hypotheses, descriptive statistics for each variable were  examined and data was screened for outliers and nonnormality.  Student ttests (for continuous 
2  variables) and   tests (for categorical variables) were conducted to examine gender differences 

in variables.  Pearson correlations and oneway ANOVAs were then conducted to determine if  demographic variables (age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, education) were associated with sexual  risk behaviours or sexual functioning.  Any demographic variables which were associated with at  least one dependent variable were controlled for when testing the study hypotheses.  Hypotheses were then tested using a series of regression analyses.  Linear regressions  were conducted for continuous dependent variables (total number of sexual partners and age at  first intercourse) and logistic regressions were conducted for dichotomous variables (whether or  not an individual has ever engaged in sex trading).  To test hypotheses #1a and #2a, regression  analyses were conducted examining the association between history of CSA and sexual risk  behaviours (Model 1) and sexual functioning problems (Model 2), controlling for demographic  variables.  To test hypotheses #1b and #2b, regression analyses were conducted examining the  association between history of CSA and motivations for sex (Models 1 and 2), controlling for  demographic variables.  To test hypotheses #1c and #2c, hierarchical regression analyses were  conducted, with demographic variables entered on Step 1, CSA entered on Step 2, and  motivations for sex entered on Step 3, with a sexual risk behaviour (Model 1) or sexual  functioning subscale (Model 2) as the dependent variable.  To test hypotheses #1d and #2d, a  Sobel test of mediation (Preacher & Hayes, 2004) was conducted to determine if inclusion of the  mediator in the model led to a significant reduction in the relationship between the independent  and dependent variables.

24 

Results  Using box plots, outliers were detected in three variables (age of first intercourse, number  of lifetime sexual partners, and FSFI total).  To reduce their influence on the analyses, any scores  with z values exceeding |3.29| were replaced with the next most extreme value, until they were  no longer considered outliers (Tabachnick & Fiddell, 1996).  Two data points were changed for  the age of first intercourse variable three data points were changed for the number of lifetime  sexual partners variable and one data point was changed for the FSFI total variable.  Variable  distributions were then screened for normality.  Skewness and kurtosis for all variables were in  the acceptable range (below |2| and |7|, respectively), indicating that variables were normally  distributed (West, Finch, & Curran, 1995).  Descriptive Statistics  Demographic information.  Descriptive data on participants' demographic information,  as well as gender comparisons, are presented in Table 1.  Male participants were significantly  older than female participants, with 19.39 (SD = 1.67) years as the overall mean age of  participants.  A large proportion of participants identified as White (33.5%), Black (14.5%), or  reported two or more ethnic groups (27.9%).  Most participants identified as heterosexual, with a  significantly higher proportion of females identifying as gay/lesbian or bisexual than males.  In  terms of education, the majority of youth had completed grades 10 or 11.  CSA and motivations for sex.  Of the total sample, 41.9% reported a history of CSA.  A  significantly greater proportion of females compared to males reported a history of CSA (62.7% 
2  versus 26.9%),   (1) = 22.87, p < .001.  Mean scores and gender comparisons for participants' 

motivations for sex are presented in Table 2.  Mean scores from a community sample of sexually  experienced adolescents, reported in the Cooper et al. (1998) study, are also presented in Table 2.

The mean scores for the present study were within one standard deviation of the means for  Cooper et al. however, the means did appear to be slightly higher on the sex for coping and sex  for partner's approval subscales.  In the present study, males reported significantly higher scores  on the motivations to have sex for coping subscale than females.  No gender differences were  found in the motivations to have sex for enhancement subscale or the motivations to have sex for  partner approval subscale.  Sexual risk behaviours.  Descriptive data on the sexual risk behaviours examined in the  present study (age of first intercourse, number of lifetime sex partners, and sex trading), and  other sexual risk behaviours are presented in Table 3.  Comparisons between male and female  participants on CSA and sexual risk behaviours are also presented in Table 3.  The vast majority  (95.1%) of both male and female youth in this sample were sexually active.  Among sexually  active youth, the average age of first intercourse was 14.11 years (SD = 2.93), with no significant  gender differences.  Whereas males reported significantly more lifetime sex partners than  females, females were significantly more likely to have ever engaged in sex trading or to have  had a past STI.  Within the past six months, youth reported a mean of approximately four sexual  partners, with a large proportion of both male and female youth (63.9%) reporting UVI in the  past six months.  Compared to females, males were significantly more likely to report drug use  during their last sexual encounter.  Sexual functioning.  Descriptive data on the sexual functioning of male youth are  presented in Table 4.  Comparative data from a community Norwegian sample of men aged 20  29 (Mykletun et al., 2006) are also presented in Table 4.  Although no statistical comparisons  were conducted, total BSFI scores among youth in the present sample were within one standard

deviation of the mean total BSFI scores among men in the normative sample.  This suggests that  the male homeless youth in this study demonstrated normal levels of sexual functioning.  Descriptive data on the sexual functioning of female youth are presented in Table 5.  Comparative data from a crossvalidation study of adult women with and without sexual  dysfunction (Wiegel et al., 2005) are also presented in Table 5.  Across all subscales, mean  sexual functioning scores in the present sample fell below scores of adult women without sexual  dysfunction (indicating poorer sexual functioning than adult women without sexual dysfunction),  but above scores of adult women with a diagnosis of female sexual arousal disorder and pain  disorder (indicating better sexual functioning than adult women with sexual dysfunction).  Based  on a clinical cutoff of 26.55 for FSFI total score (Wiegel et al., 2005), half the sample (50.7%)  selfreported sexual dysfunction.  This suggests that these youth should be considered for further  assessment (Wiegel et al., 2005).  Model 1: Motivations for Sex as Mediators in the Relationship between CSA and Sexual  Risk Behaviours  Before the study hypotheses were tested, the associations between demographic variables  (shelter, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and education) and sexual risk behaviours (age of first  intercourse, number of lifetime sexual partners, and sex trading) were explored.   Among  females, sexual orientation was associated with age of first intercourse, F(2, 72) = 6.12, p = .001,  and number of lifetime sexual partners, F(2, 72) = 3.94, p = .02.  LSD post hoc tests revealed  that bisexual youth reported a significantly earlier age of first intercourse (M = 12.44, SD = 3.69)  than heterosexual youth (M = 15.02, SD = 2.20), mean difference = 2.58, SE = 0.75, p = .001,  95% CI = [1.08, 4.08].  Further, lesbian youth reported significantly higher numbers of lifetime  sex partners (M = 19.33, SD = 18.26) than heterosexual youth (M = 8.55, SD = 8.46), mean

LSD post hoc tests revealed that gay  male youth (M = 0.50, SD = 0.71) were significantly more likely than heterosexual youth (M =  0.04, SD = 0.20) to report lifetime involvement in sex trading, mean difference = 0.46, SE =  0.16, p = .005, 95% CI = [0.14, 0.77].

CSA was not associated with number of  lifetime sex partners, sex trading, or other sexual risk behaviours.  Therefore, only age of first  intercourse was examined as a dependent variable in subsequent mediation analyses for females.

The moderating effect of sexual orientation was examined in the relationship between CSA and sexual risk 

behaviours (age of first intercourse, lifetime sexual partners, and sex trading).  Among females, no interactions were  found between CSA and sexual orientation in predicting any sexual risk behaviours.  Among males, a significant  interaction was found between CSA and sexual orientation in predicting sex trading, F(2, 98) = 5.67, p = .005.  However, only one gay male and one bisexual male (both with a history of CSA) reported past involvement in sex  trading.  Therefore, although statistically significant, these results may not be clinically significant.

associated with any of the additional sexual health variables (past STI, pregnancy/impregnation,  and sexual risk behaviours in the past six months) among male or female homeless youth.  Hypothesis #1b: A history of CSA will be associated with motivations for sex.  Among females, individuals with a history of CSA reported higher scores on the sex for coping  subscale (M = 2.13, SD = 1.20) than individuals without a history of CSA (M = 1.57, SD = 0.97),  t(73) = 2.08, p = .04, 95% CI = [1.09, 0.02].  As well, females with a history of CSA reported  higher scores on the sex for partner approval subscale (M = 2.15, SD = 1.23) compared to  females without a history of CSA (M = 1.45, SD = 0.69), t(72.75) = 3.17, p = .002, 95% CI =  [1.14, 0.26].  CSA was not associated with sex for enhancement.  Therefore, sex for coping and  sex for partner approval were included as mediators in subsequent mediation analyses for  females.  Similarly, among males, individuals with a history of CSA reported higher scores on the  sex for coping subscale (M = 2.85, SD = 1.35) than individuals without a history of CSA (M =  2.13, SD = 2.13), t(102) = 2.81, p = .006, 95% CI = [1.24, 0.21].  As well, males with a history  of CSA reported higher scores on the sex for partner approval subscale (M = 2.56, SD = 1.47)  compared to males without a history of CSA (M = 1.70, SD = 0.94), t(35.41) = 2.90, p = .006,  95% CI = [1.47, 0.26].  CSA was not associated with sex for enhancement.  Therefore, sex for  coping and sex for partner approval were included as mediators in subsequent mediation  analyses for males.  Hypothesis #1c: Controlling for a history of CSA, motivations for sex will be  significantly associated with sexual risk behaviours.  For females, controlling for a history of  CSA, sex for partner approval was associated with earlier age of first intercourse (see Table 6),  but sex for coping was not (see Table 7).  Therefore, only sex for partner approval was examined

in subsequent analyses.  For males, controlling for a history of CSA, neither sex for partner  approval (see Table 8) nor sex for coping (see Table 9) were associated with sex trading.  Therefore, no further mediation analyses were conducted among males.  Hypothesis #1d: Controlling for motivations for sex, there will be a significant  reduction in the relationship between CSA and sexual risk behaviours.  Among females, the  Sobel test of mediation indicated that sex for partner approval mediated the relationship between  history of CSA and earlier age of sexual intercourse (test statistic = 1.95, p = .05).  The  relationship between CSA and age of first sexual intercourse was no longer significant when  controlling for sex for partner approval (see Figure 3), suggesting full mediation.

Model 2: Motivations for Sex as Mediators in the Relationship between CSA and Sexual  Functioning Problems  As a result of missing data in the sexual functioning measures (six FSFI total scores and  three BSFI total scores), the total sample size for Model 2 decreased from 179 participants to 170  participants (69 females and 101 males).  Before the study hypotheses were examined, the  association between demographic variables and sexual functioning subscales was explored.  Among females, age was negatively associated with desire (r = 0.25, p < .05), arousal (r =   0.29, p < .05), and satisfaction (r = 0.25, p < .05).  Sexual orientation was associated with  desire, F(2, 66) = 4.11, p = .02, with lesbian youth (M = 4.90, SD = 0.70) reporting higher scores  on the desire subscale than heterosexual youth (M = 3.77, SD = 1.33), mean difference = 1.13,  SE = 0.55, p = .04, 95% CI = [0.04, 2.22].  Bisexual youth (M = 4.66, SD = 1.18) also reported  higher scores on the desire subscale than heterosexual youth, mean difference = 0.89, SE = 0.39,  p = .03, 95% CI = [0.11, 1.68].  Therefore, age and sexual orientation were included as  covariates in subsequent mediation analyses for females.  Among males, ethnic background was associated with problem assessment (i.e., overall  perception of sexual functioning), F(6, 94) = 2.28, p = .04.  East/Southeast Asian youth (M =  2.11, SD = 0.55) reported worse problem assessment than White youth (M = 3.48, SD = 0.17  mean difference = 1.36, SE = 0.57, p = .02, 95% CI = [0.23, 2.50], Aboriginal youth (M = 3.73,  SD = 0.42), mean difference = 1.62, SE = 0.69, p = .02, 95% CI = [0.25, 3.00], and youth with  two or more ethnic backgrounds (M = 3.52, SE = 0.20), mean difference = 1.41, SE = 0.58, p =  .02, 95% CI = [0.26, 2.56].  In addition, youth identifying as "other" (M = 2.84, SD = 0.22)  reported worse problem assessment than White youth (mean difference = 0.63, SE = 0.28, p =  .03, 95% CI = [0.08, 1.18]) and youth with two or more ethnic backgrounds, mean difference =

39 

0.68, SE = 0.30, p = .03, 95% CI = [0.09, 1.27].  No other demographic variables were associated  with BSFI subscales.  Therefore, only ethnic background was included as a covariate in  subsequent mediation analyses for males.  Hypothesis #1a: A history of CSA will be associated with sexual functioning  problems.  Among females, controlling for age and sexual orientation, CSA was not associated  with any FSFI subscales or the total score.  Among males, controlling for ethnic background,  CSA was not associated with any BSFI subscales or the total score.  Given that the initial  hypotheses were not supported, no further mediation analyses were conducted.  Discussion  To date, this is the first study to examine motivations for sex as mediators in the  relationships between CSA and sexual risk behaviours, and CSA and sexual functioning  problems.  In a sample of 179 homeless youth living in a large Canadian city, CSA was  associated with motivations for sex and sexual risk behaviours.  Motivations to have sex for  partner approval mediated the relationship between CSA history and earlier age of first  intercourse among female youth.  Sex for coping was associated with CSA among male and  female youth.   Sex for enhancement was not associated with CSA.  When controlling for a  history of CSA, neither sex for coping nor sex for enhancement were associated with sexual risk  behaviours among male or female youth.  No associations were found between CSA and sexual  functioning problems in either males or female youth.  Comparisons between the Present Sample of Homeless Youth and Other Samples in the  Study's Dependent Variables  Sexual risk behaviours and sexual health outcomes.  Consistent with past research on  homeless youth, youth in the present sample exhibited a range of sexual risk behaviours and

40 

adverse sexual health outcomes.  Regarding sexual risk behaviours, 95% reported past  intercourse, which is equal to the estimate among homeless youth in ESYS (PHAC, 2006).  The  prevalence of sexual activity among homeless youth appears to be significantly higher than the  prevalence among youth in the general Canadian population, in which 43% of youth aged 15 to  19 reported having sexual intercourse at least once (Rotermann, 2008).  The mean age of first  intercourse in this study was 14 years, which is equal to estimates reported in other Canadian  studies of homeless youth (PHAC, 2006 Roy et al., 2000), but younger than the mean age of  first intercourse reported in the general youth population (16.8 years Hansen et al., 2004).  Many  youth reported engaging in HIVrelated sexual risk behaviours in the past six months, including  UVI (63.9%) and UAI (14%).  Although both male and female youth reported high numbers of  lifetime sexual partners, males reported more lifetime sexual partners, consistent with past  studies (e.g., MacKellar et al., 2000 PHAC, 2006).  The overall lifetime prevalence of sex trading in this study (12.3%) was lower than  lifetime rates in other Canadian and U.S. studies of homeless youth, which range from 21.2%  46.6% (Ennett, Bailey et al., 1999 Greene et al., 1999 Halcón & Lifson, 2004 Kral et al., 1997  PHAC, 2006 Roy et al., 2000 Weber et al., 2002).  One possible explanation for this  discrepancy is that participants in the present study were recruited exclusively from residential  programs at homeless youth shelters, whereas other studies included homeless youth living on  the streets and in shelters.  Past research has demonstrated that youth living in shelters report  significantly lower rates of sex trading than youth living on the streets (10% versus 28%,  respectively Greene et al., 1999).  Compared to youth in shelters, youth living on the streets may  have less access to subsistence resources, such as food and shelter, and may therefore be more  likely to engage in sex trading to gain access to these resources (Tyler & Johnson, 2006).

41 

Accordingly, it is possible that this study underestimates the true prevalence of sex trading  among homeless youth.  Regarding sexual health outcomes, consistent with the previous literature (e.g., PHAC,  2006), a large proportion of homeless youth, particularly females, reported past STIs.  Moreover,  in the present sample, the majority of males (51.7%) and females (58.9%) reported past  pregnancy or impregnation.  Prevalence of pregnancy/impregnation in this study was even higher  than other studies of homeless youth (e.g., 32.2%, Greene & Ringwalt, 1998 47.1% of females  and 35.6% of males, Roy et al., 2000) and drastically higher than reported rates among youth in  the general population (e.g., 3.0% of females and 1.7% of males, Boyce et al., 2006).  Sexual functioning.  With regards to sexual functioning, male youth scored within the  normal range relative to adult men in the general population.  Conversely, half of the female  youth in this sample were below the FSFI diagnostic cutoff score, indicating a high risk for  clinically significant sexual dysfunction.  These apparent gender differences are consistent with  past research examining the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the general adult population.  Specifically, in a nationally representative U.S. sample, sexual problems were more prevalent  among females compared to males, and most common among young women and older men  (Laumann et al., 1999).  Laumann et al. (1999) posited that young women, who are more likely  to be single than older women, may experience instability in their sexual lives, including higher  partner turnover rates and periodic episodes of sexual inactivity.  This lack of stability, along  with less sexual experience, provides the basis for sexual pain and anxiety.  Further, they noted  that, among males, sexual dysfunction increases with age as a result of physiological changes  associated with aging, which may lead to low sexual desire and erection problems.  Although  these explanations offer some clarification for the differential prevalence rates of sexual

42 

dysfunction among adult males and females throughout the lifetime, they have not been  examined empirically, particularly among youth.  Further, Laumann et al. did not specifically  address why females experience higher prevalence rates of sexual dysfunction overall.  The proportion of female homeless youth in this sample who were at high risk for sexual  dysfunction is higher than the proportion reported in a community sample of sexually active  adult women aged 3079 (38.4% Lutfey, Link, Rosen, Wiegel, & McKinlay, 2009), but lower  than the proportion reported in a sample of female medical students (63% mean age = 24, SD =  2 Shindel, Ferguson, Nelson, & Brandes, 2008).  Comparisons between homeless youth and  youth in the general population cannot be drawn given that no research has examined the  prevalence of sexual dysfunction in any youth populations.  Thus, more research is needed to  determine prevalence rates, predictors, and possible gender differences of sexual functioning  among homeless youth, as well as among youth in the general population.  CSA and Sexual Health Outcomes  Prevalence of CSA was high in this sample.  Consistent with past studies, a greater  proportion of females (62.7%) compared to males (26.9%) reported a history of CSA.  Overall  rates of CSA (41.9%) in this study were comparable to those reported in past studies of homeless  youth (e.g., 40% Molnar et al., 1998) and significantly higher than estimates in the general  population (5.8%34% among females 2%11% among males Walker et al., 2004).  CSA and sexual risk behaviours.  As hypothesized, a history of CSA was associated  with sexual risk behaviours, including earlier age of first intercourse among females and  increased involvement in sex trading among males.  However, these results only partially support  the hypothesis that CSA would be associated with sexual risk behaviours (earlier age of first  intercourse, higher number of lifetime sexual partners, and increased sex trading) among male

43 

and female homeless youth.  Nevertheless, findings are consistent with other studies of highrisk  youth which have found that CSA is associated with some, but not all, sexual risk behaviours.  For example, among incarcerated youth, a history of CSA was associated with earlier age of first  intercourse among females and a decreased likelihood of using contraception among both males  and females.  However, no differences were found between youth with and without a history of  CSA on pregnancy/parenthood or number of sexual partners (Mason, Zimmerman, & Evans,  1998).  In addition, although CSA has been found to strongly predict sexual risk behaviours  among homeless youth, there may be other important factors to consider when examining sexual  health outcomes in this population.  For example, past research has shown that contextual factors  related to homelessness (duration of homelessness, stability and quality of housing, access to  financial resources, and utilization of social services e.g., Ennett, Federman, Bailey, Ringwalt,  & Hubbard, 1999) and other psychological factors (e.g., social support, emotional difficulties,  and substance use) may also account for the sexual risk behaviours practised by homeless youth  (e.g., Ennett, Bailey et al., 1999).  These factors, which may impact all homeless youth  regardless of CSA history, might help to explain why CSA history was not an independent  predictor of all sexual health outcomes.  CSA and sexual functioning problems.  The finding that CSA was not associated with  sexual functioning problems in this sample is consistent with selected studies of adult males,  which reported that CSA does not influence sexual functioning (e.g., Najman et al., 2005 Sarwer  et al., 1997).  However, it does not support the literature indicating that CSA leads to sexual  functioning problems among adult males (Laumann et al., 1999) and females (e.g., DiLillo,  2001 Leonard & Follette, 2002 Loeb et al., 2002).  To date, the research examining the

44 

association between CSA and sexual functioning among adolescents has been very limited.  The  scant literature that has explored this association has focused primarily on the impact of CSA on  sexual risk behaviours (e.g., Loeb et al., 2002), without exploring sexual functioning per se.  Further, the few studies that have focused more specifically on sexual functioning problems  among youth (e.g., sexual dissatisfaction, unwanted sexual thoughts and feelings) only included  individuals with a history of CSA, with no comparison group (Feiring et al., 2009 Simon &  Feiring, 2008).  Therefore, it is difficult to assess whether the association between CSA and  sexual functioning, which has been wellestablished among female adults, is present among  adolescents.  When examining the association between CSA and sexual functioning problems  specifically among males, there are a number of important issues to consider.  First, past research  has demonstrated that other childhood abuse variables (e.g., emotional and physical abuse and  neglect, disruptive family environment) may be even more important than CSA in predicting  sexual functioning problems (Colman & Widom, 2004 Kinzl, Mangweth, Traweger, & Biebl,  1996, Meston, Heiman, & Trapnell, 1999).  For example, in one study of 1,032 undergraduate  students, childhood emotional abuse was associated with sexual functioning problems among  males, whereas CSA was not (Meston et al., 1999).  In addition, a number of researchers have  suggested that gender differences in the impact of CSA on sexual functioning may be a result of  differential reactions to CSA experiences.  Specifically, compared to females, males have  reported more positive reactions to CSA (Dhaliwal, Gauzas, Antonowicz, & Ross, 1996 Rind,  Tromovitch, & Bauserman, 1998) and have been less likely to regard themselves as victims of  CSA, particularly if the perpetrator was female (Stander, Olson, & Merrill, 2002).  Nevertheless,  the nature of CSA is critical to consider, as intrafamilial abuse experiences have been found to

45 

negatively impact sexual functioning among males, in spite of initial positive reactions (Kelly,  Wood, Gonzalez, MacDonald, & Waterman, 2002).  Taken together, the research suggests that a  more comprehensive exploration of childhood abuse experiences, family environment, and  perceptions of abuse may be necessary to consider when examining the association between  CSA and male sexual functioning.  CSA and Motivations for Sex  In their theoretical model explaining the pathways from CSA to adverse sexual health  outcomes, Finkelhor and Browne (1985) suggested that CSA may disrupt normal sexual  development and lead children to develop skewed sexual perceptions of sexuality, sexual norms,  and sexual behaviour.  This study supports the traumatic sexualization model by highlighting  differences between youth who had and had not experienced CSA in their motivations to engage  in sex.  Both males and females with a history of CSA reported stronger motivations to engage in  sex to gain their partners' approval than did males and females without a history of CSA.  As  suggested by past research (Finkelhor & Browne, 1985), it is possible that children, through their  relationships with abusers, may learn to associate sex with love and affection, and may come to  believe that sex is a necessary act in order to obtain a partner's approval.  This was demonstrated  in one study of adult women with a history of CSA, in which 86% endorsed the statement, "No  man could care for me without a sexual relationship" (Jehu, Glazen, & Klassen, 1985).  Further,  it has been suggested that individuals with a history of CSA may perceive their roles in sexual  relationships as submissive, in which their goal is to please their partner regardless of their  personal desire (Maltz & Holman, 1987).

46 

Sex to cope with negative mood was also associated with CSA in this study.  This finding  supports the work by Briere (1996), who suggested that individuals who have experienced CSA  may engage in sexual behaviours as a tensionreduction strategy.  He posited that, in the short  term, sexual contact may serve to alleviate emotional distress by soothing painful feelings,  providing a temporary distraction, eliciting positive responses from others, and restoring a sense  of control.  Polusny and Follette (1995) proposed a similar model which states that individuals  with a history of CSA may attempt to avoid the emotions and memories associated with the  abuse by engaging in coping behaviours (e.g., sexual behaviour).  Overall, although these  theories lack extensive empirical support, they help to clarify why youth who have experienced  CSA may be more motivated toward sexual behaviour in order to please their partners and cope  with negative mood.  Motivations for Sex as Mediators in the Relationship between CSA and Sexual Health  Outcomes The hypothesis that motivations for sex would mediate the relationship between CSA  and sexual risk behaviours was partially supported.  Motivations to have sex for partner approval  completely mediated the relationship between CSA and earlier age of first intercourse among  females however motivations for sex did not mediate the relationship between CSA and sex  trading among males.  This discrepancy may be attributable to the different sexual risk  behaviours with which CSA was associated across genders.  Specifically, among female youth in  this sample, CSA was associated with earlier age of first intercourse ­ a sexual behaviour that  has been directly linked to sexual motivations in past literature (Cooper et al., 1998).  In contrast,  among male youth in this sample, CSA was associated with sex trading ­ a sexual behaviour  which is strongly linked to the context of street life (Greene et al., 1999) and has not been

47 

directly linked to sexual motivations in past literature.  Therefore, it is possible that the  relationship between CSA and sex trading may be more related to contextual factors, rather than  internal motivations.  For example, homeless youth with a history of CSA are more likely to  leave home at a younger age (Tyler, Hoyt, Whitbeck, & Cauce, 2001), and a longer duration of  homelessness increases the likelihood of engaging in a range of sexual risk behaviours (Rew,  Grady, Whittaker, & Bowman, 2008).  Thus, future studies examining the pathways from CSA  to sex trading may benefit from exploring more contextual factors, including contextuallybased  motivations for sex (e.g., sex to gain food or shelter, sex a means of survival, etc.), which may  more directly impact involvement in this highrisk sexual behaviour.  Results from the present study indicate that female youth with a history of CSA engage in  sexual intercourse at younger ages than nonabused youth due to an increased concern about  pleasing their partners.  This finding provides further evidence to support past theory and  research on the interpersonal effects of CSA (e.g., Finkelhor & Browne, 1985 see Davis &  PetreticJackson, 2000 for a review).  In line with the theory of traumatic sexualization,  researchers have suggested that CSA may lead to an "oversexualization" of relationships, in  which individuals regard nonsexual relationships as sexual and believe that sex is necessary in  order to achieve intimacy and affection within relationships (Davis & PetreticJackson, 2000).  Therefore, it is possible that youth who have experienced CSA may be more likely than their  peers to regard friendships or relationships, which would otherwise be viewed as nonsexual or  platonic, as inappropriately sexual.  Further, once in a sexual situation, an excessive concern to  please one's partner may result in decreased assertiveness and increased potential for engaging in  sexual intercourse.

Other Possible Mediators in the Relationship Between CSA and Sexual Health Outcomes  Motivations for sex to please one's partner mediated the relationship between CSA and  earlier age of first intercourse however, none of the other proposed motivations appeared to  mediate the relationship between CSA and sexual risk behaviours.  This suggests that there are  other pathways, aside from motivations for sex, which may lead individuals with a history of  CSA to experience adverse sexual health outcomes.  One study examined the role of disinhibition in the relationship between CSA and HIV  related risk behaviours (unprotected sex and substance use) among U.S. innercity Black youth  (Bornovalova, Gwadz, Kahler, Aklin, & Lejuez, 2008).  Findings demonstrated that two aspects  of disinhibition (sensation seeking and risktaking propensity) mediated the relationship between  CSA and risk behaviours.  The authors offered a neuropsychological explanation for these  findings and suggested that traumatic childhood experiences such as CSA may lead to  neurochemical dysregulation, which may, in turn, impact behavioural inhibition and regulation.  The role of cognition may also be an important mediator in the relationship between CSA  and sexual health outcomes.  Past studies have demonstrated that CSA may disrupt individuals'  cognitions about sexuality and sexual self schemas, which may subsequently affect their sexual  behaviour and functioning (Meston & Heiman, 2000 Meston et al., 2006 Reissing et al., 2003).  A recent sixyear longitudinal study reported that, among youth with a history of CSA, self  stigmatization (i.e., abusespecific shame and selfblame) predicted subsequent sexual  difficulties (Feiring et al., 2009).  The authors suggested that shame and selfblame that arises  from CSA experiences may disrupt the development of positive sexual selfschemas, thus  impacting sexual behaviours, functioning, and relationships.

49 

Experiential avoidance has also been proposed as an outcome of CSA, and another  possible mediator between CSA and negative sexual health outcomes.  Experiential avoidance  refers to an unwillingness to experience painful internal events and results in a range of  behaviours (e.g., dissociation, substance use, selfharm, and sexual behaviours) aimed at  avoiding adverse thoughts, emotions, and memories that are linked to a trauma (Briere, 1996  Leonard et al., 2008 Polusny & Follette, 1995).  In one study of adult females with a history of  CSA, experiential avoidance was associated with sexual dissatisfaction when controlling for  relationship satisfaction.  Although this study did not examine the mediating role of experiential  avoidance, the results suggested that it may be an important variable to explore in future research  (Leonard et al., 2008).  Limitations and Future Directions  There are a number of limitations to the present study.  First, participants were recruited  exclusively from residential programs at homeless youth shelters in Toronto and may not be  representative of all homeless youth.  Nevertheless, in ESYS, the highest proportion of  homeless youth spent the night in a shelter compared to other sites (e.g., streets, parks, relatives',  or partners' places of residence PHAC, 2006).  This suggests that the present sample likely  represented a large proportion of homeless youth in Canada.  However, future studies would  benefit from recruiting homeless youth from additional sites, including streets, parks, and other  organizations servicing homeless youth, in order to increase generalizability of findings.  Another limitation was the use of retrospective selfreport measures.  A history of CSA  was determined based on CTQSF scores and was not substantiated.  As well, many of the sexual  behaviour questions focused on past experiences.  This introduces the possibility of recall bias  given that participants may have inaccurately recalled past events.  Selfreport measures of

50 

motivations for sex may also raise concerns, given that it may be difficult for youth to accurately  comment on the reasons for why they engage in intercourse.  For example, some youth may be  engaging in sex for reasons that they are not aware of or that are not being assessed in the current  study (e.g., sex to gain food, money, or shelter).  Future research examining collateral evidence  of youths' motivations for sex is warranted to demonstrate the validity of these selfreport  measures.  Response bias may have also threatened the validity of the results.  Given the  personal nature of study measures, which were completed in a group setting, it is possible that  participants responded to questions in a socially desirable rather than accurate manner.  In order  to maximize honest selfdisclosure, future studies may wish to administer questionnaires in  confidential oneonone settings.  As well, inclusion of qualitative interviews may provide more  comprehensive accounts of individuals' experiences and perceptions.  The crosssectional nature of this study further limits the interpretation of findings.  Although this study presents correlations between variables at a single time point, it does not  provide information about the predictive or causal nature of variables.  For example, when  interpreting the finding that sex for partner approval motivations mediates the relationship  between CSA and age of first intercourse among females, it is important to note that many of the  youth had their first sexual experiences years before participation in this study.  Specifically, the  mean age of first sexual intercourse was 14.11 (SD = 2.93) and the mean age of participants was  19.39 (SD = 1.67).  Therefore, we are unable to determine whether individuals' motivations to  have sex preceded their first sexual experience.  Cooper et al. (1998) indicated that there may be  a bidirectional relationship between motivations and behaviour.  Thus, although motivations to  have sex to please one's partner may have influenced individuals to engage in sexual intercourse

51 

at a younger age, it is also possible that engaging in sexual intercourse at a younger age may  have influenced individuals' sexual motivations.  Future studies should examine these associations using a longitudinal design in order to  demonstrate the temporal effects of CSA on motivations for sex and sexual behaviours and  functioning.  The design of these studies would differ depending on the population of interest  (i.e., homeless youth versus youth in the general population).  Ideally, participants would be  recruited for baseline assessment directly following substantiated CSA experiences, and would  be followed up at various intervals (e.g., one year and six years postabuse Feiring et al., 2009).  The study would also include agematched controls, consisting of individuals without a history  of CSA, in order to assess the direct impact of CSA on motivations for sex and sexual health  outcomes.  This type of study design could be feasible among youth in the general population,  and would provide a great deal of insight into the mechanisms underlying the relationship  between CSA and sexual health outcomes.  However, given that CSA is likely to precede  homelessness (PHAC, 2006 Rew et al., 2001), this type of study design would be difficult to  implement in a sample of homeless youth.  Among homeless youth, longitudinal studies might  involve tracking the motivations and sexual behaviours of individuals at various time points  (e.g., baseline, one year, and three year followup), in order to investigate how factors related to  homelessness (e.g., time on the streets, living conditions, social support) interact with CSA  experiences to predict motivations for sex and subsequent sexual risk behaviours and sexual  functioning.  It is important to note, however, that longitudinal research among homeless youth  may be quite challenging given the transient nature of this population.  Although there was a large effect size for the relationship between CSA and sex trading  among male youth in this sample (Chinn, 2000), there may be some concern regarding the

52 

reliability of this finding.  Of the 104 males, only six (5.8%) reported past involvement in sex  trading, of whom five (83.3%) reported a history of CSA.  As a result of the small sample size,  the confidence interval for the odds ratio for this relationship was very large, which raises  concern regarding the reliability of the effect size.  Nevertheless, this finding may have important  clinical implications as it suggests that CSA is a powerful predictor of sex trading among a small  proportion of male homeless youth.  Future studies should include a larger sample size in order  to replicate this finding and to further explore which youth may be particularly at risk for sex  trading and other poor sexual health outcomes.  Risk of TypeI error is also a concern in the present study given the large number of  variables that were examined (one independent variable, three mediators, up to six dependent  variables, and up to two covariates).  This risk could have been reduced by setting a more  conservative p value (e.g.,  = .01).  Although this was not initially conceived, the major study  findings (see Table 6) remained statistically significant at  < .01.  Thus, it is unlikely that these  findings were due to TypeI error.  Finally, this study did not examine a range of developmental, individual, and contextual  variables that may impact the sexual health of homeless youth.  For example, information  regarding the specific characteristics of CSA (e.g., severity of abuse, age of abuse, relationship to  perpetrator) and the presence of childhood emotional and physical abuse, which have been  identified as important correlates of sexual health outcomes (e.g., Arata, 2000 CinqMars,  Wright, McDuff, 2004 Finkelhor & Browne, 1986 Greene et al., 1999), was not included.  In  addition, this study did not examine factors such as early family environment, social support  networks, and past and current mental health status, which may play an important role in the  motivations and behaviours of homeless youth.  Inclusion of these variables was beyond the

53 

scope of the present study however, they may be important to consider when conducting larger  scale studies in this area.  Implications  Despite limitations, the present study has a number of strengths.  Data were collected at  five homeless youth shelters throughout the Greater Toronto Area, including the downtown area  and surrounding suburbs.  Therefore, this study provides information about the sexual health of  homeless youth living in a range of areas within a major Canadian urban centre.  Further, this  study contributes to the literature in a number of ways.  Although the association between CSA  and sexual risk behaviours among homeless youth has been examined in a number of studies,  this was the first study to date to explore the relationship between CSA and sexual functioning in  homeless youth.  Further, there is a dearth of literature examining the mechanisms underlying the  relationship between CSA and negative sexual health outcomes, particularly among homeless  youth.  This study built upon past literature by providing insight into the impact of CSA on  motivations, and the mechanisms by which CSA leads to negative sexual health outcomes in this  vulnerable population.  This study may have important clinical implications in improving the health and quality  of life among homeless youth in Canada.  Results from this study suggest that targeting  motivations to have sex for partner approval may be of potential value in HIV prevention and  intervention strategies that aim to reduce negative sexual health outcomes in this vulnerable  population.  For example, when working with youth who have experienced CSA, psycho  education regarding what constitutes healthy and fulfilling sexual behaviours and relationships  may help to correct individuals' maladaptive or skewed perceptions of sexuality and sexual  behaviours.  Sexual assertiveness and communication skills training may also benefit homeless

54 

youth by providing them with effective communication and safesex negotiation skills within the  context of sexual relationships (DiClemente & Wingood, 1995).  These techniques may enhance  preexisting motivationbased HIV risk reduction programs (e.g., Carey & Lewis, 1999) in order  to further improve sexual health outcomes among highrisk populations.  Summary  The present study suggests that homeless youth in Canada experience a range of adverse  sexual health outcomes related to their increased engagement in sexual risk behaviours.   A  history of CSA, which was very common within this sample, was associated with motivations for  sex and sexual risk behaviours.  Further, motivations to have sex for partner approval mediated  the relationship between CSA and earlier age of first intercourse among females.  CSA was not  associated with sexual functioning problems among male or female homeless youth in this  sample.  This study may guide future prevention and intervention strategies by highlighting the  importance of targeting motivations for sex in the reduction of adverse sexual health outcomes  among homeless youth in Canada.
