Public Participation in Nuclear Waste Management: A Comparative Analysis of the Swedish and Canadian Processes Rosanne Camacho Environmental Applied Science and Management Masters o f Applied Science, Ryerson University, 2005

This thesis addresses the issue o f public participation in the implementation o f nuclear waste management (NWM) strategies by comparing the NWM programs of Sweden and Canada. It begins with a comparison of the progress and current status of the Swedish and Canadian NWM programs, which illustrates that the Swedish program is further ahead in terms of obtaining approval for a disposal method. Next, quantitative analyses were performed on three measures of public engagement, which revealed that the proponents o f Sweden's NWM program have focused on public participation much more their Canadian counterparts. Lastly, a comparison was made between the level of public awareness regarding nuclear waste and public support for the NWM programs of each country. The analyses indicated that there is a greater level o f both public awareness o f the nuclear waste issue and public support for the NWM program in Sweden than there is in Canada.

1.1

Background and Context

N uclear w aste managem ent is a significant problem faced b y all nations that em ploy a nuclear energy industry. The question o f what to do with the highly radioactive waste

produced by commercial nuclear generators has been deliberated for the past several decades (Carter, 1987; Dunlap et al., 1993; Flynn et al., 1992; Gerrard, 1994; Easterling and Kunreuther, 1995; Kemp, 1992; Kunreuther et al., 1988; Murdock et al., 1983; Rabe, 1994; Slovic et al., 1991). Yet, despite the, in some cases, billions o f dollars that have been spent on siting attempts (Freudenburg, 2004; Gerrard, 1994), no country has yet been able to implement a permanent nuclear fuel waste disposal facility (Kraft, 2000; Krauskopf, 1990; Kuhn and Murphy, 2001; Rabe, 1994).

Nuclear pow er provides numerous benefits such as relatively cheap electricity, economic development and employment for the benefit o f society. It currently produces approximately 16% o f the w orld's electricity, with over 440 nuclear power reactors operating in 31 countries, and a total capacity o f over 360,000 M W e (World Nuclear Association, 2004). Seventeen countries currently rely on nuclear energy for at least a quarter o f their electricity needs (WNA, 2004); while in France over 75% o f the electricity is generated by nuclear energy (W ilson, 1996). The reliance on nuclear energy to produce electricity has increased steadily over the past thirty years (Figure 1).

On the other hand, nuclear power production creates, as a by-product, nuclear wastes that will rem ain toxic and dangerously radioactive for thousands o f years (Flynn et al., 1995).

Although other sources o f power, such as coal, oil, natural gas and hydro, present their own problems, it is said that none are as controversial as those presented by nuclear energy (Carter, 1987). Furthermore, although there have been issues identified in all stages o f the nuclear fuel cycle, the disposal of nuclear wastes is considered by far the most "controversial and contentious area o f nuclear policy" (Lidskog and Sundqvist, 2004, pg. 252).

In most countries, spent nuclear fuel along with other high-level waste (HLW) is placed in interim storage in facilities located at nuclear reactor sites (Decamps et al., 1997). Although this current method is expected to be safe for a lengthy period (Flynn et al., 1992), many countries are now looking towards geological disposal as a final solution to the problem o f nuclear waste (Flynn et al., 1995; Carter, 1987; CEAA; 1998; Decamps et al., 1997; Soloway, 2003). In the United States, for instance, the need for a permanent solution to the problem o f

- 2

nuclear w aste becam e apparent during the m id-1970s when original plans for reprocessing spent fuel failed (Easterling and Kunreuther, 1995), while in Canada perm anent disposal was identified by an expert panel in 1977 to be the preferred m ethod, noting that the "waste should not be allowed to accumulate indefinitely in interim storage" (AECL, 1994, pg. 2).

Three reasons for constructing a geological repository have been presented by K rauskopf (1990): First, waste kept in containers near the earth's surface is always subject to massive release by acts o f nature -- violent storms or earthquakes -- or by sabotage, or by carelessness on the part o f those supposedly w atching over it. Second, if a m ethod o f disposal cannot be dem onstrated soon the nuclear energy industry is in deep trouble: opponents can claim that waste is an insoluble problem, hence that production o f m ore should be stopped at once. And third, in a m ore philosophical vein, the waste that we do not dispose o f now will remain as an unjustified burden for our children and grandchildren to cope w ith" (Krauskopf, 1990, pg. 249) K rau sk o pf s second argument is one that can repeatedly be found in literature. Flynn et al. (1992) have described the nuclear industry's fears o f a grim future should an effective m anagem ent program not be found. Other arguments that have been m ade for the case o f geological disposal include moral obligation. Carter (1997) for instance contends that the United States, being the nation that "started the nuclear endeavor", should lead the w orld in dealing w ith its dangerous by-products. Recent events, such as the Septem ber 11, 2001

attacks on the W orld Trade Center in New York City have also brought security issues to the forefront with respect to nuclear storage facilities, m ost o f which are located aboveground (Haussm an et al., 2003; Stone, 2004). This has prompted even greater consideration o f

geological disposal as a nuclear waste m anagem ent option, particularly in the United States w here the attacks prom pted Congress to approve Yucca M ountain as the country's repository site, despite the state o f N evada's objections (Stone, 2004). In fact, the elim ination o f

- 3 -

terrorism threats became one o f the US Department of Energy's primary arguments for a geological repository.

It has been widely documented that the failure to site facilities for nuclear and indeed, all hazardous waste in general, can be attributed to public opposition (Dunlap et al., 1993; Easterling and Kunreuther, 1995; Mine et al., 1997; Slovic et al., 1991). Gerrard (1994), for instance, reports that in 1975, the city of Minnesota was given $3.7 million by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to site a hazardous waste landfill, only to give it back three years later after it encountered significant local opposition at each o f the 16 potential sites that had been identified. Similarly, in 1990, protesters against a potential site o f a low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) repository in Allegany County, New York prevented state officials from proceeding to the site by erecting roadblocks and barricading a bridge (Inhaber, 1994). State officials in Nevada even filed lawsuits and attempted to create new legislation in an attempt to block the federal Department o f Energy from conducting suitability tests at Yucca Mountain, which had been identified as the site of geologic repository for the United States' spent nuclear waste (Easterling, 1992).

Early efforts to site nuclear waste repositories relied on technical solutions that were presented by government officials and nuclear authorities using the so-called DecideAnnounce-Defend (DAD) approach (Rabe, 1994). This "top-down" approach consisted of "a \ nonpublic process o f choosing a particular site, announcing this choice publicly, and then mounting whatever effort seems necessary to defend and secure approval of, or at least acquiescence to, this choice" (Munton, 1996, pg. 11). It is only in recent years that public support for a facility has been recognized as a necessity in the site selection process (Bjamadottir and Hilding-Rydevik, 2001; Freudenburg, 2004).

This study exam ines the nuclear waste m anagem ent strategies o f two different countries: Sweden and Canada. Particular attention is paid to Sw eden's efforts to engage the public in order to gain acceptance and support for its proposed nuclear waste disposal strategy, and w hat the effect these efforts have had on the progress o f its nuclear w aste siting process. Sweden was particularly chosen for this study as it is widely accepted that among nuclear producing nations, it is furthest along in siting a high-level radioactive waste (HLRW ) facility using a voluntary process. It is hoped that this research will provide valuable insight to other nations struggling with the nuclear w aste siting dilemma.

1.2

S ta te m e n t o f P roblem

Although large amounts o f money have been po u red into the scientific and engineering aspects o f high-level radioactive waste disposal, virtually nothing has been done to actively enlist the public in the siting process or to collaborate with the public in fo rg in g a solution. (Flynn et al., 1992, pg. 42)

The above statem ent illustrates the problem that this research addresses: to exam ine the role o f m eaningful public participation in the successful siting o f a nuclear waste repository. W hereas previous siting attempts have focused on providing a technological solution to the problem o f nuclear waste, it is only in recent years that policy-makers have begun to recognize the importance o f public acceptance in a successful siting strategy. This research addresses this problem by exam ining the m easures that have been taken by one country's nuclear authorities to engage and comm unicate w ith its citizenry regarding its nuclear waste disposal strategy.

This research can provide valuable insight on how to avoid future siting impasses. Although public opposition to the siting of nuclear waste facilities has become a fairly common topic in research literature (Brotzen, 1995; Flynn et a l, 1995; Freudenburg, 2004; Hine et al., 1997; Inhaber, 1991; Kraft, 2000; Kuhn, 1998; Kunreuther, 1996; Rabe, 2000; Slovic et a l, 1991), it continues to be a major problem for regulatory authorities in nations produeing nuclear waste. Understanding how one country has been able to gain acceptance o f a nuclear waste repository will provide valuable insight to other countries with nuclear waste programs. Indeed, it will likely prove useful in the siting o f any hazardous waste facility.

It is particularly relevant to Canada, where nearly thirty years o f research and development has yet to produce an acceptable permanent disposal solution (Hine et a l, 1997; Kuhn, 1998). Like many other nuclear countries, historically, Canada's nuclear establishment has focused its research on the scientific and technological aspects of a proposed geological repository, with little attention being paid to social science issues, despite the public's apprehension regarding nuclear issues (Summers and Hine, 1997). Prior to 2002, public participation with regards to nuclear waste management was rather limited, consisting mainly o f scoping meetings and public hearings, as per the requirements of the Canadian Environmental Assessment (EA) process.

In 1998, the Nuclear Fuel Waste Management and Disposal Concept Environmental Assessment (EA) Panel submitted its report to the Canadian government. Following the

Panel's finding that the concept submitted by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) was socially unacceptable, in 2002 the Canadian government passed the Nuclear Fuel Waste Act, which is considered a major step towards finding a solution to Canada's nuclear waste problem (NRCAN, 2002). This new legislation has created an entity from Canada's nuclear

producers, called the N uclear W aste M anagem ent Organization, w hose m andate is "to develop collaborât!vely w ith Canadians a managem ent approach for the long-term care o f C anada's used nuclear fuel that is socially acceptable, technically sound, environm entally responsible and econom ically feasible" (NW MO, 2003, pg. 2). The fact that the N W M O has em phasized a collaborative approach is another reason for choosing Sweden for this study. It w ould appear that the NW M O is cognizant o f the nature and level o f effort w ith respect to public participation that would be required to implement a successful nuclear waste m anagem ent program . This research will add to the N W M O 's understanding o f the m ost socially acceptable m ethod o f m anaging Canada's nuclear fuel waste. It can also provide valuable insight to the Government o f Canada on how best to implement the chosen m ethod.

1.3

Research Objectives

This thesis is based on a comparative analysis o f the public engagement aspect o f the nuclear w aste m anagem ent strategies o f two different countries: Sweden and Canada. W hile Canada has run into significant delays in implementing a perm anent disposal solution for its spent nuclear fuel, Sweden appears to have been m ore successful; applications to construct a nuclear w aste encapsulation plant and geologic repository are expected to be filed w ithin the next five years. The purpose o f this research is to determine the role o f effective public It is

engagement in a successful nuclear waste m anagem ent program and siting process. centered on the following three objectives:

1) to show that the Swedish nuclear authorities have emphasized the role o f public engagement in the developm ent and implementation o f its nuclear w aste disposal strategy;

- 7 -

2) to prove that the progress that has been made in Sweden towards siting a geological repository for spent nuclear fuel waste can be attributed to the public engagement ~L measures that the Swedish nuclear authorities have put in place; and 3) to demonstrate that the lack and/or inadequacy of these public engagement measures in the Canadian nuclear waste management program is accountable for the continued opposition to and consequent delay in siting a geological repository in Canada.

1.4

Organization of Thesis

This thesis is organized into five chapters. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the study, including the research context, problem and objectives. Background information is provided in Chapter 2, which includes information about the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste, as well as a description of the nuclear waste management strategies o f Sweden and Canada. I Chapter 2 also includes a review of the literature pertaining to the nuclear waste siting dilemma. In Chapter 3 methods employed by the study are outlined. The design o f this

research includes both a qualitative and quantitative component, with the study being conducted in three parts. The first part of the study, a qualitative comparison of the progress and current status of the nuclear waste management programs of Sweden and Canada, is based on a review of documents from a variety of primary and secondary sources. The second part of the analysis consists of a quantitative analysis of specific measures of public engagement. The data for this part of the study are derived mainly from primary sources. The third part of the study examines the effectiveness o f each country's public engagement activities using surveys on attitudes towards nuclear waste management. In Chapter 4 the

- 8

results o f the analyses conducted for this are presented.

The final chapter discusses the

results o f the analyses and presents the conclusions o f this research.

2.1

The Nuclear Fuel Cycle

The nuclear fuel cycle can be considered as having two stages, often referred to as the "front end" and the "back end" (WNA, 2001). The front end of the cycle consists o f the production o f nuclear fuel (Rouben, 1998).

Nuclear fuel is derived from uranium, a naturally radioactive element found in the earth's crust (WNA, 2001). Australia has the largest known reserves o f uranium, followed by

Kazakhstan and Canada (see Table 1). Canada, however, is the largest producer o f uranium, making up approximately 30% o f the world market (Rouben, 1998).

Uranium is mined as an ore, the most important being the oxides, pitchblende and uraninite, and the silicate coffinite (Ritcey, 1996). The mined ore is crushed and ground in a mill, then goes through a leaching process, using sulfuric acid, to produce uranium oxide (UgOg)

-10-

(Ritcey, 1996).

This form o f uranium ore concentrate (UOC), know n as yellowcake in

Canada, m ay contain 70-80% uranium by weight (Rouben, 1998). To produce the actual fuel, the yellow cake m ust first be reduced to uranium -dioxide (UO 2 ) powder, which is then pressed into round ceramic pellets and fired at a high tem perature (>1400"C) (Rouben, 1998). The pellets are then ground to the precise size and shape and encased in metal tubes (usually zircaloy), which are then assembled into fuel bundles (Hore-Lacy, 2003).

Pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWR), o f which only the Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) design is in use for commercial power production (Hesketh, 1996), are able to utilize natural uranium fuel, the fuel produced from the above description. However, m ost other reactor types, such as the Boiling W ater Reactors (BW R) used in Sweden, require an enriched form o f uranium *. For these types o f reactors, the yellowcake m ust first be

converted to gaseous uranium hexafluoride (UFô), which is then subjected to an enrichment process (Rouben, 1998).

N uclear energy is produced through the splitting o f the uranium isotope

in a process

know n as fission (Lyon and Tutiah, 1984; W ilkinson, 1996; W NA, 2001). Nuclear fission releases a large amount o f heat, which is used to produce steam. The steam, in turn, spins large turbines that drive generators to produce electricity (Figure 2). As the some o f the non-fissile isotope U is fissioned,

is converted to fissionable isotopes o f plutonium (Pu

and Pu^"^'), which also contribute to the energy produced by the reactor (W NA, 2001). Anyw here from one third to h alf o f a reactor's energy output comes from the energy released by plutonium fission (Rouben, 1998; W NA, 2001). As the fuel is burned, there is a gradual

while there is a buildup of fission products and other neutron-absorbers

(Rouben, 1998; Hore-Lacy, 2003). After a period of 1-2 years, the concentration o f fission products builds up to the point where use o f the fuel is no longer practical (WNA, 2004).

Nuclear Fuel Waste

The management and disposal of nuclear fuel wastes is referred to as "back end" o f the nuclear fuel cycle (Hore-Lacy, 2003). Nuclear fuel waste comes in the form o f the spent

fuel assemblies or bundles. Fuel bundles typically weigh around 24 kg, o f which 19 kg is spent uranium^ (Lyon and Tutiah, 1984). The spent fuel bundles that are removed from a reactor are extremely hot and highly radioactive^. They therefore must first be stored under water to allow them to cool (OLA, 1977). After a number of years, the cooled fuel

^ Information is specific to CANDU fuel bundles, but is comparable to other fuel assemblies. ^ A fresh, spent fuel bundle would emit a lethal radiation dose of about 200,000 rem to an individual standing one meter away. By comparison the recommended dose for the general population is 0.5 rem per year (Ontario Legislative Assembly, 1977).

12-

assem blies m ay then be transferred to above ground dry-storage containers, w here they can rem ain for up to fifty years (Rouben, 1998). In m any cases the storage facilities for spent nuclear waste are located on site at the nuclear reactor in which it was used (Decam ps and Dujacquier, 1997). These storage facilities have been designed to be able to hold all the fuel wastes produced by the reactors up to the end o f their lifespan (CEAA, 1998).

N uclear waste consists o f highly radioactive fission by-products, which are capable o f releasing ionizing radiation, which in turn is capable o f changing the structure o f atoms or m olecules and is thus highly destructive to living cells (Krauskopf, 1990; Shrader-Frechette, 1993). This, states Shrader-Frechette, is what "accounts for its ability to cause carcinogenic, m utagenic, and teratogenic damage -- to induce, respectively, cancer, genetic defects, and birth defects" (pg. 13). It is because o f its highly radioactive nature that nuclear fuel wastes m ust be carefully confined and isolated fi'om hum an and environmental exposure.

N uclear waste disposal is based on the principles o f concentration and confinement to isolate the radioactive material from the biosphere for periods o f time that are in the tens o f thousands o f years (International Atom ic Agency, 1993). In m any countries that produce

nuclear fuel waste, geological disposal has been accepted as the preferred disposal m ethod (Flynn et al., 1995; Carter, 1987; CFAA; 1998; Decamps and Dujacquier, 1997; Soloway, 2003). Geologic disposal o f spent nuclear fuel has been referred to as "reverse m ining"

(Easterling and Kunreuther, 1995). The waste canisters are placed in a deep underground cavity located in an area w hose geology is stable'*. Once full, the repository will be in-filled using the earth and rock that was dug out (Easterling and Kunreuther, 1995).

Examples include salt dome, bedded salt, volcanic tuff, basalt, or granite (Easterling et al., 1995)

-13-

All geological disposal concepts utilize a `multiple barrier' approach to isolate the wastes from the biosphere (Duncan, 2002; lEA, 1993; Soloway, 2003). A multiple bam er system, which consists o f engineered and natural or geological barriers, is designed for two purposes: to prevent leakage o f radioactive material into the surrounding environment and to provide the necessary time for the radioactivity to decay (Duncan, 2002). Engineered barriers are reported to be significant during the first few hundreds to thousands of years, while the geological barriers become the important factor during the next thousands to tens o f thousands of years (lEA, 1993). Engineered barriers may consist of various components, such as the waste form itself, the waste canisters, the buffer mass and backfill (IAEA, 1993; Soloway, 2003). The waste form ^or matrix is usually in the form of UO 2 for fuel that is being directly disposed of, or borosilicate glass for reprocessed fuel (IAEA, 1993). Waste canisters are designed to

completely isolate the waste and typically consist of either corrosion resistant materials such as copper, stainless steel, titanium or ceramics or thick materials such as iron or carbon steel (IAEA, 1993). The functions of the buffer mass and backfill are to "stabilise the repository excavations and the thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical conditions, and to provide low permeabilities, diffusivities or long-term retardation" (Soloway, 2003, pg. 22).

: Certain geological conditions provide a natural barrier to the movement of radionuclides into br the environment (IAEA, 1993). There are three characteristics that need to be considered 1 when determining the effectiveness of natural barriers: physical isolation and stability;

hydrogeological transport processes; and geochemical conditions and processes (IAEA, 1993). Since the transport of radionuclides to the biosphere will mainly be through

groundwater movement, it is imperative that geological conditions include the following:

-14-

1) R ocks o f very low w ater content and perm eability (e.g., evaporites); 2) Rocks that are not saturated with groundwater (e.g., the unsaturated zone); 3) Rocks w ith potentially very low contents o f m obile w ater [sic] and very low perm eability (e.g., argillaceous rocks); 4) Fractured rocks o f low intrinsic permeability, in which radionuclide transport would be controlled by the fracture network (e.g., crystalline rocks in low relief terrains) (IAEA, 1993, pp. 11-12)

Sw eden's Nuclear W aste M anagement Program

Sw eden's first comm ercial nuclear reactor, Oskarshamn-1 cam e online in 1972 (Carter, 1987; IAEA, 2003). Prior to the 1970s Sweden had relied m ainly on hydro and to a lesser extent, oil for its electricity (WNA, 2004). During the 1960s the Swedish governm ent

decided to invest in nuclear power; the shift being prom pted m ainly by Sw eden's large supply o f uranium , as a response to protests by environm entalists against the expansion o f hydroelectricity, as well as the oil shocks that cam e during the early 1970s (Carter, 1987).
J

B etw een 1973 and 1997, the proportion o f oil used in energy production fell from 71% to 29% , w hile that o f nuclear pow er rose from 1% to 37 % (IAEA, 2003). Currently, Sweden has eleven nuclear pow er reactors in operation, producing approxim ately 50% o f its electricity, w ith a capacity o f 9,459 M W e (IAEA, 2003; W NA, 2004).

The 1979 Three M ile Island accident in the United States prom pted a Swedish referendum in the follow ing year regarding the phasing out o f nuclear energy (W NA, 2004). Following the referendum , in 1981, Parliam ent decided to phase out nuclear pow er by the year 2010 and no new reactors have since been commissioned. (Carter, 1987; Van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). T he first plant to be closed as part o f the decom m issioning plan was Barseback-1, a 600 M W e reactor that had been in operation since 1975, which was shut down in 1999. A

-15-

second reactor, Barseback-2 was originally slated to close in 2001 but is now scheduled to shut down in May, 2005 (SKI, 2004)

Sweden's nuclear power plants produce approximately 250 t o f nuclear waste each year (Ahlstrom, 1997). To date, the Swedish NWM program has generated an estimated 4 0 0 0 1 o f spent nuclear fuel waste (Thegerstrom et al., 2004). According to the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB^), an estimated 4500 fuel canisters, equivalent to 9300 t of uranium will eventually require final disposal® (SKB, 2004). Responsibility for the management and disposal of this radioactive waste rests with the nuclear power utilities themselves (Ahlstrom, 1997; Bjurstrom, 1989; Lidskog and Sundqvist, 2004; Ministry o f the Environment, 2003; SKB, 2000). This was the result of the passage of the Stipulation Act in April 1977, which

introduced a new requirement for the charging of new nuclear reactors, inclusive of which was a condition that stipulated that the prospective operators o f such reactors must demonstrate that nuclear waste could be disposed of in a safe way. (Bjamadottir and Hilding-Rydevik, 2001, pg. 51).

After the passage of the Stipulation Act, six reactors entered commercial reaction, although there was some contention as to whether the utility had indeed demonstrated that the waste could be disposed of safely. The Stipulation Act also resulted in the creation o f SKB, which is owned by Sweden's four nuclear power companies. SKB was commissioned to "develop, plan, design, constmct and operate plants and systems for the management and disposal o f spent fuel and radioactive waste from the plants" (Bjurstrom, 1989, pg. 139). As such, SKB is said to be the proponent of nuclear waste disposal in Sweden. This includes the disposal o f

-16-

both low and interm ediate level w aste (LILW ) as well high level w aste (HLW ) (Lidskog and Sundqvist, 2004).

SKB produced three reports dealing with spent fuel m anagem ent and w aste disposal, which becam e know n by their abbreviated names; KBS-1, KBS-2 and KBS-3^ (Ahlstrom , 1997). The preferred m ethod for the disposal o f high-level waste is based on the KBS-3 m ethod (Figure 3), which was published in 1983 (M inistry o f the Environment, 2003). A ccording to this m ethod, the spent fuel w ould be placed in copper canisters with solid cast iron inserts, w hich provides direct isolation o f the waste (SKB, 2000). The canisters, which have been given an expected lifetime o f over one m illion years (Carter, 1987), would be em bedded in bentonite clay and deposited in the crystalline, granitic bedrock 500 m below ground (SKB, 2000). The proposed repository would have a capacity o f 4500 canisters or 8000 t, enough to house all the spent fuel from Sw eden's current nuclear activities® (Ahlstrom, 1997; SKB, 2000). The KBS-3 m ethod is referred to as a M ulti-Barrier Disposal System as it employs a num ber o f separate barriers to ensure that the waste is isolated from the environment:

1) the rock mass, with slow w ater transport and high capacity for absorption o f radionuclides; 2) the near im perm eable bentonite clay buffer; 3) the highly corrosion-resistant copper canister; and 4) the low solubility o f the spent fuel. (Bjurstrom, 1989, pg. 141)

' KBS stands for Kâmbrânslesâkerhet, which translates to "nuclear fuel safety" (SKB, 2000). * Based on a 40-year operating life (SKB, 2000).

Figure 3. Basic layout o f the deep repository based on the KBS-3 Method (SKB, 2004).

In addition to the final repository, the KBS-3 method also entails an interim storage facility, encapsulation plant, and a canister factory (SKB, 2000). The interim storage facility, called
i

CLAB, which is already in place, consists of underground storage pools built in granitic crystalline bedrock (Bjurstrom, 1989; SKB, 2000). It has been in operation since 1985 and has recently increased its capacity from 5,000 t to 8,000 t, following the completion o f an additional rock cavern (SKB, 2000).

Although the Swedish government and the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate (SKI) have both allowed SKB to proceed with the KBS-3 concept, it still remains to be approved and licensed (Hogberg et al., Undated). A number of key issues regarding the KBS-3 method still require further investigation, such as; canister design and encapsulation technology; design, manufacturing and practical emplacement of the bentonite buffer; the adaptation of the repository design to the properties of the host rock; and

-18-

the scientific basis for understanding o f the long tim e function, e.g., concerning corrosion o f the canister, dissolution o f the fuel and the m igration o f radionuclides in the buffer and in fractures o f the rock. (Thegerstrom et al., 2004, pg, 5) U pon subm ission o f SK B 's application, the governm ent will m ake a final decision as to w hich m ethod for waste disposal will be used (Bjam adottir and Hilding-Rydevik, 2001). As noted above, there are still a num ber o f seientifie and technological issues that need to be addressed, but perhaps the m ost im portant aspect o f the development o f the the siting process (Ahlstrom, 1997).

concept is

D uring the 1970s and 1980s SKB condueted site-specific investigations to determ ine w hether a repository could be sited safely som ewhere in Sweden (Lidskog and Sundqvist, 2004). The investigations involved the drilling o f boreholes up to 1000 m deep in order to take m easurem ents, an activity that drew protests in m any o f the m unieipalities (Ahlstrom , 1997). SKB coneluded, based on geological criteria alone, "that there are m any places in the Swedish bedrock that provide conditions which are suitable for siting a repository at a depth o f about 500 m " (Ahlstrom, 1997, pg. 71). As such, SKB argued that other factors such as technology and societal acceptability should be considered o f greater im portance in the siting process (Lidskog and Sundqvist, 2004).

In 1992, SKB initiated a new siting strategy, which focused on the concept o f carrying out feasibility studies in m unicipalities (Lidskog and Sundqvist, 2004). These feasibility studies addressed a num ber o f concerns including the location o f final repository, long-term safety, technical aspects, health, the environm ent and societal acceptance (B jam adottir and HildingRydevik, 2001). By Decem ber 2000, eight studies had been completed (SKB, 2004). U pon

-19-

completion of the feasibility studies, more detailed site investigations were proposed in three o f the communities where studies were conducted: (Figure 4). Osthammar, Oskarshamn and Tierp

Osthammar and Oskarshamn, both of which already host nuclear facilities,

agreed to proceed with site investigations, whereas Tierp rejected further participation (Sjoberg, 2003; Thegerstrom et ah, 2004). The ultimate goal o f these site investigations is to obtain a permit to build the deep repository for spent nuclear fuel (Thegerstrom et ah, 2004).

A t present, site investigations for a deep geological repository, which include surface-based investigations using deep boreholes, are being conducted at two candidate sites: Forsmark in the m unicipality o f Ostham m ar and Sim pevarp/Laxem ar in the m unicipality o f Oskarsham n (SKB, 2004). A ccording to SK B's RD&D Program m e 2004, other developm ents in the

nuclear fuel program include: pilot- and full-scale tests o f parts o f the KBS-3 m ethod, which are currently being undertaken at the Canister Laboratory and the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory; as well as the development o f the encapsulating technology and the design o f an encapsulation plant (SKB, 2004). SKB plans to submit its license application for siting and construction, which will include the chosen site for the deep repository, in 2008 (SKB, 2004). Initial operation is expected to comm ence around 2015 (SKB, 2000).

C anada's Nuclear W aste M anagement Program

Canada began using nuclear pow er to generate electricity in 1962, when the 25 M W e N uclear Pow er Dem onstration (NPD) plant in Rolphton, Ontario was connected to the energy grid (Boulton, 1978). As o f April 2004, Canada had seventeen nuclear reactors in operation, generating approxim ately 12-15% o f the country's electricity, with a capacity o f 12 000 M W e (IAEA, 2003; W NA, 2004). Fifteen o f these reactors are located in the province o f Ontario, where nuclear energy accounts for 40% o f the province's electricity (IAEA, 2003). The only other provinces that utilize nuclear power are Quebec and New Brunswick, each having one operating reactor (CNA, 2004; IAEA, 2003; W NA, 2004).

C anada's nuclear pow er program produces approxim ately 85,000 spent fuel bundles per year (CEAA, 1998). A t the end o f 2001, Canada had accumulated a total o f 1,564,147 spent fuel bundles, containing 3 0 ,0 0 0 1 o f uranium (CNSC, 2003). It is estim ated that by the year 2073,

-21-

10 million spent fuel bundles will have been produced (CEAA, 1998). Spent fuel bundles are currently stored in reactor pools located on site at the nuclear power plants in which they were used, and are thus the responsibility o f the utility. The proponent o f nuclear waste disposal in Canada, however, is Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). AECL, a

nuclear technology and services company, is a Crown corporation that was established by the Government of Canada in 1952, with the mandate of developing peaceful uses o f nuclear energy (AECL, 1989). The concept of deep geological disposal of nuclear fuel wastes was first considered by a committee o f AECL in 1972 (NWMO, 2003). In 1974, the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources was asked to review the concept of waste disposal in geologic formations and to recommend suitable formations (Boulton, 1978). The province of Ontario held its first public review o f its nuclear waste policy in 1975, conducted by the Ontario Royal Commission on Electrical Power Planning (van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). In 1978, the Governments of Canada and Ontario directed AECL to develop the concept o f deep geological disposal o f nuclear fuel wastes (van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). This stemmed from a report produced by a panel of experts that was established by the Ministry o f Energy, Mining and Resources in 1977, known as the Hare Report^ (van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). On the types of rock suitable for geologic disposal, the panel concluded:

We feel that several different kinds of rock could profitably be studied but that resources ought not to be spread too thinly. We suggest that primary effort be given to the crystalline rocks o f plutonic origin (i.e., deep in the earth), but that careful attention be paid to the work of other scientists in other countries on different rock types. (Aikin, 1977, pg. 44)
®Named after the panel's chairman. Dr. Kenneth Hare.

-22-

As the m ain producer o f nuclear power, the panel also recom m ended that Ontario be the location o f the first nuclear w aste disposal facility (Aikin, 1977).

In the early 1980s, AECL began conducting test drillings in northern Ontario, near the town o f M assey and the Sagamok First Nations (van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). The drillings drew considerable protest, prom pting a referendum in Massey. W ith referendum results

show ing 88% o f the residents opposed the test drillings, AECL withdrew (van den Berg and Dam veld, 2000). Sim ilar protests in five other comm unities prom pted AECL to halt specific site studies and focus on " 'generic' research and the development o f a `concept' for deep disposal" (van den Berg and Damveld, 2000, pg. 33).

A E C L 's concept for the geological disposal o f nuclear fuel waste, which does not require perpetual care, is described as follows:

· · · · · · · ·

the waste form is either used CANDU fuel or the solidified high-level w aste from reprocessing; the w aste form is sealed in a container designed to last at least 500 years and possibly m uch longer; the containers o f waste are emplaced in room s in a disposal vault or in boreholes drilled from the rooms; the disposal room s are nom inally 500 to 1000 m below the surface; the geological m edium is plutonic rock o f the Canadian Shield; each container o f w aste is surrounded by a buffer; each room is sealed with backfill and other vault seals; and all tunnels, shafts, and exploration boreholes are ultim ately sealed in such a w ay that the disposal facility w ould be passively safe; that is, long-term safety would not depend on institutional controls. (AECL, 1994, pg. 5)

-23-

After ten years of research, the Federal Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources referred AECL's concept, along with other nuclear fuel waste management issues, for public review (CEAA, 1998). In 1989, the Federal Minister o f the Environment appointed an independent eight-member panel, headed by Blair Seaborn, to conduct an environmental assessment and public hearing on AECL's concept (CEAA, 1998; van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). In addition, the Panel created a Scientific Research Group (SRG) to review the technical aspects o f AECL's concept (van den Berg and Damveld 2000).

In 1994, AECL submitted an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for its concept, which was made available for public review for a period of five months (CEAA, 1998; van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). Between 1996 and 1997, public hearings were conducted on a wide variety o f topics relating to the management of nuclear fuel waste. The public hearings were conducted in the three provinces that produced nuclear fuel wastes (New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario). In addition, the Panel was "asked to include Manitoba, where an

AECL research facility is located, and Saskatchewan, as requested by the provincial government" (CEAA, 1998, pp. 6-7). In 1998, the Seaborn Panel submitted its report regarding the Nuclear Fuel Waste Management and Disposal Concept (CEAA, 1998). The Panel's main finding was that the disposal concept lacked broad social acceptability and thus, could not be adopted as Canada's nuclear waste management strategy (CEAA, 1998).

The government's response to the Seaborn Panel's report was to introduce legislation as the "preferred mechanism...to fulfill its policy objectives of federal oversight" (NRCAN, 2002). It became clear that the government's new policy was to ensure public confidence that the next steps for the long-term management o f nuclear fuel waste would be carried out in their best interests (Brown, 2003).

-24-

On April 25, 2001, the M inister o f Natural Resources introduced Bill C-27 in the H ouse o f Com m ons, which dealt with the long-term m anagem ent o f nuclear fuel waste (IAEA, 2003; NRCAN, 2002). The N uclear F uel Waste A ct (NFWA) received royal assent on June 13, 2002 and cam e into force on N ovem ber 15, 2002 (IAEA, 2003; NRCA N, 2002).

The purpose o f the NFW A "is to provide a fram ework to enable the G overnor in Council to m ake, from the proposals o f the waste m anagem ent organization, a decision on the m anagem ent o f nuclear fuel waste that is based on a com prehensive, integrated and econom ically sound approach for Canada" (Dept, o f Justice Canada, 2002). requirem ents set out by the NFW A are as follows: The

that nuclear utilities form a W aste M anagem ent Organization (W M O) as a separate legal entity; that the W M O report regularly to the Government o f Canada and provide recom m endations on the long-term m anagem ent o f nuclear fuel waste; that utilities and A tom ic Energy Canada Limited (AECL) establish a trust fund to finance long-term nuclear fuel waste m anagem ent activities; and that the governm ent review and approve key activities o f the W M O (NRCAN, 2002)

The N uclear W aste M anagem ent Organization (NW MO) that was subsequently created consists o f the Ontario Pow er Generation Inc. (formerly Ontario Hydro), the N ew Brunsw ick Pow er Corporation, Hydro-Quebec, and AECL (NW MO, 2003). The N W M O is required to assess three different m ethods to m anage nuclear fuel waste: deep geological disposal in the Canadian Shield; storage at nuclear reactor sites; and centralized storage, either above or below ground, and to m ake a recom m endation as to which m ethod should be adopted

-25-

(NWMO, 2003). The purpose o f the NWMO is "to develop collaboratively with Canadians a management approach for the long-term care of Canada's used nuclear fuel that is socially acceptable, technically sound, environmentally responsible and economically feasible" (NWMO, 2003).

As mandated by the NWFA, the NWMO is to consider only used nuclear fuel, and not other types o f radioactive waste (NWMO, 2003). The NWMO is required to submit the results o f its study, along with its final recommendation to the Government by November 2005 (NWMO, 2003). Once submitted, the Lieutenant-Governor, on the recommendation o f the Minister o f Natural Resources, is to select one of the approaches to implement (NWMO, 2003). The Lieutenant-Governor is not obligated to select the approach recommended by the NWMO, while the NWMO will be responsible for implementing the selected approach.

2.5

The Nuclear Waste Siting Dilemma

A siting dilemma is defined as a situation in which "an `authority' deems it in the best interest o f society to build a facility such as an incinerator, but opponents living near the proposed site thwart the plan" (Easterling and Kunreuther, 1995, pg. vii). Such is the case with nuclear waste facilities, which have been protested against in every single nuclear country (Shrader-Frechette, 1993). In the United States, for instance, numerous siting

attempts and several billions of dollars - the most of any nuclear nation - have been spent trying to create disposal facilities for radioactive and other hazardous wastes (Freudenburg,

- 26-

2004; Gerrard, 1994; Rabe, 1994).

Despite this, however, nearly every attem pt to site a

nuclear w aste repository in the US has failed*" (Freudenburg, 2004),

A sim ilar situation exists in Canada, where betw een 1978 and 1995 approxim ately $538 m illion was spent on research and development on the concept o f deep geological disposal o f high-level nuclear waste (HLW) (Auditor General, 1997). Despite the tim e and resources that have been spent studying the geological disposal option, the Canadian governm ent has yet to decide w hether it will indeed be the m ethod used to m anage its spent fuel, m uch less located a site for a geological repository. C anada's approximately 85,000 spent fuel bundles that are being produced every year are currently being held in either wet or dry storage facilities located at the nuclear generating stations (CNSC, 2003). It has been suggested that a

perm anent disposal solution, that does not rely on institutional controls is needed in order to "perm anently protect hum an health and the natural environment from the potentially harm ful effects o f nuclear fuel wastes, and to m inim ize the burden on future generations" (CEAA, 1998, pg. 18). As noted in Chapter 1, the lack o f a perm anent solution to the nuclear waste problem m ay have serious implications for the future o f nuclear pow er production. Although the federal governm ent has vowed continued support o f nuclear energy, it is likely to encounter greater opposition in the absence o f a perm anent disposal solution (CEAA, 1998).

2.5.1

P ublic Opposition --Not-In-M y-Back- Yard

Public opposition to nuclear w aste facilities has been dubbed by m any as the N IM BY (NotIn-M y-Back-Y ard) syndrome, an "intense and often adamant resistance b y the local population" (Kraft and Clary, 1993, pg. 96). Although it is considered one o f the m ost

The one exception is a N ew M exico facility, which handles nuclear wastes from military uses (Freuderriîurg, 2004).

-2 7 -

significant barriers to long-term nuclear waste management (Rabe, 1994), the phenomenon is not unique to nuclear waste facilities; many unpopular facilities such as landfills, prisons, affordable housing projects, mental health hospitals and even daycares have been opposed as the result o f NIMBY (Inhaber, 1998). The NIMBY response has even surfaced in proposed theme parks in Virginia and California (Munton, 1996). Although commonly believed to be a relatively recent trend, the NIMBY response has in fact been documented as early as the mid-1950s (Inhaber, 1991).

NIMBYism is often considered an irrational response by a poorly informed local public (Kraft and Clary, 1993). When related to hazardous waste facilities, it is also perceived by some as a tactic used by "chemophobes and environmental fanatics" as a means o f disrupting the industrialized economy (Rabe, 1994). This motive suggests the premise that if all

communities took that same stance, the government will be unable to site the facility anywhere. This would force industry to reduce waste production, through, for instance, a ~ reduction in nuclear power consumption (Inhaber, 1991).

On the other hand, Rabe (1994) argues that NIMBY is simply a realistic local response to poorly designed national and sub-national policies. Furthermore, as Bingham (1984) argues, NIMBY is a rational response by a local community to a proposed facility that would make that community worse off. Others have also dismissed the claim that the selfish attitudes of local communities prevent the attainment o f societal goals by preventing the siting of facilities, which provide an important social benefit (Lake, 1993). Lake argues that such facilities are needed more by capital than by society, and by a state striving to reproduce the capital-labor relationship, and that therefore, local protectionism characterized as NIMBY , represents a barrier not to societal goals but to the goals o f capital (Lake, 1993). The siting

-28-

o f a hazardous w aste incinerator, for instance, is only one o f the possible solutions to the problem o f industrial hazardous waste production. Lake argues that rather than restructure production in order to produce less waste, which would concentrate the costs on industry, decision m akers have often opted instead to try and site a w aste facility, w hich concentrates the costs on the local com m unity (Lake, 1993).

2.5.2

R oots o f Public Opposition

Risk Perception

Opposition to nuclear w aste facilities has largely been attributed to the public's perceptions o f the risks such facilities present (Kuhn, 1998; Slovic et al., 1991). According to K uhn (1998), the public perception is that the risks associated with a nuclear waste facility are "unacceptably high and threatening" (pg. 2) and would result in an inequitable burden on the host community. This is despite the fact that a nuclear w aste repository is likely to reduce the "aggregate radiation risk faced by current and future generations" (Easterling, 1992, pg. 444). A lthough experts in the nuclear industry generally regard the risks firom a nuclear

w aste facility to be relatively small, the general public tends to view these risks as being significantly greater (Carter, 1987). For instance, a survey conducted by K unreuther et al. (1988) found that respondents rated the risks from a potential nuclear w aste repository, such as the probability o f w astes being leached into groundwater or transportation accidents, as being significantly higher than other sources. R isk perception research reveals a num ber o f possible reasons for the incongruity betw een the perceptions o f experts and the general public regarding nuclear facilities. Slovic (1987) found that the risks associated w ith nuclear pow er are viewed b y people as being "unknown,

-29-

dread, uncontrollable, inequitable, catastrophic, and likely to affect ftiture generations" (pg. 163). Another study by Slovic et al. (1991) found that the four words most frequently associated with the phrase "underground nuclear waste repository" were dangerous, danger, death and pollution. One of the reasons put forth to explain this inherent fear o f all things related to nuclear is that since radiation cannot be detected by the five senses, it creates an ambiguity of harm, which has been shown to produce greater levels of stress in people than well-understood levels of harm (Freudenburg, 2004). The author adds that since

radioactivity is not empirical, there is a lack of controllability over the hazard, resulting in the public having to rely on sophisticated equipment and the people that run them (Freudenburg, 2004, pg. 164). Unfavourable media coverage is also partly responsible for the public's perceptions regarding the risks associated with nuclear facilities (Kasperson et al., 1988; Kunreuther et al., 1996; Slovic, 1991; Summers and Hine, 1997). According to Kasperson et al. (1988) the media tend to focus on rare or dramatic risk events, making it easier to recollect previous accidents or failures. Major accidents like those at Three Mile Island (TMI) in 1979 and in Chernobyl in 1986, for instance, have certainly increased public opposition to nuclear power (Shrader-Frechette, 1993). Aheame (1987) reports that between 1976 and 1986 there was a steady increase in survey respondents who were opposed to building more nuclear power plants in the United States, with marked increases after both TMI (to 40%) and Chernobyl (to 73%).

The public's perception of the risks associated with nuclear facilities can also be explained by the association people make between nuclear power and nuclear weapons (Slovic, 1987).

30-

The bom bings o f Hiroshim a and Nagasaki during W orld W ar II dem onstrated to the world the destructive pow er o f nuclear energy. According to Sm ith (1988):

N uclear energy was conceived in secrecy, bom in war, and first revealed to the world in horror. N o m atter how m uch proponents try to separate the peaceful from the weapons atom, the connection is firmly embedded in the m inds o f the public. (Smith, 1988, pg. 62) Lack o f Public Trust

The public's perception o f risks is said to be shaped by the am ount o f trust placed in those responsible for m anaging the risk (Sjoberg and Drottz-Sjoberg, 1997). It has been proven tim e and again that the level o f trust the public has for nuclear authorities and governm ent officials has broken down considerably over the past few decades (Carter, 1987; Dunlap et al., 1993; Flynn et al., 1992; Easterling and Kunreuther, 1995; Gerrard, 1994; Hine et al., 1997; Slovic et al., 1991). In the United States, this lack o f trust has been attributed to the m ilitary origins o f nuclear technology (Shrader-Frechette, 1993). Shrader-Frechette reports that the M anhattan Project** has resulted in nuclear decision-making that is fraught with secrecy, centralization and technocracy. In fact, the 1946 Atom ic Energy Act contained a provision that allowed the nuclear sub-government *^ to keep atomic secrets for national security purposes (Rosa and Freudenburg, 1993). It would be decades before public interest groups w ould force new legislation that required greater public disclosure o f the U S 's nuclear endeavours (Rosa and Freudenburg, 1993). For instance, Shrader-Frechette (1993) reports that in 1986 the U.S. Departm ent o f Energy (DOE) released 19,000 pages o f previously

" The Manhattan Project was the United States' secret project to develop atomic bombs during World War II. Rosa and Freudenburg (1993) describe the nuclear sub-government as "a closely knit group consisting o f the nuclear industry, federal agencies overseeing the technology, and key congressional committees" (pg. 33).

classified information regarding operations at the nuclear weapons facility in Hanford, Washington during the 1940s and 1950s. Among some of the revelations contained in the documents were radiological experiments performed on local people, either without their knowledge or permission (Shrader-Frechette, 1993). Rosa and Freudenburg (1993) add that issues regarding nuclear wastes were particularly kept secret, more so than any other nuclear management issue. In the United States, the public's distrust of nuclear authorities, namely the Department o f Energy (DOE) has further increased in light of the mishandling of nuclear wastes from the country's nuclear weapons facilities, such as Hanford (Flynn et al., 1992; Slovic et al., 1991). According to Slovic et al. (1991) over $150 billion will be required to clean up the leakage fi' om the country's military weapons facilities. Flynn et al. (1992) add that there is "a

pervasive distrust o f both Congress and DOE, built up during three decades o f ill-fated attempts to dictate a solution" (pg. 42). The issue of public trust is well summarized by Jacob (1990):

Stories in the mass media about reactor accidents, nuclear waste mismanagement, cost overruns, and the alleged federal cover-up of radiological disasters created public distrust, which threatened the continued promotion of nuclear power by the federal government. (Jacob, 1990, pg. xii)

The lack of trust in government authorities and the nuclear industry translates into a continued distrust of their assessments o f nuclear waste facilities as having low risk (Duncan, 2002). This poses a significant problem in nuclear waste siting efforts, particularly given that "once lost, publie trust and confidenee in governmental institutions are difficult to rebuild" (Kraft and Clary, 1993, pg. 111). To compound the problem, the public is said to lack trust

-32-

even in the concept o f nuclear w aste disposal itself and "fully expects the system to fail, and the waste, while still hazardous, to reconnect w ith the biosphere" (Duncan, 2002, pg. 75). This is confirm ed by Slovic et al. (1991); a survey conducted by the authors revealed that respondents did not believe that a repository would prevent the release o f radionuclides into the environment. D uncan (2002) adds that while experts are quick to point out scientific risk probabilities (e.g., a less than a 10'^ per year chance that an individual will suffer deleterious health effects fi-om radioactive material released fi-om a repository) these expressions m ean little to the general public (Duncan, 2002).

Lack o f Public Participation

It is now a w idely held b elief that nuclear waste m anagem ent involves far m ore than ju st solving technical problem s (Flynn et al., 1992; Freudenburg, 2004; Kraft, 2000; M urdock et al., 1983). In fact, the m ost critical issues surrounding nuclear waste m anagem ent are said to be those relating to social science (M urdock et al., 1983). Unfortunately, these issues

historically have not received the attention that they merited. Rather, nuclear w aste disposal policy was grounded heavily in technical research, such as risk assessments regarding potential releases o f nuclear contamination and the consequences o f exposure to

contam ination (Kraft, 2000). Kraft adds that although social, economic and political factors are considered, they typically have a limited impact on policy decisions, which are influenced m ost by technical analyses (Kraft, 2000). That technical concerns have always been given greater eonsideration than social issues is a sentim ent repeatedly found in the current researeh literature (Dunlap et al., 1993; Easterling and Kunreuther, 1995; Flynn et al., 1992; Freudenburg, 2004; Kraft, 2000; M unton, 1996).

-33-

According to Flynn et al. (1992), "[a]lthough large amounts o f money have been poured into the scientific and engineering aspects of high-level radioactive waste disposal, virtually nothing has been done to actively enlist the public in the siting process or to collaborate with the public in forging a solution" (pg. 42). To make matters worse, when authorities deal with the public, "[t]here is a tendency to use very top-down technocratic language, to view individuals in communities as pests, and rather than wanting to engage in meamngful dialogue, to want to dismiss and get through the public resolution process as quickly as possible" (Rabe, 1996).

One of the most critical social issues surrounding nuclear waste management is how to involve local parties in the siting process (Murdock et al., 1983). Historically, the prevailing method of siting hazardous waste facilities has been a "top-down" approach known as Decide-Announce-Defend (DAD) (Flynn et al., 1995; Munton, 1996; Rabe, 1994). Rabe (1996) describes this approach as one in which a governmental body makes a decision on the siting of a facility, then tries to impose that facility on a particular community, with little or no prior consultation. The government then "mount[s] whatever effort seems necessary to defend and secure approval of, or at least acquiescence to, this choice" (Munton, 1996, pg. 11). During the 1970s and 1980s it became apparent that this approach was repeatedly Munton

ending in failure, leading to a NIMBY response (Munton, 1996; Rabe, 2000).

(1996) attributes this partly to the undemocratic process by which that site was decided upon: "A vital part o f the opposition to planned facilities results from what is perceived to be an attack on basic democratic principles" (pg. 2).

The consequence of not having adequate public consultation is evident in the following example from the Environmental Assessment (EA) o f the Canadian nuclear fuel waste -34-

m anagem ent and disposal concept (Knhn and M urphy, 2001). The authors state that the current setting o f Term s o f R e f e r e n c e i n the EA process provides inadequate opportunity for public consultation. T hey report that "while proponents have an opportunity to be

involved in the negotiations, the public, including NGOs, do not have a way to participate legitim ately until after the term s o f reference are released and seoping is underw ay" (Kuhn and M urphy, 2002, pg. 262). As a result, NGOs and other public groups resorted to threats and letter w riting campaigns to government officials. The authors conclude that conflicts betw een the proponents, governm ent agencies, regulators, NGOs and the public could have been avoided had the setting o f the terms o f reference been done in a "spirit o f cooperation and com prom ise" (pg. 263).

It is clear that the lack o f public participation in siting issues can only lead to "confrontation and stalem ate" (M unton, 1996, pg. 11). If nations are to implement a successful nuclear

w aste policy, they will need to design "decision m aking processes that can provide for the level and kind o f public participation capable o f producing consensus on socially acceptable risk" (Kraft, 2000, pg. 208).

2.5.3

O vercom ing Opposition

It is im portant to point out at this point that not all siting efforts have resulted in failure. A lthough far from being commonplace, examples can be found o f controversial facilities overcom ing public opposition and being successfully sited (Gerrard, 1995; Castle and M unton, 1996; Rabe, 1994). Perhaps the m ost cited case o f a hazardous w aste facility

gaining local acceptance is the Swan Hills Special W aste Treatm ent Centre in Swan Hills,

The Terms o f Reference for an EA define the proposed project and its boundaries

-35-

Alberta (Gerrard, 1995; Rabe, 1994).

Following two failed private attempts to locate a

bazardons waste facility in the late 1970s, Alberta's provincial government decided to take over the siting process and in 1984, selected Swan Hills with the support of 79% o f local voters*'* (Gerrard, 1995). One of the factors attributable for the success in Swan Hills is the Alberta government's decision to make the siting process voluntary (Gerrard, 1995). In 1984, all the municipalities in Alberta were asked if they wished to be considered for a hazardous waste facility. Communities had to volunteer before any studies were to be conducted

(Gerrard, 1995; Castle and Munton, 1996; Rabe, 1994). Perhaps the most important factor in the success at Swan Hills is the province's use of various mechanisms to involve the public in the siting process (Rabe, 1994). These included the creation of liaison committees, one o f which held over 120 meetings throughout the province, providing such information as the types of siting criteria that may be used (Rabe, 1994).

Another example of a successful siting effort occurred in Greensboro, North Carolina during the mid-1980s with the siting of the ECOFLO hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facility (Rabe, 1994). Much like the Swan Hills case, the siting process was made voluntary, and incorporated extensive public involvement, early in the process (Rabe, 1994). It differed, however, in that the process did not involve the entire state and was not headed by a governmental authority. Rather, the process was headed by Tom Barbee, a Greensboro resident who had experience as a waste transporter (Rabe, 1994). Barbee was able to reach a siting agreement with the community through his commitment to an open planning process. He held numerous meetings with various organizations and individuals, earning the

69% of eligible voters participated (Gerrard, 1995).

-36-

com m unity's trust by providing w hatever inform ation was requested and constantly seeking input regarding the facility's design as well as the planning process itself (Rabe, 1994).

The preceding exam ples highlight the favourable effects that effective public participation can have on the siting process. One o f the explanations for this is that "broad-based public participation offers a m easure o f control over the process o f risk characterization" (Short and Rosa, 2004, pg. 148). This sense o f control, add the authors, leads to decreased fear over phenom ena and greater willingness to accept risks and uncertainty (Short and Rosa, 2004). In addition, it has been reported that success is m ore likely when a proponent accomm odates the local concerns o f the com m unity in an honest and m eaningful way (Flynn et al., 1992).

It is w idely agreed upon in the current literature that the public needs to be involved at all steps o f the siting process, including the definition and identification o f the problem as well as the decision m aking regarding any proposed solutions (Short and Rosa, 2004). particularly im portant to involve the public early in the process. It is

According to Treichel

(2000) honest risk comm unication and transparency must take place prior to starting any siting process. For the public to even consider accepting a nuclear w aste facility, for instance, they m ust first agree that the facility is both necessary (not taking action would be costly or risky) and appropriate (the proposed facility is the best that can be done and is a significant im provem ent over the status quo) (Treichel, 2000). In addition to occurring early in the

decision-m aking process, public participation, in order to be effective, m ust be extensive (Rabe, 1994). In both the Swan Hills and Greensboro cases, the proponents attem pted to

reach as m any groups and individuals as possible, both to inform and gain as m uch input as possible.

-37-

In discussions regarding public participation, one often encounters the term `stakeholder'. A stakeholder can be defined as "a person or other actor with special concern and interest in an issue, and may be considered to be concerned either on the basis of self-report or on the basis o f observed activities" (Sjoberg, 2003, pg. 740). Past efforts at public participation meant the involvement of stakeholders in decision-making processes (Short and Rosa, 2004). However, it has been reported that stakeholders do not necessarily represent the views of the general public as they tend to be more extreme (Sjoberg, 2003). Sjoberg (2003) adds that

stakeholders opposed to a proposed facility tend to be more outspoken, despite the fact that they tend to comprise a relatively smaller group. It is thus important to engage not just the stakeholders, but also the "affected parties who may not recognize their stake in risks to be characterized" (Short and Rosa, 2004, pg. 148). Sjoberg (2003) goes further by suggesting that when communicating with the public regarding risks, it should be done with the general public, as opposed to giving priority to stakeholders. Indeed, providing all affected parties with an equal opportunity to participate and shape the decision-making process has been shown to arrive at a consensus within the local community (Short and Rosa, 2004).

The other major factor in the successes at both the Swan Hills and Greensboro cases was the voluntary nature of the siting process. Voluntary processes are more likely to gain local support than traditional top-down processes as they consider a number of potential sites, rather than a single one chosen by the proponent (Castle and Munton, 1996). Although most communities will not accept a facility, "the more communities that are considered, the higher the overall likelihood of one siting success" (Castle and Munton, 1996, pg. 74). Gerrard (1995) also states that using a voluntary approach "elicits a far different psychological

-38-

response" (pg. 109) in local communities. specific advantages to the voluntary approach:

A ccording to Gerrard (1995), there are three

1. It decreases intrusion --by m aking the risk voluntary it reduces the perception o f risk 2. It draw s out those comm unities with cultures that will accept facilities 3. It tends to lead to paym ent o f the full social costs o f a facility, since the hidden subsidies o f preem ption are eliminated (Gerrard, 1995, pg. 132) The idea o f com pensation has also been used to try to overcom e public opposition to the siting o f hazardous waste facilities. Three specific purposes o f com pensation have been identified:

1. to induce localities to accept facilities; 2. to m ake victims whole; and 3. to increase economic efficiency by internalizing the external costs o f facilities. (Gerrard, 1995)

A ccording to Kunreuther (1996), compensation ensures that the benefits associated w ith hosting a facility are greater than m aintaining the status quo.

The effectiveness o f com pensation is somewhat debatable.

Kunreuther (1996) reports that

support for facilities in several communities in the United States doubled when "som e form o f com pensation was introduced into the picture" (pg. 345). However, Gerrard (1995) argues that com pensation only works when the "com m unity does not believe the proposed facility poses an undue hazard" (pg. 127). Thus, there is the danger o f com pensation being perceived as a bribe (Gerrard, 1995, Inhaber, 1991). On the other hand, Inhaber (1991) adds that Thus, the

incentives'^ differ from bribes in that bribes are given and accepted in secret.

In the research literature, the terms "compensation" and "incentives" are used interchangeably.

-39-

success o f incentives depends on how they are offered or presented (Inhaber, 1991). For instance, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers incentives in the form o f grants that allow citizen groups to retain experts o f their choice (Inhaber, 1991).

3.1

Research Design

The purpose o f this study is to determine the significance o f public engagem ent in a successful nuclear waste m anagem ent strategy. The m ain instrument employed in this study is a prim ary and secondary document review.

This study is conducted in three parts.

The first part o f the study consists o f a qualitative

review o f the nuclear w aste managem ent program s o f Sweden and Canada. The progress and current status o f each country's nuclear waste m anagem ent program is documented. In

addition, significant milestones throughout the program s are identified and com pared in term s o f the am ount o f tim e it took to reach each milestone.

The next part o f the study involves the identification and comparison o f specific aspects o f public engagem ent during comparable periods in each country's nuclear waste m anagem ent program or siting process. In the Swedish case, the period is marked by the im plem entation o f the new siting strategy in 1992. In the Canadian case, the period to be studied is during the Panel Review o f the Nuclear Fuel W aste M anagem ent and Disposal Concept (1989-1998). These specific periods have been chosen as they represent opportunities for the proponents in each country to engage the public in the nuclear waste issue. It should be noted that in the Canadian case, the tim e period is closed, whereas in Sweden, it is considered open as the siting strategy is still currently being implemented and engagement activities are ongoing. The author has declined to include in the analysis, the current work o f the N W M O in the

-41-

Canadian case as it represents a marked departure from the engagement activities conducted during the Panel Review. One of the goals of this study is to determine any shortcomings of the public engagement aspect of the Canadian nuclear waste management program. Although the NWMO has committed to engaging the public in the nuclear waste issue at the present time, their efforts do not reflect what had taken place during the Panel Review, and thus have not be taken into account. In addition, while the disposal option during the Panel Review was a deep geological repository, the NWMO is currently considering other strategies besides deep geological disposal.

For this part of the study, a quantitative eomparison o f the following aspects is employed:

1. Access to information 2. Level o f contact 3. Financial resources devoted to public engagement Lastly, in order to gauge the effectiveness of each country's public engagement activities, a comparison is made of the public awareness o f the nuclear waste issue in each country, as well as public support for each country's nuclear waste management program. This is

accomplished by examining surveys of public attitudes towards nuclear waste and nuclear waste management in each country.

3.2

Data Collection

The data used for this study have been compiled from a number o f sources. The first part of the study relies on documents from a variety of primary and secondary sources. These

-42-

include reports from each country's nuclear authorities, government publications, journal articles, and direct correspondence with various organizations, authorities and/or individuals involved in the nuclear w aste siting process.

The data used for the second part o f the study was obtained m ainly from prim ary sources. For the Swedish case, the m ain source o f information is the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and W aste M anagem ent Co. (SKB). Relevant documents include:

·

Eight Feasibility Study Final Reports (one from each o f the m unicipalities o f Storum an, Mala, Osthammar, Nykoping, Oskarshamn, Tierp, Hultsfred and Alvkarleby); Four Site Investigation Annual Reports (two each from the m unicipalities o f O stham m ar and Oskarshamn); and the follow ing reports published by SKB: Extended Consultations A ccording to the Environm ental Code , A ctivities 2003 and Activities 2004.

·

·

In addition, data w ere obtained through direct correspondence with individuals at SKB. It should b e noted at this point that although m uch o f the data regarding the Swedish case was available in English, there w ere som e documents that w ere only available in Swedish. For those docum ents not available in English, the services o f a Swedish translator were enlisted.

For the Canadian case, the prim ary source o f data consists o f documentation o f the Panel Review o f the N uclear W aste M anagement and Disposal Concept, which include the following:

·

the Report o f the N uclear Fuel W aste M anagem ent and D isposal C oncept Environm ental Assessm ent Panel: transcripts o f the scoping m eetings; and transcripts o f the public hearing proceedings.

· ·

-43

Data were also obtained through direct correspondence with individuals at the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and Atomic Energy Canada Ltd.

The data used to make a comparison of the effectiveness of each country's public engagement activities were obtained from the following surveys: · Canadian Attitudes Toward Nuclear Energv -- Focus Canada Omnibus Summary Report, conducted by Environics Research Group in 2003 for the Canadian Nuclear Association Public Attitudes to Nuclear Waste and the NWMO Project, conducted by Navigator in 2003 for the Nuclear Waste Management Organization

·

· Europeans and Radioactive Waste, conducted by INRA (Europe) in 2001 for the European Commission's Directorate General for Energy & Transport · The 2005 annual opinion survey regarding the deep repository conducted by the polling firm Temo for SKB*®.

3.3

Data Analysis

For the first part of the study, primary and secondary source documents are reviewed in order to construct a timeline, which outlines the development of each country's nuclear waste management program. From this timeline, significant milestones are identified and

compared in terms of the amount of time it took each country to reach each milestone.

For the next part of the study, primary source documents are reviewed in order to obtain data regarding the specific measures of public engagement noted above.

Access to Information For the purpose of this study, public access to information is measured according to the number of materials pertaining to the nuclear waste management program and/or siting

process that have been published in each country.

It is also m easured according to the

num ber o f people that have visited each country's nuclear research facilities. Since nuclear research facilities m ay be regarded as direct sources o f information, the num ber o f visits to such facilities is used as an indirect measure o f public access to information. Level o f Contact For this study, level o f contact with the public is m easured on the basis o f the num ber o f "contact events" conducted by the proponents'^, during the aforementioned tim e periods. This provides a m easure o f the degree o f issue penetration among the general population that the proponent has achieved. Contact events m ay include meetings, seminars, hearings or

other formal and informal gatherings conducted by the proponent or in which the proponent participated in order to engage the public in the nuclear w aste issue.

Financial Resources D evoted to Public Engagement

,

A nother m easure o f how well the public is engaged in the nuclear waste issue is the amount o f financial resources committed to public engagement. For the public to have m eaningful participation in the nuclear w aste issue, sufficient funding m ust be provided. M onetary

support is required for such things as the publication o f information m aterials, retaining personnel dedicated to providing public information and to provide the public with access to outside experts to review information that are o f a m ore technical nature.

For this part o f the analysis, the proponent in the Canadian case is taken to be the Environmental Assessment Panel. Although the actual proponent o f the disposal concept is AECL, all public involvement initiatives were conducted by the Environmental Assessment Panel, as prescribed by the federal Environmental

Assessment and Review Process Guidelines Order.
In the Swedish case, the proponent is the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co. (SKB),

- 45-

In the final part o f the study, surveys of public attitudes towards nuclear waste and nuclear waste management in Sweden and Canada are examined to determine the level o f public awareness regarding the nuclear waste issue as well as the amount o f support for each country's respective nuclear waste management programs. Public awareness and support are used to gauge the effectiveness of each country's public engagement activities.

3.4

Assumptions and Limitations

It is imperative to note that in conducting this study a number of assumptions had to be made. Although both Sweden and Canada have been engaged in the nuclear waste issue for a similar length of time, there are quite a few inherent differences between the two countries that must be kept in mind.

First, one must consider the geography and population characteristics of each country. Sweden's mean population from 1992, when the new siting strategy was implemented, to the present is estimated at approximately 8.8 million. With a land area measuring 410,934 km^, Sweden has a population density o f roughly 22 persons per km^ (SCB Statistics Sweden, 2005). Canada's mean population during the Panel Review (1989-1998) is estimated at approximately 28.8 million, roughly three times that of Sweden. With a land area that is roughly twenty-two times larger than Sweden's at 9,220,970 km^, Canada has a much lower population density at 3.5 persons per km^ (Statistics Canada, 2005).

Furthermore, whereas most of Sweden's geography has been identified as being suitable for a geologic repository (SKB, 2004®), in Canada the suitable area is limited to the area containing plutonic rock known as the Canadian Shield (AECL, 1994). This could certainly have an influence on the implementation o f a nuclear waste strategy, particularly if the

-46-

ultim ate goal o f that strategy is the siting o f a geological repository, which is the case in both Sw eden and Canada.

Reliance on nuclear energy for electricity production is another factor that m ust be taken into account. In Sweden, nuclear energy accounts for approximately h a lf o f the country's

electricity production, while in Canada the proportion is m uch less at 12% (W NA, 2004). In addition, national support for nuclear energy is significantly greater in Sweden than it is in Canada (Table 2). M oreover, in Canada, there are only three provinces that utilize nuclear energy (Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick); in fact, m ost o f Canada's nuclear reactors are clustered in the province o f Ontario. In Sweden, on the other hand, nuclear energy provides electricity nationwide. This could partially account for the fact that the nuclear w aste issue is m uch m ore at the forefront in Sweden than it is in Canada.

Sweden Canada

Source: Temo, 2005; Environics, 2003

For the purpose o f this study, it is assumed that the aforementioned differences betw een the two countries are o f less significance in the successful implementation o f a nuclear w aste m anagem ent program than the degree o f public involvement.

When asked about their personal view o f nuclear power in Sweden. 13% o f Swedish respondents wanted nuclear power phased out. 4% did not answer. 19% wanted to build new and more reactors, 30% wanted to continue nuclear power production and replace existing ones when they have reached the end o f their operating lives, and 34% felt nuclear power should be used until present reactors had to be closed o f safety or cost grounds. The Environics survey asked whether respondents strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or strongly oppose the use o f nuclear energy to produce electricity in Canada. 17% o f respondents strongly support nuclear power, 33% somewhat support it, 17% were somewhat opposed, and 23% were strongly opposed.

- 4 7-

The reader need also be warned of the limitations of this study. It should be noted that a fundamental difference exists between the stages at which the nuclear waste management programs in each country are being compared. While the public participation program in Sweden deals with the actual process of siting a geological repository, in the Canadian case, the public participation aspects being considered in this study occurred during a review of the geological disposal concept, which, at the time, was being considered without an actual site in mind. In the second part of this study, three aspects of each country's public engagement programs are compared. With respect to the first two aspects (access to information and level o f contact), the reader need be advised that the study does not analyse the content of the proponents' message. Rather, the analysis attempts to determine the level of outreach of each proponent by quantifying physical aspects of their public participation programs, such as the number of information materials they've published, and the number of times they made contact with the public.

With respect to the analysis of the level of contact, the lack of attendance figures during the Panel Review in the Canadian case also poses a limitation. For this analysis, the most

effective measure of contact between proponents and the public would certainly have been a record of the actual number of individuals with whom contact was made. Although the data were available in the Swedish case, unfortunately, attendance records during the open houses, scoping meetings and public hearings for the Canadian Panel Review were not kept. As such, it was decided that a comparison of the number of events at which public contact was made would suffice.

-48-

For the analysis o f the amount o f funding for public participation activities, it should be noted only the amount provided by the proponents in each country have been considered.

A nother lim itation relates to the final part o f this study, nam ely the analysis o f survey results in each country to determine public support for their respective nuclear waste m anagem ent program s. As the surveys in each country were performed by different polling firms and for different purposes, the questions asked were not identical. In the Swedish case, the question posed b y the polling firm specifically asked whether or not one would support a deep repository i f it w ere to be found in one's municipality. In the Canadian case, however, the question posed was m ore general in nature, asking simply how confident one was that the nuclear authorities had a good system in place to deal with nuclear waste. Although the two surveys did not explicitly ask the same question, the author feels that they both convey the sam e sentim ent with regards to the level o f public support for their respective country's
;

nuclear w aste m anagem ent programs.

W hile the Canadian process has not yet reached a

siting stage, a high level o f confidence in the nuclear authorities is needed if acceptance o f a geological repository is to be attained.

Progress and Current Status of NWM Programs

Timelines highlighting the major developments in the nuclear waste management programs , in Sweden and Canada over the past thirty years, are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. From these timelines, it is evident that both Sweden and Canada began studying the nuclear waste issue roughly at the same, during the early 1970s. In Sweden, the first official study to be conducted on the issue of nuclear waste disposal was the so-called AKA Investigation, which was conducted from 1973-1976 (Bjamadottir and Hilding-Rydevik, 2001). In Canada, the concept of deep geological disposal of nuclear fuel wastes was first considered by AECL in 1972 (NWMO, 2003). The direction of research was similar in both countries, with

Sweden conducting test drillings between 1977-1985 (SKB, 2004), and Canada doing likewise during the early 1980s (van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). The test drillings

conducted in both countries drew considerable protest from the municipalities involved.

Despite the protests, a significant milestone was reached in the Swedish nuclear waste management program when the Government approved the KBS-3 method for spent fiiel waste management and disposal in 1983. From there on, the Swedish nuclear waste

management program progressed in what has been called a stepwise development (Ahlstrom, 1997). During the early 1980s construction began on an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel, CLAB, which began operating in 1985 (Johansson, 2003, SKB, 2000), This was followed by the completion o f a repository for low- and intermediate-level waste (LILW) in 1988 (Bjurstrom, 1989). The facility, known as SFR-1, is located near the

C anada s N uclear Fuel W aste M anagem ent Program was offieially initiated in 1978 w ith the issuance o f the joint statement by the federal and Ontario governments directing AECL to develop the concept o f deep geological disposal (van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). The

directive was based on the results o f a study conducted by a panel o f experts led by Dr. K enneth Hare, which stated that geological disposal o f nuclear fuel wastes had the best potential (CEAA, 1998). In 1981, the federal and Ontario governments issued another joint statement, establishing that siting o f a disposal facility would only take place "after a full federal public hearing and approval o f the concept by both governm ents" (CEAA, 1998, pg. 6). This m ost likely was a response to the numerous protests that were prom pted by A E C L 's test drillings, and resulted in AECL abandoning further drillings and focusing only on the developm ent o f a concept (van den Berg and Damveld, 2000). Thus, by the tim e the

Canadian concept was referred for a public review in 1987, the Swedish governm ent had already approved the KBS-3 concept, constructed an interim storage facility, and nearly com pleted a repository for LILW.

In Sweden, the formal siting process was initiated in 1992, based on the concept o f carrying out feasibility studies in m unicipalities (Lidskog and Sundqvist, 2004). The feasibility

studies w ould be carried out on a voluntary basis and, in response to the protests over the test drillings, would be based on existing data (Ahlstrom, 1997). Over the next eight years, eight feasibility studies would be completed. Around this time, the Public Review o f the N uclear Fuel W aste M anagem ent and Disposal Concept was being conducted in Canada. Open

houses w ere hosted in the spring o f 1990 to "inerease public awareness o f the review process,

-53 -

the proposal under review and the opportunities to participate" (CEAA, 1998, pg. 7). In the fall of the same year, scoping meetings were held in 14 communities to develop Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) guidelines. AECL submitted its EIS in 1994, which was followed by another series of open houses in the fall of 1994 and winter o f 1995 (CEAA, 1998). The public hearings were held between 1996-1997. The Panel submitted its

recommendations to the federal government in 1998, concluding that while the concept had been proven to be sound from a technical perspective, it had not been proven to be socially acceptable (CEAA, 1998). Thus, on the basis of the concept not likely being accepted by a community, the Panel concluded that the concept as described by AECL's EIS should not be adopted and was thus not approved by the Government. In 2001, the Canadian federal government introduced legislation dealing with the long-term management of nuclear fuel waste. The Nuclear Fuel Waste Act came into force in In

November 2002, creating the Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO).

Sweden, three municipalities that had participated in the feasibility studies were selected to undergo more detailed site investigations: Osthammar, Oskarshamn and Tierp (Thegerstrom et al., 2004). While a referendum in Tierp led to that municipality declining further

participation, detailed site investigations began in Osthammar and Oskarshamn in 2002, and are still ongoing (SKB, 2004). Once site investigations have been completed, one site will be chosen for the final geological repository. SKB plans to submit its license application for the siting and construction of the deep repository in 2008, and expects to conunence operation by 2015 (SKB, 2000; SKB, 2004).

In Canada, the NWMO is considering two other methods for managing Canada's used nuclear fuel waste. In addition to geological disposal, they are studying continued storage at

-54-

reactor sites and centralized storage (NW MO, 2003). The NW M O has identified four phases in its study plan (NW M O, 2005):

1. In Phase 1, the NW M O conducts informal conversations with "a range o f individual Canadians, comm unities o f interest and key stakeholders to introduce itself and to better understand the views and needs o f Canadians at large" . 2. D uring Phase 2, the N W M O conducts engagement and dialogue activities to determine "w hat is required in a long-term managem ent approach for nuclear fuel w aste" and "to solicit input, advice and direction in the developm ent...[of] a preliminary fram ework for analyzing and assessing the alternative m anagem ent approaches". 3. In Phase 3 o f its study plan, the NW M O evaluates specific long-term m anagem ent approaches for nuclear fuel waste, while continuing to conduct "dialogue activities to review and discuss N W M O 's assessment o f the long-term managem ent approaches, and to suggest changes and revisions to assist in the development o f a recom m endation" . 4. In the final phase, the NW M O plans to release a Draft Study Report, which includes their recom m endation, to be m ade available for public review and comment before subm itting a final recom m endation to the Government, the deadline for which is N ovem ber 15. W ith the Canadian government expected to approve a method presum ably in 2006, it can be said that the Canadian nuclear waste m anagem ent program has been set back approxim ately tw enty years w hen compared to the Swedish case, where a disposal m ethod w as approved back in 1983.

Measures of Public Engagement

' ^

4.2.1 Access to Information Public access to information is measured on the basis of how much information is made available to the public by the proponents in each country. A comparison has been made of the number of information materials that have been published in each country regarding its nuclear waste management program and/or siting process. Tables 3 and 4 show the total number of information materials that have been published in Sweden and Canada, respectively. It should be noted that for the purpose of this study, only materials that were intended to inform the public about each country's respective nuclear waste management program have been included. Technical reports or other papers intended mainly for the scientific community have not been included.

It is evident from the preceding tables that in Sweden, there has been m ore than tw ice the num ber o f m aterials published or released to the general public regarding the nuclear waste m anagem ent program than during the Panel Review in Canada. Thus, the general public in Sw eden can be said to have greater access to information regarding the nuclear w aste m anagem ent program than did the Canadian public during the Panel Review o f the disposal concept.

For the purpose o f this study, public access to information is also m easured indirectly via the num ber o f visits to each country's nuclear research facilities. Tables 5 and 6 show the

num ber o f visits to the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) operated by SKB in Sw eden and the U nderground Research Laboratory (URL) operated by AECL in Canada, respectively.

It is clear that there have been a far greater num ber o f visitors to the Aspo HRL than there have been to A E C L 's URL. The total number o f visitors to the Aspo HRL during the period 1994-2004 was 89,468, while the total number o f visitors to A EC L's URL during the period 1991-2001 was nearly ten tim es fewer at 9,648^^. The average num ber o f visitors to the Aspo HRL during any given year was 8,133, compared to 965 to A EC L's URL, nearly a ten fold difference.

A graphical com parison o f the num ber o f visitors to each facility can be found in Figure 7. It is o f interest to note that in the Swedish case, there was a near doubling o f the num ber o f visitors to the Aspo HRL to 12,211 in 1999 from 6,931 the preceding year. This coincides w ith the peak in the feasibility studies, six o f which were being conducted at the time. It appears to be a clear sign that SKB had increased its efforts to educate and inform m unicipalities and the general public about its nuclear waste m anagem ent program and the related research being conducted at its facilities. In Canada, a sim ilar peak can be found in 1996, where the num ber o f public tours to A EC L's U R L was 1,579, up from 983 the year before. This increase m ay be attributed to the public hearings for the Panel Review o f the Disposal Concept, which began in the sam e year. A lthough this increase appears significant, it is the author's opinion that AECL could have m ade better use o f the public hearings as an opportunity to inform m ore o f the general public about its proposed disposal concept and the research it was conducting.

This includes both public tours and technical visits to AECL's URL. The corresponding figures in the Swedish case do not distinguish between public and technical visits, but ratter represent the total number o f visitors to the facility.

4.2.2

Level o f Contact

The level of contact that the proponents in each country have made with the public'is measured on the basis of the number of events that the proponents have either conducted or participated in regarding the nuclear waste issue. As mentioned in the previous chapter, the ideal way of measuring level of contact would be to determine the number o f individuals with whom contact was made. However, due to a lack of the availability o f this exact

information, the author believes that a comparison of the number of events at which contact with the public was made would provide sufficient evidence as to the level of contact that was made.

Table 7 presents a summary o f the events at which SKB made direct personal contact with the public since the implementation of the new siting strategy in 1992. As previously

-60-

m entioned, in 1992 SKB sent a letter to each o f Sw eden's 286 m unicipalities, inviting them to participate in a feasibility study. In the years following, eight municipalities would agree to conduct a feasibility study. SKB published a Feasibility Study: Final Report for each

m unicipality in which a feasibility study was conducted. Included in the Appendices o f each report is a list o f dialogue and inform ation activities conducted by SKB in the m unicipality dunng the feasibility study. After the completion o f the feasibility studies, two

m unicipalities were selected to undergo m ore detailed site investigations: Oskarsham n and Ostham mar. D uring the course o f these site investigations, early and extended consultations have been held regarding an encapsulation plant for spent fuel and the final repository (SKB, 2003).

For the purpose o f this research, contact events are considered to be any event either hosted by SKB or in w hich SKB participated, including the following; Public, information, and/or consultation meetings Public lectures; Seminars; Debates; School presentations; Fairs; V isits by SK B 's exhibition trailer; V isits by the spent fuel transport ship, M/S Sigyn; Open houses at SK B's site offices; and Study trips/excursions'^. For sim plification purposes, the author has refrained from presenting a breakdow n o f each type o f contact event. Instead, only the total num ber o f contact events m ade at each

feasibility study m unicipality is reported.

SKB has also hosted other contact events aside from those at the feasibility and site investigation municipalities, which are listed in Table 7 under the category Other. One o f these is a consultation meeting with various national authorities and government agencies regarding the scope of the upcoming EIA for the encapsulation plant and repository. In

addition, SKB has held four Annual SKB Days (2000-2003), where "politicians, decision makers and representatives of the press and the academic and business communities... discussed nuclear waste issues in Sweden and the rest of Europe" (SKB, 2003, pg. 24). The SKB Day held in 2003 more than was attended by more than two hundred delegates (SKB, 2003).

-62-

In total, there have been 807 events at which SKB has engaged the public regarding its nuclear w aste disposal strategy since the new siting strategy was implemented in 1992. The greatest num ber o f contact events occurred in the m unicipality o f Nykoping, where between M ay 1995 and A ugust 2000, there were 212 events at which SKB m ade contact w ith the public. It is interesting to note that the fewest num ber o f contact events took place at

Storum an and M ala, with thirty-four and fifty-six contact events, respectively. These two m unicipalities, w hich were the first two to volunteer to have a feasibility study conducted, w ould later hold référendum s in which the citizens opted to withdraw from further investigations. It appears that with subsequent municipalities, SKB increased its efforts to engage and m aintain a dialogue with the public, as is evidenced in the m unicipality o f N ykoping, as m entioned above, and the m unicipalities o f Ostham mar and Tierp, which had 135 and 128 contact events, respectively.

A sum m ary o f the events at which contact was m ade with the public by the EA Panel during the Panel Review o f the N uclear Fuel W aste M anagem ent and Disposal Concept is presented in Table 8. There w ere four types o f events hosted by the EA Panel during which the public was engaged and inform ed regarding the review o f the disposal concept:

·

Open houses, which were "designed to increase public awareness o f the review process, the proposal under review and the opportunities to participate" (CEAA, 1998, pg- 7); Scoping m eetings, at which the public could provide input in identifying the scope o f the proposed project and the factors that need to be considered during the environm ental assessm ent (CEAA, 2003); Public hearings; and A workshop on Aboriginal issues.

With the exception of the workshop on Aboriginal issues, each type o f contact event took place at each of the five provinces in which the review was conducted, namely New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Each type of contact event has been broken down by province.

During the Panel Review of the Nuclear Fuel Waste Management and Disposal Concept, there were 117 occasions in which the public had an opportunity to provide input. It is o f importance to note that the greatest number of contact events took place in the province o f

64-

Ontario, presum ably because the proposed geological repository w ould m ost likely be situated in an area o f the Canadian Shield in northern Ontario.

W ith respect to the num ber o f events at which the proponent in each country m ade contact w ith the public regarding the nuclear waste issue, clearly there have been far m ore such events in Sweden than there were in Canada (approxim ately eight times m ore over roughly a sim ilar given tim e period).

4.2.2

F inancial Resources D evoted to Public Engagement

Figures regarding the amount o f funding for public engagement activities in Canada and Sweden w ere obtained from the Report o f the Nuclear Fuel W aste M anagem ent and Disposal Concept Environm ental Assessment Panel and through personal correspondence w ith Sten Kjellm an o f SKB, respectively.
I

In Sweden, funding for nuclear waste management, including public engagement activities related to the siting work, is provided by the Nuclear W aste Fund (Lidskog and Andersson, 2002), as prescribed by the Financing Act, which states that "a reactor owner, in consultation with other reactor owners, shall calculate the costs for disposal o f the spent fuel and radioactive w aste" (SKB, 2003, pg. 13). The costs, which SKB has been com m issioned to

calculate and compile, are then factored into the costs o f electricity production (SKB, 2003). The N uclear W aste Fund provided an equivalent o f $500,000 CDN annually to local inform ation organizations in the feasibility m unicipalities for such things as information dissem ination and independent reviews o f SK B's work. Thus, over the course o f the eight years during which feasibility studies were conducted, a total o f $4,000,000 CDN was provided.

- 65 -

In Canada, funding to assist the public in participating in the EA Panel Review was provided by AECL (CEAA, 1998). Initially, AECL had committed to providing $750,000 for

participant funding (CEAA, 1998). In the end, a total of $852,515 was provided. These funds were disbursed on four occasions throughout the Panel Review, and required that a set of eligibility criteria be met (CEAA, 1998). A total of $152,500 was distributed in

September 1990 to assist members of the public in participating in the scoping meetings. A further $387,235 was provided in October 1994 and $210,265 in March 1995 to assist in reviewing the EIS and to participate in the public hearings. Lastly, $92,515 was distributed in October 1996 to assist participants in reviewing supplementary information (CEAA, 1998).

A comparison o f the total amount of funding that has been made available in Sweden and Canada for public engagement activities are presented in Table 9.

As is evident in the above table, there is a significant disparity in the amount of funding that has been provided for public engagement activities pertaining to nuclear waste management in Sweden and Canada.

4.3

Public Awareness o f Nuclear W aste Issues and Support for NWM Programs

R ecent public opinion surveys regarding nuclear waste were examined to determine the level o f the p u b lic's awareness o f the nuclear waste issue in Sweden and Canada. In the Swedish case, the m ain survey consulted, entitled Europeans and Radioactive W astes, was conducted by IN RA (Europe) in 2001. The main survey used in the Canadian case was conducted by N avigator in 2003 for the Nuclear W aste M anagement Organization.

A ccording to the EU survey, which asked, "How well informed do you think you are about radioactive w aste?"^^ the m ajority o f Swedes (56.5%) felt that they were "not very well inform ed" (Figure 8). On the other hand, 27.4% o f respondents replied that they were "fairly w ell inform ed". W hen combined with the 3.7% o f respondents who felt they were "very w ell inform ed" , roughly three out o f ten Swedes can be said to be well informed abput radioactive waste. Only 11.7% felt that they were "not at all well informed".

In Canada, the N avigator survey found that the public generally has low fam iliarity with nuclear w aste (Figure 9). The exact question posed by the Navigator survey was "U sing a scale betw een one and seven where one means you are not at all familiar and seven means you are very familiar, overall how familiar would you say you are with nuclear w aste and how it is m anaged in Canada?" The largest percentage o f respondents (38% ) rated

them selves a score o f 1 ("not at all familiar"). A further 31% replied with a score o f either 2

Sample size was approximately 1000 interviews, with uncertainty levels between 1.9-3.1 /o (INRA, 2002). Sample size was 1901 interviews, with a margin o f error o f +/- 2.25%, 19 times out o f 20.

or 3 and a combined 21% gave a score of 4 or 5. Only 5% o f respondents felt that they were "very familiar", with a further 4% giving a score of 6.

The next survey question examined dealt with public support for the nuclear waste m anagem ent program s in each country. The survey used in the Swedish case was conducted b y the polling firm Tem o for SKB regarding a deep repository (Temo, 2005). In the

Canadian case, the survey used was conducted by Environics Research Group in 2003 for the Canadian N uclear Association (Environics, 2003). One o f the questions posed in the Swedish survey was "If a suitable site for a deep repository can be found in your m unicipality, would you then be for or against an establishm ent?" (Figure 10). A t the national level, 41% o f respondents replied that they would be in favour o f a deep repository. 51% responded that they were against a deep repository, with 8% being undecided. It should be noted that in the two municipalities currently undergoing detailed
Sample size at the national level was 1000 interviews, and 800 interviews in each o f Oskarshamn and Osthammar.

-69-

site investigations, Oskarshamn and Osthammar, the percentage o f respondents who were in favour of a deep repository were considerably higher at 76% and 71%, respectively. This supports SKB's assertion that "the closer people live to a projected deep repository facility, the more they support it. This is probably due to the body o f knowledge built up over a number of years" (Thegerstrom, 2004).

The question posed in the Canadian survey was "In general, would you say that you are very, somewhat, not very, or not at all confident that the authorities responsible for nuelear waste have a good system in place to deal with it?"^^ Although this question is somewhat different from the question posed in the Swedish survey, it conveys a similar sentiment regarding support for the program or system in place for managing nuclear wastes. According to the

Sample size was 2,018 interviews, with a margin of error o f +/- 2.2%, 19 times out of 20.

This thesis asks the question "How significant is effective public engagement in successfully im plem enting a nuclear waste management program ?" It has discussed this question based on the understanding that the siting o f a HLRW facility is both a public acceptance as well as a technical process. It has sought to answer this question through a comparative analysis o f the public engagem ent program s o f Sweden and Canada.

This three-part study utilized a review o f primary and secondary sources to first compare the progress and current status o f the nuclear waste m anagement program s o f Sweden and Canada. It also compared three specific measures o f public engagement; access to

inform ation, level o f contact and financial resources devoted to public engagement. Thirdly, a com parison was m ade between the effectiveness o f each country's public engagement activities. This was done by comparing opinion surveys regarding public awareness o f the nuclear w aste issue and popular support for the nuclear waste managem ent programs in each country. B eyond the specific m easures o f public engagement examined in this study, there are other factors that have played a role in the progress o f the Swedish nuclear waste m anagem ent program , nam ely the strong role and close involvement o f its nuclear regulatory authorities.

Lim itations

A lthough every effort has been m ade to ensure thoroughness and accuracy in the analyses perform ed in this study, as has been previously mentioned, there were som e limitations.

With respect to the comparison of the levels o f contact in each country, the most effective measure of the contact made between proponents and the public would have been a record o f the actual number of individuals with whom contact was made. Unfortunately, the lack o f attendance records during the open houses, scoping meetings and public hearings for the Canadian Panel Review did not make this possible. As a result, an analysis was instead performed on the number of events during which public contact was made.

With regard to the comparison of survey results to determine public support for each country's nuclear waste management program, the study was limited to the available surveys from each country. Unfortunately, the survey questions asked in each country did not

explicitly ask the same question, thus cannot be fully regarded as yielding the same answers. However, the responses to both surveys, to a large degree, reflect the level of public support for their respective country's nuclear waste management programs.

Conclusions

The qualitative review of various primary and secondary source documents regarding the nuclear waste management programs of Sweden and Canada, which included reports from each country's nuclear authorities, government publications, journal articles, correspondence with various organizations, authorities and/or individuals, revealed that Sweden's nuclear waste management program has progressed much further than that o f Canada. The timelines reveal that both countries began pursuing the idea of geological disposal at roughly the same time, but the Swedish KBS-3 method received government approval in 1983, while the Canadian concept has yet to be approved. Obtaining the government's approval for a

disposal method can be seen as a significant milestone in the development of a nuclear waste

74-

m anagem ent program . Thus, when considering the current status o f each country's program, it can be said that the Swedish program is in fact m ore than twenty years ahead o f the Canadian program in term s o f obtaining approval for a disposal method and in the search for a disposal site. This finding is consistent with the literature, which acknowledges that Sweden, am ong all nuclear producing nations, is furthest along in the process o f siting a HLRW facility.

The quantitative analyses perform ed on the three measures o f public engagement revealed that the proponents o f Sw eden's nuclear waste management program have placed a m uch greater emphasis on public participation with respect to the nuclear waste m anagem ent program than the proponents o f the Nuclear Fuel W aste M anagement and Disposal Concept in Canada, as is evident in the Panel Review.

Sw eden's nuclear authorities have made available to the public a far greater num ber o f inform ation m aterials than were m ade available during the Panel Review in Canada (127 in Sweden, compared to 57 in Canada). This demonstrates that Swedes have greater access to inform ation regarding the nuclear waste management program than Canadians.

In addition to the sheer num ber o f materials that have been published in Sweden, it is also o f im portance to note the type o f materials that were made available. In Canada, the Federal Environm ental Assessm ent and Review Office (FEARO) informed the public using two types o f media: news releases and a periodical news bulletin entitled D ialogue. In Sweden, however, in addition to providing the public information through news releases, SKB produced brochures, a quarterly magazine, known as Lagerbladet, as well as videos and other reports describing the nuclear waste issue and proposed m anagement program (Kjellman,

-75

2004). Although the effects of having different types of information material on the public's access to that information is beyond the scope of this study, it is likely that the greater variety in the types o f information materials made available in Sweden would result in a greater penetration of the information into the general public. Furthermore, it is also interesting to note the difference in the nature of the information materials published by each proponent regarding the nature and management of nuclear waste in general (not dealing with the siting or decision-making process). Although this ' Study did not include a formal content analysis o f the information materials, the difference in the nature of some of the reports from each country is worth mentioning. For instance, in December, 1989, FEARO informed the public of the availability of several documents, which would assist them in preparing for the scoping meetings (CEAA, 1998). These

documents were An Issue Paper on the Management of Nuclear Fuel Wastes (Lura Group, 1989), A Review of Various Approaches Being Undertaken bv Industrialized Nations for the Management and Disposal of High-Level Nuclear Waste (Acres International, 1989), and Managing Canada's Nuclear Fuel Wastes (AECL, 1989). A brief overview o f these

documents would reveal that they are rather technical in nature and thus perhaps not easily ' comprehensible to the average person. In Sweden, although "[t]he principal cornerstone in

building confidence consists of ensuring that SKB makes all its scientific and technical reports available to the public" (Lidskog and Andersson, 2002, pg. 75), the information material SKB published specifically for the public, such as Deep Repository for Spent Nuclear Fuel and This Is How We Manage Sweden's Radioactive Waste, was written using fairly simple language that nearly any member of society would be able to understand, regardless of their education level. These documents also contained numerous pictures and

- 76 -

diagram s to illustrate the messages and ideas being conveyed. This is further evidence that the inform ation provided in Sweden regarding nuclear w aste has a much wider reach among the general public.

The distribution o f these information materials is also o f importance when considering public access to information. Comparing for the m oment only the Swedish magazine Lagerbladet and the Canadian news bulletin Dialogue, it is important to note that while in the Canadian case, one had to be on the nuclear fuel waste m anagem ent concept m ailing list in order to receive the bulletin, in Sweden, the magazine is automatically sent to every single household in the tw o municipalities where site investigations are taking place, in addition to any individual or organization in the rest o f the country who requests a copy. SKB also m ade its inform ation available by electronic access through Sw eden's libraries. This again is

indicative o f the greater penetration o f information material in Sweden's general public than in C anada's. A com parison o f the num ber o f visits to each country's nuclear research facilities revealed that Sw eden's nuclear research facilities have hosted a far greater number o f visitors than their Canadian counterpart. As nuclear research facilities m ay be considered direct sources o f inform ation about nuclear waste and nuclear waste management, the greater num ber o f visitors to Sw eden's Aspo HRL (89,468, compared to 9,648 to AECL's URL) is further evidence that, with regard to nuclear waste and nuclear waste management, the Swedish public has been given greater access to information. Although it may be argued that perhaps there have been a greater num ber o f visitors to Sw eden's Aspo HRL than A EC L's URL sim ply because the Aspo HRL is more conveniently located than AECL s URL, the fact that there w as a sharp increase in the num ber o f visitors to the Aspo HRL during the peak o f the

-77-

feasibility study activities suggests that it is not just a matter of convenience, but rather a reflection of the proponent (SKB's) level of outreach. The next public engagement measure that was analyzed was the level of contact that the proponents in each country engaged in with the public regarding the nuclear waste issue. The results of the analysis revealed that the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) made contact with the public 807 times between 1992-2004, as compared to the 117 contact events hosted by the Canadian EA Panel. The amount of contact that SKB has made with the public can be seen as the foundation of the Swedish voluntary process for siting its deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel. In a lecture presented by SKB at the Sixth European Commission (EC) and international conference on the management and disposal of radioactive waste (Euradwaste '04) "the importance o f the involvement of . stakeholders in the process of decision-making and implementation was stressed" (Thegerstrom et ah, 2004). The presenters further noted that "[djialogue and transparency is (sic) necessary to build the broad social trust needed for a fair and successful decision process" (Thegerstrom et ah, 2004). Although there are certainly numerous other factors that, together, have accounted for the opposition to the Canadian disposal concept, it is clear from the research literature and the empirical evidence that, in itself, insufficient contact with and involvement by the public in the nuclear waste issue has been the main downfall o f the Canadian nuclear waste management program, and may in large measure explain the failure o f its voluntary siting initiative.

The third public engagement measure that was analyzed in this study was the amount of funding that was allocated by the proponents in each country for public participation actiAdties. It is clear from the comparison that there is a huge disparity between the amount

-78 -

o f public participation funding m ade available in Sweden and Canada. The am ount provided b y AECL to assist the public in participating in the EA Panel Review ($852,515) is m erely a fraction o f the total amount allocated by the Nuclear W aste Fund to the local information organizations in each o f the feasibility study m unicipalities (the equivalent o f $4,000,000 CDN). As has been reported in the research literature, the lack o f effort and funding in

enlisting the public to help find a solution to the nuclear waste dilem ma can only lead to continued opposition (Flynn et al., 1992). SKB's funding has provided the public and

m unicipalities with the tools and means to objectively review their work, extend their know ledge o f the nuclear waste issue and have a meaningful role in the decision-making process. This is clearly a significant factor in the support for and acceptance o f Sw eden's plans for a deep geological repository.

The final analysis conducted in this study was a comparison o f the levels o f public awareness o f the nuclear w aste issue and public support for the respective nuclear waste m anagem ent program s o f each country. This was done to verify the effectiveness o f each country's public engagem ent activities. W ith respect to the public awareness o f nuclear waste issues, the

analysis revealed that in both Sweden and Canada, the percentage o f each population that claim ed to have a high level o f awareness was quite low (3.7% in Sweden reported they were very well informed, while a combined 9% in Canada reported high familiarity). A t the other end o f the spectrum, the surveys revealed that in Sweden, only 11.7% o f the population reported that they w ere "not at all well informed" about radioactive waste. This is

considerably less than the percentage Canadians who reported that they w ere "not at all fam iliar" (38%). Alternatively, roughly 88% o f Sweden's population has at least some

lim ited know ledge o f nuclear waste, while in Canada the comparable figure is only 61%.

-79-

This suggests that the public engagement activities conducted by Sweden's nuclear  authorities have been considerably more effective at penetrating the awareness of the general population than those of their Canadian counterparts. With regards to public support for nuclear waste management programs, it would appear from the comparison of the survey results that support for the nuclear waste management system in Sweden is significantly greater than in Canada. At the national level, 41% of Swedes would accept a deep repository if it were to be found in their municipality (Temo, 2005). Although in Canada, the siting process has not been reached, it may be presumed that acceptance of a deep repository must be preceded by a high level of confidence in the nuclear authorities and the nuclear waste management system in place. According to an Environics survey, only 7% of Canadians reported having this high level of confidence (Environics, : 2003). Thus it may be concluded that the public engagement efforts of Sweden's nuclear authorities have been successtul at not only increasing public awareness of the nuclear waste ' issue, but also increasing public support for its nuclear waste management program. This conclusion is supported by the fact that support for a deep repository is even greater in the two municipalities undergoing detailed site investigations (76% in Oskarshamn and 71% in Osthammar), where public engagement activities are high and the public has greater awareness.

While it is true that the Canadian process has not progressed to the point where specific potential sites have been identified, clearly the inadequacy of the EA Panel to effectively engage the public in the nuclear waste issue and its failure to provide the public with a meaningful role in the decision making process has resulted in low public awareness o f the

-80-

issue, and as naturally follows, low confidence (support) for the nuclear waste management program .

Through the analyses performed in this study, it is clearly evident that Sweden has taken great strides in its voluntary process to site a deep repository for its spent nuclear fuel. SKB has produced and m ade available to the public a large amount o f information through several m eans to increase the public's knowledge o f nuclear waste, the nuclear waste issue, and its proposed m ethod for disposing o f nuclear waste. It has actively engaged the public and

m aintained a strong presence in the public eye, as is evidenced by the large num ber o f contact events it has hosted or participated in. Its commitment to involving the public has also been proven through the amount o f financial resources they allocate to public inform ation activities. This study has shown that these efforts have paid off. The nuclear w aste issue is som ething that the m ajority o f Swedes is at least somewhat aware of, w ith 4 out o f 10 Swedes willing to accept a repository in their municipality. This study has

provided em pirical evidence that the progress o f the Swedish nuclear waste managem ent strategy is directly attributable to the efforts o f SKB to involve the public in the decision m aking process. This study has also shown the inadequacy o f the avenues for public participation during the C anadian Panel Review o f the Nuclear Fuel W aste M anagement and Disposal Concept. The analyses o f public engagement measures found the Canadian case to be substandard com pared to the Swedish case in all three measures (number o f information materials published, level o f contact and financial resources devoted to public engagement). This m ay be attributed to the fact that public participation during the Panel Review was limited to the requirem ents o f the Environmental Assessment and Review Process Guidelines Order.,

-

81 -

namely scoping meetings and public hearings. The Panel Review's finding that AECL's concept did not have broad social acceptability and thus, could not likely be stied is clear evidence of the inadequacies of the public participation process.

i

In November of this year, the Nuclear Waste Management Organization will be releasing its ; final recommendations with respect to the long-term management o f Canada's nuclear fuel

Î,wastes.

Since 2002, the NWMQ has sought to get Canadians involved in identifying

important issues, developing a framework with which to analyze nuclear waste management approaches and providing recommendations with respect to the preferred management approach (NWMQ, 2003). Although a formal analysis of the public engagement measures that have been undertaken by the NWMO is not included in this study, it seems apparent that their efforts to collaboratively develop a management approach have been a significant improvement over the status quo that was evident during Panel Review. It reflects the

' NWMO's recognition of the shortcomings of the previous process and of the level o f effort that is required in order to have a successful nuclear waste management program in Canada.

It is pertinent at this point to discuss another factor, which, in the author's opinion, has also played a significant role in the success of the Swedish process. Although this thesis has focused on public participation in the nuclear waste siting process, throughout the course o f , this research, the importance of a strong presence of nuclear regulatory authorities became quite evident. In Sweden, for instance, the two regulatory authorities, namely the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate (SKI)) and the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority (SSI) have maintained an active role throughout the siting process. With SKB being responsible for the handling and disposal of nuclear wastes, one of the roles of SKI and SSI is to ensure that SKB lives up to this responsibility (Westerlind and Hedberg, 2000). For example, all of

-82-

SKB s research regarding final disposal o f spent nuclear fuel is subject to review by both SKI and SSI (SKI, 2005; SSI, 2004). The regulatory authorities, particularly SSI, are also responsible for ensuring compliance with radiation protection regulations. \ In addition to the above duties that have heen set out by Swedish legislation" , SKI and SSI have taken their responsibilities one step further by becom ing m ore active in the siting process. One o f the reasons for this was an increased demand from municipalities for greater presence fi'om the regulatory authorities, having been viewed as independent and credible governm ent bodies (W esterlind and Hedberg, 2000). Since about 1995, SKI and SSI have played an active role in the consultations, investigations and decision-making process.

Furtherm ore, SKI and SSI have undertaken joint projects, such as the joint information project, w hich began in 1997 (SSI, 2004). The aim o f the information project is "to clarify [the regulatory authorities'] roles and responsibilities, and increase knowledge about radiation, radiation protection and nuclear waste safety issues" (Pensjo, 2004, pg. 1). The activities that have been conducted under this joing information project include study trips, sem inars, education programs for teachers, exhibitions, surveys, as well as the publication o f various types o f information materials (SSI, 2004). SKI and SSI have also conducted

research relating to risk communication and transparency in decision m aking processes. The jo in t research project, dubbed RISCOM, began as a pilot project 1998 and sought to "understand how facts, expert judgm ent and value judgm ent interact to form the basis o f a decision" (W esterlind and Hedberg, 2000, pg. 113). Its overall objective is to aid in the

developm ent o f transparency in nuclear waste management program s (Andersson et al., 2003). The research led to, among other things, the design o f public hearings, which

-83 -

previously had not been used in Swedish decision-making processes, as part o f the review o f 'SKB's proposal of candidate sites for a deep repository (Andersson et al., 2003).

The high degree of involvement of the regulatory authorities in Sweden has further increased the public's trust, which makes the acceptance o f a disposal method and eventual site all the more likely. This involvement was not evident during the Canadian Panel Review. Canada's nuclear regulatory body, the Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB) was conspicuously absent throughout most of the public hearings, leaving the proponent (AECL) to field most o f the questions. Although it is beyond the scope of this thesis, the experience o f the Swedish regulatory authorities would seem to indicate that greater involvement and a stronger presence on the part of AECB in the future could also facilitate greater social acceptance o f a nuclear waste strategy.

This study has shown that in order to achieve a successfial nuclear waste management program and siting process, the public must be adequately informed and meaningfully involved. The work of the NWMO, although far from being completed, has indicated that the Canadian process is slowly moving in this right direction. Although the siting o f nuclear and Other hazardous waste facilities using the classic Decide-Announce-Defend approach is now widely recognized as unwise and futile, most nuclear producing nations have yet to adopt an open voluntary process in their nuclear decision making. It is the author's hope that this research has shed some light on the virtues of meaningful public participation, and helps to unravel the nuclear waste siting dilemma.
