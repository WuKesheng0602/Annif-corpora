gi'own by the traveling solvent method is presented. The full steady state Navier-Stokes equations, as well as the energy, continuity and the mass transport equations, were solved numerically using the finite element technique. It is found that a strong convective flow exists in the solvent, which is known to be undesirable to achieve a uniform crystal. An external axial magnetic field is applied to suppress this convection. By increasing the magnetic induction, it is observed that the intensity of the flow at the centre of the crucible reduces at a faster rate than near the wall. This phenomenon creates a stable and flat growth interface and the silicon distribution in the horizontal plane becomes relatively homocentric. The maximum velocity is found to obey a power law with respect to the Hartmann number: o c .

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW
1.1 Introduction
Semiconductors are a group of materials having intermediate electric conductivities between metals and insulators. Conductivity of these materials can be varied over orders of magnitude by changes in temperature or impurity content. The electric properties of semiconductor materials are strongly affected by impurities. This variability of their electric properties makes semiconductors a wise choice for electronic devices [1]. Computer microchips, optoelectronic sensors, lasers. X-ray detectors, transistors in pocket radios and solar cells that provide electric power in artificial satelhtes are just some of the examples of semiconductor devices [3], [4]. The advantages of semiconductors are that they use much less power, they last longer and they can be built significantly smaller [3]. Today, the largest made single crystals are for the semiconductor industry. Silicon is used in nearly all semiconductor materials. On their own, single crystals of silicon cannot compete with other materials in areas such as mobile phones, global positioning systems (GPS) and optoelectronics. The fact that integrated circuits can be made today is the result of a considerable progress in the growth of pure, single crystals of Si [1]. The performance of silicon transistors and circuits can be improved upon by the additions of other semiconductor materials hke germanium, which opens up the material to

numerous new applications. Silicon germanium (SiGe) technology has given rise into low-cost, lightweight, personal communication devices such as digital wireless handsets. SiGe uses minimum power so that it extends the life of wireless phone,batteries. SiGe plays a significant role in the development of other entertainment and information technologies such as digital set-top boxes, Dhect Broadcast Satellites (DBS), automobile radar systems, and personal digital assistants. SiGe characteristically carries smaller and more efficient devices into communication technologies [5]. Also, Silicon Germanium is used in the automotive industry in sensors for collision avoidance radars, road speed monitors and electronic tolls and traffic management systems [6].

1.2 What is a Single Crystal?
A crystal is a solid material that has a regular internal arrangement of atoms, ions or molecules, known as a 3D crystal structure [4]. A crystalline solid is defined by arrangement of atoms in a periodic fashion. There is some basic arrangement of atoms that is repeated through the entire solid [1]. Since the periodicity is revealed, the crystal appears exactly the same at one point as at other points. In single crystals, atoms are arranged following specific patterns throughout tire entire piece of material; i.e., long-range order exists throughout all single crystal materials. However, not all solids are crystals (Figure 1); some that have no periodic structure at all are called amorphous solids and some that are composed of many small regions of single crystal materials, are called polycrystalline solids. The periodic array of atoms in a single crystal is called a lattice. There are many ways of placing atoms in a volume; the difference in

distances between atoms foim different lattices. The lattice contains a volume, which is called unit cell; it is representative of the entire lattice and is regularly repeated tlirough the crystal [1].

A whole range of useful substances have crystalline structures, including metals (e.g., aluminium, iron, titanium, copper), inorganic compounds (e.g., silicongermanium, cadmium telluride, gallium antimonide) and biological

macromolecules (e.g., proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates). In nature, there are seven generic types of unit cells; namely cubic, tetragonal, rhombic, hexagonal, triagonal, monoclinic and triclinic (their differences are in the edge lengths and angles). The three simplest 3D lattices are shown in the following picture. Imagine millions of these cubes arranged next to each other in 3D; that is the concept of a crystal.

For the semiconductors of today's technological aspects, it is required to have the highest crystalline order as is possible in order to get the best performance out of a material. For example, if it were possible to get a large enough pure single crystal for night vision, it would be possible to see at night just as clear as in the day. Figure 2 shows the uniformity and order that exists in a single crystal.

Single crystals are used in electrical and optical devices, solid-state lasers, infrared detectors and a wide range of medical and industiial applications. Single crystals of silicon play an important role in industry. As mentioned above, all-modern electronics from telecommunications to consumer

electronics, from gaming consoles to life-saving medical equipment, are built from silicon.

1.3 What is Crystal Growth?
Semiconducting single crystals are vital to the electronic industry [8]. Unfortunately they are full of defects and impurities. A number of methods have been developed to grow these materials. These materials, such as silicon, first have to be produced with an acceptable purity and then grown as single crystals under very specific conditions. The properties of a material are extremely fluctuating with these imperfections in the crystalline lattice. Therefore, the crystal has to be produced with a high level of purity and homogeneity with these methods. Defections lead to a reduction in the quality of the crystal. There could be a missing atom or an extra atom in the lattice or there could be dislocations. Although the ideal condition is provided in the form of pure crystal with no such dislocations or impurities, it is essential for semiconductor materials to be provided with the right amount of impurities added to perform their best function regar ding the fact that there is a connection between the resulting crystal quality, its physical properties and the growth parameters. The very common process that has been used in industry is crystallization from the melt. Growing a solid crystal from the liquid is a technique which produces crystals from their solution, in relativeb' low temperature. Gravity also plays a role in the crystalhzation process and it contributes in the mass and heat transport. Because of the buoyancy, there is a convective fluid flow which results in causing an uneven concentration distribution in the melt.

as well as reducing the perfection of the growth.

1.4 Methods of Suppressing Convection in the M elt 1.4.1 Microgravity Condition
An alternative method for reducing buoyancy-driven convection is growing the crystals in a reduced gravity environment. This has been observed in many space experiments. Under reduced gravity conditions, scientists can grow crystal that is not affected by buoyancy convection and hydrostatic pressure. These materials will have different applications such as in computer microchips, optoelectronic sensors, lasers, and X-ray detectors [4], It should be mentioned that even the attainable space environment does not provide zero gravity.

1.4.2 Use of Magnetic Field in the Melt Growth
Metals and semiconductor melts have a relatively high electrical conductivity. By applying a magnetic field, this char acteristic can be used to suppress natural convective fluid flows in the melt [8]. It is therefore useful to observe the effect of magnetic field damping as against gravity reduction. The application of an external magnetic field to suppress convection has been found to be very beneficial and efficient. The applied magnetic field could be static or dynamic (with rotation), vertical or transverse. This section focuses on the effects of applying a steady (static) magnetic field (transverse and axial) to a crystal growth melt. The objective is to minimize the effect of convection in the solution. The wealcer the convection in the solution.

the higher the growth rate will be. The level of tlie magnetic field has a significant effect on #ie intensity of the convective flow in the solution and the shape of the growth interface. The shape of growth interface becomes more unifoim at a specific amount of magnetic field. Therefore the magnetic field intensity must be optimized. It should be mentioned that magnetic field damping is dependant on the Lorentz force, which is proportional to the vector product of the flow velocity and the magnetic field intensity. It therefore has an increasing effect with decreasing the flow velocity. A magnetic field is a region of space near a magnetized body where magnetic forces can be detected. It should be mentioned that the magnetic field induction vector, B, also called the magnetic flux density, is the intensity of a magnetic field and indicates the direction of magnetic lines at any point in the domain (Figures 4 and 5). The magnetic field induction vectors are tangent to the field hnes. Magnetic flux density (magnetic field induction) is measured in Webbers per square meter [Wb/m^]. A Webber is equivalent to a volt-second. The unit of Webber per square meter is also called a tesla (in the Metric system or gauss in the cgs system) [9]. Expeifmental studies indicate that the effective field magnitudes are in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 tesla (T). These fields have to be generated in a large volume and the bore must be large enough to embrace the crucible, the heater and the heat shields (if any). Therefore, for a small field value of only a few tenths of a tesla a large amount of the power supplied is needed. The magnetic field also imposes stresses on the crucible heater. In order to avoid resonance of periodic

currents and fatigue failure, the heater current must be DC [8]. The simplest examples of field that can be applied are those provided between the pole pieces of a conventional electromagnet, (figure 6) and that of a simple, wire-wound solenoid (figure?). These are the two configurations which have been studied the most. These equipments can provide axial and transverse

magnetic fields, respectively. It was found that the wire-wound solenoids are easier to operate and easier to fabricate. Also, it is easy to modify them. By adding some windings to the latter it would be possible to change its characteristic. The power that is usually needed for crystal growth is somewhat about 100 kW (in order to obtain tenths of tesla), therefore the windings have to have as low resistance as possible with high conductivity such as copper [8].

1.5 Literature Review
Different techniques have been used in industry for crystal growth with different sizes. New methods of crystal growth, such as the Traveling Solvent Method (TSM) [2], also known as the Traveling Heater Method (THM), the Bridgman method [10-16], the Floating Zone method [17-19], the Czchralski method [20] and the Liquid Phase Electroepitaxy (LPEE) method [21] are being used in order to provide good quahty crystals. Among different growth techniques, the TSM is particularly useful for the growth of bulk crystals [2] due to their characteristically large segregation effect between solid and liquid [22]. Another advantage of the TSM for crystal growth is that the process takes place at a relatively low temperature compared to the melting point of the crystal. Therefore, the pressure and the contamination from quartz as well as the

probability of the ampoule fracture reduces and crystal grows with less thermal stresses and more purity [23, 25]. Ye ef al. [26] studied natural convection and its effects on the growth rate and uniformity as well as its effect on temperature distribution and solute distribution by the Traveling Heater Method (THM) of CdTe single crystal. Temperature, solute concentration and fluid flow fields in the growth ampoule were numerically simulated. They also showed, experimentally and

numerically, that the concentration distributions, as weU as growth interface, are substantially affected by convective mass transport. They realized that in order to achieve a uniform growth interface the natural convection should be as weak as possible. The influence of natural convection on the growth rate along the interface for different heater thermal profiles, with diiferent positions of maximum temperature in the solvent (different offsets) was also investigated. They found that a smaller thermal gradient and larger offset lead to a more uniform growth. Numerical simulation for the growth of GalnSb by the THM method was presented by Meric et al. [24]. It was found that the behaviour of the growth and its stability were significantly influenced by the thermal and solutal convection in the solution zone. The THM technique was also used for studies of the effects of thermal conditions for the growth of HgTe [27]. The study showed the reduction in heat transfer between the .furnace and the ampoule increased the length of the liquid zone and also increased the growth rate significantly. The numerical simulation of concentration distribution showed a uniform

concentration in the solvent region and a small concentration gradient along the growtli interface indicated the importance of the convection. Matasmnoto et al. [28] carried out a numerical simulation of InP crystal growth by the traveling heater method. The transient crystal growth process was simulated without heater movement until the process reached a steady state. They found that in the case of strong buoyancy convection, constitutional supercooling took place near tlie interface, since the case of weak buoyancy convection doesn't show the same behaviour. Okano et al. [25] focused on controlling the interface shape by numerically simulating the THM growth process. This report examines how this crystal interface shape is affected by the crucible temperature, crucible rotation and crucible material. This model employed actual temperature profiles obtained from an experimental process. They found that by increasing the temperature, the interface curvature became larger. The apphcation of rotation was successful in suppressing the natural convection in the solution, and they achieved an interface with less curvature for both the higher and lower temperature cases. They also considered two crucibles made of pBN and Si02. With pBN at low temperatures no crystal growth v/as achieved. This was because the thermal conductivity of pBN slowed down the radial heat conduction into the solution. Consequently, they realized that a higher growth temperature is required for use of pBN crucible compared with a system using SiOz crucible. This study showed that tire higher the temperature, the more curvature forms along tire

12

growth interface and rotation is useful in decreasing the curvature along the interface. The effect of the supply of Si solute elements on the concentration distribution in the Si-rich SiGe bulk crystals was studied by Nakajima et al. [30]. It was done by using the multi-component zone melting method. They concluded that by controlling the pulling rate. Si-rich Sii-xGCx bulk crystals with a uniform composition of x= 0.1 would be obtained. This is because with this method they could keep the position and temperature of the interface constant. Azuma et a l [10] developed an automatic feedback control system from the crystal-melt interface position in order to keep the interface growtli temperature constant during the process. They could monitor the position of the interface. Thereby, the position of the pulling rod was corrected according to the position of the interface and they obtained uniform concentration distribution. They also realized that with the feedback control system- they could achieve uniform composition for SiGe crystal with different composition such as Si-rich SiGe. Hgi-xMuxTe bulk crystals were produced by Reig et al. [30] by using the cold traveling heater method. They attained crystals with homogeneous

concentration and they could reduce the high pressure of Hg vapour during the production of the alloy. Lent et al. [31] presented a numerical simulation of Gai-xIUxSb bulk single crystals grown by the traveling heater method. They found that the temperature profile has a significant influence on stability and the behavioui' of the crystal

growth. They reahzed that convective fluid flow, which is caused by gravity, plays an important role in this process. Therefore, in order to suppress the convective fluid flow in the solvent they applied different levels of magnetic induction. They also considered the misalignment of the magnetic field. The convective flow due to small misalignment was found being useful for the growth process. They realized that a limitation of the amount of misalignment exists and any higher than that would make the process unstable. They also reported that a stationary magnetic field of 2 tesla (T) is sufficient to suppress the gravity effects. A theoretical analysis of the InP crystal growth experiment by the traveling heater method was performed by Senchenkov et al. [32]. They observed the effectiveness of controlling heat and mass transport in the solvent by applying Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF). They produced the crystal with RMF, with the intensities of 1 and 2 mT. They found that the convective fluid flow in the melt and growth rate are significantly influenced by these amounts of field intensity. They also found that the concentration distribution along the crystals in the microgravity condition with and without RMF showed that the mass transfer would be nearly diffusive in the absence of RMF and would become convective with RMF. V Dost et al. [20] presented the continuum model for the liquid phase electroepitaxial (LPEE) growth process of GaAs semiconductor under stationary magnetic field. They observed the effect of the applied electric field and the electric field which was produced by the applied magnetic field, on the

fluid flow and concentration distribution for different intensities of magnetic field. They found that the three dimensional results are more complex than two dimensional results. Simulation results showed three distinct characteristics depending on the magnetic field intensity. For weak magnetic induction a significant reduction in the flow intensity was observed, which is desirable for a crystal growth. By increasing magnetic field induction the two strong convective cells were shifted to the vertical wall of the criicible and created a Hartmann layer. At higher magnetic induction in the stable region, the Hartman layer became thinner and the flow became homocentric and axisymmetric. They found that the applied magnetic field suppressed the flow in the growth process. They also showed that for Hartmann {Ha) number higher than 150, the flow velocity increases and loses its axisymmetry. For Ha number between 150 and 220 they obtained a transient region and higher than 220 tliey obtained a completely unstable region and the flow structure changed over time. They also observed non-uniformity near the interface. Therefore, the effect of magnetic field would not be useful anymore. They also investigated that in the stable region the maximum velocity (CLax) obeys a power law of Ha~^"^,

whereas in the unstable region the velocity obeys approximately a power law of

concluded that magnetic field is a feasible option to control the crystal growth of Yba2 Cu3 0 xSingle CdHgTe crystals have been grown by Senchenkov and Iris coworkers [34] using the traveling heater method. They applied rotating magnetic field with intensities between 2 and 6 mT. They found radial concentration homogeneity by applying a rotating magnetic field and they obtained an axisymmetric growth condition. They realized that, by applying the proper magnetic field intensity, they can control the growth interface with the desired shape and large diameter crystals with appropriate concentration. Liu et al. [22] presented the 3D numerical simulation for the gi'owth of CdTe single crystals under an apphed axial static magnetic field by the traveling heater method. The effect of different magnetic field intensities on the flow, concentration distribution and the temperature fields in the solvent were examined. They found that an external stationary magnetic field is beneficial to suppress the convective fluid flow in the solvent. They have also shown that by applying relatively higher field intensities they obtain weaker convection in the solvent. This results in a homogeneous concentration distribution and uniform temperature distributions, with better growth interface for certain specific magnetic field intensities. They also showed that the flow fields exhibit three distinct regions of magnetic field induction. A stable flow which is found to be beneficial for the growth, a transitional flow in which the flow would not show axisymmetric behaviour but still stable, and an unstable flow showing unstable behaviour. The flow patterns were found significantly different from each other.

The influence of rotating magnetic field (RMF) on the flow pattern and compositional uniformity in the solution zone of the traveling heater method (THM) system for the growth of CdTe is numerically investigated by Ghaddar et al. [35]. They presented the simulation results for low gravity and high gravity levels. They found that under the microgravity condition, the application of RMF can be beneficial to overwhelm the residual buoyancy-induced convection and to obtain more uniformity of the solvent zone composition without changing the growth interface shape. At high-gravity levels, RMF is found unable to completely overwhelm the convective flow field. For relatively high magnetic field induction, RMF was found to result a complex flow structure in the melt and non-uniformities at the growth interface, and was also found to increase convexity of the growth interface. Gelfat [36] showed experimental results on semiconductor single crystal growth under microgravity and the other techniques in order to obtain better materials. He realized that the electromagnetic fields are the most effective technique to suppress the convective flows of a non-gravity condition. He also presented that steady magnetic field is useful to suppress the convective fluid flow but he mentioned that the applied static magnetic field intensity should not exceed over the stable region otherwise asymmetric behaviors would be obtained. He also realized that an alternating magnetic field needs less power and the equipment of an alternating magnetic field is smaller and easier to be fabricated. This type of magnetic field also stabilizes the flow in the melt. He mentioned that in order to get the optimum condition for semiconductor single crystal growth, applying

a magnetic field under the microgravity condition is a promising technique. 3D numerical simulation of the melt flow in the presence of a rotating magnetic field was studied by Vizman et al. [37]. They found that by rotating magnetic field they can obtain a stable melt flow.

CHAPTER 2 A THEORETICAL APPROACH

Thereafter the governing equations are transformed into a dimensionless form. The step-by-step dimensional analysis done for all of the equations is presented in appendix B.

Equations (2.1) to (2.3) correspond to the naomentum equations (Navier-Stokes) in the solvent region in the radial (r), angular (< p) and axial (z) directions. In these equations w , v and w are the three velocity components in the radial (r), angular (y) and axial (z) directions, and v, p, T , T^, c, c^, /? , , and are

current which traverse magnetic lines of force give rise to an additional force acting on the element [8] called the Lorentz force, which is defined as: L= (2.9)

where J is current density. The current density is given from the extended Ohm's law: J =o(E+FxB) (2.10)

where < 7 is the electrical conductivity of the fluid (assumed isotropic), E is electric field, and V is the vector flow velocity. For all kinds of crystal growth, the externally imposed field can be applied into the MHD equations. Therefore, B can be replaced by B^, the externally imposed field. By inserting equation (2.9) into Navier-Stokes equation, magnetohydrodynamics equations would be obtained. Substituting equation (2.10) into (2.9) yields:
Z, = o ( E + y x B J x B . / (2.11)

where jB,,is the externally imposed field (please see appendix A for more details). The components of the Lorentz force would represent the components of magnetic force in the Navier-Stokes equations, which were presented in equations (2.1) to (2.3). In crystal growth, with a steady applied magnetic field, one can use E=- V< P for the electric field. In this study, the electric field, E, is neglected in equation (2.11). However this assumption is valid only for the case of steady two-dimensional flows as described in ref. [8]. Moreover, the effect of the electric field on the numerical results was recently discussed [15]. Based on

ref. [15] for the axial steady magnetic field case, by assuming axisymmetric flow, there is no potential build up and therefore neglecting V 0 is reasonable. In addition, to justify the statement above, E=- V< P is also included in the simulation and the same result was obtained as with no electric field. In this model an axial static magnetic field is applied and it is assumed to be perfectly aligned with the axis of the furnace. Therefore, the two components B] and B 2 are set equal to zero. The applied static axial magnetic field is considered as:

=

(2 .12)

where g. is the unit vector in z-direction. The magnetic body force (Lorentz force) would be:

L =J x B

(2.13)

As discussed, the induced electiic field due to the applied magnetic field and the fluid motion is neglected. Therefore:

J = o(B ^ve^-B ^ ue ^)

(2.14)

Tlie magnetic body force would then be given as:

=

= -a B /(w g , +ve^)

(2.15)

Therefore the components would be:

Therefore the magnetic body force components acting on the solvent are in the angular (circumferential) and radial directions only.

2.3 Dimensional Analysis
Dimensional analysis is a method of simplifying complex equations by reducing the amount of variables being used in a compact way by putting them in a dimensionless form in order to observe the physical effect of the phenomena. Some examples of these dimensionless parameters are the Reynolds number, Prandtl number and the Grashof number [40].

2.3.1 Non-Dimensional Variables
In order to achieve a better convergence, the differential equations will be transformed to a non-dimensional form. These are all the non-dimensionalized variables, which will be used to non-dimensionalize the equations.

2.4 The Growth Technique
Growth has been performed in the Traveling Solvent Method (TSM). In the TSM method there are three specific parts in a quartz tube; the source or the feed rod at top, melt or solution zone in the middle of the crystal (solvent) and substrate (the seed rod) which lies at tlie bottom of the ampoule [19]. The feed rod is usually made of a polycrystalline material with relatively constant composition. The whole sample would be placed in a furnace and the solution zone would be heated by heating elements. Figure 8 illustrates a TSM system consisting of a furnace with a cylindrical enclosure and the ampoule (quartz tube) containing the liquid-solid materials which is obtained from the experimental set up at Dalhousie University. During the growth, because of the characteristics of the temperature profile, (higher temperature at solution zone and lower at source and substrate) two liquid-solid interfaces are created and this causes the soiurce materials to dissolve into the solvent. The transportation then takes place by both thermosolutal and diffusion. By downward movement of the ampoule, more materials would dissolve in the solution and at the same time crystallization would take place according to the lower temperature and large temperature gradient at the growth interface [24]. The amp-^ule (quartz tube) is then translated downwards the axis of the furnace.

usually at a rate of around 4 mm/day, which means it usually takes 1 to 2 weeks to grow a single crystal. Figure 9 describes the stages of the TSM toward the crystal growth. The traveling solvent method is a relatively new and promising technique for the production of high quality bulk crystal of semiconductors. For the TSM method by applying a magnetic field, it is possible to control the buoyancy driven convective flow and the uniformity of concentration distiibution at the growth interface, as well as to achieve the growth interface as flat as possible and a relatively faster gi-owth rate. All these objectives can be obtained by optimizing the mass transport throughout the system [2]. The application of the applied magnetic field goes into this category.

2.5 Model Description
The sample having a length of 6.1cm consists of a Geo.ssSio.is feed rod having a diameter of 0.8 cm and length of 3.6 cm (the source rod). This rod is located on top of a Geo.98 Sio.o2 rod having the same diameter and the length of 1.0 cm (i.e. solvent). At the bottom is the germanium seed with the length of 1.5 cm (the substrate). The total sample is enclosed in a quartz tube having a wall thickness of 0.1 cm. The heater is applied at the external surface of the quartz tube. The temperature profile was obtained from the experimentally set up thermo-couple [46], which is located at the inner wall of the ampoule. This temperature profile is depicted in Figure 10. The temperature is assumed to be uniform along the circumferential direction. The melting temperature of the solvent is less than the Geo.s5 Sio.15 rod. Therefore Si will be segregating from the source rod toward the bottom rod. In this model a uniform, axial static magnetic field is applied, which is perfectly aligned will: the axis of the furnace. Because the magnetic Reynolds number is much smaller than unity (R e,,i« l), the effects of the induced magnetic field on the applied field are negligible. Thus, the induced magnetic field by the fluid motion is not considered in the equation and only the external magnetic field is taken into account for the crystal growth.

2.7 Numerical Solution Teclinique
The formulation of the crystallization for the TSM growth of GeSi was given in the previous section. In the solution zone the non-linear Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation which is coupled by the convective heat and mass transfer as well as the magnetic body force are applied. As mentioned above, on the boundaries a non-shp condition for velocity is assumed and the steady- state condition has been considered. The experimental temperature field is used to calculate the temperature field in the sample. Here are other assumptions that have been taken into account in the input file used for the simulation; · · The fluid is Newtonian Thermophysical properties are constant everywhere except for the density · · The solution in electrically conductive The flow is laminar

2.7.1 Finite Element Analysis
The Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used to solve the governing equations. The finite element method is an efficient technique for simulation of the crystal growth and it is vahd for all types of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. The objective of the finite element method is to reduce the infinite number of degrees of freedom in a problem to a finite number by a system of algebraic equations. The domain, which is to be analyzed, is divided into small regions. These regions are called elements. These elements are defined with a finite number of nodes where the field variables, e.g. temperature, velocity, pressure, and concentration are to be evaluated. An algebraic combination of local nodal values is used to approximate the solution in each element. The approximate functions of this element are then integrated over the domain and their overall error is minimized throughout the mesh. This process gives rise to a set of N algebraic equations for the N unknown nodal values. Using matrix inversion or iteration, the nodal equations are then solved simultaneously [42]. The advantages of using the Finite Element Method is that it includes the ability to easily model irregularly shaped bodies and without difficulty handle a wide range of loading conditions. FEM makes it easy to model bodies composed of several different materials as the elemental equations are evaluated individually. It also can be used to handle unlimited numbers and different kinds of boundary conditions [42].

In this model, the Galerkin finite element method approximation has been used for velocity, pressure, temperature, and concentration. This was done in order to reduce the partial differential equations and boundary conditions to a set of algebraic equations. Then, the segregated algorithm is used to solve these algebraic equations [43]. In order to model the geometry of the sample and generate the elements and the associated nodes, tire commercial software, GAMBIT was used [44]. GAMBIT has a very impressive library containing an extensive selection of elements including a three-dimensional 27 node hexahedron element. After the griding of the sample is done by GAMBIT, the geometry and the mesh are exported to the commercial computational code FIDAP [43]. FIDAP is the general-purpose computer software that is used to numerically model the crystal growth of Geo.9 sSio.o2 by the traveling solvent method. FIDAP is a computational fluid dynamics package that uses the finite element method to simulate many classes of fluid flow. In each element, the partial differential equations of fluid mechanics covering the flow regions are replaced by algebraic equations. FIDAP then solves these equations by using complicated numerical techniques to determine the velocities, pressures, temperatures, species concentrations and other unknowns throughout the region at given time intervals [43]. For the presented model, eight-node hexahedron elements have been chosen. The finite element mesh for the growth is shown in Figure 12. A refined mesh has been used within the solvent due to the large temperature and velocity gradient in the interfaces. The mesh configuration for the substrate and the

source was used to obtain the temperature field within the substrate and the source (solid zones) because as it was mentioned in section 2.1.2, the only governing equation for the solid zone is the equation of energy. The configuration of the grids in the solvent is demonstrated in the Figure 12b. The temperature profile was obtained from the experimental thermo-couples, which are located at the inner wall of the ampoule. In order to simplify the computation, the crucible wall is not considered in the model. As mentioned before the segregated algorithm has been chosen for the model to solve the algebraic equations. The equations are solved simultaneously and the criteria for the convergence set for the five unknowns, temperature, u, v, and w as well as the concentration. Convergence is reached when the non-dimensional primitive variables attain a difference (between two consecutive iterations) less than 10"^.

2.7.2 Sensitivity Analysis
In order to obtain tire most accurate results and at the same time the least computational storage, an optimum number of grids should be determined. For this purpose different mesh intensities are taken into consideration and an ideal mesh is selected according to an average Nusselt number across the solvent. It is found that the parameter which is the main driving force in the simulation should be used for the sensitivity analysis. In this case the problem involves heat transfer and the temperature heater profile applied to the outside of the sample, therefore the average Nusselt number across the solvent is a viable parameter to be used for mesh sensitivity: dz

where 6 is the non-dimensional temperature and I is the length of the solvent. A mesh is deemed acceptable when the value of the average Nusselt number changes by 10'^ from that mesh to a more coarse mesh. Initially, the number of nodes on the circumferential direction was kept constant at 20 nodes and the number of nodes in the axial direction was increased. This is then followed by increasing the circumferential nodes to 40, 60 and 80 nodes. The results show that there is a slight difference in the result between 40, 60 and 80 nodes (see Table 1 or Figure 13). 60 nodes in the circumferential direction are chosen to minimize the computational storage and to maximize accuracy. Table 1 (or Figure 13) shows the average Nusselt number versus the axial number of nodes. It is clear that the optimum mesh is 60 by 240 nodes in the circumferential and

the axial direction, respectively, which means 79200 (87723 nodes) eight-node hexahedron elements in the whole sample are used and they are expanded as 21780 elements (24187 nodes) in the source, 33000 elements (36461 nodes) in the solvent and 24420 elements (27075 nodes) in the substrate.

Three different cases were examined for a better understanding of the fluid flow, heat and mass transfer during the TSM process of Geo.9 sSio.02 using the values for the properties presented in Table 2[45] which is presented in Appendix D. Firstly, the effect of buoyancy convection was studied where the gravity vector g was present and equal to go. Secondly, the fluid, heat and mass transfer of GeSi solvent in a low gravity condition with the gravity vector g set equal to 10'`' ^go (microgravity) is examined. Finally, the importance of the magnetic field to suppress convection in the presence of a buoyancy force is studied in detail. Since the goal is to achieve a uniform distribution of silicon on the seed and because the quality of the growth process is strongly affected by the fluid flow intensity, the silicon distribution is examined at four different locations. In particular, the results were examined at cross sections at < P=0° and < P=90°, in the vertical plane of the solvent region (r, Ç =0, z), near the growth interface (r, f , z=1.575cm) and at the middle of the solvent region (r, 9 , z=2.0cm).

interface. This is the characteristic required for the traveling solvent method. The intention is not to melt the source interface but to try to diffuse the silicon into the solvent region. The temperature gradient near the growth interface is about I70°C/cm and the maximum temperature in the solvent is 1004.6 °C. With such a temperature profile one may expect a convective pattern with hot molten particles rising to the source rod near the quartz wall and the cold molten particles coming down from the centre of tire solvent region. Figure 14 and Figure 15 present the temperature distribution for terrestrial and microgravity conditions, respectively. Figures 14b and 15b show the

temperature distribution (isotherms) in the solution zone in the vertical plane (r, (5 =0°, z). It can be seen that the curvature of isotherms varies from convex to concave, indicating the variation of the radial temperature gradients. However, the variation is small because the heat transfer process in semiconductor materials is dominantly conduction rather than convection [22]. As shown in Figures 14 and 15, the same behaviour of the temperature gradient is observed in both conditions. This shows that the convection in the solvent is not strong enough to deform temperature contours in the solvent. This observation is reasonable due to the fact that the material used in our simulation is GeSi, which is in the family of semiconductor materials and has a relatively low Prandtl number. For such materials, convection is not strong enough to have any effect on the temperature distribution within the solvent. Therefore one can conclude that there is the same temperature gradient for the terrestrial and microgravity cases.

The application of the temperature profile in the solution zone results in two counter-rotating flow ceUs. They force the flow to move upward along the crucible wall where the temperature is the highest and then push it downward along the central axis where the temperatm-e is lower. Figure 16 shows the

As shown in this figure, two buoyant convective cells are created and these two cells drive convective transport which produces non-uniformities in the concentration distribution in both the melt and the crystal.

downward from the silicon rich concentration near the dissolution interface, towards the growth interface from the centre axis of the sample. In microgravity (Figure 18), due to the weak buoyancy convection, one observes a unoform distribution of silicon and the process is purely diffusive. A cut in the horizontal direction either in the middle of the sample or near the growth interface (Figures 18b and c) shows a uniform silicon distribution in the solvent region in microgravity and a non-linear distribution in the terrestrial case due to the influence of the buoyancy convection. If one examines the solute distribution along the radial direction in the two conditions near the interface, one may observe that in a microgravity condition, better silicon distribution does exist but still a very small non-uniformity is obtained. This is due to the residual gravity (Figure 18e), which remains in the model since one can never achieve a perfect, zero gravity. Two boundary layers are formed at the vicinity of the dissolution interface and growth interface. As mentioned before, for the case where the gravity is present, there is a relatively high concentration gradient along the wall of the crucible and at tire centre axis of the sample, which is caused by the convective flow in the cell. Figure 17e shows the variation of the concentration distribution along the radial direction, and it shows a significant radial gradient in the solvent. For the microgravity condition, because of low gravity this convective flow is reduced and the flow is mostly conductive rather than convective.

Figures 19 and 20 show the flow field (speed contours) in terrestrial and ndcrogravity conditions, respectively. The flow is nearly axisymmetiic and also homocentric for both cases. A relatively strong flow cell is created in the middle of the solvent region near the centre axis and two weaker cells near the wall of the crucible for both cases. In the presence of the gravity (see Figure 19) the maximum speed cell has a magnitude of 0.4796 cm/s while for the microgravity condition, the same behaviour is observed but with less intensity. The maximum speed obtained for this case is 0.000168 cm/s, being much less than the previous case, is located almost in the middle of the growth cell. This indicates the existence of a weak gravity force pushing the flow downward.

3.3 The Effect of Applied Magnetic Field in Terrestrial Condition
In this thesis, an externally unifonn, steady, axial magnetic field is applied. The purpose of tlie applied static axial magnetic field is that it acts as a body force, working in the opposite direction to the induced buoyancy convection in the solution zone. The application of the magnetic field is that, it prevents the sinking behaviour of the heavy particles in the melt from the centre axis of the solvent and results in less central segregation and consequently less radial concentration gradients. Different magnetic field intensities were studied. Simulation is presented for eight different levels of magnetic field. Figures 21 to 28 present the silicon distribution in the solution zone for different levels of magnetic field intensities (B-0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.2 KG) at cross section at ip=0° and <p=90° (Figures 21a to 38a), in the horizontal plane in the middle of the growth cell (figures 21b to 28b), as well as the variation of the silicon concentration along the ?  - direction in the middle of the solvent (Figures 21c to 28 c), in the horizontal plane near the growth interface (Figures 21d to 28d), and in the vertical plane at the central axis of the growth cell (Figures 21d to 28d). Simulation results show the same behaviour for the temperature distribution as was shown for terrestrial and microgravity condition. This means that for the same reason as mentioned for the terrestiial and microgravity case, the effects of convective heat transfer on the temperature distribution and on the tliermallydriven buoyant convection are negligible [46].

When the magnetic field intensity is set equal to 0.2 kilogauss (KG), the silicon distribution tends to be more axisymmetiic and the silicon contours are spread more uniformly than for the case with no magnetic field. When compared with the case with no magnetic field, a more uniform concentration distribution can be observed and it becomes more evident as the magnetic field intensity is increased. When the magnetic field intensities increase, the sihcon distribution becomes smoother and the sihcon contours become flatter and more uniform. This represents a more uniform growth. Figures 21e to 28e depict the concentration distribution in the vertical plane (r, (p=(f, z)- By increasing the magnetic field intensity, the radial concentration gi-adients decrease and the sihcon contours tend to present hnear behavior. As shown in Figures 27e or Figure 28e, the sihcon contours are parallel and, especially near the growth interface, they are neai'ly flat, which is the desired condition for the growth interface. As is obseiwed in Figures 21a to 25a, sihcon distribution does not behave tire same in the ç=0° and the <p=90° planes, which means that, although the distribution is axisymmetfic in one plane, it is different from plane to plane. Therefore the behaviour is changing according to the plane of view. This is because of the characteristic of the axial magnetic field intensity which results in two magnetic force components: one in the radial direction and one in the circumferential direction (see section 2.3 for more details). Despite the fact that the magnetic body force is in the opposite direction of the flow and it decreases the flow intensity, these two resulting components of magnetic force (radial and

circumferential components) cause non-uniformities in the radial direction in the growth and the axisymmetiic flow pattern is also distorted. By applying larger magnetic field intensities such as 1.5, 2.0, or 2.2 KG the convective flow would he dominantly suppressed and this asymmetric behaviour disappears. By examining the silicon distribution at the horizontal plane near the growth interface (Figures 21d to 28d) the contours are showing that they tend to become more homocentric as the magnetic field intensity is increased. Figure 28d shows a complete homocentric silicon distribution near the growth interface. This is desirable for the crystal growth. The intensity of maximum concentration distribution near the growth interface takes place in the middle of the region (in the horizontal plane), which is slightly reduced by increasing the magnetic field intensity. The maximum silicon concentration in the horizontal plane near the gr'owth interface is 9.99 percent for the magnetic field intensity equal to 0.2 KG while this maximum reduces to 7.48 percent when the magnetic field is increased to 0.6 KG (Figure 22c), 6.5 percent for 1.5 KG (Figure 23c) and 5.87 percent for 2.0 KG. This is reasonable due to the effect of the magnetic field in suppressing the flow field. Transport of the silicon from the dissolution interface to the growth interface is reduced accordingly. This would be continued until the magnetic field intensity reaches 2.2 KG. The maximum concentration then drops to 5.55 percent when the magnetic field intensity of 2.2 KG is applied. Compared to the case with magnetic field intensity of 2.0 KG, as is depicted in the figure, the concentration distribution doesn't change significantly, but it is homocentric.

Figures 21b to 28b show the concentration distribution in the horizontal plane in the middle of the solvent. This shows that the silicon particles are concentrated dominantly close to the centre axis of the sample in the absence of the magnetic field or small magnetic field intensity. The figures that were mentioned above show that by increasing the magnetic field intensity the silicon concentration contours are more spread out and occupy more space than the cases with no magnetic field or small magnetic field intensity, with more homocentric behaviour, which is desirable for crystal growth. Figure 28b shows complete homocentric behaviour with the magnetic field intensity equal to 2.2 KG. Figures 21c to 28c show the variation of the silicon concentration along the rdirection in the middle of the solvent. For low magnetic field intensities, a very large silicon distribution gradient is observed. By increasing the magnetic field intensity the behaviour tends to show linear behaviour. In Figure 27c or Figure 28c, the distribution is nearly linear and axisymmetric. The difference between the maximum and the minimum concentration percentage is much less than that of the weak magnetic field or the absence of magnetic field.

Figures 29 to 36 summarize the flow patterns in the solvent region for eight different levels of axial magnetic field intensities (J5=0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.2 KG) at cross section at cp-0° and cp=90° (Figures 29a to 36a), along the radial direction in the middle of the growth cell (Figures 29b to 36b), the variation of the speed along the radial direction in the middle of the growth cell (Figures 29c to 36c), at the horizontal plane near the growth interface (Figures 29d to 36d), and in the vertical plane at the center of tire growth cell (Figures 29e to 36e). It was found that the two counter-rotating velocity vectors (see Figure 16) in the solvent translated into three speed cells as shown ' n Figure 29: one relatively strong located in the r u,.,dle of the growth ceU (in vertical plane) and two weaker cells near the ampoule wall in the case willi weak magnetic field intensities (see Figure 29e). The maximum speed cell is located closer to the growth interface rather than near tire dissolution interface. This is because of the influence of the gravity pushing the flow downward towards the growth interface. This means that the gravity is not significantly suppressed with this field intensity. The magnitude of tire maximum speed in the case with magnetic intensity of 0.2 KG was fourrd to be equal to 0.19635 cirr/s, which is less than that of the case with no magnetic field and, the other two cells close to the wall have less intensity than the middle cell (Figure 29e). Wlren B is increased to a level of 0.4 KG, the maximum speed in the middle cell has the same value as the two cells close to tire crucible wall. All three cells have the maximrmr speed value of 0.05934 cm/s (Figure 30e), When B reaches a level of 0.6 KG (Figure 3le), the strong cell in the middle becomes weaker but

the flow intensity of tlie two cells close to the wall does not drop as significantly as tire middle cell does; therefore, the behavior of the flow changes along the radial direction. The magnitude of the maximum speed for the two cells close to the wall becomes higher than the cell located in the middle. Also the two cells close to the wall are squeezed and shifted to the crucible wall. These two relatively strong cells create a layer along the crucible wall which is called the Hartmann layer. As B is increased beyond 0.6 KG, the Hartmann layer becomes thinner and is squeezed further. This phenomenon confirms tlie observations of references [11] and [16]. Tins behavior creates mostly a wealc flow intensity in the middle of the solution zone and relatively strong flow field close to the crucible wall, which is desired and it leads to a better control of the crystal growth process, as well as creates a stable and flat growth interface. Figure 36e, shows that the cells are still closer to the growth interface rather than the dissolution interface which shows tliat the shght effect of the gravity in the fluid flow still exists. Figures 29c to 36c confirm the above statements. In comparing Figure 29c with 36c, three peaks are shown in the variation of the speed along the radial direction. The maximum peak is located in the middle of the region near the centre axis of the crucible in the case with intensity of 0.2 KG while for the magnetic intensity of 2.2 KG the maximum peak is located very close to the wall rather than the centre axis. The flow field in the horizontal plane in the middle of the gi'owth cell shows that by increasing the magnetic field intensity the core cell in the middle is

suppressed and two stronger cells are moving towards the wall. The same behavior can be observed at the growth interface (Figures 29d to 36d). As depicted in Figures 29a to 36a, the flow field does not present the same pattern in the (r, (p=0°, z) plane and (r, (p=90°, z) plane, which means that although the distribution is axisymmetric in one plane, it is different from plane to plane. Therefore the behaviour is changing accordingly with the plane of view. This is because of the same reason that explained in section 3.3.

The variation of the fluid intensities along the radial direction near the growth interface for different levels of axial magnetic field as weU as microgravity and terrestrial conditions with no magnetic field are depicted in Figure 37. In the absence of magnetic field two peaks can he observed. By increasing the magnetic field intensities these peaks become flatter and the flow intensity gradient along radial direction is reduced. The flow is stronger in the middle of the growth cell in the absence of the magnetic field or, weak magnetic field intensities. By increasing the applied magnetic field this strong flow in the middle becomes wealcer and the flow becomes more uniform which is desirable for the crystal growth. One may conclude that the optimum magnetic field intensity is near B=2.2 KG where, a uniform flow intensity is observed, except for the area very close to the crucible waU.

Figure 37 shows a very small difference between the behaviours of tlie fluid flow for the case with the intensity of 2.2 KG and microgravity condition which is located near the crucible wall. The variation of the fluid intensities along radial direction in the middle of the growth cell for the different levels of magnetic field as well as for the case in the absence of magnetic field and the microgravity condition is summarized in Figure 38. As mentioned eaiher, for the case without magnetic field or for a weak magnetic intensity (i.e. 0.2 KG), the flow has two peaks of maximum speed. The strongest peak is located in the middle of the region. As the magnetic intensity increases, the flow is reduced in the middle region at a faster rate compared to near the wall. This explains the earlier observation that with

the increase in magnetic field, the flow becomes weak in the middle hut remains relatively strong near the quartz wall. For strong apphed magnetic field intensities, a slight change of fluid flow can be seen only near the wall since it is the desired environment to grow the crystal. Figure 38 shows a very small difference between the behavior of the fluid flow for the case with the intensity of 2.2 KG and microgravity condition which is located very close to the crucible wall. Therefore one can conclude that the intensity of 2.2 KG is optimum for the crystal growth in terrestrial environment. Silicon distribution along the radial direction in the middle of the solvent for different applied magnetic field intensities (r, q>=0°, z-- 2.0 cm) as well as the terrestrial and microgravity conditions are depicted in Figure 39. For weak magnetic field intensity (i.e. 0.2 KG), a very large concentration gradient is observed. By applying larger magnetic field intensity, the gradient decreases and the difference between the maximum and the minimum concentration percentage drops. The ideal condition to grow crystal is microgravity where diffusion is the only transport of silicon to the growth interface.

Three humps are observed; one at the centre axis of the sample and two closer to the crucible wall where the maximum concentration gradients are located. As B increases, these humps become flatter and the growth is faced with a nearly linear" concentration distribution and consequently, flat interface.

This figure confirms that the best growth is in the microgravity condition. The gradient of silicon distribution is decreased by increasing the applied magnetic field. Also, the silicon concentration percentage is reduced by applying the magnetic field, which is the consequence of suppressing the convection. As is shown in Figure 41, the radial distributions of the silicon particles tend to exhibit horizontal behaviour by increasing the magnetic field intensity and having a uniform silicon concentration. The microgravity case shows a nearly complete flat interface.

The variation of the maximum flow intensity with respect to the nondimensional magnetic field intensity, the Hartmann number, is summarized in Figure 42. The variation is given in the logarithmic pattern in order to find the relationship between the maximum velocity and the Hartmann number. It was found that the maximum velocity obeys a power law with respect to Hartmann number: = = . The observation of the logarithmic behaviour with

respect to Hartmann number confirms the observation of refs [2] and [18], with different slopes.

By observing Figure 42, one may conclude that the best result would be obtained by increasing the magnetic field intensities as much as possible. It should be mentioned that although the magnetic body force suppresses the gravitational body force, when the level of the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, where the magnetic body force balances the gravitational body force completely, the two magnetic force components become extra forces acting on the crystal growth and cause non-uniformities in the solvent region and the growtli interface. Therefore, the magnetic field must be optimized.

CHAPTER 4 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1 Conclusions
A three-dimensional numerical simulation of the fluid flow, heat and mass transfer within a Geo.9 sSio.02 solvent under an axial magnetic field was carried out. The full steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as well as the continuity, energy and the mass transport equations, were solved numerically using the finite element technique. It was found that in the earth environment, there is a strong convective flow, which is undesirable for the growth uniformity in the crystal. An external axial magnetic field was applied to suppress this convection. Results revealed that with the increase in the intensity of the magnetic field, the silicon distribution in the horizontal plane became more homocentric and the distribution of the silicon became wider in the vertical plane. The intensity of the flow at the centre of the cimcible decreases at a faster rate compared to the flow near" the walls. This phenomenon creates a stable and flat growth interface. It was also found that the maximum velocity obeys a power law with respect to Hartmann number ^ in the stable region. One

can conclude that in the absence of a magnetic field in earth gravity condition, the migration of the silicon is mostly due to convective flow. In the presence of the magnetic field, the convective flow is suppressed and the diffusion plays an

important role in the silicon distribution in the solvent. Also, microgravity condition (10 "^g) was numerically simulated for reducing the buoyancy convection in the solvent. A reductic n in gravity represented a reduction in the driving body force in natural convection and a uniform concentration distribution would be obtained.

4.2 Future W ork
The ideal results for crystal growth were obtained in the microgravity environment where the growth took place in a pure diffusion environment. It should be mentioned that even the attainable space environment does not provide zero gravity. Therefore, the best results can be obtained from combining of microgravity and a magnetic field, wherein the microgravity would reduce the slow, steady convective flows to a minimum with the magnetic field damping any residuals [8]. However, while located on the space station, one might encounter some unexpected disturbances from astronauts and from running equipment which is called G- jitter. It is for tins reason that the extension of tins work will be to examine how G-Jitter may create some convection. And the final goal would be to apply a magnetic field to suppress this unwanted convection due to G-jitter in microgravity. This could be the long-temi objective for this project. In addition, for the simulation presented in this thesis, the temperature profile is considered uniformly distributed around the sample since a small nonuniformity exists according to the geometry of the heating elements; future

work could be to consider these non-uniformities. Finally, applying a rotating magnetic field could be the best way of suppressing the convective fluid flow in the growth for the terrestrial condition with less curvature in the growth interface.

APPENDIX A MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS EQUATIONS
The MHD equations are obtained from Maxwell's equations coupled with the Navier- Stokes equations. Maxwell's equations can be written as: VxH=J VxE =-B V g =0 and (A.4) where E is electric field, J is the current density; H is the magnetic field and /.lo is the permeability. The current density is given from the extended Ohm's law: J ^o(E + V xB ) (A.5) / \ ' I' , , (A.1) (A.2) (A.3)

where c is the electrical conductivity of the fluid (assumed isotropic) and V is the vector flow velocity. From equation (A.l) and (A.5) we J can be eliminated: V x H = o { E + V x B) and from equation (A.4) we H can be eliminated: -- Therefore from equation (A.6) and (A.7): (A.7) (A.6)

V x -- = <y{E+VxB) and (VxB)=(cFjuXE+VxB) By applying V x to both side of the equation above:
V x(Vxg)=(p;uJV x(E+Vxg)

(A.S)

(A.9)

(A.10)

and
((?/.)" '(V X (V X g ) ) = V X E + V X ( y X g ) (A.11)

Substituting equation (A.2) into the equation above, the equation for the magnetic induction will be obtained:

g = V x(yxg)-(/f.o-)-'V x(V xg).

(A.12)

which indicates the temporal variation of the B. The first term indicates the convection of the flow and the second term indicates the diffusion. The ratio of the first to the second term is of order of magnitude:
Re,n=^o OU oD

(A. 13)

which is a non-dimensional ratio which is called the magnetic Reynolds number, and D are a characteristic (reference) flow velocity and a

characteristic length, respectively. For large flow velocities, and consequently, large magnetic Reynolds number, tire second term on the right hand side of equation (A.12) (The magnetic dissipation term) can be neglected. When Re,n is very small, the first term is

small and therefore the flow would not distort the magnetic field lines. The essential incorporation of the magnetic field in the Navier-Stokes equation is the incorporation of the Lorentz force. In small magnetic Reynolds number flows, {Re,n small compared to unity), simplification of the Navier-Stokes equation is possible [8]. One can apply the externally imposed field, for all kinds of crystal growth. Therefore, we can replace B by Bg, the externally imposed field. By inserting the equation (A.5) into tlie Lorentz force equation: L =o{E+ ^xBJxB^ (A. 14)

Consequently dB/dt=0. Therefore, from equation (A.2) E can be simplified asE = -V (j) . And: L = o (-V (Z H -y x g J x B . (A.15)

The components of the Lorentz force would then represent the components of the magnetic force in the Navier-Stokes equation, which was presented in Equations (2.1) to (2.3). Usually, the electric field due to the applied magnetic field and the motion of the fluid flow is neglected for axisymmetric flow patterns [8]. Therefore the magnetic field forces are written as follows: --\vB^ -VuB^B^ = o-(wBj53 - uBl - uBl + vB^B^ ) (A.16) (A. 17)
