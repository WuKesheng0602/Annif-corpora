THERMAL ANALYSIS OF A DOUBLE GLAZED WINDOW WITH A BETWEEN-PANES PLEATED BLIND Rasesh Dalai Master o f Engineering, 2004 Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2004

ABSTRACT A simplified two-dimensional numerical model o f a window with a betweenpanes pleated blind has been developed using commercial computational fluid dynamics software. Knowledge o f the effect of blinds on the fi-ee convection is important for understanding and predicting the impact of shading devices on the overall thermal performance of a window. Numerical results have been obtained for three fill gases (air, argon and krypton) and several blind geometries over the Rayleigh number range 10^<Ra<10^. The results show that pleated blinds can have a strong effect on window thermal performance. In addition, it has been shown that the data fi'om a convection-only model can be combined with a simplified one-dimensional model to estimate the overall U-value of the enclosure. Using this procedure, the convection data can be applied to a window/blind assembly with arbitrary radiation parameters.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW

1.1

Introduction Fenestration systems are primarily selected for the comfort o f occupants and from

an aesthetic point of view. However, windows can contribute a significant portion of the energy savings in buildings. For this reason, windows have been a source o f particular concern to energy researchers. As a result, many designers have explored ways of minimizing the thermal losses through windows, while preserving their lighting and psychological benefits. Among the techniques suggested for improving window performance, the use of shading devices, both internal and external, can be mentioned. Radiant or solar heat gain through windows and glass doors can increase air conditioning costs and reduce occupant comfort. The more glass a home has, especially on east, west, and south exposures, the more important it is to have some type of window shading device. For this reason, particular interest has been directed toward improving the thermal performance of windows. Therefore, in order to effectively use shading devices to minimize window heat transfe 'ates, a proper understanding how these devices interact with the window's heat transfer is required.

There are several products available on the market for shading windows. The most common devices include curtains, Venetian blinds, vertical blinds and roller blinds. There is significant interest in placing a blind between the panes of a double glazed window because of several advantages. Some of these advantages are; (i) The blind is protected from damage (such as by children, pets, etc.).

(ii) The blind does not collect dust as quickly. (iii) It can prevent the blind from interfering with the opening and closing o f the window. Figure 1.1(a) shows a commercial pleated blind. In terms of the history o f blinds, pleated blinds are relatively newcomers. Pleated blinds were bom out o f the standard Venetian blind, with folded fabric in place of the horizontal slats. PellaTM (one o f the world's leading manufacturers for doors and windows) has recently introduced a new product, which has a pleated blind between the panes of double glazed window. These products appear to be designed based more on aesthetic appeal and occupant comfort than on thermal performance. Figure 1.1(b) shows a close-up view of a pleated blind between the panes of double glazed window. This product is manufactured by PellaTM and it is currently available on the market. The present numerical study examines the interaction o f a pleated blind with the free convection heat transfer between the panes of window. A window system is an example of multimode heat transfer, which is the subject of this project. When a pleated blind is placed inside a window glazing, three modes of heat transfer will occur; convection, conduction and radiation. Free convection occurs in the fill gas between the glazings and is driven by the outdoor/indoor temperature difference. Conduction occurs in the solid components, which includes the glazings, end spacers, and the blind. Radiation heat transfer occurs between the hot glazing and the blind, and between the cold glazing and the blind. This heat exchange occurs across the fill gas, which is normally considered transparent to thermal radiation. In the current application, all three modes of heat transfer are coupled.

Soaring international fiiel prices have caused increased interest in energy efficiency. Hie environmental impact o f energy usage has also created interest in improved energy efficiency. As each new window design comes onto the market, performance evaluation is needed. Comercial software such as VISION (Wright, 1992) and WINDOW (Finlayson et al., 1993) are widely used by North American manufacturers to determine energy rating (ER) numbers for their products. VISION and WINDOW calculate the center-glass U-Value using a simplified one-dimensional analysis. These software packages use empirical correlations for the convective heat transfer coefficients and calculate the radiation exchange using a graydiffuse model. However, both VISION and WINDOW are restricted to the analysis of windows with no shading devices attached. Shading devices are a vital part of a window fenestration system. In the present study, the thermal performance o f a window with an inter-pane pleated blind is calculated using the CFD software FLUENT 6.0 (Fluent Inc., 1998).

1.2

Literature Review As the name implies, inter-pane pleated blinds are located inside the window

cavity. As previously mentioned, there is a free convective flow in this cavity. There has been a considerable amount of research on free convection in complex enclosures, because there are many engineering applications. Two main areas have been reviewed that relate to this project: (i) Studies of natural convection in tall rectangular cavities, and (ii) Studies of the effects of blinds on window thermal performance.

1.2.1

Natural Convection in Tall Rectangular Cavities Natural convection flow and heat transfer in an air-filled vertical cavity (narrow

slot) with a temperature difference maintained between the vertical walls has been under study over the past several decades (e.g., Ostrach, 1952). Such natural convection is found in many applications, such as building insulation, double-pane windows, solar collectors, and cavities surrounding the core of nuclear reactors. Of all cavity problems, the vertical rectangular cavity is probably the most studied configuration, because of its relative simplicity and importance in many practical applications. Figure 1.2 shows a cross section o f a vertical slot, which is presumed to be long in Z-direction. The temperatures o f the heated wall, T h, and cooled wall, Tc, are assumed to be uniform. Typically, the boundary conditions on the upper and lower end walls are either: (i) zero heat flux (ZHF) or (ii) linear temperature profile (LTP). Fundamental studies and dimensional analysis have shown that the convective heat flux from the hot wall to the cold wall, q, (either local or average) can be expressed in a dimensionless form as the Nusselt number Nu=T(Ra, Pr, A). For the window application, the Rayleigh number (Ra), enclosure aspect ratio (A) and Prandtl number (Pr) are given by:

In a rectangular cavity, the temperature difference between the vertical walls drives the convective flow. Figure 1.3 shows the variation of average Nusselt number with Rayleigh number for various values of aspect ratio (A). In Figure 1.3 the aspect ratio corresponds to tall cavities with A>40. For all aspect ratios, at low Rayleigh numbers, the Nusselt number equals one. At NuAvg=l, the total amount of convective heat transfer is equal to the amount that would exist if the gas were stagnant and transferring energy purely by conduction. This is called the conduction regime. However, the NuAvg=l condition must not be interpreted as a zero-flow condition. At higher values o f Ra the amount of convective flow is greater and Nu increases. The average Nusselt number for tall vertical enclosures can be found in many experimental and numerical studies in the literature (e.g., Elsherbiny et al., 1983; Lee and Korpela, 1983; Wright and Sullivan, 1994). As shown in Figure 1.4, the critical value of Ra at which the Nusselt number leaves the conduction regime is a function o f aspect ratio, A. The convective flow leaves the conduction regime at lower values o f Ra for cavities with lower values of A. If the Ra increases sufficiently, instabilities occur that eventually leads to a turbulent boundary layer flow. The critical value of Ra for the onset of turbulent flow is a function of A. The flow in enclosures with larger aspect ratio becomes turbulent at smaller values of Ra.

At low Rayleigh number, the flow in the cavity is unicellular. When the Rayleigh number reaches a critical value, a steady multicellular flow arises. It was predicted by theoretical analyses (e.g. Vest and Arpaci, 1969; Bergholz, 1978), numerical simulation (e.g. Korpela et al., 1982, 1983), and verified by experiments (e.g. Vest and Arpaci, 1969). The critical value of Rayleigh number Rac is given by results of stability analysis (Bergholz, 1978): Rac=GrcPr where Grc is a critical Grashof number and it is defined as: Gr,= 8 x l 0 ' ( 1 + -- ) A (1.6) (1.5)

In the current study, many o f the calculations are done for A=20. For A=20, the value of Grc is lO t Taking Pr=0.7 (air, argon, krypton), the corresponding Rac is 7,000. The data o f ElSherbiny et al. (1983) showed that the aspect ratio strongly influenced the heat transfer for low aspect ratio. This data was used to obtain a design correlation. This correlation was developed on the basis of the two sets o f Nu/Ra data available for high aspect ratio cavities. The first set was measured by ElSherbiny et al. (1980) and second set was measured by Shewen (1986). Later, Wright (1996) used these data to obtain the following improved correlation: NuAvg= 0.0673838Ra'^ NuAvg= 0.028154 Ra " Ra> 5 x 10^ 10'`< Ra <5 x 1O '* (1.7) (1.8) (1.9)

1.2.2 Studies of the Effect of Blinds on Window Thermal Performance Several previous experimental and numerical studies have examined the effect o f Venetian-type blinds on window thermal performance. A Venetian blind is a shading device that consists of many horizontal louvers, which can be rotated around a horizontal axis. Some studies have considered the effect o f a Venetian blind located adjacent to the indoor glazing surface. Others have considered the effect o f an inter-pane Venetian blind. A brief review o f the literature in this area will be presented in this section. Machin et al. (1997) has performed an experimental study on the effect o f louvers adjacent to an isothermal flat surface, which approximated a window glazing. Local convection coefficients were obtained using laser interferometry at three different blind spacings and four different blind angles. Except at very close spacing, the effect o f the blind on the average convective heat transfer rate was foimd to be less than 13%, compared to an isolated flat plate. Phillips (1998) has obtained a numerical solution for the effects o f blinds on the convective and radiative heat transfer rates from an isothermal window glazing surface for three different blind angles and spacings. In this study, Phillips reported that the presence o f the louvered blind results in periodic variation in the local convective and radiative heat transfer rate. In this study, Phillips (1998) reported that the blind provides shielding that reduces the radiative heat transfer rates from the window by up to 38% compared to an unshaded window. Garnet et al. (1999) has measured the center-glass U-Value of a window with an inter-pane Venetian blind for several different blind louver angles. These experimental measurements were made using a guarded heater plate apparatus. Garnet (2000) also

developed a fmite-volume CFD model o f his experiment. However, convergence problems occurred and only a limited set o f results were obtained. Shahid (2001) did a numerical study on convective heat transfer rate from an isothermal vertical surface adjacent to a set o f horizontal louvers using the finite element code FIDAP. Shahid used the CFD results in a simplified one-dimensional model o f the complete fenestration system to determine key performance indicators (e.g., U-Value). The results showed that Venetian blinds could have a significant beneficial effect on the window thermal performance. For a double glazed window the U-value decreased by as much as 20%. Yahoda and Wright (2004) have presented a simple one-dimensional model for predicting the thermal resistance o f a double glazed window with a between panes louvered blind. They used empirical correlations for a simple vertical enclosure to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficients. Despite this crude approximation, the predicted U-Values were within 10% to 15 % o f the experimental U-Values measured by Garnet (1999). Naylor and Collins (2004) have extended the work of Yahoda and Wright (2004). Naylor and Collms (2004) used a conjugate convection-conduction CFD model to predict the convective heat transfer coefficients in a window with an inter-pane Venetian blind. These heat transfer coefficients were then used with a simplified radiation model to predict the U-Value o f the window/blind system. They concluded from their study that this approach can be used to predict the overall heat transfer rate with high accuracy. Recently, Lai (2004) has done an experimental study to measure the free convective heat transfer in a double-glazed window with a between-panes Venetian blind.

Experim ents w ere conducted using a M ach-Zehnder interferometer for three slat angles and for three cavity widths. This study provided temperature field visualization as w ell as detailed local N u sselt number data on the hot and cold glazings. All o f the previous studies have been done for a Venetian-type blind. To the author's know ledge, there are no comparable studies for a pleated blind. In the present study, a two-dim ensional CFD m odel is develop ed to study the heat transfer in a w indow w ith a betw een-panes pleated blind.

1.3 Problem Geometry
Figure. 1.1(b) show s a w indow with a betw een-panes pleated blind manufactured by Pella, w hich is currently available on the market. The detailed problem geom etry is illustrated in Figure 1.5. M easurements w ere taken from Pella's recently launched product. The thickness o f blind w as measured to be t=0.20m m and the width o f the blind w as measured to be S=16mm. In the current study, this blind was placed into an enclosure w ith a width o f W =25m m . The aspect ratio w as taken to be A =20 and A = 40 for the present study. It should be noted that A = 20 and A = 40 are nominal values, since it w as chosen to have an integer number o f blind pleats i.e., it w as necessary to adjust the enclosure height slightly in order to avoid a partial pleat. It will be shown later in the results that the enclosure aspect ratio has a very w eak effect on the average Nusselt number. So, the effect o f this small height adjustment is expected to be small. The m odel geometry shown in Figure 1.5 has height H and width W. T h and Tc are respectively hot side and cold side glazing temperatures o f the enclosures, T b is the

In the present study, cotton is taken as the blind material (kB=0.059W/mk). The blind pitch (Pb) in the present case varies as the angle changes. Pb, t and S are the pitch, thickness and Avidth of the blind respectively. SI is a projection length of a blind from the extreme edge to the center and S2 is the half cavity width. The blind em issiv ity S q is kept constant (Gg=0.8).G^andGg are respectively the hot side and cold side glazing surface emissivities.

1.4 Objective of Present Study The objective of this project is to gain an understanding of how a pleated blind inside a vertically oriented double glazed window will influence the free convection between the panes of the window. In the present study, a two-dimensional CFD model is developed to study the conjugate conduction/convection heat transfer effects in a window with a between-panes pleated blind. This study examines the effect o f various geometric parameters for both the cavity and the blind on the window thermal performance. It is then shown that these CFD results (without radiation effects) can be combined with a simple radiation model to obtain the conjugate conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer through the window/blind system.

CHAPTER 2: NUMERICAL MODEL AND SOLUTION PROCEDURES

2.1

Introduction In order to obtain a numerical solution, the physical problem must be described in

mathematical terms. This involves defining governing equations that apply over the relevant computational domain and then implementing boundary conditions. The preprocessing tool GAMBIT is used for the meshing window blind system and FLUENT 6.0 is used for the CFD calculation. The geometry o f the window and blind is shown in Figure 1.5. The issues of grid dependency and validation o f the results are also addressed. A grid sensitivity study is performed and the numerical solution is validated by comparing with De Vahl Davis and Jones (1983) bench mark solution. In the present work, heat transfer effects are studied in the cavity between the hot and cold glazing surfaces. In this model, the Nusselt number is calculated for a range of Rayleigh numbers to determine an effect of the pleated blinds on the thermal energy performance. It has been calculated that the practical range of Rayleigh numbers for the current problem is approximately lO^^RaSlO^. For the current geometry, the upper limit (Ra =10^) occurs for ASHRAE (2001) winter design conditions. These temperature conditions (Tc=-18"C, Th=21"C) correspond to a larger temperature difference than for ASHRAE summer design conditions. For the current study, the average Nusselt number is a function of: NuAvg = f (Ra, Pr, A, kp/ks, blind geometry) The Nusselt number is defined by the following equation: (2.1)

where Q conv is the average convective heat transfer rate, W is width of cavity and kp is the thermal conductivity of filled gas. Most o f the numerical results in following sections are presented for air.

Governing Equations Free convection motion of the fluid occurs due to density changes arising from

the heating process. The buoyancy forces which give rise to the fi-ee convection currents are called body forces. In the present study, the body force is gravitational, and the density gradients are due to temperature variations within the flow field. To describe natural convective heat transfer, the continuity, momentum and energy equations are required. These equations result fi'om applying the laws of conservation of mass, momentum and energy to a control volume. In general, these conservation principles represent mathematical models of the behavior o f the physical problem and they are adequate for the analysis of the vast majority o f engineering problems. These conservation principles lead to the so-called continuity, Navier-Stokes and energy equations. Equations (2.3) through (2.6) are the continuity, x and y momentum equations, and the energy equation for the flow field (Oosthuizen and Naylor (1999)). The flow is assumed to be steady, laminar, incompressible and two-dimensional. The thermo physical properties of fluid and solid are assumed to be constant, except for fluid density which is treated by means of the Boussinesq approximation.

The last term of eq. (2.5) represents the body force acting through the fluid medium which produces the buoyancy induced fluid motion in the vertical direction. By assuming a constant fluid density, the body force term in eq. (2.5) has become a constant. The Boussinesq approximation must be implemented in eq. (2.5) so that the temperature induced fluid density variations may be re-introduced into the body force term. It should be noted that the Boussinesq approximation will account for fluid density variations in the body force term only. This is accomplished by first defining a pressure defect between an arbitrary location within the flow field and the ambient pressure; P '= P - P « (2.7)

The ambient pressure is simply the hydrostatic pressure measured from some reference datum, so that: p»= -p,,gy (2 .8)

Now note the change in the pressure difference p' in the x and y directions respectively:

(2.10) In the case of an incompressible flow, the influence o f the temperature changes on density changes is significant and the influence of pressure changes on density changes is negligible. Therefore, it is convenient to express the buoyancy force in terms of the temperature difference. This can be achieved by introducing the temperature coefficient of the bulk expansion p , such that (p = 0- p)g Substituting eqs.

Conduction through the pleated blind is an important factor in the heat exchange across the window. Steady conduction through blind is governed by Laplace's equation: S'T Sx' =0 (2.14)

At the blind-fluid interfaces, no slip and impermeability conditions are applied. In addition to a continuity of temperature, continuity of heat flux is also applied at these interfaces, expressed as follows:

2 3 Boundary Conditions Listed below are the boundary conditions in dimensional form for the computational domain depicted in Figure 1.5. To solve the continuity, momentum and energy equations the following boundary conditions were applied: u = v=0, T=T h u = V = 0, T=Tc u = V= -- = 0 ay forx=0, for x=W, for y= 0, H 0< y < H 0< y < W 0< x < W (AB) (CD) (AC, BD)

In Fig 1.5 boundaries AB, CD, AC and BD represent solid boundaries where no slip and impermeability boundary conditions apply. The temperatures along boundary AB and CD were set to constant value to model the isothermal centre-of-glass region. In Figure 1.5, boundaries AC and BD represent the adiabatic end walls.

2.4 Properties of Different Fill Gases and ASHRAE Design Conditions The maximum Rayleigh number studied corresponds to the temperature difference between the window glazings for ASHRAE winter design conditions (ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook, 1993). The ASHRAE winter and summer design conditions are shown below in Table 2.1. The properties of various fill gases (air, argon, krypton) have been calculated using the correlation equations given in the VISION reference manual:

grid density independence, the number of nodes within the computational domain was increased by 2.7 times. Figure 2.1 shows the grids for three cases. Table 2.2 and Figure 2.2 show the comparison of these three cases. The number of nodes in case 1, case 2 and case 3 are 39935, 76255 and 106893, respectively. Over the full range o f Rayleigh number, the average Nusselt numbers listed in Table 2.2 differ by only 0.5 %, even though the number o f nodes was increased by approximately 2.7 times. Furthermore, increasing the number o f nodes within the computational domain greatly increases the time required for the solution process. It was found that solutions on the fine grid took almost five times longer than solutions on the coarse grid. Based on these results, the numerical calculations in this thesis were done using a grid density comparable to Case 1. The low grid density was used in order to reduce the computational time for solution procedure. A XEONTM 3.0 GHz processor was used for the numerical study. The following convergence criteria were used: 10'^ for continuity, x-momentum and ymomentum, and 10"^ for energy.

2.5.1 Solution validation with the bench mark solution of De Vahl Davis and Jones (1983) for a square enclosure

Numerical studies require careful validation o f the code and model being used. In this study, the commercial CFD software FLUENT 6.0 has been used, which is a finite volume code. To check the functionality of the commercial software package being used for this study, a numerical solution has been compared to the benchmark solution o f De Vahl Davis and Jones (1983). This benchmark solution is for two-dimensional free convection in a square enclosure (A=l). This solution also served to test the grid

The numerical results shown in Figure 2.3 indicate that, at the highest Rayleigh number Ra=10^ (worst case), the average Nusselt number differs by 2% compared to the De Vahl Davis and Jones (1983) benchmark solution. Figure 2.3 indicates that the numerical code predicts an average Nusselt number very comparable to bench mark solution o f De Vahl Davis and Jones (1983) over the entire range o f Rayleigh numbers.

2.5.2 Natural convection in 2D rectangular cavity for high aspect ratio (A = 40) The convective flow patterns between a hot plate and cold plate in a 2D rectangular cavity have been studied. The value o f average Nusselt number calculated by CFD calculation has been compared with the correlation by Wright (1996). According to the literature, the critical value of Ra at which the Nusselt number leaves the conduction regime is function of A. As shown in Figure 1.3, the average Nusselt number leaves the conduction regime at lower values o f Ra in cavities with lower values o f A. Figure 2.4 shows a comparison between the current CFD study and the correlation by Wright (1996). It can be seen in this Figure that the CFD results and correlation results are within 5% at low Rayleigh numbers. A t high Rayleigh numbers, the agreement is closer (about 1.3%).

CHAPTER 3: PRESENTATION OF RESULTS 3.1 Introduction In this chapter, selected numerical results are presented and the effects of a pleated blind on the energy performance are shown. The effect o f Rayleigh numbers on the average Nusselt number is compared for different blind geometries in Section 3.2. In the last section o f this Chapter, a comparison is made between a two-dimensional CFD model which includes radiation effects, and a simplified one-dimensional model. A sample of input file for the mesh generation is given in Appendix A. Also, selected numerical results from this study are presented in tabular form in Appendix B.

3.2

Results from the Free Convection CFD Model Finite volume solutions were obtained for different blind geometries to compute

the convective heat transfer between the panes of the double glazed window. The range of Rayleigh numbers has been taken to be 10^ < Ra <10^ and the fluid Prandtl number was taken to be Pr=0.71. This Prandlt number corresponds (approximately) to that o f air, krypton and argon, in the temperature range of typical window applications. The aspect ratio was taken to be A=20 and A=40 for most of the cases and blind width was taken to be S=16mm. The enclosure width was taken to be W=25mm. Temperature difference between hot and cold glazings was fixed at AT=1°C. Altliough the Rayleigh number could have been adjusted by changing the temperature difference between the glazings, in the current study the Rayleigh number was increased by increasing gravity (g). This approach was taken to allow converged solutions at lower Rayleigh numbers to be used as the initial value for next the iterative solution at higher

Rayleigh number. This is called "incremental loading" and improves the likelihood of achieving convergence, particularly at high Rayleigh number.

3.2.1 Effects of Properties of Selected Gases on the Convective Heat Transfer In this section, results are compared for three different filled gases (air, argon and krypton) that are commonly used in insulated glazing units. The properties o f air, argon and krypton are calculated using the equations from the VISION reference manual, which are given in previous chapter. It should be noted that the Prandtl number for air, argon and krypton are approximately the same (Pr=0.71). Figure 3.1 shows the variation o f the average Nusselt number with Rayleigh number for the three different fill gases. It can be seen that the fill gas has only a slight effect on the average Nusselt number over the full range o f Rayleigh number. This result is expected, since the Prandtl numbers are approximately same. The slight difference in the results for the three gases is caused by the slight difference in the conductivity ratio. In these three cases, the blind to gas thermal conductivity ratio (kB/kp) varies from 2.35 (for air) to 6.25 (for krypton).

3.2.2

Effects o f Blind thermal Conductivity on the Convective Heat Transfer There are various types of blind material available on the market. For pleated

blinds, the material may be paper, cotton, silk or fiber. Table 3.1 shows the range of thermal conductivities for various materials that might be used. Figure 3.2 shows the effect o f blind conductivity on the average Nusselt number. It is interesting to note that the blind conductivity ratio has a strong effect on the average

Nusselt number over the range of Rayleigh number 10^<Ra<10^. It can be seen in Figure 3.2 that the blind thermal conductivity has the greatest effect at low Rayleigh numbers. The average Nusselt number for kB/kF=42.9 is 15.6% higher than that for kB/kp=2.53, in the conduction regime. However, as the convection strengthens at higher Rayleigh numbers, the difference in the average Nusselt numbers decreases. At Ra=10^, the average Nusselt numbers differs by only 3.5%. The effect of blind conductivity is less at high Ra because convection plays a more dominant role in the overall heat transfer.

Effects o f Blind Width on Convective Heat Transfer It is interesting to find the effect of blind width (S) on heat transfer rate. Figure

The ratio S1/S2 (see Figure 1.5) indicates the proximity o f the blind tips (i.e., the folds) to the window glazings. The corresponding stream function contours and temperature contours

for these three cases are shown in Figures 3.4 and 3.5. In the present case, the blind is kept in the center o f the enclosure and the blind angle (0 ) is constant at 30°. So, increasing the blind width decreases the gap between tips o f blind and the window glazing. It is shown in Figure 3.3 that in the conduction regime (low Rayleigh number), the convective heat transfer is almost unaffected by the blind width. At higher Rayleigh numbers, as convection strengthens, the width of the blind has a stronger effect. As the blind width increases, the average Nusselt number increases. There appears to be two reasons. It can be seen from the stream function contours (Figure 3.4) that the value o f the maximum stream function increases as the blind width increases. This indicates that there is a stronger flow on both sides of the blind as S increases. This will tend to increase the convective heat transfer rate. In addition, as mentioned above, increasing S decreases the gap between tips o f blind and the window glazing. So, for example, this allows the fluid on the hot side of the enclosure to flow in closer proximity to the cold glazing. This geometric effect also reduces the convective resistance of the enclosure.

3.2.4

Effects of Blind Angle on Convective Heat Transfer In the present study, the effect o f blind angle (®) on the heat transfer rate has been

examined. Figure 3.6 shows the effect o f blind angle on the average Nusselt number for a range o f Rayleigh number. Three cases are considered; 0=30°, 0=45° and 0=60°. The corresponding stream function contours and temperature contours for these three cases are shown in Figures 3.7 and 3.8. It is shown in Figure 3.6, that at low Rayleigh numbers

the blind angle has only a weak effect on the convective heat transfer rate. At higher Rayleigh numbers the behavior is complex and involves competing effects. On the one hand, increasing the blind angle increases the strength o f the convective flow in the enclosure. This can be seen from the value o f the maximum stream function (Figure 3.7). This effect will act to increase the convection. However, on the other hand, as the blind angle increases, the gap between the blind tips (folds) increases. As discussed previously, a wider gap prevents the flow from "penetrating" as deeply across the enclosure and increases the convective resistance. It can be seen in Figure 3.7 that there is an interplay o f these two competing effects. From a practical perspective, most window applications correspond to a Rayleigh number substantially lower than Ra=10^. So, for many applications. Figure 3.6 shows that the lowest blind angle (®=30°) will give the largest convective resistance. In practice, lower angles will require more blind material and a compromise will have to be made. The effect o f blind angle on the convective heat transfer has also been calculated for a higher aspect ratio enclosure, A=40. It was found that the. results generally follow the same pattern. Given the complexity of the heat transfer behavior, it would be an interesting area for researchers to do an experimental study.

3.2.5

Effects of Aspect Ratio on Convective Heat Transfer Aspect ratio (H/W) is an important factor in the window geometry that may affect

heat transfer rate. In present study, two aspect ratios have been considered: A=20 and A==40. As mentioned earlier, these aspect ratios are only nominal values. It was

necessary to adjust the height o f the enclosure slightly to obtain an integer number of

blinds. Figure 3.9 shows the effect of aspect ratio on the average Nusselt number over a range o f Rayleigh number for A-- 20 and A=40. It is interesting to note that the aspect ratio has almost no effect on the average heat transfer rate. The maximum percentage difference was 0.26%. The reason for this is because the pleated blind divides the cavity. It can be seen in the contour plots (e.g.. Figure 3.4, Figure 3.7) that the velocity and temperature fields become highly periodic. As a result, increasing the height o f the enclosure simply repeats the same flow pattern.

3.3

Numerical Radiation Model of the Between-Panes Pleated Blind In this section, a conjugate convection, conduction, and radiation model is

developed. This "Simplified Model" corresponds to the convective heat transfer data firom the convection-only CFD model, combined with a simple one dimensional radiation model. The results o f this simplified model have been compared to a full CFD simulation, which included radiation effects. The full CFD solution has been tested for grid independence. The comparison with the full CFD numerical solution has been made for summer weather conditions.

Radiation Calculation The one dimensional radiation model is based on the assumption that all surfaces may be treated as opaque, grey and diffrise. Also, it is assumed that the blind can be approximated as having a single temperature (Tb). Figure 3.11 shows the resistance network for the one-dimensional radiation heat transfer between the hot glazing and the pleated blind. In this figure, is emissivity of hot-side glazing surface, Sg is emissivity

of blind. Fgg is the view factor from hot surface glazing to blind. Referring to Figure 3.10, the area of the blind is related to the area of the window as:

For each calculation, the blind temperature T b was adjusted iteratively until the energy balance was satisfied at the blind surface, as per eq. (3.14).

33.2 Grid Independency Study for Convection/Conduction/Radiation CFD Model The issue o f independency of the grid has been studied for the conjugate convection/conduction/radiation model (fiill CFD model) and results are shown in Table 3.2. As can be seen from Case 1 and Case 2 in Table 3.2, incrccising the number of nodes and sub-surfaces by 2.4 times changed the total heat transfer rate less than 1% and radiation heat transfer rate by 1.3%. In comparison, the convective heat transfer rate is essentially unchanged. Comparing Case 1 and Case 3, the number of nodes and sub surfaces is increased by almost three times. The total heat transfer rate changed by 5.3% and radiation heat transfer changed by 8%, but the convective heat transfer changed by only 0.02%. Based on this testing, the full CFD model was run with a grid density comparable to case 3 (approx. 100,000 nodes).

3 3 3 Comparison of the Simplified One Dimensional Model with the Full CFD ModeL It is very interesting to compare the full CFD model with the simplified model. Two cases have been considered. Case 1 is an untreated window (High-e) and Case 2 is a window with a low emissivity coating on the hot glazing (Low-e). As discussed above, in

the simplified model, the convective heat transfer coefficients were obtained fi-om the convection-only CFD solution and the blind temperature Tb was adjusted iteratively to achieve an energy balance at the blind surface (eq. 3.12). The total heat transfer has been calculated and compared to the total heat transfer rate fi' om the full CFD solution. The ASHRAE summer conditions and window glazing properties were as follows: Case 1 High-e Window : Th=305K Case 2 Low-e Window Th=305K Tc=297K £h = 0.1 Gg = 0.8 Gg =0.84

 Tc=297K  e,, =0.84 Gg = 0.8 Gg =0.84

Results for case 1 (untreated, high-e window) are shown in Table 3.3. It can be seen that the simplified model works very well. The simplified model predicts the radiative and total heat transfer rates to better than 1%.

The results for the treated, low-e window (case 2) are shown in Table 3.4. It can be seen in Table 3.4 that the heat transfer rates predicted by the simplified model are approximately 4% lower than predicted by the fiill CFD simulation. This level of accuracy is acceptable for most window design applications. Figure 3.12 shows the temperature contours and stream function for the low-e case. It can be seen from this figure that decreasing emissivity on the hot side increases the thermal resistance from hot side to blind. Note that the temperature difference between the hot glazing and the blind is much larger than the temperature difference between the blind and the cold glazing. As expected. Table 3.4 indicates that the

radiation heat transfer rate is lower than the convective heat transfer rate at the hot glazing. The reverse is true at the cold (untreated) glazing.

CHAPTER 4: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

4.1 Conclusions A numerical study has been conducted that examines the effect o f a pleated blind located between the panes of a double glazed window. The focus o f this study was on the effect o f the blind on the free convection within the window enclosure. The main results are summarized as follows;

(i) The convective heat transfer rate is not a strong function of the aspect ratio of the window enclosure (A=H/W). The results for A=20 and A=40 show that the aspect ratio has almost no effect on the average Nusselt number. For the geometries studied, the maximum percentage difference was found to be 0.26% over a Rayleigh number range 10^< R a< 10l

(ii) The type of fill gas (air, argon or krypton) has only a weak effect on the convective heat transfer rate. The maximum percentage difference for three types of fill gas was found to be 1.6%. This small difference in average Nusselt number was caused by the slight difference in conductivity ratio, since the Prandtl numbers for the three gases are essentially the same (Pr=0.7).

(iii) As blind width (S) increases, the convective heat transfer rate was found to increase over the frill range of Rayleigh number. There appear to be two reasons. As S increases, the gap between the tips of blind and the window glazing decreases, allowing the fluid on

the hot side of the enclosure to "penetrate" closer to the cold glazing. Similarly, because o f blind symmetry, this geometric change also allows the fluid on the cold side o f the enclosure to flow in closer proximity to the hot glazing. This geometric effect also causes stronger flow on both sides o f the blind, which acts to increase the convective heat transfer.

(iv) The effect o f blind angle was found to be complex. For constant blind width (S), when the blind angle (O) increases, the gap between the blind tips (folds) and the glazing surface increases. As discussed above, this geometric effect will tend to reduce convective heat transfer rate. However, it can be seen from the stream function values that the strength o f the flow in the enclosure increases as blind angle increases. So, this behavior involves competing effects. At low Rayleigh number, near the pure conduction regime, the lowest blind angle studied (0=30°) was found to give the highest convective resistance. But, at higher Rayleigh number, this situation changed because o f the competing effects discussed above.

(v) Most of the results presented in this thesis do not include the conjugate effects of thermal radiation. However, it has been shown that the data from the convection-only model can be combined with a simplified one-dimensional model to estimate the overall U-value of the enclosure. The accuracy o f this simplified method was found to be sufficient for most window design applications. So, for many practical purposes, it is not necessary to include the effects o f radiation in the CFD calculation. This has the benefits of reducing the computational requirements and the number of variables in the solution.

Using the procedure given in this thesis, the average Nusselt number data can be applied to a window and blind with arbitrary radiation parameters.

4.2 Recommendations It is recognized that the current work has only a limited scope. Further research needs to be done to more hilly understand the interactions between the window and blind. Recommendations for future studies are as follows;

i) The results o f the current study need to be verified experimentally. This could be done using laser interferometry and flow visualization, similar to the previous studies of Machin (1997) and Lai (2004), which were done for a Venetian blind.

ii) In present study of inter-pane pleated blind, the pitch o f the blind folds was assumed to be constant. However, in an actual window, the weight o f the blind produces a significant variation in the blind pitch. Near the top of the window, the blind folds are more closely spaced than near the bottom. This variation in geometry will affect the convection to some extent. This effect needs to be studied, both numerically and experimentally.

iii) In present study, the blind is considered to be located in center of the window enclosure. In commercial window products, the blind is sometimes located off-center in order to fit muntin bars inside the enclosure. So, the effect of off-center blind placement should be considered for future numerical and experimental study.
