A PCSW M M / GIS Based W ater Balance M odel for the R eesor C reek W atershed

A bstract One of the driving pressures of land-use changes is urban developm ent. In the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), there have been drastic changes to local w atersheds as urban areas sprawl over surro u n d in g rural areas. It is necessary to understand the w ater balance of a w atershed in order to develop and im plem ent w atershed procedures that are addressed in a w atershed plan. In an urbanized w atershed, the runoff rate and volum e will increase. While Duffins Creek m ay be one of the healthiest w atersheds in the GTA, it is also one that is producing the most concern for the Toronto and Region Conservation A uthority w here findings suggested that proposed urbanization will im pact the w ater quality and quantity. There are three objectives for this research. The first is to develop a m odelling m ethodologv that integrates CIS (e.g. ArcGlS) and hydrologie m odels (e.g. SWMM) in a w ater balance analysis on a w atershed basis and dem onstrate the m ethodology by a case study for the Reesor Creek w atershed. The second objective is to calibrate the CIS-- based w ater balance model by observing how differing techniques, in this case, lum ped, clustered, grid, and kriging analyses can discretize both the landscape and incoming precipitation. And the last objective is to observe the effects of spatially distributed rainfall m easurem ents and their affects on the three m odelling approaches. Results show that discretization of a w atershed does affect the percentage difference in m easured and generated runoff volumes; how ever this can be refined w ith calibration. Also, kriging rainfall can predict rainfall at un gauged (virtual) sites only u nder certain conditions and that a strong correlation between m easured rainfall values does not confirm a strong relationship with generated runoff. Recom m endations included the use of a longer time series of rainfall, stream flow, and predicted rainfall to observe tem poral variations, as well as to use climate data such as evaporation and tem perature in the m odels. It was also recom m ended that a larger num ber of sam ple points to be used in the kriging with various surface interpolation techniques to observe model differences.

1. W atershed Planning in Ontario

The O ntario M inistry of the E nvironm ent (MCE) (1993a) describes a w atershed as the land that is drain ed by a river and its tributaries, and a su b w atersh ed as the land drained by an individual tributary to the m ain w atercourse. In other w ords, a w atershed is a discrete hydrologie system , the state of w hich is affected by the environm ental conditions of its su b w atersheds an d the m ainstream river.

Land-use changes in a w atershed and subw atersheds have been found to have significant im pacts on the hydrologie processes that occur w ithin them (Ellis, 1999; Nix, 1994; an d Taniguchi, 1997). Spatial variations in the total percentage im perviousness by land-use type can significantly affect soil and g ro u n d w ater storage, w hich in turn, influence w atershed runoff ratios an d baseflow characteristics by increasing or decreasing flow volum es. The rem oval of natural vegetation and the grading of land by u rb an developm ent can elim inate both interception and depression storage by covering the land w ith im pervious surfaces (MOE, 2003). The MOE (2003) states that grading and im pervious surfaces change the hydraulic roughness of land an d result in greater runoff velocities, thus, reducing runoff travel times an d soil infiltration rates.

O ne of the driving pressures of land-use changes is u rb an developm ent. In the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), there have been drastic changes to local w atersheds as u rb a n areas spraw l over surro u n d in g ru ral areas. C hanges such as increased flooding and decreased ground w ater recharge have occurred due to u rb an developm ent (Toronto and Region C onservation A uthority (TRCA), 2002a). It is w ise to develop w ater m anagem ent plans for future urban

developm ent in o rder to avoid degradation to the n atu ral environm ent. W ater m anagem ent plans can be designed to m inim ize the im pacts associated w ith hum an land-use and enhance the n atu ral environm ent w herever possible. U ltim ately, this integrated approach protects natu ral resources, allows for inform ed planning decisions, involves stakeholders, increases approval

efficiency, and saves m oney to all involved (Li, 2002).

A w atershed m anagem ent plan recom m ends the actions th at should be taken for each ecological area in a w atershed in concert w ith prevention and protection, enhancem ent, and rehabilitation. In term s of protection, the MOE, local m unicipalities, and th e TRCA need to prom ote the appropriate initiatives that are ncjcessary for protecting ecosystem health headw aters, aquifer recharge/discharge areas, w etlands, and fish habitat. Enhancem ent conditions should specify opportunities that will serve to im prove the function and health of the ecosystem s, such as, infiltration, vegetative linkages, buffers, fish habitat, sanctuaries, public access points, treed parks, creation of rural beaches/w ater contact sport areas, and riparian vegetation. Finally,

rehabilitation criteria should prioritize the sites' problem s, as well as the resources required to reh.abilitate them . The plan can outline preferred m easures or strategies for im proved land m anagem ent and for the abatem ent of all p o in t and non-point sources (MOE, 1993a).

The MOE (1994) suggests that "w atershed plan n in g ...ad d resses the inter relationships of the hydrologie regime, w ater use patterns, and land-use...[as the] preferred basis for w ater m anagem ent decisions". The first step in

w atershed planning is to identify a goal and the u n iq u e objectives needed in order to achieve that goal. For example, a goal for a w atershed p la n m ay be to protect the n atu ral environm ent an d rehabilitate deg rad ed environm ents, w hile th e collateral objectives m ight be to elim inate sew er discharges, increase

green spaces and pervious surfaces, and im prove u rb an runoff w ater quality. As a result, the goals an d objectives of a w atershed plan will reflect the characteristics an d issues of the w atershed u n d er study (Li, 2002; IWRRI, 1998).

A chievem ent of w ater m anagem ent objectives should be m easured w ith respect to indicators an d /o r param eters. O ne exam ple is the Toronto Wet Weather Flow Management Plan (WWFMP), w hich has 12 objectives listed against its respective indicators an d /o r param eters in o rder to w eight each one. Table 1 depicts som e of the criteria or indicators in the Toronto S tudy (Li,
2002 ).

"W atershed m anagem ent plans and policies can be developed by analyzing the ecological im pacts of various developm ent scenarios and evaluating their success for attaining w atershed objectives. C om parison of alternative

developm ent scenarios requires th at relative w eights be assigned to w atershed objectives and a consistent rating system for various levels of achievem ent be adopted. The final developm ent scenario and the associated w atershed w ide policy (w hich m axim izes th e overall achievem ent of w atershed objectives) w ill be recom m ended" (Li, 2002 an d MOE, 1993b, and MOE, 1993c).

In O ntario, the principal planning docum ent in the m unicipal land u se planning process is the official plan. The plan identifies m unicipal goals and objectives for lan d use w ithin its jurisdiction and provides explicit policy direction th at guides land developm ent in agreem ent w ith provincial policies and guidelines. Official plans reflect the direction, goals, and targets established in the w ater m anagem ent plan. The relationship betw een w ater m anagem ent planning and land use process is illustrated in Figure 1.

Today, m odelling is one of the key approaches to w atershed m anagem ent and one of th e greatest concerns in w atershed m odelling is the extent of spatial and tem poral detail u sed (Kelly and Wool, 1995). Z hu and M ackay (2001)

exam ined the effects of spatial detail on soil inform ation on a w atershed basis, and its im plications on hydrologie modelling. Im pacts w ere assessed by the com paring the sim ulated hydro-ecological response based on the spatial detail of the soil inform ation from fuzzy-logic and soü m ap sources. Their results show ed th a t spatial soil inform ation does im pact hydrologie results in lu m p ed w atershed m odels, w hile a clustered (subw atershed) approach w as less affected by the variable soil inform ation.

S torm w ater M an ag em en t in O ntario

W anielista and Yousef (1993) state th a t storm w ater m anagem ent (SWM) is a discipline th at is u sed to understand, control, an d utilize w ater and that its applications are evident in m any m anagem ent activities such as w ater supply, flood control, u rb an runoff, an d ecological conservation. Characteristics such as the peak rate, volum e, and runoff rate influence the p lan n in g an d design of SWM practices. P rior to urbanization, these characteristics are a function of the n atu ral w atershed w ith characteristics such as soü type, topography, and vegetation cover. U rbanization alters w atershed characteristics, w hich in turn change n atu ral m n o ff characteristics (Li, 2002; H su et al., 2000 an d Li, 1991).

In an u rb an ized w atershed, the runoff rate an d volum e w ill increase (Leopold et al., 1964). This is because p av ed surfaces, rooftops, altered drainage

system s, and sew er system s convey runoff at greater rates because of their im perviousness and m inim al friction coefficients (Figure 2). D ow nstream ,

storage w atersheds such as local stream s, w etlands, ponds, and lakes can exceed their capacities a n d flooding can occur w ithin an expanded floodplain. A nother related problem is channel erosion, w hich d epends on runoff rate and its d u ratio n (Deebo and Reese, 1995).

As a result, urbanization not only increases runoff rates and volum es, b u t also increases the frequency of u rb an runoff. In this case, frequency refers to the n u m b er of u rbanized runoff events over a p eriod expressed as a percentage of time. Frequency is im p o rtan t since it has a direct im pact on n atu ral drainage erosion and sedim ent tran sp o rt (Li, 2002).

In term s of w ater quality, runoff loading from u rb an ized environm ents differs from n o n -u rb an environm ents. For instance, runoff from an urbanized

en v iro n m en t m ig h t carry large concentrations of: chlorides from ro ad salt, oil and grease form autom obiles, hydrocarbons from fuel spills, residential fertilizer nutrients, and bacteria from dom estic anim al w aste and soil particles. N o n -u rb an runoff m ight carry concentrations of pesticides, herbicides, and bacteria from farm ing practices, eroded sedim ents, an d n atu rally occurring nutrients. The change of runoff quality can resu lt in a general d eg rad ation of w ater quality in the receiving w aters (Debo and Reese, 1995; Li, 2002).

Li (2002) states th a t in a traditional sense, SWM p lanning focuses prim arily on in d iv id u al sites th at are u n d erg o in g u rb an developm ent. It is a planning process w here SWM practices are selected so th at p re-d ev elo p m en t runoff peak rates and g ro u n d w ater recharge is preserved. H ow ever, peak flow control at individual sites does n o t guarantee p reserv atio n of the n atu ral w atercourse. Thus, SWM planning should be im p lem en ted on a w atershed basis.

Lot level and conveyance controls are those th a t are u sed at in d iv id u al lots, those w hich form p art of the conveyance system , an d controls th a t m ay serve m u ltip le lots b u t are only suitable for sm all drainage areas (< 2 hectares). O n the o th er hand, end-of-pipe controls receive w ater from a conveyance system and discharge to receiving w ater. Typically, these facilities serve n u m ero u s lots or w hole subdivisions. com bination of The term "treatm ent train" is u sed to describe the usually required in an overall storm w ater

H istorical practice has been to use lu m p ed represen tatio n because of co m p utational lim itations or because d ata w as n o t available to po p ulate a clu stered or g rid m odel database (Vieux, 2001, 1). This is no longer the case today w h ere m odelling databases are becom ing increasingly m ore discrete by the in tro d u ctio n of digital databases, analysis softw are, an d the im proved PC com pu tatio n al p o w er to h an d le all of it.

By studying lum ped, clustered, and grid m odelling the study is able to identify the lim itations th a t evolve from the three approaches (Figure 3). Research has dem onstrated th at there are significant problem s w ith lum ped m odelling such as those identified by Burke (1995), Pullar and Springer (2000), an d Vieux
( 2001):

The m odel is n o t physics-based, in other w ords, there is a lack of num erical representation used for m odelling routing and runoff. The m odel cannot approxim ate the real w orld accurately due to errors in the spatial structure of the lum ped data. T here is no account for variations in the w atershed (e.g. rainfall, to p o g rap h y )--all param eters are assum ed constant. C alibration and validation are dependent on param eter estim ation, thus, increasing uncertainty. Equally good results can sometimes be observed by p aram eter values (e.g. this stu d y to date). adjusting

th at is needed to obtain results. This type of m odel is usually generalized and can be significantly spatially and tem porarily inaccurate. O n the other hand, a grid m odel w ould require very detailed attribute data (e.g. average

precipitation p er pixel in the w atershed) an d result in m any hours of analysis. H ow ever, the m odel w ould be m ore detailed b o th spatially and tem porarily.

H ow ever, if the data perm its, any lum ped database can be tu rn ed into a sem i clustered m odel-- this could be term ed subw atershed m odelling. This

approach is still a lum ped m odel approach, only slightly m ore discrete. An exam ple of this w ould be the HEC-HMS/GIS m odel com pleted for the Cityf of Cherokee in N orth-w estern O kalahom a. In this case, subw atersheds were

assigned u n it response function for incom ing precipitation to characterize each subw atershed. The study began as a lu m p ed d ata set (ASCE, 1999).

O n the other hand, clustered m odelling requires the w atershed to be divided into a grid or sm aller subw atersheds. Each cell or subv/atershed will have its ow n detailed database representing its characteristics. The result is a far m ore discrete m anner of analysis w hen com pared to a lu m p ed approach. H owever, clustered m odels are by no m eans perfect, and can only be as detailed as the data available. The sheer volum e of the database th a t can be produced at a clustered or grid level w ould also increase w hen com pared to a lum ped approach (Burke, 1995). As stated previously, a clustered or grid m odel

requires vast am ounts of data.

For instance, Burke (1995) explains th a t in a w ater balance m odel for the U pper G uadiana w atershed in Spain, a pixel resolution of 200m on a grid 900 by 850 pixels produces close to a m illion pixels. Each pixel w as characterized w ith its ow n values for several attributes. A project like this will take som e tim e to com pute, and requires a significant am ount of com puter pow er. Today,

ArcGIS on a high speed PC can com plete this process, b u t will take several h o u rs to calculate values for each pixel. The result w as a highly detailed

C hapter 2 is organized in a w ay that further clarifies the need, objectives and scope of this study. The p u rp o se here is to identify h o w w ater balancing is a key com ponent in w atershed m anagem ent. Recent technology advances in

hydrologie m odelling (e.g. USERA SWMM model) and geographic inform ation system (GIS) have paved a new direction is w ater balance analysis. This

chapter w ill discuss the capabilities and contributions these technologies have m ade, an d w here they m ight continue to explore.

1. W ater B alancing

In the early 1980s, w atershed plans prim arily addressed flooding an d erosion concerns. Today, there are m any issues that are addressed in a w atershed

plan; som e of these include flooding, reduced baseflow, erosion control, protection of aquatic and terrestrial habitat, enhancem ent of w ater quantity and quality, to geom orphic changes and w ater balance (or budget) (MOE, 1993b). N atural w atersheds m aintain a balance betw een precipitation, runoff, infiltration, evaporation, an d évapotranspiration (Gum m ing C ockbum Lim ited (CCL), 2001). It is necessary to u n d erstan d the w ater balance of a w atershed in order to develop and im plem ent w atershed procedures th at are addressed in the w atershed plan (CCL, 2001).

Generally, a w ater balance is com posed of tw o inter-related com ponents: the surface drainage area characterized by the topography and subsurface drainage, w hich is characterized by soil and bedrock features. As a result,

w ater balance equations are u sed to define a w atershed's hydrologie regim e (CCL, 2001). O n a regional basis, w ater balance in a w atershed can be

discussed as the change in storage (AS), w hich is equal to the sum of

AS = P + G i " Go  Q ~ EX

A second approach to evaluate w ater balance is to analyze the soil system. In this case, the change in soil m oisture storage (ASs) w ill equal the total infiltration (I), m inus interflow (Qs), g ro u n d w ater recharge (Rg), and soil m oisture évapotranspiration (ETs) (CCL, 2001; W anielista an d Yousef, 1993).

ASs = I - Q s - R g - E T s

It should be n oted th at the spatial and tem poral characteristics of the w atershed are contributing factors in w ater balance com putation. Spatially,

w atershed topography will determ ine surface flow direction an d quantity, w hile soil types and bedrock features wiU determ ine subsurface flow. On the other h an d , tem porally a w atershed's storage capacity, precipitation rate, and percentage im perviousness will characterize h ow w ater is distributed w ithin the w atershed over tim e (CCL, 2001).

G oodchild et al. (2001) stated, "Science an d practical p ro b lem solving are no longer distinct in their m ethods, th a t GIS can b rid g e th e gap betw een th e tw o".

"In th e strictest sense, a CIS is a co m p u ter system capable of assem bling, storing, m an ipulating, a n d displaying geographically referenced inform ation (e.g. d ata identified according to their locations). P ractitioners also reg ard the total GIS as in cluding o perating p erso n n el an d th e d ata th at go into the system ...G IS technology can be u sed for scientific investigations, resource m anagem ent, an d developm ent plarm ing." (U nited States Geological Survey (USGS), 2002; M eloncon, et al., 1999; and T arboton, 2000).

In a GIS, d ata is m uch m ore flexible in th e w ay it can be represented. Spatial d ata in a GIS can be disp lay ed ju st like a p a p e r m ap features are rep resented com plete w ith legend, b o rd er an d titles, or it can b e rep resen ted as a set of statistical tables, w hich can be converted to charts an d graphs. The m ost im p o rta n t featu re of GIS is th a t spatial d ata are sto red as a spatial d atabase (D igital Land System s Research (DLSR), 2001).

There are tw o m eth o d s of storing m a p p e d inform ation: in vector fo rm at an d in raster form at. In vector form at a GIS stores d ata as po in ts, lines, an d polygons.

Inform ation su ch as p recip itatio n , evaporation, land-use, soil type, storage, an d o v erlan d or g ro u n d w a te r flow are spatially variable inform ation. GIS is beg in n in g to

In term s of d ata exchange, the GIS is able to calculate the p aram eters th a t apply to surface an d g ro u n d w ater m odels. For exam ple, the m any attributes th a t are n eed ed in a hydrologie m odel, such as flow rates, precipitation, an d land-use usually h av e very different form ats. GIS is able to m ake all th e differing layers of d ata com patible for analysis u sing spreadsheets and statistical softw are packages th a t are in corporated into the GIS.

U nlike conventional, non-spatial hydrologie packages, the GIS interface p rovides a d irect com m unication link b etw een the w ater balance m odel and spatial locations. The com puting lan g u ag es th a t are com patible w ith GIS

softw are such as ArcGIS include V isual Basic, V isual C++, A venue, and Delphi. This d iv erse language capability allow s for th e in p u t files of the w ater balance m o d el to be analyzed b y the GIS an d p ro d u ce o u tp u t files th a t can be u sed in the w ater balance m odel and w hich are n o w spatially registered (ESRI, 2002b an d CCL, 2001). For exam ple, by taking the results of several d ata files

p ro d u ced on hydrologie softw are such as SWMM of storage, drainage, flow rates, infiltration, etc. an d overlaying th em in the CIS, a statistical analysis of all layers can be ru n sim ultaneously. A nom alies can be adjusted from both the in p u t hydrologie data (PCSWMM) an d th e GIS data. This m akes for a userdefined en v ironm ent an d adjustable m odel, w h ich includes spatially

d istrib u ted p aram eters for in d e p en d en t and d ep en d e n t variables.

Finally, in term s of the integrating the GIS an d w ater balance properties, once the d a ta of the hydrologie m odel are en tered into the GIS the u ser can look at the m o d el in hydrologie units. In o th er w ords, the GIS can apply a grid to the d ata layers an d divide the data into cells th a t hav e th eir o w n characteristics (Figure 6), as is com m only u sed in h ydrologie m odels (N ijssen et al., 1996 and CCL, 2001).

As a result, this approach to w ater balance analysis allows the w ater balance com putations to be applied to an individual cell or pixel, instead of lum ped together as a w atershed or sub w atershed (CCL, 2001).

By usin g this integrated approach, a large data set m u st be m ade available and m o rd er to com pute th e model; m any runs (tests) m ust be com pleted--this is usually the m ost tim e consum ing for this kind of study. The term "ru n " refers to the num ber of tim es the m odel is tested to produce an overall result.

lu m p ed m odels or to develop m ore sophisticated teclinology for m anaging spatial d ata" (Vieux, 2001,1).

Similar to SWMM, there are volum es of literature available regarding GIS and its applications to w atershed m odelling. M any authors have u sed the GIS as a tool to prepare data for external program or analysis (Yoon, 1996; M attikalli and R ichards, 1996), and m any other authors have u sed GIS strictly for m ap p in g results or even discrete data analysis used it for discrete analysis (Brun and Band, 2000).. But w hatever it is u sed for, they aU have one thing in com m on--w atershed m odelling. The following will outline only som e of the copious am ount of resources available in this ty p e of m odelling.

In the sim plest form GIS w as used to display ecological risks to decision m akers in a case study for the B runette River w atershed in British Colum bia by Z andbergen (1998). A conceptual m odel w as developed an d sets of indicators w ere chosen to assess the im pacts of urbanization on local stream s. The

indicators included: im pervious area, rip arian habitat, p o llu tan t loadings, w ater quality, sedim ent quality, and fish and public health. The inform ation extracted from each of the indicators w as given a score. Two of indicators (im perviousness and w ater quality) w ere incorporated into a GIS to portray areas of concern w ith the w atershed.

Prisloe et al. (2001) describes an ArcView GIS based m odel being developed by the N o rth east Regional Earth Science A pplications Centre th a t estim ates im perviousness at the local w atershed level. The m odel uses land-use landcover data interpreted from m ulti-tem poral 1995 L andsat TM im agery and land-use / land-cover-specific im pervious surface coefficients derived from large-scale planim etric d ata from C onnecticut tow ns that range from rural to

urban. The m odel allow s the user to evaluate all w atersheds com pletely or partially w ithin a tov^m and generate a screen display, w hich depicts estim ates of stream quality based o n existing land-use an d land-cover conditions. W hen assessing a single w atershed there is an option to change existing forest and agricultural la n d to u rb an land uses to calculate future increases in im pervious surface area an d its im pacts on w ater quality. D esigned as a m anagem ent tool, Prisloe's Research contributed interactive capabilities for decision m akers th a t allow the user to visualize the affect landuse has on runoff.

Unlike the B runette Beach study (previous page), a storm w ater m aster p lan using GIS w as com pleted for the Blue River w atershed in Johnston C ounty, Kansas. The stu d y focused on the developing a p lan that ad d ressed cu rren t affairs and pro v id ed guidance for further grow th (Sauer and O 'N eill, 2000). The stu d y applied tw o m odelling tools: the US Army C orps of Engineers HECGeo RAS an d ArcInfo/ArcView. It should be noted that the HEC-GeoRAS

used in this stu d y to delineate the Reesor Creek drainage b oundaries is the sam e as the tool u sed in Sauer and O 'N eill (2000). In this case, Arclnfo w as

used to develop the param eters generated by the coverage's of landuse, soil type, elevation, and M anning's (n) value. In total, 368 subw atersheds w ere m odelled. The HEC-GeoRAS and Arclnfo georeferenced dataset w as u sed in the HEC-RAS m odel in o rd er to delineate the stream netw ork and geom etry. The result w as detailed in p u t and o u tp u t floodplain d ata w hich in tu rn generated floodplain polygons that could be overlaid in ArcView w ith other landuse coverage's for decision makers. In addition, using ArcView scripts, the floodplain coverage's could effectively be displayed, queried, an d exported for u se in HEC-RAS.

O n the other h an d , a detailed runoff sim ulation w as com pleted by Saghafian et al. (2002) w here a new m ethod of tim e-area analysis is discussed. The m ethod uses tim e variable isochrones, such as that the runoff h y d ro g rap h positively responds to tem poral changes in rainfall intensity. The m ethod uses a

kinem atic-based travel tim e scheme, w hich im proves existing isochrone extraction techniques. A raster grid is discretizes an d supports rainfall and runoff sim ulations in a m odular distributed m odel. A DEM w as used to

extract values of g round slope, flow direction, and flow accum ulation m aps to characterize the terrain. The isochrone time series constituted the travel time for runoff hydrographs. The new algorithm s generated by this m odel that re defined traditional tim e-area/rainfall-nm off techniques to a distributed terrainhydraulic based m ethodology. Thus, because the m odel is developed on

variable isochrones, stationary constraints are relaxed.

Since there is extensive literature, several m ore readings regarding GIS and w atershed m odelling are recom m ended: M ason and M aidm ent (2000),

M elancon et al. (1999), an d Gao et al. in M aidm ent (1993). It was found that there w as a lack of literature regarding the discretization of the w atersheds using GIS in term s of grid m odelling. W hile studies dem onstrating lum ped and clustered m odeling w ere readily available, there w as a lack of grid m odel literature. This m ay be because of the large database and advanced com puting pow er needed in order to do so. W hile m any authors recom m ended that the discretization of w atersheds is the best w ay to observed landuse and spatial influences, in m ost cases, clustered (subw atershed) m odels w as deem ed suitable.

Rainfall Krîging

Interpolation in GIS assum es th at the distance or direction betw een sam ple points reflect som e kind of spatial correlation that can, in turn; explain variations in a surface (Burrough and McDonnell, 1998; ESRI, 2002b). Similar to inverse distance w eighting, kriging w eights surrounding m easurem ents to predict a value for an un m easu red area. In other w ords, kriging is sim ply a surface interpolation teclmique that utilizes a statistical m ethod of variance to form an estim ate for a particular location (Vieux, 2001; ESRI, 2002b and Kirvoruchko, 2001).

Developed by M atheron Krig the general form ula for is w ritten:

i-I

w here Z (si) is th e m easured value at ith location, À ,i is an unk n o w n w eight for the m easured value at ith location, and So is the predicted location, and N is the num ber of values.

Kriging has tw o hypotheses: 1) the m ean is constant th ro u g h o u t the region (Table 4), and 2) variance of differences is in dependent of position, b u t depends on separation (Figure 7) (Vieux, 2001 and ESRI 2002a). If the first does n o t occur, then a trend exists and m ust be rem oved. The second suggests that a variogram is determ ined for the data set; it m ay be used to estim ate the variance for the region.

For th is study, ordinary kriging w ill be u sed because it assum es th a t the constant m ean for all th e data m easurem ents is u n k n o w n (ESRI, 2002b). A com parison of several m odels of ordinary kriging ru n on three rainfall events can be view ed in A ppendix A. Since several of the rain gauges for this study are spatially distributed, kriging the rain gauge positions w ill pro d u ce layers of rainfall intensities. These layers can be hourly, daily, o r m onthly. The

values p ro d u ced by the layer can be re-ru n in the hydrologie m o d el developed by PCSWMM.

Barber et al. (1994) used the GIS sim ply as a display tool for the spatially referenced data characterizing the drainage w atershed. The conveyance

system capacities, design flows, and inadequacies w ere all displayed on the drainage schematic.

In 1994, SWMM was used to sim ulate the runoff and transport of storm w ater through a drainage netw ork for three w atersheds in Kansas City, M issouri. In m any cases, d ata preparation for SWMM in p u t param eters (e.g. soil, precipitation, and landuse calculations) is labour intensive. H ow ever, CIS w as used by Barber et al. (1994) to simplify the m anagem ent of data files required to ru n the SWMM model. A storm w ater m aster p lan was developed for the three Kansas City w atersheds using Intergraph M icrostation and an O racle database. A M icrostation D evelopm ent Language (MDL) application w as developed b y Black & Veatch to integrate the inform ation from the GIS creating the data files necessary to perform the hydrologie and hydraulic analyses of SWMM.

SWMM and GIS have also been linked to ecological assessm ents. In this case, sub-estuaries (both natural and conduit channels) draining a m ostly urbanized w atershed th at w ere contributing to Bayou Chico in Escambia C ounty, Florida, w ere m odelled for ev en t and d ry w eather flows to determ ine the contribution of pollution into the bayou.

1. T h e R eesor C reek W atershed

The D uffins Creek w atershed is one of the healthiest w atersheds in the GTA and consists of eleven subw atersheds (Figure 10). Located in so uthern O ntario and bordering the tow nships of Pickering, StouffviUe, U xbridge, M arkham , and Ajax, D uffins Creek drains approxim ately 285km^ of land and m eanders from the O ak Ridges M oraine to the shoreline of Lake O ntario (Figure 11). The M oraine provides an abundance of groundw ater into the w atershed an d its stream s are habitat for speckled tro u t (TRCA, 2002a).

D ue to econom ic and developm ent pressures, the TRCA has recom m ended that a m anagem ent strategy for the D uffins w atershed is n eeded in order to ensure th a t its resources are protected an d preserved. T he follow ing is a list of the issues identified by the TRCA (2002a) th a t are currently affecting the D uffins Creek w atershed:

The GTA has seen several flooding disasters (e.g. H u rrican e H azel--1954). The resu lt has been a storm w ater initiative th a t has heavily m onitored GTA w atersh ed 's including ongoing m easurem ents of precipitation, stream flow, and snow pack melt. Since 1965, governm ents and conservation authorities have actively m onitored the Duffins Creek w atersh ed in o rder to characterize the attributes of the D uffins drainage system . The m onitoring stu d y 's w ere prim arily established to gather background hydrologie d ata that w ould guide

For exam ple, on M ay 13, 2000, a 50 to 60 m m rainfall ev en t occu rred w ithin the D uffins C reek W atershed. Because D uffins C reek is prim arily rural, it took approxim ately 13 h o u rs to peak w ith flow s ran g in g from 5 to 83mYs from the start u n til p eak d ischarge (TRCA, 2002b). In com parison, an u rb a n w atershed such as the D on R iver (approxim ately 20km w est the D uffins Creek w atershed) p eak e d in approxim ately 4 to 5 h o u rs w ith d o u b le the flows of D uffins C reek (TRCA, 2002b). It sh o u ld be n o ted th a t both w atersh ed s are sim ilar in bo th size and shape.

In an o th er exam ple, w hile the discharge of w ater m ay b e g reater in an u rb an ized w atershed, also affected is th e baseflow . For instance, the an n u al flow of H ig h lan d C reek --a p red o m in ately u rb an iz ed w atersh ed and

im m ediately w e st--w as com pared to th e D uffins C reek. The D uffins C reek w atersh ed infiltrated precipitation th a t w o u ld eventually becom e stream flow an d disp lay ed a greater stream flow volum e, w hile th e H ig h lan d Creek w atersh ed exhibited less stream flow, since th e w atersh ed is approxim ately 85 percent im pervious. R unoff in this 1991 case is im m ediate and stream flow is low er because of storm sew er diversions an d a lack of in filtrated p recipitation of recharge baseflow s (TRCA, 2002b).

W hile the D uffins C reek w atershed will n o t be m odelled in this study, the p revious discussion identifies som e of th e critical issues and characteristics th at p erta in to it --and in turn, to the R eesor C reek w atershed.

characteristics of the Reesor w atershed consist of forest, m eadow , w etland, and federal g o v ern m en t ow ned green space. Table 7 sum m arizes the total area of each landuse.

As stated previously, the D uffins C reek w atersh ed is p rim arily rural, w here less th an 1/3 has been developed. W hile the R eesor C reek w atershed is

sm aller, an d has sim ilar landuse, it w as considered a good represen tation of the D uffins C reek d rain ag e netw ork. In term s of calibration, the Reesor

In total, thirteen stations were chosen for this study. Three of these stations (M arkham, Bedford, and Kimberly) w ere installed for research purposes (M arkham) or ow ned and m aintained for continuous m onitoring by the City of Toronto (Bedford and Kimberly). The other ten gauges were ow ned and

operated by E nvironm ent C anada's A tm ospheric Environm ent Service (AES). All of the AES stations w ere recorded in m m /day.

The rain gauges chosen for tliis study represent approxim ately 5000 km^. The area is delineated w ith U dora in the north, Kimberly in the south, Bedford to the west, and Pontypool in the east (Figure 14). Each station varied

significantly in time-series length and d ataset com pleteness. For this study. May to N ovem ber 1999 w as chosen because it was the only time-series that w as mostly com plete (full data set) at all thirteen stations. It should be noted that Pontypool and Tyrone have significant data gaps in the m onths of M ay/June and N ovem ber respectively (Table 9).

PCSWMM 2002 GIS

The USEPA's SWMM w as developed b etw een 1969 and 1971 an d has seen m any am endm ents since then (Table 3, C hapter 2) (James and James, 2000). In 1993, the CHI redesigned the SWMM program as a W indow s based program to be u sed on personal com puters (PC) by hydrologie m o d ellers--hence the nam e PCSWMM. Today, SWMM is the m o st w idely u sed storm w ater

m odelling program and its W indow s based interface as PCSWMM, m akes it a very user-friendly application. Recently, the release of PCSWMM 5 by the

USEPA is also W indow s based, how ever, it w as n o t available d u rin g this study. PCSWMM was used to m odel the hydrologie com ponents of the Reesor Creek w atershed.

The stand-alone GIS pro v id ed in PCSWMM accom m odates basic CIS needs, b u t it lacks the advanced analysis tools and overlay capabilities that ArcGIS provides. This is w hy PCSWMM is being u sed as a hydrologie m odeller and file exporter for this study. In other w ords, th e GIS application in PCSWMM GIS 2002 w as n o t used because it d id n o t p ro v id e the functionality n eeded for this study.

4. GIS Data Layer Development

The base GIS data layers used in this stu d y w ere developed by the TRCA and DMTI Spatial and were available through Ryerson U niversity's G eography D epartm ent. ASCII digital elevation m odel layers in 30-metre resolution and UTM coordinates were prepared by DMTI Spatial, w hile all other layers pertaining to the Duffins Creek w atershed w ere prepared by the TRCA. Flow charts are used in this section in order to sum m arize and clarify the steps taken to develop the layers and data needed for this study.

All layers and data frames used in ArcM ap w ere set to the following coordinate system; UTM NAD 1983 zone 17N. The follow ing is a list of the m ap sheets/D EM layers used in this study below; the orientation of these sheets can be seen in Figure 11 (see C hapter 3).

The ArcToolBox application was used to convert th e ASCII text DEM 's prep ared by DMTI into ArcGrid form at (raster layers) using the conversion tool. The in p u t ASCII file location w as chosen an d the o u tp u t file was given a

Unlike the DEM layers, the Duffins Creek w atershed layer w as sim ply given the app ro p riate coordinate system and legend identifiers (e.g. colour

categorized land use). From the Duffins Creek data set, this study used the landuse, soil type, road netw ork, river and stream netw ork, subw atersheds, and stream gauging station layers.

The Reesor Creek w atershed is located in the n orthw est com er of the Duffins Creek w atershed. extracted from The layers for Reesor Creek needed to be mechanically the Duffins Creek layers. Using the Duffins Creek

subw atershed layer, the appropriate subw atersheds draining Reesor Creek w ere selected. The selected sub w atersheds were labelled 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Figure 18).

As stated previously, p a rt of sub w atershed 4 w as dow n stream of the gauging station 02HC039 and did n o t contribute any flow. This area w as rem oved in order to correctly calculate the area of polygons. The delineation of the Reesor Creek drainage system w as determ ined using the HEC-Geo HMS extension.

D uring the tim e of this study, D arren Sutton, a graduate stu d en t of the R yerson U niversity G eography D epartm ent had prepared the in p u t d ata of the D uffins C reek w atershed for use in the HEC-Geo HMS m odel. Sim ply put, elevations, w atershed boundaries, and the stream netw ork w ere properly form atted for use. The HEC-Geo HMS extension provided a w atershed

delineation tool, w hich w as used to select a p o in t in a w atershed, and the extension delineated the total area that drains to the point. In this case, station 02HC039 w as the outlet point for the Reesor Creek w atershed and the HECGeo HM S delineated the total area that drained to this gauge.

The area w as then exported as a layer file, and overlaid on the Reesor Creek subw atershed layer and the sub w atershed layer w as clipped to the shape of the HEC-Geo HM S delineation layer. O ther layer attributes such as landuse, roads, stream netw ork, and soil type w ere also clipped to the boundaries of the new Reesor Creek subw atershed boundaries (Figure 18).

A t this point, a layer depicting the location of the rain gauges needed to be developed. This process w as sim ply done by using the spatial analyst extension of ArcM ap. The raster layers w ere converted into p oint feature layers w here each nixel of the raster layer w as converted into a p o in t (Figure 19).

W ith the new p o in t layers developed, the approxim ate area of the rain gauges was determ ined u sing their UTM coordinates to select the closest (. m t. The selected p o in t w as then saved as a layer file an d given the station nam e. This process w as c o n d u c te d for all 13 stations.

The result w as fifty-four virtual rain gauges (Figure 23), each gauge being characteristic of its applicable cell. It should be n o ted th at the size of the grid is u ser defined. For this study, the 1 km^ g rid w as chosen because of its com patibility w ith the A rcM ap project layer coordinates and because the extent of the w atersh ed w as small (approxim ately 35 km^).

W ith assistance from M ichael M acD onald --a GIS specialist at Ryerson U niversity, the grid w as designed to cover approxim ately 1700 km^--far greater than the area of b o th the R eesor and D uffins C reek w atersheds. Once the g rid w as orien tated above the Reesor w atershed, the centroids w ere calculated using the VB script. The script term ed get_centroid w as applied

using A rcM ap's m acro option (Figure 24). The script w as retrieved from the ESRI s u p p o rt d o w n lo ad s w here m inor custom ization revisions w ere m ade (w w w .esri.com ). The VB script can be view ed in A ppendix F.

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

Before the macro can be run, it m u st be properly set u p in the table of contents view. In this case, the grid m u st be positioned as the first layer in the table of contents, im m ediately after the grid layer, a point layer (e.g. one of the rain gauge layers) needs to be positioned underneath. W hen the m acro is run, the p o in t layer is used as a reference layer for the grid centroid calculations. U nfortunately, once the centroids have been tabulated, the new layer will also include the reference points. These points can be rem oved easily by using the selection tool via an editing session and directly from the attribute table.

All non-applicable grid cells and centroids needed to be rem oved th at did not intersect the Reesor Creek w atershed boundaries in o rder to calculate new polygon areas and new rainfall values. This w as done by using the select by location tool to select the grid cells th at intersect the Reesor Creek w atershed boundaries and the centroids that intersect the new grid. In each case, a new layer w as created from the selected features respectively. It w as necessary to select the centroids in context w ith the new grid layer because several rain gauges are not contained by the Reesor Creek w atershed boundaries.

It is im perative that the centroids n o t in the Reesor Creek w atershed boundaries be "selected based on the new grid layer (centroids located just outside the w atershed). This is because some of tire virtual gauges contribute rainfall values to only small parcels of the w atershed (e.g. grid cell 53) (A ppendix G).

84

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

A m acro term ed rasterjoin was used to assign a predicted rainfall value to the new gauges (Figure 25). Similar to the previous VB script, the original script w as dow nloaded from the ESRI su p p o rt site and custom ization was contributed by Ryerson's CIS specialist. The script can be seen in A ppendix F.

Sim ilar to the get_centroid macro, the rnster_join m acro m u st have the gauge layer at the top of the A rcM ap table of contents and im m ediately below it, a kriged rainfall layer. It should also be noted that the virtual rain gauge layer should not have a rainfall colum n in the attribute tab le--the m acro will create one. Once the appropriate layers are organized, the rasterJo in m acro w as run. W hen com plete, the new layer should be exported and nam ed the applicable d ate of rainfall (e.g. Sept_6_grid_rain). This process was com pleted for each day which rainfall o ccu rred --or better still--for each kriged rainfall raster layer. In o rder to confirm th at the macro w orked, the virtual rain gauge

attribute table was left open at all times to observe the addition of a rainfall column. This is necessary, because im m ediately after each layer export the rainfall colum n in the original virtual rain gauge layer needs to be deleted. As stated above, every tim e the rasterJoin macro is run, a new rainfall colum n w ith the new rainfall values is created (A ppendix H). In the end, each virtual rainfall layer was exported and organized in to a tim e series that w as used in PCSWMM.

A t this point, once all of the layers have been developed and a single layer w as created depicting the soil type, landuse, and the v irtual rain gauges. A rcM ap's geoprocessing wizard, th e grid layer needs to be intersected w ith the landuse/soil ty p e layer. This intersection w as necessary in o rder to rem ove all of the grid cell lines th a t occur outside of the Reesor Creek w atershed boundaries, w hich in turn, is necessary for area calculations discussed later in this section.

Joining th e layers com bined all of the attributes in the previous layers and created one layer that has a cell/gauge identifier attached to it. This w as done b y using the join tool found in the table of contents of ArcM ap. The join

included th e following; 1) the virtual rain gauge layer (use tem plate, no rainfall values) to join to the landuse/soil type/grid layer, 2) join points to polygons, w here each polygon w as all the attribute of the p o in t th at is closest to the polygon b oundary, (final_landuse). and 3) the layer w as given a unique identifier

The join process com bined w ith the intersection of the landuse/soil type/grid layer sim ply gave each polygon in each grid cell a cell and virtual rain gauge value. The cell/gauge identifier is necessary for ru n n in g PCSWMM in order to ru n the characteristics of each cell separately.

C onfirm ation if the join w as successful w as sim ply done by opening the attribute table and selecting sim ilar gauge attributes. This was done by using th e select by attributes tool and choosing only one cell/gauge attribute (e.g. cell 10) (Figure 26).

As stated in Table 3 (C hapter 2), over the years SW M M has h ad several versions th a t have im proved th e SWMM program . In PCSW M M, each version is available for m odelling. For this study, the SWMM engine 4.4h w as used. Prior to startin g the PCSWMM m odelling, A rcM ap w as u sed to develop an attrib u te table (previously discussed) of the Reesor w atersh ed representing the soil type, landuse, im perviousness, and area. The d ata w as used to determ ine m any of the param eters of th e PCSWMM in p u t files. Table 12 lists som e of

the run, p rint, and precipitation controls that w ere used in all three m odels. It should be noted that Table 12 does n o t represent a com plete and w orking in p u t file for PCSWMM. C om plete in p u t files can be observed in A ppendix I.

There are several key param eters used in the PCSWMM in p u t files th at should be discussed as to w hy they w ere chosen for this study. These param eters include ISNOW, INFILM, KWALTY, IVAP, and IVCHAN.

ISN O W --This param eter sim ulates snowm elt. ISNOW w as not u se d since the precipitation data occurred d uring non-w inter m onths from M ay 1=` to N ovem ber 30*, 1999.

IN FILM --This param eter recognizes the type of infiltration sim ulation that will be used in the runoff model. equation-- it is expressed: This stu d y u sed Horton's Infiltration

fp = fc + (fo - fc)

e'* * *

7.0

W here (fp) is the infiltration capacity into soil, m m /sec; (fc) is the m inim um or ultim ate value of fp (WLMIN) in mm/sec; (fo) is the m axim um or initial value of (fp) (WLMAX), mm/sec; (t) is the tim e from beginning of storm in seconds; and (k) is the decay coefficient (DECAY) in sec-1. The equation w as originally developed to depict the reduction of a w atersheds infiltration capacity in the presence of s u r c e m oisture. The H orton equation w as chosen for several

reasons, the first is because it is the m ost weU know an d accepted of several infiltration equations (H uber and Dickinson, 1992; James and James, 2000; Viessman et al., 1989; Elliot and W ard, 1995; and Kim et al., 1999). The second reason w as because PCSWMM used an integrated form of the equation that com pensates for the reduced loss of soil infiltration capacity w hen a light rainfall occurs (Nix, 1994).

KWALTY--This param eter is used to m odel w ater q u alit)\ This param eter w as not u sed because the stu d y w as intending to m odel runoff flow and volum e.

rV AP--All PCSWMM

engines

included

evaporation m odelling.

This For

param eter identifies h ow evaporation will be included in the m odel.

example, if m easured data is available, it can be entered as units p er day or m onth. W hile lake evaporation data for Lake O ntario w as available, it w as n o t representative of the Reesor w atershed. Tlrerefore, the PCSWMM default rate of 3 m illim etres p er day was used for this study.

TVCHAN--This param eter om its or includes channel evaporation. IVCHAN w as included because the entire Reesor Creek netw ork is open.

For all PCSWMM m odels, the input file E and H lines w ere created on a spreadsheet. The in p u t file w as then exported as a text file and pasted into PCSWMM.

7. L um ped M odel

The lu m p ed m odel ru n in PCSWMM consisted of all four subw atersheds of the Reesor Creek w atershed com bined into one large w atershed. Param eters w ere based on majority characteristics of the w atershed. For instance. Table 13

Also at this point, the virtu al rain gauge identifiers n eeded to be adjusted-- because PCSWMM dislikes using O's as a label and one of the gauges w as labelled 0.

10. Flow D u ra tio n C urve

A flow d u ratio n curve plots the cum ulative frequency of discharge, th a t is, discharge as a function of the percentage of the tim e th at the discharge is exceeded. It is n o t considered a probability curve, because the discharge is correlated betw een successive tim e intervals and discharge characteristics are d ep en d en t on season of year (W ard and Robinson, 1990).

The flow d u ratio n curve is useful is predicting the availability an d variability of sustained flows an d identify the effects of im perviousness on a w atershed (V iessm an et al., 1989)

To hydrologists, FDC's are com m only u sed in m odelling like h y d ro g rap h s an d m ass curves (Yu an d Yang, 1996). W hile w idely k n o w and u sed, there is little resources reg ard in g their stu d y (Cigizoglu an d Bayazit, 2000).

Sm akhtin, e t al. (1998) used FDC's to stu d y the characterize a stream 's low flow regim e m South Africa, w here observed stream flow records .were insufficient, and low -flow characteristics w ere n eeded to estim ate from sim ulated daily stream flow time-series. The m odel conceptualized low -flow generation m echanism s and surface-subsurface interactions ad eq u ately w here th e ability of the m odel to sim ulate low-flow regim es was assessed by m eans of various low -flow analysis techniques.

U nfortunately, the reason for the lack of m easurem ents cannot be confirm ed as to w hy th ey w ere 0. There w as also a very significant difference w ith the C h erry w o o d gauge (-74.6 percentage difference). The C h erry w o o d gauge is located approxim ately 17 k m from Stouffville an d one w ould assum e that th ere w o u ld be a strong correlation b etw een the two. It w a s n 't until the

com pletion of the stu d y w as it discovered th at the C herryw ood gauge w as p oorly m ain tain ed . W hile m any of the rainfall m easu rem en t dates (in term s of occurrences) are sim ilar to Stouffville, th e m easu red v o lu m e at the

Cherry-wood gauge is m uch less than the Stouffville gauge. This w o u ld cause PCSW M M to generate less runoff volum e an d thus, increase th e percentage difference.

2. C lu ste red M o d el

The su b w atersh ed m odel w as sim ilar to the lu m p ed m odel in term s of p ercentage difference (Table 17). In m ost cases the percentage difference

increased b etw een the lu m p ed m odel an d the subw atershed m odel. This is m ost likely because of th e discretization of the lu m p ed w atersh ed into four su b w atersh ed s (1 to 4). H ow ever, percentage differences at M arkham and

P on ty p o o l decreased. For this m odel, th e param eters for area, im perviousness, an d average w id th w ere adjusted accordingly for each subw atershed. The

resu lt w as a 3.2 percentage increase in percentage difference from the lu m ped Stouffville calibration m odel. W hile m in o r adjustm ents in all three p aram eters could h a v e been done, it w as p referred n o t to do so in o rd er to keep the m odel consistent w ith the lu m p ed m odel. In other w ords, the percentage

im perviousness an d area calculations w ere sim ilar in b o th m odels, suggesting th a t discretization can introduce volum e differences.

Grid M odel

A sum m ary of the association of the virtu al rain gauges, the inlet dum m y pipe, the landuse, and the total runoff fiom each pipe can be view ed in Table 20. Tables 21 and 22 sum m arize the total runoff volum e generated by PCSWMM for the lum ped, subw atershed, and the grid m odels for the m onth of Septem ber 1999. The tables have two parts; the first is a com parison of the PCSWMM runoff generated by each rain gauge an d the 02HC039 runoff for the m onth of September, 1999. The second p a rt is a com parison of the A

02HC039 volum e and the PCSWMM generated volum e for the grid. com parison of the grid m odel w ith 02HC039 is m ade in Table 21 and 22.

There are several key characteristics th at w ere noticed in the results. The first is the change in percentage difference for the Stouffville m easurem ents. In b o th the lu m p ed and subw atershed m odels, the difference generally increased. In several cases the percentage difference im proved. This is m ost likely

because of the increase in discretization, where, the im proved differences m ay be largely a direct resu lt of the kriging.

The second observation was the average percentage difference betw een all of the gauges. In both cases (the lum ped and sub w atersheds), the average

percentage difference for all of the gauges im proved. This is because m any of the erroneous volum es produced by the individual gauge runs th a t w ere in po o r correlation in term s of rainfall volum e (e.g. C herryw ood, Bowmanville, O shaw a) w ere vastly im proved using the grid approach. O n the other hand, som e of the better m atches using the tru e rainfall values from the original 13 gauges (e.g. M arkham ) became w orse u sing the g rid m ethod.

In C h ap ter 5, the results from th e lum ped, clustered,, an d g rid m o delling w as described. In this chapter, the results are discussed in d ep th w ith elaboration an d em phasis on significant observations.

1.

L u m p ed M o d el

In Table 16, it w as noticed th at the C herryw ood station h a d the highest percentage difference, despite it being the closest rain gauge to Stouffville (17 km). O ne w o u ld assum e th a t the sets of m odelled results w o u ld be sim ilar because of their location to one another; how ever the difference m ay have been a result of m easu rem en t error, im p ro p er m aintenance, an d n a tu ra l / stru ctural influence (e.g. elevated topography). G enerally, m ost of the g auges correlated w ith th e Stouffville gauge from average to w ell (0.6 to 0.9 respectively). Two of the stations (Pontypool an d Tyrone) h ad gaps in th e data set (Table 9). In bo th cases, th e P ontypool an d Tyrone m easured significantly less rainfall (greater th an 100mm) than the Stouffville gauge. The low er rainfall volum e generated far less runoff in the PCSWMM environm ent. This is w hy both

P ontypool an d T yrone generated sm aller flows than the m easu red flow at 02HC039.

In m ost cases (except Janetville an d Pontypool), the percentage difference was greater than 15 percent. Several of these gauges h ad a reasonably good H ow ever,

correlation w ith the rainfall m easu red at the Stouffville station.

d espite a m o d erate correlation betw een som e gauges, it is the volum e differences th a t contributed to m ost of the differences. For exam ple, since

PCSW M M is precipitation driven, th e larger o r sm aller a m easu red value is in context w ith the Stouffville m easurem ents, the runoff vo lu m e generated by PCSW M M w ill reflect the volum e of th e m easured rainfall. This response is fu rth er discussed in Section 6 of this C hapter using B uttonville as an exam ple.

It w as observed that there w as no relationship betw een the spatial distribution of the rain gauge netw ork and its correlation w ith the Stouffville (Figure 35, Section 6).

2. C lu stered M odel

The observations and discussion in the clustered m odel are very sim ilar to the lum ped m odel (Figure 31). H ow ever, the trend observed w as that the

clustered m odel generally increased the percentage difference w ith the discretization of the Reesor Creek w atershed. W hile the rainfall u sed in the clustered m odel was the sam e as the rainfall u sed in the lu m p ed m odel, the difference here was the param eter adjustm ents u sed to represent

subw atersheds 1, 2, 3, and 4. The differing param eters can be view ed in Table 14 (C hapter 4). In this case area, average w idth, and percentage im pervious w ere calculated, and unlike the lum ped m odel w here each param eter represented the total area (e.g. percentage im pervious). For exam ple, the

percent im perviousness for the lu m p ed w atershed w as 8.41%, w hile the clu ster-à m odel was 10, 15, 2 and 2 percent for subw atersheds 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Changes in im perviousness contribute significantly in the

generation of runoff in PCSWMM since the SWMM engine is very sensitive to changes in this param eter (Section 6, Figure 37).

The changes in catchm ent area and w id th are also sensitive param eters in the SWMM engine th at can increase or decrease the volum e of runoff generated by PCSWMM (Figure 32). N onetheless, for this stu d y the square root of the

subw atershed w as used to represent the average w idth, an d the percentage difference m ay have been im proved if changes in the average area d u rin g the calibration runs w as conducted.

G rid M odel

The g rid m odel discretized the Reesor Creek w atershed into Ikm^ grid cells. O bservations concluded that the grid m odel w hen com pared to the lum ped, clustered, and gauge 02HC039 increased the percentage difference. Similar to the discussion for the clustered m odel above, the discretization of the w atershed and changes in the PCSWMM param eters of percent

im perviousness, area, and average w idth are w hat contributed to the differences. W hile this is not necessarily incorrect, since one w ould assum e that the m ore discrete a model and its database is the more, so to should its percentage difference. This observation can be seen in Figure 33.

4.

Seasonal M odel

The o u tstanding observation for this model was the drastic increase in percentage difference in the sum m er m odel. Because PCSWMM is best suited for u rb an w atersheds, the rural landscape of Reesor Creek m ay be the reason for the differences. D uring the dry sum m er m onths the soil will dry out and increase soil m oisture storage, therefore, d uring a storm event, rainfall is used up as soil recharge and retained as pervious depressions storage and not im m ediate runoff.

Figure 33. A Com parison of th e percentage differences of the lum ped, clustered, and grid models.

As stated in C hapter 5, the fall m odel generally underestim ated flows. This may be because the fall is generally a w et time of year w ith frequent rainfall events. W ith the soil recharged, little infiltration will occur. The result can be overland flow that directly discharges to Reesor C reek as ru n o ff--thus, increasing runoff volum es. The condition of the w atershed in the fall was N onetheless, PCSWMM still

sim ilar to pavem ent or im perm eable surfaces.

underestim ates the true m easured volum e because the percent im pervious runoff is m uch less than the contributions of the entire w atershed as groundw ater flow and overland runoff.

5.

Flow D u ratio n C urve

As depicted in Figure 29 (Chapter 5) the com m on trend noticed w as that all plots depicted a flow exceedence no greater than 2 mVs w here the probability of exceedence is a low 20 percent. This suggests that even d u rin g heavy storm events, there is significant risk of exceeding this low flow rate. This is m ost likely because the rural environm ent (low im perviousness) com bined w ith the loam soils may result in less runoff because of infiltration and w atershed groundw ater recharge.

Also, Figure 30 (Chapter 5) changes in percent im pervious for the lum ped model was increased from 8 to 50 percent. The result is a larger flow This w ould

exceedence, b u t there w as very little change of probability.

suggest that increases in developm ent to the Reesor Creek w atershed w ould drastically affect runoff quantity and increase stream volum es. Surge or flash effects on the natural w atercourse can flood dow nstream if the flow

exceedence volum e is greater than the bank full discharge. Just to recall one of the concerns of the TRCA (stated in C hapter 3), w as the proposed

d evelopm ent for Duffins Creek and in turn Reesor Creek could generate flooding and changes to natural baseflow s and w atercourses if developm ent follows through.

6. M o d el E valuation

O ne w o u ld assum e that a strong correlation betw een m easured rainfall volum es w ould generate sim ilar runoff volum es in PCSWMM. It was

observed that this was not the case. For example, Figure 34 is an exam ple of a strong correlation of rainfall generating a large volum etric difference in PCSWMM. In this case, the Buttonville A irport and the Stouffville rain gauge h ad a correlation of 0.868. H ow ever, the percentage difference in volum e was -28.2 percent.

129

This w as because d u rin g several storm events, the Stouffville gauge m easu red a larger precip itatio n value. A larger flow generated by PCSW M M. This

observation is significant because it identifies tw o things: 1) rainfall is spatially variable, an d 2) decision m aking m odels generated u sin g rain gauges from o u tsid e the w atersh ed b o u n d aries or a single g au g e for a large w atersh ed s on their ow n, m ay n o t truly rep resen t runoff using SWMM as a pred ictio n tool.

The first p o in t is further su p p o rted w hen the correlation values are plotted against the distance from the Stouffville gauge (Figure 35). In this case,

observations suggested th at there is no relationship betw een the stren g th of the correlation w ith the calibration gauge (Stouffville) and the distance from it. This po o r relationship m ay also be a direct resu lt of the po o r rainfall m easurem ents, lack of m aintenance on the rain gauge, or lost data. It is

recom m ended th a t future studies confirm rainfall d ata accuracy before this assu m p tio n can be m ade.

The regression values for all of the v irtual rain g au g e correlated to the Stouffville gauge. The high values (average 0.9694) are a direct resu lt of the kriging. Tliis is because the values w ere w eighted u sin g th e Stouffville gauge d u rin g the kriging process. Tlie closeness of the v irtual rain gauges to the

Stouffville gauge generated the strong correlation (Table 24).

This observation is significant since it suggests th a t all of the rainfall that occurred in the Reesor C reek w atershed bo u n d aries is uniform ly distributed and th at rainfall values only "tap er off" g radually w ith distance. This is not alw ays the case in reality. For instance. Figure 36 depicts a hypothetical

scenario w here rainfall values bordering a w atershed have a high correlation. Fiowever, a single m easurem ent taken in the m iddle of the area is m uch lower. The resu lt w ould be a predicted layer that is reflective of all the m easurem ents and includes the m iddle values. This is inferred to th e relationship betw een the Stouffville gauge and the C herryw ood gauge (poor correlation 0.128) (Figure 36).

Conversely, if the m iddle value w as n o t m easured or if the topography had a high elevation, then the prediction w ould be significantly different. In this

case, the predicted value w ould be reflective of the gauges bo rd erin g it. This o bservation w o u ld also contribute significant p ercentage differences in generated SWMM runoff.

As Stated previously. V ieux (2001) stated th a t considering the attributes of param eters an d p recipitation controlling hydrologie processes, it is n o t su rp risin g th a t CIS h av e becom e a n integral p a rt of hydrologie studies. In the past, th e difficulties in m anaging a n d efficiently using spatial inform ation have p ro m p ted hydrologists to reso rt to lu m p ed m odels to develop technology for m anaging the data.

Because of the vast am o u n t of d ata th a t is generated w ith a clustered o r grid m odels, the m o d el can be discretized to observe th e effects of developm ent change (e.g. p av in g an d construction). Figure 37 depicts the above by

C onclusions

Below is a list of the key conclusions m ade for this research. discussion follows to elaborate several of these points.

A short

GIS w as useful in generating the landuse, soil type, an d rainfall attributes for use in PCSWMM. K riging rainfall does accurately predict rainfall at u n g auged (virtual) sites only u n d er the following conditions: 1) All neighbouring stations m u st hav e a good correlation, and 2) stations m easuring low er values th an neighbouring stations should be confirm ed for errors in m easurem ents or other systematic influence. The m ethodology outlined in this study does contribute u n d erstan d in g the effect of spatial distribution on rainfall. to

Rainfall variance is independent of distance. Rainfall variability does occur w ith spatial location. A strong correlation betw een m easured rainfall values does not confirm a strong relationship w ith generated runoff. # Changes in percentage im perviousness of a w atershed will affect m odelled runoff. D isaggregating a w atershed does induce differences, how ever, calibration of som e w atershed m odelling param eters can lim it this (e.g. w atershed w idth). Seasonal variability does affect hydrologie m odelling results.

As a m ethodological p "otocol, this study is uniquely applicable to rainfallrunoff analysis using PCSWMM and ArcGIS software. Integration of data file exchange was a critical link for this study. In this case, attribute tables for soil, landuse, and v irtual rainfall w ere generated by ArcM ap an d analyzed to develop the param eters for the in p u t files for PCSWMM.

PCSWMM and ArcGIS w ere chosen because of th eir relative popularity w ith m ost professionals. The steps outlined in this stu d y can be custom ized and

applied by others to n o t only generate discretized runoff volum e, b u t to im prove u p o n the variability of spatially distributed rainfall m easurem ents.

This study also observed the effects of disaggregating a w atersh ed based on lum ped, subw atershed, seasonal, and g rid models. Three of the four m odels did generate a reasonable w ater balance over the full time-series; how ever, a longer tim e-series w ould m ost likely generate a better representation of the w atershed. For instance, results found in this stu d y d id n o t generate a good w ater balance for the sum m er m onths (-1.4 to 182.3 percentage difference lum ped model). This is because PCSWMM generates flow usually w ith short lag time, characteristic of an urban w atershed. In u rban environm ents, runoff has a shorter lag time, and PCSWMM takes this into consideration w hen generating flow. H ow ever, since m ost of Reesor Creek is pervious, during the dry su m m er m onths the soil will dry out and increase soil m oisture storage. The resu lt du rin g storm events is a soil m oisture recharge (first) and not runoff.

On the other hand, the results th at w ere generated d u rin g the fall m onths did low er the range of percentage difference (-8.6 to -92.8 lu m p ed model), how ever, PCSWMM in all cases underestim ated flow. This m ight be because fall is generally a w et tim e of year w ith frequent rainfall events. W ith the soil being recharged, infiltration rates are low ered. The result can be overland flow that directly discharges to Reesor Creek as ru n o ff--far w ith little or no depression storage in the pervious area (w hich is the majority).

H ow ever, PCSWMM is better suited for a w atershed in this condition because saturated soils are sim ilar to pavem ent or im perm eable surfaces. N onetheless,

138

PCSWMM still underestim ated the tru e m easured volum e because the percentage im pervious runoff is m uch less than the contributions of the entire w atershed as groundw ater flow and overland runoff.

It w ould appear that the discretization of the w atershed d id introduce volum etric differences into the m odels. The increase in data and param eters from lu m p ed to grid scale m odelling m ost likely became m ore representative of reality and less like a single param eter m odel. W hen the generated flows using the Stouffville gauge (calibration gauge) are com pared, the percentage difference form lu m p ed to grid ranged from -8.3 to 0.8 percent., all of w hich are still good results in term s of a w ater balance (less than 10 percent difference).

The th ird objective guided observations to reflect the effects of spatial distribution on rainfall. In all cases, flow generated by PCSWMM did differ w hen u sin g different gauges outside of the w atershed. U sing the Stouffville gauge to calibrate the Reesor w atershed param eters of all four m odels, the rem aining 12 gauges w ere ru n in PCSWMM, and in each case, differences w ere introduced. Because PCSWMM is precipitation driven, if there is no rainfall, no flow is generated. The inverse will occur if it does rain. U sing kriging to im prove the rainfall values to generate v irtual rain gauges im proved the rainfall m easurem ents w ithin the w atershed. The virtual rainfall and rain

gauges are m ore representative of the precipitation falling on the Reesor w atershed. The kriged rainfall approach, w hile slightly time consum ing to

generate, low ered the percentage difference betw een spatially distributed rainfalls. It should be noted that even if the m odel is left as a lum ped

param eter m odel, an d only the virtual rainfall w as generated, the difference results still im proved.

This stu d y observed the effects of lum ped, clustered, an d gird m odelling. It also review ed the influence that spatial distribution has on rainfall. Together, the key objective w as com pleted--to dem onstrate a new m odelling technique using GIS and hydrologie m odelling in a w ater balance. The new technique w as to use the GIS to discretize both the rainfall an d w atershed attributes using kriging and a grid layer analysis. Results suggest th at the introduction of GIS to the m odelling did introduce differences; how ever, it was only because the m odel became m ore like reality, and less like a lum ped model. W hile this study is sim ply a protocol for further research, is does answ er the question how do space and time affected m odelling?

2. R ecom m endations

The follow ing outlines som e of the key recom m endations th a t w ould im prove future GIS-based hydrological analysis and serve as a guide for further research.

In term s of a w ater balance, a longer tim e series for both stream flow an d rainfall w ould have been preferred. A time series of approxim ately 1-year m inim um w ould im prove the observed effects of w inter snow m elt and antecedent conditions. Rainfall kriging should be conducted for a longer time-series (e.g. 6 m onths to 1 year) and it w ould be preferred to observe if the grid analysis becomes erroneous w ith time. To com plete all analysis w ithin the ArcGIS environm ent and lim it the exporting of attribute tables. Rem oving the Excel spreadsheet m edium could im prove errors (if applicable). To develop a script and look-up tables th a t could be u sed by PCSWMM to read the attribute tables developed by ArcM ap, w hich in turn, w o u ld adjust the param eters in the PCSWMM accordingly.

To confirm data accuracy p rio r to analysis (e.g. rain gauge m aintenance schedules, interview s, etc.). To dem onstrate the effectiveness of differing surface interpolation m ethods (e.g. Inverse D istance W eighting and other kriging options) on rainfall. To apply the kriging m odel to a m inim um of 50 gauges to im prove the values generated by the prediction layers. To assess the im portance of using only localized rainfall m easurem ents for PCSWMM m odels. The percentage differences generated depict the significant differences in a m odels prediction. To incorporate m easured evaporation and tem p eratu re data into PCSWMM rather than default param eters (e.g. evaporation 3 m illim etres per day).
