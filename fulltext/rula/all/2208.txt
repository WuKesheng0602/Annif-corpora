work has been performed on the characterization of such emulsions stabilized by soy protein isolate (SPI) and soy soluble polysaccharide (SSPS). This thesis focuses on the elucidation of the stability and how these apply to emulsions and their kinetic stability. 1.1 Colloids and interfaces between 1 and 1000 nm [1]. Due to their small size, colloids have a high surface-area-to-volume, making them susceptible to strong inter-particle forces. These forces can be attractive, such as Together, these dictate the properties of colloidal dispersions [2]. London-van der Waals forces, or they can be repulsive, such as electrostatic repulsion forces. Colloidal dispersions can be simple and consist of only two phases, such as clay particles in A colloid is a gas, liquid or solid dispersed throughout another substance with dimensions mechanism of soy-based protein-polysaccharide interactions and their role in oil-in-water emulsion formation and stability. The present chapter briefly highlights some of the fundamentals of colloid

Food-grade examples of such emulsions include mayonnaise, whipped cream, and examples include butter, margarine, and other tablespreads.

1.2.1 DLVO theory and its limitations stability of a colloidal dispersion depends on the total interaction potential close to the surface of interaction energy VR and the attractive London-van der Waals energy VA (Equation 1.1): Eqn. 1.1 The DLVO theory (named after Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek) states that the

Attractive forces predominate at large and small interparticle distances, resulting in minimum can promote loose, easily reversible flocculation if its magnitude is no greater than 10 kT. The primary minimum represents irreversibly flocculated particles after they have overcome the two energy minima: the secondary and primary minima, respectively. The secondary energy interparticle distance H0, whereas attractive London-van der Waals energy increases with Repulsive energy due to electrostatic repulsion increases exponentially with decreasing

primary energy maximum due to the repulsive interaction energy barrier (Vmax) (Fig. 1.1). This can occur if the particles approach each other with kinetic energies 15 kT. At intermediate and small interparticle distances known as Born distances, where electron clouds of molecules overlap, electric double layers (Fig. 1.2). Electrostatic repulsion, and therefore the energy barrier, depends repulsive forces dominate [1]. These forces are due to electrostatic repulsion between the particles' stability of colloidal systems by changing the ionic strength of the suspension [1, 2]. Increasing the 3 on electrolyte content while attraction energy remains constant [1]. This allows one to control the ionic strength of a suspension causes increased binding of counterions to the colloid surface which

When two particles or droplets approach each other, the interaction of the hydrophilic chains may cause structuring of the aqueous phase, resulting in a decrease in entropy. This results in a short-range,

Equation 1.2 accounts for the three main forces affecting the sedimentation or creaming of particles/droplets: gravity, friction, and sedimentation/creaming rates. This explains why flocculated and aggregated particles/droplets, buoyancy.

If the attraction energy is weak, particles/droplets energy maximum, they become permanently attached to one another (primary minimum).

In addition to flocculation due to random collisions, particles can also undergo bridging and

large polymers that have more than one binding site that can adsorb to particles/droplets surfaces,

such as proteins. The large polymers can thus bind to one particle/droplet at one binding site and particles/droplets [1, 10]. Bridging flocculation does not occur above a critical concentration of inter-protein binding. Depletion flocculation occurs when there are unadsorbed polymers in the protein where the droplets' interfaces are fully saturated, which leaves no room for additional continuous phase. This creates an osmotic gradient at the particles/droplets' surfaces because they system compared to a system containing no dispersed particles/droplets. When particles/droplets 7

The rates of flocculation and aggregation are determined by the volume fraction of the

However, this step is a required precursor to 1.3.3 Coalescence Stability against coalescence strongly depends on the properties of the adsorbed layer of surfactant(s) at the droplets' interface.

Thus, film thickness will decrease as the particles/droplets can approach each other more closely. Increasing the concentration of electrolytes also reduces film charge and causes a reduction in the effective ranges of their electrostatic double layers (Fig. 1.2).

Rupturing is caused by the formation of holes in the adsorbed surfactant layers above a critical diameter. The holes may form spontaneously (spontaneous film rupture) or be caused by external forces such as pressure or shear (induced film rupture) [5]. These forces cause the adsorbed layers to thin or stretch out, resulting in a higher probability of the formation of a hole.

Emulsifiers reduce the interfacial tension of droplets, allowing for the formation of smaller droplets but don't necessarily help in stabilizing the emulsion. Surfactants form an interfacial film that may have electrostatic or steric repulsion properties (such as with Emulsions are inherently thermodynamically unstable due to the immiscibility of the

adsorbed proteins or surface-active polysaccharides). The adsorbed layers may also form a strong mechanical layer around the droplets which can resist coalescence. Kinetic stability may also be improved by reducing the rate of sedimentation/creaming by decreasing the size of droplets, volume fraction will minimize inter-droplet collisions and thus flocculation [1, 17]. increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase, or reducing the difference in density between the dispersed phase and the continuous phase (Eqn. 1.2) [1, 5].

To effectively stabilize an emulsion, proteins must ideally provide complete droplet

treatment and processing. Exposing proteins to heating, high shear, high pressure, and treatment with extreme pH values may cause protein denaturation, which may result in the exposure of previously unexposed hydrophobic groups. Emulsification activity may be reduced if the exposure of hydrophobic groups increases inter-protein interaction or it may be improved if the newlyexposed hydrophobic groups improve binding between the protein and oil droplets [19-23]. Proteins may also be modified by various chemical treatments such as: acylation, alkylation, cross-linking with transglutaminase or digestion with enzymes such as proteases [24-26]. Proteins oxidation, phosphorylation, and deamidation, etc. as well as enzymatic methods such as covalent may also undergo surface denaturation after adsorption to an interface, as their conformation after unfavorable ones (e.g., contact with the oil and water phases, respectively). The rate of surface 14 adsorption changes so as to maximize the number of favorable interactions and minimize denaturation depends on the molecular flexibility of the protein with relatively flexible proteins,

wide-ranging use in food applications. However, the popularity and use of soybean proteins by food processors is increasing due to the drive to find healthier, vegetable-based alternatives [2, 27, 28]. The two major components of soybean proteins are -conglycinin (7S) and glycinin (11S) which with each one consisting of an acidic peptide approximately 40 kDa in weight and a basic peptide of

It is composed at least five different subunits, about 20 kDa in weight linked by a disulfide bridge [29]. Its structure, solubility, and functionality approximately 180 kDa and consists of three different subunits (, ', and , of 62, 65, and 47 kDa, respectively) [31].

hydrogen-bonding of water molecules minimizing hydrophobic contact with water, or it can break the structure of water and allow for an increase in the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, resulting in an increase in solubility (`salting in') [33].

It has been demonstrated that reducing the ionic strength of glycinin suspensions has a great impact on the protein's molecular structure. At pH 7.6 and at an ionic strength of 0.5 M, glycinin is mainly present in a hexameric form (11S, 360 kDa) but when the ionic strength is lowered to 0.01 M, it dissociates into mg/mL [36].

The isolated proteins show different thermal denaturation behaviour compared to mixed remain stable due to -conglycinin binding to the dissociated subunits of glycinin, thereby preventing its aggregation [37].

Generally, increasing the

Under controlled conditions, one can capabilities [19, 38], as when they are partially denatured, they have improved freeze-thaw stability and increased tolerance to salt [19, 45]. At sub-zero temperatures, native SPI undergoes thiol/disulfide exchange reactions to form high molecular weight (from 7S and 11S to 15S) species more susceptible to aggregation than denatured SPI [19]. Further evidence was provided by

Palazolo et. al (2003), who found that the introduction of salt caused destabilization of native SPIstabilized O/W emulsions but less so in thermally-denatured SPI-stabilized emulsions. They attributed this to the salt causing the formation of rigid flocs that were resistant to agitation [45]. The order of heating also has an effect on emulsion stability: heating the soy proteins before

polysaccharide and the emulsion droplets. This occurs via depletion flocculation and is dependent

on the concentrations of the emulsion and the polysaccharide [51]. Second, the polysaccharide may increase the viscosity of the emulsion's continuous phase and form a gel or viscous suspension, effectively trapping droplets and retarding flocculation and coalescence. Third, the polysaccharide have very low surface activity. If they are charged, they may interact electrostatically with proteins to the hydrophobic surface of oil droplets while the carbohydrate portions of the polysaccharides stabilize the droplets via electrostatic or steric repulsion [52-54]. may interact directly with the droplet surface. As polysaccharides are normally hydrophilic, they adsorbed on droplets surfaces [5]. Some polysaccharides, such as gum arabic and SSPS, contain protein moieties that increase their surface activity. The protein moieties act as anchors that bind

Gum arabic is a common polysaccharide used to stabilize emulsions given its high water

and cost [52, 55-57]. Some alternatives to gum arabic include modified starch, pectin, and SSPS [53, SSPS is a promising alternative that has been shown to have superior functional properties

compared to gum arabic, modified starch, and pectin [60]. It is an acidic polymer extracted from the residual carbohydrate byproduct of SPI production, known as okara. It has a branched stabilizing abilities (Fig 2.3) [54]. conformation and has a protein fraction that plays a major role in its emulsifying and emulsionIt is an acidic polysaccharide composed of a main rhamnogalacturonan backbone branched

by -1,4-galactan and -1,3- or -1,5-arabinan chains, and homogalacturonan [61]. SSPS contains a hydrophilic carbohydrate portion covalently bound to a protein moiety of about 50 kDa that allows it to bind to oil-water interfaces while the carbohydrate portions form a steric barrier (~17 nm water solubility (up to 30 wt%), low bulk viscosity, good emulsifying properties, and ability to form strong interfacial films [62].

The emulsifying abilities of SSPS are not affected by acidic pH or ionic strengths and it has

an adsorbed layer ~30 nm thick on emulsion droplets that protects them against coalescence via

small molecule surfactants, such as polysorbates, which cannot penetrate SSPS' layer of hydrophilic

chains [61, 63, 64]. SSPS is also resistant to heat denaturation up to 70 °C [65]. Finally, Nakamura et electrostatic interactions, though it could also cause bridging flocculation between these species [64].

is prepared: 1) miscibility or co-solubility, 2) thermodynamic incompatibility, or 3) complexation concentrations. At higher concentrations, above a co-solubility threshold, thermodynamic (also known as coacervation) (Fig 1.6). Miscibility commonly occurs at low biopolymer incompatibility or complexation occurs and depends on whether the interactions are net repulsive or net attractive, respectively [66, 67]. Complexation between proteins and polysaccharides is a at an equal ratio mixture (by weight) and at a pH where they carry an equal but opposite charge result of electrostatic interactions between proteins and polysaccharides when they are oppositely charged. Maximum complexation yield occurs when the proteins and polysaccharides are present [68]. Most food proteins form complexes with anionic polysaccharides at pH values below the IEP There are three possible outcomes when a binary mixture of proteins and polysaccharides

of the protein but above that of the polysaccharide, i.e., when they are oppositely charged. When proteins carry a net negative charge, protein-protein and protein-polysaccharide interactions are

reduced due to electrostatic repulsion. The strength of electrostatic repulsion increases with increasing pH, where the biopolymers become more negatively charged [66]. Complexation is reversible and may be reversed by adjusting the pH or ionic strength of the continuous phase. The addition of a salt such as NaCl inhibits complexation by the binding of counterions to the polymers layers, thus resulting in charge screening. High concentrations of salt not only screen electrostatic which neutralizes some of their charge, reduces the effective radius of their electrostatic double interactions between the biopolymers but also promote their self-aggregation, which may result in destabilization of the system [11, 66, 67]. The addition of anionic polysaccharides to protein-stabilized emulsions may improve

(2006), has examined the effects of SSPS and high-methoxyl pectin (HMP) on SPI at low pH [76]. They found that HMP above a critical concentration of 0.05 wt% caused extensive aggregation due to depletion flocculation whereas SSPS did not for flocculation at pH 4 but emulsions containing SSPS were stable and did not show any changes in concentrations up to 0.30 wt%. They found that 0.30 wt% SSPS was the critical concentration that resulted in small droplets and monomodal droplet size distributions. HMP caused bridging droplet size or droplet size distributions. They attributed this to the differences in the side chain

Aggregation occurs if electrostatic repulsive forces are weaker than attractive hydrophobic forces. This behaviour was observed at pH 6 for control suspensions where the lack of SSPS to stabilize the proteins led to aggregation, evidenced by an increase in larger particles ca. 10 µm.

The net charge of SPI became more positive as pH decreased, allowing for electrostatic interactions with the negatively-charged SSPS. Roudsari et al. (2006) postulated that once bound to SPI, SSPS provided stabilization via electrostatic and steric repulsion [76]. From the zeta potential data of the SPI-SSPS suspensions (Fig. 4.3), it was observed that the addition of SSPS to SPI suspensions caused charge neutralization, suggesting that there was complexation. The SPI-SSPS complexes did not exhibit aggregation even though the overall net charge was zero (zeta potential of ~0 mV), suggesting that SSPS stabilized SPI via steric repulsion rather than electrostatic repulsion. Steric stabilization by SSPS has been attributed to the highly branched structure of its large neutral chains [76].

This was overcome through the addition of 0.25 wt% SSPS, which formed complexes with the SPI via electrostatic interactions. they remained soluble and stable against aggregation, suggesting that SSPS stabilized SPI via steric Surface charge measurements indicated that SPI-SSPS complexes had zeta potentials of 0 mV yet rather than electrostatic repulsion.

These

interactions were governed by pH and biopolymer concentration. In the absence of SSPS, emulsion stability decreased with decreasing pH due to charge neutralization of SPI which caused increased flocculation and coalescence. A minimum of 0.25 wt% SSPS was required to stabilize 5.0 wt% O/W SSPS concentrations (up to 0.75 wt%) resulted in smaller droplet sizes which improved emulsion stability against creaming and pre-creaming.

or creaming which can lead to flocculation and eventually aggregation or coalescence, for aqueous suspensions or emulsions, respectively. The stability of these dispersed systems depends on environmental conditions such as pH, ionic strength, and the concentrations of stabilizing agents such as proteins and polysaccharides. The overall net charge of proteins depends on pH and the IEP. This is due to a reduction in the efficacy of electrostatic repulsion between particles or droplets Dispersed protein and polysaccharide systems may become destabilized via sedimentation

stability of protein-stabilized dispersed systems is lowest when the proteins are at or near their which results in increased flocculation/aggregation. Stability can be improved by electrostatically complexing the proteins with a polysaccharide that provides electrostatic and/or steric repulsion.

This occurs at pHs below the IEP of the proteins but above that of the polysaccharides where the proteins and polysaccharides are oppositely-charged. Ionic strength also affects complexation, as when the concentration of polysaccharide is sufficiently high to fully cover protein surfaces to form cohesive layers. These principles apply to both aqueous suspensions and oil-in-water emulsions.

higher concentrations of salt may cause charge-screening of the proteins and polysaccharides and
