Abstract
Formability and Fatigue Behavior of Tailor (Laser) Welded Blanks for Automotive Applications ©Dheeraj Anand 2004 Master of Applied Science Department of Mechanical and industrial Engineering Ryerson University
The drive towards weight reduction in the automotive industry has led to the use of tailor welded blanks (TWBs). This work is aimed at evaluating the forming and fatigue behavior of the TWBs with different thickness combinations and compositions. Forming tests were carried out to determine the forming limit diagrams (FLDs) of the TWBs, and compared with those of the individual steel sheets. The results showed that the FLDs of the TWBs lie in-between those of the individually formed steel sheets that comprise the TWBs. A semi-empirical relation based on the mean values of the strain-hardening exponents (n-values) and of the thickness of the base metals was developed to calculate the FLDo of the TWBs. The calculated FLDo values were found to be in good agreement with the experimentally determined values. The fatigue tests showed that TWBs made from zinc coated/galvanized steels exhibited a lower fatigue limit, as compared with the TWB combinations from comparable uncoated steel. This was attributed to the intergranular cracking in the galvanized TWBs, caused by the presence of zinc penetrating beneath the sheet surface.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Introduction

In the past two decades, the automotive Industry has seen stringent government regulations concerning fuel conservation and safety mandates along with

environmental concerns. These regulations have prompted automakers to come up with innovative solutions to design lighter cars for reduced fuel consumption, while Improving the overall structure of the vehicles for occupant safety. However, these changes have led to a significant Increase In the manufacturing costs. To reduce the costs and the weight, alternate materials such as aluminum and composites have been proposed for body panels, but none have shown the versatility of steel. Various new grades of steel have been developed which show excellent forming quality and are able to meet most automotive requirements [ ].
1

The conventional automobile body components consist of several Individually formed stampings being spot welded together In order to meet the material and strength requirements at various locations in the assembly. Alternatively, various steel options can be welded together prior to the forming process to produce a tailor welded blank (TWB). Such a concept of combining different materials Into a welded blank enables engineers to "tailor" the blank so that appropriate material with the required properties are located precisely within the part where needed [1]. The differences In the materials can be found In their grade, thickness, strength and surface condition like galvanized (zinc coated), galvannealed (zinc-aluminum coated) or cold rolled and annealed. Tailor welded blanks are currently used for body side frames, door Inner panels, motor compartment rails, center pillar Inner panels and wheelhouse / shock tower panels as seen in Figure 1.1.

Chapter 2 Fundamental Knowledge and Literature Survey
2.1 Manufacturing of Tailor Welded Blanks

Tailor welded blanks, as the name suggests, involve the welding of two (or more) sheets together. The different types of welds identified for this application include: a. Laser Beam b. Resistance Mash Seam c. High Frequency Induction d. Electron Beam By far, laser tailor welded blanks have found the widest applications in the automotive industry [1]. Both solid state CO and NdiYAG are being used as the
2

source to generate the laser beams. For automotive applications involving laser welding of thinner sections (in this study), no weld consumable or filler wire is used. The laser weld produces a butt-joint with a narrower (about 1 mm) heat-affected zone (HAZ), as compared to other processes. In the resistance mash seam welding process, the HAZ is about twice the width of the laser weld. The other identified advantages of laser welding are better appearance, weather seal surface and better noise suppression. A laser beam (Figure 2.1) can be used to weld a maximum weld length of about 3800 mm and the use of a multi-axes robotic system makes it possible to weld a non-parallel bead. All these factors and especially the narrower HAZ have made laser welding popular for manufacturing tailor welded blanks [1].

2.2 Forming Process

Forming (or stamping) is defined as the permanent deformation of a sheet metal blank into the desired shape using a set of matching die sets. During the course of the stamping process, sheet metal is subjected to both elastic and plastic deformation, which together constitutes the total deformation. It is the plastic (permanent) deformation that remains in the stamping on the removal of the applied load, and thus the final shape of the blank is achieved, as seen in Figure 2.2. Elastic deformation is released as springback or elastic recovery of the stamping [2]. The

amount of plastic deformation is expressed in terms of strain or sometimes referred to as stretch. Strain is a dimensionless quantity and refers to the amount (%) by which a panel has been deformed or changed from its original length. On the other hand, stress is the intensity of force within a metal which resists a change in shape and dimension. It is defined as the force per unit area.

The stress - strain (u -e) curve, as shown in Figure 2.3, is generated by recording the load with progressive extension of the test specimen. The load and displacement obtained are then converted to the stress and strain, respectively. The two important material properties that govern the forming process are yield stress (YS) and ultimate tensile stress (UTS). As seen from Figure 2.3, the strain corresponding to the yield stress is the elastic strain and the strain between the yield stress and the ultimate tensile stress is the plastic strain. This range of strain is called the plastic deformation range, and for a successful stamping process the applied stresses must 5

be within this range. If the stresses are lower than the yield stress, no permanent plastic deformation occurs, and the stresses higher than the ultimate tensile stress will lead to splitting or fracture [ ].

In other words, there Is no material being added or taken away during a stamping process and is referred to as incompressibility [3]. Further, the deformation in sheet metal stamping is termed as pure, proportional when [3J: a. The ratio of the strain increments remains constant, b. The process is monotonie, i.e., there are no reversals, and c. The principal directions remain fixed with respect to the material. During incompressible plastic deformation, the sum of the principal strain Increments is zero. The material just flows along different contours of the die set to develop the final shape of the panel being produced. This can be illustrated by considering an infinitesimal element of material as shown in Figure 2.4. On applying principal stresses, this element will deform. If the sides of the element are a, b and c initially, and a+da, b+üb and c+dc subsequently, the principal incremental strains are;

This diagram does not indicate the third principal strain (thickness strain). Figure 2.5 also illustrates the several modes of deformation in sheet metal forming operation, which are;

a. Balanced biaxial: If p = 1, the circle increases uniformly in diameter indicating that the major and minor principal strains are equal. This process is also referred to as pure stretching. b. Plane strain; If p = 0, the circle elongates only in one direction. This indicates that the material undergoes deformation in the major strain direction with the minor strain being zero. c. Pure drawing; If p = -1, the circle extends in one direction and shrinks transversely which is exactly how the material behaves.

Figure 2.5. Graphical representation of deformations in the two-dimensional strain space [3]. 2.2.1 Forming Lim it Diagram

For any successful stamping operation, it becomes necessary to know the maximum allowable load that can be applied to a blank, without generating any failure. In a sheet forming operation, different deformation modes act simultaneously on the panel being formed. These modes, as discussed in the previous section are: pure drawing, plane strain and balanced-biaxial strain. The deformation is most likely to occur in the area undergoing a biaxial stretch which has a positive value for both the major and minor strains. Failure in such a stretching operation is generally characterized by the development of a localized neck on the surface. To understand this phenomenon, the concept of critical strain level (now formability limit) was introduced by Keeler [4] and Goodwin [5]. Keeler measured the two principal surface

The curve that was drawn from the measured strains separated the failure and non failure (safe) conditions and was labeled as the critical strain level. By using the above Figure 2.6 and measuring the strains on any stamping, the proximity of these strains to failure can be determined. However, this curve has limited practical applications as it cannot be used to predict the strains in the pure drawing and plane strain conditions. Goodwin [5] carried out various forming and tension tests to obtain failures that represented the pure drawing and plane strain conditions, i.e., a positive major strain value and a negative minor strain value. This relation between the negative minor strain and the positive major strain was shown as a band (Figure 2.7). The lower curves in the band were described as denoting the onset of localized thinning (necking), whereas the upper curves represented ultimate failure. This combined developed curve, called the "Keeler-Goodwin Curve", was found to give 10

the practical formability limit for different types of failures encountered in a press shop forming operation. The lower curves of the Keeler-Good win band were subsequently joined into one curve after some fine refinements to the curve shape on the left hand side [5, 7].

This initial concept of the FLD was designed for conventional low strength steels. However, it was realized that other grades of steel, such as the high strength steels, may have lower forming limits and that the sheet thickness can also influence the forming limits. Keeler and Brazier [ ] established the following relationship among

[7, ].

However, with the development of newer grades of steel, like the extra deep drawing quality (EDDQ) and interstitial free (IF) steels, having n-values higher than 0.21, the feasibility of Eq. 2.4 has been questioned, since it was suggested by some FLD users that the FLDo value continues to rise as the n-value increases beyond 0.21. Therefore, a recent modification to the standard method has been proposed by the North American Deep Drawing Research Group (NADDRG) [7], where the multiplying factor, a, used in the Keeler-Goodwin equation is changed to n/0.21, for all values of n. This modified NADDRG equation becomes.

FLDo = ^ ( 2 3 . 3 +14.11).

2.2.2 Measurement of Forming Strains

As mentioned above, a stamping process is composed of various combinations of stretch and draw, to which bending, buckling and other complications are added. This leads to the development of non-uniform strains in the formed part. Thus, there will be regions of high strain as well as low strain, which may lead to wrinkling or 13

fracturing of the material. Keeler [4, ] has discussed the necessity of developing a
6

technique which could be quickly and accurately used to measure the strains developed in a blank during the forming process. Strain analysis by grid marking is a useful method, which has been used effectively to solve the above mentioned problems in metal forming [4]. After the sheet metal is deformed into the desired shape, the strain distribution can be seen and the critical areas of strain analyzed using the FLD to control the forming parameters. Different types of grid systems can be used for accurately measuring the strain distributions. The most important feature for any grid system is the use of smaller grid spacings having a proper orientation [ ]. The most commonly used pattern

[ ]. Over a period of time, many methods have been developed for applying these grids on the surface of steel. The square grids were scribed on the surface of the steel using parallel lines. However, the scribe marks introduced stress

concentrations which led to failures occurring along the scribe lines. Then an imprinting system was used which consisted of a rubber stamp and marking ink [ ].
6

Resolution and accuracy of grids prepared in this manner were limited and the ink markings could be easily erased. The photochemical process developed was a very time consuming process and required a number of steps to be followed. Moreover, the grids were easily removed while rubbing over a die radius.

The most preferred and quick method which is currently used in the industry involves electrochemical etching of the grids on the steel surface. In this process, an electric stencil is placed on the cleaned blank. A felt pad soaked with electrolyte is placed on top of the blank and an electrode (flat or roller type) is placed above the felt pad [9].

A wooden block is kept above as shown in Figure 2.10. Leads from a power source are attached to the electrode and the blank. The current applied varies depending on the stencil size and the line density. The pressure on the electrode squeezes the felt pad, which allows the electrolyte to pass through the stencil and to etch the grid pattern electrochemically on the blank surface. After etching, the blank is washed with a neutralizing solution. Once the sheet metal is formed, the grids based on the initial marked pattern will either deform into ellipses or parallelograms of different sizes. For a circular grid pattern as shown in the Figure 2.11, the major and minor strains are calculated from the following formulae [

Figure 2.12. Mylar tape used for calculating the major and minor strains [2].

A more recent approach for measuring the strains involves the use of a traveling microscope. There are two right angled slides on which the work piece is mounted and positioned under the microscope. The cross-wire is aligned at one end and the measurement is taken. The cross-wire is then aligned on the other end by moving the work table and the measurement is taken. The difference between the two readings gives the absolute measurement. However, a grid analyzing system as shown in Figure 2.13 is the most widely used method for measuring the changes in the dimensions of the grids. This system uses a solid state digital array camera with a built-in light source, a computer, keyboard, and CRT display. The image of a given deformed circle is displayed on the CRT and a least squares curve fitting program selects the most suitable grid, which Is displayed simultaneously [11]. The major and minor strains are then computed and displayed on the screen.

2.2.3 Factors Affecting the Forming Process

Traditional evaluations of formability are based on basic tests which include the direct measurement of the mechanical properties of the material derived from a standard tensile test, such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, strainhardening exponent (n-value), coefficient of anisotropy (r-value) and total elongation. The strain-hardening exponent (n-value) plays a significant role in evaluating the formability of sheet metals. The n-value describes the ability of the material to work harden or to uniformly distribute the deformation. A larger n-value means that the material will have greater uniform elongation and will resist localized deformation or necking. For any material, the higher the tensile/yield strength ratio, the higher the nvalue [ ].
2

The other factors affecting the strain distribution in any automotive stamping include the die geometry and lubrication. There has been a lot of work done [4, , 12, 13] on
6

the effects of these factors as discussed below.

2.2.3.1 Material Properties

The formation of an automotive stamping involves complex forming processes like deep drawing (uniaxial tension), stretching operations under plane strain and bi axial conditions and bending. The historical approach, while studying the effect of material properties on such a forming process, has been to subdivide the stamping into its component processes and study each process independently. Bending refers to the process by which a flat sheet of metal is transformed into a curved component. The deep drawing mode causes the material to undergo contraction in one direction and extension In another. The deep drawing limit of a material is greatly influenced by the coefficient of anisotropy (r-value), which is the measure of its resistance to thinning and can be obtained from a standard tensile test. The most widely used 18

forming process in automotive stampings is the stretching of sheet metal in plane strain and bi axial conditions, over a rigid punch of fixed geometry. A large percentage of forming failures are associated with this kind of process [2, 4].

Keeler [4] conducted various laboratory tests to determine the influence of material properties on the strain distribution. He investigated and compared the strain distribution for brass, steel and aluminum in annealed condition by stretching them over a 101.6 mm (4 in) diameter hemispherical punch. For a more meaningful comparison for automotive purposes, Keeler [4] analyzed the strain distributions in two different types of steels, steel A and steel B, having similar thickness in a real stamping process. The critical strain level for this particular component was identified as 45% major strain. While forming the steels, it was seen that steel A, reached the critical level of 45% major strain long before the part was formed to the final shape. At this point, steel B was strained only 34% major strain. Analysis of the steel properties revealed that the n-value for steel A was 0.22 compared to 0.19 for steel B. Based on these tests, Keeler concluded that the material having the most uniform strain distribution, i.e., a higher n-value, can successfully accomplish a stamping operation.

2.2 3.2 Die Geometry

The strain distribution in an automotive stamping is greatly influenced by the die geometry. Stamping die sets consist of a punch and a die that are forced together by the action of the press to form the metal sheet into the desired shape. Additional items like binders and draw beads help in controlling the material flovi/ during forming [2]. Figure 2.14 illustrates a simple die geometry. The punch radius, the die radius and the draw beads should be carefully determined based on the part geometry. A large and smooth punch surface (Figure 2.14) distributes the strain over a greater area and increases the permissible depth before failure. The die and punch should 19

be thoroughly examined for surface defects and material pick-up from previous runs. Careful measurements are often required to detect any misalignment which may lead to serious forming failures. The laboratory test for evaluating the formability of sheet metal is based on a simple die design which consists of a 101.6 mm (4 in) hemispherical punch with a circular draw bead [14] as shown in Figure 2.15.

2.2.3 3 Lubrication

Lubricants are used to control or facilitate metal flow over punches and into die cavities. The degree and type of lubrication can strongly influence the strain distribution in a stamping process. The expanded growth of zinc coated (galvanized) steel sheets for automotive stampings has triggered various studies [12, 13] about the effect of interface friction with lubricants, die materials and temperature. The highly localized strain distribution reduces overall formability of the material. Also, the interface friction may change the strain path during forming and the final strain state in the part. Conventionally, the interface friction is represented by the coefficient of friction, which can be measured via different friction tests. Keeler et al. [13] and Shi and Meuleman [12] have reported that the effect of lubricant is different among different types of materials or even for the same material from different suppliers. To analyze this effect, the draw bead simulator test was designed which allows the material to be pulled over a set of roller and fixed beads as shown in Figure 2.16. The data generated from this test is used to determine the friction force and finally calculate the coefficient of friction.

A series of such tests was conducted by Shi and Meuleman [12] on different types of lubricants and automotive steels from different producers. A mix of bare, electro galvanized and hot-dip galvanized steels was tested with oil based, water based and a dry film lubricant. It was observed that the bare steels showed the least sensitivity to the characteristics of the lubricants used. This was attributed to the uniform surface characteristics generated during the processing of bare steel. On the other hand, galvanized steels that have a different surface topography than the bare or uncoated steels were found to be more sensitive to the lubricant used. Therefore, the capability of different lubricants to mask these different surfaces becomes more important. In terms of formability, the ideal press shop lubricant should be robust and

The structural sheet components used in the automobile industry are susceptible to fatigue in certain areas where high stresses occur due to the sudden change in the profile and geometry of the component. For a formed component, there are several factors that govern the fatigue life. The forming properties of the material, the layout of the forming tool, the blank holder forces, lubrication and surface properties like roughness and protective coatings are some of the factors that affect the fatigue life [15]. Also, the residual stresses, degree of prestraining, localized stress

concentration and the strain path play a vital role in determining the fatigue life of the material being formed [15]. Fatigue failures generally occur at local areas of high stress concentration due to the abrupt change in geometry when any material is subjected to a repetitive or fluctuating stress (cyclic loading). The stress level at which fatigue failure occurs is 22

much lower than that required to cause fracture when a uniform load is applied [16]. For example, sharp press radii in combination with a reduction in the thickness of the sheet may lead to severe stress concentration at that point. This kind of failure is sudden and occurs without any warning. A fatigue failure is generally recognized from the appearance of the fracture surface, which generally has a smooth region due to the rubbing action as the crack propagates and a rough region, where the material fails in a ductile manner as shown in Figure 2.17. The progress of the fracture is indicated by a series of rings, also called as beach marks, moving inwards from the point where the failure initiated [16]. In general, a fatigue failure occurs due to the initiation and growth of cracks which are very fine and difficult to detect. Once a large area is occupied by the cracks, the load bearing area gets reduced and sudden failure occurs without any notice [16].

of the S-N curve [16], a plot of stress S and the number of cycles to failure N, as shown in Figure 2.18. Unless othenvise indicated, N is taken as the number of cycles of stress to cause complete fracture of the specimen. The value of stress that is plotted can be O a (stress amplitude), a^ax or O m in (Figure 2.19). The S-N relationship is determined for a specified value of mean stress O m , or stress ratio R [16]. The number of cycles of stress which a metal can endure before failure increases with decreasing stress amplitude. Fatigue tests are usually carried out for
1 0

^ cycles, beyond which the samples are considered as a run-out, i.e., no failure

occurs at the applied stress amplitude. The highest stress level at which the run-out (non-failure) is obtained is thus taken as the fatigue limit. Below this value of stress level, the material can be considered to endure an infinite number of cycles without failure and the S-N curve becomes horizontal (Figure 2.18) [16]. The fatigue limit is frequently correlated with tensile properties. For steels, the fatigue limit is approximately 50% of the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The ratio of the fatigue limit to the tensile strength is called the fatigue ratio and is often used to compare the fatigue properties of different materials.

2.4 Recent Studies on Formability of Tailor Welded Blanks

The use of newer grades of steels like the interstitial free (IF), dual phase (DP), transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) and high strength low alloy (HSLA) for TWO applications has raised various challenges, including the prediction and evaluation of the performance of these TWBs in forming and other structural properties like fatigue resistance. Many reports have been documented, which discuss the forming behavior of TWBs of conventional steels. Shi et at. [18], in their work on drawing quality steel, have reported different modes of forming failure for TWBs. In a similar thickness TWB combination (0.8-0.8 mm), the failure occurs in a direction perpendicular to the weld bead. In the case of a dissimilar thickness TWB (0.8-1
. 8

mm), failure occurs in the thinner material and is

oriented parallel to the weld bead as shown in Figure 2.20. They found that the weld bead usually undergoes uni-directional deformation along the welding line and hence the positioning of the weld in the sheet blank should be carefully selected. The suggested optimum position is to place the weld perpendicular to the major strain direction. To obtain the maximum formability performance of TWBs, 25

deformation in the thinner or lower strength material should be minimized. They have also reported that the forming limit of a TWB depends on the specific welding set-up conditions and the material used. The maximum formability can be achieved by optimizing welding parameters and/or by using more formable steels such as IF and very low carbon steels, which result in a more formable weld. Chan et al. [19] reported the effect of varying thicknesses on the formability of the TWBs. An Nd:YAG laser was used for butt welding cold rolled sheets. Their different thickness combinations were 0.5-1.0 mm, 0.6-1.0 mm and 0.8-1.0 mm, having a given carbon content of 0.12%. They carried out Swift round-bottom tests which are similar to hemispherical punch (Figure 2.15) tests and have a round punch of 50 mm diameter with a blank holding force of 30 kN. The weld bead in the forming tests was oriented perpendicular to the major strain axis. They evaluated the performance of the TWBs based on the thickness ratio by measuring the limiting dome heights
(LDH) to failure. Limiting dome height represents the maximum height (h in Figure

2.21) to which a sheet specimen can stretch at the onset of necking/facture. They reported that the lower the thickness ratio of the TWBs, the higher the LDH. While comparing the FLDo values of the TWBs, they found that the TWBs having the highest thickness ratio yield the lowest FLDo value. The FLDo value of the TWBs was reported to be lower than the FLDo of the thicker ( in Figure 2.22.

Chan et al. [20] also carried out Swift bottom tests on TWBs of JIS-3141 (0.04% carbon) cold rolled sheets. The TWBs had different thickness combinations of 0.70.8 mm, 0.7-1.0 mm and 0.8-1.0 mm, welded by an Nd:YAG laser. They used 2 mm diameter grids for measuring the major and minor strains. The weld bead was once again oriented perpendicular to the major strain axis. The forming failure was reported to occur in the thinner section of the TWB and in a direction parallel to the weld bead. However, it was reported that with the variation in width of the specimens, the distance of the failure from the weld bead also varied. With the increase in the width, the failure was observed to be closer to the weld bead. They also observed that as the thickness ratio of the TWBs increased, the LDH to failure decreased as shown in Table 2.1.

In the work by Ghoo et al. [21], the concept of a new forming limit diagram for TWBs was introduced (Figure 2.23). They carried out hemispherical dome tests on different widths of similar (0.8-0
. 8

mm) and dissimilar thickness (0.8-1.5 mm) TWBs. The

weld bead was at the centre of the punch face and oriented parallel to the major strain direction. With the use of 2.54 mm (1 in) square grids, they measured the strains in the weld zone by generating a failure perpendicular to the weld bead. It was observed (Figure 2.23) that the FLD of the weld zone in both similar and dissimilar thickness TWBs was lower than the FLD of the base metals. Also, the dome height at fracture for similar thickness TWBs was found to be lower than the dome height for dissimilar ones.

2.5 Recent Studies on Fatigue of Tailor Welded Blanks

The auto/steel partnership (A/SP), in one of their reports [1], has remarked that the failure of the TWBs under cyclic loading or fatigue is a serious problem for the structural components. The high cycle fatigue strength of a material depends on surface conditions, residual tensile stresses and hardness. With the use of the laser welding process, residual tensile stresses and other welding defects can be introduced into a material. A/SP has identified this as an area that requires further research, as there are only limited data in this respect. Wang and Ewing [22] have compared the fatigue strength of laser welds with that of resistance spot welds of similar thickness (0.76 mm) bare SAE 1008 grade of steel. The laser welds were oriented in a direction, both, parallel and perpendicular to the loading direction. The fatigue strength of the laser welded blank that was oriented perpendicular to the loading direction gave the highest fatigue resistance as shown in Figure 2.24. This was mainly attributed to the high stress intensity introduced at the circumference of the spot weld due to its geometry.

Lazzarin et al. [23], while evaluating different welding processes, determined the fatigue strengths of similar thickness (1.5 mm) laser welded sheets in both bare and hot dip galvanized conditions. The weld bead was oriented perpendicular to the loading direction. They concluded that the fatigue strengths of both the combinations were similar.

Rhee et al. [24] evaluated the fatigue behavior of similar (0.9 mm) and dissimilar (G.9-2.0 mm) thickness laser welded sheets of bare cold rolled steel (0.016% carbon). The weld bead was oriented both parallel and perpendicular to the loading direction. Both similar (Type B) and dissimilar (Type D) thickness specimens with weld bead being perpendicular to the loading direction showed similar fatigue

strengths as seen in Figure 2.25. The fatigue crack initiated in the base metal and the final fracture also occurred in the base metal.

The mash seam welds had a greater notch effect and thus lower fatigue strength. Aristotile and Fersini [27] evaluated the fatigue strength of a production part that was formed out of a laser welded blank. The fracture was found to occur at locations having clamping holes away from the weld bead.

2.6 Objectives of Research

As seen from the above literature review, most of the reported work on formability [18-21] and fatigue [22-28] of TWBs is on conventional low carbon steels. Moreover, the formability of TWBs has been analyzed based on the limiting dome heights to failure. Extensive experimental data for the FLDo values of TWBs consisting of newer grades of steel cannot be found in the published literature. The effects of material properties like the strain-hardening exponent (n-value) and the thickness of the individual sheets on determining the FLDo values have not been investigated. 32

previous work in fatigue basically analyzed the behavior of similar thickness TWBs or just one combination of TWB consisting of different thickness materials. No comparison or benchmarking regarding the fracture mechanisms has been reported for different TWBs consisting of newer developed grades in both galvanized (zinc coated) and bare (uncoated) conditions. Therefore in this work, the forming behavior and fatigue strength characteristics of production CO laser welded TWBs, composed of galvanized interstitial free and
2

very low carbon steels, with different thickness combinations and different compositions are addressed. Limiting dome height (forming) tests were carried out and the FLDo values for the TWBs were determined both analytically and experimentally. The fatigue strength of the TWBs was compared to the base metal, and the fracture mechanisms were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), coupled with EDS analysis.

Chapter 3 Experimental Procedure
3.1 Materials

The materials selected In this study were interstitial free (annealed-and hot dip galvanized) and very low carbon steel sheets (cold rolled and annealed). The selection was made from a lot used for actual production parts which were laser butt-welded. The chemical composition of the test materials is listed in Table 3.1. Three different combinations of TWBs were identified as GMX, W-Car and MC-DI based on the part name.

·

GMX has the minimum difference in the thickness and the maximum difference in the yield strength of the two sheets.

· ·

W-Car has the minimum difference in the yield strength of the two sheets. MC-DI has the maximum difference in the thickness of the two sheets.

Details of the differences in the physical characteristics of the TWBs are summarized in Table 3.2. One of the base metals, identified as BM, was selected for comparing the fatigue strength of the TWBs. As seen from Table 3.2, the thickness of the individual sheet metals in the TWBs ranges from a minimum of 0.75 mm to a maximum of 2.0 mm, the average of which is about 1.5 mm, and the BM of 1.5 mm thickness was hence selected in the present work.

3.2.2 Formability Tests and Strain Measurement

Prior to the forming tests, the welded blanks were etched with 1 mm square grids using the electrochemical etching technique discussed in section 2.2,2. The equipment, cleanser, electrolyte and the neutralizing agent (GMK Marking Kit) used were provided by The Lectroetch Company, OH, USA. The electrolyte was LNC-3, the cleanser used was soap based degreaser and the neutralizing agent was methanol [9]. The limiting dome height (forming) tests were carried out on an MTS 866.02 formability press, as shown in Figure 3.1. The weld bead was oriented at the centre of a 101.6 mm (4.0 in) hemispherical punch (Figure 3.2), in a direction perpendicular to both the principal strain and rolling directions.

bead diameter of 254 mm (10 in). A clamping force of 135 kN was used to secure the test specimen. The tests were performed according to ASTM E643-84 standards [14]. While performing the experiment, a practical difficulty of controlling and stopping the test at the point of necking was encountered. Thus both necking and fracture, as shown in Figure 3.3, were accepted as the criterion for failure for all the stretch dome tests, which has also been reported by Chan etal. [19]. The lubrication between the punch face and the TWB surface was provided by a light coating of mill oil (Quaker Lerrocote 61 MAL-HCL-1G), followed by a 0.05 mm plastic sheet and a 6.35 mm (0.25 in) rubber puck (Figure 3.4). Shims or circular rings, as shown in Figure 3.4, were used to compensate for the variation in the thickness of the TWBs during clamping in-between the die beads. The etching and forming tests were carried out at Dofasco's research and development facility.

In order to develop a comprehensive FLD for the TWBs, a series of rectangular specimens with a constant length of 203.2 mm (8.0 in) and varying widths of 25.4203.2 mm (1.0-8.0 in) were tested as per the ASTM E2218 procedures [10]. Also, a number of different square grids ( 1 0

) were measured on each of the different width

specimens to record the data for determining the different levels of major and minor strains in both safe and failed regions on the FLD. The narrower width specimen (25.4-101.6 mm) yielded the strain states on the left-hand side of the FLD. The specimen width of 101.6-152.4 mm yielded a strain state in the middle region representing plane strain condition. The right-hand side of the FLD, which accounts for the balanced bi-axial stretch, was represented by the specimens ranging from 152.4-203.2 mm. Figure 3.5 shows various widths superimposed on an FLD. After the forming tests, the amount of deformation in the welded blanks was measured to calculate the major and minor strains. This was achieved by the use of a square grid analyzing (SGA) system manufactured by FMTI Systems Inc., Hamilton, ON, Canada. This system consists of a CCD camera (Model 100A) with a 39

combination of different lenses for capturing the picture of the deformed grids and square grid analysis software-version 5.31 for calculating the engineering strains from the deformed grids. The tests were carried out at Dofasco.

Minor strain, % Figure 3,5. Specimen widths superimposed on a forming limit diagram.

As recommended by the manufacturer, the system was calibrated by measuring the originally etched square grids at five different locations prior to forming tests. This minimized the error in strain measurement to as low as 0.5%. The failed and non failed (safe) regions on the formed specimens were identified on the basis of the rule of thumb commonly used in the industry. The grids which are immediately adjacent to the fracture or necked region correspond to the strain in the necked region and the grids which are about 5 mm away from the neck/fracture are considered to be in the safe region. Once these regions are identified, the CCD camera is used to manually locate a single deformed grid. After the grid has been captured, as shown 40

in Figure 3.6, the SGA software calculates and displays the major and minor strains (Figure 3.7). As seen in Figure 3.7, the dark circular points represent the strain corresponding to the necked region and the lighter points correspond to the strain in the safe zone. (These points appeared as red (necked) and green (safe) on the computer screen.)

3.2.3 Tensile Tests

3.2.4 Fatigue Tests

The geometry of the laser butt-welded fatigue test specimen is shown in Figure 3.9. The weld bead was located at the centre, oriented in a direction perpendicular to the loading direction. For the base metal (BM) being tested, the dimensions were exactly the same as those for the specimen with the laser weld at the centre. The rolling direction of the material was in the loading direction. Similar geometry has also been used in other published work [23-26]. To avoid the effect of sharp edges on the fatigue properties, the gauge grea of all the specimens was slightly smoothened out by hand polishing using a 084 fine (# 400) emery paper.

The fatigue tests were carried out at Ryerson University on a fully computerized servo-hydraulic fatigue testing system (INSTRON: 8801). The tests were carried out in a load control mode as per ASTM E466 [32] specifications. Samples were subjected to tensile stress fatigue cycles [23, 26-28], in a direction perpendicular to the weld line, using a stress ratio R {OmJoma*) = 0.1. A sinusoidal loading shape with a frequency of 50 Hz was used in all the tests. The test was stopped at 10^ cycles and the sample was considered as a run out. At the beginning of the test, the value of the maximum applied load, Pm ax, was selected to be about half the tensile strength. The S-N curve for each TWB and the base metal was determined with 8-12 different specimens. The mean load, Pm ean, which was one of the input parameters, can be calculated as follows, R = flZÉL = 0.1, ^max

3.2.5 Microstructure and Microhardness Tests

Prior to the forming and fatigue tests, the microstructure of the weld cross-section was examined under an optical microscope to evaluate the quality of the laser welds. Cross-sections of the TWB with weld bead and base metals were mounted using a hot mounting press. The mounts were then ground and polished using different grits of sand papers on an automated grinding wheel manufactured by Struers Inc. The grinding of the material was carried out on MD-Piano diamond disc. The use of diamond paste as an abrasive leads to a higher material removal rate and short grinding times. The fine grinding was carried out on MD-Allergo (SiC based cloth) with diamond suspension as abrasive. The diamond size was in the range of 3-15 microns. Fine polishing of the material was carried out on MD-Dac and MD-Nap discs (SiC based cloth). The abrasive used was diamond suspension with particle range of 1-3 pm along with an alcohol based lubricant (DP-Blue). The lubricant provided a high cooling and low smearing effect [33]. The welds were initially observed in the unetched condition to check for inclusions. Further, 4% Nital was used as an etchant to develop the microstructure. The etched samples were then observed under an optical microscope. Vickers microhardness tests were carried out on a fully computerized and automated microhardness tester, Clemex MT-2001. The specimens used were similar to those used for the microstructural analysis. The load applied was 300 grams with a dwell time of 15 seconds. The indents were spaced at a distance of 100 pm (Figure 3.10) from one another. The recorded Vickers hardness (HV) values are listed in Appendix B. The microstructure and microhardness tests were carried out at Dofasco.

3.2.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy

After the fatigue tests, to identify the fatigue crack initiation sites and crack propagation mechanisms, fracture surfaces were examined using a fully automated (JEOL; JSM - 6460 LV) conventional low vacuum microscope operating in back scattered electrons (BSE) mode. EDS analysis was used to identify if zinc is present on the fracture surfaces. These tests were done at Dofasco's research and development facility.

Chapter 4 Experimental Results
4.1 Microstructurai Observations

The microstructure of the weld cross-section revealed that the welds were free of any welding defects such as porosity, concavity, cracks, voids, inclusions and misalignments, as shown in Figure 4.1. This indicated that the welding parameters used for the TWBs (Table 3.3) are appropriate to obtain sound welds. The average width of the fusion zone was about

mm and that of the total heat-affected

zone on either sides of the base metal was approximately 0.7 - 1 mm. The microstructure in the base metals shows equiaxed grains of ferrite. The weld zone shows fine pearlite and/or low carbon bainite. Details will be discussed in section 5.2.

4.2 Tensile Properties

The tensile properties of the base metals consisting of the TWBs were determined as described in section 3.2.3 and are given in Table 4.1. Figures 4.2 and 4.3 show the engineering stress-strain curves for the thin and thick sheets of the TWBs, respectively. It is seen that the respective yield strengths of the thinner and thicker sheets of the TWBs are 185 and 156 MPa (GMX), 160 and 159 MPa (W-Car) and 155 and 146 MPa (MC-DI). Similarly, the n-values are 0.225 and 0.227 (GMX), 0.238 and 0.244 (W-Car) and 0.237 and 0.246 (MC-DI). While strengths of GMX (very low carbon steel) and W-Car and MC-DI (IF steels) are similar, the IF steels have a better elongation.

4.3 Formability Results 4.3.1 Forming Limit Diagrams

The forming tests and strain measurements were carried out according to the procedure described in section 3.2.2. The comprehensive FLDs for GMX, W-Car and MC-DI TWBs are plotted in Figures 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. The circular points in these figures represent the strains in the fracture/necked region and the diamond shaped points are the strains from the safe region. For the ease of comparing the data, theoretical FLDs of the base metals are superimposed on the measured FLDs. The upper curve represents the theoretical FLD of the thicker sheet and the lower curve represents the thinner sheet.

However, for analyzing the results, only strains that clearly separated the safe and necked region were used to plot the FLD for the TWB combinations.

It is seen from Figure 4.7 that the fatigue limit for W-Car and MC-DI TWB combinations, which were zinc-coated (galvanized), is much lower (85 MPa) than that for the non-galvanized or bare GMX TWB (120 MPa), and the base metal (110 MPa). The reason will be discussed in section 5.4.

Chapter 5 Discussion
5.1 On Weld Quality and Failure Location

The microstructurai observations (Figure 4.3) show that the laser welds were free of any defects. While carrying out the forming tests on the TWBs, the forming failure for all the three combinations was observed to occur in the thinner section. These findings are summarized in Table 5.1. However, the location of the fracture/neck on the thinner section showed some variation with the difference in the widths of the specimens. The width of the specimens varied from a minimum of 25.4 mm (1.0 in) to a maximum of 203.2 mm
( 8

in).

It was observed that for the smaller width specimens (25.4 - 76.2 mm), the fracture/necking occurred at an angle of 30-40° to the weld bead (Figure 5.1). Also, the location of the failure was at a distance of about 40 mm from the weld bead. Narrower specimens usually generate a deep drawing effect on the materials being formed [2, 4, 5, 7]. The material flow occurs along the side of the punch face as against the top of the punch which causes the material to fail at a distance from the weld bead.

With the larger widths (88.9 - 203.2 mm) representing the plane strain and balanced bi axial stretch modes, the failure occurred in a direction parallel to the weld bead at a distance of 7-11 mm (Figure 5.2). In this case, the punch surface has a maximum contact area with the specimen which results in the material being stretched in all directions which leads to the necking at the top of the punch face.

Irrespective of the failure mode, all the failures occurred in the thinner base metal indicating that the welding parameters given in Table 3.3 produced defect-free welds with no forming failures in the weld zone (fusion and heat affected zones). In a TWB 57

consisting of materials having different thicknesses with similar strength, most of the plastic strain is distributed in the thinner material as it has a lower resistance to the applied force than the thicker material, and hence the forming failure is always associated with the thinner material [19,
2 0

].

The guideline for the acceptance of a TWB laser weld is based on the weld failure mode. A/SP [1] has specified that, if a weld failure occurs either in the weld or the heat-affected zone (HAZ) in a direction parallel to the weld seam, the weld is considered unacceptable. However, if the failure occurs in the weld in a direction perpendicular to the weld seam or in the base metal, it is acceptable. On the basis of these guidelines, the TWBs in the present work are all acceptable.

Similar observations have been reported by other researchers. Ghoo etal. [21] have reported failures perpendicular to the weld bead in the case of similar thickness TWBs. However, they have not confirmed the reason for such a failure mode. Chan et al. [19, 20] observed the forming failure in the thinner part of the TWBs in a direction that was parallel to the weld line and perpendicular to the principal strain. This was attributed to the non-uniform strain distribution in the thinner material as it resists a much smaller force than the thicker material. Shi et al. [18] carried out experiments on similar and dissimilar thickness TWBs. In the case of similar thickness TWBs, they observed the failure in a direction perpendicular to the weld bead and on the other hand, for dissimilar thickness TWBs, the forming failure was observed in the thinner section and was parallel to the weld bead. Failure across the weld is caused by the low forming limit in the weld. The failure parallel to the weld was because of too large of a thickness difference.

The microhardness traverses of the TWB cross-section show a higher hardness in the weld (Figure 5.3), as compared to the individual base metals. In all the three combinations of TWBs, it was found that the hardness of the weld bead was about 2.5 times higher than that of the respective base metal. This is attributed to the localized thermal energy input and sudden cooling, which is typical of the laser welding process and is reported by other researchers [20, 24, 25].

Shi et al. [18] and Lazzarin et al. [23], while comparing the different welding techniques on hot dip galvanized-low carbon steels, reported a higher hardness in the weld that was made by the laser welding process as compared with the mash seam welding process. Rhee et al. [24], for similar and dissimilar thickness sheet metals, reported the hardness in the weld bead to be 2.3 times than that of the respective base metals. Lee et al. [26] have reported that laser welding generates the narrowest weld zone as compared with the electron beam (1.5 times) and mash seam welding (4 times) processes. They also found the microhardness peaks for the laser welding process to be higher than the electron beam and mash seam welding processes. However, they did not explain the appropriate reason for the higher hardness in the weld.

microstructural refinement, solid-solution strengthening and precipitation hardening [36]. A typical microstructure (Figure 5.4(a)) of such steels consists of a ferrite matrix with imbedded precipitates of titanium and niobium carbides. The ferrite has different morphologies based on the decomposition of austenite and are identified as: polygonal ferrite having equiaxed grains and low dislocation density, widmanstatten ferrite, defined by elongated grains with a dislocation substructure, granular ferrite containing islands of micro-constituents and a high dislocation density and bainitic ferrite, which consists of parallel ferrite laths and high dislocation densities [36]. Due to the accelerated and nonequilibrium cooling rate of the laser welding process, the formation of polygonal ferrite is suppressed and instead leads to the formation of nonequilibrium, nonequiaxed granular ferrite and/or bainitic ferrite. Due to these nonequilibrium conditions of cooling, the ferrite microstructures possess some unique morphological features [36]. With an increase in the cooling rate, the volume fraction of granular ferrite and baintic ferrite is observed to grow at the expense of polygonal ferrite. At a point where the microstructure reveals mostly granular ferrite, the locations of prior-austenite grain boundaries get preserved. Further, as the temperature falls below the critical temperature of 72TC, this preserved austenite transforms to a finer pearlite and/or low carbon bainite structure [36], as shown in Figure 5.4(b). This phenomenon explains the increase in hardness of the weld metal. Similar observations were reported by Biro [37]. He found that due to the high and rapid heat input by the laser welding technique, the austenite was stabilized in the carbon rich zone. The rapid heat dissipation in the fusion zone leads to the formation of finer pearlite and bainite. However, the amount of bainite formed was relatively small as compared to pearlite because of the lower carbon content in the base metals being welded.

5.3 On Formability 5.3.1 Effect of Strain-hardening Exponent and Sheet Thickness on the FLDo of Tailor Welded Blanks

As can be seen from the NADDRG equation (Eq. 2.5), the FLDo of a sheet metal is a function of its n-value and the thickness. Since the TWBs in this study are composed of two materials with different thicknesses, a novel approach has been considered for calculating the FLDo values for the TWBs. It was assumed that, for the TWB combination under consideration, the n-value of the TWB is the mean of the nvalues of the base metals, and similarly the thickness of the TWB is the mean of the individual base metal thicknesses. This can be represented as.

where iI tw b = Mean n-value of thick and thin sheets of the TWB, twB = Mean thickness of thick and thin sheets of the TWB, nihick = Strain-hardening exponent of thicker sheet, H Thin = Strain-hardening exponent of thinner sheet, tjhick = Thickness of the thicker sheet, tjhin = Thickness of the thinner sheet.

These values were then used to substitute n and t in Eq. 2.5, and the FLDo for the TWB was calculated. For example, considering the GMX TWB combination having a thickness combination of 1.5 mm and 0.9 mm and respective n-values of 0.225 and 0.227 (Table 4.1), the n-value and the thickness of the TWB are,

Similar calculations can be done for other TWB combinations, and the obtained results are given in Table 5.2. These calculated values were then compared with the measured FLDo values. The forming failure for all the three TWB combinations was observed to occur in the thinner section. Thus, the calculated FLDo values (major strain values under plane strain condition) of the thinner sections were compared with the measured FLDo values for the TWBs. The measured FLDo values were not located at the exact uniaxial strain coordinate of (0, y) (Table 4.2) and hence had to be interpolated to obtain the major strain at % minor strain.
0

For the GMX TWB, the two sets of values closest to and on either side of 0% minor strain are (-0.2%, 44.4%) and (0.8%, 44,2%). The initial difference d, between -0.2% and 0.8% is 1% and the final difference df between 44.2% and 44.4% is 0.2%. Using the principle of similar triangles and values of dj and df (Figure 5.5) gives. 0.8% : 1% = (X - 44.2%) : 0.2% :. X = FLDo (interpolated) = 44.3%. (5.6)

The above adjusted measured FLDo (i.e., interpolated) value (Eq. 5.6) gives the major strain at 0% minor strain and was compared with the calculated FLDo value of 43.2% obtained from Eq. 5.5. Similar results were calculated for the W-Car and MCDI TWBs, and are shown in Table 5.2.

It can be seen from Table 5.2 that the adjusted measured (interpolated) and calculated FLDo values are in good agreement with small differences of less than ±2.5%. Thus, the above method using the mean n-value and thickness values of the TWB in the NADDRG equation (Eq. 2.5) provides a reasonably accurate prediction of the FLDo of a TWB. Further, the above finding indicates that the two important parameters to be considered while determining the FLDo value of TWBs are the strain-hardening coefficients of the base metals and their respective thicknesses. In the reported literature [18, 20, 21], researchers have evaluated the formability of TWBs by measuring the dome heights to failure (Figure 2.21). The effect of the material thickness and properties (n-value) on the FLDo of TWBs has not been explored in detail. The semi-empirical relation in this work, though relatively simple, 66

can be used as a guideline in the press shop to effectively utilize the material properties for a successful stamping operation.

5.3.2 Comparison of the Forming Limit Diagram of Tailor Welded Blanks with the Base Metals

Most of the forming failures generally occur in the plane strain condition close to the
FLDo position. In this region, the material is stretched over the punch face leading to

severe deformation. Therefore, the position of the FLDo on the major strain axis (yaxis) of a forming limit diagram becomes an important indicator of the failure tolerance of a TWB. For any material, the higher the FLDo value, the higher the forming limit. For the TWBs studied in this work, the forming failure was observed to occur in the thinner sheet. Hence the FLDo of the thinner sheet was calculated using Eq. 2.5 and compared with the measured FLDo of the TWBs. For GMX TWB, the adjusted measured FLDo (section 5.3.1) was at 44.3% major strain. The calculated FLDo (based on Eq. 2.5) of the thinner section (0.9 mm) was 39.7% major strain. As seen from Figure 5.6, the FLDo of the TWB is about 4.7% higher than the FLDo of the thinner sheet. Also, the FLDo of the TWB lies in-between those of the thin and thick sheets. Chan et al. [19], while comparing the FLD of a TWB with the base metal, reported lower FLDo values for the TWBs with respect to the thicker section alone. However, they did not report the relative FLDo level of the thinner sheet. It may be intuitively surmised that, because of the presence of the weld bead, the FLDo of the TWB would be inferior to that of the individual base metals (and hence the thicker sheet as illustrated by Chan at at. [19]). The findings of the present work show that the
FLDo of the TWB is lower than that of the thicker sheet (similar to Chan at al. [19]); it

is also greater than that of the thinner sheet. While designing a panel, the 67

automotive stamping industry, based on the limiting dome height results [18, 20, 21] which show a lower formability of TWBs than the individual base metals, tend to be conservative in determining the maximum FLDo value [1]. To avoid the sporadic breakage due to the day-to-day variations in the stamping process conditions, a safety factor of 10% major strain below the maximum FLDo value was suggested by Raghavan et al. [7], This safety factor, which is the most common method used in the press shop, further lowers the maximum FLDo of a TWB. Based on this, the observation of the present work is of interest since it shows that the formability of a TWB can be superior to that of the corresponding thinner sheet.

The above findings can be explained as follows. While forming the TWBs, the weld bead, which has a higher hardness than the base metals (Figure 5.3), was found to shift towards the thicker section. This is attributed to the fact that no significant deformation occurred in the weld bead and the thicker section, which was evident by the etched grid pattern. During the forming process, the square grids on the weld bead and the thicker section side did not show any change in shape. Thus, only elastic deformation occurred in the weld bead and the thicks; section. The plastic deformation during forming concentrates in the thinner section only. The use of shims to provide a balanced clamping force and lubricants (mill oil, plastic sheet and rubber puck) to reduce the interface friction may have unifornily distributed and increased the limit strains, leading to the increase in the FLDo of the TWB. Shi et al. [18] reported similar observations in their work on different thickness TWBs. By positioning the weld bead perpendicular to the major strain direction, they were able to obtain maximum formability performance. In order to achieve a higher formability, they recommend using good lubrication, reducing the severity of the draw beads, applying uniform blank holding pressures and appropriately placing the weld bead. They have also mentioned that by optimizing the welding parameters and/or by using more formable steels like IF and extra low carbon steels may result in a more formable weld and lead to higher limit strains, which is confirmed by the results obtained in the present work. Similar results to those of GMX TWB were observed for the W-Car and MC-DI TWB combinations (Table 5.3), where the material grade and thickness combinations were different from the GMX TWB and so was the difference in the yield strengths of the base materials constituting these blanks.

The W-Car TWB combination has a thickness difference of 0.92 mm. The adjusted measured FLDo value for this TWB was found to be at 47.5% major strain. The calculated FLDo of the thinner sheet of the W-Car TWB was found to be at 38.8% 69

5.4 On Fatigue Strength

The S-N curves for the three TWB combinations and the base metal have been given In Figure 4.7. It is seen that the fatigue limit of the uncoated TWB combination (GMX) was 1.4 times higher than that of zinc coated W-Car and MC-DI. The results also show a difference of 10 MPa in the fatigue limit of GMX TWB and the base metal (BM), which was probably related to the experimental error during the machining/polishing of the gauge section. In view of this, the data are represented with the error bars in Figure 4.7. The fatigue ratio of the fatigue limit of the TWBs to the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the thinner sections of the TWBs, where the fatigue failure occurred, is shown in Table 5.4. The fatigue ratio for the non galvanized or bare GMX was found to be 1.4 times higher than that for the galvanized W-Car and MC-DI. It is well known that fatigue properties depend on the surface condition of the material tested. Surface treatments like electroplating generally reduce the fatigue limit of steel. Similar findings have been reported for an age-hardenable aluminum alloy sheet coated with a soft aluminum coating [16]. The particular surface treatment conditions used to produce the coating can have an appreciable effect on the fatigue properties, since large changes in the residual stress, adhesion and hardness of the coating layer can be produced. The processing of galvanized TWBs is somewhat similar to the above mentioned process, in which the steel substrate is coated with a softer layer of molten zinc by adhesion. Residual tensile stresses are generated on the surface of the steel when the molten zinc solidifies and is further subjected to temper rolling or a skin pass operation for a homogeneous texture. This phenomenon can be one of the contributing factors for the lower fatigue limit of the galvanized TWBs.

Even though different failure modes of these TWBs were observed, the fatigue initiation site in all the cases was in the base metal, which was associated with the inclusion or porosity, as shown in Figure 5.9. For the W-Car and MC-DI combinations, the fatigue crack propagated in the thinner base metals (0.75 mm and 0.80 mm, respectively). However, the location of the failure in the thinner base metals was found to vary with the applied stress amplitude. For the stress amplitude of 90, 100 and 110 MPa, the failure occurred close to the weld bead (about 2 mm) and for higher values of 120 and 130 MPa, the observed failure was away (about
6

-

7 mm) from the weld bead. For the bare GMX TWB combination, failure occurred in the thinner (0.9 mm) base metal and was always away (about 6 - 7 mm) from the weld bead for the entire range of applied load (120 - 150 MPa). The notch effect, because of the thickness variation in the TWBs, may have increased the stress concentration around the weld bead. The thickness difference of the base metals for W-Car and MC-DI TWBs (0.90 and 1.2 mm, respectively) is at least 1.5 times more than that of the GMX TWB (0.6 mm). Because of the stress concentration caused by such a big difference, failure close to the weld bead was observed. Similar results have also been reported by others [22-25]. Rhee et al. [24] compared different specimen geometries with the weld bead running both parallel and perpendicular to the loading direction. For the specimens that were loaded perpendicular to the weld bead, crack initiation and final fracture occurred in 73

the base metal. The crack initiation in the base metal was attributed to the higher fatigue resistance of the weld bead than the base metal. Oh et al. [25] found the fatigue limit of similar thickness TWBs to be higher than the dissimilar ones. This was attributed to the notch effect caused by the discontinuous face which induced stress concentration and decreased the fatigue limit. Also, Lazzarin et al. [23], while evaluating different welding processes, reported that visual examination of specimens under stress did not reveal any apparent transverse necking in the weld bead. Lee et al. [26] found that the fatigue failure in the case of mash seam welded blanks occurred in the heat affected zone, while laser welded blanks failed in the base metal. The mash seam welds had a greater notch effect than the laser welds and thus lower fatigue strength under pulsating tensile stresses. The fatigue crack propagation in both the W-Car and MC-DI, with the zinc layer, exhibited intergranular cracking together with secondary cracks (Figure 5.10(a) and (b)). The presence of the zinc was confirmed by EDS analysis, as shown in Figure 5.11. For the GMX, without zinc coating, and the BM, the fatigue crack propagation was basically characterized by the fatigue striation-like features, as shown in Figure 5.12. EDS analysis revealed that the fracture surface in both the GMX and BM specimens was free of zinc layer. Figure 5.13. These SEM observations clearly indicated that the lower fatigue strength/limit in the galvanized W-Car and MC-DI TWBs is the consequence of intergranular cracking, caused by the zinc penetrating beneath the sheet surface. This conforms to the above mentioned findings that the surface condition is indeed one of the major factors affecting the fatigue life of materials.

Chapter 6 Conclusions
6.1 Summary

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the formability and fatigue strength of tailor welded blanks consisting of highly formable interstitial free and very low carbon steels. The experimental results yielded the following conclusions: 1. The microstructural examination of the weld cross-sections revealed that the welds were free of any significant amount of defects such as porosity, concavity, voids, inclusions or misalignments. This indicated that the welding parameters used for the TWBs are appropriate to obtain sound welds.

2. The microhardness of the weld bead after laser welding was approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the individual base metals constituting the TWBs. This is attributed to the fine pearlite and low carbon bainite structure in the weld metal as compared to the constituent base metals which showed the presence of equiaxed grains of ferrite.

3. With a careful selection of laser welding parameters and weld bead position, there is a very little likelihood of forming failure in the weld and/or the heataffected zone of the TWBs, indicating the soundness in the weld quality. The forming failures occurred in the thinner section, indicating that the formability of the TWBs is basically dependent on that of the thinner sheet.

4. A semi-empirical relation is proposed to calculate the FLDo (tob) value based on the North American Deep Drawing Equation, the mean value of the strainhardening exponents (niwe) and the mean value of the thicknesses (t-rwe) of the base metals, which can be expressed as, 78

The FLDo results of the TWBs calculated using this equation are in good agreement with the experimentally determined FLDo values. 5. For the selected grades of steel, it is found that the FLDo's of the TWBs are in-between those of the individually formed sheets of the TWBs. This is attributed to the use of better lubrication and a balanced clamping force that increased the limit strains leading to the increase in the FLDo value of the TWBs.

6

. The fatigue limit of the bare TWB was found to be about 1.4 times higher than that of the galvanized TWBs.

7. Fatigue fracture was observed to occur always in the thinner sheet of the TWBs. However, the location of the fracture seemed to vary due to the stress concentration induced by the difference in the thicknesses of the sheets. The thickness difference for the W-Car and MC-DI TWBs was at least 1.5 times more than that of the GMX TWB. The failure in the W-Car and MC-DI TWBs was relatively close to the weld bead whereas for GMX TWB the failure always occurred away from the weld.

8

. The fatigue crack propagation in the base metal (BM) and bare GMX TWB was mainly characterized by fatigue striations, whereas the galvanized TWBs exhibited intergranular cracking caused by the presence of zinc penetrating beneath the sheet surface. This is the major reason why the fatigue strength/limit of galvanized (W-Car and MC-DI) TWBs is much lower than that of bare (GMX) TWB.

6.2 Recommendations for Future Work

The present work was based on tailor welded blanks having similar material combinations in terms of grades of steels. Similar work can be carried out when two different types of steels like DP and IF are welded to form a tailor welded blank. With recent advances in the laser welding process, it is necessary to determine the effect of welding parameters and filler materials (if any) on the formability and fatigue properties of the weld bead. Also, the effect of various lubricants on the formability of tailor welded blanks can be analyzed using draw bead simulator test. It would be of interest to compare the forming results from the laboratory tests with an actual production part in terms of the weld bead location and different forming modes generated on the same stamping.

Appendix A

Sample calculations for determining the strain-hardening exponent (n-value) of the base metal (BM) of thickness 1.5 mm. The true stress and true strain to be substituted in Eq. 2.1 were calculated from the following equations [31]: True stress, a = S (1 + e), True strain, e = In (1 + e), (A.1 ) (A.2)

where S = Engineering stress, e = Engineering strain. The equation for the slope of the linear regression line for calculating the strainhardening exponent (n-value) is as follows:
