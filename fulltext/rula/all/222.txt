APPLICATION OF MATHIED FUNCTIONS AND THE POINT MATCHING METHOD TO ELLIPTIC CONDUCTORS Wisnu Wurjantara and Ali M. Hussein Department of ElectricalEngineering, Ryerson Polytechnic University, 350 Victoria St., Toronto, Ontario, M5B-2K3, Canada. Introduction Analysis of elliptic conductors, carrying a known total current, using the point matching method (PMM) in circular-cylinder coordinates [l] failed for the values of axes ratio b / a < 05, where a and b are the major and minor axes of the ellipse, respectively. This work shows that the use of elliptic-cylinder coordinates in conjunction with the point matching method overcomes this problem. This paper is a part of the work investigating the difficulties encountered in the point matching method, and is motivated by the fact that, despite its limitations, the method is still attractive as suggested by its use in recent papers [2]-141.

where p = The unknown coefficients C, ' s and B,'s are found by matching the tangential electric and magnetic fields, Ez, and Hp, at selected points on the conductor's surface. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the normalized magnitude and phase angle of E, on the conductor's surface for various values of axes ratio. For comparison, Fig. 4 shows the erroneous result obtained using the point matching method in circular-cylinder coordinates for b I a = 0.4. AH computations are carried out with a 16 = 5 where 6 is the skin depth. The distance d is measured from point A in the direcbon of the arrow AB (Fig. 1).

Fig.1. Cross section of an elliptic conductor. Fig. 1 shows the cross section of a long elliptic conductor with a total current I flowing in the +z direction with a time dependence of elu. The electric field in the conductor has only z -component, E,. The wave equation that E, has to satisfy can be solved in ellipticcylinder coordinates (17,~) to yield the expressions for the fields inside (a < 8,) and outside (a > a,) the conductor:
