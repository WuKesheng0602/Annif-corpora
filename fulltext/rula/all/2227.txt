ABSTRACT

Field   Study   of   a   Radiant   Heating   System   for   Sleep   Thermal   Comfort   and   Potential   Energy   Saving  
Christopher   Leung,   Kwong   Wang,   BASc   Master   of   Applied   Science,   Building   Science   2011   Ryerson   University   As   sleep   is   unconscious,   the   traditional   definition   of   thermal   comfort   with   conscious   judgment   does   not   apply.   In   this   thesis   sleep   thermal   comfort   is   defined   as   the   thermal   condition   which   enables   sleep   to   most   efficiently   rejuvenate   the   body   and   mind.    A   comfort   model   was   developed   to   simulate   the   respective   thermal   environment   required   to   achieve   the   desired   body   thermal   conditions   and   a   new   infrared   sphere   method   was   developed   to   measure   mean   radiant   temperature.   Existing   heating   conditions   according   to   building   code   conditions   during   sleeping   hours   was   calculated   to   likely   overheat   a   sleeping   person   and   allowed   energy   saving   potential   by   reducing   nighttime   heating   set   points.   Experimenting   with   existing   radiantly   and   forced   air   heated   residential   buildings,   it   was   confirmed   that   thermal   environment   was   too   hot   for   comfortable   sleep   and   that   the   infrared   sphere   method   shows   promise.   With   iii    

the   site   data,   potential   energy   savings   were   calculated   and   around   10%   of   energy   consumption   reduction   may   be   achieved   during   peak   heating.

Acknowledgements I   would   like   to   acknowledge   the   help   many   extraordinary   individuals   whom   have   helped   me   along   the   way   from   the   inception   to   the   completion   of   this   thesis.   I   would   like   to   thank   Dr.   Robert   Gaspar   for   teaching   me   the   curiosity   to   ask   the   question   why   and   educating   me   with   the   knowledge   and   tools   to   discover   the   answer.   I   would   like   to   commend   Mario   Kani   of   the   training   he   gave   me   to   become   an   engineer   and   the   introduction   into   many   building   science   issues   of   which   one   became   the   focus   of   this   thesis.   To   my   supervisor   Dr.   Hua   Ge,   I   am   very   grateful   for   the   many   hours   she   have   spent   discussing   and   guiding   my   thesis   along   and   the   use   of   her   home   as   an   alternative   test   location.   I   would   also   like   to   thank   Dr.   Zaiyi   Liao   and   Dr.   Miljana   Horvat   for   the   lease   of   their   equipment   and   consultation.

I   would   like   to   extend   my   gratitude   to   Mr.   Fred   Belusa   for   kindly   allowing   us   to   setup   the   field   study   in   his   home   and   Sustainable   EDGE   Ltd.   in   providing   the   mechanical   design   drawings   and   specification   documents.    To   my   colleagues   at   Ryerson   University,   I   would   like   to   thank   Rick   Wu   for   constantly   keeping   me   company   in   the   laboratory   and   the   many   discussions   we  

v   

have   had   to   resolve   many   of   the   deadlocks   which   occurred   during   the   research.   I   would   like   to   thank   Ian   Stahlbrand   for   giving   me   an   introductory   run   through   of   computational   fluid   dynamics   calculation   methods   with   Fluent   and   ICEM   and   Susan   Benjamin   and   Steve   Bibla   for   helping   me   proof   read   this   thesis.    There   are   many   researchers   past   and   present   whose   work   is   what   that   make   this   research   possible;   and   I   would   like   to   thank   them   and   the   many   friends   whom   I   have   consulted   at   various   stages   of   this   thesis.   This   includes   Stephen   Tung   whom   helped   me   debug   a   statistical   data   reduction   macro   which   saved   me   hours   of   data   analysis;   Junko   Shimomura,   Wynne   Tang,   Yogesh   Nandwani   and   the   many   more   whom   I   have   consulted   their   personal   sleep   thermal   preference.    Last   but   not   least,   I   would   like   to   thank   my   family   for   their   continued   support   throughout   my   pursuit   of   this   master   thesis   and   their   exceptional   patience   as   I   manipulated   the   building   set   point   to   test   various   theories.   I   especially   appreciate   my   mother   whom   was   willing   to   be   a   guinea   pig   by   sleeping   under   a   hastily   constructed   radiant   panel   I   have   constructed.

Introduction 
Background 

As   a   designer   of   radiant   ceiling   heating   systems,   the   author   received   reports   of   individuals   waking   up   in   the   middle   of   the   night   with   a   cold   sweat   while   sleeping   under   an   operating   radiant   ceiling   system.   These   radiant   ceiling   heating   systems   were   the   embedded   hydronic   type   designed   to   meet   the   Ontario   Building   Code   (Province   of   Ontario,   2006)   heating   requirements   of   an   indoor   air   temperature   of   22 Â° C   and   according   to   ASHRAE   handbook:   Systems   and   Equipment   (ASHRAE,   2008).   A   separate   ventilation   distribution   system   provides   ventilation   as   per   100%   outdoor   air   systems.    During   winter   operation,   the   radiant   heating   panel   temperature   may   reach   above   30 Â° C   during   the   on   cycle   and   gradually   decrease   back   to   room   temperature   during   the   off   cycle.   Thus,   a   residential   ceiling   radiant   system   differs   significantly   from   traditional   forced   air   or   radiator   system   in   which   both   the   radiator   and   the   forced   air   system   deliver   heat   via   natural   or   forced   convection   with   sufficiently   more   air   movement   than   a   radiant   ceiling   system.   As   such,   radiant   heating   systems   do   not   necessarily   follow   existing   thermal   comfort   standards   such   as   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010),   which   stipulates   that   dissimilar   vertical   ceiling/floor   radiant   field   should   not   exceed   5 Â° C.   Often,  

   

radiant   heating   systems   will   exceed   this   difference   to   meet   required   heating   output.    Existing   thermal   comfort   research   has   been   performed   on   the   awake   condition   with   people   wearing   typical   daily   attire   performing   daily   tasks.   These   include   researchers   in   North   America,   Europe   and   Asia   (Fanger,   Ipsen,   Langkilde,   Olesen,   Christensen,   &   Tanabe,   1985);    (Atmaca,   Kaynakli,   &   Yigit,   2007);    (Imanari,   Omori,   &   Bogaki,   1999).   However,   the   sleep   thermal   comfort   criteria   have   not   been   sufficiently   explored.   The   sleep   thermal   comfort   condition   has   not   been   thoroughly   developed   by   building   scientists,   psychologists   and   physiologists.   The   inherent   differences   between   the   external   science   of   building   science   to   the   physical   and   mental   aspects   of   physiology   and   psychology   of   the   human   body   meant   that   research   produced   independently   by   one   generally   does   not   enter   sufficient   detail   into   the   other   aspects.   This   is   also   true   regarding   terminology   which   overlaps,   but   is   inconsistent   (Bakken,   1980).   Coupled   with   the   generally   accepted   definition   of   thermal   comfort   which   explicitly   defines   that   the   mind   expresses   satisfaction   in   a   conscious   state,   there   is   not   a   coherent   method   of   determining   sleep   thermal   comfort.   Utilizing   existing   research   on   sleep   efficiency,   limiting   this   research   to   a   steady   state   condition   and   filling   many   of   the   voids   in  between   the   available   knowledge   by   educated   guesses,   the   author   has   developed   a   thermal   model   to   2   

calculate   the   thermal   condition   that   are   comfortable   for   sleep.   A   simple   numeric   calculation   of   the   radiant   ceiling   condition   has   been   developed   and   will   be   utilized   to   create   the   parameter   for   a   heating   system   to   be   operated   at   during   hours   of   sleep   and   be   the   basis   of   an   investigation   into   potential   energy   savings.  

1.2.

Research  Direction 

The   purpose   of   this   research   is   to   investigate   and   document   the   thermal   environment   a   typical   radiant   heated   residential   building   will   create   in   relation   to   the   concept   of   sleep   thermal   comfort,   where   the   existing   thermal   environment   created   will   be   compared   to   existing   thermal   comfort   standards   and   other   research.   The   activities   of   a   person   at   home   are   very   much   different   than   a   person   at   office   work   where   thermal   comfort   standards   are   typically   derived.   According   to   the   Bureau   of   Labor   Statistics   (United   States   Department   of   Labor,   2008)   it   was   found   that   on   average   a   person   at   home   spends   roughly   1.73   hours   doing   chores,   3   hours   doing   leisure   activities   and   8.6   hours   sleeping.    Since   sleeping   represents   a   significant   proportion   of   the   time   spent   at   home   it   is   important   to   explore   more   fully   the   conditions   for   sleep   thermal   comfort    and   to   determine   the   thermal   environment   a   heating   system   will   have   to   create   to   achieve   it.  

3   

The   physiological   and   psychological   aspects   of   sleep   during   various   stages   are   inherently   variable   and   while   HVAC   systems   may   be   modulated   to   compensate   for   these   changes,   it   is   unfeasible   to   create   a   thermal   environment   for   each   occupant.   Additionally,   physiological   and   psychological   responses   to   the   thermal   environment   during   sleep   have   not   been   clearly   established.   Therefore,   the   focus   of   this   research   will   be   based   on   a   steady   state   thermal   condition   to   provide   the   optimized   sleep   thermal   comfort.    In   summary   this   research   will   investigate   the   thermal   comfort   aspect   of   radiant   heating,   the   definition   of   thermal   comfort   during   sleep,   the   potential   energy   savings   by   reducing   system   output   and   the   development   of   tools   to   better   measure   the   thermal   environment.   

1.3.

Objectives 

The   objectives   of   this   research   are   to:   1. Determine   the   thermal   conditions   for   sleep   thermal   comfort.   2. Develop   a   fast   acting   mean   radiant   temperature   determination   tool.   3. Explore   the   potential   energy   savings   in   association   with   improving   sleep   thermal   comfort.

4. Compare   the   thermal   environment   created   by   a   radiant   heating   system   and   a   forced   air   system   according   to   the   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010)   requirements.   Comfortable   sleep   or   quality   of   sleep   contribute   significantly   to   the   performance   and   productivity   of   a   person   after   he   or   she   wakes   up   (Haskell,   Palca,   Walker,   Berger,   &   Heller,   1981)and   thus   is   of   significant   importance.    Existing   literature   recognizes   the   reduction   of   metabolism   during   sleep   and   the   need   to   decrease   body   core   temperature.   This   differs   significantly   from   the   human   state   which   existing   thermal   comfort   standards   were   developed   and   as   such   the   sleep   thermal   comfort   condition   is   specifically   excluded   from   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010).    This   research   aims   to   develop   the   sleep   thermal   criteria   and   develop   a   simplified   comfort   model.   This   is   much   more   of   a   concern   in   radiant   ceiling   heated   buildings   as   the   person   asleep   lying   down   will   directly   face   the   radiant   panel   on   the   ceiling.   A   field   test   will   be   performed   in   a   ceiling   radiant   heated   building   and   the   results   will   be   analyzed.    During   sleep,   metabolism   rate   and   core   temperature   requirements   will   reduce.   Coupled   with   the   significantly   increased   clothing   (a   blanket)   level   during   sleep,   these   conditions   suggest   that   there   will   be   possible   heating   output   reduction   of   the   heating   system   to   meet   the   comfort   requirements.   With   the   comfort   model  

5   

and   the   field   data,   the   energy   consumption   reduction   can   be   calculated   and   simulated.    As   radiant   heating   systems   are   marketed   as   fast   acting   with   heat   transfer   via   radiation   being   instantaneous,   it   is   important   that   the   deployed   sensors   have   a   fast   enough   response   to   record   the   thermal   environment   as   it   is   being   created   or   changed.    The   existing   method   of   determining   mean   radiant   temperature   by   the   black   globe   setup   as   per   ISO   7726   (ISO,   2002)   has   a   latency   of   around   30   minutes.   This   is   considered   insufficient   and   an   alternative   sensor   needs   to   be   developed.   To   test   the   new   sensor,   an   additional   field   test   in   another   building   heated   by   forced   air   will   be   completed   as   verification.   Many   studies   such   as   (Chen,   1990)   have   found   radiant   heating   to   be   more   comfortable   than   traditional   systems   such   as   forced   air   or   high   temperature   radiator   systems.   With   field   testing   of   two   buildings,   one   heated   radiantly   and   the   other   by   forced   air,   a   limited   comparison   could   be   made   of   the   thermal   comfort   level   with   the   collected   field   data   although   the   envelope   of   the   two   buildings   are   vastly   different.

The   background,   research   direction   and   objectives   are   discussed   and   summarized   in   the   previous   sections   of   Chapter   1.0.   Chapter   2.0   reviews   6   

existing   standards,   modeling   principles   and   field   studies   in   the   fields   of   thermal   comfort,   sleep   and   experimental   equipment.    With   the   insights   outlined   in   chapter   2.0   the   development   of   the   thermal   model   is   discussed   in   chapter   3.0.   The   sleep   thermal   criteria   as   extrapolated   from   Chapter   2.0   are   summarized   and   are   inputted   into   the   thermal   model.   The   results   from   the   thermal   model   are   discussed   and   compared   to   similar   research.    Chapter   4.0   presents   the   necessity   of   developing   a   mean   radiant   sensor   and   discusses   the   theory   for   its   operation.   Chapter   5.0   discusses   the   experimental   design   and   equipment   setup.   The   experimental   results   regarding   thermal   comfort,   sleep   thermal   comfort   and   the   performance   of   new   mean   radiant   temperature   sensor   is   presented   in   chapter   6.0.    Chapter   7.0   consists   of   an   idealized   calculation   of   potential   energy   savings   if   the   mechanical   system   was   operated   at   a   reduced   level   to   achieve   desire   sleep   comfort   conditions.

Literature  Review 

The   common   and   accepted   definition   of   thermal   comfort   as   developed   by   Fanger   (Fanger   P.   ,   1970)   and   adopted   by   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010)   is   the   " condition   of   mind   which   expresses   satisfaction   with   the   thermal   environment   and   is   assessed   by   subjective   evaluation"   and   is   determined   by   established   thermal   comfort   components:   Mean   Radiant   Temperature,   Air   Dry   Bulb   Temperature,   Metabolic   Rate,   Clothing   Insulation,   Air   Velocity   and   Humidity.    As   thermal   comfort   is   a   subjective   evaluation,   it   has   been   extensively   studied   by   Fanger   and   others   about   people   who   are   awake   in   laboratory   conditions.   As   a   subjective   evaluation,   the   thermal   comfort   for   people   who   are   asleep,   sedated   or   unconscious   is   undefined   and   under  researched.   Research   from   psychology   and   physiology   has   identified   internal   body   conditions   that   are   favorable   for   efficient   sleep   such   as   core   and   distal   temperature   requirements.   But   these   conditions   were   derived   without   a   clear   connection   to   the   thermal   environment.    This   chapter   explores   existing   thermal   comfort   standards   and   identifies   existing   research   into   thermal   comfort   for   the   awake   condition.    From   the   psychological   and   physiological   perspective,   it   reviews   the   body   thermal   condition   for   comfortable   sleep   and   combines   its   conditions   with   the   thermal   environment.

Thermal  Comfort  Standards

Existing   thermal   comfort   standards   for   awake   conditions   such   as   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010)   and   ISO   EN7726   (ISO,   2002)   are   based   on   Fanger's   studies.   ASHRAE   55   will   be   used   to   evaluate   the   thermal   comfort   level   achieved   by   the   radiant   heated   building   and   the   forced   air   heated   building.   2.2. Thermal  Environment  Comfort  Criteria 

Thermal   comfort   criteria   for   awake   as   defined   by   ASHRAE   Standard   55  2004   (ASHRAE,   2010)   are:   1. Allowable   radiant   asymmetry:   5%   percent   dissatisfied,   4 Â° C   2. Allowable   air   temperature   stratification:   5%   percent   dissatisfied,   air   temperature   between   head   and   feet   less   than   3 Â° C    3. Allowable   floor   temperature   range:   19 Â° C  29 Â° C   4. Allowable   operative   temperature:   20%   percent   dissatisfied    5. Allowable   peak   to   peak   variation   in   operative   temperature:   1.1Â°C   6. Allowable   ramp   and   drift   in   operative   temperature:

Existing  Radiant  Thermal  Comfort  Research 

To   establish   radiant   thermal   comfort   condition   for   persons   who   are   awake,   Fanger   et   al   (Fanger,   Banhidi,   B.W.Olesen,   &   Langkilde,   1980)   used   16   human   subjects   to   calibrate   a   thermal   manikin,   which   was   then   used   for   further   experiment.   It   was   found   that   a   radiant   asymmetry   of   4 Â° C   was    the   threshold   at   which   5%   of   their   test   subjects   became    uncomfortable.   However,   the   experiment   was   performed   at   a   thermally   neutral   state   where   the   air   temperature   was   reduced   when   the   radiant   ceiling   panel   temperature   was   increased   to   obtain   a   uniform   operative   temperature.   As   such   the   discomfort   due   to   the   radiant   ceiling   is   attributed   to   the   feeling   of   cold   feet   due   to   the   reduced   air   temperature.    10    

The   comfort   model   developed   by   Fanger   et   al   is   not   representative   of   radiant   heating   systems   operated   to   building   code   (Province   of   Ontario,   2006)   compliance,   which   is   based   on   maintaining   an   air   temperature   of   22 Â° C   for   heating.   The   air   temperature   will   not   be   lowered   to   achieve   the   desired   operative   temperature   and   therefore   the   feeling   of   cold   feet   by   reduced   air   temperature   may   not   occur.    If   the   building   envelope   is   well   insulated   with   minimal   leakage,   the   radiant   output   will   be   sufficient   to   heat   the   surrounding   surfaces   which   in   turn   increase   the   temperature   of   the   air   meaning   that   the   air   temperature   will   be   very   close   to   the   mean   radiant   temperature.    As   a   continuation   of   their   previous   study,   Fanger   et   al   (Fanger,   Ipsen,   Langkilde,   Olesen,   Christensen,   &   Tanabe,   1985)   attempted   to   study   the   effects   of   radiant   asymmetry   and   discovered   that   ceiling   heating   causes   the   most   thermal   discomfort   for   a   person   who   is   conscious   and   seated.   However,   as   discussed   earlier   asymmetric   radiant   heating   will   cause   cold   sensation   on   the   other   side   of   the   body   and   that   the   magnitude   of   discomfort   documented   for   heated   ceilings   are   in   part   caused   by   the   cold   feet   sensation   of   the   test   subjects.    Their   findings   are   incorporated   into   the   thermal   comfort   standards   such   as   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010).   The   standard   claims   that   average   air   velocity   may   be   increased   to   offset   operative   temperature   increases   and   the   average   air   velocity   should   be   0.8   m/s   or   less.   This   also   brings   out   another   perspective   of   11    

thermal   comfort;   thermal   sensation   of   each   body   part   is   different   and   may   be   more   significant   during   sleep   when   the   head   of   the   subject   is   exposed   while   the   body   is   generally   covered   with   bedding.   Many   researchers   have   approached   radiant   heating   systems   by   comparing   its   comfort   criterion   and   energy   performance   to   traditional   systems   such   as   forced   or   free   convection.   Qingyan   Chen   (Chen,   1990)   reviewed   the   said   systems   and   performed   a   subsequent   indoor   particulate   and   energy   simulation.   The   results   obtained   by   Chen   were   not   entirely   representative   of   current   realistic   systems   because   forced   air   was   the   primary   system,   with   the   radiant   system   operating   as   a   secondary   heating   system.   The   ventilation   rate   used   was   in   the   vicinity   of   1.0   ACH   instead   of   the   0.33   ACH   as   designed   in   current   buildings.   However   the   indoor   particulate   simulation   may   be   indicative   as   the   reduction   of   ventilation   air   was   found   to   be   proportional   in   the   three   cases   tested   by   Chen   (Chen,   1990).   It   was   found   that   the   forced   air   heating   system   had   generally   worse   particulate   concentration   due   to   the   re  circulating   nature   of   the   system.   Thus   it   suggests   that   particulate   concentration   of   a   radiant   system   should   not   be   worse   than   a   traditional   forced   air   system.   Similarly,   Z.   Zhang   et   al    (Zhang   &   Pate,   1986)   performed   field   measurements   and   experimentation   in   a   research   house   with   dual   force   air   and   radiant   ceiling   heating.   It   was   found   that   the   room   air   temperature   followed   quite   closely   to   the   radiant   ceiling   heating   cycle   and   did   not   lag   in   response.   The   experimental   12    

study   suggested   that   the   radiant   ceiling   successfully   warmed   the   floor,   which   in   turn   heated   the   air   convectively   providing   a   thermal   stratification   less   extreme   than   via   traditional   forced   air   systems.   The   radiant   distribution   was   found   to   be   fairly   uniform   and   the   radiant   panels   achieved   thermal   comfort   for   the   occupants.    Similar   to   the   research   performed   by   Fanger   et   al.,   Imanari   et   al   (Imanari,   Omori,   &   Bogaki,   1999)   experimented   and   simulated   radiant   ceiling   heating   and   cooling   systems   in   Tokyo.   A   total   of   74   subjects   were   hired   to   participate   in   two   sets   of   experiments   in   a   room   set   up   with   a   radiant   and   forced   air   system.   Following   the   methods   as   proposed   by   Fanger   et   al.   and   by   the   PMV   thermal   comfort   scaling,   it   was   discovered   that   72%   of   the   participant   found   radiant   ceiling   cooling   comfortable   compared   to   55%   for   traditional   forced   air   system.   Although   the   participant   who   found   radiant   ceiling   heating   comfortable   is   lower   at   around   38%,   a   similar   relationship   is   established   with   forced   air   heating   where   only   35%   of   the   participant   felt   comfortable.   If   neutral   sensations   were   included,   this   will   be   90%   and   82%   respectively.   This   also   indicates   that   people   are   more   sensitive   to   heat   gain   as   more   people   found   cooling   to   be   more   comfortable   than   heating.   A   simulation   of   the   radiant   heating   system   was   performed   for   a   floor   in   an   office   building   in   Tokyo   by   Imanari   et   al.   (Imanari,   Omori,   &   Bogaki,   1999);   it   was   found   that   over   the   course   of   a   year,   radiant   heated   and   cooled   ceiling   13    

systems   used   roughly   10%   less   energy   than   traditional   systems   of   the   same   technology   level.   However,   more   savings   shall   be   possible   given   the   advances   in   our   understanding   of   thermal   comfort   and   the   subsequent   development   of   controls.   Others   such   as   McIntyre   and   Griffiths   (McIntyre   &   Friffiths,   1972)   tried   to   establish   the   heat   sensory   relationship   between   radiative   temperature   and   air   temperature.   Sixteen   male   subjects   were   exposed   to   several   thermal   conditions   in   which   the   radiant   and   air   temperatures   were   varied.   A   questionnaire   with   Fanger's   seven  point   comfort   scale   was   utilized   and   a   regression   analysis   of   the   results   established   that   the   subjects   were   more   sensitive   to   air   temperature   where   if   there   is   a   decrease   of   1 Â° C   in   air   temperature,   a   rise   of   1.5 Â° C   of   radiant   temperature   is   required   to   achieve   the   same   thermal   sensation.   Coupled   with   the   lower   heat   transfer   coefficient   for   convective   heat   transfer   in   relatively   still   air   of   3.1   W/(m 2 K)   and   4.0   W/(m 2 K)   to   roughly   4.7   W/(m 2 K)   for   radiative   heat   transfer   (ASHRAE,   2009)   it   means   that   a   radiant   system   will   be   inherently   less   disturbing   than   a   forced   air   system   for   the   same   heating   load;   as   less   radiant   temperature   difference   is   required   for   the   same   heating   output   as   forced   air   temperature   difference.   Note   that   Mcintyre   et   al.   (McIntyre   &   Friffiths,   1972)   research   is   based   on   thermal   sensation   which   is   not   thermal   comfort   or   thermal   neutrality.   Thermal   sensation   is   inversely   proportional   to   thermal   comfort   as   the   greater   the   14    

thermal   sensation   will   result   in   less   thermal   comfort.   It   was   also   noted   that   the   subjects   felt   a   decrease   in   freshness   with   the   increase   of   both   radiant   and   air   temperature.   Although   the   experiments   show   a   slight   freshness   feeling   in   favor   to   radiant   system,   the   difference   is   small   and   the   sample   size   is   insufficient   to   conclusively   prove   this.   Similarly,   Toftum   (Toftum,   2002)   confirms   that   increased   temperature   promote   heightened   sensation   to   noise,   air   quality   and   discomfort.   In   his   review   of   5656   set   of   ASHRAE   field   data   on   draft   movement,   it   was   found   that   about   40%   of   people   preferred   more   air   movement   even   when   they   feel   cool.   This   holds   true   where   air   movement   is   less   than   0.00   m/s   to   0.25   m/s.   It   was   also   noted   that   a   sedated   person   is   much   more   sensitive   to   draught,   and   hence   to   a   forced   air   system.    In   summary,   existing   research   and   practices   have   determined   that   radiant   heated   systems   can   often   provide   relatively   instantaneous   heating   and   cooling;   and   is   more   energy   efficient   as   an   overall   heating   system   while   also   being   less   disturbing   to   the   recipients.   However,   existing   research   has   a   focus   on   the   awake   condition   and   there   was   no   thermal   comfort   standard   to   deal   specifically   with   sleep   and   radiant   temperature.   A   more   fundamental   understanding   of   sleep   efficiency   and   thermal   comfort   from   the   psychological   and   physiological   stand   point   shall   be   investigated.

Sleep  Thermal  Regulation  and  Thermal  Comfort 
15  

 

Many   studies   have   been   completed   on   the   thermal   environment   implication   to   psychological   and   physiological   responses.   Most   are   in   relation   to   medical   conditions   or   necessities,   such   as   sleep   deprivation   thermal   regulatory   changes   (Savourey   &   Bittel,   1994)   and   thus   needs   to   be   interpreted   against   thermal   comfort   criteria.    Current   defined   criteria   for   steady   state   thermal   comfort   include   specific   requirements   for   air   temperature,   radiant   temperature,   air   velocity,   humidity,   clothing   level   and   metabolic   rate.   Here,   air   temperature   includes   air   temperature   stratification   and   radiant   temperature   includes   radiant   asymmetry   and   indoor   air   quality.   Additional   criteria   include   state   of   mind,   draft,   noise   and   indoor   lighting.   If   the   definition   of   thermal   comfort   is   broadened,   it   has   the   connotation   of   the   thermal   condition   which   the   person   may   perform   work   most   efficiently   at   the   least   fatigue   and   that   is   thermally   neutral.   As   the   purpose   of   sleep   can   be   seen   as   a   phase   of   our   daily   cycle   to   allow   our   body   to   rest   and   our   mind   to   reset;   thus   for   sleep,   thermal   comfort   can   be   taken   to   mean   the   condition   which   best   allows   sleep   to   occur   and   rejuvenate   the   body   and   mind.   Considering   thermal   condition   on   sleep   quality,   Candas   et   al   (Candas,   Libert,   &   Muzt,   1982)researched   transient   thermal   conditions   on   Slow   Wave   Sleep   (SWS)   and   Rapid   Eye   Movement   (REM)   stages   of   sleep.   Over   a   period   of   5   days,   five   semi  nude   male   subjects   slept   in   a   weather   chamber   kept   at   an   operative   16    

temperature   of   32 Â° C   and   an   air   temperature   of   25 Â° C.   The   air   temperature   was   increased   to   41 Â° C   or   decreased   to   28.5 Â° C   during   each   specific   stage   of   sleep   and   the   subject   skin   temperature   and   response   was   recorded.    It   was   found   that   in   50%   of   all   cases   when   a   skin   warming   of   0.8 Â° C   was   detected   the   subjects   woke   up.   While   for   sleep   interruption   such   as   a   sleep   stage   change,   during   the   period   of   skin   warming,   30%   of   the   subjects   were   interrupted   by   the   heat   during   SWS   and   66%   of   the   subjects   were   interrupted   during   REM.   The   amount   of   interruption   was   found   to   be   similar   when   the   operative   temperature   was   increased   by   1.6 Â° C/min   or   decreased   by   0.8 Â° C/min,   suggesting   that   sleep   termination   was   more   of   a   state   function   than   a   path   function.   In   the   small   scale   experiment   conducted   by   Candas   et   al.,   there   are   insufficient   data   to   conclude   what   temperature   increase   caused   the   change   in   sleep   condition   as   there   were   instances   where   no   sleep   condition   changed   even   when   1.2 Â° C   of   temperature   rise   was   detected   on   the   skin.   This   research   also   supports   the   notion   that   cooling   is   the   main   source   of   discomfort   during   sleep   where   it   questions   Fanger's   4 Â° C   radiant   asymmetry   limit   as   it   is   based   on   a   subsequent   reduced   air   temperature   with   radiant   temperature   increase   to   maintain   a   uniform   operative   temperature.   Note   that   the   temperature   increase   ramp   in   Candas   et   al.   research   is   significantly   higher   than   the   allowable   ramp   of   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010)   of   1.1 Â° C/15min.

Candas   et   al   induced   the   thermal   conditioning   via   forced   convection,   which   differs   from   radiant   heating,   however   their   documentation   is   via   skin   temperature,   which   is   affected   more   instantaneously   by   radiant   heating,   thus   the   suggestion   that   rapid   temperature   change   will   induce   sleep   thermal   discomfort   should   be   applicable   in   this   research.   Other   research   into   sleep   quality   and   thermal   conditioning   utilized   a   sleep   efficiency   index   to   gauge   how   good   sleep   is   under   two   thermal   environments.   Okamoto  Mizuno   et   al   (Okamoto  Mizuno,   Tsuzuki,   Mizuno,   &   Iwakic,   2005)   experimented   with   16   subjects   and   subjected   them   to   two   environments   over   a   period   of   several   months   in   a   climate   chamber.    The   first   environment   the   subjects   were   exposed   to   involved   a   typical   warm   environment   of   26 Â° C   at   50%   RH   and   was   transited   to   a   hot   humid   condition   of   32 Â° C   at   80%   RH   during   mid  sleep.    The   second   environment   was   the   reverse   where   subjects   were   exposed   to   a   condition   of   32 Â° C   at   80%   RH   and   transited   to   an   environment   of   26 Â° C   at   50%   RH   during   mid  sleep.   Although   the   change   in   relative   humidity   will   not   change   as   such   with   a   radiant   heating   system,   this   research   may   be   of   importance   as   Okamoto  Mizuno   et   al   found   that   subjects   had   a   higher   sleep   efficiency   index   during   the   environment   where   the   warm   condition   was   transited   to   the   hot   and   humid   condition.   This   finding   is   in   agreement   with   research   presented   by   Lack   et   al   (Lack,   Gradisar,   Someren,   Wright,   &   Lushington,   2008)   where   the   body   18    

needs   to   dissipate   heat   prior   to   entering   sleep.   In   both   environments   during   the   hot   and   humid   condition,   the   sleep   efficiency   index   decreased.    Bischof   et   al   (Bischof,   Madsen,   Clausen,   Madsen,   &   Wildschodtz,   1993)   preformed   a   pilot   study   in   microclimate   within   a   bed   for   thermal   comfort   during   sleep   when   conscious   thermal   control   such   as   removing   article   of   clothing   or   adjusting   the   indoor   temperature   is   unavailable.   Five   test   subjects   were   subjected   to   various   conditions   such   as   spot   cooling   on   the   head   and   different   levels   of   clothing.   It   was   found   that   for   the   subjects,   the   comfort   regime   is   with   a   skin   temperature   of   approximately   32.5Â°C   with   Fanger's   PMV   measurements.   This   skin   temperature   value   is   also   similar   to   those   found   by   Huang   (Huang,   2008)   between   31.5Â°C   to   32.9Â°C.   It   was   also   found   that   the   motoric   level   of   a   person   during   sleep   can   be   strikingly   different   during   different   sleep   periods   and   that   localized   skin   temperature   of   a   person   may   be   significantly   different.   Sleep   comfort   was   found   to   be   more   comfortable   with   a   lower   temperature   during   the   evening   prior   to   sleep.    Based   on   percentage   of   stage  3   and   stage  4   sleep   and   the   percentage   of   rapid   eye   movement   sleep,   this   paper   established   that   the   thermal   climate   outside   of   the   immediate   micro   climate   zone   is   largely   irrelevant   to   thermal   comfort.   By   the   PMV   measurements,   Percentage   of   REM   and   percentage   of   stage  3   and  

19    

stage  4   sleep   all   suggest   a   skin   temperature   of   35Â°C   or   more   will   cause   discomfort   and   reduction   in   the   quality   of   sleep.    Bischof   et   al.   (Bischof,   Madsen,   Clausen,   Madsen,   &   Wildschodtz,   1993)   looked   at   transient   state   for   sleep   comfort   where   several   additional   factors   were   also   considered.   This   includes   rate   of   change   of   air   temperature,   rate   of   change   of   radiant   temperature.   Other   research   such   as   Lack   et   al.   (Lack,   Gradisar,   Someren,   Wright,   &   Lushington,   2008)   stresses   the   importance   of   pre   and   post   sleep   conditioning   such   as   helping   the   subject   fall   asleep   by   allowing   heat   to   dissipate   from   the   body.    Lack   et   al    (Lack,   Gradisar,   Someren,   Wright,   &   Lushington,   2008)   studied   the   requirement   of   sensible   heat   loss   from   the   distal   area   of   the   human   body   to   enter   sleep   and   the   correlation   between   core   body   temperature   and   different   types   of   insomnia.   Although   the   authors   were   unable   to   determine   if   insomnia   is   a   cause   or   effect   of   body   thermoregulation,   it   was   shown   that   during   sleep   the   body   core   temperature   drops   approximately   2Â°C.   Thirteen   subjects   with   different   insomnia   were   tested   and   that   subjects   with   Early   Morning   Awakening   insomnia   have   their   core   body   temperature   cycle   shifted   forward   while   subjects   with   Sleep   Onset   Insomnia   had   their   body   core   temperature   cycle   delayed.    Insomnia   from   hyper   arousal   was   also   explored   and   subjects   were   found   to   have   higher   core   temperature   and   lower   distal   temperatures   than   typical   good   sleepers.   This   research   reinforced   the   inverse   relationship   where   distal   20    

temperature   increase   promotes   core   temperature   decrease   suggesting   that   the   body   is   required   to   reject   core   heat   for   initiating   and   maintaining   good   quality   sleep.   It   is   argued   that   a   higher   core   temperature   represents   a   longer   sleep  wake   state,   and   thus   poorer   quality   of   sleep.    The   importance   of   heat   rejection   from   distal   areas   such   as   the   hands   and   the   feet   for   entering   good   sleep   was   discussed   and   concluded   to   be   the   primary   process   that   drives   the   circadian   rhythm   of   core   body   temperature   The   distal   area   skin   temperature   was   further   investigated   by   Sakoi   et   al   (Sakoia,   Tsuzuki,   Kato,   Ooka,   Song,   &   Zhu,   2007)   by   exposing   35   different   thermal   conditions   on   both   a   manikin   and   on   test   subjects   involving   different   air   temperatures,   relative   humidity   and   radiant   fields   on   a   seated   position.   It   was   found   that   thermal   comfort   on   the   head   is   dependent   on   both   the   skin   temperature   and   sensible   heat   loss   while   thermal   comfort   on   the   foot   is   only   dependent   on   skin   temperature.    The   experiment   by   Sakoi   et   al.   (Sakoia,   Tsuzuki,   Kato,   Ooka,   Song,   &   Zhu,   2007)   with   subjects   shows   a   trend   that   more   thermal   discomfort   on   the   head   is   reported   when   radiant   heating   is   applied   from   above   and   cooling   is   from   below   than   cooling   from   above   and   heating   from   below.    Similarly   a   preference   in   comfort   by   heating   from   the   front   of   the   body   and   cooling   from   the   back   is   established.   Regardless   of   radiant   heating   and   cooling   output,   thermal   comfort   via   skin   temperature   is   found   to   be   in   the   33.5Â°C   range   for   subjects   at   semi  21    

rest,   however   skin   temperature   was   not   found   to   necessarily   represent   thermal   comfort.   The   forehead   can   lose   up   to   80   W/m 2   without   the   person   feeling   discomfort;   this   is   in   general   agreement   with   Huang   (Huang,   2008)   who   suggest   that   soldiers   exposed   to   the   cold   outdoor   environment   were   comfortable   without   face   masks   when   sleeping   in   sleeping   bags,   except   for   more   extreme   environments.   Agreeing   with   prior   research,   it   was   found   that   the   subjects   find   less   discomfort   with   a   cold   ceiling   than   a   warm   one.   It   was   found   that   the   subjects   felt   the   most   comfortable   if   they   were   able   to   lose   around   36   W/m 2   of   sensible   energy   regardless   of   the   magnitude   of   the   radiant   field   asymmetry   tested.   This   is   similar   to   the   values   developed   for   sleeping   bags   from   soldiers   of   34.9   W/m 2   of   heat   loss   quoted   by   Huang   (Huang,   2008)   or   up   to   43.5   W/m 2   with   a   heat   debt   of   334.944   kJ.   The   radiant   temperature   differential   recorded   was   not   as   per   the   radiant   temperature   asymmetry   as   defined   by   Fanger   et   al   but   as   a   differential   to   the   room   air   temperature   without   a   view   factor   and   the   operative   temperature   was   not   kept   constant.   Their   human   experimentation   suggests   that   less   than   20%   of   the   subjects   was   uncomfortable   for   the   cold   floor   case   of   a   room   with   air   temperature   of   25.5 Â° C   where   the   ceiling   was   at   33.5 Â° C   and   the   floor   was   at   16.5 Â° C   (Â±8 Â° C);   and   for   the   warm   floor   case   where   the   air   temperature   was   at   28.0 Â° C   and   the   ceiling   was   at   14 Â° C   and   the   floor   was   at   42 Â° C   (Â±14 Â° C).    22    

Regarding   sleep   thermal   comfort,   being   asleep   differs   from   being   awake   by   the   inability   of   the   person   to   consciously   change   their   thermal   environment,   such   as   turning   on   a   fan,    or   putting   on   or   taking   off   an   article   of   clothing,   and   that   body   conditions   are   not   uniform   but   varies   during   different   stages   of   sleep.   Thus   unlike   thermal   comfort   while   awake,   it   is   unreasonable   to   assume   that   a   static   thermal   condition   will   provide   sleep   thermal   comfort.   Atmaca   et   al   (Atmaca,   Kaynakli,   &   Yigit,   2007)   researched   the   effect   of   radiant   heat   transfer   to   individual   body   parts   and   their   correlation   to   thermal   comfort   for   a   seated   person.   The   second   part   of   this   research   focused   on   simulating   the   internal   radiant   temperature   fields   of   building   envelopes   exposed   to   strong   solar   radiation.    Their   research   concludes   that   asymmetric   radiant   fields   cause   the   most   thermal   discomfort   for   a   person.   They   found   that   a   correlation   between   thermal   comfort   and   radiant   surface   to   room   air   temperature   differential   exist   and   that   thermal   comfort   measured   on   a   PMV   scale   is   a   function   of   skin   surface   temperature.    It   was   also   found   that   with   a   radiant   surface   temperature   of   12Â°C   above   ambient   average   room   air   temperature,   the   warming   effect   is   noticeable.   Similarly,   it   was   found   that   typically   a   skin   heated   to   a   temperature   of   33.6Â°C   via   radiant   heating   will   show   the   same   level   of   warm   feeling.   Exposed   skin   had  

23    

been   found   to   have   the   greatest   temperature   distortions   compared   to   the   clothed   portion   of   the   body.    Based   on   equivalent   physiological   response   to   thermal   conditions   of   conscious   and   unconscious   humans   and   a   uniform   sleep   comfort   condition,   Z.   Lin   and   S.   Deng   (Lin   &   Deng,   2008)   developed   a   model   to   predict   sleep   thermal   comfort.   Their   model   predicted   that   a   neutral   radiant   and   air   temperature   of   29.6 Â° C   will   provide   a   naked   person   sleep   thermal   comfort   while   with   typical   sleep   attire,   the   neutral   temperature   drops   to   24.2 Â° C.   This   agrees   well   with   previous   experimental   studies   by   others.    In   summary,   it   was   found   that   during   sleep,   the   skin   and   core   temperature   of   a   person   is   much   more   dynamic   than   that   of   a   person   who   is   awake.   This   may   invalidate   the   typical   steady   state   heat   transfer   model   used   in   building   science   research.    Recognizing   that   building   heating   systems   will   not   likely   be   operated   as   per   for   a   single   person,   the   skin   temperature   value   of   32.5 Â° C   will   be   accepted   as   the   thermal   condition   at   which   sleep   will   be   sufficiently   efficient   and   a   heat   loss   rate   of   36   W/m 2   found   to   be   comfortable   for   sedated   persons   will   be   assumed   to   hold   true   for   sleeping   persons.

Localized  Body  Response  to  Thermal  Environment 

24    

Sleeping   in   a   radiant   ceiling   heated   environment   will   expose   a   person's   face   directly   to   the   radiant   panel   while   the   body   will   be   covered   with   covering   of   high   insulation   value,   thus   logically,   the   exposed   body   parts   will   participate   more   in   heat   transfer   than   the   covered   parts.   Huizenga   et   al   (Huizenga,   Zhang,   Arens,   &   Wang,   2004)   studied   109   human   subjects   about   their   core   and   distal   temperatures   with   localized   body   part   being   heated   or   cooled   by   the   means   of   forced   air   via   ventilated   sleeves.   It   was   found   that   in   a   thermally   neutral   environment,   heating   or   cooling   of   distal   areas   of   the   body   such   as   the   hands   will   promote   an   inverse   effect   on   the   temperature   of   the   person's   core,   while   heating   or   cooling   the   core   area   of   the   body   directly   will   promote   positive   correlation   in   core   temperature   rise   and   fall.   The   face   of   the   subjects   were   found   to   be   the   most   sensitive   to   localized   heating   or   cooling   and   produces   instantaneous   response   in   core   temperature   compared   to   several   minutes   of   lag   for   other   distal   areas   such   as   the   hands.   Although   the   experiments   were   performed   with   forced   air   instead   of   radiant   system,   the   body's   reaction   to   localized   distal   and   core   tempering   is   likely   to   be   similar.

Thermal  Modeling  between  the  Body  and  the  Thermal  Environment 

There   are   two   types   of   thermal   models   that   are   widely   used;   these   are   the   single   node   model   and   the   two   node   model.   The   single   node   model   is   suggested   by   ASHRAE   Fundamentals   (ASHRAE,   2009)   and   have   been   widely   used   25    

by   researchers   such   as   (Goldman,   1988)(Holand,   1999)   and   was   originally   proposed   by   Fanger   in   (Fanger   P.   ,   1970)   It   treats   the   human   body   as   a   single   finite   unit   with   heat   transfer   acting   directly   on   its   surfaces.   The   two   node   models   for   heat   transfer   assumes   the   human   body   as   two   concentric   mass   of   flesh   each   as   one   node   with   the   outer   layer   representing   the   skin   and   distal   area   of   the   body   while   the   center   representing   the   core   of   the   body.   Notable   two   node   models   include   the   improved   Pierces   model   developed   by   Gagge   (Gagge,   Stolwijk,   &   and   Nishi,   1971)   and   the   Kansas   State   University   model   (Azer,   1977).   Both   models   have   been   expanded   from   a   single   body   to   segregated   bodies   to   represent   limbs   for   a   better   representation   of   the   actual   human   body.   The   two   node   model   should   give   better   results   but   because   of   the   lack   of   knowledge   regarding   how   the   human   body   responds   during   sleep,   it   could   not   be   employed   with   confidence.  

2.7.

Mean  Radiant  Temperature 

The   mean   radiant   temperature   requires   special   attention   as   it   is   inherently   very   hard   to   determine.   The   mean   radiant   temperature   concept   as   first   suggested   by   Korsgaard   (Korsgaard,   1949)   has   been   adopted   by   ASHRAE   (ASHRAE,   2010)   and   EN   ISO   (ISO,   2002)   as   an   index   of   the   thermal   environment   within   a   room   or   a   space.      

26    

ASHRAE   Fundamentals   (ASHRAE,   2009)has   defined   the   mean   radiant   temperature   as:   " the   uniform   temperature   of   an   imaginary   enclosure   in   which   radiant   heat   transfer   from   the   human   body   equals   the   radiant   heat   transfer   in   the   actual   nonuniform   enclosure ".   Radiant   heat   transfer   is   in   the   long   wave   spectrum   and   the   requirement   of   the   human   body   means   that   the   mean   radiant   temperature   is   location   specific.    There   are   two   accepted   approaches   to   determine   the   actual   mean   radiant   temperature.   The   first   is   the   black   globe   method   and   the   second   is   the   surface   temperature   method.    2.7.1. Black  Globe  Thermometer 

The   black   globe   thermometer   method   of   determining   mean   radiant   temperature   has   been   well   established   (T.   BEDFORD   &   C.   G.   WARNER,   1934)   and   was   quoted   by   ASHRAE   fundamentals   (ASHRAE,   2009).   The   black   globe   thermometer   is   originally   a   copper   water   closet   float   sphere   painted   black   with   a   thermometer   inserted   in   the   center.    The   black   globe   was   found   to   be   representative   of   the   view   factor   ratio   of   a   human   body   and   the   relationship   of   the   globe   temperature   and   the   mean   radiant   temperature   given   by:

The   globe   temperature   was   found   to   be   representative   of   the   operative   temperature   for   a   person   who   is   seated   (ASHRAE,   2009).   However,   it   was   found   to   overly   weigh   ceiling   and   floor   radiant   exposures   for   a   standing   person   and   likewise   should   overly   weigh   the   floor   and   wall   exposures   in   the   case   of   a   reclined   person.    Derivative   and   configuration   of   the   Black   Globe   method   were   employed   to   remove   the   convective   component   of   the   heat   transfer   thus   eliminating   the   need   of   measuring   air   velocity   by   the   dual   globe   method.   This   method   (ISO,   2002)   utilizes   one   black   globe   and   one   polished   globe   where   the   polished   globe   is   used   as   the   representation   of   heat   transfer   due   to   convection.   The   other   variation   is   an   air   temperature   controlled   globe   used   to   eliminate   the   convective   heat   exchange   portion   of   the   heat   transfer   faces   similar   restrictions.  

28    

The   black   globe   is   known   to   overestimate   the   mean   radiant   temperature   in   the   cases   with   direct   sunlight   (ISO,   2002).   2.7.2. Surface  Temperature  Measurement  Approach 

The   other   method   requires   the   knowledge   of   the   surface   temperatures   and   the   calculation   of   view   factors   to   the   human   body.   The   mean   radiant   temperature   may   be   determined   by   the   following   equation   from   ASHRAE   Fundamentals:    Where;   MeanRadiantTemperature WallSurfaceTemperature ViewFactor K  K

The   surface   temperature   method   has   been   used   to   calibrate   black   globe   sensors   in   climatic   chambers   and   should   be   the   most   accurate   method   due   to   its   proximity   to   the   actual   definition   of   mean   radiant   temperature.   The   surface   temperatures   can   be   determined   by   an   array   of   surface   temperature   sensors,   or   by   mapped   infrared   cameras.   The   surface   temperature   method   requires   a   sufficient   amount   of   temperature   sensors   to   construct   an   accurate   depiction   of   the   surfaces   and   suffers   when   the   surfaces   have   irregular   temperature   gradients.   While   the   infrared   camera   approach   can   handle   more   complex   temperature   profiles,   infrared   cameras   are   much   more   expensive.   29    

The   view   factor   is   a   geometric   correlation   between   each   surface   and   the   human   body   and   is   dependent   on   the   position   of   the   person.   Being   a   spatial   function,   view   factor   can   be   described   as   the   ratio   of   heat   a   person   receives   in   the   direction   of   the   particular   surface   to   which   the   view   factor   corresponds.   View   factors   can   be   developed   by   partial   differential   equations   but   have   been   linearized   to   basic   room   shapes   by   Fanger   (Fanger   P.   ,   1970)   for   people   who   are   standing   and   for   people   who   are   seated.    Alternatively,   view   factor   can   be   determined   by   the   Nusselt   sphere   method   (Nusselt,   1928)   which   is   a   simpler   method   that   compares   the   projected   surface   area   of   the   specific   surfaces   onto   an   imaginary   sphere   located   over   the   host   object   to   the   sphere's   cross   sectional   area.   With   Nusselt's   view   factor   theory,   a   simple   photographic   method   on   a   polished   sphere   may   be   used   to   determine   view   factor.

Summary 

In   summary,   radiant   heating   systems   were   found   to   be   generally   more   comfortable   than   forced   air   systems.   However,   it   was   established   that   vertical   radiant   asymmetry   is   a   likely   cause   of   thermal   discomfort   in   radiant   heating   systems.   Existing   thermal   comfort   standards   were   found   to   specifically   exclude   the   sleep   condition.  

30    

The   sleep   thermal   comfort   was   explored   in   terms   of   human   thermal   regulation   and   its   cardiac   implications   at   different   stages.   It   is   inherently   complex   and   a   widely   accepted   understanding   is   unavailable   to   construct   an   accurate   model.    Researchers   have   analyzed   field   studies   data   and   simplified   the   model   to   a   steady   state   and   found   that   an   average   heat   loss   rate   of   36   W/m 2   at   a   skin   temperature   of   32.5Â°C   is   the   ideal   body   thermal   condition   to   provide   optimal   sleep   comfort.   Commonly   used   body   thermal   model,   the   single   node   and   two   node   model   were   explored.   Existing   steady   state   thermal   model   based   on   thermal   neutrality   was   found   not   to   be   a   good   representation   during   sleep   as   existing   literatures   established   that   for   sleep   thermal   comfort,   a   gain   or   deficit   of   heat   is   required   at   different   stages   of   sleep.    The   existing   tools   to   quantify   a   thermal   environment   were   reviewed   and   the   method   of   determining   mean   radiant   temperature   was   found   not   to   be   ideal   for   dynamic   building   system   control   and   measurement   due   to   its   significant   lag   of   30   minutes.

Heat  Transfer  Model 

The   heating   system   should   be   able   to   produce   the   ideal   thermal   environment   in   the   room   for   a   person   to   sleep   well.   To   determine   this   ideal   thermal   environment,   a   model   of   the   body's   thermal   environment   was   constructed   (body   model).   Conditions   for   optimal   comfortable   sleep   were   used   as   inputs   in   the   body   model   in   order   to   determine   the   room's   ideal   thermal   environment.   Finally,   room's   ideal   thermal   environment   was   used   as   input   data   to   engineer   the   heating   system   required.     The   main   requirement   is   for   the   total   heat   dissipation   by   a   body   to   be   36   W/m 2   and   that   the   skin   temperature   of   a   sleeping   person   should   be   32.5 Â° C.   A   set   of   equations   describing   all   available   heat   transfer   mechanisms   was   utilized   to   determine   the   approximate   combination   of   mean   radiant   temperature   and   mean   air   temperature   that   fulfills   these   criteria.   

3.1.

Heat  Transfer  Model 

Thermal   comfort   is   typically   calculated   for   the   steady   state   as   the   awake   state   is   typically   chaotic   and   hard   to   predict.   This   may   not   be   adequate   for   the   sleep   state.   As   suggested   by   existing   research,   sleep   is   not   a   thermally   neutral   state   and   the   metabolism   rate   during   sleep   is   0.7   met   or   41   W/m 2   for   an   average   American   male   (ASHRAE,   2010)   and   the   desired   heat   loss   rate   for   sleep   is   36   W/m 2   as   developed   above.   

32    

As   the   body   produces   more   heat   than   it   losses,   there   is   a   slight   heat   gain   over   a   typical   sleep   period   of   8   hours.   With   a   50 t h   percentile   US   male,   this   results   in   a   body   temperature   rise   of   roughly   0.8 Â° C   which   closely   match   the   1 Â° C   of   body   temperature   rise   over   the   sleep   period   to   wake   up   the   person   as   described   by   Lack   et   al.   (Lack,   Gradisar,   Someren,   Wright,   &   Lushington,   2008).   Although   a   steady   state   model   is   not   representative   of   the   dynamic   process   of   sleep   as   discussed   earlier,   without   a   better   understanding   and   the   knowledge   of   the   sleep   thermal   gain   and   deficit   interaction;   the   comfort   criteria   are   only   a   skin   temperature   and   a   heat   transfer   rate,   a   single   node   model   at   steady   state   is   utilized   in   this   research.    As   with   previous   studies   such   as   (Holand,   1999),   it   is   sufficient   to   determine   the   thermal   environment   required   with   only   the   desired   skin   temperature   and   heat   transfer   rate.

Setup  of  Heat  Exchange  Model 
Thermal  Environment 

A   thermal   environment   was   created   to   exchange   heat   with   the   body   model.   This   simplified   the   thermal   environment   into   the   main   heat   transfer   mechanisms.   This   includes   radiant,   convective,   conductive   and   mass   heat   transfers   and   these   processes   are   shown   in   Figure   1.    Radiant   heat   transfer   from   the   body   model   to   the   thermal   environment   was   calculated   from   the   surface   temperature   of   the   exposed   body   or   the   covering  

33    

and   to   the   radiant   aspect   of   the   thermal   environment   represented   by   the   Mean   Radiant   Temperature.   Convective   heat   transfer   from   the   body   model   to   the   thermal   environment   was   calculated   from   the   surface   temperature   of   the   exposed   body   or   the   covering   and   to   the   convection   aspect   of   the   thermal   environment   represented   by   the   mean   dry   bulb   air   temperature   and   the   mean   air   velocity.    Latent   heat   transfer   from   the   body   via   respiration   was   calculated   with   the   mean   air   temperature   and   relative   humidity   of   the   air.   Conductive   heat   transfer   from   the   body   model   to   the   thermal   environment   was   calculated   from   the   surface   temperature   of   the   covered   body   to   the   surface   of   the   exposed   covering   surface.   Conductive   heat   transfer   acts   across   the   insulative   body   covering   layer   from   the   body   contact   on   the   underside   to   the   environment   contact   on   the   topside.   The   body   was   broken   into   two   sections,   the   head   and   the   body.   The   reason   for   this   is   that   the   body   may   be   covered   by   coverings   while   the   head   is   mainly   exposed.

Body  Heat  Exchange  Model 

Concerning   the   heat   exchange   of   a   body   with   the   thermal   environment,   the   body   is   separated   to   two   parts,   the   exposed   head   and   the   covered   body.   The   main   heat   transfer   between   the   body   and   the   thermal   environment   is   the   34    

respiratory   heat   transfer,   radiant   heat   transfer   and   convective   heat   transfer.   On   the   covered   body,   there   is   an   additional   conduction   heat   transfer   between   the   body   and   the   thermal   environment   through   the   blanket.   Values   for   coefficients   were   determined   by   regression   analysis   of   empirical   data   tables   from   ASHRAE   and   other   sources.

3.3.1.

Sleep  Efficiency  Thermal  Condition  Criteria 

Sleep   efficiency   and   its   relationship   with   the   thermal   condition   do   not   have   a   well  established   definitive   relationship.   From   the   available   literature   it   is   suggested   that:   1. The   thermal   environment   should   help   the   body   lose   heat   prior   to   the   person   entering   sleep.   2. Rapid   heating   of   a   person   at   sleep   resulting   in   more   than   1 Â° C   of   skin   temperature   rise   will   likely   awake   the   person   regardless   of   starting   temperature.  

36    

3. A   skin   temperature   of   35 Â° C   or   higher   will   most   definitely   cause   discomfort   during   sleep   where   the   optimal   skin   temperature   is   32.5 Â° C.    4. A   person   asleep   is   less   subjective   to   the   change   in   temperature   and   humidity   than   when   awake,   but   achieves   better   sleep   in   dryer   conditions.    5. Mean   air   velocity   shall   be   less   than   0.8   m/s   6. A   person   at   rest   feels   thermally   neutral   when   they   lose   36   W/m 2   of   body   heat.   Given   that   a   person   at   rest   produces   41   W/m 2   therefore   the   person   feels   thermally   neutral   with   a   slight   rise   in   body   temperature   over   time.   7. Heating   cycle   should   induce   less   than   0.8   Â°C   of   skin   warming   over   a   relative   short   period.    3.3.2. Body  Analytical  Data 

The   biometric   data   (ASHRAE,   2009)   for   an   average   50 t h   percentile   American   male   was   used   as   the   human   physical   model.   Since   the   thermal   comfort   criteria   established   above   are   based   on   skin   surface   temperature   and   a   specific   heat   loss   rate   per   unit   area   which   both   were   independent   of   dimension   and   mass;   the   actual   physical   body   characteristic   does   not   matter.   

37    

However   it   is   prudent   to   keep   to   the   50 t h   percentile   American   male   for   the   deduction   of   the   convective   heat   transfer   characteristic   length;   and   to   be   consistent   of   the   view   factors   correlation   of   the   human   body   with   the   black   globe   sensor   later   on   in   the   field   study.   3.3.2.1. Human Surface Skin Area and Body Mass

Average   adult   male   body   surface   area   was   found   to   be   1.8   m 2   and   mass   at   80   kg   according   to   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010).   Heat   capacitance   of   human   flesh   was   recorded   at   3.47   kJ/kgK.   3.3.2.2. Body Metabolic Rate

Metabolic   rate   of   an   average   sleeping   male   is:   0.7   met   while   equivalent   1   met   equates   to   58.2   W/m 2   according   to   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010).   This   means   that   a   sleeping   person   will   have   an   equivalent   heat   generation   of   roughly   41   W/m 2 .   3.3.3. Radiant  Heat  Exchange 

The   Radiant   heat   exchange   is   assumed   to   be:   1. Occurring   between   the   person   and   his/her   surrounding   represented   by   the   mean   radiant   temperature   2. Steady   state   condition,   the   person   is   motionless   3. Plane   to   plane   radiant   heat   transfer,   minor   role   for   view   factor   as   a   person   or   furniture   get   moved   around.

Convective  Heat  Exchange  39  

 

The   convective   heat   exchange   is   assumed   to   be:   1. Laminar   flow   2. Horizontal   cylinder   approximation   with   the   mass   and   density   of   an   average   American   male    3. Dry   air   calculations   4. Steady   state   condition,   the   person   is   motionless   The   convective   latent   heat   exchange   is   assumed   to   be   negligible.   As   per   Guyton   (Guyton   &   Hall,   1992)   it   was   stated   that   for   a   typical   person,   sweating   of   the   skin   begins   when   the   skin   temperature   reaches   37 Â° C   or   greater.   As   the   design   condition   of   the   skin   is   32.5 Â° C,   evaporative   heat   exchange   will   not   be   considered.    Theconvectivesensibleheatexchangeiscalculatedusingequationbelow:

Given   that   for   the   dry   bulb   air   temperature   range   explored   is 283Â° 303Â° ;   the   water   vapor   pressure   at   saturation   is   1.228   kPa   and   4.246   kPa   resepctively.   With   an   atmosperhic   pressure   of   101.325   kPa,   water   vapor   represent   0.76%   and   2.72%   respectively.   Given   that   moist   air   will   not   be   saturated,   the   contribution   to   density   is   minimum   therefore   dry   air   calcualtion   is   acceptable.

45    

Given   the   geometrical   differences   between   that   used   in   the   developments   of   these   coefficients   to   the   horizontal   sleep   condition,   the   calculated   convective   heat   transfer   coefficients   between   1   W/m 2 K   to   4   W/m 2 K,   as   shown   in   Table   5,   are   considered   reasonable.   3.3.5. Conductive  Heat  Exchange 

The   human   body   when   sleeping   is   generally   in   contact   with   the   various   bedding   material,   this   includes   the   bed   material   and   the   coverings.   For   a   person   standing   or   sitting,   conductive   heat   transfer   is   less   of   a   concern   as   the   contact   surface   area   such   as   the   feet   to   the   floor   is   small   and   the   contact   area   is   often   insulated,   e.g.   carpets,   clothing.   Therefore   conductive   heat   transfer   was   considered   only   for   the   sleep   duration.   The   assumptions   used   in   the   conductive   heat   exchange   calculation   include:   1. Micro   thermal   environment   between   covering   and   the   human   body   is   completely   efficient,   that   the   air   pockets   are   thin   and   the   skin   conducts   with   the   blanket   directly.   2. Conduction   is   unidirectional,   from   a   uniform   source   to   a   uniform   environment.    3. Steady   state   condition,   the   person   is   motionless   Upward  Covering  Conduction 

46    

The   body   of   a   sleeping   person   is   generally   covered   by   some   sort   of   covering;   heat   will   have   to   travel   through   the   covering   from   the   body   via   conduction   prior   to   being   exchanged   radiantly   and   convectively.

Downward  Bedding  Conduction  The   mattress   or   bedding   a   person   sleeps   on   in   the   northern   hemisphere   typically   is   of   significant   insulation   value.   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010)   addresses   the   downward   heat   transfer   by   a   person   sitting   on   a   chair   by   applying   an   additional   overall   insulation   value   to   the   entire   body.   For   an   executive   chair,   this   is   considered   to   be   an   additional   0.15   clo   for   persons   dressed   0.5   to   1.2   clo.   But   a   thin   chair   has   much   less   wetted   area   between   the   chair   and   the   body   compared   to   person   on   a   bed   and   is   significantly   thinner   than   a   mattress.   47    

A   mattress   made   of   separate   spring   compartments,   foam   or   other   material   with   significant   air   pockets,   a   200   mm   thick   mattress   will   have   an   insulative   value   of   roughly   RSI   5   to   RSI   10   (m 2 K/W)   depending   on   the   filling,   with   additional   insulation   value   provided   by   the   box   frame   and   other   common   bed   frame   accessories.   Compared   to   winter   coverings   of   an   insulative   value   of   1   to   13.5   TOG   (RSI   0.1   to   RSI   1.35),   heat   loss   via   downward   conduction   was   considered   insignificant.    3.3.6. Respiration  Heat  Exchange 

Cain   et   al   (Cain,   Livingstone,   Nolan,   &   Keefe,   1990)   found   that   the   exhaled   air   temperature   and   humidity   for   five   male   subjects   are   relatively   independent   of   ambient   temperatures.   The   exhaled   air   in   an   ambient   temperature   of   between   20 Â° C   to   40 Â° C   is   between   34 Â° C   and   30 Â° C   respectively.    The   ambient   air   was   dry   while   the   exhaled   air   was   either   at   saturation,   super   saturation   or   near   saturation.   The   average   heat   loss   was   found   (Cain,   Livingstone,   Nolan,   &   Keefe,   1990)   to   be   at   around   25   W   with   an   ambient   temperature   of   0 Â° C   to   40 Â° C.   The   average   respiratory   rate   was   found   to   be   8.7   L/min.   The   heat   exchange   by   respiration   is   given   by:

The   respiratory   heat   loss   composes   between   4.13   W/m 2   to   1.66   W/m 2   between   the   air   temperatures   calculated   which   in   turn   is   11.5%   and   4.6%   of   the   desired   heat   loss   rate   of   36   W/m 2 .    53

Convective  and  Radiative  Heat  Loss 

The   equations   were   solved   for   a   general   heat   loss   of   36   W/m 2   with   a   skin   temperature   of   32.5 Â° C   with   MathCAD.   The   combination   of   mean   radiant   temperature,   insulation   value   and   mean   air   temperature   to   achieve   this   is   displayed   in   the   table   and   chart   below.

Figure   5   shows   the   combinations   of   mean   radiant   temperature   and   air   temperature   at   different   insulation   to   help   achieve   a   heat   loss   rate   of   36   W/m 2   and   a   skin   temperature   of   32.5Â°C.    The   contours   are   not   linear   as   the   magnitude   of   the   radiant   heat   transfer   coefficient   is   based   on   the   fourth   power   absolute   temperature   difference   between   the   surfaces.   The   magnitude   of   the   convective   heat   transfer   coefficient   is   influenced   by   the   relative   temperature   difference   between   the   environment   and   the   surfaces.    While   both   the   radiant   heat   transfer   and   convective   heat   transfer   is   based   on   the   interfaced   surface   which   is   the   skin   at   32.5Â°C   (305.5K),   the   respiratory   heat   transfer   is   based   on   the   core   temperature   which   with   mixing,   the   exhaled   temperature   is   at   34Â°C   (307K).   Given   on   the   chart   is   a   constant   operative   temperature   line   at   21Â°C   (298K),   which   can   be   used   to   gauge   if   the   mean   radiant   temperature   or   the   air   temperature   has   a   greater   influence.   The   cases   with   the   blanket   at   0   tog   to   3   tog   shows   that   the   mean   radiant   temperature   has   a   large   impact.   While   the   case   with   a   blanket   of   5   tog   and   above   shows   that   air   temperature   is   a   more   significant   contributor.   This   is   consistent   with   Table   5   showing   that   the   convective   heat   transfer   is   the   least   between   3   to   5   togs   of   bedding   insulation.    With   typical   indoor   environments   where   the   mean   radiant   temperature   and   air   temperature   cannot   be   too   low,   blankets   should   be   between   3   to   5   tog.   Figure   5   have   been   reconfigured   into   Figure   6   to   illustrate   this   effect   better.    57

The   mean   radiant   temperature   of   a   heated   building   would   not   likely   be   lower   than   290K   (17Â°C)   and   at   reasonable   air   temperatures   of   288K   to   303K   (15Â°C   to   30Â°C),   the   maximum   insulation   value   of   the   blanket   is   3   tog   to   4   tog.    As   a   traditional   summer   blankets   is   around   2   tog   and   cold   climate   blankets   are   around   12   tog,   the   model   suggests   that   in   modern   homes   with   tight   envelopes,   the   typical   heating   set   point   will   likely   result   in   overheating   during   sleep.   

3.6.

Analysis  and  Discussion 

The   convective   heat   transfer   coefficient   calculated   is   similar   to   those   quoted   by   ASHRAE   fundamental   (ASHRAE,   2009)   for   a   seated   person.   It   may   be   an   overestimation   due   to   the   assumption   that   the   body   is   represented   by   a   free   cylinder   in   the   calculation   while   as   a   body   asleep   on   a   bed   is   more   akin   to   a   cylinder   on   a   plane.   This   means   that   wetted   area   of   the   body   is   smaller   than   assumed   and   the   geometry   is   less   suitable   at   promoting   convective   flow.    Similarly   as   the   body   is   lying   on   a   bed,   it   suggests   that   a   proportion   of   the   body   area   is   not   acting   in   radaitive   and   convective   heat   transfer.   As   discussed   above,   the   conductive   heat   transfer   into   the   bed   itself   is   minimal   and   hence   the   36   W/m 2   of   heat   loss   rate   may   have   to   be   weighted   into   the   body   area   that   is   exposed.    The   model   suggests   that   blankets   and   coverings   over   5   tog   may   induce   overheating   for   people   residing   in   buildings   with   tight   envelopes   that   maintain   59    

a   relative   high   operative   temperature   during   the   night.   Inversely   this   also   means   that   the   building   may   be   lowered   to   an   operative   temperature   of   15Â°C   during   sleep   to   conserve   heating   energy   without   impacting   sleep   thermal   comfort.

 Development  of  Mean  Radiant  Temperature  Sensor 

The   importance   of   mean   radiant   temperature   has   been   fully   discussed   by   researchers   (Fanger,   Banhidi,   B.W.Olesen,   &   Langkilde,   1980);   (Fanger,   Ipsen,   Langkilde,   Olesen,   Christensen,   &   Tanabe,   1985)   and   (Korsgaard,   1949).    Mean   radiant   temperature   and   directional   radiant   temperature   is   typically   measured   by   a   globe   thermometer   or   surface   temperature   method.   However   the   typical   response   rate   of   a   globe   thermometer   is   approximately   20  30   minutes   (ISO,   2002)   which   is   too   slow   to   document   more   rapid   HVAC   system   operation   changes   or   external   factors   such   as   solar   incidence.    Surface   temperature   method   will   provide   a   more   rapid   assertion   of   the   mean   radiant   temperature   due   to   the   quicker   response   of   the   sensors.   But   to   deploy   such   an   array   of   surface   sensors   to   calculate   mean   radiant   temperature   is   subjective   of   the   actual   surface   temperature   uniformity   each   surface   sensor   represents   and   may   be   impractical   for   larger   or   more   public   spaces   for   limited   available   sensor   lengths   and   interference   with   the   lifestyle   of   the   occupancy.    A   device   based   on   the   actual   reception   of   radiant   energy   to   determine   mean   radiant   temperature   such   as   the   black   globe   is   desirable   but   with   a   quicker   response   time.   The   black   globe   however   requires   an   additional   sensor   to  

61    

measure   the   air   velocity   to   derive   the   mean   radiant   temperature.   The   hot   sphere   anemometer   used   to   derive   the   air   velocities   are   fragile   and   is   a   sensitive   piece   of   equipment   that   may   not   be   ideal   for   deployment   in   high   traffic   areas.    Recognizing   the   infeasibility   of   measuring,   monitoring   and   controlling   mean   radiant   temperature,   researchers   (Jones   &   Chapman,   1994)   have   attempted   to   simplify   mean   radiant   temperature   determination.   A   simple   singular   sensor   to   determine   mean   radiant   temperature   would   be   appreciated.   An   infrared   sphere   device   is   developed   to   measure   mean   radiant   temperature.   It   was   tested   against   surface   temperature   method   and   the   black   globe   method   in   determining   mean   radiant   temperature.  

4.1.

Traditional  Method  of  Determining  Mean  Radiant  Temperature 

Both   traditional   methods   of   determining   mean   radiant   temperature   are   deployed,   the   black   globe   method   with   hot   sphere   anemometer   and   the   surface   temperature   method   with   surface   temperature   sensors   and   a   view   factor   determination.    An   array   of   direct   surface   mounted   thermocouples   will   be   attached   on   major   surfaces   in   a   dispersed   manner.   The   exact   location   of   the   thermocouples   will   be   determined   with   an   infrared   thermal   camera   to   provide   a   more   realistic   average   62    

of   the   surface   temperatures   at   a   much   quicker   response   speed   than   a   globe   mean   radiant   temperature   sensor.    The   data   to   be   collected   will   be   used   to   develop   a   mean   radiant   temperature   of   the   room   and   be   used   as   a   datum   along   with   the   globe   mean   radiant   temperature   to   evaluate   the   effectiveness   of   the   infrared   sphere   approach.  

4.2.

Infrared  Sphere  Approach 

An   alternative   method   of   measuring   the   mean   radiant   temperature   will   be   pursued   in   conjunction   with   the   traditional   globe   sensor.   Directional   radiant   temperature   sensors   are   available   but   have   a   viewing   range   of   around   20 Â° .    The   theory   for   this   approach   is   based   on   the   Nusselt   Sphere   approach   (Nusselt,   1928)   where   the   view   factor   of   a   plane   area   to   a   small   plane   element   is   the   ratio   of   the   plane   area   projection   on   an   arbitrary   hemisphere's   two   dimensional   base   area   divided   by   the   hemisphere's   base   area.   As   Farrell   (Farrell,   1976)   had   shown   that   an   area   ratio   by   photography   of   a   reflective   hemisphere   can   estimate   the   angle   factor   between   the   radiant   plane   and   the   plane   element   with   the   main   error   being   the   roundness   of   the   sphere   and   the   truncation   of   the   hemisphere   due   to   the   optical   view   angle.    For   mean   radiant   temperature,   sphere   of   highly   polished   low   emissivity   reflector   with   two   radiant   temperature   sensors   reversed   facing   will   be   used   to   determine   the   reflected   room   radiant   temperature.   The   reflected   room   radiant   63    

temperature   reading   theoretically   is   the   actual   mean   radiant   temperature   with   the   influence   of   the   reflector   emissivity.    Unlike   the   black   globe   thermometer   which   is   dependent   on   the   radiant   heat   transfer   and   convective   heat   transfer   that   heats   up   the   volume   within   the   sphere,   a   low   emissivity   sphere   theoretically   is   less   susceptible   to   the   actual   sphere   temperature.   Emissivity   is   a   function   of   temperature   but   is   quite   uniform;   therefore   will   not   be   a   function   of   air   temperature   and   air   velocity.   As   with   the   black   globe   thermometer,   a   linear   view   factor   adjustment   is   not   required   as   the   reflector   geometry   inherently   factor   in   the   radiative   flux   levels.    4.2.1. Reflector  Geometry 

The   infrared   reflector   will   have   similar   geometry   requirements   as   to   parabolic   reflectors   employed   in   lighting   fixtures.   However,   parabolic   conic   low   emissivity   reflectors   are   not   readily   available   on   the   market   while   perfect   hemispherical   stainless   steel,   aluminum   and   copper   balls   are   available.    The   intent   is   to   use   the   highly   reflective   surface   of   a   polished   metal   ball   to   allow   commercially   available   infrared   sensors   to   view   all   of   the   radiant   surfaces   of   the   room.    Two   sensors   will   be   positioned   to   read   the   reflected   heat   from   a   polished   sphere.   Each   of   the   sensors   will   be   tasked   with   reading   half   the   room's   quadrant.

The   intended   infrared   sensors   have   a   view   aspect   ratio   of   1:2,   which   means   that   viewing   cone   is   14.036 Â°   (28.072 Â°   for   the   entire   cone).   For   this,   the   sensor   will   have   to   be   located   so   that   the   extremity   of   the   cone   is   receiving   reflected   energy   from   othogonal   to   the   sensor.   This   is   calculated   via   Figure   8   Infrared   Sensor   Sphere   Design   Calculation   as   shown   below.

With   a   2:1   sensor,   this   gives:   203.37mm  4.2.2. Assumptions  and  Limitations 

The   manufacturer   of   the   infrared   sensors   was   unable   to   provide   sensor   vignette   information   and   it   is   assumed   that   the   sensor   vignette   was   weighted   equally   for   center   spot   area   and   fringes   of   the   reading   cone.    The   stainless   steel   sphere   is   assumed   to   be   perfectly   spherical   and   is   polished   to   an   emissivity   of   0.03.   This   is   assumed   to   be   accounted   for   with   the   calibration   of   the   sensor.    The   construction   and   workmanship   of   the   apparatus   is   assumed   to   be   sufficiently   within   tolerances   given   the   available   tools.    4.2.3. Construction  of  the  Apparatus 

The   construction   of   the   apparatus   is   based   on   a   stainless   steel   sphere   with   a   radius   of   101.6   mm   (4").   It   is   elevated   on   a   pedestal   76.2   mm   (3")   above   the   cantilever   arm   forming   the   base.   The   cantilever   arm   extends   away   from   the   centre   of   the   sphere   and   supports   two   extensions   that   in   turn   support   each   infrared   sensor.   

67    

The   extensions   are   constructed   so   that   the   infrared   sensor   position   in   relations   to   the   sphere   can   be   fine  tuned.    Each   sensor   is   allowed   to   be   adjusted   vertically   up   and   down;   the   nose   of   the   sensor   may   be   pitched   up   and   down;   and   yawed   left   and   right.   A   slot   allows   the   sensor   to   be   moved   closer   or   further   away   from   the   sphere.   In   total,   4   degrees   of   freedom   is   afforded   with   only   side   to   side   displacement   unavailable.

Experimental  Design  and  Setup 
Intent  of  Field  Study 

The   intent   of   the   field   study   includes   several   folds;   the   first   is   to   compare   the   actual    thermal   environment   created   by   a   ceiling   radiant   heated   room   to   the   desired   thermal   environment   calculated   by   the   heat   transfer   model.   The   second   is   to   field   test   a   new   mean   radiant   temperature   sensor   developed   in   this   research   and   the   third   is   to   allow   a   comparison   of   radiant   ceiling   heating   versus   forced   air   heating.   To   determine   the   sleep   thermal   comfort   environment   in   a   radiant   heated   room,   thermal   environment   sensors   were   deployed   in   a   room   located   at   Caledon,   Ontario,   Canada   to   monitor   the   thermal   environment.   In   the   same   room,   two   widely   accepted   methods   of   determining   mean   radiant   temperature   was   deployed   with   the   proposed   Infrared   Sphere   as   discussed   in   Section   4.2.   The   three   mean   radiant   temperature   determination   setup   were   also   repeated   in   a   forced   air   heated   room   located   in   Richmond   Hill,   Ontario,   Canada.   Additional   sensors   were   deployed   and   data   collected   to   allow   for   the   comparison   of   the   thermal   comfort   aspect   of   the   forced   air   heating   system   versus   the   ceiling   radiant   heating   system.   The   heating   systems   of   both   field   test   locations   were   operated   normally.

Data  Acquisition  and  Post  Processing 

Applying   existing   thermal   comfort   definitions   and   criteria   to   a   person   asleep   may   be   challenging   as   some   of   the   conditions   may   not   exist.   For   example,   the   allowable   air   temperature   stratification   as   defined   by   ASHRAE   55  2004   is   3 Â° C   from   head   to   feet,   where   as   if   a   person   is   asleep   on   the   horizontal   plane,   the   air   temperature   stratification   difference   from   head   to   feet   will   always   be   relatively   miniscule.   Similarly,   the   term   radiant   asymmetry   has   no   meaning   since   a   person   who   is   asleep   will   be   lying   on   a   horizontal   surface   with   no   radiant   exchange   beneath   him   as   he   will   be   in   contact   with   that   surface   and   only   be   exposed   to   the   radiant   surface   above   him.    Thus   for   the   sleep   condition,   some   adaptation   of   the   existing   definitions   will   be   required.   This   dictates   what   data   can   be   acquired   and   which   calculation   is   meaningful.   

5.3.

Intended  Variables  Acquired 

The   environmental   variables   collected   were   as   follows:   Mean  Air  Temperature  and  Air  Temperature  Stratification 

70    

Mean   air   temperature   and   air   temperature   stratification   was   measured   by   an   array   of   radiant   shielded   air   temperature   sensors   equally   spaced   vertically   600   mm   apart.    A   single   air   temperature   sensor   located   600   mm   above   the   finished   floor   at   the   center   of   mass   of   a   sleeping   person   was   used   to   determine   the   air   temperature   of   the   room.   Mean  Radiant  Temperature  and  Radiant  Temperature  Asymmetry  Mean   radiant   temperature   was   recorded   with   the   black   globe   method   and   the   infrared   method   as   described   in   Section   2.7.1   and   Section   4.2.   The   mean   radiant   temperature   was   also   developed   by   the   surface   contact   method   as   described   in   Section   2.7.2.    As   the   surface   contact   method   inherently   produces   interior   surface   temperatures,   it   was   used   to   calculate   radiant   asymmetry   in   the   traditional   three   axis   as   per   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010)   Mean  Air  Velocity  As   the   air   velocity   of   the   room   will   be   low   given   the   ventilation   system   and   expected   to   be   between   0.05   m/s   and   0.5   m/s,   an   Omni  directional   hot   wire   anemometer   was   deployed   to   record   the   mean   air   velocity   at   the   center   of   mass   of   a   sleeping   person.   

71    

Outdoor  Temperature  and  Relative  Humidity  A   radiant   shielded   outdoor   temperature   sensor   and   relative   humidity   sensor   were   deployed   in   a   clearing   at   each   field   study   location.    HVAC  System  Response  A   temperature   sensor   was   deployed   to   measure   the   supply   temperature   into   the   radiant   temperature   panel   at   the   Caledon   field   test   location.   The   supply   of   warm   water   into   the   panel   was   used   as   an   indicator   for   heating   initiation.   For   the   Richmond   Hill   field   test   location,   the   highest   air   temperature   sensor   on   the   air   temperature   stratification   array   is   within   the   down   draft   of   the   supply   vent   and   therefore   was   indicative   of   heating   cycle.    Meteorological  Data  Meteorological   data   was   extracted   from   the   nearest   weather   station   at   Toronto   Pearson   Airport   (YYZ)   located   at   43Â°40'39"   North;   79Â°37'51"   West   for   the   duration   of   the   monitoring.   Humidity  and  Air  Quality  Humidity   and   air   quality   was   measured   by   a   humidity   sensor,   CO 2   sensor   and   VOC   sensor   respectively.   The   humidity   sensor   was   located   at   the   center   of   mass   of   a   sleeping   person.   The   CO 2   sensor   and   VOC   sensor   were   a   part   of   the   building   management   system   control   suite   at   the   Caledon   field   test   location.   It   is   wall  

72    

mounted   at   shoulder   height   and   CO 2   and   VOC   data   were   only   available   for   the   Caledon   site.  

5.4.

Aliasing  and  Sampling  Theorem 

The   sampling   of   the   data   should   be   frequent   enough   to   capture   subtle   changes   such   as   solar   exposure   and   equipment   response   cycles.   For   example,   a   simple   thermostat   that   calls   for   heat   will   initiate   a   heating   equipment   and   delivery   equipment.   Each   of   these   will   require   time   before   performing   nominally.   In   addition,   smarter   equipment   such   as   ECM   pumps   has   exercise   cycles   or   heat   pumps   have   self   diagnostic   cycles   that   may   affect   the   heating   system   in   strange   ways.   At   the   Caledon   site,   the   control   thermostat   operates   at   a   refresh   rate   of   1/60   hertz   and   the   control   valves   have   open   to   the   fully   open   state   from   the   fully   closed   state   in   45   seconds.   Therefore   the   data   logger   was   set   at   a   scan   rate   of   once   every   10   seconds   and   the   code   may   be   found   in   the   Appendix.   

5.5.

Sensor  Deployment  Locations 

Thermal   environment   monitoring   equipment   was   placed   within   the   building   at   strategic   locations   within   the   room.   Most   sensors   pertaining   to   the   thermal   comfort   of   a   person   were   deployed   at   or   close   to   the   centre   of   mass   of   where   that   person   would   be.   

73    

5.6.

Equipment  Calibration 

The   thermocouples   were   calibrated   to   0.2Â°C   with   an   ice   bath   prior   to   being   deployed   in   the   field   study.   Room   air   temperature   and   relative   humidity   sensor   was   verified   with   a   mercury   sling   hygrometer   and   the   black   globe   thermister   was   checked   according   to   the   air   temperature   sensor   reading;   all   readings   were   found   to   be   within   0.5Â°C.   The   Infrared   sphere   infrared   sensors   were   adjusted   manually   in   4   degrees   of   freedom   (pitch,   yaw,   vertical   displacement,   horizontal   displacement)   to   achieve   the   desired   aspect   ratios.

Experimental  Setup 
Setup  at  Caledon  Site Background

The   building   is   a   single   family   dwelling   approximately   500   meter   squared   located   North   West   of   Bolton,   Ontario   in   the   municipality   of   Caledon   East   at   the   coordinates   of   43 Â° 57'4"North   79 Â° 52'27"   West.   The   building   is   one   story   above   grade   with   a   basement   semi   below   grade.   The   envelope   is   designed   and   built   with   a   high   degree   of   air   tightness.   Glazing   is   triple   glazed   argon   low   E   with   a   RSI   value   of   1.2   while   walls   are   designed   with   an   RSI   value   of   6.2.  The   residence   is   thermally   maintained   by   radiant   heated   and   cooled   ceiling   where   hydronic   pipes   are   embedded   in   sprayed   concrete.   Warm   or   cool   water   is   circulated   within   the   embedded   pipes   to   provide   heating   or   cooling.   The   main   heat   generation   for   the   system   is   via   a   well   source   heat   pump   rated   at   17.6   kW   backed   up   with   a   wood   gasification   boiler   rated   at   30   kW.   Cooling   is   provided   by   heat   exchange   with   ground   water.    Ventilation   is   provided   to   the   building   via   a   100%   outdoor   air   system   delivering   ventilation   air   into   each   occupied   space   utilizing   an   energy   recovery   ventilator.   Exhaust   air   is   drawn   from   each   occupied   space.   The   building   is   controlled   by   a   building   management   system   which   operates   the   ventilation   system   by   room   independent   Volatile   Organic   Compound   sensors   76    

and   operates   the   heating   and   cooling   system   by   room   independent   air   temperature.   Each   room   is   independently   controlled   for   heating   and   cooling   output.   Hydronic   flow   is   controlled   by   an   Electronic   Commuted   Motor   pump   and   hydronic   supply   temperature   follows   an   Outdoor   Reset   logic.   All   of   which   are   logged.    The   thermal   environment   the   room   was   monitored   is   located   on   a   semi   recessed   basement   with   a   large   2.6   m   wide   grade   to   ceiling   2.1   m   tall   window   facing   North   North   East.   The   room   is   6.9   m   long   by   3.6   m   wide   where   the   occupant   sleeps   in   the   middle   of   the   room.   The   main   source   of   heating   is   via   the   radiant   ceiling.   A   minute   amount   of   heat   is   injected   into   the   room   by   the   ventilation   system   at   5   L/s   supplied   and   at   room   air   temperature.   This   creates   a   very   small   heat   gain   into   the   room   and   does   not   create   a   forced   convection   over   the   body;   therefore   it   was   not   included   in   the   model.   An   initial   site   visit   was   performed   to   determine   the   existing   condition   of   the   building   and   the   current   state   of   operation.   Several   measurements   were   used   to   validate   the   site   condition   to   the   original   design   drawings   of   the   building.   This   includes   checking   the   ventilation   rate,   determining   the   radiant   view   factor   via   (Farrell,   1976)   and   checking   the   air   leakage   of   the   building   envelope   via   a   blower   door   test.

5.8.1.2.

Instrumentation 

The   surface   temperature   of   the   walls,   ceiling   and   floor   were   measured   with   an   infrared   camera   to   determine   the   placement   of   surface   mounted   temperature   sensors   and   is   presented   in   Figure   9.   The   mechanical   system   has   been   shut   off   for   a   day   with   an   outdoor   temperature   of   approximately   13 Â° C   at   the   time   of   the   recording.   The   lowest   surface   temperature   was   recorded   to   be   15.7 Â° C   at   the   junction   of   the   exterior   wall.   The   floor   labeled   D   and   interior   walls   labeled   C   and   F   were   found   to   be   fairly   uniform   and   so   minimal   sensor   was   deploy   to   represent   these   surface   temperatures   as   shown   in   Figure   14,   Figure   15   and   Figure   16.   The   left   panel   of   the   window   was   found   to   be   at   a   slightly   higher   temperature   than   right   panel   due   to   being   more   directly   exposed   to   the   radiant   heating   panel.   The   small   wall   directly   below   the   window   was   found   to   be   fairly   uniform   and   therefore   a   single   sensor   was   deployed   on   each   to   measure   its   representative   temperature.    The   ceiling   contained   both   the   heating   panel   and   free   ceiling   area.   The   free   ceiling   area   was   progressively   warmer   when   closer   to   the   radiant   panel   most   likely   by   surface   conduction.   Three   sensors   were   deployed   with   a   closer   sensor   element   spacing   when   nearer   the   radiant   panel.   The   radiant   panel   showed   significant   temperature   changes   across   it   and   therefore   6   sensors   were  

78    

dispersed   to   determine   the   average   radiant   panel   temperature   as   per   Figure   10,   Figure   12   and   Figure   13.   Similarly,   the   exterior   side   wall   labeled   A   was   found   to   be   progressively   warmer   when   it   neared   the   radiant   panel.   The   temperature   was   found   to   be   fairly   constant   until   it   reaches   within   30"   or   762   mm   of   the   radiant   panel   as   shown   in   Figure   9.   Thus   a   single   sensor   was   deployed   to   represent   the   lower   portion   of   the   wall   and   three   equally   space   sensor   were   deployed   to   represent   the   wall   area   close   to   the   radiant   panel.

Sensors   were   placed   at   the   locations   as   indicated   in   Figure   10   Sensors   Location   in   Caledon   Test   Room;   adjustments   were   made   due   to   site   conditions.   The   surface   temperature   sensors   were   placed   according   to   areas   representative   of   the   mean   panel   temperature   determined   by   an   infra  red   camera.    An   outdoor   temperature   and   relative   humidity   sensor   was   located   in   a   shaded   region   of   the   premises.   The   black   globe,   hot   sphere   anemometer,   infrared   sphere   and   air   temperature   stratification   array   was   deployed   at   the   centre   of   the   room   and   at   the   height   of   the   centre   of   mass   of   a   sleeping   as   per   Figure   10.

The   view   factor   is   determined   by   Nusselt   method   (Nusselt,   1928)   with   a   photograph   of   a   polished   stainless   steel   sphere   as   per   Figure   17   shown   below.   The   focal   point   of   the   photo   is   approximately   558.8   mm   (22")   above   the   sphere   and   the   sphere   is   101.6   mm   (4")   nominal   diameter.    The   conical   view   angle   of   the   photographic   lens   will   have   a   reduction   of   0.3   %   of   the   actual   diameter   of   the   sphere.   This   error   is   discarded.

Setup  at  Richmond  Hill  Site Background

The   building   is   a   two  storey   single   family   dwelling   with   a   basement   below   grade   located   in   Richmond   Hill,   Ontario.   The   building   envelope   is   designed   and   built   with   typical   construction   in   the   80s.   Glazing   is   double   glazed   clear   air   while   walls   are   believed   to   be   as   per   building   code   specification   of   an   RSI   value   of   3.52.   The   building   is   thermally   maintained   by   a   forced   air   heating   system   with   a   design   infiltration   rate   of   1.5   ACH   at   50   Pa.   The   main   source   of   heating   is   by   an   atmospheric   furnace.   Control   is   by   centrally   located   thermostat   with   temperature   differential   dead   band.   The   room   in   which   the   field   study   was   performed   is   located   on   the   second   floor   with   three   casement   table   height   to   ceiling   height   windows   facing   South   South   West.   The   windows   are   914   mm   wide   and   1.524   m   tall.   The   room   is   4.9   m   long  

88    

by   3.66   m   wide   where   the   occupant   sleeps   in   the   North   West   corner   of   the   room,   see   Figure   18.   An   initial   site   walkthrough   was   performed   to   determine   the   existing   condition   of   the   room   and   the   current   state   of   operation.    5.8.2.2. Instrumentation 

The   surface   temperature   of   the   walls,   ceiling   and   floor   were   measured   with   an   infrared   camera   to   determine   the   placement   of   surface   mounted   temperature   sensors.   The   outdoor   temperature   was   approximately   4 Â° C   at   the   time   of   the   recording.    The   surface   temperature   distribution   over   the   exterior   walls   varied   with   the   contour   of   the   stud   wall   clearly   visible.   The   floor   labeled   D   and   interior   walls   labeled   A   and   F   on   Figure   18   were   found   to   be   fairly   uniform   and   so   minimal   sensor   was   deployed   to   represent   these   surface   temperatures   as   shown   in   Figure   20,   Figure   21   and   Figure   24.   Significant   infiltration   was   detected   around   windows   and   the   exterior   wall   junction   with   the   ceiling.   As   no   discernable   temperature   gradient   exist   on   the   interior   surfaces,   the   number   of   deployed   surface   temperature   sensors   was   increased   and   dispersed   to   achieve   a   better   averaging   effect.    With   a   southern   exposure,   extra   care   was   exhibited   in   protecting   each   surface   temperature   sensor   from   direct   solar   exposure   via   the   application   of   foil   tape   89    

and   the   spacing   of   the   sensors   so   that   only   one   of   the   sensors   out   of   a   group   representing   a   surface   will   be   exposed   directly   at   a   time.    The   electronic   ballast   of   the   compact   fluorescent   lighting   was   found   to   induce   a   current   in   the   thermocouples   and   therefore   affect   the   accuracy   of   the   sensors   near   the   lighting   fixture   when   turned   on.   Therefore,   the   lighting   fixtures   were   disconnected   for   the   entire   duration   of   the   field   testing.    Sensors   were   placed   at   the   locations   as   indicated   on   Figure   19   to   Figure   24;   adjustments   were   made   due   to   site   conditions.   The   surface   temperature   sensors   were   placed   according   to   areas   representative   of   the   mean   panel   temperature   determined   by   an   infra  red   camera.    An   outdoor   temperature   and   relative   humidity   sensor   was   located   in   a   shaded   region   of   the   premises.   The   black   globe,   hot   sphere   anemometer,   infrared   sphere   and   air   temperature   stratification   array   was   deployed   at   the   centre   of   the   room   and   at   the   height   of   the   centre   of   mass   of   a   sleeping   person.

Each   of   the   windows   has   a   temperature   sensor   deployed.   The   small   wall   directly   below   the   window   was   found   to   be   fairly   uniform   and   therefore   two   sensors   were   deployed   on   each   to   measure   its   representative   temperature   as   shown   in   Figure   19.   The   ceiling   and   floor   have   relatively   uniform   temperature;   therefore,   three   sensors   were   deployed   on   each   as   shown   in   Figure   21   and   Figure   22.

The   view   factor   is   determined   by   Nusselt   method   (Nusselt,   1928)   with   a   photograph   of   a   polished   stainless   steel   sphere   as   per   Figure   25   shown   below.   The   focal   point   of   the   photo   is   approximately   558.8   mm   (22")   above   the   sphere   and   the   sphere   is   101.6   mm   (4")   nominal   diameter.

Check  Up  and  Retrieval  Site  Visit 

Checkup   on   the   site   monitoring   was   performed   every   week   on   the   equipment   setup   such   as   disconnected   sensors   or   delaminated   temperature   sensors   from   the   walls.   The   quality   of   the   recorded   data   were   also   monitored   and   errors   reduced   by   improving   signal   quality.    Data   from   disconnected   sensors   or   delaminated   sensors   were   excluded   from   the   calculations   until   the   sensors   were   reconnected   or   reattached.   Noise   from   electromagnetic   induction   into   the   thermocouples   were   reduced   manually   while   solar   inducted   spikes   in   temperature   sensor   readings   were   reduced   with   the   application   of   foil   tape   and   additional   sensors.   5.8.4. Equipment  Programming  and  Data  Analysis 

99    

The   deployed   thermocouples   in   the   surface   temperature   array   and   the   air   temperature   stratification   array   were   set   to   scan   every   10   seconds.    In   the   post   processing   every   6 t h   data   point   was   utilized   to   represent   each   minute   for   the   analysis.   The   excess   data   were   used   to   backfill   sequences   of   the   data   chain   that   was   compromised   by   selecting   the   preceding   value   or   averaging   of   the   sequence.    The   relative   humidity   probe,   thermistor   used   in   the   black   globe,   and   the   infrared   temperature   sensors   were   set   to   scan   with   averaging   of   two   repetitions   every   30   seconds.   In   the   Post   processing   every   2 n d   data   point   was   used   to   represent   each   minute   for   the   analysis.   Similarly,   the   outdoor   temperature   and   humidity   sensor   was   set   to   scan   every   30   seconds   and   post   processed   to   each   minute   for   the   analysis.   As   described   above,   disconnected   sensors   or   malfunctioning   sensors   were   excluded   from   the   analysis   until   that   data   collection   point   was   repaired.   5.8.5. Schedule 

The   field   study   was   conducted   during   the   heating   season.   The   field   study   at   the   Caledon   site   was   performed   between   the   periods   of   February   1 s t   to   February   20 t h   while   the   field   study   at   the   Richmond   Hill   site   was   performed   between   the   periods   of   April   17 t h   to   April   30 t h .      100

Sleep  Thermal  Comfort 

The   operative   temperature   as   determined   by   the   surface   sensor   method   is   presented   in   Figure   28.   As   anticipated   earlier,   it   was   found   that   the   air   temperature   is   less   than   the   operative   temperature,   which   in   turn   is   less   than   the   mean   radiant   temperature.    As   such,   if   a   radiant   system   is   operated   to   building   code   (Province   of   Ontario,   2006)   requirements   to   maintain   indoor   air   temperature   at   22 Â° C,   this   will   create   an   indoor   operative   temperature   of   23 Â° C   and   thus   will   cause   discomfort   by   overheating   to   a   sleeping   person.   This   suggests   that   the   operation   of   the   HVAC   system   may   be   reduced   during   sleep   thus   providing   an   energy   savings   as   will   be   explored   in   chapter   7.   6.1.2. Thermal  Comfort 

The   thermal   environment   of   the   Caledon   NNW   room   was   reviewed   according   to   ASHRAE   thermal   comfort   criteria   (ASHRAE,   2010).   The   mean   air   velocity   was   determined   to   be   0.021   m/s   and   is   less   than   0.8   m/s   therefore   should   not   have   any   influence   on   thermal   comfort.   Relative   humidity   was   found   to   be   in   between   22%   to   29%,   both   are   measured   at   0.6m   above   the   floor.   Air   temperature   stratification   was   less   than   3 Â° C   difference   from   floor   to   101    

ceiling   and   less   than   2 Â° C   difference   from   1.8m,   the   height   of   an   average   American   male,   to   the   floor.    The   air   temperature   of   the   room   was   found   to   follow   the   mean   radiant   temperature   without   significant   lag   within   10   minutes   by   approximately   2 Â° C   less.   Hence,   the   operative   temperature   inside   the   room   is   approximately   1Â°C   above   the   air   temperature   and   1Â°C   below   the   mean   radiant   temperature.    6.1.2.1.

Figure   26   shows   the   average   surface   temperature   as   determined   by   area   weighted   average   of   thermocouple   readings.   The   surface   names   correspond   to   the   names   identified   in   Figure   9   and   the   location   and   number   of   sensors   are   indicated   in   Figure   11   to   Figure   16.   As   the   Back   Wall   faces   the   Window   Wall   and   Window,   the   Interior   Side   Wall   faces   the   Exterior   Side   Wall,   and   the   Floor   faces   Ceiling   and   Radiant   Panel;   the   radiant   asymmetry   is   approximately:   ~3Â°C   for   the   window   wall   to   the   interior   wall,   ~0.5Â°C   between   the   side   walls   and   ~6Â°C   between   the   ceiling   and   the   floor.    Except   for   the   window   and   the   radiant   panel,   the   remaining   surface   temperatures   are   fairly   uniform,   which   implies   a   fairly   well   sealed   and   insulated   envelope.   Furthermore,   the   temperature   ramps   and   drift   over   a   day   is   fairly   minimal   in   the   order   of   around   2 Â° C   per   day,   much   less   than   the   1.1 Â° C   per   15   minutes   allowed   by   ASHRAE   55.    Radiant   asymmetry   for   the   horizontal   axis   are   well   within   thermal   comfort   requirements   (ASHRAE,   2010)   while   worst   case   vertical   asymmetry   is   about   6 Â° C   which   is   slightly   over   the   prescribed   limit   of   5 Â° C   and   suggests   that   the   room   is   thermally   comfortable.

Figure   27   shows   the   air   temperature   stratification   inside   the   room   at   Caledon.   The   temperature   as   shown   indicates   a   developed   air   temperature   profile   that   responds   directly   to   the   heating   input.    Using   ASHRAE   55's   (ASHRAE,   2010)   definition   of   air   temperature   stratification   between   the   head   and   foot   of   a   1.8m   tall   person,   the   air   temperature   difference   is   about   2Â°C   and   this   is   well   within   the   comfort   limit   of   3 Â° C.

Figure   28   shows   the   operative   temperature   derived   by   the   air   temperature   and   the   mean   radiant   temperature   by   the   surface   temperature   method.   The   outdoor   air   temperature,   average   radiant   panel   temperature,   supply   water   temperature,   indoor   air   temperature   and   area   weighted   average   surface   temperature   are   also   included   in   Figure   28   for   comparison   and   suggest   that   the   operative   temperature   is   pretty   much   independent   of   the   outdoor   temperatures.   The   supply   water   temperature   was   governed   by   a   heat   pump   and   a   wood   boiler,   therefore   the   supply   water   temperature   shows   two   distinct   phases.   The   sinusoidal   temperature   profile   such   as   the   one   between   Feb   05 t h   and   Feb   07 t h   shows   the   wood   boiler   firing   and   its   discharge   cycle.   The   relatively   consistent   temperature   profile   with   periodical   drop   offs   such   as   those   between   Feb   08 t h   and   Feb   11 t h   is   the   operation   of   the   heat   pump.    The   first   eight   days'   data   are   shown   in   Figure   29   below   to   illustrate   the   anti  aliasing   theorem.

Figure29FirstEightDays'DataofFigure28
The   data   shown   in   Figure   29   have   been   down   sampled   to   allow   it   to   be   plotted   clearly.    The   down   sample   is   to   1   reading   per   hour   and   shows   a   pretty   consistent   supply   water   temperature   output   when   operating   the   heat   pump   between   the   2 n d   and   the   6 t h .    However,   if   the   same   data   are   plotted   at   a   sampling   rate   of   1   reading   per   30   minute   as   shown   in   Figure   30,   the   supply   water   temperature   shows   a   pattern   such   as   a   consistent   temperature   drop   at   around   6   pm   in   the   period   which   the  

109    

heat   pump   is   running   (Feb   2   Â­   Feb   4).  

 

Figure30SameDataasFigure29DownSampledto30MinutesIntervals
There   seems   to   be   a   periodic   temperature   drop   off   at   around   the   same   time   each   day.   However,   the   pattern   does   not   repeat   itself   on   the   8 t h .   Therefore   it   suggests   that   down   sampling   rate   was   insufficient   to   reveal   the   actual   operation   of   the   system.    The   sampling   rate   was   increased   to   a   reading   every   5   minutes   and   is   plotted   in   Figure   31   below.  

110    

 

Figure31SameDataasFigure29DownSampledat5MinutesIntervals
At   a   higher   sampling   rate,   a   distinct   pattern   of   the   periodic   supply   water   temperature   drop   off   is   seen.   The   periodical   drop   off   actually   represents   the   heat   pump   self   check   cycle   every   ~4   Hours   as   confirmed   with   the   manufacturer.   The   sampling   rate   as   per   the   anti   aliasing   theorem   was   successful   in   allowing   this   cycle   to   be   identified.     The   operative   temperature   remains   between   19Â°C   to   22Â°C   even   when   the   outdoor   air   temperature   varies   from   22Â°C   to   10Â°C.   The   operative   temperature   of   the   room   during   the   operation   with   only   the   heat   pump   was   within   ~0.5Â°C  

111    

each   day.   This   suggests   that   the   mechanical   system   is   sufficient   in   providing   the   necessary   output   to   match   the   load   determined   by   the   building   envelope.   The   maximum   rate   of   operative   temperature   change   is   approximately   1 Â° C/6   hours,   which   is   less   than   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2004)   (ASHRAE,   2010)   limit   of   3.3   Â° C/4   hours.   In   short,   the   interior   space   of   the   room   would   be   considered   comfortable.   

 

Figure32RelativeHumidityandContaminants

Figure   32   shows   the   relative   humidity   and   contaminants   at   the   Caledon   site.   Although   contaminates   are   beyond   the   scope   of   this   research,   it   is   indicative   of   the   separate   ventilation   aspect   of   radiant   heated   buildings.   Ventilation   air   is   provided   at   5   L/s   directly   into   the   room   and   5   L/s   are   extracted   from   the   room.    The   particulate   spike   with   250   particle   per   cubic   meter   on   the   1st   of   February   corresponds   to   the   two   researchers   (one   male   and   one   female)   setting   up   the   equipment   with   light   activity.   While   the   150   particle   per   cubic   meter   spike   on   the   5th   of   February   corresponds   to   one   male   researcher   retrieving   data   and   the   100   particle   per   meter   cube   spike   on   the   6th   and   the   7th   of   February   corresponds   to   the   to   the   female   owner   doing   some   light   cleaning.    The   CO 2   level   is   consistent   at   roughly   500   ppm   for   the   duration   of   this   study.   This   is   much   less   than   the   ASHRAE   (ASHRAE,   1999)and   OSHA   (Carbon   Dioxide)   standard   of   a   ceiling   tolerance   of   1000   ppm   and   5000   ppm   respectively.   The   indoor   relative   humidity   is   in   the   low   20%   range   as   the   humidifier   was   not   operated.   All   the   humidity   within   the   building   was   generated   by   the   people   inside   and   the   activities   that   they   have   completed.   Moisture   was   also   recovered   from   the   exhaust   air   via   the   Energy   Recovery   Ventilator.    6.1.2.2. Richmond Hill SSW Room

The   field   data   measurements   were   repeated   at   a   forced   air   heated   suburban    113    

house   located   in   Richmond   Hill,   Ontario.   The   house   was   constructed   during   the   1980s   and   is   typical   of   that   era.   The   sensors   were   deployed   in   a   SSW   facing   room   with   three   casement   windows.

115    

The   overall   air   temperature   stratification   shows   that   the   vertical   stratification   is   within   1Â°C,   however   significant   ramp   changes   in   temperature   exist   such   as   the   5Â°C   rise   over   6   hours   on   the   23 r d   ;   4Â°C   rise   over   3   hours   at   6   pm   on   the   20 t h   and   3Â°C   rise   over   2   hours   on   the   28 t h .      The   operation   of   the   mechanical   system   can   also   be   deduced   as   on   the   20 t h ,   the   furnace   can   operate   continuously   to   meet   the   heating   load   when   the   outdoor   condition   is   3Â°C   with   an   air   temperature   rise   of   4Â°C.   While   on   the   25 t h   the   furnace   was   cycled   4   times   to   meet   the   heating   load   when   the   outdoor   condition   is   6Â°C,   each   with   a   temperature   rises   of   around   1.5Â°C.    The   air   temperature   stratification   for   a   selected   period   is   shown   in   Figure   34.

Figure   34   shows   clearly   the   chaotic   air   temperature   regime   and   stratification   inside   the   room   with   almost   instantaneous   step   changes.   The   step   increases   are   consistently   at   6   pm   as   shown   on   the   18th,   19th,   20th   and   the   21st   as   the   outdoor   temperature   begins   to   drop   therefore   suggesting   the   operation   of   the   force   air   heating   system.    The   floor   surface   temperature   is   also   shown   and   is   indicative   of   the   solar   heat   gain   of   the   room.   The   indoor   air   temperatures   correspond   well   with   the   floor   temperature   but   the   influence   of   the   outdoor   air   temperature   can   also   clearly   be   seen.   At   instances   where   the   floor   temperature   curve   does   not   follow   the   outdoor   air   temperature   curve,   the   indoor   air   temperature   curve   shows   distinctive   minor   peaks   corresponding   to   the   outdoor   temperature.   This   suggests   that    there   is   significant   infiltration.

The   room   surface   temperatures   are   fairly   uniform,   on   the   23rd   of   April;   the   surface   temperatures   are   raised   steadily   by   5Â°C    over   4   hours   to   an   average   room   surface   temperature   of   24Â°C.    The   window   temperature   are   especially   high,   this   may   be   due   to   the   direct   solar   exposure   onto   the   window   thermocouples   which   were   not   direct   solar   radiation   protected   with   foil   tape   as   the   wall   sensors   were.    This   may   skew   the   subsequent   mean   radiant   temperature   and   therefore   the   operative   temperature   to   become   higher.   According   to   Table   8,   the   combined   view   factor   of   the   windows   attribute   to   0.045   or   4.5%.   This   suggest   that   on   a   peak   day   like   April   13   with   recorded   operative   temperature   of   24.9Â°C   and   an   average   wall   temperature   of   24.4Â°C;   the   windows   contributed   a   maximum   of   0.5Â°C   to   the   operative   temperature   even   when   reached   a   temperature   of   39Â°C.   This   suggest   that   the   solar   impact   on   the   window   sensor   is   minimal   to   the   overall   mean   radiant   temperature   determination   and   even   less   so   to   the   operative   temperature   determination.   The   large   change   in   surface   and   air   temperature   suggests   that   the   operative   temperature   would   also   have   large   changes   and   is   shown   in   Figure   36.

 Figure36RichmondHillTemperatureComparison
The   operative   temperature   follows   closely   to   the   pattern   of   the   air   temperature.   The   maximum   ramp   of   operative   temperature   is   approximately   1Â°C/15   minutes   for   a   maximum   of   4Â°C   change.   It   is   close   to   the   acceptability   limit   of   ASHRAE   55's   tolerance   of   1.1Â°C/15   minutes   and   exceeds   the   maximum   drift   of   3.3Â°C/4   hour.   Therefore   the   Richmond   Hill   building   may   be   considered   thermally   uncomfortable   according   to   ASHRAE   standard   55.     6.1.3. Forced  Air  and  Radiant  Ceiling  Heating  Thermal  Comfort  Comparison 

Although   the   two   buildings   are   vastly   different   in   construction   and   build   quality,   some   merits   are   still   present   in   a   comparison   of   the   thermal   comfort   120    

conditions   created   in   each   case.   The   ramp   and   drift   of   each   field   test   location   is   calculated   graphically   and   is   presented   in   Table   9   below.   The   heating   system   response   time   could   not   be   calculated   as   the   Caledon   site   was   being   operated   continuously   while   the   Richmond   Hill   site   could   not   be   determined   as   the   collected   data   shows   a   lot   of   interference   thought   to   be   from   leakage   and   solar   radiation.   A   comparison   of   how   long   it   took   from   the   peak   heating   delivery   by   either   the   forced   air   or   the   radiant   panel   to   the   maximum   resultant   operative   temperature   was   graphically   derived   and   shown   in   Table   9   below.

The   results   are   consistent   with   existing   research   (Haddad   &   Purdy,   2007)   in   that   radiant   heating   systems   provides   better   thermal   environments   and   energy   efficiency   in   buildings   with   better   envelopes.   This   is   generally   due   to   the   lower   temperature   output   at   the   primary   heat   generation   site,   therefore,   allowing   higher   coefficient   of   performance   or   efficiency.    The   heat   distribution   is   generally   more   efficient   due   to   the   energy   density   water   can   hold   in   comparison   to   air.   While   delivery   by   radiant   means   is   121    

omnidirectional   and   is   instantaneous   when   compared   to   the   slow   non  uniform   distribution   of   buoyancy   and   diffusion   of   forced   or   free   convective   heating.    While   an   analysis   of   the   overall   heating   efficiency   of   these   two   heating   systems   cannot   be   completed   due   to   the   insufficient   data,   the   radiant   heating   system   is   expected   to   heat   more   efficiently   and   effectively   than   forced   air   as   per   other   radiant   heating   system   studies   (Murakami,   Kato,   &   Kim,   2001)   6.1.4. Effectiveness  of  the  Infrared  Sphere  at  Determining  Mean  Radiant  Temperature  Comparison of Mean Radiant Temperature from Infrared Sphere, Black Globe and Surface Sensor Method Three   methods   of   field   determination   of   the   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   were   employed   in   two   different   rooms   in   two   separate   buildings.   One   of   the   rooms   is   NNW   exposed   while   the   other   one   is   SSW   exposed.   The   Surface   Sensor   method   and   the   Infrared   Sphere   method   produce   nearly   identical   mean   radiant   temperature   at   both   locations   while   the   Black   Globe   method   produced   a   higher   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   at   the   SSW   facing   room   during   non   clouded   period   of   day   time.   The   black   globe   overestimation   of   mean   radiant   temperature   during   solar   exposure   is   consistent   with   findings   from   previous   studies   (Jones   &   Chapman,   1994).(Jones   &   Chapman,   1994)   In   both   buildings   the   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   is   indicative   of   the   Average   Surface   Area   Weighted   Temperature   that   is   normally   used   for   HVAC   control.

The   AUST   (Average   Weighted   Surface   Temperature)   with   all   surfaces   and   only   the   recipient   surfaces   excluding   the   radiant   panel   are   shown   in   Figure   37.   The   mean   radiant   temperature   developed   by   the   infrared   sphere   method   and   the   surface   temperature   method   are   very   similar   with   a   discrepancy   of   around   0.25Â°C,   which   is   well   within   the   accuracy   of   the   equipment   and   the   geometry   and   calculation   errors.   The   black   globe   method   underestimates   the   mean   radiant   temperature   compared   to   the   others   by   around   1Â°C.   Note   that   the   Caledon   site   faces   North   North   West   and   therefore   have   very   little   solar   exposure   especially   during   winter   and   does   not   show   the   characteristic   overestimation   of   mean   radiant   temperature   during   the   day.   This   discrepancy   may   be   attributed   to   the   thermistor   used   inside   the   black   globe   in   comparison   to   the   thermocouples   readings   for   the   surface   measurements.    These   results   were   also   reproduced   at   the   Richmond   Hill   site   as   shown   in   Figure   38   below.  

124    

 

Figure38RichmondHillSSWMeanRadiantTemperaturesComparison
There   is   a   more   pronounced   difference   between   the   different   methods   of   determining   mean   radiant   temperature.   Under   direct   sunlight,   the   black   globe   method   estimate   is   significantly   higher   than   the   surface   temperature   method   by   4Â°C   as   shown   at   noon   on   the   23rd.    This   is   consistent   with   previous   researchers   who   found   that   the   black   globe   overestimates   mean   radiant   temperature   under   direct   sunlight   exposure   (ISO,   2002).   The   infrared   sphere   method   overestimated   the   mean   radiant   temperature   by   approximately   1Â°C   under   directs   sunlight   as   shown   at   noon   on  

125    

the   23rd   and   suggests   that   the   infrared   sphere   method   is   more   resilient   to   sun   exposure   than   the   black   globe.   

 

 

Figure39RichmondHillSSWRoomMeanRadiantTemperatureComparison ofSelectedDates.
Figure   37   and   Figure   39   shows   very   little   discrepancy   between   the   mean   radiant   temperature   developed   by   the   infrared   sphere   method   in   comparison   to   the   surface   sensor   method   and   the   black   globe   method.   This   suggests   that   the   Infrared   Sphere   method   may   be   a   possible   substitute   for   the   Black   Globe   method   and   Surface   Sensor   method   in   the   determination   of   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   and   Average   Surface   Area   Weighted   Temperature   under   certain   circumstances.    126    

6.1.4.2.

Revisit the Definition of Mean Radiant Temperature

The   mean   radiant   temperature   that   is   defined   by   Fanger   and   as   worded   in   (ASHRAE,   2009)   is:   "the   uniform   temperature   of   an   imaginary   enclosure   in   which   radiant   heat   transfer   from   the   human   body   equals   the   radiant   heat   transfer   in   the   actual   nonuniform   enclosure."   The   definition   of   radiant   heat   transfer   can   be   and   have   been   viewed   as   the   radiant   heat   transfer   via   long   wave   radiation   as   shown   in   the   proposed   calculation   method   of   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   by   surface   temperatures   and   view   factors.    This   means   that   short   wave   radiation   generally   from   solar   sources   is   omitted,   which   affects   the   accuracy   of   the   apparatus   in   determining   Mean   Radiant   Temperature.   In   essence,   a   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   that   is   determined   by   sufficiently   distributed   surface   temperature   sensor   grid   will   be   different   than   a   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   determined   by   the   Black   Globe   method.   The   difference   is   caused   by   the   working   mechanism   of   each   method.   The   black   globe   works   by   finding   the   neutral   temperature   point   at   the   recipient's   location   where   the   radiant   heat   flux   gain/loss   at   the   globe   is   matched   by   the   convective   heat   loss/gain   of   the   globe,   while   the   surface   sensor   method   works   by   measuring   the   long   wave   radiation   heat   flux   going   towards   the   recipient.   Direct   sunlight   on   several   surface   temperature   sensors   will   elevate   only   a   portion   of   the   heat   flux   going   towards   the   recipient   while   direct   sunlight   on   the   black

globe   will   significantly   elevate   the   heat   flux   entering   at   the   hemispherical   direction   of   the   solar   incident.    Likewise,   the   Infrared   Sphere   method   like   the   surface   sensor   method   measures   the   reflected   long   wave   infrared   heat   flux   off   the   polished   sphere.   Since   the   infrared   sensors   are   only   sensitive   to   long   wave   radiation   and   that   the   emissivity   of   polished   stainless   steel   is   higher   for   short   wave   radiation   than   long   wave;   the   Infrared   Sphere   method   will   not   represent   the   effect   of   direct   sunlight   incidence   well.     The   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   determined   by   the   Black   Globe   method   is   within   reason   of   the   other   two   methods   during   night   time   while   increases   significantly   when   under   exposure   from   direct   sunlight.   The   meteorological   data   as   obtained   from   Environmental   Canada   in

This   is   similar   to   (ISO,   2002)   on   the   performance   of   the   black   globe   which   finds   that   the   black   globes   overestimates   mean   radiant   temperature   when   under   direct   sunlight.

This   proposes   the   question,   should   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   account   for   direct   solar   radiative   heat   transfer   as   its   original   definition   will   allow?   Or   should   direct   solar   radiation   be   removed   from   its   definition   specifically.   Solar   radiation   is   not   something   a   HVAC   system   could   control   in   the   traditional   sense,   but   can   explicitly   be   controlled   by   the   occupant   by   drawing   a   curtain.   While   HVAC   system   can   influence   surface   temperatures,   air   temperature   and   velocity,   these   items   cannot   be   controlled   by   the   occupants   directly.

Summary 

In   summary,   the   Infrared   Sphere   method   in   determining   mean   radiant   temperature   by   this   research   shows   an   agreement   with   the   other   methods   of   131    

determining   mean   radiant   temperature   for   the   two   field   test   locations.   Some   discrepancies   between   the   Black   Globe   method   and   the   infrared   sphere   method   is   recorded   which   is   also   documented   by   previous   research   (ISO,   2002).   Further   research   should   be   completed   to   validate   the   Infrared   Sphere   method   prior   to   its   adoption.   This   research   has   also   illustrated   the   importance   of   the   definition   of   mean   radiant   temperature   to   the   methods   used   for   its   determination.   An   in  depth   review   of   its   intended   application   is   recommended.

Introduction 

The   collected   data   from   the   Caledon   residence   allows   the   deduction   of   potential   energy   savings   via   the   analysis   of   the   installed   mechanical   system.   Assuming   the   equipment   manufacturer's   specification   data   are   accurate   and   reading   the   supply   water   temperature   off   Figure   28   to   achieve   the   desired   Operative   Temperature,   the   total   reduction   of   energy   consumption   and   the   decreased   power   consumption   due   to   the   increase   of   coefficient   of   performance   can   be   determined.   7.1.1. Datum  Data  and  Assumptions 

The   system   is   idealized   for   heating   only   as   per   schematic   below:

6. The   design   day   outdoor   condition   is   used   and   assumed   to   be   consistent   for   24   hours   of   the   analysis.   Existing   engineering   documents   states   heating   load   to   be   12.9   kW   by   ENERPASS   7. The   heat   pump   heat   sink   pump   is   a   Grundfos   UPS   32  40   BF   pump.   100   W   8. The   radiant   circulator   pump   is   a   Wilo   1.25X3  35   pump.   320   W   9.

Â½   hp   shaft   power,   745   W   7.1.2. 7.1.2.1. Calculation  Procedure  Power Reduction

The   power   consumption   of   the   heating   system   to   meet   the   heating   load   can   be   broken   down   into   two   parts:   heat   generation   and   heat   delivery.   The   heat   135    

generation   portion   is   the   power   consumed   to   generate   the   heat   to   heat   the   building   and   the   heat   delivery   portion   is   the   power   consumed   to   deliver   the   heat   to   the   space   such   as   by   the   motors   that   drives   the   pumps.    The   heat   generation   portion   is   affected   by   the   heat   generation   efficiency   and   in   this   case   the   coefficient   of   performance   of   the   heat   pump   while   the   delivery   portion   of   the   power   consumption   does   not   change.    The   power   consumed   can   be   expressed   as   follows:

Note   that   both   Heating   Output   and   COP   are   determined   by   reading   Figure   28with   the   desired   operative   temperature   and   supply   water   temperature.   With  

136    

the   water   temperature,   Heating   Output   and   COP   can   be   determined   by   interpolating   Table   12.  

 

Figure41PanelSupplyTemperaturevs.OperativeTemperature
Note   the   sudden   drop   of   supply   temperature   by   around   2Â°C   is   due   to   the   self  check   cycle   of   the   heat   pump.   The   data   have   been   extrapolated   to   15 Â° C   to   estimate   the   potential   energy   savings.   7.1.2.2. Total Energy Consumption over a Day

The   heat   generation   at   the   heat   pumps   exceeds   the   heating   load   of   the   building.   This   would   mean   that   the   heat   pump   and   associated   source   and   sink   pumps   will   cycle   on   and   off.   The   peak   heating   load   is   determined   by   reading   off   Figure   28   when   the   heat   pump   is   operating   in   equilibrium   to   provide   heating   137    

(February   3 r d ).   Since   the   heat   pump   is   operating   in   equilibrium,   the   heating   output   of   the   heat   pump   will   be   the   heating   load   of   the   building.   This   is   used   to   verify   the   ENERPASS   calculated   heating   load   as   discussed   in   Section   7.1.1.   The   linearized   building   heat   transfer   coefficient   is   also   determined   with   the   peak   heating   load:

The   building   heat   transfer   coefficient   is   important   to   determine   the   reduction   of   heating   load   with   the   reduction   of   indoor   temperature.   Assuming   no   startup   and   other   loss,   the   total   energy   consumed   can   be   calculated   by:

Results and Discussion

Several   cases   of   night   time   operative   temperature   reduction   were   calculated   and   are   presented   in   Table   13.   The   normalized   heating   load   "Day   Case"   was   found   to   be   12.74   kW,   which   is   similar   to   engineering   heating   load   derived   from   ENERPASS   as   of   12.9   kW   (Section   7.1.1).   A   reduction   to   an   operative   temperature   of   15Â°C   during   the   night   for   sleep   as   suggested   in   Section   3.6   will   result   in   10.12%   of   energy   reduction   and   reduce   the   runtime   of   the   heat   pump   by   14.49%   while   increasing   the   performance   of   the   heat   pump   by   27.93%.

The   datum   case   is   extrapolated   from   actual   site   data   where   the   building   was   heated   to   an   operative   temperature   of   20.5Â°C   as   can   be   seen   on   Feb   2 n d   as   shown   on   Figure   28   with   an   outdoor   temperature   of   23.4Â°C.   The   building   is   assumed   to   operate   with   16   hours   at   the   daytime   setting   and   8   hours   at   the   night   time   setting.   The   indoor   daytime   operative   temperature   is   the   design   heating   temperature   of   22Â°C.   For   example,   if   the   operative   temperature   was   reduced   to   15Â°C   during   the   night.   The   night   time   heating   load   is   reduced   proportionally   by   the   reduction   of   indoor   operative   temperature   and   outdoor   design   air   temperature   difference.   The   design   heating   load   is   from   22Â°C   indoors   to   18.8Â°C   outdoors   for   a  

140    

temperature   difference   of   40.8Â°C,   while   the   reduced   night   time   temperature   to   15Â°C   will   create   a   smaller   temperature   difference   of   33.8Â°C.   Thus   the   nighttime   heating   load   is   reduced   to   10.55   kW   and   the   day   time   heating   load   remains   at   13.71   kW.     As   the   indoor   air   temperature   is   reduced,   the   leaving   load   temperature   at   the   heat   pump   also   reduces   and   therefore   the   COP   of   the   heat   pump   increases.   The   COP   as   interpolated   from   Table   12   would   increase   to   4.32   from   the   daytime   case   of   3.55   for   a   27.93%   increase.   This   result   in   more   heat   produced   if   the   heat   pump   is   operated   continuously   from   13.71   kW   to   13.97   kW.    This   means   that   the   heat   pump   does   not   need   to   operate   continuously   to   meet   the   heating   load   resulting   in   the   heat   pump   running   75.51%   percent   of   the   time.   To   produce   the   heating   output,   the   heat   pump   consumes   3.24   kW   and   with   the   pumping   energy   it   consumes   4.40   kW.   Weighting   the   reduction   to   the   night   hours   and   day   hour   runtimes,   the   total   heating   energy   required   for   a   day   is   105.4   kWh   compared   to   the   base   case   of   118.3   kWh,   resulting   in   an   overall   energy   reduction   of   10.12%.

Conclusion 
Summary  of  Findings 
Sleep  Thermal  Comfort 

Most   current   research   in   thermal   comfort   is   in   part   derived   from   the   Rohles  Nevins   data   set   (Rohles,   Woods,   &   and   Nevins,   1973)   and   the   steady   state   equations   by   Fanger   (Fanger   P.   ,   1967)   and   Gagge   (Gagge,   Stolwijk,   &   and   Nishi,   1971)   for   the   human   sweat   and   shivering   control.    However,   a   closer   inspection   of   current   literature   by   psychologist   and   physiologists   such   as   Someren   (Someren,   2000)   suggests   that   a   period   of   heat   surplus   or   deficit   can   be   said   as   comfortable   and   in   instances   help   the   patron   complete   specific   tasks   better.   This   is   especially   true   for   sleep   (M.Raymann,   Swaab,   &   Someren,   2008)   and   our   understanding   of   sleep   thermal   regulation   and   comfort   is   insufficient   and   the   data   from   Rohles  Nevins   (Rohles,   Woods,   &   and   Nevins,   1973)   and   (Gagge,   Stolwijk,   &   and   Nishi,   1971)were   derived   from   steady   state   awake   persons.    The   existing   heating   thermal   environment   requirements   were   identified   to   likely   cause   discomfort   during   sleep   for   being   too   warm.   The   conditions   for   sleep   thermal   comfort   had   been   calculated   and   are   in   agreement   with   previous   studies.   A   thermal   model   was   developed   based   on   existing   literature   to   achieve   a   desired   body   surface   temperature   of   32.5Â°C   and   a   heat   loss   rate   of   36   W/m 2 .   142    

Based   on   this   model,   the   operative   temperature   of   a   room   may   be   reduced   down   to   15Â°C   depending   on   the   bedding   insulation   level.   8.1.2. Energy  Efficiency 

An   idealized   calculation   of   the   energy   reduction   due   to   the   room   set   point   reduction   to   achieve   various   desired   operative   temperature   levels   was   performed.   The   calculation   was   performed   over   a   heating   design   day   and   is   based   on   the   reduction   of   operative   temperature   during   8   hours   of   night   and   maintaining   heating   design   temperature   for   the   rest   of   the   day.   The   equipment   performance   data   used   in   the   calculation   is   not   obtained   on   site   but   is   the   specified   performance   by   the   manufacturers.    The   calculation   shows   that   there   is   potentially   up   to   10%   energy   saving   by   reducing   the   set   point   during   the   night   when   people   are   asleep.   With   a   reduced   set   point,   heat   pumps   have   improved   performance   and   reduced   run   time   which   resulted   in   an   estimated   ~1.4%   energy   reduction   per   degree   set   point   reduction   during   the   night.    This   suggests   that   additional   energy   reduction   could   be   achieved   in   residential   buildings   when   they   are   unoccupied.   It   also   suggests   the   use   of   smart   control   units   to   implement   this   set   point   reduction   during   the   night.    8.1.3. Infrared  Sphere  Method  to  Determine  Mean  Radiant  Temperature 

143    

The   Infrared   sphere   method   developed   to   determine   the   mean   radiant   temperature   was   found   to   be   more   resistant   to   direct   sunlight   than   the   black   globe   method   and   is   very   similar   to   the   mean   radiant   temperature   estimated   by   the   surface   temperature   method.    The   success   of   the   Infrared   Sphere   method   also   suggests   the   reflector   approach   is   viable   and   more   practical   for   HVAC   control   and   less   invasive   HVAC   mean   radiant   temperature   or   area   weighted   average   surface   temperature   may   be   developed.    The   reflector   theory   allows   specialized   reflector   shapes   to   allow   the   infrared   sensor   to   be   more   sensitive   in   certain   directions.   This   allows   offsetting   the   sensors   onto   the   walls   instead   of   being   centrally   located   where   the   occupants   are   as   a   black   globe   would   require.   The   relative   simplicity   of   the   Infrared   Sphere   also   lends   itself   as   a   much   more   economical   and   rugged   design   than   the   Black   Globe   method,   which   requires   an   expensive,   sensitive   and   fragile   anemometer   to   determine   air   velocity   and   temperature   to   determine   the   Mean   Radiant   Temperature.    In   summary,   the   infrared   sphere   approach   in   determination   of   the   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   shows   promise   and   should   be   further   explored.   More   tests   and   comparisons   should   be   performed   prior   to   accepting   the   Infrared   Sphere   method   as   an   accurate   approach   to   determine   the   Mean   Radiant   Temperature.  

144    

More   importantly,   the   definition   of   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   should   be   further   refined.   8.1.4. Thermal  Comfort  Comparison 

Agreeing   with   previous   research,   the   radiant   heated   building   was   found   to   be   more   comfortable   than   the   forced   air   heated   building   according   to   ASHRAE   55   (ASHRAE,   2010)criteria.    The   thermal   comfort   comparison   is   not   entirely   valid   as   the   two   building   envelopes   are   different   and   the   field   studies   did   not   occur   coincidently.   However   certain   conclusions   can   be   drawn   such   as   the   system   response   rate   to   a   heating   demand.   The   radiant   heated   system   has   a   quicker   response   than   the   forced   air   system   and   in   a   more   uniform   manner.

Contributions 

1. The   concept   of   sleep   thermal   comfort   has   been   explored   and   relevant   research   from   psychology   and   physiology   has   been   incorporated   in   the   development   of   a   sleep   thermal   model.   The   model   was   found   to   be   in   general   agreement   with   existing   standards   for   sleeping   bags   design.    2. The   radiant   heating   system   was   compared   with   traditional   forced   air   system   in   two   separate   buildings   in   terms   of   the   thermal   environment   created   according   to   existing   thermal   comfort   standards.   The   field   measurements   of   a   radiant   heated   building   have   shown   that   the   operative   145    

temperature   achieved   is   closer   to   an   average   of   22 Â° C;   this   would   suggest   that   overheating   of   an   average   sleeping   person   is   likely   and   that   there   is   a   possibility   of   energy   consumption   reduction   which   can   be   achieved   by   lowering   the   operative   temperature   during   the   hours   of   sleep.   3. The   Infrared   Sphere   approach   to   determine   mean   radiant   temperature   has   been   developed   and   tested   in   two   different   field   study   locations   with   different   heating   systems   and   building   envelopes.   At   both   instances,   the   mean   radiant   temperature   determined   by   the   Infrared   Sphere   approach   agrees   well   with   the   mean   radiant   temperature   derived   via   traditional   methods.   4. The   thermal   model   was   used   to   calculate   the   energy   reduction   associated   with   the   reduction   of   operative   temperature   for   sleep   comfort.

Recommendation  of  Future  Work 

The   limitation   of   this   research   is   that   it   only   looked   at   established   comfort   criteria   as   the   basis   of   design.   It   is   inherently   limited   to   radiant   ceiling   systems   thus   will   not   apply   to   wall   and   floor   systems.   The   experiment   was   setup   in   an   existing   house   with   an   operational   radiant   heated   ceiling;   this   house   is   not   a   typical   house   with   insulation,   air   tightness   and   glazing   being   superior   to   code,   thus   may   not   be   representative   of   other   installations.    The   recommended   future   works   are:

1. Currently   there   is   no   single   accepted   definition   of   sleep   thermal   comfort   nor   is   it   defined   in   detail.   This   has   caused   variations   in   its   determination.   For   example   Bischof   et   al   (Bischof,   Madsen,   Clausen,   Madsen,   &   Wildschodtz,   1993)   used   the   Predicted   Mean   Vote   method   and   Huang   (Huang,   2008)   used   the   ASHRAE   Thermal   Neutrality   method,   but   the   results   attained   are   similar.    However,   at   higher   level   of   clothing,   the   thermal   comfort   condition   differences   become   much   more   pronounced.   Further   research   into   the   methodology   of   determining   sleep   thermal   comfort   is   necessary   for   the   progression   of   the   science.   2. The   definition   of   sleep   thermal   comfort   should   have   strong   theoretical   backing   and   be   supported   by   strenuous   empirical   data.   The   thermal   comfort   model   currently   used   has   not   been   extensively   tested   and   the   conditions   it   abides   to   were   derived   from   limited   small   scale   studies.   This   suggests   that   this   model   may   not   be   accurate   but   is   found   to   be   in   overall   agreement   with   other   studies.   Further   research   into   the   definition   of   determining   sleep   thermal   comfort   is   suggested.   3. The   Infrared   Sphere   approach   to   determine   mean   radiant   temperature   have   been   tested   in   two   distinct   different   field   study   locations   with   different   heating   systems   and   envelope.   At   both   instances,   it   had   agreed   with   the   mean   radiant   temperature   derived   via   traditional   means.   This  

147    

suggests   that   the   infrared   method   may   be   a   viable   method   to   determine   mean   radiant   temperature,   and   further   validation   is   required.    4. The   development   of   the   Infrared   Sphere   approach   also   highlighted   the   existing   inconsistency   and   limitation   of   the   definition   and   determination   of   mean   radiant   temperature.   More   so,   this   research   questions   the   usability   of   mean   radiant   temperature   for   HVAC   control   and   the   inherent   difficulties   in   designing   interior   thermal   environments   to   meet   specific   location   based   comfort   standards.   This   prompts   the   development   of   a   gross   environment   based   standard   which   is   a   function   of   the   space   instead   of   being   a   function   of   the   occupants.   Thus   allowing   building   control   systems   to   operate   on   sensors   which   are   inherently   gross   environment   based.   5. What   could   be   drawn   from   this   study   is   that   design   parameter   of   the   radiant   system   is   different   than   traditional   forced   air   or   convector   systems   and   a   separate   design   and   operating   guideline   should   be   developed.    6. The   building   management   system   at   the   Caledon   site   theoretically   can   implement   the   set   point   reduction.   However   the   building   management   system   was   offline   during   the   field   study   and   was   being   operated   manually.   Further   work   should   be   completed   such   as   energy   simulation   and   actual   field   studies   to   verify   actual   energy   reductions.   148    

7. A   gap   in   knowledge   was   identified   between   engineering   researchers   and   psychology/physiology   researchers.   Engineering   researchers   focused   on   factors   external   to   the   body   which   engineering   normally   controls   and   fails   to   report   on   internal   factors   when   determining   thermal   comfort.   Likewise   psychology/physiology   researchers   fail   to   quantify   the   external   factors   in   detail   and   focus   mainly   on   the   internal   factors.   As   thermal   comfort   is   an   interaction   between   the   human   body   and   its   environment,   a   more   integrated   research   with   both   engineering   and   psychology/physiology   researchers   will   be   beneficial   to   the   overall   understanding   of   the   science.   8. The   appropriateness   and   applicability   of   existing   thermal   comfort   standards   such   as   ISO   7730   and   ASHRAE   55   for   residential   buildings   is   questioned.   This   is   especially   acute   for   the   sleep   condition   and   for   high   performance   buildings   with   efficient   envelopes.

Operative   Temperature  

The   operative   temperature   is   a   hypothetical   temperature   representing   both   the   combination   of   the   radiant   environment   and   the   convective   environment   where   both   radiant   temperature   and   convective   temperature   is   equal.   The   operative   temperature   is   at   the   condition   which   this   hypothetical   condition   is   exchanging   the   same   amount   of   heat   as   per   the   actual   non   uniform   thermal   environment.  

Plane   Radiant   Temperature   

Plane   radiant   temperature   is   the   area   weighted   average   temperature   of   a   surface   with   view   factor.   Traditionally   this   is   calculated   by   the   radiant   flux   acting   on   a   small   plane   element   facing   the   measured   surface.   Where   the   element   is   located   where   the   center   of   mass   of   a   seated   or   standing   person   should   be,   0.6   meters   and   1.2   meters   above   the   floor.  

Radiant   Temperature   Asymmetry  

Radiant   Temperature   Asymmetry   is   defined   as   the   difference   of   radiant   temperature   as   recorded   by   two   back   to   back   small   plane   measurements   setup   to   represent   the   center   of   mass   of   a   person.   Each   small   plane   element   is   measuring   the   radiant   flux   as   received   by   the   surfaces   it   is   facing.   Therefore,   radiant   temperature   asymmetry   translates   directly   to   different   radiant  

150    

temperatures.   Note   that   existing   data   developed   with   a   relatively   constant   operative   temperature,   id   est.,   air   temperature   was   increased   or   decreased   according   to   the   radiant   environment.    Vertical   Radiant   Temperature   Difference   Horizontal   Radiant   Temperature    Difference   Mean   Radiant   Temperature   The   mean   radiant   temperature   is   the   average   radiant   temperature   an   average   male   body   will   interface   within   a   certain   location   within   a   space.    Air   Temperature   Mean   Air   Velocity   Temperature   of   Air   located   at   the   center   of   mass   of   a   person.   Omnidirectional   air   velocity   located   at   the   center   of   mass   of   a   person.   Thermal   Comfort   The   condition   of   mind   that   expresses   satisfaction   with   the   thermal   environment   Radiant   Environment   The   environmental   condition   which   a   person   radiantly   exchange   heat   to   and   from.

151    

Convective   Environment   Thermal   Environment   Relative   Humidity  

The   environmental   condition   which   a   person   convectively   exchange   heat   to   and   from.   The   combined   environmental   condition   of   a   radiant   environment   and   a   convective   environment.    The   ratio   of   actual   moisture   vapor   pressure   at   the   center   of   mass   of   a   person   over   the   theoretical   maximum   vapor   pressure   limit   at   the   relevant   air   temperature.  

Thermally   Neutral   

The   state   of   a   person's   thermal   interaction   with   a   thermal   environment   that   heat   gain   and   heat   loss   via   convection,   conduction   and   radiation   is   balanced   and   there   is   no   net   heat   gain   or   loss.
