Abstract
PHASE SEPARATION BY SPINODAL DECOMPOSITION IN POLYMER BLENDS UNDER A SINGLE AND DOUBLE QUNECH: A COMPUTATIONAL STUDY
Tuyet T ran M aster of Applied Science in Chemical Engineering, 2004 Ryerson University A mathematical model and computer simulations were used to describe the dynamics of thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) by spinodal

decomposition for polymer blends (single quench and double quench) using the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard theory and the Flory-Huggins-de Gennes hee energy. The importance o f TIPS is to enhance material properties such as toughness, impact resistance, and elasticity. Therefore, controlling the moiphology is a The numerical results for the single

critical factor in optimizing performance.

quench are consistent with known characteristics of phase separation by spinodal decomposition observed in polymer blends. The numerical results for double

quenching replicate recently published experimental and numerical work. Under a double quench the numerical work shows that a critical quench depth exists before secondary phase separation occurs, the growth rate of the primary and secondary structures are dependent on domain size and early stage dynamics for the secondary structures, after the second jump, appears to follow the linear CahnHilliard theory.

Introduction
A num ber o f industrial processes use the technique of phase separation to produce m aterials for everyday use [Leblond, 2002]. Applications include the formation of membranes, for separation processes [Mulder, 1996], the formation o f polymer dispersed liquid crystal films for electro optical devices [Doane, 1989;

N wabunm a et a i, 2000], the production of high impact r esistant materials [Chow, 1980; Utracki, 1991] in the plastics industry, coatings o f capsules [Leblond, 2002] in the pharmaceutical industry, and the production of low fat spreads [Harding et al., 1995] in the food industry. Therefore, research, both experimental and numerical, in understanding how phase separation occurs in polymer blends to control the morphology for specific applications is important.

1.1

The Mechanisms of Phase Separation in Polymer Blends

The mechanism o f phase separation depends on the location o f a polymer blend in the phase diagram. Figure 1.1 shows a typical temperature versus composition phase diagram labeling the different regions of interest in studying phase separation kinetics. Figure 1.1 is called an upper critical solution temperature

The solid thick black curve is the binodal (equilibrium) curve and the thin black line is the spinodal curve. The spinodal curve separates the two known mechanisms o f phase separation namely, (i) nucléation and growth (NG), and (ii) spinodal decomposition (SD). The regions between the bimodal

If the polymer mixture is quenched into the meta-stable region, phase separation occurs by NG and the droplet type structure is formed. If the polymer mixture is quenched into the unstable region, phase separation occurs by SD and two morphologies are developed, droplet (off critical quench) and interconnected (critical quench). Depending on the location o f the quench, the droplet type structure has a different continuous phase (surrounding matrix) and dispersed phase as indicated by the reversal o f the black and white regions as shown in the SD structures, droplets rich in one contained within a continuous phase rich within the other polymer. These droplets are randomly distributed and vary in size. In the unstable region, spinodal decomposition occurs. This is the result o f a quench into the

-3

Chapter 1: Introduction
unstable region where the onset of small concentration fluctuations causes phase separation. Depending on the concentration o f the polymer mixture, two types o f structures can be obtained. When the concentration of the polymer mixture is

equal to the critical concentration, the structure obtained is interconnected. For polymer concentrations not equal to the critical concentration (off-critical quench), a droplet type structure is obtained. Also obsei'ved in Figure 1.2 is the difference in the continuous and dispersed phases depending on the location o f the quench in the phase diagram as illustrated with the di'oplet formation by SD. On the left hand side, the droplet type stmcture has a continuous phase where the sunounding matrix is represented by white and dispersed phase by black droplets. On the right hand side, the continuous and dispersed phases are reversed. Therefore, depending on the desired properties for the blend, the continuous and dispersed phases are obtained accordingly.

Figures 1.3 and 1.4 show the evolution o f the one-dimensional concentration profiles for phase separation by NG and SD respectively. In the meta-stable region, a sufficient increase in the composition fluctuations will cause a increase in the free energy o f the mixture and cause phase separation by NG. Nuclei are formed and grow where the diffusional flux is inward as indicated in Figure 1.3 by the arrows at time i,. This process is an activated process in that an energy barrier must be overcome in order for this type o f phase separation to occur. The patterns that occur as time increases for NG upon overcoming the energy barrier are shown in Figure 1.3. In the unstable region, infinitely small concentration

4-

Chapter I; Introduction
fluctuations ate enough to di'ive the mixture to phase separate and therefore, there is no energy hairier to overcome. The composition fluctuations occur by "uphill diffusion where the gradient in composition moves hom low concentration to

high concentration as indicated by the airows in the initial profile of Figure 1.4. The different stages in the evolution of the composition fluctuations for the unstable region shows the initial growth to the coaisening o f the mixture where the phase separated regions become larger. A detailed description of the three stages o f SD is presented in Chapter 3.

1.2

Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS)

Phase separation of a binaiy polymer mixture may occur when rapid cooling or heating is applied, shear is applied or the initiation of a reaction occurs. Such

methods are called thermally induced phase sepaiation (TIPS), shear induced phase separation (SIPS) and polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS), respectively. The simplest method to induce phase separation is by rapidly

decreasing or increasing (depending on the shape of the phase diagram) the tem perature o f the mixture from the one phase region into the two-phase region of the phase diagram. The temperature is rapidly increased for the lower critical

solution temperature (LCST) phase diagram. For the UCST the temperature is rapidly decreased to induce phase separation. Thermally induced phase

Chapter 1: Introduction
separation is commonly used in the study o f phase separation in polymer systems [Strobl, 1985; Chakrabarti et al., 1990; Takenaka et al., 1992; Tanaka, 1993; Zhang et al., 1995]. The TIPS method is described according to Figure 1.5. In this method, often a temperature versus composition phase diagram is constm cted to determine where the quench conditions should be made in order to form particular micro structures. In Figure 1.5, the system has an UCST, where the Tc is the critical point and is the highest temperature at which phase separation may occur. Initially, a homogeneous mixture of polymer 1 and polymer 2 is obtained at a temperature in region A. This mixture is then subjected to a rapid decrease in temperature well into the unstable region of the phase diagram to a temperature Tj (point B). Upon decreasing the temperature, the thermodynamic driving force is increased and in order to minimize the free energy, the mixture separates into two phases. The tie line connects the two phases coexisting phases at equilibrium. The resulting moiphology is then a continuous phase made of polymer 1 dispersed in the phase o f polymer 2.

1.3

Two-Step TIPS method

Another technique to generate different phase separated morphologies is the twostep or double quenching [Tanaka, 1993; Hashimoto et a i, 2000a] TIPS method. The mechanisms o f NG and SD are still applicable to this technique. Figure 1.6 shows the phase diagram for a double quench case showing the different morphologies that are possible for the initial critical and initial off-

The horizontal line running across this phase diagram is a tie line that relates the composition o f polymer 1 in the two coexisting phases, c / and equilibrium compositions o f polymer 1. represents the

critical quench by SD. In Figure 1.6, there are two types o f morphologies that can be obtained by double quenching. For an initial critical quench at temperature Ty, the interconnected structure is obtained and allowed to phase separate for a period o f time. After a time, t, while the mixture is still within the spinodal region, the temperature is dropped again to T} and because the mixture is now in the offcritical state, the morphology is o f droplet type. Therefore, the resulting structure is interconnected with small droplets dispersed within. For the initial off-critical quench to Ty, the droplet type structure is obtained and allowed to phase separate for a period o f time before quenching to T;. At this point the mixture is still offcritical and droplets dispersed within droplets are observed as well as the formation o f droplets in the continuous phase. This two-step method is a

Chapter 1: Introduction
this thesis will be completed according to the method and approach shown in the flow chart in Figure 1.7. The flow chart can be broken down into different tasks. The first stage involves a detailed search o f the literature to determine the different models that have been used to describe phase separation by SD for polymer blends. The literature review will also involve reviewing published

experimental work for different analytical techniques used for studying phase separation. The next step involves determining what is lacking in the literature and how mathematical modeling and computer simulations can help fill these gaps to further understand phase separation. This leads to the thesis objectives. To answer the objectives, the model is developed and tested with published experimental and numerical work. The model is then refined if the numerical work does not reflect what is known to occur experimentally.

Thesis Organization

The thesis is broken down into a total o f nine chapters and is organized in the following manner:

Chapter 1: This chapter introduces phase separation and the importance o f studying it. It details the different mechanism involved in phase separation as

well as the different methods to induce phase sepaiation. The focus is on the m ethod o f thermally induced phase separation for a single step and a two-step process. This leads to the thesis objectives and the methodology and approach.

Chapter 2
Literature Review
The importance o f phase separation and its application in many industries is introduced in this section. Being able to control the morphology of the phase separating material is a critical factor in optimizing the performance of these materials and therefore, studying the kinetics o f phase separation (experimentally and theoretically) is a vital part of the design process. This section summarizes the research that has been conducted to study phase separation by SD under the TIPS method for polymer blends. The fust section introduces earlier studies on a single temperature jump process. The second section describes a commonly

obsei'ved phenomenon in experimental investigations of phase sepaiation, the secondary phase separated stiucture. The process used to develop this type of structure is what is called double quenching [Tanaka, 1993] or the two-step TIPS process [Hashimoto et a l, 2000]. Both numerical and experimental work has been used to investigate this phenomenon to better understand the morphological development in phase separation.

2.1

Single Quench TIPS Studies on Polymer Systems

The interest in studying phase separation by SD is not only due to the large number o f applications it has in industi"y but also in helping to further understand the non-equilibrium thermodynamics o f phase separating mixtures [Hashimoto et a i , 1986; Ohnaga and Inoue, 1989; Hashimoto et al., 2000]. The simplest

m ethod o f producing phase-separated microstmctures is by single quench TIPS and is used to experimentally study phase separation phenomena in polymer systems. From the single quench condition, the possible moiphologies and the control o f theii' formation are well understood with the vast amount o f both experimental and numerical work that has been published. Therefore, this section highlights the most important findings for chaiacterizing phase separation by SD in both experimental and numerical work.

O f particular importance to the experimental study of phase separation by SD is the work o f Hashimoto et al. [Hashimoto et a i, 1983; Izumitani et al., 1985; Izumitani and Hashimoto, 1985; Hashimoto et al., 1986a; Hashimoto et a i, 1986b; Inaba et al., 1986; Jinnai et al., 1986; Shibayama et al., 1986; Takenaka et al., 1987; Izumitani et a i, 1990; Takenaka et al., 1990; Hashimoto et a i, 1991; Jinnai et al., 1991; Takenaka et al, 1992; Hashimoto, 1993; Takenaka and Hashimoto, 1994; Hashimoto et al., 1994; Ribbe and Hashimoto, 1997; Yamada et al., 1988; Takeno and Hashimoto, 1998; Vaidya et al, 2001] who used light scattering techniques to characterize the evolution of phase separation by SD for various polymer blends. In their work on a mixture o f SBR/PB [Izumitani et al..

-17-

Chapter 2: Literature Review
1985], they were able to do an in-depth analysis on the kinetics of phase separation in the very early stages o f SD because of the slow rate of phase separ ation o f this mixture. They showed that the early stages of phase sépar ation by SD can be described by the linear ized Cahn-Hilliaid theory [Cahn, 1965] and the growth o f the maximum scattering intensity in the early stages is exponential. They also showed the limit o f the early stages before nonlinear growth patterns w ere observed. Following the study on of SBR/PB, they were able to char acterize the different stages o f phase separation by SD into an early, intermediate and late stage [Hashimoto et al., 1986a] for a mixture of PS/PVME. It has been argued that the stages can be furlher broken down [Strobl, 1985], however, the three stages are most commonly presented in the literature (see Figure 1.4) and are representative o f the evolution of SD for polymer blends. In fiulher studies, after characterizing the three stages, attention was paid to individual stages for various mixtures. In the early stages of phase séparation by SD, for a mixture of

PS/PVME under critical quench conditions, they were able to show that the linearized Cahn theory [Cahn, 1965] well predicted the early stages o f phase separation [Hashimoto et al., 1986a]. A number of other studies they conducted also show that the linearized Cahn-Hilliar d theory holds for the early stages o f SD for polymer blends [Hashimoto et al., 1983; Hashimoto et al., 1986b; Izumitani et al., 1990; Takenaka and Hashimoto, 1994]. A later study on the early stages of SD and the effects o f molecular weight distribution was examined [Takenaka and Hashimoto, 1994]. They found that the linear- Cahn-Hilliard theory also The intermediate stage o f phase

reasonably described the early stages of SD.

-18-

Chapter 2: Literature R eview
separation by SD has been discussed both in the early stage and late stage publications [Hashimoto et al., 1986a; Hashimoto et a i, 1986b; Takenaka et al., 1990; Hashimoto, 1993]. Remarks have been made on the com position

fluctuations in the intermediate stage as well as the growth of the scaled structure factor. In the intermediate stages, the wavelength and the amplitude o f the

composition fluctuations continue to grow and are indicated by the new scaling relations introduced for wave number and intensity [Hashimoto et a i , 1986b]. The morphology developed in the intermediate stage upon phase separation by SD can be described by the scaled structure factor. The scaled structure factor was found to increase with time and is not universal [Takenaka et al., 1990]. This indicates that phase separ ation has not reached thermodynamic equilibrium. In the study o f the late stages o f phase separation by SD, the following results were obtained for understanding the growth patterns [Hashimoto et a i, 1986b;

Izumitani et al., 1990; Takenaka et al, 1990; Jinnai et a i, 1991; Hashimoto et a i, 1994]. They introduced reduced variables for the analysis o f the late stages o f SD, and found scaling laws to fit the late stages of SD. These scaling laws for the reduced wave number and reduced scattering intensity fall onto a master curve when plotted against reduced time at different quench conditions indicating that the late stage coar sening o f SD is the same regardless of temperature [Hashimoto et al., 1986b]. The morphology developed upon phase separation by SD was For a mixture o f

described by the scaled structrrre factor for late stages.

PS/PVM E under critical quench conditions, Hashimoto et al. [Hashimoto et al., 1986a; Takenaka et al, 1992; Takenaka et al., 1990], were able to show that the

-19-

Chapter 2: Literature Review
scaled stiucture factor follows relatively well with the tlieory of late stage dynamics in metal alloys, small moleculai' liquids and glasses [Hashimoto et al., 1986a]. Like the scaling laws for reduced scattering intensity, the scaled stiucture factor also falls onto a master cuiwe indicating that the growth of the pattern in the late stages grow with dynamical self-similaiity. Hashimoto et al. [Takenaka et

al., 1987; Jmnai et al., 1993] also examined different parameters associated with SD, for instance, the temperature dependence of the Onsager kinetic coefficient. The Onsager coefficient is an important paiameter that describes the mobility of the blend. The reason for studying the temperature dependence of the Onsager coefficient was to validate the theoretical work by Pincus [1981] and Binder [1983] and the results were within reasonable agreement [Jinnai et a i, 1993].

Other experimental work that has been conducted in studying phase sepaiation by SD using the TIPS method [Celles and Frank, 1983; Okada and Han, 1986; Strobl et ah, 1986; Schwahn et a i, 1987; Bates and Wiltzius, 1989; Kyu and Saldanha, 1998; Wiltzius et ah, 1988; Lee and Kyu, 1990; Schwahn et a i, 1990; Kyu and Lim, 1991; Gorga et al., 2002]. The analysis of these mixtures also follows

closely to the observations that were made by Hashimoto et al. except for the work o f Wiltzius et al. [1988] who observe a different scaling pattern for the late stages o f phase separation by SD in that the evolution of the scaled structure factor does not fall onto a master curve as was observed for Hashimoto s work. In terms o f numerical work, there have been a number o f publications on modeling and computer simulation of phase separation by SD for binary polymer blends. The nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) equation and the Flory-Huggins-de

-20

Chapter 2: Literature R eview
Gennes (F-H-de Geimes) free energy density are used in the model development to describe the dynamics o f phase separation by SD. The parameters contained within the C-H and F-H-de Gennes equations, mobility (containing the transport information o f the individual polymers) and the energy gradient coefficient (accounting for the resistance to the phase separation process due to the development o f interfaces to tiy and restore the system to its lowest energy level) have been assumed to be a function of composition [Zhang et al., 1995; Chakrabarti et a i, 1990; Glotzer, 1995; Kontis and Muthukumar, 1992;

Castellano and Glotzer, 1995; Aiiyapadi and Nauman, 1991; Castellano and Corberi, 2000]. Constant mobility has been used for simplicity by various authors in studying the dynamics of phase separation for polymer blends [Brown and Chakrabarti, 1993a; Ohnaga et a l, 1989; Brown and Chakiabaiti, 1993b; Roth et al., 2002; Chakiabarti et al., 1989]. Other more complex studies carried out using the nonlinear C-H and F-H-de Gennes free energy have been used to model a ternary polymer blend undergoing phase separation by SD in two-dimensions to observe pattern formation [Nauman and Qiwei, 1994] and SD in poly dispersed polymer mixtures [Takenaka et al., 1993].

Analysis from the numerical work has focused on a variety of different aspects. A common investigation is in the evolution o f the concentration profiles in onedimension [Ohnaga et a l, 1989; Nauman and Qiwei, 2001; Castellano and Glotzer, 1995] to further understand the mechanism of phase separation by SD. In observing pattern formation, a two-dimensional model is used where a critical quench produces an interconnected structure and an off critical quench produces a

-21-

Chapter 2: Literature Review
droplet type stiucture [Matsuoka and Yamamoto, 1995; C astellano and Glotzer, 1995; Brown and Chakrabarti, 1993b; Castellano and Corberi, 2000; Nauman and Qiwei, 2001; Ariyapadi and Nauman, 1991]. There has also been modelling in three dimensions to investigate phase separation [Chakrabaili et al., 1989]. Analysis o f the stm cture obtained has been performed by evaluating the evolution o f the structure factor for critical [Chaki'abaili et al., 1990; Brown and

Chakrabarti, 1993b; Kontis and Muthukumar, 1992; Zhang et al., 1995] and off critical quenches [Kontis and Muthukumai', 1992;, Zhang et al., 1995; Brown and Chakrabarti, 1993b]. Finally, investigating the pinning of phase separated

structures has also been an area of interest for studying polymer blends [Castellano and Corberi, 2000; Castellano and Glotzer, 1995]. The analysis ties in very w ell with the experimentally observed chai acteristics of phase separation by SD. For instance, the one-dimensional model [Ohnaga et al., 1989] has shown the evolution o f the phase sepai ation by SD according to the three stages describe by Hashimoto e ta l. [Hashimoto et a i, 1986a]. In investigating the growth o f the initial composition fluctuations in the early stages of SD, a single maximum wave num ber was observed and the evolution of the stmcture factor grow exponentially with tim e [Chakrabarti et a l, 1990]. This exponential growth in the stm ctuie factor is also consistent with experimental investigations on the evolution o f the light scattering data [Okada and Han, 1986]. Also, in terms of the evolution o f pattern formation for the critical and off critical quench, the numerical twodimensional results show the interconnected stm cture for the off critical quench

22-

Chapter 2: Literature R eview
and the droplet type structure for the off critical quench case which have been observed in experiment [Hashimoto, 1993].

2.2

Two - Step TIPS Studies in Polymer Systems

The drive for possibly obtaining more diverse moiphologies to be used has prompted new techniques to produced phase sepai ated materials. For instance, the introduction o f a temperature gradient [Okinaka and Tran-Cong, 1995] and the introduction a concentration gradient [Lacasta et al., 1994] to develop new morphologies that are anisotropic in nature have found applications in holograms and pharmaceutical products. There is then motivation to consider double

[Tanaka, 1993] or two-step phase [Hashimoto et a l, 2000] sepaiation as yet another kind o f morphology that can perhaps be put to practical use. RefeiTing back to Figure 1.6, the method of double quenching and the types o f morphologies that have been observed in experiment for a critical quench [Tao et a i , 1995] and an off critical quench [Tanaka, 1993] were shown. In the critical and the off-critical quench case the method of double quenching is the same. The mixture is quenched to Ti (within the unstable region of the phase diagram) where phase sepai ation by SD is allowed to proceed for a certain period of time before it is quenched again to the second temperature (the mixture is still within the

unstable region). Double quenching [Tanaka, 1993] or two-step phase separation [Hashimoto et al., 2000] for polymer systems has been studied since the late 1980s [Cai-mesin et al., 1986; Ohnaga et al., 1989] to 1990s [Yang et a l, 1998; Tanaka and Araki, 1998; Clarke et a l, 1995; Tao et a l, 1995; Chen et a l, 1994;

-23-

Chapter 2: Literature Revieyv
Tanaka, 1994; Tanaka, 1993; Kwak et al., 1993; Ohnaga et al., 1994]. The

m ajoiity o f these studies are focused on secondary stmctures experimentally with little theoretical explanation o f the obsen ations. Some numerical work has been done in one-dimension to explore the effects of a double quench [Ohnaga et al., 1989] and even continuous quenching [Ohnaga et al., 1994] on the concentration profiles but again, there was no in-depth analysis based on the fundamentals o f phase separation by SD. A 2-dimensional numerical study has been performed on fluid mixtures by Tanaka and Aiaki [Tanaka and Araki, 1998] but the model developm ent and the finding do not pertain to polymer mixtures. M ore recently, double quenching was revisited experimentally by Hashimoto et al. [Hashimoto et al., 2000; Hay as hi et a i, 2000a; Hay as hi et al., 2000b] who examined at a fundam ental level, what was occurring under the quench conditions.

Furtherm ore, in industrial processing, heating and cooling are involved in a continuous sense and therefore, the simpler two-step quenching can provide a stepping stone for understanding more complex real systems [Carmesin et. al, 1986]. It is also worth mentioning that this type o f secondary structure has also been observed in polymer solutions (binaiy and ternary) [Tanaka, 1993;

Y am am ura et a i, 2002; Graca et a i, 2002] and biopolymer mixtures related to food studies [Norton and Frith, 2001]. Therefore, an in-depth analysis o f

secondai-y phase separation in polymer blends can also provide useful information for explaining the same phenomena that occurs in other systems. Future work, as suggested by Hashimoto et al. [Hayashi et a i, 2000b], would be to revisit m athem atical modeling and computer simulation o f double phase separation to

-24-

Chapter 2: Literature R eview
see whether their experimental observations and in depth analysis of secondary phase separation also prevail in the modeling. A recent publication by Henderson and Clarke [2004] followed the method of Hashimoto et al. very closely [Hayashi et a l , 2000b] to model double phase separation for polymer blends. Their

numerical results on the investigation of double quenching at an initial critical composition were in agreement with the work of Hashimoto. Some important

questions about the foimation of secondary stmctui'es are how it develops, when it develops and what effects it has on the final product formed. To answer some o f these questions, a summary o f some of the key works in the literature on the study o f double quenching and the formation of secondary structures is provided in chi'onological order. Ohnaga and Inoue [1989] perfoimed the first numerical

study o f double quenching and them study aimed at providing a framework for designing materials (polymers) that required continuous thermal treatment. They studied polymer mixtures of polystyrene/'poly(vinyl methyl ether) and

polybutadiene/poly(styi ene co-butadiene) undergoing

a double quench by

mathematical modeling using the nonlinear C-H equation and computer simulations. The numerical results were presented in one-dimension for the polymer mixtures, one exhibiting a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) (polystyrene/polyCvinyl methyl ether)) and the other an UCST Their

investigation was split into two sections. First, the concentration fluctuations for an isothermal quench from the one-phase to the two-phase region were examined. They showed that their model o f the time evolution of the concentration

Chapter 2: Literature Review
fluctuations was consistent with the obseiA ed characteristics of piiase sepaiation by SD for the early to late stages [Hashimoto, 1993], The second test was for a double quench where the first quench was allowed to progress for a ceitain period o f tim e in the tw o-phase region before the second quench took place. They

investigated the effects o f a shallower and deeper quench and concluded fi'om their simulations that when the second quench depth, A73 is less than half o f the

first quench depth, y A7[, the concentration fluctuations decay from the original

concentration fluctuations o f AT]. When AT3 is between AT] and ^ AT], there is an initial decay in the concentration fluctuations for a short period o f time before it gradually grows and when A73 is greater than AT] , the concentration fluctuations originally from the first quench appear to show additional smaller waves (crests) forming in between the troughs. They also found that the smaller waves occuired only when the initial concentration fluctuations were well developed. Ohnaga and Inoue [ 1989] were able to deteimine the effects of deeper and shallower quenches for a polymer blend through observations o f the concentration profiles and the effects of quenching at an earlier time or later time to see the effects on the phase sepaiation process.

Experim ental work is necessary to deteimine whether observations from sim ulation hold true for polymer systems as there are still many uncertainties in understanding double phase sepai ation. In terms o f equilibrium thermodynamics, experim ental work helps to answer many questions. For example, what changes are occurring when double phase separation is observed or when the growths o f

- 26 -

Chapter 2: Literature R eview
the amplitude o f the concentration fluctuations are just magnified, is there any relationship that can be made between the growth rates of the initial wavelengths and the secondary wavelengths, how is the development o f the initial wavelength affected by the rising o f the second wavelengths, and how significant a value for the second wavelength is required before there is a significant change in the pattern formation (i.e. secondary stmcture forming within already initial phase separating stmcture)? Some of these questions were qualitatively answered

though the experimental investigations o f forming secondary stmctures using both polymer blends and solutions in the work by Tanaka. [1993]. Tanaka

experimentally studied a mixture of polystyrene (PS) /poly (vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) and PVME/water undergoing a double quench to examine the evolution o f the morphology using phase-contrast microscopy. The composition used in this study for PS-PVME was 50-50 wt% mixture, and that for PVEM-water was 5-95 wt% mixture. For both systems, a two-step quench was initiated and the Three trials

perfonned on the PS-PVME mixture to observe what occurs at different quench depths. Figure 2.1 shows a schematic representation of the quench sequence used in Tanaka's work. The first case was from point I to point B (first temperature jump) and then horn point B to point C (second temperature jump). The second case the PS-PVME mixture was subjected to a shallower quench at A and then a deep quench into the unstable region to observe the pattern formation (point I to point A and then point C). Finally, the third trial was reversed from a deeper

-27-

Chapter 2: Literature R eview
quench to a shallower quench from point I to point C (first temperature jump) and then point C to point B (second temperature jump).

In the first case (I to B to C), double phase separation was observed and small domains appeared within the large domains that were continuously phase separating. After the second temperature jump to T2 , the secondary droplets

appeared after a certain period of time. The small droplets eventually disappeared as they combined and diffused towards the interface o f the large domains. In the second case, for the same mixture at the same composition, there was a change in the initial tem perature to a higher initial value and then quenched to T2 (I to A to C). The resulting morphology observed was very different from the first case. Double phase separation was observed at a much earlier time, almost immediately after the second jum p. Rather than the large droplets observed in case one, the phase separated structure appeared like long round rods shifting in position before it becam e o f droplet type at a later time. The last case o f a deep quench to a shallow quench (I to C to B) showed laige droplets in the initial quench and after the second quench interface instability was observed because of the diffusion o f PVM E through the interface towards the exterior o f the droplets causing the interface to deform. One trial was perfoimed for the polymer solution

PV M E/w ater and double phase separation was obsei'ved much more readily as the diffusion process is much more rapid. Form these experimental observations, Tanaka concluded that in all cases, the variables that affect secondary phase form ation are the initial and final quench temperatures (ATy and AT;) and the tim e taken before the first phase separation process to occur before making the second

Figure 2.4 shows the same asymmetric phase diagram with the possible mechanisms proposed by Tanaka excluding the reverse case from a deeper to a shallower quench [Adapted from Tanaka, 1993]. The location o f the

initial starting point for the second quench has a large impact on the possible formation o f the secondary phase separated regions. In his qualitative analysis, he points out that the growth o f the secondary structures may be a result o f NG for

-29-

Chapter 2: Literature Review
both phases, SD for both phases or a combination of NG for one phase and SD for the other. M ore experimental work was performed on different polymer mixtures to obseiwe pattern formation by Kwak et al. [1993]. They experimentally investigated the emerging m oiphology during a two-step phase separation process for a mixture of polystyi-ene/poly(2-chlorostyiene)/n-butyl phthalate blend exhibiting a LCST using an initial off critical composition for the temperature jump. Like Tanaka [1993], Kwak et al. examined the effect of increasing the driving force on phase separation. An scarming electron microscope and light scattering apparatus was used to captm e images and data of double phase separation and hom the time evolution o f th en images, they were able to observe the same characteristics as Tanaka did for the PS-PVME mixture [Tanaka, 1993]. After the second jump, small domains started to appear and grew within the already existing domains until the small domains eventually stopped growing and gradually decreased in number. Finally, the small domains disappeared and only the large domains

continued to grow. Light scattering (which has not yet been used as a method o f analysis for double phase separation) was used to determine the change in the characteristic length (defmed as T - -- ) before and after the second temperature q jum p. T is the wavelength or the chaiacteristic length and q is the scattering

vector. A plot o f the growth rate of the characteristic length with time before and after the second quench showed that the characteristic length o f the large domains, after the second quench, continued to grow but at a substantially slower rate than for a single quench. This piece of information provides a deeper insight

-30-

Chapter 2: Literature R eview
into how the growth of the primary phase separating domains is affected by the second quench and by the formation of the secondary domains. An attempt was made by Kwak et al. [1993] to fonnulate an empirical expression to describe the change in the domain size upon making the second temperature jump. Their expression was only good for the early period of the second jump.

Following previous work by Ohnaga and Inoue [1989] on modeling and computer simulation o f phase separ ation at different quench depths, Ohnaga et al. [1994] used the same ideas to study reaction induced phase sepai'ation in

monomer/polymer mixtures, in this case, poly(ether sulfone) (PES)/ diglycidyl ether o f bisphenol A (epoxy), by mathematical modeling and computer simulation in one-dimension under continuous quench conditions. A shift o f the phase

diagram as the molecular weight of the epoxy increased thrusted the system into the unstable region of the phase diagram. This continuous quenching process was used to mimic the changes that occurred upon the shift of the phase diagram, towards higher critical solution temperatures, resulting in the mixture moving deeper and deeper into the unstable region. This study provided an analysis o f the evolution o f the concentration profiles upon a continuous change in temperature. The nonlinear C-H equation was used to describe the effects of polymerizationinduced phase separation by SD. The interest in that research was to deteirnine whether reaction-induced phase separation follows the structure formation o f the single quench case by SD. The system was allowed to phase separate

isothermally for a period o f time before an additional quench was made and this was continuous for about four to five successive quenches deeper into the

unstable region (given by /?). This profile refiects the observations made by

Tanaka [1993] and Kwak et a/. [1993] where the secondary structures were observed almost instantly after the second quench. Ohnaga et a i [1994] proposed a diagram o f the constructive and destructive interference that may be occurring between the initial development of the concentration profile with that in the second quench to explain the formation of the concentration profile observed.

They surmised that the secondaiy domains may be due to the location o f the system in the phase diagram (i.e. in the meta-stable region before it proceeds into the unstable region such that nucléation and growth takes place first before spinodal decomposition) or that cross-linking occurs in the coexisting phases during the phase separation process leading to further instability within the coexisting phases (secondary phase separation).

Tao

et al.

[1995] studied two-step phase separation for a mixture o f

polystyi'ene/poly(2-cholorostyrene) having a LCST phase diagram using light scattering and scanning electron microscopy. Theii' images of double phase

separation were similai' to those presented by [Clai'ke et al., 1995] with the intercormected structure from primary phase separation and droplet type morphology fi'om secondary phase separation. The purpose of their study of the two-step process was to give a basis for understanding more complex behaviour under continuous quench conditions that are often found in industrial processing. Like Tanaka [1993] and Kwak et al., [1993], they experimentally observed the effect o f increasing the thermodynamic dr iving force on phase separation with the two-step method. However, a new focus in their paper was on the evolution of the emerging morphology after the second jum p while making the second jum p at the intermediate stages o f phase separation. Something to note is that their system was not strictly binary in that they added di-n-butyl phthalate (DBF) to the mixture to extend the experimental temperature range in studying phase

noticed that the growth of the chaiacteristic length increased for the primaiy interconnected stm cture when secondaiy droplets appeared. This observation is consistent with the initial work of Kwak et al. [1993]. They then altered the

initial quench depth while keeping the second quench temperature constant to observe effects on the characteristic length, and found that droplets observed within the interconnected stmcture decreased when increasing the initial temperature. In terms o f the characteristic length, they saw no obvious changes in the growth rate o f the primaiy stmctures. An empirical scaling law was

developed for deteimining the evolution of the characteristic length by the addition o f a term accounting for the difference in time from the initial tem peratm e jum p to the second jump. But that expression was not derived fiom basic principles [Hashimoto et a i, 2000], and was only good up to the end o f the early stages before it diverged when comparing with the data they obtained.

Yang et al. [1998] looked at a mixture of diallyl phthalate (DAP)/poly (2,6dknethyl-1,4-phynylene ether) (PPE) having an UCST phase diagram. The focus o f their work was on the morphology developed during curing using light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron m icroscopy for polymerization induced phase separation, where by they found secondary phase separation in the final stmcture. They showed that the primary

Chapter 2: Literature R eview
and secondary structure were o f the droplet type, and proposed a possible explanation for this phenomenon. Figure 2.3 shows the evolution o f the

concentration profile for the secondary structure formation they proposed. This development o f the concentration profile is similar to the ones observed by Ohnaga and Inoue [1989] in the one-dimensional numerical results o f double quenching. However, the amount of interference to the initial concentration

profile from the secondary temperature jump was not as dramatic as shown here in the figure. Also, the system under study by Ohnaga and Inoue [1989] was not reaction-induced phase sépar ation.

Up to this point, most of the work done on double phase separation has been based on the formation of secondary stmctures and image analysis. There has been very little work or in-depth quantitative analysis o f the mechanism o f double phase separation in the literature [Hayashi et al., 2000a]. The first in a series o f papers written by Hashimoto et al. [2000; Hayashi et a i, 2000a and 2000b] have recently revisited the two-step phase separation phenomena to further understand, on a quantitative level based on light scattering data, the morphological development o f secondaiy phase separated regions within a polymer blend o f deuterated polybutadiene (DPB), and protonated polyiosprene (HPI) having an initial composition close to the critical composition for the initial quench. The polymers used in this study have very similar properties (i.e., very narrow molecular weight distributions, near ly symmetrical in terms o f density, statistical segment length, monomeric friction coefficient and glass transition temperature).

A number o f concerns were posed in trying to gain a better

understanding o f the mechanism for secondai'y structure formation within an already phase separated regime. In the attempt to answer these questions,

Hashimoto et a l [2000] have been able to fill in the gaps between what has been experimentally observed and how the process can be explained at a fundamental level. Their concerns were: · To determine whether there were scaling laws that could be used as a tool to predict the change from the initial structure (first quench) to the final structure at the second quench.

3 6-

Chapter 2: Literature Review
· If the formation o f secondary stmctures may be limited to a certain conditions (a critical time i.e. the early, intermediate and late stage of development) · To be able to describe, quantitatively, the evolution of the growth o f both primary and secondary structures as described in previous studies · To determine the theories that best describe the double quenching process (i.e. Is the C-H nonlinear equation applicable for double quenching?)

The procedure taken after the first temperature jump was to allow the system to phase separate until the equilibrium compositions of the two phases were reached before the second quench was made. The second quench was still within the

unstable region o f the phase diagram and therefore phase separation would be characterized by SD. From a set of experiments the size of the initial structure was varied before making the second quench and the light scattering profiles described the evolution o f pattern formation for double quenching distinguishing three regimes [Hashimoto et al., 2000]. The three stages aie as follows, first, after the second temperature jump, there was a broad peak (secondary peak) that forms and grows with time. Second, this broad peak increased in intensity with time and third, the peak eventually decreased at longer times but the original peak intensity, from the first quench, continued to grow. The data was then used to develop new scaling laws to describe the spatial and temporal changes that occur in double quenching. An interesting result from the new scaling laws showed that after the second quench, the initial structure was relaxed and transformed into a new

Chapter 2: Literature Review
stm ctuie and grew according to the scaling laws o f a single quench into the unstable legion by SD at the second temperature. The next paper written by

Hayashi et al. [2000a], tackles the other questions regarding the evolution o f the stm cture o f the prim aiy and secondai-y domains by examining the evolution o f the stm cture factor. The same two-step quench process, and the same mixture of and protonated polyiosprene (HPI) was

deuterated polybutadiene (DPB)

investigated. They examined the effect of the initial domain size on the formation of secondai'y stm ctures and found that at early stages of the initial quench where the initial domain size is not too large, secondaiy structures do not occur and the initial structures continued to grow after the second temperature jump. With

larger domain sizes for the initial stmcture, secondaiy stmctures were observed. From their light scattering data used to evaluate the evolution o f the stmcture factor, they found that initial domain size played a major role in the development o f secondary stmctures. Also, they were able to characterize the development

into three stages like in the single quench case [Hayashi et a i, 2000a]. In stage one, the secondary structures formed and grew inside the primaiy stmctures. The grow th o f the secondary stmctures was similar to that of the eai'ly stage in a single quench case at the second temperature jump and was very evident. Also, the peak intensity o f the primary stmctures grew alongside the secondary ones. In stage two, both the primaiy and secondary stmctuies grew together at relative rates to each other and the secondary stmctures are still present in the initial stmctures. Finally, in stage three the secondary stmctures start to disappear and the time evolution o f growth o f the stmctures approach the single quench values in the late

- 38 -

Chapter 2: Literature R eview
stage at the second temperature. The results suggest that the growth o f the secondary structures was affected by the size o f the initial stmctures as was mentioned in then first paper [Hashimoto et a i, 2000]. Evaluation o f the

structure factor then answers the questions they pose on the development of the secondary stm cture within the primaiy stmcture being nonlinear in nature. The final paper was written to investigate the validity o f lineai'ized C-H theory for the early stage SD after the second temperature jump on the development the secondary stmctures [Hayashi et al., 2000b]. For the same mixture studied in

their previous two papers and applying the same methods [Hashimoto et al., 2001; Hayashi et al., 2000a] they found that the linear theoiy for the single quench SD process holds for the eai'ly stages in the formation of the secondary stmctuies at j the second jump. In this work, Hayashi et al. [2000b] also discussed the concept o f confinement effect on the early stages of phase separation by SD noting that it has not been addiessed by Kwak et al. [1993], Tanaka [1993], nor Tao et al. [1995] in theft experimental work of double phase separation. They introduce the concept o f a ft ee-SD process and confmed-SD process [Hayashi et al., '2000b]. They define confmed-SD as the development of secondary stmctures in the primary stmctures where the primai y structure acts as a new medium in which the secondai'y phase sepai ation takes place and ft ee-SD is the typical SD o f a regular single quench process. Another idea that was presented was the concept o f "superposed SD" [Hayashi et a i, 2000b]. This superposed SD is the result of taking the individual composition just before the second temperature jump and quenching them to the second temperature as if they were single quenches. The

-39-

Chapter 2: Literature Review
result of supeiposed SD would then be a combination of the two individual cases o f bee SD to describe the double quenching process of confined SID because in theoiy, the process may be a linear combination of the individual quenches at the early stages o f SD. Early stages of SD on the evolution o f the composition

fluctuations do not affect the chai acteristic wave number o f the dominant mode o f the concentration fluctuations and affect only the values of the diffusion coefficients. They argue that on a qualitative level, these values are reasonable with th en assumptions stated eaidier about the early stages for the confined and bee SD. Comparing confmed-SD with superposed-SD they found major

differences in the values for the diffusion coefficients. The values of the diffusion coefficient in the confmed-SD were roughly half that of the supeiposed-SD process. This leads them to believe that the differences in the diffusion coefficients stems from the idea of the confinement effect that the large domains have on the growth of the small domains. Therefore, from their analysis o f light scattering data for the confmed-SD, free-SD and supeiposed-SD, they conclude that small domains are not spatially affected (the scattering vector remained relatively constant) provided there was enough space for them to be generated. Growth rate o f the composition fluctuations o f the secondary structures was be coupled w ith the growth o f the interface o f the large domains (at a certain characteristic length) and therefore, slowed down compared to its growth rate in a free SD process. Upon analysis using the linear C-H theoiy, they found that the effect o f space confinement in the SD process. This reasoning was used to explain

-40

Chapter 2: Literature Review
the discrepancies in the mutual diffusion coefficient for the confined and the superposed SD process.

An important final note made in the paper by Hayashi et al. [2000b] was the limitations o f the time resolved light scattering apparatus in observing the effects o f using smaller domains sizes immediately before the second-step phase separation. To do this, they proposed the use o f time resolved neutron scatteiing [Hayashi et al., 2000b]. In this respect, modeling and computer simulation would be o f a powerful means of studying the effects of having small domains sizes developed in the early stages of SD under a single quench before a second quench is made and observing the effects on structure development.

Recently, a publication by Henderson and Claike [2004] followed the method presented by Hashimoto et al. [2000] to model double phase separation for polymer blends. They examined a critical mixture and the second temperature jum p was made at the late stages of phase separation by SD. Then model

consisted of the nonlinear C-H equation and the F-H-de Gennes free energy expression. The mobility was assumed to be constant. They examined pattern formation for a critical quench in 2-D, the growth of the structure factor and the effect o f quench depth on the formation of secondary structures. What they observed was similar to the experimental work of Hashimoto [2000; Hayashi et a l, 2000a and 2000b], however, their work was on the early stages o f phase separation by SD showed discrepancies in the calculation of amplification factor and maximum wave number.

Theoretical Background
This section presents the necessai'y theory in describing phase separation o f polym er blends. The nature of phase separation in a two-component system

involves changes in energy, namely, Gibbs free energy. This chapter begins with thermodynamics where the process of phase separation from an initially homogeneous mixture is examined. It involves discussing mixing behaviour and the construction o f the phase diagram using the Flory-Huggins (F-H) theory. Subsequently, the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) theory is presented which is used to describe the dynamics of phase sepaiation by SD. In eaily studies o f

m etal alloys using the C-H theory, the mobility and the coefficient of the energy gradient were assumed to be constant [Langer et al., 1975; Copetti and Elliot, 1990]. In some polymer studies, the mobility was assumed to be constant and the energy gradient coefficient was assumed to be a function of composition [Ohnaga et a i, 1989; Chakrabarti et a i, 1989; Chakrabarti et al., 1990; Brown and Chakrabaiti, 1993a; Matsuoka and Yamamoto, 1995, Henderson and Clarke, 2004]. In other polymer blend studies, the mobility was assumed to be a function o f composition in the form o f M{c) = NDc{\~c) where D is the self-diffusion coefficient, c is composition, and N is the degree o f polymerization o f the

polymer. The energy gradient was also assumed to be a function o f composition [Ariyapadi and Naum an 1991; Kontis and Muthukumai', 1992; Glotzer, 1995; Aksimentiev et al., 2000; Castellano and Glotzer, 1995; Castellano and Corberi, 2000]. Both mobility and the coefficient of the energy gradient are known to be composition dependent for polymer blends. The last section in this chapter will then present the development of the expressions for composition dependent mobility and gradient energy.

3.1

Thermodynamics of Phase Separation in Polymer Blends

The governing equation that describes the thermodynamic stability o f a mixture is the change in Gibbs free energy. Under constant temperature and pressure the change in Gibbs free energy is defined as; ZIC?,, (3.1)

where AG m is the Gibbs free energy of mixing, A/iW is the enthalpy o f mixing, T is the absolute temperature of mixing and ASm is the entropy o f mixing. Stability (i.e. whether or not the system is miscible or immiscible) depends on the value o f and AAm- When AG^ < 0, a homogeneous solution exists. This means that the Gibbs free energy o f the mixture is less than the Gibbs free energy o f the sum o f the pure components. This condition is necessary but not enough to ensure stability o f a system [Van Dijk and Wakker, 1997]. To ensure stability, the sign o f the second derivative of AG^^ with respect to the composition must to be evaluated. For ideal mixtures it is assumed that A//m= 0, therefore, only ASm is

3.1.1 The Flory-Huggins Theory

The F-H theory can be used to describe the fiee energy o f mixing for a polymer m ixture. As mentioned earlier, polymer mixtures are non-ideal and therefore, the enthalpy o f mixing cannot be ignored. The fi'ee energy o f mixing for polymer blends contains two parts, an entropie contribution and an enthalpic contribution. The entropie contribution is associated with the configuration of polymers within the m ixture and the enthalpic contribution is associated with the interactions betw een different segments, in the mixture. The fi ee energy is determined through the assum ption o f an athermal polymer mixture (i.e. AHm = 0 and AS m is not ideal) [Van Dijk and Wakker, 1997]. A lattice model is used to describe the

possible arrangements that can be obtained for binary polymer mixtures [Cowie, 1998]. Since polymer chains are long segments, the number o f airangements

possible is less than that for smaller molecules and therefore, the entropy o f m ixing is much smaller. The lattice model for polymer mixtures is based on

B oltzm ann's law o f entropy. Boltzmann's law is: 0 -2 ) where ks is the Boltzm ann's constant and /3 is the number o f ways that Ni and N 2 segments can be arranged in the lattice [Van Dijk and Wakker, 1997]. After some mathem atical manipulation the change in entropy due to mixing o f two polymers is given by:

3.1.2 The Phase Diagram for Polymer Blends

Polymer blend phase diagrams can be determined experimentally or constructed using the F-H free energy expression. In Figure 3.1, some common phase

diagrams for binary polymer mixtures are shown [Tanaka, 2000]. Figure 3.1 a) has an upper critical solution temperature UCST temperature type phase diagram. The UCST is the highest temperature at which first sign of phase separation can

-45-

Chapter 3: Theoretical Background
be obsei-ved. Figure 3.1 b) shows a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) type phase diagram. This point corresponds to the lowest temperature at which the first sign o f phase separation occurs. Finally, in Figure 3.1 c), the temperature versus composition phase diagram shows a mixture where both the UCST and the LCST exist. Graphically, the relationship between the fi'ee energy versus

composition and temperature versus composition is shown in Figure 3.2. In the free energy phase diagram, as the temperature is decreased from 7i to T/, the free energy changes. Ti is taken as the example to show how the temperature versus com position phase diagram is constructed using the free energy plot. The binodal is also known as the equilibrium curve and is constructed through the con'esponding points o f tangency on the free energy diagram. The condition for equilibrium between the two coexisting phases is when the chemical potential of component / , in one phase (1) is equal to the chemical potential o f component i in the coexisting phase (2). This leads to the condition that the total change in free energy o f component / is zero - -- = ( / r / " - / / / ^ ') = 0 . The tangent line

mixture. For meta-stability, the second derivative of free energy with respect .to composition is greater than zero and if the composition fluctuations are small, the energy barrier will not be crossed and the blend will be restored to its original composition. For instability, the second derivative of free energy with respect to composition is less than zero and small composition fluctuations are enough to create instability. The curvature of the second derivative o f free energy with

respect to composition (change in sign) can then detail the degree of stability, alongside the knowledge of the first derivative of free energy with respect to composition, with concave downwards (local maximum) being unstable and concave upwards (local minimum) can be meta-stable or stable. At the spinodal points, there is no thermodynamic driving force to cause the mixture to phase separate or to restore the blend to its original composition upon small fluctuations. The spinodal then separates the meta-stable from the unstable region.

Cahn [1965] was the first to describe the kinetics of phase separation by SD for metals and glasses and has since been extended to study phase separation in polym er solutions and blends [de Germes, 1980]. The nonlinear C-H equation describes the spinodal process as a series of sinusoidal waves that govern the spatial and temporal evolution of the concentration fluctuations. It was developed from the continuity equation of mass where the diffusional flux is related to the driving force for phase separation (the chemical potential). The continuity equation is given as:

*=-V .J

(3 12)

where c is the composition , and J is the interdiffusional flux of the components. J is related to the gradient in chemical potential by the following expression:

concentration fluctuations in a polymer mixture are related to the change in the total free energy and can be broken down into two parts, a homogenous free energy teim and a term to take into account the increase in free energy due to concentration fluctuations. The total free energy is then given as [Cahn, 1965]: F = ^ ^ f { c ) + K { V c f'] ^ V (3.14)

l = - M ^ ^ V c = -DWc

( 3 .22)

In equation (3.14) the mutual diffusion coefficient is the product of the mobility and the second derivative of the free energy with respect to composition. Rearranging equation (3.22), the total mobility as a function of composition is;

Chapter 3: Theoretical Background

(3-23) ôc^ There are two theories used to describe the mobility o f polymers upon mixing, the slow mode theory and the fast mode theory [Kiamer et a i, 1984]. The slow mode theoiy predicts that mutual diffusion of the binai y polymer blend is limited by the slow er component in the mixture [Kiamer et a i , 1984]. On the other hand, the fast mode theory predicts that the diffbsion rate is limited by the faster component. The expression for mutual diffusion in the slow and fast mode

theories is m ade up o f a thermodynamic teim i// and a kinetic term X [Jilge et a i, 1990;A kcasue/`a/., 1995]; D { c ) = ij/X (3.24)

The thermodynamic factor is associated with the static anangement o f the polym er segments and the kinetic factor is associated with the self-diffusion of the polym er segments [Akcasu et a i, 1995]. The composition dependent total

m obility for a polymer system was introduced by de Gennes [de Gennes, 1980] and as a ratio o f transport properties to that of the driving force for phase separation (chemical potential). The expression is: A=_ M ^ A] + A 2 W here A,- (c) = (3.25)

is the Onsager coefficient o f the individual component

-56

Chapter 3: Theoretical Background
component Onsager coefficient is related to the individual mobility, M , ( c ) , o f the component by:

A ,(c) = Ag7M,(c)

(3.26)

Equation (3.25) can be rewritten in terms o f total mobility to give the slow mode theory [Kramer et al., 1984]: -L = _ L + - L M (3.27)

Where M is the total mobility and M j and M 2 are the individual mobilities o f components 1 and 2 respectively. The individual mobilities of each component are expressed in terms of a self-diffusion coefficient:

In equation (3.27), if it was assumed that component 2 had a larger mobility (£>, «^cDJthan component I, would be very large and therefore, the total

mobility would be controlled by the mobility of component 1 (the slower moving component) For the fast mode theory, the total mobility o f the mixture is written as [Kramer et al., 1984]: A /= M , ( 1 - c)+M2C (3 29)

-57-

Chapter 3: Theoretical Background
Again if it was assumed that the faster component in the mixture was component 2 then would be much larger in value than /V/, and therefore, the total

m obility will be controlled by the faster moving component. Inserting equations (3.28 a) and (3.28 b) into the slow and fast mode theories and rearranging the expression, the total mobility becomes;

M (c ) =
V

(slow mode)

(3.30)

N^D^c (l - c) V+ N.p^cv (I - c) M {c) = k j

(fast mode)

(3.31)

W hether the slow mode theory or the fast mode theory best describes the interdiffusion o f the polymer segments is still a topic o f debate amongst researchers. There have been publications that are in favour of using the slow m ode theory [de Gennes, 1980; Green et a i, 1985; Binder, 1983] while others believe the fast mode theoiy is a better prediction [Kramer et al., 1984; Composte and Kiamer, 1988]. The rest of the derivation for the total mobility will use the slow mode theory following the work of de Gennes [1980] in describing the dynamics o f phase separation in polymer blends as it well describes phase separation by SD [Pincus, 1981; Binder, 198j].

3.2.4 R eptation Theory and the Self-Diffusion Coefficient

T he self-diffusion coefficients measure the rate at which individual components o f the mixture diffuse and are determined experimentally usmg labelmg techniques to identify the components. There are two theories to describe the self-

Chapter 3: Theoretical B ackground
diffusion coefficient, the Rouse theoiy [Rouse, 1953] and the reptation theoiy [de Gennes, 1971]. Both theories describe the self-diffusion coefficient in terms o f physical properties o f the polymer. The Rouse model describes a polymer chain as a spring and bead model where the chains are considered flexible repeating units moving freely in a medium. There exists a resistance force caused by the interaction between the medium and the coil o f the spring called a frictional force and is incorporated into the self-diffusion coefficient of the polymer [Rouse, 1953]. The self-diffusion coefficient using the Rouse model is: (3.32)

Where N is the degree of polymerization and ^ is monomer friction coefficient. The reptation model describes the motion o f a long polymer chain as a snake-like motion traveling through a constrained area [de Gennes, 1971]. The constraints are due to the entangled polymer coils in the mixture (unable to cross over another polymer chain) such that the only motion can be of a sliding or a creeping effect along the contours of the polymer length [de Gennes, 1971]. The self-diffusion coefficient described by the reptation model [Doi and Edwards, 1986] is:

Where a is the step length o f a primitive chain, and b is the bond length. The difference in both theories lies in the dependence o f dependence is and in reptation it is on N, where in Rouse the

simplified by the following relationship between a and 6 [Doi and Edwards, 1986].

(3.35)

There exists a crossover between Rouse to reptation dynamics [de Gennes, 1971; Klein, 1978; Brochaid et al., 1983]. Experimentally, there is a critical polymer length, Nc, where the physical property (viscosity) o f the polymer changes significantly as a function of N. The value of A(. is approximately 300-600 m onom er units [Klein, 1978; Brochard et a i, 1983]. Brochaid et al. [1983] used this critical value in theh development of an expression for the mutual diffusion coefficient for N < (the non-entanglement regime) and for N > Nc (the

entanglement regime). The non-entanglement regime can be well described by the Rouse model and the entanglement regime the reptation model [Klein, 1978]. Therefore, the total mobility for the non-entanglement regime (N < Nc) using the slow mode theoiy is:

In studying phase separation by SD for polymer blends the reptation theory has been used to describe the self-diffusion [de Gennes, 1980; Pincus, 1981].

3.2.5 Concentration-Dependent Gradient Energy

The energy gradient in the nonlinear C-H equation is the contribution to the free energy resulting from concentration fluctuations (non-homogeneous) and is related to the formation of interfaces between the two polymers, xr is assumed to be always greater than zero, de Gennes [1980] proposed that the gradient energy coefficient was made up of both enthalpic and entropie contributions and later discussed in a review paper on phase separation by Nauman and Qiwei [2001]: (3.38) The entropie effect is due to the connectivity of monomer units and therefore is only applicable to polymer systems [Hashimoto e t a l , 1983]. This additional term into the free energy takes into account the changes in energy upon the spatial

(3.40)

Therefore, from equation (3.40) a = 5. Note that the entropie term is a function o f the relative size o f the polymer. The different arrangements o f the polymer

segments in the mixture are limited by the size of the polymer chains and therefore, increase the free energy and opposing phase separation. Therefore, the

separation process due to the development of interfaces to tiy and restore the system to its lowest energy level. Equations (3.39 b) [Lee et al., 1999], (3.39 c) [Ariyapadi and Nauman, 1991] and (3.39 d) [Jones and Richards, 1999] can also be simplified in the following manner. The difference in the coefficients comes fi'om using the random phase approximation (RPA), the Deybe function and placing restrictions on the range where the expression is valid (Equation (3.39 d)) [Jones and Richards, 1999]. Equation (3.39 a) is often used in computer

simulations for studying phase sepaiation by SD as it is assumed that the polymer mixture undergoing phase separation is highly incompatible [Zhang et al., 1995; Chakrabarti et al., 1990; Glotzer, 1995; Matsuoka and Yamamoto, 1995].

Governing Equations Used to Describe Phase Separation by Spinodal Decomposition for a Polymer Blend

The model development is based on the fundamental equations introduced in Chapter 3. The concentration fluctuations in a polymer mixture are related to the change in total free energy in the form [Cahn, 1965]: F = \\^f{c) + K ( V c f ^ ^ V
( 4 . 1)

The total fi-ee energy is broken down into two parts, a homogenous free energy o f mixing term and a term to take into account the increase in free energy due to concentration fluctuations. The homogeneous free energy o f mixing can be

Method of Solution: The Galerkin Finite Element

Method
The Galerkin finite element (GFE) method is a method of weighted residuals. It is a useful technique in solving equations whether they are partial differential equations, ordinal y differential equations or integral equations by approximating it at discrete points [Huebner et a l, 1995]. This technique is advantageous

because it can be used to solve systems o f any geometry and complexity by dividing the system into subunits called elements, and allowing computational approximations to the solution at nodal points that link the elements. The divided solution region is called the element mesh and in the case of a one-dimensional study the mesh is a line and in a two-dimensional study the mesh is a plane. The following development of the general procedure to solving partial differential equations in two-dimensions is based on the developments given in finite element

Consider the boundaries: L (ii) = f { x , y j ) = 0 a < x < b a<y<b (4.22) following equation in two dimensions with the following

In the Galerkin method, the solution to the equation above assumes that u can be represented by an approximation of the form:

(4.23)

Z,(w^) = 0

(4.25)

To do this, the residual is multiplied by a weighting function (equal to the basis functions in the GFE method), set to zero and integrated over the element:

For detailed development of the Hermitian basis functions other sources can be referred to [Chung, 1978]. The Hermitian basis functions take the form:

Program Summary

The program developed for solving the 1-D and 2-D models was based Chan's program [Chan, 1997] for studying phase separation by SD in polymer solutions where the mobility and interfacial parameters were kept constant. In the 1-D

study, 256 elements were used to form the mesh size and in the 2-D model a 20 by 20 element mesh was used. After employing the GFE method and setting up the set o f equations in matrix form, the set of equations were solved using the Newton-Raphson iteration scheme. For time integration, the finite difference method and the Euler predictor coiTector method was used [Chan, 1997]. An

adaptive step size controller was also used to save on computing time [Chan, 1997]. When there is little variation in the function a large time step it taken and when there is more variation small time steps are used.

This section presents the numerical results from the one-dimensional TIPS study w ith a single quench. The focus is in the formation o f phase-separated stimctures and therefore studying the early and beginning of the intermediate stages is sufficient. The model parameters aie listed in Table 5.1. The model is based on a symm etrical blend with degree of polymerization of Ni = N2 = 1000. There are two initial average compositions that will be investigated, a critical quench (c,,* 0.5) and an off-critical quench {C o = 0.6). The study also uses three different values for the dimensionless diffusion coefficient. The order of magnitude for the dim ensionless diffusion coefficient directly reflects the parameters taken from experim ental studies on the properties of polymers [Daould et al., 1975]. Key

features are examined for a critical and an off-critical quench case to ensure that the one-dimensional model exhibits the same known trends for the early to the beginning o f the intermediate stage typical o f phase separation by SD: (i) (ii) The evolution of the concentration fluctuations The evolution o f the dimensionless structure factor

The results presented in this chapter for the critical and off-critical quench case are for a value o f the dimensionless diffusion coefficient D* = 200 000 unless otherwise specified. The results for D* = 500 000 and 800 000 are shown in Appendix B

Note in a 1-D study, it is not possible to determine the type o f structure that is obtained (interconnected or droplet type). The 1-D study can only well describe the characteristics pertaining to the kinetics of SD. Generally, a 1-D model can be used to fully describe the mechanism of phase separation by SD and a 2-D model is used to determine the type of microstructure obtained.

increasing

dimensionless time as they approach the equilibrium values while maintaining constant position. Numerically, the results shown here are also consistent with other 1-D studies conducted for polymer blends [Ohnaga and Inoue, 1989; Takenaka et al., 1995], However, the model and the method of solution differ from the numerical work in this thesis. Figures 5.3 shows the evolution o f the dimensionless spatial concentration profiles for a single off-critical quench with an initial average composition of C o = 0.6 at a dimensionless quench temperature o f Tj = 0.25 and a dimensionless diffusion coefficient o f D = 200 000. These concentration profiles are also consistent with the trends typical o f phase separation by SD for the early to beginning o f the intermediate stages [Hashimoto et al., 1986a]. A comparison between the dimensionless times for the critical and off-critical quench shows that for the critical quench (/ = 3.527 to 0.220 for D = 200 000 to 800 000), phase separation occurs at earlier times than the off-critical case {t* = 4.898 to 0.22878 for D* = 200 000 to 800 000). This can be explained by referring back to the phase diagram in Figure 5.1. The two filled circles

indicate the locations o f the quench at T/* = 0.25 for the critical and off-critical quench case. It is known that the driving force for phase sepai at ion is directly related to the distance o f the temperature within the confines o f the spinodal line [Tao et a l , 1995]. It can be observed that the distance from the spinodal curve at Ti* = 0.25 for the critical case is much farther inward than for the off-critical

-82

Chapter 5 : 1-D TIPS Single Quench
quench case. Recall from Chapter 3 that the location of the spinodal points are at

the inflection points ( ^

= 0 ) in the change in free energy curve.

At these

points, there is no influence on the composition fluctuations to overcome energy barriers or to drive phase separation by SD therefore, there will be a smaller driving force for phase separation for the off-critical quench case since it is located closer to the spinodal curve. This explains the reason for the time

differences in the critical and off-critical quench and was also observed in the a numerical study for polymer solutions [Chan, 1997].

5.3

The Evolution of the Dimensionless Structure Factor

The structure factor is an important parameter that is often used to characterize the shape o f phase-separated domains by SD and relates numerical and experimental studies [Glotzer, 1995]. The numerical data of the computed

composition fluctuations are used to calculate the stmcture factor by taking the fast Fourier transform [Glotzer, 1995]. The relationship between experimental (the scattering intensity ftom light scattering experiments) and numerical work (the structui-e factor) is of the following form [Strobl, 1985; Copetti and Elliot, 1990; Skripov and Skripov, 1979]: <xS{kJ) = I ^ A [ k j y ^ ior k = q (5.2)/

To ensure that the numerical work in this study is in agreement with the known evolution of scattering profiles as related to the structure factor, the dimensionless structure factor was calculated at different dimensionless times, MATLAB was used to calculate the dimensionless structure factor where a small algorithm was written to determine the fast Fourier transform of the sample data at a specific time and the square of the magnitude of this result to determine the value of the structure factor. Figures 5.5 and 5.6 show the evolution of the dimensionless structure

factor as a function of dimensionless wave number, k *, and dimensionless time for the critical quench case and the off-critical quench case with D* = 200 000. It can be observed that the value of the dimensionless structure factor increases

exponentially with time in the eai'ly stages of phase separation bv SD and begins to slow down as it approaches the beginning of the intermediate staites where nonlineai' effects come into play. Also, during the early to the beginning o f the

interm ediate stages, the wave number is constant and this is typical o f what should be observed [Hashimoto, 1993], Therefore, the evolution o f the

dimensionless structure factor (exponential growth and fixed wave number) for the critical quench and the off-critical quench case show the same trends that have been reported both in experiment [Okada and Han, 1986; Wiltzius et al., 1988; Hashimoto et al., 1986a] and numerical work [Chan, 1998; Chakrabarti 1990; Zhang et al., 1995].

Recall that the wave number is related to the

wavelength by k. = -- . From this, the maximum value o f the wavelength (the T ,. dominant wavelength o f the concentration fluctuations) or the characteristic length for the early stages of phase sepaiation by SD can be determined. The characteristic length is a common definition used to express the domain size o f the phase-separated regions by SD, T [Hashimoto, 1993]. It is defined as the

inverse o f the wave number and in dimensionless form the expression is; A- = ^ k. <5-3)

For the critical and o f f critical quench case, it can be observed that as the dimensionless diffusion coefficient increases, the value o f the maximum wave num ber also increases {km --4 to 7 refer to appendix B for D -- 500 000 and 800000) meaning a decrease in the characteristic length (smaller domain size)

5.3.1 The Growth of the Dimensionless Structure Factor in the Early Stages of SD
From experimental observation of the early stages of phase separation by SD in the w ork o f Hashimoto et al. [1983; 1986b], the growth of the scattering intensity is exponential in the early stage and taking the natural log of these values should produce a straight line. Into the later stages of phase separation by SD, the

growth rate slows down and nonlinear effects take place. This was thought to be due to the coarsening o f the mixture [Hashimoto et al., 1986b], For the early

stages from the linear theory, the following relation can be obtained to describe the light scattering data [Hashimoto et al., 1983];

5.4

The Dimensionless Diffusion Coefficient

The extent o f phase separation observed for the critical quench in Figures 5.2, B. 1 and B.2 and for the ofif-critical quench in Figures 5.3, B.4 and B.5 show a gradual increase with increasing dimensionless diffusion coefficient, D . This increase in the amount o f phase separation can be explained in terms of the definition o f the

-92

Chapter 5 : 1-D TIPS Single Quench
dimensionless diffusion coefficient, D*. The dimensionless diffusion coefficient is defined as the ratio of the driving force for phase sepai ation versus the resisting force and is expressed as; n* _ ~ a^v
\ ^ J

TT~T~\~

driving force for phase separation 1 resisting force

(5.6)

The tenn in the numerator comes from the change in the free energy density (the chemical potential) which is the driving force for phase separation (refer back to equation 3.16) and the term in the denominator is attributed to the square gradient energy (the inter facial energy) that acts to minimize the total free energy o f the phase separating mixture by creating interfaces. As the value ofD * (200 000, 500 000, 800 000) increases, the di'iving force for phase separation is larger and therefore, more phase separated regions will develop. The increase in the number of crests and troughs in the concentration profile for the critical quench from Figures 5.2, B.l and B2 and the off-critical quench horn Figures 5.3, B.3 and B.4 show this observation. For instance, in the critical quench case. Figure 5.2 shows three ciests evident at a dimensionless diffusion coefficient of D* = 200 000 and in Figure B. 1 there are five crests at a dimensionless diffusion coefficient of D = 500 000. Also, note that the dimensionless time at which the fust sign o f phase separation occurs decreases for the critical quench case from t* = 3.527 to 0.220 and for the off-critical quench case from t* = 4.898 to 0.22878 with increasing D*. Therefore, by mcreasing the driving force for phase separation, the amount and the rate o f phase separation increases.

Quench Depth

Ftom the theory o f phase separation for the eaily to the beginning o f the interm ediate stages o f phase separation by SD, it is known that as the temperature is deci eased (for the case of a system exhibiting an UCST type phase diagram), the system becomes increasingly unstable due to the increase in the hee energy and therefore more phase separated regions should appeal- [Ohnaga et al, 1989; Izumitani et al, 1990].

In this section, results will be shown for the off-critical quench case at two values o f dimensionless temperature Ti* = 0.25 and T2 * = 0.1 and a dimensionless diffusion coefficient o f £> = 500 000. The trends for the critical quench case are the same and therefore aie not shown. The quench depth can is used to determine how deep a quench is relative to another. It is defined with reference to the

critical tem perature in the following dimensionless form: = (5.7)

For the shallow quench case, at Tj* = 0.25, the value of the quench depth is Tq *= 0.08293 and for the deeper quench, at 0.13293.

= 0.2, the quench depth is 7 ^ / =

Figure B.3 and Figure 5.9 shows the evolution of the concentration

fluctuations for the shallow off-critical quench and the deeper off-critical quench, respectively. By compai ing the number of crests that are present in Figure B.3 and Figure 5.9, it can be observed that there are more phase-separated regions. In the shallower quench, there are four crests and for the deeper quench there are 14 crests. This has been observed in experiment by Izumitiani et al. [1990] for a -94-

Equation 5.10 is used to calculate the change in the dimensionless spatial chemical potential of polymer 1 at different dimensionless times. Figure 5.10 and 5.11 show the plots of the evolution o f the change in the dimensionless spatial chemical potential for a single critical quench and a single off-critical quench at D* = 200 000. The discussion is divided into two aspects, one being the

discussion o f evolution of the spatial chemical potential at a fixed D and the other in discussing how the increase in D affects the change in the chemical potential.

Figure B. 14 for the critical quench case {D = 800 000) will be used as an example for the discussion of the change in the dimensionless spatial chemical potential of polymer 1. The same general trends are observed for the off-critical quench case at the same value of D*. From the profiles in Figure 5.10, B .l3 and B.14, it can be observed that there are regions where A/J\ increases with

increasing dimensionless time to reach a local maximum and regions where A//i* decreases with increasing dimensionless time to reach a local minimum. This can be explained by combining the spatial chemical potential with the spatial concentration profile at a given dimensionless time. In Figure 5.12, a combined plot is shown for a dimensionless time of f = 0.2733, which corresponds to the last profile in Figure B.2 of the dimensionless spatial concentration profile and the dimensionless spatial chemical potential. fluctuations approach the upper In Figure 5.12, as the composition value, the change in the In

Going back to Figures 5.10, B. 13 and B. 14, the effect o f increasing the value of the dimensionless diffusion coefficient on the evolution o f the change in the dimensionless spatial chemical potential for a single critical quench and a single off-critical quench can be observed. Notice as D* increases from 200 000 to800 000, the rate of change in the dimensionless chemical potential also increases. At D = 200 000 to 500 000, for the critical quench, the evolution of the dimensionless spatial chemical potentials reach the local maxim um and local minimum values and approach equilibrium, A//, = 0, at times o f / = 4.57 and t* = 0.6946 respectively. At D* = 800 000, towards the end o f the profile, the local maximum areas start to decrease towards lower values o f A//, and similarly, the local minimum values increase towaids zero at a much faster rate ( / = 0.2733). Therefore, the increase of D* can be interpreted as

Recall that for instability, the second derivative o f free energy w ith respect to composition must be less than zero and small composition fluctuations are enough to create instability. The cui'vature o f the second derivative o f free energy with respect to composition (change in sign) details the degree o f stability, alongside the knowledge of the first derivative o f free energy with respect to composition, with concave downwards (local maximum) being unstable and concave upwards (local minimum) can be meta stable or stable. Figures 5.13 and 5.14 show the evolution of the second

derivative o f the free energy with respect to composition spatially. The critical and off-critical quench are at Ti = 0.25 with D = 200 000, respectively. From

the plots for the critical and off-critical quench case for the change in the second derivative with respect to composition, it can be observed that the steepness in the rate o f change increases with time and with increasing D* (see Figures B .l7 to B.20 in Appendix B). This indicates an increase in the instability with time as the system phase separates [Hashimoto et al., 1983]. The values at which second derivative o f free energy with respect to composition is zero, F = 0 , reflect the

points o f inflection in the free energy curve at the positions where the curvature changes sign and also at the ciitical point (Chapter 3). Therefore, the

observations o f the profiles for the second derivative with respect to composition

match the thermodynamic in describing instability o f phase separating mixtures [Van Dijk and Wakker, 1997].

Also refening back to the explanation given for the time discrepancy for the occurrence o f phase separation by SD for the critical and off-critical quench, it can be observed that this explanation is valid. By comparing the plots o f the second derivative of free energy with respect to composition for the case where D - 200 000, it can be observed that the rate of change in the free energy is much faster for the critical quench than for the off-critical quench case. This indicates higher instability for the critical quench case.

Results and Discussion: 1-D TIPS Double Quench
This chapter presents the 1-D numerical results o f phase sepaiation by double quenching (within the unstable region o f the phase diagram) o f a polymer mixture to observe w hether secondary phase separated regions are produced inside the already phase separating regions from the initial quench. Double quenching

involves a tw o-step process whereby the initial quench is allowed to phase separate for a certain period of time before the next quench takes place. In

experim ental work, the second quench has been made at the intermediate stages [Tanaka, 1993; Tao et a i, 1995] and the late stages [Tanaka, 1993; Tao et al., 1995; Hashimoto et al., 2000] of phase separation after the first quench. In the m ethod used by Hashimoto et al. the second quench was restricted to the unstable region such that the blend still phase separated by SD [Hashimoto et al., 2000]. In num erical studies Ohnaga et al. [1989], made the second quench at different specifications. There are three distinct time periods they quenched at, the eai ly stages o f phase separation by SD, when the concentration fluctuations were welldeveloped and when the concentration fluctuations reached their respective equilibrium values [Ohnaga et al., 1994]. Henderson and Clarke [2004] made

Chapter 6 : 1-D TIPS Double Quench
their second jump at the late stage of phase separation by SD following the woik of Hashimoto et al. very closely [2000]. In this study, the second Jump is made at the beginning of the intermediate stages and the technique to determine the time for the temperature jump is based on the results presented by Hashimoto [1986b] in their experimental work on the different stages o f phase separation by SD. The second quench will still remain in the unstable region so that phase separation is still occurring by SD. The pai'ameters used in this section aie summarized in Table 6.1.

The reason that the quench depth for the second jump is roughly the same in T anaka's w ork is because he examined the effect of making the initial quench depth larger (i.e. a deeper initial quench). The values used in this study are com parable to the experimental values. In this study, for the shallow quench from an initial quench temperature of Ti = 0.25 to the second quench at T2 --0.2,

the quench depth for the initial temperature jum p is 7^^ =0.08295 and at the second quench Tq =0.13295. For the deeper quench to T 2 --0.1 the quench

Chapter 6 : 1-D TIPS Double Quench
The method used for double phase separation was shown in Figuie 1.6. The

double quenching process takes place within the unstable region of the phase diagram so as to ensure that the system is still phase separating by SD. The initial quench is made and the system is allowed to phase separate for a certain period o f time, t,\ before the second quench. The time t* is the dimensionless transition time which corresponds the transition from the early to the beginning of the intermediate stages of phase separation. In the literature, the criterion for the

second quench is based on the stage of SD (i.e. early, intermediate and late stage) [Tanaka, 1993; Tao et a i, 1995; Hashimoto et al., 2000].

The overall direction of the numerical work presented in this section will examine the following points to provide a better understanding of the mechanism behind double phase separation by SD: (i) Does the evolution of the concentration fluctuations follow the same trends that are observed for a single quench? (ii) How is the stiaicture factor affected by the double quench and how can it be used to describe the appearance of secondary stmctures? (iii) How does the di'iving force (increase in the dimensionless diffusion coefficient D ) affect the foi'mation of secondary structures? (iv) How does quench depth affect the formation of secondary structures (shallow and deeper quench)? (v) Are there any significant differences that appear between a critical and an off-critical quench in terms o f growth dynamics for secondary

phase separation?

109-

Chapter 6: 1-D TIPS Double Quench
(vi) At what point after the second temperature jump do the secondary structures start to form? (vii) How does the growth of the primary and secondary stmctures evolve during the second temperature jump? (viii) Does the secondary phase separation follow the linear C-H theory in the early stages o f phase separation? The interest o f this thesis still lies in the formation o f the phase-separated structures and therefore only the eaily to the intermediate stages will be examined. The results presented in this chapter for the critical and off-critical

quench case are for a value o f the dimensionless diffusion coefficient D* = 200 000 unless otherwise specified. The results for D* = 500 000 and 800 000 aie show n in Appendix C.

6.1

Dimensionless Transition Time (tt ) for the Second Quench

Before the second quench is applied, it is necessaiy to use a consistent method for determining at what point a second temperature jump should be applied in all the simulations. From the dimensionless spatial concentration profiles, the

com position fluctuations represented the early to intermediate stages o f phase separation by SD. The transition point from the early to the intermediate stages can be determ ined through the evolution o f the dimensionless structure factor at the m axim um w ave number, k,,,, with time. In the work by the Hashimoto et al. [1986b] the growth o f the scattering intensity is exponential in the early stage and

110-

Chapter 6 : 1-D TIPS D ouble Quench
taking the natural log of these values should produce a straight line. Into the later stages of phase separation by SD, the growth rate slows down where nonlinear effects take place. This was thought to be due to the coarsening o f the mixture [Hashimoto e/ cil., 1986b]. The dimensionless transition time, t t , is defined as the time at which phase separation moves away from the early stage dynamics and enters into the beginning of the intermediate stages. How this time is determined is shown in Figure 6.1 for the critical quench case.

The dimensionless transition time is 4.720. At the early stages of phase separation by SD the initial increase is linear and gradually slows down into the beginning o f the intermediate stage where coarsening occurs. The transition point occurs where the two tangent lines intersect.

From the plot o f the maximum values ot the dimensionless structure factor at given dimensionless times for the single quench, the dimensionless transition time can be obtained by making two tangent lines where the change in the growth rate is obvious. In Figure 6.1, the two tangent lines aie drawn and the point of

intersection is where the transition time is located. Figuie 6.1 is an actual plot for the critical quench case at c,,* = 0.5, D = 200 000 and 7]' = 0.25. The values correspond to the plot of the structure factor shown in Chapter 5 (Figure 5.3.). Since one o f the interests in this section is to determine how driving force affects the form ation o f secondary stmctures, a summaiy of the transitions times at each given condition to be tested is summarized in Table 6.2.

From Table 6.2, the trend observed with the increase in the dimensionless diffusion coefficient is a decrease in the dimensionless transition time. This

should be expected since phase separation occurs at a much faster rate with

-112 -

Chapter 6 : 1-D TIPS Double Quench
increasint; D and therefore, should reach the beginning of the intermediate stage much faster.

The plots to determine the dimensionless transition tune for all other cases will not be shown since the evolution of the maximum value of the dimensionless structure factor with dimensionless time show the same general trend.

There is now a consistent method of determining when the second temperature jump should take place and in the analysis, the jump will be made at the transition time.

Dimensionless 1-D Spatial Concentration Profiles

Figure 6.2 shows the evolution of the dimensionless spatial concentration profile (for an initial critical) quench after the second temperature jump. phase separation temperature is T2 The initial

Ti = 0.25 and the second temperature jum p is

= 0.2 at the transition time. The transition times is t* = 4.72 for D* = 200

000. For each case (also refen ing also to Figures C. 1 and C.2 in appendix C), after the second temperature jump, there is no evidence of double phase separation. What is observed in the evolution of the spatial concentration profiles is a continuous growth of the already growing initial profiles presented in Figures 5.2, B. 1 and B.2 for D = 200 000 to 800 000. Hashimoto et al. [2000; Hayashi et al., 2000a] have observed this continuous growth in their experimental work when investigating the effect of initial domain size on secondary phase separation. Numerically, Henderson and Clarke [2004] have also observed this in theft 2-D

Chapter 6: 1-D TIPS Double Quench
study on double quenching in the late stages of phase separation by SD at a shallowei quench depth. After the second teinperatiue jump, there is a lag time that exists before a significant increase is observed in the growth of the concentration profiles approaching the new upper (Cj, =0.9695) and lower (C[ = 0 .0 3 0 4 9 ) equilibrium composition values at Tj * = 0.2. This lag time

appears because the mixture, upon subjection to a change in conditions, requires tim e to adjust to the new environment and therefore, experiences a lag or a transition period before reaching the new state. For the initial critical quench

case, the lag times decrease ftom 0.014 to 0.0006 as D* increases. The decrease in the lag time as D* increases is expected since D* increases the rate of phase separation.

Figure 6.3 shows the evolution of the dimensionless spatial concentration profiles (for an initial off-critical quench) after the second temperature jump. Again the initial tem perature jump is at a temperature of Ti = 0.25 and the second tem perature jum p is Tj* = 0.2 at the transition times. The transition time in this case for D* = 200 000 is t* = 5.52. The observations made for the critical quench case can also be applied to the off-critical quench case in that the growth o f the concentration fluctuations ftom the initial quench are amplified by the second tem perature jum p with no sign of double phase separation present. However,

there is a slight difference in the concentration profile at D --500 000 and 800 000 (See Figures C.3 and C.4 in Appendix C). In Figures C.3 and C.4 there is a slight destructive interference that can be observed in peak 3

sufficient to cause the mixture to reach a new instability as it appears to restore itself to match the evolution o f the other peaks in the profile. A lag time also exists for the off-ci itical quench case after the second quench before a significant grow th o f the concentration fluctuations is obseiwed. The lag times decrease fi'om 0.041 to 0.0063 as D increases.

Figui'e 6.4 shows the evolution o f the dimensionless spatial concentration profiles (for the initial critical quench) after the second temperature jump at a deeper quench depth o f 72 = 0 .1 . The second quench is made at the same transition

times shown in Table 6.2. The initial temperature was kept constant at T * = 0.25 to be consistent with the shallower quench to obseiwe the effect of making a deeper second quench. The concentration profiles in this case look different fi'om the single quench and the shallower quench at 7) = 0.2. In Figure 6.4, at i = 4.748, there aie noticeable obstructions in the peaks and troughs o f the concentration profile. The obstmctions gradually increase with time as the

prim ary peaks approach the new equilibrium values at the second temperature and they decrease at the troughs as the lower equilibrium values are approached. These profiles are similar to the ones generated by Ohnaga et al. [1994], in their investigation o f reaction induced phase separation (see Chapter 2 foi details). A lag tim e exists after the second quench before the first sign of double phase separation is observed. The lag times are 0.02, 0.0041 and 0.0011 and decreases w ith increasing D .

This is attributed to the location of the compositions in the phase diagram before the second quench is made and will be discussed later on.

The lag tim es are larger for the initial off-critical quench than for the critical quench. This observation made for the single quench case and was shown to be dependent on the location o f the quench as compared to the spinodal curve.

The Evolution of the Dimensionless Structure Factor After the Second Temperature Jump

This section is split into two parts to describe the observations of the evolution o f the dimensionless structure factor after the second quench to Ti -- 0.2 and Ti = 0.1 for the initial critical and initial off-critical quench case. Analysis o f the

growth rates o f the primary and secondai y peaks (if they form) will be discussed in a later section. Here, the focus is on physical obseivations and relating what is observed here to the observations made for the evolution of the dimensionless spatial concentration profiles. The dimensionless structure factor is calculated in the same way as described m Chapter 5 for the single quench case. The evolution o f the dimensionless structure factor for each case is shown right after the second quench is made at the specified dimensionless transition times in Table 6.2. Unfortunately, it was not possible to examine the entfte process of the growth and decay o f the secondary stmctures (when they occurred), which has been done experimentally, due to numerical problems encountered as the mixture reached the equilibrium compositions at Ti*. Refening to Chapter 4, in the 1-D model, as

To relate the numerical results to experimental results, the numerical work should reflect the same evolution in pattern formation detailed in the structure factor as in the work of Hashimoto et al.

observation from the light scattering data was a result o f the formation o f secondary domains. The structure factor from the numerical work should also

show the emergence and growth of a broad peak. Henderson and Clarke [2004] have observed the appearance and growth of a second broad peak in the evolution o f the stm cture factor after a second quench at the late stages of phase separation by SD in their numerical study. This is the basis of compai ison for the numerical w ork presented in the next two sections.

Figure 6.6 shows the evolution of the dimensioriless structure factor after the second quench to T2 *= 0.2 from the initial critical quench at T\ = 0.25 for D 200 000. Recall from the evolution of the concentration profiles for the initial

critical quench, (Figures 6.2), after the second quench, the concentration profiles w ere am plified from the initial single quench profiles. There was no sign o f

double phase separation present and therefore, the growth of the structure factor should also show an increase in the intensity of the primary peak but no occurrence o f a secondary peak forming. This result is in accordance to the

definition o f the stiiicture factor (Chapter 5) and is observed in the evolution of the dim ensionless structure factor for the initial critical quench case at all values o f D* investigated.

o f a smaller domain size before making the second temperature jump [Hayashi et a i, 2000a], However, the difference in their work and the work presented here is that the dependent variable is the value o f the second temperature Jump that takes place and not the different domain sizes. Numerically, Henderson and Clarke [2004] also observed the same continuous growth for a shallow quench following Hashimoto's work. The reason that there is no occuirence of a second peak is because the quench depth at T2 = 0.2 was not significant enough to cause the mixture to destabilize in a secondary sense. This will be explained through the investigation o f the change in the chemical potential and the second derivative o f the free energy with respect to composition in a later section. A comparison o f the structure factor presented here and for the single quench at Ti = 0.25 show the same values for for each case, indicating that there is no change in the

maximum value o f the wave number which encompasses the dominant mode of the composition fluctuations, for the primary structures, in the early period o f the second quench. The second quench does not have an effect on the maximum wave number o f the primary structure. Just the intensity o f the phase separation process in the early period after the second quench. This is consistent with the work by Hayashi et al. [2000a] and Henderson and Claike [2004]. In terms o f the relative size of the phase-separated regions after the second quench, the information o f constant k ,,,ax signifies that the primary structure does not change in size in the early period. Recall the relationship between k ,,,ax and

dimensionless characteristic length which measures the relative size o f the phaseseparated domains, À =-- . This observation is consistent with the

Furthermore, the growth of the dimensionless structuie factor with tim e looks the same as for a single quench case in the early stages of SD. A fter the second quench, the growth of the dimensionless structure factor

continues as if in the early stages of SD and proceeds to take the same course as a single quench into the intermediate stages (composition reaching the upper and lower equilibrium values). Hashimoto et al. [2000] also confirmed this

experim entally for the case where no broad secondary peak was observed and only the prim ary peak continued to grow. Table 6.3 summarizes the values for the characteristic length for the critical quench at a second temperature jum p o f 72* = 0.2.

The growth rate o f the primary and secondary peaks is consistently increasing with time. How they grow relative to each other will be explored in a later section. Note that the appearance o f a secondary peak was not sufficient enough to cause the mixture to develop secondary structures.

The relative size o f the prim ary phase-separated regions after the second quench does not change in size in the early period. The characteristic lengths of the primary and secondary peaks after a second quench to T =0.2 for initial off-critical case are summarized below in Table 6.3.

In summary, the shallower second quench does not show secondary phase separation in the initial critical or off-critical quench case. There is only an am plification o f the dimensionless stmcture factor. The maximum wave number rem ains constant with the same value as the initial quench case in the early period after the second quench.

These observations aie in agreement with the e\olution of the dimensionless structuie factoi. Theie are obvious secondary peaks that form right after the

second quench at T2 --0.1. In the profile, both the primary and the secondary peak grow with time. This reflects in the growth of the concentration fluctuations w ith tim e as the primary peaks and troughs start to approach the upper and lower equilibrium values and the secondary peaks and troughs start to increase in value as w ell at T2 = 0 .1 . Hayashi et al. [2000a] and Henderson and Claike [2004]

have observed the same effects to the growth of the stmcture factor when secondary structures form. Note that the intensity of the primary peak decreases with increasing D when comparing Figure 6.8 to Figure C. 13 and C.14. This m ay be due to the fact that the formation and the increase in growth rate o f the secondary peaks is affecting the growth of the primary peaks with time as it approaches the new equilibrium values at T2 = 0 .1 . Also, the value o f the

m axim um wave number for the primary peak does not shift when the quench depth is lowered. There is only an increase in the intensity o f the primary peak and the appearance and growth of a secondary peak. The interfer ences observed in the dimensionless spatial concentration profiles where secondary phase separation is observed can be explained by evaluating the dimensionless characteristic length, T* = -- ;-- , which is equal to the wavelength o f the

dom inant wave in SD. As

gets larger (smaller), À* gets smaller (larger) and

therefore, th e result o f adding the two wavelengths together from the initial quench and the second quench will cause the interferences in the concentration profiles. This explanation was also given by Ohnaga et al. [1989] and Yang et

concentration profiles in Figures 6.5 shows an increasing amount of constructive and destructive interferences for the initial off-critical quench case. These

interferences increase as D* increases (see Figures C.7 and C.8 in Appendix C).

Chapter 6: 1-D TIPS Double Quench
In the evolution o f the dimensionless structure factor, this is rcllected in the fotm ation o f secondary peaks which can be observed to increase in intensity as D* increases (see Figures C. 15 and C. 16). Comparing back to the case where the second quench was to Ti = 0.2, the intensity o f the secondary peak is higher here for all three plots. This can be explained by comparing the location o f the quench w ith respect to the spinodal at Ti* = 0.2 as opposed to T2 * = 0 .1 and will be exam ined in the next section on quench depth and double phase separation. The value o f the maximum wave number for the off-critical initial quench and for the second quench does not change for the primary peak in the structure factor plots even w ith a deeper quench. The characteristic lengths o f the primary and

secondary structures after a second quench to 72 =0.1 for the off-critical case are sum m arized in Table 6.4. The characteristic lengths also decrease with increasing D* as in the critical quench case.

Overall, the same trends hold for the initial critical and off-critical quench case in the evolution o f the dimensionless structure factor after the second deeper quench. The deeper second quench shows secondary phase separation with the formation and grow th o f a secondary peak. The primary peak also grows after the second quench in intensity but the maximum wave number remains constant in the early period after the second temperature jump.

Quench Depth and Secondary Phase Separation

The dim ensionless spatial concentration profiles for the shallower and deeper second quench showed a difference in the evolution of phase separation. At the second jum p o f T% = 0.2, the evolution of the spatial concentration profiles were am plified fiom the original quench atT j = 0,25, eventually approaching the new equilibrium values at the second temperature. At the second jum p o f Tz* = 0.1, the evolution o f the spatial concentration profiles showed the formation o f troughs (crests) within the crests (troughs) of the original phase separating profile. This change in the concentration profile can be attributed to the formation o f the secondary phase separated regions. Also, for the initial off-critical quench, after the second jum p to Ti* = 0.1, the obstructions were more evident in the peaks o f the com position fluctuations rather than at the troughs. To examine why these differences occur in the dynamics of phase separation between the two quench depths requires examining the phase diagram. 7% * = 0 .1 3 2 9 5 ^j for the shallower quench and J The quench depths are =0.2330 for the deeper

quench. Figure 6.10 shows the phase diagram for the symmetrical blend studied showing the specific regions of interest for the two quench depths at the critical and the off-critical quench case using the case where D = 500 000 to explain the observations (see Figure B. 1 and Figure B.3 in Appendix B). The same trends hold for the other values o f D . This provides information about the mechanism o f phase separation. Tanaka [1993] proposed similar mechanisms where by the

The filled circles and squares then represent the position o f the initial composition for the second quench within the phase diagram for each temperature jump ( T / = 0.2 and T2 * = 0.1). From the phase diagram, tw o distinct observations can be made. First, the locations o f the com positions for the critical and the off-critical quench at the transition times are slightly different. For the critical quench, the two phase-separated compositions are equidistant fi'om the initial value of 0.5 and are located at approximately the same locations on opposite ends close to the spinodal line. For the off-critical

quench case, the two phase-separated compositions are shifted in that one is still located within the spinodal while the other is located beyond the spinodal into the m eta-stable region. The second observation is the new location o f the

com position in the phase diagram after the jum p to the second temperature in relation to the position o f the spinodal curve (filled circles and squares). For the shallow er second quench {Tg =0.13295), the location o f the initial starting

point at F2 = 0.2 is much closer to the spinodal curve for both the critical and the off-critical quench case than compaied to the quench at r 2 = 0 .1 . Recall from Chapter 3 that the location o f the spinodal points are at the inflection points ( .^ - ^ = 0 ) in the change in free energy curve. dc^ At these points, there is no

influence on the composition fluctuations to over come energy barriers or to drive

-134-

Chapter 6: 1-D TIPS Double Quench
phase separation by SD. These two observations can be used to explain

differences in the interferences in the spatial concentration profiles for the initial off-critical quench case, at a second temperature jump of 7' 2 = 0 .1 , where the peak positions have more obstmctions than at the trough positions. Because there is this difference in the locations of the composition for the second quench, the instability at each composition is different and therefore, the difference in the intensity o f the obstmctions obsemed. In terms of the two quench depths, it is known that the driving force for phase separation is directly related to the distance of the temperature within the confines of the spinodal curve [Tao et a l, 1995]. For the second quench made not too fai' horn the spinodal curve at T2 = 0.2 there will be a smaller diiving force for phase separation. A deeper quench to Tj =0.1 has a larger driving force (further inwai'd into the unstable region) where a new instability is observed and double phase separation occurs. Therefore, the deeper the quench depth and the further inward it is into the unstable region, the more likely a new instability will occur and cause double phase sepaiation. Perhaps there is a critical quench depth that must be attained before a new instability will form and cause double phase separation. To investigate this, more simulations will have to be performed and is beyond the scope of this thesis.

In Figure 6.11 and Figure 6.12, after the second

tem perature jum p, the same trends aie observed. The only difference is the rate at w hich the blend approaches stability because o f the difference in the values o f D* (see Figures C.17 and C.20 in Appendix C). The profiles look the same as the ones observed for a single quench. However, the rate of change in the chemical potential is m uch faster than in the single quench case because o f the increased quench depth. There are regions where A//i* increases with increasing

dim ensionless tim e to a local maximum and regions where A//i* decreases with increasing dimensionless time to a local minimum. As the composition

fluctuations approach the new upper and lower equilibrium values after the second quench, the change in the dimensionless chemical potential plateaus before it starts to move towards equilibrium. At the local minimum positions,

when the blend is stabilizing and at the limit when c approaches 1 (rich in polym er 1), A//,*= 0, meaning the chemical potential o f polymer 1 in the mixture, /j*m!x, equals the value o f the pure component, /i, pure. At the positions o f

condition for equilibrium where the change in the chemical potential of the coexisting phases becomes equal [Van Dijk and Wakker, 1997].

Figures 6.13 and Figure 6.14 show the evolution of the dimensionless spatial chemical potential after the second deeper quench to Tj = 0.1 (at the transition times corresponding to D* = 200 000) for the initial critical and initial off-critical quench case, respectively. For Z) = 500 000 and 800 000 refer to Figures C.21 to C.24. The profiles after the second temperature jump show the same trends but are slightly different than the shallower second quench case. A//, shows a

plateau after the second quench and flattens out at the local maxima and minima. The flattening of the local maxima and minima can be attributed to the adjusting of the blend to the change in quench conditions. The introduction of the smaller obstructions that are occuiaing within the peaks and troughs of the concentration profiles are new instabilities and create a small change in the chemical potential around the local maxima and minima, hence, the flattening at these areas. If

allowed to proceed further, until the secondary phase separation disappears (merging with the primary stmctures), the change in the dimensionless spatial chemical potential should follow the same trend as observed for the shallower second quench case. As the secondary phase sepai ation occurs, the primary peaks and troughs approach the new equilibrium values and the chemical

Figures 6.17 and Figures 6.18 show the evolution of the second derivative o f the free energy with respect to composition spatially after the second deeper quench to F2 * = 0.1 form the initial critical and off-critical quench, respectively. For the deeper quench, the profiles show the same trend for the second derivative o f the fi-ee energy with respect to composition for the initial critical and initial offcritical quench case. The second derivative of free energy with respect to

composition in this case looks much different than the plots for the shallower quench case. Notice that shortly after the second deeper jump there is a dip in the local maximums and gradually grows. In the local minimums, shortly after the second jump, the emergence and growth of a peak occurs and further divides into a double well shape. The foimation of this new double well within the already existing double well becomes more defrned as D is increased (see Figures C.29 to C.32). This new double well can account for the new instability that occurs when secondary phase separated regions form. The steepness of the curve after the second temperature jump increases (increasing the thermo dynamic driving force) in both double well-shaped instabilities. This reflects in the shorter time periods taken for the primaiy composition fluctuations from h * = 0.25 to reach the new equilibrium values at T2 =0.1 and for the growing of the new secondary structures. This additional increase in the free energy relating to distance

Growth of Primary Structures After the Second Temperature Jump to T 2 * = 0.2

Earlier on in the discussion o f the shallower quench from h * = 0.25 to T2 * = 0.2, the dim ensionless structure factor from the original quench grew with time and at the same constant wave number as at = 0.25. How the second quench affected

the grow th rate o f the primaiy and the secondary structures (if formed) was not discussed. In this section the analysis will be on the affect of the second quench on the growth rates o f the maximum values of the primary and secondary structure factors (peak values) formed during phase sepaiation by SD. The

grow th rate o f the maximum value of the structure factor after the second quench is plotted against a reduced time, 1986a; Chan, 1998]: r; =4 (6.1) , which is defined as [Hashimoto et al.,

The reduced tim e is used so that a general analysis can be made over all the different transition times used from Table 6.2. The maximum values o f the

dim ensionless structure factors remain unchanged. Figure 6.19 shows the growth o f the m axim um value o f the dimensionless structure factor with dimensionless reduced tim e after the second shallower quench for the initial critical quench case.

Chapter 6 : 1-D TIPS Double Quench
The values plotted are taken right after the second quench is made and there are three regions that can be identified for the growth of the primary structure. In the stage 1, right after the second quench, there is a steady increase in the growth rate, meaning that the primary stiuctui'es are fuither separating as the new conditions are imposed, Tj* ^ 0.2. Stage I can also be considered the early stages of SD at the primary stmcture is slowing down and there is a slight dip in the growth rate before it starts to increase again into stage III. The growth rate is nonlinear and can be attributed to the change in the composition fluctuations towards the new equilibrium values at Tj* ^ 0.2. In this stage, the blend is adjusting to the new conditions while still phase separating. Finally, in stage III the growth rate

increases again and plateaus as the blend has reached the new equilibrium values at the new conditions. The evolution of the growth of the dimensionless structure factor is very similar to the plot for the single critical quench case shown in Figure 6.1 where the dimensionless transition time was determined. The

difference in the profiles lies in stage II where the composition starts to adjust to the new conditions o f the second quench before further separating into their respective phases. The late stages of phase separation was not examined for the single quench case because the interest was in forming the phase separated morphology and not to examine the coarsening dynamics. Overall, the three

stages in the growth rate of the maximum value of the dimensionless structure factor after the second quench takes roughly the same form as a single quench case when there is no appearance of the secondary peak and only an amplification o f the primary peak from the initial critical quench. As D increase, the same

trends as those observed (see Figures C 33 and C.34). The only difference being the steepness o f the growth rate as the value of D* increases.

Figure 6.20 shows the growth of the dimensionless structure factor with dim ensionless reduced time after the second shallower quench for the initial offcritical quench case. The values plotted are taken right after the second quench is made and as in the case of the initial critical quench, there are three regions that can be identified for the growth of the primary structure. For D = 500 000 and 80 000, Figures C 35 and C.36 in Appendix C, there is the emergence o f secondary peaks (refer back to Figures C .ll and C.12) in the growth o f the m axim um value o f the dimensionless structure factor that have a very small im pact on the evolution of the original composition fluctuations as discussed previously in section 6.2. The trends in Figure 6.20 will be discussed separately

150-

Chapter 6 : 1-D TIPS Double Quench
from those in Figures C.35 and C.36. In Figure 6.20, the three different growth regions are similar to those observed for the initial critical quench case. In the stage I, right after the second quench, there is a steady increase in the growth rate and the primary structures are further separating as the new conditions are imposed, T2 * = 0.2. In stage II, the growth of the primary structure is slowing down and again there is a slight dip in the growth rate before it starts to pick up again into stage III. The nonlinear growth rate is a result of the adjustments in the composition fluctuations from the initial quench condition at Fi = 0.25 towards the new equilibrium values at T2 * = 0.2, Finally, in stage III the growth rate

increases again and staits to level off as the blend reaches the new equilibrium compositions. In Figures C.35 and C.36 there are two graphs plotted, one for the growth of the primary peak (top graph) and one for the secondary peak observed in the plot of the dimensionless stmcture factor (bottom). Both are plotted against reduced times so that a compai ison can be made between the growth rates of the two peaks simultaneously. As D increases, the growth of the secondary peak was more obvious and its effect on the growth rate o f the primary stmcture should have a larger impact. This can be observed when comparing Figures C.35 and C.36 where D* increases from 500 000 to 800 000 respectively. In Figure C.35, the introduction and the growth of the secondary peak does not seem to have much impact on the growth of the primary peak as can be observed from the profile of the primary peak growth rate. The growth of the primary peak seems to be identical to the growth of the dimensionless stmcture factor for a single quench case. There are still three distinct regions that can be observed for both the

-151

Chapter 6: 1-D TIPS Double Quench
piim aiy and secondary peak growth. Initially in stage 1, the growth of both

piim aiy and secondary peak increases steadily and the blend is still phase separating under the new conditions. In stage II, the growth of the primary peak slows down as the composition fluctuations are approaching the new equilibrium values and the secondary peak still continues to grow but at a slower rate. The grow th o f the primary peak is dominating and therefore, the growth of the secondary peak has little effect on the composition fluctuations. In stage III, the prim ary peak plateaus in growth rate and the secondary peak continues to grow steadily. To determine the full evolution of the secondary peak growth, the late stages need to be evaluated and does not fall into the scope o f this thesis. In

Figure C.36, the effect o f the growth of the secondary peak is more obvious. Again, the profile has been broken down into tbree regions. The top graph represents the growth o f the dimensionless stmcture factor of the primary peak and the bottom graph for the growth of the secondary peak at the same reduced times. In stage I, there is only a short period of steady increase in growth o f both the prim ary and secondary peaks. This is because as D is increased, the rate of phase separation increases and therefore, the blend is quick to respond to the change o f conditions to the new temperature. In stage II, there is a steeper

increase in the growth rate for both the primary and secondary peaks as the blend approaches the new equilibrium values at Tj . However, the growth o f the

secondary peak has only a slight effect on the growth o f the primary peak and this is reflected in the dimensionless spatial concentration profiles shown in section 6.2. In stage III, the growth of the primary peak levels off while the secondary

152-

Chapter 6 : 1-D TIPS Double Quench
peak continues to grow. There is a slight dip in the growth of the secondary peak before it starts to increase again. The reason for this in stage III is not certain. At this point for the off-critical quench case, although there is the appearance of a secondary peak growing and forming, its growth does not significantly affect the growth o f the primary structur es that form.

dimensionless diffusion coefficient (see Figures C.37 and C.38 in Appendix C for D = 500 000 and 800 000, respectively). Generally, the trends seem to be pretty consistent for the three stages in all cases o f D studied. In the stage I, right after the second quench, there is a steady increase in the growth rate of the primary peak. The em ergence and the growth of the secondary peak stalls out at a slower rate than the prim aiy peak in stage I. In stage II, the growth of the primary peak increases slightly and steadily and the growth of the secondary peak increase at a m uch faster rate having a steeper slope. In stage III, both the growth o f the

observations are different fi'om those observed experimentally by Hay ash i et al.

[2000a] tor the growth of the maximum scattering intensity with time. Their three stages differ from the one in this study. In stage I, they observe a faster increase in the secondary peak intensity than the primary peak intensity. In stage II, both the growth of the primary and secondary peaks intensities grow at the same rate and in stage III, the growth of the primary peak intensity becomes larger that the secondary peak intensity. The reason for the discrepancy between the

observations in this study and in Hashimoto's work maybe due to the time that the second jump was made. Also, stage III describes the late stages in Hashimoto's work and is omitted from this numerical work. Perhaps the evolution o f the

secondary structures is dependent on the domain size. Hayashi et al. [2000a] have suggested this possibility and also introduced the confinement effect where the size o f the primary structure acts as a new medium for the growth o f the secondar y structures. The smaller- the domain size of the primary structures, the less room for growth of the secondary structures to form and therefore, different growth rates will be observed for the primary and secondary structures. By

comparing the two different observations from making a temperature jump at the beginning of the intermediate stages (in the numerical work of this thesis) and the late stages (experimental work by Hashimoto) shows that the domain size has an effect on the growth patterns.

The second deeper quench for the initial off-critical quench case and its effects on the growth rate of the primary and the secondary structures can be broken down into three regions. The growth rate o f the maximum structure factor after the second quench is plotted against a reduced time, . Figure 6.22

and Figure C. 39 (£) = 500 000) show similar- evolutions in the gr owth rate o f the prim ary and secondary peaks and Figure C.40 {D* = 800 000) shows the same trend as Figures C.37 and C.38 in stages I, II and III. In the stage I, right after the second quench, there is a steady increase in the growth rate of the primary peak for all values o f D investigated. The emergence and the growth of the secondar y peak starts out at a slower rate than the primary peak in stage I with a smaller slope. In stage II, the growth of the primary peak increases slightly and steadily and the grow th o f the secondary peak increase at a much faster rate having a steeper slope. There is slight curvatur e in all three plots of stage II. This may possible be due to the reorganizing of the phase separating mixture to the new com position fluctuations present. In stage III, for Figure 6.22 and C.39, both the grow th o f the primary and secondary peaks continue to increase with the secondary peak increasing at a much faster rate. At this point, the primary and secondary structures are still developing. In stage III for Figure C.40, both the growdh o f the primary and secondary peak starts to level off, indicating that the prim ary structures have reached their equilibrium values while the secondary peaks have growm to a sufficient size. Perhaps, further investigation would lead

-156-

Chapter 6 : 1-D TIPS Double Quench
to the decrease in the growth of the secondary peak when the composition fluctuations from the primary and secondary structures merge together at later stages. This has been obser\'ed experimentally by Hayashi et al. [2000a] and

numerically by Henderson and Clarke [2004] for an initial critical quench and a second jump at the late stages of phase separation by SD and not at the beginning o f the intermediate stages as described here.

Remarks on the Early Stages of Phase Separation After the Second Temperature Jump to T 2 = 0.1 where Secondary Structures are Observed

In the experimental work by Hashimoto et al. [2000] and numerical work by Henderson and Clarke [2004] the evolution of the secondary phase separation, after the second quench, was found to reasonably follow the linear theory in the early stages o f phase separation by SD for a single quench case. To determine if the numerical work presented in this section on the formation o f secondary structures also follows the lineai' theory in the early stages right after the second quench to J 2 = 0 .1 , the plots of the natural log of the dimensionless stmcture factor versus dimensionless reduced time is presented in Figures 6.23 and 6.24 for the initial critical and initial off-critical quench case for D* = 200 000, respectively. Recall that the plot of the natural log of the dimensionless maximum stmcture factor versus dimensionless time should have a linear' region in the early stages of phase separation by SD. As observed for all the profiles, there exists a small linear region after the second quench when the secondary stmctures are

forming. Therefore, the numerical work presented here is consistent with what has been obser\ed by Hashimoto et al. [2000] in experiment and by Henderson and Clarke [2004] in their numerical study on double quenching. Furthermore, it can be observed that in the early stages, the growth of the secondary structures appears to be steeper for D* = 200 000 than 500 000 and 800 000 (refer to Figures C.41 to C.44 in Appendix C). Perhaps, the larger domain size provides a better medium to create new instabilities for phase separation for the secondary structures to form more readily. It has been suggested that the primary structure acts as an individual phase where phase separation occurs as if in a single quench, but within the already separating initial structures [Norton and Frith, 2001]. The

observations presented here are consistent with the work by Hayashi et al. [2000a and 2000b], when investigating the initial domain size and its effects on double phase separation. They observed that if the size of the initial structure is large, then the growth rate of the secondary structiue is faster than for an initial smaller domain size. The critical size to which double phase separation is observed is not known and further analysis both experimentally and numerically is required [Hayashi et al ., 2000a].

Results and Discussion: 2-D TIPS Single and Double Quench
In Chapter 5 and 6, the results fiom the one-dimensional model was presented and discussed based on the non lineai' C-H theoi'y and the F-H-de Gennes free energy for a single and a double quench respectively. The results replicated frequently observed trends o f phase sepaiation by SD in experimental and numerical work. Recall that in analyzing SD, the one-dimensional model provides the detail necessary to describe the dynamics of phase sepaiation with the exception o f detailing the type o f sti'uctui'e formed. This section presents the results o f pattern form ation for a critical and off-critical quench and a brief discussion on the 2-D num erical work. The patterns formed are typical of those formed by SD for the single and double quench. For the single quench, the dimensionless temperature and diffusion coefficient are adjusted to observe the effects on pattern formation and its consistency with the predictions from the 1-D model. For double quenching, the patterns formed from an initial critical and an initial off-critical quench are presented. With the double quench, in order to verify the pattern

Figure 7.1 shows a 2-D structure development (left) and a profile o f the concentration fluctuations (right) for a critical quench, Co* = 0.5, at a single temperature jump of T/ = 0.25, with a dimensionless diffusion coefficient ofD * -- 200 000. The grey scale at the bottom right hand comer of Figure 7.1 shows the different levels of the concentration ranging from c* = 0.0 to c* = 1.0. It has been determined in experiments that the critical quench produces the interconnected structure and the off-critical quench produces the droplet type structure [Hashimoto, 1993]. The structure development on the left shows that the model in this thesis is able to predict the same interconnected structure known for critical quench conditions.

development as the concentration fluctuations increase upon pliase separation (right).

In order to test the effect of D on the critical quench, the value of D* was increased from 200 000 to 500 000. Figure 7.2 shows the evolution o f pattern form ation at £> = 500 000 for the critical quench while maintaining all other param eters the same as in Figure 7.1. From the 1-D model, it was observed that increasing the dimensionless diffusion coefficient increased the rate as well as the amount o f phase separation that occuned. Therefore, this trend should also be observed in the 2-D stmcture development. When comparing the results o f

Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2 it is clear that the rate as well as the amount o f phase separation increased with increasing dimensionless diffusion coefficient. The 1-D and 2-D models aie in agreement with each other for the critical quench case in exam ining the properties of interest.

The grey scale in the bottom right hand comer in Figure 7.3 shows the different levels o f the concentration ranging fiom c = 0.0 to c -- 1.0. The offcritical quench produces the droplet type stmcture from experimental

observations. The evolution of stmcture development on the left shows the same droplet stm cture known for an off-critical quench conditions indicating that the

model developed is in good agreement with experimental work. Notice that as the concentration fluctuations increase (right) the structure development profile shows a range o f shades, indicating the change in concentration, as the mixture is phase separating. One more feature that is captured in the 2-D structure evolution is the spatial distribution of the composition fluctuations are fairly uniform, which is expected in phase separation by SD. In order to test the effect of D on the offcritical quench, the value of D* was increased from 200 000 to 500 000. Figure 7.4 shows the evolution of pattern formation at D* = 500 000 for the critical quench while maintaining all other the saiue as in Figure 7.3. From the 1-D model, it was observed that increasing the dimensionless diffusion coefficient increases the rate as well as the amount of phase separation that occurs. Therefore, this trend should also be observed in the 2-D structure development. When comparing the results of Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4 it is clear that the rate as well as the amount of phase separation increased with increasing dimensionless diffusion coefficient. In the formation of the droplet type structure, another

parameter was tested to verify the agreement of the results from the 1-D study and the 2-D study. The dimensionless temperature was decreased from T * = 0.25 to T i = 0.2 keeping all other parameters the same as in Figure 7.4. By comparing both profiles generated in Figure 7.4 and Figure 7.5, it can be observed that the amount of phase-separated regions increased with time. This was consistent with the observations in the 1-D model when tested for an off-critical quench case. 1-D and 2-D models are in agreement with each other for the off-critical quench case in examining the properties that were of interest.

7.3

Two-Step Phase Separation: Critical Quench

The tw o-step process used for the 2-D study is different ftom that used in the 1-D analysis. The 2-D analysis here was done to observe pattern formation as

predicted horn the experimental work by Hashimoto et al. [2000] and Hayashi et al. [2000a and 2000b] in their 2-step phase sepaiation process to see whether the secondary structures can be observed numerically under the same quenching m ethods. Recall in the 1-D study, the second temperature jump was made at a dim ensionless transition time, which characterized the end of the eai'ly stages and the beginning o f the intermediate stages of SD for the single quench. In this

section, the second temperature jump was made in the late stages o f phase separation by SD where the mixture has reached their respective equilibrium compositions. This method was also used by Tanaka [1993] and Tao et al.,

[1995] in their experimental study of double quenching. Fuithermore, to follow closely to Hashim oto's work [2000], the second quench was made such that the m ixture was still within the unstable region and therefore, was still phase separating by SD. As mentioned in the previous section on the single quench

conditions, due the amount of computing time required for one 2-D simulation, the results shown here are restricted to certain values of T and D that best reflect the objectives o f this thesis. In Figure 7.6 the dimensionless spatial concentration profiles, c ` (x * ,y * ), show the evolution o f structure development for a double critical (Co* -- 0.5) quench from Tj - 0.25 to Tj = 0 .1 with D -- 200 000.

For a critical quench, the

interconnected stm ctuie is formed. Upon making the second quench, at the late stage o f SD, the initial composition for the second quench corresponds to the values ju st before the second quench and are off-critical. Off-critical quenches result in droplet type moiphologies. In Figure 7.6 this interconnected structure is the result o f the primary quench and the droplet type structure is the result of the secondary quench. This pattern formation is consistent with the patterns formed experim entally by Tao et al. [1995] and Tanaka [1993] and numerically with the w ork o f Fïenderson and Clarke [2004]. In Figure 7.6 b), shortly after the second quench, the phase separating regions aie shifting and changing in shape as well as concentration (color intensity). This is consistent with what has been observed by Tanaka in his experimental work where the initial phase separated structure was reorganized when the second quench was made [Tanaka, 1993]. This reorganizing o f the prim ary stiaictures continues with time and is not so obvious to the naked eye once the secondary structures start to appear. The first sign of secondary phase separated regions occurs in Figure 7.6 c) at t = 4.950 and gradually increases in num ber as shown through Figures 7.6 d) to f). The amount of

secondary droplets formed after the second quench were few in number which can be explained by the location of the second temperature jump relative to the spinodal curve. The second quench made in this study was not too far from the spinodal curve, and since the driving force for phase separation is directly related

-172

Chapter 7: 2-D TIPS Pattern Formation (1 & 2 Step)
to the distance of the temperature within the confines of the spinodal curve [Tao et al., 1995], there will be a smaller driving phase separation force. Figure 7.7 shows the evolution of the concentration fluctuations for the same conditions as in Figure 7.6. After the second quench, the composition fluctuations are still rather smooth until f = 4.950, where the first sign of secondary phase separated regions occur. The profile becomes rough and continues to develop this way for the rest of the structure development. From these profiles, especially from a bird's eye view, the dipping of the crests in certain regions are very noticeable, indicating the occurrence o f the constructive and destructive interferences that are occurring from the second quench.

7.4

Two-Step Phase Separation: Off-critical Quench

In the off-critical double quench case, the method for double phase separation is the same as described for the critical quench case. The second quench is made in the late stages o f phase separation by SD and lies within the unstable region to ensure phase separation still occurs by SD. Figure 7.8 shows the 2-D

dimensionless spatial concentration profiles, c * { x \y * ) , o f the evolution o f structure development for a double off-critical ( c / = 0.6) quench from T * = 0.25 to T/ - 0.1 with D ~ 200 000. The dimensionless times correspond to profiles made after the second jump at / = 5.292; (a) t* = 5.294, (b) / = 5.307, (c) t* = 5.313, and (d) t - 5.315 (e) t = 5.317 and (t) 5.320. For an o f f critical double quench, both the primary and secondary structures developed should be o f droplet type and this can be observed in Figure 7.8. Tanaka [1993] and Tao et al. [1995]

have also observed this pattern formation for the off- critical double quench expeiimentally. Shortly after the second quench in Figure 7.8 b), there is a noticeable change in the pattern and concentration o f the primary structui'es. Again, like in the critical double quench case, the contours seem to be rougher as the blend adjusts to the new conditions. There is also a noticeable increase in the contrast as the blend evolves with time indicating that the blend is approaching the new equilibrium conditions of the second quench. The fu st sign of secondary phase separation occurs in Figure 7.8 c) at = 5.313 and the amount of secondary Again, the amount of

secondary droplets formed after the second quench is related to location o f the tem perature for phase separation within the confines o f the spinodal curve [Tao et al., 1995]. Figure 7.9 shows the evolution of the concentration fluctuations for the sam e conditions as in Figure 7.8. After the second quench, the composition fluctuations are still rather smooth until /*= 5.313, where the first sign of secondary phase separated regions occur. The profile becomes rough and From

Chapter 8
Conclusions
A m athem atical model and computer simulations were used to describe the dynamics o f phase separation by spinodal decomposition for the TIPS method (single quench and a double quench) using the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard theory and the Flory-Huggins-de Gennes free energy. The composition dependent mobility was t reated us ing t he s low m ode t heory and t he r eptation t heory was used t o describe the self-diffusion coefficient of the individual polymers in the blend. The composition dependent energy gradient coefficient was treated with the introduction o f an additional entropie term into the F-H free energy, due to the connectivity o f monomer units, to take into account changes in energy due to the creation o f interfaces upon phase separation.

In the first part o f this thesis, for the single critical and off-critical quench case, the numerical results in one and two dimensions replicated frequently observed trends o f phase separation by spinodal decomposition in published experimental and numerical work.

-179-

Chapter 8: Conclusions
In the one-dimensional model, in the early stages o f phase separation by SD, the composition fluctuations grew with time at fixed wavelength and the evolution o f the structure factor was exponential. In the beginning of the intermediate stages, the composition fluctuations were still increasing and nonlinear effects started to take place. This was evident in the evolution of the structure factor. It was found that in the critical quench, phase separation occurred earlier than that for the offcritical quench case at a fixed temperature, and this was due to the location of the quench within the spinodal. The further away (inward) the quench was from the spinodal curve, the more unstable the mixture was with a faster the occurrence o f phase separation. In the investigation o f the quench depth, from a shallower to a deeper quench, the degree of phase separation observed in the spatial composition profiles increased due to the increase in the driving force for phase separation. The time it took to observe the first sign o f phase separation decreased with an increase in quench depth. The dimensionless diffusion coefficient showed an

increase in the rate as w ell as the degree of phase separation in the range o f D = 200 000 to 800 000. Also, the increase dimensionless diffusion coefficient showed a decrease in the characteristic length (domain size), which was calculated from the plots of the structure factor using the maximum values o f the wave number. From a thermodynamic point of view, the plots o f the change in the spatial chemical potential, the driving force for phase separation, showed how equilibrium conditions were approached. The second derivative o f the free

energy with respect to composition showed the relative steepness in the curvature o f the change in free energy (stability, instability and meta-stability) and the

-180-

Chapter 8: Conclusions
increase in the value o f D showed and increasing steepness. I'his renects the

increasing rate o f phase separation observed in the spatial concentration profiles w ith increasing D*.

In the two-dim ensional study, the interest was in obseiving the pattem formation for the critical and off-critical quench was examined. The patterns formed are typical patterns observed in experimental and numerical work. The critical quench case show ed the Interconnected type structure, while the off-critical quench case show ed the droplet type structure.

In the second part o f this thesis, for the two-step quenching with an initial critical and an initial off-critical quench case, the numerical results in one and two dim ensions replicated the observed trends of double phase separation by spinodal decom position in recently published experimental and numerical work.

In the one-dimensional model, the evolution of the spatial concentration profiles show ed tw o different trends depending on the quench depth. For the shallower second quench to T2 * ^ 0.2, the original composition fluctuations fi-om Ti*= 0.25 continued to increase to the new equilibrium compositions with time and no sign o f secondary phase-separated regions occurred. At a deeper second quench to Tj = 0.1, the original composition fluctuations from T\ = 0.25 continued to increase to the new equilibrium compositions with time. However, the composition

fluctuations started to show the appearance o f constructive and destructive interference as tim e increased. Therefore, between the two quench depths

-1 8 1 -

Chapter 8: Conclusions
investigated, it was suggested that there existed a critical quench depth in order for double phase separation to occur where secondary structures are formed. Furthermore, the structure factor for the shallower quench case showed a continuous increase from the original plot of the stimcture factor at Fi = 0.25 with no evidence o f a secondary peak forming and for a deeper second quench, the evolution o f the structure factor showed an increase in the original peak observed in the initial quench with the introduction o f a secondary peak that continued to increase with time. The effect of the increase in the dimensionless diffusion

coefficient showed an increase the rate as well as the amount o f phase separation for both the shallower and deeper quench. A lag time was observed before the occunence of secondary phase separation and it decreased with increase dimensionless diffusion coefficient. It was found that the growth rate of the

secondary structures was faster with lower D . This was considered to be due to the larger domain size formed at lower D* of the primaiy structure providing a larger confinement for the growth of the secondary structures. The growth o f the primary and secondaiy structures after, the second temperature jump, for a shallow quench case was similar to the growth rate of the single quench case. The growth of the primary and secondary structuies after, the second temperature jump, for the initial critical and initial off-critical quench case showed different growth dynamics. The growth rates of the primary and secondary peaks were broken down into three stages. The difference in the time at which the first sign o f phase separation occurs and the growth dynamics was determined to be dependent on the location of the first and second quench within the spinodal and the value o f

D . For the initial critical quench, phase separation occurs at earlier ami tlie

form ation o f secondary structures is faster than tor the initial off-critical quench case. In terms o f evolution of the secondary structures and the linear C-H theory, it was found that the early stages of the formation o f the secondary structures followed the linear C-H theory shown through plots ot the natural log o f the structure factor with time similar to the single quench profiles. From a

therm odynam ic point o f view, the shallower second quench showed similar results in the change in chemical potential and second derivative as for a single quench case. The only difference being at an increased rate. For the second

deeper quench case, the change in the chemical potential showed a plateau when double phase separation was observed. Tbis fattening o f tbe change in chemical potential w as t bought to b e due to tb e r eorganizing o f t be c omposition in t be m ixture as subjected to the new imposed conditions. In the plot of the second derivative with respect to composition for the second deeper quench, evidence o f the form ation and evolution o f a new instability was observed shortly after the second deeper jum p where the local maximum between the two local minimums further divided into a double well shape. This new double well witbin already existing double well became more defined as D was increased.

In the two-dimensional study, the interest was in observing the pattem formation for a double quench with an initial critical quench to see if the model developed was able to predict the experimental work o f Hashimoto and in the numerical work p ublished b y H enderson and C larke in t heir s tudy of do uble que nching. Therefore, the second quench was made in the late stages. The observed pattern

Chapter 8: Conclusions
formation was consistent with that predicted by Hashimoto and in the numerical work of Henderson and Clarke where the second jump after the initial critical quench showed the interconnected structure with droplet type secondary structures forming. In addition to the work o f Hashimoto and Henderson and

Clarke, the second jump (late stages) after an initial off-critical quench was also presented where the observed pattem was droplet type for both the primary and secondary structures. This morphology is consistent with the experimental work o f Tanaka.

The model using the nonlinear C-H and the F-H-deGennes free energy provided a better understanding of the formation and evolution of phase separation by SD for the single and double quench. In particular, for the formation of secondary phaseseparated structures, with the limited amount of both experimental and numerical work published, the numerical work in this thesis provides a better understanding o f the evolution o f secondary phase separation and how the following areas are affected, the composition fluctuations, the structure factor, quench depth, dimensionless diffusion coefficient, evolution of the growth rate o f prim ary and secondary structures, and the change in chemical potential and the second derivative o f free energy.

Appendix A
Galerkin Finite Element Herm itian Basis Functions Method:

In the m ethod o f solution for the fourth order partial differential equation, the Galerkin Finite Element Method was employed. Hermitian basis functions were used as the interpolating functions and are listed in this appendix for the one dim ensional and two-dimensional study.

In a one-dimensional study, each element has 2 double nodes (one for the function and one for the slope) and four basis functions. The basis functions are:

(A I)
(A.2) (A.3) (A.4)

For the two-dimensional study, each element has nodes 4 double nodes and 16 basis functions. The two-dimensional case is a product o f the one-dimensional basis functions in the x and y direction. In the 2-D model, the x, y coordinates are represented by new coordinates in ^,rj space. The four nodes in

space are.

Single Quench: Dimensionless I-D Critical and OffCritical Quench Results

Figures B .l and B.2 show the evolution of the dimensionless spatial concentration profiles for a single quench at the critical composition o f C c = 0.5, a dimensionless tem perature o f T * = 0.25, and dimensionless diffusion coefficients o f D* = 500 000 and 800 000, respectively. Figures B.3 and B.4 show the evolution o f the dim ensionless spatial concentration profiles for a single quench at an off-critical com position o f Cc = 0.6, a dimensionless temperature of T/* = 0.25, and dim ensionless diffusion coefficients o f D* = 500 000 and 800 000, respectively. For all four figures the evolution of the one-dimensional dimensionless spatial concentration profiles show the same trends as observed in experiment. In the early stage, the initial concentration fluctuations appear due to the growth o f the m ost dom inant wavelength and are weakly nonlinear. The wavelength remains constant while the amplitude changes. In the beginning of the intermediate stage, the concentration fluctuations continue to increase and into the intermediate stage

the wavelength starts to change. The only difference in the composition

fluctuations is the effect of increasing D*. As the value o f D (200 000, 500 000, 800

increases, the driving force for phase separation is larger and therefore,

more phase separated regions are developed as discussed in the Chapter 5.

Figures B.7 and B .8 show the evolution of the dimensionless structure factor as a function o f dimensionless wave number, k \ and dimensionless time for the off-critical quench case with D* = 500 000 and 800 000, respectively. In all four figures, the quench temperature is T = 0.25. The critical and off-critical quench case show that the value of the dimensionless structure factor increases exponentially with time in the early stages of phase separation by SD the wave number is constant and begins to slow down as it approaches the beginning of the intermediate stages where nonlinear effects c ome into play. observations made in Chapter 5.

Double Quench: Dimensionless 1-D Critical and OffCritical Quench Results
1-D D im ensionless Spatial Concentration Second Quench Profiles After the

Figures C. 1 to C.4 show the evolution of the dimensionless spatial concentration profile (for an initial critical and an initial off-critical quench) after the second tem perature jum p. The initial phase separation temperature is 7\ *= 0.25 and the second temperature jum p is T2 * - 0.2 at the transition time. The dimensionless diffusion coefficients are D* = 500 000 and 800 000. The transitions times are summ arized in Table 6.2. There is no sign of double phase separation in Figures C .l to C.4. However, notice that in Figures C.3 and C.4, for the initial off-critical quench, there is slight constructive and destructive interference in peak three and peak one for D* = 500 000 and 800 000, respectively. Figures C.5 to C.8 show the evolution o f the dimensionless spatial concentration profile (for an initial critical and an initial off-critical quench) after the second temperature jum p to Ti * = 0.1 at the transition times for D* = 500 000 and 800 000, respectively. There

are noticeable constructive and destructive interferences observed for the deeper quench attributed to the formation of secondary structures. Refer to Chapter 6 for discussion.

Evolution o f the Dimensionless Structure Factor After the Second Quench
Figures C.9 and C.IO show the evolution of the dimensionless structure factor after the second quench to Ti* = 0.2 from the initial critical quench aiT \* = 0.25 for D* = 500 000 and 800 000, respectively. Figures C .ll and C.12 show the evolution of the dimensionless structure factor after the second quench to Tj = 0.2 from the initial off-critical quench a tf f = 0.25 for D* = 500 000 and 800 000, respectively. The box in the right hand comer o f Figure C.l 1 and Figure C.12 shows an enlarged plot o f the g rowth of the secondary peak. The results are

different from the evolution of the dimensionless structure factor observed for the critical quench case and for the initial off-critical quench case. There was no sign o f double phase separation present and for the initial critical quench case and the growth of the structure factor showed an increase in the intensity o f the primary peak but no occurrence of a secondary peak forming. For the intial off-critical quench case, a slight secondary peak was observed to form with increasing D*. However, the impact was minimal and no secondary phase separated regions formed.

Figures C.41 to C.44 show the plots of the natural log o f the dimensionless structure factor versus dimensionless reduced time for the initial critical and initial off-critical quench case with Z)* = 500 000 and 800 000, respectively. These plots were used to determine if the numerical work presented in this section on the form ation o f secondary structures also follows the linear theory in the early stages right a fter t he s econd que nch to = 0 .1. A l l f our F igures s how t he
