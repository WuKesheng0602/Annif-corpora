Abstract

Energy used by primary and secondary Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems in post-secondary schools can account for a significant share of the total energy expenditure throughout the lifetime of these buildings. The following is a study of a Ryerson University buildings' Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning system through the use of eQUEST energy modelling techniques. A baseline energy model was created and was compared to the buildings' existing energy consumption, and energy intensity benchmarks. Suggested improvements to the existing Variable Air Volume system were determined by comparing the baseline VAV eQUEST simulation against two subsequent hydronic based eQUEST models; the Fan Coil System, and the Water Source Heat Pump System.

1. Introduction The goal of this research is to determine what building equipment upgrades can achieve energy efficiency in a midsized post-secondary institutional building located on Ryerson University campus through the use of energy modeling estimates.

Energy efficient green buildings can be implemented by integrating a variety of design strategies. However, all green buildings should consider the absolute reduction in energy use as a central strategy. According to the Building Science Corporation: "The solution to this problem begins with awareness of the importance of operational energy consumption to environmental damage, resource depletion, habitat destruction, and hence, to green buildings. Solutions will take many forms, but all will involve prediction of energy consumption, and confirmation that the designed low-energy building is actually built and operated as one." (Straube, John, 2009).

According to the US Department of Energy, there are a variety of mature building automation technologies that are either unused or underutilised within multi-zoned buildings (DOE, 2012) which can reduce overall energy use. Moreover, the CMHC estimates that a well-constructed, multi-zone midrise buildings' operational energy can account for as much as 74% of the energy consumed over a building's lifetime (CMHC, 2000). The energy intensity of office building with underground parking averaged over wood, steel and concrete structures in Vancouver and Toronto for 50 years is shown in Figure 1. The graph illustrates that the total Operational Energy represents 85.5% of the total energy consumed by these building types as compared to 8.3% and 6.2% for
1

Recurring Embodied Energy, and Initial Embodied energy respectively. Although the building in this research is not an office building, the graph does provide an indication of the relative importance of operational energy in perimeter-core buildings in urban Canada.

Figure 1: Office Building in Vancouver and Toronto (CanadianArchitect, 2012)

This makes for a compelling argument that current and future energy use is perhaps the most important issue to be address when designing the built environment. A properly designed building envelope establishes the theoretical limits on whole building performance, and can significantly minimize the energy required to operate the building. However even the best designed building envelopes can become increasingly energy inefficient without a minimum level of controlled conditioned air. The proportion of

2

financial first costs of Building Services is also a motivating factor in building design. In fact, mechanical systems can represent up to 15% of capital costs for

Schools/Universities, and nearly 20-25% of a building's construction cost for specialty buildings such as Medical Facilities and Laboratories. (Daryl L. Orth, 2009). This research effort is both timely and complimentary to Ryerson's Energy Reduction program which is part of the University's overall sustainability strategy. Through the application of this strategy Ryerson's heat energy consumed was reduced by 25% by decommissioning on the campus' central boiler plant and co nverting the primary heating system over to a district heating system supplied by Enwave (Ryerson-University, 2012). Perhaps this investigation of secondary HVAC Systems can help Ryerson

University achieve further gains in its quest for efficient energy management.

2. Methodology & Approach

At the outset a literature review was undertaken to evaluate the current state of knowledge in HVAC application for multi-level, perimeter-core buildings. When possible, the journal entries and articles pertaining to cold heating dominated climates were favoured. The information that was unearthed included information ranging from "best practices" for HVAC energy efficiency, to Case Studies examined in technical journals. A shortlist of four buildings were initial selected this study in order to reflect a diversity of building programming, floor plate size, building height and equipment vintage. Those buildings included the Ryerson's Undergraduate Library, The Engineering Building, The Architecture Building, and Eric Palin Hall. All four buildings were both large enough to have multiple thermal zones, and warranted the use of a Building Automation System. Eric Palin Hall was finally selected from this shortlist based on its unique construction history, massing qualities and available data. Long term energy data as well as architectural and mechanical drawings were requested and provided by Ryerson's Campus Facilities. Energy usage over several years allow for the detection of seasonal or yearly anomalies to be identified. A rudimentary energy model was constructed in eQUEST based on the architectural, mechanical, and operational and energy use data collected. The baseline eQUEST energy model was compared to both actual energy consumption data, and to select benchmarks from national or provincial databases. Two additional eQUEST energy simulation models with identical building envelopes and loading conditions were produced with upgraded secondary Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning equipment.
4

The difference in energy consumption were computed and compared to determine if any significant energy savings could be gained from a proposed system upgrade.

3. Energy Benchmarks and Simulations

Energy benchmarking is an important part of building design and evaluation since it allows for the objective comparison of a current building with: modeled simulations, existing governmental targets, existing building stock, or for a comparison between energy models themselves. A convenient manner to measure building energy use is to use measured or modeled energy per unit area (Group, 2012). Convenient and

comprehensive values for energy intensity by building type, climate location, and building size can be found in benchmark data sources such as National Resources Canada (NRCAN, 2007), BOMA BESt (BOMA, 2011) or even the Environmental

Protection Agency (EPA, 2003). Detailed building simulations verified against actual energy usage can help confirm which HVAC systems or components are responsible for the most significant share of energy usage (Hyunjoo Kim, 2011). However, for a building simulation model to approach the actual energy performance of the building, it is necessary to have detailed information about building occupancy, thermostat settings, and detailed metering information from the utility authorities responsible (Bejrowski, 2008).

4. Central Heating and Cooling

5

For cold climates, a select variety of central heating and cooling plants are typically in use for large core and perimeter buildings. There are general two types of system in common usage; the All Air Systems such as Constant Air Volume and Variable Air Volume, or Hydronic Systems; which include Fan Coil and Water Source Heat Pumps. The energy required to service these various systems can originate from a district energy system, or locally in a heating plant and cooling plant. These central plants are typically sized according to the building at peak load rather than the sum of individual maximum loads. For instance, the maximum solar load will not occur at the same time on the south and west façade. Hence the central plant is typically sized appropriately using a diversity factor which can be as little as 45% of the sum of all peak loads in a particular building being served (ASHRAE, 2008). However, caution should be

exercised when estimating energy usage solely based on building demand via primary heating and cooling equipment such as boilers and chillers. The operation and behaviour of the secondary HVAC equipment such as the Air Handling Units, Fan Coils, and Water Source Heat Pumps and VAV's m ust be taken consideration. A single building can have drastically different energy usage patterns in the cooling and heating seasons based on the secondary equipment selected. (Ivan Korolija, 2010).

5. Variable Air Volume System

HVAC systems utilizing the Variable Air Volume system achieve thermal comfort by varying the quantity of conditioned supply air delivered to the space rather than varying the temperature of the air being supplied to the space. Perhaps the greatest energy saving feature of the VAV system is near the perimeter. At the perimeter of the building
6

solar cooling loads varying with outside temperature. This allows for supply air quality to the perimeter to be reduced. Humidity control can be a problem with VAV systems for areas that are sensitive to fluctuating humidity such as laboratories and spaces that house industrial process. In these cases Constant Volume air handling must be applied (ASHRAE, 2008, p. 4.11). Additionally, there may be a risk of poor occupant comfort due to reduced air circulation under some thermal loading conditions with VAV systems. This occurs because the human body is more sensitive to elevated temperature in the areas of poor air circulation. Since the skins ability for evaporative cooling is reduced, the reduced a VAV system must make adjustments to conform to this need. More specifically, part load conditions may require (a) the need to raise supply air temperature of the entire system, thus increasing humidity; (b) supply reheat or auxiliary heat in the particular zone, in addition to already condition air, or (c) provide a method of air recirculation such as an induction unit, blended air recirculation with plenum or room air with supply air (ASHRAE, 2008, p. 4.11).

7

Figure 2: Variable Air Volume System Schematic

A schematic of the Variable Air Volume System is illustrated in Figure 2. Fresh outdoor air and return air are mixed together before entering the Air Handling Unit which can provide all or most of the air conditioning requirements to the occupied space. When the outdoor conditions are below the minimum supply air requirements, the AHU' s heating coil warms the incoming air to satisfy the design temperatures. Similarity, the cooling coil is activated if the outdoor conditions are above the designed supply air temperature. The air is circulated via a fan in the central AHU and sent to the occupied spaces. The thermostat, identified in a green circling the symbol "T", modulates the supply volume of conditioned air via a small damper in the VAV box. The VAV box is typically located in the ceiling plenum. The schematic in Figure 2 shows two possible Variable Air Volume

8

configurations. One configuration supplies an occupant space via VAV with a hot water reheat coil while the other VAV duct is without a hot water reheat capability.

6. Fan Coil System

As opposed to the VAV all air system, the Fan Coil System conditions air from within a zone and is thus classified as an In-Room Terminal System. These units will recirculate tempered air by forced convection in a room through its heating or cooling coils. The coils are typically supplied with cold water or a hot water solution. The basic elements of fan coil unit are the finned tube heating/cooling coil, the filter, and the fan. The temperature of the air from the Fan Coil is modified by the modulation of fan speed, fluid speed or a combination of both. The most common method of supplying the water to the cooling coils is by using a Two Pipe or Four Pipe system. The Two Pipe system supplies either chilled water or hot water in the first pipe and returning cool water or warm water in the other pipe. These Two Pipe fan coils require a seasonal changeover which switches the whole building between cooling and heating seasons. The advantage of the four pipe system is that it does not require a change over date since both chilled water and hot water can be supplied to a battery of units simultaneously. The Two Pipe systems have a lower initial cost on account of half the piping requirement, but four pipe systems are typically more efficient since they can accommodate simultaneous heating and cooling needs that arise in the perimeter-core buildings and during transition seasons. On the whole, fan coil units require periodic maintenance of the filter and condensate drain and piping. The condensate drain pan

9

must be cleaned to avoid water accumulation in the zones and lower the risk of bacterial growth (ASHRAE, 2008).

Figure 3: Fan Coil System Schematic

Figure 3 illustrates the basic functions of a Fan Coil System. Fresh air is taken from the outdoors with a Make-Up Air Unit which may temper incoming air with a preheat coil marked in this illustration by a "P". Since space conditioning takes place near the occupied space rather than at a central rooftop condition, the supply air condition can be broader in the FCU system as compared to VAV. Once the supply air reaches the Fan Coil Unit it is fully conditioned based on the thermostat settings in the occupied space denoted with a letter "T". The illustration shows the configuration of both an interminal Fan Coil and plenum mounted Fan Coil system in the two rooms.

7. Water Source Heat Pump System

The water source heat pump is single packaged piece of equipment that provides both heating and cooling by utilising water as a heat source during the heating season and water as a heat sink during the cooling season. Heat is transferred between the air and water via a refrigerant which has a low boiling point. The main components of a Water Source Heat Pump are; the compressor, the refrigerant to water heat exchanger, the refrigerant to air heat exchanger, an expansion device and a reversing valve which changes the mode of operation. Water Source Heat Pumps can be located directly in the zone as vertical and horizontal units, in the room plenum, or serve several zones by being located in a hallway plenum (ASHRAE, 2008). In practice, the WSHP is a

replacement alternative to the VAV system with re-heat. Although each individual Water Source Heat Pump defines its individual zone, it is tied together to other WSHP's through a single water loop and can thus be considered a system. Instead of a central duct system the WSHP uses the water loop to move energy around the building as needed. Although individual heat pumps may reverse from cooling mode to heating mode the central water loop linking all these heat pumps can remain between 21 oC and 32oC year round. The risk of condensation on the pipe surfaces are minimized since the pipe temperatures are always above the air's dew point (Ask, 2008).

11

Figure 4: Water Source Heat Pump System Schematic

Figure 4 illustrates the basic functions of a Water Source Heat Pump System. Fresh air is taken from the outdoors with a Make-Up Air Unit which may tempered the air with a preheat coil marked in this illustration by a "P". Since space conditioning takes place near the occupied space rather than at a central rooftop condition, the supply air condition will be broader than a VAV system. Similarly to the FCU describe above, the supply air reaches the WSHP and is fully conditioned in local coils. Unlike the FCU, lower grade heat is captured through the refrigerant cycle and delivered to the zone to be conditioned. The illustration shows both a terminal WSHP and Plenum mounted WSHP.

8. System Comparisons

HVAC system can be readily compared for performance by use of software simulations. The Air Conditioning manufacturer McQuay has done such an analysis for a particular new School in the Chicago area. In their simulation comparison, McQuay examined various common HVAC solutions and examined; their maximum loading capabilities, total first costs, utility costs, maintenance cost, energy intensity, and energy intensity per dollar as shown in Table 1 below. The highlighted items represent the system types of interest. According to this analysis, the building energy usage for VAV system were higher than the standard WSHP and FCU systems. However the energy intensity cost were higher with the WSHP and FCU as compared to the VAV simulation. The annual energy intensity and energy intensity per dollar was further reduced below that of the VAV when a heat recovery systems such as enthalpy wheels were implemented.

9. Building Selection: Eric Palin Hall

A site tour was conducted on a short list of buildings including; the undergraduate library the engineering building and the architecture building and Eric Palin Hall . Eric Palin Hall was ultimately selected to perform the research. EPH is located on 87 Gerrard Street, Toronto, Ontario and sits on approximately 3507m 2 of land in the North East section of Ryerson University Campus. The building itself has been through a number of major renovations.

Figure 7: East Elevation, Addition of 5th and 6th Floor It was originally constructed as a two story building as the Technology Annex 1971 (Lee, 2012). The building envelope was clad in precast concrete panels and the ground floor remains partially buried. In 1985, a third and fourth floor were added. This time the walls made of a combination of poured concrete and concrete masonry units, clad in metal wall siding with 3" of insulation. Finally in 2002, an additional 5 th and 6th floor were added to the building with these additional floors consisting of a mixture of curtain wall, metal wall siding and prefabricated concrete panels.

10. Eric Palin Hall HVAC System Description

The building currently has seven Air Handling Units installed on the roof served by a glycol solution for heating coils and chilled water for the cooling coils. The Air Handling units are also equipped for low pressure steam humidification. There is also an air cooled condensing unit and five heat exchangers. One heat exchanger is dedicated for the domestic hot water supply, two others are dedicated to service the Air Handlers and the remaining exchangers are to supply the VAV boxes with hot water reheat. Steam is provided to the basement of the facility from Enwave's central district heating system (Ryerson-University, 2012) that serves downtown Toronto buildings within the financial core. The high pressure steam is stepped down to medium pressure steam in the risers and further reduced to low pressure steam for each AHU. Condensate from all processes is collected in a condensate receiver and returned to the central chilled water plant. Chilled water is supplied to the Eric Palin Hall through a Ryerson Campus Central Cooling Plant located at the roof and basement of the edifice. Three chillers are located

17

in the basement, one of which was newly installed in spring of 2012. For heat rejection, recently upgraded cooling towers are located on the library rooftop.

Figure 9: Primary HVAC System Schematic

A schematic description of EPH/SHE's primary HVAC system is illustrated in Figure 9 with the cooling plant on the left hand side and the heating plant located on the right. The chilled water demand is similarly metered centrally at the cooling plant located atop and below the Ryerson University Library Building. The 416 kPa steam is stepped down to a low pressure steam of 103 kPa which is fed to all of the seven Air Handling Units for steam humidification. Another portion of the low pressure steam is directed to the unit heaters in the penthouse and the remaining steam is used in the five heat exchangers. One steam heat exchanger is used to heat the domestic hot water. Two

18

other heat exchangers are used to heat the Glycol solution for the AHU heating coils. The remaining heat exchanger is used to transfer the steam's energy to heat the hot water supply for the VAV reheat coils the 5 and 6th floors. The Chilled water supply is pumped at 79L/s directly into the air handling cooling coils when needed.

Figure 10: Secondary HVAC System Schematic

The secondary HVAC system is illustrated in Figure 10, where the linkage between the cooling and heating are made clear. The occupied space is supplied by a combination of Variable Air Volume and VAV with hot water re-heat. The first four floors are cooled with several VAV boxes while the newest fifth and six floors are supplied with VAV with hot water reheat. Conditioned air is supplied by seven rooftop air handlers with heating coils, cooling coils, and steam humidification capabilities. The conditioned air is
19

distributed by AHU's fan via ductwork. The conditioned air is further and controlled by Variable Air Volume boxes spread throughout the core and shell of the building. Analysis of the mechanical building plans reveal that there are 40 VAV boxes on the 6 th floor and 39 VAV boxes on the 5th floor with approximately 189 VAV boxes throughout the whole building. The VAV boxes that supply these zones vary in capacity from 47 L/s to 590 L/s of supply air.

11. Simulation Inputs

The simulation inputs were determined from the mechanical drawings, the architectural drawings, and the operational HVAC set points supplied by the Campus Facilities and Sustainability Office. For modeling purposes, the building envelope was estimated to be made of a uniform material of 203 mm concrete walls with RSI of 2.61 and with galvanized steel finish. In reality the building envelope is partly made up of concrete masonry units, poured concrete with and smaller proportion of curtain wall and metal frame supported siding and precast concrete. The ground floor was modeled as above grade despite the fact that the ground floor is partially below ground. The roof was modeled as Built-Up-Roof supported 102 mm concrete slab with RSI 4.4 insulation. The window to wall ratio were determined using BLUEBEAM PDF Revu (BlueBeam Software, 2012) software which allowed for the direct measurement and calculation of the window and spandrel panel areas for each exterior wall.

20

Table 2: Building Envelope Simulation Inputs Table 2 shows the details of the simulation inputs used in the eQUEST simulated baseline model. This includes the roof, above grade walls, ground floor, shell tightness, ceilings floors and exterior windows. The note column indicates a "manual" or "auto/default" to identify which inputs were determined or calculated (ie. Manual) from

21

information collected during the building audit or set as automatically by eQUEST based on general building type supplied by the user.

Table 3: Activity Area Allocation Inputs

To determine the building occupancy of EPH/SHE an Area allocation was estimated based on the building architectural drawings. Default values for area type occupancy and design ventilation per area type were determined based on the area values as listed in Table 3.

22

Table 4: Occupancy and Schedule Inputs

EPH's building occupancy and scheduling inputs were entered in accordance to the default settings of eQUEST as shown in Table 4. In addition, Lighting, Task Lighting, and Plug Loads were held constant for all simulation cases. It should be noted that actual occupant loading may vary during a twelve month period since enrollment during the summer months may be reduced. However, the eQUEST simulation did not take fluctuations in load schedule and occupancy into consideration.

23

Figure 11: Simulated HVAC System Schematic

The HVAC system was modelled by using a chiller and boiler plant instead of a district heating arrangement as seen in Figure 11. The single Air Handling Unit is representative of the total cooling heating and air supply required for the simulated version of EPH. The local chiller and boilers were auto-sized based on the building size and details of the air handling equipment provided based on inspection and calculations. The conversion of the steam to Glycol solution and hot water was simplified to two boilers with additional domestic hot water supply. The centrally supplied chilled water was simplified to a local chiller and cooling tower configuration.

24

Table 5: Variable Air Volume Simulation Input Typical design temperature set points for the cooling and heating season were taken from Campus Facilities and added manually to the model. The details of the manually and auto-sized HVAC system data used in the eQUEST simulation is summarised in Table 5. The minimum design airflow value in Table 5 is actually the result of a detailed set of calculations based on the drawings EPH's HVAC system. eQUEST requires that a total value of the AHU's be entered into the software program to estimate energy
25

usage, rather than adding every individually know equipment separately. Hence the known data was assemble and combined into a single amalgamated Air Handling Unit, with a calculated return and supply fan power, heating load, and supply air volume per unit area. The actual ventilation for first, second, third, and fourth floors were calculated based on HVAC equipment available from the previous renovations as seen in Table 6.

Table 6: Total Air Flow per Unit Area

On the fifth and sixth floor, Air flow per unit area was determined by tabulating the minimum and maximum air flows for each Variable Air Volume box listed in the SHE's mechanical drawings. These values were then input to the calculation shown in Table 6. Hence the average airflow per unit area served was based on the total area served and the estimated total supply air delivered.

26

Table 7: Total Airflow on 5th and 6th Floors

27

Table 8: Four Pipe Fan Coil Simulation Inputs To simulate a Fan Coil System, the only choice was to use the four pipe system. eQUEST 3-64 does not allow for the simulation of a two pipe system at this time. The cooling and heating set points, together with the cooling design temperature and heating design temperatures were kept constant to match the conditions in the eQUEST VAV simulation as shown in Table 8. The minimum design air flow was also held

28

constant based on the actual building air flow rate as specified and calculated in Table6. The overall power and motor efficiency of the supply fans was auto-sized by eQUEST. The chilled water system, the chillers and primary heating equipment was also autosized. They were set to the same capacity range as in the Variable Air Volume eQUEST simulation. However the heat rejection via the Open Tower was changed manually to match the VAV simulation equipment.

Table 9: Water Source Heat Pump Simulation Inputs

29

To simulate the Water Source Heat Pump System, the Direct Expansion cooling and heating sources were selected. The cooling and heating set points, together with the cooling design and heating design temperatures, were kept constant and matched the VAV eQUEST System and the Four Pipe Fan Coil eQUEST System simulations for consistency. Table 9 shows that the minimum design air flow was also held constant based on the actual building rate as specified and calculated in Table 6. The overall size of the packaged HVAC equipment was auto-sized by eQUEST. The chilled water system, the chillers and primary heating equipment were also auto-sized. These were kept at the same capacity range as in the Variable Air Volume eQUEST simulation and Four Pipe Fan Coil eQUEST simulation. As before, the heat rejection via the Open Tower was changed manually to match both the VAV and the FCU simulation input parameters.

12. Results

Figure 12: Actual and Simulated Annual Energy Intensity

Actual energy intensity was compared to the simulated energy usage as shown in Figure 12. The actual energy usage was determined to be approximately 15% below the predicted energy usage estimated by the energy model at 0.93 GJ/ m 2 compared to 1.07 GJ/ m2. There are several reasons why this discrepancy between the energy model and the actual data may exist. First the quantity of energy consumed by EPH/SHE is an averaged value for a steam meter that represents 9.5% of the total steam consumption by building area. The total area served by meter 1 is 223127m2 of
31

(Hossain, 2010). EPH only estimated to accounts for 21050 m2 or 9.5% of that space heating demand. This means that high performance buildings and low performance buildings energy consumption may be masked by other buildings tied to the same meter. Currently there is no other comparable method to track the actual steam consumption of EPH/SHE without the installation of steam mass flow meter at the inlet of the building. Additionally, steam humidification which is present in actual EPH building adds sensible heat to the supply air. As a result there may be some marginal efficiency gained from the steam humidification during the heating season. Furthermore, simplifications were made with the simulated building envelope based on the most prominently used wall and insulation features in the architectural drawings. Infiltration and exfiltration rates where auto-calculated by eQUEST based on the building type and envelope specification input by the user. Lastly, the Variable Air Volume eQUEST energy model is based on a central boiler and chiller plant which is less efficient than a district heating system which is in current use. As discussed above, Ryerson University had decommissioned its' central boiler plant and replaced it with Enwave's steam service. This enabled Ryerson to save up to 25% in steam related energy (RyersonUniversity, 2012). Moreover, Ryerson University also uses a recently upgraded central chilling plant located in the undergraduate library that services most of the cooling needs of the campus. This difference may also account for the variation in energy intensity between the actual and simulated EPH/SHE buildings.

Figure 13: Annual Energy Intensity Benchmark Comparison It is important to compare the actual total annual energy consumption to other benchmarks. Figure 13 depicts the actual and simulated annual energy intensity in GJ/m2 of Eric Palin Hall to applicable standards. The first and most important

observation is that the actual energy usage of EPH is significantly below the Survey of Ontario Universities 2003 at 1.23 GJ/m2. , National Resources Canada Handbook 2009 by building sector at 1.65 GJ/m2 and by National Resources Canada 2005, Survey of all Universities in Canada at 2.65GJ/m2 (NRCAN, 2007). The large difference between these energy benchmarks can be attributed to the building sample attributed to each
33

benchmark. The data sets represent a broad building spectrum and can make comparisons between the actual energy intensity and the benchmark values tentative. First, the building of the same general type can have tremendous variation in total floor area, massing, and dominant occupant use. Secondly, building location will affect energy consumption due to the differences in climate zone. With the exception of Vancouver, the Greater Toronto Area represents one of the mildest climates in the Canada and Ontario. Building age is also a significant factor in biasing building energy benchmarks use since many of the older schools have been built with brick and block construction. This usually implies that the older buildings would have been constructed with little or no insulation and poor airtightness, all of which would increase the energy intensity as expressed by a benchmark.

Figure 14: Annual Electrical Usage

Figure 14 shows that the total annual electricity usage between the simulated and actual EPH data is within 0.5% at 3 963 000 kWh to 3 944 000 kWh respectively. Although electricity is metered directly at EPH/SHE, how the electricity is being used has yet to be detailed. As discussed above, the lighting schedule was automatically estimated by eQUEST based on building operation guidelines, input building usage, massing and location. However many of these loading conditions are a result of nonHVAC related equipment and hence were out of the scope of this research.

Actual Electrical energy use was plotted against simulated electrical energy use in Figure 15. This graph shows a slightly positive correlation between actual and simulated electrical data during summer months between June and August.

Figure 16: Simulated versus Actual Electrical Energy Use Heating Season Actual Electrical energy use was plotted against simulated electrical energy use in Figure 16. This graph shows a slightly positive correlation between actual and simulated electrical data during winter months between December and February.

Figure 17: Simulated Intensity for VAV FCU and WSHP Three simulations with different secondary Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems were simulated with identical building envelopes and internal loading conditions to determine whether a system change could improve the overall energy efficiency of EPH/SHE. Figure17 shows that the simulated annual energy intensity for the Variable Air Volume, Fan Coil Unit and Water Source Heat Pump HVAC systems are 1.07 GJ/m2, 0.88 GJ/m2 and 0.89 GJ/m2 respectively. This results in a net energy efficiency gain of 21% and 20% for the Four Pipe Fan Coil and the Water Source Heat Pump Systems respectively. In order to insure that the comparisons were conservative, the VAV model was given the most efficient configurations for the eQUEST simulation.
37

This included an economising cycle and the use of Variable Speed Drive VAV boxes rather than single speed settings.

Figure 18: Simulated Monthly Energy Intensity Since Figure 17 has been visually demonstrated that the VAV configuration is the most energy intense of the three simulated configurations, it can be further shown what conditions cause the extra energy consumption. Simulated monthly energy intensity by system and by month is shown in Figure 18. It is clear that the VAV consumes more energy during the heating and shoulder seasons between the months, October through April. The VAV's highest relative energy consumption occurs during the months of March and December. The VAV system only marginally performs better in the Month of
38

June and September. The FCU consumes less energy as compared to the WSHP during the hot summer months yet consumes slightly more energy than the WSHP over the transition months.

Figure 19: Simulated Energy Usage per Subsystem The total annual energy consumption is compared in equivalent kWh and is further disaggregated by building subsystem. The additional energy consumption of the simulated VAV systems is clearly shown by the Space Heating column where a comparison of the various simulated systems has shown that the VAV is was nearly twice the amount of energy as compared to the FCU and WSHP systems. The Fan Coil unit uses relatively more pumping energy as a result of its four pipe systems required.
39

Also in relative term, the WSHP System uses electricity for spacing heating and more electricity for space cooling on account of its' compressors controlling the flow o f refrigerant. However, the dominant feature of this graph is the quantity of energy used for space heating.

13. Conclusion

An energy model of Eric Palin Hall has been created through the use of architectural, mechanical, and operational information. Based on the information available it was determined energy efficiency improvements would be more accurate based on the replacement of secondary HVAC equipment rather than optimizing the building automations operational set points. EPH/SHE actual energy data was compared to the eQUEST simulation model that attempted to replicate the Variable Air Volume system currently in use. Actual annual energy intensity was found to be 0.93 GJ/m 2 and 1.07 GJ/m2 for the Actual and Simulated VAV cases respectively. The two additional models where created with differing secondary HVAC equipment: a Fan Coil Unit System and a Water Source Heat Pump system. The primary system including the heating and cooling plants we held constant to the base case. These simulations yielded values of 1.07 GJ/m22, 0.88 GJ/m2, and 0.89 GJ/m2 for the VAV, FCU, and WSHP for the secondary systems respectively. These results suggest that a Water Source Heat Pump could be considered as a the most viable and practical equipment replacement option in EPH/SHE for short and long term energy efficiency.

14. Discussion

Eric Palin Hall is currently using an All Air System to supply comfort to its occupants. All Air System centrally condition their supply air at locations which can be at considerable distances from the targeted terminal spaces to be conditioned. EPH's conditioned air is conveyed through the use of central fans located in the Air Handling Units located on the roof of the building. The remote distance between the AHU and the terminal space to be conditioned can create considerable wasteful energy losses or gains throughout the ductwork distribution system. As a result, a supply volume of air above the minimum ventilation air may be supplied to the space to achieve occupant comfort. In addition when certain climatic conditions arise a supply air quantity may not satisfy occupant ventilation requirements to achieve thermal comfort. In such cases a reheat coil is supplied to the VAV boxes. VAV with reheat is typically discouraged since it can

increase a Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning's system energy consumption significantly due to waste associated with the reheat process. As was shown in the simulation data in Figure 18, VAV systems can be particularly wasteful in transition periods where the climatic conditions are more variable. This additional waste is

primarily due to the timing of the switch-over period where either the cooling plant is turned off and the heating plant is turned on or vice versa. However VAV systems can excel in constant and or extreme loading conditions, especially in the cooling season. Hydronic based systems however are able to deal effectively with transition periods and typically excel at part load conditions. One of the main reasons for these advantages is the of energy delivery medium of such systems. Hydronic systems use the ideal fluid, water, which can deliver, or remove heat from a conditioned space more effectively and
44

more efficiently than Air Systems. Water has approximately 3.5 times the specific heat capacity and nearly 1000 times the density of air. As a result, less heating or cooling of the water is required. Moderate temperature ranges are acceptable in the case of Water Source Heat Pumps and heat transmission losses or gain can be more easily minimized during its' distribution to terminal units. In addition, the natural advantages of hydronic systems are their ability to achieve occupant comfort by simultaneous heating and cooling without the use addition energy. Many core and perimeter buildings may have cooling loads year round. The WSHP can use this waste heat to balance the perimeter heating needs by transferring energy from the core terminal spaces into the water supply then extract that same energy and supply demand at the perimeter. This energy scavenging process will reduce the need to chill or heat circulating water and that does not require central controlling. The energy scavenging can be modulated by the difference in each terminal space temperature and their respective zone thermostats settings. Furthermore, the integration of heat recovery systems such as enthalpy wheels, and water based economizers with hydronic systems can increase energy efficiency beyond that which was simulated in this study (see Table 1). FCU and the WSHP eQUEST simulations were virtually identical in terms of potential energy intensity savings (see Figure 17). However, the simulated FCU system was a Four Pipe system rather than a Two Pipe system. EPH/SHE is already configured to a two pipe system, one supply and one return pipe with condensate tubing. Renovation costs could possibly be prohibitive to for a Four Pipe system in this circumstance. If a Two Pipe FCU system was implemented, the expected saving if any, would likely be less than 21% calculated by eQUEST. The loss in efficiency in the Two Pipe system is
45

based on the inability to perform simultaneous heating and cooling. However, Water Source Heat Pump System only require two pipes and condensate return which is already installed to support the current VAV with hot water reheat. Eric Palin Hall has been undergone two major renovations in the last four decades. It may be worthwhile to consider upgrading the secondary HVAC system to improve whole building energy efficiency. Based on the preliminary findings any future renovation proposal should consider the inclusion of a WSHP as a viable alternative to further reduce Eric Palin Hal energy consumption.
