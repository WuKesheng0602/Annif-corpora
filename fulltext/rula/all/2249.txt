Y ing Zhao, M aster of Applied Science, Electrical & Com puter Engineering, Ryerson University High speed d a ta transm ission in wireless networks demands b etter radio resource m an agem ent schemes. T he research work for this thesis considers packet scheduling in downlinks of a cellular CDMA system for delay-tolerant applications. In this thesis, a packet scheduling scheme is proposed th a t attem p ts to provide fair allocation of individuals throughout and obtain relatively high system throughput. It is based on combined consideration of channel conditions, required th roughput and achieved average throughput. A priority factor and system tolerance factor are introduced. We confirmed the tradeoff between system throughout (i.e., efficiency) and individual throughput (i.e., fairness) by b o th analysis and sim ulation. Relative perform ance between the proposed scheme and trad itio n al schemes is evaluated through sim ulation to confirm the analytical observations. T he sensitivity of system tolerance factor tow ards efficiency and fairness was also investigated. Overall, the proposed scheme perform s between absolute unfairness scheme and absolute fairness scheme in term s of system throughput and fair allocation of individual throughput.

F uture m obile com m unication system s are expected to provide a broad range of m ultim edia transm ission capabilities. T hey should also be able to handle a wide variety of services w ith b it ra te requirem ents ranging from a few kbps to as much as 2 M bps [2]. CDM A has been proposed as th e m ultiple access technique for th e next generation wireless com m unications system s, as specified in the In ternatio n al Mobile Telecom m unication 2000 (IMT2000) propos als. As tetherless com m unication and com puting become m ore and m ore ubiquitous, future w ibeband C D M A system s are required to efficiently utilize th e lim ited wireless spectrum due to th e rapidly growing dem ands for high d a ta ra te services. Taking into account th e b u rsty n a tu re of d a ta traffic and tim e-varying dem and for resources from video traffic, packet transm ission over wireless links m ake it possible to achieve a high sta tistic a l m ultiplexing gain [3]. Packet com m unication technology, which is w ell-suited for m ultim edia com m unications, copes w ith th e traffic and quality of service (QoS) variations in the downlink wireless com m u n icatio n environm ent. To sim ultaneously m axim ize wireless resource u tilizatio n and g u aran  tee QoS satisfaction, packet transm ission needs to be scheduled properly in CDM A networks. B eing one o f th e m ost im p o rtan t com ponents of quality of service provisioning and resource sharing, packet scheduling plays a key role in wireless d a ta networks. A scheduling scheme directly controls th e transm ission of m ultim edia payload and allocates th e radio resources

m ore efficiently as an effective radio resource m anagem ent technique. Scheduling schemes can help achieve the objective of higher forw ard link d a ta th ro u g h p u t while m aintaining required QoS a t th e same tim e. Scheduling algorithm s are im p o rtan t com ponents in the provision of guaranteed quality of service param eters such as delay, delay jitte r, packet loss rate, or th roughput. T he design of scheduling algorithm s for mobile com m unication n et works is especially challenging given th e highly variable link error rates and link capacities [12]. A scheduler operates across different sessions (connections or flows) in order to ensure th a t reserved th ro u g h p u t and bounds on delays and loss rates are m et. T he basic function of scheduling algorithm is to select th e session whose packet is to be tran sm itted next which is th e m ain focus of our research work. M ost of the d a ta trafflc is non real-tim e in n atu re b u t requires high transm ission ac curacy. T he transm ission delay requirem ent depends on each p articu lar d a ta application. O n th e other hand, voice and video arc real-tim e trafflc and have stric t transm ission delay requirem ents. However, they can to lerate a certain degree of transm ission errors. Scheduling scheme plays a prom inent role in non real-tim e applications th a t can tolerate delay since it can provide high d a ta th ro u g h p u t while m aintaining th e high transm ission quality. For m ultim edia services, the resource dem and in th e reverse link and forward link are generally n o t th e same and are tim e-varying. A m uch higher forw ard r?+e is required from th e access point (base station) th a n th a t generated by the access term inal (mobile term inal) in th e reverse link in current wireless d a ta networks. In this thesis, we consider forward link only.

In order to su p p o rt high d a ta ra te packet services w ith im pending explosion of high speed wireless d a ta com m unications in th ird generation (3G) systems, th e scarce and lim ited wire less resources m ust be efficiently used. Am ong th e existing conventional scheduling schemes, channel-based only (CBO), round robin (RR) and random scheduling (RS), R R is an abso lutely fair scheduling scheme since each user will get the same chance to transm it; CBO is

definitely u nfair scheduling scheme since the user w ith the best channel quality is scheduled always. A resource allocation scheme which is based only on th e best channel quality can m axim ize th e system capacity, b u t is unfair to the users w ith adverse channel conditions. CBO utilized system resources efficiently b u t neglected th e fairness for individual users. All of th e above scheduling schemes do not consider fairness and system efficiency together. However, it is n o t easy to m eet all of these requirem ents. T h a t is, there is a trad e off between m axim izing spectral efficiency and m eeting individual user's diverse need. A fter studying th e existing conventional scheduling techniques and identifying areas for p o te n tia l research, we focused our research on 1. developing a fair (in term s of achieving equal individual th ro u g h p u t over some tim e) scheduling scheme th a t also takes real-tim e channel conditions into account in th e dow nlink of a cellular CDM A system th a t supports slotted transm ission. 2. Investigating th e relative perform ance of th e developed scheme w ith conventional ab solutely fair scheme (i.e.,round robin) and absolutely unfair scheme (i.e., channel based only).

T he rest of th e thesis is organized as follows. In the next chapter, we discuss mobile commu nication system w ith em phasis on direct sequence spread spectrum communication system. Also briefly discussed are packet transm ission and quality of service. In C hapter 3, the ex isting packet scheduling schemes are characterized and discussed in detail. Some examples are given to com pare the perform ance among these scheduling algorithm s. A fair packet scheduling scheme th a t take b o th channel conditions and delivered throughput into account is proposed in C hapter 4. The definition of fairness is given firstly, then approaches to im prove fairness are discussed w ith the analysis of m ean of system throughput and variance of individual throughput. Effectiveness of the fair packet scheduling scheme is verified by sim ulation in C hapter 5. M any perform ance m easures such as , degree of fairness , through put (both system and individual) and frequency of scheduling are evaluated there.

Mobile com m unication era was born in the 1970s w ith th e developm ent of highly reliable, m iniature, solid-state radio frequency hardware. The recent exponential growth in cellular radio and personal com m unication systems throughout the world is directly a ttrib u tab le to new technologies of the 1970s, which are m ature today [1]. The future growth of mobile an d p ortable com m unication systems will be tied more closely to radio spectrum allocations an d regulatory decisions which affect or support new services, as well as to technology ad vances in signal processing, m ultiple access, and networking. Mobile com m unication systems are broadly divided into the first (IG ), second (2 0 ), and th ird generations (3 0 ), based on w hether th e system is analog or digital, and they provide voice or m ultim edia services. Fig. 2.1 sum m arizes the tim e fram e around when each appeared on the m arket or is expected to ap p ear in th e case of fourth generation (4 0 ) system. The first generation of mobile system has already been phased out, and th e second generation of mobile system has been in op eration now for some 10 years and is expected to be replaced by or to be evolved into the third-generation systems, which are presently being rolled out. In this chapter, we briefly discuss some basic concepts involved in the mobile communi cation.

A general trend can be observed in the utilized multiple-access scheme: from frequency division m ultiple access (FDM A) to tim e division multiple access (TDMA) and code division m ultiple access (CDMA) as tim e progresses. FDM A, TDM A and CDMA are mainly utilized in 1 0 , 2 0 and 3 0 respectively. 1 0 systems based on FDMA are prim arily analog systems, such as AM PS, and 2 0 systems are digital. Fig. 2.2 [1] illustrates th e difference between these three access technologies. In FDM A systems, a user is assigned an individual frequency band over which it transm its the inform ation and keeps it for the duration of the connection. In TDM A systems, a frequency band is shared between several users, who in turn use the channel for transm ission (or reception) of inform ation at well defined tim e intervals. In CDMA system s, m any users use the same frequency band all the time, and each user is distinguished at the transm itter/receiver by a unique spreading code.

Figure 2.2: FDMA versus TDMA versus CDMA (A ) F r eq u en cy D iv isio n M u ltip le A c ce ss ( F D M A ) FD M A system formed the basis for the first widely deployed public cellular systems in N orth America. In particular, the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) developed prim arily by A T& T Inc., was initially deployed in N orth America. This system was deployed in the 800 MHz band using 30 kHz channel spacing th a t still exists. ETACS (European Total Access C om m unication System) was deployed in Europe, with th e slight difference from AMPS in th a t the channel spacing was 25 kHz. Similarly, N-AMPS (Narrowband AMPS) was

developed by M otorola to work w ithin a 10 kHz channel spacing, thus increasing the original A M PS capacity [3]. These initial FDM A systems are norm ally referred to as first-generation cellular systems. FD M A system s generally operate w ith a base station in each cell w ith a cluster of cells in coverage area occupying a separate frequency in b o th the tran sm it and receive bands. The spectrum allocation for an FDM A system is given in Fig. 2.3. FDM A systems have inherent capacity lim itations due to the fact th a t each frequency channel can be allocated to only one user. In addition, due to the lim itation of the frequency reuse factor in a given deployment, co-channel interference is also an issue.

Figure 2.3: Frequency Allocation in FDMA (B ) T im e D iv is io n M u ltip le A ccess ( T D M A ) The development of the first digital cellular systems is based on TDMA. The 30 kHz channel TDM A system known as US Digital Cellular (USDC) or Digital AMPS (D-AMPS) was developed in the late 1980s. Also in the 1980s, th e Group Special Mobile (GSM) in Europe developed a digital TDM A standard to work w ithin 200 kHz channels. The first GSM

deployments were in 1991, and the first D-AMPS deployments in N orth America were in C anada by CANTED in .1992 [1]. These TDM A systems are also grouped under a general classification for initial digital cellular technologies known as second generation. TDM A cellular systems utilize the spectrum in a similar m anner to FDM A systems, w ith each base station in a cell occupying a distinct frequency for transmission and reception. However, each of the two frequency bands is also allocated in tim e to each user in a roundrobin fashion. For example, 3-slot TDM A divides the transmission into three fixed time periods (slots), each of equal duration, w ith a particular slot assigned for transmission to (or from, in the case uplink) one of three possible users. Fig. 2.4 shows the slot allocation in TDM A system. TDM A system also has capacity lim itations which results from the fact th a t the num ber of users on any single frequency is restricted by the num ber of available tim e slots. This type of approach requires tight synchronization between the mobile station and base station.

Figure 2 . 4 : Slot Allocation for 3-slot TDMA (C ) C od e D iv is io n M u ltip le A c ce ss (C D M A ) CDMA is a m ultiple access technology whereby each user is assigned a unique and high frequency code. In a CDMA system, frequency reuse lim itations seen in FDM A and TDMA systems are not quite so critical, as m ultiple mobile stations and base stations can occupy the same frequencies a t once and interference suppression is achieved by spreading the signal. CDMA system has been considered as an attractive alternative to the existing FDM A technologies and TDM A systems th a t have been in use during the last two decades. In FDMA and TDM A systems, mobiles can not seemingly roam from one base statio n to another base station since the neighboring base station uses different frequency spectrum to avoid co channel interference. In such systems, a group of channels is reused sufficient distance ap art which is defined by the frequency reuse factor; which places a practical lim it on the minimum num ber of neighboring base stations th a t may use same frequencies. CDMA, on the band, can avoid this type of problem due to the fact th a t all base stations w ithin a network can use th e same frequency and any interference th a t one CDMA base statio n imposed on another can be suppressed by spreading the signal. The another advantage of CDMA system is to use soft handoff, which entails the mobile being in sim ultaneous com m unication with more th a n one base station. Once the mobile roams from one base station to another, there is no need to suspend comm unication with either i ase statio n in the process. This feature also leads to some diversity benefits and potentially lowers th e probability of dropped calls as a result of mobility.

in th e early 1990s, culm inating w ith the standardization of Qualcomm's CDMA solution by the Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA) in 1992 [2]. More recently, CDMA has formed the basis for enhancing cellular systems around the world. T hird generation systems are developed to improve wireless m ultim edia services to cellular subscribers. Three prim ary technologies were approved in 1998 by the ITU as th ird generation technologies [3]: 1. W ideband CDMA, developed by the European Telecommunication Standardization Institu te (ETSI). 2. CDMA2000, developed by TIA. which is backward-compatible to IS-95. 3. ED G E (Enhanced D ata rates for GSM Evolution) which was co-sponsored by ETSI and TIA. We consider CDMA system in our research work since CDMA has become the most attractive m ultiple access technology in 3G and future mobile communication systems.

Spread S p ectru m C o m m u n ica tio n S y ste m

Since the late 1940s, spread spectrum technology has been used for m ilitary applications. A spread spectrum system operates by transform ing the narrow band inform ation of an individual user into w ideband inform ation by using high frequency codes, each unique for th a t particular user. Spread spectrum system has the following two criteria [3]: 1. The transm ission bandw idth is much greater th an the bandw idth (or rate) of the inform ation being sent. 2. The signal energy is spread on a very wide bandw idth, transm its the expanded sig nal, and then, a t the receiver, despreads the expanded signal back into the original bandw idth.

Spread spectrum techniques provide an excellent im m unity to m u ltip ath interference and robust m ultiple access capability. It allows transm ission to be hidden w ithin background noise. Spread spectrum technologies are very bandw idth efficient in a m ultiple environment. There are two m ost widely used approaches to im plem ent spread spectrum systems: fre quency hopped spread spectrum and direct sequence spread spectrum . For completeness, we discuss b oth of these approaches next though direct sequence spread spectrum is considered in our work. (A ) D ir e c t S eq u en ce Sp read S p ec tr u m (D S S S ) D irect sequence spread spectrum systems form th e basis for the m ost widely used CDMA standards for public wireless systems today. In DSSS, th e carrier is m odulated by a digital code also known as pseudo-random (PN) code in which the code bit rate is much larger than the inform ation signal b it rate. DSSS system is a w ideband system in which the entire bandw idth of the system is available to each user. A system is defined as a DSSS system if it satisfies the following requirem ent [5]: 1. T he spreading signal has a bandw idth much larger th a n the minimum bandw idth required to tran sm it the desired inform ation. 2. T he spreading of the d a ta is perform ed by means of a spreading signal, often called a code signal. The code signal is independent of the d a ta and of a much higher rate th a n the d a ta signal. 3. A t the receiver, despreading is accomplished by the cross-correlation of the received spread signal w ith a synchronized replica of the sam e signal used to spread the data. Fig. 2.5 shows the direct sequence spread spectrum approach, where is chip tim e

CDMA using frequency hopping involves a user tran sm ittin g over m ultiple frequencies con secutively in tim e in a pseudo random m anner. Pseudo random in this case refers to the fact th a t the sequence of transm ission frequencies is known a t the tran sm itter and receiver, bu t appears random to any other receiver. An example of a frequency hopping sequence is given in Fig.2.6. FHSS can be a fast-hop or a slow-hop system. Slow-hopping systems involve changing of frequencies a t a slower rate th a n the inform ation b it rate, where fast-hopping requires much faster change of the transm ission frequency th an the inform ation bit rate. Frequency hopped systems are lim ited by the to ta l num ber of hopping frequencies available. If two users hop to the sam e frequency at once, they will interfere w ith one another.

tion. This effect is called duplexing and is generally required in wireless telephone systems. D uplexing m ay be done using frequency or tim e domain techniques. Frequency division duplexing (FDD) provides two distinct bands of frequencies for every user. In FD D , any duplex channel actually consists of two sim plex channels, and a device called a duplexer is used inside each subscriber u n it and base statio n , to allow sim ultaneous radio transm ission and reception on th e duplex channel pair as shown in Fig. 2.7. The frequency sp lit between the forward and reverse channel is constant th roughout the system, regardless of th e particular channel being used. 18-95 and W CDM A are exam ples of CDMAFD D system s. Tim e division duplexing (TDD) uses tim e instead of frequency to provide b o th a forward and reverse link which is shown in Fig. 2.8. TD D system s accomplish two-way communi cation by allowing each user to com m unicate over the same frequency b an d by alternately tra n sm ittin g and receiving. This is accomplished by sharing the channel between the uplink an d downlink transm issions by way of allocating certain tim es for each transm ission and

In a wireless com m unication system , a signal can travel from tra n s m itte r to receiver over m ultiple reflective paths; this phenom enon is referred to as m u ltip a th propagation.

For the mobile radio application, the m ean p a th loss, Lp(d), as a function of distance, d, between the tra n sm itte r and receiver is proportional to an reference distance do [4]. oc ( 4 ) " Lp{d) is often stated in decibels, as shown below. {in dB).

tran sm itter. Sm all scale fading m anifests itself in two mechanisms, tim e-spreading of the signal and tim e-variant behavior of the channel due to m otion. For mobile radio applications, th e channel is tim e-variant because m otion between the tra n sm itte r and receiver results in propagation p a th changes. Small-scale fading is often modeled using R ayleigh fading because if th e m ultiple reflective p ath s are large in num ber and there is no line-of-sight signal com ponent, the envelop of the received signal is statistically described by a Rayleigh probability d istribution function [4]. W hen there is a dom inating non-fading signal com ponent present, such as a line-ofsight propagation p a th , the sm all scale fading envelope is described by a Rician probability distribution function.

T he forw ard link provides trafflc from the base statio n to the mobile term inal. There are four types of channels originating from th e base statio n (BS) to mobile statio n (MS) in a CDM A forward link: pilot, synchronization, paging and traffic channels. T he pilot channel provides MS w ith a beacon, tim ing an d phase reference (for coherent detection), and signal stren g th for power control [5]. Synchronization channel provides MS w ith critical tim e synchronization d ata. P aging channel contains messages w ith param eters th a t MS needs for access and

paging. T h e messages convey system param eters, access param eters, neighbor list, mobile directed paging messages, m obile directed orders, and channel assignm ent inform ation to MS an d it is used to com m unicate w ith MS when th ere is no call in progress. T he forward traffic channel is a variable ra te channel capable of carrying message d a ta and control d ata. BS m ultiplexes MS directed message into forward traffic channel frames. We consider forward link transm ission in our work.

T he reverse link provides traffic from th e mobile term inal to the base station. There are two types of channels originating from MS in CDMA reverse link: access and traffic channel. T he access channel is used to carry MS responses to commands from BS and call origination requests. MS com m unicates w ith BS when there is no reverse link channel by using an access channel. T he reverse traffic channel is a variable rate channel capable of carrying message d a ta and control data. BS multiplexes MS directed message into the reverse traffic channel frame.

P o w er A llo c a tio n a n d C o n tro l
Power control (or power allocation) is very im p o rtan t in CDMA systems. Power allocation is required in the forward links whereas power control is needed in th e reverse link. Forward link can also be power controlled in 3G systems. Power control (or power allocation) is th e adjustm ent of the tran sm itted power level of th e MS (or BS). The system lim its both forward link and reverse link traffic channel comm unication to the minim um tran sm itter power required for the receiving device to accurately retrieve th e message. This reduces the am ount of interference th a t a traffic channel imposes on other channels. Forward link power allocation is facilitated by th e cell site minimizing its tran sm it power by evaluating signal quality messages from the mobiles. In a cellular CDMA system, the to ta l tran sm ittin g power from the tran sm itter is shared by the to ta l mobile term inals which achieve transm ission in system. The active mobile

term inal is allocated a tran sm ittin g power level by BS, and the am ount of allocated power is proportional to its required signal quality and required tran sm ittin g rate. The allocated power of each active user is also related to individual link gain among others such as QoS requirem ent. Base station will increase the allocated tran sm it power to the mobile term inal along w ith th e increase of the distance between th e mobile and its home base station. The m obile term inal w ith higher required signal quality and higher required transm ission rate achieves higher allocated power level.

S ch ed u lin g and Q u ality o f S ervice in W ireless N e t w orks

Being one of the m ost im portant com ponents of quality of service provisioning and resource sharing, packet scheduling plays a key role in wireless d a ta networks. Packet transmission over wireless links takes into account the bursty n atu re of d a ta traffic [15]. A high-speed CDMA cellular packet system is needed to support m ulti-m edia internet access services. The packet d a ta service is different from voice service which needs tig h t delay bound and constant d ata ra te a t talk sp u rt [13]. R ather th a n supporting constant d a ta rate, th e scheduled packet d ata service serves the user of good channel condition with high d a ta rate. Here, we describe a packet transm ission system using an example. Fig. 2.9 [6] shows the downlink packet transm ission from an access point [6]. The pilot bursts provide the mobile term inals w ith m eans to accurately and rapidly estim ate the channel conditions. Among other param eters, the mobile term inals estim ates the received SIR. T he value of the SIR is then m apped to a value representing the m axim um d a ta rate th a t th e predicted SIR can support while m aintaining a given fram e error rate. T he channel condition in the form of a d ata ra te request is then fed back to the access point via the reverse link d a ta rate request channel and u p d ate as fast as every 1.67 ms. T he mobile term inal chooses the receivable highest d a ta rate. The chosen d a ta rate inform ation is tran sm itted by th e access term inal through a d a ta ra te control channel to th e access point during each tim e slot. The access point m anages th e d a ta rate control channels received from access term inals, and determines the order of access term inals to which forward link traffic d a ta is to be tran sm itted . Q uality of Service (QoS) in wireless networks refers to the ability of th e wireless network traffic to request and receive predictable service levels in term s of d a ta th ro u g h p u t capacity (bandw idth), latency variations (jitter), delay, packet loss and error, call dropping, and fairness [17]. In particular, QoS features provide b etter and m ore predictable network service by th e following m ethods; 1. su p porting dedicated bandw idth for individual connection

In wireless com m unication systems more atten tio n has been paid to high speed d ata tran s mission since more users dem and d a ta services recently th an voice services. There has been increasing dem and for high d a ta transm ission services w ith the explosive growth of traffic from the Internet and E-mail servers etc. th a t are accessing wireless networks. To sup p o rt these high d a ta rate services, the lim ited wireless resources m ust be utilized efficiently. Among radio resource m anagem ent techniques, scheduling algorithm has attracted increased attention because it directly controls th e transm ission of d a ta [12]. Scheduling schemes play a key role in achieving th e objective of higher forward link d a ta th roughput while m aintaining required quality of service (QoS) a t th e same tim e. Among th e downlink scheduling algorithm s, channel-based only [7] and round robin [9] are two prim itive scheduling approaches. In recent development in scheduling scheme [8] and [18], th e rate allocated to each mobile term inal varies discretely and depends on each mobile te rm in a l's m easured SIR. A scheduler a t base station determ ines the next term inal to be served based on the reported d a ta rate requests from the term inals and the am ount of d a ta th a t has already been transm itted to each term inal. The proposals in [11] and in [19] perm it the adjustm ent of requested rate per mobile term inal based on th e real-time channel quality.

Channel-based only scheduling scheme considers the real tim e channel quality of each mobile term inal in the scheduling of packets. In [7] maximum system throughput is achieved a t the expense of fairness, because a single user with the best channel conditon can be allocated all the resources. We define Sj{n) as the scheduled user by base station j w ith the best channel quality at slot n .
Sj{n) = arg max[Gjy(?r)j, 0 < i < M, 0 < n < N, (i,n ) G / ,

(3.1)

where M is to ta l user number, N is to tal slot number, j is index of home base station, I is a positive integer set, G √ø is the link gain between user i and its home base station j. If the link condition is stronger for user i for a longer time, user i will be transm itted for a longer tim e. If the link condition is worse, then the mobile term inal is delayed for some tim e duration till the channel conditions improve. A n E xam p le: N u m e r ic a l R e su lts We use a num erical example in the following to explain how CBO scheduling scheme works. We assume a cellular CDMA system w ith two cells, and one base station is located in the center of each cell. Each radio channel suffers propagation loss with an attenuation coefficient of a = 2, and neither m ultipath propagation nor shadowing is considered in this example. T he system model is graphically shown in Fig. 3.1. We assume there are only two users which are located in the coverage area of cell A, and base statio n a (BSa) is the home base station of both users. User 1 is located at the distance dia = 300 m eters away from BSa and dib = 800 m eters away from base station b (BSb). User 2 is located at the distance d 2 a = 700 meters away from BSa and dgt = 1600 m eters away from BSb. Base station b (BSb) is the home base station of neighbor cell B. Therefore, we have link gains between users and their home base station in slot 1 with no

In base statio n a , the user which has the m axim um link gain a t each slot is scheduled. Since G ia (l) > G2a (l), user 1 is scheduled. In the downlink uncoordinated base stations scenario, scheduling has potential quality degradation problems near the boundaries due to increased interference a t high speed tran s mission as noted in [20]. We can improve this situation through a simple m ethod. A typical consideration is to serve by two low power base stations th a t are coordinated to avoid po tential quality degradation, i.e., only one user is scheduled in each slot, then the interference from intra-cell users or even from neighboring cell users will be decreased tremendously. Next, we will explain how CBO scheduling scheme affects individual throughput and system average throughput using the transm ission rate allocation. Here, we also continue to

use the previous example. Firstly, we will define the average throughput of cellular CDMA system. , Average Throughput = Total Transmission Bits

We also define the system average throughput th at equals the sum of individual user average throughput: System Average T hroughput = ^ Individual Average Throughput (3.3)

In this numerical example, the locations of two users will not be changed during schedul ing duration (with no consideration of shadowing or fading). Let us assume th a t each base station uses transm ission power of P and only one user is scheduled in each slot. The trans mission rate of user i is denoted as Ri. The required signal quality of two users are equal and Eb/No ~ = 10. The CDMA system bandw idth of W = 1.25 x 10"^ MHz. We as

sume 10 slots duration, two users are waiting for being scheduled, and user 1 has link gain Gia -- 10" ¬Æfrom base station a, user 2 has link gain Cgg, = 0.2 x 10" ¬Æfrom base statio n a, and Gia > G 2 a- Now we calculate the link gain from neighboring base station h.

"d f; " 8002 "
A Since the CBO scheduler selects the user which has the best channel condition, the user 1 is scheduled during 10 slots and user 2 is blocked during th a t time. Therefore, the transm ission rate of user 2 is R 2 =0. Next we will com pute the transmission ra te of the scheduled user 1. In CBO scheme, the transm ission rate is calculated under th e assum ption th a t the signal quality is satisfied. Eb/N'o of user i which is denoted as 7 j- in two cell system can be expressed as :

Hence, we get the expression of Ri on th e condition th a t the signal quality is satisfied and calculate R i.

F igu re 3.2: Two Users are Scheduled During 10 Slot Duration.

T he average throughput of user i is denoted as R * . The average th roughput of two users during 10 slots are R \ = 780 kbps and T Z g = 0. T he system average throughput R* + = 780 kbps

We find th a t the system average throughput equals the scheduled user average throughput since the scheduled user keeps transm itting, and th e other users are blocked (or delayed) always. It is a kind of unfair situation since the entire system resources are allocated to only one user. CBO scheduling scheme has good signal quality and can achieve high system average th ro u g h p u t since th e channel quality is th e only consideration. T he fairness is neglected here, because the user with the best channel condition will keep tran sm ittin g during the entire scheduling period if there is no shadowing or fading.

In each slot only one user is selected to be scheduled. We assume for each run, the to ta l sim ulation duration lasts 100 tim e slots and Tg is th e length of a slot, {Tg = 1.67 ms). We calculate average SIR separately for RS and CBO scheduling scheme after 20 runs. The results are shown in Table 3.1 for cell A and B separately. From th e sim ulation results, we can find th a t CBO scheduling scheme improves the signal quality com pared to RS scheduling scheme since the scheduler in CBO scheme selects the mobile term inal which has th e best channel condition while RS scheme selects th e mobile term inal random ly in each tim e slot. The sim ulation results for the system (i.e, cell A and B )are also plotted in Fig. 3.3 for 20 runs. We can find th a t CBO scheduling scheme improves SIR by almost 15 dB compared to RS scheduling scheme. RS is a fair scheduling scheme since the scheduler random ly selects the user to be tran s m itted. RS has low average transm ission rate and worse signal quality com pared to CBO, b u t it is easy to be im plem ented since it need not do the complex operation.

R R is an absolute fairness scheduling scheme since each user gets sam e chances to tra n s m it. R R does not consider th e channel quality, so th e average transm ission ra te is low and signal quality is worse th a n in CBO.

where T is the window size constant. The scheduler updates the average transm ission rate R ^ (n + 1) in each slot for each mobile on the basis of th e achieved average ra te and the transm ission ra te in slot n, then assigns d a ta flow to the mobile th a t has the highest scheduler value on each decision slot. If the mobile is chosen in slot n, th e achieved average transm ission rate + 1) for the chosen mobile increases since the chosen mobile keeps tran sm ittin g

Providing fair share of system throughput among the different d a ta users is one of the key issues in provisioning quality of service (QoS) in wireless d a ta networks. In this chapter, we propose a scheduling scheme th a t attem p ts to provide fair d ata throughput and high system average th ro ughput based on th e channel condition, achieved average rate and required rate w ith the assistance of individual mobile term inal. This scheme is called as C B + M A + FS since it is channel-based, mobile-assisted and fairly-shared scheduling scheme. The fairness is achieved by using a scheduling algorithm to allocate radio resources among the mobile term inals in proportion to the combined consideration of real tim e channel con dition, required transm ission rate and achieved average rate in the proposed scheduling scheme.

Therefore, stan d ard deviation of X can evaluate th e distribution degree of X . In our proposed fair scheduling scheme, we define degree of fairness Fk as the reciprocal of standard deviation of individual throughput tim es J in scheduling scheme k which is expressed in (4.3).

CBO provides m axim um system throughput a t the expense of fairness, because all resources can be allocated to a single user w ith the best channel condition and the other users have to be blocked (or delayed). However, the price paid for the high system throughput is potentially evident (as seen in Section 5) in large variations of individual a'^erage throughput among the mobile term inal population. The round robin scheduler cycles through the list of active users and thus is fair in sharing resources. However, as it does not take the channel quality into account it is suffering in both system throughput loss and the deprived signal quality. Therefore, in general, there is a trade-off between the fairness and the system throughput in designing a scheduler. Hence, scheduling algorithm s should preferably take channel quality into account and at the same time, introduce some degree of fairness.

4.2

P r o p o se d A lg o rith m

We propose a simple scheduling scheme th a t takes into account the channel conditions with the assistance of mobile term inals for fair sharing of transmission throughput. Hence we call it channel-based mobile-assisted fairly-shared (CB-hMA-hFS) scheduling scheme. T he m ajo r consideration for any packet scheduling scheme in wireless networks is to delay or block the mobile term inals th a t costs th e most system resources so th a t the system resource can be released to serve other mobile term inals w ith b etter link conditions. We also follow the same philosophy in our approach. Hence, the CB4-MA4-FS scheme is applicable for non-real tim e applications. T he CB 4 -M A 4 -FS scheduler updates the achieved average rate at each tim e slot for each mobile term inal, then computes the priority factor which is a new param eter introduced in our proposed scheduling scheme for each mobile term inal based on the achieved average rate; finally, it selects the mobile term inal to be scheduled which has the maximum value of the

P r io r ity F actor

In order to take the related param eters of m ultirate services into account in the scheduling, a new param eter hi, denoted as priority factor, is introduced in our proposed scheduling scheme which will affect the scheduling indicator and help the scheduler to make the decision as to which mobile term inal will be scheduled at next slot. T he m ain idea here is th a t each mobile term inal has an adjustable priority factor at each slot depending on its achieved average rate so far and required transm ission rate. O ur strategy is based on the combined adaptive tradeoff between priority factor and

achieved average rate R l{ n -- 1) in specific tim e slot n for user i. Therefore, we use a linear m athem atical model between priority factor hi and achieved average ra te i?* as illustrated

So, we get a modified figure in Fig. 4.2 for the combined adaptive tradeoff between priority factor and achieved average rate, and a linear m athem atical relationship among these param eters is given in (4.8).

It can be seen th a t the L is a tolerant factor a t various achieved throughput levels. In our proposed scheduling model, the base statio n adjusts th e priority factor of each mobile term inal depending on the achieved average rate R*{n) in a given slot. The higher the achieved throughput in relation to the required rate, the sm aller th e priority factor. It m eans th a t th e mobile term inal which has the high achieved average rate in given slot will get low priority in the next slot. A N u m e r ic a l E x a m p le We give an exam ple to show how the combined tradeoff between priority factor and achieved average rate works.

In our proposed CB-fMA-f-FS scheme, th e link gain is not th e only factor used to decide which m obile term inal will be scheduled. We consider the combined effect of priority and channel condition together. T he m obile term inal which has the best channel conditon can not be scheduled always. Because, along w ith the increase in the achieved average throughput of individual user, the priority value will be decreased; so the mobile term inal which has th e m axim um link gain will be blocked a t specific slot after tran sm ittin g for some tim e. T hen, th e o th er user who has relatively large p roduct of priority value and link gain will be scheduled in the next slots. Therefore, in each slot, th e mobile term inal which has higher priority an d relatively b e tte r channel condition (m aybe the best, m aybe not th e best) will be scheduled. So, we can expect th a t > 1, V n , z. (4.22)

In R R scheduling scheme, th e scheduler cycles through the list of active mobile term inals in a fair m anner and it does not consider th e channel quality. It m eans th a t R R schedules th e m obile term in al no m a tte r w hat kind of channel condition it has a t a specific slot.

Since SD(Rii^) is proportional to Bk value, and it is increased along w ith the increase of Bk value, an d vice versa, we analyze the value of Bk in four scheduling schemes. For the analysis, we assume the channel conditions are all distance-dependent only, and in each slot only one user is scheduled for one base station. In CBO, the user w ith the best channel quality is always scheduled and the other users are always blocked during the scheduling; hence, = 0, 0<

where s is th e index of the scheduled user. Therefore, Bk in CBO is expressed as, B cbo = (1 -- -j^) X {Tc b o Y (4.36)

From the previous analysis about system throughput in section 4.3.1, we already know th a t T cbo > T c b +m a +f s > T r r ^ rs Since CBO has the best system throughput T c b o and the reduction item (4.37) R*kRjk

= 0, we can expect th a t CBO has m axim um stan d ard variance of individual throughput am ong these four scheduling schemes . In CB-kMA-l-FS and RS schemes, some users are scheduled, th e others are not. It means th a t some users get R*k = 0. We will get some com ponent of ( % x Rjk) equal to 0. And th e sum of these products will be sm aller th an RR. Since CB-I-MA4-FS has higher system th ro u g h p u t th a n R R and RS, and the reduction item in th e variance of throughput in CB-t-M A-fFS is sm aller th a n R R, CB-fMA-I-FS has larger stan d ard variance of individual th ro u g h p u t th a n R R and RS. C om paring with R R and RS, if the scheduling duration is short, then th e reduction item in variance of RS is sm aller th a n RR, so RS will have larger stan d ard deviation th an RR. B u t if the scheduling duration is long enough, then RS and R R will have same scheduling situation, so the stan d ard deviation of individual th ro u g h p u t in RS and R R is almost equal. Finally, we can conclude th a t CBO has the m axim um stan d ard deviation of individual th ro u g h p u t, CB-kMA-t-FS has relatively large stan d ard deviation of individual throughput.

S y s te m T o lera n ce F actor - L

In our linear priority control model, a param eter L was introduced (see Fig. 4.2). It is system -dependent and determ ines how tolerant th e system is with respect to the achieved average ra te in relation to required rate. L controls not only the maximum range of average th roughput being achieved from m ultirate users a t any tim e instant bu t also im pacts the priority factor in the adjustm ent in each slot. System average throughput is also affected finally by L, since th e m aximum average throughput achieved by the individual user is decided by L. Let us analyze how the value of L determ ines the maximum achieved average throughput of each user. System dependent param eter L is an positive constant ( L > 0 ). From Fig. 4.2, we find th a t the intersection point in th e X axis is the m axim um average rate achieved during a long tim e by each mobile term inal i in slot n which equals to the product of L and individual required rate. T h a t is, max[jZ*(7i)] = L X 0 < z < M, 0 < TV , (i, M ) E 7. (4.41)

It m eans th a t th e average throughput achieved by individual user so far in each slot can not be larger th a n the m axim um value since along w ith the increase of achieved average rate

49

of the scheduled mobile term inal, the priority factor value will be decreased, when average throughput achieves its m aximum value, the priority equals 0 (see (4.8)). In fact, before the average throughput achieves its allowable m aximum value, priority factor has already been decreased to a smaller value. Therefore, the scheduled mobile term inal %will be blocked in slot (n + 1) because it may have relatively smaller scheduler value. B ut, in slot (n + 2), R l{n +
2)

will be decreased because of being blocked in slot (n +

1 ),

then it achieves a

increased priority value, and th e priority value will keep increasing if user i keeps blocked (or delayed) in the consecutive slots, until it is scheduled again. This is how our scheduling mechanism works. From the above discussion, we can note th a t the system -dependent param eter L is sensi tive to the scheduling system since it decides the m axim um average throughput achieved by the individual user, or in other words, it decides the longest duration of being scheduled for each mobile term inal. Because, higher m aximum achieved average throughput means longer scheduling duration for the current scheduled mobile term inal. Therefore, L will finally affect th e fairness in our proposed scheduling scheme. We can note th a t, 1. The sm aller the L value, the fairer scheduling in term s of throughput, because L limits the m axim um allowable throughput. 2. If L value is very small {L ¬´ 0), Hi{n) -- -oo, Vf, as shown in Fig. 4.5, then the scheduling indicator Zij(n) = -oo, Vf , the scheduling scheme becomes the case of absolute fairness scheme (like R R or RS). 3. If L value is very large (L ^ 1), Hi{n) = 1, Vf, as shown in Fig. 4.6, then the schedul ing indicator Zij{n) = Gij{n), the scheduling scheme becomes th e case of absolute unfairness scheme (like CBO).

Next, we will analyze how the value of L affects th e step of priority factor being adjusted in each slot which is shown in Fig. 4.7. We set L as two values: L i and L-2 , let L \ < Tg. We

and H will be adjusted evidently if L is set to a

We know th a t the adjusting speed of H will affect the fairness

since it decides how long the individual mobile term inal will be scheduled before it achieves its m axim um achieved average throughput. Finally, we conclude th a t the larger (smaller) the L value is, the sm aller (larger) the adjusting step of H in each slot is, then the more fairer and quicker the scheduling scheme is.

S ig n a l Q u a lity - S IR

Signal to interference ratio - SIR is an im portant param eter to evaluate the system perfor mance. In a multicell CDMA system, if it is assumed th a t the base station j is the home base station of the mobile term inal i, and to ta l base station has equal transm ission power P , S I R i can be given as [4];

where Pi is th e tran sm itted power to the mobile term inal i from its home base station, Gij is th e link gain between user i and its home base station j. If only one user is scheduled in each slot and CDMA system is a two-cell system, S I R i in slot n can be expressed as: S I R ,( n ) = - f g i f f .-- = 0<i<M,0<n<N, (4.43)

where j is index of base station and j G [a, b]. In CBO, the scheduler always chooses the user w ith the maximum link gain in each slot, so Gia Gib or ^ 1. Therefore, CBO will achieve best signal quality in each slot.

In CB-hMA-bFS, th e scheduler selects the user based on the combined effect of channel condition and priority factor. So the channel condition of the scheduled user can not be always best and it is can not be worst too. We can expect th a t the channel condition being scheduled in each slot is relatively good. In R R and RS, the scheduler chooses the mobile term inal to be scheduled w ith no consid eration of channel quality, so it can be good or bad. We can expect th a t the channel of the scheduled user under consideration in each slot will be worse th an CB-bMA-t-FS and CBO. Finally, we can conclude th a t CBO has the best system signal quality during scheduling, CB-t-MA-t-FS has relative good system signal quality , SIRs in R R and RS are worse th an in CBO and CB-bMA-t-FS. We have the relationship about SIR below. S I R cbo > S I R c b m a f s > S I R r r ^ rs (4.44)

In this section we do a qualitative comparison of existing schemes w ith the proposed schedul ing scheme.

4 .4 .1

C o m p le x ity

T he schedulers of different scheduling schemes work through different operations, b u t they are unique in th a t only one mobile term inal is scheduled in each slot. In CBO, base statio n computes the channel quality of each mobile term inal, then selects the mobile term inal which has the best channel condition to be scheduled, and the other mobile term inals will be blocked. Base station always schedules the user w ith the best

channel condition and assigns the scheduled mobile term inal the current transm ission rate which is proportional to real-tim e link gain under the condition th a t th e signal quality is guaranteed. In the proposed CB4-MA-t-FS, the scheduler which is expressed in (4.12) computes the channel quality of each mobile term inal in each slot w ith the mobile term inal assistance, then calculates th e achieved average ra te of each mobile term inal. Then, the scheduler

com putes th e individual priority value. The scheduler in base statio n calculates the value of scheduling indicator based on link gain and priority factor, then selects th e mobile term inal to be tran sm itted which has the m axim um value of scheduling indicator. In each slot, the scheduler has to com pute and record the transm ission rate of each user which is used to calculate th e achieved average rate of each user. In RR, base statio n cycles through the list of active mobile term inals and does not consider th e real tim e channel condition. In RS, base statio n random ly selects the mobile term inal to be tran sm itted and does not consider th e real tim e channel condition. From th e above discussion, we know th a t the schedulers in R R and RS need not perform any calculation. T he scheduler in CBO operates with added complexity since it computes the real-tim e channel condition of each user, then compares and selects th e m axim um value in

54

each slot. From the expression of scheduler in C B + M A + FS , we can see how various factors are taken into account in determ ining who gets scheduled in each slot. T he operation of the scheduler in C B + M A + F S is m ost complex among these scheduling schemes since th e sched uler needs to calculate and record many param eters, such as, channel condition, achieved average rate, current transm ission rate and priority factor. In each slot, the scheduler has to compare the param eter value and select the user to be scheduled.

4 .4 .2

T h rou ghput

CBO can achieve the highest system th roughput since the scheduler always selects the mobile term inal w ith the best channel condition and assigns the highest transm ission rate to the scheduled user. The system average th roughput of C B + M A +FS is higher th an R R and RS because the scheduler in C B + M A + F S takes the channel condition into account although it is not only the factor to decide th e scheduling procedure while the schedulers in R R and RS choose the users w ith no consideration about channel condition (or quality of service).

4 .4 .3

F airn ess

Conventional channel-based scheduling scheme neglected fairness. T h a t is, the users with poor link quality are always blocked, and the users w ith good link quality are always selected to be transm itted. In our proposed C B + M A + FS , under the poor link conditions, the users may get chances to tran sm it w ith high priority which is a partial fairness. R R is an absolutely fair scheduling scheme since each user gets the same chance to transm it. RS is also an fair scheduling scheme. If we set to tal slots duration long enough, we can expect th a t R R and RS has same degree of fairness.

Average delay is the average w aiting tim e of a mobile term inal to receive the next transm is sion packet from the base station. In CBO, m ost users are delayed for the entire scheduling duration since the mobile

We assum e th a t m obile term inals are statio n ary during each run which equals full schedul ing du ratio n of 500 slots. It m eans th a t the channel condition of each mobile term inal will rem ain unchanged in distance-dependent only propagation m odel (i.e, no m u ltip ath fading) since the location of each mobile term inal is no t changed during a run. Therefore, th e mobile term in al w ith the best channel condition will be always scheduled during 500 slots. W hen we consider m u ltip a th fading in each slot, channel conditions become complex, and channel stre n g th of each user will be affected considerably regardless of th eir location. As a result, th e m obile term in al which is scheduled in slot n m ay not be scheduled in next slot (n -b 1 ) because of th e weakened channel quality caused by deep fading, or th e m obile term inal which

In the proposed scheduling scheme, a very im p o rtan t param eter - priority factor Hi was introduced. T he combined effect of priority factor and real-tim e channel quality determines which mobile term inal will be scheduled in each slot. Since Hi{n) is based on the achieved average ra te in slot n so far, the calculation of achieved average rate in each slot is neces sary. The transm ission ra te of th e scheduled user which is on the basis of real-tim e channel condition has to be recorded in each slot.

The scheduled user in R R by base station j at slot n can be expressed as Sj {n) under the assum ption th a t to ta l slot num ber and to ta l user num ber are same, g j(n ) = n, 0 < n < W, M = W, (5.7)

where M is to ta l num ber of user, N is to tal slot num ber, k G {CBO, RR, RS, C B + M A +FS}. T he characteristic of the system throughout is shown in Fig. 5.2 for the two cases of signal attenuation model: (a) distance-dependent only model and (b) distance-dependent combined w ith Rayleigh fading, for CBO, RR, RS, C B + M A +FS scheduling schemes. From Fig. 5.2, we confirm th a t CBO always has the m axim um system throughput among four scheduling schemes since the scheduler in CBO always selects the user which has the best channel condition in each slot. It achieves th e highest possible transmission rate in each slot. Hence, the sum of individual current transm ission rate will be maximum among four scheduling schemes. C B + M A + F S has a system throughput which is lower than th a t of CBO and higher th a n th a t of R R and RS. In C B + M A + FS , the real-tim e channel condition is not the only factor to affect scheduling, the achieved average ra te and required transmission rate are also considered there. It m eans th a t the scheduler will select the user which has relatively good channel condition and high priority factor. Therefore, the relatively high transm ission rate is achieved in each slot.

In R R and RS, the scheduler does not consider th e channel condition. Therefore, the system throughput shows the average situation of the channel conditions.

is decreased by almost 24% compared to distance-dependent only model which is much larger than the reduction percentage in CB-f-MAd-FS ( 5%), and is smaller than th a t in RS (54%) and R R (55%). Therefore, we can conclude th a t any fading model will affect CBO more evidently th a n the other three scheduling schemes since the channel condition is the only consideration in CBO. We also find th a t in distance-dependent only p ath loss condition, CBO has alm ost 10 tim es of th e system throughput in R R and RS and 3 times of the system throughput in CB-hMA-f-FS; in m ultipath fading condition, CBO has almost 15 times of the system throughput in R R and RS and 2 times of th e system throughput in CB-f-MA-f-FS. CBO pro vides efficient d a ta transm ission advantage in system throughput among these four schedul ing schemes. However, as we will see next, it has problem w ith fair allocation of individual throughput.

Because the fairness is an im portant improvement in our proposed scheduling scheme com pared to CBO as noted through analytical means in Section 4.3.2, we evaluate the fairness of CBO, RR, RS, CB-t-MA-bFS using standard deviation of individual throughput which was defined in Section 4.1.1. In Fig. 5.3, standard deviation of individual throughout for two propagation models using CBO, RR, RS, CB-pMA-l-FS scheduling schemes is shown. From th e figure, we can find th a t R R always has minimum standard deviation of in dividual average throughput since each mobile term inal gets the same priority level to be scheduled during sim ulation period. It means th a t each mobile term inal will have equal

RS is a p a rtia l fair scheduling scheme since the scheduler selects the mobile term inal to be scheduled random ly at each time slot. D uring a short scheduling period, some mobile term inals will get more chances to be scheduled and the others will get less. The frequency of scheduling for each user is shown in Fig. 5.6. In RS scheduling scheme, each user has different frequency of scheduling. However, if during a long scheduling period, all th e users will have alm ost equal chances to be scheduled as in RR. From Fig. 5.3, we find th a t RS has small stan d ard variance of individual th ro u g h p u t which is a little larger th an th a t of RR corresponding to our analysis in Section 4.3.2.

T able 5.3: Standard Deviation of Individual Throughput

th a t CBO has the worst fairness performance which has the m axim um standard deviation of individual throughput shown in Fig. 5.3. Therefore, we know th a t the average throughput of individual user is distributed dispersedly in CBO. C B + M A + F S has the larger standard deviation of throughput compared to RR and RS, b u t sm aller standard deviation th an th a t of CBO, since it considers the fairness into account. Therefore, the distribution of individual throughput in C B + M A + FS is relatively concentrated compared to CBO, and is relatively dispersed compared to R R and RS. In Table 5.3, the standard deviation values for different scheduling schemes for two prop agation models are recorded. We can confirm the below relationship among these four scheduling schemes for the stan dard deviation of individual throughput (or fairness) in both signal propagation conditions. This also confirms our analytical results discussed in Section 4.3.2.

In CBO scheme, m inority of mobile term inals which have the best channel conditions were scheduled while m ajority of mobile term inals could not be scheduled. Especially in distancedependent p a th loss only model, only

users are scheduled during the sim ulation period in

a two-cell system as shown in Fig. 5.4. CBO is a kind of absolute non-fairness scheduling since the mobile term inal w ith the best channel condition is always scheduled while the rest of th e mobile term inals are delayed. In m ultipath fading model, there are 9 more mobile term inals are scheduled during the sim ulation period as shown in Fig. 5.5, because th a t the individual channel condition may be changed in each slot because of Rayleigh fading. B ut m ost users are still not scheduled since we have a to tal of C B -f-M A -j-PS S ch ed u lin g S ch em e CB-f-MA-l-FS is the proposed scheduling scheme which considers b o th the channel con d itio n of each mobile term inal as well as fairness allocation of individual throughput . In CB-f-MA-fFS, there are much m ore users being scheduled in both signal propagation models as shown in Fig. 5.4 and Fig. 5.5 com pared to CBO. N ext we will discuss frequency of scheduling in CB-|-MA-t-FS in both signal attenuation models. D istance-dependent m odel: There are 21 more users scheduled in CB-t-MA-j-FS compared to CBO. We can find th a t each user has different frequency of scheduling and these frequency are in the range of 0 to 87 (see Fig. 5.4). It means th a t th e m axim um frequency of scheduling is 85 which is sm aller compared to 500 of CBO. We already know th a t the channel condition of distance-dependent only m odel is only related to the distance between th e mobile term inal and its home base station. T h a t is, if th e mobile term inal is very close to its base station, it h as the best channel quality which is a much larger m agnitude com pared to those of the o th e r mobile term inals since we use uniformly distributed to locate individual user in each cell. Therefore, when we schedule the users, the channel condition becomes the dom inant facto r to effect the scheduler although we introduce priority factor which is adjusted based on th e updated achieved average rate of each user in each slot. The value of scheduler is effected m ostly by th e channel condition. This is the reason th a t the m ost users can not

M ultipath fading m odel: There are 63 more users scheduled in CB-l-MA-l-FS compared to CBO, and individual frequency of scheduling is in the range of 0 to 52 (see Fig. 5.5). T h a t is, the difference of individual frequency of scheduling gets smaller, and the distribution of scheduling frequency gets more even. The fairness of scheduling in CB-f-MA-f-FS improves evidently since Rayleigh fading affects the channel condition and makes channel conditions m ore complex. The more complex the channel conditions are, the more active the scheduler is. In distance-dependent only model we already noted th a t the channel condition is the dom inant factor to affect the scheduler. Combined w ith Rayleigh fading, the channel condi tion becomes complex; for example, th e mobile term inal which is extrem ely close to its base statio n m ay undergo deep fading or th e mobile term inal which is far away from its home base statio n may achieve high channel gain. In our sim ulation, the channel condition (with Rayleigh fading) is varied in each tim e slot although their location is fixed. Therefore, the

If the radio resources are allocated to individual user efficiently, each user can achieve high average th ro u g h p u t, and vice versa. Therefore, in CDM A system s, the m ain task is to m aintain high system th ro u g h p u t while assigning relatively high individual th ro u g h p u t in order to obtain high QoS and utilize system resources efficiently.

System average throughput will be increased w ith L since th e larger the value of L, the larger the m axim um allowable achieved individual average th roughput allowed at any tim e; hence, the longer scheduling tim e for a user w ith the best channel condition, as a result, the higher system average throughput is achieved. 2. T he degree of fairness will be decreased w ith L since th e sm aller the value of L , the sm aller the m axim um allowable achieved individual average throughput; hence, faster the over-scheduled user is blocked, as a result, more users are scheduled and achieve high degree of fairness in using th e system resources. 3.

the scheduler is not so active, and

S IR

We estim ate th e SIR of the scheduled mobile term inals in each tim e slot during the sim ulation period and record them in ascending order, then, get the SIR distribution of scheduled individual for four scheduling schemes. Fig. 5.11 shows SIR distribution of CBO. In CBO, the scheduler always chooses the user w ith the m axim um link gain in each slot. Therefore, CBO will achieve maximum SIR in each slot. Pig. 5.12 shows SIR distribution of C B + M A + FS . We can find th a t the SIR in C B + M A + FS is higher com pared to R R and RS, b u t lower th a n th a t of CBO. In C B + M A +FS, the sched uler selects th e user based on th e combined effect of channel condition and priority factor. So th e channel condition of th e scheduled user can not be always best and it is can not be w orst too. This is the reason th a t C B + M A + F S has b etter signal quality th a n th a t of R R and RS, while it has worse signal quality th a n th a t of CBO.

Fig.

in RS and R R are relatively lower th an th a t of CBO and C B + M A +FS. In RR and RS, the scheduler chooses th e mobile term inal to be scheduled w ith no consideration of channel quality, so it can be good or bad.

T ab le 5.7: Overall Summary of Performance Measures in CBO, CB+MA+FS, RR, RS Scheduling Schemes.

Average SIR for four scheduling schemes is shown in Table 5.6. Finally, we can conclude th a t the SIR in distance-dependent only is b e tte r than the SIR in m u ltipath propagation because of the effect of fading; CBO has th e best system signal quality during sim ulation, C B + M A + FS has relative good system signal quality , SIRs in R R and RS are worse than in CBO and C B + M A + FS . We have the following relationship: S I R cbo > S I R c b m a f s > S I R rr ,r s Sim ulation results confirm this analytical observation. (5.13)

We finally ta b u la te our results for different scheduling schemes in Table 5.7. These results are based on sim ulation studies and also supported analytically. Therefore, we make the following conclusions.

80 C B + M A +FS provides more fair share of radio resources to individual users compared

to CBO for different high speed d a ta rate traffic. 2. In C B + M A +FS , frequency of scheduling for individual user is increased evidently compared to CBO. Therefore, more users get chances to transm it, and the number of users being blocked is reduced simultaneously. 3. C B + M A + FS achieves more even distribution of individual average throughput in term s of sm aller standard deviation of individual average throughput com pared to CBO. The difference between system average throughput and individual average through put is reduced evidently. T he requirements of individual mobile term inal are satisfied better, and the system resource is allocated in more fair m anner because the more flexible adjustm ent of the unevenness of throughput per mobile term inal is perm itted in C B + M A +FS compared to CBO. 4. C B + M A +FS improves signal quality evidently in term s of SIR compared to R R and RS. The scheduled user can obtain higher SIR a t each slot in C B + M A + FS than th a t in R R and RS, since the channel condition is one of the considered factors in C B +M A +FS. 5. Scheduler is sensitive to system tolerance factor L. Along with the decrease of L value, the m aximum allowable range of individual achieved average rate gets smaller, the scheduled period of individual user gets shorter, and more users are scheduled, finally degree of fairness is increased.

F uture w ibeband CDMA systems are required to efficiently utilize the lim ited radio spec tru m due to the rapidly growing dem ands for high d a ta rate services. Being one of the m ost im p o rtan t com ponents of quality of service provisioning and resource sharing, packet scheduling plays a key role in wireless d a ta networks. In our work, we have discussed the problem of resource sharing in mobile comm unication system . We discussed the existing conventional scheduling schemes in term s of scheduler operation, efficient spectral resources usage and degree of fairness. We proposed a fair packet scheduling algorithm to achieve fair individual throughput while m aintaining the relatively high system average throughput for high d a ta transm ission application in CDMA down link systems. We defined the fairness and introduced the priority factor to take fairness into account th a t was based on individual service requirem ents, and achieved throughput. We did an analysis about system throughput and stan d ard variance of individual throughput, and expounded the characteristic of system tolerance factor L which determ ines the tolerance of the scheduling system towards allocating additional d ata ra te com pared to the required ra te and affects the degree of fairness. We showed th a t the proposed algorithm achieves both good individual throughput and good system throughput. Finally, we com pared the perform ance between the proposed fair scheduling algorithm and the existing conventional scheduling schemes through sim ulation studies and confirmed

effectiveness of system resource allocation is improved while m aintaining the high efficiency of system resource utilization.

A lthough the application we considered in sim ulation and numerical examples focused on high d a ta packet transm ission, this algorithm can apply equally well to other m ultim edia transm ission services, such as voice and video. Voice and video are real-tim e traffic and thus have strict transm ission delay requirements. However, they can tolerate a certain degree of transm ission errors. On the other hand, d a ta traffic is non-real time in nature bu t requires high transm ission accuracy. T he transm ission delay requirem ent depends on each particular d a ta application. Hence, in the proposed scheme, we can introduce another service priority factor to determ ine different priority of diverse traffic. Because of th e tolerance of some degree of transm ission errors, voice and video traffic can be tran sm itted in the adverse channel conditions if needed. Therefore, the scheduling scheme can consider th e real-tim e channel quality, priority for achieved average rate, and service priority. In our sim ulation, we only considered two propagation models: free space and Rayleigh fading, and in fact, for m ost mobile practical radm channels, it is much more complex. So, in the future work, we can consider more factors, such as shadow fading and mobility of mobile term inals. C B + M A + F S has the m ost complex ty among these four scheduling schemes since the scheduler in base station needs to calculate and record many param eters, such as: channel conditions, achieved average rates, current transm ission rates and priority factors. In each slot, the scheduler has to com pare the param eter value and select the user to be scheduled. All these operations increase the complexity in base station and raise the cost finally.
