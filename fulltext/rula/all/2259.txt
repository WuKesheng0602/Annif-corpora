ABSTRACT LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSM ENT OF M UNICIPAL SOLID WASTES: DEVELOPM ENT OF WASTED SOFTW ARE A thesis, authored by Rodrigo Diaz, presented to Ryerson University in partial fulfillment o f the requirem ents for the degree o f M aster of Applied Science in the Program of Environmental Applied Science and Management.

This

thesis

introduces

W ASTED

(Waste

Analysis

Software

Tool

for

Environmental Decisions). It is a computer-based model that uses life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to estimate material flows and environmental impacts o f municipal solid waste management.

The model consists o f a num ber o f separate submodels that describe a typical waste m anagement process. These models are combined to represent a com plete waste management system. Based on LCA methodologies, WASTED uses compensatory systems in order to account for the avoided impacts derived from energy recovery and material recycling. In this manner, a comprehensive "cradle-to-grave" analysis o f waste management is possible.

The purpose o f this project is provide waste managers, environmental researchers and decision makers with a tool that helps them to evaluate waste m anagem ent plans and to improve the environm ental performance o f waste management strategies.

INTRODUCTION

Solid w aste m anagem ent deals w ith the way resources are used to deal w ith the end-cf-life m aterials in the w aste stream. W aste m anagem ent is an important

environm ental challenge th at m ust be addressed by every com m unity. The m anagem ent o f w aste stream s often involves com plex decisions regarding the collection, recovery, transport and disposal o f m unicipal solid w aste (M SW ).

T he treatm ent o f M SW has evolved: prior to 1970, sanitary landfills in North A m erica w ere rare - w astes w ere dum ped in low -technology sites. Today, solid waste m anagem ent involves advanced technologies that are m ore efficient and protective o f the environm ent and hum an health. The need for "better" waste m anagem ent solutions has been heightened by increased environm ental aw areness and breakthroughs both in science and environm ental regulation.

A dditionally, w aste m anagem ent has implications for all jurisdictional levels -- m unicipalities, for exam ple, are norm ally in charge o f determ ining the optim um system for w aste collection, truck routes, and especially the cost-optim ization o f w aste collection services to households and com m ercial locations. On the other hand, waste m anagem ent also has global significance: decisions m ade by cities and countries affect the release o f greenhouse gases (G H G ) that contribute to global clim ate change; for instance, landfills were the largest contributors o f m ethane em issions in the US in 1999 (EPA, 2001). It is clear th at w aste m anagem ent has profound effects, ranging from local to worldw ide.

Given the com plexity o f w astes and their m anagem ent, it is difficult to compare the different w aste m anagem ent alternatives. Should one m axim ize the recovery o f reusable m aterials or incinerate w astes to generate energy? Is it better to landfill w astes in a bioreactor or in a typical landfill? Answ ering these questions accurately is im possible w ithout evaluating all the im plications o f M SW m anagem ent. The objective o f the W aste A nalysis Support Tool for Environm ental D ecisions (W A STED ) model is to assist in calculating the environm ental effects o f waste m anagem ent alternatives in order to

improve the overall perform ance o f a waste m anagem ent system .

T o analyze the different w aste m anagem ent alternatives, the W ASTED m odel relies on environm ental life-cycle assessm ent (LCA ). This is an analytic tool that studies ^ the potential environm ental effects associated w ith a product or process. Life-cycle analyses are relatively recent. They started w ith studies th at attem pted to determ ine optimal solutions th at take into account not only energy and raw m aterial consum ption environm ental burdens, but also the impacts related to the final disposal o f a product or service. One o f th e first reported LCAs was perform ed in 1969 by the Coca-C ola Com pany, to determ ine w hether plastic or glass bottles presented few er environm ental burdens (ECO BILAN ). H ow ever, it was really until the 199s that this type o f analysis becam e com m onplace. In 1997 the International O rganization for Standardization issued the ISO 14040 standard, in w hich the different stages o f the Life-cycle analysis are defined. (Ibid).

A L C A studies the environm ental aspects through a product's life (a "cradle-tograve" approach), starting w ith raw m aterial acquisition and ending w ith final disposal. This analysis is perform ed by com piling an inventory o f relevant inputs and outputs to the system , and evaluating the potential im pacts o f these inputs and outputs. In this case, the objective is to perform a "cradle-to-grave" analysis o f m unicipal w astes. Therefore, this life-cycle analysis starts w hen m aterials are discarded into the w aste stream and ends at the p o in t where the waste m aterial has been finally disposed (e.g. through incineration) or transform ed into a resource (e.g. by com posting).

H istorically, the "default" option for m anaging m unicipal w astes has been landfilling (Tam m em agi, 1999). H ow ever, environm ental research has dem onstrated that the optim ization o f M SW m anagem ent has to take into account several factors. A m ongst these are: · » · · · · Com position and quantity o f w aste generated Efficiency o f w aste collection system s A vailability o f technologies for w aste m anagem ent M arket availability for recycled m aterials Em ission standards to w hich the M SW are subject Socio-political factors

A s can b e inferred from the list above, w aste m anagem ent is a very com plex process th at has num erous econom ic, environm ental, social and political implications.

Several Life-cycle assessm ent m odels have been developed institutions:

by different

governm ent environm ental agencies, universities, and w aste m anagem ent

consultants. A lthough all these m odels have sim ilar objectives (to evaluate environm ental effects o f w aste m anagem ent from a system atic perspective), all o f them have shortcom ings in one form or another. In particular, m odels have been developed for different regions and are difficult to "translate" from one site to another, especially with regard to their applications in sites w ith lim ited access to technology (such as developing countries). To m axim ize flexibility, the W ASTED m odel includes a database o f, "typical" w aste m anagem ent param eters, but allow s the input o f site-specific values in order to provide optim um accuracy.

T his thesis is divided in 3 parts: the first one discusses th e generalities o f M SW life-cycle assessm ent m odels, and presents a b rief review o f other m odels currently available and have been used as a starting point for this m odel. T he second chapter will explain the subsystem s o f solid waste m anagem ent: characterization, collection, recycling and other processes. The third chapter w ill com pare the W A ST ED m odel w ith other m odels by m eans o f different case studies.

1. LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTES

1.1 Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment

Environm ental life-cycle assessm ent (LCA) is a system atic evaluation o f the environm ental consequences o f a determ ined process, product or activity . LCA takes a "cradle-to-grave" approach, starting with the acquisition o f raw m aterials required to m anufacture a product, and ending w ith the disposal o f all the m aterials back in the environm ent. In this context, the term "product" includes also service system s -- in this case, for exam ple, w aste m anagem ent systems.

A LCA evaluates all the stages o f a product's life sequentially, and estimates the cum ulative impacts resulting from a product's life cycle, including impacts that are often overlooked in other types o f analyses like raw material extraction, disposal costs and transportation impacts. In this way, LCA provides a com prehensive picture o f the environm ental burdens attributed to a specific process.

Life-Cycle A ssessm ent M ethodology The general fram ew ork for the LCA has been established by the International Organization for Standardization in the ISO 14040 Standard. The procedure to perform a LCA consists o f 4 steps:

I. Goal description / application: In this first step, the ultim ate goal and application o f the results are to be defined. It is also in this step that system

boundaries are established, since they determine to a great extent the results o f the life-cycle assessment.

2. Input / Output Analysis; This step enumerates the exchange o f materials and energy at the system boundaries. In essence, this is an inventory o f m ass and energy entering or leaving the system.

3. Impact assessment: The third stage o f a LCA consists o f assessing the contributions o f input/output data to generate an impact profile. In many cases, this is achieved by using a model to gauge the environm ental effects o f a process or product.

4.

Interpretation: The environmental impacts o f the analyzed process are evaluated according to the goals defined in step 1.

1.1.1 A dvantages o f P e rfo rm in g a Life-C ycle A ssessm ent

The most obvious use for a LCA is to help ·decision-m akers and managers to evaluate objective'" and comprehensively the environm ental impacts to select the product or process that results in the least adverse impacts to the environm ent. A lthough this information is seldom the sole factor to consider in making a decision, it can be tallied along w ith other parameters such as cost and perform ance to discrim inate between different options.

O ther advantages related to performing a LCA are (EPA, 2001); · Systematic evaluation o f the environmental consequences associated w ith a given product · Improved knowledge o f the environmental trade-offs related to product alternatives, and the interdependent nature o f the consequences o f human activities · Quantification o f emissions to different m edia

In general, the main advantage o f performing a LCA is the generation o f

a

comprehensive understanding o f the environmental impacts o f a product, and an accurate picture o f the overall environm ental trade-offs implicated in the selection o f such products.

1.1.2 Limitations of Conducting a Life-Cycle Assessment -

LCA by itself can not determine w hat process or product is most efficient or costeffective. Therefore, the information generated in this analysis should be used as a decision component in combination with other tools as part o f a comprehensive decision package, and not as a "stand-alone" tool. Additionally, it is important to understand that since LCA are often based on models, they provide only an approxim ation o f reality.

1.2 Review o f Life-Cycle Assessments Of Municipal Solid Wastes

L ife-cycle assessment o f municipal solid wastes (MSW ) exhibits certain differences com pared to a "typical" LCA. In general, LCA systems are m odeled so that inputs and outputs are followed from cradle-to-grave -- starting w ith raw material acquisition and ending when the materials are discarded to the environm ent without further hum an transform ations (ISO 14040). As described by Finnveden (1999), in the case o f w aste management a LCA often starts with the input o f solid w aste as it appears in the curb or waste collection bin, after been discarded by consumers. This difference does not have an effect given the general premises o f a LCA, but does require' modifications for different aspects o f the analysis. These aspects include system boundaries, recycling, m ulti-input processes, and tim e-fram e considerations. Their

influence in the developm ent o f the W ASTED model will be discussed in chapter 3.

W ith regard to municipal solid wastes, LCAs have been used only (relatively) recently; several companies and other organizations have developed models used to quantify the impacts o f MSW m anagement decisions. To create this model, the following projects were reviewed and ana.yzed:

1.2.1.Integrated Solid Waste Management Model (ISWM)
This computer-based model was developed by CSR and EPIC, in Canada. The University o f W aterloo has been assigned to assist with the use o f this tool. This project

was developed with the participation o f the city o f London, Ontario, and London was the initial case study. The objective o f this project is to "provide Canadian municipalities w ith tools that will enable them to evaluate the environmental and economic

perform ance o f the various elements o f their existing or proposed waste management systems leading towards the goal of ISW M [integrated solid waste m anagement]" (Corporations Supporting Recycling [CSR], 2000). Along with the environmental model, it includes a sub-model for economical estimates. This model is available free o f charge from the University o f Waterloo website (www.iwm-moclel.uwaterloo.ca1. although approval must be granted by email authorization.

ISW M is a spreadsheet-based m odel that consists o f several input screens. Each screen covers different aspects o f the life cycle inventory (LCI) o f municipal solid waste:

a. Quantity and Composition of waste: This screen requires the input o f the total amount o f waste managed, as well as its composition in different fractions and sub-fractions (for example the Plastic category includes PET, HDPE, PVC). The model provides default values for waste composition. b. W aste Flow: The user is required to specify the mass o f waste destined for recycling, composting, land application, energy-from-waste and landfill. c. W aste collection: This screen records the parameters for the collection and transportation of waste including distance and type o f fuel utilized. It also

estimates the fuel consumption, based on average fuel efficiencies for both collection and transport. I f a waste transfer station is present, another screen

appears allowing the user to input the energy consumed in the operation process, as well as the distance from the transfer station to the different w aste treatment facilities. d. Electric grid selection; This screen allows the user to specify th e locale (by Canadian province) in which the LCA is performed, in order to estimate the fraction o f power generated by different processes (such as coal, natural gas and nuclear). Alternatively, the user may input m anually the breakdow n o f electricitygenerating processes. This is used to calculate the emissions avoided due to recycling or energy recovery. e. Recycling: In this section the user must input the recovery percentage for the different fractions o f the waste stream. f. M aterial recovery facility: This screen registers the input for energy consumption, residue percentage and management, and the distance required to transport the different recovered m aterials to their respective reprocessors. g. Composting: The user has to provide the breakdown o f the different compostable m aterials (paper, food waste and yard waste) in the waste stream. Also, inputs for residue generation, transport, type o f composting process and energy consumption are needed. h. Land application: This screen requires the param eters for direct land application o f yard waste (leaves and yard material). It requires the average energy consumption for this operation, as well as the breakdown o f the waste applied. i. Energy from waste: In this screen, the user is required to indicate the type o f energy recovery, energy recovery efficiency, energy consum ption during this

process, and emission parameters. These Include ash generation, and emission rates for air contaminants (based on the Ontario M OE guidelines). Transport distance for the generated ash must also be provided. j. Landfilling; This screen records the parameters for the landfill. It includes gas and energy recovery efficiencies, annual precipitation, leachate collection efficiency and energy consumption

Model outputs are in the form o f Excel spreadsheets, and include a sum m ary o f the input data, a summary o f the outputs which include the total life cycle burdens, an output table that breaks down the burdens from each waste management process and a table that presents the inventory results in terms o f "everyday" equivalents, such as energy consumption per household and greenhouse gases produced by car use.

As part o f its limitations, the authors o f this model acknowledge the following: It does not consider all the available waste m anagement processes It does not evaluate waste reduction/reuse, nor the m anagem ent o f all waste streams (for example white goods or tyres). The m odel does not evaluate the energy and em issions associated w ith the production o f waste management infrastructure (such as disposal facilities). The model is based upon the best data available publicly, and represents the currently accepted practices for life cycle studies. M ost param eters are not easily modifiable (for exam ple', the user cannot m odify the ratio o f methane content in landfill gas)

1.2.2 Organic Waste Research (ORWARE)
This is a com puter-based model that estimates substance flows, environmental impacts and costs o f waste m anagem ent. It has been used by several m unicipalities and companies to com pare waste m anagem ent alternatives (Eriksson, 2002). There are several published case studies that use this platform as the basis for their results. One o f them is the Danish EPA, w hich used ORW ARE to determ ine the overall effects o f an increase in household recycling (Baky and Eriksson, 2003).

Irrespective o f its name, this m odel covers both the organic and the inorganic , fractions o f waste, and consists o f several sub-models that describe the different processes o f a complete w aste m anagem ent system (including composting and

incineration). It relies heavily in the M atlab interface by integrating m aterial flows in an individual variable vector, som etim es com prising up to 50 substances (Eriksson, 2002). The different sub-models w ere developed in cooperation with four different Swedish research institutions: KTH Royal Institute o f Technology, IVL Swedish

Institute, JTI -

Environmental Engineering and SLU - Sw edish University for Agricultural Science.

T he process sub-m odels contained in the ORW ARE m odel are the following: a. W aste sources and w aste fractions: ORW ARE is not devoted to m unicipal solid w aste, it also includes special wastes from industry and stream s such as sewage. Household waste is divided in fractions such as organic, non com bustible waste, combustible waste, paper, cardboard, diapers, rubber, glass, m etal and HD PE. These fractions are further described by a set o f param eters that describe the chemical composition o f the waste, process performance and m aterial recovery. b. W aste Transport: D ifferent parameters in this model allow for the collection in different types o f trucks (for example, front-loader m odels), as well as transport o f secondary w aste'. Outputs o f this sub-model are energy and tim e consumption, as well as emissions, calculated from total energy consum ption. c. Incineration: This sub-m odel consists o f three parts: pre-treatm ent, incinerator operation and air pollution control. To estimate emissions site-specific data, com parable facilities' data o r emission assum ptions are used. O utputs o f this model are em issions, energy recovered (in the form o f electricity, district heating or a com bination o f both), and economic indicators (such as $/kg or $/KW h) d. Thermal Gasification: This process, akin to incineration, is based on a w asteto-energy (W TE) pilot plant facility. The outputs are sim ilar to those described in the incineration sub-m odel.

' Secondary waste refers to waste that is a by-product o f a waste management process, such as ash from incineration or compost residues.

e.

Landfill: This sub-m odel allows for the selection o f five different landfill types: m ixed waste, bio-reactor landfill, w astew ater sludge, fly ash and slag. These types represent "typical" Swedish average landfills (Eriksson, 2002). Since Landfill degradation is slow, the scope o f tim e surveyed by this m odel is extended beyond the surveyed time for the other processes. To be able to com pare landfill em issions, the future im pact from landfilling has been separated into surveyable (sic) tim e and rem aining tim e. Inputs to th is m odel include energy consum ed (diesel and power), efficiency o f landfill gas recovery and tim e o f leachate treatm ent used. O utputs include em issions, energy recovery from landfill gas, and landfilling costs.

f. M aterial Recycling: This sub-m odel includes the recovery o f plastics and cardboard. Param eters are based on specific Sw edish plants, and include electricity consum ption and the fraction rejected. O utputs from this sub-m odel are em issions to water, energy related em issions to air, energy consum ption and w aste in the form o f biosludge and plastic rejects. g. A naerobic Digestion: This sub-m odel allow s for therm ophilic or m esophilic anaerobic digestion o f organic waste. It is based on a treatm ent plant in Uppsala, Sweden. The m odel calculates the energy input for the digestion o f the w astes, as well as the am ount o f gas and sludge as w ell as the costs for treatm ent. h. Com posting: T hree types o f com posting are integrated in this m odel: sm allscale com posting in households, m odel operates and large-scale w indrow of or reactor " proper

m anagem ent" (no anaerobic degradation o f wastes or leachate spills). Essentially, em issions are the same, although reactor com posting allows for effluent gas treatm ent.

In this study, m odels such as those presented by Thorneloe et (2002) al and Barlaz et al (2003) w ere consulted to develop W ASTED. H ow ever, both these m odels are sitespecific; they use param eters that are not necessarily typical. Therefore, the results from these sim ulations can hardly be extrapolated to other case studies.

com plete, and is used by m any firms and governm ent agencies. This m odel charges its user a licensing fee o f US$3000 and an annual contract of U S$3000 (Ibid). T herefore, the need for a generic an affordable LC A for municipal solid w aste system s is still unfulfilled.

In general, the prem ise o f all these m odels is to evaluate the environm ental effects o f waste m anagem ent from a system atic point o f view , looking beyond the threshold o f local perspectives. They differ in the degree o f inclusion o f different w aste m anagem ent technologies, the degree to w hich the user can modify the sim ulation param eters, and their ultim ate purpose. The "higher end" m odels such as TEA M are very sophisticated and allow for fine adjustm ent o f the param eters, but unfortunately they are quite expensive and also require extensive research to estim ate site-specific param eters. Therefore, there is still a niche for a generic and easy-to-use LCA model.

All the aforem entioned m odels have provided insight and information to develop this project. Some param eters from these m odels have also been adopted as baselines, while trying to circum vent some o f their individual shortcom ings (for exam ple, W A R M 'S com plete devotion to study greenhouse gas em issions w hile disregarding any other implications or O R W A R E's usage o f M atlab instead o f less-specialized softw are) w ith the intent to create a generic m odel that is sim ple to use and generates useful indicators.

2. WASTED MODEL

2.1 General Description

T h e W ASTED model was developed to estimate the environm ental impacts o f waste m anagem ent alternatives. It addresses typical aspects o f M SW m anagem ent from the collection o f wastes through ultim ate disposal. It relies on process m odels to calculate energy consum ption (or generation) as well as em issions from each w aste m anagement operation.

O ne o f the crucial aspects o f a LCA is a reliable "m aterial balance" o f the inputs to the system To keep track o f the paths taken by the different w aste streams, the W ASTED model relies on a m aterial flow analysis (MPA). A m aterial flow analysis is an analytical tool that follows the different m aterial inputs through the diverse processes they undergo until they exit the system boundaries (Finnveden & M oberg, 2001). This type o f analysis is well suited for the analysis o f M SW , since the different components o f the w aste stream often undergo different processes (for instance only organic materials can be composted).

Once the M PA is carried out, W ASTED generates data on em issions from each o f the submodels o f the system . D ata are sorted into different categories, to facilitate their com parison (greenhouse gases are one category, for exam ple). The processes that are analyzed in these models are:

2.2 M SW Life-Cycle A ssessm ent M ethodology

Some methodological aspects require special consideration when applying LCA to municipal solid wastes. These aspects are the establishment o f system boundaries, the integration of recovered materials, processes with multiple inputs and time-frame considerations.

2.2.1 System B oundaries

One o f the nodal points o f LCA is that the system model is created so that the inputs and outputs are followed from "cradle-to-grave" . Often, this means that inputs are flows withdrawn from the environment, and outputs are flows discarded into the environment. For MSW, this approach is modified: inputs are solid wastes "as they appear" (in this case, from households), and outputs are materials or energy that are recycled, reused or discarded . This is compatible with the LCA definition, as long as the same flows appear in all systems which are to be compared (Finnveden, 1999).

Given the complexities o f w aste management (WM) systems, it is difficult to compare directly W M scenarios. For example, incineration generates m ore carbon dioxide than landfilling o f wastes, but this fails to take into account the displaced emissions due to electricity generation in energy from waste (EFW) plants. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce upstream and downstream compensatory systems. Upstream compensatory systems evaluate the effects o f processes that precede the waste

21

management system; downstream compensatory systems incorporate the environmental effects o f processes that take place after WM. By expanding the system boundaries with compensatory systems, the comparison o f different systems can be m ade more just (Eriksson, 2002)"^. A more detailed description o f the com pensatory systems will be

described in section 2.4 T he expanded system boundaries in W ASTED are chosen w ithin the LCA perspective. Therefore, they include the processes that are connected to the waste management system such as raw material extraction, production and use. However, they do not include the burdens associated with the generation o f w aste management infrastructure (such as machinery or facility siting). In practice, these burdens have been found to be relatively small compared to the em issions from w aste management operations (GSR, 2000).

T he LCA in WASTED is designed to account for emissions and raw material consumption regardless o f the geographic location in w hich they occur (for example, recycled aluminium replaces virgin aluminium whether this is produced locally or imported); this consideration is important for aspects such as em issions avoidance from energy recovery. Tem poral boundaries vary between the submodels; these will be discussed below.

In other words, and borrowing terms from economics, compensatory systems attempt to internalize system externalities.

2.2.2 Material And Energy Recover)

In W ASTED, recovered materials are considered to replace their virgin raw material equivalents. A prime example o f this situation is the recovery o f aluminum from beverage containers - this material can be used to manufacture new beverage containers. However, the fate o f wastes is seldom that simple - the situation known as open4oop

recycling takes place when a product is recycled into a different product (Finnveden).
This is the case for recovered steel cans, since the resulting steel is not suited for milling steel sheets o f the thinness required to make steel cans (EPA, 2002). A similar problem occurs w ith energy recovery; for example, if an extra kW /h o f electricity is needed beyond the availability o f the " regular" sources o f power, this extra energy is likely to come from a marginal source. The LCA o f this situation can prove problematic, since the system boundaries between the different products are not clearly defined.

This problem can be solved in two ways: the first is to allocate additional

environmental interactions for the recycling o f product A into product B. The second is
to expand the system boundaries to include both products within the system.

. Allocation consists o f including the environmental interdependencies o f two materials into one o f them, so that the two input/output analyses are m erged into one effectively integrating the environmental burdens o f material B into material A. An example o f this is the recycling o f paper: a fraction o f newspaper (material "B ") is

normally recovered in the form o f "m ixed" paper (material "A "). Therefore, the recycling

23

Reproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

o f mixed paper should take into consideration the em issions derived from the m anufacture o f newspaper to be representative.

There are several methods for allocation, but there is no general consensus on the "correctness" o f these. Rather, allocations are based on intuitive m odels that strive to account for the environmental impacts o f open loop recycling. The following are two examples o f allocation methods;

·

Allocating raw materials for production o f both products, and recycled material into product B only. For example, using recovered polystyrene from food packaging to m anufacture housing insulation.

«

Allocating a quota o f recycled material to the recycled product. This is the case, for example, o f paper products with a certain content o f recycled paper.

Ideally, environmental allocations will result in an accurate representation o f the analyzed case. Therefore, it is crucial to utilize this method only w hen appropriate data is available. In general, the parameters used for environm ental allocation vary widely from study to study, since they tend to be very specific.

The other method to tally open-loop recycling is system boundary expansion. This consists o f annexing additional functions to an existing system, in order to make it comparable to another (Finnveden, 1999). A good exam ple o f this method is the comparison between EFW options and a dry landfill with no energy recovery; since

24

waste incineration combusts non-biogenic carbon compounds (such as plastics), the direct C O 2 emissions from incineration is higher than from landfill operation. However, waste incineration m ight also provide energy, which displaces power generated from other sources (fossil fuels). Therefore, the system is expanded to allow for the "avoided emissions" from energy generation by waste incineration, and so the tw o options can be compared more comprehensively. This is the approach recommended by the ISO 14040 standard, and it is the one used to solve open-loop recycling issues in the W ASTED model. T he main drawback o f using the system expansion method is that the model

becomes progressively larger and more complicated (Ibid).

2.2.3 M u lti-In p u t Processes '

It is the nature o f M SW management processes to be complex: they include very diverse physical and chemical transformations. Models are used to predict the outcome o f these transform ations. These models rely on process parameters and input data to estimate the outcomes o f waste management processes.

T he most common type o f model used in waste management relies on the massbased m ethod. Under this method, emissions are calculated for the different processes according to the am ount o f waste treated. This approach has many advantages - it is easy to calculate the ratio o f emissions to the amount o f waste treated. However, for some cases this approach might lead to inaccurate estimates: for example, the types and quantities o f heavy metals leached from landfills depend highly on the nature o f wastes being landfilled. Extrapolating general landfill parameters to a specific case-study could

25

Reproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

lead to inaccurate results. This situation repeats itself for other processes -- com posting and incineration behave similarly. This is the nature o f m ultiple-input processes: they depend on more than one variable to provide accurate results. The subm odels them selves are considered as "black boxes" - for the purposes o f W ASTED only their inputs and outputs are relevant

In order to avoid this situation, the model m ight include a very com prehensive list o f variables that the user must provide to attain more representative results. The draw back o f this approach is that the model rapidly becomes exceedingly com plex. Since the objective o f the W ASTED model is to aid in the evaluation o f M SW m anagem ent options, the em ission m odels were kept simple, relying (with the exception o f the landfill and incineration m odels) on a mass-based m ethodology. However, to better represent the case studied, the m odel parameters can be changed by the user if site-specific data are available.

2.2.4 Time-Frame Considerations

A lthough the temporal boundary in general is easy to establish for the LCA o f solid wastes, there is one very important difference between the landfill process and the rest o f the com ponents o f M SW m anagement. Em issions from a landfill m ay prevail for a very long time. This is especially the case for heavy metals - these com pounds m ight take thousands o f years to leave the landfill site.

D ifferent surveyable tim e periods have been used in different m odels - from 10 years in the ORW ARE m odel (Eriksson, 2002) to thousands o f years (Tam m em agi). However, no amount o f tim e stipulated is accepted beyond discussion. In the W ASTED model, tw o time frames are adopted: for landfill gas generation, reaction kinetics are ignored, and the model will calculate gaseous emissions to the end. In other words, it will estimate the total gas generation according to the amount and nature o f waste w ithout regard to when these emissions will be released. However, when this approach is used for recalcitrant compounds (such as heavy m etals) the time period for these em issions to reach background levels m ight be in the vicinity o f millions o f years (Finnveden & Huppes, 1995). To maximize flexibility in this topic, the W ASTED m odel w ill allow the user to provide a surveyable tim e period consistent with his/her type o f analysis, although a suggested time period o f 100 years is used by default. This tim e period is consistent with models such as the CSR and the ORW ARE Life Cycle Assessments.

2.3 Description O f The Sub-Models In The Wasted M odel

2.3.1 W aste Generation

A lthough w aste generation is not precisely part o f the w aste m anagem ent system , it is the starting step o f the W ASTED model. A n accurate prediction o f the am ount o f wastes that enter the system will ensure the validity o f the output data.

A M F A lies at the core o f the w aste generation sub-m odel. A ctivities that generate waste are not included - the model begins w hen w aste is collected at the source, and is limited only by the availability o f data on w aste generation and characterization. There are several m ethods to estimate the am ount o f w aste generated and the different fractions that com prise it. T he W ASTED m odel uses a p e r capita approach to calculate the

am ount o f w astes. T his is supported by the w ide availability o f data characterized in this manner. It also allow s the user to calculate the average population in a given locale over a time period, given that population growth data are available.

In the W A STED model, w aste is classified in 6 different categories: · O rganic waste: this fraction includes food wastes, yard wastes and other degradable fractions. These are relevant since they are fit for com posting and they degrade over tim e w hen placed in landfill,; there, they generate m ethane, carbon dioxide, and other less prevalent com pounds. · Paper: this category includes fine paper, new spaper, corrugated cardboard, and other cellulose fiber com pounds. Some o f them can be recycled, and other fractions m ight be sent for energy recovery or landfilling. · Plastic: This fraction includes all the carbon polym er compounds. In M SW , plastic fractions are m ade up m ostly o f polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephtalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). · M etal: T he metal com ponent o f the M SW stream is composed mainly o f beverage and food cans used to preserve foods. The form er are usually m ade o f alum inum , and the later ("tin" cans) are m ade o f steel.

·

O ther w astes: This category includes m iscellaneous w astes th at do not belong to the other 5 categories. Exam ples are rubber, leather wastes, and construction debris.

T o begin an analysis, the W ASTED model requires the user to input the sim ulation tim e, average population (or starting population and population change rate), waste generation rate and the waste fraction for each category o f w aste. It includes a database for typical national values for both waste generation and characterization. However, the data included are non-com prehensive and m ight not apply to the scenario being evaluated (clearly,not all the residents o f the US generate 720 kg o f w aste per year, though this is the national average) (EPA, 1999). Therefore, it is recom m ended that the user provides as m uch site-specific data as possible.

T he outputs o f the w aste generation submodel are the different fractions o f waste, and the total am ount o f w aste generated.

2.3.2 W aste Collection

The subm odel for w aste collection allows for separate collection o f refuse and recyclable m aterials, as well as co-collection. It also allow s the user to select w hether a transfer station is present or not, and to modify its param eters o f operation. T he structure o f this m odel is shown in figure 2.2

T h e num ber o f loads per year required is calculated from the total am ount o f wastes and the load capacity o f the trucks, either for co-collection or for separate trucks. The num ber o f loads and the collection route are used in turn to calculate the total drive distance. The total drive distance is tallied w ith the average fuel consum ption and the transfer station-consum ed utilities to determ ine the total energy profile and em issions for the w aste collection process. The source o f the param eters o f the diesel-pow ered trucks and transfer station utility use is the Danish EPA assessm ent (Baky & Eriksson). The param eters for gas-pow ered trucks are adapted from the D O E report on liquefied natural gas trucks (Chandler et al).

Route distance estim ates for the W ASTED m odel are based on a round-trip starting and finishing at the transfer station or equivalent w aste facility. However, transport routes are based on route length - that is, the distance betw een the transfer station and the different w aste m anagem ent facilities. T he model autom atically calculates total fuel consum ption for the total distance covered by the w aste transports.

In the W ASTED m odel, the totality o f the MSW is assumed to undergo collection and transport processes. A fter collection, the fractions are sent to a m aterial recovery facility (M RP), an EFW plant, or to a landfill.

2.3.3 Waste Flow

This is one o f the sim plest subm odels in W ASTED. In it the user is required to apportion the quantities o f w aste that are sent to the different w aste m anagem ent processes; m aterial recycling, energy recovery and landfilling.. The user can introduce either the percentage o f total waste that goes to each o f the aforem entioned options, or the user m ight input the quantity o f w aste that goes to each process; W ASTED will calculate the com plem entary param eter and w ill notify the user when the sum o f the different waste fractions do not m atch the total waste calculated in the waste generation submodel.^

It is im portant to m ention that the fractions sent for recycling, EFW or landfilling constitute untreated and iinsortecf wastes, directly from collection or from the transfer station. For example, if 1000 tons o f w aste are sent for m aterial recovery, it does not mean that the 100% o f that w aste will be recycled or composted - the actual m ass o f material recovered depends on the efficiency o f the recovery processes. W ASTED allows the user to then determ ine the fate o f the un-recovered fraction o f waste: landfilling or EFW.

®This fractions might be source-separated (in a recycling bin, for example), but do not undergo further separation processes once they enter the system boundaries.

Other LCA s have determined that, other than source reduction, recycling is the MSW alternative that generates more energy credits and has the largest impact on the reduction o f em issions (EPA, 2002); furthermore, paper recycling also increases the

sequestration o f atmospheric GHG. Therefore, this submodel has special importance for the calculation o f emission and energy credits.

In the context o f the W ASTED model, when a material is recycled, it is used in place o f virgin inputs in the manufacturing process. The avoided energ}> param eter is calculated by deducting the energy used to manufacture a product from recycled raw m aterials from the energy used to manufacture a product from "virgin" raw materials. In some cases, this param eter can be quite significant - for example, recycling aluminum saves approxim ately 95% o f the energy required to smelt aluminum from bauxite (W ang & Pereira). N ote that this is not strictly true for the cases that already recycle materials, and therefore energy and emission estimates will not be accurate. In those cases, the user may modify the energy use parameters to allow for an allocation o f pre-recycled material in the waste stream.

All the m aterials considered in this analysis are modeled as being recovered in a "closed loop" . In reality, this not the case for all materials. Model reliability is preserved by expanding the system boundaries to include the reduction o f energy use and emissions on a per ton basis for each recycled material. These parameters can also be modified by the user to better reflect the situation in a case study.

Recovered materials undergo the following process: first, they arrive at the material recovery facility (MRF). There, they undergo sorting and baling processes to ease their handling. Then, they are sent to a recycling plant or to a composting facility.

The W ASTED model calculates the use o f utilities in the M RF on a per ton basis. Then, the different material fractions are recovered, and an energy credit or charge is assigned on and individual level. Afterwards, emissions for this process are calculated based on the energy generation profile for the case being studied. A summary o f the data is included in each subsection, and a full description o f the param eters is included at the end o f this section.

T he materials covered under this submodel are; · M etal: Aluminum and steel are the only metal components in the MSW considered to be fit for recycling in the WASTED model. O ther metals are not considered to be viable for recovery due to their lack o f econom ic appeal or scarcity in the waste stream. The estimates presented below are intended as average parameters, and include energy use and emissions on a de-localized perspective. In other words, the LCA accounts for the em issions incurred when a raw material has been imported.

o

Aluminum: most o f the aluminum in the w aste stream comes from beverage cans. From a recycling perspective, aluminum is one o f the most attractive materials in the waste stream. This is because recycling aluminum is much less energy intensive than smelting alum inum ore: 17.3 GJ/ton Vs 239.4 GJ/ton (EPA, 2002). Aluminum is also a true closed loop material - it can be melted and used over and over again.

o

Steel: The majority o f this metal present in the MSW stream is

in the

form o f "tin" cans. Although not as energy efficient as the recycling o f aluminum, recycling steel also generates important energy credits. Recycled steel requires 13.7 GJ/ton to be processed, while steel from virgin raw materials requires 36.7 GJ/ton (Ibid).

·

Glass: This material comes from food and beverage containers. In the W ASTED model this fraction includes both coloured and clear glass bottles. Recycling glass is relatively easy - it merely involves rinsing, crushing and melting the glass containers. However, this is an energy intensive process that takes place at 1800 K (W ang & Pereira). Therefore, the energy use for the recycling o f glass is 5 M J/ton, against 7.5 M J/ton for virgin raw materials. Glass can also be reused over and over, and can be recycled in a closed loop.

·

Paper; Virgin and recycled paper undergo an essentially equivalent process: Paper is composed o f cellulose fibres. To separate the fibres and m anufacture paper sheets these fibres are made into a pulp. These fibres degrade in the recycling process, so eventually paper can't be reused anymore. Therefore, paper is not a true closed loop material. In WASTED, 4 different kinds o f paper are considered for recycling: newspaper, fine paper, cardboard from packaging and mixed paper. This model disregards the (relatively insignificant) forest carbon sequestration o f greenhouse gases reported by the EPA (2002).

Fine paper: this category is com prised o f paper used for printing and photocopying.

Cardboard: This is the typical material used for packaging. It includes both the smooth and corrugated fractions o f this material,

M ixed paper: This last category describes materials such as tissues and paper cups; it also includes a portion o f recycled paper. (Ibid)

·

Plastic: Although the technology to recycle m ost plastics exists, the sorting and preparation processes are complex. Therefore, most localities do not recycle all plastics. Currently, the industry classifies plastics into seven categories: high density polyethylene (HDPE-1), polyethylene terephtalate (PET-2), polyvinyl

chloride (PVC-3), low density polyethylene (LDPE-4), polypropylene (PP-5), polystyrene (PS-6) and other plastics (Other-7). In general, the lower numbers are m ore readily recovered; for example, Toronto only recycles HDPE and PET (City o f Toronto, 2003). The W ASTE model allows the recycling o f all these categories w ith two differences: HDPE (I) and LDPE (4) are amalgamated under polyethylene. The model doesn't allow for the recycling o f " Other" plastics because few locations actually are able to perform this process.

T he process o f plastic recycling consists o f sorting and washing the plastics, and m elting them to be reused in new forms. This process is very sensitive to

contam inants, and even a few parts o f a different plastic can render a whole batch unusable {Vesilind & Rim er). The default fraction o f total plastics that is recycled is based on the EPA GHG Inventory (2002), and the suggested individual plastic fractions are adopted from the post-consumer plastic recycling data in Europe (Greenpeace). The sources o f plastics in the M SW stream are taken from the EPA M SW Handbook (1996).

2.3.5 Composting
T h e organic fraction o f recovered w aste is considered to be com posted. This process consists o f the aerobic degradation o f v/astes to produce com post, a natural fertilizer.

T here are three basic types o f composting; w indrow , reactor and backyard com posting. T he form er tw o are centralized processes, w hile the latter is done as part of household w aste m anagem ent. W astes treated by backyard com posting d o n 't really enter the m unicipal solid w aste stream , and are therefore excluded from the W A STED model.

C om posting has several environm ental advantages over landfilling. In first place, when done properly com posting generates no m ethane (CH4). T his gas is produced by anaerobic degradation o f w astes (for example, in a landfill), and has
21

tim es the

greenhouse potential o f C O 2 . Furtherm ore, m ature com post can be used as a fertilizer and does not generate long term environm ental concerns. Finally, the aerobic degradation o f organic com pounds results in the "storage" o f a small am ount o f carbon that is not degraded to CO 2 , but transform ed into slow ly decom posable com ponents. The EPA reports a low er bound o f approxim ately 0.03 tons o f carbon equivalent (CE) per ton of com posted w aste (EPA , 2003).

W A STED allow s for the evaluation o f w indrow and reactor com posting processes. T he follow ing assum ptions are used in the com post m odel:

W indrow composting consists o f laying the w astes into long, relatively narrow strips o f w aste called windrows. These are kept m oist and at an optim al nutrient concentration (a C-N ratio o f 30:1, Baky & Eriksson, 2003). Energy use com es from the m achinery used to overturn the w indrow s to m aintain aeration.

R eactor com posting is done inside a vessel. It is m ore energy-intensive than w indrow com posting. However, it allows for cleanup o f flue gases, and allows com posting in cold w eather or w here verm in m ight be problem atic. T he following param eters are used for the com post submodel:

2.3.6 Energy From Waste

E nergy from w aste (EFW ) is the process to recover energy from the com bustible fractions in the M SW . W astes can provide significant am ounts o f energy: from 11 M J/kg (EPA, 2002) for m ixed w astes to the m uch higher calorific values o f 33 M J/kg for certain plastic fractions (H all & Overend, 1987). W aste-to-energy (W TE) projects have been developed to recover the energy contained in w astes in form s o f heat or electricity: Porteus (1998) estim ates that around 500 kW h o f electrical pow er is w asted w ith each ton o f M SW that goes to a landfill.

T he W ASTED EFW submodel consists o f four parts: fuel characterization, utility use, energy recovery and em ission estimation:

·

Fuel Characterization: The W ASTED model calculates the com position o f untreated M SW and its energy content. It may include the fractions o f waste rem aining after recycling/com posting, if indicated by the user. Additionally, the user m ight also opt to treat the M SW as refuse-derived fuel (RD F). This results in a higher energy content per ton, but increases the utility use. T he RDF characteristics are based on the European Com m ission RDF Study (Grendebien et al, 2003). A lternatively, the user m ight also supply specific data.

·

U tility Use: Electricity is used for the preparation o f wastes to be com busted. For "untreated" M SW , 14.5 M J/ton are needed (Baky & Eriksson, 2003). W hen RDF is used, this value raises to 88.9 M J/ton (Caputo & Pelagge, 2002). The electricity required for the operation o f the plant is included in the overall energy efficiency o f the process.

·

Energy Recovery:

W ASTED calculates the am ount o f pow er generated by the

EFW process - resulting in energy credits. The overall efficiency depends on the type o f W TE facility' (incineration or gasification), and the type o f energy recovery technology (either electricity, or power and heat recovery). Param eters for this section have been adopted from the Danish E P A 's incineration model
' ' In WASTED, the typical incinerator is considered to recover energy through a steam cycle. These systems
have a net electrical efficiency o f around 23%. Waste gasification recovery is done through a gas turbine (Belgiorno et al). These parameters include losses in the electrical grid (EPA, 2002).

(Baky & Erikssson, 2003), and from waste gasification m odel param eters (Belgiorno et al, 2003). The user might also supply site-specific data.

·

Em ission Estimation: W ASTED calculates the air emissions derived from direct combustion o f the wastes. Em issions are based on the param eters described by both the Danish (Baky & Eriksson, 2003) and the US EPA (2000). Further data on the ratio o f excess air used (necessary to calculate the dilution factors) w ere taken from Porteus (1998) and from Johnke et al (2000). Em issions from the EFW process are deducted from any credits resulting from the avoided em issions due to energy credits. CO 2 emissions are factored from m aterial balances (carbon content, as reported in the Danish GHG Projections (2003)). In the case o f CO 2 emissions, only those from non-biogenic sources are accounted (such as plastics). CO 2 generated from the combustion o f organics is considered to be "carbon neutral".^

®When combustion o f items such as wood takes place, the carbon dioxide emissions are considered to be equal to the atmospheric COz that was "stored" into the material. Therefore, they don't count as GHG. In contrast, plastic is made from non-biogenic carbon sources (oil). These carbon fractions weren't part o f the atmosphere and so must be accounted as emissions.

2.3.7 Landfill
Ideally, sanitary landfills are facilities that constitute the final resting place o f wastes th a t are irrecoverable. According to the American Society o f Civil Engineers are;

" a method o f disposing [wastes] on land without creating nuisance or hazard to public or safety, by utilizing the principles o f engineering to confine the refuse to the smallest practical volume" (ASCE, 1959)

It should be stressed that that modern engineered landfills are not dumps, they are planned facilities that are destined to provide proper disposal for w astes that can't be recovered. Landfilling is the last step in the integrated waste m anagem ent plan. Although the ideal case is that
100

% o f every good produced is re-introduced to the production

cycle, it is therm odynam ically impossible. Therefore waste disposal facilities are still required.

Pollution from landfill occurs in three forms: loss o f land as a resource, emissions to atm osphere from landfill gas (LFG) and/or LFG combustion, and em issions to water in form o f leachate. W ASTED estimates these emissions, and tallies them with the emissions from utility use in landfill generation and the avoided emission credits if landfill gas is collected for energy recovery.

L and Use Landfill Area

The landfill submodels starts with the waste characterization. This is done by a MF A o f the different waste fractions that are destined for landfilling. They include residues from recycling and composting, as well as ashes or slag from the EFW process. These materials are compacted in order to minimize the landfill area.

W ASTED allows for four different kind o f landfills: 1. Sanitary Landfill: This is the typical landfill used in the US and other

parts o f the world. It consists o f layers o f waste separated with a "daily" material cover to prevent scavenging by vermin, and includes bottom liners and a leachate collection system (EPA, 1996). Upon closure, these

51

landfills are covered with impermeable covers to m inimize water infiltration (and the subsequent leachate generation). In general, the

design objective o f this type landfill is to insure the "inertness" o f the contents by keeping them as dry and isolated from the exterior as possible. 2. Bioreactor landfill: In contrast with the typical sanitary landfill, the purpose o f the bioreactor landfill is to promote a rapid degradation o f the organic fraction o f wastes. This is done by circulating w ater (and sometim es nutrients and other additives) to promote the optimum conditions for either aerobic or anaerobic degradation. Bioreactor landfills norm ally have higher LFG collection efficiencies than typical landfills.^ 3. Unlined landfill with leachate collection: This type o f system is rare, but occurs when a landfill is retro-fitted with leachate collection systems. Alternatively, a landfill is also consider to belong to this category when it has no cover (because it is an active landfill cell) or when the top liner has been so deteriorated that its effects are considered negligible. 4. Unlined landfill with no leachate collection: This type o f landfill has little or no engineering. It basically consists o f a "convenient" place to dump wastes. It offers no energy recovery or pollution containment. In certain

' The amount o f LFG is determined by the nature o f the wastes stored in it --the carbon content determines the total gaseous emissions either in the form o f COz or CH^. In a LCA the speed with which the gas is generated (reaction kinetics) is irrelevant - all the emissions must be accounted, regardless o f when they take place. In this context, the main difference between a typical landfill and a bioreactor is their gas collection efficiency.

aspects, this option can prove worse than letting households their own w astes.'"

deal with

Irrespective o f the type o f landfill, leachate is generated w hen precipitation infiltrates into the waste. The kinetics for the generation o f leachate are quite com plicated, and have been described extensively in the EPA 's H E LP model. In W ASTED, a simplified approach is used. The adopted model is sim ilar to the one adopted by the Danish EPA (Baky & Eriksson, 2003); · Leachate generation is directly proportional to the precipitation in the study locale and the area o f the landfill. W ASTED includes a database for the precipitation in some representative cities, but this list is by no means exhaustive". The amount o f precipitation that infiltrates to form leachate depends on the type and quality o f the landfill cover (Ecobalance, 2003). Inorganic pollutants exit the landfill in the leachate during the surveyable time.

·

Greenhouse gas emissions are based on the IPCC guidelines for GHG inventories (1996). These guidelines estim ate the percentage o f degradable organic carbon (DOC) contained in the different fractions o f the waste stream. These parameters are used as baselines for carbon emissions.

·

Gas collection efficiency depends on the type o f landfill. The data were adopted from the Danish EPA (Baky & Eriksson, 2003) and the US EPA (2 0 0 2 ) reports.

When organic wastes are degraded anaerobically in a landfill, they produce methane. This gas is 21 times more potent as a GHG than CO2 , the typical product from aerobic degradation. (EPA, 2002). Furthermore, these dumps often constitute sources o f pollutants or fire-hazards to the nearby localities. ' ' Precipitation data was obtained from the average precipitations reported by World Climate (2003)

Collected gas can be com busted w ith or w ithout energy recovery. This transform s m ethane into carbon dioxide. The energy content in the LFG depends on the fraction o f CH 4 (EPA, 2002). T he energy recovery efficiency from LFG was reported to be 30% (Baky & Eriksson, 2003). Pollutants in leachate are difficult to estimate. "A verage" param eters were adopted (Lee et a l,1994; W arith, M, 2002), but this set can vary w idely from location to location. O ther param eters evaluated are the differences between the leachate from a bioreactor and a typical landfill (Yolo County, 2000). Em issions from LFG w ere adopted from Flodgson et al. Param eter for emissions from LFG after flaring were obtained in the Danish EPA report (Baky & Eriksson).

2.4.1 Emissions From Utilities
T he M SW m anagem ent processes invariably consum e energy. T his energy is provided in the form o f electricity or fossil fuels such as diesel or gas. This section will discuss the m odel used by W A STED to estim ate the em issions from the fossil fuels used in the M SW m anagem ent processes. The em issions generated from electric pow er use are calculated as described in the P ow er G eneration Em issions section o f this docum ent.

Each subm odel in W A STED calculates the am ount o f diesel and gas used. The transport m odel includes the fuels used during w aste collection and all the different waste transfer operations (for exam ple, transporting ashes from the EFW facility to the landfill site). Then, em ission param eters are used to estim ate the pollutants released.

" During the presentation o f this thesis it was noted that describing the power generation scheme for a particular site may prove exceedingly difficult, especially in areas where there is energy trade across jurisdictions.

2.5 Differences between WASTED and other LCA models
A s m entioned in the project introduction, W ASTED is n ot the first life-cycle assessm ent m odel designed to estim ate the impact o f M SW m anagem ent. It w as designed to circum vent the perceived shortcom ings o f other publicly-available LC A models, follow ing two basic premises: ease o f use and adaptability. These tw o prem ises are kept by using w idespread software with an easy-to-use interface (Excel and Visual Basic, instead o f the m ore specialized M atbal used in ORW ARE), allowing the user to modify alm ost all param eters (unlike ISW M ), and by generating diverse environm ental indicators instead o f focusing in one or tw o (such as W A R M 's devotion t^ GH G). W hile we don't believe the m odel is perfect, w e think it is a useful tool for analyzing WM system s - both as a screening tool or for in-depth analyses o f different M SW m anagem ent alternatives.

3. MODEL COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF WM ALTERNATIVES

S .lln tro d u c tio n

Life-cycle assessm ent is being increasingly used to quantify the environmental impacts o f M SW decisions. Different tools have been developed to perform these analyses. This chapter will compare W ASTED to other software tools in order to determine the similarities and differences between them.

Ideally, to evaluate the validity o f W ASTED it would be necessary to compare the results from the model to data obtained from field studies. In practice this is difficult, since data are difficult to obtain on a consistent basis and often consist o f extrapolations from either laboratory tests or short-term field experiments. Instead, W ASTED will be compared to other models: E PA 's W ARM model and the IWM model developed by EPIC-CSR.

This chapter also includes a sensitivity analysis. This type o f analysis not only illustrates the relative contributions o f each solid waste unit operation to the total life cycle, inventory for the selected scenarios, but also helps the researcher determ ine areas o f opportunity to improve the model and to the M SW m anagem ent system.

3.2 Greenhouse Gas Generation from MSW in the City of Toronto.

Toronto is the largest city in Canada. As o f 2001, its population was tallied at 2,481,500 inhabitants (City o f Toronto, 2003b). Garbage generation was determined at 355 kg/year (Toronto Community Foundation, 2003). Approximately 28% o f total waste was diverted from landfilling (Ibid).

T he waste m anagem ent situation for Toronto is quite com plicated since the closure o f the Keele Valley Landfill in December 2002. Since then, the city made an agreement to ship Toronto's garbage to the Carleton Farms Landfill in Sumpter, M ichigan. Although it is widely acknowledged that this is hardly the optim al solution, other alternatives have met w ith much resistance.

Toronto currently em ploys separate collection methods for recyclables, garbage and yard waste. It is estimated that the inhabitants o f Toronto generate an average o f 355 kg o f refuse per year --m uch lower than the 630 kg/y reported by the OECD (1999). The reason for this discrepancy is that the OECD data include all sources o f waste, while the City o f Toronto only reports the household waste collected. This study will use the data reported by the City o f Toronto, since it also includes a complete description o f the waste fractions and an estim ate o f the population growth.

Besides waste generation and characterization data, there are more parameters needed to estimate the emissions generated from the m anagement o f wastes. These parameters include waste collection and transportation distances, recycled material content in raw materials, etc. All the data required for the simulations is not readily available -- individual m odel's default data is used in these cases. A list o f the data available is presented in the next table. These parameters were introduced to the models to generate the emission information for the case study. For the analysis o f the results, no model outputs are assumed to be " valid" -th e comparison will focus on the general tendencies , since the models differ in the system boundaries they have adopted.

3.3 Simulation Results 3.3.1 WARM

The EPA 's Waste Reduction Model requires only the data for waste generation, characterization and recovery rates (either by recycling or com posting). It also allows the user to input the w aste collection and transfer distances. At this tim e, it only estimates the emission o f greenhouse gases to the atmosphere as well as the energy budget for the MSW m anagem ent processes. This specialization m akes it less versatile than the other two models. U nlike the other two models, the W ARM model estim ates GHG generation using landfilling (without CO 2 ) sequestration as the baseline. T he election o f this system

boundary generates emissions credits for all the waste management operations. Table 3.4 presents the results from WARM.

3.3.2 ISWM
T he Integrated Solid Waste M anagem ent Model developed by CSR/EPIC uses a life-cycle approach to estimate a variety o f environmental indicators.

The ISWM model uses the IPCC conventions for CO 2 emissions, m eaning that emissions derived from biogenic'^ sources are not counted. Therefore, CO 2 em itted from compost and landfill would not be counted. However, CH4 is counted since methane is considered the result o f a human activity (IPCC, 1996). EFW emissions are separated according to their origin; plastic is non-biogenic, while the rest o f CO 2 sources are considered CO 2 neutral. However, material recycling and landfilling in this model start from a "zero burden'^" perspective. This has a deep impact on the way this model performs LCA and it will be analyzed in the next section. Table 3.5 presents the results from the ISWM model

3.3.3 WASTED
The W aste Analysis Software Tool for Environm ental Decisions also uses a life cycle approach to estimate emissions. It includes separate entries for biogenie and non biogenic CO 2 sources. Therefore, it presents both the actual CO 2 emissions from each o f

Biogenic sources are renewable, "carbon-neutral" CO2 generators. Examples are paper, yard and food wastes. "zero burden" perspective considers the materials that enter the LCA as they are, with no associated burdens or credits. This contrasts with the WARM model that establishes landfilling as the starting point for study.

WARM manages materials in short tons (1 short ton = 2000 lb = 0.908 MT) was selected to avoid discrepancies from the use o f different parameters for recycling. WARM model estimates GHG generation using landfilling as the baseline process - this means that all the MSW processes generate credits on the basis of carbon sequestration, energy use and emission avoidance, Negative emissions represent credits (avoided emissions)

T he m odels in this case study all treat LCA from a slightly different perspective. This section will com pare their results and explain their differences.

T he m ost im portant param eter in this case study is the com parison o f C O 2 inventories generated by each model. Table 3.7 presents these results.

It is evident from the last figure that w hile W ARM and W ASTED present sim ilar tendencies for the estim ated CO 2 generation from M SW m anagem ent, the ISW M m odel estim ates are w idely different. This is due to the "zero burden" perspective th a t this model uses; this defines the baselines for all the estim ated em issions as zero. In contrast, both W ARM and W ASTED consider the landfilling o f w aste as the baseline. Therefore, the results for recycling (for example) in the W ARM and W ASTED m odels are negative (indicating a reduction in emissions, when com pared to landfilling), w hile they show a positive num ber - net em issions, since the em issions resulting from landfilling are not deducted. This difference in the system boundaries betw een the m odels m akes it difficult to com pare them directly. H ow ever, model com parison is still useful w hen evaluating W M alternatives. This analysis will be shown on section 3.5.

It m ust be stated that since each LCA follow s a different m ethodology, these com parisons are not necessarily representative o f a m odel credibility. It also exem plifies the im portance o f establishing boundaries: even w hile the W ARM m odel does not follow the IPCC guidelines for C O 2 inventories, it is the ISW M that is dissim ilar. This is because both W ASTED and W ARM consider landfilling'^ the basis for assessm ent, w hile the

ISW M m odel starts at "zero" em issions..

Table 3.7 shows that the discrepancies in the C O 2 inventories betw een the W ARM and W ASTED m odels are not overtly large (18.3E06 Vs. 14.2E06 MT, or

22.3% o f the final CO 2 inventory). Furtherm ore, w hen only the non-biogenic sources o f

3.5 Evaluation o f M SW M anagement Alternatives

T he raison d 'être o f environm ental life-cycle assessment is to evaluate process alternatives that m ay result in low er burdens to the environm ent. This section will compare the environm ental im pacts o f different waste m anagem ent alternatives applied to the case study o f the C ity o f Toronto described previously in this chapter. Since the WARM m odel only calculates G H G inventories, the results presented will only deal with this pollutant.

3.5.1 Incineration as an alternative for Toronto
Incineration is a m uch-m aligned WM alternative: it is reported; to be unwieldy, polluting, and to prom ote th e generation o f wastes (GAIA). H ow ever, Tam memm agi describes E FW as an effective com ponent o f integral w aste m anagem ent.

Incineration has several advantages: first, it reduces the quantity o f w aste to less than 10% o f the original volum e. It also generates power that offsets the use o f fossil fuels. I f planned properly, incineration can be used for energy recovery from waste fractions that are difficult to recover in other w ays.'®

For the evaluation o f th is potential WM alternative, incineration rate is arbitrarily set at 30% o f the total w aste stream . Additionally, the residues from w aste sorting in a
Although anti-incineration activists strive for "zero pollution" alternatives based separation, recycling and composting, these options are not always viable due to technological impediments (waxed paper from food packaging is difficult to reuse/recycle; plastics can not be recycled indefinitely), economical, or lifer cle considerations (transporting materials thousands o f km to be reused makes little environmental sense). Though waste reduction is the least polluting alternative, the laws o f thermodynamics do not always favour this premise.

MRF are also considered to be sent for incineration. The energy recovery rate is set at 25% - implying that heat is not recovered, only electricity. Finally, the distance to the EFW facility was set at 100 km for the purpose o f estimating the emissions resulting from the transportation o f waste. These parameters do not reflect any currently studied alternative for M SW m anagement for Toronto; they are only established to provide background for the incineration scenario.

According to the IPCC guidelines, the CO 2 emissions from incineration are accounted in this fashion: the CO 2 resulting from the com bustion o f paper and organic waste is renew able and results in zero net emissions; CO 2 generated by the combustion o f plastic is non-biogenic and should be tallied. This seems to indicate that EFW generates more carbon dioxide than landfilling. Table 3.9 includes the results from this simulation. Results for W ARM are not included since it only calculates CO 2 equivalents.

Although direct CO 2 emissions are higher in the scenario that considers waste incineration, they are offset by a decrease in generated methane. CH4 is a powerful GHG, 21 times m ore potent than CO 2 (IPCC, 1996) and offsets this increase in carbon dioxide production. Both the ISW M and W ASTED models predict a decrease in methane generation when 30% o f the waste is sent for incineration. This is the consequence o f the reduction o f waste undergoing anaerobic decomposition in a landfill.

Since methane is such a powerful GHG, it is necessary to evaluate the combined effect o f CO2 and CH4 emissions. This param eter is denominated CO2 equivalents, and in all models also includes other sources of GHG (such as perfluorocarbons from aluminium production). The results o f this combined GHG inventory are shown next, and the results from W ARM are included. Figure 3.5 shows first the results for the incineration scenario for each o f the three models, and then the results for the "base" WM evaluation.

3.5.2 Analysis of Incineration Results
T he predicted emission inventories for all three LCA models indicate that there is an overall decrease in GHG emissions when 30% o f the total waste is sent for incineration instead o f directly to the landfill. WARM is the most conservative model: it estimates the generation o f 1.86 million tonnes o f CO 2 equivalent'^ credits; the ISW M model estimates credits for 4.69 million tonnes o f CO 2 eq. and the W ASTED model estimates the generation o f 3.11 m illion tonnes o f CO 2 eq. credits. These results are

largely due to the decrease in methane emission from the landfill and to a lesser extent to the reduced waste transfer emissions to the distant landfill in Sumpter, M ichigan. It is important to note that these CO 2 credits are not at the expense of the current recycling or composting operations. Given these considerations, it makes environmental sense to divert som e o f Toronto's waste for energy recovery.

It must be remembered that the results derived from this model cannot be considered a definitive guide --other concerns such as environmental risk assessments, economic considerations and (especially in the case o f waste incineration) public perception need to be addressed in order to implement the optimal solution for waste m anagem ent This is a very im portant limitation o f LCAs - by themselves, they can not indicate an "optim al" solution that considers all the factors needed to m ake a decision.

The results shown in this section demonstrate that the W ASTED model is a useful tool for estimating the environm ental burdens associated with waste m anagement operations. The overall tendencies when evaluating alternative^ for the case study were

the same - this shows that W ASTED is at least consistent with the currently available life-cycle assessment models available for municipal solid waste. T h e discrepancies between the results o f these three m odels are largely due to the different param eters (i.e., power required in an EFW plant, diesel consumed in waste transfer, etc.) chosen to estimate emissions; a table o f this param eters is presented in the A ppendix B. These param eters can be finely tuned for a particular case study in order to m ake the results more representative.

3.6 Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity is the influence that one parameter (independent variable) has on the outputs o f the model (Bjorklund, 2002). A sensitivity analysis can be performed to analyze systematically the effects o f the chosen methods and data on the outcom es o f the study (Ibid).

T he method selected is the tornado diagram analysis. Tornado diagram s illustrate the change in output param eter values when the model is run w ith low and high input parameters (Ibid). The results are then sorted in decreasing order o f sensitivity (the most sensitive parameter will be on top).

T he base case study consists o f a fictitious scenario, and the data used is arbitrary. The parameters for this sim ulation are presented on table 3.12

O bviously, in this case all the param eters show reduced em ission (or increased credits, as the case m ight be) for the high fuel efficiency scenario^^. It can be perceived that fuel efficiency has a very high impact on the total emitted photochem ical pollutants (VOCs +N O x) ant the total energy balance in the model. Heavy metal em issions were not altered significantly; the m odel utilizes param eters for "clean" truck fuels.

Since energy consum ption and photochem ical pollutant em issions are quite sensitive to changes in this param eter, it is recom m ended to choose fuel efficiency parameters that reflect the studied scenario most closely.

"The parameters used were 5x fuel efficiency (for the high efficiency scenario), and 1/3 o f the fuel efficiency (for the low efficiency scenario). These parameters are found in section 2.3.2.

4. CONCLUSIONS

Life-cycle assessm ent m odels are useful tools to estimate the environm ental burdens o f a product or activity. U nder this light, W ASTED is valuable: by using a "cradle-to-grave" approach it is possible to obtain a comprehensive understanding o f the environm ental implications o f w aste m anagem ent decisions.

W ASTED is not the first m odel devised to analyze the environm ental implications o f waste m anagem ent; however, W ASTED attem pts to build on the current publiclyavailable LC A program s and overcom e their lim itations, especially those regarding ease o f use and flexibility. The first o f these objectives is met by using a visual interface; this interface guides the user throughout the different screens that describe the WM alternatives in an intuitive and straightforw ard manner. Flexibility is attained by allowing the user to effect extensive m odifications to the default set o f data included in the model. In this m anner, W ASTED can be used to " screen" a W M scenario and, by finely tuning the model param eters, to perform detailed, site-specific analyses.

All LCAs depend on large am ounts o f data. These data support the different submodels used in W ASTED to estim ate the em issions generated and the energy use for a particular case study. The data used in W ASTED come from very diverse sources with
\

varying quality; therefore, it is hard to evaluate the credibility o f the results o f the model when param eters are extrapolated, averaged or otherw ise estim ated from other studies instead o f m easured directly and applied to a particular analysis. T his is a very serious

issue, given the large number o f variables involved^^. The sensitivity analysis dem onstrates that the model results can vary significantly even w ith m oderate changes in a small num ber o f m odel parameters, especially when they are related to the distribution o f wastes across the different WM processes (such as recycling). This illustrates the importance o f using the best available data to minimize the discrepancies betw een the m odel and reality. To better understand the relationship between dependent (output) and independent (input) variables, it is recommended that each case study is accom panied by a sensitivity analysis, especially w hen the independent variables are subject to high levels uncertainty.

Furthermore, it is important to note that although W ASTED is useful to compare the overall environmental efficiency o f different WM scenarios, it can not prescribe the " optimal" w aste m anagement alternative. W aste m anagement is very com plex and environm ental considerations are only one o f the factors that m ust be considered to m ake a decision; geographic, economic, social and political factors (to name a few) should all be analyzed in order to determine w hat is the best choice for the m anagement o f w astes in a particular site.

It is hard work to collect and codify all the data needed to support W ASTED. Further efforts are required in order to obtain and characterize the data used to support the different submodels in W ASTED, and to expand and improve the default m odel

Currently, WASTED allows the user to, modify more than 600 different parameters. This is a good example o f the old computer programmer's adage; "garbage goes in - garbage comes out" regarding the quality o f the data used for simulations.

source depletion occur. Recycling, composting and energy recovery result in the production o f resources. These are tallied in the form o f energy and emissions "credits", to account for the avoided emissions and energy use. Landfilling is a special case since its emissions occur very slowly - spanning hundreds o f years for some pollutants. Two time frames are adopted for landfills: gaseous emissions are calculated disregarding reaction kinetics, but factoring carbon storage from biological wastes. For emissions derived from landfill leachate a surveyable time frame o f 100 years has been used; this period may be modified by the user. After the surveyable time has expired the landfill is considered to be inert.
