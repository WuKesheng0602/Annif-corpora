STABILIZATION OF POLYSTANNANES VIA ALKYNE INSERTION Master of Science, 2010 Aman Ullah Khan Molecular Science Ryerson unversity

Abstract:
Di-n-butylstannane, polydi-n-butylstannane and the acetylene inserted

carbodistannanes were prepared using the methods described in literature. Their structures were confirmed by NMR analysis. Finally acetylene inserted

polydibutylstannane, was prepared in a similar fashion and was evident from its unique
119

Sn NMR chemical shift values that were similar to that for ( n-Bu)3SnCH=CHSn(n-

Bu)3. A highly unusual head to head dimer (hexamethyl-1,4-diphenyldistannyl-1,3butadiene) was obtained and characterized by X-ray crystallography. The quantitative conversion of (n-Bu)3SnH into (n-Bu)6Sn2 was achieved by heating the neat (n-Bu)3SnH under different conditions. This route was extended to a secondary stannane, (nBu)2SnH2 which yielded evidence (NMR) for H(n-Bu)2SnSn(n-Bu)2H, polystannane [(nBu)2Sn]n and various cyclic stannanes [(n-Bu)2Sn]n
= 5,6.

Further evidence for [(n-

Bu)2Sn]n was afforded by GPC where a broad, moderate molecular weight, but highly dispersed polymer was obtained (Mw = 1.8 104 Da, PDI = 6.9) and a characteristic UVVis absorbance (max) of 370 nm observed.

CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION
1.1 Group 14 and Group 14 Polymers:
The elements of Group 14 have a clear trend from nonmetallic to metallic behaviour. While carbon is clearly non-metallic, silicon and germanium are considerably semimetallic with tin and lead being clearly metallic. Carbon atoms are unable to expand their valence shell beyond the octet, while the other elements in the family experience hypervalency due to the availability of valence shell d orbitals in Si and Ge and d and f orbitals for Sn and Pb. The empty orbitals are able to accept electrons from nucleophiles. There is a significant decrease in tendency towards catenation upon descending in Group 14 from carbon to lead. This is evident by the enormous number of known linear and branched polyalkanes, numerous examples of polysilanes, some polygermanes, a few polystannanes and to date, no polyplumbanes. This significant decrease in catenation can be explained partially in terms of the decreasing strength of catenated bond; i.e., C-C = 347 kJ/mol, Si-Si = 220 kJ/mol, Ge-Ge = 170 kJ/mol, Sn-Sn = 150 kJ/mol and Pb-Pb = 86 kJ/mol.[1] Furthermore, there is decrease in the strength of single bonds between Group 14 and other elements from carbon to lead (Table 1.1).[1] The strength of Group 14 bonds to some extent is parallel to the covalent character of these bonds. Most compounds of Group 14 elements are tetravalent with a trend towards divalency with increasing atomic number.

Tin is the first metallic element of Group 14. It is poorly malleable and only partially oxidized in air due to the formation of a transparent oxide layer at its surface. [2] Tin is usually found with an oxidation number of +2 or +4 due to its position in the periodic table. For example, SnCl2 is a stable hygroscopic compound while stannylenes, SnR2 (R = alky or aryl), are highly reactive species similar to carbenes. Organotin compounds have found a variety of applications as polymerization catalysts and stabilizers, herbicides or biocides[3] and selective uses in medicines though in recent years have found less favour due to environmental considerations. In industry, they are commonly used for the stabilization of poly(vinyl chloride)[10,4], the catalytic formation of polyurethanes and the cold temperature vulcanization of silicon polymers. Their biological properties include uses as antifouling paints on ships (now banned by legislation), in wood preservatives and as agricultural fungicides and insecticides. In medicine, several organotin compounds have shown promise in cancer therapies and in the treatment of fungal infections. [5]

2

The environmental interest towards the exclusion of organotin compounds in polymers is due to the federal level legislation in many countries that has largely curtailed the use of monomeric organotin compounds in paints and coatings. It is widely accepted that through migration of tin species they inhibit and kill nearby plant and animal life. Chemically bound organotin has, however been permitted by legislation. Thus there is activity to create non-migrating chemically bound organotin materials. The commercial importance of Group 14 polymers is dominated by silicon chemistry. At this time, there are relatively few uses of Ge or Sn containing polymers [612]

with the exception of organotin compounds that are used industrially as

polymerization catalysts. Polysiloxanes represent the largest bulk use of Group 14 polymers and represent the highest worldwide sales for inorganic polymers. Pb containing polymers rank last in the Group 14 series due to their poor solubility, the lack of availability of suitable monomers and their potential toxicity.

1.2 Polystannanes: 1.2.1 History of Tin Compounds/Polymers:
Tin is the only metallic element reported to form organometallic polymers with a backbone consisting entirely of metal atoms covalently bonded to each other. These are referred to as polystannanes and are expected to have significant and useful electrical properties because of the delocalization of electrons along the tin backbone.[13]

Compounds containing hydrocarbon groups bonded to a central tin atom are referred to as organotin compounds or stannanes. The first organotin compound was reported by Sir Edward Frankland in 1849.[14] The first preparation of oligo- or polystannanes was published by LÃ¶wing in 1852. [15] He prepared oligo(diethylstannane)s or poly(diethylstannane)s by reacting iodoethane with Sn/K or a Sn/Na alloy. This is an exothermic reaction done in the presence of quartz sand to control the reaction rate. Cahours obtained similar products from a Wurtz type reaction. [16, 17] "Stannic ethyl" as a polymeric compound with the composition (SnC2 H5)n was also formulated in 1858.[18] In 1917, GrÃ¼ttner[19] reinvestigated results on hexaethyldistannanes reported by Ladenberg
[20]

(1870) and confirmed the presence of Sn-Sn bonds. He predicted that tin could form a

chain like polymeric material. Until 1900, only 37 papers were published on organotin compounds. In 1903, Pope and Peachey described the preparation of a number of simple and mixed tetraalkyl stannanes, and of triphenyltin, from Grignard reagents and tin tetrachloride or alkyltin halides.[21,22] In 1943, Clauson Kass postulated that the yellow colour of diphenyltin is due to its polymeric nature.[23] A bathochromic shift of the wavelength at maximum absorption was established in the case of oligo(dibutylstannane)s having up to fifteen Sn atoms.[13,24] In 1961, the previously reported hexameric diethyltin was identified as a cyclic sixmembered oligostannane.[25] After few years, the formation of crystalline cyclicnonamers and waxy cyclic-hexamers of "diethyltin" were also isolated. [26] In 1992, the Wurtz coupling of dibutyldichlorostannane was reported to yield both linear poly(dibutylstannane) as well as oligomers. [27] In 1996 Molloy et al.[28] identified milder Wurtz conditions to isolate very high molecular weight polystannane.

5

DrÃ¤ger and co-workers in 1987 showed that linear oligostannanes with up to six tin atoms can be prepared and that the -* UV-Vis transition moves dramatically to lower energy as the chain length is increased. This led him to propose the term "molecular metals" for prospective high molecular weight analogues. [29] Polystannanes are of much interest because of the involvement of their -delocalization backbone and - overlap when for instance they are coupled with arenes and acetylenes. Polystannanes would be expected to have more  delocalized structures than polysilanes and polygermanes.

6

1.2.2 Synthesis of Polystannanes:
The following three strategies can be used for the synthesis of polystannanes: 1) Wurtz coupling 2) Catalytic dehydrogenation 3) Electrochemical coupling

Scheme 1.1 Three common routes used to prepare polystannanes: (1) Polymerization of tin dichloride by Wurtz like reactions, (2) Electrochemical coupling of tin dichlorides and (3) Catalytic dehydropolymerization of tin dihydrides.

In 1992, Zou and co-workers reported the first synthesis of high molecular weight organotin polymers. This was done by using the Wurtz-type coupling of nBu2SnCl2 in the presence of the ether 15-crown-5.[27]

7

Figure 1.2 Schematic representation of the structure of 15-crown-5

Reaction 1.2.1

Molloy and co-workers have improved the preparation of [nBu2Sn]n by carefully controlling the reaction involving nBu2SnCl2 with a fine sodium dispersion in the presence of 15-crown-5 in toluene at 60oC for 4 h.[28]

Reaction 1.2.2

The formation of cyclic products such as [ nBu2Sn]5 and [nBu2Sn]6 occur when the reaction time was increased. The polymers possessed high molecular weights (~106 Da)

8

as determined by GPC and were further characterized by distinguished between polymers and higher cyclic oilgomers.

119

Sn NMR which readily

Mochida et al.[30] synthesized polystannanes using SmI2 or alkali earth metal (Mg, Ca) vapor solvent co-condensates under mild conditions. The molecular weights for these polystannanes are typically lower than those prepared by Wurtz coupling methods.

Reaction 1.2.3

Catalytic dehydrogenation has been shown to be the most successful strategy for the monomers of the type R2SnH2.[31-34] These monomers are prepared by using a two step method involving the comproportionation reaction between equimolar R 4Sn and SnCl4 to produce two equivalents of R2SnCl2 which is then reduced by LiAlH4 to yield the corresponding dihydrides. These dihydrides are typically both air and temperature sensitive. Tilley prepared a series of poly(dialkylstannane)s from the catalytic

dehydrogenation of R2SnH2 using an organometallic zirconocene catalyst such as Cp2ZrMe2. The polymerization is initiated by dropwise addition of monomer to the catalyst. In these reactions, polymeric materials along with cyclic byproducts are formed. The main cyclic materials formed are the five-membered [nR2Sn]5 along with small amounts of the six-membered [nR2Sn]6. The molecular weights of the

9

poly(dialkylstannane)s are considerably high as, for example, with H[nBu2Sn]nH (Mw = 46,000 Da) or H[nOct2Sn]nH (Mw = 92, 600 Da).[31]

Reaction 1.2.4

Poly(diarylstannane)s can also be synthesized by the same route as that of poly(dialkylstannane)s. This involves a three step procedure to first prepare the tetraarylstannanes, comproportionation to the dichlorostannane and finally a conversion to polymerizable tin dihydrides.

Reaction 1.2.5

10

Like dialkylstannanes, dehydrogenation of diarylstannanes (Ar2SnH2) is afforded by the use of metallocene catalysts. High molecular weight polymeric products along with cyclics are formed. Separation of the polymers from the cyclic rings is done by precipitation into polar solvents such as methanol.

Reaction 1.2.6

The moderate molecular weight poly(diarylstannane)s reported by Tilley possess relatively high polydispersities. For example, H[( p-tBu-C6H4)2Sn]nH was isolated with a molecular weight of Mw = 56,000 Da and a PDI = 3.35.[32] Okano et al.[34] reported the first electrochemical synthesis of [n-Bu2Sn]n 5 and [n-Oct2Sn]n by using a cell consisting of a Pt cathode, Ag anode, [n-Bu4N]+[ClO4]- as supporting electrolyte and dry DME as solvent.

Reaction 1.2.7

11

The highest molecular weight obtained by these methods for (n-Bu2Sn)n was Mw = 1.09 Ã 104 Da (PDI = 2.6) and a max = 381 nm. Poly(dioctylstannane) [n-Oct2Sn]n was also isolated with a Mw = 0.59 Ã 104 Da (PDI = 1.7) and a max = 378 nm. In 2005 Caseri et al.[35] presented a synthetic route to prepare 5 of relatively high molecular weight (Mw = 2.0 Ã 104 Da) through catalytic dehydropolymerization of 13 using RhCl(PPh3)3 14 as a catalyst. The polymer prepared by this method is entirely free of cyclic oligomers.

Reaction 1.2.8

et

alkylphenyl)stannane)s using 14 as catalyst, provided that the phenyl moieties are separated from the tin atom by at least two methylene groups. The poly(di( alkylphenyl)stannane)s obtained were likewise free of any cyclic impurities.

12

Reaction 1.2.9

A copolymer, poly(n-dibutylstannane-co-di(3-propylphenyl)stannane, was also produced from the addition of the catalyst 14 to a mixture of (PhC3H6)2SnH2 15 and 13 in CH2Cl2. Reaction 1.2.10

13

1.2.3 Characterization of Polystannanes:
The techniques commonly used for the characterization of polystannanes are NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography and thermal analysis.

1.2.3a Nuclear magnetic resonance:
NMR spectroscopy is a useful tool for the characterization of polystannanes. Linear polymers and cyclic oligomers can be easily distinguished from each other by their distinct 119Sn NMR chemical shift values (Table 1.3). 119Sn NMR chemical shifts for the poly(dialkylstannane)s are typically around -190 ppm with the exception of poly(diethylstannane)s with a resonance at -172.2 ppm. The chemical shift values for the corresponding cyclic oligomers are shifted to higher field by approximately 10 ppm. The
119

Sn NMR shifts for the poly(diarylstannane)s are also found  -190 ppm except for

18

methods produced polydialkylstannanes of lower molecular weight, but more narrowly dispersed.

1.2.3c Thermal analysis:
Thermal properties are important as functional polymers are expected to work at various temperatures. The instruments typically used to study the thermal behaviour of materials are thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All polystannanes are reasonably thermally stable. They show a maximum rate of decomposition between 280-300oC in N2 atmosphere, but in air the temperature range was 240-300oC (Table 1.7). Thermal stability of poly(dialkylstannane)s does not depend on the length of the alkyl chain.

The polymer H[(p-nHex-C6H4)2Sn]nH was stable up to 250oC but incurred a 79% weight loss between 265-310 oC. The polymer H[(o-Et-p-C6H4)2Sn]nH was stable to 200

C but showed a rapid weight loss between 330-390 oC. Comparatively H[(p-nBuO-

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the polystannanes: Polystannanes with shorter side chains (C2-C4) showed one thermally reversible phase glass transition (T1) but polystannanes with longer alkyl chain show a second thermally reversible liquid crystalline phase transition ( T2) in the temperature range between -50 and +120 Â°C (Fig. 1.3a, Table 1.8).

It was commonly observed for polymeric species that the transition temperatures recorded upon cooling were lower (10-30 Â°C) than those transitions found during heating

20

and T2 increased as the length of the alkyl group increased, but there was no systematic trend in T1. Qualitative determination of the phase transitions of polystannanes were studied using a cross polarized optical microscope. The selected polystannanes were also investigated with X-ray diffraction. All polymers showed birefringent film behaviour below the first phase transition temperature. There was no evidence of change in birefringence upon heating above the first phase transition of thin films of poly(alkylstannane)s with C2-C5 alkyl chain even up to 100Â°C. (nHex2Sn)n and (nDod2Sn)n, showed significantly weaker birefringence above the first transition temperature and completely disappeared for ( nOct2Sn)n above T1. For (nHex2Sn)n and (nDod2Sn)n, birefringence was not seen above the second transition temperatures. (nHex2Sn)n, (nOct2Sn)n and (nDod2Sn)n became significantly birefringent only at the temperatures lower than the first phase transition (Table 1.7). It can be concluded from the optical microscope images that all samples, except (nOct2Sn)n, still retain some order after the first phase transition. Heating above T2 caused a loss in orientation, which was unrecoverable by cooling. The initial orientation was unchanged when the sample was heated above the first transition temperature. The transition temperatures obtained for ( nHex2Sn)n, (nOct2Sn)n and (nDod2Sn)n were in general agreement with transition temperatures found in DSC thermograms.

1.2.4 Structural and electronic properties of Polystannanes
The term "Molecular metals" for polystannanes was first proposed by Adams and DrÃ¤ger [29] in 1987. This is based on the study of a series of oligomers 20(a-d) (Fig 1.4).

Reaction 1.2.11

They isolated the tri-20a, tetra-20b, penta-20c and hexastannanes 20d by varying the molar ratio of the starting materials, solvent and the concentration. X-ray structure analysis showed that bulky, electron rich substituents on the Sn-Sn units causes an increase in bond length. The Sn-Sn bond length for the central bond in 20d is 296.6 pm (Fig.1.4), the longest reported for an oligostannane. A strong absorption maximum with a reasonable red shift was exhibited by UV spectra with increasing chain length. The increase in chain length decreases the HOMO/LUMO energy difference.

23

Figure 1.4 Molecular structures of 20(a-d) with average Sn-Sn bond length (pm) and SnSn-Sn bond angles.[29]

A comparison of the bonding nature of polymers with heavier tin atoms in the backbone to the polysilanes showed that they have more diffuse bonding orbitals than silicon in polysilanes. Polystannanes are expected to exhibit the following properties due to greater -conjugation. a) Narrower band gaps (4 eV for polysilanes) b) Increased metallic character

24

c) Enhanced photochemical and thermochromic behaviours d) Lower Sn-Sn bond strength vs. Si-Si [37] Poly(dialkylstannane)s have max absorbance values in the range of 380-400 nm from the -* transitions along its backbone. The max value of poly(dialkylstannane)s increases as the molecular weight increases up to a limiting value. The comparison of poly(dialkylstannane)s with corresponding polysilanes showed that -* transitions for poly(dialkylstannane)s are 70 nm red shifted [32]. It is evident from the max values (Table 1.9) for poly(diarylstannane)s that they are 50 nm red shifted with respect to poly(dialkystannane)s. This is likely due to the presence of - mixing between the aryl ligands and tin atoms. Table 1.9 UV spectroscopic data for polystannanes [31, 32] Polymer H[(p-tBu-C6H4)2Sn]nH H[(p-nHex-C6H4)2Sn]nH H[(o-Et-p-C6H4)2Sn]nH H[(p-nBuO-C6H4)2Sn]nH H[(o-Et-p-nBuO-C6H3)2Sn]nH H{[(p-(Me3Si)2-C6H4)2]Sn}nH (nBu2Sn)n[31] (nBu2Sn)n (nHex2Sn)n[31] (nOct2Sn)n  max(nm) 432(THF) 436(THF) 468(film) 448(THF) 506(THF) 450(THF) 384(THF) 365(THF) 384(THF) 388(THF)

The reversible thermochromic behaviour of polystannanes is visibly evident as a discoloration of the material occurs upon warming above room temperature. UV-vis spectrometry showed a change in the absorption maximum between 384 to 369 nm moving from 30 and 40oC, respectively in a toluene solution. Tilley[31] and co-workers measured the conductivity of poly(alkylstannane)s at room temperature by doping the film of H(nBu2Sn)nH and H(nOct2Sn)nH by exposure to

25

SbF5 vapour for 3 and 30 h, respectively. The conductivities measured by four-point probe method were 10-2 and 0.3 Scm-1, respectively. These results may be improved by using a milder dopant such as SbF3 which is less corrosive towards the Sn-Sn bonds. Matthijis P. de Haas[38] and co-workers measured charge mobility of 5 in the crystalline solid and mesophase by using the pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity technique. The values of mobility were 0.027 and 0.097cm2V-1s-1 for meso (M) and crystalline solid phase (K) respectively. The decrease in mobility at the transitions from K to M is due to the structural disorder on melting of the alkyl side chain. Caseri[36] and co-workers measured the conductivity of the poly(di( alkylphenyl)stannane)s. At 300K the conductivity of poly(di-(3-propylphenyl)stannane) was 3 Ã 10-8 Scm-1. An increase in the conductivity was observed by increasing the temperature, characteristic of a semi-conducting material.

26

1.3 Insertion of alkynes into Sn-Sn bonds
Most organometallic metal-metal bonds are not as stable as their elemental forms. The reasons for this may be due to the poor overlap of the atomic orbitals and low electronegativity. In case of tin, its large size and low electronegativity result in Sn-Sn bonds that are sensitive to moisture and light. The backbone of polystannanes may be stabilized by inserting alkynes between tin atoms. Van der Kerk et al. prepared a series of organotin polymers with Sn-C bonds in the main chain through the polyaddition of organotin dihydrides with dienes or diynes.[3942]

These polymers have poor overall physical properties like low glass transition

temperatures and poor solubilities. The preparation of polymers containing tin-alkyne bonds in the backbone are interesting as these bonds are known to be quite weak. Labadie et al. synthesized alkylstannylene polymers by coupling of aminostannanes and terminal alkynes. [43]

27

Reaction 1.3.2

Mitchell et al.[45] reported the Pd(PPh3)4 (27) catalyzed addition of hexaalkylditins R6Sn2 (R = Me, Et, n-Bu) to acetylene and 1-alkynes. The solvent used for acetylene insertion reactions was dioxane.

Reaction 1.3.3

Yamashita et al.[46] reported the use of the Pd(dba)2-P(OCH2)3CEt (34) catalyst system for the insertion of acetylenes into Si-Si bonds of non-activated disilanes or trisilanes.

28

Reaction 1.3.4

Max Herberhold et al., carried out distannation of non-terminal alkynes which provides an elegant route for the insertion of alkynes between the tin atoms of a tin bridged [2] ferrocenophane. Distannation of many alkynes has been shown to proceed under mild conditions by employing Pt(0)-mediated 39 catalysis.[47]

1.4 Distannanes and Oligostannanes
Hexaorganodistannanes are a convenient source of stannyl radicals and have found applications in organic chemistry in a variety of reduction reactions [48] in addition to their utility in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling processes.[49] Distannanes also

serve as useful models for polystannanes. [29] Industrially, distannanes show considerable bacterial and fungicidal activity and were previously used as wood preservatives. [50] The distannane class of compounds are the tin analogues of ethanes but possess a Sn-Sn bond that is comparatively weaker (154 kJ/mol vs. 356 kJ/mol) and longer (2.80 vs. 1.54 Ã) than typical C-C bonds.[51,52] Organodistannanes are generally thermally stable but are chemically sensitive to the presence of oxygen (more so than that of water, mild acids or alkalis) and can readily decompose to form stannoxanes (i.e. R 3Sn-O-SnR3) such as 42 (Figure 1.5).[53]

Figure 1.5 Various Stannanes Distannanes can be synthesized directly from the dehydrogenative dimerization of tin hydrides (e.g., 43, 44) with either amines or alkoxides acting as the catalyst. [54] Organotin hydrides can also be dehydrogenatively coupled using transition metal catalysts such as Pd(PPh3)4, PdCl2(NCMe)2[55] or ruthenium-allenylidene complexes.[56] Electrochemical preparations of R3SnSnR3 (e.g., R = n-C4H9 45, C6H5 46, p-CH3C6H4-, C6H5CH2-) compounds involving the reduction of R3SnX (X = Cl, NO3, H, SPh, OCHO,

31

OCOCH3, etc.) have also been reported. [57,58] Chemically, 46 can be prepared via the reductive coupling of triphenyltin derivatives (Ph3SnX where X = Cl, I, or OH) in a THF/aq. NH4Cl solution containing Zn metal.[59,60] The first high yield synthesis of 45 was reported by Sawyer[61] from the treatment of distannoxane 42 with 43 at 100oC for several days (Reaction 1.4.1).

Reaction 1.4.1

Alternative methods for the synthesis of 45 from 42 include reactions with formic acid[62], or reductions utilizing Mg, Na, or K metal in THF[63] solution; NaBH4[64] or SmI2[65] in HMPA has also been used. Recently, an improvement in the synthesis of 45[66] was reported which involves a high temperature (200oC) catalyst free protocol using 42 and 42 at a molar ratio of 1:2.2. This method gives 45 in a quantitative yield. Interestingly, these same authors also reported a lower yield (52%) of 45 by simply heating 43 at a lower temperature (150oC) for 6 h under vacuum (Reaction 1.4.2).

1.5 Molecular Modeling of Oligostannanes:
Polystannanes consist of a backbone of Â­bonded Sn atoms. They are of considerable interest due to their unusual electronic properties. Short chain oligostannanes (n  6) which can be used as models for polystannanes have been both synthesized and characterized. Sita et al.
[67]

isolated and collected the experimental data of , -difunctional

polystannane oligomers represented by X-(Bu2Sn)n-X (X = 2-ethoxyethyl, n = 3-15). The experimental data in this report was used for comparison with the calculated data obtained by Sandorfy using the HÃ¼ckel molecular orbital (HMO) approximation at the semiempirical level. It revealed that the HMO theory developed for conjugated organic systems was a poor choice for oligo- and polystannanes. A modified Sandorfy HMO theory was then employed by setting m = 0.75 (m is the measure of degree of delocalization of the molecular orbitals of the backbone, m = gem/vic). A good correlation was found between the observed transition frequency (cm-1) curve of , polystannane oligomers 49 and a plot of calculated HOMO and LUMO energy

difference with the increasing chain length.

Sita et al. successfully applied the Sandorfy HMO approximation to model the electronic structure of long chain polytstannane.

1.6 Molecular Modeling Approaches:
Various models can be used for the geometrical optimization of equilibrium geometries of molecules including 1. Density functional model (DFT) 2. Semi-empirical model (PM3, AM1) and 3. Molecular Mechanic model [Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF)]

34

The above models have been typically used for the optimization of various organic and inorganic structures with energies of the molecules were calculated only by density functional method.

1.6.1 Density Functional Model:
The density functional theory is based on the fact that the sum of the exchange and correlation energies of a uniform electron gas can be calculated exactly knowing only its density. Density functional models are applicable to molecules of moderate size (50100 atoms). Pseudopotentials: Calculations can be simplified by only considering the valence electrons and replacing the core electrons by some form of potential. This technique is used for calculations of molecules having one or more heavy elements, particularly transition metals.

1.6.2. Semi-Empirical Models:
Semi-empirical models are based on Hartree-Fock models. In these models the size of the problem is reduced, first because the treatment is restricted to valence electrons only and the core electrons are ignored. Next, the basis set is restricted to a minimal valence only representation. Parameters for PM3 for transition metals are used for the reproduction of equilibrium geometries. The AM1 and PM3 models have different parameters but use the same approximations.

1.6.3. Molecular Mechanic model:
Molecular mechanics (MM) consider the molecules as "bonded atoms", which ideal geometry have been distorted due to non-bonded van der Waals and Coulombic

35

interactions. This is a fundamental difference between the MM models and quantum chemical models, because in quantum chemical models there is no reference to chemical bonding. The two reasons for the success of molecular mechanics are the high degree of transferability of geometrical parameters from one molecule to another and predictable dependence of the parameters on atomic hybridization. A more complex force field calculation known as MMFF, was developed at Merck Pharmaceuticals. This method provides a better quantitative account of molecular geometry and conformation. However, it is limited in scope to common organic systems and biopolymers. MMF is a simple model and the molecular mechanics calculations can conveniently be performed on molecules composed of several thousand atoms. MM calculations are less time consuming, which permits extensive conformational searching on molecules having between 100-200 atoms, such as polymers. This is one of the most important applications of this model. MMF is limited to the description of equilibrium geometries and equilibrium conformations, and does not provide any information about atomic bonding. Currently available force fields are not able to handle non-equilibrium forms, especially reaction transition states. The success of MM models would be doubtful in describing the structures and conformations of "new" molecules which are outside the range of parameterization.

1.6.4 Calculated (gas phase) Vs Crystallographic Data:
Equilibrium geometries for a large number of molecules have been determined in the solid (crystalline) phase by X-ray diffraction.[68,
69]

These have more uncertainties

than the gas-phase structures due to thermal motions in the crystal. These calculations are reliable for bond lengths and angles to within 0.02 Ã and one or two degrees,

36

respectively. In case of geometrical parameters involving hydrogen atoms, the X-ray experiment actually locates areas of high electron density and for hydrogen atoms these are not precisely the same as their nuclear positions. Often it shortens the bonds involving hydrogen by one or two tenths of an Ã. It should also be considered that the geometries of molecules in crystals are not the same as those of isolated molecules in the gas phase. In case of crystals, the molecules will be influenced by intermolecular crystal packing forces. Finally, it needs to be stated that calculated geometries are also subject to errors in precision. The reason of this error may be the incomplete convergence of the geometric optimization procedure. Within these limits, comparisons between the experimental and calculated values can be used to judge the quality of the calculations, although there is always the chance of error in the experimental structure.

37

1.7 Objectives:
The main objectives of this thesis are to synthesize light, air and moisture stable tin containing model compounds and polymers. Target compounds of this research include: i) ii) iii) iv) Preparation of tin polymers Preparation of alkyne inserted model dimer compounds Preparation of an alkyne inserted polycarbostannanes Investigate the catalyst free dehydrocoupling reactions of stannanes

The proposed steps to achieve the objectives are as follows: 1) Synthesize and characterize polydibutylstannane 2) Insert acetylene and acetylene derivatives into the Sn-Sn bonds to stabilize the polymer. 3) Explore thermal and catalyst free dehydrocoupling of simple model stannanes 4) Model oligostannanes by using different methods of optimization For the modelling effort, the purpose of this study is to calibrate molecular modelling approaches for oligostannanes 20(a-d) using the available structural data for comparison. By utilizing the optimized geometries, the electronic structure of oligostannanes will then be investigated using density functional method.

CHAPTER TWO Experimental
2.1 General:
1

H NMR, 13C {1H} NMR and 119Sn {1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker

Avance 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. 1H spectra were referenced to the residual solvent peaks in the deuterated solvents while the
13

C spectra are referenced internally to the

deuterated solvent resonances which are in turn referenced to SiMe 4 ( = 0 ppm), while
119

Sn was referenced to SnMe4 ( = 0 ppm). UV-Vis measurements were carried out in

THF solutions using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 40 spectrometer. Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a Viscotek Triple Model 302 Detector system equipped with a Refractive Index Detector (RI), a four capillary differential viscometer (VISC), a right angle (90Âº) laser light scattering detector (0 = 670 nm) and a low angle (7Â°) laser light scattering detector. GPC columns were calibrated versus polystyrene standards (American Polymer Standards). A flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. was used with ACS grade THF as the eluent. GPC samples were prepared using 3-10 mg of each polymer per mL THF, and filtered using a 0.45 m filter. All samples were run with and without UVA (conc.  0.001 M) for comparison. All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere using Schlenk techniques unless otherwise described. Bruker-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer was used to obtain the X-ray information of the crystal structures. Thermally driven de-hydrocoupling reactions were performed under a variety of conditions in Schlenk flasks, including in an inert N2 atmosphere or in a sealed Schlenk flask placed under a static reduced pressure (closed) or

39

finally in a Schlenk flask exposed to dynamic reduced pressure (open). Pressures were measured using a mercury manometer attached to the Schlenk line.

( n-Bu)6Sn2 (45) and Ph6Sn2 (46) were purchased from Strem and used as reference samples. ( n-Bu)2SnH2 (13) was prepared from 1 and LiAlH4 according to published literature preparations. [31,70] Solvents were dried by standard procedures prior to use.

2.3 Polystannanes:
2.3.1 Synthesis of (n-Bu)2SnH2 13:
This reaction was carried out in an inert N2 atmosphere. A sample of n-Bu2SnCl2 1 (7.8 g, 25.67 mmol) was weighed in glove box and then dissolved in ether. To a suspension of LiAlH4 in diethyl ether at 0oC, was added drop-wise, an ether solution of 1 over a 30 min time period. The reaction mixture was then stirred for an additional 2 h. The ice bath was removed and the reaction mixture quenched with 50 mL of chilled deoxygenated water. The contents of the reaction flask were then transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer separated. The aqueous layer was then washed with 3  20 mL of ether. All the organic layers were then collected and dried over CaCl2 (2 h),

The product of this distillation was then analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. The 1H and
119

Sn NMR spectra

revealed that 43 had been consumed and converted (Recovered yield: 97%) into (nBu)3SnSn(n-Bu)3 45. The NMR data provided here are in good agreement with literature values. [64, 66, 72]

2.5.2 Small scale thermal dehydrocoupling of 43 under reduced pressure (open system)

2.6 Molecular Modeling of Oligostannanes:
The molecular modeling was done for the DrÃ¤ger oligostannanes 20(a-d), distannanes and alkyne inserted distannanes using different methods of geometric optimization. The energy calculation of these molecules was performed using density functional method (DFT). The basis set used in all calculations was the LACVP* basis set (Spartan 08 V1.1.1) in corresponding the LAN2DZD core potentials (pseudopotential) on heavy atoms and 6-31G* basis set on lighter atoms. The density function form used was B3LYP. Geometry optimization and energy calculations were carried out at the same level of theory.

CHAPTER THREE Results and Discussion
To achieve the objectives of this research, polydibutylstannane 5 was synthesized from di-n-butylstannane 13 using a previously reported method.[35] To reach the eventual goal of a stabilized inserted polystannane, alkyne inserted model distannanes were explored and successfully prepared using literature routes. The same method was also successfully explored for the insertion of acetylene into 5. A further objective was to explore the radically driven dehydrocoupling of simple stannanes as a potential route to dimer and polymer. The final objective was to re-examine the series of compounds that DrÃ¤ger prepared and model the structures using DFT method. The results obtained during this research are described below in detail.

3.1 Polystannanes: 3.1.1 Di-n-butylstannane 13:
Compound 13 was obtained in good yield using the preparation method

(Reaction 3.1.1) described by Tille y's group.[31,70] During this synthesis, it was observed that CaCl2, used as drying agent should be granular in nature and of the highest grade available. When commercial grade CaCl2 was used, 1H and
119 119

Sn NMR spectra (1H,

Sn) of the resulting product indicated additional unwanted resonances.

54

Reaction 3.1.1

3.1.2 Poly di-n-butylstannane 5:
The method used for the polymerization of 13 was the same as described in the recent literature.[35] This involved the polymerization of 13 to 5 by catalytic

dehydrogenation using Wilkinson's catalyst (Reaction 3.1.2).

Reaction 3.1.2

Due to the unstable nature (ambient light degradation) of the resulting polymer, we were unsuccessful in establishing the absolute molecular weight of this polymer when using a triple detector GPC instrument. Sensitivity to the laser sources of the RI and light scattering detector promoted photoscisson. However, when benzotriazole-5-carboxylic

55

acid was added as a UV absorber to the THF solution, the absolute molecular weight of this polymer could be determined (Mw 5.1 Ã 104 Da). The polymerization of 13 was also attempted using Pd(PPh3)4 27 as the catalyst. The
119

Sn NMR spectrum (Figure 3.1) of this reaction mixture revealed only the

formation of cyclic oligomer(s) 7 and no evidence for polymer 5.

3.2 Inserted distannanes and oligostannanes
This part of the chapter describes the synthesis of tin oligomers as models of larger polymer-like materials. These materials are obtained via Sn-alkyne insertion reactions.

3.2.1 Hexa-n-butyldistannyl ethylene 50:
An initial attempt to synthesize compound 50 was carried out by bubbling acetylene (C2H4) gas through a solution of 45 in toluene using 27 as catalyst was unsuccessful. The reaction mixture was analyzed after 60 h but no change in the contents of the reaction mixture was observed (NMR). The reason for this inactivity may be a result of the poor solubility of acetylene in toluene.

Reaction 3.2.1

The reaction was repeated using dioxane as a solvent employing protocols first described by Mitchell et al.[45] Over the 100 h reaction period, the mixture turned orange brown in colour and was then filtered through a glass frit (Reaction 3.2.2). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and an orange brown coloured oily products 50 was obtained.

57

Reaction 3.2.2

The

119

Sn NMR spectrum for the reaction products showed a significant shift of
13

the chemical resonance from -83.5 ppm for 45 to -68.3 ppm for 50.

C-NMR spectrum

also showed a signal assigned to the olefin bridging carbon -CH=CH- carbons resonating at 154.2 ppm. This product was then re-dissolved in hexane and filtered. Unfortunately, our attempts to crystallize this material at -70oC were not successful.

Figure 3.3 119Sn NMR spectrum of 50 A sample of 50 was sent for analysis by mass spectrometry (MS). These results revealed that the only product present was distannaxone 42 instead of the desired 50. This likely indicates a high degree of sensitivity of compound 50 to exposure to moist solvents and/or light.

Figure 3.5 119Sn NMR (C6D6) spectrum of 42 The product obtained at the end of Reaction 3.2.2 was different from that detected by MS (Figure 3.4) which suggests that oxygen inserts and replaces the -CH=CH- group.

61

There are two likely causes for the insertion of oxygen in the product. The first is that there is simple exchange and insertion of oxygen when the sample is open to the atmosphere and second may be due to bond breakage between Sn-C atoms and Sn-O formation during mass spectrometric analysis. Subsquent testing has shown that samples of 50 left exposed to moist air will convert to stannoxanes.

3.2.2 Insertion of acetylene in 5:
The insertion of acetylene into the backbone of [(n-Bu)2Sn]n 5 was attempted. All work was done in an inert atmosphere on the basis of the previous experience from Reaction 3.2.2. Polymer 5 was synthesized using the same route as described in section 2.3.2

Reaction 3.2.4

Analysis by 119Sn NMR spectrum shows only one peak at  = -66.6 ppm. This is similar to the chemical shift found for the acetylene inserted distannane 50 ( = -68.3 ppm). Absent in this spectrum is a peak at -190 ppm for the starting material 5. NMR spectrum also revealed additional peaks at 68.5 ppm, -50.23 ppm and -176.83 ppm. These peaks were assigned on the basis of other experiments which were performed both prior to and after this experiment. The peak at -66.6 ppm was assigned to polymer 5 with 62

inserted acetylenic groups between the Sn atoms. The peak at  = -176.8 ppm can be assigned to the -CH=CH- inserted cyclic product and one at  = 68.5 ppm is likely 42. However, the resonance at  = -50.23 ppm is currently unknown. The viscous product(s) obtained from the above reaction mixture was dark brown in colour. This mixture was subsequently re-dissolved in CH2Cl2 and the solution filtered. An attempt to reprecipitate the product(s) from the solution in CH2Cl2 in dry ice and acetone was unsuccessful. However, this product was successfully isolated via a methanol precipitation process at 33oC. The precipitated product showed only one resonance at  = -66.5 ppm (119Sn NMR). Presumably, the other reaction products are completely soluble in the methanol used to precipitate the desired material.

This known compound was not further analyzed. 119Sn NMR analysis of these crystals showed a new peak at -35 ppm attributed to 52 along with peaks assigned to 30 and 51.

3.3 Distannanes and oligostannanes:
The reaction conditions that were used to produce distannanes 45 and 46 from 43 and 44 respectively are listed in Table 1. An attempt to distill crude commercial 43 (200oC: vacuo) using a long path distillation condenser was initiated with the intention to further purify 43. Surprisingly, the product of this distillation was not 43, but a nearly quantitative (97%) conversion (1H and
119

Sn NMR) to distannane 45. We investigated

the impact of heating 43 to reflux temperature (200oC) under reduced pressure using a long path reflux condenser. After 6h, analysis by 1H and
119

Sn NMR indicated a 75%

conversion of 43 to 45. The sample was further heated (6h) under these conditions but NMR analysis showed virtually no change in the proportions of the product to that of the starting material. A plausible reason for this observation is that the more volatile hydride is retained by the cool portion of the reflux condenser rather than in close proximity to the heat source. To improve this conversion, 43 was heated (200oC) under static vacuum conditions in a sealed Schlenk flask. In situ analysis (119Sn NMR) of the reaction mixture taken every hour revealed that after 5h, 43 had completely converted to the distannane 45. The reaction was also carried out in a sealed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. Analysis by
119

Sn NMR showed a small peak for 43 after 5h, which was completely

consumed after heating for one additional hour (Fig.3.11). There was no evidence of redistribution products, which were reported when 43 was thermally dehydrocoupled in the presence of Group 4 or 6 transition metal complexes.[76]

Similar, presumably radical in origin, dehydrocoupling conditions were used for hydride 44. After 6h at reflux (200oC) under reduced pressure, approximately 31% of the starting material had converted to distannane 46, with most of the remainder represented by the starting material 44 in addition to a significant fraction (24%) of the redistribution product Ph4Sn 47. Product 46 precipitated from the reaction mixture as a crystalline solid as it cooled and could be easily recovered from the starting material by recrystallization. The reaction was also repeated in a heated (200oC) and sealed Schlenk flask under static vacuum. The
119

Sn NMR spectrum of this mixture showed evidence for a thermal

redistribution reaction with the bulk of the material converted (87%) to 47, a considerably

72

lower fraction of 46 (10%) in addition to a trace of grayish sediment which was attributed to elemental tin.

spectroscopy (Fig.3.12: below) revealed resonances at  = -145.8 and -67 ppm. These chemical shift values are consistent with the formation of 48.[72] Traces of the starting materials, along with 45 and 46, the redistribution product 47, and two unassigned peaks were also noted. These unidentified materials may be other higher molecular weight redistribution products.

The solvent-free, catalyst-free reaction N2(g) conditions were also employed with the secondary stannane, (n-Bu)2SnH2 (13: Reaction 3.3.1). After 6h of heating (160oC),
119

Sn NMR spectroscopic analysis of the brightly yellow coloured oily solid material

revealed a multitude of resonances.

Reaction 3.3.1

Clearly identifiable in this spectrum however was a resonance at   -208 ppm, which is attributed to the hydride terminated distannane ( nBu2SnH)2 56.[75] Additionally, a resonance at   -189 ppm can be assigned to linear dibutylpolystannane 5.[70] Two

cyclic species 6 and 7 were identified by comparison with the literature

Sn chemical

shift values.[29,74] The assignments of the rest of the minor signals has not yet been made but these are likely due to the presence of higher molecular weight hydride terminated oligomers (e.g. n-Bu2SnH(n-Bu2Sn)nSnHn-Bu2). Analysis of this material by GPC

showed a broad polymer distribution and a modest molecular weight polystannane (M w = 1.8  104 Da, PDI = 6.9) along with a considerable fraction of lower molecular weight linear and cyclic products. A UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. 3.13) of the mixture containing the polymer 5 displayed a broad absorbance with a max centered at  370 nm. This absorbance can be attributed to the * of the polystannane which is in good agreement with reported values.[69]

Figure 3.13 UV-Vis (THF) spectrum of the mixture containing 5 When the dehydrocoupling of 13 was attempted at a higher temperature (200oC: 6h), evidence of multitude of alkyl redistribution products was found (Reaction 3.3.2). Analysis by
119

Sn NMR spectroscopy showed resonances attributed to 43 as well as to

75

dimeric 45 and higher tributylstannane terminated oligomers i.e. 57, 58 identified by comparison to literature values.[62] One strong and unassigned resonance was observed at +156 ppm. There is, however, no evidence of cyclic products or hydride terminated oligomers.

Reaction 3.3.2

The catalyst and solvent-free, presumably radically driven, dehydrocoupling reactions described herein are apparently activated through the thermolysis of the relatively weak Sn-H bonds of R3SnH (R = n-Bu, Ph).

Scheme 3.3.1

In the case of 44, additional redistribution reactions to yield products such as 47 also occur. The Sn-aryl bonds also appear to be thermally labile at 200 oC and redistribution chemistry is competitive with dehydrogenation. In contrast, trialkyl

76

stannanes seem less active towards such redistributions at this temperature. In order to maximize yields of distannanes and reduce the potential of unwanted redistribution products, it is essential to identify the optimum reaction conditions ( e.g., temperature and duration of the reaction). Closed reaction vessels under slight reduced pressure produce the highest yields for all products 45, 46 and 48. A likely driving force in these reactions is the liberation of H2(g) along with formation of the persistent tin alkyl and aryl radicals that later combine to form distannanes. Attempts to carry out dehydrocoupling reactions at higher temperatures (200oC) resulted in the decomposition of the starting materials and/or lower product yields. Reaction of the secondary stannane 13 at lower

temperatures (160oC) resulted in the formation of linear and cyclic polystannane species including a modest molecular weight polymer 5. The broad polydispersity found for this sample is typical of other radical polymers prepared from an uncontrolled polymerization process. The mechanism of propagation for this species is unclear, but may occur through the coupling of two growing oligomeric species which contain active radical end groups. When a sample of 13 was heated at 200oC, redistribution to tributylstannyl terminated species are the dominant process and no evidence for cyclics or polymer was noted.

3.4 Modelling of oligostannanes and alkyne inserted stannanes:
The crystallographic structural and elect ronic spectral data for DrÃ¤ger's oligostannanes 20(a-d) provide a useful reference set for a molecular modeling study of tin oligomers. The work presented in this thesis represents the first such modeling study for these compounds. Based on these results, the most successful of the modeling methods have been extended to other compounds (distannanes and alkyne inserted distannanes) prepared in the lab, not all of which have been fully characterized with respect to structure or electronic properties.

The modeling studies began with geometric optimization for each molecule, using the algorithm supplied with the Spartan program. Optimizations were based on energies calculated using molecular mechanics (MMF), semi-empirical (PM3), and density functional methods. MMF is a quick method; geometrical optimizations were completed in several minutes or less. DF methods were the slowest and required days, even weeks, for completion. Geometric optimizations by DF failed for oligomeric chains having more than five Sn atoms, probably due to the large number of degrees of freedom in the extended chain. Table 3.5 presents a comparison of calculated and experimental bond lengths and angles for the DrÃ¤ger oligomers determined using the different methods of optimization. The PM3 semi-empirical method did not provide reasonable results for any of the compounds. The bond lengths obtained from MMF optimization are in reasonable

agreement with the experimental values for compounds 46, 20a and 20b, but poor agreement with 20c, 20d. The bond angles determined by DF optimization are in fair agreement for the four molecules for which optimization succeeded. For each molecule, the MMF molecular mechanics method provided excellent agreement for both bond lengths and angles. This suggests that the MMF force fields supplied with Spartan can accurately treat the bonding and steric interactions in the Dr Ã¤ger oligomers. This is an important finding, because DF geometrical optimization is not feasible for longer

oligomers while MMF should be.

The increase in the experimental values of  max (Table 3.6) indicates the corresponding decrease in HOMO-LUMO energy difference with increasing

oligostannane chain length (band gap). UV-visible spectral features were calculated in two ways: 1) using the Spartan routine (DF single-point energy calculation for the ground state, time-dependent DF energy calculations for excited states), 2) using the HOMOLUMO energy difference for the ground state molecule. The calculated values for

compounds 46, 20a and 20b using the first method are in good agreement with the experimental ones; those for the two higher oligomers are not.The max calculated from HOMO-LUMO energy difference are  20-30 nm lower than the calculated by DFT for all oligomers. The likely reason for this difference is that the DFT calculations for max

80

involved the excited states and max calculated from HOMO-LUMO energy difference is based on the ground state energy. It shows a pattern in the increase of max values with the increasing length of the chain or the number of tin atoms in the chain, and provides a basis for extrapolation to higher oligomers.

The energies for geometrically optimized molecular models for compounds prepared in our lab(both previously known and novel) were also calculated by using DF method 1, described above. Experimental values are not currently available for comparison. However, the energy and spectral calculations are helpful in predicting changes in electronic properties that can be verified, rationalized chemically, and used in designing useful polymers. For example, the results obtained for compound 54 and 55 in Table 3.7 suggests that HOMO-LUMO energy difference is decreasing, due to increased conjugation between the tin centers. The calculated values of max for the distannanes listed in Table 3.8 reveal the influence of the substituents. The -* transition is effect by the increase in electronic density moving from Me to Bu and Ph and additional the increased mixing of the - orbitals of Sn and the aromatic ring.

4.0 Conclusion:
Compound 13 was synthesized in good yield and polymerized to 5 by catalytic dehydrocoupling route using Wilkinson's catalyst. Acetylene was successfully inserted in compound 29 and 45 in dioxane using 27 as a catalyst to produce the model compound 30 and 50 respectively. Both compounds 30 and 50 were affected by the air/moisture and converted to compounds 52 and 42 respectively. The insertion of acetylene into polymer 5 to produce 53 was successfully achieved using a similar synthetic method and characterized by 119Sn NMR spectroscopy. The insertion of phenylacetylene into compound 29 was achieved via neat reaction conditions and compound 32 (cis) and 54 (trans) isomers were produced. The sample in C6D6 in NMR tube crystallized and the crystal structure and revealed head to head insertion of two phenylacetylene units into compound 29 to produce the novel carbodistannane 55. Compound 45 was successfully synthesized in high yield from the thermally driven dehydrocoupling of the tertiary stannane 43 under a variety of catalyst and solvent-free conditions. Compound 46 was also obtained in a similar way with lower conversion from the tertiary stannane 44. A mixed distannane 48 was also prepared from the equimolar reaction of 43 and 44 under similar conditions. Evidence for the redistribution product 47 was found when aryl stannane 44 was used. Solvent and catalyst-free dehydrogenative coupling of the secondary distannane 13 at 160oC resulted in the formation of a modest molecular weight polystannane 5 and other linear and cyclic stannanes but favours only redistribution products at 200oC. This work has demonstrated

83

that dehydrocoupling of stannanes in the absence of catalyst under a variety of conditions may provide a viable route to valuable organic radical sources. DrÃ¤ger's series of oligostannanes 20(a-d) were optimized using different computational methods and the  max calculated by density functional method. These calculations revealed that DFT method holds well compared to the other methods but only up to four Sn atoms. Bond angles calculated by MMF are relatively comparable with values obtained from crystal structures of these compounds. This calculation study revealed that for the molecules with higher number of tin atoms, MMF gave better and comparable results than given by other methods.

84

5.0 Future work:
For alkyne insertion into Sn-Sn backbone work is required to examine the insertion reactions of other polydialkylstannanes and complete the characterization of the inserted polymers under different conditions. The reaction between 29 and 26 with different ratios will be performed to study the changes in the mode of insertion of phenylacetylene units between Sn atoms and to investigate the stability of these compounds under different conditions. Future efforts will be directed to the coupling of tertiary and secondary stannanes using other metal free routes including the use of light and microwave mediated coupling processes.
