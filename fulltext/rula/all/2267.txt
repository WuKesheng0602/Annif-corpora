Abstract
Different approaches are usually taken when designing flexible and rigid pavement: the rigid concrete slab carries major portion o f the traffic load; while for flexible pavement, external loads are distributed to the subgrade because o f the relative low modulus o f elasticity o f asphalt layer comparing to concrete in the case o f rigid pavement.

Pavement engineering has gone through major developments; the transition from Empirical Design M ethod to Mechanistic-Empirical Methods is becoming a near-future trend. The M echanistic-Empirical Method has two components: (1) stress, strain and deflection are calculated based on analyzing mechanical characteristics o f materials; ( 2 ) critical pavement distresses are quantitatively predicted by experimental calibrated equations. Hence, stress analysis has become an important role in pavement engineering.

The m ost practical and widely used stress analysis method for flexible pavement is Burm ister's Elastic Layered Theory; and for analyzing rigid pavement is Finite Element Method. KENSLABS and STAAD-III are both Finite Element software; KENSLABS is designed specifically for concrete pavement stress analysis, therefore it is more user-friendly for pavement design; STAAD-III is m ore suitable for general plane and space structures. The project compares the use o f both software for stress analysis in rigid pavement in term o f simplicity and precision.

Executive Summary

The first chapter o f this report briefly introduced the pavement types, available pavement design methods and objectives o f this project. There are two major types pavement: flexible or asphalt pavement and rigid or concrete pavement. As an important component of Mechanistic-Empirical Method, the m ost praetieal stress analysis method for flexible pavement is Burmister's Elastic Layered Theory and for rigid pavement is Finite Element Method.

The second chapter o f this report reviewed critical stress, strain and deflection, which would induce m ajor types o f distress in flexible pavement and rigid pavement. Horizontal tensile strain at the bottom o f the asphalt and the vertical compressive strain at the top o f the subgrade are two critical measurements for predicting flexible pavement distresses such as fatigue cracking and rutting. Flexural stress in concrete slab is a major factor controlling rigid pavement distress such as transverse cracking. The application of Burmister's Elastic Layered Theory in flexible pavem ent design and Finite Element Method in rigid pavement design will also be elaborated in this Chapter.

Two available Finite Element software, KENSLABS and STAAD-III are compared in Chapter 3 by solving two pavement design examples. As a software designed specifically for rigid

pavem ent stress analysis, KENSLABS has several advantages in terms o f simplicity, as a powerful while complicated finite element software, STAAD-III is more suitable for analyzing general plane and space structures. The last chapter presents the conclusions o f this project.

Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1

Definition of pavement types

There are m ainly two types o f pavement structure currently in use around the world: flexible pavem ent and rigid pavement. The major difference between these two types o f pavement is: flexible pavement has an asphalt concrete surface layer at the very top, base and/or subbase layer in the middle, and natural sub grade layer at the very bottom; while for rigid pavement, regardless as continuously reinforced concrete or lean concrete pavement, it has a concrete slab sitting right above the soil, a layer o f base course may sit in-between. Compositions o f two types o f pavem ent are simply illustrated as below in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2: Asphalt Surface Layer Base Course

1.2

Pavement design methods

Pavement design has evolved from art to science during the past two centuries. The first asphaltpaved roadway in the United States was constructed in 1870 at Newark by a Belgian Chemist named Edmund J. DeSmedt/^^ and the first Portland cement concrete pavement in the United States was believed to be laid in 1893 in Bellefontaine, Ohio by J. Y. McClintock.^'^

As a simple design approach, the Empirical Design Method has been adopted by many transportation agencies nowadays. By inputting environmental, material and traffic data. Empirical M ethod is able to provide design engineers the pavement design thickness by using calibrated equations and Nomographs. Unlike the Empirical Design Method, MechanisticEmpirical M ethod is mainly based on analyzing mechanical characteristics of materials. Stress, strain and deflection can be calculated by using Elastic Layered Theory (flexible pavement) and Finite Element Method (rigid pavement); then critical pavement distresses can be quantitatively predicted by experimental calibrated m o d e l s . W i t h the development of high-speed calculation with computer software, critical stresses and deflections of pavement under traffic and environmental loadings is much more convenient to be predicted than the past.

1.3

Objectives

The objectives o f this project are firstly, to review critical stress, strain and deflection that would induce m ajor types o f distress in flexible pavement and rigid pavement. Distress is an important consideration in terms o f pavement performance. The magnitude/frequency o f loading and num ber o f load repetitions during the design period are major factors contribute to the damage effects o f pavement structures. For flexible pavement, primary distresses are rutting, fatigue

cracking and thermal cracking;^^^ for concrete pavement, major distresses are transverse cracking and faulting/^^

Secondly, available stress analysis methods will be reviewed. As a realistic approach for analyzing flexible pavement responses, Burmister's Elastic Layered Theory will be briefly introduced; and as a common structural analyzing tool, Finite Element Method and how the method is applied in solving rigid pavement problem will be elaborated.

Finally, two available Finite Element software: KENSLABS and STAAD-III will be compared by solving two pavement design examples. The results from running two software will be explained and analyzed. A brief introduction on design procedures and reports generated by both software are included in Appendices.

Chapter 2: Review of available stress analysis methodology For flexible and rigid pavement

From the standpoint o f stress analysis, the essential differences between flexible and rigid pavem ent is: because o f the large modulus of elasticity of the rigid concrete slab, major portion o f the load transferred from the tires o f the vehicles will be carried by the concrete slab itself, thus the main goal o f the rigid pavement design is to build a strong concrete slab. While for flexible pavement, external loads will be distributed to the subgrade layer because o f the relative low modulus o f elasticity o f asphalt layer and other upper layers, the design process consists o f choosing optimum layer combinations and structural design of eaeh layer eomponent.

2.1

Stress analysis for flexible pavement

The simplest way to solve flexible pavement problem is to consider the pavement system as a homogeneous half-space with infinite area and depth, the original theory developed by Boussinesq (1885)^'^ was based on a concentrated load applied on an elastic half space, however, this assumption is not realistic. First of all, the subgrade soils are not elastic even though under the m oving traffic load some o f the deformation is recoverable; secondly, flexible pavement is a layered system with better materials at the top; each layer has different material characteristics, such as modulus o f elasticity E and Poisson's ratio v.

The Elastic Layered Theory developed by Burmister (1943) is a realistic solution to treat the flexible pavement as a multi-layered system. Some basic assumptions when applying this theory are:^^^

1. Pavem ent layers extend infinitely in the horizontal direction. 2. The bottom layer (usually the subgrade) extends infinitely downward. 3. M aterials are not stressed beyond their elastic ranges. 4. Continuity conditions are satisfied at the layer interfaces.

From the above illustration, according to the mechanistic theories, at any point within the layered system, there are 9 stresses: 3 normal stresses and the following relationships exist:

Typically, flexible pavement is designed to put materials with higher modulus o f elasticity at the upper layers in order to reduce stresses and deflection transferred to the subgrade layer. Basing on the elastic body theory, the basic stress and strain relationship should be satisfied within this axially symmetrical system.

Fig. 4 Distribution o f vertical compressive stress with Modulus o f Elasticity^^

From above Fig. 4, vertical compressive stress at the top surface

= -P, where P stands for the

external load applied on the unit circular area. According to the graph, it is self-explanatory that to increase the modulus o f elasticity, or in other words, to increase the rigidity o f the surface layer can reduce vertical compressive stress transferred to lower layers. This explains why we design the flexible pavement as materials with higher modulus of elasticity at the upper layers. On the other hand, under same traffic loading conditions, soft asphalt mixtures or excessive air voids or inadequate compaction in any pavement layer are tend to be more susceptible to rutting damages.^^^

From the Fig. 5 below it could also be seen that ffz will be reduced when h,/h 2 increase or l/hz decrease. That means if hj, the thickness o f the base course layer should remain constant, to increase h], the thickness o f surface layer will bring the vertical compressive stress down.

Horizontal shearing stress

Fig. 6 sim ply illustrates the distribution of shearing stress over layers. From the figure, the m axim um Trz occurs approximately at the midpoint o f the surface layer; and at the top surface horizontal shear stress Trz - 0. To increase the modulus of elasticity o f the surface layer will cause the shearing stress to be increased. Inadequate shear strength o f the asphalt mixture will induce two-dimensional movement under heavy t r a f f i c , a n d this will induce two-dimensional rutting damage. As a major type o f distress in asphalt pavement, rutting appears as a surface depression in the wheel paths. Rutting damage relates to material properties and loading, major portion o f the rutting occur within the asphalt layer.

2.1.3

Horizontal tensile stress

Horizontal tensile stress would normally be developed at first interface, right underneath the asphalt layer. The simplified distribution pattern is as shown below Fig. 7.

Fig. 7 Distribution o f horizontal tensile stress with Modulus o f Elasticity and layer thickness^^^

The information we can get from Fig. 7 is: to increase E 1/E 2 or reduce hi/hz, ffr will significantly increase; but when asphalt layer thickness approaches zero, there would be no horizontal tensile stress exists.

W hen horizontal tensile stress at the bottom o f the asphalt layer exceed its tensile strength under repeated loading applications, cracks will form and propagate to the surface, this type o f distress is called fatigue cracking which is the result o f repeated bending o f asphalt layer under traffic.^^^

M any factors contribute the forming o f fatigue cracking, material properties and layer thickness, traffic load and number o f load repetitions, temperature and environmental conditions. Studies

10

have shown that 3 to 5 inches thick asphalt is most susceptible to fatigue cracking damage/^^ The proper thickness o f asphalt layer must be either as thin as practical or as thick as possible. The flexible pavement with very thin asphalt layer tend to have less problem with fatigue cracking since compressive effect tend to be more significant.

2.1.4

Vertical deflection

Studies have shown that about 70 to 95% o f the surface deflection is the function o f the elastic compression on the subgrade layer.^^^ Based on mechanical theories about stress/strain relationship, in order to minimize surface deflections, vertical compressive stress should be kept low. From the above analysis about vertical compressive stress, to increase E, or hj at the surface layer when thickness o f base course layer remains the same can all help to reach this goal.

Excessive vertical deflection on subgrade layer will cause rutting damage. Rutting is an incremental plastic damage throughout the layered system. National Cooperative Highway Research Program conducted by State of Illinois suggested that the total rutting in the pavement structure is to sum up the permanent deformation at asphalt layer, granular base layer and subgrade layer. Currently there are several models available for estimating plastic strain within asphalt layer such as Ohio State M o d e l , 6 p = a, x xjaS X ^ a 3 ^ x N=^ and Illinois Model,^^^ C p = a,x the resilient strain (also called

models, plastic strain p is a function o f

recoverable strain) and N, number o f repetitions o f loading. In Illinois model, T, the temperature effect is also considered when estimating plastic strain in asphalt layer, since as a viscoelastic material, strain in asphalt is a time- and temperature-dependent value. `a,,' in above equations represent calibration factors.

2.2

Stress analysis for rigid pavement

Stresses in rigid pavement are resulted from a variety of reasons: loading from the wheels, temperature or moisture changes, and deflection or deformation o f the base course layer or subgrade layer.

Two factors will affect the decision on whether to use plain concrete or reinforced concrete pavement: ( 1 ) spacing o f joints and (2 ) whether a base course is used over natural subgrade layer. In m ost cases, if the slab length is less than 20 feet and a cement-treated base course is used; plain concrete pavement would be a cost-saving choice.^^^ When the joint spacing increased to m ore than 40 feet, wire mesh reinforcement should be used for crack control purpose only.^^^

Fig. 8 as shown below illustrates the general layout of rigid concrete pavement. Dowel bars are used at transverse joints to act as a load-transferring media; dowel bars normally are heavy steels and will be placed at relative close intervals; they should also be smooth and lubricated at one end to allow slab movements.

Tie bars are used along longitudinal joints, the function o f the tie bars is tying two slabs together to improve load transfer and prevent joints from opening and/or f a u ltin g /A s recommended in the design manual o f Illinois Department o f Transportation, tie bar must be deformed and hooked and must be firmly anchored into the concrete; tie bars should be placed at relatively large intervals.

Basically there are four groups o f joints for rigid concrete pavements; contraction joints, expansion joints, construction joints and warping j o in ts .T h e y are illustrated in Fig. 9 and 10. Dummy groove contraction joint

Each kind o f joint has its specific functions. The intention of applying contraction joints is to relieve the horizontal tensile stress due to contraction and curling/warping o f concrete slab. Norm al joint opening is about 0.25 inch. Dowel bar may or may not be used at the contraction joints location.^^^ When dowel bars are not used, load transfer can be achieved by grain interlock o f the lower portion o f the slab.

Expansion joints should allow concrete to expand, joint opening is about 0.75 inch. Since the gap is relatively big, infiltrations o f subgrade materials into the expansion joints may cause the joints

14

to expand, and sometimes, inadequate load transfer may cause the pumping o f material underneath the concrete slab, thus expansion joints are used more often for airport pavements.

Construction joints are also about 0.25 inch wide, the function is to transit from old concrete to the construction o f new concrete. It can be keyed construction joints as shown in Fig. 10 or butt type construction joints which are more commonly used.

W arping joints are used to control longitudinal cracks to occur along the centerline o f the pavement. Tie bars should be used to connect two pieces of slab, load transfer can be achieved by the grain interlock o f the lower portion o f the slab.

2.2.1

Curling stress

W hen the concrete pavement is exposed to the sun during the day, the top o f the slab warms faster than the subgrade, if the temperature gradient occurs through the depth o f the slab, curling stress will be induced.

P) Fig. 11 Curling effect due to temperature gradient 15

Regardless the slab to curl upward or downward, the weight of the slab will always tend to hold the slab in its original position, thus the stresses are induced. Based on the work by Westergaard and Bradbury, curling stress at the edge and any point inside the slab can be calculated by the following equations.^

For edge stresses: j =(C xE X 01 X At) / 2 For interior stresses:
(7y = [(E X 01 X At) / 2 ] X [(Cy + y X Cx) / (1-

(Eq. 2.1)

v^)]

(Eq. 2.2) (Eq. 2.3)

(T x = [(E X 01 X At) / 2 ] X [(Cx + y X Cy) / (1- y^)]

W ithin the above interior curling stresses equations, C* and Cy are curling stress coefficients. They are fixed values based on the chart provided by B radbury.^T he first equation measures interior curling stress due to bending in y direction, and the second equation measures interior curling stress due to bending in x direction; E is the modulus of elasticity o f concrete (Ibs/sq. inch); y, the P oisson's ratio; oi, coefficient o f thermal expansion (inch/inch/°F) and At is the temperature differential (°F).

As a m ajor distress in rigid pavement, transverse cracking is the combined effect o f external load and temperature. W hen a heavy load is near the longitudinal edge of the slab, midway between the transverse joints, a severe tensile bending stress will occur at the bottom o f the slab. The situation will becom e worse when the top of the slab is warmer than the bottom o f the slab. Repeated heavy loading under this condition would result fatigue damage along the bottom edge

16

o f the slab, which will induce a transverse crack and propagate to the surface o f the pavement. W hen top o f the slab is cooler than the bottom, repeated heavy loading would result in fatigue damage at the top o f the slab, which eventually will induce transverse cracks initiated from the surface o f the pavement.^^^

M any factors contribute to the forming o f fatigue cracking, not only slab thickness and concrete strength, joint spacing also play a big role in the formation of transverse cracks. The effective w ay to minimize transverse cracking is to increase slab thickness, reduce joint spacing or use a widened slab, and if possible, to provide a stabilized base layer.

2.2.2

Frictional stress

From the above discussion, we understand that curling stresses would occur with temperature gradient through the depth o f the concrete slab; while uniform temperature changes will cause the concrete slab to contract or expand, and friction stresses are resulted from frictional resistance in-between the slab and subgrade. Frictional resistance is critical for long slabs (normally refer to the slabs more than 100 feet long),^^^ while for short and average length slabs (less than 40 feet),^^^ frictional resistance value is not considered as significant.

The purpose o f analyzing frictional stress is to determine the spacing between contraction joints and the number o f tie bars. For pavement with long joint spacing, steel wire mesh must be used to take care o f the tensile stress induced by friction.

W here dc is the frictional stress (Ibs/sq. inch); 7 = is unit weight o f concrete (lbs/cubic inch); L: the length o f slab and fa is the average coefficient o f fiiction between slab and subgrade layer, in m ost occasions fa = 1.5.

2.2.3

External loading stress

W estergaard had extraordinary contributions on the pavement thickness design.^^^ He developed a set o f equations for determining stresses and deflections in concrete pavements under different loads conditions; at the interior o f the slab, at free edges and at the comers. These equations allow the prediction o f critical stresses under extreme conditions o f loading cases.^^^

18

For com er case. ffc = (3 X P/h^) X [1 _ (aj X 1.414/f)®-^] For interior case, ffi = (0.316 X ? / h^) X [4 X logio (f/b) + 1 .069], b = (1 .6 x For edge case. ffe = (0.572 X p / h^) X [4 X logio (£/b) + 0.359], b = (1 .6 x + h^) - 0.675h (Eq. 2.7) + h^) - 0.675h

(Eq 2 .5 )

(Eq. 2.6)

W here P is the external load; £ is the radius o f relative stiffiiess o f concrete to subgrade,^'^ £ = [(E X h^) / (12 X (1 --v^) X k)] f i s a function o f E, the modulus o f elasticity o f concrete; v,

the Poisson's ratio o f concrete; k; the modulus of subgrade reaction and h: the thickness o f concrete slab; a\ is called contact radius, it is the distance from the point where load applies to com er o f slab; a is the distance from the point where load applies to the point tangent to slab edge.

Basing on W estergaard theory, in 1950's, Pickett and Ray developed a set o f charts called `influence charts' which allow analyzing stress and deflection more conveniently.^'^ The charts were developed basing on two assumptions: ( 1 ) pavement built on dense liquid foundation (2 ) pavement itself is an elastic solid. Liquid foundation is also called Winkler foundation, liquid foundation assumes under vertical force, vertical deflection at node i is independent o f deflections at neighboring nodes.

The procedure to calculate stress and deflection is relative simple by using influence chart. The first step is to find the size o f tire imprint by the given tire pressure, second step is to trace the

19

tire imprints on the influence chart with using appropriate radius o f relative stiffiiess as a scale factor and the third step is to count number o f blocks within the imprint area and finally solve a set o f equations to find deflection and stress.

2.2.4

Dowel bar stress

Upon above discussion, we understood that dowel bars are used at transverse joints to transfer loads when "grain interlock" is hardly achieved or heavy loads shall be applied, dowel joints are norm ally applied for joint openings from 0.04 to 0.25 inch wide.

The design o f dowel bars are based on the analysis of concrete bearing stresses under dowel bars. Following assumptions should be applied in order to simplify the case: (1) it is assumed that dowel bars are perfectly aligned and free to move and (2 ) characteristics o f subgrade materials are overlooked; dowel bar diameter and length design is based on pavement thickness only.

Fig. 13 Deflected shape o f dowel bar under load^^^

Based on the above assumptions, Timoshenko, Friberg (1940)^*^ developed following equations to estimate bearing stress on concrete underneath the dowel. For a joint opening z, if the dowel bar is subjected to external load Pt, the moment at the dowel-concrete interface is Mo = -Pt the deflection o f the dowel at the joint can be estimated by:^'^

A t above equation, where K is the modulus o f dowel support, K value is also called steelconcrete K value, it expresses the bearing stress in the concrete developed under a unit deflection o f dowel bar.(^) Due to the difficulty of establishing the value of K theoretically, K value is normally selected from 3 x 10 ^ to 1.5 x ] 0 ^ pci.^ ^ `d ' is the diameter o f dowel bar, and Ej, Ij are modulus o f elasticity o f the dowel bar and the moment o f inertia o f the dowel bar respectively.

21

The actual bearing pressure on the concrete at the joint face a = K x yo has to be compared with allowable bearing stress o f concrete since the concrete is much weaker than the steel. The allowable bearing stress o f concrete can be estimated by fb = [(4-d) x f ,']/3 (American Concrete Institute, 1956),^ ^ d is the dowel diameter in inches and f^' is the ultimate compressive strength o f concrete. The load transferring capacity of a single dowel is determined by allowable bearing stress o f concrete, the load transferring capacity equals to the actual bearing pressure a divided by allowable bearing stress fy and times 100.^^^ Load transferring capacity also depends upon the length o f embedment. Tests indicated that for a 0.75-inch diameter dowel, the length of embedment should be about 8 times of diameter.^^^ For bigger size dowels, the length of embedment decreases.

Since dowel bars work as a group, as per the study by Friberg (1940),^'^ when the load is applied at a joint, the dowel bars right under the applied load carry a major portion of load. Other dowel bars carry a progressively reduced amount of load, this result a portion of load can be transferred into the next slab.

The Fig. 15 below shows that the load carrying capacity of a group of dowels is equal to the sum o f loads carried by each dowel. And in the case o f superimposing effect o f two wheels, similar as shown above, the load carried by the dowel at point A should be the load carried by the dowel at A due to load at A plus the load carried by the dowel at A due to load at B. From the point where load applies, load transferring capacity will reduce to zero at a distance equals to 1 .8 times radius o f relative stiffiiess o f concrete versus subgrade.

Joint faulting is mainly caused by repeated heavy loading crossing transverse joints; it appears as base m aterial build-up at one slab comer, and loss o f support at adjacent com er/ ^ It has adverse im pact on riding quality. For pavements with dowel bars as load transferring device, faulting is assumed m ainly caused by erosion o f the concrete around dowel bars under repeated traffic loading. Since the concrete bearing stress under dowel can be calculated, faulting can be predicted by calibrated equation.^^^ There are many ways to reduce the formation o f joint faulting, either to increase the load transfer efficiency by increase the diameter o f the dowel bars

23

or to reduce the joint spacing, or move the heavy load from slab comers by widening the slab or provide stabilized base course.

2.2.5

Reinforcing steel and tie bar stress

As p er above mentioned, the design o f dowel bars is conducted by analyzing the concrete bearing stress and actual load transferring capacity o f dowel; while for reinforcing steel wire m esh and tie bar, the design is mainly based on the analysis o f frictional stress induced by uniform tem perature changes.

W ire m esh reinforcement will not add structural capacity to the pavement slab, it can tie cracked concrete pavem ent together and control crack developments in order to allow effective load transferring efficiency through grain interlock. Basing on the assumption that tensile stress along the slab length induced by the frictional stress is carried by wire mesh reinforcement, the area o f steel can be approximately estimated.

Sim ilar to the design o f wire mesh reinforcement, tie bars are used along longitudinal joints to tie pavem ent slabs together, the approximate area of tie bars required for connecting longitudinal joints can be estimated by the same concept that tensile stress along the slab lane width induced by the frictional stress is carried by the tie bar steels.

The am ount o f steel required depends upon the size o f the slab. For short slabs, steel could be reduced or omitted. W hen the pavement is designed without transverse joint, as it is called

24

continuously reinforced slab, adequate steels must be provided to ensure cracks to be tightly
closed.

2.2.6

Thickness design criteria

From the above discussion we could see that stress-inducing factors in rigid concrete pavement are quite complex, while some factors could be ignored for thickness design. Besides subgrade l-yP®5 curling stress will not be taken into consideration when deciding thickness o f pavement. Herewith we applied the conclusive statement by E. J. Yoder:^^^ "Joints and steel are used to relieve and/or take care o f warping (curling) stresses, and the design, then, is based upon load alone when considering thickness. This principle is so important that it must be clearly understood by the designer. Recall that a joint is nothing more than a designed crack".

Department o f Transportation o f individual states has developed their own minimum pavement thickness criteria. For instance, the Colorado Department of Transportation has stated in its Pavement Design M anual that the minimum thickness of Portland Cement concrete pavement is
8

inches for traffic greater than 1 million 18K ESAL and 6 inches for traffic less than or equal to

1 m illion 18K ESAL.^'*^

2.3

Application of Elastic Layered Theory in flexible pavement design

Flexible pavements are layered systems with better materials on the top and being represented by

a homogeneous m ass is not realistic. Burmister's layered theory is more appropriate when we try
to sim ulate the actual stress state o f flexible pavements.^ ^Burmister first developed solutions for

a tw o layered system which is more suitable for a full-depth asphalt construction, and then he

25

extended the solutions to a three-layered system. With the advent o f computer software, the elastic layered theory can be applied to a multilayered system with any number o f layers. The application o f elastic layered theory on solving flexible pavement problem will be briefly introduced as below.

In order to use elastic layered theory to solve flexible pavement problem, a stress function # should be defined for each layer in the system. ^ is a function of r, z, H and vertical load, where r is the radial distance from the study point to the external load; z is the depth from the study point to the surface; H is the distance from the surface to the upper boundary o f the lowest layer. $ also contains integration constants; each layer has a stress function $ with different integration constants.

Once the stress function $ is defined, stress and strain within the layered system can all be expressed by the stress function $ ; the stress function can also allow stress and strain to satisfy all elastic stress/strain relationships. By the classical theory o f elasticity, stress function should satisfy the governing differential equation: T"* $ = 0, where T is called Laplace operator, T = a^/ ôr^ + ( 1/r) ô/ôr + â^/ôzl

To apply the continuity conditions basing on the assumption that all layers are fully bonded with the same vertical compressive stress, horizontal shear stress, vertical displacement and radial displacement at every point along the layer interface, the following relationship should be satisfied: (o,) i = (Oz) i+i; W i = W i+i: (w) i = (w) i+,; (u) i = (u) i+,. And if the ith layer interface

26

is unbonded or frictionless, the continuation o f shear stress and radial displacement must be zero, (O ^z) i ~ (<^z) i + b (7'rz) i = 0 ; ( w ) j =
(w )

j+j; (Tj^) i+1

=

0.

At the upper surface, as we have discussed before under Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 , vertical compressive stress under the external load (Uz)] -- -P, where P is the vertical load applied on a unit area; horizontal shear stress (Trz)i = 0. With the application of these boundary and continuity conditions, unknow n integration constants for each layer can be found, and stress and displacem ent can be determined.

Com paring w ith Boussinesq's elastic homogeneous half-space theory, Burmister's elastic layered theory is m ore practical for analyzing flexible pavement problems. Based on two-layered and three-layered system, various charts were developed for determining pavement responses conveniently. W ith the application o f elastic layered theory in multilayered pavement system, available flexible pavement stress analysis software such as KENLAYER developed by Hung (1985) and his colleagues makes multilayered pavement system stress analysis problems much

easier to solve.

Application of Finite Element Method in rigid pavement design

Finite elem ent m ethod is a numeneal technique for solving problems. By finite element method, a eontinuous physical problem will be transformed into a discretized finite element problem. The following paragraphs elaborate how finite element method can be applied in the case o f concrete pavem ent design.

27

2.4.1

Discretize the contmuum

For rigid concrete slabs, the shape o f rectangular is selected to discretize the whole concrete slab into num erous finite elements.

Each nodal point (i, j, k, 1) at each rectangular element has three degrees o f freedom (6 % ,O y, co): 0% , the rotation about x axis; the rotation about y axis and w is the deflection along z axis. Nodal

displacem ents for each rectangular element can be represented by the matrix as shown below which contains 12 items.

2.4.2

Select interpolation functions

A polynom ial containing x and y coordinate will be chosen, the degree o f the polynomial will be based on the num ber o f nodes assigned to the element. Since each elements contains four nodes, a forth degree polynomial is assigned to represent vertical deflection w, since for slender slabs

28

under flexural bending, displacements, internal forces and stresses can all be expressed in term w ( 0 x = -dw/dy and 6y = dw/dx).

W e random ly pick one element o f size a by b, if the center of the rectangular element is defined as (0 , 0 ) o f the xyz coordinate system, the coordinate reading o f each node within the element can be found; and by inputting (x, y) coordinate o f each node, deflection w at each node can all be expressed by above polynomial with an as unknown coefficients. For instance, (-a/2) and ( b/ 2 ) are the x and y coordinate for the nodal point i, deflection w, rotation 0 %and 6y at point i can be expressed as three functions as shown below:

ü)i = ai + B2 X (-a/2) + as X (-b/2) + 34 x (a^/4) + as x (ab/4) + 86 x (b^/4) + a? x (-aVS) + ag x (a^b/8 ) + 39 X (-ab^/8 ) + a,o x

And for the rest three nodes j(-a/2, b/2), k(a/2, -b/2) and ](a/2, b/2), similarly, there are three polynom ials to represent (0x, ^y, w) for each node respectively. For such a rectangular element containing four nodes, there are totally 12 equations to represent the displacement matrix, in order to simplify, the displacement matrix can be expressed by [Ô] = [C] [a], where [C] is a 12 by
12

m atrix containing a and b (size o f the element), and [a] contains a, to a ^ twelve unknown

coefficients.

2.4.3

D efine th e elem ent p ro p erty

Stiffiiess m atrix for the element shall be established at this step. Stiffiiess is the resistance o f an elastic body to the deflection induced by an external load. Stiffness can be measured by k = P/ô, where P is the external force and d represent the displacement. When both force and deflection are vectors, stiffiiess matrix can be expressed as a function o f two major characteristics o f m aterial properties; E, the modulus of elasticity and v, the Poisson s ratio.

30

For elastic body, the following stress/strain relationships exist:
ffx = E X (Cx + f XEy)/ ( 1 -u^) (7y = E X (ty + 1 ; (1-1/2) (Eq. 2.15) (Eq. 2.16) (Eq. 2.17)'

Txy = B X 7xy / [2X (l+ u )i And £x = du/dx = -z X d^w / dx^

Where, [B] is called displacement differentiation matrix. It is obtained by differentiation o f displacement expressed through shape functions and nodal displacements. For better

understanding o f the form o f [B], [B] = [Q] [C] ' and [B]^ = [Q]^ [C] ' ^ , as explained before, [C] IS a 12 by 12 m atrix containing a and b (size o f the element), [Q] is a 3 by 12 matrix, it equals inputting coordinate reading at one node into [\p]. Thus [K] is a matrix containing only material properties, i.e. E and u.

In order to simulate real world situation, the stiffiiess of pavement should include stiffness o f concrete slab, foundation and the joint: [K] ^ = [K)] ®+ [Kn] ^ + [Km]

2.4.3.2 Stiffness of foundation
Two different types o f foundation can normally be considered: Winkler foundation and solid foundation. W inkler foundation was also called liquid foundation which assumes vertical force at node i depends only on the vertical deflection at node i and is independent o f all other nodes.

TTnTT
I I I ) / I

Fig 19 Winkler foundation^
The stiffiiess o f the W inkler foundation can be expressed as: k = P/w, where k is the modulus of subgrade reaction; P is the unit force and w stands for the vertical deflection.

Assum e an element o f size a by b, nodal points right locate at the com er o f the slab, total resisting force fi-om the foundation can be expressed as F = a x b x k x Since fi-om the

33

assumption, every nodal point is independent o f deflections from other nodal point, resisting force from each nodal point can be expressed a s F = a x b x k x w/4. Transforming into matrix form [F] [K] [Ô], we can easily get foundation stiffness matrix [Kn] (k x a x b/4) [1 0 0]/'^

W inkler foundation oversimplified the actual characteristics o f soil foundation. A solid foundation model is believed to be more realistic; the deflection at any nodal point depends not only on the force at the node itself but also on the forces at all other nodes. The following equation is used to determine the stiffness matrix: Wjj = Pj (1 - Uf)/ (tp x Ef x dij).^'^ Where cOjj is the deflection at nodal point i due to force at nodal point j; Pj is the force at nodal point j; L » r is the Poisson's ratio for foundation and dj j is distance between nodal point i and j. The stiffness m atrix o f the foundation element is defined as deflection at one node due to forces at all other nodes. In order to determine the stif&iess matrix, a unit concentrated force can be transferred as distributed load over a " 4 x a x b " area as a uniform pressure 1 / (4 x a x b), then integrate over the w hole area.

2.4.3.3 Stiffness of joints
The stif&iess o f joint is represented by shear spring constant C^, which can be expressed by: Cw = shear force per unit length o f joint / difference in deflection between two slabs.

C D l

Fig. 21 Shear transfers through joint by grain interlocl/'^

W hen w e use grain interlock to transfer the load over joint as shown above in Fig. 21, the shear force can be expressed as F = L x Cu x cO d, where F is the nodal force applied to both slabs; L is the average spacing between nodes at the joint and W d is the deflection between two slabs.

W hen dowel bars are used to transfer loads, the situation can be simulated by Fig. 22, and the deflection between two slab can be expressed as W d = AS + 2 x y^,. Where AS is the deformation o f dowel under load and yo is deformation o f concrete under the dowel. Both items can be expressed as a function o f Pt which is the force applied on each dowel bar and equals to F x Sb/L, w here F is nodal force applied at the slab, Sy is dowel spacing and L is the average nodal spacing at joint. By knowing W d, Cu, shear spring constant at the joint can be defined.

Assemble the element equations
where [F] is the force vector;

The core equation o f the finite element method is [F] = [K]

[K ] is the stiffness matrix and [K] = [Kj] + [Kn] + [Km]; [6] is the displacement vector. [F] could

contain external force and thermal stress due to temperature changes. Since [F] and [K] contain all known information, [6 ], the displacement vector can be found by solving a group o f equations.

In order to keep the consistency, external load P should be converted into 12 nodal loads (at 3 directions at each nodal point and totally 4 nodal points for one element).

External load vector can be expressed by the following form: {F)" = [Zi Txi Tyi Zj Txj Tyj Z, Tx, Ty, Zk Txk Tyk] (Eq. 2.27)

From the Fig. 23 below we can see that, since the slab only subject to vertical loading, the `T ' item at the above matrix should be equal zero.

Chapter 3: Comparison of KENSLABS and STAAD-III

3.1

Background on Finite element software

Various com puter software has been developed with the application o f Finite Element Method; the high-speed computation o f PC makes the prediction of pavement distress and stress analysis m uch m ore convenient today than the past. EverFE delivered by Washington State Department o f Transportation and University of Washington (1997)^^ KENSLABS developed by Huang (1985) are both finite element program to investigate concrete pavement performance and rehabilitation alternatives. SAP2000 and STAAD are both the most commonly used finite element program for structural engineers to simulate plane and space structures responses.

KENSLABS developed by Huang (1985) and his colleagues is a concrete pavement stress
analysis program basing on finite element method. The program allows the study o f a maximum o f 6 slabs, 7 joints and 420 nodes, and each slab can have a maximum of 15 nodes in x direction and 15 nodes in y d ire c tio n .^ T h e following example will elaborate how a combined warping and loading stress analysis case be solved by using KENSLABS program.

3.2

Design example 1 - the study on combined effect of warping and loading

A concrete slab, 10 meter (32.8 feet) long, 3 meter (9.8 feet) wide and 20 centimeter (7.9 inch) thick, is placed on a modulus o f subgrade reaction o f 55 MN/m (202.7 pci). The pavement is subjected to a temperature differential o f 0.5°C per centimeter (2.28 F per inch) at night when a 45 KN (10100 lbs) single axle load is applied on the edge o f the slab over a circular area with a

3.2.1 A nalysis using KENSLABS In order to save computer storage and running time o f computation, since the slab and loading condition is symmetrical about Y-axis, only half of the slab needs to be discretized into rectangular finite elements. We usually number the nodes by `from bottom to top' and `fi-om left to right' sequence. The general rule o f numbering the nodes is trying to keep the maximum difference between nodal numbers on the opposite comers of the element low. The following Fig. 25 and Fig. 26 show how half o f the slab was discretized and nodes were numbered. H alf slab has been discretized into 5 nodes.

As shown above in Fig. 29, `Stress x ' represents the stress in x direction, negative when bottom o f the slab is in tension; `Stress y ' is the stress in y direction, negative when bottom o f the slab is in tension; `Stress xy' represents shear stress in xy plane. `M ajor' and `Minor' are major and m inor principle stresses in slab when shear stress equals zero, which is used to compare with flexural stress o f concrete, and `Max Shear' represents maximum shear stress in slab.

W arping effect is a significant factor when designing concrete pavement joints; for the same concrete slab if without the warping effect, maximum tensile stress occurs at node ` 1 ' at the bottom o f the slab is 2608 KPa as a tensile stress as shown in Fig. 30 and Fig. 31.

Fig. 31 Stresses at node 7 ' due to uniform load

The result is quite reasonable: as shown in Fig. 32 and Fig. 33 below, the studied concrete slab is experiencing a temperature differential of 0.5°C per centimeter (2.28°F per inch) at night; the top o f the concrete slab is cooler than bottom of the slab. The top tends to contract and the bottom tends to expand, however, the weight of the slab restrains it from expansion and contraction, tensile stress will be induced at the top and compressive stress at the bottom. This pair o f the stress can balance part o f the stress induced by uniform loading at the edge which is in opposite direction, thus compare with 2608 KPa when uniform load alone applied on the slab, the tensile stress at node `T becom e 1346 KPa when warping effect is also considered.

Above calculation was based on the assumption that concrete slab was built on liquid foundation; since KENSLAB can offer three different types of foundation for analysis: liquid, soild or layer; even though liquid foundation is a simple approach as it requires less computer time and storage, solid foundation is still a more realistic solution to treat concrete pavement problems.

A nother important feature o f KENSLABS is to evaluate the contact condition between concrete pavem ent and sub grade foundation. The above design example 1 was solved basing on the assumption that slab and foundation are always in full contact. Under the full contact condition, the precom pression due to the weight o f the slab is more than the deflection due to temperature curling effect; the spring supports o f subgrade are always able to contact the slab within their elastic range.

Fig. 55 Negative reactive pressure at nodes

According to the report generated by KENSLABS as attached Appendix A (liquid foundation), as shown in Fig. 35 above, support reactive pressures at highlighted nodes are negative in sign (compression positive). That means under temperature curling effect, the slab at these nodes will curl up, since the slab and subgrade are always in full contact within the elastic range o f spring support o f subgrade, the springs o f subgrade will pull the slab back into position, tensile stresses are induced at these nodes as support reactions.

Besides the condition o f full contact, the slab and foundation can be in partial contact when the slab is subjected to curling or pumping before any load applications. Under the partial contact condition, initial gaps between slab and subgrade may or may not exist depending on whether there is pum ping or plastic deformation of subgrade induced by repeated heavy traffic. Under a high intensity o f traffic, some supporting spring of subgrade will fail to function elastically, gaps will form at these locations.

48

KENSLABS is able to evaluate the contact condition for partial contact with applied load for both
liquid and solid foundations, and a two-step analysis is recommended when analyzing such cases. M ost importantly, in the case o f partial contact, the weight o f the slab must be considered in order to counterbalance the positive reactive forces.

In the case o f liquid foundation, firstly, the gaps and precompression due to temperature curling, weight o f the slab and initial gaps are pre-determined (gaps are positive in sign and precom pression is negative in sign); secondly, using the gaps and precompression obtained from the first step to calculate the stresses and displacements under the applied load. In the case o f solid foundation, the contact condition is determined by the reactive forces and precompression due to tem perature curling, weight o f the slab and initial gaps. Compressive reactive forces are positive in sign, which means slab and subgrade are in contact. Negative (tensile) reactive force m eans slab and subgrade are not in contact. All tensile reactive forces are assigned to zero and the program will automatically run iteration cycles until there is no negative (tensile) reactive force o f subgrade. The procedure o f two-step analysis will be briefly introduced in Appendix A.

3.2.2 Analysis nsisï^g STAAD-III STAAD-III. developed by REI, Research Engineers Inc., is another powerful finite element
program for analyzing linear and nonlinear, static and dynamic three-dimensional concrete, aluminum, tim ber and steel structures. The above stress analysis example will be solved once again by 5 TÆ4 Z )-///program.

STAAD-III grouped all types o f structures into four c a t e g o r i e s a SPACE structure is a threedimensional framed structure with loads applied on any plane; a PLANE structure is a twodimensional structure bound by a global X-Y coordinate system with loads in the same plane; a

TRUSS structure is a structure consists o f truss members which can have only axial forces and no
bending in m em bers; a FLOOR structure is a two-dimensional or three-dimensional structure with no horizontal movement. In this case, we define the concrete pavement slab as a SPACE structure.

In order to specify the structure geometry, STAAD-III uses Cartesian coordinate system as global coordinate system to define joint locations and loading directions. The Cartesian coordinate system as shown in Fig. 36 follows the orthogonal right hand rule; the translational degrees o f freedom are denoted by ui, U2, U3 and the rotational degrees of freedom are denoted by U 4 , uj and U6-

The local coordinate system also follows the right hand rule, but it associates with each member. A s shown in Fig. 37 above, the beam member with starting node "i" and end node "j ", the positive direction o f local X axis is joining node "i" to "j " and projecting in the same direction. All element force output is in the local coordinate system.

Similar to other finite element software, in order to save computing time, similar elements should be num bered sequentially in STAAD-III; and when assigning nodes to elements, nodes should be specified either clockwise or counter clockwise. The program also automatically generate a node at element center; after running the program, element force output is available at the center o f the element.

STAAD-III hm\ds the finite element model through text input file. The text file contains a series
o f commands such as `joint coordinates' and `repeat', `joint coordinate command specifies joint

51

coordinates for specific elements in the global Cartesian coordinate system; `repeat' command IS i used to define jo int locations by same size increments. The following Fig. 38 and Fig. 39 show how the joint coordinates are specified and elements are numbered for design example 1.

The whole slab has been discretized into 10 % 22 - 220 elements; and the whole structure contains 11 x 23 = 253 nodes as shown above. The 45 KN (10100 lbs) uniformly distributed load is applied on a 23 cm x 33 cm -7 5 0 cm^ (116 inch^) area where element 101, 102 and element 111, 112 are located. Similar as KENSLABS, when discretize the slab into finite elements, for concentrated loads, we always try to locate the external loads right on or close to the nodes, and for uniform distributed loads, we always try to locate the boundary o f area load right on boundary o f the elements.

53

STAAD-III can specify temperature load on members and elements by applying `temp load'
command. W ithin the temp load command line, both f] and f2 should be specified where f]

is the change in temperature which will cause axial elongation in the members or uniform expansion in element; f2 is the temperature differential from the top to the bottom of the member or elem ent (Ttop --Tbottom), it is the f; that cause the member to bend. In this case, fi = 0 and f^ --10°C (18T ).

For analysis purpose, STAAD-III can separately calculate the stress under different loading cases with the using o f `load combination' command. In this case, four group o f load cases are specified: load case 1: uniformly distributed external load alone; load case 2: temperature load alone (upward curling); load case 3: uniformly distributed load with upward curling (Ttop Tbottom = -10°C); load case 4: uniformly distributed load with downward curling (Ttop - Tbottom = 10°C).

The other necessary information to be provided is modulus o f elasticity o f concrete slab E = 27.6 X 10^ K Pa (4 X 10* psi) and Poisson's ratio u = 0.15. STAAD-III is also capable o f modeling elastic spring support for sub grade foundation by using `support' and `elastic mat command, in this case, subgrade reaction k = 55 MN/m^ (202.7 pci), this means the analysis is basing on the assumption that the slab is built on liquid foundation.

Refer to attached Appendix B for detailed report o f results; the critical stresses at the centre o f element `101' under uniformly distributed load are listed as below. Element forces at centre o f element `101':

Load case 1 (uniformly distributed load alone):
Bottom o f slab: 2229 KPa (tension)

Load case 2 (upward curling):
Bottom o f slab: -1246 KPa (compression)

Load case 3 (uniformly distributed load with upward curling):
Bottom o f slab: 988 KPa (tension)

Load case 4 (uniformed distributed load with downward curling):
Bottom o f slab: 3474 KPa (tension)

55

Comparing the result from KENSLABS and STAAD-III based on the assumption that the slab is built on liquid foundation, when only external load applies, 2608 KPa at node `1' was calculated by KENSLABS and 2229 KPa at the center o f element `101' was calculated by STAAD-III. When considering external load combined with upward curling effect, 1346 KPa at node `1' was calculated by KENSLABS and 988 KPa at the center o f element `101 ' was calculated by STAAD-

III.

M any factors m ay affect the precision o f the calculation. First o f all, the size o f finite elements can be one o f the important factors. Normally the coarser the finite element mesh, the smaller stresses and deflections we can get, thus the coarser mesh may lead to unsafe design. Secondly,

KENSLABS program provides the stresses at nodes, while STAAD-III provides the stresses at the
center o f the elements.

As a finite element program designed specifically for pavement stress analysis, KENSLABS has several advantages in term o f simplicity. For KENSLABS, When the slab and loading exhibit symmetry, only one-half or one-quarter of the slab need to be considered. While for STAAD-III, the finite element program for general plane and space structures, the program was not tailored to recognize `free edge', `jo in t' or `centerline' of the slab like KENSLABS. Especially for the design exam ple 1, the slab is subjected to combined effect of edge loading at center o f slab and temperature loading, the whole pavement slab need to be studied since center portion o f slab experience critical stresses when the whole slab curling upward or downward. Besides,

KENSLABS is able to provide straightforward answers as far as we are concerned in the
pavem ent design problems, for instance, stress at the comer of the slab. Furthermore,

56

KENSLABS has three foundation options to choose, and solid foundation is believed to be the
solution close to real conditions. The ability to evaluate contact condition between slab and subgrade is another advantage o f KENSLABS program. In reality, the slab and subgrade are not always in full contact due to temperature curling or pumping. For old pavements under high intensity o f traffic, plastic deformation will form at some locations o f subgrade at where initial gaps exist. KENSLABS is able to determine the contact condition for partial contact cases with applied load; the stresses and displacements of slab can be analyzed basing on pre-determined gaps and precompression.

Design example 2 - the study on dowel bars at transverse joint

Two 30 centimeter (11.8 inch) by 30 centimeter (11.8 inch) loaded area, each weighing 60 KN (13470 lbs) and spaced at 210 centimeter (82.7 inch) apart, are applied at the joint with the outside loaded area adjacent to the pavement edge as shown below. Determine the maximum bearing stress between concrete and dowel. The joint has an opening o f 0.5 centimeter (0.2 inch) and the dowels are 2.5 centimeter (0.98 inch) in diameter and 30 centimeter (11.8 inch) on centers.

Fig. 43 Numbering o f nodes fo r design example 2 (STAAD-III)

Firstly, we use STAAD-III program to solve the problem. In this case, 3 m (118 inches) o f the pavem ent slab on both sides o f the transverse joint is studied. 30 cm (11.8 inch) by 30 cm (11.8 inch) square elements are defined; there are totally 12 x 20 = 240 finite elements. Fig. 42 and Fig. 43 above showed how the joint coordinates are specified and elements are numbered.

In order to properly simulate the dowel bars, we have to fully understand how dowel bars function at transverse joint. Dowel bars are fixed at one end and free to move at other end, they are used across transverse joints to transfer only vertical loads. Thus dowel bars can be simulated as a group o f steel beams members fixed at one end and hinged at other end between two concrete slabs. From the given information, 2.5 cm (1 inch) diameter dowel bars are arranged at

59

30 cm (11.8 inch) center to center, there are totally 13 steel beam members are defined, for instance, the steel beam member connecting node 131 and node 144 represent one dowel bar.

Since dowel bars do not transfer any moment or horizontal movement, STAAD-III allows specification o f release o f degrees of freedom for specific members by using "release" command. In this case, since dowel bars transfer only vertical load along Y-axis, member force F% , Fg and mom ent Mx, My and Mg has to be released.

Finally, 60 KN (13470 lbs) uniformly distributed loads are applied on two 30 cm (11.8 inch) by 30 cm (11.8 inch) areas, which are 210 cm (82.7 inch) apart, STAAD-III can specify uniformly distributed load applied directly on elements by the `pressure' command. As show in Fig. 45 below, area loads are applied on element 109 and 116, uniform pressure equals to 60 x 10 /900 cm^ --667 KPa (96.7 psi).

Other necessary information shall be provided including modulus o f elasticity o f concrete slab E = 27.6 X 10^ KPa (4 x 10^ psi); Poisson's ratio v = 0.15; modulus of elasticity o f steel dowel beam Ed = 2 x 10^ KPa (29 x 10^ psi); cross sectional area o f steel bar A = x x d^/4 = 4.9 cm^

STAAD-Ill is also capable o f modeling elastic spring support for subgrade foundation by using `support' and `elastic m at' command, in this case, subgrade reaction k = 80 MN/m^ (294.9 pci). This means the analysis is based on the assumption that the slab is built on liquid foundation.

Since the maxim um shear force on the steel member `301' Pt is 13.11 KN (2937 pounds), concrete bearing stress 0\, can be determined by Ub = K x p, x (2 + jS x z) / (4 x where the jo int width z = 0.5 cm (0.2 inch). (7b= 4655 psi (32 Mpa). x Ed x Id),

£ = 27.5 inch (70 cm). From the above discussion about dowel group reaction, we normally
assume that the shear in each dowel decreases with the distance o f the dowel from the point o f loading. Being maximum for the dowel under or nearest to the point of loading and zero at a distance o f 1.8f, 1.8 x f - 126 cm; since two uniformly distributed area loads are 210 cm apart.

63

the shear force on steel member 308 wUl not affect the concrete bearing stress under steel m em ber 301. Thus, the maximum bearing stress between concrete and dowel is 32 Mpa {4655 psi).

3.3.2 Analysis using KENSLABS:
N ow we use KENSLABS to solve the same problem, a different set of finite element arrangement is laid out as shown in Fig. 47 and Fig. 48 as below. 4 m (157.5 inch) length o f the pavement slab on both sides o f transverse joint is studied. On one slab, there are total 8 x 5 = 4 0 elements and 9 X 6 --54 nodes. The system o f units for this example is English (length in inch, force in pound, stress in psi and dowel K value and subgrade reaction in pci).

KENSLABS can define area loads by specifying the boundaries of the load, in this case, the
boundary along X-axis o f two area loads is the same, from 145.7 inch (370 cm) to 157.5 inch (400 cm); the Y boundaries are from 0 to 11.8 inch (30 cm) and from 82.7 inch (210 cm) to 94.5 inch (240 cm).

Other necessary information is modulus of elasticity of concrete slab E = 4 ^ 10^ psi (27. 6 x 10^ KPa); P o isso n 's ratio v = 0.15; modulus of subgrade reaction k = 295 pci (80 MN/m ); dowel bars are 0.98 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter and 11.8 inch (30 cm) on centers, thus totally 13 dowel bars are used at the transverse joint; joint is 0.2 inch (0.5 cm) wide. Two uniformly distributed area loads 13470 pounds (60 KN) were applied on two 11.8 inch (30 cm) by 11.8 inch (30 cm) areas, load pressure equals to 13470 / (11.8 x 11.8) = 96.7 psi (667 KPa). Assume modulus o f dowel support K -- 1.5 x 10^ pci (406950 KN/m ).

Com paring the result o f two programs, when we use STAAD-III, maximum member shear force occur at m em ber `301 ' which is the first dowel located at the edge o f the slab, shear-Y = -13.11 KN (-2937 pounds); maximum bearing stress between concrete and that dowel is 32 M pa (4655 psi). For KENSLABS, if under the assumption that the slab was built on liquid foundation, m axim um shear in one dowel bar occurs under node `46' where locates the first dowel at the

68

edge o f the slab, shear-Y

-2653 pounds (-11.8 KN); maximum bearing stress o f concrete

betw een concrete and that dowel is 4226 psi (29 Mpa).

As w e discussed before, many factors m ay affect the accuracy o f the calculation, the size o f elem ents can be one important factor. Normally the coarser the finite element mesh, the smaller stresses and deflections we can get, thus the coarser mesh may lead to unsafe design. Secondly,

KENSLABS program provides the stresses at nodes, while STAAD-III provides the stresses at the
center o f the elements.

As a finite elem ent program designed specifically for pavement stress analysis, KENSLABS has several advantages in term o f simplicity. For the design example 2, KENSLABS is able to provide straightforw ard answers that we concern in the pavement design, for instance, concrete bearing stress under the dowel bar. Furthermore, KENSLABS has three foundation options to choose, and solid foundation is believed to be the solution close to real conditions.

Chapter 4: Conclusions

O ver the past few decades, pavement engineering has gone through considerable developments. Even though Em pirical Method is a simple design approach which has been adopted by many agencies, there are still some drawbacks. One o f the drawbacks might be that the set o f calibrated equations or Nom ograph can only be applied to common environmental, material and traffic conditions; w hen these conditions change for specific jobs, the design outputs will no longer be reliable. A s a design method combining engineering experience and the analysis o f mechanical characteristics o f materials, the Mechanistic-Empirical method has been widely accepted and the transition from Empirical Design Method to Mechanistic-Empirical Method is becoming a near future trend.

The m ost practical and widely used stress analysis method for flexible pavement is B urm ister's Elastic Layered Theory. Horizontal tensile strain at the bottom o f the asphalt layer and the vertical com pressive strain at the top o f the subgrade layer are two critical measurements for quantitatively predicting fatigue and rutting damage under repeated traffic load. The most practical m ethod for analyzing rigid pavement is Finite Element Method. Transverse cracking and jo in t faulting are two major types of distress that adversely affect the concrete pavem ent perform ance. Transverse cracking is the effect of fatigue damage, and joint faulting is the result o f a com bination o f m any factors: repeated heavy axle load, poor load transfer across the joint, erosion o f the supporting base material and upward curling of the slab, etc. Joint faulting has adverse im pact on riding quality.

70

KENSLABS and STAAD-III are both commercial Finite Element software. They are both capable
o f analyzing stress state and deflection o f concrete pavement under applied loads and tem perature loads. For KENSLABS, when the slab and loading exhibit symmetry, only one-half or one-quarter o f the slab need to be considered. While for STAAD-III, the finite element program for general plane and space structures, the program is not tailored to recognize `free edge , jo in t or centerline' o f the slab, the whole pavement slab information need to be input into the system.

KENSLABS is designed specifically for studying concrete pavement; it is able to provide
straightforw ard solutions for pavement design purpose. For instance, the bearing stress o f concrete under dowel bar and stress at comer o f the slab under load. Moreover, KENSLABS has three types o f foundation, liquid, solid and layered. Since the modulus o f subgrade reaction k is not a true characteristic o f subgrade soil behaviors, solid foundation is a more realistic solution to treat pavem ent problems. The ability to evaluate contact condition between slab and subgrade is another advantage o f KENSLABS program. In reality, the slab and subgrade are not always in full contact due to tem perature curling or pumping. For old pavements under high intensity o f traffic, plastic deform ation will form at some locations o f subgrade at where initial gaps exist.

KENSLABS is able to determine the contact condition for partial contact cases with applied load;
the stresses and displacements o f slab can be analyzed basing on pre-detcrmined gaps and precom pression.

As one o f the Finite Element software commonly used by many structure engineers, STAAD-III is m ore suitable for studying general plane and space structures. Comparing with KENSLABS,

71

STAAD-III is a relatively complicated Finite Element software. Training and experience are
necessary for w riting the text input file properly. Even though STAAD-III can provide precise calculations for general plane and space structures containing m ore elements and nodes,

KENSLABS is m ore suitable for pavement design purposes.

NO TCO N --number o f nodes not in contact, maximum 120 nodes can be specified where slab and subgrade are assumed not in contact. The concrete slab and subgrade foundation can be in full contact or partial contact depending on whether there is separation due to curling or pumping before any load applications. Nodal numbers at which the slab and subgrade are not in contact have to be specified, and at those nodes subgrade reactive forces are assumed to be 0. In the case o f liquid foundation, at these nodes initially not in contact, the slab and subgrade m ay or may not be in contact with load applications depending on how many iteration cycles (refer to NCYCLE below) is specified. If only one iteration cycle is specified, the slab and foundation at these nodes will never be m contact with the load applications. In the case o f solid foundation, the nodes specified as not in contact will never be in contact, thus in the case o f solid foundation NOTCON should be assigned `0 ' unless users are very sure that these nodes will definitely be out o f contact.

nodal numbers at where the slab and subgrade are not in contact (nodal

When the pavem ent slab and subgrade foundation are assumed to be in partial contact, initial gap m ay or m ay not exist depending on whether there is pumping or plastic deformation o f subgrade induced by repeated heavy traffic. For old pavements under high intensity o f traffic, plastic deformation will form at the subgrade; elastic support of subgrade will fail to function at some nodes. For new pavements, each elastic spring o f foundation is in good condition thus no initial gap exists. In the case of partial contact will no initial gaps, N G A P = `O'; otherwise, nodal numbers at where initial gaps exist and the sizes o f the gap shall be specified. Initial gaps, temperature curling and the weight of the slab are used to determine contact condition at nodes before any load applications for partially contacted problems; a twostep analysis is recommended when using KENSLABS to solve such problems (refer to IN PU T below). IN PU T - input o f gaps from previous problem, `1' for yes and `0 ' for no. KENSLABS studies partial contact condition with applied load by two-step analysis: In the case o f liquid foundation, (1) determine the gap and precompression between slab and subgrade due to temperature curling, self-weight and initial gaps; (2) use the gap and precom pression obtained from first step to determine the stresses and displacements under applied load. As shown below, in `data set 1 , INPUT 0 , NCYCLE -- 10 and

N W T = `1' (refer to NCYCLE and NWT below); in `data set 2 ', INPUT = `1', NCYCLE = 10 and N W T = `O'. These two data sets are established in one study case, the first data

79

set studies the gaps and precompression o f slab under temperature curling, self-weight and initial gaps; the second data set determines the stresses and displacement o f slab under applied load. These two steps are executed in the same run and one immediately after the other.

In the case o f solid foundation, similar to the two-step analysis for liquid foundation, the contact condition o f slab and subgrade is determined by analyzing reactive forces and precom pression due to temperature curling, initial gaps and self-weight o f the slab. W hen the reactive forces are compressive forces that mean slab and subgrade are in contact, when the reactive forces are negative (tensile) forces, they are assigned to zero and the program runs iteration cycles until no negative (tensile) reactive force is calculated at any node. N TEM P - temperature curling, `1 ' for yes and 'O' for no. N W T - weight o f slabs, assign 'O' if weight is not considered and assign ` 1' if weight is considered. In the case o f full contact o f slab and foundation, it is not necessary to consider the weight o f the slab; while in the case o f partial contact, the weight o f the slab m ust be considered. U nder the full contact condition, the weight of the slab will cause uniform precom pression before temperature effect and load application, the slab and foundation will rem ain in contact under temperature gradient because the deflections due to curling are sm aller than the precompression. The stresses and deflections due to curling and loading can be determined separately and each independently of the other. U nder the partial contact condition, in order to determine the stresses and deflection due to applied load, the deformed shape o f the slab before any load applications must be determ ined first. Thus, a two-step analysis is recommended for partial contact condition w ith applied load. As stated above for INPUT, in dataset 1, NWT = `1', the gaps and precom pression due to self-weight o f the slab, initial gap and temperature curling is

80

firstly determined, in dataset 2, NW T = `O', the stresses and deflection due to applied load is calculated basing on the gaps and precompression obtained from the first step. N CY CLE --maximum number o f cycles for checking contact condition. In the case o f full contact, NCYCLE = `0' and in the case of partial contact, NCYCLE = `10'. In the case o f liquid foundation, the program initially assumes the slab and foundation are in full contact for all partially contacted problems and calculate the gaps and precom pression due to temperature curling, initial gaps and self-weight o f the slab. If it turn out there is no gap between slab and sub grade due to temperature curling, initial gap and self-weight, no iteration cycle is necessary; otherwise up to 10 iterations cycles will be perform ed until the gaps at nodes calculated are same in sign and within tolerance o f iteration (as per DEL below) as that in the previous cycle. In the case o f solid foundation, reactive forces and precompression is used to determine the contact condition for slab under temperature curling, self-weight and initial gaps. If the reactive forces at nodes calculated are all positive in sign (compressive forces), that m eans the slab and sub grade are in full contact, no iteration cycle is needed; otherwise, all negative reactive forces are assigned to zero and the program will run iteration cycles until there is no negative reactive force calculated. TEM P -- temperature differential between top and bottom, TEMP = temperature at bottom o f slab - temperature at top of slab. Positive for upward curling and negative for dow nw ard curling. CT - coefficient o f thermal expansion of concrete, recommended value is 5 x 10'^ in/in/°F or 9 x 10'Vmm/mm/°C. D EL - tolerance for iteration, 0.001 is suggested by the program. FM A X --m axim um allowable vertical deflection at node NNCK (as per above). 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) is recommended by the program, if the vertical displacement calculated by the program is greater than FMAX, the program will stop.

S PC O N l - spring constant for shear transfer for each joint. SPCONl = `0 ' if dowel bars are used. W hen grain interlock is used as loading transferring media, the stiffness o f joint is represented by shear spring constant C,, and moment spring constant C @ as mentioned above in Chapter 2. SPCON2 - spring constant for moment transfer for each joint. SPC0N 2 = `0' if dowel bars are used. Since load is transferred across the joint mainly by shear, it is generally agreed that Ce = 0 in most occasions. SCKV - m odulus o f dowel support K, also called steel-concrete K value (pci or KN/m^) as m entioned above in Chapter 2. Suggested K values range from 3 x 10^ to 1.5 x 10^ pci (81.5 to 409 GN/m^). If SPCONl/2 SCKV = `O'. BD - `O'.

BD --dowel bar diameter (inch or cm). If SPCONl/2

BS - dowel bar spacing (inch or cm). If SPCONl/2 t^`0', BS = `O'. W J --width o f the joint (inch or cm). If SPCONl/2 ?^`0 ', WJ = `O'. GDC - gap betw een dowel bars and concrete. In the case o f no gap exists between dowel bars and concrete, GDC = `O'. N N A J - num ber o f nodes at each joint, maximum 15 nodes can be defined. In the case o f dow el bars are uniform ly distributed along the joint, NNAJ = `O'.
