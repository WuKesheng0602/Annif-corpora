ABSTRACT

Pilot plant study o f Aqueous Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate degradation by combined Advance Oxidation and Biological Processes
Gelareh Bankian Tabrizi MASc, Chemical Engineering Program Ryerson University Toronto, 2004

Photochemical degradation of linear alkylbeneze sulfonate (LAS) using a pilot plant photoreactor is studied. LAS at 100 mg/L is degraded by UV-254 and UV/H 2 O2 . Degradation o f LAS is effectively enhanced by 720 mg/L H 2 O 2 . Moreover, the effectiveness o f photo-treatment on the biodegradability o f LAS is examined. Both pre treated and untreated LAS are used in biological experiments. Combination o f UV-254 with optimum concentration o f H 2 O2 effectively enhanced the biodegradability of LAS. However, LAS at 100 mg/L can inhibit the growth of microorganisms. It is observed that the adaptation o f activated sludge increases the biodégradation of LAS. However, due to the presence o f intermediates in the effluent of the photoreactor, the biodegradability o f this effluent is less than the biodegradability o f the same as the concentration o f untreated LAS. It is also observed that using the integration of UV/H 2 O 2 and biological processes instead o f single step o f UV/H 2 O 2 , reduces the total residence time in chemical reactor while obtains the desired total efficiency.

INTRODUCTION
Each year the ecosystem receives large quantities o f surfactants, which are the m ain com ponent o f w idely used laundry detergents, cleaners, and shampoos. Moreover, surfactants are w idely used in industries. Among them , linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), the m ost com m on synthetic anionic surfactant used in dom estic and industrial detergents, has a global production o f 2.4x10^ tonnes per year (De A lm eida et. al., 1994). LAS w as first introduced in 1965 as a biodegradable com pound to substitute nonbiodegradable com pounds in detergents (Huang et al., 2000). It is produced by sulfonation o f linear alkylbenzene with sulfur trioxide. Detergents contain 5-25% LAS and the length o f its chain ranges from Cio to Cm (W HO, 1996). As it was reported that higher concentration o f LAS does not respond to biological treatm ents (Zhang et al., 1998), m any investigators have tried degrading LAS using chemical processes. Among the several chem ical treatm ents, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as UV and U V /H 2 O 2 have been used as an attractive alternative for the treatm ent o f wastewaters containing bioresistant compounds successfully. AOPs are technologies for the

production o f highly reactive intermediates, m ainly hydroxyl radicals ('OH), which are able to oxidize alm ost all organic pollutants. During photolysis, UV light with the w avelength energy o f m ore than bond energy can break the bond directly. W hile in the case that UV is com bined with hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2 absorbs light at 254 nm to produce hydroxyl radicals. These hydroxyl radicals react with the organic pollutants producing aldehydes, alcohols, and carboxylic acids. In the case o f complete

m ineralization, the products would be CO 2 and H 2 O. AOPs have shown their worthiness for toxic com pounds elim ination in water and w astew ater treatment, however, the total m ineralization through these processes is very expensive. On the other hand, biological treatm ent is relatively cheap and reliable process, but there are m any non-biodegradable and bioresistant com pounds. Therefore, a com bination o f both processes would m ean a cheaper option for total organic degradation from a toxic w astew ater or a wastewater containing refractory organics. It has been observed by m any investigators that the

coupling of a bioreactor and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) could reduce the final concentrations o f the effluent to the desired values. However, optimizing the total cost of the treatment is a challenge, as AOPs are much more expensive than biological processes alone. Therefore, an appropriate design should not only consider the ability of this coupling to reduce the concentration of organic pollutants, but also try to obtain the desired results in a cost effective process.

The objectives o f this research were to investigate the possibility of degrading an anionic surfactant, linear alkylbenzene sulfonate, by combining photolytic with biological treatment. The following experiments were conducted to study that possibility. · Photolytic treatment of LAS with UV-254 and combination of UV and H2 O 2 to find the rate o f degradation o f each process · · Effects of photolytic pretreatment of LAS by UV/H 2 O2 on its biodegradability Combination o f photolytic pretreatment of LAS by UV/H 2 O 2 and subsequent aerobic biological treatment using unadapted and adapted activated sludge for an effective treatment o f LAS

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE BACKGROUND

This chapter is divided into tw o parts. The first part deals with different advanced oxidation processes for the treatm ent o f aqueous organics. M oreover, a comprehensive review on the com bination o f chem ical and biological treatm ent is presented based on the previous work (Bankian and M ehrvar, 2004). The effects o f different param eters during this com bination, depending on the type o f treatm ent, are described. A brief discussion

o f the com pounds used in this research is described in the second part o f this chapter.

2.1 Introduction
Increased knowledge about the consequences from w ater pollution, public desire for better quality o f water, having a better environment, dim inishing w ater resources, the rapid growth, and the industrial developm ent have created the need to have regulations such as U nited States Environm ental Protection Agency (USEPA). Also the reuse of the m unicipal and industrial w astew ater and the recovery o f potential pollutants used in industrial processes become m ore critical. Hence, the role o f the w astew ater treatment is becom ing more and more im portant as both the effluent quality and quantity are subjected to m ore strict regulations. Technological advancem ent to m inim ize the use o f w astew ater may help reduce the effluent quantity, whereas cost-effective wastewater treatm ent can be adopted to reduce pollutant concentrations to acceptable levels.

W astewaters from chem ical, pharm aceutical, and dye industries m ost often contain significant am ount o f non-biodegradable organic com pounds. The elim ination o f these non-biodegradable toxic contam inants is required before biological treatment. A lthough the biological treatm ent o f wastewater is often the m ost econom ical alternative process w hen com pared to other treatm ent options such as A O Ps, the ability o f a com pound to undergo biological degradation depends on a variety o f factors. Such

factors include the concentrations, chemical structures, and the biodegradability of the target molecules. Characteristics of the wastewater, such as pH, alkalinity, or the presence o f an inhibitory compound could also play an important role in the biological degradation of pollutants. Although many organic molecules are readily biodegradable, many other synthetic and naturally existing organic molecules are biorecalcitrant, i.e., resistant to biodégradation. Depending on the nature of the pollutants and the level of contaminants, detoxification might be difficult and/or expensive to achieve by conventional biological methods. In such cases, biological processes alone are not able to reach effluent standards for the discharge into municipal sewer or into surface water; therefore, a pre-treatme>'t . post-treatment is required. The choice of the correct

combination system must be Larried out considering several factors, both technical (treatment efficiency, plant simplicity, flexibility, etc.) and economical (capital and operating costs including reagent and energy consumption, sludge and gas disposal, maintenance, etc.) aspects. In several cases, specific experimental tests are required in order to assess actual efficiency and proper treatment conditions. Moreover, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as UV, UV/H2O2, UV/O3, UV/H2O2/O3, and UV/Ti0 2 have been used as an attractive alternative for the treatment of these types of wastewaters. AOPs are technologies for the production of highly reactive intermediates, mainly hydroxyl radicals ('OH), which are able to oxidize almost all organic pollutants. Advanced oxidation processes can reduce pollutant concentrations, and some processes produce more oxidized compounds, which are in most cases more easily biodegradable than the former ones. Although AOPs are expensive to install and operate, they may be unavoidable for the tertiary treatment of refractory organics present in industrial effluents to allow safe discharge o f industrial contaminants. Despite the effectiveness of AOPs, there are several scenarios that make them economically disadvantageous. Effective treatment o f a particular industrial wastewater may require a combination of AOPs and biological processes in order to exploit their individual quantities and, thus, reach the desired quality within reasonable economical limits.

On one hand, AOPs have shown their worthiness for toxic compounds elimination in water and wastewater treatment, however, the total mineralization through these

processes is very expensive. On the other hand, biological treatm ent is relatively cheap and reliable process but there are substances, which are unable to deal with. A com bination o f both processes w ould mean a cheaper option for total organic degradation from a toxic w astew ater or a wastewater containing refractory organics.

It has been shown that the combination o f biological and advanced oxidation processes has the following advantages (Lee et al., 2001): 1. Synergistic effect as chemical and biological processes are accom panim entf o f each other. 2. Protection o f the biological culture from inhibitory or toxic compounds by chem ical pre-treatment. 3. Reduction in chemical dosage cost by the use o f cost-effective biological pre or post-treatm ent. 4. Flexibility in total residence time as a result o f different choices that is possible for chemical and biological reactor residence times in a constant efficiency. 5. A chieving com plete pollutant m ineralization while m inim izing the total cost.

2.2 Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)
A O Ps are fairly new technologies which have been developed since 1975 (Zhou and Sm ith, 2001) and are o f considerable interest in water and w astew ater treatment. They are prom ising technologies for the rem oval o f contam inated ground and surface w ater as well as wastew aters containing non-biodegradable or inhibitory organics to m icrobial growth. The main advantage o f AOPs is their ability to destroy the organic com pounds in w ater without transferring them to another m edium or generating secondary waste disposal problems. A broad range o f compounds may be treated by A O Ps. A O Ps work by destroying the organic com pounds in water and wastewater by oxidation. The m ost com m only used AOPs use H 2 O 2 , O 3 , or O 2 as an oxidant. These involve producing free radicals such as OH, from the m olecular oxidant by means o f energy o r catalyst. F or example, hydrogen peroxide may generate hydroxyl radicals in the presence o f UV light with the wavelength o f less than 254 nm based on the following reaction:

H^0^+hv-^2'0H

(2. 1)

These hydroxyl radicals are able to attack pollutants by addition to double bond, abstraction a hydrogen atom, or transferring an electron to a halogenated compound according to the following reactions (Braun and Oliveros, 1997): -Addition -Hydrogen abstraction - Electron transfer 'OH+ X^C=CX^^X^CiOH)-C'X^ *OH + RH *OH + RX H ^0 + R' 0H~ + XR*' (2.2) (2.3) (2.4)

where R represents a typical hydrocarbon and X represent a halogenated group.

The products of the organic molecule could be intermediates, or at the final stage either HCO 3', Cl', NO 3 ', CO 2 , or H2 O.

The oxidation o f organics is defined by the extent of their degradation to the final oxidation products as follows: 1. Primary degradation which is a structural change in parent compounds. 2. Satisfactory degradation, a primary degradation that reduces the toxicity or converts non-biodegradable organics to biodegradable ones. 3. Complete mineralization or ultimate degradation, changing the organics into CO2 and water. 4. Improper degradation, a change in the structure of the parent compounds in a way that increases the toxicity of the wastewater.

An important disadvantage of AOPs is their high capital and operating costs in comparison to the conventional biological treatment. However, by considering their advantages, AOPs could be used as a pre- or post-treatment step to enhance the biodegradability of the wastewater containing recalcitrant or inhibitory organics, and even rendering the wastewater ambient for reuse.

2.2.1

Processes for generating oxidant radicals
The versatility o f AOPs is also enhanced by the fact that they offer different ways

o f producing hydroxyl radicals, which allow gaining specific treatm ent requirements. The follow ing is a list o f different AOPs, which are able to produce the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals;

Types o f radicals generated by different m ethods o f AOPs are as listed T able 2.1 (Gulyas, 1997).

2.3 Biological Treatment of Wastewater
Biological oxidation has been the m ain technology capable o f reducing the contam inant level o f w astew ater for many years. The overall objectives o f the biological w astew ater treatm ent are to transform biodegradable com pounds into acceptable end products, transform or rem ove nutrients, capture suspended solids, and incorporate nonsettleable colloidal solids into biological floes. The objective o f the industrial wastewater treatm ent is to rem ove and reduce the concentration o f organic and inorganic compounds. A lthough some o f the organics are toxic or inhibitory to m icrobial growth, a preliminary chem ical oxidation step may elim inate refractory or toxic substances. The m ain benefit o f

The principal biological processes used for wastewater treatm ent can be divided into the follow ing m ain categories (M etcalf and Eddy, 2003, Eckenfelder, 2000): · Suspended grow th processes, in which microorganisms responsible for the conversion o f the organic m atter in the wastewater are suspended w ithin the liquid (for exam ple: activated sludge and aerated lagoons). The degree o f organics rem oval for the activated sludge process is approximately 90% and for the aerated lagoons it is high in sum m er but not good in winter. · A ttached growth (biofilm ) processes, in which m icroorganisms responsible for the conversion o f the organic m atter in the wastewater, are attached to some inert m edium , such as rocks, slag, ceramic, or plastic materials (for exam ple: trickling filters, rotary biological contactors (RBCs), and packed-bed reactors). The degree o f the rem oval for these processes is intermediate to high depending on the loading o f wastewater. · A naerobic processes: such as sludge blanket and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket. Their degree o f removal is intermediate. The successful design and operation require an understanding o f the type o f

m icroorganism s and organic com pounds, the environmental factors that affect the perform ance, and the types o f reactors involved. The successful operation and removal o f dissolved com pounds in w astew ater are done by a variety o f m icroorganism s, principally bacteria. M icroorganism s oxidize the dissolved and particulate carbonaceous organics into sim ple products and extra biom ass. Am ong the environmental factors affecting the treatm ent process, tem perature and pH have im portant effects on the selection, survival, and the grow th o f m icroorganism s. The optim al growth o f a specific microorganism occurs in a fairy narrow range o f tem perature that differs from one group o f bacteria to th e other. M ost bacteria cannot tolerate pH levels above 9.5 or below 4.0. Generally, the optim u m pH for the grow th and survival o f the bacteria lies betw een 6.5 and 7.5.

2.3 Combined chemical and biological processes for the treatment of organic pollutants in water and wastewater
Previously, a wild range of studies on the integration of biological and advanced oxidation processes prior to 1995 have been reviewed (Scott and Ollis, 1995). In this study, recent developments (1996-2003) on the integration of chemical and biological processes for the degradation and treatment of problematic pollutants in wastewater are classified in Table 2.2 (Bankian and Mehrvar, 2004). The studies were conducted on the integration of chemical and biological processes with different objectives, such as modeling the degradation in chemical and biological reactors, observing the effects of combination on total removal and comparing with individual processes, comparing the effects o f different AOPs on the biodégradation of a certain compound, and investigating the effects of different parameters on the combination of processes. The compounds used were mostly difficult to degrade by biological processes alone and needed post- or pre treatment by AOPs. In most cases there was just one chemical reactor followed by biological reactor or vice versa in series. However, there is one case in which the chemical and biological reactors are parallel (Lee et al., 2001), three cases in which there are more than two stages for the treatment (Helble et al., 1999; Karer et al., 1997; and Fahmi et al, 2003), and four cases in which there is a biological pre-treatment followed by a chemical oxidation treatment step, which is followed by further biological treatment (Bertanza et al. 2001; Ito et al., 1998; Jochimsen and Jekel, 1997; and Mobius and Tolle, 1997). In such processes, the first biological step removes the biodegradable organics and the chemical reactor increases the biodegradability of residual organics for the second biological step.

As Table 2.2 illustrates, the treatment of some chemicals cannot be usually completed by either biological treatment or AOPs alone. In spite of the fact that AOPs are capable to produce high quality effluent in most cases, the important drawback o f these processes is their high capital and operating costs such as chemicals, electricity, and sludge disposal. However, in order to avoid the high operation costs for complete oxidation, only partial oxidation is desired. It has been shown that a photochemical pre treatment step may enhance the biodegradability of wastewater containing recalcitrant or

10

inhibitory com pounds, if and only if, the interm ediates produced are biodegradable and are m ore soluble and less toxic than the parent compounds. It has been frequently shown that the pre-oxidation by AOPs improves the biodegradability o f non or poorly biodegradable organic compounds and this effect could be due to the change in their m olecular structure. However, little is known about the exact mechanisms during the oxidation. The possible changes after oxidation and their effects on biodegradability could be due to the decrease o f aromacity and destruction o f high m olecular structure, which leads to the formation o f functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and aldehyde (Jochim sen and Jekel, 1997). The effect on biodegradability o f these chemical changes is significant on the enzyme activity. It can also be concluded that the destruction o f toxic substances has positive effect on enzyme activity, whereas the form ation o f toxic m etabolites had a negative effect on the inhibition o f biochemical processes. M oreover, destruction of organic nitrification inhibitors causes an

im provem ent in nitrification processes (Jochim sen and Jekel, 1997).

A s a general treatm ent strategy, four types o f treatm ent for a chemical compound are possible (Bertanza et al., 2001); 1. In some cases only biological treatment alone is sufficient to enhance the effluent quality. 2. In the presence o f some refractory or toxic com pounds in wastewater, chemical pretreatm ent is required. 3. In case biological treatment is not sufficient for biodegradable compounds, chem ical post-treatm ent is also necessary. 4. In some rare cases, com bination o f chem ical and biological treatm ent in multi stages is necessary. A general strategy that can be used to develop a com bined advanced oxidation and biological processes for the treatm ent o f a certain wastewater, which m ight contain non-biodegradable o r toxic organics, is as follows: A s a first step to avoid utilization o f high cost due to AOPs, it m ust be confirm ed that w hether the w astew ater contains recalcitrant or toxic organics. I f the wastewater is biodegradable, conventional biological reactors are used to treat the waste. I f it is

11

confirmed that wastewater contains recalcitrant or toxic organics, it would be pretreated by AOPs to modify the structure of pollutants by transforming them into less toxic and easily biodegradable intermediates, which are degraded in the subsequent biological reactor in a shorter time. This method can also prove to be less expensive in comparison to the AOPs alone and less time consuming compared to the biological process. Moreover, if the effluent from the final biological reactor has met the requirements, it will leave the treatment plant; otherwise it has to go through the previous cycle. There are four types o f wastewater, which have potential for increasing treatment efficiencies by combined processes as follows (Scott and Ollis, 1995)' 1. Recalcitrant compounds 2. Biodegradable wastes with small amounts o f recalcitrant compounds 3. Inhibitory compound 4. Intermediate dead-end products.

C oncentration of Oxidants in AOPs
Most o f the studies show that there is an optimum oxidant dose rate to remove

the m axim um am ount o f pollutants with the lesser oxidant consumption. It has been shown that increasing the oxidant dose in Fenton reaction increases both the extent and the rate o f the biodégradation (Parra et al., 2000). The increase in H 2 O 2 concentration as a strong electron acceptor also had inhibitory effect on the degradability o f herbicides (Parra et al., 2000). The concentration o f an optimal H202/pollutant molar ratio between 10 and 100 (mole H202)/(mole pollutant) had been proposed by other researchers (Parra et al., 2002). It was also reported that the addition o f 32 cm^ H 2 O 2 to 1 dm^ textile w astew ater was equal to 80% decrease in the inhibition effect (Ledakowicz and Gonera, 1999). This was probably due to the auto-oxidation o f H 2 O 2 into O 2 and H 2 O, and recom bination o f 'OH by means o f H2 O 2 according to the following reactions:

+

(2.5)

(2 6)
A:=3.3xl0'

The excess o f H 2 O 2 reacts with 'OH, competing with pollutants and, hence, decreasing the efficiency o f the treatm ent (Ledakowicz and Gonera, 1999).

2.6 T reatm en t Tim e
The inform ation about the toxicity and the biodegradability o f a compound treated by A OPs allows us to determine an optimal treatment time in the AOPs reactor o f the coupled system. It has been observed that the toxicity was increased at the beginning o f the treatm ent o f isoproturon by AOP followed by a sharp decrease in the toxicity (Parra et al., 2002). It has been indicated that the intermediates formed during the beginning o f the treatm ent are more toxic than the initial compounds. Therefore, the time should be the best com promise between the efficiency o f the chemical reactor and its cost. The shorter reaction tim e avoids the high electrical cost o f the reaction. A t longer

photo-treatm ent tim e, the photochemical efficiency is im proved by the unnecessary

23

photo-degradation of pollutants which are biologically degraded. However, the overall efficiency remains almost constant. This implies higher energy consumption without beneficial effect, as about 60% of the total operational cost is electricity (Parra et al., 2002). However, if the reaction time is too short, the intermediates remaining in the system could still have toxicological or biorecalcitrant effects.

Partial oxidation parameters, which correlated with subsequent biodégradation, have been developed (Jochimsen and Jekel, 1997). These parameters set the optimal point for the oxidative treatment. A combination of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations at different times allows differentiating between the oxidation effects of mineralization (total oxidation) and partial oxidation. COD-reduction through partial oxidation is estimated by the following equations (Jochimsen and Jekel, 1997):

^ COD^ DOCo

where CODpanoxi is partial COD reduction, CODo and DOCo represent the initial concentration o f the wastewater, and COD, and DOC, represent the final concentrations. The degree of COD-removal through partial oxidation is given by Equation (2.8), where represents the degree o f COD removal (Jochimsen and Jekel, 1997):

Influence of pH on D egradability
Prim ary param eters such as temperature and pH have significant effects on the

oxidation pathway and the products. It has been found that the best pH for the Fenton reaction is in the range o f 3-5. It is also observed that in Fenton treatment, the optimum p H is based on TOC and COD removal efficiency (Park et al., 2001). It has also been show n that the best pH for the degradation o f nonionic surfactants is 3 (Adams et al., 1997). However, in the next step, precipitation o f oxidized iron Fe(0H)3 has to be

perform ed by adjusting pH to 7-8. It was also observed that the best pH for degrading polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by Fenton reaction was 4 (Nadarajah et al., 2002). The sam e pH range was approved in other studies (Kao and Wu, 2000; Mochidzuki and T akeuchi, 1999; Parra et al., 2000; and Bertanza et al., 2001). It was observed that the pH value w as an im portant param eter for the type o f ozone reaction and oxidation products form ed during ozonation (Kom m uller and Wiesmann, 1999 ). A t pH<8, the direct reaction mechanism took place (addition o f the OH to double bond). At alkaline condition, no elim ination could be achieved as ozone decayed to hydroxyl radicals. Chain reaction might lead to other radicals and consequently dissolved ozone was diminished. A lso at alkaline condition, it was assumed that a great influence o f fluid-fluid ozone mass transfer existed. Therefore, it was expected that molecular ozone was the m ajor oxidant at acidic pH. W hereas, a faster and less selective 'OH oxidation becam e dominant at pH >7

25

as OH accelerated ozone decomposition, but it resulted to a slow and insufficient removal (Alaton and Balciglu, 2002). It was also observed that at pH 3, COD removal was rather slow but 3 times higher in the presence of UV at acidic pH. This might be due to the selectivity o f ozonation for UV absorbance at acidic pH as well as the increased scavenging effect o f the high bicarbonate alkalinity present in pharmaceutical wastewater at pH
8

. Aromatic compounds and unsaturated double bonds were selectively attacked at

alkaline pH. Therefore, UV-sensitive wastewater components were removed at alkaline pH faster than those at acidic pH. Moreover, at high pH the less selectivity of OH radicals were formed as a result of rapid ozone decomposition. It is known that inorganic and organic compounds in pharmaceutical effluent readily scavenge ozone. Hence, more UV-sensitive parent compounds are removed at alkaline pH than those at acidic pH (Alaton and Balciglu, 2002). The final conversion o f organic matter in the wine distillery wastewater, post-treated by ozonation, was defined as follows (Benitez et al., 1999):

where Xj,

So,

and

Sf

are total substrate removal, substrate initial concentration (gCOD/L),
6

and substrate final concentration (g COD/L) measured after

hours o f reaction,

respectively. It was observed that the conversion was increased when the pH was increased to 9 by combination o f
U V

radiation and

H 2O 2

with the ozonation. It can be

concluded that the higher pH and ozonatoion rate lead to an improvement of the oxidation process by
U V

and

H 2O 2.

It was also observed that pH was an important factor

for improving ozonation rate. It was found that when pH o f pre-ozonation changes from 2 to 7 and 9, the percentage of convergence of COD (defined by Equation (2.12)) was increased by 23% according to the following equation:

Percentage of convergence of C O D =

[(C O D o -C O D )/C O D o ]

x 100

(2.12)

where subscript o indicates the value for non-ozonated wastewater.

26

However, an increase in biological fraction o f wastewater is higher at lower pH. By changing pH from 9 to 2, the biological fraction o f wastewater is increased from 25% to 36% (Beltran et al., 1997). These results can be explained by the way ozone attack the com pounds present in water. As the hydroxyl radical concentration is increased by increasing pH (decom position o f ozone into free radicals), more reduction in COD was achieved. During the initial periods o f ozonation, there was no accum ulation o f dissolved ozone in water, which indicated that fast and direct ozone reactions was developed (Beltran et al., 1997). It was also observed that the pH 9 had the best effect on COD/CODo during ozonation. But pH 2 had the least effect on the ratio o f COD at any tim e per initial COD (COD/CODo). Therefore, it is realized that ozonation at pH 2 cannot decrease the concentration o f COD in the wastewater as much as the oznation at pH 9 (Beltran et al., 1997). It was also observed that by removing the carbonates present in m unicipal wastew ater (radical scavengers) and increasing pH from 2 to 9, the percentage convergence o f COD varied from 25.5% to 36% during ozonation. The absence o f radical scavengers led to an increase in total degradation of wastewater (Beltran et al,, 1997). M oreover, it was reported that when tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane were degraded by photocatalytic process in the presence o f carbonate and bicarbonate, the degradation rate o f 1,4-dioxane was decreased, but a small increase in the degradation rate o f tetrahydrofuran w as observed. This increase was believed to be due to the increase in the pH during the reaction (Mehrvar et al., 2001).

2.8

Influence of T em perature on the D egradability of Pollutants
For oil em ulsion wastewater oxidized in batch experiment by ozonation, no

significant tem perature changes have been reported (Beltran et al., 2001). Increasing tem perature increases the reduction o f COD in a process utilizing Fenton's reagent according to Equation (2.13), in which k' is the rate constant [Lmol *min ] (Beltran et al.,

2001 ).

In the ozonation o f the black olive mill, changing the temperature from 10-20°C decreased the concentration of the pollutants by 43%. However, the change in the temperature from 20-30°C caused an increase in the concentration of pollutants by 55%. This could be because when the temperature increases, the kinetic rate constants increase, whereas, the ozone solubility in water decreases. By increasing pH, ozone auto decomposition in water increases, therefore, the ozone concentration in the liquid decreases (Beltran et al., 2000). No significant effect was observed between 20-30°C for the ozonation o f urban wastewater. As a result, it is not convenient to reach temperatures for ozonation above ambient conditions (Beltran et al., 1997).

2.9 M easurem ent Parameters in Biodegradability
Total organic carbon (TOC) measures the amount of organics, which are depleted to CO 2 during chemical oxidation. In the case of combined AOPs and biological processes, little TOC reduction in the chemical step is desired because mineralization is not intended to achieve in chemical process.

COD is a parameter that measures the oxygen demand necessary for the chemical oxidation o f the organics. It can also show the continuous evolution o f pollutants during the treatment processes (Beltran et al., 2000).

XcoD evaluates the removal of organic matter during the AOP as is shown in Equation (2.14) (Benitez et al., 1999a):

COD,,-COD, ^ am COD

where X cod, CODo, and CODf are total COD removal, initial COD, and final COD

[mg/L], respectively.

COD/TOC ratio shows how chemical substrates in the effluent become more oxidized. Lower ratio shows higher degree o f oxidation. Samples with smallest

28

CO D /D O C ratio after application o f AOP have the largest biodegradable fraction (Parra et al.,
20 0 0

).

BOD5 test is an index for the potential extent of a biological oxidation step.

Increase in the values o f BOD/TOC can indicate either reduction in toxicity or im provem ent on the biodegradability of the solution. Fast but not reliable

biodegradability tests are short line BOD or OUR (oxygen uptake rate) in a respirometer. To predict the activated sludge response to prompt changes in pollution composition, it is show n that param eters such as COD and BODs used to evaluate the operating perform ance o f the biological processes are often insufficient (Alaton and Balciglu, 2002). M eanw hile, the toxicity tests are very time consuming and expensive. The aerobic bacteria toxicity test measures the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) o f the toxicant, but it may also identify the inhibition rate o f the aerobic microorganism exposed to the toxicant.

A verage oxidation state (AOS) is another parameter that can be considered as another degradability measurement parameter during the treatment o f the organics in a chem ical reactor. It is defined as (Parra et al., 1999):

AOS =

TOC

(2.15)

where CO D is chemical oxygen demand, and TOC is total organic carbon. AOS takes values betw een +4 for CO 2 (the m ost oxidized state o f C) and - 4 for CH 4 (the most reduced state o f C) when the stabilization of this parameter is reached. The photo-treated solution m ay be considered as biocompatible if only the chemical nature o f intermediates is considered.

F/M (ratio o f food to microorganisms) is also another im portant parameter that helps finding the m ost cost effective treatment. Low F/M implies higher retention time or higher m ixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) concentration, which negatively affects the cost o f the process. Specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) also

29

becomes slower as F/M decreases, but sludge volume index (SVI), which is the ratio o f settled sludge volume (mL/L) to suspended solids (mg/L), increases remarkably. Increasing F/M ratio causes a decrease in MLVSS or hydraulic retention time (HRT), which leads to a decrease in COD and BOD reduction. High F/M ratio promotes a log growth o f biomass that leads to low BOD removal efficiency, poor settling sludge, and high effluent solids concentration (Beltran et al., 1999). F/M ratio must be adjusted to achieve high organic conversion and cost minimization.

Relative changes in the biodegradability of wastewater samples during advanced oxidation time are e x p r e s s t i n îerviKi of biodegradability factor, fg, being calculated as follows (Arsalan and Balciglu, 2001):

where fe, CODo, COD,, BOD;,,, and BOD;,o are biodegradability factor, initial COD, COD at time t, 5-day BOD at time t, and 5-day BOD at time t = 0, respectively.

2.10 M icroorganism's Adaptation
The concentration o f substrates plays a significant role in the biodegradability o f the wastewater (Adams et al., 1997). Sometimes acclimation is necessary to adapt microorganisms to different conditions such as pH and temperature (Beltran et al., 1999). Adaptation can improve the sludge settling characteristic and OUR. The lag time gives an indication o f the time required for the unacclimated biomass to acclimate to the organic substrate. The rate o f degradation provides a relative measure for the ease of biodégradation after the biomass is acclimated. Some of the pollutants are biodegradable under controlled laboratory conditions following acclimation of a suitable microbial group. However, it is not possible to apply specific acclimated microorganism to wastewater during conventional treatment plants. It was observed that COD removal rate for the distillery wastewater by biological oxidation at pH 7 was much higher than that at pH 4 with nonacclimated microorganisms (Bertlan et al., 2001). The microorganisms

30

had low activity at acidic pH, however, after a period o f acclimation, the biological activity started to improve. Regarding the sludge settleability, sludge volume index (SVI) o f the acidic wastewater with acclimated microorganisms was much lower than
100

m g /1

(SVI should be between 50-150 mg/L for a good performance o f the activated sludge treatm ent plant).

2.11 Rem oval of R esidual O xidant
As H 2 O 2 is known to be bactericides and inhibitor in the bacteria activity, it should be rem oved from the pre-treated solution not only to make it suitable for follow ing biological step, but also to stop the oxidation. By choosing an optimal time, H 2 O 2 can be rem oved from the solution completely. Also H 2 O2 less than 200 mg/L m ay be rem oved effectively by addition o f catalase and keeping the solution for
2

hours

w ithout stirring it (Ito et al., 1998). It has been shown that FeC b is able to eliminate the residual H 2 O 2 (Andreozzi et al., 1998).

2.12

O ptim um Situation for Biological P ost-T reatm ent
Theoretical favorable conditions for the bioreactors are in the presence of co

substrates and adapted bacteria, strict pH control, temperature, and aeration for aerobic reactors. N eutralization o f the pre-treated solution is necessary as usually the acidity o f effluent from the chemical reactor is very high. During the biological post-treatment, the pH should be m aintained between 6.5-7.5. After a photo-chemical stage, the effluent may enter into a biological reactor for further treatment if the initial bio-recalcitrant com pounds, the inhibitory intermediates, and the residual oxidant, or H 2 O 2 have been elim inated and the toxicity test has been carried out.

2.13 M athem atical M odels of Chemical and Biological Reactions
A com bined process usually consists o f a chemical reactor followed by a bioreactor. In the chemical reactor depending on the type o f AOPs and the order of the reactions, the com pounds could be degraded to a certain point and then it will enter into the bioreactor. In order to be able to gain the maximum benefit from this integration, the residence time o f the w astew ater in each reactor should be optimized. Moreover, the

31

initial design o f the reactors can be improved by optimization; therefore, the least energy usage and maximum efficiency can be achieved while minimizing the cost. The

objective function is the total cost (defined as cost function) and has a close relation with the sum o f the liquid phase residence time in chemical and biological reactors which was proposed to be held constant to give a design constraint as follows (Ollis and Scott, 1996):

0 c + 0B = ©G = constant

(2.17)

where ©c, ©a, ·inJ ©q are chemical, biological, and overall residence time, respectively.

In addition to the objective function, the equality constraints (equations) and the inequality constraints (inequalities) have to be modeled. However, determining the mentioned expressions needs an accurate analysis of the process and well-known physical principles (mass balances, energy balances, empirical relations and implicit concepts). If all o f the above expressions are available, a suitable optimization technique could be applied for the whole process. By minimizing the total residence time in both reactors, the optimal residence time in chemical reactor (the most cost consuming treatment) can identify the best residence time in the bioreactor. Moreover, the total efficiency can be defined as (Ollis and Scott, 1996):

T|c = ( C ao- C a c - C sc ) / C ao

( 2 .1 8 )

Tla = (C sc - C sb ) / C ao
TIG = ( C ao- C sb - C a c ) / C ao = T |c + T|B

(2 .1 9 )
( 2 .2 0 )

where q is performance efficiency for chemical or global efficiency (qo).
C ao, C a c ,

(q c ),

biological (qg), and overall system

and

C sc

are the inlet concentration o f compound A,

outlet concentration o f compound A, and outlet concentration of intermediate S in the chemical reactor, respectively.
C sb

is the outlet concentration of intermediate S in the

bioreactor. The total efficiency can be considered as an equality constraint. Defining a desired efficiency for the whole system can restrict the objective function to give an

32

answ er within its constraints. The effort o f most o f the researchers working in this area is to develop mathematical models to identify the changes in the concentration of the substrate with respect to tim e for both chemical and biological reactions, which give the retention tim e for a compound in each reactor in order to reach to the desired concentration.

2.14

B ackground (L inear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate)
LAS was first introduced in 1960 as a biodegradable compound to substitute non-

biodegradable com pounds in detergents. It is produced by sulfonation o f linear alkylbenzene with sulfur trioxide. Detergents contain 5-25% LAS, and the length o f its chain ranges from Cio to C 14 (WHO, 1996). The concentration o f LAS in the influent of dom estic w astew ater treatment plants was reported in the range o f 1 mg/L to 5 mg/L (K aiser et al., 1997). It has also been reported that the influent and effluent concentrations o f LAS in the activated sludge process from ten U.S. domestic wastewater treatment plants range from 3.0-7.7 mg/L and 0.003-0.086 mg/L, respectively (Trehy et al., 1995). The alkyl chain lengths usually range from Cio to C 14 in the United States, and Cio to C 13 in Europe (Huang et al., 2000). As it was reported that higher concentration o f LAS does not respond to biological treatments, many investigators have tried degrading LAS using chem ical processes. Table 2.3 shows some o f the works carried on chemical treatment o f LAS.

The interm ediates produced by wet air oxidation of LAS were known as volatile fatty acids (VFA), sulfophenyi(di) aldehyde (SP(d)A), and sulfophenyl(di) carboxylate (SP(d)C). It has also been reported that SP(d)Cs are refractory to biodégradation (Patterson et al., 2002). Photocatalytic degradation o f LAS with TiOz was documented to produce sodium benzene sulfonate (BS) and sodium dodecylsulfate (DS) (Venhuis and M ehrvar, 2004).

2.15 E nvironm ental Concerns and B iodegradability of LAS
LAS is the m ajor anthropogenic source o f organic compounds in prim ary sludge in m unicipal w astew ater treatm ent plants, as it can be adsorbed onto suspended solids

33

ranging from 30 to 70% (Bema et al., 1989) and, hence, escaping aerobic treatment. It has also been identified in surface water supplies in the concentration o f lower than pg/L (Tabor and Bzu-ber, 1996) and in drinking water in the range of 0.001-0.008 mg/L in different countries (WHO, 1996). It is also able to enhance the solubility of compounds in water, which are otherwise insoluble in other matrices; hence, it can reduce the resistance to mass transfer (Vazquez et al., 2000).

High mobility of LAS due to its high water solubility and its polarity makes it to be a hazardous contaminant in ground and surface water supplies (Reemtsma, 1996). LAS can be degraded in activated sludge system by consortia of aerobic microorganisms (Van Ginkel, 1996) up to 99.5% and its intermediates up to 99.1% (Trehy et al., 1996). On the other hand, it has been reported that the intermediates produced by biological treatments zae 10-100 times less toxic than the parent compounds (WHO, 1996). The solid residence time (SRT) of mixed culture is very important to preserve adequate surfactants, degrading microorganism in the wastewater treatment plant (Van Ginkel, 1996). Moreover, it was found that in the activated sludge procedure the effluent concentration o f LAS was a function of influent concentration when the hydraulic residence time (HRT) was less that 10 h (Kaiser et al., 1997). Some residue o f LAS and its intermediates can enter the receiving water by the effluent if the HRT is not chosen properly. Furthermore, some of the countries discharge their effluents either directly or indirectly due to the malfunctioning of the treatment facilities into rivers. Another way that LAS can enter the environment is by using the sludge resulted from wastewater treatment plants on the agricultural lands. As a result, the aquatic and terrestrial organisms are exposed to surfactants.

LAS has shown toxic effects on the Nitrosomonas and Nitrosopria strains (Brandt et al., 2001). The inhibitory effect was observed to be more on growth rate and viability than that on metabolic activity. LAS has shown inhibitory effect on anaerobic biological treatment (Morales et al., 2001, and Gavala and Ahring, 2002). It is also reported that methanogenic and acidogenic microbiotes are sensitive to LAS although after a period o f adaptation, there could be a decrease of the inhibitory effect of LAS on

them (Morales et al., 2001). As the primary sludge stabilizes anaerobically and LAS is not biodegradable by anaerobic treatment, this sludge has environmental effect due to LAS potential for acute toxicity (Hofer et al., 1995, and Lewis, 1991).

It has been reported that LAS in the concentrations of 1-3-10 mg/L is biodegradable under aerobic activated sludge treatment (Rittmann et al.,
2001

), and its

degradation follows Monod's equation over the ranges of 0.1-20 mg/L (Rittmann et al., 2001). Moreover, it has been reported that the fate of LAS can follow first order kinetics for the similar ranges of concentrations (Huang et al., 2000, and Zhang et al., 1999). Also, the effect of biodégradation kinetics should be separated from the sorption kinetics (Rittmann et al., 2001). However, the growth rate o f mixed culture of microorganisms can be inhibited at the concentration of 95 mg/L (WHO, 1996). The minimum concentration o f LAS which makes it toxic is not known (Patterson et al., 2002). Acute toxicity LC50 for different species differs from one to another, as saline water species are more sensitive to LAS than freshwater (WHO, 1996).

LAS biodégradation follows two regimes: 1) primary degradation, which oxidizes alkyl chain resulting sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates, and 2 ) ultimate biodégradation, which cleavage the phenyl ring and removing sulfonate group. Finally it is converted into CO 2 , H 2 O, inorganic salts, and biomass. The bacteria that are capable of breaking the ring are not common (Patterson et al., 2002).

It was also investigated that ultimate biodégradation of LAS cannot be achieved at any concentration. Although the inhibitory effect of LAS increases as the concentration of LAS increases and inhibits primary degradation. It suggests that LAS is recalcitrant at very high concentration (3000 mg/dm^) (Patterson et al., 2002). This can be due to the chemical toxicity and the destruction of cell membrane caused by high concentration of LAS (Patterson et al., 2002). It has been reported that ultimate biodégradation is possible under suitable condition and limiting the concentration o f LAS to that found in environment (WHO, 1996).

36

Hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts o f LAS can react with polar and apolar structures such as proteins and peptides. This binding can modify the structure and charge o f proteins and peptides; furthermore, it can modify their biological function (Cserhati et al., 2002). Therefore, LAS can accumulate in living organisms, as it can inhibit in the hepatic liposom es o f rat and inhibit the activity o f some o f the enzymes (Cserhati et al.,

2002 ).

LAS can also damage hum an skin and irritate eyes (WHO, 1996). It has been established that the longer the alkylbenzene chain is, the more severe the skin irritancy potential can be (Cserhati et al., 2002). LAS and its intermediates resulting from biological treatm ents are not estrogenic (Navas et al., 1999).

2.16

C oncluding R em arks
F or the rem oval o f recalcitrant organics, biological processes (which are

econom ically beneficial) cannot be chosen, but a variety o f non-biological processes exist w hich can be divided into oxidative and reductive technologies. Among all o f them, photochem ical degradation processes, or advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), have becom e increasingly popular in recent years as alternative or complementary treatment. The prim ary use o f AOPs is to destroy organic pollutants in water by oxidation. H ow ever, depending on the targeted effluent quality, extended treatment duration may im pose unaffordable high operating costs due to high energy and chemical oxidation requirem ents o f AOPs. A recently proposed technique to cope with the environmental regulations and also environmentally safer and economically more attractive strategy is biodegradability enhancem ent o f raw and biological pretreated industrial effluents by applying chemical oxidative pretreatment, in which two or three consecutive chemical and biochem ical processes steps are involved. Moreover, as the complete destruction o f w astew ater pollutants can be hardly achieved by a single treatment method, combination o f biological and chemical treatment is often the way to optimize the overall process. D epending on w ater quality, final requirement and economical aspects, some processes are b etter suited than others for each case. The strategy o f coupling chemical and

37

biological reactors is not necessarily a unique solution. The practical applications of these integrated processes require a detailed study on kinetic modeling and economic aspects. Chemical, biological, and kinetic studies should be made to ensure that the pre-treatment or the post-treatment increase the biocompatibility of wastewater. A balance between added cost of AOPs and desired quality of treated wastewater is highly recommended to make sure that the A O ? pre-treatment induces a beneficial effect on the bio-compatibility o f the treated wastewater (or the biological pre-treatment has beneficial effect on the following chemical step).

under biological degradation, especially when the concentration of LAS is high (Zhang et al, 1998). Moreover, LAS can be toxic to microorganisms. Therefore, advanced oxidation processes can be a good choice to chemically degrade LAS. However, as AOP is a relatively expensive method, combination of AOP and biological technique could be a better option. Furthermore, as ultimate biodégradation o f LAS involves breakage o f

phenyl ring, the bacteria that are capable of breaking the ring are not common. Therefore, adaptation of bacteria to LAS can increase the rate of biodégradation.

M aterials
The following materials were used in chemical and biological experiments. 'ft f t i v . . ;

3.1.1

L in ear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS)
LAS is the sodium salt o f dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, a mixture o f phenyl-

substituted alkyl chain (Figure 3.1). Sodium salt o f dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid was purchased from Aldrich Company to study the degradation characteristics o f LAS. The alkyl chain contains 12 carbons with the molecular weight o f 348.48. The scanning o f U V -spectrophotom eter showed that the maximum absorbance for this compound is at 268 nm (Figure 3.2).

A ctivated sludge was collected from North Toronto sewage treatment plant,

located in the D on Valley. The concentration o f sludge (dry weight) was 4.8 g/L and the am ount o f LAS initially present in the sludge o f treatment plant was 4 mg/L.

3.1.4 Catalase
H2 O2 concentration less than 200 mg/L may be removed effectively by addition o f a catalase (2.5 units/mL) by keeping the solution for 2 hours without stirring (Ito et al., 1998). Each molecule o f catalase is a tetramer of four polypeptide chains. Each chain is composed o f more than 500 amino acids. Located within this tetramer are four porphyrin heme groups that are very much like the familiar hemoglobins, cytochromes, chlorophylls and nitrogen-fixing enzymes in legumes. The heme group is responsible for catalase's enzymatic activity. The mechanism of removal is catalytic decomposition o f H 2 O 2 into oxygen and water. The chemistry o f catalase catalysis has not been precisely solved yet. But the following has been proposed. The catalytic process is thought to occur in two stages (http://biology.kenyon.edu/BMB/Chime/catalase, 2004)

H 2 O 2 + Fe(III)-E ^

H2 O + 0 = Fe(IV)-E ( 1)

(3.2)

where Fe-E represents the iron center of the heme attached to the rest of the enzyme (E) (Figure 3.3). Heme consists of a protoporphyrin ring and a central iron (Fe) atom. A protoporphyrin ring is made up of four pyrrole rings linked by methane bridges. Four methyl, two vinyls, and two propionate side chains are attached (http://crystal.uah.edu, 2000 ).

This enzyme is available in two forms: 1) bovine liver 2) AspergiUis niger. The amount o f enzyme added depends on its activity and can be found on its label. However, the impact of the enzyme on the sample should be known. The catalase which was used in this experiment was bovine liver type, purchased from SIGMA Company. Molecular weight o f catalase is 250,000, and it is stable for 6-12 months when stored at 5°C. It was mentioned on the package that one unit of this catalase has the ability o f decomposing

3.1.5 Chemicals for Analysis of LAS
Chloroform (CHCI3 . 99.98%) was purchased from EM Science (affiliated with Merck, Germany) and used as received. Methylene blue reagent was purchased from Aldrich. To make 100 mg of methylene blue, it was dissolved in 100 mL o f distilled water (stock solution). Thirty mL of the stock solution was transferred to 1000 mL flask and 500 mL o f water, 41 mL of 6 N H2 SO4 , and 50g Na H 2 PO 4 .H2 O were added. The solution was diluted to 1000 mL by distilled water after dissolving thoroughly.

Chlorine check kit consisted o f N ,N-diethyl-p -phenylenediam ine (DPD) tablets (VW R) and a colorim etric kit. The detection range was between 0.2-2 and 2-10 mg/L free chlorine. To perform the experiment the vial should be filled with water up to the marked point, which would be 2 mL, and one tablet should be added to the water. A fter crushing the tablet and m ixing it thoroughly, the color produced in the vial should be compared to the colors on the kit. Each color on the kit was corresponding to a certain concentration.

45

By matching to the produced color in the vial to the appropriate color, the concentration of the free chlorine in the water was found in terms of mg/L of free chlorine.

Equipment and Experimental Methods
This section has been divided into two parts, photolytic and biological processes.

Experimental set-up, analytical techniques, and equipment required for each photolytic and biological treatment are described separately.

PHOTOLYTIC PROCESSES 3.2.1 Experimental Set-Up (Photoreactor)
The experiments were performed in a 76.6 L cylindrical batch photoreactor, with the outside diameter o f 32 cm and nominal length o f 102 cm (Figure 3.4). Six immersed low pressure mercury UV lamps, with the maximum wavelength o f 253.7 nm and 40 W each, were symmetrically placed inside the photoreactor. The photoreactor was equipped with 3 mixers, placed on the main axis o f the cylindrical photoreactor. The speed of these mixers could be adjusted as desired. The total volume of the feed tank was 210 L, and the minimum volume o f water in the tank for operation should be 94 L. A centrifugal pump recirculated the solution into the reactor. The flow rate of the feed was adjustable in gallons per minute (GPM) or liters per minute (LPM). The whole system was equipped with a water bath (Neslab, RTE series) to keep the temperature constant at 20 ± 0.01°C during the experiment. The volume of water in the water bath was kept between 10-12 L. Prior to start the each experiment, 10 g of LAS was added to the 100 L water inside the feed tank. The whole system was turned on, including the water bath and the pump for the period o f maximum 1 h, the UV lamps were all off with the feed tank lid closed. After that period which was called stabilization period, the
6

UV lamps were turned on

simultaneously. Furthermore, the temperature of the reactor was kept constant at 20°C using the water bath during all the experiment, therefore, the effect of increasing the temperature due to the UV lamps have been eliminated.

Three samples were taken every hour from the effluent of the reactor (inlet to the feed tank), and analyzed immediately. The initial concentration of LAS was 100 mg/L. After taking the last sample, the pump was shut down and the lamps were turned off. The water bath was also turned off. The reactor was drained into the feed tank by opening its side valve. After collecting all of the solution inside the feed tank, the tank was drained by pumping the water out. The whole system was cleaned and made ready for the next run.

3.2.2 pH M easurement
pH measurements and its control are important in water treatment systems. As in biological treatment, the life of microorganisms highly depends on a certain range of pH, in chemical treatment, the control of pH is also crucial as changing pH can have a significant effect on the reaction. Moreover, in advance oxidation processes

measurements o f pH can show that the reaction is moving toward production of acid, which is the expected path.

pH measurements are mainly done by potentiometric measurement using a glass indicator electrode and a reference electrode. The pH meter used in these experiments was model 230 A^ from Thermo Orion, in which the indicator and reference electrodes were combined into one. The buffers of pH = 4 and pH = 7 were used to calibrate the meter before pH was measured. Those two buffers were chosen in the expected sample range. The calibration was done each day by determining the slope of the electrode. Also calibration can determine if the electrode was working properly.

3.2.3

UV Spectrophotometer
A UV spectrophotometer was used for quantification of color in terms of The spectrophotometer used was Ultrospec 1100 pro UV/Vis

absorbance.

Spectrophotometer (Biochrom Ltd.), with the ability to measure the absorbance, percent Transmission, and concentration values. It can measure absorbance of samples, based on the amount of light that has passed through a sample relative to a blank. While percent transmission mode measures the amount of light that has passed through a sample relative to a blank, it displays the result as a percentage. Concentration mode is used

48

w hen a conversion factor is known, and is required to convert the absorbance m easurem ent for a sample at a specific wavelength into a concentration. The wavelength range w as within 200-900 nm with the accuracy o f ± 2 nm.

The light sources are tungsten halogen and deuterium arc (Ultrospec 1100 pro). The instrum ent has a one cell compartment. The detector was from single solid state silicon photodiode. The cell used for the experiments was a standard rectangular quartz cell (optical glass). The cell's volume was 3 mL, and has a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cover.

3.2.4
^

P rep aratio n of the Initial Solution for Photolytic Experim ents
Ten g o f the dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (flaked sodium salt solid), was added to

lOO^L o f tap w ater inside the feed tank. Therefore, the concentration o f LAS inside the system would be 100 mg/L. The solution was circulated for one hour w ith lights off in order to make the solution homogeneous throughout the system.

3.2.5

M easurem ents of L inear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate
The detection method o f LAS was based on the transfer o f m ethylene blue active

substance (MBAS), which is a cationic dye, from an aqueous solution into an immiscible phase containing anionic surfactant. This transfer is possible by ion pair formation o f anionic surfactant and methylene blue. Excess methylene blue was extracted into chloroform and the blue color in the chloroform would be read at 652 nm by UV Spectrophotom eter (Standard Methods, 1998). The interference result from all other m ethylene blue active substances present in the solution. M oreover, cationic surfactants can have a negative effect on the determination as they can compete with methylene blue in the form ation o f the pairs. Organic sulfonates, sulfates, carboxylates, and phenols can also have positive interference, although their recovery is almost com plete by aqueous backw ash o f the extracted color in chloroform, therefore, the concentration o f LAS has b een reported here as mg/L M BAS due to the positive error that was explained before. T he reagents used in this experim ent were those explained in Section 3.1.5.

49

The samples taken periodically from the effluent o f the reactor (inlet to the feed tank) were diluted, so that the measured concentration would be below 2 mg/L. Two mL o f samples were diluted to 100 mL. Two mL o f the diluted samples were taken; phenolphthalein indicator solution was added drop wise to each sample. The samples were make alkaline by drop-wise addition of NaOH IN, and the pink color was removed by adding drop wise of H2 SO4 IN. One mL of chloroform and 2.5 mL of methylene blue were added to each sample and shaken vigorously for 30 s. The aqueous phase was taken to another tube and the extraction procedure was repeated for 3 times. All of the CHCI3 extracts were combined and 5 mL of wash solution were added to them and shaken vigorously for 30 S. The wash solubon .vas extracted twice by CHCI3 ,1 mL each time, and the extracts were diluted with CHCI3 to 10 mL. The absorbance at 652 nm were determined against a blank of CHCI3 using the spectrophotometer (Section 3.2.3). Standard curve was prepared by determining the absorbance of known concentrations of standard solutions and the absorbance of each sample was converted into concentration using this curve and dilution factor. Figure 3.5 illustrates the calibration curve for LAS by the mentioned method.

3.2.6

M easurement of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
COD was used to measure the amount of oxygen require to oxidize the organics

in a solution by a powerful chemical oxidant. This oxidation is usually done by potassium dichromate in acidic solution.

The drawbacks o f this method are as follows (Eckenfelder, 2000): 1. COD cannot oxidize aromatics such as benzene and volatile straight-chain aliphatic compounds; therefore, it is not measured in the COD tests. Therefore, it is lower than theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD). 2. Some reduced substances, such as sulfides, sulfites, and ferrous iron, would also be oxidized and measured as COD.

50

CO D can be determined by different methods, however, as the predicted COD for the sam ples was above 50 mg/L and there was not any suspended solid present in the sam ple, the closed refluxed method was chosen as it is more economical over this range o f concentration (Standard Method, 1998). This method is based on the oxidation o f organics by a m ixture o f K 2 Cr2 0 7 and sulfuric acid. Potassium dichromate is a strong oxidizing agent under acidic conditions. (Acidity is usually achieved by the addition o f sulfuric acid.) The reaction o f potassium dichromate with organic compounds is given by: CnHaObNc + dCr 2 0 7 + ( 8 d + c)H ^ ^ n C 0 2 + (a+8d-3c)/2 H 2 O + cNH 4 ^ + 2dCr^'" (3.3)

w here d = 2n/3 + a/ 6 - b/3 - c/2. M ost commonly, a 0.25 N solution o f potassium dichrom ate is used for COD determination, although for samples with COD below 50 m g/L, a low er concentration o f potassium dichromate is preferred. In the process o f oxidizing the organic substances found in the water sample, potassium dichromate is reduced, form ing Cr^"^. The amount o f Cr^"^ is determined after oxidization is complete, and is used as an indirect measure o f the organic contents o f the water sample. In the colorim etric method (closed reflux), oxygen consumption is measured against standards at 600 nm with spectrophotometer. The reagents were prepared in a vials purchased from Bioscience, Inc., in the range o f 20-900 mg/L. Each vial contained sulfhric acid, potassium dichromate, silver sulfate (catalyst), mercuric sulfate (reduce the effect o f halides), and sulfamic acid. Standard potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) was crushed and then dried to constant weight at I20°C. 425 mg o f KHP was dissolved in distilled w ater and diluted to 1000 mg/L. This solution had a theoretical COD o f 500 m g/L O 2 . D ifferent concentrations o f this solution were prepared as reference to prepare calibration curve.

T he COD reactor (Bioscience, Inc.) should be preheated to 150 ± 2°C prior to preparing the vials. The vials with the volume o f approximately 10 mL were uncapped carefully and

3.2.9 F ree C hlorine Experim ent
It has been reported that free chlorine could react as an oxidant under UV light, and hence, increase the rate o f reaction (Zhou and Smith, 2001). Furthermore, the presence o f free chlorine could interfere with the determination o f a specific compound. For the BO D test, elim ination o f free chlorine is necessary. Also for determination o f H 2 O2 , in som e m ethods, free chlorine works as interference. To eliminate the free chlorine present in tap water, chlorine checkit consisted o f DPD (N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine) tablets, w ere used for the following reasons: 1. To determ ine the initial concentration o f free chlorine in the tap water, that was used to prepare the solution. 2. To determ ine the effect o f elimination o f free chlorine.

54

The DPD method is based on the reaction o f the free chlorine with DPD indicator, which produces a red color instantly. Therefore, it was necessary to remove the free chlorine presence in the tap water before adding LAS to eliminate any increase in the degradation o f LAS due to free chlorine. The concentration o f free chlorine in the tap w ater during different runs was examined and it was observed that it varies between 0 - 1 . 5 mg/L. Therefore, prior the each run, the feed tank was filled with water and let the free chlorine evaporate during the night by keeping the feed tank lid open. It was observed that this range o f concentration of free chlorine could be eliminated by this method successfully. The experiments were conducted at least three times and the error bars w hich are the standard divisions o f the results at each time were calculated.

3.2.10 D ark Reaction Experim ent
To quantify the loss o f LAS through adsorption, dark reaction experiments were conducted. The changes in the initial concentration o f LAS were monitored after 1 h. of stabilization period. For the period o f
6

h, the UV lamps were all off with the feed tank

lid closed. Three samples were taken every hour from the effluent o f the reactor (inlet to the feed tank). In order to minimize the environmental effects on the degradation o f LAS, the sam ples were analyzed immediately.

3.2.11

Photoreaction of LAS by UV-254
In this experiment, all conditions were kept the same as to those o f the dark UV lamps were turned on simultaneously after the stabilization

reaction except that the

period. Furtherm ore, the temperature o f the reactor was kept constant at 20°C using the w ater bath during all the experiment, therefore, the effect o f increasing the temperature due to the UV lamps have been eliminated. Three samples were taken every hour and analyzed immediately. The initial concentration o f LAS was 100 mg/L.

3.2.12 M ixing Speed Experim ent
In order to determine the effect o f mixing speed on the photolytic degradation rate o f LA S, different experiments were conducted at different mixing speeds, with constant flow rates. There are different numbers on the mixer ranging from 0-10, and each number

55

is associated with different speed. Table 4.1 shows the mixing speed associated with each number. The rotational speed of each number was measured by Tachometer (DT-105 A, Electromatic Equipment Co., Inc.).

BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES

3.2.13 Experimental Set-Up (Sequential Batch Reactor)
Sequential batch reactor (SBR) is a suspended growth, mixed- culture reactor. However, it can be categorized as activated sludge treatment (Figure 3.7). Common activated sludge systems are spaei oriented, however, SBR is time oriented. It is a periodic process which consist of tanks working on a fill and draw basis. The cycles in each tank are divided into the following periods: . · · · Fill, react, settle, draw, and idle.

During the fill period, the wastewater is added to the tank which contains biomass. Biomass is expressed in term of volatile mixed liquor suspended solids which exist in the tank from the previous cycles. Fill period could be static fill (no mixing and no aeration), mixed fill (mixing and no aeration), and aerated fill (mixing and aeration). Type of filling period depends on the characteristic of wastewater. However the wastewater should be completely mixed in the system before the react period. In the react period, the reactions which have started in the fill period are completed. Aeration is an essential operation in this period. Also the system should have sufficient mixing to increase mass transfer. The react period usually takes 35% of the whole cycle's time. The next period is settlement. The entire tank works as clarifier and separates sludge from the liquor. After the

settlement period, effluent is ready to be withdrawn. During this period there should not be any agitation in the system. After drawing, the tank is ready for the new influent. It can be left idle between draw and fill period. This period is required if wasting sludge is necessary.

56

The reactor used in the experiments had a 7 L volume and the aeration was done by air diffuser as shown in Figure 3.7.

3.2.14

In cu b ato r
The incubator was used to provide a constant temperature during the period o f

biological reaction. Temperature is a crucial factor on microorganism. It was set at 20°C as it w as the optim um tem perature for the BOD tests. M oreover, as it could be set to have horizontal plane rotary m otion in a shake flask experiments.

circular orbit simultaneously, it was used in the

The incubator used was C-25KC classic refrigerated incubator shaker (New Brunsw ick Scientific Co., Inc.). The speed o f this model could be set between 40-400 rpm (w ith the accuracy o f ±2 rpm) and the accuracy for the temperature was ±0.25°C.

3.2.15

Dissolved Oxygen M eter
The oxygen is also an important factor on the life and growth o f aerobic

m icroorganism . Therefore, it has to be controlled to avoid the death o f aerobic m icroorganism . M ainly the saturated concentration o f oxygen in the aerated water at 20°C can be between 8-10. As a result, the decrease o f oxygen in that water could

suggest that it is being used by the microorganisms (provided that there is no other way for the w ater to loss its dissolved oxygen content).

The dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured by YSl 58 dissolved oxygen meter. It has a probe consists o f an electrode (compacting cathode and anode in a one bar) and an electrolyte (KCl). They are separated from the outer liquid by a membrane. The anode and cathode are made o f silver and gold, respectively. The reduction o f oxygen in cathode is proportional to concentration o f dissolved oxygen. If the temperature changes, the dissolved oxygen will vary due to the change in the solubility o f oxygen at different tem perature. This m eter should be calibrated prior to each use.

The probe should be placed in moist air and the meter should be adjusted corresponding to the calibration value for the local altitude. Meter accuracy is about ±0.1 mg/L, and the temperature sensor accuracy is +0.2°C.

To measure the DO when there is no movement in the system; a clean magnetic stirring bar should be placed in each container to mix it. The magnetic should not be removed until the end of the DO reading.

3.2.16 Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
BOD depends on the biodegradability o f the waste and can identify the amount of oxygen that is necessary to oxidize a waste biologically into CO 2 and water during a specific period of incubation. This parameter can measure the biodegradable organic carbon that is present in the waste along with oxidizable nitrogen. The low value of BOD either shows very clean water or a toxic wastewater which can inhibit microorganisms from growth. The most popular BOD test is 5-day BOD, which measures the amount of oxygen used in 5 days to stabilize the organics in wastewater incubating at 20°C. However, measuring the oxygen required to oxidize the organic matter completely is also possible. This type of BOD is referred to as ultimate BOD (UBOD). It is important to know that BOD is the combination of two parameters, the oxygen used for synthesis of new cells and endogenous respiration. BOD can also be expressed mathematically by assuming a first order reaction rate as follows (Metcalf and Eddy, 2002):

dt

(3.4)

where 1, k , and t are the amount o f oxygen demand at time t, reaction rate constant, and reaction duration, respectively. Equation (3.4) can be simplified as follows:

/=

(3.5)

60

w here lo is the oxygen required to oxidize the biodegradable organics totally or UBOD. M oreover, to find the am ount o f BOD at any time, the following equation can be defined:

BO D ,=l,,-l

(3.6)

w here BOD, is the amount o f BOD at time t. Substituting Equation (3.5) into Equation (3.6), BOD at time t can be calculated directly.

BOD, = / ,, ( l - e - * ')

(3.7)

The method consists o f providing nutrient and oxygen for the microorganisms to oxidize a specific volum e o f organic wastes in a sealed 300 ml bottles placing in an incubator at 20°C for 5 days. The BOD 5 is calculated by the difference in the initial dissolved oxygen (DO) and the DO after 5 days. However, if the sample has been diluted, the dilution factor should be taken into account.

Dilution water was prepared by adding 1 mL o f each nutrient (Section 3.1.6) to one liter o f distilled w ater and aerating the water for at least h alf an hour. The seed solution (Section 3.1.8) was prepared by adding one capsule o f polyseed to 500 mL o f dilution water. The solution was aerated for one hour. This solution was then allowed to settle for 5-15 minute prior to use. Five mL o f seed solution was added to each 300 mL BO D bottles (V W R Science). The mixture was diluted with dilution water. The bottles w ere w ater sealed and placed in dark incubator at 20"C to prevent oxygen transfer. The volum e o f the waste added to each bottle can be estimated according to Table 3.1. The initial DO (dissolved oxygen) and DO after 5 days were measured using an YSI 58 dissolved oxygen meter (3.2.8). A blank solution was prepared by diluting 5 ml o f seed solution in the BOD bottle w ith dilution w ater and again its initial DO and DO after 5 days w ere measured. The BO D 5 was calculated according to the following equation:

bod

= *

-F

--

(3 .8 )

61

where DOsi, D 0 s2 , DObi, D 0 b2 , f, and P are initial DO of sample, DO o f sample after 5 days, initial DO o f blank, DO of blank after 5 days, ratio of seed in diluted sample to seed in seed control, and volumetric fraction of sample used, respectively. P can also be defined as the ratio of volume of sample added to the bottles, to 300 mL (volume of bottles). As BOD test can be influenced by presence of toxicants, improper use of

seeding, and error in analytical techniques, it was checked periodically by a standard check solution (3.1.7). Therefore, for a 2% dilution o f such a solution, the BOD 5 would be 198 mg/L with a standard deviation of 30.5 mg/L (Standard Methods, 1998). After each use, the bottles should be cleaned by detergent and dilute HCl (3N) to remove any surface film, and covered with paper to prevent collecting dust.

3.2.17 Ultimate Biological Oxygen Demand (UBOD)
Ultimate Biological Oxygen Demand test is almost the same as BOD 5 test explained before, but with a few different steps. In this method, the bottles should be kept in incubator under the above mentioned conditions for an extended period o f time depending on the type o f wastewater. The dissolved oxygen should be measured initially and frequently to ensure that the DO is not low and anaerobic condition has not been occurred. If the concentration of dissolved oxygen reaches around 2 mg/L, the sample should be aerated again.

Dissolved oxygen should be measured at intervals of 2 to 5 days over a period of 30 to 60 days. When DO falls around 2 mg/L a small amount o f sample should be poured into a beaker and reaerated with air. The new DO should also be recorded. If dilution water blank is used, it should follow the same procedure and the total DO consumed must be subtract from the blank's DO uptake. Ultimate BOD can be estimated by using Equation (3.7), which can also be expressed in the form of:

BOD,=UBOD{\-e~^)

3.2.18

Hydrogen Peroxide Measurement
The residual H 2 O2 can interfere with COD measurements due to its reaction with

dichromate. Therefore, this reaction could increase the measured COD, as it was observed that I mg/L of residual H2 O 2 could generate 0.26 mg/L COD (Lin et al., 1998). Moreover, H2 O2 is known to be bactericides and inhibitor in the bacteria activity. Therefore residual H2 O 2 can inhibit the bacterial growth in the BOD tests, and hence, underestimate actual BOD. Removal of residual H2 O2 is s,_%:cifically important for the biological treatment step that is fed by pre-treated UV/H 2 O2 process. The concentration of H 2 O2 was measured by two methods: 1. DMP method (2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) 2. DPD method (N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine) The detection limit for DMP method was 3.4-170 mg/L and for DPD method was 0.1-40 mg/L.

DPD method has DPD reagent tablets, which are commercially available with a colorimetric kit. It was used when lower concentration of H 2 O2 was expected. On the other hand, DMP method was used when precise determination was desirable and the H 2 O 2 concentration was not expected to be very low. The DMP procedure is based on the reduction o f copper(II) with H 2 O2 and production of a stable bright yellow complex of Cu(DMP) 2 ^ with maximal absorbance at 454 nm (Kosaka et al., 1998). The test procedures are as follows: One mL o f each o f the reagent solutions describe in Section 3.1.9 were added to a 10 mL volumetric flask and mixed well. Three mL of sample was added to the flask and diluted with distilled water to 10 mL. After mixing, the absorbance of the sample was measured at 454 nm. Blank solution was prepared in the same way but with distilled water instead o f sample. To make a calibration curve, different standards with different concentrations o f H 2 O 2 were prepared and their absorbance was measured at 454 nm. Therefore, the

64

concentration o f the samples could be read directly from the calibration curve (Figure 3.8).

M ixed L iq u o r Suspended Solids (MLSS)
M ixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) is a quantitative way to measure the

concentration o f solids in sludge. It is done by filtering a known volum e o f sludge using W hatm ann glass fiber filter with the pore diameter o f 1.58 m. The solids remain on the filter should be dried at 150°C and reported in terms o f mg/L o f dried solids. If this filter is burned in oven at 550°C, what is obtained, is mixed liquor fixed suspended solids, and w hat is burned o ff is mixed liquor volatile suspended .<oIids (MLVSS). Therefore, the m ass o f organics in the sludge could be calculated. Generally, MLVSS is used as the biom ass in the activated sludge.

Each flask was prepared in duplicates. Follow ing addition o f all materials, the solution inside the flasks was stirred vigorously for one m inute prior to take the first sample. Then, the flasks were incubated in the shaker incubator (150 rpm) and at a controlled temperature o f 20°C. During the sampling, the flask w as m ixed vigorously with a magnetic stirrer.

The objective o f this experiment was to adapt the biomass to a certain concentration o f LAS. The effect o f acclimation on the biodegradability o f LAS was studied. To increase the rate o f biomass growth during the acclimation period, LAS was diluted with sodium acetate. This dilution was based on the initial characteristic o f LAS. The BO D 5 o f LAS at that concentration should be measured. Therefore, the dilution should be in a way to provide the same BOD 5 . The experiment was started by addition o f sodium acetate with a BO D 5 equal to the BOD 5 of that concentration o f LAS to the reactor. M oreover, activated sludge (from North Toronto Treatment Plant) and nutrient w ith the ratio o f BOD;N;P equal to 100:5:1 were fed to the reactor. The nutrient medium w as com posed o f K H 2 PO 4 , K 2 HPO 4 , NaHP 0 4 . 7 H 2 O, NH 4 CI, M gS 0 4 , FeCla, and CaCb (Standard M ethods, 1998). Thirty one mL phosphate buffer and 1.4 mL from each of the M gS 0 4 , FeCl], and C aC b was added to the SBR. The nutrients were added to the system weekly. A ir was provided by air diffuser, and the system was mixed at the speed of 300 rpm . The concentration o f LAS in the substrate was gradually increased from 0 to 10 m g/L during 23 days; m eanwhile, the concentration o f sodium acetate was decreased to m aintain the pervious BO D 5 . The addition o f new substrate was provided when the changes in the concentration o f LAS in the reactor became steady state, in other words the concentration o f LAS became zero. The duration o f each phase was as follows: Fill phase
6

h with aeration, react phase 8.4 h with mixing and aeration, settle phase 4.8 h

w ith no aeration or m ixing, draw phase 3.6 h with no aeration or mixing, and idle phase 1.2 h w ith only aeration. The duration o f each cycle was 24 h. the sample was taken at the end o f the settled phase and if the concentration o f LAS was zero, new feed (according to the explanation m entioned above) was introduced to the system. After the last feed (10 m g/L LA S) was given to the system and was consumed by the microorganisms in the activated sludge, the whole liquor was drained at the end of settled phase but the sludge w as kept inside the reactor. The reactor was filled with the fresh sample (could be either untreated LAS or LAS with photolytic pre-treatment). Nutrients as described before were added to the system. The duration o f each phase was the same as before and the percentage o f rem oval o f LAS at the end o f each phase was monitored.

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this chapter, the results obtained from photochemical and biological degradation of linear alkylbeneze sulfonate (LAS) using a pilot plant photoreactor and a sequential batch reactor are presented and discussed. LAS at the concentration of 100 mg/L was degraded by UV-254 and combination of UV and H2 O2 to determine which one has the ability to degrade LAS at a faster rate. Moreover, different experiments were carried out
to

determine the best working condition for the pilot plant photoreactor.

Different experiments on biological treatment of LAS were conducted under aerobic conditions. In conclusion, combination of chemical and biological treatment was examined.

4.1 Photolytic Treatment of LAS

4.1.1

Free Chlorine
The degradation o f LAS in the presence and absences of free chlorine was

compared in the photolytic reactor (Figure 4.1). Two conditions were examined, with and without mixing in the system. It was observed that: 1. Mixing increased the degradation rate of LAS with free chlorine by 7%, and without free chlorine by
1 0 %,

compared to non-mixing system.

2. The degradation of LAS had an increase using tap water containing free chlorine in the system by 5% with mixing, and 8 % without mixing. Therefore, it was concluded that free chlorine could react as an oxidant under UV light, and increase the reaction rate. Figure 4.2 compares the initial rate for those four different cases. The presence o f free chlorine (0.8 mg/L) in the system and having mixing in the photoreactor has the highest rate (0.8 mg/L min) comparing to the rest o f the cases. Although, the presence of free chlorine in each case (with mixing or without mixing) had

show n higher rem oval o f LAS, as the initial rate in the presence o f free chlorine in the system without m ixing is 0.4 mg/L min, while this rate is 0.2 mg/L min for the case o f w ithout free chlorine. However, this variation is much more in the presence o f mixing in the system , as the initial rate in the presence o f free chlorine in the system with mixing is 0.8 m g/L min, w hile this rate is 0.27 mg/L min for the case o f mixing but without the presence o f free chlorine .

4.1.2

D ark R eaction
It was observed that there were no significant changes in the concentration o f

LA S during the dark reaction (Figure 4.3). Therefore, LAS is neither degraded nor adsorbed in the absence o f UV lights. This experiment was conducted with two different initial concentrations o f LAS to compare the effects o f initial concentration on the degradation during dark reaction. In Figure 4.3, the changes for the initial concentration o f 95 m g/L and 65 mg/L o f LAS were monitored and it was observed that there no significant changes in the concentration o f LAS.

There w as a concern that the concentration o f LAS might decrease due to foaming o f LA S after
6

h. It was observed that the foaming was increased rapidly from the

beginning o f the experim ent and it was believed that these foams contain an excess o f surfactant. However, sam pling from the bulk o f liquid phase for
6

hours did not show any

differences in the concentrations o f LAS from beginning until the end o f the experiment (Figure 4.3).

A fter elim ination o f free chlorine from the tap water inside the feed tank, sufficient LAS w as added to the feed tank to make a 100 mg/L o f LAS solution. The experim ent was not started after addition o f flaked LAS to the water, as LAS should be m ixed in the tank to produce a uniform concentration throughout the feed tank. M oreover, the tem perature o f water may not be exactly 20^C, which is the operating tem perature. Therefore, the solution was mixed thoroughly in the system for one hour (dark reaction). D uring this period o f time, the temperature o f the system was kept at 20°C prio r to turning on the UV lamps.

72

D uring the dark reaction, the concentration o f LAS did not change, furthermore, if the duration o f stabilization period was known, the experiment could be run w ith the precise concentration o f LAS. Sampling was started exactly after addition o f a know n amount o f LAS to the water. Therefore, the changes in the concentration o f LAS from the time o f the addition until achieving to the equilibrium concentration o f LAS were monitored. As it is show n in Figure 4.4, the concentration o f LAS was about 87 mg/L after a few second o f addition o f 10 g o f flaked LAS to the water inside the feed tank and reached to 100 m g/L after 45 m in. Therefore, the optimum stabilization time prior to the start o f each run w as 45 min to one hour. Moreover, it took about 45 min for the system 's temperature to reach to 20°C. This period o f time could vary depending on the tem perature o f water being used.

4.1.3. P hotoreaction of LAS by UV-254
The flow rate and also the mixing speed were changed during the experiment and the effects o f these parameters on the photolytic degradation rate o f LAS w ere studied. In this experim ent, all conditions were kept the same as to those o f the dark reaction except that th e
6

UV lamps were turned on simultaneously after the stabilization period.

Furtherm ore, the tem perature o f the reactor was kept constant at 20°C using the water bath, during all the experiment, therefore, the effect o f increasing the tem perature due to the U V lam ps have been eliminated. Three Samples were taken every hour and analyzed im m ediately. The initial concentration o f LAS was 100 mg/L. The flow rate and also the m ixing speed were changed during the experiment. Therefore, the effects o f changing both o f those param eters on the photolytic degradation rate of LAS were studied.

4.1.3.1

Effects o f Flow R ate
Experim ents were carried out to compare the effects o f flow rate on the

photolytic degradation o f LAS with a constant mixing speed for all o f the runs. The ranges o f flow rates were varied from 4-40 L/min. Lower and higher flow rates were not

applied due to the system lim itations and excessive foaming problem inside the flow m eter, w hich m ade the flow rate inconsistent.

Figure 4.5 illustrates the flow rate o f

8

L/min has the highest initial rate (5x10"^

m g/L.h), while the flow rate o f 32 L/min has the lowest (3x10'^ mg/L.h). It implies that the rate o f reaction o f the lowest flow rate is faster; hence, it can degrade more than the rest o f the flow rates in a given period o f time. At flow rate o f degraded by 75% during
6 8

L/min, LAS can be

hours. That can be due to the increase in the residence time by

decreasing the flow rate, which gives more time to the organics exposed to illumination. There lore, UV w ith the wavelength o f 254 nm has more tim e to break the bonds. H ow ever, as the w hole system is batch and more than 75% o f solution inside the feed tank w ould enter the photoreactor in each cycle, the above mentioned reason might not be reasonable for increasing the initial rate by increasing the flow rate. On the other hand, by increasing the flow rate there is an increase in the amount o f foams in the system. The foam s m ight also w ork as a barrier in higher flow rates to hinder the light from being absorbed by the solution.

First order m odel was tried for the photolytic degradation o f LAS and it was observed that the photolytic degradation o f LAS did not follow that model. The reason m ight be due to the occurrence o f two reactions simultaneously. One reacts with slower rate and the other w ith a faster rate. Therefore, a double exponential model (combination o f tw o first order m odel) might be a good choice. The other reason for not following first order m odel m ight be due to the fact that MBAS method measures all o f the anionic com pounds that were produced during the photolytic degradation o f LAS.

4.1.3.2

Effect o f Mixing Speed on the Photolytic Degradation of LAS
It was observed that the degradation o f LAS was increased by increasing the

m ixing speed. This is due to the production o f turbulent flow in the system which increases the m ass transfer rate inside the reactor. The turbulent flow was initiated after 165 rpm and the sharp increase in the initial rate o f reaction after 165 rpm could be due to

the turbulent flow. To predict the type o f flow, Reynolds number's calculation was based on th e assum ption that there is no other movement inside the reactor except for the m ixing. Therefore, the lowest flow rate was chosen to produce a laminar flow inside the reactor w hich gave Reynolds number equal to 132. . It was observed that at 165 rpm the R eynolds num ber reached to 2750, which is in the range o f turbulency. While the R eynolds num bers for the lower m ixing speeds have not reached to the turbulence zone. W ater flow could also produce small channels within the photoreactor that allows the w ater to pass rapidly through the reactor without coming into contact with the UV lights. Figure 4.6 shows that the initial rate o f degradation was increased by increasing the m ixing speed. However, there was almost no difference between the photolytic degradation by changing the speed from 7-10, as the rotational speed for those numbers are alm ost the same (Table 3.1). The maximum degradation occurred by trying the m axim um m ixing speed was 80% in
6

hours.

4.1.4

O ptim ization of H 2 O 2 fo r D egradation of LAS
U V alone could degrade the LAS up to maximum 80% during
6

h. In the next

experim ents the effects o f H 2 O2 on the photolytic degradation o f LAS were examined. In order to speed up the degradation rate o f LAS, sufficient H 2 O 2 is essential so that it can absorb UV light and generates sufficient hydroxyl radicals. Therefore, different

concentrations o f H 2 O 2 were used, while the initial concentration o f LAS was kept constant. Figure 4.7 shows that H 2 O 2 has the ability to degrade LAS rapidly. Therefore, the reaction tim e was 4.5 h shorter than that o f the previous experiments using UV alone. The addition o f 120 mg/L H 2 O 2 could degrade LAS up to 80% at two hours, while increasing the concentration o f H 2 O 2 led to increase in the degradation rate. In order to find the optim um concentration for the hydrogen peroxide, a pseudo-first order model w ith respect to the concentration o f LAS was assumed (Figure 4.8). The degradation constant w as increased by increasing the dosage o f H 2 O 2 , but increasing the concentration beyond 720 mg/L showed negative effect on the LAS degradation. Therefore, the optim um concentration o f H 2 O 2 was about 720 mg/L. Higher

concentration o f H 2 O 2 led to a decrease in degradation rate o f LAS.

80

This could be due to the following reasons (Ledakowicz and Genera, 1999): 1. A uto-oxidation o f H 2 O 2 into O 2 and H 2 O, and recombination o f *0H by means o f H 2 O 2 according to the following reactions;

(4.1)

2. T he excess o f H 2 O 2 reacts with "OH competing with pollutants and, hence, decreasing the efficiency o f the treatment.

H 2 O 2 +* O H -> H 2 O + ' O .H k = 3 .3 x 10' (wo/.5) '

(4.2)

M oreover, the concentration o f an optimal H 2 0 2 /pollutant molar ratio between 10 and 100 has been proposed (Parra et al., 2002). In this experiment this ratio was in that range as it w as 72 (m ole H 2 0 2 /m ole LAS). The ratio o f H 2 O 2 to LAS which would result to com plete m ineralization is 50:1, but what was obtained from experim ent was 72:1. This difference m ight be due to the presences o f intermediates which their reaction with `OH could increase this ratio.

4.1.5

M odel fo r the D egradation o f LAS with UV+H 2 O 2
It was observed that the photolytic degradation o f LAS follows first order model

(Figure 4.9). Therefore the concentration of LAS at any time during photolytic degradation using H 2 O 2 can be expressed by the following model:

(4.3)

w here the first order constant (k) and Co, the initial concentration o f LAS, are equal to 0.0326 m i n ' and 100 mg/L, respectively. Therefore C is the concentration o f LAS at

tim e t (m in) is as follows:

(4.4)

As there was only little decrease in the concentration of H 2 O 2 during the degradation of LAS and its concentration was much more than the concentration of LAS during the degradation, the concentration of H2 O 2 was assumed constant, and hence, the degradation model for LAS follows pseudo first order reaction. However monitoring the COD, showed only 20% decrease during the period of reaction. It was supposed that the degradation of LAS during that period of time had moved toward formation o f organics rather than complete oxidation of LAS. However, TOC results are needed to determine the level of total mineralization of the organics.

4.1.6 Photolytic Degradation of LAS by using UV-254, Optimum Concentration of H 2 O 2 , and their Combination
The degradation of LAS was compared for the following conditions: 1. by the optimum concentration of H2 O2 along with UV-254 2. by the optimum concentration of 720 mg/L H2 O2 alone 3. by UV-254 alone

In each of those conditions, the initial concentration of LAS was 100 mg/L. After the illumination period o f 120 min, it was observed that H2 O2 +UV could remove LAS up to 95%, while the LAS removal by H2 O2 alone and UV alone were 13%, and 41%, respectively (Figure 4.10). To investigate the time necessary for the complete photolytic removal o f LAS using optimum concentration of H 2 O 2 , the experiment was run until the concentration o f LAS was 0.5 mg/L which is the maximum contamination level set by EPA. Therefore, the illumination time necessary to degrade LAS by this method was 180 min (Figure 4.11 ).

Three separate samples were taken and analyzed, in which case the standard deviations (error bars) represent sampling, preparation, and instrum ent error.

85

As it is shown in Figure 4.12, the pH was decreased 2% and 20% in the treatment of LAS by UV and UV/H 2 O 2 , respectively. This suggests that the photolytic degradation of LAS by UV/H 2 O2 occurs through formation of acids. Decreasing the pH shows that the degradation follows the general degradation pattern for AOPs (production of acids)(Mantazavinos et al, 2000). Nevertheless, as the foaming ability of LAS was decreased by preceding the experiment, it was suggested that there are two mechanisms for degrading LAS (Mantzavinos et al. 2000): 1. Breakage o f alkyl chain, which results a shorter chain incapable of behaving as detergent, 2. Attack o f free radicals to the aromatic ring and removal of solfoxy group, which destroy the detergency nature.

4.1.8

Impact of the Catalase on Analysis of H 2 O 2
To investigate the impact o f the addition o f insufficient or excessive amount of

catalase on the analysis o f H2 O2 and BOD5 test, different concentrations of catalase were examined. To decompose 60 mg/L of H2O 2 , 0.1 mg of catalase was added to 100 mL of sample and left without stirring for 100 min (Ito et al., 1998). After that time, the concentration o f H 2 O2 was measured by DPD method and it was observed that its concentration was zero. Insufficient and excessive amount of catalase were added to
6

samples of H2 O 2 with the volume of 100 mL each. Sodium acetate was chosen as a standard to compare the impact of catalase on the chosen test. Also, the presence of H2 O2 can interfere with BOD test and inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Therefore, BOD 5 test was chosen as a reference test. Six different samples containing different concentrations o f catalase were prepared. Samples 1-5 contained 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg o f catalase, respectively. The mentioned masses of catalase were dissolved in 100 mL o f H 2 O 2 solution with initial concentration of H 2O 2 equal to 60 mg/L.

Sample

6

was 1 mg catalase with no H 2 O2 in it, and sample 7 was just sodium

acetate with the concentration of 30 mg/L. Thirty mL of sodium acetate was added to 7 BOD bottles, and 25 mL of samples 1-6 were added to just
6

of those bottles.

The rest o f the bottles were filled with appropriate amount o f seed solution and diluted water (Section 3.2.16). The sealed bottles were kept in incubator at 20°C for 5 days. The results are illustrated in Figure 4.13. It was expected that if the H 2 O2 was reduced by proper amount o f catalase, the
BOD5

of the solutions be around the BOD; of sodium

acetate solution alone. As Figure 4.13 depicts, it can be concluded that when the concentration o f catalase is lower than optimum, there are still some H 2 O2 presence in solution. Therefore, residual H2 O 2 produce a toxic effect and reduce the consumption of oxygen, and BOD; cannot reach to its true value which is equal to the BOD; of sodium acetate alone. Moreover, excessive amount of catalase can increase the consumption of oxygen in the test. Moreover, excess arr.'v' f catalase produced the initial dissolved

oxygen in the solution above the saturation level (13 mg/L O 2 ), this dissolved oxygen would decrease dramatically after 5 days of incubation. Therefore, the concentration of catalase should be around its optimum value, which is 0.1 mg of catalase per 100 mL of sample containing H 2 O 2 at 60 mg/L, to eliminate 60 mg/L of H2 O2 effectively.

4.1.9 Impact of H 2 O 2 on COD and BOD test
To investigate the impact of H 2 O 2 presence on the COD tests, the COD of the samples with H2 O 2 were compared to the same samples where their H 2O 2 had been eliminated. It was observed that the samples with H 2 O 2 exert an excessive amount of oxygen for chemical oxidation in comparison to the samples without H 2 O 2 . Meanwhile, the theoretical oxygen demand of the 100 mg/L o f LAS was calculated as 240 mg/L O2 . It is known that COD is usually lower than the theoretical oxygen demand as most of the organic compounds (mainly aromatic) cannot be oxidized chemically under test conditions. Therefore, the COD test was conducted on the LAS samples treated by UV/H 2 O2 for 90 minutes. As these samples contained residual H2 O 2 , the COD o f these samples were analyzed with residual H 2 O2 , and it was compared to the COD o f these samples after elimination o f H2 O 2 . The COD for the sample with residual H 2 O2 , which is higher than ThOD, cannot be the true value for COD (Figure 4.14) as the theoretical value of oxygen consumption is the maximum amount oxygen that a compound can consume during its chemical oxidation.

89

Therefore, the residual H 2 O 2 can interfere with COD measurements due to its reaction with dichromate, and this reaction could increase the measured COD (Lin et al., 1999). Moreover as it can be observed from Figure 4.13, the sample with residual H 2 O 2 consumes less oxygen in BOD 5 test, compared to the sample with no H 2 O 2 . This is due to the fact that H 2 O2 is bactericide and inhibits the bacteria activity. Therefore, residual H2 O2 can inhibit the bacterial growth in the BOD tests, and hence, underestimate the actual BOD.

4.1.10

Consumption of H 2 O 2 during the Photolytic Reaction of LAS

During the photo-oxidation process, the LAS concentration was decreased. In the photolytic oxidation using UV along with H2 O2 the degradation rate of LAS was higher than the degradation rate of LAS by UV alone by about 50% in 90 minutes. Consequently, there was a decrease in the concentration of H2 O2 as it was being used as an oxidant. The consumption of H 2 O 2 was monitored from the beginning of the experiment until the concentration o f LAS became about zero. The concentration of H 2 O2 was measured by DMP method, a precise technique. Figure 4.15 shows the consumption of H 2 O2 during three hours o f reaction. The decrease in the concentration o f H2 O2 was due to the production o f hydroxyl radicals and reaction between hydroxyl radical and organics as follows:

The H 2 O2 decrease during this period of time was uniform, and hence, it was observed that its consumption rate followed zero-order model (Figure 4.15).

Illum ination tim e m eans that the changes in the value o f COD were monitored during the photolytic degradation (UV+H 2 O 2 ) o f LAS.

91

The H 2 O 2 consumption model is as follows:

[H 2 O 2 ] = -3.57861+691.12

(4-7)

where [H2 O 2 ] is the concentration of H 2 O2 at time t and rate constant is equal to 3.57 min*'. Therefore, the approximate concentration of H2 O2 can be calculated at each time according to the Equation 4.7, to find the optimum concentration of catalase which is necessary to eliminate the residual H 2 O2 for the subsequent biological treatment (Appendix A).

4.2 LAS

Effects of Photolytic Pre-treatm ent on the Biodegradability of

4.2.1 Biological Oxygen Demand for LAS
It has been shown that the inhibitory effect of LAS in its biodegradability increases by increasing the concentration of LAS (Patterson et al., 2002). The biodegradability o f four different concentrations o f untreated LAS was examined (100 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 25 mg/L, and 12 mg/L). The
BOD5

tests for all concentrations were

performed. As Figure 4.16 shows, by increasing the concentration o f LAS the consumption o f O2 was decreased. The consumption of oxygen was decreased by about 50%, by changing the concentration of LAS from 25 mg/L to 100 mg/L. It is obvious that this decrease was not due to the decrease of organics in bottles; however, the

microorganisms in the activated sludge could not grow and use oxygen by increasing the LAS concentration. Therefore, LAS has inhibitory effect on microorganisms as its concentration increases. Moreover, the ratio of
B O D 5 /C O D

is often used to express the
B O D 5 /C O D

biodegradability o f wastewater. Figure 4.17 shows the ratio of concentrations o f LAS. Values for
B O D 5 /C O D

for the same

less than 0.4 suggest that the wastewater

is difficult to be biodegraded. It can be observed that this ratio for LAS at 100 mg/L is about 0.1, suggesting that LAS is recalcitrant at higher concentrations, and it is resistant to conventional biological treatments (Yu et al., 1998).

Three separate samples were taken and analyzed, in which case the standard deviations (error bars) represent sampling, preparation, and instrument error.

93

These results were in accordance with another study that the growth rate o f mixed culture o f microorganisms can be inhibited by LAS at the concentration of 95 mg/L (WHO, 1996).

The effects o f photolytic pre-treatment of LAS on its biodegradability during the course o f the reaction were studied. As Figure 4.18 depicts, the ratio o f C/Cq (concentration of LAS at any time/initial concentration of LAS) was decreased up to 92% during 90 minutes o f photolytic reaction using 720 mg/L of H 2 O 2 as an oxidant. However, this decrease was sharp during the initial period of the reaction. After 15 minutes, C/Cg decreases gradually. The opposite trend was observed for the ratio of BOD 5/COD. This ratio increases gradually. This suggests that as the concentration of LAS decreases, the intermediates produced are more biodegradable than the parent compounds. After 90 minutes, the
B O D 5 /C O D

was 0.4, suggesting that although the

untreated LAS was recalcitrant, the intermediates produced at this point were biodegradable under conventional biological treatment.

during

photochemical oxidation time can also be expressed in terms o f biodegradability factor, fa (Equation 2.16). It was observed that the biodegradability factor for the LAS treated in photolytic reactor was increased as the time proceeded (Figure 4.19). Therefore, again it was concluded that pre-treatment of LAS by this method was toward the increasing of its biodegradability. However, this increase was sharp during the first hour and after that increases gradually. It is in accordance with the
B O D 5 /C O D

ratio, as this ratio follows the

same increasing pattern. On the other hand, comparing this finding with the changes in the concentration o f LAS during illumination period, it could also be concluded that LAS decreased very fast during the first hour and after that there was little change in its concentration. To measure the biodegradability of the LAS, residual H2 O 2 was

eliminated, as it could inhibit the growth of microorganisms. This elimination was done by catalase using the technique explained before.

4.2.2 U ltim ate BOD for the Biodégradation of LAS
The BOD for three different samples of LAS was modeled as follows: 1. Untreated LAS at the concentration o f 100 mg/L 2. Pre-treated LAS by UV and optimum concentration o f H 2 O 2 after 15 minutes o f treatm ent 3- Pre-treated LAS by UV and optimum concentration o f H 2 O 2 after 1.5 hours o f treatment.

T he BOD model is as follows (Section 3.2.17):

B O D = U B O D (l-e~'^)

(4.8)

w here BODt, k, t, and UBOD are the amount o f BOD at time t, rate constant, reaction tim e, and is the ultim ate biological oxygen demand, respectively.

Figure 4.20 illustrates the BOD results for those three samples, mentioned above, in a 30-day period. With high concentration o f LAS in the untreated sample, oxygen consum ption was only 5.2 m g/L O 2 during 30 days, indicating that LAS was toxic to the m icroorganism s. Therefore, complete mineralization o f LAS at the concentration o f 100 m g/L w as not possible. The consumption of oxygen during 30 days for the second

sam ple w as eight tim es m ore than first sample (second sample consumed 38 mg/L O 2 during 30 days), but still less than the third sample. The consumption o f oxygen during 30 days for the third sample was 57 mg/L O 2 . This indicates that the second sample was m ore biodegradable than the first sample. Therefore, the pre-treatment had the ability to increase the biodegradability o f LAS, and as the reaction progress this effect was increased. Plotting the BOD versus time for those samples indicates that the removal o f LAS in those sam ples follow first order model (Equation 4.8). Table 4.1 shows BOD

m odels for each sample. As it can be seen the sample with 1.5 h o f photolytic pretreatm ent has the fastest reaction rate which is equal to 0.2839 (day) . Therefore, it would be biodegraded 2 tim es faster than the untreated sample at 100 mg/L o f LAS.

99

It is documented that the ultimate BOD of a sample is equal to 0 .9 2 times the biodegradable portion of its COD (Eckenfelder, 2 0 0 0 ). Therefore, the relation between
UBOD and biodegradable COD is as follows;

UBOD= 0.9 2 X (COD)d

(4 9 )

where UBOD and (COD)d are ultimate BOD and biodegradable portion of total COD of the sample, respectively. Moreover, total soluble COD can be calculated as the sum of biodegradable COD and non-biodegradable COD. Therefore, the portion of nonbiodegradable COD for liv'; > ' ove samples can be calculated easily. It was observed that as the photolytic reaction of LAS proceeded, the portion of non-biodegradable COD was decreased. As the non-biodegradable COD for the sample after 1.5 hours of photolytic treatment with H2 O 2 was 55% of total COD while this value for untreated LAS was 93%. Consequently, half o f the total COD in the sample with 1.5 h pre-treatment was biodegradable, whereas almost all of the total COD in the untreated sample was nonbiodegradable COD. Therefore, if LAS with photolytic pre-treatment is going to be treated further by biological treatment, all of the organics cannot be removed in the biological treatment. That is due to the presence of some non-biodegradable intermediates in the effluent of photolytic treatment (56% of intermediates were nonbiodegradable in the effluent of photolytic treatment after 1.5 h of pre-treatment). This portion of non-biodegradable COD can be corresponded to the primary photolytic degradation of LAS oxidizing alkyl chain, and resulting sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates. It has also been reported that sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates are refractory to biodégradation (Patterson et al., 2002). Consequently, as the photolytic reaction proceeded, the biodegradable portion of COD was produced through cleavage the phenyl ring and removing sulfonate group.

Therefore, the concentration of LAS used in this experiment was reduced to 10 mg/L, 3. LAS at the concentration o f 10 mg/L without pre-treatment, 4. LAS at the concentration o f 100 mg/L without pre-treatment.

There were some H 2 O 2 residues in the pre-treated sample (the concentration o f H 2 O 2 w as 400 mg/L after 1.5 h o f photolytic treatment). The H 2 O 2 residue was

elim inated with catalase before biological shake flask process according to the calculation described in Appendix A.

D uring the biological treatment, the concentration o f LAS was monitored to com pare the degradation o f untreated LAS with the one with photolytic pre-treatment. Furtherm ore, pH and dissolve oxygen (DO) were measured on a daily basis (Figure 4.21). The pH for all types o f samples was not adjusted and sample 1,2,3, and 4 had pH equal to 6.76, 6.56, 6.70, and 6.80, respectively. Therefore, the pH was in the acceptable range (the acceptable range for the pH in the biological treatment is between no significant change in pH during the course of the process. during
6

to 8 ). There was

DO was also measured

the treatm ent period, to make sure there was enough oxygen for the

m icroorganism in the system. Each sample from the shake flasks taken was divided into tw o parts. LAS from the first part was measured directly, but the second part was filtered w ith W hatm ann glass fiber with pore diameter o f 1.58 pm (Standard M ethod, 1998) to separate the sludge from the liquor and then the concentration o f LAS in the liquor was m easured.

Initially it was observed that the concentration o f LAS (40 mg/L) in the liquid phase in the untreated sam ple had a 16.5% decrease during the first day. However, as it is know n that LAS is adsorbed to the sludge in aerobic biological treatm ent (Bem a et al., 1989), the analysis o f sludge showed that LAS had been adsorbed to the sludge up to 96% . Figure 4.22 show s the changes in the degradation o f LAS in the liquid and sludge

103

phase. Initially, as the concentration of LAS in the liquid phase decreases, its concentration in the solid phase increased. This increase was up to
8

days and after that

LAS in the sludge started to degrade. This suggests that the microorganisms in the sludge were acclimated to LAS and had been capable of degrading the LAS. The same pattern was observed in the literature (Rittmann et al., 2001). As the Figure 4.22 shows, after 31 days the concentration o f LAS had not reached zero yet. Moreover, the sludge at day 31 still contained a considerable amount of LAS which was still more than the maximum contamination level. Furthermore, about 30% of the initial LAS remained in sludge, even if the effluent did not contain any LAS. This percentage of remaining LAS in this sludge was also observed in another study (Patterson et al., 2002). However, the total amount of LAS measured in the mixed phased in some days was seemed to be more than the initial concentration of LAS. This could be due to the fact that MBAS method measures the total concentration of anions rather than LAS alone, and hence, produces a positive error which means MBAS method has measured LAS plus other anions present in the solution.

On the other hand, the concentration of the pre-treated LAS reached to zero in 11 days. The concentration of LAS in the sludge had an increase from 4 to
6

mg/L, but it

reached to its initial concentration in 15 days (Figure 4.23). Furthermore, the degradation rate o f pre-treated and untreated LAS was compared with each other (sample 2 and 3). Figure 4.24 shows the difference between these two. As Figure 4.24 shows, it is obvious that during the first day, the pre-treated LAS was degraded by 30%, while the untreated LAS was degraded by 40%, suggesting that pre-treated LAS was less biodegradable than untreated LAS when dealing with the low concentration of LAS (10 mg/L), due to the presence of some other organics (intermediates). The same results were obtained by comparing the BOD 5/COD for photo treated LAS and untreated LAS with exactly the same concentration. The ratio for BOD5/COD for pre-treated LAS was 0.4, while this ratio for untreated LAS at the concentration of 10 mg/L was 0.5. This implies that untreated LAS at the concentration of 10 mg/L is more biodegradable than pre-treated LAS at this concentration. This can be due to the presence o f sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates produced from photolytic pre-treatment of LAS, which have been reported to be refractory to biodégradation (Patterson et al., 2002). However, reliable conclusion could

104

only be obtained by having the amount o f total organic carbon (TOC) for those two types o f wastew ater.

T he biodégradation rate o f LAS in those experiments, as it was reported (Huang et al., 2000, Zhang et al., 1999), follows first order model (Figure 4.25). The pre-treated LAS follow ed the following model:

In

= - 0 .0 1 0 4 r + 0.1128

(4.10)

w here C is the concentration o f LAS at tim e t, and Co is the initial concentration o f LAS w hich is equal to the concentration o f the photoreactor effluent.

T he biodégradation o f untreated LAS at the same concentration also followed the follow ing model:

KC

= - 0 . 0 1 8 8 / + 0.2213

(4.11)

It is obvious that the constant for untreated LAS should be more than pre-treated LAS at the sam e concentration, as the concentration o f LAS decreased in untreated LAS faster than pre-treated one.

H ow ever, the untreated LAS at the initial concentration o f 40 mg/L followed the follow ing m odel (Figure 4.26):

109

Therefore, the constant for untreated LAS at the concentration o f 10 mg/L is about 5 times faster than that of untreated LAS at 40 mg/L.

The analysis of the LAS at the concentration of 100 mg/L was not successfiil, as the concentration of LAS did not change in the shake flask after 30 days. Moreover, the analysis of the sludge after 30 days showed a decrease in biomass weight over 30 days. This suggests that the growth rate of mixed culture of microorganisms was inhibited at the concentration of 100 mg/L. This is consistent with the results obtained by Zhang et al. (1999). Furthermore, there was no visible decrease in the foaming o f LAS at 100 mg/L during the period of biological treatment. Therefore, it supports the previous test (BOD 5 /COD=0 . 1 ) which showed that LAS at this concentration had a toxic effect on the microorganisms. As LAS at the concentration of lOO mg/L inhibited the growth of microorganisms, consequently, the microorganisms did not have the ability to degrade LAS at the concentration of 100 mg/L.

4.2.4 (SBR)

Biological Treatment of LAS using Sequential Batch Reactors

An aerobic sequential batch reactor was used to generate acclimated biomass for biological treatment of LAS (see Section 3.2.21 for more details). As the concentration of influent to the aerobic treatment (produced from chemical photo lytic treatment of LAS with the optimum concentration of H2 O2 ) was supposed to be 10 mg/L, the objective of this experiment was to adapt the biomass to that concentration o f LAS. The effect of acclimation on the biodegradability of LAS was studied. To increase the rate of biomass growth during the acclimation period, LAS was diluted with sodium acetate. This dilution was based on the initial characteristic of 10 mg/L LAS. It was observed that LAS at this concentration had a the dilution was in a way to provide the same B O D 5 . It was also observed that sodium acetate at the concentration of 45 mg/L could produce such a BOD 5. Therefore, the experiment was started by addition of 45 mg/L sodium acetate to the SBR reactor.

Moreover, activated sludge (from North Toronto Treatment Plant) and nutrient with the ratio o f BOD:N:P equal to 100:5:1 were fed to the reactor. The nutrient medium was com posed o f KH2 PO 4 , K2 HPO4 , NaHP 0 4 . VHjO, NH 4 CI, MgS 0 4 , FeCb, and C aC h

(Standard Methods, 1998). The nutrients were added to the system weekly.

Air was provided by air diffuser and the system was mixed at the speed of 300 rpm. The concentration o f LAS in the substrate was gradually increased according to the Figure 4.27; meanwhile, the concentration o f sodium acetate was decreased to maintain BOD 5 equal to 30 mg/L. The addition o f new substrate was provided when the changes in the concentration o f LAS in the reactor became steady state, in other words the concentration o f LAS became zero (Figure 4.27). The concentrations o f LAS were measured at the end o f settling period. pH, DO, MLVSS, temperature, COD, and the concentration o f LAS were monitored daily at the end of settling period. BOD 5 was

monitored 3 times per week. DO was almost constant at 7 mg/L O2 (Figure 4.28), as a result, the system had always enough oxygen during the react period. Figure 4.29 shows the changes in pH during the acclimation period. It shows that pH had a slight variation, but it was always in the proper range o f pH. The temperature was around room temperature (25+1 °C) and was constant. The BOD 5 results were almost the same during each sampling (Figure 4.28). This suggests in spite of increasing the concentration o f LAS in the substrate, the microorganisms needed the same oxygen for metabolism due to acclimation to LAS. Subsequent to completing the acclimation period, the supernatant in the reactor was drawn and the reactor was filled with pre-treated LAS and nutrients. As microorganisms were acclimated to LAS, the associated lag time in the bioassays would decrease. Figure 4.30 shows the changes in the concentration of pre-treated LAS, and its COD and BOD 5 after the adaptation o f microorganisms. The concentration o f LAS in the biological reactor with the acclimated microorganisms reached zero in two days. COD and BOD 5 also had a decrease during that period, but they did not reach to zero. This might be due to the presence o f some other intermediates produced during either biological or chemical treatment o f LAS which were less biodegradable than LAS. Although in order to have a precise judgment o f whether the concentration of the organics were increasing or decreasing, TOC results are required. Subsequent to the

113

treatment of each batch, the liquid was drawn during the draw period and filled with a new influent to examine the precision of the previous experiment. The biological treatment of LAS with acclimated sludge was repeated for three times.

Figure 4.31 shows the difference between the biodégradation of pre-treated LAS with the same concentration of LAS without any previous pre-treatment. The biodégradation of pre-treated LAS and untreated LAS at the concentration of 10.5 mg/L with adapted biomass followed the same trend as using unadapted biomass in shake flask experiments. In SBR again, the biodégradation of untreated LAS was faster than pre treated LAS.

Assuming a first order model for their degradation (Figure 4.32), LAS without pre treatment had a higher rate constant (k=0.1312 h"') than LAS with pre-treatment (k=0.0616 h''). This might be due to the presence of some intermediate produced by chemical treatment of LAS which are less biodegradable than LAS. The same conclusion has reported previously by degradation of LAS by means of wet air oxidation process (Mantzavinos et al., 2001). The degradation rate of pre-treated LAS was best fitted into first order kinetic rate which is in accordance with the previous studies (Huang et al., 2000, Zhang et al., 1999).

The pre-treated LAS in the sequential batch reactor followed the following model:

Table 4.2 shows different rate constants for different types o f LAS for adapted and non-adapted microorganisms. It can be concluded that biodégradation o f LAS with adapted m icroorganisms had higher constants both for untreated and pre-treated LAS. M oreover, untreated LAS had higher rate constants than pre-treated LAS with the same initial concentration.

4.3 C om parison between Com bination of Photochemical and Biological Processes for the T reatm ent of LAS versus Photochemical T reatm ent alone
A s it was mentioned before, LAS at the concentration o f 100 mg/L has inhibitory effect to the microorganisms, therefore, it cannot be treated by biological processes alone. It cannot also be discharged to the environment as its maximum contam ination level in ground water is 0.5 mg/L (EPA, 2004). Consequently, there should be a reliable treatment method to decrease its concentration to the desired level. The photolytic treatm ent o f LAS with H 2 O 2 is promising for its degradation; however, the operation cost o f peroxide treatment is about
10

times more than that o f activated sludge

treatm ent (Esplugas and Ollis, 1997). Therefore, an attempt was made to combine these two processes to achieve o a cost efficient method. It was observed that pre-treatment by U V /H 2 O 2 could increase the biodegradability o f LAS (with the initial concentration o f 100 m g/L ) by 30% (measured by BOD5 test). However, different residence times for both chem ical and biological reactors may be applied. No specific residence time for either chem ical or biological processes could be suggested unless considering a time that optim izes the treatm ent cost for this combination. In the following sections the relative cost o f utilizing combination o f photochemical and biological treatment has been com pared versus photo-chemical treatment alone. As this is only a comparison, no treatm ent cost has been calculated and only their relative costs versus each other has been com pared.

Characteristics of the Integration of Photochemical and

Biological processes
The combined system for the treatment of LAS at 100 mg/L is defined as follows: Compound A (LAS) is fed into the combined process. The combination consists of a photolytic reactor followed by a SBR. Therefore, compound A is first fed into the photolytic reactor and degrades into biodegradable compounds. However, only one of the measurable and significant intermediate for LAS is considered for the simplicity purposes. Moreover, the reaction time in the chemical reactor is set to degrade compound A or. daily. The effluent (consists of A and intermediate S) is then fed into the bioreactor for complete degradation. The objective is to define an optimal residence time in

chemical and biological reactors that minimizes the relative cost of the combined processes.

The total residence time is defined by Equation (2.17) and the overall, chemical, and biological efficiencies are defined by Equations (2.18), (2.19), and (2.20), respectively. The overall system in the chemical process acted as a batch reactor. H 2 O2 was used as an oxidant and the optimum concentration of H2 O2 is known. It is assumed that the main intermediate produced by degradation of LAS with UV-2 5 4 /H 2 O2 was known to be sodium benzene sulfonate. Therefore, the intermediate was produced during the degradation of LAS and then undergo photolytic degradation defined by first-order kinetics as follows:

A --^ S --^ R

( 4 . 15 )

where S is the intermediate and R is final product from the degradation of the intermediate S in chemical reactor, preferably it is the complete mineralization o f S. LAS was observed to follow the first order kinetic model with respect to LAS during its photolytic degradation (Equation 4.5):

where Cs, Ca, Cao, La, kg, and tc are the concentration o f S in the chemical fèactor effluent at time t, the concentration o f A at time t, initial concentration o f A, first-order rate constant for A, first-order rate constant for S, and the residence time in chemical reactor, respectively. It is supposed that the intermediate still posses the benzene ring, as the breakage o f aromatic ring is unlikely due to its high bond energy. Therefore, the degradation constant for the intermediate was assumed to be smaller than that of LAS, as a result it was supposed to be equal to
0 .0 0 1

m in''.

The effluent o f chemical reactor with tc minutes of residence time enters into the biological reactor. However, due to the high concentration of H 2 O 2 in the effluent o f chem ical reactor, the residues o f H 2 O2 should be eliminated first. That effluent contains both LAS and its intermediate. As the objective was to decrease the concentration o f LAS to 0.5 mg/L (m axim um contamination level set by EPA), the solution remains in biological reactor until it meets that concentration. In the bioreactor, it was observed that the degradation o f LAS follows the first order reaction model as mentioned in Equation (4.14):

w here C is the concentration o f LAS in the bioreactor at time t and C© is the initial concentration in the bioreactor which was equal to the concentration o f LAS in the

where C sb, Cs, and k are the concentrations of intermediate at time t in the bioreactor, initial concentration of intermediate in the bioreactor which was equal to the concentration o f intermediate in the effluent of the chemical reactor, and the first order reaction constant (min*') for the biodégradation of the intermediate, respectively. During the biological experiments, it was observed that the intermediate produced during the photolytic degradation of LAS was less biodegradable than LAS (which might be due to the high concentration of intermediate at that time), k for the degradation of intermediate was assumed to be equal to for the biodégradation o f untreated LAS. The chemical efficiency was defined as the reduction in concentration in AOP over 100% reductions in concentration of LAS; therefore, it can be expressed as follows (Scott and Ollis, 1996): 0.0009 min'* which is less than the constant

The biological efficiency was also expressed as reduction in the concentration of compounds in the biological reactor versus 100% concentration reduction (Scott and Ollis, 1996);

w here Z is the global efficiency. Consequently, as AOPs are m ore expensive than the biological treatment, ideally most organic removal should occur in biological stage (Patterson et al., 2002). Therefore, Y should be greater than X. T he objective function for the optimization o f the integration o f biological and chemical processes for this example is as follows (Esplugas and Ollis, 1997):

(4.21)

w here C is the relative cost function and a (a> l), and b (b=0.6) and c (c=0.6) are the volum etric cost ratio between AOP and biological reactor, and time constants,

respectively. The volumetric cost is the ratio for the operating cost o f chemical to biological treatment per each volume o f wastewater treated. The relative cost is used as a tool to compare o f different combinations o f chemical and biological processes from the econom ic point o f view. It is not the actual cost o f treatment, and higher values of the relative cost imply that the treatment cost would be higher. On the other hand, the low value o f relative cost shows lower treatment cost. In other words, the relative cost expresses the ratio o f chemical treatment to biological treatment cost, b was chosen equal to
0 .6

as in the absence o f the actual cost and when it is necessary to estimate the cost o f

equipm ent, good results can be obtained by using six-tenths-factor rule (Peters and Tim m erhaus, 1991). Moreover, simply combining the treatment time in bioreactor and chem ical reactor was not possible as the residence time in chemical reactor is 50 times less th an that o f biological reactor. However, the operating cost o f chemical treatment is
10

tim es more than biological treatment.

127

The constraints for this optimization example are set as follows; a) equality constraints:

=0.95

(the desired efficiency is 95%)

(4.22)

where

Cao, Cab, and Css are total (global) efficiency, the initial concentration o f

pollutant (mg/L), the concentration of the LAS in the bioreactor effluent (mg/L), and the concentration of intermediate in the bioreactor influent (mg/L), respectively.

b) inequality constraints:

ta, and

tc

are the concentration of intermediate leaving chemical reactor

(mg/L), the concentration o f the LAS in the bioreactor effluent (mg/L), the residence time in the bioreactor, and residence time in chemical reactor, respectively. The residence times are chosen to be positive as negative residence time is not acceptable in the process and that is the same for the concentrations. Moreover, it is expected that the concentration of A in the effluent should be less than the inlet concentration o f A in the chemical reactor.

4.15.2

Solution of the Optimization Procedures

According to the Equation 4.21, the applicable method is nonlinear equation with constraints. Therefore, the problem was solved numerically. The GRG2 (generalized reduced gradient) code is used to solve the model. Constant "a" in Equation (4.24) was chosen to be
10

as it is reported that the cost of peroxide treatment is about

10

times of

128

activated sludge treatm ent (Esplugas and Ollis, 1997). Constants "b" and "c" were chosen to be 0.6 for the same reason as suggested in a previous study (Esplugas and Ollis. 1997). Therefore, the objective function which provides an indication o f the relative costs of the com bined system would be in the form of:

C=tB°"+10tc"'

(4.28)

A fter solving the objective function of Equation (4.28) along with the constraints in Equations (4.22-4.27), the results o f the optimization are summarized in Table 4.3. As indicated in Table 4.3, the residence time in the chemical and biological reactors are 61.51 and 3365.58 minutes, respectively. Those residence times lead to decrease the concentration o f A from 100 mg/L to 13.88 mg/L in chemical reactor. Meanwhile, in the bioreactor, the concentration o f S decreases from 82.72 mg/L to 4 mg/L. This configuration m inim izes the total cost o f these integrated processes. Many other com binations for this global efficiency is possible that might even further decrease the final concentration o f the biological effluent, but these residence times for photolytic and biological reactors are the most cost effective one. Moreover, as it was mentioned before, in this combination, the efficiency o f chemical reactor is much less than the efficiency of the biological reactor. If only the goal was to reach the efficiency o f the photochemical reactor to
95

%, it was estimated that the residence tim e in the chemical reactor should be

2940 m in. This residence time would give a relative cost o f equal to 1205, while the concentration o f the intermediates reached to 5.4 mg/L. Moreover, the LAS at the initial concentration o f 100 mg/L did not have the ability to be degraded biologically. Therefore, LAS at the concentration o f 100 mg/L could not be treated by biological treatm ent alone.

Figure 4.34 illustrates the degradation o f compound A and formation o f compound S during the course o f the reaction in the chemical reactor. It is clear that the rate o f degradation o f A and formation o f S are influenced by their rate constants. Decreasing the rate constant o f degradation o f S can lead to increase the concentration o f S in the

photo-reactor s effluent, and hence, the concentration of the intermediate increases in the bioreactor. Therefore, the rate constant of the S in the bioreactor decreases. Consequently, decreasing the degradation rate of S alone did not show significant effect on the relative cost. As decreasing it by 4 orders of magnitudes, only it reduced the relative cost by 2%. Therefore, in the optimization o f the relative cost o f the combination, the degradation rate constant o f LAS has a significant effect. This can be due to the assum ption that LAS do not mineralize completely during pre-treatment and only produces intermediates with high bond energy that are supposed to be mineralized in the biological step. If these intermediates had a rate constant higher than the LAS degradation rate constant in the chemical stage, they would degrade faster than LAS and the chemical effluent contains almost no intermediate. This cannot be true due to the follow ing reasons: 1. The biodegradability tests showed that the effluent from the chemical reactor is less biodegradable than LAS at the same concentration, when dealing with LAS at lower concentrations (10 mg/L), and this is due to presence o f intermediates which are less biodegradable than LAS at the concentration o f 10 mg/L. 2. The COD test after pre-treatment showed little decrease. If it was true and the intermediates had the ability to be degraded rapidly, there should be a sharp decrease in the COD during the pre-treatment, as the concentration o f organics were decreasing rapidly 3. As the intermediate contains aromatic ring, the breakage o f this ring is more difficult than the breakage of the side chains. Therefore, the degradation of an intermediate with high bond energy is slower than its production, which is due to the breakage o f the side chain o f LAS. As a result, the assumption that the degradation o f the intermediate was less than the degradation o f LAS was a correct assumption.

The optimum operating conditions occur due to the design constraints and the global residence time. Using the integration of chemical and biological processes for LAS treatm ent instead o f single step o f AOP appears to reduce the total residence time in both chem ical and biological reactors while obtaining the desired total efficiency.

However, both capital and operating cost are less for biological treatment than those for AOP. Moreover, different chemical and biological residence times can give the same efficiency, but ju st one o f these residence times ( tc=61 min and tb=3365.58 min) can m inim ize the relative treatment cost.

CHAPTERS CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMANDATIONS

5.1. Conclusions
The following conclusions could be drawn from the thesis:

1. The LAS degradation was increased by decreasing the flow rate, as the residence time o f LAS in photoreactor increased. For the best case, using maximum mixing speed and lowest flow rate, the maximum degradation of LAS :was 80% during hours o f photolytic treatment. 2. Photolytic treatment alone is capable of degrading LAS in 120 min with the degradation rate o f only 40%. UV-C alone can degrade the organics by breaking their bonds directly. This breakage is possible only when the bond energy is less than the wavelength energy. 3. The optimum concentration o f H 2 O2 which should be used for the photochemical treatment of LAS with UV and H2 O2 was 720 mg/L. The photolytic treatment with the aid o f hydrogen peroxide can degrade LAS up to 95% in 120 min. This can be due to the ability of hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals, which in tern can react with the organics directly. 4. The chemical degradation of LAS led to produce intermediates, which were more biodegradable than LAS at the concentration of 100 mg/L. This increase was much more while UV was combined by hydrogen peroxide. 5. The biodegradability o f LAS highly depends on its concentration. LAS at the concentration of 100 mg/L is non-biodegradable and has inhibitory effect on microorganisms, while LAS at the concentration of 1 0 mg/L is more biodegradable than LAS at 100 mg/L.
6 6

.

The biodégradation o f pre-treated LAS by combination of UV and H 2 O 2 by mixed culture o f microorganisms was successful. The concentration of pre-treated LAS decreased to 0.5 mg/L during 11 days in shake flask experiment.

134

7. Adapting the activated sludge in the SBR to LAS at the concentration o f 10 mg/L resulted to an increase in the degradation rate of LAS. As the pre-treated LAS was degraded only in 48 hours.
8

. Adsorption o f LAS to the sludge plays an important role in the removal of LAS from the liquid phase. This problem becomes more obvious at the higher concentrations. Therefore, chemical pre-treatment for higher concentrations o f

LAS is highly recommended. 9. The pre-treated LAS at concentration o f 10 mg/L is less biodegradable than that of untreated LAS at 10 mg/L. This can be due to the high concentration of the
3

. ' intermediates in the effluent o f photo-chemical treatment. This implies that LAS at the lower concentration (10 mg/L) is even more biodegradable than pre-treated LAS, but at higher concentrations (100 mg/L) pre-treated biodegradable than untreated LAS. 10. By mathematical calculations it was observed that to obtain the total efficiency o f 95% in the chemical reactor alone, the residence time o f chemical reactor should be about 50 hours; however, coupling the chemical reactor with the biological reactor led the chemical residence time to about 1 hour (61 min). Moreover, this coupling can decrease the relative cost. LAS is more

Recommendations
The following recommendations could be suggested:

1.

The main problem in the biological experiments was the presence o f unknown intermediates, which were produced during photolytic oxidation o f LAS. If those intermediates were known, the acclimation procedures could be done by using them instead o f LAS, as they are supposed to present in the chemical effluent in high concentrations. Therefore, the biomass in the activated sludge was adapted to them and could degrade the pre-treated influent in a very short period o f time. Moreover, the intermediates should be known and the kinetic parameters for the intermediates could be measured and the optimization procedures could be done more accurately.

135

However, modeling the removal of LAS considering the mass transfer between liquid and solid phases could be a better model. 2. It is suggested that TOC analysis are done, as it could predict the degrees o f removal of organics during both chemical and biological processes. Furthermore, DOC results could be used to calculate the partial oxidation parameters, which set the optimal point for the oxidative treatment. The shorter reaction time avoids the high electrical cost o f the reaction. At longer photo-treatment time, the photochemical efficiency is improved by the unnecessary photo-degradation o f pollutants which are biologically degraded. This point could then be compared with what was obtained through optimization techniques. 3. It is suggested to model the optimization of photochemical treatment o f LAS combined by biological process by knowing the exact kinetic rate constants for the intermediates and considering the effect o f adsorption o f LAS to the sludge during its biological treatment.

(i) Calculation for the optimum concentration of catalase to remove H 2 O 2 completely.
One unit o f the catalase used in this study has the ability o f decomposing 1 pmol o f H 2 O 2 per minute, and each 2380 unit of this catalase is equivalent to
1 1

mg of catalase.

pm ol o f H2 O2 can be removed per minute, and

1 0 "* mol

o f H2 O2 would be removed in

148

100 minutes. Therefore, to decompose H 2 O 2 at 60 mg/L which is equal to H 2 O 2 at 1.7 m ol/L, 0.71 mg o f catalase should be added to one liter of 60 mg/L H 2 O 2 solution. This am ount would be 0.071 m g o f catalase in 100 mL solution. However, as the detection lim it for the balance used couldn't cover this range, 0.1 mg o f catalase was used.
