ABSTRACT  
TETRASPANINS ASSOCIATED WITH oxLDL AND IgG MEDIATED PHAGOCYTOSIS IN HUMAN U937 MACROPHAGES Pardis Pakshir, Master of Science, Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2013 One of the crucial key targets in treatment of diseases are cell surface proteins, such as receptor complexes, and their associated signaling pathways. The Fc receptor is one of the most important phagocytic receptors of the cells of immune system. The ligand of the Fc gamma receptor is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which triggers the engulfment of foreign molecules coated by antibodies by a process called phagocytosis. A Specialized subset of cells including macrophages engulfs foreign particles by the Fc receptor. Another phagocytic receptor of macrophages is the CD36 receptor, which binds the ligand oxLDL and is known to be involved in the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the arteries. A few members of the Tetraspanin proteins have been found to be associated with theses receptors in macrophages. Tetraspanins may act as "molecular facilitators" grouping specific cell-surface proteins and thus increasing the formation and stability of functional signaling complexes. There is a significant amount of research done on the receptors of the surface of macrophages, however, the proteins associated with these receptors, their potential signaling pathways and the mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood. This thesis aims to investigate the presence and potential functional role of the specific Tetraspanin isoforms in Fc and CD36 mediated phagocytosis. Silencing RNA, quantitative assays of phagocytosis, and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to test the phagocytic efficiency of macrophages in IgG and oxLDL mediated phagocytosis. Understanding the regulatory roles of Tetraspanins can provide insight into various immune diseases.

DEDICATION  
Parents sacrifice a lifetime in order to achieve their greatest success, their children's accomplishments. Every success that I have achieved can be directly traced to the sacrifices that my parents and my family have made for me. I know that no matter what I accomplish, it will never measure up to the amount of time and effort that they have spent teaching me, setting up the right circumstances and proving the right tools and environment to create my success. No matter how many times I utter the words" thank you" and "I appreciate it", it will not begin to compare to the amount of hours that they have worked in order to provide a better opportunity for achievement, it will not compare to the amount of hours they have stayed up late just to call me from the other side of the planet to wish me luck on the eve of my exams. No matter how many thank you notes I write, I know it will not compare to the amount of worry that have lived through, when I have been sick so far away from them. I know the only way I will ever be able to come close to ensuring that I have earned the opportunity that they have provided for me, is that I must accomplish more than I have, go further than I have and continue on to my dying days; to live every moment of my life, making the most of every minute of every day. I have stood on the shoulders of my family, and they have been the support and the backbone of my success, and I know I have one single task and one single responsibility that I must accomplish. That one single task is to earn it. I would like to dedicate this thesis to my loving parents Mohammad Reza and Mojgan and my dear beautiful sister Paniz, whose words of encouragement and push for determination has been a source of motivation and inspiration throughout my life. I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.

INTRODUCTION:

Background    
The immune system defends the body against infectious organisms and foreign invaders that can cause various diseases. The immune system is composed of two branches; innate and adaptive immunity. The adaptive immune system is comprised of memory cells such as T lymphocytes and antibody producing B lymphocytes which have receptors that are able to recognize pathogens. The adaptive immune system produces antibodies in response to antigens belonging to a pathogen that has previously infected the body. The innate immune system is the first line of defense in the body and it consists of cells and proteins that fight microbes or invaders at the site of infection. Cells such as macrophages are able to recognize pathogens, internalize and destroy them. One of the receptors of macrophages is Fc receptor that is the most important phagocytic receptor of the cells of immune system. Fc receptors are involved in antigen recognition and contribute to the protective functions of the immune system. Fc receptors bind to the Fc portion of Immunoglobulin g (IgG). The cells of the adaptive immune system guide the innate immune system by the presenting antibodies that are recognized by the Fc receptor. Therefore, the Fc receptor connects the adaptive and innate responses (Florentinus et al., 2011). Another phagocytic receptor of the macrophages is CD36, which is a class B scavenger receptor and is known for its capacity to internalize modified low-density lipoproteins (LDL). The uptake of modified lipoproteins by the macrophages results in the deposition of cholesterol ester within cells and the formation of foam cells (Torontoz et al., 1998). The clustering of foam cells eventually leads to the formation of plaques and to the initiation and development of atherosclerotic lesions (Hajjar et al., 1997). One of the key targets in treatments of diseases is cell surface proteins such as receptor complexes and their associated signaling pathways. A study done by Jankowski, Zhu & 1

Marshall, 2008 showed that macrophage receptor complexes can be captured from the membrane of live cells by Ligand affinity receptor chromatography (LARC). This is done by presenting the receptor's ligand on a microscopic bead and introducing it to the cells. Further studies on the cell surface receptors and the proteins that associate with them can provide insights into studies of immune responses and many human diseases.

Phagocytosis  
A Russian scientist, Elie Metchinkoff, first discovered phagocytosis 100 years ago. Phagocytosis is one of the strategies that cells have developed to internalize particles and solutes. Phagocytosis is referred to as the receptor stimulated process of engulfing particles over 0.5 Âµm in diameter (Flannagan, JaumouillÃ©, & Grinstein, 2012). Phagocytosis is a very crucial component of both the innate and acquired immune system, which is present in organisms ranging from unicellular microorganisms to higher organisms (Flannagan et al., 2012; Garcia-Gardia & Rosales, 2002). Phagocytosis helps the defense mechanism by internalization and elimination of infectious pathogens. It is known to be involved in development, tissue remodeling, the immune response, and inflammation (Garcia-Gardia & Rosales, 2002). A special division of cells of the immune system termed professional phagocytes consisting of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils perform phagocytosis to engulf and ingest pathogens at the inflammation sites. The binding of the invading pathogen by antibodies is termed opsonization, which warns the cells of the immune system of the upcoming threats. The initiation of phagocytosis is marked by the interaction of the receptors on the surface of phagocytes with their ligands. Upon interaction of the cell surface receptors with their ligands phagocytosis proceeds within, a membrane-bound vacuole, phagosome. The internalization of the pathogen requires the phagocytes to extend pseudopods to encircle the upcoming pathogen, which requires actin (Greenberg & Grinstein, 2002). Actin cytoskeleton remodeling is required at the site of receptor complexes (Aderem & Underhill, 1999). The phagocytes are also shown to provide extra endomembrane in order to accommodate the incoming particle

2

(Greenberg & Grinstein, 2002). The phagocytosis is completed once the particle is internalized and phagosome is separated from the membrane. Once the particle is internalized, the phagosome matures and eventually joins with lysosome, one of the components of the endocytic pathway, to form the phagolysosome. Phagolysosomes are very acidic and rich in hydrolases providing the required conditions to degrade the internalized pathogen (Aderem & Underhill, 1999). The binding of the ligand to the receptor leads to a specific cascade of signaling pathways that vary based on the membrane and cytoskeleton around the ligand receptor complex. The mechanism by which phagocytosis takes place is dependent on actin and is not a clathrin mediated mechanism (Aderem & Underhill, 1999). Regulating the induction of phagocytosis by macrophages might be a means of therapeutically regulating the immune system. Studying the parameters that affect phagocytic efficiency may lead to improved methods of delivery mechanisms in drug development (Pacheco, White & Sulchel, 2013).

The  Fc  gamma  receptor  
One of the known phagocytic receptors involved in antigen recognition by cells of the immune system is Fc receptor (FcR) that binds to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins. The family of Fc receptors and their ligands, the immunoglobulins, are part of the Ig superfamily (Florentinus et al., 2011; Garcia-Gardia & Rosales, 2002). The activated Fc receptor has been isolated from the surface of live cells and the members of the complex have been successfully identified (Jankowski et al., 2008). Fc receptors are expressed on many cell types of the immune system. An Fc receptor class exists for every antibody class: FcR binds IgG, FcR binds IgA, FcR binds IgE, FcR binds IgM and FcR binds IgD (Flannagan et al, 2012). Three classes of FcR have been recognized to date: FcRI, FcRII, and FcRIII. Each class of FcR consists of several individual receptor isoforms. Upon binding of the ligand to the Fc receptor a series of downstream signaling pathways are initiated. The binding of IgG coated particles to the Fc receptor causes multiple Fc receptors to aggregate in the plane of the cell membrane, which brings the cytosolic

3

domains of these receptors together (Flannagan et al., 2012). Upon receptor clustering, the cytoplasmic portion of FcR, which has a specific tyrosine residues termed ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs), gets phosphorylated by a Src tyrosine-kinase family (Flannagan et al., 2012; Swanson, 2004). The phosphorylated Tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain then become docking sites for the SH-2 domain of a tyrosine kinase, Syk. Docking of Syk triggers its phosphorylation (by Src kinases) and its activation leads to the recruitment of additional signaling proteins to the activated FcR complex (Lu et al., 2011). Syk is known to activate phosphatidylionositol 3-kinase PI3K. Syk is also known to activate phospholipase C (PLC), which cleaves the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PI (4,5) P2 to generate Inositol 1,4,5- triphosphate (InsP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG) (Flannagan et al., 2012). InsP3 releases Ca2+ from intracellular Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ stores. The presence of Calcium has been determined to be very important in regulating the phagocytosis of macrophages. Activation of both PLC and PKC requires prior activation of PI3K. DAG and calcium can then go on to activate Protein kinase C (PKC) which goes on to phosphorylate other molecules, leading to different cellular activities (Flannagan et al., 2012; Swanson, 2004; Garcia-Gardia & Rosales, 2002; Greenberg & Grinstein, 2002). The internalization of particles by Fc receptor is an actin-mediated process. Active GTPbound forms of Rac and Cdc42 are present at sites of phagosome formation during FcRmediated phagocytosis (Cox et al, 1997). Rac and Cdc2 bind Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), which binds to further adaptor proteins such as Ena/vasodilatorstimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) to activate the molecular complex Arp2/3 (Lorenzi et al, 2000). The activation of Arp2/3 complex is known to be crucial step in the polymerization of actin filaments (Garcia-Gardia & Rosales, 2002). The active forms of Cdc42 and Rac also induce an enzyme named PAK1 that can result in inhibition of actindepolymerizing factor cofilin, by phosphorylating LIM kinase (LIMK) (Edwards & Gill, 1999).

Macrophages  Scavenger  Receptors  
Macrophages have two categories of receptors, which are responsible for discriminating between different pathogens and their own cellular components. One category contains the receptors that recognize pathogens and particles coated with opsonins. The other category contains those receptors that bind ligands endogenous to the pathogen or external pathogen termed, non-opsonic receptors (Aderem & Underhill, 1999). The macrophage scavenger receptors were first discovered by Brown and Goldstein when studying the accumulation of cholesterol from low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in atherosclerotic plaques (Goldstein et al., 1979). The scavenger receptors are important components of the innate immune system since they bind many different ligands such as microbial pathogen, and host modified molecules. Scavenger receptors are found in myeloid cells and selected endothelial cells and are involved in disease such as Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis (PlÃ¼ddemann, Neyen & Gordon, 2007). The innate scavenger receptors are divided into 8 classes (Classes A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H) based on their structure homology. Class A consists of SR-AI, SR-AII, MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure), SCARA-5 (scavenger receptor A5) and SRCL-I/II (PlÃ¼ddemann et al., 2007; Elomaa et al., 1995; Jian et al., 2006). Class B consists of CD36 and SR/B1. Class C encompasses Drosophila melanogaster scavenger receptor dSR-CI. Class D contains CD68 and Class E contains LOX-1. SREC, SR-PSOX and FEEL1 belong to classes F, G and H respectively (PlÃ¼ddemann et al., 2007). Class B scavenger receptors particularly CD36 is one of the focuses of this research because of its ability to uptake modified low density lipoproteins and its contribution to the initiation and development of atherosclerosis as discussed further in the introduction.

Oxidized  low-density  Lipoprotein  
Lipoproteins are particles composed of lipids and proteins held together by non-covalent forces. Lipoproteins are categorized based on their density, size and protein composition. Lipoproteins fall into one of the following categories: chylomicrons, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Segrest et al., 2001). Low-density lipoprotein is the carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream and its function is to supply various tissues with adequate levels of cholesterol at all times (Prassl & Laggner, 2008). LDL is highly heterogeneous, differing in size, density and shapes. The average size of the LDL particles is 18 to 25 nm and they are globular in shape (Prassl & Laggner, 2008). The core of the LDL particle is composed of Triglycerides and esterified cholesterol and is confined by a phospholipid membrane, which has a single copy of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100). A Schematic representation of a generic LDL particle is shown in Figure 1 (Murtola et al., 2011).

High levels of LDL accumulating in the arterial walls are associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases. The plaque formation on the wall of vessels can 6

lead to the narrowing of arteries, rupture, clotting, and ultimately death (Murtola et al., 2011). Low-density lipoprotein can be modified by chemicals and enzymes. Some of these modifications include oxidation, acetylation, enzymatic degradation and lipolysis (Prassl & Laggner, 2008). Native LDL cannot lead to the formation of foam cells because its uptake by LDL receptors of macrophages is very slow and its receptor down regulates its uptake (Steinberg, 2002). High levels of cholesterol down regulate the LDL receptor on the surface of macrophages through the mechanism of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcriptional factors responsible for regulating genes involved in cholesterol production and uptake (Horton et al., 2002; Yoshida & Kisgui, 2010; Kim et al., 1996; Brown & Goldstein, 1977). The contribution of native LDL to the formation of foam cells is by modifications to its structure such as oxidation, which makes it recognizable by the scavenger receptors of the macrophages (Horton et al., 2002). The cellular uptake of modified LDL is done by scavenger receptors of classes B/E. The uptake of LDL is dependent on its structure and the proper conformational orientation of the Apolipoprotein B 100 located on the surface of the particle. Therefore, the size and shape are two important factors of the physiological functions of LDL (Prassl & Laggner, 2008). The damaged endothelial cells of the walls of arteries recruit macrophages at the site of inflammation in the presence of high levels of LDL. An inflammatory stimulus causes endothelial cells (EC) and macrophages to produce oxidative products. These oxidative products can cause the conversion of LDL into oxidized LDL (Febbraio et al., 2001). LDL can be oxidized enzymatically or non-enzymatically. LDL is known to be oxidized in two stages. At the first stage, LDL is partially oxidized by minor oxidations of apolipoprotein B100. This modification is named minimally oxidized LDL, which still has the ability to bind the LDL receptor (Yoshida & Kisugi, 2010). However, further oxidation of LDL leads to oxidized LDL, which is now recognized by the scavenger receptors (Yoshida & Kisugi, 2010). Free radicals, metal ions such as iron and copper and oxidative agents, produced by the inflammatory stimulation of endothelial cells (EC) and macrophages, such as nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species can lead to 7

oxidation of LDL. Oxidative enzymes such as Lipoxygenase and Myeloperoxidase can also oxidize LDL (Yoshida & Kisugi, 2010). oxLDL is recognized and internalized by CD36 scavenger receptors as ligands. The mechanism by which oxLDL up-regulates CD36 involves activation of the transcription factor, PPAR (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-) (Nicholson et al., 2011). PPAR is an important regulator of the expression of CD36 (Nagy et al., 1998; Febbraio et al., 2001). Upon internalization of oxLDL by the CD36 receptor, the PPAR transcriptional factor is produced and transferred to the nucleus resulting in production of PPAR itself and binding to the promoter of CD36 gene, increasing its expression (Torontoz et al., 1998; Febbraio et al., 2001). The thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic drugs is recognized as ligand for PPAR and thus can result in increased CD36 expression (Torontoz & Nagy, 1999). The increase in the expression of CD36, results in a positive feedback loop. The more CD36 receptors on the surface of macrophages mean more uptake of oxLDL, which can cause the accumulation of cholesterol ester by macrophages resulting in the formation of foam cells (Febbraio et al., 2001). The foam cells tend to form clusters and are known to have low mobility, large vacuolated shapes and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Bobryshev, 2006). The foam cells represent monocyte/macrophages that have taken up modified forms of lipoproteins rather than the native LDL (Boullier et al., 2013). oxLDL is composed of two components, the lipid and the protein (apoB) parts. The two components of the oxLDL have been shown to compete with each other to bind to a common ligand-binding site of macrophage scavenger receptors. An 80% inhibition of intact oxLDL internalization has been recorded in the presence of lipid and protein moieties of oxLDL (Boullier et al., 2103). The oxidized phospholipids of the oxLDL have been shown to significantly contribute to binding of the oxLDL to the scavenger receptor (Boullier et al., 2103).

CD36  structure    
CD36 receptor is another receptor of interest in this study. CD36 is an 88-kDa (mass with glycosylations) transmembrane glycoprotein and is expressed on macrophages as well as platelets, adipocytes and some epithelial and endothelial cells (Hajjar et al., 1997: PlÃ¼ddemann et al, 2007; Terpstra et al., 2000). It is well established that CD36 is involved in many pathways such as cardiovascular diseases, parasitology, cancer biology, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, diabetes and many more (Silverstein and Febberaio, 2007). CD36 receptors along with SR/B1 are the two members of class B scavenger receptors which are known to form dimers and multimers (PlÃ¼ddemann et al, 2007). CD36 receptor binds a variety of ligands such as anionic phospholipids, apoptotic cells, fatty acids and thrombospondin (Rigotti et al., 1995; Ren et al., 1995; Nicholson et al., 2011). The CD36 receptors are linked to the uptake of apoptotic bodies by recognizing the phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells (Savil et al, 1991; Fadok et al, 1998; Febbraio & Silverstain, 2007). One of the most studied ligands of the CD36 receptor is oxLDL. The accumulation of oxLDL leads to an increase in the production of CD36, which is linked to foam cell development in atherosclerosis (Hajjar et al., 1997). It is not only the CD36 receptor that can internalize oxLDL, but also SRA-1, SRA-2, SRA-3, MARCO, CD36, SR-B1, CD68/ macrosialin, and LOX-1 receptors are known to uptake oxLDL (Witztum et al., 1991). The first ligand to be discovered for scavenger receptors was acetylated LDL which is not produced under normal physiological conditions, and the natural ligand was not known until it was shown that oxidized LDL is the ligand for these receptors (Kodama, et al., 1988; Rohrer et al., 1990; Parthasarathy et al., 1986). CD36 is also involved in negatively regulating angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells by its ability to be the receptor for thrombospondin-1 (Silverstein & Febbraio, 2009; Silverstein et al., 1992; Asch et al., 1987). In a study done by Hajjar et al (1997) murine macrophage cell lines incubated with acetylated low-density lipoprotein for 2 hours and oxidized low-density lipoprotein for 4 hours exhibited an increase in the level of CD36 expression. The level of expression of

9

CD36 is dependent on multiple factors such as the presence of cytokines and growth factors as well as differentiation level of macrophages (Hajjar et al., 1997). Subjects with macrophages that lack CD36 display less efficient uptake of oxLDL compared to the subject with normal macrophages. This study highlights the importance of CD36 in the internalization of oxLDL (Boullier et al., 2000; Nozaki et al., 1995). In a study done by Endemann et al (1993) the blockage of CD36 binding sites with antibodies such as OKM5, was followed by less internalization of oxLDL in PMA treated monocyte cell line (THP-1) (Endemann et al., 1993). It is widely thought that CD36 is regulated by its own ligand oxLDL. This was shown in a study where cells incubated in medium containing oxLDL showed higher levels of CD36 compared to cells incubated in medium only (Nakagawa et al., 1998). Structure of CD36 The structure of the CD36 receptor consists of two short intracellular domains, which are 5-7 and 11-13 amino acids respectively. It also has an extracellular loop (84 to 204 amino acids) with multiple glycosylation sites, six conserved Cysteine residues, giving rise to three disulfide bridges (Cys243- Cys311, Cys272-Cys333, and Cys313-Cys322), and two ligand binding sites (Silverstein & Febbraio, 2009 ; Rac et al., 2007; Febbraio et al., 2001). The structure of CD36 receptor is shown in Figure 2. The extracellular loop is the location where the binding of the ligands takes place (Puente Navazo et al., 1996). The glycosylation of the CD36 receptor on the extracellular loop gives the protein protection from proteases such as lysosome at the sites of inflammation or tissue damage (Febbraio et al., 2001). There are two binding domains in the extracellular loop of CD36 receptor as shown in Figure 2, one is for binding proteins that contain thrombospondin repeat (TSR) domains and the other ligand-binding site is for oxidized lipids (Silverstein & Febbraio, 2009; PlÃ¼ddemann et al, 2007; Rac et al., 2007; Febbraio et al., 2001). The C and N terminal tails of the receptor contain palmitoylation sites. The C terminal tail of CD36 receptor is important in downstream signaling pathways and is involved in the uptake of the oxLDL (Hajjar et al., 1997: PlÃ¼ddemann et al, 2007).

Localization of CD36 in the plasma membrane CD36 is located in specialized cholesterol-rich membrane micro-domains of macrophages, therefore, this localization may suggest interactions between this receptor and members of Tetraspanin family as well as integrins as shown in Figure 3. In addition, the presence of the receptor on the surface of macrophages and monocytes signifies its role in phagocytosis and inflammatory responses (Silverstein & Febbraio, 2009 ; Sabill & Hogg, 1992).

Figure 3. Interaction of CD36 with Tetraspanins and Integrins in specific cell membrane microdomains. Adapted from Silverstein et al., 2009.

There is evidence of Tetraspanins interacting with scavenger receptor. A study done by Bartosch et al (2003) showed that Hepatitis C virus entry into the cells requires a coreceptor complex consisting of Tetraspanin CD81 and SR-B1 class B Scavenger Receptor. CD36 physically associates with Tetraspanin CD9 and 31 and 61 integrins in C32 melanoma cells through its extracellular domain (Thorne et al., 2000). On the surface of platelets scavenger receptor CD36 is known to form association with Tetraspanin CD9 and integrins llb3 and 6 to form a membrane complex (Miao et al., 2001).

CD36  signaling  
The immediate events following the uptake of oxLDL by CD36 are poorly understood. Most of the research has been done at the transcriptional levels and signaling pathways that either up regulate or down regulate the receptor. The ligand of the CD36 receptor binds to and is internalized by signaling pathways that are not very well understood, however it is known that Src-family kinases, Jnk and Rho family GTPases are some of the key players in the internalization of the ligands of CD36 (Heit et al., 2013). oxLDL particles are internalized through a lipid raft pathway that is different from the clathrinmediated or caveolin internalization pathways (Zeng et al., 2003). CD36 is shown to cluster upon binding of oxLDL, which initiates downstream signaling events. A study done by Collins et al (2009) showed that CD36 internalization is an actin dependent process and requires the activation of Src family kinases as well as Rac and cdc42. Different choices of experimental systems may explain why different studies propose different mechanism for the early events followed by the binding of oxLDL to its receptor (Collins et al., 2009). It is widely thought that CD36 uptakes its ligands by two possible mechanisms. One is the pathway that leads to the internalization of lipids from oxLDL that activate nuclear receptors such as PPAR and the other is the common signaling cascade generated upon ligand binding (Nicholson et al, 2011). Upon oxLDL binding, the changes in the transcriptional factors lead to the up-regulation of the CD36 gene. The transcriptional factor PPAR joins the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and the PPAR:RXR to form a complex that binds to the elements on the promoter of the CD36 gene. The binding of this complex to the CD36 gene results in an increase in CD36 expression (Rahaman et al., 2006; Collot-Teizeira et al., 2007). A study done by Rahaman et al (2006) showed that when oxLDL is bound to its receptor CD36, MAP kinases JNK-1 and JNK-2 were phosphorylated and activated. The carboxyl terminal intracellular domain of the C36 receptor is the site where signaling molecules or adaptor proteins are diverted to their functions (Rahaman et al., 2006; Shaw et al., 1990). Src-family Lyn was also shown to be a part of the pathway that leads to the internalization of oxLDL as blocking the Src-kinase stopped foam cell generation (Rahaman et al., 2006). 13

It is now known that kinases such as JNK are required for raft-mediated internalization of particles, therefore it can be thought that JNK is a key player in the uptake of oxLDL by CD36 (Rahaman et al., 2006; Pelkmans et al., 2005). Protein kinase C (PKC) is also known to be involved in the activation of the PPAR transcription factor therefore, can be linked to CD36 uptake of its ligand (Eng et al., 2000; Zibara et al., 2000). Moreover, Protein Kinase B is linked to CD36 signaling by its ability to up-regulate the CD36 by stimulating the CD36 promoter as well as a PPARgamma element-driven reporter gene (Munteanu et al., 2006). The over-expression of PKB can result in an increase in CD36 expression in macrophages. Thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic drugs is also known to be another regulator of CD36 receptor by regulating PPAR (Torontoz et al., 1998). The CD36 receptor signals by association with co-receptors and accessory molecules that vary for different ligands (Heit et al., 2013). A study done by Heit et al (2013) shows that CD36 receptor complex contains molecules such as 1 and 2 integrins, Tetraspanin CD9 and CD81, which are known to link CD36 to immune receptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) cytoplasmic portion of Fc gamma receptor. The coupling of CD36 to the ITAM results in the internalization of CD36's ligands via Src and Syk kinases (Heit et al., 2013). This study suggests a functional association between the CD36 receptor and FcR, by showing that CD36 relies on FcR to internalize its ligands. CD36 expression is improved in reaction to cytokine IL-4 and oxLDL by a mechanism involving Protein Kinase C and PPAR-gamma (Feng et al., 2000). Transforming growth factor (TGF1/2) can also modify the induction levels of CD36 by activating MAP kinase and inactivating PPAR transcriptional factor in PMA differentiated THP-1 macrophages (Han et al., 2000; Acton et al., 1996).

Atherosclerosis  and  The  role  of  CD36  in  Atherosclerosis  
Atherosclerosis is a condition where the arteries become thickened and hardened. The thickening can lead to the narrowing of the vessels, which is partly due to the build up of plaques (Collot-Teizeira et al., 2007). The blood vessels affected by the thickening and reduced blood supply include the aorta, coronary, carotid and cerebral arteries (Eij et al., 2006). The atherosclerotic plaques (atheroma) are formed from the macrophage-derived foam cells (Eij et al., 2006). Atherosclerosis is one of the leading causes of death in industrialized countries. Individuals with high blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, inactive lifestyles and smokers are at the highest risks to develop atherosclerosis. These risks can contribute to the initiation and progress of the lesions by disrupting lipid regulatory and inflammatory pathways (Eij et al., 2006). At the first stage of development of Atherosclerosis, the dysfunctional endothelial cells (EC) engage the monocytes from the blood stream by activated adhesion molecules and cytokines (Collot-Teizeira et al., 2007). The CD36 receptor is linked to the atherosclerotic lesion development by its ability to uptake oxLDL by macrophages that are later differentiated into foam cells (Collot-Teizeira et al., 2007). Due to the important role of CD36 in atherogenisis, it is critical to study the factors that may influence its expression in macrophages, to present the development of atherosclerosis in the arterial walls (Nakagawa et al., 1998). oxLDL uptake leads to the generation of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF/, IL-1 , IL-6, and interferon beta and gamma (IFN/). The level of these cytokines are significantly reduced in the absence of CD36 from macrophages (Janabi et al., 2000). Dual knockdown of CD36 and scavenger receptor A I/II (SRA) in mice show 75%-90% decrease in lipoprotein uptake and degradation. This strain of mice was obtained by intercrossing mice that lack SR-A or CD36, producing animals lacking both receptors. The knockout of both CD36 and SRA results in no better protection from murine atherosclerotic lesion development than absence of CD36 alone. These findings support the commonly accepted hypothesis that CD36 plays a major role in the pathology of atherosclerosis and its blockage can be protective in the atherosclerotic lesion development (Febbraio et al., 2000; Kunjathoor et al., 2002; Kuchibhotla et al., 2008).

15

Modulation of scavenger receptors by lipids may potentially impact on the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages during atherosclerosis (Han et al., 1997).

Tetraspanins  
A few members of Tetraspanin protein family were among the proteins that were found to be associated with the receptors of macrophages. This thesis will investigate six isoforms of the Tetraspanin family. Tetraspanins are a broadly expressed superfamily of trans-membrane hydrophobic proteins with over 30 members found in humans and with homologues conserved through distantly related species (Table 1). Tetraspanins are present a variety of organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, fungi, plants and vertebrates (Yanez et al., 2009). The tissue distribution of this Tetraspanins is heterogeneous. Although Tetraspanins are very abundant and are found in the membranes of a variety of cells, their individual functions are not very well known. The function of Tetraspanins is still under investigation; however, their key function seems to be in the formation of large membrane micro-domains (also termed the Tetraspanin web or TEMs). By the formation of these membrane domains, Tetraspanins provide a platform for other members of the cell membrane to interact (Yunta & Lazo, 2003). The association of cell membrane components is crucial in the function of cell membrane of eukaryotic cells (Espenel et al., 2008). Tetraspanins are known to be involved in a variety of events including cellular signaling, migration, adhesion, fusion, cytoskeletal reorganization, and proliferation (Martin et al., 2005).

Structural features of Tetraspanins: This study aims to investigate the possible functional role of Tetraspanins in phagocytosis mediated by receptors of macrophages. Therefore, understanding the structure of the proteins of this family can be very helpful. Tetraspanins cross the cell membrane four times creating four transmembrane domains with two extra-cytoplasmic regions of unequal sizes, a small extracellular loop (EC1) containing 20 Â­ 28 amino acids and a large extracellular loop (EC2) containing 76 Â­ 131 amino acids flanked by short N and C terminal cytoplasmic tails (Figure 4) (Helmer, 2005). The large extracellular loop has two parts, one is the conserved region containing three alpha helices A, B and E and a variable region (Helmer, 2005). The variable region of the EC2 contains a conserved CCG motif and two other conserved cysteine residues that form the two intra-molecular disulphide bonds as shown in figure 4. Some Tetraspanins have two additional cysteine residues giving rise to an extra disuphide bond (Helmer, 2005).

18

Intracellular and the juxtamembrane regions of Tetraspanins contain several conserved palmitolation sites. (Yanez et al, 2009). Palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, to cysteine and less frequently to serine and threonine residues of proteins, which are usually membrane proteins. Palmitoylation of cysteine residues has a significant effect on the function of the members of Tetraspanin family. Palmitoylation has been shown to be involved in the formation of associations between Tetraspanins and their partners as well as regulation of interactions with lipid rafts. (Charrin et al., 2002). The palmitoylation of CD9 for instance contributes to the interaction with other Tetraspanins, and in particular to the higher stability of the CD9/CD81 interaction (Charrin et al., 2002). The size of the protein core of all Tetraspanins is 20-50 kDa (Helmer, 2003; Yunta & Lazo, 2003). Tetraspanins act primarily as novel adapter proteins to facilitate the interaction of associated molecules in the Tetraspanin web since they do not have intrinsic enzymatic activity and signaling motifs in their structure (Martin et al., 2005).

19

Tetraspanin web: The large extracellular loop (EC2 region) imparts specificity and allows the identification of a protein as a member of this family. Tetraspanins can also be grouped based on the structure of the large extracellular loop. The EC2 region is the site where the interaction of Tetraspanin with non-Tetraspanin partners takes place (Yunta & Lazo, 2003). The most studied interactions of Tetraspanins are known to occur between different members of the family (Tarrant et al, 2003). An example of interaction between members of Tetraspanin family is the interaction of CD9 and CD51 in human endothelial cells (Barreiro et al., 2008; Levy & Shoham, 2005). Tetraspanins interact with other types of proteins such as integrins, membrane receptors, and intracellular signaling molecules as well as with other Tetraspanins, thus forming a large complex, which can be combined with other Tetraspanin complexes to act as a membrane micro-domain (Boucheix & Rubinstein, 2001). There are 840 possible ways in which Tetraspanins can interact with other Tetraspanins and with the associated proteins (Tarrant et al, 2003). The flexibility of members of this family to make associations with other proteins and molecules enables them to take part in many different biological roles. One of the roles of Tetraspanins appears to be modifying signals initiated by membrane receptors, by directly or indirectly affecting the intracellular signaling (Berditchevski, 2001). Both lipid rafts and TEM provide platforms for interaction of various cell membrane proteins; however, they are structurally different. The lipid rafts are disintegrated following cholesterol reduction while TEM are more resistant to the absence of cholesterol (Charrin et al, 2003; Yanez et al., 2009; Espenel et al., 2008). Another structural difference between these two is the absence of lipid raft proteins such as GPIanchored proteins and caveolin in TEM (Yanez et al., 2009). Architecture of Tetraspanin domain: TEMs are known to be very dynamic structures and are constructed from a series of interactions (Martin et al., 2005). The primary interactions, facilitated by the large

20

extracellular loop, involve direct interaction of Tetraspanins and their partners. The secondary interactions include Tetraspanin-Tetraspanin interactions that enable indirect interaction of primary Tetraspanin complexes. The secondary interactions are done via trans-membrane and/or intracellular regions (Martin et al., 2005; Min, Wang, Sun & Kong, 2006). Tertiary interactions are the weakest complexes and involve the interactions between secondary complexes leading to large signaling domains (Martin et al., 2005). Tetraspanins are known to be involved in many diseases. For instance, X-linked mental retardation is linked to a mutation of Tetraspanins TM4SF2, also called TALLA-1 (Zemni et al., 2000). The absence of Tetraspanin CD9 in the cells of prostate cancer is known to lead to the increased level of progression of this type of cancer (Wang et al., 2007). Studies have linked Tetraspanins to viral infections (Martin et al., 2005). For instance, CD151 is known to up-regulate HTLV-1 (Human T-cell Lymphotropic virus) infection and is also expressed in colon and lung cancers (Ashman, L et al., 1997; Sincokc et al., 1997). Members of Tetraspanin are known to play roles in immunity. For example, CD19CD81-CD21 complexes are known to play a major role during B cell stimulation. The absence of all 3 types (CD19, CD81 and CD21) in mice show having defective antibody responses to the same type of T cellÂ­dependent antigen (Maecker & Levy 1997; Rickert et al. 1995) A Study by Kaji et al. (2001) showed that mouse Tetraspanin CD9 is functionally associated with Fc gamma receptors and it is able to regulate signals for phagocytosis and inflammatory responses. In this study, rat anti-CD9 mAb induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as Syk as well as cell accumulation, which suggests that CD9 interaction with FcR is required for Fc receptor's proper functioning. Tetraspanin CD82 is involved in the activation of human monocyte cell line U937 (Lebel-Binay, Lagaudriere, Fradelizi & Conjeaud, 1995). It is shown that the association of Fc receptor and CD82 results in an increase in intracellular calcium levels (Lebel-Binay et al., 1995). Another evidence of involvement of Tetraspanins in regulating the fc receptors is the study done by Felming et al, (1997), which suggests that Tetraspanins CD81 negatively

21

regulates FceRI by the demonstration that antibody against CD81 could inhibit signaling through the FceRI. A major feature of the members of the Tetraspanin family in vivo is a certain degree of functional redundancy in their functions. A study done by Wright, Moseley and Vanspriel (2004) shows a similar effect of knockouts of CD151, CD81, and CD37 in a particular cell line, suggesting that tetraspanins can either compensate for the absence of the members of the family or they have a very high degree of functional similarities. Another evidence for this hypothesis is the study done by Kaji, Miyazaki and Kudo (2002) which shows that when CD9, responsible for infertility of mice females is knocked out, CD81 expression can compensate for the deficiencies in sperm-egg fusion.

22

RATIONAL  AND  CENTRAL  HYPOTHESIS  
The effect of many proteins at the cell surface receptor complexes as activators or inhibitors and their possible involvement in the downstream signaling pathways are not very well understood. I hypothesize that if Tetraspanins are required for the function of innate immune receptors, then Tetraspanins should be specifically detected with receptors by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, Tetraspanins should be required for the receptors function and could be tested by silencing RNA. Confocal microscopy, silencing RNA and quantifying assays of phagocytosis are performed to study the possible functional role of Tetraspanins in the oxLDL and IgG mediated phagocytosis. Understanding the regulatory roles of Tetraspanins can provide insight into various immune diseases.

The carefully isolated proteins associated with the macrophage receptors were determined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LCÂ­MS/MS) (Jankowski et al., 2008). The MS/MS data were then searched against a non-redundant library of proteins using SEQUEST. A Manual examination of the proteins and peptides identified by LARC along with the controls was then performed to ensure that the proteins detected by mass spectrometry were specifically associated with the Fc receptorÂ­ ligand complex. This was done to eliminate false positives. The proteins were compared with the control beads incubated with crude lysates or growth medium. In order to study the role of and to confirm that proteins identified by LARC were truly associated with the macrophages receptor complexes of U937 cells, confocal microscopy, silencing RNA and quantifying assays of phagocytosis were performed.

Silencing  RNA  transfection  
U937 cells were seeded onto (2.5cm) sterile microscope cover slips and placed in (3.5 cm diameter) 6-well plates. U937 cells were plated to approximately 25% confluency in the 6 well plates and were grown for 72 h before removing the old medium and replacing it with new 10% FBS RPMI medium. PMA was added to a final concentration of 100 nM per well in order for monocytes to differentiate. PMA results in the differentiation of monocytes through activation of protein kinase C (Yoshimi et al., 1986). PMA treated cells were then transfected by short interfering double-stranded RNA (siRNA) using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent siRNA was diluted with serumfree medium. The siRNAs against Tetraspanin proteins were also diluted with the serum free medium. The two dilutions were then mixed and incubated for 15 to 20 min. Following the incubation time, the transfection reagent-siRNA complex was added to

25

PMA treated cells. The cells were then incubated with the complex for 72 hr. In the transfection experiment, scrambled siRNA was used as the negative control while no treatment was used for the positive control.

Bead  internalization  assay  
Following the siRNA transfection experiment, the phagocytosis assay was performed in order to quantify the phagocytic activity of the cells. The cells were incubated with oxLDL and IgG coated micro-beads and examined by florescent microscopy. o Preparation  of  ligand  coated  micro-beads   1 mg of human IgG was dissolved in 1 ml of water. In each well, 1 Âµl of 2 Âµm polystyrene beads (Bangs Labratories Inc, Fisher, IN, USA), from a 10% (v/v) suspension stock of approximately 2.185-E10 microbeads per milliliter, was dispersed in 400 Âµl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 2 Âµl of the IgG solution for 30 min. For the oxLDL assay, 2 Âµl of oxLDL was added to 400 Âµl of PBS and incubated with 1 Âµl of beads per well. The IgG-bead and oxLDL-bead complexes were then washed with 500 Âµl PBS three times to remove any unbound beads followed each time by pelleting beads in a micro-centrifuge at 14,000 RMP. The oxLDL and IgG bead complexes were then re-suspended in 200 Âµl PBS and added to the 6-well plate dishes.

o Fixing  and  blocking  of  the  cells   The cover slips were then washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Fixing was terminated by adding PBS with 5% Glycine followed by blocking using PBS with 5% skim milk powder and 1% donkey serum.

o Antibody  staining  of  cells   The cover-slips exposed to oxLDL-coated beads were then incubated with anti-oxidized human lipoprotein antibody (1:25) for 30 min followed by secondary cy5-conjugated donkey anti rabbit antibody (1:10,000 -1:20,000) for 30 min in dark. Cover-slips exposed to IgG-bead complexes were incubated with cy5-conjugated donkey anti human antibody 26

(1:10,000 -1:20,000) for 30 min in dark. Cover-slips in both cases were then washed three times with PBS and mounted on microscopic slides with fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, Carpentaria, CA, USA). The internalization of oxLDL-coated microspheres was studied in two additional buffers. After the cells were grown in RPMI media for 72 hr, as discussed above, they were incubated with oxLDL-bead complexes in Hepes buffer for 2 and 4 hr, and in RPMI medium without fetal bovine serum for 4 hr. This step was then followed by the aforementioned fixing and blocking methods.

Confocal  Microscopy  Imaging  
Images of cells binding ligand-coated beads were recorded on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope with Ar 488-nm and He/Ne 543-nm lasers with 40x objective lens and analyzed using Zeiss LSM Image Browser. The beads were then counted using Image J software where the number of the outside beads as well as the total number of beads for each cell was recorded on excel sheet. The number of beads inside the cells was calculated by subtracting the number of beads outside the cell from the total number of beads. The phagocytosis efficiency of the cells was then calculated by dividing the number of inside beads by the total number of beads.

Immunofluorescent  Staining  
Permeabilized and non permeabilized U937-PMA treated cells were stained with Mouse anti-human CD63 to confirm the localization of tetraspanin CD63. Cells were seeded onto 2.5 cm cover-slips as mentioned above and incubated with oxLDL and IgG coated beads for 4 and 2 hr respectively. Cells were the fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature (RT) for 20 min, blocked with 1% donkey serum for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton at RT for 30. The cells were incubated with antioxidized human lipoprotein antibody followed by cy5 conjugated Donkey anti-rabbit for oxLDL coverslips and with cy5-conjugated donkey anti human antibody for IgG

27

coverslips in order to visualize the outside beads. The cells were then incubated with primary mAb mentioned above for 1 h at 1:25 concentration, followed by staining with a secondary antibody at 1:1000 concentration in dark for 1 hr. As a control, permeabilized and non permeabilized U937 cells were incubated with secondary antibody alone. After each antibody incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS. The coverslips were washed five times at the end before affixing them to microscopic slides with mounting medium. For immunofluorescent analysis, the cells were examined with Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope.

RESULTS    
Manual inspection of Tetraspanin proteins identified by LARC along with the controls was performed in order to select the potential candidates that are involved with the uptake of oxLDL and IgG from this family. Following careful considerations, Tetraspanins 2,3,6,8,10 and 31 were selected from the list of all proteins detected by mass spectrometry. Table 2 shows the Tetraspanin proteins identified by mass spectrometry with the number of peptide hits for each of the conditions. LARC targeted both CD36 and Fc receptors and the proteins associated with both receptors were identified. In the table below the Larc-oxldl column shows the number of times that the following Tetraspanins were identified when oxLDL coated beads were incubated with U937 cells. The column named Larc-oxldl-media beads shows the number of times the proteins were seen in the media in which the oxldl-coated beads were incubated with the cells. The column Larc-oxldlcontrol shows the number of times that the mentioned proteins are seen in oxLDL coatedbeads applied to crude homogenates. The Larc-IgG column represents the proteins seen when IgG-coated beads were incubated with live cells. Larc-IgG control shows the proteins seen in IgG-coated beads incubated with crude homogenates. Larc-untreated beads shows the number of times the proteins were seen when cells were incubated with untreated beads. The Larc-uncoated beads extract shows uncoated beads incubated in the crude homogenates. The proteins with the high number of hits in the LARC IgG and LARC oxLDL compared to the controls were picked as potential candidates for this study.

Each bar represents the mean of the phagocytic efficiency of the cells (n=300 cells for each treatment). Cells were differentiated for 3 days with 100nM PMA, transfected with siRNA against Tetraspanins 2,3,6,8,10 and 31, and incubated with IgG-coated beads in growth media with 10% FBS for 2 hr. Scrambled siRNA served as a control in the transfection experiments along with cells with no treatment. Cells were then fixed and blocked and stained with cy5-conjugated donkey anti IgG antibody. Following confocal microscopy imaging, the quantification of the beads was then performed by counting the outside and total number of beads using Image J software. The number of internalized beads was counted for each cell and divided by the total number of beads for that cell to obtain the phagocytic efficiency. The average of phagocytic efficiency of each treatment was calculated and used to plot this figure.

The quantification of the beads was then performed by counting the outside and total number of beads using Image J software.

o oxLDL-coated  beads  internalization  assay  in  different  incubation  buffers   Silencing RNA transfection of U937 cells against Tetraspanins 2,3,6,8,10 and 31 were also done to study the internalization of oxLDL by macrophages. In order to study the role of Tetraspanins in oxLDL-mediated phagocytosis, silencing RNA was used against tetraspanins 2,3,6,8,10 and 31. A total of four independent experiments were done. The internalization of oxLDL-coated microspheres was studied in four different conditions as shown in Figure 8. After the cells were grown in RPMI media for 72 hr, as discussed previously, they were incubated with oxLDL-bead complexes in growth media for 4 hr, in Hepes buffer for 2 and 4 hr, and in RPMI medium without fetal bovine serum for 4 hr.

Therefore, another experiment was done on oxLDL-mediated phagocytosis of U937 cells transected against Tetraspanins 2,6,10 and 31 in Hepes buffer for 4 hrs (Appendix K, L ,I). The knock down of the Tetraspanins showed a significant effect on the phagocytosis efficiency of cells.

Discussion  
  
Mass spectrometry  sensitivity  and  specificity
Ligand Affinity Receptor Chromatography (LARC) may be used to successfully capture receptor complexes from the surface of live cells and to provide the detailed identification of receptor complex members by LCÂ­MS/MS. By the LARC method many components of the cellular pathways associated with the phagocytic receptors of macrophages can be directly analyzed by mass spectrometry. Controls for non-specific binding from the homogenate or the media are crucially required to interpret the LARC experiment. Certain Tetraspanin proteins were detected in the receptor ligands with much greater frequency than from the beads incubated with crude homogenate. From this observation we conclude that Tetraspanins may be specifically associated with the oxLDL receptor complex. Thus the significant correlation scores, and the presence of at least three different tryptic peptides together with the comparison to control experiments for non-specific binding, minimized the possibility of false positive acceptance of Tetraspanin proteins. Analysis of the proteins identified by mass spectrometry by LARC shows the association of members of Tetraspanin family with the receptors responsible for uptake of IgG and oxLDL. We conclude that tetraspanins 2,3,6,8,10 and 31 were among the proteins detected by LARC to be specifically associated with macrophages receptors. Hence the biophysical method of mass spectrometry detected the specific presence of Tetraspanins at the activated phagocytic receptor complex. U937 cells line was used in the analysis of this thesis because the same line was used in the LARC experiment and there is a significant amount of studies done on this cell line.

Biochemical  confirmations  
The independent biochemical techniques of siRNA and immunological staining were performed to confirm the presence of Tetraspanins in the macrophages receptor complexes.

o Role  of  Tetraspanins  in  IgG  mediated  phagocytosis     Silencing RNA experiments may demonstrate a possible functional requirement for Tetraspanins in phagocytic receptors of macrophages. The Fc receptor is one of the very well studied phagocytic receptors of the immune system. It is known to bind the Fc region of Immunoglobulin G. The binding of the Fc receptor to its ligand initiates a series of receptor clustering and downstream signaling pathways. A functional role for Tetraspanins 2,3,6,8,10 and 31 in the Fc receptor complex was tested using siRNA experiments. These Tetraspanins were among the proteins detected by LARC to be associated with the Fc receptor. Analysis of the results obtained from the experiments on the IgG-mediated phagocytosis of U937 cells showed that the knock down of Tetraspanin 31 has a significant effect (F=11.38, Pr < 0.0001) on the internalization of IgG coated beads by U937 cells. PMA treated U937 cells seem to be less efficient in up taking IgGcoated beads when Tetraspanin 31 is absent. Tetraspanin 31 is also known as SAS. The SAS gene is known to be amplified in human sarcomas (Jankowski et al., 1995). However, its role in immunity is currently unclear. We conclude that tetraspanin 31 might be directly or indirectly binding to the Fc receptor in the micro-domain that it forms on the surface of macrophages surrounding the activated receptor and may play a role in Fc mediated phagocytosis.

o Role  of  Tetraspanins  in  oxLDL  mediated  phagocytosis     oxLDL mediated phagocytosis by macrophages scavenger receptors was another focus of this study. CD36 is the receptor responsible for the uptake of oxLDL by macrophages that later differentiate into foam cells (Collot-Teizeira et al., 2007). The oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the arterial wall gives rise to the atherosclerotic lesion formation, partly by the uptake of oxLDL by scavenger receptors (Endemann et al., 1993). The oxLDL-mediated phagocytosis was tested under four different conditions in this study. To determine the best incubation condition, the incubation of oxLDL-coated beads with cells was done in growth media for 2hr, Hepes buffer for 2 and 4 hr and in serum free media for 4 hr. We concluded that incubation in Hepes buffer for 4 hr is the optimal condition to study the possible role of Tetraspanins in

45

oxLDL-mediated phagocytosis without the confounding effect of serum. In serum free experimental buffer the analysis of the results of siRNA experiments showed that knock down of Tetraspanins 2,6,10 and 31 has a significant effect (F=21.17, p <0.0001) on the phagocytic efficiency of U937 cells to uptake oxLDL coated beads. The use of the STRING algorithm indicated potential structural or functional interactions of scavenger receptors of macrophages with Tetraspanin 2,6,10 and 31. The individual functions of Tetraspanisn 2,6,10 and 31 are unclear and not much research has been done on these specific isoforms. However Tetraspanins are known to be involved in the endocytosis of oxLDL and may act as part of a system that adapts CD36 to the Fc receptor (Heit el a., 2013). In the Rat, Tetraspanin 2 is involved in signaling in oligodendrocytes differentiation. Tspan2 along with CD81 and an integrin protein were identified by immuneprecipitation to be expressed in developing oligodendrocytes (Birling et al., 1999; Terada et al, 2002). Tspan6 is involved in the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor-mediated immune responses, which plays a crucial role in the protection of the body from RNA virus infections (Wang et al, 2012). These receptors along with Toll like receptors (TLRs) and NOD like receptors (NLRs) are members of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system that identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Ding, 2012). Tspan6 works as an inhibitor of RLR-mediated immune signaling since the knockdown of this protein results in an increase in the level of RLR-mediate immune response (Wang et al, 2012). The multiple functions of Tetraspanins in many different receptor driven cellular processes may indicate that Tetraspanins act as generic adaptors between receptors to help stabilize receptor supramolecular complexes. However, further work will need to be done to clarify this further.

o Immunoflorescent  staining  of  Tetraspanins     Immunoflorescent staining was performed to examine the presence and distribution of Tetraspanin CD63 as a representative of Tetraspanin family. Tetraspanin CD63 also known as TSPAN30, LAMP3 and ME490 is known to be highly glycosylated and involved in many pathways. CD63 interacts with many partners such as MHC class II molecules, integrins, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and Tetraspanins like CD82 (Kuijpers et al., 1991; Duffield et al., 2007). CD63 is involved in Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells (Vischer & Wagner, 1993), and its expression elevates after activation of platelets, neutrophils and basophils (Kuijpers et al., 1991). CD63 was also shown to be involved in the activation of T cell (Hemler, 2005; Pfistershammer et al., 2004). Tetraspanin CD63 is present on secretory vesicles, late endosomes and lysosomes as well as the surface of cell membrane and it cycles between these components (Duffield et al., 2007). CD63 was found to immuneprecipitate with the gastric H,K-ATPase  subunit in parietal cells (Duffield et al., 2007). In this context CD63 acts as a helper in intracellular trafficking from the cell surface to the late endosome-lysosomal compartment in order to aid internalizing HK (Duffield et al., 2007). CD63 has 47

Tyrosine-based motifs on its C-terminus which enables it to play roles in endocytosis and lysosomal targeting by interacting with various adaptor proteins (Boucheix & Rubinstein, 2001; Robinson & Bonifacino, 2001). AP-2 and AP-3 are among the adaptor proteins that CD63 interacts with and since these two are involved in clathrin mediated endocytosis, it is hypothesized that CD63 is involved in internalization of particles associated with the membrane (Rous et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2008). Tetraspanin CD63 is known to associate with two integrins 31 and 61, which are functionally linked to the scavenger receptor CD36 in human Melanoma cells (Thorne et al., 2000). The localization of Tetraspanin CD63 was studied in both IgG and oxLDL mediated phagocytosis in u937 cells. In permeablized macrophages incubated with IgG beads, CD63 was distributed evenly throughout the cells, however not so much on the cell membrane. Non-permeablized U937 cells incubated with IgG showed a low level of expression on the cell surface. CD63 was distributed consistently across the permeablized U937 cells incubated with oxLDL beads. The non-permeablized cells incubated with oxLDL only showed exofacial localization. These results may indicate that CD63 is more abundant in macrophages when up taking oxLDL compared to IgG. The immuneflorescence staining experiment shows the presence of Tetraspanins in the phagocytic cup upon internalization of oxLDL-coated beads.

A  possible  function  of  Tetraspanins  in  the  oxLDL  and  IgG  mediated  phagocytosis  
Silencing RNA experiments coupled with an Immunoflorence staining technique identified a number of Tetraspanins as associated with the oxLDL and IgG mediated phagocytosis. According to the study done by Heit et al (2013) the CD36 receptor complex contains molecules such as 1 and 2 integrins and two members of Tetraspanin family, CD9 and CD81, which are known to link CD36 to the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) cytoplasmic portion of Fc gamma receptor. This study shows that the coupling of CD36 to the ITAM of the Fc receptor results in the internalization of CD36's ligands via Src and Syk kinases (Heit et al., 2013). In agreement with the previous work we showed here for the first time the identity of novel isoforms of tetraspanins that play apparent role in the Fc and oxLDL receptor complex formation.

Mass spectrometry shows the presence of Tetraspanins in the media in which cells are being incubated with oxLDL-coated beads. This finding may indicate that Tetraspanins are being secreted by macrophages. Tetraspanins are also shown to be highly abundant in blood peptides (Unpublished data). The confirmation of the presence of Tetraspanins in the phagocytic receptor of macrophages by three independent biochemical methods along with the presence of these proteins in the incubation media and their high abundance in blood, can lead to a novel hypothesis on the function of Tetraspanins. Tetraspanins have previously been proposed to function by diffusing laterally within the plane of cell membrane that might help adapt co-receptors or prey molecules to the phagocytic receptors (Heit et al., 2013). The abundance of secreted Tetraspanins may indicate that Tetraspanins may play a role similar in concept to ionophore or siderphores that diffuse away from macrophages to help carry prey molecules back to the phagocytic receptors on the cell surface. Thus the presence of tetraspanins in the cell mediate and blood may indicate that this complex family of receptor interaction molecules may play novel roles in phagocytosis and the innate immune response mot previously considered, although further evidences are required to establish the mechanism involved.

CONCLUSION  AND  FUTURE  OBJECTIVES  
Despite the high abundance of Tetraspanins, their individual functions have not been very well studied. Biophysical and biochemical analysis successfully showed the presence of members of Tetraspanin family at the site of the activated phagocytic receptor complex. Bead internalization assays were used to assay phagocytic receptor function and showed that Tetraspanins may play a role in phagocytosis by innate immune cells. This study showed that the effect of Tetraspanins on IgG versus oxLDL-mediated phagocytosis can be quantified and confirmed the inhibitory effect of Tetraspanins 2, 6, 10 and 31 on oxLDL-coated beads internalization by U937 cells. The knockdown of Tetraspanin 2, 6, 10 and 31 lowered the ability of cells to uptake oxLDL-coated beads. The knockdown of Tetraspanin 31 also lowered the phagocytic efficiency of cells to internalize IgG-coated beads by U937 cells. It is of great importance to develop techniques to experimentally differentiate and to distinguish the roles of specific proteins to the oxLDL versus IgG mediated phagocytosis. There may be important therapeutic benefits to inhibiting the uptake of oxLDL by scavenger receptors without interrupting the beneficial clearance of bacteria by Fc receptors. This study shows that the novel biophysical and biochemical employed here can reveal the differences between IgG and oxLDL bead internalization and clearly indicates that the IgG and oxLDL mediated phagocytosis utilized different regulatory mechanisms. In future studies, GFP constructs as well as immunoflorescent staining can be further used to determine the presence of Tetraspanin 31 in the Fc receptor complex and Tetraspanins 2,6,10 and 31 at the site of oxLDL internalization and to confirm the knockdowns. It is very important to identify as many members of the Tetraspanin family as possible in the macrophage receptor complexes since understanding the regulatory roles of Tetraspanins can provide insight into various immune diseases.
