Abstract
energy efficient new homes or energy retrofit projects. By increasing the thermal Superinsulation is becoming increasingly attractive in the construction of

insulation inside walls, new possible unforeseen building durability issues arise that were otherwise not present during standard 2"x6" construction, as there is less materials in the building enclosure. One method to combat the reduced drying potential for drying. The reduced drying is often attributed to using low permeance potential is to use the highest permeable vapour diffusion open materials for all building enclosure components such as the "Arctic Wall". The purpose of this study is to determine how the Arctic Wall performs in Fairbanks, Alaska in addition to methods. The results of experimental simulation using WUFI 5.2 hygrothermal other climates, and how it also compares with other common vapour diffusion open software have shown that all vapour diffusion open walls have a potential for

condensation that is most dominated by the heating load across the climates that were tested. The Arctic Wall was found to be safe to use in all climates using the par with other vapour diffusion open strategies. tested methods, but still poses a potential risk due to potential condensation due to air leakage. The results of this study have shown that the Arctic Wall performed on

Superinsulation methods in conjunction with high levels of air-tightness are

currently being examined as a method to contribute to the goal of reducing energy use in buildings. With the increase in insulation values, more effort and examination is needed to keep the moisture balance of the building enclosure in check as an increased risk of moisture damage in the building envelope material layer using a polyethylene sheet as described by the CMHC "the vapour retarder retardant paint on the finished drywall" (Canada Mortgage and Housing

The purpose of this project is to determine if the as-built Arctic wall in

Fairbanks Alaska is suitable for various Canadian climates by examining the hygrothermal properties of that wall using WUFI 5.2 (Fraunhofer Institut Bauphysik, 2011) in comparison to other superinsulated wall systems

1.3 Scope, Purpose and Research Questions
The current trend to make a building enclosure more energy efficient

involves high levels of thermal and air leakage in conjunction with energy efficient heating and cooling systems. Different "superinsulation" methods need to be examined to determine which strategies are appropriate for specific climates. this study are: Thicker insulated wall methods present an inherent difficulty to dry out to a safe

level in comparison to traditional construction methods. The research questions for 1. How will vapour diffusion open walls designs as-built in Fairbanks, Alaska perform in other Canadian cities in terms of moisture management? similar moisture management strategies?

2. How does the Arctic Wall compare with superinsulated walls using 3. Are modifications necessary for vapour diffusion open walls for when using these walls in different cold climates? various Canadian climates and what recommendations can be made

2.1 Mould appearance and growth prediction
To help identify which moisture conditions inside the wall could possibly

lead to a building enclosure failure, it would be beneficial to determine the

parameters of mould growth. Once the findings of previous mathematical models have been tallied, the most appropriate set of rules can be organized and used to occurs to that material caused by physical, biological, or chemical processes A building material failure can be defined if an irreversible deformation determine safe levels of temperature and relative humidity inside a material layer.

This effect can be prevented by the design of the wall if rot fungi, does not begin its germination until about 95% relative humidity, making humidity requirement for germination is much lower (Trechsel & Bomberg, 2009).

The Seldbauer mathematical model for mould prediction was used for WUFI-BIO 3.0 programming, and predicted the amount of growth after germination (Black, 2006). If that model cannot predict mould growth, then it cannot predict how drying potential effects the growth. The Seldbauer model One of the more commonly used mathematical models formulated to predict

Although the starch and sugar food materials is not the same as surface materials of which these models are based there is little air movement, then the supply of oxygen is diminished, possibly altering the model. source of cellulose insulation is similar to wood products, the composition of bulk upon.

2.2 Moisture
2.2.1: Moisture balance Influence of evaporation of water by vapour diffusion is a goal of this paper to

show where drying can be most controlled as material layers and composition can be changed. For a wall section to have excess moisture that can lead to mould failure, it can no longer store the excess moisture safely [Figure 5]. When the wall system be dried by the following mechanisms: [Figure 6] (Straube & Burnett, Building Science for Building Enclosures, 2005). 1. Evaporation by capillary suction 3. Drainage of free water 4. Cladding ventilation air changes 2. Evaporation by water vapour diffusion or air leakage

The ability to utilize all four of these drying methods will be crucial to prevent

hygrothermal software is the lack of an air leakage prediction factor. It must be

acknowledged that air leakage can be more influential than water vapour diffusion on bulk moisture deposits in walls. In a common exaggerated example, air leakage was more influential by up to two orders of magnitude for a one inch square hole in drywall versus a single 1200mm x 2400mm drywall sheet [Figure 7] (Lstiburek, 2004). With leakage is designed to be minimized, making diffusion more dominant than this Pa values of less than 0.6, this ratio will undoubtedly be significantly reduced as air many new superinsulated homes that are designed with the goal to achieve ACH @ 50

previous value used in [figure 7]. Although air leakage is a more dominant factor, the

water vapour diffusion effects are not well understood for Arctic Wall type of building enclosure. Drainage of free water is controlled in this simulation by the SIGA Majcoat type. The wall system can also be wetted by the failure to control or deflect the water resistive barrier, and cladding ventilation air changes can be adjusted by cladding effects of each one of these four mechanisms with some being more dominant than

others.

Figure 7: Air leakage can be far more influential than diffusion. A newly designed superinsulated enclosure will by design have less air leakage than older cavity only insulation homes. This example could become obsolete with a new more accurate air leakage rate. (Lstiburek, 2004)

allows unwanted moisture to pass clear through to the other side of the enclosure without low permeance material layer barriers hindering that flow. A vapour control layer can be defined as the building component(s) or materials that are used to hinder the flow of vapour diffusion. The vapour diffusion open wall in heating retarder more in comparison to the standard non-superinsulation practice. The season [Figure 8] allows more moisture laden air to pass thorough the vapour

This negative effect is countered by the property of plywood of becoming even more vapour open in high vapour partial is latex paint layer on the interior, which can be classified as a type II vapour retarder, depending on the number of paint layers. vapour retarder, there is potential for elevated moisture levels at the sheathing [if it

Figure 8: The vapour diffusion open principle: In both vapour diffusion open walls [top and bottom left], there is only one intentional variable permeance vapour control plane, with the latex paint providing an unintentional vapour retarding layer. If water enters the wall system, it has few barriers to pass through to exit to the other side. The standard wall on the top right can slow down wintertime vapour diffusion well, but may create a condensation plane during high moisture events to the interior in cooling season, which the cellulose will absorb and accumulate over time.

by selecting building materials that have a primary focus of being vapour diffusion permeable, with other qualities being of lesser importance. Generally, the drying mechanisms in a wall work well for dissipating built-in moisture if there are no vapour diffusion barriers when using cellulose insulation (Carll, TenWolde, &

To further help encourage drying, the vapour diffusion open principle works

Munson, 2007). This logic can be extended to other materials in order to promote properties depending on vapour partial pressure. Two smart vapour retarders field tested and showed to perform well during the spring and summer as the carried a higher moisture content than the nylon vapour retarder. 13 made of nylon and a one made of synthetic fibres with strips of polyethylene were

While those low permeance materials can prevent the exfiltration air from reaching the dew point temperature by increasing the temperature of the sensitive balance into account by developing a "Ratio of Outboard to Inboard outboard side of the cavity insulation, it also presents a barrier for moisture-laden air to escape through vapour diffusion. The National Building Council took this Thermal Resistance" for low air and vapour permeance for insulated sheathing represents the minimum ratio required for the insulated sheathing to raise the cavity insulations outer edge to safe levels above the dew point. There is no down too much.

Experimental mould measurement validation is difficult because the process involves the researcher observing the mould and measuring the diameter of the sample in threedimensional bulk which cannot be seen. This difficulty in observation is why current experiments focus on surface growth. The sample could be oxygen depleted due to having only a small amount of air passing over the mould colony surface, which would decrease growth rate.

The cooling season drives the moisture inward, and bulk water in conjunction with solar driven moisture will send water to the outboard side of the vapour retarder. Since superinsulated walls hold more bulk moisture than standard walls due to its large volume and hygric surface, one monitoring position will be observed on the outboard side of the buffer, the amount of water sent inward is larger. Since the bulk water will hit a exterior insulation that touches the vapour retarder. Since the formation of mould is the primary concern of this method, ASHRAE RP-1325 year 1 method by Salonvaara et al., will also be used for monitoring and begins for five months from May to September (Salonvaara et al., 2010).

advantage of using this method, is that brief drying periods are better taken into account as most hourly mould potential events tend to be bunched together, and not spread evenly

Table 5: Consecutive versus non-consecutive days. 24 hours representing a single day are recorded for mould potential. A value of 1 indicates that mould potential is possible, while a value of 0 indicates no possible growth. A maximum of 7 hours (hours 0-6) ignores the mould potential occurring at all other hours with a value of 1. The tabulation of 7 hours could easily be counted as low mould potential, but 18 non-consecutive can be high. Counting non-consecutive days ignores the brief drying periods, which goes not affect germination, and more closely adheres to the Sedlbauer mould growth model in figure 4. (Sedlbaur, 2002).

The choice of superinsulation wall type has a larger impact on the ratio in the colder climates of Fairbanks and Winnipeg, but has little effect in Toronto and Vancouver. Current available models and this study have unknown. shown exterior insulated ratios are conservative as the safe level of condensation is

the lowest ratio for condensation potential in Fairbanks and Winnipeg. However

6. Recommendations
recommendations cannot be made based on that test. Without knowing the real requirement for the exterior sheathing ratio, it is difficult to make a [figure 38] to protect the outer layer. rigid mineral wool layer should be used on the exterior portion of the cellulose The SBPO/PP co-polymer and wood based vapour retarder options Without knowing the effects of condensation potential due to air infiltration,

recommendation of how thick a layer of mineral wool should be. At the very least, a

simulated can be used in Fairbanks, Winnipeg and Toronto as no mould occurred.

Exterior walls with OSB sheathing and SBPO can also be safely used, but due to the

reduced drying ability after heavy rain events, other superinsulated options should be favoured over this wall type. All vapour diffusion open walls can also be used in polymer interior based vapour retarder. retarders and exterior sheathing should be avoided in favour of the SBPO/PP coshould still remain out of plywood in all climates that were tested. Vancouver, but due to the milder, wetter climate, wood based diffusion open vapour The window buck and gussets that hold the exterior cladding substrate layer

The method of constructing the Arctic Wall is the same, but before the weather resistive barrier is installed, blocking can be screwed into the gussets at such an angle that 100mm high density rigid insulation can slide into position easily.

It would be beneficial to know if, with reduced air leakage requirements of
