Observational Before and After Safety Study of Installing Signals at Rural Intersections: Using the Empirical Bayes (EB) and Conventional Methods

Master of Applied Science, 2005

By Ravindranauth Bhim Department of Civil Engineering Ryerson University

Abstract
Signalizing an intersection usually results in a reduction in right-angle and left-tum crashes, and an increase in rear-end crashes. This study used the conventional and

Empirical Bayes (EB) before and after methods on 45 treated sites (converted fi'om stop to signal control) in California and Minnesota to estimate the safety effect o f having signals installed. The results confirm the belief that right-angle and left-tum crashes are reduced and rear-end crashes increase. However, these effects cannot be used to quantitatively assess the benefit gained from the reduction of right-angle and left-tum crashes against the increase in rear-end crashes, simply because crash types have different severities. By performing an economic examination of the safety effects, this study was able to show that by installing signals on 45 treated sites, there was a positive aggregate economic benefit of $155,883,978 which represents a 69 percent reduction in cost. This translated into $616,142 per site-year.

Introduction
This

At-grade highway intersections are inevitable due to conflicting traffic streams.

makes them a very critical component in a transportation system. Hence the need for safety is paramount, especially at high-speed intersections, such as those in a rural jurisdiction. In Ontario alone, 224,642 collisions were reported in the Ministry o f

Transposition 2002 annual road safety report (MTO 2002) inclusive of 48,116 and 60,618 intersection and intersection-related accidents respectively; a staggering 48 percent o f reported collisions. In 2003, the U.S Department of Transportation reported that 9,213 fatalities occurred due to intersection related collisions. Clearly there is a need for safer operating conditions at intersections. To this end, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) is currently working on a research project titled "Crash reduction Factors for Traffic Engineering and ITS Countermeasures (NCHRP 17-25)". The research in this thesis was performed as part of that project.

1.1

Statement of Problem

Installing traffic signals at intersections has been one of the many methods used in traffic engineers' constant quest for more safety and better efficiency. The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD 2003) is one o f the main standards providing guidance to traffic engineers on the use of traffic control devices. In Part 4 o f the MUTCD,

guidance on when one should consider installing a traffic signal is explained under "warrants". Warrants alone are not the only criteria in determining if a signal is

necessary or not. Whether or not the warrants are met, the MUTCD (2003) suggests that

15

an engineering study be performed to investigate whether the overall safety and efficient operation of the intersection will improve if a signal were to be installed.

Eight warrants are proposed in Part 4 of the MUTCD; they are based on eight-hour vehicular volume, four-hour vehicular volume, peak hour volume, pedestrian volume, school crossing needs, coordination of the signal system, crash experience, and the characteristics of the roadway network. The warrant that pertains to road safety, and particularly to this study, is warrant 7. The focus of this warrant is directly related to the crash experience sustained at an intersection.

The MUTCD does not actually propose a procedure for executing the suggested engineering study. However, work done by McGee et al. (2003) proposed a procedure for estimating the change in expected crash frequency and costs if a traffic signal is installed at an intersection. This procedure was based on urban/suburban intersections. Rural intersections are different from urban and sub-urban intersections in several aspects with the main difference being the design speeds, which are higher than those in urban and sub-urban areas. Other factors are driver demography, traffic volumes, business

activity, etc. To facilitate the development o f an engineering procedure for determining the need for a traffic signal at a rural stop controlled intersection, one must know what would be the safety benefit of installing a traffic signal in a rural environment. The methods adapted in this research for answering this question are discussed in the following section.

16

1.2

Objective of Study

The main objective o f this study is to evaluate the safety effect o f installing traffic signals at rural stop controlled intersections. The safety effect o f a treatment at an entity is evaluated by finding the difference between the accident frequency that would have occurred had the entity not been treated and the accident frequency that occurred on the entity afl;er treatment. In this study, four methods were compared for evaluating the

effects o f a treatment (installing a traffic signal). These are: · · · · The simple (Naive) before and after study, The Naive before and after study with correction for traffic flows, The Naive before and after with safety performance functions (SPFs), and The Empirical Bayes (EB) before and after method.

For all methods crash effects are estimated. For the EB method, an analysis o f the economic effects is performed to accommodate the differential impacts on different crash types and severities.

1.3

Structure of Report

This thesis is divided into 8 chapters. This Chapter (1) outlines the motives and objectives for this research; these are supported by an in-depth literature review covered in Chapter 2. The methodology used in estimating safety is reviewed in Chapter 3 with a discussion on the theoretical approaches to the EB and conventional procedures used. Chapter 3 also has a discussion on fitting a functional form in multivariate regression models that are fundamental to the EB methodology. Chapter 4 addresses the data used in this research, while a description of the accident prediction models fitted for use in the application o f the EB procedure is covered in Chapter 5. The economic analysis o f the 17

change in crashes o f various types is in Chapter 7, while Chapter 8 has the conclusions derived from this study.

CHAPTER 2:

Literature Review

Evaluating the safety effect o f the installation of traffic signals at rural stop controlled intersections is the main focus o f this research. Thus, a thorough literature review on the estimation o f the safety effect o f installing signals was conducted, along with a review o f methods for estimating safety at both signal and stop controlled intersections. The latter is pertinent to the EB methodology used in this study.

2.1

Accident Pattern after Signalization

King and Goldblatt (1975) conducted a cross-sectional study to illustrate the relationship between accident types and intersection controls. They analyzed data obtained firom 250 signal and stop controlled intersections across several states in the United States o f America. For each state, data were disaggregated at four main levels; geographic area (north, south, etc), type o f area (central business district, rural etc), major and minor approach volumes, and control type. Three methods of analysis were applied to the

disaggregated data; Analysis o f Variance, Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, and Hypothesis Testing. The following are findings pertinent to this research as concluded by the authors: 1. If a traffic signal were to be installed, a reduction in right-angle accidents and an increase in rear-end accidents will result, 2. No definitive answer could be given as to whether the installation o f a traffic signal will have an overall reduction o f accidents at intersections, 3. Right-angle accidents were not directly reduced after a signal was installed, and

19

4. Accident rates, in number of accidents per million entering vehicles, are higher at signalized intersections but this is offset by the lower severity per accident. However, cross-sectional studies, such as this is, are not a reliable method for evaluating changes in safety because of its underlying assumptions. Cross-sectional studies facilitate safety comparison between two distinct sets of entities. For example, one set can comprise o f signalized intersections and the other set contains stop controlled intersections. The difference in safety between these two distinct sets of entities is not entirely due to the difference in control type since it can also be due to differences in factors such as geometric configuration. Therefore, the findings of King and Goldblatt are questionable.

Rural intersections are characterized by their high design speeds which clearly has an effect on the severity of crashes. This distinct characteristic of rural intersections implies that one should expect differences in accident pattern by types and severity from urban intersections. A study performed by Hanna et al. (1976) attempted to quantify this difference using 232 rural intersections located in Virginia, United States of America. The authors used accident rates (number of accidents per million entering vehicles) at each intersection to compare the relationship of traffic control and intersection geometries to accident types. Based on the data, 36 percent of accidents were classified as rear-end and 43 percent of accidents as angle. More rear-end accidents occurred at signalized intersections while more angle accidents occurred at stop-controlled intersections. No substantive findings came to light regarding differences in safety between urban and rural intersections. The findings of this study by Hanna et al. (1976) are also questionable because they are based on a cross-seetional evaluation.

20

Datta and Dutta (1990) focused on quantifying accident experience after traffic signals were installed. A simple before and after method was adopted using 102 intersections with signals installed during 1978 and 1983 in Miehigan, United States o f America. A paired t-test at 0.05 sigmficance level was also performed on the before and after mean crash rates to check if they were statistically significant. The findings were: 1. After signals were installed, there was a 19.2 percent reduction in total accident, 2. Rear-end accident rates increased by 53 percent, 3. Right angle accident rates were 57 percent lower after signals were installed, and 4. Head-on and left-tum accident rates increased by 50 percent.

Datta (1991) carried out another study, using the same data set, on the safety effect o f left-tum lanes at intersections after the installation o f signals. A similar approach was used, that is, a paired t-tests at 0.05 significance level for the before and after mean accident rates. The analysis was disaggregated into three groups; locations with left-tum lanes, locations without left-tum lanes, and locations where left-tum lanes were installed with signal installation. The researcher found that total accidents were reduced at intersections where a left tum lane was added at the same time a signal was installed. A similar finding was obtained for right-angle accidents. The number of rear-end crashes increased after signals were installed at these intersections.

The findings firom both Datta (1990) and Datta (1991) somewhat concur with the findings o f King (1975) and Hanna et al. (1976) in that there was a reduction in the total and right angle crashes, and an increase in rear-end crashes. However, the methodology adapted by Datta (1990 and 1991) is more favoured when the objective is to evaluate changes in

21

safety following the signalizing of intersections. This is because Datta (1990 and 1991) used sites that were actually converted to signal in their before and after study while the other two studies used two distinct sets of sites used in a cross-sectional evaluation. Even so, the simple before and after methodology used by Datta and Dutta is also questionable because of the assumption that the before number of crashes at an entity is a good estimate of the number of crashes in the after period had the treatment not been implemented. The problem with this assumption is that had there been no treatment, accident frequency could have easily increased or decreased due to regression to the mean (RTM) (Persaud 2001; Hauer 1997; Hauer and Persaud 1983; etc)., AADT trends or changes in factors such as weather, driver demography etc. Indeed, if an entity was selected to be treated because of its high crash counts alone, there is a good chance regression to the mean is at play (Hauer 1997). It is paramount, therefore, that when evaluating the safety effects of a particular treatment, one must be able to account for these changes in safety unrelated to the treatment. The Empirical Bayes (EB) procedure, developed by Hauer (1997), does just that.

2.2

The Empirical Bayes (EB) Procedure

Over the last decade, significant advancements were made towards estimating safety effect o f treatments. The groundbreaking Empirical Bayes before-and after procedure by Hauer (1997) help safety analysts account for more than just RTM in their safety analyses. It accounts for time trend in accident counts, and trends in AADT and other non-treatment factors that may cause changes in accidents. The EB procedure does this by the joining o f two clues (Hauer 1997); the pre-treatment accident counts on the treated entity and the expected accident frequency at sites that share the same traits as the treated

22

entity. The underlying theory o f the EB procedure is documented in Chapter 3. There are several studies done prior to this research that adapted the EB procedure (See e.g., Hauer et al. 2002; Persaud et al. 1997; Council et al. 2005; etc.).

One such study was by McGee et al. (2003) where the EB methodology was used to develop a procedure for the MUTCD, for estimating the likely change in safety when the installation of a traffic signal is contemplated. The study used data from several states in the United States of America and from Toronto, Canada. The treatment (installation o f signals) sites comprised of 22 three-legged and 100 four-legged intersections. Corresponding reference populations were compiled and regression models were developed for applying the EB method. The study found the same pattern for right-angle and rear-end accidents as did King (1975), Hanna et al. (1976), and Datta (1990 and 1991). However, the safety effects were lower simply because the EB method accounted for RTM, AADT trend and causal factors.

In the EB methodology the expected accident frequency at similar sites to the treated entity is estimated from a regression model (also known as a Safety Performance Function), that is calibrated from entities with similar traffic volumes and characteristics as the treated entity. Therefore, the need for reliable regression models is critical. A more detail discussion on safety performance functions can be found in Chapter 3.

23

CHAPTER 3:

Research Methodology

The safety of roadway segments and intersections is always a major concern. Therefore, the question of what is safety, and how it should be measured is important. Hauer (1997) defines safety as "the number of accidents by kind and severity, expected to occur on an entity during a specified period". Relating this definition of safety to entities o f interest, road segments or intersections, the following expression is derived: E{Accident Frequency at Entity) = E[Frequency o f Accidents at Entity / Unit o f Time) Another measure of safety usually found in literature is the expected accident rate (Hauer 1997) and is defined as: . ^n . Accident Frequency Accident Rate = ------------------- Exposure / Unit o f Time (3.1)

where exposure is the traffic flow through an entity during a specified duration (usually per year since the exposure is usually measure in AADT).

However, this measure of safety is not theoretically sound because of the non-linear relationship between the number of accidents and traffic flow. Accident rate assumes that the number of accidents that occurred at an entity is proportional to its AADT. The problem with this assumption is that safety performance functions (SPFs) developed in numerous sources (Bauer 1997; Bauer 1998; Hauer 1988; Lord 2000 and 2005; etc) show that the relationship between accidents and AADT in not linear. A SPF developed by Persaud et al. (2001) for estimating total crashes per year for signalized intersections in Maryland will be used to illustrate this non-linear relationship. The SPF was developed

Figure 3.1 - Safety Performance Function for signalized intersections in Maryland, US.

The nonlinear shape shown in Figure 3.1 supports the point that accident frequency indeed exhibits a non-linear relationship with traffic flow. In Figure 3.1, accident rate is the slope at any point on the SPF since the slope is simply the ratio o f the change in accident to the change in AADT. Therefore, if one is to use accident rate as a measure o f

25

safety, they are simply saying that at low AADT (point A) it is more hazardous than at higher AADT (point B) due to the difference in slope of the two dashed lines (red and green). This is a false estimate of safety since the slope at any point could be equal with different levels of AADT. Therefore, accident rate should not be used in estimating safety at an entity and one should use accident frequency instead.

Knowing what safety is quantitatively, safety analysts are able to measure the effectiveness o f treatments on various entities. The effectiveness of a particular treatment is usually estimated by taking the difference between the safety in the after period had the treatment not been applied, and what the safety o f the treated entity in the after period was. So we are faced with two fundamental questions that need answers: 1. What would have been the safety of the entity in the after period had the treatment not been implemented, ti? 2. What is the safety after the treatment was implemented, 1?

Two methods are usually used to quantify the effectiveness of a treatment once X and n: 1. Reduction in Expected Number of Crashes, Ô 2. Index of Effectiveness, 0 where ô = 7T-X and (3.3)

26

e = -

(3.4)

5 is simply the reduction in crashes after the treatment was implemented whereby, if Ô is positive it simply implies that the treatment was effective and if negative that the treatment is detrimental to safety. The estimate of 0 also informs safety analysts about how safe a treatment is, that is if 0 is less than 1, the treatment is considered to be effective since the number o f crashes after the treatment is lower than the estimated number o f crashes in the after period had the treatment not been implemented. Conversely, if 0 is larger than one, the treatment is considered to be harmful. 0 is also used to estimate the percent reduction or increase in crashes after a treatment is implemented as (1-0)* 100.

Hauer (1997) has shown that simply taking the ratio of A . to

ti

will usually result in a

biased estimate of 0 and proposed an unbiased estimate of 0 instead (Equation 3.5). A JT

The variances are usually used to validate statistical significance for the estimates o f Ô and 0 at some specific confidence level. For instance, standard deviation is easily

computed fi-om the variance (variance''^) and knowing that the one-sided 95% confidence interval is 1.96 of the standard deviation, the statistical significance of the estimates at the 5% level is simply established if the estimate ± 1.96 standard deviations does not include zero. Other confidence levels can be used, such as 90%, but 95% seems most common. Equations 3.3 through 3.7 are the rudiments of quantifying the safety effectiveness o f any implemented treatment.

In order to estimate the value o f n one needs to account for the effects o f the regression to the mean phenomenon. This is discussed next.

3.1

Regression to the mean

If an entity is selected to be treated due to its high accident counts, the safety benefits after treatment will usually be overestimated (Hauer 1997). This is because accident counts on any entity oscillates around the true (long term) average of its accident count. Therefore, if an entity experiences high accident count it will likely decrease subsequently even if no treatment was implemented. This phenomenon is known as the regression-to-the-mean (RTM).

28

Several sources (Hauer 1997; Hauer and Persaud 1983; Persaud 2001, etc.) have explained this phenomenon in detail. An illustration of this phenomenon was developed for this study using data from California, HSIS database. Data from 1993-1997 at 1,463 rural intersections were used. The intersections were all rural four-legged, two-way-stopcontrolled, with two-lane major and minor approaches.

The average accidents per intersection per year over the 3 years o f data were approximately constant at 0.85. Yet, as Table 1 shows, accidents in individual groups changed. For example, the 315 intersections that recorded 1 accident during 1994-1996 (0.33 per year) averaged 0.43 accidents per intersection in 1997. Intersections that

recorded 3 or more accidents in 1994 - 1996 experienced a reduction in accidents in

29

1997. Conversely, intersections that recorded 2 or less accidents during 1994 - 1996 experienced an increase in accident in 1997. These changes are nothing more than the effects o f the RTM phenomenon which must be accounted for in quantifying the safety effects o f a treatment. The ground breaking work by Hauer (1997) uses the Empirical Bayes (EB) procedure for doing so. The EB procedure is reviewed in the following section.

3.2

The Empirical Bayes (EB) Procedure

In section 3.1, it was made clear that two fundamental questions need to be answered to estimate the safety effect of a treatment at an entity. They are; what safety would have been had the treatment not been implemented, and what is safety after the treatment was implemented? The EB procedure was intentionally developed to estimate n by The second question is rather trivial - what safety was after

accounting for RTM.

treatment; the accident frequency after treatment is an unbiased estimate of safety after the treatment was implemented (Hauer 1997).

Hauer (1997) has proven that the most efficient means of accounting for RTM in estimating safety is by joining o f two clues. These two clues are: 1. Traits o f the entity in question - traits here are referring to roadway geometric elements such as number of lanes, median type (divided or undivided), rural or urban environment, etc. Safety is affected by the traits of an entity; for example, a rural signalized intersection will tend to have more severe accidents than urban signalized intersections because of their high design speeds. Hauer (1997) used the concept o f a reference population when referring to entities that share the

30

same traits as the entity o f interest. Safety o f entities in the reference population, E{ k }, is a very useful measure in understanding what safety is at the entity o f interest. 2. Accident count (K) at the entity in question --the accidents that took place on the entity o f interest before the treatment was implemented.

The entire framework of the Empirical Bayes (EB) procedure is supported by the joining o f these two clues. The same notations used by Hauer (1997) are used here and joining o f the two clues resulted in Equation 3.8;

E {K \K }= a E {K ) + i ^ - a } K

(3.8)

where E { k } = expected accident frequency in the reference population K = accident counts (history) at the entity o f interest a = is a weight between 0 and 1 I f a is close to 1 then the safety in the reference population is close to the safety at the entity o f interest. Conversely, if a is close to 0, then the safety, k , o f the entity o f interest is close to the count of accidents recorded on it. Clearly the weight, a, in Equation 3.8 plays a pivotal role in the EB procedure and is calculated using Equation 3.9: a 1 (3.9)

where as the variance of the accident frequency, VAR{ k}, is estunated using Equation 3.10:

31

VAR{K\K} = { \ - a ) E { K \ K }

: ^

-

> v>

(3.10)

Therefore, one must be able to estimate E { k } and V A R { k } before the EB procedure can be performed. Hauer (1997) assumed that the accident count at the entity of interest, K, obeys the Poisson distribution while the k 's in the reference population follow a gamma probability distribution. By knowing the probability distributions of accidents in the

reference population and treated sites, Hauer (1997) was able to prove that the probability density function of the
k 's

in the reference population is indeed gamma distributed by

using Bayes theorem. The derivation is not shown here, only the results. The gamma distribution of the
k 's

in the reference population, assuming that the distribution of the

accidents at the entity of interest is Poisson distributed, is given by Equation 3.11 :

*

r(F rï)

where the parameters `a' and `b ' are associated with the gamma distribution. From the properties o f gamma distribution: · · The mean is the ratio o f the parameter b to parameter a; that is E{ k ) = -- a The variance is the ratio of the parameter b to the squared o f parameter a, that is VAR{k ) = \ a Therefore, b a = ---------E{ k } implying that 0 and b = a VAR{k }

resulting in E {k } VAR{k )

Thus substituting for parameter `a' parameter we can find parameter `b '

Therefore, if parameter `b ' is known, we can then easily estimate E{ k} and VAR{ k }. The estimation o f `a' and `b ' hinges on the fact that E{k } and VAR{ k } are known. Two methods are proposed (Hauer 1997) to calculate E{k } and VAR{ k}. They are: 1. Method o f Sample Moments 2. Multivariate Regression Method More emphasis will be placed on the multivariate regression method in this thesis because it's the method that is widely accepted as being the better o f the two.

Before moving on, some clarification is worthwhile with respect to Equations 3.8 and 3.9. Simplifying Equation 3.9 will result in the following: a = ---------------= -----------------^ ^ VAR{ k ) E { k } + VAR{ k ) E{k } butwe know what VAR{k} is equal to,

33

VAR{k } =
E{k)

b b

, therefore substituting for VAR{k} will result in
b

=a

Now 1- « = 1---------b^E{K)

;simplifyingwehave -\-a ^ b+E{K)

Therefore, Equation 3.8 when simplified resulted in Equation 3.14: (3.14)
b + E{K) b + E{K) b + E{K]

where E{k|K} estimates the number of crashes

An important aspect of Equation 3.14 is the duration for which E{k} pertains to. E{k}
must have the same duration as the before period accidents accounts, K. Usually E{k } is

estimated in crashes per year, and that estimate is simply multiplied by the number of years for which we have before period accident counts, K.

3.2.1

Multivariate Regression Method

As the name suggest, this method is simply using a fitted regression equation to estimate E{k } and VAR{k}. The models use accident frequency as the dependent variable and traits such as AADT, lane widths, lighting etc. as the independent variables. Fitting such a regression model falls in the domain of statistics and is discussed in more detail in Section 3.4 since it is very crucial to the validity of the results for this research. The estimate of a multivariate model that is fitted to accident counts is E{k}; this is the expected accident frequency in the reference population. The other estimate that is

34

needed is the VAR{ k}. Based on previous work (Persaud et al. 2001, Persaud et al. 2003, McGee et al. 2003, etc.) the VAR{k} is estimated by Equation 3.15 \2 VAR{k} = ^ £ ^ ^ (3.15)

The relationship is the same as Equation 3.13. Again, the parameter `b ' is associated with the gamma distribution. This parameter is usually estimated during the fitting o f a multivariate regression model to the accident data. The method of maximum likelihood is usually used in the parameter estimation process. More details o f the modeling

approach are discussed in Section 3.4. The relationship shown in Equation 3.15 was confirmed when the estimates of VAR( k } were plotted against the estimated E{ k } for a specific entity (Hauer 1997).

Figure 3.2 illustrates the concept of the multivariate regression method and the estimate o f VAR{k }. Hauer (1997) suggested that the estimate of VAR{k} for a single data point is as shown in equation 3.16 VAR{k ) = \^E { k } - K ) '' - Estimate o f E { k )^ (3.16)

Figure 3.2 depicts the residual for a single data point (accident count) on an entity o f interest. The relationship of VAR{k} that is commonly adapted is not actually `always' the case (Hauer 1997). This equation is usually dependent on the data on which the multivariate regression model was fitted. However, this relationship was adopted in

several sources (Council et al. 2005, Persaud et al. 2003, McGee et al. 2003 etc.) and is also used in this thesis.

The discussions so far have been based on how safety is quantified for an entity during the before period. In summary, if one needs to estimate the safety of an entity, the following steps would be followed: · · · Estimate E { k } and VAR{k} from either the multivariate regression method Find the weight, a, using Equation 3.9, and Use Equation 3.8 to estimate the expected accident frequency on the entity o f interest. The EB procedure (Hauer et al. 2002) explained so far has been referred to as the abridged version since it only uses the average traffic flow and a few (2-3) years o f accident counts. However, Hauer et al. (2002) has shown that by using longer before and

36

after years o f traffic and accident counts, the safety estimate is much more precise than when estimated by the shorter version. The full EB procedure is explained next.

In road safety analysis, more than one year of before and after period o f accident data are usually collected for an entity. That is, in the before period one could have data on an entity for several years as bi, b 2 , ..., by, where by represents the last year o f before period data. The same applies to the after period, that is, one could have data on an entity for several years as ai, az, ..., az where a% is the last year o f data in the after period. With yearly data on an entity `i ', the expected accident frequency E{Kj} will be different each year. The estimate o f E{xi} is usually derived from a multivariate regression model, thus one would have estimates o f Ki,bi, Kj,b2 , ···, Kj,by.

The multivariate regression model developed from the reference population is used to calculate E{Ki,bi}, E{Kj,b2 }, ... , E{Ki,by} using time (yearly) sensitive parameters. As will be explained in Section 3.4, a model is usually used to capture the systematic variations among the data (covariates) and link it to a dependent variable (expected accident frequency). Since each year will experience a different count o f accidents, the average model with its same intercept term or multiplier cannot be used to estimate the Efxj} for each year. The intercept is usually calibrated to capture the non-systematic variations in the data, such as driver's age, demography, traffic volume trends, education, accident reporting etc. The procedure on how the intercept is calibrated for each year is illustrated in (Harwood et al. 2002 and McGee et al. 2003).

37

The next question that must be answered is, how does the EB procedure account for the changes in expected accident frequency for each year? Hauer (1997) assumes that the change in the expected accident frequencies for each year can be used to capture the nonsystematic variations in the data by using Equation 3.17: C i,y = ^ (3.17)

where Ki,y = prediction in year `y' Ki,bi = prediction in year ` 1' The purpose of using Ci,y in Equation 3.17 is to capture the changes at an entity over time. These changes are non-systematic, and cannot be quantified by the regression model. The best estimate is given by Equation 3.17. The reason is that, in a model equation, the accident counts are a frmction of independent variables (AADT, lane widths etc.) and by definition of Equation 3.17, C,,y is in turn a function of the independent variables.

Therefore, under the full empirical Bayes (EB) framework, the safety at some entity `i ' during the first year `b i' is estimated using Equation 3.18 (Hauer 1997):

The concept o f weight explained in the shorten EB procedure applies here also. However, the weight in the full EB procedure uses different expected accident frequencies for each year whereas the shortened version uses the same for each year. Simplifying Equation 3.18 will result in Equation 3.14 with the addition of the Ci,y parameter

- is exactly the same as Equation 3.8, only here we are

taking into account E{Ki,y} and not simply E{Ki}.

Knowing what the safety is in year ` 1' is only part of what is needed. The safety at the entity in later years b^, ba, ... by and ai, az ..., a%is also needed. Manipulating Equation 3.17, one can estimate the safety of an entity each year after year ` 1'; that is,

(3.20) and (3.21) In essence. Equation 3.17 is simply normalizing the regression estimate of E{Ki} ft"om year 1 and thereby accounting for the non-systematic changes based on year 1 as the reference point. Therefore, using longer before and after periods does actually help to estimate safety more precisely since the shortened EB version does not account for these changes.

The first question posed earlier, that is, what would have been the safety of the entity in the after period had the treatment not been implemented, is now answered by the use o f Equation 3.20.

40

So far, there has been discussion of the EB procedure for estimating the safety at an entity if a treatment was implemented. Another common method is the Naive approach which is discussed next. The Naïve method is usually not favoured by safety analysts at present but they can serve as a guide if accident data are not available to perform the EB procedure.

3.3

The Naïve Before-After Procedure

As in the EB method, we need to answer the same two fundamental questions in the Naive approach: 1. W hat would have been the safety of the entity in the after period had the treatment not been implemented, t c ? 2. What is the safety after the treatment was implemented, X?

The basis o f the naive method is that the before period accident counts, Kb, are used as an estimate o f the expected accident in the after period, Ka, had the treatment not been implemented (Hauer 1997). For this method, another parameter must first be defined, namely the "ratio o f duration" rj: _ Afier period duration at entity ^ Before period duratio at entity The following formulae outline the approach o f the Naive procedure: %= (3.23) ^ 22)

Accident counts are assumed to be Poisson distributed, implying that the mean and the variance are equal.With this assumption, K @is equal to the mean and variance o f the of theseequations are found in

Knowing X and

tc

of an entity, the safety effectiveness is found using either of the two

methods discussed previously, namely; 1. Reduction in Expected Number of Crashes, Ô 2. Index of Effectiveness, 0 The naive procedure does not account for changes in several factors such as traffic and accident trend, weather, driver's demography etc. So, in essence, the naive procedure simply assumes that had a treatment not been implemented, these factors will remain the same fi' om the before to the after period. Obviously this is not the case. Based on several previous findings (Lord 2000; Hauer 1988; Persaud 2001; etc) traffic flow seems to always have a direct relationship with accidents. Accordingly, Hauer (1997) proposed a modification of the simple naive procedure whereby changes in traffic flow between the before and after periods are accounted for. There are two ways in which traffic flows are accounted for in the naive procedure: 1. iinear or proportional assumption traffic flow and accident counts are

considered to exhibit a proportional relationship with each other and

42

2.

Non-linear or non-proportional assumption - traffic flow and accident counts are considered to follow a non-proportional relationship.

The same set o f equations (Equations 3.22 through 3.26) is used in this modified naive approach. Traffic flow changes are accounted for by use o f a variable introduced by Hauer (1997) referred to as the traffic flow correction factor, rtf, and is defined as the ratio o f the after period flow to the before period flow as shown in Equation 3.27:

- f where:

flow ) / / {^Before flow )

(3.27)

f(afler flow) = expected number of crashes with the after period flow (average after period if more than one year is used) f(before flow) = expected number o f crashes with the before period flow (average before period if more than one year is used).

Under the assumption that the traffic flow and expected accidents have a proportional relationship Equation 3.27 will result in Equation 3.28:

Accident Prediction Models

Development of safety performance functions (SPFs) is a critical component in road safety analysis, especially in empirical Bayes estimation. SPFs are simply statistical

multivariate models developed from the theory of multivariate regression analysis, in which the dependent variable is the accident count and the independent variables are the traits at the entity. Traits refer to geometric, traffic and operational composition o f an entity (lane width, traffic control, number of lanes, speed limit, traffic volumes etc,). This component of safety estimation lies in the domain of statistics in which SPFs are

44

usually calibrated using generalized linear modeling (GLM). The rudiments o f GLM are presented next.

The time honoured theory of linear multivariate regression analysis has been used extensively when one aims in developing some functional relationship, to relate a dependent variable to several independait variables or a single independent variable. The classic form of a multivariate model is given by Equation 3.33 :

E {y) = Po +

" I-- ^Pk^k

(3.33)

where y is the dependent (outcome or response) variable, xi,X2 , ... , Xk are a set o f independent (predictor or regressor) variables and Po, Pi,P 2 , ... , Pk are unknown coefficients. However, there are situations where the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is not linear. The theory o f non-linear regression analysis is the alternative choice with a typical model taking the following form:

y =

(3.34)

The reason Equation 3.34 is referred to as a non-linear model is that the parameter Pz exhibits a non-linear form. Another approach in judging when a model is non-linear is when the partial derivatives are functions of the unknown parameters. Regardless o f the model form used in the linear and non-linear multivariate regression analysis, the errors are always assumed to follow the normal distribution (Raymond et al 2002). With any

45

regression

analysis

that

follows

the

normal

distribution

the

assumption

of

homoscedasticity is made. This assumption is one in which the variance of the error term is constant for each value of the independent variables.

The method of least squares or maximum likelihood (ML) is usually used to estimate the unknown parameters in Equations 3.33 and 3.34. The least squares approach has been very popular due to its simplicity; where estimates of the unknown parameters are achieved when the residual sum o f squares (Equation 3.35) is minimized: (3-35) /= 1 where yi = observed dependent variable, j).= estimated dependent variable. The

maximum likelihood approach on the other hand is a tad more mathematically inclined but is the only way one can estimate the unknown parameters for an SPF that takes the form o f a GLM.

The first step in performing the maximum likelihood estimation is to have a likelihood function with a known probability distribution. The likelihood function is then the joint probability distribution of the observations. The normal distribution is mathematically defined as:

46

where fi = mean of the observation and

= variance. From Equation 3,33, the mean |i

= y since the equation is simply finding the expected value o f y, (E{y}). The component o f (x-p) in Equation 3.36 is the error of the normal distribution (Raymond et al. 2002). Therefore Equation 3.33 will result in: (3.37)

where i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n parameters and j = 1, 2 ,..., k coefficients for observation y;. Knowing that 8 = (x-p) in Equation 3.37, we can substitute into Equation 3.36:

/ W = , a

(3.38)

The likelihood fimction is then the joint probability distribution of Equation 3.38, giving rise to:

From the likelihood function (Equation 3.39), values o f p and cP " are iteratively substituted into the function until the maximum possible value attainable is achieved. The value o f P that maximizes the likelihood function is in turn its estimate.

In the discussion so far, the assumption that the dependent variable follows the normal distribution was made. However, crashes do not follow the normal distribution, implying

47

that the classic linear or non-linear regression, as commonly applied, cannot be used for developing SPFs. The distribution of crashes at an entity was found (Hauer 1997; Poch 1996; Lord 2005; etc) to follow the negative binomial distribution instead. When the error structure does not follow the normal distribution, a unique form of regression technique known as generalized linear models (GLMs) is adopted instead.

The use o f GLM was developed so linear or non-linear regression models may be fitted by a very diverse set of distributions called the exponential family (Myers 2002, Dobson 2002; Myers 1990; and McCullah 1989). The exponential distributions are normal,

binomial. Poisson, geometric, negative binomial, exponential, gamma, and inverse normal distributions. The choice of using the negative binomial distribution in modeling accidents has been shown to be the preferred approach in several sources (Hauer 1997; Hauer et al 1988; Poch 1996 etc).

The negative binomial distribution (NB) is defined mathematically as:

The GLM has three fundamental components (McCullah and Nelder 1989): 1. The random component - this component consists o f the dependent variable with a specific error distribution. In our case the dependent variable is accident counts, E{accident} = |x, with the negative binomial error distribution 2. The systematic component --this component consists of the independent variables that will be used to develop a linear model. predictor, q 3. The link component - this is a very critical component in GLM methodology because it links the random component to the systematic component. The link between jx and q is usually in the form of a function that depends on the error structure. For the negative binomial distribution, the link function is This model will serve as the

the log A The parameter estimation process in a GLM uses the maximum likelihood (ML) approach. In this study, since we know the distribution o f the dependent variable, the ML method was adapted.

The likelihood function for the negative binomial distribution (Equation 3.40) is given by Equation 3.43 and is solved by taking the log. Therefore the likelihood equation is

By taking the log of the likelihood function, Equation 3.43 is reduced in a much simpler form that can be easily solved. The log of the likelihood function is given by Equation 3.44: log(Z) = ^[log(v; + a - \ ) \ - I n x - log (a - 1) !+a log(f(% , )) + log ({l - f (z, )})] /= 1 (3.44)

The model parameters are found by iteratively substituting values for yi, a and P{xi} in Equation 3.44 until the function is maximized.

Models Functional Form and Goodness-of-Flt-Measures

The functional forms o f the models were developed after conducting exploratory analyses o f the data. Use of the Integrate-differentiate (ID) method, developed by Hauer and Bamfo (1997), was the initial step in selecting a functional form. The procedure

consisted of developing an Empirical Integral Function (EIF) by placing each potential variable (for each site) into a series of bins. The bins are sorted in an increasing order. The left boundary of a bin for a single site is located halfway between the current site and the preceding site. The right boundary of the bin is located halfway between the current

50

site and the succeeding site. The height o f the bin is the accident count on the site. The width o f the bin is the difference o f the right and left boundary at a site. The area o f the bin (height x width) is the value o f the EIF at that site. The EIF is then plotted and compared to some pre-established functions (power, gamma, polynomial etc) as shown in Figure 3.3.

If the EIF should have a similar shape to any o f those in Figure 3.3, then the pertinent functional form is selected. This method has been applied in several studies (Lord 2000; Persaud et al. 2002) in selecting a functional form for their safety performance functions. Other functional forms (McGee et al. 2003; Lord 2002; Hauer 1988 etc) were also investigated in this project with the aim of using the best model form for the data.

The functional form is by no means a simple selection from already built ones, even though those are helpful. In engineering practice, common sense plays a vital role. The developed model with its estimated parameters must adhere to common knowledge. For example if one were to develop an SPF for a roadway segment, the parameter estimated for the road length will have to be positive to adhere to common knowledge that a longer roadway segment is more likely to have more crashes than a shorter one. This type o f reasoning was adopted in developing SPFs for this thesis.

Once parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood approach, their statistical significance was checked. A 5% significance level was used to validate the statistical significance o f each parameter in the models.

51

Two other statistics were used to evaluate the goodness-fit (GOF) statistics for models: 1. The Deviance/(n-p) - this measure is ratio of the deviance of the full model to the degrees of fireedom, n-p. The value of this ratio serves as a gauge o f the dispersion of the data. 2. The Pearson Chi-Statistic - this hieasure is the ratio of the Pearson Chi-Statistic to the degree o f freedom. The underlying theory for these two statistics was developed by McCullah and Nelder (1989). In theory, both measures should be close to 1 if a model was to be considered adequate. However, safety analysts (Bauer and Harwood 1996) suggest that if the

Pearson Chi-Statistic is somewhere in the range of 0.8 to 1.2, the models should still be considered as a well fitted model to the data.

Another method used in this report to assess GOF is the CURE (cumulative residuals) plot developed by Hauer and Bamfo (1997). The method consists of three plots; 1. The plot of the cumulative residuals (difference of the actual and predicted accident for each entity) against each variable separately. residual is sorted in increasing order. 2. The +2a and -2a plots. The parameter a signifies the standard deviation For a model to have a good fit under the CURE method, the plot in 1 (preceding point) should oscillate around the value of 0 and within the two standard deviation boundaries. For instance, Figures 3.4 and 3.5 illustrate the essence of the CURE plots. The cure plots developed in Figures 3.4 and 3.5 were from an SPF developed from California rural intersections (same data used in this thesis). The model form used for this illustration is E{K}=a(Major AADT)^^(Minor AADT)^^ . Figure 3.4 illustrate the plot of the major AADT variable while Figure 3.5 illustrates the plot of the minor AADT variable. The cumulative

Both plots depict a constant oscillation of the cumulative residuals around zero which was also bounded within the 2 standard deviations limits. Since the plot was bounded within the 2 a limits, the functional form and its estimated parameters are judged as being from a well fitted model. The main advantage of the CURE plot against conventional GOF measures (level o f significance, Pearson Chi-Statistic etc) is that safety analysts can examine how well the model fits the independent variables along the entire range o f its values. As in our case (Figure 3.4) it shows that the model does not estimate the

expected accident frequency well when the major AADT is larger than 20,000. For the minor AADT variable, the model had the same problem of poor performance when the

54

AADT range is greater than 7,000. For a more detailed description o f the method, see Hauer and Bamfo (1997).

Database Used

"

The ftmdamental objective o f this study was to quantity the safety effects of installing a traffic signal at rural intersections using the Empirical Bayes (EB) and conventional methodologies. To achieve this, appropriate treated sites were retrieved firom the

Highway Safety Information Systems (HSIS) database for two states, California and Minnesota.

4.1

California

There were 28 intersections with 10 years (1993 - 2002) of data, that were converted fi'om stop to signal control in the California database and the treatmentsites were

disaggregated into three categories: 1. Three-legged with 2 lanes on the major approach (4 sites), 2. Four-legged with 2 lanes on the major approach (12 sites), and 3. Four-legged with 4 lanes on the major approach (10 sites). This data is summarized in Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

The California and Minnesota database both followed the KABCO severity scale (Council et al. 2005). The KABCO severity scale is used by police officers at the scene o f a crash to categorise injury severity as either K (killed), A (disabling injury), B (evident injury), C (possible injury) or O (no apparent injury). In this study, K, A, B and C severity were aggregated and referred to as injury severity due to very sparse K and A level severities in both data sets which resulted in poorly fitted regression models for the disaggregated severities.

The following three reference populations were compiled for the treated intersections in the California database: 1. Three-legged with 2 lanes on the major approach (1405 sites)^ 2. Four-legged with 2 lanes on the major approach (726 sites), and 3. Four-legged with 4 lanes on the major approach (183 sites). Tables 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 summarize the basic information used in calibrating SPFs for the three reference groups.

Exploratory Analyses of the Data

The reference populations for both California and Minnesota data were examined to reveal frequency distributions and possible functional forms before any form o f regression analysis was attempted. Frequency plots were developed for total crashes after which the shape of the plots was used to attest possible probability distributions (Bauer and Hardwood 1998).

The shape o f the frequency distributions in Figures 4.4 through 4.8 exhibits a left skewed distribution, indicative of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution, according to Bauer and Harwood (1998). Validating this assumption is only possible if the probability

distribution is fitted to the data (reference population). For instance, using California's three-legged intersection reference group (Figure 4.4), it was assumed that the crashes follows both a Poisson and a negative binomial distribution and the probability distribution was estimated for illustration purposes.

67

4.4.2 Probability distribution 4.4.2.1 Assuming the Poisson distribution

The Poisson distribution is expressed mathematically as:

/(>-,,«) =
where yj = number of crashes an entity is likely to experience; y, = 0 ,1 ,2 , Pi = expected number of crashes at entity `i' in a given time interval

( 4 .1)

The mean and variance of a Poisson distribution are same; that is E(yi) = Pd = VAR(yi). If the expected accident is computed, the probability y, of having a crash at entity `i' can be estimated. Table 4.11 (Column 5) shows the distribution of the crashes in the reference population under the Poisson distribution. Column 6 of Table 4.11 gives the number o f sites that would likely have the number of crashes specified in Column 2. If the reference population followed the Poisson distribution, the quantities in Columns 1 and 6 should be similar (relatively close) and in this case it is not true. The difference between the actual number of sites (Column 1) and the estimated number of sites (Column 6) is quite large, which implies that the crash counts in this particular reference group did not follow a Poisson distribution. Another means of judging if a specific probability distribution is adequate for the data is to compare the plot of the specified probability distribution against the plot of frequency distribution. Figure 4.9 shows the Poisson probability distribution of the crashes in the reference population for three-legged intersections with two lanes on the major approach. The shape o f Figure 4.4 (fi-equency distribution of the reference group) is not even close to that in Figure 4.9 (Poisson probability distribution of crashes). Therefore it would be

68

safe to assume that the Poisson distribution is not adequate in describing the outcomes (crashes) for this reference population.

4.4.2.2

Assuming the Negative Binomial distribution

The negative binomial distribution is defined mathematically according to Equation 3.40 in Chapter 3. As in the preceding case, if the expected accident and variance is

computed, the probability y, o f having a crash at entity `i ' can be estimated. Table 4.11 illustrates the calculations based on the negative binomial distribution. Clearly one can see that the NB distribution is a more reliable probability distribution o f the accident counts since the calculated numbers of intersections (sites) in Column 3 are very close to the numbers in the actual data (Colunm 1). As with the Poisson case, comparing the frequency plot (Figure 4.4) to the probability distribution plot can also serve as an indicator o f adequacy for the assumed probability distribution. Comparing the shape of Figures 4.4 and 4.10, a distinct similarity emerges. This implies that the NB distribution is quite reasonable for describing the probability o f a crash in this reference population.

Possible Functional forms of Regression Models using the ID method

After determining the probability distribution o f the accident counts for the reference population, the next step in the exploratory analyses was regression analysis using the GLM procedures. The SAS GENMOD (SAS V8) procedure was used to develop models with various functional forms and the Integrate Differentiate (ID) method developed by Hauer and Bamfo (1997) was used to explore potential functional forms. Also, models developed from previous research (McGee et al. 2003; Lord 2002; Hauer 1988 etc) were also considered during this stage. Using the ID method, the EIF plots for all five o f the reference groups (3 for California and 2 for Minnesota) were explored for various functional forms. For instance, using the California's four-legged intersection with 2

lanes on the major approach, the EIF plots were developed using major and minor AADT as the independent variables (Figures 4.11 and 4.12).

A fter the EIF plots were developed, they were compared to pre-established plots for specific fimctional forms, such as those in Figure 3.3. Because o f the similarity o f

Figures 4.11 and 4.12 to the power function (left hand side) o f Figure 3.3, the functional form selected is shown in Equation 4.2. Accident / year = a {^Major A A D T i ^ M i n o r A A D T ) (4.2)

To summarize, the following two exploratory analyses were performed on each data set: 1. Frequency distributions were developed for each crash types, and 2. EIF plots on each data set were developed to select an initial functional form. After perform ing these two exploratory analyses, the SPFs can then be calibrated for each data set and this calibration process is presented in the next chapter.

73

CHAPTER 5: Calibrated Safety Performance Functions
SPFs were developed using the SAS GENMOD (SAS V8) procedure for which the negative binomial error distribution was assumed. Explanatory variables considered

included AADT, number o f lanes, lane width, turning lanes (left or right), lighting, etc. However, after several attempts with various logical variables, only the AADT set o f variables (Major and Minor AADT) was found to be statistically significant, which resulted in SPFs consisting o f only AADT variables. Even so, opting to use AADT alone was not a simple task because several functional forms (with AADT alone) were possible and CURD plots proposed by Hauer and Bamfo (1997), which were introduced in Chapter 3 , had to be used to decide on the best form.

5.1

California SPFs

SPFs were developed for all severity levels (Total, Injury and PDO) and for each crash type defined in Chapter 4. Therefore, with three severity levels and four crash types (all, right-angle, left turn and rear end) 12 models were calibrated for each reference group, resulting in 36 models developed for the three California reference groups. Tables 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 summarize the SPFs for the "3-legged intersections with 2 lanes on the major approach" reference group. Summaries for the SPFs o f "4-legged intersections with 2 lanes on the major approach" are in Tables 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, while Tables 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9 summarize the SPFs for "4-legged intersections with 4 lanes on the major approach".

Minnesota SPFs

The SPFs for Minnesota were developed using a similar approach as for the California SPFs in terms o f severity levels (Total, Injury and PDO), and for each crash types defined in Chapter 4. Therefore, with three severity levels and four crash types (all, ri^ t-a n g le , left turn and rear end) 12 models were calibrated for each reference group. However, the Minnesota dataset consists o f only 2 reference groups, implying that 24 models were developed in total. Tables 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12 summarize the SPFs for the "3-legged intersections" reference group, while Tables 5.13, 5.14 and 5.15 summarize the SPFs for the "4-legged intersections" reference group.

Goodness-of-Fit of the SPFs

During the calibration of the SPFs, the goodness-of-fit measures discussed in Chapter 3 were all assessed to ensure the m odels' adequacy. For most o f the SPFs the Pearson ChiStatistic divided by its degree o f freedom (%^/DOF) and the deviance divided its degree o f freedom (Dev/DOF) for each o f the models were close to 1, indicating good fit to their respective data (MaCullagh and Nelder 1989) or within the range o f 0.8 - 1.2 deemed acceptable by Bauer and Harwood (1996). However, this ratio was not within the

acceptable range for a few models simply because the sample sizes for those crash types were relatively small. Another method o f assessing the goodness-of-fit o f the SPFs is by the dispersion parameter. The variance o f the expected accident frequency at any

particular site in a reference group is computed using the following equation: \2 VAR{k} = ^ ^ ^ ^ b

(5.1)

where parameter `b ' is the inverse o f the dispersion parameter from the SAS GENMOD procedure. Therefore, the larger the dispersion parameter is, the smaller will be the

variance o f the expected accident frequency and hence a better model. Using this 80

goodness o f fit criterion, models with the largest possible dispersion param eter (equation 5.1) were selected for this study.

T he CURE plots for each model were also developed to supplement the decision in selecting the best `fitting' SPF. Figures 5.1 to 5.6 are the CURE plots o f total crashes for all severitie for California. The complete set o f CURE plots developed for all SPFs is show n in Appendix B.

The models for total crashes in the California reference populations seem to have a good fit o f the data. The CURE plots for each o f the independent variables (major and minor AADT) seem to oscillate around zero (0) and finish around zero (0). This implies (Hauer and Bamfo 1997) that the model using the major and minor AADT as independent variables fit the data well. Cumulative residuals plots did cross the minus 2 standard deviation boundaries in Figures 5.4 and 5.6, indicating some inadequacy in the model to estimate at large major and minor AADTs. However, there could be a simpler

explanation than inadequacy o f the model; there are only 8 sites out o f 743 with major AADT larger than 20,000 and only 2 sites with minor AADT larger than 7000, and, therefore, the problem may lie with the small sample size for these AADT ranges. These calibrated SPFs were then used in the safety estimation procedures which are presented next.

CHAPTER 6:

Safety Effects Estimation

T he safety effects o f installing traffic signals at rural intersections were quantified b y using both the conventional and EB procedures with the treated intersections considered as a com posite entity (Hauer 1997). The concept o f a composite entity is quite simple. In Chapter 3 two fundamental questions needed to be answered before one can quantify the safety effects o f a particular treatment: 1. W hat is the safety o f the entity in the after period had the treatment not been im plem ented, n? and 2. W hat is the safety after the treatment was implemented X? The safety effect estimation methodologies introduced in Chapter 3 (conventional and EB) used n and X to only quantifying safety effects at a single entity. However, m ore than one treated entity is usually used before inferences can be m ade on a particular treatm ent. Therefore, in the composite entity, treated sites, that is:
k

and X are aggregated over the entire set

w here the num ber o f sites in the composite entity is n. The variances o f the com posite entity are estimated similarly:

and T C sumin

(6-3) (6.4)

The rudiments o f both conventional the EB methodology remains unchanged when using a composite entity, because the composite entity uses the end products o f these methods, that is n and X. Therefore, using treated intersections from California and Minnesota as one composite entity, the following safety effects were quantified using both the conventional and EB methodology.

6.1

Results for the Conventional Methods

To recap, the conventional methods applied in this study were; 1. The simple Before-After Naive, 2. The Before-After Naive procedure with the correction for traffic flow, and 3. The Before-After Naive procedure using the SPFs.

The conventional methods reveal that after a rural stop controlled intersection is converted to a signalized intersection, there will be a reduction in `all', `right-angle' and `left-tum ' crash types for all severity levels (Total, Injury, and PDO). Rear-end crash effects on the other hand were mixed. For the simple Naïve procedure, rear-end crashes were estimated to increase for all severity levels and for the "Naïve with `trafSc flow' correction procedure", rear-end crashes only increased for `total' and `PD O' severity after a signal was installed. The direction o f the safety estimate for rear-end crashes was also mixed when the Naïve with `SPF' procedure was used; however, only the PD O ' severity level showed a very small increase.

Another noticeable trend in the results is visible if the safety effects for each conventional method, for each crash type and severity level, are compared to each other. For `all', `right-angle' and `left-tum' crash types, the "Naive with SPF" gives the highest gain in estimating safety, followed by the "Naive with traffic correction" and the simple Naïve methods. The same trend is visible for rear-end crashes. This trend is attributable to the underlying assumptions for each methodology.

The simple Naïve procedure assumes that the before period crash counts is the expected crash count in the after period had a signal not been installed. The problem with this method is that one cannot attribute the change in the crash frequencies to the treatment alone. Other factors such as regression-to-the-mean, traffic volume changes and accident trend could have contributed to the change, since all o f these factors affect safety (Persaud 2001). Therefore, the estimated percent change in crashes given in Table 6.1

90

cannot entirely be attributed to installing signals alone as implied in the sim ple Naïve procedure.

T he N aïve w ith `traffic flow' and `SPF' is somewhat more precise (Hauer 1997) in that traffic flow during the before and after period is accounted for. However, the "Naïve w ith traffic flow correction" simply uses the ratio o f the average after period AA DT to before period AADT in accounting for traffic flow in its estimate o f safety in after period had the signal not been installed. On the other hand, the "Naïve with SPF" uses the same ratio b u t here the ratio is the SPF estimate o f the expected crashes in the after period to that for the before period, not necessarily assuming a linear crash-traffic relationship as the "N aïve with traffic flow correction" method does.

The trend in the safety effects among the Naïve procedures expressed previously can be attributed to the effect o f the AADT since the treated entities exhibits an increasing trend in A A D T firom the before to the after period (Tables 4.1 through 4.5, Chapter 4). A higher A A D T in the after period implies that the estimate o f expected crashes in the after period had the treatment not been implemented, n, will be larger. This is simply because the ratio o f traffic flows is larger than 1 and since this ratio serves as a multiplicative correction for AADT (Hauer 1997), n will in turn be larger than in the simple Naïve procedure. Therefore, with a larger value for n, the index o f effectiveness (Equation 3.5, C hapter 3) will be smaller than in the simple Naïve procedure.

91

One other interesting aspect is the difference between the safety effects for the "Naïve with `traffic flow' correction" and the "Naïve with `SPF'". A larger safety gain was estimated using the Naïve with `SPF' procedure simply because the ratio o f the expected crashes in the after to before period is quantified by a non-linear crash-traffic flow relationship, i.e., by a non-linear nature o f SPF (Figure 3.1, depicts a typical example.). Under this assumption, with larger AADTs in the after period with respect to the before period, the ratio o f expected crashes before to after will be larger than the ratio under the linear crash-traffic flow assumption o f the "Naïve with traffic flow correction" method. However, because the relationship between crash frequency and AADT is non-linear, this ratio will in turn be larger than in the "Naïve with traffic correction". Assuming that the "Naïve with SPF" procedure gives a better estimate o f the safety effects o f installing a signal, there are still several factors that are not considered such as regression-to-the-mean and trends in the crashes due to a variety o f factors. Therefore, the safety effects are still not without its bias under the three conventional approaches. However, with the aid of the empirical Bayes (EB) procedure (which accounts for all those factors), the bias in the safety effects would be eliminated. The EB results are presented next.

The safety effects for all severity levels (Total, Injury, and PDO) using the Empirical Bayes procedure on the composite entity o f California and Minnesota is given in Table 6.4. The results reveal that by installing a signal, `all', `right-angle', and `left-tum '

These directional effects are in complete agreement with those from the simple Naive procedure. However, the effects for the other two forms of the Naïve procedure and the EB are only in agreement for total, right-angle and left-tum crashes for all severity levels. For rear-end crash effects, the other two forms of the Naïve procedure show a reduction b. in rear-end crashes for injury crashes after a signal is installed, thus yielding mixed results when compared to the EB effects.

In terms o f percentage change in crashes the EB results showed a higher safety gain when compared to the simple Naïve estimate, but a smaller gain than the Naïve with 'traffic correction' and `SPF' procedures. These differences in percentage changes and patterns can be directly attributed to the assumptions governing each procedure.

The larger safety effect for the EB compared to the simple Naïve can be attributed to the fact that the simple Naïve procedure fails to account for the safety impact o f increase in AADT in the after period compared to the before period, while the EB does. The other two forms o f the Naïve procedure (traffic flow and SPF) improved on this shortcoming o f the simple Naive procedure by accounting for AADT. The question is why these other

94

tw o N aïve procedures estimated a larger safety gain than the EB procedure, since b y accounting for AADT, one would have expected that the percentage change in crashes w ould have been in closer agreement to the EB estimate. This question can be answered b y the noting that the Naïve procedures, including these two, all fail to account for regression to the mean, which would cause them to overestimated safety gains.

Disaggregate EB estimates

T he com posite entity o f California and M innesota consisted o f 45 treated intersections com prising o f 39 four-legged and 6 three-legged intersections. By evaluating groups o f sim ilar variables, useful inferences can be made about the safety effects after a signal is installed. Tables 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8 give the EB estimates o f the safety effect b y Three legged-

intersections w ere not disaggregated in smaller groups because o f its small sam ple size. B ased on the disaggregate results for the 4-legged intersections after a signal is installed, total crashes for right-angle and left-tum types for total severity (See Table 6.6) w ould b e reduced w hile rear-end crashes increase. This pattern is similar to the aggregate EB

effect. How ever, there was a mixture o f safety effects based on the different levels at w hich the variables were disaggregated. For example, under total severity for all ranges o f A A D T tested, a reduction in the total crashes always existed, but for injury crashes w ith A A D T < 10,000 and PDO crashes with AADT > 20,000, an increase in crashes was observed after a signal was installed. This increase in injury crashes for AA DT < 10,000 is in conform ance w ith findings by Persaud et al. (1997) where traffic signals w ere rem oved at low ranges o f AADT to reverse this undesirable safety effect. Therefore

95

signalizing intersections with AADT < 10,000 might have an adverse effect on injury accidents.

An interesting finding was observed in the safety effects between California and
M innesota w hen considering PDO crashes (See Table 6.8) from the disaggregate analysis. W hen taking California alone into consideration, the results revealed that there w ill b e an increase in PDO crashes after a signal was installed w hile M innesota experienced a reduction for this crash severity type. This difference in safety effect could b e related to how PDO crashes are considered by the two states. PDO crashes reports are usually based on dollar value o f damages sustained and m ost likely California and M innesota could have been using different threshold values for reporting these crashes. T his issue is also exhibited for rear-end PDO severity crashes for which California is estim ating a reduction in crashes in contrast to the increase for Minnesota.

Empirical Bayes with Proportional SPFs

; :v 3 ;

The need for and functionality of SPFs is a very important component in an EB study. However, SPFs are sometimes impossible to calibrate due to small sample sizes that usually lead to poorly fitted SPFs, or simply because it can be extremely time consuming. In such situations, another form of SPFs, referred to as proportional SPFs, is usually developed (Persaud et al. 2005). This method simply applies a factor (proportion) to the SPF for total accidents to estimate the accidents for a specific crash type. For instance, assuming that the total accident SPF for a particular intersection is o f the form: Total Accident / year = a {Total Entering A AD TY (6.5)

To illustrate, suppose one needs to calibrate an SPF for left-turning accidents, but the actual dataset is insufficient for calibrating a statistically significant model; therefore under the proportional SPF approach, a factor (proportion o f total accidents that are lefttum accidents) is applied to Equation 6.5: Left --Turn Accident / year = {FACTOR) a {Total Entering AAD T Y (6.6)

To assess the validity of this approximation to calibrating SPFs, this method was used to develop secondary Injury and PDO severity crash type SPFs for the California and Minnesota reference groups. The total severity SPFs were used, analogous to Equation 6.5. These SPFs were then applied to the EB procedure to test the difference between the results so obtained and the EB results with SAS directly calibrated SPFs for the specific crash type. Dispersion parameters for the proportion SPFs were estimated by using a maximum likelihood software procedure. A summary o f the California proportional

98

SPFs for Injury and PDO severity is given in Tables 6,9, 6.10 and 6.11. Tables 6.12 and 6.13 give the sum m ary for the M innesota proportion SPFs for Injury and PDO.

T he results for the EB analysis using the proportional SPFs are given in Table 6.14. C om paring these result with those o f the EB study using SAS calibrated SPFs (Table 6.4), sm all differences between the percent changes in crashes were observed in general. The only m arked difference is for the PDO and Injury estimates for rear-end crashes. For this particular dataset, it can, therefore, be concluded that in general valid EB results can b e obtained by using simpler proportional SPFs. This is a useful conclusion in the light o f the difficulties that are typical in obtaining sufficient reference group data for the direct calibration o f SPFs.

Economic Analysis

Based on the results o f the safety effects analysis, no definitive claim can be made about the overall safety effect for the implementation of traffic signals since the results show that this treatment will reduce right-angle accidents, but increase rear-end crashes. The question is whether the increase in rear-end crashes will negate the benefits gained from the reduction o f the right-angle crashes. This question can be addressed by an examination o f the economic costs for the two crash types, base on severity levels (injury and non-injury). Council et al. (2005) did a similar economic analysis after they found that rear end crashes will tend to increase, and right angle accidents decrease, after red light cameras are installed at a signalized intersection. The same procedure was adopted in this study.

To apply the procedure, the economic cost per crash was needed for the right-angle, rearend and "other" crash types. The crash type `other' is simply the difference between the total crash and the sum o f the right-angle and left-tum crashes. Crash costs were

developed in the U.S. for each o f the KABCO severity level (Council, Eduard, Miller and Persaud 2005) for rural and urban intersections by control type. The distinction between urban and rural crash cost was made solely on the posted speed. Intersections with main road posted speeds higher than 50mph (80 km/h) were considered rural whereas those with speed limits lower than 45 mph (72 km/h) were considered as urban.

Council et al. (2005) developed two types of crash cost - human capital costs and comprehensive costs. The human capital cost is simply the actual dollar value incurred for each severity, whereas the comprehensive costs is the sum o f the human capital cost

102

and cost for loss o f quality o f life for the two severities (K+A+B+C, and O). This study used the comprehensive cost for the economic analysis, following Council et al. Section 7.1 gives a synopsis o f the procedure.

7.1

Methodology for Economic Analysis

T he EB calculations were done for each crash types (right-angle, rear-end and other). C rash types w ere further sub-divided into two severity groups, injury (K+A+B+C) AnH PD O (O). Then, following Council et al. (2005) the EB crash estimates were used w ith the follow ing costs to perform the analysis:

^costA~ cost o f crashes that occurred after the treatment was installed.

This cost is

sim ply the count o f crashes in the after period m ultiplied by the corresponding unit comprehensive crash cost for the crash type and severity at rural signalized intersections. VAR^AcostA)~ variance o f the crash costs in the after period. Each unit crash cost The

developed by Council et al. 2005) has a corresponding standard error.

variance is simply computed as the square o f the standard error m ultiplied b y the count o f after period crashes. ^costA ^ cost o f crashes in the after period had there been no treatment. The estim ation o f this cost accounts for RTM, traffic volume trend and other factors. This

param eter is the product o f EB estimate o f tc (the crashes expected in the after period without treatment) and the corresponding unit comprehensive cost for the crash type and severity at rural stop controlled intersections.

103

'

= variance o f the crashes in the after period had no signal been installed. Similar to above, the standard error o f the unit crash cost was used to calculate the variance, which was then multiplied by EB estimate o f n (the crashes expected in the after period without treatment).

The parameters listed above were aggregated over the treatment sites for both severity groups, (K+A+B+C, and O or, simply, injury and PDO), giving an aggregated economic cost with the change in crash cost given by Equation 7.1 :

Estimates of Economic Effects of Installing Traffic Signals

T able 7.1 gives the estimate o f the unit comprehensive crash cost for each crash type and severity. U nit crash costs for "other" is the same as the crash cost for right-angle

accidents due to recommendation m ade by Council et al. (2005).

T he EB estim ates o f the economic effect o f crashes for each crash type are show n in T ables 7.2 and 7.3. As noted earlier, the objective for this economic assessm ent was to see i f the increase in rear-end accidents after a signal was installed will offset the benefits gained fi-om the reduction o f right-angle accidents. If all accidents are considered (injury and non-injury) the results (Table 7.2) show a positive aggregate econom ic benefit o f $155,883,978 w hich represents a 69 percent reduction in cost over the 45 treated sites. T he results for the injury crashes only (Table 7.3) show a benefit o f $157,280,562, representing a 71 percent reduction in cost. Note the benefit is aggregated over the 45 sites w ith a total o f 253 years o f data in the after period. To get a better perspective on

105

the reduction in crash cost it would be prudent to estimate the benefit per site-year. These results are: 1. If Injury and PDO accidents are considered together, the reduction in accident costs is (155,883,978)7(253) = $616,142 per site-year. 2. If PDO crashes are not considered, the reduction in accident costs is (157,280,562)7 (253) = $621,662 per site.

T he econom ic analysis shows a positive gain in cost even after considering the increase in rear end crashes after a signal was installed, so it was useful for this purpose alone. The aggregation o f economic costs also allowed for an evaluation o f the change in crash costs for various disaggregated groups such as those based on before period AADT, on crash levels, and on intersection geometry. For instance, the disaggregated EB econom ic effects for the 4-legged intersections are shown in Tables 7.4. The results for the 3-

Icgged intersections are based on a small sample size and were not disaggregated.

T he disaggregated economic analysis for the 4-legged intersections revealed positive econom ic effects for all classes o f intersections with small standard errors. That is `0 ' w as less than 1 for all disaggregated levels implying a reduction in total crash cost for each level. Therefore, the following inferences were possible: 1. A net gain in economic benefit was achieved for the entire range o f A A D T used after a signal is installed. However, there is an apparent pattern in the percent decrease in crash cost at various AADT levels. Intersections with A A D T less

than 10,000 experienced the smallest economic gain but an increase in the econom ic gain was observed for AADTs within a range o f 10,000 to 20,000. H ow ever, the economic gain then subsides for AADT greater than 20,000? 2. A large economic gain was observed after signalization for total and injury severity crash frequencies larger than 5 per year during the before period. PDO crashes w ere not considered in this analysis because o f inconsistent reporting o f these crashes types.

107

3. Major approaches with 2 or 4 lanes experience approximately the same economic gain. 4. Intersections from California and Minnesota exhibited substantial economic gain as both separate entities and together (as one composite entity). An interesting observation is the difference between the percent decrease in crash cost for "injury and PDO" and injury alone; the difference for Minnesota is quite small compared to that for California. This anomaly can be attributed to the difference in reporting PDO crashes in each of the States. It is believed that California tends to severely underreport PDO crashes.

Conclusions

T his study w as prim arily focused on estimating the safety effects after traffic signals are installed at stop controlled rural intersections. Use was m ade o f both the conventional and the Em pirical Bayes (EB) procedures. The conventional procedures consisted o f the

"sim ple before-after Naïve", "Naive with traffic flow correction", and "N aive w ith safety perform ance functions" methods. Data from 45 treated intersections located in California and M innesota, in the US (28 from California and 17 from Minnesota) were used in this research to execute various analyses.

B oth the conventional and the EB methods revealed a reduction in right-angle and left turn crashes and an increase in rear-end crashes after signals were installed. However, as expected the percent changes in crashes were quite different for each m ethod, w hich is m ainly due differences in underlying assumptions. The results are generally

substantiated b y similar findings revealed by a comprehensive literature review. Thus, it can b e concluded that safety analysts should expect similar changes in crashes to those found w henever the implementation o f traffic signals at stop controlled rural intersections is contemplated.

R esults obtained from the EB procedure showed that "all", right angle and left turn crashes o f all severities combined were reduced by 38%, 74% and 60% respectively, w hile an 85% increase w as observed in rear-end crashes.

109

Clearly the percent changes in crashes estimated using the EB method should not be used alone in justifying the need for a signal since the increase in rear-end crashes has the potential to offset benefits obtained from a reduction in right-angle and left-tum crashes after a signal was installed. An economic analysis performed on accident types and

severities after treatment (See Chapter 7) addressed the issue of whether the increase in rear-end crashes will offset the safety gained from the reduction of right-angle accidents. The results obtained from this analysis (Tables 7.3 and 7.4) show that even allowing for the increase in rear-end crashes after signals were installed, the overall economic effect achieved was quite positive.

In terms o f dollar value, the economic analysis of the 45 treated sites shows that, after installation o f the signals, the aggregated crash costs when considering both injury and non-injury crashes were reduced by $155,883,978 site year. This works out to an

approximate reduction of $616,142 per site year. The reduction for injury crash costs alone amounted to about $157,280,562 per site year, which is an approximate reduction o f $621,662 per site-year. Therefore, it can be concluded that after signalizing stop

controlled rural intersections a definite increase in the overall safety at these intersections could be expected. This benefit is likely to outweigh by far the capital and maintenance costs o f installing a traffic signal. It should be noted, however, that these benefits carmot be extrapolated to signalizing any intersection, since the installations evaluated in this study were most likely "warranted".
