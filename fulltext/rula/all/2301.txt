NATURAL FREQUENCIES OF A MANIPULATOR WITH RIGID TIP ^lASS: THE CASE OF FLEXURAL-FLEXURALTORSIONAL COUPLING

Mohammad Arshad
Master of Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering RYERSON UNIVERSITY, Canada, 2004

Abstract
The characteristic (or frequency) equation of a flexible manipulator with a rigid tip mass is derived. The manipulator is modeled as an Euler-Bemoulli beam and it permits flexural (bending) detormation in two planes and torsional deformation. The position of the centroid o f the tip mass may not necessarily be coincident with the elastic axis of the beam. This is represented by the use of offset coordinates. The natural frequencies of the manipulator are obtained by solving the characteristic equation. The results are compared to the results in the literature, where possible, and also to those obtained using a commercial finite element software ANSYS. The effects of the magnitude of the tip load, offset of the tip mass centre of gravity from its point of attachment, the length of the beam and slenderness ratio on the natural frequencies are examined.

Chapter 1 1.0 Introduction
Flexural-torsional coupled vibration of a rotating structure can occur in many engineering applications such as turbo machinery blades, slewing robot amis, aircraft propellers, helicopter rotor blades, spacecraft antennae, spinning spacecraft, gun barrels and subsystems o f more complex structures. To design these systems, the dynamic characteristic, especially near the resonant condition, needs to be well examined to ensure safe operation. Hence, the determination o f the natural frequencies is of fundamental importance. Flexural-torsional coupled vibration occurs when the centroidal and the shear center of the cross sections o f the beam are not coincident. This lack o f coincidence is observed when the beam has fewer than two axes of symmetry or has anisotropy in the material. This makes the torsional axis different from the elastic axis and thus couples torsional vibration with flexural vibration. Flexural-torsional coupled vibration is also observed in a cantilevered beam with a tip mass when the centroid of the tip mass is not coincident with the elastic axis of the beam. This is the scenario o f interest in this project. Beams are often idealized as one-dimensional structural elements. In reality, however, all structures are three-dimensional bodies with every point in the structure, if not restrained, capable of displacement along any three mutually perpendicular directions. Hence, the goal in beam models is the reduction of the various three-dimensional properties into one dimension. An exact formulation o f the beam problem in terms of general elasticity equations is presented in Ref. [1]. However, it is generally difficult to solve the full problem and approximate solutions for transverse displacement are usually sufficient in most applications. The natural frequencies of a manipulator are obtained by modeling the manipulator as a beam. The Euler-Bemoulli beam theory is assumed to be adequate to model the manipulator. The cantilevered beam is also assumed to experience small torsional deformation and planar elastic bending deformation in two directions (i.e., in XY and XZ planes, respectively) and warping effects are ignored. The centre of gravity of the rigid tip mass is not coincident with the point o f attachment and Hamilton's principle is used to derive the system governing equations. A close-form expression of the characteristic (frequency) equation is derived and this is solved by using root finding techniques in MATLAB. The main advantage of a close-

form solution is that it readily highlights the "interdependencies of design variables or parameters that otherwise may not be discernable from numerical analyses" [2]. The results are compared to those in the literature and to results obtained using the ANSYS finite element software. The results show that the system natural frequency is dependent on many parameters such as magnitude o f tip mass load, offset of the tip mass centre o f gravity with point of attachment with beam, the length of the beam, the slenderness ratio and the bending stiffness and torsional rigidity o f the beam. The results are tabulated in order to allow computational comparison and presented graphically to provide a snapshot o f the influence of the abovementioned factors.

Chapter 2 2.0 Literature Review
The large amount o f literature in the field of beam vibrations makes it almost impossible to list all. An attempt is, however, made here to mention the necessary and relevant articles and books in order to give an insight into the research done on the subject. In the early study o f beams, bending was identified as the single most important factor in a transversely vibrating beam. This forms the basis of the Euler-Bemoulli beam theory [1]. It is the most commonly used theory because of its simplicity and its ability to provide reasonable engineering approximations to many problems. However, the theory does not provide good estimates o f higher mode natural frequencies and of the natural frequencies of non-slender (i.e., thick and stout) beams, which are susceptible to shear. Other theories have been proposed to overcome these limitations. These include Rayleigh beam theory [3] and Timoshenko beam theory [4] and [5]. The Rayleigh Beam theory includes rotation effects, while the Timoshenko beam theory includes both the rotation and the shear effects. The latter gives better approximations for higher-mode responses and non-slender beams. The development and analysis of these beam theories are reviewed in the next section.

2.1 Basic Beam Theories
There are four basic beam theories: Euler-Bemoulli, Rayleigh, shear and Timoshenko beam theories. The common assumptions are 1. One dimension (the longitudinal direction) is considerably larger than the other two. 2. The material is linear elastic (Hookean). 3. The Poisson effect is neglected. 4. The cross-sectional area is symmetric so that the neutral and centroidal a^es coincide. 5. The angle o f rotation is small so that the small angle assumption can be used.

2.1.1 Euier-Bernoulli Beam Theory:
The simplest beam theory is the Euler-Bemoulli Beam theory which ignores both the rotary inertia and shear effects. A schematic of a cantilevered beam in transverse vibration (deflection, v(x, t ) , is in the y direction) is shown in Fig.2.1 [6 ],

2.1.3 Shear Beam Model:
The shear beam model adds the effect of shear distortion to the Euler-Bemoulli model. It is safe to ignore the shear deformation as long as the width and thickness of the beam are small compared with the length of the beam. As the beam becomes shorter, the effects of shear deformation become evident. An element of such a beam is shown in Fig. 2.2 [6], which is a repeat of the element dx of Fig. 2.1 with shear deformation included. In the figure below, the line OA is a line through the center of the element dx and normal to the face at the right side. The line OB, on the other hand, is the line through the tangent to the centerline of the beam. While the line OC is the centerline of the undeformed beam. The shear angle represents the effect of shear deformation. The total rotation of the cross section is the sum of the rotation due to the bending moment, y, and the angle of distortion due to shear, a , and it is appro; mated by the first derivative of deflection.

Note that these equations are the same as those for the shear beam model, i.e., Eq. (2.23). The results for beam vibrations with classical boundary conditions and no attachments are presented in many standard textbooks on vibration such as Ref. [6]. The effect o f end mass or tip load on the natural frequencies of beams has been investigated by numerous researchers. Goel [8] models tip load as a point mass and the beam by Euler-Bemoulli beam theory. Laura et al. [9] use the same approach and determined natural frequencies and modal shapes of a cantilevered beam which carries a finite mass at its free end. Bruch and Mitchell [10] examine the effects of rotary inertia and shear deformation of a flexible robot arm that is modeled as a cantilever Timoshenko beam. The tip load is modeled as a rigid mass with moment of inertia about the axis of bending of the beam. They observe that the "frequencies decrease with increasing mass ratio (tip mass/beam mass) for a fixed ratio, cr (radius o f gyration of the tip mass/beam length). The same is true for a fixed mass ratio and increasing c ." White and Heppler [11] generalize the study by presenting a generalized frequency equation for the Timoshenko beam. They present ar: exact closed form expression of the frequency equation, mode shapes and the orthogonality condition for a freefree beam with payloads at the free ends, but ignore torsional deformation and the offset of centre of gravity of payload. Low [12] uses Euler-Bemoulli beam theory to model a rotating beam and examines the effect of hub inertia and mass load on its vibration. The natural frequencies are observed to decrease with increasing hub inertia. Oguamanam et al. [13] consider the case of a two link flexible Euler-Bemoulli beam system with one end clamped and a point mass at the free end.

Hamilton's principle is used to derive equations of motion. The frequency equation, mode shapes and the orthogonality condition are also presented along with numerical examples. Bhat and Wagner [14] determined the natural frequencies of a uniform cantilever beam with a tip mass whose centre of gravity is not coincident with the point of attachment to the beam. This work is further extended by To [15] to include base excitation effects on natural frequencies and mode shapes. The case of a non-uniform cross-sectional beam is examined by Laura and Gutierrez [16]. Storch and Gates [17] examine transverse vibration and buckling of a cantilevered beam subjected to constant longitudinal acceleration with rigid tip mass. Two possible locations of the tip mass mass center are investigated: when the mass center is located along the beam tip tangent line, and when mass center is arbitrarily offset with respect to the beam attachment point (but not l>4ng along the beam tip tangent line). In the former case, critical buckling loads and shapes as well as natural frequencies and mode shapes are determined analytically. Steady state solutions are shown to exist in the latter case except for certain critical values of acceleration. The free vibration problem for this latter case of tip loads is addressed in the paper. Dokumaci [18] presents an exact determination of coupled bending and torsional vibration characteristics of uniform beams having single cross-sectional symmetry. The simplest continuous mathematical model for the analysis of coupled bending and torsion vibrations is obtained by combining the Euler-Bemoulli theory for bending and St-Venant theory for torsion. Further, it is shown that the roots of the characteristic equation of the governing differential equations of motions can be separated to obtain real exact solutions. This study is extended to include warping by Bishop et al. [19]. The inclusion of the warping effect is observed to make an appreciable difference in the results of a thin-walled beam of open section. Kirk and Wiedemann [20] use Euler-Bemoulli beam theory to determine analytical solution for the natural frequencies, mode shapes and the orthogonality condition of a free-free beam with large offset masses connected to the beam. Results are presented for different magnitudes of masses with various fixed orientations while ignoring torsional effects. Oguamanam [2] uses Euler-Bemoulli beam theory for the determination of the natural frequencies, modal shapes and the orthogonality condition of a cantilever beam with a finite mass rigid load whose centre of gravity is not coincident with its point of attachment to the

beam. This work is extended in this project to include out-of-plane flexural deformation. The natural frequencies are calculated for a manipulator with rigid tip mass and experiencing flexural-flexural-torsional coupling. It is observed that the natural frequency is dependent on many parameters such as the magnitude of the tip mass, the offset o f the tip mass centre o f gravity from the point of attachment, the moments of inertia of the tip mass about the centre of gravity, the length o f the beam, the slenderness ratio, and the bending stiffness and torsional rigidity of the beam.

Chapter 4 4.0 Characteristic Equation
Taking into consideration the boundary conditions, Eqs.(3.19) and (3.25), the general solution to the governing equations (i.e., Eqs. (3.16)- (3.18)) can be written as V(^) = A ^(sin(2,^) - sinh(A^)) + (cos(A^) - cosh(A^)) (4.1) (4.2) (4.3)

W. (f) = 5, (sin(A^) - sinh(A^)) + 5, (cos(A^) - cosh(;i^)) r(f ) = Csm(A'%,uf)

The above equations are substituted into the remaining boundary conditions Eqs. (3.20),(3.21),(3.23),(3.24) and (3.26)) to yield a set of equations that is expressed by using compact matrix notation as A,.,X;.,=0 Where X=[C A; A % B| (4.4)

is column vector of the coefficients of the general solutions, Eqs.

(4.1).(4.3). The frequency (or characteristic) equation is obtained by equating the determinant of matrix A in Eq. (4.4) to zero; it may be written as

Chapter 5 5.0 Numerical Simulation and Discussion
The Characteristic (frequency) equation of a cantilever beam with rigid tip mass experiencing flexural-flexural-torsional coupling is solved for a beam with the following material properties and geometric parameters: Young's modulus E= 210 GPa., Poisson's ratio V = 0.3, Density p = 7000 kgm'^, Cross-sectional area A= 100 mm'^. Length L=5 m and Torsional constant J = 7.0865x10''° m **. The torsional constant is computed from the formula [22]

The results are compared with the results obtained from commercial finite element software ANSYS. The AN SYS results are based on 500 "BEAM4" elements. The results are tabulated in Table 1. It is observed that the ANSYS results are in excellent agreement (up to the fourth decimal place).

5.1 Effect of varying the offset on the natural frequency
The effect of varying the offsets is examined using the following parameters: a = 0.5, M t= 0.5 and 7^ = 7^ = 7^ = 0.2 . When any two offsets are varying, the non-varying offset is set to zero. The results for varying ay and a^ (with a^ = 0) are depicted in Fig. 5.1. It is observed that the natural frequency decreases with increasing ay (a%) values for given values o f 32 (ay). The results obtained for varying az and a%, on the one hand, and a^ and ay, on the other hand, are respectively illustrated in Figs. 5.2 and 5.3.The natural frequency in both scenarios decreases with increasing a%or ay for a given value of a% . The offset along the longitudinal axis of the beam a % has no significant effect on the natural frequency for a given value of a % or ay.

illustrated in Fig. 5.4. The natural frequency decreases with increasing values of I^ for given values of 7 ^ . The variations in 7 do not, for the range of values examined, have any significant effect on the natural frequency for given values o f7,^. The effect of varying 7^ and 7^ for 7^, =0.20 (see Fig. 5.5) shows that the natural frequency decreases with increasing values of7,^ for a given value of7^. For a fixed 7^, especially for higher values, the natural frequency is invariant for a range of7^. For small

Chapter 6 6.0 Conclusion
The goal o f this project is to calculate natural frequency of a manipulator which is modeled as a cantilever Euler-Bemoulli beam. The manipulator experiences torsional and bending deformation in XY and XZ planes. The analysis is restricted to small deformations, and Hamilton's principle is used to obtain the system governing equations. A closed form expression of the characteristic equation is derived, and this is solved by a root finding technique using a MATLAB computer program. The effect of varying different parameters on the frequency equation of the system is observed. The accuracy of the frequency equation is supported by the results that are obtained from finite element software ANSYS. The ANSYS results are based on finite element analysis using 500 "BEAM4" elements and are in excellent agreement (up to the fourth decimal) with the present work. The possible extension to the project includes the use of other beam models and the inclusion of warping.
