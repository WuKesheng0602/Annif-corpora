SYNOPSIS The economic opportunity and quality o f human life depend upon the continued availability o f a life-sustaining environment. Understanding how we and other organisms affect, and are affected by, our environment is an important first step toward maintaining a sustainable future. As environmental engineers, we have to deal with natural systems and also expand our conceptualization o f environmental engineering to include societal, legal and financial aspects. Water, by its very nature, is vital for the survival o f life on the earth. If today, the struggle amongst the nations is for the resources such as oil, a survey o f the United Nations suggests that in the future, it will be a struggle for drinking water. This shows how much importance we have to pay to the water and water quality to assure our future generation a life-sustainahle environment to live upon. As industrialization and population growth continues, the problem of

eutrophication, which is the accelerated aging o f lakes and estuaries etc., due to excess plant and algal growth has been and going to be witnessed all over the world. This is the result o f discharges o f nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus to these water bodies. Hence, environmental engineers are working hard in designing the wastewater treatment system that could remove these pollutants in an efficient and cost effective way. The components in wastewater treatment processes may be conveniently categorized as physical, chemical and biological operations, but understanding the principles governing their behavior is a prerequisite for successful process design. Biological wastewater treatment has seen a significant growth in the last 25 years. Particular occurrence was recognition o f the many events that can happen simultaneously in biological processes and the role that the design engineer has in determining which

predominates. The impact on process design o f this recognition demanded that the present and future environmental engineers begin to think in multiple events rather than compartmentalizing them. These necessitate the need for better understanding o f microbiology and reactor engineering to achieve the improved results in biological wastewater treatment. In the part o f literature review, emphasis has been made to understand the nature o f biochemical operations, kinetics, stoichiometry and some conflicts o f the major reactions occurring in different environments and design processes. However, the important aspect o f understanding and appreciating the complex interactions occurring among the microorganisms that fonu the ecosystems in the biological process operations has been discussed in length in the section recent research part. Some conflicts have arisen in a single biological wastewater treatment system that simultaneously removes nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, resolving these conflicts and enhancing the process performance are the primary goal o f this project work. An effort has been made to modify the process design and combine continuous stirred tank reactor and rotating biological contactors to overcome these conflicts. The combined hybrid system will provide two kinds bacteria population: suspended activated sludge bacteria and biofilm bacteria. Together, these can improve the efficiency o f simultaneous removal o f nitrogen and phosphorus from the municipal wastewater.

INTRODUCTION

1.1.1 Background: Nutrients are essential elements for the growth and survival o f organisms, and within the ecosystem, nutrients have a substantial influence on both the abundance o f plant and animal life and the types and variety o f species. Ever increasing population growth and various human activities have contributed in increasing the biologically available supply o f two key nutrients, Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P), in the ecosystem. An oversupply o f nutrients, a condition known as eutrophication, encourages excessive plant production in aquatic ecosystems. In water bodies, increased plant productivity eventually reduces the oxygen content o f the water, often to the point where fish and other species can no longer survive. Phosphorus compounds are the main cause o f eutrophication in tfeshwater ecosystems, but concerns have also been raised about increasing concentrations of nitrogen because o f their contribution to the acidification o f lakes and soils and their predominant role in the eutrophication o f saltwater ecosystems. Excessive concentrations o f some nitrogen-based compounds, such as nitrates and ammonia, are toxic to plants and animals and can stimulate the growth o f toxic algae in marine waters. Shellfish ingesting these algae can accumulate large amounts o f toxins in their flesh can poison humans or other animals that eat them (Environment Canada,
2001 ).

1.1.2 Impacts on Marine Life: Although algae are the foundation on which the rest o f the aquatic food chain ultimately depends; excessive algal production tends to reduce the diversity o f populations in a lake and simplify its food web. The survival o f species such as trout or bass becomes more tenuous, and so-called "coarse" fish species, such as carp, may come to dominate the fish population. There are a number o f reasons why an explosion o f algal productivity should adversely affect many species, but the most important involve depletion o f the lake's oxygen supply and the accumulation o f organic debris. Plankton go through boom and bust cycles; when populations die o ff their decomposition draws large amounts o f dissolved oxygen from the water, causing stress to fish and invertebrates. Large quantities o f plants can also affect the oxygen supply on a daily basis. Aquatic plants produce oxygen during the daytime through photosynthesis; at night, they consume oxygen, so that dissolved oxygen levels fall very low where plants are abundant. In addition, the overabundance of organic matter caused by excessive algal populations can smother the lake bottom and reduce the diversity o f bottom-dwelling organisms. Organic matter also accumulates in crevices between rocks where decay can consume enough oxygen to impair the survival o f fish eggs. As organic matter accumulates in sediments, nuisance accumulations o f aquatic rooted plants are more likely to occur (Environment Canada, 2001). In more simplistic way, visual effects o f eutrophication include muddled and discolored water, excessive algae and bacteria production, and aquatic organisms killed

by oxygen depletion. Thus, biodiversity in these aquatic ecosystems is often disturbed and depleted. Water saturated with oxygen will have a DO of 7-9mg/L, depending on the temperature and altitude. Typically, higher marine life in shallow (costal and river) waters can survive at DO level o f 4mg/L and higher, but a healthy marine population requires DO level of 6.0mg/L or higher to ensure a healthy spawning environment. The following figure illustrates both the cases o f unaffected and affected water bodies by eutrophication.

1.1.3 Impacts on Water Quality: Deoxygenation is most severe in the cold, bottom waters o f eutrophic lakes. In early summer, solar radiation warms the surface waters o f lakes in temperate climates, resulting in the formation o f warm and cold layers. Because the solar radiation is rapidly absorbed in the upper portion o f the lake, the deeper waters remain cold. This cold bottom layer, known as the hypolimnion, is denser than the overlying warm water and thus does not mix easily with it. As a result, when oxygen is consumed in the hypolimnion, it cannot be replaced by diffusion from the warmer water above it. When bacteria feed on the abundance o f organic matter that falls to the bottom o f eutrophic lakes, they can rapidly use up the hypolimnion''s limited and finite oxygen supply. If the oxygen concentration in a lake's hypolimnion gets too low, organisms may die or be forced out o f the hypolimnion. Under less severe circumstances, persistently low-oxygen concentrations can cause coldwater species that require high concentrations o f dissolved oxygen (for example, trout and sculpins) to be replaced by warm water species (for example, walleye, pike, and smallmouth bass), with lower oxygen requirements (Environment Canada, 2001).

1.1.4 Impacts on Natural Weathering of Sediments: A partial or complete lack o f oxygen in the hypolimnion can add to a lake's nutrient loadings by causing phosphorus to be released from the bottom sediments. The phosphorus then diffuses upward into the surface water and stimulates further algal production. In shallow lakes, decades o f pollution can cause the release o f phosphorus from bottom sediments even under oxygenated conditions. The release o f phosphorus from sediments can slow the recovery o f a lake after external loadings have been reduced (Environment Canada, 2001).

1.1.5 Sources of Nitrogen: Major anthropogenic sources o f nutrients are municipal and rural wastewaters, agricultural runoff, and industrial wastes. Much o f it eventually ends up in surface waters, through direct discharge, as in the case o f municipal and industrial effluents, through groundwater and surface runoff, as in the case o f nutrients leached from agricultural croplands, or through atmospheric deposition, as in the case o f particles and gases emitted to the air from croplands, industrial smokestacks, and vehicle tailpipes (Environment Canada, 2001).

1.1.6 Description of Algae: The chemical composition o f algae can be represented by (Randall et ah, 1992). According to this component ratio, each gram o f phosphoms is completely assimilated by algae to mapufacture new biomass from photosynthesis and inorganic elements: biomass of 111 grams with COD o f 138 grams would be produced. It is possible for either N or P is to be the nutrient that limits algal growth and 1 gram o f N could potentially stimulate the manufacture o f 16 grams o f algal biomass, which would be equivalent to 20 grams o f COD. Thus the discharge of 1 mg/1 P could potentially result in COD equivalent to 138 mg/1. Then lmg/1 N could result in potential production of COD equivalent to 20 mg/1; this is less than the potential production by P, so if the same amount o f N & P should be removed, P should he removed first. Both o f them still greater than the COD of the organics in the untreated wastewater & should be removed reasonably (Su et al., 1997).

1.1.7 What is Being Done About Nutrients? Controlling nutrients is a potential costly issue due to the many sources o f nutrient pollution. Sewage treatment plants have ways o f removing the nutrients from the wastewater, which can reduce the amount o f nutrient pollution entering the water bodies. The Ministry o f Environment, Government o f Ontario has started incorporating limits on nutrients discharges from wastewater treatment plants in to water bodies. However, biological method o f nutrients removal is proving to be a cost effective process & can be implemented to existing wastewater treatment plants.

1.1.8 Biological Nutrients Removal (BNR) Technology: Biological nutrients removal processes are well-established technologies for treating domestic wastewater. Nevertheless, in Hybrid systems like combination o f two processes, high nitrogen removal rate can be achieved hy the aid o f the long solids retention time (SRT) biofilm on the rotating biological contactors (RBC). The suspended solids in the systems can be operated at short SRT without decreasing the nitrogen removal capacity to progress phosphorus removal rate to the degree o f statutory requirements.

1.1.9 Benefits of BNR Technology: Although, there are several benefits o f BNR technologies, the most important ones are given as below:

1.2.0 Objectives and Scope of Study: The object o f this project work is to develop and study a new hybrid biological nutrient removal (HBNR) process in treating domestic wastewater from municipal treatment plants and evaluate the concept to resolve the conflicts in solids retention time (SRT) o f conventional biological nutrients removal processes. The hybrid system is formed by the combination o f continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and rotating biological contactors (RBC). Scope o f this works is limited only to wastewater from municipal wastewater treatments for tests & experiments, and other sources like sludge or industrial wastewater fall beyond the study boundaries. In 1975, Barnard adopted a single sludge system to remove both nitrogen and phosphorus without adding any chemicals, but conflict arises when employing such a single sludge system to simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphorus. First, growth o f nitrifiers and denitrifiers is slower than that o f heterotrophic bacteria and longer SRT must be adopted if improvement in the nitrification and denitrification is required. Correspondingly, the system must be operated using a shorter SRT if phosphorus removal must be undertaken. The conflict arises during the operation o f SRT. Second, the anoxic reactor is typically placed behind the anaerobic rector and the short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are utilized primarily for the phosphate release in the anaerobic reactor. Comeau (1986) suggested combining the clarified wastewater emitted from a digested

10

sludge reactor with the wastewater influent to increase the amount o f SCFA as well as improve the phosphate release and denitrifcation rate. Biofilms (e.g., RBC) have a long sludge age and high biomass concentration and stability in operation, hence, can be used to resolve the above mentioned SRT conflict in combination with suspended growth o f activated sludge system (e.g., CSTR) to remove nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously. The basic operational conditions for the experiments shall be as below: · · · SRT: 10-12 days Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT); 10-11 hours Temperature: 20-22 C

W ith other relevant experimental details, HBNR can achieve a removal efficiency o f about 95% TKN, 70% T-N and 95% T-P (Su et al., 1996 and 1997).

CHAPTER]: LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1.1 W aste Water Nutrients: The terni nutrients in wastewater is usually referred to nitrogen and phosphorus compounds that are released to environment as a result o f human activities. Nutrients are essential to natural water bodies, because they provide the raw material for the growth o f algae, the food sources o f zooplankton, which, in turn, are eaten by fish. The concentration o f nutrients in a lake is determined by the interplay o f the magnitude, timing and bioavailability o f the nutrient load, the rate o f water supply compared to the volume o f the lake (flushing time), and the depth o f the lake. Lakes can absorb certain amount o f nutrients but an oversupply o f nutrients, a condition known as eutrophication, encourages excessive plant production in aquatic ecosystems. In lakes and rivers, increased plant productivity eventually reduces the oxygen content o f the water, often to the point where fish and other species can no longer survive. Phosphorus compounds are the main cause o f eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems and nitrate is believed to be partly responsible for declines in amphibian populations in Canada, and adverse effects on organisms include poor larval growth, reduced body size, and impaired swimming ability. Nutrient additions have led to higher risks to human health from the use o f waters contaminated with toxic algal blooms and consumption o f tainted shellfish. Aesthetic enjoyment o f the water may be impaired by turbidity, discoloration, foaming, and odor, while long strands o f nuisance algae such as Cladophora can restrict swimming, foul fishing gear, damage boat motors, and impede navigation. In some cases, municipalities and industries may have to face higher maintenance costs to clear clogged intake pipes,

and communities may have to pay for additional filtration o f drinking water to reduce taste and odor problems. In Canadian ecosystem, nutrients became a major environmental issue during 1970 due to eutrophication o f Lake Erie. Monitoring the release o f phosphates and laundry detergents combined with better sewage treatment helped to bring the problem under control. However, in various parts o f Canada, inputs o f nutrients from other sources have increased at alarming rate that a stringent regulatory action may be necessary to protect further damage to the ecosystem. Major anthropogenic sources or causes of nutrients are urbanization,

industrialization, and intensive agriculture. Municipal wastewater is the largest point source o f nitrogen and phosphorus to the Canadian environment. In 1996, an estimated 6 thousand tonnes o f total phosphorus and 80 thousand tonnes o f total nitrogen were released to lakes, rivers and coastal waters from Canadian households, as shown in table 2.1. This loading occurred despite the fact that 73% o f Canadians were served by municipal sewer systems, as in figure2.1 and at least 94% o f the wastewater collected by sewers received primary or higher treatment, as shown in table 2.2.

Municipal wastewater, or sewage, comes from households, office buildings, and small to medium sized industries and is a complex mixture o f suspended solids, microorganisms, and debris; some 200 chemicals have also been identified in this waste stream in Canada (Government o f Canada, 1996). The nutrients in this mix come from human waste, household cleaning products such as laundry detergent, automatic dishwashing detergent, general cleaners, and industrial byproducts. Human waste contributes more than 90% o f the household nitrogen loadings, with most o f the nitrogen in the form o f ammonia. Human waste is also the largest source o f phosphorus in sewage, followed by automatic dishwashing detergent. Almost all-municipal wastewater in Canada undergoes one or more o f the following levels of treatment; · · Primary treatment, which uses physical processes to remove suspended solids; Secondary treatment, which uses biological processes to break down organic material and remove additional suspended solids; and · Tertiary treatment, which uses advanced chemical or biological treatment to remove specific compounds or materials that remain after secondary treatment. Some o f the nutrients in wastewater can be removed by settling, but a precipitating agent such as alum can also be added at any o f these stages to increase phosphate removal. Effective nitrogen removal requires the addition o f specialized bacteria and wastewater treatment plants are required to employ advanced nutrients removal facility before discharging their treated water to natural water bodies such as Lake Ontario (Environment Canada, 2001).

2.1.2 Pathways of Nutrients: Physical, chemical and biological pathways o f nutrients are a complex process and are briefly described as below: Phosphorus: Phosphorus may enter a water body through the inflows,

precipitation, dry fallout and from sediments; and it may he removed hy sedimentation and through the outflow. The different pathways o f phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon in lake metabolism make phosphorus the obvious choice for eutrophication control. A certain reduction o f phosphorus input will generally result in a greater reduction in algal biomass compared with the same reduction o f nitrogen. Furthermore, the reduction o f nitrogen input without a proportional reduction in phosphorus creates low N/P ratio, which favors nitrogen fixing nuisance algae, without any reduction in algal biomass. Total phosphorus (T-P) is considered the key variable for a practical reason, which includes the fractions o f crystalline, occluded, absorbed, particulate organic, soluble organic and soluble inorganic phosphorus. Out o f these fractions, the three biologically available phosphorus fractions listed in order o f decreasing availability are soluble reactive phosphorus (a mixture o f dissolved inorganic and organic species), soluble unreactive phosphorus (some include dissolved phosphorus fed by phosphoms sulfate oxidation, and is available for phytoplankton by enzymatic hydralisation which frees organically bound fractions), and labile phosphorus (associated with soil particles). Nitrogen: Transformations between various nitrogen compounds in the nitrogen cycle o f aquatic ecosystems need a thorough understanding for management o f water bodies. Most phytoplankton, which creates nuisance bloom conditions are capable o f nitrogen fixation and are not dependant on dissolved combined forms o f nitrogen.

18

Nitrogen fixation occurs only in bacterial cells (blue green algae are prokaryotic, unlike other phytoplankton which are eukaryotic), however nitrogen fixation is inhibited by high cellular ammonia content. O f the combined forms o f nitrogen the most important are ammonia and nitrate. The reactant (ammonia) is not derived from a respiration process. Decomposition o f organic matter results in release and accumulation o f ammonia. Ultimate sources o f ammonia include nitrogen fixation and assimilation in the aquatic and paralimnetic ecosystem components. Under aerobic conditions, ammonia is oxidized in a two-step process called nitrification, first to nitrite, then to nitrate. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrification o f ammonia to nitrate does not occur, and ammonia accumulates often at the bottom o f lakes. Much o f the historic difficulty with quantifying total oxygen demand (and sizing o f aeration systems) can be attributed to this "ammonia anomaly". Total oxygen demand includes respiratory demand and nonrespiratory demand, for example chemosynthesis 12/03/2003}. 2.2.0 Biological Nutrients Removal Processes: Biological nutrients removal process involves three basic processes: aerobic, anaerobic and anoxic; these three basic components that form the biological nutrient removal processes were developed in 1960s, by the virtue o f number o f theoretical and experimental approaches. This principle can be applied to any wastewater treatment (http://lakes.chebuct 0 .0 rg/eutr 0 .html#lntr 0 ducti0n) {Accessed on

process whether municipal, industrial, or agricultural. Aerobic process occurs in the presence o f oxygen and anaerobic occurs in the absence o f oxygen. The anoxic process is

19

a denitrification process by which nitrate nitrogen is converted to nitrogen gas and combination o f aerobic and anoxic processes is essential for nitrogen removal. Biological phosphorous removal is achieved by exposing microbes to alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions; this mechanism favors the growth o f phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs), which are responsible for biological phosphorus removal. However, controversy existed for more than a decade concerning the phosphorus removal mechanisms. While some chemical phosphorus removals occur in systems with anaerobic and anoxic zones, it is now recognized that biological mechanisms are responsible for most o f the phosphorus removal. In spite o f controversies, research during 1960s resulted in the first commercial biological phosphorus removal (BPR) process, the Phostrip process, since then a great deal has been discovered about the mechanisms, microbiology, stoichiometry and kinetics o f biological nutrients removal processes. Common systems for biological phosphorous and nitrogen removal modifications o f activated sludge process and incorporate four features; i) Flocculent slurry o f microorganisms ii) Quiescent sedimentation hi) Settled solids recycle and iv) Solids retention time control To name few of the prominent BNR processes, which are commonly practiced are: A 2/0, Bardenpho, University o f Cape Town (UCT) process, Modified University o f Cape Town (MUCT) process, Virginia Initiative Plant (VIP) process etc. are

20

The A 2 /0 system uses a combination o f anaerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic cells and works well for high phosphorous wastes. The Bardenpho process uses the following series for treatment o f waste: anaerobic, anoxic, aerobic, anoxic, and aerobic. This is the most efficient process for removing high levels o f nitrogen and phosphorous while producing the least amount o f sludge (Grady Jr et ah, 1999). The following section describes biological process, which encourages the removal o f nutrients from wastewater.

I) Nitrification: Nitrification is the biological oxidation o f ammonia to nitrite and then to the nitrate form. Two major species o f microorganisms, which are responsible for the biological oxidation o f nitrogen compounds, are Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter. Nitrosomonas oxidizes ammonia to nitrite. Nitrobacter completes the nitrification process by oxidizing nitrite to nitrate. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration and solids retention time (SRT) are important parameters in nitrification kinetics. The rate o f nitrification in an activated sludge system decreases with decreasing temperature. The optimum temperature is between 25 and 35°C. The optimum pH for nitrification is in the range o f 7.5-9.0. Alkalinity is destroyed by the oxidation o f ammonia, thereby reducing the pH. Aeration partially strips the carbon dioxide from the wastewater thereby reducing alkalinity reduction; however, sufficient alkalinity must remain in the wastewater so as not to depress the pH.

The nitrification rate is also dependent on the fraction o f nitrifying bacteria present in the system. A principal means o f increasing the nitrification rate is to increase the fraction o f nitrifiers. This can be accomplished by increasing the aeration basin mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration, which increases the SRT. Lowering the ratio between five-day BOD concentration and the total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentration (BOD/TKN) by nitrifying in a separate second stage aeration system would also increase the percentage o f nitrifiers and thus the nitrification rate.

II) Denitrification: Biological denitrification is a process in which nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas by microorganisms in the absence o f dissolved oxygen. Denitrification can occur provided a sufficient source o f nitrate and organic carbons are present.

The denitrification process occurs in two steps. The first step involves the reduction o f nitrate to nitrite. In the second step nitrite is reduced to produce nitrogen gas. Numerous species o f facultative heterotrophic bacteria, including Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Achromobacter and Bacillus are capable o f converting nitrate to nitrogen gas. Nitrate replaces oxygen in the respiratory processes o f the organisms capable o f denitrification under anoxic conditions. Environmental factors including temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen concentration have an effect on the rate o f dénitrification.

Denitrification occurs at temperatures in the range o f 10-30°C, optimum pH is in the range o f 6.5-8.0.

Ill) Phosphorus Removal: Phosphorus in wastewater may be present as orthophosphate, polyphosphate or organic phosphorus. Orthophosphate is the more easily removed o f the three types o f phosphorus. Polyphosphates are converted to orthophosphate by hydrolysis and organic phosphorus is converted to orthophosphate through bacterial decomposition (Process Design Manual for Phosphorus Removal, 1987). Conventional secondary biological treatment systems accomplish partial phosphorus removal by using phosphorus for biomass synthesis during BOD removal. A typical phosphorus content o f microbial solids is 1.5-2% based on dry weight. Wasting o f excess microbial solids may result in a total phosphorus removal o f 10-30%, depending on the BOD to phosphorus ratio, the system sludge age, sludge handling techniques and side stream return flows. Additional biological phosphorus removal will occur if the mixed liquor is subjected to both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. When an anaerobic stage precedes an aerobic stage, fermentation products are produced from BOD in the wastewater by the action o f facultative organisms. The phosphorus-storing microorganisms are able to assimilate the fermentation products under anaerobic conditions. Because many competing microorganisms cannot function in this manner, the phosphorus

microorganisms have a distinct advantage over other organisms in the activated sludge system. Thus, the anaerobic phase results in the development o f phosphorus storing microorganisms.

During the aerobic phase the stored substrate products are depleted and soluble phosphorus is taken up by the microorganisms in quantities greater than what is needed to function. This 'luxury uptake' o f phosphorus is maximized at dissolved oxygen concentrations greater than 2 mg/1. At lower DO concentrations the excess phosphorus will be released from the microorganisms. For biological phosphorus removal to occur, an anaerobic stage is required for the production o f the fermentation products. Therefore, if nitrification is occurring, it is necessary for denitrification to take place before enhanced biological phosphorus removal can occur. If this does not happen, and nitrite or nitrates are present, the system is anoxic rather than anaerobic. For this reason, a low dissolved oxygen concentration must be maintained for a longer period when biological phosphorus removal is required than when denitrification is required (Surampalli et al., 1997).

2.2.1 Fixed Biofilms: Microorganisms in fixed biofilms are grown attached to a solid surface rather than being freely suspended in the wastewater undergoing treatment and this solid surface may be fixed in space with the wastewater flowing over it in thin sheets as in packed tower or it may rotate about an axis, thereby moving through the fluid in the bioreactor as in rotating biological contactors. Biofilm can be divided in to two zones, the base film and the surface film; both contain an assemblage o f microorganisms and other particulate material bound together by a matrix o f extra cellular polymers. Base film consists o f a structured accumulation, a well-defined boundary with transportation mechanism is through diffusion, and where as surface film provides transition between the base film and the bulk liquid with transportation mechanism being dominated by advection. For a detailed description, rotating biological contactor process is discussed as below (Grady Jr et al., 1999). 2.2.1(a) Rotating Biological Contactors (RBC): Rotating biological contactors are generally made up o f circular shaped corrugated plastic media that are mounted on a horizontal shaft and in turn a motor fitted with speed regulator rotates the shaft. Plastic media discs are partially submerged in the wastewater (about 40%), and its rotational speed varies from 1-2 revolutions per minute. Rotating plastic disc media get exposed alternately to wastewater and atmosphere, this helps the growth o f microorganisms on the disc and metabolizes biodegradable organic material and nitrogen-containing compounds in the wastewater. When the loading rate o f biodegradable organic matter is sufficiently low, nitrifying bacteria will grow on the media & convert the ammonia-N to nitrate-N.

Many RBC facilities were installed in US during 1970s; over 600 in the US & 3000 in the World currently exist. Almost all the manufacturers o f RBC units produce standard dimensions; typical media bundle is 3.66 m in diameter, 7.6m long on a shaft that is 8.23 m long. Typical velocity o f 1.6 rpm, the peripheral velocity o f the disc is 18.3m/min. Media material is made o f high-density polyethylene containing UV inhibitors such as carbon black and corrugated sheets are used for discs to get higher surface area available. To minimize the short-circuiting, the axis o f each individual RBC shaft is typically placed perpendicular to the direction o f flow (Grady Jr et a l, 1999).

2.2.2 Activated Sludge Processes (AS): Activated sludge is an aerobic suspended growth process and microorganisms are grown in a variety o f bioreactor configuration, which remove soluble organic matter. Incepted in 1914 by Arden & Lockett, activated sludge process is the most widely used biological wastewater treatment even today. Common factors governing activated sludge systems are: i) Flocculent slurry o f microorganisms (Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids-MLSS) ii) Quiescent settling (Hydraulic Retention Time-HRT) iii) Recycling o f settled solids (Return Activated Sludge-RAS) iv) Removal o f excess sludge (Waste Activated Sludge-WAS) Microorganisms in flocculent slurry remove soluble & particulate organic matter from the waste influent; quiescent settling helps in reducing the concentration o f MLSS, which produces an effluent, low in suspended solids. Settled solids are recycled as concentrated sluiry from the clarifier back to the bioreactor and then excess solids are wasted to control solids retention time to have desired value. The hioreactor containing the MLSS is called as aeration basin and is aerobic throughout. Sufficient mixing energy is required in the hioreactor to maintain the solids in suspension. Concentration o f MLSS depends on the characteristics o f the influent wastewater, hioreactor hydraulic retention time, and process solids retention time. Return activated sludge is recycled from clarifier to hioreactor and concentration o f RAS depends on the clarifier operation conditions, including the influent MLSS and influent RAS flow rate. To maintain desired SRT, solids can he removed from the process at various points and this stream is called waste activated sludge (Grady Jr et ah, 1999 and Ganczarczyk, 1983).

2.2.2.1 Biology of Activated Sludge: Activated sludge represents a complicated mixture o f viruses and other organisms, found either singly or clumped together, often enmeshed in a fabric o f organic debris, dead cells and other waste products. 2.2.2.1(a) Bacteria: The most prominent and active bacteria in activated sludge system are heterotrophic and autotrophic, which are both aggregated in the sludge floes and dispersed in the liquor. The physical characteristics o f the treatment system can also affect activated sludge population diversity by a washout o f slow-growers, elimination of species more sensitive to turbulence, etc. Heterotrophic bacteria utilize organic material as a source o f both carbon and energy, while autotrophic bacterial generally depend on the oxidation o f mineral compounds for energy requirements and utilize carbon dioxide as a carbon source. Bacteria in activated sludge are reproduced by binary fission, with the generation time ranging from less than 20 minutes to a few days (growth pattern can be represented by . Buchanan's curve). Filamentous bacteria such as Sphaerotilus natans, Geo trichum, Beggiatoa and Thiothrix, etc, in activated sludge systems cause sludge bulking, indicating the presence o f substrates rich in carbohydrates.

2.2.2.1(b) Sludge Age: SRT or sludge age ( 5'^ ) in activated sludge system can be calculated as

Where V= Volume o f aeration basin Q = Volumetric flow rate o f influent Q,y = Volumetric flow rate o f wastage X = Suspended solids in aeration tank = Suspended solids in recycle line ^Suspended solids in final effluent (Ganczarczky, 1983). Conventional activated sludge system was used for retrofitting to remove BOD and Nitrogen simultaneously; this led to compact and cost effective treatment process. In the experimental set up, immobilized nitrifiers to be dosed in a nitrification tank were obtained by molding polymer materials consisting mainly o f polyethylene glycol and microorganisms in to 3 mm square pellets through polymerization reaction. The immobilized pellets homogenized and the numbers o f Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter in the pellets were found to be higher than that o f activated sludge, thus, reduces the SRT in the whole reaction system. Even at a lower temperature o f about 10 C, 90% efficiency in simultaneous removal o f BOD and N was reported (Emori et ah, 1994).

Availability o f less organic substrate, coupled with low temperature has reduced the nutrient removal efficiency o f treatment plants. Studies have indicated that by

introducing a sponge-like media in to anoxic zone o f activated sludge conditions, temperature effects on nitrification can be reduced. The reduced denitrification rates at low temperature is believed due to higher DO contents in return sludge, together with less organic contents in wastewater and slower microbial reaction itself (Choi et ah, 1998). Group o f researchers worked on Mathematical model "Activated Sludge Model No. 2." This model introduces phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAO) and allows us to simulate the behavior o f biological nutrient removal activated sludge systems. Typical wastewater composition and a set o f stoichiometric and kinetic parameters are provided to make reasonable predictions (Gujer et al. 1995). A single compartment tank for pilot experiment was used and air injected by compressor during aeration period. Concentrated synthetic substrate and diluting water were pumped in the activated sludge tank by means o f peristaltic pumps. The mixed liquor was passed in front o f the DO sensor, which monitored sludge respiration. Exact reaction mechanism was created in time that which would normally take place in real plant using the principle o f alternating anaerobic and aerobic phases; this was achieved by sequentially alternating (3 cycles/day) the aerated and unaerated phases (Hascoet et al., 1985). Thorough investigation was done to understand what happens to the phosphorus and its movement during alternating phases. Using electron microscope, a sample o f microorganisms taken during an aerated period was observed and it was found that the polyphosphate granules were present inside the cells, as shown in fig 2.7 "a" and "b". Observation o f this sample placed in an anaerobic phase for six hours in the presence o f

2.2.3 Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR): Sequencing batch reactor derives its name from the sequence o f steps that the reactor goes through in entire process o f wastewater treatment. Basic steps governing the SBR process are; i) ii) iii) iv) v) Filling Reacting Settling Drawing Idling

In filling & reacting steps, mixing and aeration occur, as this is necessary for biological reaction. Mixing & aeration is terminated, leading to settling o f biomass at settling stage. Treated effluent is removed and then reactor is ready to be placed back for service to receive influent during drawing and idling stages respectively. Timing allotted for each stages cited above is the most important factor that steers the whole SBR process. The length o f the fill period is chosen depending on variety of factors, including the nature o f the facility and the treatment objectives. Main effect o f the fill period determines the hydraulic characteristics o f the bioreactor. If the fill period is short, the process will be characterized hy a high instantaneous process-loading factor, exposing the biomass for initial high concentration o f organic matter and other wastewater constituents, hut over the time the concentration will drop down. On the other hand, if the fill period is long, the biomass will experience only low and relatively constant concentrations o f the wastewater constituents.

The environmental conditions established during the fill and react periods will determine which events occur. If the fill and react periods are aerobic throughout, then oxidation o f carbon and nitrification occur, indicating that SBR will behave more or less like activated sludge process. But elimination o f aeration while mixing will allow denitrification to occur if the nitrate is present. Furthermore, inclusion o f another mixed but unaerated interval later in the react period can make the SBR act like the Bardenpho process. Looking in to above two examples o f few combinations, SBR can be designed and operated to mimic many different continuous flow processes. Once the aeration and mixing is completed in react period and allowed to settle, clear effluent suitable for discharge is produced and certain amount o f biomass can be retained at this stage in the bioreactor to maintain desired SRT. During draw period, settled effluent is removed by décantation. Finally, the idle period is allowed in each cycle to provide flexibility and beginning o f the new fill period terminates the idle period and initiates new cycle. Based on SBR principle numerous researches are conducted worldwide and are also in progress (Grady Jr et ah, 1999). It has been observed that salinity in the influent wastewater greatly inhibits biological nutrients removal efficiency in SBR and is dominated by the high mol% G+C Gram-positive bacteria. Further, addition o f acetate to the process boosted the availability o f carbon for the phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs); if this was not done, denitrifying bacteria out competed the PAG for carbon source thereby hampering the phosphorus removal in the system (Intrasungkha et ah, 1999).

Temperature effects on the process have been focused and found that bio phosphorus removing mechanism still remains partially unresolved, however, the aerobic phosphorus uptake rate showed a maximum in the interval from 15 to 20C. But, nitrification & denitrification decreased as the temperature decreased; with decreasing temperature, more carbon will be available for poly-phosphate bacteria (Baetens et ah, 1999). Many researchers have studied the optimum level o f phosphorus required for efficient removal o f organic matter by activated sludge, understanding o f this mechanism have lead to know the requirement o f minimum concentration o f phosphorus in activated sludge which allows the maximum BOD removal without causing any deterioration in the properties o f settling sludge. Oscillation between feast and famine is one o f the most common environmental stresses microorganisms are exposed to in SBR system. Two sets o f SBR tanks were arranged in series, acidogenic and methanogenic in nature. The operated conditions were effective in removing 97%, 75%, and 86% o f Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus respectively. The improvements in the settling sludge allowed a reduction in the settling drawing, and filling times, and increased the anaerobic and aerobic SRT in the cycle configuration. The results showed that the combination o f a two-step anaerobic digester with a SBR is effective for combined carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal from industrial wastewaters. The existence o f zones in which the different populations coexist is possible through the arrangement o f reactors and proposed operational conditions (Rustrian et al., 1998).

2.3.0 Hybrid Biological Nutrients Removal (HBNR) Process 2.3.1 RBC and Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor: Biological nutrient removal systems create anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic phases for phosphorus release, denitrification and nitrification / déphosphoration, respectively, thereby allowing ammonium, oxide nitrogen and phosphorus to be simultaneously removed. But such reactions between various microorganisms lead to complex characteristics in any single sludge process. Conflicts have arisen in the system that removes nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously. Choosing a suitable Sludge Retention Time (SRT) for both phosphorus and nitrogen to be removed simultaneously in a single activated sludge process is a major task./Longer SRT with higher dissolved oxygen (DO) are prerequisites for higher efficiency o f nitrification. For shorter SRT & provided extreme anaerobie stage, polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) can release higher phosphorus level and accumulate more polyphosphàte in anaerobic and aerobic stages respective!^ These conflicts can be resolved by adopting hybrid biological nutrient removal process (HBNR). Recent studies have shown that combination o f suspension and biofilm growth systems can provide two kinds o f bacteria populations in the process: suspended activated sludge bacteria for enhancing phosphorus removal and biofilm baeteria with a long sludge age for improving nitrificatioi^SR T o f more than 10 days is required to achieve higher efficiency o f nitrogen removal; however, a SRT less than 12 days is deemed A necessary to complete the phosphorus removal (Chuang et al., 1997).

W e can briefly explain HBNR mechanism; in the low DO stages, volatile fatty acids (VFA) from the influent an(^possibly some V FA's formed in this tankage, were taken up and converted to polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB) by microbiological species such as Acinobacter. In the higher DO, stages PHB is oxidized, as the orthophosphorus is removed from solution and bonded in to molecules that form granules o f phosphate within bacteria cells. The stored polyphosphate is removed from the system by wasting a portion o f the phosphorus rich sludge. The remainder o f the secondary clarifier solids was

recirculated to the RBC treatment tank influent. / Nitrification could occur in the low DO stage because the biofilm on the rotating media is exposed to the atmospheric oxygen in the air phase o f the rotation. Also, the RBC could be considered as a mechanical aerator device, and draws some oxygen in to mixed liquor as a result o f rotation. Denitrification could occur as the oxygen in the mixed liquor is depleted inside the RBC media, as well as in the mixed liquor, which surrounds the fixed film. There exists a balance between phosphorus removal, nitrification and

r

denitrification^^he most desirable situation would be to have the majority o f the nitrification / denitrification take place in the phosphorus stress/release stage while phosphorus uptake would occur in the last stage o f treatment, when DO is highest (Neu, 19&D.

CHAPTER 3 : RECENT RESEARCHES /Biological nutrients removal processes are preferred over chemical processes because V, o f their low operational costs, easy maintenance and minimal environmental impacts. A conventional wastewater treatment plant can easily be upgraded to include to biological nutrients removal with minimal alteration or addition in the process design.j Many forms o f modified biological nutrients removal processes are designed and operated throughout the world; presently, there is an abundant amount o f research under exploration. Most o f these methodologies deal with the integration o f existing system with the newly developed technologies in order to improve the efficiency o f biological removal o f nutrients in wastewater treatment plants.

3.1.0 Nutrients Removal Using Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor: Continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is a cylindrical shaped reactor, with a mixing device fitted to a motor o f variable speed; where anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic phases o f biological nutrients removal may take place (all in a single reactor) under various operational modes o f continuous mixing!) To make the system anaerobic, nitrogen is pumped continuously and then continuous mixing is introduced to provide anoxic conditions. Once the system is subjected to stipulated periods o f time during anaerobic and anoxic phases, nitrogen pumping is stopped and equal amount o f oxygen is pumped in to create the aerobic phase. By subjecting the influent wastewater to a cycle o f r ' anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic conditions in CSTR, microorganisms are exposed to a favorable environment to enhance nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus removal by means o f complex biological mechanisms.

Chuang et al. (1997) used different DO concentration to improve the nutrient removal efficiency coupled with different HRT and SRT, it was found that variation in DO o f influent wastewater has very little effect on the nutrients removal efficiency, but major role player was the SRT o f microorganisms. Bertumen and Musacchio (2000) used CSTR for bench scale experiments and set the objectives o f removing nutrients through biological method and retrofitting the system to existing wastewater treatment plants within Greater Toronto Area in Canada. To some extent, the experiment succeeded in removing Nitrogen and Phosphorus, but there was no consistency in the successive trials carried out. Source o f organics (COD) was used as a primary variable with time and it was found that there is no direct correlation between the percentages o f organics present in the influent wastewater to the nutrient removal efficiency. Even though the purpose o f the bench scale experiment was not to replace any of the existing units from wastewater treatment plants, rather, to be considered as an addition to the prevailing system, but it proved, itself inefficient. On the other hand, the experimental set up was very economical, used only bacteria cultures and minimal amount o f nitrogen gas. It did not call for any harsh chemicals that existing plants utilize, making it environmentally more benign. Also it consumed less power, making its operations very economical one. The system could be retrofitted to existing facility with minimum construction and causing least impacts on the activities o f the existing main plant. Despite inheriting some positive qualities, the feasibility study o f the CSTR process could not accomplish its goals. It was revealed that only about 65% o f nitrogen

46

and 70% o f phosphorus was removed, which is far less than what the regulation calls for; reasons being given for low performance o f the systems were many, but unfortunately not very specitrc. But, through the limited literature review within the scope o f the studies, one o f the possible causes was the complex nature o f the bacteria action involved in the mechanism o f nutrients removal. As cited earlier in section 2.3.0, different bacteria require different sludge retention timings (higher the sludge retention time, higher the nitrogen removal; where as, more than 11 days o f sludge retention time is not favorable to achieve modest amount of phosphorus removal efficiency) to perform the desired action. Hence, it was not possible to give this desired conflicting environment for bacteria in the same reactor without affecting overall plant efficiency. The possible ways to overcome the obstacles would be: · · · · Redesigning the generic process Addition of a sludge retention unit Allocating more time for anaerobic and anoxic phases Re-circulation o f activated sludge to anaerobic and anoxic phases from sludge retention unit · · Increasing over all HRT and SRT o f the entire process Conduct more number o f trials with much higher levels o f influent BOD / COD

3.2.0 Hybrid System Using RBC In Anaerobic, Anoxic and Aerobic Phases: Many systems have been developed in recent years to rearrange the layout o f anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic reactors. Ultimately, a high degree o f efficiency in nutrient removal can be achieved through use o f four or more stages, some examples, Bardenpho process and Modified University o f Cape Town process etc. However, some conflicts arise when employing such a single sludge system to remove nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneousl;^First, the growth o f nitrifiers is slower than that o f heterotrophic bacteri a; therefore, operation using a long sludge retention time (SRT) should be adopted if higher efficiency o f nitrogen removal is required. On the other hand, the system must be operated using a shorter SRT if phosphorus removal is to be enhanced^Second, the carbon sources are generally not rich enough for denitrification since the anoxic reactor is typically placed behind the anaerobic reactor and also the short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are utilized primarily for phosphate release in the anaerobic reactor. Comeau et al. (1986) suggested combining the clarified wastewater emitted from a digested sludge reactor with wastewater influent to increase the amount o f SCFA as well as to improve the phosphate release and denitrification rate. Brinch et al. (1994) added hydrolysate from a sludge fermenter to improve the removal efficiency o f phosphorus. A concept called Surfact, first tried in 1975 at Philadelphia in USA, using a system combining RBC with activated sludge. In Tokyo, an existing secondary activated sludge wastewater treatment plant was upgraded to remove nitrogen by rearranging the plant layout and adding RBC to the third

(aerobic) reactor to improve nitrification, this proved to be a great success considering the space restrictions in countries like Japan (Su et al. 1997). Su et al. (1996^developed an activated sludge bioreactor system with fully and partially submerged RBC using three reactors with anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic conditions to remove nitrogen, phosphorus and organics from the municipal wastewater. The authors demonstrated that, biofilm (such as RBC) can be used to resolve the SRT conflicts in the nutrients removal systems by adding a fully submerged RBC in the anaerobic and anoxic reactors to mix suspended solids as well as provide attached beds for anaerobic bacteria. The anaerobic biofilm can hydrolyze the complex and particulate COD to readily biodegradable COD and SCFA. Consequently, the amount o f SCFA will be increased to improve both phosphate release and denitrificatioi^ By locating two stages o f partially submerged RBC in the aerobic basin, the nitrifiers are retained to prolong the SRT o f the activated sludge system. Additionally, the function o f RBC was to replace the conventional nitrification reactor. Simultaneously, the conflict between nitrogen and phosphorus removal as a function o f SRT was resolved. ,

Drawbacks: Though the experimental set up seemed convincing in resolving certain primary conflicts, the biggest draw back o f the Su et al. (1996) system was the low removal efficiency o f the total nitrogen (about 70%). Due to increasing stringent guidelines, it is difficult to meet the mandatory requirements by the system. Also, the whole operation needs more space and power to operate, making it an economically infeasible option over others. Possible Reasons For Low T-N Removal Efficiency: It was suggested (Su et al. 1996) that, " the biofilm on the RBC in the anoxic reactor has the same characteristics as those o f the biofilm on the aerobic RBC except the bacteria on the anoxic RBC are dominantly denitrifiers". The above statement is not fully convincing for the reason that both biofilms are in different environment and also the basic principle o f RBC is to expose the discs alternately to wastewater and atmosphere, this helps the growth o f microorganisms on the discs and metabolizes complex biodegradable organic material and nitrogen-containing compounds in the wastewater. Conversely, a closer observation o f the process design diagram reveals that the functional role o f fully submerged RBC at anaerobic and anoxic phases o f the reactor was not fully justified. This could be one o f the reasons for low-level total nitrogen removal efficiency. By introducing a vigorous mixing environment at the anoxic phase, nitrogen removal efficiency o f the process could have been improved.

3.3.0 Phosphorus and COD Removals Using Activated Sludge (AS): Greenburg et al. (1955) proposed that activated sludge could take up phosphorus at levels beyond the normally accepted microbial growth requirements, and many researchers have pointed that the biological sludge, submitted to cyclic anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic conditions, can accumulate and eliminate phosphorus during aerobic phase, in excess o f its normal metabolic requirement. Choi et al. (1996) adopted an activated sludge process, suitably modified so as to combine anaerobic and aerobic conditions in a single reactor and observed for continuous removal o f phosphorus and COD from wastewater with different internal recycle ratios, N/P ratios and varying SRT conditions. A reactor was made o f an acrylic column (10 cm internal diameter and 145 cm height) with the inverted cone bottom. The system consists o f three main parts such as anaerobic zone in the lower part (at 4 liters level mark), the aerobic zone in the upper part (at 6 liters level mark) and the clarifier in the right upper part (at 1 liter level mark) and the column is marked from 1 - 1 1 liters to take samples at different levels for analysis. The mixing and sludge return in the anaerobic zone were achieved in a single reactor by using a mixing paddle powered by a 4-rpm electric motor. Air was fed through a stone diffuser at 6 liters level from the reactor bottom. The sludge used for continuous tests was obtained from the aerobic plant for municipal wastewater treatment plant o f Jungrang, Seoul (South Korea) and this sludge was acclimatized continuously in the synthetic wastewater for 6 weeks, passing through successive anaerobic and aerobic conditions. During the process, effective uptake o f phosphorus took place and activated sludge settled down in the anaerobic zone at the sampling point o f 8 liters level. After

many experiments, an HRT o f 11 hours and anaerobic recycle rate o f 200% o f the influent flow rate were selected. It was demonstrated that presence o f NOx-N (NOs-N and NO 2-N) hampered the release o f phosphorus in the aerobic zone, as did the presence o f molecular oxygen, and reduced the uptake o f phosphorus in the aerobic zone. Based on the aerobic zone volume, an SRT o f 10 days produced a highest percentage o f T-P (94%) and COD (95%) removals, where aerobic internal recycle rate was 100%. Draw Backs: Although the scope o f the experimentation did not include nitrogen removal, the principle is very much relevant and forms core design in chapter 4 for the design and operation o f proposed experimentation, hence the methodology is discussed. It is evident from the above results that, a high rate o f phosphorus and COD removal was achieved. However, in today's evolving technologies, this concept o f removing only phosphorus (no simultaneous removal o f nitrogen) proves to be insufficient as a whole, when there are stringent regulations to restrict the amount o f nutrients present in the treated wastewater before discharging in to the receiving water bodies. Possible ways to incorporate this design for nutrients removal: · The same system can be made use to remove nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously by incorporating an anoxic phase within the reactor by stopping air supply, and nitrogen removal efficiency could be observed · From literature review, it is extensively discussed that the reaction between various microorganism populations lead to a complex characteristics o f this kind

o f single-sludge system, hence there is a need o f different reactors for the growth o f different bacteria to achieve maximum nutrients removal efficiency. Addition o f one more rector with RBC mounted to provide higher sludge age for bacteria would be ideal to achieve the task. Adequately controlling the process during anaerobic/anoxic phosphorus uptake, i.e., using nitrate as an electron acceptor can become a pertinent topic o f the combined process design & operation.

CHAPTER

4: EXPERIMENTATION

4.1.0 Background of Hybrid System Combining CSTR and RBC Reactors: In urbanized regions and small communities, it is difficult to secure a space and much needed capital to construct a new treatment p la n t^ h e proposed process does not separate anaerobic and anoxic zones, thus, contributing together with the reduced total site space, to substantially reducing the investment costs for full-scale pi ants Aand also, ./ RBC reactor can be housed in the modified process design o f existing aerobic zones o f a conventional wastewater treatment plants. Therefore a system, which occupies lesser space and yet efficiently removes the nutrients from municipal wastewater treatment plants has been thought and proposed hereunder. In chapter], various most recent methodologies o f hybrid systems for nutrients removal have been discussed in length and throughout the literature review as cited in the chapter!, no documentation exists that has used CSTR in combination with RBC to explore the possibility o f enhancing the nutrients removal efficiency by this hybrid process. Biological nutrients removal systems are among the most complicated

biochemical operations devised for wastewater treatment, and like the activated sludge systems from which they were derived, they come in a number o f configurations. "^The proposed hybrid biological nutrients removal process is essentially an activated sludge system employing CSTR and RBC, in which anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic phases encourage the growth o f specialized phosphoms storing, nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria with cell recycling for the purpose o f maintaining required concentration o f microorganisms. \

Aerobic breakdown o f insoluble organic matter in a suspended growth reactor is called aerobic digestion, and derobic digesters generally employ a CSTR with a long retention time, allowing ample time for the conversion o f much organic matter in to carbon dioxide and also for nitrification/; Anoxic/aerobic digestion cycles the biomass between anoxic and aerobic conditions to use nitrate formed during nitrification as an electron acceptor in place o f oxygen, thereby reducing the cost o f aeration and pH controls. ! Whereas,/ in rotating biological contactor, microorganism growth attached to I rotating disc accomplish the desired objectives by the same mechanisms used in suspended growth system (for example CSTR), but in a more efficient manner because oxygen transfer is accomplished by the rotation o f discs, which are only half submerged in the to be treated wastewater.^

4.2.0 Impacts of Adverse Bacteria: Not all bacteria are beneficial in biochemical operations; some are a nuisance, two forms o f nuisance bacteria can grow in aerobic/anoxic systems: i) Filamentous: this grows as long strands, or filaments, which become intermeshed with biofloe partieles and interfere with sedimentation. They are called filamentous bacteria. Although a small number o f filaments can provide strength for the biofloe, preventing its disruption by fluid shear forces, too many can act to hold the biofloe particles apart. When this occurs, sedimentation is very inefficient and the biomass will not compact into a sufficiently small volume to allow discharge o f a clear effluent. ii) Foam: another kind o f nuisance bacteria forms copious quantities o f foam in bioreactors that are being aerated for oxygen transfer. The foam can become so deep as to completely cover both the aeration and sedimentation basins, thereby disrupting treatment and posing a danger to plant personnel. The most common nuisance organisms in anaerobic systems are the sulfate-reducing bacteria. It is generally desirable to design anaerobic operations to produce methane because it is a valuable product. If a wastewater contains high concentrations of sulfate, however, sulfate-reducing bacteria will compete for the electron donor, producing sulfide as a product. This not only reduces the amount o f methane produced, but also results in a product that is both dangerous and undesirable in most situations; hence, it is essential to be aware o f the growth characteristics o f such nuisance organisms so that systems that discourage or prevent their growth can be designed (Leslie Jr et al., 1999).

4.2.1 Microbial Community; Perception and Reality Microbial communities in biochemical operations are very complex, involving many trophic levels and many genera and species within a trophic level. Unfortunately, most studies on community structure have been descriptive and the exact roles o f many organisms have not even been defined, much less quantified. This is slowly changing, but many researches still reflect only the procaryotic portion o f the community, and its divisions are usually limited to major groups, such as aerobic heterotrophs, fioc-formers, denitrifiers, nitrifiers, PAOs, etc. However, regardless of the nature and complexity o f the microbial community involved, there are certain fundamental processes that occur universally in biochemical operations. The relative importance o f these processes, and hence the outcome from a biochemical operation depends on the physical configuration o f the operation and the manner in which it is operated. Designer's ability to select and design the appropriate biochemical operation for a specific task depends on ones recognition o f the importance o f the various processes in it and the capability for quantitatively expressing the rates o f these processes (Leslie Jr et al., 1999).

4.3.0 Design Process for Combined CSTR and RBC Reactors: 4.3.1 Different Approaches: Some conflicts have arisen in single system that simultaneously removes nitrogen and phosphorous, as discussed in chapters 2 and 3; therefore, resolving these conflicts and enhancing the process perfomiance are the primary goal o f this modified system. Selecting the sludge retention time o f a process is a major task in BNR processes (Su et al. 1996). Ammonium nitrogen can theoretically be removed by aerobic nitrification, followed by anoxic dénitrification. In the sequence reactions, the autotrophic nitrifier's nitrification is normally a limiting reaction on nitrogen removal. A longer SRT and higher dissolved oxygen conditions become prerequisites for improving nitrification. However, phosphorus removal capacity corresponds to the amount o f waste sludge and its phosphorus content. For a shorter SRT and provided extreme anaerobic stage, polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) can release a higher phosphorus level and accumulate more polyphosphate in anaerobic and aerobic stages, respectively. The process during a shorter SRT yields a better performance in terms o f phosphorus removal (Chuang et al. 1997). Consequently, the difficulties in selecting SRT and DO arise which

simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphoruç. Modifying the process design using CSTR and RBC can eliminate these difficulties. The combined system will provide two kinds o f bacteria populations in the process: suspended activated sludge bacteria (in CSTR reactor) for enhancing the phosphorus removal and biofilm bacteria (in RBC reactor) with a longer sludge age for

improving the nitrification, thus,

combined system looks highly promising in

simultaneously removing nitrogen and phosphorus. This process requires less space, and it can be retrofitted to existing wastewater treatment plants with minimum changes in process design, thereby saving in huge capital cost. \

4.3.2 Materials and Methods: As illustrated in figureS.l, an existing CSTR reactor at Civil Engineering Dept o f Ryerson University, Canada, can be used, in which the combined activated sludge-RBC process can be modified. CSTR reactor: Cylindrical shape, flat base with mixing facility RBC reactor: Rectangular shape The hybrid process is comprised o f conventional anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic activated sludge and a RBC only in the aerobic stage, as illustrated in figure 5.1. This process will provide a longer sludge age for bacteria in the RBC biofilm. The effluent and sludge samples can be collected from one o f the wastewater treatment plants in Greater Toronto Area (GTA), after activating the sludge by passing through successive cycles o f anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic phases, required microorganisms are inoculated. These bacteria are starved and then fed on the sample wastewater to get acclimatized by passing continuously through anaerobic and anoxic phases. The effective volume o f the CSTR and RBC reactors shall be 15 liters and 45 liters respectively (1:3 ratios). The RBC disks are made o f PVC, diameter 300 mm, thickness 2 mm each piece and 8 pieces on the shaft. The total surface area and submerged ratio o f RBC shall be 1.13 m2 and 40% respectively. A variable speed motor device drives RBC and the speed o f the RBC disk shall be about 10.5 meters per minute. The influent wastewater can be brought from Bay plant o f GTA and is analyzed as per standard methods o f APHA for all the parameters.

11) Concentration o f COD is maintained throughout at 2mg/L by introducing acetate time to time 12) To maintain the optimum balance o f incoming food from the influent wastewater and the population o f microorganisms, a portion o f microorganisms is discarded each day; and is termed as waste activated sludge (WAS) 13) Samples are taken and analyzed for every 12 hours from the day one till 7 days 14) Samples are taken for every 6 hours from the 8th day till 12 days 15) Recycling o f return activated sludge (RAS) is 0.25 times the influent flow. 16) All the samples are analyzed for Nitrogen, Phosphorus and COD each time and plotted against the graphs as Concentration Vs Time. 17) Once the cycle o f 12 days SRT is completed, waste activated sludge will be analyzed for Nitrogen, Phosphorus and COD concentration to reconfirm the results obtained from the treated effluent.

4.3.5 Protocol for the Analysis: Following equations are used to calculate the typical parameters, which are found in Appendix A. For mathematical analysis, the data needed are surface area o f CSTR and RBC tanks, average flow in to the system and the specific concentrations o f the incoming wastewater.

If the average flow,

determined:

By using the removal efficiency chart in Appendix A, along with the given concentrations o f B 0D5 and SS, a corresponding percentage removal for each can be read. This value is the percent o f B0D 5 or SS removed. It is now easy to calculate the amount o f BOD5, and SS entering HBNR process as: BOD5= Initial B 0D 5 (1-% removed) (4.2)

But we know that the, flow entering the HBNR process is the same as that which entered the system initially. Therefore, so far, we have the amount o f BOD, SS and flow entering. Let us term parameters as below: = Average flow

Total biomass concentration and active Fraetion:

There are two ways o f expressing the active fraction; either in terms o f COD, or in terms o f TSS. Note that in the first case, the ISS is not eonsidered, since it does not have a COD assoeiated with it, since it is inorganic in nature. Active fraction on a COD basis:

Also note that the active fraction, on a TSS basis, is lower than on a COD basis. This is due to the presence o f the inert inorganic material.

Calculation o f the observed yield involves calculating the amount o f mass formed per day (either in terms o f COD or TSS) and dividing it by the mass o f substrate removed.

Let's do first the calculation for COD basis. The mass o f COD associated with the solids formed in the reactor per day is equal to the total mass o f COD associated with the

So the total mass o f solids wasted per day is equal to 9600*0.106 = 1018 mgCOD/day On a TSS basis, mass o f solids wasted per day is equal to 8936*0.106 = 947 mgTSS/day The mass o f substrate removed per day is equal to F(Ss-Sso) = 6*(400-l)= 2394 mg-COD/day The observed yield on a COD basis is 1018/2394 = 0.43 mg-COD/mg-COD The observed yield on a TSS basis is 947/2394 = 0.40 mg-TSS/mg-COD · · Wasted solids calculated in bullet immediately above. The oxygen requirements can be calculated using: (5.21)

Substituting with the values:
/;0 = 6*(400-1) 1 (1 + 0.2*0.18*9.46)*0.6 1+ 0.18*9.46

It could also be calculated by doing a COD balance across the reactor.

(5.22) However, note that if we are including Xi as part o f Xx, then to do a COD balance,

the equation above needs to be changed to include the addition o f Xi in the feed:
.RO = F * (5-^0 + .A'; * JTr = 6(400 + 50 -1 ) - 0.106 * 9600 = 1676mg - O; /

The small difference between the two COD balances is due to rounding errors, since the numbers for SRT and Fwhad to be truncated. · The nitrogen requirements can be calculated as:

Since we know how much substrate was removed 6*(400-l) = 2394 mg-COD/day, then the total amount o f nitrogen that needs to be supplied to the system is 0.026*2394 = 62.2 m g-N/day · The mass o f phosphorus that needs to be provided to the system is 1/5% f the amount o f nitrogen [Because, there is always a certain amount o f phosphorus that is used to synthesize new heterotrophic biomass (bugs that remove COD), typically about 1/5 o f nitrogen requirements] or 62.2/5=12.4 mg-P/day.

CHAPTER6: RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

6.1.0: Expected Results:
COD removal: Large quantity o f COD is expected to be absorbed and/or uptaken on activated sludge in the anaerobic stage; and residual COD is therefore can be anticipated to be limited to anoxic or aerobic stage, regardless o f the extent to which SRT and DO are varied. In addition, COD sequestered at anoxic stage would influence the phosphoras removal in the process. Nitrogen removal: Already we have understood from the literature review that total nitrogen removal heavily relies on the process SRT. The total nitrogen concentration o f effluent would be lower when the operated SRT is more than 10 days, hence removal efficiency o f 90% and above o f total nitrogen is fairly anticipated. Phosphorus removal: It is expected that the sludge o f SRT 10 days would yield higher phosphorus release and excess uptake than other SRTs in the anaerobic and aerobic phases respectively. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is a stored carbon and energy sources for polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO) on phosphorus uptake and PHA utilization is closely related to phosphorus uptake, both in the anoxic and aerobic stages. The trend o f PAOs to consume stored PHAs for phosphorus uptake is expected. Anoxic phosphorus uptake phenomena enhances the phosphorus removal efficiency in the hybrid system and expected removal efficiency o f total phosphorus in the process is 95% and above.

6.2.0: Conclusion an d R ecom m endation Due to limited scope o f the work, validification o f the discussed hybrid system is not verified by experimentation to compare the results with those o f theoretical ones. It would be a worthwhile effort to fabricate the equipments and conduct the experimentation as discussed earlier, hence, recommended.
