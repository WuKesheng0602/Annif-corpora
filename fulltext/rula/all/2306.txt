ABSTRACT Energy Recovery from an Industrial Clothes Dryer Using a Condensing Heat Exchanger Master o f Engineering 2005, Y ousuf Farooq School o f Graduate Studies, Ryerson University

The aim o f this project was to design a condensing heat exchanger to recover waste heat from an industrial clothes dryer. Industrial cloth dryers are inefficient in their use o f energy because almost all o f the energy input in the dryer is wasted in the atmosphere, and thus there is great potential for heat recovery. This energy can be used to preheat the incoming cold water, and the conventional heater can then heat the water to a final temperature. The warm moist air from the dryer carries both sensible and latent heat, and in order to design this heat recovery condensing heat exchanger, the heat transfer by both mass and sensible heat has to be accounted for. The basis o f this heat and mass transfer problem was the energy balance at the interface, and separate models for the calculation o f latent and sensible heat transfer were used. The mass transfer coefficients were obtained from an analogy with heat transfer, and the unknown interface temperature was solved for iteratively. The data for this design was collected from a 20 kW dryer, and the heat recovery from that dryer was observed to be about 17.3 %. This heat recovery condensing heat exchanger efficiency can be enhanced by the addition o f more coils to the heat exchanger. An improvement in the overall results can be expected if a practical study is done on the condensation heat exchanger for an industrial cloth dryer.

1. Introduction

The recovery o f waste heat from an industrial clothes dryer is a feasible process. Almost all of the energy input in the dryer is wasted in the atmosphere, and this energy may be a good source to preheat the incoming cold water. The conventional heater can then heat the water to a final temperature.

A condensing heat exchanger for heat recovery from an industrial electric clothes dryer has been designed in this project. As shown in Figure 1, the hot exhaust air from the dryer is directed through a duct to a chamber, where horizontal copper pipes are staggered. The cold water flows inside the copper pipes and the hot exhaust air flows horizontally perpendicular to the outer surface o f the copper pipes. A heat transfer process takes place between the hot exhaust air and the cold water. The pre-heated water from the heat recovery heat exchanger can be fed into a conventional heater or other heating equipment to heat the water to a desired temperature.

The temperature of the dryer exhaust (waste heat) and the required outlet temperature of the cold water are two key points for calculating the efficiency of the heat recovery system. As the temperature o f the waste heat is lowered, the efficiency o f the heat recovery system also decreases. The amount o f moisture present in the dryer exhaust is another aspect that can contribute to the enhancement o f the heat transfer rate. As the

relative humidity o f the dryer exhaust becomes higher, the latent heat available for recovery also increases.

F igure 1. Heat recovery condensing heat exchanger.

M oist air from the dryer carries sensible heat o f both air and water vapour, and latent heat o f the water vapour. When the warm moist air first makes contact with the heat exchanger coil, the sensible heat transfer takes place from the air and the water vapour. I f the coil temperature is below the dew point temperature o f the moist air, water vapour condenses on the coil surface. The high humidity conditions (100% to 50%) have a higher proportion o f moisture (higher portion o f latent heat) and a corresponding lower

portion of sensible heat. "For moderate vapour concentration the condensation heat transfer is of the same order as the convection heat transfer and cannot be neglected [1]." To design this condensing heat exchanger, the transfer of heat by both mass and sensible heat has to be accounted for. When the heat transfer process starts, the transport of heat is sensible transfer dominated, but after the steady state condition is achieved, the transport of heat is mass transfer dominated.

During the condensation of water vapour from the moist air, a liquid film forms on the surface of the c^oil and once the steady state condition is achieved, condensation occurs at the interface of the liquid film on the tube wall. As a result o f the condensation process at the interface, there is a bulk velocity of the air towards the wall, as if there is suction at the interface. Only the water vapour condenses; therefore, the water concentration is reduced and suction is induced at the interface. For the case in which the air concentration is very high (moist air), as in this heat exchanger design, the suction effects are negligible.

The design of the heat recovery condensation heat exchanger for a clothes dryer is a complex problem, and it poses great challenges from the heat transfer efficiency point to the performance efficiency, applicability and ease of use in real life applications. For the purpose of this design, the data of typical and commercially available electric clothes dryers were collected. These data included the dryer's inlet and outlet conditions such as dryer load, dryer exhaust (dry bulb, wet bulb) temperatures, dryer humidity and exhaust gas flow rate. All of these parameters were recorded at the beginning, at the intermediate,

and before the com pletion o f the drying cycle. The average o f the values o f the above defined factors has been used as a param eter for the design o f this heat recovery heat exchanger.

A m ajor issue in the heat recovery applications o f the clothes dryer is the presence o f clothes lint in the dryer exhaust. The lint can accum ulate on the tubes o f the heat exchanger and it can create a resistance to the heat transfer and in the air flow. C leaning o f the lint from the heat exchanger tubes is not practically feasible. Therefore, an aircleaning filter can be Used for the rem oval o f lint from the dryer exhaust, and it can be placed after the dryer's prim ary filter for rem oving small particles o f lint rem aining, prior to allow ing the w arm and hum id dryer exhaust air to pass into the heat exchanger. The rem oval o f the condensate w ater from the bottom o f the heat exchanger is another issue that can be resolved by providing a clean-out tray at the bottom o f the heat exchanger. This is done in order to facilitate the condensate w ater from the heat exchanger bottom to drain.

Electrical clothes dryers are m ore popular in the industry than natural gas clothes dryers. Therefore, the design o f this heat recovery dryer is based on an industrial electrie clothes dryer that releases w arm exhaust air at 6 0 °C d ry bulb tem perature and 80% relative hum idity. The flow rate o f the exhaust air is about0.13 w ^ / s . The total pressure is assum ed to be 100 kPa. The cold w ater flow inside the copper tubes has an inlet tem perature o f 8°C and a flow rate o f 6 L/m in. The length o f the copper tube is

1.7

meters for a single coil and four coils have been used. The total length of the copper

tube is 6.42 meters. The schematic of the heat exchanger is shown in Figure 2.

In this heat exchanger design, thin-walled bare copper tubes of 1.0 cm diameter have been used. The heat exchanger shown in Figure 2 has four staggered rows of tubes, and the tubes make nine passes in each row. The tubes are equally spaced in each row by a distance of 1.0 cm , and, at both comers of the heat exchanger, two copper pipes of 2.5 cm diameter serve as headers for the incoming and outgoing water supply. Each row is connected to the inlet and outlet headers separately. This tube configuration is chosen to optimize the heat transfer rate because each row has the same temperature difference (aT = 3] - T^. j between the cold water inside the tube and free stream air; hence, more heat is transferred from the hot stream to the cold stream. Secondly, the wake shed by the first row of tubes produces a high level of free stream turbulence for the

second row o f tubes, thereby increasing the heat and m ass transfer coefficients for the second row.

To understand the heat and mass transfer phenom enon during the condensation o f m oist air, various research papers and books related to the topic have been reviewed. D iscussion from som e m ajor research papers on the issues related to m ass and heat transfer have been included in the literature review section. This helps in understanding the theory, and provides a foundation for the design o f the heat recovery condensing heat exchanger.

A detailed design procedure has been described in the solution procedure section, and a point-by-point iterative design m ethod that estim ates the sensible and latent heat transfer locally through the dry, hum id exhaust condensate and tube w all to the cold w ater has been used. The iterations have been perform ed on a com m ercially available softw are called Engineering Equation Solver (EES) [2], w hich has a built-in function for therm odynam ic properties. A sample hand calculation and the calculations from the softw are have been included in the appendix A.

2. Literature Review

The hot exhaust from the dryer is a mixture of air and water vapour, and it carries both the sensible heat of air and the latent heat of water vapour. Both air and water vapour lose sensible heat when they first contact the cooling coil. Water vapour is removed from the air only when the coil temperature is below the dew point temperature of the moist air. At the point where the coil starts to remove water vapour, the coil carries both the latent and sensible load. In the present problem, the water vapour is removed from the air with simultaneous mass and heat transfer between the air-stream and condensate wetted surface on the cooling coil. "Mass transfer by either molecular diffusion or convection is the transport of one component of a mixture relative to the motion of the mixture and is the result of a concentration gradient [3]."

During the condensation of vapour from the saturated air, the properties o f air such as the heat transmission coefficient of the air film, the air flow rate and the heat capacity of the air stream - vary greatly as the water vapour is removed. The condensation of vapour depends upon the diffusion of the vapour molecules through the air; hence, the mass transmission, as well as the heat transmission coefficient, must be considered.

The writer reviews a research paper presented by J. W. Rose in 1979, in which Rose [4] derived an approximate and theoretical based equation for condensation from a

vapour gas m ixture flow ing parallel to a horizontal plate and norm al to a horizontal tube. These approxim ate equations relate the m ass flux o f vapour to the condensing surface (condensation rate) to the free-stream and condensate surface conditions. "These equations m ay be used w ith suitable equations, giving the heat flux (or condensation rate) in term s o f the tem perature drop across the condensate film, to calculate the heat flux for given free-steam velocity, com position and tem perature and condenser surface

tem perature. The equations are designed to be correct for the lim iting case o f zero and infinite condensation rate [4]."

R ose used the assum ptions m ade by Sparrow, M inkow ycz and Saddy [5]. A ccording to those assum ptions, it is allow ed to take the interface velocity to be zero w hen the vapour-gas boundary layer is taken into consideration, and disregard the contribution to the heat flux in the condensate arising from the tem perature gradient in the vapour-gas m ixture, so that the energy equation for the vapour-gas m ixture is no longer required. The thickening o f the condensate film causes the condensation rate in the direction o f flow to decrease. R ose com pared his results with the num erical solution o f Sparrow et al. [5], and the results were in good agreem ent.

For the case o f a horizontal cylinder, R ose discussed the related case o f heat transfer during flow norm al to a cylinder and for a specified distribution o f surface radial velocity. R ose com pared his approxim ate equations w ith the experim ental results obtained by M ills [6]. The calculations m ade by R ose show excellent agreem ent w ith M ills' observed values.

Mills [6] reported the experimental data for the overall condensation rate for filmwise condensation from the steam-air mixture. The condensation rates were determined by condensate collections, and, for pure steam, the condensation rates were compared with the Nusselt type analyses of Fuji, Uehara and Oda [7] for constant heat flux condensation. For a steam-air mixture. Mills tried to correlate the normalized overall mass transfer conductance as a function of the mass transfer driving force. Mills' data were taken for the saturation temperatures of 307-339K, bulk temperature to wall temperature differences of 1.6-25.6 K, bulk air mass fraction 0-7.8 % and oncoming vapour velocity of 0.28,-0.98 m/s [6].

For pure steam. Mills [6] reported that, because of the relatively large resistance of the condenser tube and inside film, the condensation occurs at nearly uniform heat flux around the tube. Mills compared his results for the pure steam case with uniform heat flux Nusselt type analysis and found that the heat transfer coefficients averaged 3.2 percent higher than the prediction of uniform heat flux Nusselt theory.

For the steam-air mixture, Mills [6] suggested that the reduction in heat transfer can be calculated from a correlation of the mass transfer conductance based on the asymptotic theory of Acrivos for boundary layers under strong suction.

Colburn and Drew [8] presented a theoretical and experimental study of the condensation of binary vapours which still stands as the most significant contribution to date in this field. Using the two-film theory, they postulated that, in addition to the liquid

film on the plate, there w ould be adjacent to it a vapour film, and thus a vapour phase resistance to heat and m ass transfer. C onsidering a saturated vapour o f given tem perature and com position under the condition o f partial condensation, the liquid form ed has a com position different from that o f the bulk vapour. A ssum ing equilibrium at the interface, the vapour com position at that point is different from the bulk vapour com position, and thus the m ore volatile com ponent w ill tend to back diffuse into the vapour [8].

A procedure o f designing a cooler condenser in the presence o f a non-condensable gas w as presented by Colburn and H ougen [9], in which they m entioned that, for various reasons, no simple m ethod o f calculating the m ean tem perature differences based upon the term inal condition is applicable. Indeed, the true average tem perature difference betw een the two fluid stream s interchanging heat m ay be greater than the tem perature difference at the either end o f the condenser. The overall heat transfer coefficient varies from point to point in a cooler condenser. For calculating U A T , C olburn and H ougen [9] used a trial and error m ethod in w hich the rate o f heat transfer through the gas film m ust be equal to that through the tube and the w ater film, that is: hA n-T i) + hi{Ti-T^) =UAT (2.1)

V --------y------- ' sensible heat transfer

The solution o f the above equation requires know ledge o f the tem perature at the interface betw een the condensate and gas phase, 7}, and the corresponding vapour pressure o f the condensate . V arious values are chosen until the desired equality is

obtained, thus giving the value o f U A T at the gas tem perature selected [9].

sparrow et al. [5] analytically explored the effect o f non-condensable gas on condensation in a forced convection laminar boundary layer flow. In their paper, the solutions of the differential equations were found both numerically and by an integral method. For the steam-air system, the heat transfer, with and without the noncondensable gas, was compared for a wide range of conditions. They also examined the effect of the interfacial resistance, that is, a temperature jump at the liquid vapour interface.

The results in the work by Sparrow et al. [5] show that at any fixed temperature difference and fixed free stream temperature level, the heat transfer decreases monotonically as the mass fraction of non-condensable gas increases. The presence of non-condensable gas is more strongly manifested when the condensation takes place at sub-atmospheric pressure. At higher free stream temperature levels and at the lower mass fractions, the heat-transfer ratio qjqo is insensitive to the temperature

difference(Too -7 ^ ) . When free stream temperature 7 ^ decreases, and free stream noncondensable gas mass fraction increases, the heat-transfer ratio becomes more

sensitive to the temperature difference, decreasing as (7^ - 7 ^ ) increases.

"The decrease in the heat transfer rate can be attributed to the build-up of the noncondensable gas at the interface. The effect of such build-up is to lower the corresponding partial pressure of the vapour, which in turn lowers the interface temperature 7} at which the condensation occurs (the interface is at a saturation state). In

11

this w ay, the therm al driving force (t) transfer rate [5]."

is low ered, thereby decreasing the heat

Therekhov et al. [10], in their paper regarding heat and m ass transfer in the condensation o f w ater vapour from m oist air, presented a com putational m odel that was based on the solution o f integral relations o f boundary-layer energy and diffusion using the analogy o f m ass and heat transfer processes. The problem w as solved using integral transport equations and the sim ilarity o f m ass and heat transfer processes. In this m ethod, Therekhov et al. disregarded the effect o f the condensate form ing on the surface, considering its therm al resistance to be negligibly small. "This assum ption is justified because in the m ajority o f the experim ents conducted on the heat transfer o f m oist air in channels, a dropw ise regim e o f condensation w as observed. D rops form ing on the cooled surface are periodically rem oved by the flow ing air stream [10]."

T herekhov et al. perform ed calculations for a w ide range o f param eters in the flow core (7j = 1 0 t o lS ° C , = 0 -1 0 0 % , f = 1x10^^to IxlO ^Pûf) and on the w all,

= - 2 0 to 5 0 °C . The therm o-physical properties w ere determ ined from the param eters o f the w all, and the m ixture enthalpy and the heat o f phase transition w ere taken from the tabulated data and the Lewis num ber as a function o f the vapour concentration.

The calculations perform ed by Therekhov et al. [10], for both lam inar and turbulent regim es o f the flow, show ed that the relative hum idity had a substantial effect on the tem peratures at w hich m axim um vapour condensation is attained. A t the sam e

12

time, the pressure of the gas-vapour mixture had a very slight efkct on Ae wall temperature. Results o f the calculation o f the heat and mass fluxes on the wall &r turbulent moist-air flow along an isothermal surface, and 6 r a variation in relative humidity, showed that an increase in relative humidity in the flow core, leads to a

substantial increase in the beat and mass fluxes. Thus, the intensiAcation o f the heat transfer in saturated air attains practically one order of magnitude relative to dry air flow.

Jia, L. et al. [1] had experimentally investigated the condensation heat transfer of wet flue gas. In this pa;^, Jia et al. noticed that the condensation heat transfer on the wet flue gas was difkrent &om that of pure vapour or the case with the presence of a small amount of non-condensable gas. Since the partial pressure of the water vapour in the wet flue gas was small, the resistance to the mass transfer was large and the condensation of the vapour was difficult. The heat transfer was influenced by the water vapour concentration in the gas mixture. In the experimental range (temperature range 25 - 80°C and water vapour concentration 20-30% ), the heat transfer coefGcient was twice as great as the single-phase convection heat transfer.

Jia et al. [1] had concluded that for a very small amount of vapour (10-20%), the contribution of condensation is not strong; therefore, heat transfer can be treated as a single-phase convection. For moderate v ^ u r concentration, the condensation heat transfer is of the same order as the convection heat transfer and carmot be neglected. In the experimental investigation, when cold water was used to cool wet flue gas, the contribution o f condensation heat transfer was about 3 to 4 times that o f convection heat

13

transfer. W hen the w ater vapour fraction is high, that is over 80%, the convection heat transfer can be neglected.

From the above discussion o f various research papers, it is evident that a m oderate am ount o f concentration o f w ater vapour in the air gives rise to a heat transfer coefficient. O n the other hand, the calculation o f heat transfer coefficient in the case o f m oist-air (m ixture o f w ater vapour and air) is not straightforw ard. The overall heat transfer coefficient varies from point to point in a condensing heat exchanger and it is high where the vapour concentration is high and low where m ost o f the vapour has been removed. The m ean tem perature difference based on the term inal conditions can not be a true average tem perature difference betw een the tw o fluid streams interchanging heat. Hence, calculating the average heat transfer coefficient by using the sim ple m ean tem perature difference (LM TD) is not a correct method.

Recently, N aylor and O osthuizen [11] proposed a m ethod for designing a condensing heat exchanger for recovering energy from an industrial electric clothes dryer. In a chapter published in the "Heat Transfer Calculations 2005," N aylor and O osthuizen [11] proposed a point by point iterative m ethod for calculating the value o f U A T . In that method, the heat transferred was equated locally through the condensate, the wall and the cooling-w ater to the sum o f the latent heat o f the condensate due to the vapour transferred by diffusion, while the sensible heat transfer from the air to the condensate film was ignored. The unknow n interface tem perature and corresponding pressure at the condensate-vapour interface w ere estim ated by an iterative procedure in

C H A PT E R S Solution Procedure
3. 0 Introduction The heat transfer process from the hot exhaust air o f the dryer to the w ater flow ing inside the pipe has four heat transfer modes: m ass transfer o f vapour to the condensate surface, sensible (convection) heat transfer to the condensate film, conduction heat transfer from condensate film to the tube w all, and convection heat transfer from the tube w all to the w ater flow ing inside the tube. To calculate the total heat transfer rate, a therm al resistance m ethod has been used.

To initiate the iterative solution procedure, the m ass transfer resistance w ill be calculated first. In this heat recovery process, w ater vapour w ill be rem oved from air w ith sim ultaneous heat and mass transfer. This com bined heat and m ass transfer problem can be calculated by using C hilton-C olbum analogy w ith H ilpert's em pirical correlation for forced convection over a cylinder [6] [12].

In the case o f external flow, w hen m ass transfer occurs at the convective surface, the N usselt num ber and Sherw ood num ber are defined as follows:

3.3 Condensation Heat Transfer

The condensation heat transfer coefficient for the outer surface o f the pipes can be calculated by using an equation for laminar film condensation on the outer surface of a horizontal tube bank [11][14]. The average Nusselt number for the case of a vertically arranged horizontal tube bank that has n tubes with a diameterD is:

In the above equation, the liquid film properties are determined at condensate mean film temperature, which is + T] )/ 2 . The temperature difference between the pipe

surface temperature7^, and the mean vapor film temperature (interface temperature)/]., is unknown. It is important to make an initial guess for the temperature drop between the pipe surface temperature and the vapour film temperature,?} - T ,, to begin the iteration procedure. As the iteration process proceeds, these assumed values will be corrected to the temperature difference71-7}.

3.4 Internal Forced Convection

Internal forced convection occurs w hen the fluid goes into the tube at a uniform tem perature that is less than that o f the tube surface tem perature. Internal flow is the one in w hich flow is confined by a surface such as flow in a pipe. Internal flow dealing w ith cooling or heating is usually treated using convection correlations [12].

M any em pirical correlations for calculating the heat transfer coefficient for fully developed internal flolv can be found in the literature. The recent and m ore accurate correlation recom m ended by the H andbook o f H eat T ransfer is the G nielinski correlation w hich is accurate w ithin ± 10% in the range ofO.5 < Pr < 106 a n d 2300 < R e ^ < 5 x 1 0 ^ [15].

After calculating the total heat transfer rate for the heat exchanger, a better estimate of the interface temperature T, can be made. Referring to the thermal resistance diagram in Figure 3, the improved interface temperature is

Tj = T i -q R ,ot

(3.47)

To proceed with the next iteration, an improved estimate of the temperature drop across the condensate film 7} - T, is needed. This quantity can be obtained using the

Im proved values have now been calculated for all the param eters that w ere guessed in the first iteration. For the iteration procedure, the com m ercially available heat transfer softw are EES [2] has been used (for EES sam ple calculations, see A ppendix B). The procedure described above can be repeated until convergence is achieved.

3.6 Condition after the Coil

The heat exchanger in this heat recovery dryer has four banks o f vertically arranged horizontal tubes and it is required to calculate the heat transfer rate for each tube bank. The analysis in this case proceeds along the same lines with the outlet conditions of the first bank becoming the inlet conditions for the second bank, and so on.

The composition of a given moist air can be described by means of the humidity ratio w , defined as the ratio of the mass of the water vapour to the mass of the dry air. (3.49)

w-

If the heat exchanger is treated as a control volume, then, at steady state, the amount of dry air and water vapour contained in a control volume can not vary. Thus, for each component, the incoming and outgoing mass flow rates must be equal.

'Mol = /M g2 (Dry air)

(3.50)

'^v 2 + ' " h.i ^ '^ v i (Water)

(3.51)

The mass flow rates of water vapour can be expressed in terms of humidity ratios as TM ^i = wiWq andwv2 expressed as ^^d the mass balance for water vapour can be

(wj - W 2 ), where ivj and W 2 are the values of specific humidity

before and after the coil, respectively, and the humidity ratio for the state 2 can be expressed as

31

m a

(3.52)

Sim ilarly, for this problem , the conditions at state 2 (after the first bank) can be calculated using the condensation rate and the m ass flow rate o f dry air on the

first coil. The specific hum idity before the coil, w j, can be determ ined by assum ing ideal gas behaviour as:



'

In the m oist air condition, the ratio o f m olecular w eight o f w ater vapour to that o f dry air is approxim ately 0.622 and the above equation can be w ritten as; w, = 0 . 6 2 2 - ^ Pa\ The m ass flow rate o f the dry air can be determ ined by ideal gas law as: (3.56)

=

(3-57)

Evaluating Equation 3.52 and using the m ass flow rate o f d iy air and the condensation rate from converged solution, the hum idity ratio after the first tube bank can be calculated.

32

The moist air outlet temperature of the coil is unknown. An energy balance or the first law analysis can be used to determine the outlet temperature that will be the fi-ee stream temperature of the second tube bank. The energy rate balance reduces at the steady state to:

q = rha[(/Zg2 ~ K \ ) ~ M K\ + ^2^v2 + (^1 " ^ 2 ] where and h^2 &re the enthalpies of the diy air,

(3-59) and h^2 ^re the enthalpies of the

water vapour at the tube bank inlet and outlet temperature respectively, and hj is the enthalpy of liquid water at inlet temperature.

An iterative solution procedure is used to calculate the outlet temperature of the first tube bank or the inlet temperature of the second tube bank. For the iteration procedure, the commercially available EES software [2] has been used. To initiate the iteration process, a "guess" value for this temperature is assumed to get the enthalpy values until the above equation converges. The temperature at which the convergence is achieved will be the free stream temperature for the second tube bank. Using this fi'ee stream temperature and the specific humidity ratio W 2 , the conditions for state 2 can be

determined completely.

After determining the condition for state 2, the analysis proceeds along the same lines as the first tube bank. The heat transfer rate for all four tube banks can be calculated with the outlet conditions of the first bank becoming the inlet conditions for the second bank, and so on.

In a steady state condition, condensation occurs at the liquid film interface on the wall. As a result of the condensation process at the interface, there is a bulk velocity of the air towards the wall, as if there is suction at the interface. Only the water vapour condenses; therefore, the water concentration is reduced and suction is induced at the interface [17]. At a steady state condition, the condensation rate can be defined as:

The basis of this heat and mass transfer problem was the energy balance at the interface, and the heat transfer from the gas phase was viewed as made up of sensible cooling of non-condensable gas and the contribution due to mass transfer, that is, the latent heat due to condensation of the diffused vapour at the interface. Separate models for the calculation of latent and sensible heat transfer were used. The mass transfer coefficients were obtained from an analogy with heat transfer, and the unknown interface temperature was solved for iteratively.

The tabulated results show that the condensation of vapour contributed more to the heat transfer than the sensible heat component. The latent heat transfer is 84.3 % of the total heat transfer, whereas the sensible heat transfer is 15.68 % of the total heat transfer. Thus, the latent heat component is 5 times higher than the sensible heat component.

Heat transfer by radiation was not taken into account and the effects of interfacial shear stress were neglected. It can be seen in the appendix that the suction effect for this problem was found to be 17% of the free stream velocity, and therefore it was ignored. The mass transfer effects were the main resistance to the condensation heat transfer. Hence, it is not expected that the improvement of the condensation model would improve the heat transfer rate. From the results, it can also be observed that after the first coil, the free stream temperature reduced by 0.8 °C and the relative humidity increased by 1.1%; hence, the heat transfer rate in the second coil was reduced by 21 W. Similarly, a reduction in

39

tem perature can be observed in the third coil, but the heat transfer rate was reduced by only 20 W . It is evident that the heat transfer rate decreased by 17 W in the fourth coil, and the reason for this could be the 4% increase in the relative hum idity w hile the dry bulb tem perature decreased.

The m ain purpose o f this project was to determine the am ount o f heat available to be recovered from an industrial cloth dryer. The data for this design w as collected from a 20 kW dryer, and the heat recovery from that dryer was observed to be about 17.3 %.

A sim ilar m odel was studied for a single coil by N aylor and O osthuizen [11] in w hich heat transfer only by the diffusion o f vapour was considered. Furtherm ore, the free stream tem perature and relative hum idity were considered as 45 °C and 90%,

respectively. The heat transfer rate calculated for the single coil was 375 W. A significant im provem ent can be observed in the present model where both the latent heat transfer and the sensible heat transfer were considered, and the free stream tem perature was taken as 60°C w ith 80% relative humidity. The average overall heat transfer rate was 2.3 times higher than that in the previous study done by [11]. The average latent heat transfer rate was 1.9 tim es higher than that in the previous study. The reason for the im provem ent in latent heat transfer was that the warm air (60°C) carried m ore m oisture than the cold air (4 5 ° C ). The im provem ent in the overall heat transfer rate due to the sensible heat was only 16% on average. This condensing heat exchanger efficiency can be im proved by adding m ore coils to the heat exchanger, provided that the pressure drop in the heat exchanger is kept to a perm issible value.

Using this result, an improved estimate of the total heat-transfer rate to the condenser coils can be obtained:

q = m,,Cp, ( r ,, . - 7;,. ) = 0.1(4192)(10.15 - 8) = 901PF

Condition after the Coil

Where A^,andA^2 ^re the enthalpies of the dry air and

To initiate the iterative solution to calculate the moist air outlet temperature o f the first tube bank, a value of = 59° C is assumed (note that for the first iteration a good

guess for the coil outlet temperature is to take TC less than the free stream inlet temperature). At this temperature, the enthalpy of the air and water vapour are determined from the tabulated data as follows; =333808, A,, =2.609x10% A,; =332801, /i, 2 =2.607x10'

-q[-m ]*-92W From the above calculation, it can be noticed that convergence to the heat transfer rate has not been achieved at the guess te m pe ra tu re = 59 °C . A new temperature value is guessed each time until the convergence is achieved. The complete converged solution has been achieved using EES, and the EES solution is attached in the Appendix.
