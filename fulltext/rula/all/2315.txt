DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTELLIGENT AGENT-BASED SUPPLY CHAIN SIMULATION SYSTEM
By Yucheng Wang

Mechanical Engineering, Ryerson University, 2011 Abstract An intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation model, in which each enterprise/consumer is represented by an agent, is designed. There are six layers in this supply chain simulation model: raw material providers, component manufacturers, product assemblers, product holders, retailers, and final customers. Each entity in the supply chain represented by an agent has five components: interface, task distribution, business processing activities, knowledge management and decision support, and information storage. A detailed agent structure is designed and various functions of an agent including communication among agents are described. Issues in supply chain integration, information sharing among supply chain partners, demand forecasting, supply chain risk management, and automated communication and negotiation, could be simulated and studied by using the proposed system. Based on the proposed supply chain simulation model, a generic six-layer prototype mobile phone supply chain simulation system is designed, developed and implemented. The system allows a user to setup and adjust a large number of parameters, including (1) simulation period, loan and saving interest rates; (2) customers' behavior and market demand; (3) each retailer's initial cash, loan, market share, inventories, Order Amount Policy and Order Point Strategy; (4) each product holder's initial cash, loan, market share, inventories, Order Amount Policy, Order Point Strategy and inventory strategy; (5) each assembler's and component agent's initial cash, loan, inventories, Order Amount Policy, Order Point Strategy, production strategy, and production capacities; and (6) each material provider's initial cash, loan, inventory, production strategy, and production capacities. Extensive simulation studies are carried out to examine and compare many supply chain management strategies and agent behaviors. This system can be used to test which strategy is most suitable in certain environments. The generic supply chain simulation system developed can be used in a number of ways, including: as an analysis tool for an entity in a supply chain from the entity's perspective; as a tool for studying supply chain coordination and integration from the perspective of an entire supply chain, or portion of it; as a tool to design supply chains by answering "what-if" questions.

Chapter 1 Introduction
Any kind of product that people consume cannot be manufactured and sold to customers by only one company. The product must complete many steps and pass through several companies. For example, any model of Nokia mobile phones needs approximately 350 components to make one device (Nokia, 2005). Many steps are required to make a mobile phone (Peterson, 2006; Reinhardt, 2006). First, mineral substances are obtained from mines and then are smelted to extract raw materials in raw material processing factories. Basic elements (such as resistors, capacitors, highly-integrated circuits, memory chips, plastic, metal and alloy) are produced by basic element manufacturers from raw materials. Components (such as liquid-crystal displays, keypads, plastic cases, printed circuit boards, batteries, buzzers, and antennas) are made in component manufacturing facilities using basic elements and raw materials. A

mobile phone is then assembled and tested by an assembler. In order for a mobile phone to arrive at an end user, it is sold to a mobile telecommunication service provider, then it is delivered to a mobile phone retailer store, where the end user can buy it. Therefore, a mobile phone supply chain consists of the mining industry, raw material factories, basic elements and component manufacturers, the assembler, the mobile telecommunication service provider, the mobile phone retailer, and the end user. A supply chain is a set of related enterprises and consumers forming a network which produces and consumes a type of product. Enterprises may include raw material providers, vendors, manufacturers, warehouses, distributors, and retailers. In a supply chain, there are three typical flows: material in a forward direction, information bi-directionally, and currency in a backward direction. Some of the activities in a supply chain include: quotation, order (purchase), production, storage, delivery, sales, negotiation, and customer service. Supply chain management is the science of designing and developing a set of technologies to make a supply chain work efficiently. The main stages of a supply chain
1

include purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, and selling. Every entity in a supply chain is eager to minimize costs and maximize profits. This can result in conflicting purchase, production and sales strategies between partners. The objective of maximizing the whole supply chain value is more difficult because of the marketing uncertainty and information opacity. Since middle of the last century, many techniques and methodologies have been developed to make the supply chains more smooth and efficient. For example, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (such as SAP, Oracle-JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, Oracle-PeopleSoft Enterprise, and Microsoft Dynamics NAV) have been developed and applied to provide comprehensive and easily accessed data, and to implement supply chain functions within a business (Microsoft, 2007; Oracle, 2007a, 2007b; SAP, 2007). Vendor-managed-inventory (VMI) techniques have been developed to increase manufacturer's profits by satisfying customer demand with lower inventory, and decreasing retailers cost. To reduce inventory and to eliminate sources of manufacturing waste, the just-in-time (JIT) strategy, lean manufacturing, assemble-to-order (ATO), and make-to-order (MTO) policies have been developed. Other supply chain management technologies and tools have been developed including: manufacturing planning and control (MPC); customer relationship planning (CRP); material requirements planning (MRP); distribution requirement planning (DRP); enterprise application integration (EAI); business activity management (BAM) and; flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) (Vollmann et al., 2004). The rapid growth of the Internet and of computer communication techniques has provided many opportunities for the improvement of processes and behaviors in supply chain management. Supply chain integration, which unites a business' internal processes with some external processes relating to its partners, is one of the important improvements. By using this technique, the business can eliminate redundancies, decrease errors, enhance efficiencies, reduce costs, and speed up product time to market (Wisner et al., 2005). The e-Supply chain, an Internet-based supply chain management technique, has the characteristics of high speed, low cost, fluent communication and
2

collaboration among partners (Luo et al., 2001; Sadeh et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2005). The e-marketplace provides an easy and costless way for supply chain partners to exchange products (Brunn et al., 2002; Rudberg et al., 2002; Di Noia et al., 2004; Murtaza et al., 2004). The Internet also provides an efficient channel for supply chain partners to share information. Communication and negotiation between partners is the most important of all of those activities.

1.1 Supply Chain Characteristics   
A supply chain is a dynamic, uncertain, stochastic, and complex network which is characterized by cooperation, collaboration and competition. It is highly reliant on information technology (IT). First, a supply chain faces many uncertainties and difficulties, such as the development of new products, and unpredictable events (factory fires or explosions, typhoons, and earthquakes). Second, the relationships among partners in a supply chain network are not only characterized by cooperation and collaboration, but also by competition. To reduce costs, every enterprise wants to obtain products and services from a partner at lower prices, while the partner's goal is to sell those products and services for maximum profit. Ultimately, a company's supply chain performance is highly dependent on the quality of the information system(s) applied. A good supply chain management software, such as SAP, PeopleSoft, or JD-Edward, allows the company to quickly make decision by immediately obtaining needed information. Although supply chain management has been studied for many years, researchers will continue to search for ways to make improvement. In this research, when designing and developing an intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation system, many supply chain management methodologies, including supply chain integration, information sharing, demand forecasting, supply chain risk management, inventory management, supply chain intelligence, automated communication and negotiation, multi-agent

3

technologies, customer/supplier relationship management, and multi-objective decision making, are considered.

1.2 Research Objectives 
The overall objective of this research is to design and develop an intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation system. In this system, a company will be represented by an agent, and the agent structure will be designed according to the author's proposed supply chain focused enterprise architecture. Based on this system, some supply chain management related technologies can be tested and studied. The sub-objectives of this research include: 1. To design a supply chain focused enterprise architecture. The architecture considers all aspects of an enterprise, from external factors to internal factors; from soft factors to hard factors; from uncontrollable factors to manageable factors; and from equipment factors to knowledge factors. 2. To design an intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation model. The agent structure relies on the proposed enterprise architecture. The model describes the ability for communication and negotiation between agents, to utilize knowledge, to forecast customer demand, and to test supply chain management technologies. 3. To design, develop, implement, and test a prototype mobile phone supply chain simulation system. The system has six layers ­ customers, retailers, product holders, assemblers, component manufacturers, and raw materials. A large number of factors and parameters affecting the performance of a supply chain are considered. 4. To carry out extensive studies to examine many supply chain management strategies and agent behaviors, and to determine which strategy is most suitable in certain environments.

Chapter 2 Literature Review on Supply Chain Management
Supply chain management and logistics have been popular research topics for a long time. Some of the current research issues are: · · · · · · · · · · Supply chain integration (Van Der Vaart and Van Donk, 2004), Information sharing (Lee et al., 2004; Chen and Lee, 2009), Demand forecasting (Mentzer and Moon, 2005), Inventory management (Mishra and Raghunathan, 2004), Price discrimination (Chen et al., 2005; Anderson and Dana, 2009), E-marketplace (Laudon and Traver, 2004), Supply chain risk management (Jüttner et al., 2003), Automated negotiation and communication (Yuan and Turel, 2004), Knowledge management (Halley et al., 2010; Jin and Rong, 2011), Multi-objective decision making (Macal and North, 2002, 2005; Gupta and Sivakumar, 2005), · Multi-agent technique (Nissen, 2001).

Although focused on different aspects including: making the entire supply chain more reliable, saving processing time, reducing supply chain failure risk, and increasing profits and decreasing costs, these methodologies and techniques have the same overall objective: to make a supply chain more efficient and effective.

2.1 Supply Chain Integration 
Although there is no common definition of supply chain integration, its objective is to eliminate the barriers between business partners in order to make the supply chain more efficient (Naylor et al., 1999; Van Der Vaart and Van Donk, 2004). The challenge

6

is how to coordinate partners in a supply chain in order to improve its performance in areas, such as reducing cost, increasing service level, and decreasing the bullwhip effect (Simchi-Levi et al., 2004). The ideal integration situation for a supply chain is that all the information about the supply chain should be shared among all the partners. This includes all the partners' inventory, production planning, demand forecasting, and real time orders. In reality, complete supply chain integration is an ideal but unattainable situation. It is difficult to implement because of distrustful relationships and asymmetry of information values (Simatupang and Sridharan, 2001). Current supply chain integration is focusing on sharing partial information, and has already brought significant value for many businesses. This is especially true for third party logistics companies and manufacturing supply chains using just-in-time (JIT), lean and agile strategies (Van Der Vaart and Van Donk, 2004). Frohlich and Westbrook (2001) used arcs to represent the integration degree of a business supply chain. If a business only wants to share little information with its partners, it has a narrow arc of integration; if it wants to share more information, it has a broad arc. After examining 322 global manufacturing companies they classified them into five categories of integration arc degree depending on their supplier and customer integration strategies. Frohlich and Westbrook concluded that the broader the arc a business has, the more performance improved. Harrigan (1985) depicted supply chain integration from four integration dimensions: stage, breadth, degree and form. Stages of integration are the number of steps in a supply chain that the business wants to participate in, from initial ultra-raw materials to interaction with final consumers. Breadth of integration is the number of activities that the business performs at a stage. Degree of integration is the proportion of the total output of a product or service that the business holds. Form of integration indicates the ownership of an integrated unit. Briscoe et al. (2004) demonstrated an integration technology that has emerged in the semiconductor industry. The function of managing components' quality in manufacturing is moved to the upstream first-tier and second-tier suppliers, using the
7

Standardized Supplier Quality Assessment (SSQA) criteria and the Small Business Operating System (SBOS). Other methods for helping supply chain integration include: vendor managed inventories (VMI); quick response; collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR); and multi-level supply control (MLSC). Siau and Tian (2004) presented a conceptual structure of supply chain integration using new technologies including: Wireless and Mobile Techniques, extensible markup language (XML), simple object access protocol (SOAP), common object request broker architecture (CORBA), distributed component object model (DCOM), Enterprise JavaBeans, .NET, and Semantic WEB. These technologies are based on both Internet and e-Business. Kemppainen and Vepsalainen (2003) analyze and predict trends in industrial supply chains and networks from the early 1990s to the early 2010s. Data was collected through 25 interviews with managers in six supply chains in electronics, mechanical and paper industries. In the early 1990's, companies often collected information from customers but did not share it with upstream partners (suppliers). Currently, most companies focus on integration with their first-tier suppliers and customers while some build up collaborative relationships extending to second-tier or even third-tier suppliers and customers. Business processes are the focus of integration. By the early 2010's, it is predicted that about half of businesses will focus on coordinating supply chains and networks, and supply chain integration will be focused on inter-enterprise processes. They confirmed that supply chain collaboration and information sharing are the keys to successful supply chain integration. Hvolby and Trienekens (2010) reviewed various business integration models, such as supply chain operations reference-model (SCOR); collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR); ISA-S95 (a standard of enterprise and manufacturing integration developed by the Instrumentation, Systems and Automation Society Consensus Committee); and specifications developed by open applications group (OAG). Although in the beginning the SCOR model only focused on planning, sourcing, making, and delivering, it has now added more processes including return,
8

performance evaluation (delivery reliability, responsiveness, flexibility, costs and asset management efficiency), order fulfillment, and supplier relationships. CPFR focuses on planning, forecasting, and replenishment which can improve supply chain overall efficiency. ISA-S95 emphasizes business planning and logistics, manufacturing operations management, manufacturing process systems, and sensing production process. OAG concentrates on business information sharing through an extensive group of XML schemas. While ISA-S95 is good for design models and terminology, OAG is adept at describing implementation elements. With collaboration, OAG and ISA-S95 work well on the development of integration standards for process, discrete, and mixed-mode manufacturers.

2.2 Information Sharing 
In a supply chain network, each participant has a lot of data and knowledge itself as well as its partners. This includes production planning, sales planning, procurement planning, inventory, productivity, forecasted demand, its suppliers and buyers, production/service capacity, production lead time, order lead time, delivery lead time, and historical sales data. Some of this knowledge is private while some is public. Many studies have confirmed: the greater the information sharing, the more efficient the supply chain. A typical phenomenon in supply chain demand information asymmetry, also called demand variability or distortion, is the "bullwhip effect" (Lee et al., 1997). Because of lead times for some or all participants, and real time demand in downstream partners unable to be captured by upstream ones, demand information is amplified at every stage in a supply chain. Consequently, the inventory cost to the upstream side is raised. Lee et al. (2000) analyzed why and how the inventory cost is reduced with real time demand information sharing in a two level (manufacturing and retailing) supply chain. They also discussed techniques and methodologies developed by other companies

9

and researchers to reduce the bullwhip effect from four aspects: demand signal processing, order batching, price fluctuations, and shortage gaming (Lee et al., 2004). Simatupang and Sridharan (2001) illustrated the main benefits of information sharing in supply chains which include: helping participants achieve contractual clarity, allowing participants to respond quickly to market uncertainties, facilitating supply chain coordination, and reducing opportunistic behaviors. They designed a framework to illustrate the relationship between information sharing and decision making and explained how information is shared in this framework. In most situations information sharing will not bring equivalent benefit to each partner. As a result the lower benefitting participants occasionally prefer to provide distorted information. Methods to implement a win-win strategy, such as use of service levels, volume discounts, and wholesale price policies (Iyer and Bergen, 1997) as well as the employment of transfer pricing, consignment, and additional backlog penalty methods are discussed (Lee and Whang, 1999). The term supply chain collaboration, or collaborative supply chain (Simatupang and Sridharan, 2002; Barratt, 2004; Simatupang et al., 2004), is an application of information sharing in supply chains. Gaur et al. (2005) studied the influence of demand information sharing in a two-stage supply chain model for three situations: (i) the manufacturer infers demand information from the retailer's orders; (ii) the retailer shares the demand information with the manufacturer; and (iii) the manufacturer uses the most recent orders in its production planning. They found that the manufacturer's safety-stock is reduced 16% in first two situations, but increased in the third. Unlike most research, which assumes the retailer does not use order smoothing and the supplier has full knowledge of the retailer's demand model and order policy, Chen and Lee (2009) adopted a general retailer demand model combined with an order smoothing policy. They found that although the supplier does not know the retailer's demand model or order policy, information sharing could benefit both supplier and retailer.
10

Based on a reverse supply chain of the automobile industry, Olorunniwo and Li (2010) investigated information sharing and collaboration techniques and the supply chain performance of 600 companies. They found that information sharing increases collaboration among supply chain partners and directly improve supply chain performance. Conversely, they also found that collaboration between partners increases information sharing and enhances supply chain performance. They further pointed out that collaboration is the foundation of information sharing.

2.3 Demand Forecasting 
Supply and demand forecasting is one of the most important elements for a successful supply chain. With forecasting information, decision makers can determine which selling/buying method(s) should be adopted, and can produce efficient production plans. Forecasting is not a new topic and there are currently many forecasting approaches. DeLurgio (1998) classified forecasting methods into five categories: (1) Time series methods including: simple regression, moving averages, exponential smoothing, decomposition, census method, univariate

autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Fourier series; (2) Causal/multivariate methods including: multiple regression, multivariate ARIMA, and cyclical; (3) Qualitative/technological methods such as: panel consensus, sales force composite, DELPHI, historical analogy, and relevance trees; (4) Artificial intelligence methods including: expert systems, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms; and (5) Combination methods. In business marketing disciplines, demand forecasting often uses qualitative approaches (jury of executive opinion, sales force composite, survey of buyer intentions,

11

and DELPHI), or quantitative methods (time-series techniques: moving average, trend fitting, exponential smoothing, adaptive control, and ARIMA) or, causal techniques (regression, econometrics, leading indicators, diffusion index, Input-Output analysis, and life-cycle analysis) (Bingham et al., 2005; Mentzer and Moon, 2005). Knowledge-based decision support systems and other artificial intelligence-based techniques are not very common in supply and demand forecasting due to their difficulty and complexity in implementation. DeLurgio (1998) stated that forecasting results which come from good models of expert systems, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms are more reliable because of demand uncertainties. Based on a simultaneous equations model (SEM) relating cost of sales, inventory and gross margin for retailers, Kesavan et al. (2010) presented a simultaneous equations forecast model. The model has many variables including: selling, general and administrative expenses, store growth, capital investment per store, index of consumer sentiment, accounts-payable-to-inventory ratio, and lagged values of cost of sales, inventory, and margin. To test the performance of the model, they used annual and quarterly data of many U.S. retailers listed on NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ for the 1993 to 2007 fiscal years. Compared with other time series forecasting models, this model is more accurate, because it has either a lower mean absolute percentage error or a lower median absolute percentage error. Taylor and Xiao (2009) built a news-vendor supply chain model. The newspaper market has the following characteristics: demand uncertainty, short product life cycle, and retailers taken the price. In the model, the manufacturer adopted two promotion strategies for retailers: a rebate contract and a return contract. Using this model, they compared the whole supply chain performance between retailers using superior forecasting technology and retailers no forecasting. They found that both manufacturers and retailers benefit from the retailer's forecasting when using either return or rebate contracts. In addition, return contract is the optimal strategy among all contracts. The conclusion is suitable for computer, electronics, fashion, and toy industries.
12

2.4 Inventory Management 
Inventory management affects supply chain efficiency. Inventory exists at many locations in a supply chain: raw material provider, factory, vendor,

warehouse/distributor, and retailer. Current research on inventory management focuses on: (1) inventory strategies between vendor and retailers; and (2) inventory strategies for manufacturers. The strategy of vendor-managed inventory (VMI), in which retailers' stock is controlled by the vendors or manufacturers, has been adopted by many retailers (Lee et al., 2000; Mishra and Raghunathan, 2004; Sari, 2007). After analyzing performance under retailer-managed inventory (RMI) and VMI strategies, Mishra and Raghunathan (2004) pointed out that VMI strategies intensified the competition between different manufacturers with similar products, and result in more profits for retailers. Benefits for retailers include reduced costs by transferring inventory costs to manufacturers, and less chance to lose sales because sufficient stock is provided by manufacturers. The main benefit for a manufacturer is that it will not lose customers. Sales can be increased by selling to competitors' customers when competing brands are out of stock. Moinzadeh (2002) analyzed the inventory performance of a multi-echelon inventory system with information exchange. In that system, Moinzadeh (2002) considered a single product with one supplier and multiple identical retailers using a Q and R policy (a retailer's order for Q units will be placed when its inventory position reaches R). Moinzadeh (2002) found that the supplier and retailers can significantly decrease inventory levels if the system shares inventory (or order) information at the retailers' side for intermediate Q values. Haksever and Moussourakis (2005) presented a mixed-integer programming model to optimize multiple products' inventories under multiple constraints in manufacturing and service industries. Constraints included order numbers for each product, amount of each order, intervals between any two adjacent orders, and cycle
13

time of each product. This model can deal with a large number of linear constraints and products, and can be solved using personal computers. Bollapragada et al. (2004) discussed the inventory management and supply performance problem in assembly systems with random supply capacities and demands. They presented a supply chain model with uncertain supply capacity, and discussed its impact on the steady-state inventory level. They further proposed a quick decomposition method to get near-optimal base-stock levels for components. This resulted in the possibility of reducing safety stock cost by one third. They pointed out that the cost reduction from improving supply performance was evident in the following situations: (1) demand variability is high; (2) the number of components is high; (3) the target service level is high; and (4) the end product is more expensive. Shang et al. (2009) presented coordination mechanisms in decentralized serial inventory systems for batch ordering. For a multiple stage series inventory system, they analyzed three scenarios representing different information integration: echelon, local, and quasilocal. Each stage ordered an integer multiple of a base order quantity (or batch size) with fixed cost, linear holding and backorder cost. In the echelon scenario, in which each stage knows every other stage's inventory and cost information, they developed a coordination mechanism to achieve the true minimum long-run average cost. In the local scenario, in which each stage knows only its own inventory and cost, they developed a coordination mechanism to induce the stages to choose the best local-stock policy. In the quasilocal scenario, in which each stage knows its own inventory, cost and demand, they presented a similar coordination mechanism to achieve the optimal system-wide cost.

2.5 Price Discrimination 
Expected prices of a product are different for different customers according to their purchasing power and spending strategies. By using a price discrimination method,

14

a retailer can increase its profits. Varying prices in different stores (depending on competition), rebate promotion, and varying prices with different packaging are typical price discrimination examples. Chen et al. (2005) analyzed the seller's profit after rebates. They pointed out: (1) the rebate promotion method is better suited to consumers with moderate incomes, but it does not benefit sellers who sell the goods to the very high or very low income consumers; (2) the rebate promotion method is better suited to new products, complex products, and occasionally purchased products, while it is not suitable for low involvement and simple products; (3) the greatest benefit of the rebate method is that some consumers do not redeem the rebates; (4) the redemption cost should be not too high or too low. They also compared the benefits from the rebate method with another price discrimination method ­ the coupon approach, and explained that the rebate method is more profitable for sellers than the coupon approach. Anderson and Dana (2009) pointed out that only few situations are suitable to adopting price discrimination strategies. Another method of price discrimination is personalized pricing (PP), in which different customers are charged different prices by a firm according to the customer's willingness to pay. Choudhary et al. (2005) discussed the relationship between personalized pricing and quality differentiation, and the profit influence for firms that may or may not adopt PP tactics in various situations. They concluded the following: (1) for two firms in competition, if the low-quality firm applies a PP strategy, it should use a non-monotonic pricing schedule; (2) when a high-quality firm applies a PP strategy, other firms will enhance their product quality to compete with it; and (3) when the firm using PP has low quality, other firms will decrease their product quality to reduce their prices. Firms using PP acquire their profits by attracting more customers, while the benefit to the customer is the lower price or higher quality product. By utilizing a stylized analytical model to identify and understand key trade-offs driving the decision to use a Name-Your-Own-Price (NYOP) retailing channel, Wang et
15

al. (2009) discovered some phenomena and drew conclusions. When there is unsold capacity in a travel industry, the service provider cannot maintain high prices if he adopts a NYOP strategy. The service provider will only get profit if the available capacity is not too large relative to the expected number of business travelers and their willingness to pay. Before the extent of travel demand is known, it is better to set the wholesale price in the NYOP channel. If the service provider can determine optimal capacity, when the cost of this capacity is small, the single channel (NYOP) is a good choice. But when the cost of capacity is large, the dual channels of NYOP and contract are recommended. In addition, if the service provider adopts vertical integration, higher profits will be obtained.

2.6 Emarketplace 
Electronic marketplace (e-marketplace) is a Web-based marketplace where buyers and sellers exchange information about their supply and demand to achieve business transactions. Laudon and Traver (2004) categorized e-marketplaces into four classes according to supply characteristics and partners' relationships: E-Distributor, E-Procurement, Exchange, and Consortia. After analyzing opportunities and challenges in e-marketplaces, Murtaza et al. (2004) pointed out that integration is one of the biggest challenges for a company joining an e-marketplace since most e-marketplaces cannot be integrated with back-end systems. An e-marketplace has two advantages over traditional marketplaces: market intelligence and supply chain integration (Bloch and Catfolis, 2001). Market intelligence does not mean that a buyer finds out the lowest price and a supplier finds out the highest price, but it implies that a buyer discovers the best supplier and the supplier discovers the best customers. Supply chain integration not only provides a better perspective for buyers and suppliers, but it also increases the processing transparency for them.

16

Brunn et al. (2002) presented an e-marketplace framework ­ Temple Framework, which has three parts: The Objective, The Challenge, and The Setup. The Setup is the foundation for an e-marketplace's success, and it has five elements: focus (to determine who will participate and what products should be included), governance (to decide who will manage the e-marketplace, and determine the bias or neutral strategy), functionality, technology, and partnerships. The Objective is to succeed as an e-marketplace, and The Challenge is to reach the objective which includes building liquidity and capturing value. From the buyer, seller, and information system manager's views, Yuen (2010) presented some points to construct an e-marketplace framework in supply chain management. Poundarikapuram and Veeramani (2004) developed a distributed

decision-making model by using an integer L-shaped method to solve supply chain and private e-marketplace problems. Compared with the clumsy (due to computational complexity), centralized decision-making model, this model reduced the problem size by letting each player solve its own sub-problem with local information. They also developed some iterative algorithms to solve these problems, and results showed that this model is more efficient and feasible than the centralized model. Fang and Wang (2005, 2006) designed an online combinatorial auction system. Comparing with single item auctions, this system allows auction of a combination of desired items. Grey et al. (2005) analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of e-marketplaces and traditional relationship-based contracting methods in B2B transactions. Benefits for supply chain partners from relationship-based contracts include decreasing transaction and agency costs, improving information sharing for production coordination, customized pricing, and price stickiness. The potential profits for e-marketplace participants include improving resource allocation efficiency, enhancing both information collection and aggregation level, and improving risk management ability. They proposed some methods that drive a relationship-based supply chain to conduct B2B transactions, such as developing market liquidity, retaining the value associated
17

with long-term supply chain relationships, and creating a win-win environment for participants. Overby and Jap (2009) observed two channels (e-marketplace and physical) in the used vehicle industry for two and half years. They found that buyers have to face a trade-off between low transaction cost and uncertain quality. They further found that vehicles with low uncertainty related to their quality rarely appeared in the e-marketplace. Conversely, vehicles with high uncertainty related to their quality often appeared in the e-marketplace.

2.7 Supply Chain Risk Management 
After summarizing supply risk descriptions given by other researchers, Zsidisin (2003) presented a definition: "Supply risk is defined as the probability of an incident associated with inbound supply from individual supplier failures or the supply market occurring, in which its outcomes result in the inability of the purchasing firm to meet customer demand or cause threats to customer life and safety." (p.222) Uncertainty in demand and supply is a risk for a supply chain. Jüttner et al. (2003) classified the sources of supply chain risk into three categories: environmental risk sources, network-related risk sources, and organizational risk sources. Environmental risk sources are accidental events that come from external events, such as fire, terrorist attack, hurricane, and earthquake. Network-related risk sources include lack of ownership, chaos and inertia. Organizational risk sources are events that happen within supply chain partnerships such as machine failure, labor strike, and system failure. Jüttner et al. (2003) pointed out some factors that increase the risk level: a focus on efficiency more than effectiveness; supply chain globalization; focused manufacturing and centralized distribution; outsourcing trend; and reduction in the

18

supplier base. Following the standpoint of Miller (1992), they gave some strategies to mitigate supply chain risk: avoidance, control, co-operation, and flexibility. Christopher and Lee (2004) pointed out that visibility and control are two main methods to reduce supply chain risk, in which information sharing among supply chain members is the key to increasing visibility. They further gave some approaches to mitigate supply chain risks: increasing information accuracy, visibility and accessibility; informing business partners when breaking control conditions occur; and providing corrective action. Grey et al. (2005) also presented some methodologies to manage supply chain risks, such as using spot markets or dynamic pricing and revenue management to manage demand risk, and using spot and derivative markets to manage price risk. Giunipero and Eltantawy (2004) pointed out four factors that affect the level of investment in supply chain risk management: product technology level, requirement for security level, the degree of supplier's importance, and buyers' prior experience level. They presented four theories: (1) high technology markets need to pay more attention to risk management than low technology markets; (2) suppliers whose items require high security need to pay more attention to risk management than those whose items that require low security; (3) suppliers that provide large volume, value and/or critical goods need to pay more attention to risk management than those that provide a small number of and/or less important items; (4) less experienced suppliers need to pay more attention to risk management than experienced suppliers. Harland et al. (2003) surveyed risks in supply networks, and further presented a supply network risk tool for helping to identify, evaluate and manage risk in a supply network. The tool included six actions: map supply network, identify risk and its current location, assess risk, manage risk, form collaborative supply network risk strategy, and implement supply network risk strategy. By using this tool iteratively in four cases, they showed that the visibility of risk has increased. Chen and Yano (2010) studied a manufacturer-retailer supply chain for a seasonal product with weather sensitive demand. They presented a weather rebate
19

contract model. The model can achieve supply chain coordination and can provide Pareto improvement without increasing wholesale price, and it does not need inventory or markdown audit. The model is not only easy to implement, but is also very flexible. It allows broad functional forms and parameter values.

2.8 Automated Communication and Negotiation 
Communication and negotiation are indispensable in a supply chain, and they happen everywhere. For example, when a business buys or sells products, it has to inquire or negotiate with its trade partners about the price and delivery time. When a customer receives a defective product or the product is not as anticipated, the customer has to negotiate with its supplier about the method (e.g., return, exchange, or repair) for fixing the problem and the required processing time. Traditional communication and negotiation are conducted face-to-face, or by telephone, fax, or mail. The development of Internet technologies provides us with a digital channel ­ electronic negotiation (e-Negotiation), in which negotiation relies on electronic media to transmit information (Kersten, 2003). Media include e-mail, forum, blackboard, chat-room, and software agents. Recently, e-Negotiation research has mainly focused on automated negotiation or agent-based negotiation, in which negotiation is conducted automatically by a computer software system (agent). Jennings et al. (2001) described an outline and a generic framework of automated negotiations, including negotiation protocols, negotiation objectives, and agents' decision models. They also discussed how to design a particular negotiation strategy, based on game theory which maximizes the agent's own profit. Yuan and

Turel (2004) summarized existing e-Negotiation services, which included process support, decision support, contract management, and training. In addition, they presented an e-Negotiation business service model, which had the following components: market demand, service type, customer value, cost structure, revenue

20

source, issues of using services, and sustainability. Bichler et al. (2003) discussed negotiation media and systems (tools, agents and platforms) from the viewpoint of computer science and information systems, and negotiation procedures and models (strategies, tactics and techniques) from the standpoint of economics, management, law, and social sciences. They also presented some characteristics of auctions and negotiations and their interrelation. Fang and Wong (2010) presented a hybrid case-based reasoning automatic negotiation model. Unlike many other agent-based negotiation models, in which negotiation process was limited to the stage when agents interact to exchange bargaining offers, their model is applied to the phases of pre-negotiation and post-negotiation. For a new negotiation problem, the model will search for a similar previous negotiation case then adjust the negotiation parameters to get a possible conclusion. The user may also adjust those parameters to meet the conditions. If the conclusion is desired, it will be added to the negotiation case library for future usage.

2.9 MultiObjective Decision Making 
In a supply chain, decision makers often confront situations, in which they have to choose one solution from a number of possible solutions (Hines, 2004). For example, consider a situation where a company needs to purchase a type of component. Many sellers produce this type of component, but they offer different prices, qualities, and delivery times, and have different reputations. The buying company wants a lower price, higher quality, and a lower probability of delivery delay or failure. The best solution may not be the one that offers the lowest price, depending on the trade-off among the buyer's objectives. In this example, the decision maker may also face a strategic dilemma: which method should be used ­ auction or long-term contract, because each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. When a company develops a new

21

product or upgrades a current product, it encounters issues of how to balance cost, quality and reputation. These situations involve multi-objective decision making. Methodologies have been developed to solve multi-objective decision problems. The most popular method is the multi-objective utility analysis approach, which transfers multiple objectives to one overall objective function (Kirkwood, 1997; Sabri and Beamon, 2000; Gupta and Sivakumar, 2005). In this method, any objective is represented by a utility function, and the overall objective function is the sum of these utility functions multiplied by their weights. Luo et al. (2001) proposed a fuzzy logic-based optimization model to solve multi-objective problems in a global and Internet-based manufacturing supply chain. Their model dealt with three types of problems on given e-business information networks and material flow networks: (1) choose proper material flow networks for a product's supply chain; (2) choose the best combination of partners for a supply chain; and (3) optimize material flow networks and e-business information networks simultaneously. Some variables in a supply chain cannot be evaluated by a crisp value. For example, information sharing or acquiring ability may be based on a linguistic statement of "unclear, little, normal, most, or complete", and reliability of a system is based on a statement of "excellent, good, fair, or poor". These variables are easily represented by fuzzy sets, and using fuzzy optimization models is a convenient method for solving these problems. Another example is a genetic algorithm presented by Joines et al. (2002) for optimizing a supply chain simulation model. First, the system generates a few solutions as initial population. Then the system ranks them according to their fitness (overall objective value). After generating some new population randomly from randomly selected parents, the system ranks the population again, and it eliminates the last solutions to keep the population size unchanged. Carrying out these steps a number of times (often many thousands of times), the optimal solution in the last sample population is selected as the final solution. Sasikumar and Noorul Haq (2010) analyzed reverse supply chain from the manufacturer's standpoint. There are three available models that a manufacturer may
22

rely on ­ self support, joint venture, and outsourcing. Each model has advantages and disadvantages. They developed a multi-criteria decision making model by using an analytic hierarchy process method. Through some case studies, they pointed out that in most of cases, outsourcing is the best choice.

2.10 Multiagent Technologies in Supply Chain Management 
An agent is a software system which can decide automatically what it needs to do in order to satisfy its design objectives (Wooldridge, 2000; Macal and North, 2002, 2005; Hamichi et al., 2010). It has the following characteristics: autonomy, social ability, reactivity, temporal continuity, adaptability, mobility, and collaboration (Bradshaw, 1997; Ferber, 1999; Flores-Mendez, 1999; ASAP, 2000; Wooldridge, 2000). Therefore, a multi-agent system is very suitable to describe decentralized, distributed environments, especially for a supply chain. Some applications of multi-agent systems in supply chain management can be found in the literature. Nissen (2001) presented an agent-based supply chain integration model in which a user agent is used to conduct procurement activities, a supply agent to represent a seller's activities, and a contract agent to carry out transaction activities. Business processing integration was stressed by Nissen (2001). Frey et al. (2003) presented a multi-agent system to integrate planning, scheduling, tracking and tracing activities among partners in a supply chain. Sadeh et al. (2003) developed an agent-based decision support environment for supply chain partners called MASCOT to help them to make heterogeneous planning, scheduling and sourcing decisions. Bodendorf and

Zimmermann (2005) built up a multi-agent system called PAMAS to identify and correct disruptions and malfunctions in operational supply-chain processes. Cloutier et al. (2001) presented a multi-agent system framework to simulate network organizations and production operations for a real manufacturing supply chain. The system focuses on

23

coordination based on contracts and conventions. Most of these multi-agent systems concentrate on supply chain planning and scheduling through partners' coordination. By using genetic algorithm (GA), Kazemi et al. (2009) solved the production-distribution planning problem to support global optimization. But based on different crossover strategies, the model may get different solutions. To treat each genetic algorithm as an agent, they developed a multi- agent system to find the optimal one from those solutions. The result shows that the multi-agent technology works well for finding the optimal solution.

2.11 Other Topics in Supply Chain Management 
Beyond the above research directions, there are some other topics, such as supply chain network design (Amiri, 2006; Klibi et al., 2010; Nagurney, 2010; Georgiadis et al., 2011; Pishvaee et al., 2011), reverse-logistics also called reverse supply chain (Lieckens and Vandaele, 2007; Min and Ko, 2008; Pishvaee et al., 2010; Sasikumar and Noorul Haq, 2010), supply chain coordination (Hill and Scudder, 2010; Jaber et al., 2010; Krishnan and Winter, 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Bhatnagar et al., 2011), radio frequency identification (RFID) (Kim et al., 2010; Sarac et al., 2010; Sari, 2010), and resource allocation (Melo et al., 2009; Mafakheri et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). Research on those topics is also very important and useful for improving a company's overall performance. Those issues are not covered in this research.

In this dissertation, many supply chain management methodologies will be considered in designing and developing an intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation system. These methodologies include supply chain integration, supply chain coordination, supply chain network design, multi-objective decision making, multi-agent technique, automated communication and negotiation, demand forecasting, and inventory management. The system not only can be utilized to simulate and study

24

various supply chain management strategies and behaviors and to examine supply chain performance from an individual supply chain entity's perspective, but also can be used to examine supply chain performance for the perspective of an entire supply chain, or portion of it.

Chapter 3 Design of a Supply Chain Focused Enterprise Architecture
An enterprise, which is a business organization, includes employees, facilities, assets and business processing activities in order to produce certain products and/or to provide service to customers. Because the main objective of a for-profit enterprise is to make profits through business processing activities, analyzing and evaluating the performance of an enterprise is an important task. This is a complicated task, because many elements affect the performance of an enterprise, such as: employees' ability and loyalty, managers' skills and ability, business processing efficiency, quality of products and/or services, customers' preferences, and the external economic environment. To analyze an enterprise, researchers often utilize enterprise architectures. Enterprise architecture is a framework detailing an enterprise's organizational structure, business processes, assets, and management activities (Minoli, 2008). The main objective of building an enterprise architecture is to better understand an enterprise's structure, business processes, and business activities and strategies, in order to identify opportunities to improve the performance and competitiveness of the enterprise.

3.1 Background of Enterprise Architecture 
Since enterprise architecture is the main approach to analyze/reengineer an existing enterprise, or to design and build a new enterprise, a variety of enterprise architectures have been presented. Zachman Enterprise Architecture, a commonly used framework, utilizes a two-dimension grid to represent an enterprise (Zachman,1987, 2009; Minoli, 2008): one dimension applies What, How, Where, Who, When, and Why ("6Ws") to demonstrate enterprise scenarios, and the other dimension captures all critical models through six views ­ scope, business, system, technology, component, and operations.
26

From the "6Ws" dimension, What denotes the entities and data in each point of view; How represents the functions and processes from each point of view; Where furnishes the locations and network relationships within the enterprise; Who shows people and the organization structure of the enterprise in each view; When gives the time that an event or activity would happen; and Why describes the reason or motivation of an enterprise's goal, plan, strategy and operation. From the six views, the scope view considers the strategy issues that relate to the nature and purpose of the enterprise, and it is the planner's view; the business view is the observation and expectation of the enterprise which come from the owner's standpoint; the system view is the perception of designers and architects for the enterprise model; the technology view is from a builder's viewpoint to depict the constraints of technology, languages, tools, and materials; the component view stands for a subcontractor's view point which only focuses on the individual module related to the subcontractor; and the operation view illustrates how the system works and operates. Another commonly used framework, the open group architecture framework (TOGAF), describes enterprise architecture from four aspects: Business Architecture, Application Architecture, Data Architecture, and Technical Architecture (The Open Group, 2007; Minoli, 2008). The Business Architecture thinks about the business strategy, organization, governance, and key business processes, which contribute to achieving the goals of the enterprise. The Application Architecture displays the expected individual application systems and the relationships among them. The Data Architecture demonstrates the organization structure of enterprise data storage either in logical view or in physical view, and how to access the data. The Technology Architecture illustrates the necessary software and hardware to implement the applications. To help create and develop enterprise architecture, TOGAF presents an architecture development method (ADM), which is its most important contribution. While Zachman Enterprise Architecture Framework is suitable for building an enterprise architecture concept, TOGAF ADM can be used to develop and create enterprise architecture.

The field of computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) is a pioneer in enterprise processing integration, which uses computer technologies to integrate manufacturing processes (Brandimarte, and Cantamessa, 1995; Doumeingts et al., 1995; Johnson et al., 2007). Open system architecture for CIM (CIMOSA), a process-based enterprise architecture for controlling and monitoring enterprise operations based on CIM technology, is comprised of an enterprise modeling framework and integrating infrastructure (Kosanke, 1995; Zelm et al., 1995; Bernus, 2001; Chen et al., 2008). There are two steps to building a CIMOSA enterprise modeling framework: a partial modeling module and a generic modeling module. While a partial modeling process constructs business requirements and conducts design and implementation of a particular enterprise operation model (called CIMOSA business modeling process), generic modeling integrates all partial models into one by means of the concept of building blocks through the CIMOSA integrating infrastructure. All models are demonstrated through at least four different modeling views ­ Function, Information, Resource, and Organization. Based on CIM, some enhanced enterprise architectures have been designed, such as the generic enterprise reference architecture and methodology (GERAM) (Bernus and Nemes, 1996; Bernus, 2001), reference model of open distributed processing (RM-ODP) (Naumenko and Wegmann, 2007; Wegmann et al., 2007), and Purdue enterprise reference architecture (PERA) (Williams, 1994). The issue of supply chain integration has also been considered in enterprise architecture by some researchers. Davenport and Brooks (2004) discussed supply chain related issues of enterprise systems, including information integration, cost reduction, customer service, processing efficiency, and infrastructural and strategic capabilities. Based on a generic supply chain from the textile industry, Chandra and Kumar (2001) proposed a cooperative supply chain (CSC) system and discussed the issues of structure, analysis, control, and optimization of such a system. Most of those frameworks and models mentioned above focus on the business organization, business functions, and information technology issues. They have been
28

used to carry out business analysis and to improve the performance of enterprises. However, they rarely consider managerial knowledge acquisition and application which is an important factor for the development of an enterprise. In the next section, a supply chain simulation focused enterprise architecture is presented.

3.2 Conceptual Model of an Enterprise 
An enterprise may be a manufacturer, a trader, a service provider, or a large company which has many business units. Its role to other enterprises or individuals may be as: supplier, consumer, competitor and/or partner. To build an enterprise, an entrepreneur must consider the following factors: customers, market, industry, opportunities, competitors, regulators, and investors (Minoli, 2008). Establishing and managing an enterprise requires consideration of the external environment and relationships, and the internal organizational structures and business processes. All business entities and activities as well as external environmental issues can be classified into two categories: hard components and soft components. A hard component is an entity that can be seen and measured, such as organizational structure and employees, workshops, equipment and facilities, products and materials, cash flow, investments, and computer and application software. A soft component is about skill, ability, or environment, which is difficult to measure and include: managerial skills and competency, enterprise culture, enterprise technical advantages, external environment, supply chain management ability, and business processing capability. Enterprise culture is made up of beliefs and values held by an enterprise. All employees should work under the influence of their enterprise's culture. Figure 3.1 shows a conceptual model of an enterprise.

Figure 3.1 Conceptual model of an enterprise Through activities such as hiring new employees, purchasing new facilities or service, the components that belong to the Internal and Hard factors quadrant in Figure 3.1 can be directly improved or altered. Through initiatives such as training, learning, adjusting and modifying business strategies, processing technologies, and employees' managerial and professional knowledge, the components located in the Internal and Soft factors quadrant can be improved and strengthened. The enterprise could influence the components in the External and Soft factors quadrant through cultivating, advertisement and promotion. However, the components in the External and Hard factors quadrant are difficult for enterprise to influence. By examining the characteristics of each component, owners and managers can recognize effective and efficient methods and strategies to consolidate and expand the enterprise. Furthermore, the components in Figure 3.1 can be categorized into four segments according to functionalities (Business Processing Activities; Organization Structure; Workplace and Properties; and Strategy and Technology) through four different views (business processing, organization, facilities, and management) as shown in Figure 3.2.

30

This structure is defined as the organizational model of an enterprise, which is the foundation of forming the proposed new enterprise architecture as shown in Figure 3.3.

3.3 Proposed Enterprise Architecture Model 
As shown in Figure 3.3, the Organization Structure in the proposed architecture is comprised of the entrepreneur and all employees. Workplace and Properties may include factories, workshops, offices, warehouses, production and processing facilities, tools, transportation vehicles, computers and networks, computer operation systems and office software systems, business processing application systems, products, semi-finished products, components, materials, and current assets. Business Processing Activities may include production, sales, purchasing, warehousing, distribution, shipping, employee training, human resources functions, customer relationship management (CRM), supplier relationship management (SRM), product design, product advertising and
31

promotion, business analysis and intelligence, and business planning and scheduling. Business Strategy and Technology covers business management and processing policies and methodologies, which deal with business development, business management, employee training mechanisms, forecasting techniques, marketing strategies,

information integration techniques, CRM and SRM strategies, business analysis and intelligence techniques, purchasing and sourcing strategies, and inventory control policies.

Each employee has to create or add value or profit for the enterprise, and profit can be increased through employee training or using better facilities or techniques. As the workplace and properties are the medium for generating value, suitable locations as well as appropriate and high quality facilities would generate more profit. Similarly, since business processing activities are the main activities and concrete operations to create value or increase profit, effective processing procedures and technologies will increase value significantly. Moreover, management skills and technologies are the foundation of enterprise development and survivability, and they will enhance an enterprise's competitiveness through actions, such as: · Making the organization, facilities and business processing activities more efficient and effective, · · Enhancing staff quality and enterprise culture, and Strengthening cohesiveness of the enterprise.

Management ability depends on knowledge, which comes from experience, education, training and learning, and business intelligence analysis. Enterprise culture influences almost all aspects of the enterprise. The proposed enterprise architecture can be utilized to develop a new enterprise, and reengineer or analyze an existing enterprise. Through analyzing each element of the enterprise, the entrepreneur and managers can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the enterprise. The proposed model emphasizes the application of managerial knowledge and experience, which is an important factor in business operation. Based on this architecture, an intelligent supply chain simulation system to analyze and simulate management strategies and business processing activities has been designed and developed (Wang and Fang, 2007). This will be detailed in the next Chapter. The system can be used for managers to test and evaluate decision strategies for improving business processing activities.

Chapter 4 Design of an Intelligent Agent-based Supply Chain Simulation Model
Each business in a supply chain has its own characteristics and processing strategies. Both Dell and IBM are computer manufacturing giants, with different marketing strategies (Simchi-Levi et al., 2004). As a traditional business, IBM has adopted the following processing sequence: designing products, purchasing components, manufacturing products, distributing to warehouses, selling and shipping to retailers, and selling to final customers. In contrast, Dell's processing sequence is as follows: designing products, selling customized products through its website, confirming orders, manufacturing products, and shipping products to customers through third-party logistics (3PL). By providing ordering information to its suppliers and distributors, Dell makes its' supply chain more efficient. To better understand an entity's position and roles in a product supply chain, Tien (2011) pointed out that a supply chain network actually is a value chain, and it is comprised of two chains ­ supply chain and demand chain. The chains' structures are varied, depending on the Customer Order Penetration Point (COPP). The COPP is the point where customer orders are received in a value chain. This classification is very helpful for studying manufacturing and service customization. Since the supply chain is a dynamic, stochastic, and complex network, researchers have utilized simulation techniques to study new methodologies in supply chain management. Beer Game and TAC-SCM (trading agent competition for supply chain management) are two widely known supply chain simulation models. Beer Game (Sterman, 1989; Chen and Samroengraja, 2000; David, 2002) is a four-layer simulation system: a factory, a distribution centre, a warehouse, and a retail store. Materials flow in a forward direction (from the factory to the distribution center, to the warehouse, and to the retail store), while information, in the form of replenishment orders, flows in the
34

reverse direction. This system has been utilized to study partners' relationships, forecasting techniques, lead times, capacities, inventories and planning problems. TAC-SCM is an agent-based simulation system, in which there are six personal computer assembly agents who compete for customer orders and purchase various computer components from eight suppliers (Arunachalam et al., 2003, 2004; Arunachalam and Sadeh, 2005). Agents design strategies to determine: (1) which request-for-quotations (RFQs) will be responded to and with what price; (2) which combinations of supplier offers should be accepted; (3) how to plan production; and (4) which finished computers should be shipped to which customers. In this chapter, after illustrating the supply chain problem, an intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation model will be designed. Technologies and methodologies to make a supply chain more efficient, such as pricing methodology in negotiation, supply and demand forecasting methodologies, knowledge-based decision support techniques, automated communication and negotiation, and information sharing, could be studied and adopted in future research (Fang and Wang, 2007).

4.1 Model Description 
As shown in Figure 4.1(a), a supply chain includes many enterprises or businesses, including raw material providers, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, warehouses, retailers, and final consumers. Each business or enterprise has to be an individual entity in one or more supply chains. It can act either as a buyer or as a seller, or both. For example, raw material providers are sellers, final consumers are buyers, and the others (vendors, factories, etc.) are buyers as well as sellers. Every entity not only strives for maximum revenue, but also seeks steady and continuous development. In a traditional supply chain, as shown in Figure 4.1(b), the communication between supply chain partners relies on telephone, fax, mail, face-to-face communication, EDI, email,
35

etc. A supply chain participant usually connects only to its first tier suppliers and buyers. Connections to second tier suppliers (the suppliers' suppliers) or buyers (the buyers' buyers) are difficult, to say nothing of connecting to participants at further tiers in the supply chain.

In the new supply chain model proposed in this research, as shown in Figure 4.1(c), the main communication media are the Internet and businesses' websites; traditional communication methods may also be used. Based on this model, each enterprise is represented by an agent, and each company can communicate with any other company, regardless of how far removed in the supply chain. The most important activity for a company is to buy supply goods and to sell products. As a product provider, a company may have many methods for selling its' goods including: auction, request-for-quotation (RFQ) plus negotiation, long-term contract, and fixed price plus promotion. A buyer in a supply chain has options for buying its required goods such as: reversed auction, RFQ plus negotiation, long-term contract, and direct purchase from the market. The first thing buyers/sellers must do is to seek sellers/buyers. Although they may have some trade partners' information stored in their database, they would still like to approach more potential partners. They may pay for advertisements to acquaint consumers with the products they supply as well as with the buying or/and selling methods they utilize. Alternatively, they may search for buyers/sellers on the Internet, and send RFQ messages to them or invite them to participate in a scheduled auction. The company may also send the same message to trade partners stored in its database. If the auction method is adopted, the winner is the one who places the best bid based on price. If the RFQ approach is utilized a few buyers/sellers may be selected as candidates based on their credit/reputation and on feedback from other buyers/sellers. Negotiation with each buyer/seller would determine who receives the contract. The company always faces the risk that the contractor may not fulfill the contract for some reason. Advertisement and promotion strategy is very important when the fixed price method of selling is used. To determine which method(s) should be employed, companies utilize the current and forecast information on supply and demand. A company often uses some or all of these sale/procurement methods simultaneously in order to allow the business to grow steadily and continuously while also maintaining competency. Businesses in a
37

supply chain will pursue their own maximum profit with as robust development as possible. In order to make the supply chain more effective, a business may disclose some confidential information to its trade partners.

4.2  The  Intelligent  Agentbased  Supply  Chain  Simulation  Model 
In this section, an intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation model is designed. Each enterprise or supply chain entity is represented by an agent, and there are six layers in this model: raw material provider, component manufacturer, product assembly, product holder, retailer, and customer. The simulation system model is shown in Figure 4.2. There are N1 raw material agents, N2 component agents, N3 assembly agents, N4 product holder agents, N5 retailer agents, and N6 customer agents. Raw material agents provide materials; component agents manufacture semi-finished products; assembly agents assemble products; product holder agents design products and sell them to retailer agents; and retailer agents purchase products from product holders and sell them to customer agents.

network model with three layers is shown in Figure 4.3. In this model, the central layer is called the host layer, and its agents are labeled host agents. The front layer is called the input layer, and its agents are labeled input agents. The back layer is labeled the output layer, and its agents are called output agents. Input agents provide materials, components, or products to host agents. Host agents produce or stock products, and sell them to output agents. A host agent could be a raw material provider, a component manufacturer, an assembler, a product holder, a retailer, or a customer. If the host agent is a raw material provider, the model shown in Figure 4.3 is shrunk to two layers ­ only the host layer and output layer exist, and there is no input layer. A similar situation occurs when host agents are customers ­the input agents would be retailers or product holders and no output agent layer would exist.

If host agents are product holders, the input agents may be assemblers, component manufacturers, or material providers, and the output agents may be retailers, or final customers. In general, host agents buy products from input agents, process them, and sell them to output agents. The host agent can automatically communicate and

39

...
Output Agent P

negotiate with its input and output agents. In addition, every agent will have a rule-based knowledge base. Each agent will have the ability to forecast demand, make decisions using multiple objectives and determine production planning. In this model, output agents will generate orders according to certain policies, and input agents will supply goods in terms of the appointed schedules. The host agent can choose either the make-to-order (MTO) or make-to-stock (MTS) strategy. When the make-to-order strategy is utilized, the simulation starts at the output agent's side and proceeds in the following sequence: (a) An output agent generates an order according to a specific policy and it sends an RFQ message to each of the host agents; (b) Each of the host agents sends an RFQ message of its own, which is different from the output agent's RFQ, to each of its input agents; (c) (d) (e) Each input agent can reply to the RFQ with a price and delivery time; The host agent generates a response to the output agent's RFQ; If necessary, the output agent negotiates with the host agents automatically; (f) The output agent determines which of the final responses from the host agents is the winner; (g) The winning host agent purchases materials or semi-finished products from the input agent(s); and (h) The winning host agent delivers the finished product(s) to the output agent. The host agent may have some inventory. If the host agent has sufficient inventory to meet a particular order, steps (b) (c), and (g) of the process are skipped. On the other hand, when the make-to-stock strategy is used, the simulation starts at the input agent's side, and proceeds according to the following sequence: (a) (b) The input agents prepare the supplies according to a certain schedule; Host agents purchase goods from the input agents;
40

(c) (d)

Host agents make products or stock goods; An output agent buys goods from host agents according to a specific policy. When demand arises, the output agent sends an RFQ message to each of the host agents;

(e) (f)

The host agents respond with an offer to the output agent; The output agent negotiates with the responding host agents automatically;

(g)

The output agent determines the winner from the final offers of host agents; and

(h)

The winning host agent delivers the products to the output agent.

When the inventory level of a host agent reaches its upper limit, the host agent stops production until its inventory is decreased to its lower limit. Production-related activities in an enterprise include purchasing of components and materials, developing the inventory strategy and manufacturing plan, marketing of products, communicating and negotiating with its partners for information exchange and RFQ messages, fulfilling and delivering orders, and managing supplier and customer relationships. Since an enterprise is represented by an agent, the agent's structure should contain most of these activities. The proposed agent structure is shown in Figure 4.4. All agents have the following common components: Interface, Task Distributor, Fulfillment Engine, Forecast Engine, Search Engine, Communication and Negotiation Engine, Sales/Procurement Engine, SRM/CRM (Supplier Relationship

Management/Customer Relationship Management) Engine, Decision Support Engine, Database, Algorithm Base, and Knowledge Base.

Figure 4.4 A typical agent structure

The Interface is used to send and receive messages to and from other agents, and to show the results to user(s). The function of the Task Distributor is to save and to assign jobs to relevant engines depending on the message it receives. When a message cannot be understood by the Task Distributor, it is delivered to the Communication and Negotiation Engine. By means of the Communication Protocol module, the Translator translates the incomprehensible message to a standard message that can be understood by the agent. If the message is an offer that needs to be negotiated, the agent will generate a new counter-offer to its partner, through the Negotiation module. If the message is not an offer, the agent will just generate a reply (confirming) message

42

depending on the task. This message will be forwarded to the Interface via the Task Distributor, and then sent to the appropriate agent. The Forecast Engine is used to forecast product demand. The Forecast Support module in the Decision Support Engine will determine which of the many available forecasting methods is most suitable. Forecasting is based on the historical data available in the Database. The Search Engine, which could be one of the commercial search engines such as Google or Yahoo, is used to find possible partners worldwide through the Internet. The businesses identified will be evaluated using the Business Credit Evaluation Support module in the Decision Support Engine. Businesses that pass the evaluation will be added to the Database to become potential partners. The Sales Engine conducts the product selling process. Many sales methods are available including: auction, negotiation, long-term contract, and fixed price, and the Sales Support module in the Decision Support Engine helps in identifying which method(s) should be adopted. The Procurement Engine deals with purchasing activities according to the method(s) identified using the Procurement Support module in the Decision Support Engine. In addition to the aforementioned support modules, the Decision Support Engine also has two other modules: the Cost Evaluation Support module and the Risk Evaluation Support module. The Cost Evaluation module estimates the cost and profit of an activity. The Risk Evaluation module calculates the probability that the contract cannot be fulfilled and the expected loss when if this was to occur. The Fulfillment Engine deals with the receiving and shipping of components and products as well as the payment process. The SRM/CRM Engine is in charge of collaboration with supply chain partners (suppliers and customers). The collaboration includes technical support and sharing of information including: product lists, sales promotions, and production plans. The Database stores all relevant data and information, including information generated by the agent. It can obtain information (data) from the ERP (enterprise resource planning) Database which stores data generated by an ERP

43

system, such as SAP, PeopleSoft/J.D. Orisoft, Microsoft Dynamics. The Knowledge Base contains rule-based and experiential knowledge and it can be updated by the Decision Support Engine. The Algorithm Base stores the algorithms used by the agent. Examples of algorithms are forecasting, business credit evaluation, and cost and risk evaluation algorithms.

4.3 Communication and Negotiation between Agents 
Communication is the key for a successful supply chain. Efficient and effective communication between partners brings clear comprehension, allowing them to make fast and effective decisions. Communication activities among agents are shown in Figures 4.5 and 4.6. The messages may come from external agents or users, or internal engines of this agent. External messages include RFQ, shipping, delivery confirmation, and negotiation feedback messages. Internal messages include outgoing RFQ and auction announcement messages (from the Sales/Procurement Engine), as well as outbound shipping, inbound receiving confirmation, and reminder messages (from the Fulfillment Engine). When a message from another agent arrives, the Interface transfers it to the Task Distributor. The message is saved into the Database, and is transferred to the Message Translator. If the message does not have the standard format, it is translated into the standard format automatically, using the Communication Protocol. If it cannot be translated automatically, it is sent to the Manual Translator in order for a human to translate it. The translated message is then saved into the Database, and sent to the Message Analyzer.

Shipping and delivery confirmation messages received from an external agent or user are not processed any further by the Message Analyzer. RFQ or negotiation feedback messages are sent from the Message Analyzer to the Negotiation Module. In response to an RFQ message, the Counter-offer Generator generates an offer, and sends it to the Task Distributor. The offer is saved in the Database, and sent out through the Interface. In response to a negotiation feedback message, the Offer Analyzer determines whether to accept this offer or to generate a counter-offer through the Counter-offer Generator. The resulting decision is sent to the Task Distributor, saved in the Database and sent out through the Interface. When a message from an engine of this agent arrives, the Task Distributor saves it to the Database and sends it to the website or intended agent through the Interface.
45

The user has the option to review outbound messages. If reviewing outbound messages is selected, all messages are reviewed through the Interface, and can be edited by the user using the Message Editor. Communication protocols and negotiation strategies are the key factors for successful automated communication and negotiations. A communication protocol is the set of rules and standards that communication participants must obey for interactive communication. Without a protocol, no communication and negotiation can be conducted by agents automatically since they cannot understand each other's messages. Negotiation strategies are the tactics established to generate an offer or a counter-offer. Some examples of negotiation strategies are time-dependent (Boulware, Linear, and Conceder), resource-dependent, or behavior-dependent tactics (Matos et al., 1998). In this model, automated communication and negotiation will be conducted by the following components: Communication Protocol, Message Translator, Manual Translator, Message Analyzer, Message Generator, and Negotiation Module as shown in Figure 4.6. The Communication Protocol is stored in the Algorithm Base which is shared with other engines. The Negotiation Module is shared with the

Sales/Procurement Engine, and consists of the following parts: Offer Analyzer, Strategy Pool, Strategy Selection Knowledge Base, Strategy Selector, and Counter-Offer Generator. The Strategy Pool and the Strategy Selection Knowledge Base are stored in the Knowledge Base, and the Strategy Selector is located in the Negotiation Support Module in the Decision Support Engine.

where, · · · Message_Start and Message_End are utilized to identify the message body; Message_ID is a unique identification code used to distinguish messages; Volume_ID in Message_Volume is a uniform identification code for a group of messages that are generated in negotiating a contract; · Serial_ID in Message_Number is the serial number of the massage in the group of messages associated with the same contract; · Business_ID in Message_From is the business identification to record where the message comes from; · · · Business_ID in Message_To is the business identification of the agent itself; Time in Message_Time records the sent time of the message; Message_Type, can be Negotiation, RFQ, Confirmation, Receipt, Shipping, or Others, and identifies the purpose of the message; · · · Products identifies the products to be sold or purchased and the quantity of each; Desired_Prices identifies the price the buyer or seller is asking for each product; Delivery_Time identifies the preferred delivery time for each product. All communication messages will be built using this structure. If a received message does not have this structure, for example, coming from an e-mail written by a human, the agent will translate it to the above format. It can be translated automatically using the Message Translator or by a human being ­ the Manual Translator. For a negotiation message, the Offer Analyzer will check the time constraint for delivery; calculate the profit profit1 from this offer, and the profit profit0 from the negotiation strategy as
50

defined by the Strategy Selector in the Negotiation Support Module or by the user. If time allows, and if profit1 is no less than profit0, the agent accepts the offer. Otherwise, the agent will terminate the negotiation, or generate a counter-offer according to the negotiation strategy it selects. The negotiation will end when one agent quits or accepts the last offer.

4.4 System Processing 
The simulation model can be operated in two modes: manual or automatic. Each business is represented by an agent. An agent may be implemented to consist of a website, an application program, a database, a knowledge base, and an algorithm base. The website is the interface to the agent, and is utilized to initialize and configure a simulation run, to execute a manual simulation, to check the progress and results of a simulation run by users, and to provide general information about the business to partners. The application program handles automatic simulations and provides suggestions during manual simulations. An agent's website has three types of web pages: simulation settings, inquires, and operations. Simulation setting web pages include a configuration web page, initialization web page, and knowledge base maintenance web page. Through the configuration page, a user determines the simulation method ­ manual or automatic, production policy ­ make-to-order or make-to-stock, purchasing and sales strategy, negotiation tactics, inventory plan, and so on. The initialization web page is utilized to set up parameters at the simulation starting point, such as inventory level, purchasing point, production capacity, etc. The knowledge base maintenance web page allows a user to add, delete, and edit knowledge rules which are utilized to provide operation suggestions to users. Inquiry web pages contain a product categories web page, business history web page, contact information web page, and registration web page. These pages can be accessed by all external businesses and users. Inquiry web pages also include a log-in

51

web page, and other operational information, such as inventory, production plan and sales plan web pages, which can only be accessed by an authorized partner. Operations web pages, which are used to conduct manual simulations, include a negotiation web page, sales web page, purchasing web page, forecast web page, fulfillment web page, communication web page, and so on. Before an automatic simulation starts, the user can set various strategies and policies using the configuration web page, and set initial operational parameters using the initialization web page. If no changes are made, the system will maintain the strategies and parameters used by the previous simulation. The process for automatic

simulation is shown in Figure 4.7(a). After clicking the "Start automatic simulation" button, the application picks up the configuration settings, and starts the preprocessing module. The preprocessing module generates a number of functional threads, including purchasing thread, sales thread, message thread, production thread, fulfillment thread, communication thread, negotiation thread, CRM/SRM thread, forecast thread, decision support thread, and task distributor thread. Each thread will charge its corresponding engine. The communication thread, negotiation thread, decision support thread, production thread, forecast thread, search thread, and CRM/SRM thread are suspended until other functional engines require them. Other threads will sleep, and wake up periodically to carry out their tasks.

The sales thread determines if it should sell its products and by what method based on the current situation. The sales process for initialization and periodical check is shown in Figure 4.8. If the system uses the Make-to-Stock approach, it will check the inventory level first. If the inventory level is low, the sales engine will send a message to the production engine (for a manufacturing agent) or the procurement engine (for a commercial agent) for replenishment. If sufficient inventory is available, the process is the same as for the Make-to-Order approach: determine the sales method using knowledge stored in the knowledge base. After obtaining the solution, the system will

53

set the sales thread to sleep for a certain period, and will implement the solution by sending an RFQ or auction message to its partners, or an offer message to its long-term contract partner(s).

The procurement process for initialization and periodical check is displayed in Figure 4.9. The system checks the inventory level first and if it is not sufficient, the system will determine the procurement method based on the knowledge available in the knowledge base. After the solution is determined, the system will set the purchasing thread to sleep for a certain period, and will execute the solution by sending an RFQ or auction message to its partners, or an order message to its long-term contract partner(s).

The message thread continuously checks for any new messages from other agents in the message queue, several second intervals. If there are messages waiting in the message queue, the system receives and saves them then delivers them to the message processing module. As shown in Figure 4.7(b), messages can be classified into six categories: RFQ, auction announcement, order, delivery, reminder, and negotiation. Internal messages are classified in the same way but are sent out directly through the internal communication engine. If a message is in the standard format, it will be delivered directly to the task distributor engine. If a message is not in the standard format, it will be translated using the message translator, saved and sent to the task distributor. Figure 4.7(c) displays the message processing module. If a message is an RFQ, the task distributor sends it to the sales engine or procurement engine where a proposed offer is generated. If a message is a proposed offer or count-offer, it will be

55

delivered to the negotiation engine. The negotiation engine determines if the offer should be accepted or rejected, or another offer should be generated. For a delivery or reminder message that needs a reply, the system will generate a response message. For an auction announcement message, the system will mark the date.

4.5 Advantages of the Simulation Model   
By using this model, many supply chain management techniques can be developed and tested, such as information sharing, forecasting, and decision making. Some of the agent's abilities are as follows: (1) Determine trading methods: trading methods include auction, RFQ (request-for-quotations), fixed price, and long-term contract. Based on the requirements of each transaction, the agent can select one or more trading methods. If the long-term contract method is not used, the agent may send a request-for-quotation (RFQ) message to each potential trade partner, or may invite them to participate in an appointed auction. (2) Forecast supply/demand requirements: some forecasting methods, including statistical and artificial intelligence methods, can be implemented. (3) Evaluate and negotiate offers with partners automatically: if an agent uses the auction method to sell or buy a product, the winner is determined by the auction mechanism. If an agent uses the RFQ method, multi-objective decision making techniques can be utilized to evaluate each offer. Automated negotiation can also be studied. (4) Determine what information should be shared with partners: designing a flexible database is an important task. Flexibility ensures authorized users are able to manage and access the agent's database easily while blocking unauthorized users' access to the data. The database can conceal or disclose specific data to desired partners as necessary.

Chapter 5 Design of a Mobile Phone Supply Chain Simulation System
Every mobile phone includes at least the following components: housing, printed circuit board assembly (PCBA), liquid crystal display (LCD), antenna, keypad, battery, speaker, operation system, application programs, instruction, packing box, etc. An entire mobile phone supply chain will involve many enterprises and customers, including raw material providers (plastic, silicon, metals, glass, etc.), electronic and other element manufacturers, component manufacturers or semi-product manufacturers, assembly factories, product design and development companies, software developers,

warehouses/distributors, mobile phone service providers, retailers, and final customers. A fictitious mobile phone supply chain will be used to partially demonstrate how the proposed agent-based simulation system works (Wang and Fang, 2008). To simplify the network without losing the generality, this mobile phone supply chain simulation system will include two raw material providers (Silicon and Metal), two component manufacturers (Housing and PCBA), two mobile phone assembly factories (London and Markham), two mobile phone design and sales companies (Mokia and Notorola), two retailer companies (Logers and Pell), and one customer. In the supply chain simulation system, each participant will be represented by an agent. The network of this mobile phone supply chain is shown in Figure 5.1.

5.1 Description of the Mobile Phone Simulation System 
In this simulation system, we have implemented some functional components of the agent structure presented in Figure 4.4, including: Interface, Task Distributor, Fulfillment Engine, Communication Engine, Sales/Procurement Engine, CRM Engine, Database, and Algorithm Base, as shown by the shade boxes in Figure 5.2. The system has six layers, in which, both the Silicon and Metal agents provide raw materials to the Housing agent and the PCBA agent. The Housing and PCBA agents provide components to both Mokia and Notorola mobile phones. Both the Logers and Pell agents sell Mokia and Notorola mobile phones. Both the London and Markham agents assemble Mokia and Notorola mobile phones. The Mokia agent designs and sells only Mokia mobile phones while the Notorola agent designs and sells only Notorola mobile phones. The Customer agent will buy mobile phones from both the Logers and Pell agents. All agents, except Customer agent, have a structure similar to the one shown in

For example, if the Metal agent sends a sale message to all other agents, only the Housing and PCBA agents will react and respond to it. Figure 5.3(a) shows possible communication relationships among agents, while Figure 5.3(b) displays typical relationships between the adjacent agents and the Mokia agent.

In this supply chain simulation system, the Customer agent will generate individual orders continuously on a daily basis. The number of orders generated in a day is determined using probability distributions. The Logers and Pell agents purchase or compete for the mobile phones from their supplier agents (Mokia and Notorola). The London and Markham agents compete for orders from Mokia and Notorola. The Housing and PCBA agents compete for orders from the London and Markham agents. They may also compete for raw materials when resources are scarce.

5.2 Assumptions and Strategies 
The system can simulate a number of years of the entire mobile phone supply chain system. At the beginning of a day, the customer agent randomly generates the total number of orders required for that day (based on certain distribution). The agent will then separate them into equal intervals within 12 hours. The mobile phone brand in each independent purchase is randomly chosen by the probability of the brand market share. When a certain brand of mobile phone reaches its stock baseline, as determined by its' Decision Support Engine, the retailer agent (Logers or Pell) should make an automatic order for this type of mobile phone. If a retailer agent has sold out of all mobile phones of a certain brand, the buyer may: (1) wait until the brand of mobile phone becomes available with this agent: without knowing how many days it will have to wait (30% probability). The orders are accumulated and sold immediately when the mobile phones become available; (2) buy another brand of mobile phone from this agent (40% probability); or (3) buy the same brand mobile phone from the other retailer agent ( 30% probability). If a retailer agent has sold out of both brands of mobile phones, its buyers may: (1) buy mobile phones from the other retailer agent (30% probability); or (2) wait until this type of mobile phone becomes available at this retailer agent (70% probability). Product agents (Mokia and Notorola) may utilize either Stock-to-Order (STO) which is equivalent to Make-to-Stock (MTS), or Order-to-Order (OTO) equivalent to
61

Make-to-Order (MTO) policy as determined by the user. The assembler agents (London and Markham), component agents (Housing and PCBA), and raw material agents (Metal and Silicon) may adopt either the Make-to-Stock (MTS) or Make-to-Order (MTO) production policies. The policy an agent adopts is determined by the user running the simulation.

5.3 System Processing 
The system process is shown in Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5. The customer agent buys a number of individual mobile phones from the retailer agents. There are two retailer agents ­ Logers and Pell who both sell Mokia and Notorola brand mobile phones. The retailer agents purchase mobile phones from product agents ­ Mokia and Notorola. Product agents order mobile phones from assembler agents who have purchased components and assembled the mobile phones. The two assembler agents ­ Markham and London, both produce Mokia and Notorola mobile phones. The Component agents ­ Housing and PCBA purchase raw materials (metal and silicon), manufacture the components, and sell the components to assembler agents. Raw material agents produce raw materials (Metal agent produces metal, and Silicon agent produces silicon), and sell them to component agents. Detailed processes of each agent are described in Section 6.2.

Figure 5.4 Unified Model Language (UML) Use Case of mobile phone simulation system Before the simulation starts, the user may initialize the environment by setting parameters including: the years to be simulated, average customer orders in a normal workday, company market shares, initial inventories and cash for each company, daily production capacities of each manufacturing company, stock or production strategies, etc. For every six months, the user may adjust each company's strategy.

Chapter 6 Development of a Mobile Phone Supply Chain Simulation System
To demonstrate the designed simulation system, and to test supply chain performance using certain strategies in a certain environment, the author has developed a fictitious mobile phone supply chain simulation system by using VB.NET, SQL-Server and MS-Access. The system has one customer agent, two retailer agents (Logers and Pell), two product holder agents (Mokia and Notorola), two assembler agents (London and Markham), two component agents (Housing and PCBA), and two raw material agents (Metal and Silicon).

6 .1 Initialization of the Simulation 
The simulation period is one year (52 weeks). Raw material agents (Silicon and Metal), component agents (Housing and PCBA), assembler agents (London and Markham) and product holder agents (Mokia and Notorola) work 50 weeks (5 days per week) a year (2 weeks are holiday, they do not work). Retailer agents (Logers and Pell) work 364 days a year (only do not work on the New Year day). Customer agent runs 364 days per year, divided into two seasons: normal season ­ from day 2 to day 351, and holiday (Christmas) season ­ day 352 to day 365. In the normal customer demand environment, during the normal season, the system will generate 50 to 150 orders each weekday, 100 to 300 orders each Saturday, and 100 to 200 orders each Sunday, in the uniform distribution (each order represents a purchase of one mobile phone). During the holiday season, from day 352 to day 360, the number of orders generated each day will follow the uniform distribution with the mean equal to 20 plus the previous day's mean. From day 361 to day 365, the number of orders generated each day will follow the uniform distribution with the mean equal to the previous day's mean minus 30. In a high customer demand environment, the orders generated each day will follow the same rule, but the mean, upper bound and lower bound will be doubled. Similarly, in a low
65

customer demand environment, the number of orders generated each day also follows the previous rule, but the mean, upper bound and lower bound are divided by two. The user may input the desired mean orders before the system is running. In this system, Mokia has 60% market share and Notorola has 40% market share. In the mobile phone service market, Logers accounts for 70% of all customers while Pell for 30%. For all agents, the saving interest rate is 1%, and the loan interest rate is 5%. All of these parameters, initial financial positions, production capacities, and other initial inventories are adjustable by the user before the simulation starts. The daily cost (all costs, such as payroll, rental, and advertisement costs, not including product cost) for each agent is: Logers - $2100; Pell - $900; Mokia - $1800; Notorola - $1200; Markham - $400; London - $400; Housing - $400; PCBA - $800; Metal - $200; Silicon - $200. For both the Logers and Pell agents, the selling price for each Mokia mobile phone is $180, and for each Notorola mobile phone it is $170. The selling price of mobile phones by the Mokia and Notorola agents to the retailers is not constant and depends on a retailer's order size as shown in Table 6.1. The purchase price by the Mokia and Notorola agents from the assembler agents, Markham and London, also depends on the order quantities as shown in Table 6.2. The normal assembly capacity for an assembler agent is 150 units per day, the maximum assembly capacity is 300 units per day, and the minimum assembly capacity is 75 units. All brands of mobile phone have the same productivity, but each agent can only assemble one brand of mobile phone per day. The component costs for the London and Markham agents are given in Table 6.3.

The normal production capacity for each raw material agent (Metal and Silicon) is 300 units, the maximum capacity is 600 units, and the minimum capacity is 150 units per day. The selling price of both raw materials is $5 per unit as shown in Table 6.4. Each of the component agents (Housing and PCBA) can produce 200 components per day for either Mokia or Notorola Brand at normal production capacity, 400 components at maximum production capacity, and 100 units at minimum capacity. A component agent can only produce one kind of component each day.

6.2 Processes of Agents  6.2.1 Customer Agent
A customer agent will randomly generate orders every day according to certain distribution. Here we use uniform distribution. If it is a weekday, the mean of the distribution is equal to the average orders as defined by the user. If the day is in the Christmas season (day 352 to 365), the mean of the uniform distribution will follow the triangle distribution (on day 360, the mean is equal to 200 plus normal weekday mean order). If the day is a Saturday between day 2 and day 351, the mean of the distribution is equal to 2 times the average orders. If the day is a Sunday between day 2 and day 351, the mean of the distribution is equal to 1.5 times the average orders. If the day is New Year's (day 1), all retailer agents will be closed, and the customer agent will not generate any orders. The customer demand distribution can be changed easily by using a different probability generating function. If a retailer agent has sold out of all mobile phones of a certain brand, the buyer has two options: (1) (2) Giving Up: give up the order; Accumulating: buy another brand of mobile phone from this agent (40% probability); buy the same brand mobile phone from the other retailer agent (30% probability); or, wait until the brand of mobile phone becomes available from this agent (not knowing how many days it will have to wait) (30% probability). The market share of retailers and product holders can be adjusted by the user at the beginning of the simulation. By default, Logers has 70% market share, Pell has 30%; Mokia has 60%, and Notorola has 40%. Processes and activities of Customer Agent are shown in Figure 6.1.

6.2.2 Retailer Agents
The process of a retailer agent is shown in Figure 6.2. There are two retailer agents ­ Logers and Pell. When a retailer agent receives a customer order, it will sell a phone to the customer if it is in stock. If the retailer is sold out, the customer agent may choose to hold the order until it is available, if the customer is willing to wait. When the inventory of a brand has reached its order point, the retailer agent will send a request-for-quotation (RFQ) to the product agent. An RFQ has the following information: (1) the RFQ identification number, (2) the brand of mobile phone, (3) the quantity desired, (4) the unit price, and (5) the delivery date. If the product agent can fulfill the RFQ, it will accept the RFQ, and transfer it to a contract. If it cannot satisfy the RFQ, it will be rejected and the retailer agent will send another RFQ the next working day.
69

Figure 6.2 Processes of a retailer agent

A retailer agent may adopt either the Same Order Amount or the In Proportion order policy for the order amount in an RFQ. The Same Order Amount Policy means that all RFQs of all retailer agents have the same order amount. In this system, the Same Order Amount Policy means that the order amount for a retailer is 400 units. The In Proportion policy means that the order amount in an RFQ is proportional to the market share. For example, the Logers share is 70% and the Pell share is 30% of total customer orders. Mokia has a 60% share of the market while Notorola has a 40% share. The average daily order for weekdays is 100. If an RFQ order is equal to two weeks sales, the amount for an RFQ is calculated as follows: total market needs for two weeks is 1700 (=(5×100 + 1.5×100 + 2×100)×2) (5 weekdays, 1 Saturday, and 1 Sunday). The amount in
70

Logers' RFQ for Mokia is 714 (1700×70%×60%) and for Notorola is 476 (1700×70% ×40%). The amount in Pell's RFQ for Mokia is 306 (1700×30%×60%) and for Notorola is 204 (1700×30%×40%).

6.2.3 Product Holder Agents
There are two product agents ­ Mokia and Notorola. The process of a product agent is shown in Figure 6.3. A product agent purchases mobile phones from assembler agents, and sells them to retailer agents. It may adopt different inventory strategies in response to a retailer agent's order ­ Stock-to-Order (STO) or Order-to-Order (OTO). The user has the opportunity to adjust the inventory strategy every six months. If the product agent adopts the STO strategy, sufficient inventory will be maintained to satisfy the retailer's RFQs. When inventory reaches its order point, the product agent will generate two identical request-for-quotation (RFQ1 and RFQ2) ­ one for the London agent and the other for the Markham agent. If both the assembler agents agree, the product agent will choose one and convert it to a contract. The assembler agent will be chosen randomly and with equal probability. If only one assembler agent confirms the RFQ, the product agent will convert it to a contract. If both assembler agents reject the RFQs, the product agent will generate new RFQs.

Figure 6.3 Processes of a product agent If the product agent adopts the OTO strategy, it will keep a small amount of inventory. When it receives an RFQ, it will mark the RFQ as status pending. It will then generate two identical request-for-quotation (RFQ1 and RFQ2) one for the London agent and the other for the Markham agent containing the same information as the received
72

RFQ. The product agent will confirm the retailer agents RFQ when at least one assembler agent confirms (RFQ1 or RFQ2). If both assembler agents confirm, the product agent will randomly with equal probability choose one and convert it to a contract and refuse the other. If only one assembler agent confirms the RFQ, the product agent will convert it to a contract. If both assembler agents reject the RFQs, the product agent will reject the retailer's RFQ and the retailer agent will have to generate a new RFQ for the product agent.

6.2.4 Assembler Agents
There are two assembler agents ­ London and Markham. The process of an assembler agent is shown in Figure 6.4. An assembler agent purchases components from component agents, produces (assembles) mobile phones according to the production schedule, and sells the mobile phones to product agents. Both assembler agents can produce two kinds of mobile phones ­ Mokia and Notorola. The production capacity of the assembler agents is initialized by the user at the beginning of simulation. An assembler agent may adopt MTO (make-to-order) or MTS (make-to-stock) production strategy and may change their production strategy every six months. The MTS strategy provides the best opportunity to obtain a product agent's order while the MTO strategy reduces inventory costs for the assembler agent. When the MTS strategy is adopted, the assembler agent tries to keep the inventory of mobile phones high to satisfy two agents' orders. When the inventory of a component reaches its order point, the assembler agent generates an RFQ to that component agent. The production schedule is based on product and component inventories. When the assembler agent receives an RFQ from a product agent, it will check its' product inventory first. If the inventory is not less than the order amount in the RFQ, the agent confirms the order. If the inventory is less than the RFQ, the agent will reject the RFQ.

Figure 6.4 Processes of an assembler agent

When an assembler agent adopts the MTO strategy, it keeps a low inventory of products and components. When an RFQ is received from a product agent, the assembler agent checks the fulfillment possibility from the production perspective. If it cannot satisfy the RFQ it will be rejected. If it can be fulfilled the assembler converts the RFQ to pending status and generates two new corresponding RFQs (RFQ1 and RFQ2) to component agents in order to purchase components. Both components are required. If at least one of the component agent rejects RFQ (RFQ1 and RFQ2), the assembler agent

74

will reject the original RFQ. If both component agents confirmed the RFQ1 and RFQ2, the assembler agent will confirm the original product agent's RFQ. When the product agent has selected an assembler agent as the supplier of the RFQ, the assembler agent will transfer the RFQ1 and RFQ2 to contracts, and begin to produce the products. If the assembler agent has accepted the RFQ, but the product agent cancels it (the product agent has selected another assembler agent as the supplier of RFQ), the assembler agent has to cancel its RFQ1 and RFQ2 with the components' agents.

6.2.5 Component Agents
There are two component agents ­ Housing and PCBA. The housing agent produces two kinds of housing components ­ Mokia housing and Notorola housing, and the PCBA agent manufactures two kinds of PCBA components ­ Mokia PCBA and Notorola PCBA. The process of a component agent is similar to the assembler agent (shown in Figure 6.4). A component agent purchases raw materials from material agents, produces the components according to the production scheduling, and sells the components to assembler agents. The production capacity of the component agents is fixed and can be initialized by the user at the beginning of the simulation. A component agent may adopt the MTS or MTO production strategy and may change its' production strategy every six months. When an agent adopts the MTS strategy, components are produced until the inventories reach their upper boundary. When the inventory of a material reaches its order point, it will generate an RFQ to the corresponding material agent. When the component agent receives an RFQ from an assembler agent, it will check the component inventory first. If the inventory is not less than the order amount in the RFQ, the agent will confirm the order. If the inventory is not sufficient, the agent will reject the RFQ. When the MTO strategy is adopted, components and materials inventories are kept low. When an RFQ is received from an assembler agent, it will check the possibility of fulfilling the order from the production perspective. If the RFQ cannot be satisfied, the
75

agent will reject the RFQ. If it can be fulfilled, it will mark the RFQ as pending status, and generate two new corresponding RFQs (RFQ1 and RFQ2) to material agents to purchase raw materials. If at least one material agent rejects RFQs (RFQ1 and RFQ2), the component agent will reject the original RFQ. When both material agents confirmed the RFQs (RFQ1 and RFQ2), the component agent will confirm the original RFQ. Once the assembler agent has transferred the RFQ to a contract, the component agent will transfer RFQ1 and RFQ2 to contracts, and begin to produce the components. If the component agent has accepted the RFQ, but the assembler agent cancels it (the product agent has selected another assembler agent as its supplier), the component agent has to cancel its RFQ1 and RFQ2 with the materials agents.

6.2.6 Raw Material Agents
There are two raw material agents ­ Metal and Silicon. The Metal agent only produces metal, while the silicon agent only produces silicon. The production capacity of both raw material agents can be initialized by the user at the beginning of the simulation. The process of a raw material agent is shown in Figure 6.5.

76

Figure 6.5 Processes of a raw material agent

A raw material agent may adopt the MTS or MTO production strategy and may change its production strategy every six months. When an agent adopts the MTS strategy, raw materials are produced until the inventory reaches its upper boundary. When the raw material agent receives an RFQ from a component agent, it will check the inventory first. If the inventory is not less than the order amount in the RFQ, the agent will confirm the order, and the component agent will transfer the RFQ to a new contract. If the inventory is not enough to fulfill the RFQ, the agent will reject the RFQ. When a raw material agent adopts the MTO strategy, material inventories are kept low. When an RFQ is received from a component agent, the raw material agent will confirm its ability to fulfill the order from the production perspective. If the RFQ cannot
77

be satisfied, the agent will reject the RFQ. Otherwise, it will confirm the RFQ. After the component agent transfers the RFQ to a contract, the material agent will start to produce the material. If the agent has confirmed the RFQ, but the component agent cancels it, the material agent will not produce the material.

6.3 Database of the System 
A database structure is a key factor in a complex simulation system. It should record all the information generated during the simulation. In this system, the author uses SQL Server ­ a relational database to store and process the simulation information. The database includes two parts ­ initialized data and generated data (simulation data). The database structure is shown in Figure 6.6. Initialized data is utilized to set up the simulation environment and the initial status of the system. There are four tables to store the information ­ Company, Common, Price, and Product. Detailed contents of each initialized table are shown in Figure 6.7.

Simulation data is the data generated during the simulation. It can be classified into two sub-categories ­ Company (Agent) data (see Figure 6.8) and Combination data (see Figure 6.9). A company table is used to record the daily sales, production, inventories, transaction(s), and financial balance of the company (agent). A combination table is utilized to record any requests, communication, production, and strategy changes.

6.4 Factors and Parameters in the System 
Since a supply chain is a network of companies, any environmental settings or changes in an agent or the market will influence all agents as well as the efficiency of the whole supply chain. When market demand by customers is high, every agent will realize more profit if the capacities of all agents are adequate. If market demand by customers is high, but the production capacity of a component agent is minimum, all agents may not increase profit as much as expected. If market demand by customers is low, any agent may see its profit decrease, and may even experience bankruptcy. Factors that may influence the performance of the supply chain as well as their possible values are listed in Table 6.5. The detailed interpretations about each parameter are given in Chapters 7 and 8.

This simulation system is a multi-agent system and all agents will start working at the same time. At the beginning, all agents except for the Customer agent have default inventories which may be changed by the user. Table 6.6 shows the default settings and

82

strategies for the system. These can be changed by the user at the beginning of the simulation.

Chapter 7 System Testing and Validation
7.1 Overview of Simulation Scenarios 
Section 6.4 demonstrated that there are many factors and parameters that will affect the supply chain performance. Figure 7.1 uses a multi-dimensional graph to illustrate how those factors and parameters are utilized in the simulation. Cube G in Figure 7.1 represents that in a Normal market environment, a material agent (Metal or Silicon) will adopt one production strategy (Make-to-Order, Make-to-Stock, or Change Strategy Iteratively). To simplify this simulation, fixed values are adopted for the parameters in Table 6.6. For example, for the market demand parameter, the value of the High market demand is exactly twice the Normal demand, while the value of the Low market demand is exactly half of Normal demand. To test all situations, thousands of different scenarios would have to be run. The total scenarios can be calculated as follows:

Figure 7.1 A comprehensive illustration of the simulation The structure in Figure 7.1 can be used to analyze the influence of each parameter on the performance of the whole supply chain. The plane(s) can be used to dissect the structure, as shown in Figure 7.2. Plane A can be used to analyze Market Environment; Plane B to analyze agents; and Plane C to analyze other parameters. In Figure 7.2, dissecting by Plane A shows how High market demand will affect the whole supply chain (each agent); dissecting by Plane B shows how the behavior of Markham or London agent will affect the whole supply chain (other agents); and dissecting by Plane C shows how an Order Amount Strategy (0 ­ In Proportion, or 1 ­ Same) parameter affects the whole supply chain. The Point D is the point where the three planes intersect and has special meaning: in a High market demand environment, how the Order Amount Strategy of Markham or London affects the whole supply chain. To analyze the whole supply chain performance influenced by Point D, all situations of other parameters' combinations have to be tested. According to permutations and combinations, the total

The number of scenarios for Point D is so huge, it is impossible to test all of them. Therefore only some representative scenarios are tested. Table 7.1 shows a few of the typical scenarios when Markham adopts the Same Order Amount Strategy in the High market demand environment. The detailed scenarios used in this dissertation are shown in Appendix A. This simulation system can be utilized in practice in a variety of ways, including: · As an analysis tool for an entity in a supply chain. From a particular supply chain entity's perspective, various management strategies and behaviors can be examined to test their impacts on the performance of a supply chain.

7.2 Extracting, Classifying and Summarizing Data for Analysis   
The database for this simulation system stores all of the information about settings, production, RFQs, communication, contracts, transactions, cash flow statements etc. As shown in Figure 6.6, the data can be classified into two categories ­ Initialized Data and Simulation Data. Initialized Data is used to set the environment including: simulation period, interest rate, market share of agents, market demand, product prices, inventories of agents, strategies and policies of agents, production capacities of agents, initial loans and cash of agents. This information is very important when analyzing the supply chain performance, as different environments will result in different performance. Simulation Data stores all of the processing data, which can be divided into two groups ­ independent data (for each agent) and communication and combination data. Independent data for any agent will record sales (contracts), inventories, production status, communication records (RFQ), cash balance, and so on. Communication and combination data will save every agent's daily communication, transaction and production information. This data is utilized to analyze an agent's behavior and the performance of the whole supply chain. To analyze the performance of the whole supply chain, each agent's revenue has to be calculated at the end of the simulation. The final asset value of the agent is used to replace its revenue and should include cash and the cash value of the inventory:
n( j )

Asset of agent j = Cash(j) +

 Inventory(i) × price(i)
i =1

(7.3)

where j is the agent to be evaluated; i is a product or component possessed by agent j; n(j) is the total number of products and/or components possessed by agent j; Inventory(i) is the inventory amount of product or component i held by agent j; and price(i) is the price of product or component i. To study an agent's performance, its RFQs, contracts, and production information must be extracted from the RFQ table, Contract table, and Production table. To see how
94

an RFQ became a contract, or why it was refused, all of this communications about that RFQ should be collected. Based on this observation, different strategies for that agent must be tested to determine how the performance of the whole supply chain and the agent changed. Ultimately, suitable strategies under certain environments for an agent can be determined. The asset results of all scenarios tested in this dissertation are shown in Appendix B, and the summary results are shown in Appendix C.

7.3 System Validation   
To test the system, some typical scenarios are simulated to ascertain whether the results are reasonable and the system operates reliably. Table 7.2 lists some typical tested scenarios with the simulation results shown in Table 7.3. Scenario 16 is a situation with the following parameters: market demand is Normal; all retailer, product holder, assembler and component agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and Conservative Order Point Strategy; all product holders adopt the Stock-to-Order Inventory Strategy; all assembler, component and material agents adopt the Make-to-Stock Production Policy and Normal Production Capacity Strategy. In addition, Logers has 70% market share and Pell has 30%, while Mokia has 60% market share and Notorola has 40%. Scenarios 17 and 18 are the same as Scenario 16, except that market demand is High and Low respectively. The results show that although market demand was High, the overall supply chain performance did not improve because the manufacturing agents could not provide sufficient supplies. This is compared with Scenarios 19 to 21 which are the same as Scenarios 16 to 18, except that all of the manufacturing agents adopted the Maximum Production Capacity Strategy. As a result, the whole supply chain performance improved significantly except when market demand was Low. The revenues of retailers and product holders were close to their market share (Scenario 17 is an exception which will be analyzed in Chapter 8).

95

Next, simulation results are examined when retailers have an equal market share. Scenarios 118, 119, 122 and 123 show the simulation results when retailers had an equal market share. Scenario 118 and 119 are similar to Scenarios 19 and 20, and Scenarios 122 and 123 are similar to Scenarios 16 and 17, except that Logers and Pell had the same market share (50%, 50%). The results show that the revenues of Logers and Pell were very similar, and the overall performance of the supply chain were similar to the scenarios with unequal market shares. Situations where the product holders had an equal market share resulted in the same conclusions. Scenarios 128, 129, 130 and 131 are similar to Scenarios 16 and 17, except that Mokia and Notorola have an equal market share (50%, 50%). The results show that the revenues of Mokia and Notorola were similar (Scenario 129 and 131 are exceptions which will be discussed in Chapter 8), and the overall performance of the supply chains were similar to scenarios with unequal market shares. The author further tests three situations with 10 runs each. The first group of 10 scenarios given as Scenarios 190 to 199 in Appendix A has exactly the same set of parameters settings: · · · market demand by customers is Normal; customer agent adopts the Accumulating policy; all retailer agents adopt the Same Order Amount and the Conservative Order Point Strategy; · all product holder agents adopt the In Proportion Order Amount, the Conservative Order Point, and the Order-to-Order policies; · Markham and all component agents adopt the Same Order Amount, the Conservative Order Point, Normal Production Capacity, and the Make-to-Stock policies; · London agent adopts the In Proportion Order Amount, the Conservative Order Point, the Make-to-Order, and Normal Production Capacity strategies;

96

·

all material agents adopt Normal production capacity, and the Make-to-Stock policies;

· ·

Logers has 70% market share, and Pell has 30%; Mokia has 60% market share, and Notorola has 40%.

The second group of 10 scenarios listed as Scenarios 201 to 210 in Appendix A has exactly the same situation, which is the same as in the first group except for Markham and London: · Markham agent adopts the In Proportion Order Amount, the Conservative Order Point, the Make-to-Order, and Normal Production Capacity strategies; · London agent adopt the Same Order Amount, the Conservative Order Point, Normal Production Capacity, and the Make-to-Stock policies; The third group of 10 scenarios given as Scenarios 212 to 221 in Appendix A has exactly the same situation as follows: · · · market demand by customers is Normal; customer agent adopts the Giving Up order policy; all retailer agents adopt the In Proportion Order Amount and the Conservative Order Point Strategy; · all product holder agents adopt the In Proportion Order Amount, the Conservative Order Point, and the Order-to-Order policies; · all assembler and component agents adopt the In Proportion Order Amount, the Conservative Order Point, the Make-to-Order, and Normal Production Capacity strategies; · all material agents adopt Normal production capacity, and the Make-to-Order policies; · · both Logers and Pell have 50% market share; both Mokia and Notorola have 50% market share.

97

Simulation results for those scenarios are given in Appendix B and Appendix C. It is shown that within a group, all runs have very similar simulation result. Based on those testing, the system functions as designed. The system can be used to simulate generic six-layer supply chain networks. A copy of the system developed can be obtained from Professor Liping Fang (lfang@ryerson.ca) upon request.

Chapter 8 Illustrative Applications of the Simulation System
The mobile phone simulation system has the ability to simulate many situations and agent behaviors. When the market environment or an agent situation changes, other agents should adjust their strategies and actions to keep them and the whole supply chain efficient. The author has examined a number of scenarios in the mobile phone supply chain environment. In this chapter, the performance of every agent in variety of situations will be examined, and the best strategies and actions for each agent will be discussed. All simulation results are based on a two year simulation period. Different initialization data may produce different results, especially for cash values of agents. After testing many different initialization environments, a set of fixed initialization data is adopted for all scenarios in this research. According to the simulation theory, we should use initialization data based on the system data after the system has run for a while and reached a steady state. Based on the following reasons, we choose a set of fixed initialization data for our simulation study: first, this set of initialization data is determined from many possible initialization conditions after numerous tests, and the data set brings reasonable results for all tested scenarios; second, we use a duration of two years as the simulation period which is long enough for the simulation study.

8.1 Scenarios of the System Simulation 
Based on the system parameters in the system shown in Table 6.5, there are a total of 32 factors that may affect the performance of the supply chain. Each type of agent has two individual agents except for the customer agent, and each factor has 2 to 3 choices. This would result in billions of scenarios if all the situations were to be tested. Therefore,
101

only some typical scenarios will be tested. Table 8.1 will be used to describe some scenarios in order to improve understanding of the whole environment and situations. All of the scenarios tested in this chapter are shown in Appendix A, and a summary of the testing results is shown in Appendix B. The following acronyms are used in the table: DC ­Demand by Customers CB ­ Customer Behavior when a product sold out OA ­ Order Amount Policy OP ­ Order Point Strategy SS ­ Inventory Strategy for product holder agents PS ­ Production Strategy for assembler and component agents PC ­ Production Capacity for manufacturing agents The meaning of the values used in Table 8.1 and Appendix A have been illustrated in Table 6.5 and they will also be described in detail in the analysis section for each agent. Scenario 1 represents the following situation: · · · market demand by customers is Normal; when a customer faces a sold out product, the order is given up; Logers and Pell adopt the In Proportion Order Amount Policy and the Conservative Order Point Strategy; · Mokia and Notorola adopt the In Proportion Order Amount Policy, Conservative Order Point Strategy, and Stock-to-Order Inventory Strategy; · Markham, London, Housing and PCBA adopt the In Proportion Order Amount Policy, Conservative Order Point Strategy, Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy, and production capacity is Normal; · Metal and Silicon adopt the Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy, and production capacity is Normal. · Logers has 70% market share while Pell has 30% market share;
102

·

Mokia has 60% market share and Notorola has 40% market share.

The environments and situations in Scenarios 2 and 3 are similar to Scenario 1, except that market demand in Scenario 2 is high while in Scenario 3 it is low. Scenario 19 denotes the following situation: · · · market demand by customers is Normal; when a customer faces a sold out product, the order is given up; Logers and Pell adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and the Conservative Order Point Strategy; · Mokia and Notorola adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, and the Stock-to-Order Inventory Strategy; · Markham, London, Housing and PCBA adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, the Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy, and production capacity is Normal; · Metal and Silicon adopt the Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy, and production capacity is Normal; · · Logers has 70% market share while Pell has 30%; Mokia has 60% market share and Notorola has 40%.

The environment and situation in Scenario 20 are similar with Scenario 19, except that market demand in Scenario 20 is high. Scenario 57 describes the following situation: · · · market demand by customers is Normal; when a customer faces a sold out product, the order is given up; Logers and Pell adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and the Conservative Order Point Strategy; · Mokia adopts the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, and the Stock-to-Order Inventory Strategy; · Notorola adopts the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, and the inventory strategy changing iteratively every six months with
103

the starting strategy determined by the system randomly. Each inventory strategy can be selected initially with a probability of 0.5; · Markham, London, Housing and PCBA adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, the Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy, and production capacity is Normal; · Metal and Silicon adopt the Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy, and production capacity is Normal; · · Logers has 70% market share while Pell has 30%; Mokia has 60% market share and Notorola has 40%.

Scenario 72 represents the following setting: · · · market demand by customers is high; when a customer faces a sold out product, the order is given up; Logers and Pell adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and the Conservative Order Point Strategy; · Mokia and Notorola adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, and the Stock-to-Order Inventory Strategy; · Markham adopts the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, inventory strategy changing iteratively, and production capacity is Normal; · London, House and PCBA adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, the Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy, and production capacity is Normal; · Metal and Silicon adopt the Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy, and production capacity is Normal; · · Logers has 70% market share while Pell has 30%; Mokia has 60% market share and Notorola has 40%.

The environment and situation in Scenario 73 is similar to Scenario 72, but in Scenario 73 the market demand by customers is Normal, Markham adopts the
104

Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy, and London adopts the changing inventory strategy iteratively.

8.2 Customer Agent Analysis 
Customers are the foundation of any supply chain. If no customer buys a particular product, the supply chain for that product could not exist. A factor influencing the supply chain is the customer's purchasing power and willingness, called Market Demand by Customers (DC). The possible values for DC are: 1- Normal; 2- High (two times Normal orders); and 3- Low (half Normal orders). Another factor is the action taken by a customer (CB), when a retailer has sold out of a product. There are three possible Customer actions: (1) Buy another brand of phone from the retailer agent; (2) Buy the same brand of phone from another retailer agent; (3) Wait until the phone is available from the original retailer agent; and In this simulation system, there will be two possible values: · · 0 ­ Giving Up: give up the order; 1 ­ Accumulating: buy another brand from the same retailer (40% probability), buy the same brand from another retailer (30% probability), or wait until the brand of mobile phone becomes available from this retailer (30% probability). High demand by customers is always a good thing for all agents in the supply chain, and low demand by customers is a disaster for all agents. Figure 8.1 shows how the agents' assets change when customer behavior and demand by customers change.

Figure 8.1 Final assets of agents versus customer behavior and demand by customers

In Group (a) (Scenarios 1 to 3) the customer gives up the order when the desired retailer has sold out of the desired brand of mobile phone. Retailer agents, product agents, assembler agents, and material agents adopt the In Proportion Order Amount and the Conservative Order Point policies. Product agents adopt the Stock-to-Order policy, and all manufacturing agents adopt the Make-to-Stock strategy and have Normal production capacities. Group (b) (Scenarios 13 to 15) is similar to Group (a), except that the customer agent adopts the Accumulating customer order strategy. In Group (c) (Scenarios 19 to 21) the customer agent adopts the Giving Up policy when the product has been sold out; all retailer agents adopt the Same Order Amount
108

Policy, and the Conservative Order Point Strategy. All product agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, and the Stock-to-Order inventory policies. All assembler and component agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, the Make-to-Order inventory policy, and the Maximum production capacity strategy. All material agents adopt the Make-to-Order inventory policy, and the Maximum production capacity strategy. In Group (d) (Scenarios 22 to 24) the customer agent adopts the Accumulating customer order strategy when the product has been sold out. All retailer agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, and the Positive Order Point Strategy. Product agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, and the Stock-to-Order inventory policies. All assembler and component agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, the Conservative Order Point Strategy, the Make-to-Order inventory policy, and the Normal production capacity strategy. All material agents adopt the Make-to-Order inventory policy, and the Normal production capacity strategy. In each group, the first scenario represents Normal market demand, the second scenario denotes High demand by customers (daily customer orders are two times Normal customer order amount), and the third scenario describes the Low demand by customers (daily customer orders are half of the Normal order amount). Figure 8.2 shows a vertical comparison of the changes in agents' assets when customer behavior and demand by customers change.

Supply chain performance influenced by the customer agent Demand by Customers: The graphs in Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2(c) show that when market demand is Low, comparing with Normal market demand, the asset of every agent will decrease in all situations. When market demand is High (Scenario 20), if all manufacturing agents increase their production capacity, all agents will earn more profits (Figure 8.2(b)). However, if not all manufacturing agents increase their production capacities (Scenarios 2, 14 and 23) the benefits will not be as high as expected. When market demand is Normal, all agents' final assets will not change significantly in all situations unless all manufacturing agents increase their production capacities (Figure 8.2(a)). Customer Behavior: Figure 8.3 is a comparison of customer order fulfillment between the Accumulating order and Giving Up order options. The first column shows the results of Giving Up orders, and the second column shows the result of Accumulating orders. The results show that when the customer adopts Accumulating policy, order fulfillments are not improved significantly when market demand by customers is Normal or High.

Figure 8.3 Comparison of customer order fulfillment between Accumulating order and Giving Up order

Analysis of the customer agent When market demand by customer is High, all agents' assets will not be improved remarkably if all production agents have not increased their production capacities. This is because the supply chain works as a whole and a one point limitation will influence the performance of the whole chain. Retailer agents often confront product shortages (Scenarios 2, 14 and 23 in Figure 8.3). If all producing agents increase their production capacities, all agents will benefit from the High market demand because customer order fulfillment has been enhanced (comparison of Scenarios 2, 14 and 23 with 20 in Figure 8.3). Similar to the customer market demand parameter, the Accumulating order policy does not obviously improved customer order fulfillment. The production limitation by manufacturing agent(s) restricts the sales of the retailer agents. Figure 8.4 shows the comparison results of Scenario 2 and Scenario 14, in which Scenario 2 uses Giving
113

Up customer orders while Scenario 14 uses Accumulating customer orders. The figure indicates that Accumulating order policy does not enhance the whole supply chain performance significantly.

Figure 8.4 Comparison of customer order fulfillments

8.3 Retailer Agent Analysis 
A retailer is the bridge between customers and product holders. The retailer's factors that influence supply chain performance include the retailer's inventory strategy (product Order Amount Policy, and Order Point Strategy), product selling prices, promotion strategies, and customer service policies (product return, product change, product discount, etc.). In this system, we will only consider the retailer's inventory strategy. Order Amount Policy (OA) has two possible values: 0 ­ In Proportion: the product order amount relies on the product's market share; 1 ­ Same: all product order amounts are equal. Order Point Strategy has two possibilities: 0 ­ Conservative: a retailer sends an order for a product when its inventory is less than adequate for two weeks of sales; 1 ­ Positive: which means a retailer sends an order request for a product when its inventory is less adequate for three weeks of sales.

Retailer Agent's Order Amount Policy Analysis Figures 8.5 and 8.6 show the overall performance of the supply chain when retailers adopt different order amount policies in various environments. The environment in Figure 8.5 is as follows: · · · customer agent adopts the Giving Up order policy; retailer agents adopt the Conservative Order Point Strategy; product holder agents adopt the In Proportion Order Amount, the Conservative Order Point, and the Stock-to-Order policies; · assembler and component agents adopt the In Proportion order amount, the Conservative Order Point, Normal production capacity, and the

Make-to-Stock policies; · material agents adopt Normal production capacity, and the Make-to-Stock policies; · Logers has 70% market share, and Pell has 30%.

For Scenarios 1 and 2, both retailers adopt the In Proportion Order Amount Policy. In Scenarios 4 and 5, Logers adopts the Same Order Amount Policy while Pell adopts the In Proportion policy. In Scenarios 7 and 8, Logers adopts the In Proportion policy while Pell adopts the Same Amount Policy. In Scenarios 10 and 11, both Logers and Pell adopt the Same Amount Policy. In Scenarios 25 and 26, both retailers adopt the In Proportion Order Amount Policy, and Mokia and Notorola adopt the Same Order Amount Policy. The environment in Figure 8.6 is the same as in Figure 8.5 except that both Logers and Pell have 50% market share.

Figure 8.5 shows that in the normal environment, when customer demand is Normal, changes to the retailer agents' order amount policy results in no significant difference. This is because the production capacities of the manufacturing agents have

been adequate to meet market demands. When demand is High, most agents except product holders, will receive similar revenues as when market demand is Normal. Mokia will earn more profit while Notorola will lose some profit. If all agents and not just retailer agents adopt the In Proportion Order Amount Policy, Notorola will lose their whole market share (bankrupt) and Mokia will receive more profit than with other order combinations of amount policies. This is because the manufacturing agents have production limitations and Mokia has more market share. Mokia is sold very fast, and obtains most of the contracts and as a results take most of the manufacturing agent's production. Notorola obtains few contracts, therefore retailers often face shortages for Notorola's product. Figure 8.7 has clearly identified this point: the total sales of the Mokia product are 80069 (55935 + 24134) in Scenario 2, more than Scenario 1 sales which are 53418 (37483 + 16035). The total sales of Notorola product are 13653 (9078 + 4575) in Scenario 2, less than Scenario 1 sales which are 34914 (24080 + 10834).

Figure 8.7 Retailers' performance for customer orders

Figure 8.6 shows that when retailer agents have equal market share in the normal environment, and market demand by customers is Normal or High, there is no significant difference in the performance of all agents' with all combinations of retailers' order amount policies. Figure 8.8 shows the detailed sales information for each of the retailers.

Retailer Agent's Order Point Strategy Analysis To investigate the influence of the retailer's Order Point Strategy, three group situations were tested. The first group, shown in Figure 8.9, uses the following situation: · · · the customer agent adopts the Giving Up order policy; retailer agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy; product holder agents adopt the Same Order Amount, Conservative Order Point, and Stock-to-Order policies and strategies; · assembler and component agents adopt the Same Order Amount, Conservative Order Point, Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock policies and strategies; · material agents adopt the Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock policies; · Logers has 70% market share, and Pell has 30%.

In Scenarios 29 and 30, both retailers adopt the Positive Order Point Strategy. In Scenarios 31 and 32, Logers adopts the Conservative Order Point Strategy while Pell adopts the Positive Order Point Strategy. In Scenarios 33 and 34, both Logers and Pell adopt the Conservative Order Point Strategy. In Scenarios 35 and 36, Logers adopts the Positive Order Point Strategy while Pell adopts the Conservative Order Point Strategy. The second group, shown in Figure 8.10, uses the following settings: · · · · Logers and Pell have equal market share (50% each); the customer agent adopts the Giving Up order policy; retailer agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy; product holder agents adopt the Same Order Amount, Conservative Order Point, and Stock-to-Order policies and strategies;

120

·

assembler and component agents adopt the Same Order Amount, Conservative Order Point, Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock policies and strategies;

·

material agents adopt the Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock policies.

In Scenarios 122 and 123, both Logers and Pell adopt the Conservative Order Point Strategy. In Scenarios 124 and 125, Logers adopts the Positive Order Point Strategy while Pell adopts the Conservative Order Point Strategy. In Scenarios 126 and 127, both retailers adopt the Positive Order Point Strategy.

(b) High market demand by customers Figure 8.11 Supply chain performance when retailer agents change order point strategies in the extreme environment (Both Logers and Pell have 50% market share) Figure 8.9 shows that when the environment and customer demand are normal, there is no significant change for any agent among all scenarios (Figure 8.9(a)). If the Customer demand is High (Figure 8.9(b)), Pell will always obtain more profit, and Logers will usually lose some profit. In Scenarios 29 and 30, both Logers and Pell adopted the Positive Order Amount Policy, Logers lost 10% of its assets ($1903000 vs. $1698000) and Pell gained 22% more assets ($1027000 vs. $1251000). In Scenarios 31 and 32, Logers adopted the Conservative policy while Pell adopted the Positive policy. Pell sold 28788 (17771 + 11017) and 38522 (24622 + 13900) phones, and its assets were $970000 and $1469000. Figure 8.13 shows the sales figures for these scenarios. Pell increased its sales by 34% and its assets by 51%. Logers sold 63893 (40518 + 23375) and 56600 (34300 + 22300) phones and Logers' assets were $1861000 and $1498000. Logers lost 11.4% sales and 19.5% of its assets. In

Scenarios 33 and 34, both Logers and Pell adopted the Conservative policy, Logers lost 5.5% of its assets ($1885000 vs. $ 1781000) while Pell gained 21.7% more assets ($966000 vs. $1176000). In Scenarios 35 and 36, Logers adopted the Positive policy while Pell adopted the Conservative policy. Logers sold 65640 (40559 + 25081) phones in Scenario 35 and 66955 (51095 + 15900) phones in Scenario 36 (2%

increase). Its assets were $1946000 in Scenario 35 and $2023000 in Scenario 35 (4% increase). Pell sold 27011 (16324 + 10687) phones in Scenario 35 and 28600 (19900 + 8700) phones in Scenario 36 (6% increase). Its assets were $883000 in Scenario 35 and $968000 in Scenario 36 (10% increase). In most cases, Mokia gains more profit while Notorola loses some profit except in the situation where Logers adopts the Conservative Order Amount Policy and Pell adopts the Positive policy. Comparing Scenarios 29 and 30, Mokia gained 27% more assets while Notorola lost 47% of its assets. Comparing Scenarios 31 and 32, Notorola gained 7.6% more assets while Mokia's assets almost the same. Comparing Scenarios 33 and 34, Mokia gained 18% more assets while Notorola lost 25% of its assets. Comparing Scenarios 35 and 36, Mokia gained 39% more asset while Notorola lost 56% of its assets. Table 8.2 provides detailed contract information for retailers, product holders, and assemblers. It also provides detailed production information about the assemblers. The term Ratio refers to the actual market share of the product in that scenario. The results in Table 8.2(a) and (b) shows that Mokia always has more market share (62% - 75%) than it should be (60%), and Notorola always loses market share when customer demand is High and there is no increase in production capacity by the manufacturing agents. Table 8.2(e) shows that nearly 50% of working days all assembler agents cannot assemble mobile phones, although the market demand is High. This is because the limited production capacity of component and raw material agents.

Figure 8.10 shows that in the normal environment, when retailers have equal market share, and customer demand is Normal, changes in order point strategies by retailers result in no significant change to any agent's assets. But when customer demand is High, the assets of product holder agents will change if retailers change their order point strategies. When both Logers and Pell adopt the Conservative Order Point Strategy (Scenarios 122 and 123), Mokia earned 22% more assets while Notorola lost 23% of its assets. Although Mokia should have 60% market share, the actual market share of Mokia is 64.5%, and the Notorola share is only 35.5%. When Logers adopted the Positive Order Point Policy and Pell adopted the Conservative policy (Scenarios 124 and 125), Mokia earned 32% more assets while Notorola lost 33% of its assets. When both Logers and Pell adopted the Positive policy (Scenarios 126 and 127) Mokia lost 19% of its assets and Notorola earned 35% more assets. Figure 8.13 shows retailers' performance when demand by customers is High. The result is similar with Group one (Figure 8.9).

Figure 8.13 Retailers' performance for customer orders

Figure 8.11 shows that in the extreme environment, if retailers have equal market share, and market demand by customers is either Normal or High, there is no significant difference in Order Amount Policy combinations for all of agents. This is because in the extreme environment, the production capacities of all manufacturing agents can meet most of the market needs, and most of customers' orders are fulfilled. Figure 8.14 demonstrates this (only a small number of customer orders have been lost).

Figure 8.14 Retailers' performance for customer orders

8.4 Product Holder Agent Analysis 
A product holder is the core of a supply chain. Factors pertaining to product holders that influence the performance of the whole supply chain include product quality, product selling prices, customer service quality, inventory strategy, product Order Amount Policy, Order Point Strategy, and promotion strategies, etc. In this

130

4431

8694

4429

system, inventory strategy, Order Amount Policy, and Order Point Strategy will be considered. Inventory strategy has three possible values: 0 ­ Order-to-Order: product holder carries no inventory. When an RFQ is receives from a retailer, it is transferred to the assemblers. If at least one assembler can satisfy the RFQ, the product holder will accept the retailer's RFQ; 1 ­ Stock-to-Order: product holder will keep a certain amount of inventory. Inventory is checked first and if the inventory is no less than the order amount, the RFQ is accepted. If the inventory is insufficient, the RFQ will be rejected; 2 ­ Changing Policy Iteratively: starting at Stock-to-Order policy, product holder will change its inventory policy every six months with the starting policy be determined by the system randomly. Order Amount Policy has two options: 0 ­ In Proportion: product's order amount is based on the product's market share; 1 ­ Same: all order amounts are the same. Order Point Strategy has two options: 0 ­ Conservative: a product holder sends an order request when its inventory is lower than two weeks sales; 1 ­ Positive: a product holder sends an order request when its inventory is lower than three weeks sales.

Product Holder's Order Amount Policy Analysis Product holders use a different Order Amount Policy in order to maintain inventories, and to endeavor to sell as many phones as possible to retailers. Figures 8.15 and 8.17 show the overall performances of the supply chain when product

131

holders adopt different order amount policies in various environments. The environment in Figure 8.15 is as follows: · · customer agent adopts the Giving Up order policy; retailer agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and the Conservative Order Point Strategy; · product holder agents adopt the Positive Order Point and the Stock-to-Order inventory policies; · assembler and component agents adopt the Same Order Amount, Conservative Order Point, Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies; · material agents adopt the Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies; · Mokia has 60% market share, and Notorola has 40% market share.

In Scenarios 41 and 42 product holders adopt the Same Order Amount Policy. In Scenarios 43 and 44 product holders adopt the In Proportion Amount policy. In Scenarios 45 and 46 Notorola adopts the In Proportion policy while the Mokia adopts Same Amount Policy. In Scenarios 180 and 181 Mokia adopts the In Proportion policy while Notorola adopts the Same Amount Policy. Figure 8.15 shows that that in a normal environment, when market demand by customers is Normal, changes in a product holder agent's Order Amount policy result in no significant difference for any agent. When market demand by customers is High, the only way Notorola can minimize profit loss is to adopt the In Proportion Order Amount Policy. Otherwise, Notorola will lose significant sales while Mokia gains those extra sales.

The environment in Figure 8.17 is similar with that in Figure 8.15 except that Mokia and Notorola have an equal market share (50% each). The Order Amount Policy combinations which product holders adopted in the scenarios in Figure 8.17 are the same as those in the scenarios in Figure 8.15. Figure 8.17 shows that in the normal environment when product holders have equal market share, and market demand by customers is either Normal or High, there are no significant differences for all other agents when product holder agents change their Order Amount polices. For the product holder agents themselves, Mokia always earns more profit while Notorola loses some profit, especially when Notorola adopts the In Proportion policy.

Product Holder's Order Point Strategy Analysis A product holder may adopt a different Order Point strategy to keep sufficient inventories to obtain more contracts from retailers. When the Positive strategy is adopted, more inventories are usually kept by product holders. The product holders face more inventory cost and risk that the entire inventory cannot be sold, causing the product holders to bear significant financial burdens. Figure 8.19 shows how a product holder's Order Point Strategy influences the entire supply chain. The environment in Figure 8.19 is as follows: · customer adopts the Giving Up order policy;

140

·

retailer agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and Conservative Order Point Strategy;

·

product holder agents adopt the Same Order Amount and Stock-to-Order inventory policies;

·

assembler and component agents adopt the Same Order Amount, Conservative Order Point, Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies;

·

material agents adopt the Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies;

· ·

Logers has 70% market share and Pell has 30%; Mokia has 60% market share, and Notorola has 40%.

(b) High market demand by customers Figure 8.19 Supply chain performance when product holders change order point strategy in normal environment (Mokia has 60% and Notorola has 40% market share) In Scenarios 37 and 38 Mokia and Notorola adopt the Conservative Order Point Strategy. In Scenarios 39 and 40 Mokia adopts the Positive strategy while Notorola adopts the Conservative strategy. In Scenarios 41 and 42 both Mokia and Notorola adopt the Positive strategy. In Scenarios 177 and 178 Mokia adopts the Conservative strategy while Notorola adopts the Positive strategy. The results show that when customer demand is Normal, there are no obvious differences for any agent if product holders change their Order Point strategies. When customer demand is High, Pell and Mokia usually benefit from the High market demand, but Logers and Notorola lose some sales. When both product holders adopt the Positive Order Point Strategy, Mokia will gain the most profit while Notorola loses the most profit. Figure 8.20 provides the retailers' performance for customer orders, and Table 8.5 shows the contract information of those scenarios. Figure 8.20 shows that when customer demand is High, some customer orders to Logers will be lost due to the limited production capacity of the manufacturing agents. Logers lost 8% sales in Scenario 37 compared to Scenario 38; lost 4% sales in Scenario 39 compared to Scenario 40; lost 4% sales in Scenario 41 compared to 42; and lost 5% sales in

Product Holder's Inventory Strategy Analysis To investigate how the product holder's inventory strategy influences the entire supply chain performance, two groups of scenarios were tested. The first group, shown in Figure 8.21, uses the following settings: · · customer adopts the Giving Up order policy; retailers adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and Conservative Order Point Strategy; · product holder agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and Conservative Order Point Strategy;

145

·

assembler and component agents adopt the Same Order Amount, Conservative Order Point, Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies;

·

material agents adopt the Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies;

· ·

Logers has 70% market share while Pell has 30%; Mokia has 60% market share and Notorola has 40%.

The second group, shown in Figure 8.23, is the same situation as the first group, except that Mokia and Notorola have equal market share (50% each).

(f) Comparison of Scenario 53 with Scenario 54 Figure 8.21 Supply chain performance when product holders change inventory strategies in normal environment (Mokia 60%, Notorola 40% market share) Figure 8.21 shows a comparison of several scenarios using different inventory strategies. In Scenarios 47 and 48, both Mokia and Notorola adopt the Order-to-Order inventory strategy. In Scenarios 49 and 50 Mokia adopts the Stock-to-Order strategy while Notorola adopts the Order-to-Order strategy. In Scenarios 51 and 52 Mokia adopts the Order-to-Order strategy while Notorola adopts the Stock-to-Order strategy. In Scenarios 53 and 54 both Mokia and Notorola adopt the Stock-to-Order strategy. Figure 8.21 shows that there is no significant difference for most agents (retailer, component and material agents) when the product holder's inventory strategies are changed and customer demand is either Normal or High. For assembler agents the best product holders' inventory strategy is the Stock-to-Order Inventory Strategy. For the product holder agents themselves, the Order-to-Order strategy is best. Figure 8.22 shows the retailers' performance for these scenarios and Table 8.6 displays the contract information.

Comparing High customer demand with Normal demand, Logers maintains sales or may lose a small amount of sales while Pell gains sales. Mokia usually gains some sales except in the situation where Mokia adopts the Stock-to-Order and Notorola adopts the Order-to-Order strategy. Notorola usually loses some sales unless Mokia adopts the Stock-to-Order strategy while Notorola adopts the Order-to-Order strategy. The following will examine the performance of each combination of product holder's inventory strategies. Logers kept the same sales in Scenarios 47 and 48; lost 5% sales in Scenario 49 compared to Scenario 50; maintained nearly the same sales in Scenarios 51 and Scenario 52, and lost 6% sales in Scenario 53 compared to Scenario 54. Pell earned 4% more sales in Scenario 47 than Scenario 48; 17% more sales in Scenario 49 than Scenario 50, earned 12% more sales in Scenario 51 than in Scenario 52; and 20% more sales in Scenario 53 than Scenario 54. Mokia earned 6.7% more sales in Scenario 47 than Scenario 48; lost 10% sales in Scenario 49 compared to Scenario 50; earned 6% more sales in Scenario 51 than Scenario 52; and earned 18% more sales in Scenario 53 than Scenario 54. Notorola lost 7.6% sales in Scenario 47 compared to Scenario 48; earned 23% more sales in Scenario 49 than Scenario 50; lost 1% sales in Scenario 51 compared to Scenario 52; and lost 24% sales in Scenario 53 compared to Scenario 54.

(f) Comparison of Scenario 142 with Scenario 143 Figure 8.23 Supply chain performance when product holders change inventory strategies in normal environment (Both Mokia and Notorola have 50% market share) Figure 8.23 shows a comparison of several scenarios with different product holder inventory strategies. In Scenarios 136 and 137 both Mokia and Notorola adopt the Order-to-Order inventory strategy. In Scenarios 138 and 139 Mokia adopts the Order-to-Order strategy while Notorola adopts the Stock-to-Order strategy. In Scenarios 140 and 141 Mokia adopts the Stock-to-Order strategy while Notorola adopts the Order-to-Order strategy. In Scenarios 142 and 143 both Mokia and Notorola adopt the Stock-to-Order strategy. Figure 8.23 shows that when market demand changes from Normal to High, Logers has very little change, Pell and Mokia always obtain more sales and Notorola always loses sales. Figure 8.24 provides details of retailers' performance for these scenarios, and Table 8.7 displays the contract information.

The simulation results show that when market demand is High, Mokia will earn more market share while Notorola will lose some market share. Logers usually loses some sales while Pell always earns more sales. The following will examine the performance of each combination of product holder's inventory strategies. Logers earned 2.6% more sales in Scenario 137 than Scenario 136; lost 2% sales in Scenario 139 compared to Scenario 138; lost 3% sales in Scenario 141 compared to Scenario 140; and lost 0.7% sales in Scenario 143 compared to Scenario 142. Pell earned 3.4% more sales in Scenario 137 than Scenario 136; 8% more sales in Scenario 139 than Scenario 138; 12% more sales in Scenario 141 than Scenario 140; and 7.5% sales in Scenario 143 than Scenario 142. Mokia earned 19% more sales in Scenario 137 than Scenario 136; 24% more sales in Scenario 139 than Scenario 138; 14% more sales in Scenario 141 than Scenario 140; and 43% more sales in Scenario 143 than Scenario 142. Notorola lost 15% sales in Scenario 137 compared to Scenario 136; lost 25% sales in Scenario 139 compared to Scenario 138; lost 12% sales in Scenario 141 compared to Scenario 140; and lost 44% sales in Scenario 143 compared to Scenario 142.

8.5 Assembler Agent Analysis 
Assembler factors that influence the performance of the whole supply chain include its assembling quality, production capacity, assembling cost, inventory strategy, product Order Amount Policy, Order Point Strategy, etc. In this system, production capacity, inventory strategy, Order Amount Policy, and Order Point Strategy will be considered. Like the product holder agent, inventory strategy has three possible values: 0 ­ Make-to-Order: the assembler agent keeps no inventory. When a request-for-quotation (RFQ) is received from a product holder, the assembler will send an RFQ to the component agents to determine if the components are available. If all component agents can satisfy the RFQs, the assembler will accept the product holder's RFQ. After the product holder changes the RFQ to a contract, the assembler will transfer its RFQs to contracts. When the components are available, the phone will be assembled to fulfill the contract. 1 ­ Make-to-Stock: an assembler produces stock to maintain a certain inventory level. When the assembler receives an RFQ from a product holder, the assembler first checks the inventory. If the inventory is no less than the order amount, the RFQ will be accepted. If the inventory is insufficient the RFQ will be rejected. 2 ­ Changing inventory policy iteratively: an assembler will change its inventory policy every half year. Order Amount Policy has two options: 0 ­ In Proportion; 1 ­ Same. Order Point Strategy has two options: 0 ­ Conservative; 1 ­ Positive.
158

Production Capacity has three possible values: 0 ­ Normal: an assembler's production capacity can meet Normal customer demand (150 units per day); 1 ­ Maximum: an assembler has the maximum production capacity (two times Normal capacity ­ 300 units per day); and 2 ­ Minimum: the assembler only has half Normal production capacity (75 units per day)

Assembler's Order Amount Policy Analysis The two assemblers compete for mobile phone components from the component agents. They also compete for orders from product holder agents. An assembler may adopt a different Order Amount Policy in order to seize more resources and earn more profit. Figure 8.25 shows the overall performance of the entire supply chain when assemblers adopt different order amount policies. The settings for these scenarios are as follows: · · customer agent adopts the Giving Up order policy; retailers adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and Conservative Order Point Strategy; · product holder agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, Conservative Order Point Strategy, and Stock-to-Order strategy; · assembler agents adopt the Conservative Order Point, Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies; · component agents adopt the Same Order Amount, Conservative Order Point, Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies; · material agents adopt Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies; · Mokia has 60% market share and Notorola has 40%.

In Scenarios 75 and 76 both Markham and London adopt the In Proportion policy. In Scenarios 77 and 78 Markham adopts the In Proportion policy while London
159

adopts the Same Order Amount Policy. In Scenarios 79 and 80 both Markham and London adopt the Same Order Amount Policy. In Scenario 81 and 82 Markham adopts the Same Order Amount Policy while London adopts the In Proportion Order Amount Policy.

Assembler's Order Point Strategy Analysis Figure 8.26 shows the overall performance of the supply chain when the assemblers' order point strategies change. The settings for these scenarios are: · · customer agent adopts the Giving Up order policy; retailers adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and Conservative Order Point Strategy; · product holder agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, Conservative Order Point Strategy, and Stock-to-Order strategy; · assembler agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies; · component agents adopt the Same Order Amount, Conservative Order Point, Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies; · material agents adopt the Normal production capacity, and Make-to-Stock inventory policies; · Mokia has 60% market share, and Notorola has 40%.

In Scenarios 79 and 80 both Markham and London adopt the Same Order Amount Policy. In Scenarios 83 and 84 all assemblers adopt the Conservative strategy. In Scenarios 85 and 86 Markham adopts the Positive strategy while London adopts the Conservative strategy. In Scenarios 87 and 88 all assemblers adopt Positive strategy. The results indicate that when market demand by customers is Normal, there is no significant change to any agent's profit when he Order Point Strategy changes. When market demand is High, Logers and Mokia usually lose some sales while Pell and Notorola gain same sales.

(f) Comparison of Scenario 87 with Scenario 88 Figure 8.26 Supply chain performance when assemblers change order point strategies in normal environment Figure 8.26 shows that in Normal market demand the results are similar when assemblers change their Order Point Strategy as when they change their Order Amount policy (Figure 8.25); there is no significant difference for all agents. When market demand is High, Logers and Notorola usually lose some profit, while Pell and Mokia gain some profit.

Assembler's Production Capacity Analysis Figure 8.27 shows the overall performance when assemblers adopt different production capacities. The settings for this group of scenarios are normal except for assemblers' production capacities. In Scenarios 67 and 68 Markham has Normal production capacity while London has Maximum Production Capacity (300 units per day). In Scenarios 69 and 70 Markham has Maximum Production Capacity while London has Normal production capacity. In Scenarios 71 and 72 Markham has Minimum production capacity (75 units per day) while London has Normal production capacity.

When market demand by customers is High, changing assemblers' production capacity will normally result in Logers losing some sales and Pell gaining more sales. The profits of the Product
168

holders' depend on the combination of the assemblers' production capacities. Although an assembler has Maximum Production Capacity, the performance of the whole chain will not change as production is limited by component and material agents.

Assembler's Inventory Strategy Analysis Figure 8.28 displays the overall performance of the whole supply chain under different combinations of assemblers' inventory strategies. The settings for this group of scenarios are normal. In Scenarios 59 and 60 all assemblers adopt the Make-to-Order strategy. In Scenarios 61 and 62 Markham adopts the Make-to-Order strategy while London adopts the Make-to-Stock strategy. In Scenarios 63 and 64 Markham adopts the Make-to-Stock while London adopts the Make-to-Order strategies. In Scenarios 65 and 66 all assemblers adopt the Make-to-Stock strategy. Figure 8.28 indicates that when customer demand is Normal and all assemblers adopt the Make-to-Order strategy, the whole supply chain performance is very poor except for Mokia. Retailers have only 40% profits and Notorola has negative assets (bankruptcy). The component agents' profits are reduced approximately 45% and material agents' profits are reduced 35%. The assembler agents' profits are also lower than average. In other situations, the profits for all agents except assemblers will be almost the same. In situations where assemblers adopt differing inventory strategies, the assembler who adopts the Make-to-Stock strategy will get more profit. In scenarios with High market demand by customers, the simulation results are similar to scenarios with Normal market demand. If all of assemblers adopt the Make-to-Order strategy, retailers' assets will be reduced approximately 15%, component and material agents' assets will decrease approximately 5%, Notorola will be bankrupt, and Mokia will gain 70% more assets. This results because of the long lead time of assemblers' production. Although assemblers often have no work to do Notorola has a smaller market share and has difficulty getting contracts from the assemblers. When assemblers adopt differing inventory strategies, the assembler who adopts the
169

Make-to-Stock strategy will gain more profit while the assembler who adopts the Make-to-Order strategy will lose some profit. Other agents will not be affected.

8.6 Component Agent Analysis 
Component agent factors that influence the performance of the whole supply chain are similar with assembler factors. They may include production quality, production capacity, production cost, inventory strategy, product Order Amount Policy, Order Point Strategy, etc. In this system, production capacity, inventory strategy, Order Amount Policy, and Order Point Strategy will be considered. Inventory strategy has three possible values: 0 ­ Make-to-Order; 1 ­ Make-to-Stock; 2 ­ Changing inventory policy iteratively. Order Amount Policy has two options: 0 ­ In Proportion; 1 ­ Same. Order Point Strategy has two options: 0 ­ Conservative; 1 ­ Positive. Production Capacity has three possible values: 0 ­ Normal: 200 units per day; 1 ­ Maximum: two times Normal capacity ­ 400 units per day; 2 ­ Minimum: 100 units per day.

Component Agent's Order Amount Policy Analysis Figure 8.29 shows the overall performance of the supply chain when component agents change their order amount policies in normal environment. In Scenarios 81 and 82 all of component agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy. In Scenarios 165 and 166 all component agents adopt the In Proportion policy. In Scenarios 167 and 168 Housing agent adopts the In Proportion policy while PCBA adopts the Same Order Amount Policy. The results indicate that there are no significant differences for

any agent's asset when component agents change their order amount policies and market demand by customers is Normal. If market demand by customers is High and both component agents adopt the Same Order Amount Policy, Logers and Notorola always lose some profit, while Pell and Mokia will gain some profit. When other order amount policy combinations are adopted, Logers and Mokia always lose some profit, while Pell and Notorola will gain some profit.

Normal and if both component agents adopt the Positive order amount strategy, Mokia will lose some sales while Notorola will gain more sales. When market demand is High and both component agents adopt the Conservative strategy, Logers and Notorola will lose some sales (approximately 5%), while Pell and Mokia will gain more sales (approximately 10%). If both component agents adopt the Positive strategy, Logers will lose 10% of sales, Pell will gain 25% more sales, Mokia will gain 18% more assets, and Notorola will lose 25% assets. When component agents adopt different order point strategies, Logers will lose 10% sales, Pell will gain 25% more sales, Mokia will lose 35% assets, and Notorola will gain 85% more assets.

In Scenarios 81 and 82 all component agents have Normal Production Capacities. In Scenarios 159 and 160 all component agents have Maximum Production Capacity. In Scenarios 161 and 162 Housing agent has Maximum Capacity while the PCBA agent has Normal Production Capacity; In Scenarios 163 and 164 the Housing agent has Minimum Production Capacity while the PCBA agent has Normal Production Capacity. The results indicate that provided no component agent' production capacity is limited, there are no significant differences for any agent's assets. When at least one component agent's production capacity is Minimum, all agents' profits are reduced, except the Mokia agent. The Notorola agent will end up in bankruptcy. The results when customer demand is High are similar to Normal customer demand.

8.7 Raw Material Agent Analysis 
Raw material agent factors that influence the performance of the whole supply chain include production quality, production capacity, production cost, inventory strategy, etc. In this system, production capacity and inventory strategy will be considered. Inventory strategy has three possible values: 0 ­ Make-to-Order; 1 ­ Make-to-Stock; 2 ­ Changing inventory policy iteratively which the starting policy will be determined by the system randomly. Production Capacity has three possible values: 0 ­ Normal: 300 units per day; 1 ­ Maximum: two times Normal capacity ­ 600 units per day; and
181

481 481

582 582

2 ­ Minimum: 150 units per day.

Raw Material Agent's Production Capacity Analysis Figure 8.33 shows the supply chain overall performance when raw material agents changes their production capacities in normal environment. In Scenarios 81 and 82, all raw material agents have Normal Production Capacities. In Scenarios 93 and 94, all raw material agents have Maximum Production Capacity. In Scenarios 95 and 96, the Metal agent has Maximum Capacity while the Silicon agent has Normal Production Capacity. In Scenarios 97 and 98, the Metal agent has Minimum Production Capacity while the Silicon agent has Normal Production Capacity. The results indicate that when market demand by customers is Normal and at least one raw material agent has Normal Production Capacity and no agent has Minimum capacity, there are no changes to an agent's final assets. If all raw material agents have Maximum Production Capacities, all agents will gain a little more profit. If at least one material agent has Minimum Production Capacity, all agents will end up in bankruptcy. The performance of the whole supply chain has similar results when market demand by customers is High.

In Scenarios 81 and 82, all raw material agents adopt the Make-to-Stock strategy. In Scenarios 89 and 90, all raw material agents adopt the Make-to-Order strategy. In Scenarios 91 and 92, the Metal agent adopts the Make-to-Order strategy while the Silicon agent adopts the Make-to-Stock strategy. The results indicate that there are no significant differences for any agents' assets when raw material agents change their inventory strategies and market demand by customers is Normal. When market demand is High, Pell will always gain more benefit. If material agents adopt differing inventory strategies, Mokia will gain more market share while Notorola will lose some sales.

8.8 Discussions 
The results of this mobile phone simulation system have shown some facts and revealed some phenomena. If market demand by customers is Low, all agents will get little profits. If market demand by customers is High, all agents will still get little benefit unless at least one of the manufacturing agents can increase its production

capacity. Usually accumulating unfulfilled customer's orders is good for the entire supply chain except when at least one manufacturing agent has Minimum production capacity because then all agents will not benefit. A retailer agent may gain more profit if it collects unfulfilled customer orders. It is suitable for a retailer to adopt the Positive Order Point Strategy (which means increasing the inventory level) if the resource is scarce. If market demand by customers is High while one or more manufacturing agents have limited production, a retailer may adopt the Same Order Amount Policy in order to get the most benefit. If all manufacturing agents have maximum production capacities, the In Proportion Order Amount Policy is the first choice for retailers. For a product holder agent, when market demand by customers is High, keeping Maximum inventory (which means adopting the Stock-to-Order strategy) is a wise decision. If the market demand by customers is Low, the Order-to-Order strategy should be adopted to reduce inventory cost. If one or more manufacturing agents have limited production capacity, a product holder agent may adopt the Same Order Amount Policy and the Positive Order Point Strategy. If component agents have limited supplies, an assembler should adopt the Make-to-Stock strategy, Same Order Amount Policy and Positive Order Point Strategy when market demand by customers is Normal or High. If a raw material agent has a production capacity limitation and market demand by customers is Normal or High, assembler and component agents should adopt the Make-to-Stock strategy, Same Order Amount Policy and Positive Order Point Strategy. Product holder agents should adopt the Stock-to-Order strategy, Same Order Amount Policy and Positive Order Point Strategy.

Chapter 9 Conclusions and Future Work
9.1 Conclusions   
Each entity in a supply chain has its own characteristics and business strategies. A successful supply chain model must include most of the activities among all partners to examine many business strategies. The intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation system designed here has considered not only many business activities, but has also included knowledge management issues. Although the simulation model only has six layers, it can be extended to more layers with no difficulty, as necessary. Information and message exchanging is very fast (real time) and low cost because it relies on new communication media ­ the Internet. In this system, new analysis and application systems, such as SAP BI/BO/FI/CO/MM/SD, PeopleSoft HCM/HRMS/ERP/CRM, and Microsoft Dynamics ERP, can be integrated. A knowledge-based decision support engine will provide the system's intellectual ability. The prototype mobile phone simulation system designed and implemented in this research has partially achieved the functions and objectives of an intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation system. Because of time limitation, some functions have not been implemented in the system. Even so, the simulation results have revealed many valuable operational strategies. For example, if market demand by customers is High, retailers should share this information with all of the supply chain partners. Therefore, the manufacturing companies (assemblers, semi-product manufactures, component/element manufactures, and raw material providers) can increase their production capacities, and all of supply chain partners will gain more profit. For inventory strategy, if the market demand is very low, Order-to-Order strategy is the best choice for product holders and retailers, and Make-to-Order strategy is the first option for the manufacturing companies.

The main contributions of this dissertation include: 1. A supply chain focused enterprise architecture model is presented. The model considers all aspects of an enterprise, from external to internal factors, from soft to hard factors, from uncontrollable to manageable factors, and from equipment to knowledge factors. The architecture divides an enterprise into four elements: enterprise organization, business processing activities, workplace and properties, and management and technologies. The strengths and weaknesses of an enterprise can be identified by analyzing each of these elements. The proposed enterprise architecture stresses knowledge management as an important factor in the development of an enterprise. 2. An intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation system model is designed. The simulation system is based on the supply chain focused enterprise architecture model. In this system, an agent has five components: interface; task distribution; business processing activities, knowledge management and decision support; and information storage. The supply chain simulation system can be used to simulate and evaluate strategies for business processing activities and management. 3. A generic prototype mobile phone simulation system is designed, developed, implemented, and validated. The system has six layers: one customer agent, two retailer agents, two product holder agents, two assembler agents, two component agents, and two raw material agents. The system can be used to test 32 factors that may affect the performance of the entire supply chain including: customer demand, customer behavior, retailer's inventory strategy, product holder's inventory strategy, assembler's production strategy and inventory strategy. Many techniques, methodologies and human behaviors in supply chain management can be studied using this simulation system. Comparing with the Beer game and TAC-SCM simulation systems in the literature, the system developed in this dissertation has six layers while the Beer game has four layers (retailer, whole seller, distributor, and factory) and the TAC-SCM system has three (consumer, assembler, and component).

4. A large number of scenarios were tested in different environments, and each factor's influence on the entire supply chain was analyzed. Through this system, a user can determine the best strategies and policies for an agent in a given situation. 5. The generic supply chain simulation system developed can be used in a number of ways, including: as an analysis tool for an entity in a supply chain from the entity's perspective; as a tool for studying supply chain coordination and integration from the perspective of an entire supply chain, or portion of it; as a tool to design supply chains by answering "what-if" questions.

9.2 Future Work 
As mentioned in the previous section, the designed and implemented mobile phone simulation system has not accomplished some objectives and functions. One of the future work is to fulfill those functions. Enhancement could include using Microsoft BizTalk server as a way to implement business communication and negotiation; integrating a demand forecasting module from other ERP systems (such as SAP and PeopleSoft); and developing a production scheduling and planning module (instead of using the First-Due-First production policy). Accomplishing those functions will enhance the proposed intelligent agent-based supply chain simulation system.
