Abstract

This thesis presents the introduction, analysis and experimental verification of the sixpulse SCR rectifier and multi-pulse SCR rectifiers.

As a fundamental three-phase controllable ac-dc converter, the six-pulse SCR rectifier is widely used in industry. However, it generates high Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in the line current. One of the solutions is to use multi-pulse rectifiers. Multi-pulse rectifiers could be classified into the 12-, 18- and 24-pulse configurations. Application examples include high voltage direct current transmission systems, high power battery chargers and load commutated current source inverter powered motor drives.

In this thesis, the six-, 12-, 18- and 24-pulse SCR rectifiers with inductive and capacitive loads are introduced. The line current THD and the input PF of various rectifiers are investigated. The principle of the harmonic elimination through phaseshifting transforms is analyzed by Fourier analysis and positive/negative sequence analysis. The experimental verification is accomplished on a prototype of the 12-pulse SCR rectifier.

Key words; multi-pulse SCR rectifier, harmonic elimination, line current THD.

Chapter 1 Introduction

Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) is a controllable semieonductor device widely used in high pow er conversion and control in industry. M odem SCRs are available with high voltage (up to 12 KV) and current (up to 5 KA) ratings, which have made the SCR a dom inant device in high pow er converters. High power ac-dc rectifiers, high power battery chargers, load commutated current source inverter powered m otor drives and high-voltage direct-current transmission systems are typical applications o f SCRs in industry [3,4].

The switching operation o f SCRs in a rectifier produces a series o f current harmonics, which could be transm itted into the power supply grid. The harm onics in the grid increase w ire and transform er losses, cause metering conflicts, and interfere with other equipment connected to the grid [5-7]. Therefore, they have to be restricted within a critical limit.

IEEE Standard 519-1992 defines harmonic limits for electrical pow er systems. Table 1-1 is extracted from the standard, which is applicable to six-pulse rectifier loads. For m ulti-pulse rectifier loads, the limits are increased by a factor o f ^fq /S under certain conditions [1], in which q is the pulse number o f the rectifier. However, since only ac voltages are available from the utility supply, rectifier equipment could be considered as dc pow er generator, converting ac to dc; hence based on Table 1-1, the Total Demand D istortion (TDD) generated by them should be limited within 5%.

Since TDD is expressed as a percentage o f the .maximum fundamental demand load current (15 or 30 minutes demand) measured after installation, it's not available at the design stage. The Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) based on the percentage o f the fundam ental rated load current then is calculated in the thesis to provide a reference for evaluating the rectifiers' side effect to the power grid in theory.

Where

7ic= maximum short-circuit current at PCC. li = maximum demand load current (fundamental frequency component) at PCC.

To meet the restriction of IEEE Standard 519-1992, many methods could be applied to eliminate or reduce harmonic currents generated by rectifiers. For example, (i) Using passive filters. Line reactors (inductors) are often used in conjunction with capacitors in a rectifier to filter specific harmonic currents. However, the cormection o f capacitors could cause resonance conditions that can magnify harmonic current at certain frequency to a harmful level [6-7]. (ii) Using certain switching techniques. Switching techniques, for instance the pulse width modulation technique, could be used to eliminate harmonic currents. In high power applications, the premise for using these techniques is that the switching devices must be the gate-turn-off type, such as GTOs or IGBTs [8-9]. (iii)Using multi-pulse rectifiers. Multi-pulse rectifiers are designed based on phaseshifting transformers, which enable certain harmonics to be cancelled from the rectifiers' line currents. This method is especially practical for harmonic elimination in high power applications [1-3,9,10].

This thesis provides full analysis o f multi-pulse SCR rectifiers for engineering reference, because they are widely used in industry and play an important role in harm onic eliminations.

This chapter begins with the introduction o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier, and then steps into m ulti-pulse SCR rectifiers, which overcome shortcomings o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier. The objective o f the thesis is also presented. At the end o f the chapter, the outline o f the thesis is provided.

1.1 In tro d u c tio n o f th e Six-pulse S C R R ectifier It is know n that the harmonic currents generated by the six-pulse SCR rectifier in steady state are non triplen odd harmonics - the 5**^, 7*'', ll'*' and 13^\ for example. From the spectrum analysis, the dominant low order harmonic currents have higher amplitudes and produce a high (>20%) line current THD, which does not meet the requirement o f IEEE Standard 519-1992. Therefore they have to be eliminated or decreased.

F ig. 1-1 Configuration o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier with two devices connected in series.

In the six-pulse SCR rectifier, it might be required to connect SCRs in series in large horsepow er applications to block high voltages, under which a single SCR caimot handle. V oltage sharing is the main problem o f the com ponent in-series connection. Fig. 1-1 shows the configuration o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier with two devices connected in series. The two SCRs, for instance SCRja and SCRjb, should be turned on (or turned off) sim ultaneously. I f not, the one turned on later (or turned o ff earlier) will undertake a

higher voltage and thus may be damaged. If more SCRs are required to be in series in high-voltage applications, the voltage-sharing problem becomes more critical, because the synchronized switching is more difficult to realize.

1.2 Introduction of Multi-pulse SCR Rectifiers
To eliminate harmonics from the line current of the six-pulse SCR rectifier, and to avoid in-series SCRs in high power applications, multi-pulse SCR rectifiers using phaseshifting transformers are developed. The 12-, 18- and 24-pulse SCR rectifiers are commonly applied in industry.

Fig. 1-2 shows the simplified diagram of the 12-pulse SCR rectifier, which consists of a phase-shifting transformer and two six-pulse SCR bridges that are connected in series on the dc side. Fig. l-2(a) shows the inductive load condition, for example load commutated current source inverter powered motor drives or high-voltage direct-current transmission systems. Fig. l-2(b) shows the capacitive load condition, such as high power battery chargers or dc motor drives.

Fig. 1-2

Simplified diagram o f the 12-Pulse SCR rectifier.

The main feature o f the 12-pulse SCR rectifier is that two SCR bridges are connected in series rather than two SCRs, thus the voltage sharing is avoided. As a result, the system becomes more reliable. Another advantage of the 12-pulse SCR rectifier is that the line

current THD is reduced substantially owing to the use o f the phase-shifting transformer. The details o f the harmonic elimination will be analyzed in Chapter 3.

For the 18-pulse SCR rectifier, a phase-shifting transformer with three secondary windings is connected to three six-pulse SCR bridges. Similarly, connecting a phaseshifting transform er with four secondary windings to four six-pulse bridges introduces the 24-pulse rectifier. Since more SCR bridges are connected in series to tolerate high voltages, and more low-order harmonics are eliminated from the line current, the 18- and 24-pulse SCR rectifiers are widely used in high power applications. For example, they could be applied as front ends o f high power motor drive systems.

1.3 Thesis Objectives
As m ulti-pulse SCR rectifiers overcome shortcomings o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier and play an im portant role in high power applications, the main objective o f the thesis is to analyze the perform ance o f multi-pulse SCR rectifiers. The study is focused on the line current THD, the input Power Factor (PF), and the harmonic elimination theory. To achieve this objective, m ain tasks are outlined as follows: · To use com puter simulation to investigate the performance o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier and multi-pulse SCR rectifiers with inductive and capacitive loads. · To com pare the performance o f the six-pulse rectifier and multi-pulse rectifiers by providing voltage and current waveforms under different load conditions. · To derive formulas for evaluating rectifiers' performance, such as the average load voltage and current, the RMS and THD o f the line current, as well as the input PF o f the rectifier. · To analyze the harmonic elimination theory by Fourier analysis and

positive/negative sequence analysis, respectively. · To obtain the line current THD and the input PF under different operating conditions by simulations. · To verify the perform ance o f the 12-pulse SCR rectifier experimentally.

Chapter 2 Six-pulse SCR Rectifier

The six-pulse SCR rectifier is a fundamental three-phase controllable ac-dc converter com posed o f six SCR devices. It is also the building block o f multi-pulse SCR rectifiers. For example, a 12-pulse SCR rectifier consists o f two six-pulse bridges, and the 18- and 24-pulse rectifiers include three and four six-pulse bridges, respectively. The line current Total Harm onic Distortion (THD) o f various rectifiers is o f great interest owing to the need o f com plying w ith the harmonic current requirement defined by IEEE Standard 5191992 and evaluating the rectifiers' side effect to the power supply grid. The efficiency o f the rectifier can be scaled by the param eter o f the input Power Factor (PF).

This chapter presents the performance o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier with inductive and capacitive loads. Voltage and current waveforms are provided to show the operation o f the rectifier. For the inductive load condition, the average load voltage and current under ideal and non-ideal circuit conditions are derived; the RMS and THD o f the line current are analyzed; the input PF is calculated. For the capacitive load condition, the line current THD and the input PF are discussed.

Ls represents the total line inductance between the power supply grid and the rectifier bridge, which includes the equivalent inductance of the power supply and the inductance o f a three-phase reactor that is often added to the system to reduce the line current THD.

L l is the dc choke, which is used to reduce the ripple component of the load current. For easy o f analysis, assume that the value of L l is infinite, and then the inductive load can be replaced by a dc current source Ii as shown in Fig. 2-1.

2.1.2 Circuit Operation with T$=0
The discussion o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier begins with the ideal circuit condition, under which the line inductance Ls is zero.

1) Load Voltage and Current
Since the gating pulses control the conduction o f the SCRs, the output voltage o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier relates to the so-called firing angle or delay angle a . Fig. 2-2 shows the load voltage waveforms at different as. Obviously, the bigger the a , the lower the line-to-line voltage will be.

where VL,avg is the average load voltage.

From equation (2.7), when the delay angle a is less than 90°, the average load voltage is positive. The energy is transferred from the source to the load. In this condition, the SCR rectifier is called operating in the rectification mode. When the delay angle a is greater than 90°, the average load voltage becomes negative. The energy is transferred from the load to the source. The rectifier is called working in the inverting mode.

2.1.3 Circuit Operation with 1 ^ 0 1) Commutation Interval and Corrected Load Voltage and Current
In Fig. 2-1, when the line inductance Ls is not zero, the SCRs in the rectifier will no longer turn on or turn off instantaneously. Instead, a commutation interval appears. Fig. 2-5 shows a part of the SCR rectifier circuit, in which commutation occurs between SCRi and SCR3. Fig. 2-6 shows the voltage and current waveforms with In Fig. 2-6(a),

due to the Ls, the current in SCRi reduces from It to zero gently and the current in SCR3 increases from zero to h gradually. Therefore, there exists a short commutation interval y.

2) The Line Current THD and the Input PF
From equation (2.12), we know that the line current is proportional to the load current. Therefore, the smaller the value of R (heavy load condition), the bigger the line current will be, and the more energy will be stored and released by Ls. Consequently, a longer commutation interval occurs. On the other hand, a larger Ls will extend the commutation interval as well. A longer commutation interval makes the amplitude of iai higher. As a result, the line current THD becomes lower. Fig. 2-7(a) shows the line current THD curves at different Ls values, in which the THD decreases as the Ls increases. Fig. 2-7(b) shows the THD curves at different as. It can be seen that with the same Ls, the THD increases when a increases.

Fig. 2-1 {c) shows the PF curves. From PF = DPF I -i\ + THD^ , we know that the PF is related to THD and DPF. At any fixed a , when the load current II decreases, the RMS

16

value o f ia decreases. As a result, the phase displacement < j> i decreases, the DPF (=cos^/) increases, and the PF increases.

2.2 Six-Pulse SCR Rectifier with Capacitive Loads 2.2.1 Circuit Configuration Fig. 2-8 shows the circuit configuration of the six-pulse SCR rectifier with a capacitive load. The capacitor C is used to stabilize the voltage across the load. When the value o f C reaches infinite, the capacitive load can be replaced by a dc voltage source with amplitude E. Ls is the line inductance, which avoids short circuit between the power supply and the dc voltage source. In practice, E could be the voltage on a capacitive filter, the back em f o f a dc motor, or the rated voltage of a rechargeable battery.

line current ia increases gradually and reaches to a peak, at which

then it begins to

decrease till reaches zero. As a result, two humps appear in the positive half cycle of 4The same phenomenon happens to the negative half cycle of ia as well. The load current z'i is the summation of the positive half cycle of the three line currents.

The value of E varies slightly with the loading conditions. Under light load conditions, E is close to the peak of vll, therefore the load current ii could be discontinuous. As the.load becomes heavier, a bigger current will be drawn, which causes a larger voltage drop across hence E decreases. As a result, the current waveform

becomes smoother. When the load increases to a certain level, the load current becomes continuous that indicates a continuous current operation mode of the SCR rectifier.

2.3 Summary
This chapter presents the performances of the six-pulse SCR rectifier with inductive and capacitive loads. The following conclusions can be made: · For the inductive load condition, the average load voltage is determined by the RMS value of the line-to-line supply voltage, the delay angle a, and the line inductance Ls. The Ls causes the commutation interval, which impacts the line current THD. The input PF is a function o f the THD and the DPF. · For the capacitive load condition, the line inductance Ls and the load current amplitude influence the THD and the DPF of the line current. The input PF can be calculated based on the THD and the DPF. · The line current THD of the six-pulse SCR rectifier with either the inductive or the capacitive load cannot meet the harmonic current requirement defined by IEEE Standard 519-1992.

Chapter 3 12-pulse SCR Rectifier

As discussed in Chapter 2, the six-pulse SCR rectifier has a high line current THD, w hich does not m eet the IEEE Standard 519-1992. Using m ulti-pulse (12-, 18- or 24pulse) SCR rectifiers, in which a phase-shifting transfom ier and a couple o f six-pulse SCR rectifiers (at least two) are applied, could eliminate or decrease low-order harmonics, so as to reduce the line current THD.

This chapter presents the performance o f the 12-pulse SCR rectifier w ith inductive and capacitive loads. The voltage and current waveforms are illustrated. Based on Fourier analysis and positive/negative sequence analysis, the principle o f the harmonic elim ination through the phase-shifting transform er is discussed. The line current THD and the input PF under different operating conditions are obtained by computer sim ulations.

3.1 12-PuIse SCR Rectifier with Inductive Loads 3.1.1 Circuit Configuration
Fig. 3 -1(a) shows the configuration o f the 12-pulse SCR rectifier w ith an inductive load. The rectifier is composed o f one phase-shifting transform er and tw o identical sixpulse SCR rectifiers, which are discussed in Chapter 2. The transform er has one wyeconnected prim ary winding (7),), and two secondary windings (Tsi and Ts2 ), feeding the tw o six-pulse SCR bridges. One o f the secondary winding is wye-connected and the other is delta-connected. The different connection o f the two windings results in a 30° phase displacem ent betw een their line-to-line voltages (wye-connection is leading). The dc outputs o f the tw o six-pulse bridges are cormected in series to supply a dc load. Fig. 31(b) show s the sim plified diagram, in which a dc current source h replaces the inductive load in Fig. 3 -1(a).

Since there is a 30° phase shift betw een the transform er secondary w indings' line-to-line voltages, vz, has twelve ripples in one supply voltage cycle. The peak-to-peak amplitude o f the ripple reaches the lowest, w hen the delay angle a is reduced to zero.

2) Positive/Negative Sequence Analysis In a balanced three-phase system, the voltage sequence is defined to be positive when the three phase voltages reach their peak amplitudes in the order of A, B, C, and if in the order o f A, C, B, the sequence is defined to be negative. Fig. 3-5 shows the phasor relation of the two kinds of voltage sequences. Similar definition applies to the three phase currents.

(a) positive sequence Fig. 3-5

(b) negative sequence

Positive and negative sequence three-phase voltage phasors.

For the three-phase positive sequence currents, we can write the equations as: I = 4 sin(ü)t), /,= /,, s in I 3 y (3.19) (3.20)

Hence the 5* order harmonic currents are negative sequence currents. Similarly, we can prove that the (5+6^:)**^ (A==0,l,2,...) order harmonics are negative sequence currents, and the (7+6Æ)* (A =0,l,2,...) order harmonics are positive sequence currents.

Passing through a phase-shifting transformer, if the positive sequence voltages or currents shift an angle 0 , the negative sequence voltages or eurrents will shift an angle - 0 . Fig. 3-6 shows an example o f the phase-shift condition o f the fundamental com ponent ( 7, ), one positive sequence component ( 7^ ) and one negative sequence com ponent ( 7j ) in a current. It can be seen that 7, and 7, are phase shifted in the same direction, but is shifted in the opposite direction.

3.1.4 The Line Current THD and the Input PF
U nder ideal circuit conditions, the THD o f the secondary and prim ary line currents o f the 12-pulse SC R rectifier can be calculated based on equations (3.16), (3.17) and (3.18): = ~h\ _ 7-^05 + h \\

It can be seen that the THD o f U reduces about 50% compared to that o f ias] and ias2 , ow ing to the elim ination o f harm onics in U-

Fig. 3-8(a) show s the harm onic content o f iasi and ias2 , where the 5`* ' and 7*^ order harm onics have quite high am plitudes (about 20% and 13%), and the THD o f iasi or ias2 is 28.73% . Fig. 3-8(b) shows the harmonic content o f U, in which the 5* and 7* order harm onics are zero and the THD is 12.89%. The THD values are slightly lower than the result presented in equations (3.28) and (3.29) due to the inductance effect.

3.2.2 Current Waveforms
A ssum ing no load is connected, the dc line-to-line voltage v l o output by the rectifier is as show n in Fig. 3 -1 1(a). The ripple frequency in v i o is twice that o f the six-pulse rectifier. W hen apply v l o to the capacitive load, as long as vi o is greater than E, and the related SCRs are triggered, the load current flows and causes energy exchanged through Ls- For each phase, the energy exchange happens for four times in every h alf cycle o f the supply voltage, thus there are four humps in each h alf cycle o f the line current as shown in Fig. 3 -11(b), in which iasi and ias2 are the line currents o f Tsi and Ts2 , respectively. Com pared to Fig. 2-10, the current ripple frequency is doubled. In Fig. 3-11(c), iasi ' and ias2 ' are iasi and ias2 reflected to the transform er primary side, and their summ ation is the transform er prim ary line current harm onics, such as the 5"' and o f iA is m ore like sinusoidal. i.e. iasi'+ias2 '- Since the dom inant low-order

Fig. 3-12 shows the waveform and harmonic spectrum of Iai = 1 pu (rated load condition) and Iai = 0.2 pu (light load condition), respectively. It can be seen that the Ia waveforms are quite different since the energy exchanged through Ls varies when the load current changes. The 5^'', 7 ^ * ', 17*'' and 19*'' order harmonics are zero in Ia owing to the phase-shifting transformer.

3.2.3 The Line Current THD and the Input PF
Fig. 3-13(a) and Fig. 3-13 (b) show the THD of Ïa and the input PF versus h i (from 0.1 pu to Ipu). The operating condition for Fig. 3-13(a) is a=0°, T/t=0.05pu, and T^=0, 0.05pu and O.lpu, respectively. As h i or Ls increases, the THD value decreases, and ranges from 21% to 7%, For Fig. 3-13(b), the operating condition is Lik= Tj=0.05pu, and a=20°, 40° and 60°, respectively. As a decreases, the THD value decreases, and ranges firom 41% to 13%. Compared to Fig. 2-11, it can be seen that the THD values are reduced substantially because of the elimination of dominant low-order harmonics.

34

In Fig. 3-13(c), a crossover occurs at approximately I ai = 0.22 pu. It's the boundary o f the continuous and discontinuous current operation mode. W hen Iai is greater than 0.22 pu, the load current will be operating in the continuous mode.

3.3 Summary This chapter presents the performance of the 12-pulse SCR rectifier with inductive and capacitive loads. The following eonclusions can be made: · The principle of the harmonic elimination through the phase-shifting transformer can be illustrated by Fourier analysis and the positive/negative sequence analysis. · For the inductive load condition, the ripple in the dc load voltage has a doubled frequency and reduced peak-to-peak amplitude compared to the six-pulse rectifier. The RMS value of the line current is lower than that of the six-pulse rectifier due to the harmonic elimination. · For both of the load conditions, the line current THD values are lower than those of the six-pulse rectifier, because the dominant low-order harmonics are eliminated. The input PF of the 12-pulse rectifier is improved. · The line eurrent THD of the 12-pulse SCR rectifier with either the inductive or the capacitive load still cannot meet the harmonic current requirement in IEEE Standard 519-1992.

Chapter 4 18-pulse SCR Rectifier

Since the line current THD o f the 12-pulse SCR rectifier does not m eet the harm onic current requirem ent in IEEE Standard 519-1992, it is required to elim inate more loworder harm onic currents. The 18-pulse SCR rectifier is an option to im prove the line current THD.

This chapter presents the perform ance o f the 18-pulse SCR rectifier w ith inductive and capacitive loads. The voltage and current waveform s are shown. The harm onic spectrum o f the line current and the reason o f harmonic elim ination are presented. The line current THD and the input PF are discussed.

4.1 18-Pulse SCR Rectifier with Inductive Loads 4.1.1 Circuit Configuration
Fig. 4-1 shows the sim plified diagram o f the 18-pulse SCR rectifier with an inductive load. The phase-shifting transform er in the rectifier has three secondary w indings {Tsi, Ts2 and Ts3 ), feeding three six-pulse SCR bridges. Different from the 30° phase shift in the 12-pulse rectifier, the phase shift betw een any two adjacent w indings in the 18-pulse rectifier is 20°, w hich is realized by m eans o f the zigzag-winding connection. The details o f the zigzag transform er will not be discussed in this thesis. As show n in Fig. 4-1, the phase displacem ent S o f the line-to-line voltages o f Tsi, Ts2 and TsS w ith respect to the line-to-line voltage o f the prim ary w inding Tp is 0°, -20° and -40°, respectively. Other arrangem ents for ô, such as -20°, 0° and 20°, are also possible. The turns ratio will be selected to m ake the line-to-line voltage o f each secondary w inding one third o f the lineto-line voltage o f the prim ary winding.

4.1.2 Voltage and C urrent Waveforms Fig. 4-2 shows the voltage and current waveforms of the 18-pulse SCR rectifier with inductive loads under the condition of a=30°, Iai =lpu, Ls =0 and Lik =0.05pu. From Fig. 4-2(c), it can be seen that the transformer secondary currents iasi, W and w are 20° phase shifted between any adjacent two. Fig. 4-2(b) shows the waveforms of iasi', W and iass', which are iasi, W and ias3 reflected to the transformer primary side. Their fundamental components are in phase. The shapes of w ' and ias3 ' are the result of the zigzag connections. The summation of iasi ', W ' and ias3 ' is the line current ix, which is shown in Fig. 4-1(a). Fig. 4-2(e) shows the harmonic content of ix, in which the 5*'', 7*, 11*'' and 13'" order harmonics are eliminated; thus the lowest order harmonic is the 17 and the THD is 7.45%.
>th th

In Fig. 4-2(d), vn, v u and v/j are output voltages of the three six-pulse SCR bridges respectively. Their waveforms are the same as that of the typical six-pulse bridge, but are 20° phase shifted. Their summation is the load voltage
vl,

in which the ripple frequency

is tripled compared to Vu, Vu and vu. Hence the 18-pulse rectifier requires a smaller dc choke to obtain a ripple free dc load current compared to the 12-pulse rectifier.

4.1.3 Analysis of Harmonic Elimination
It's convenient to use positive / negative sequence analysis to explain the reason of harmonic elimination in the 18-pulse rectifier. Since the fundamental component of w lags iasi by -20°, the 5'*' order harmonic of w lags the 5*'' order harmonic of w by 5 X(-20°) = -100°. After the two 5 * * ^ order harmonics being reflected to the transformer primary side, the phase displacement between them becomes -120°. Similarly it can be obtained that the phase displacement between the reflected 5^'' order harmonics of w and ias3 is -240°. Hence the phasor summation of the three reflected 5*'' order harmonics of the three secondary windings is zero in îa. The same condition happens to all harmonics in Ia, except the fundamental component and the (l8A:±l)'* order harmonics (^ 1 ,2 ,3 ...). Fig. 4-3 summarizes the phasor relation of the reflected harmonics being cancelled in the primary winding of the 18-pulse SCR rectifier.

4.1.4 The Line Current THD and the Input PF
Fig. 4-4 shows the line current THD and the input PF of the 18-pulse SCR rectifier versus Iai . Compared to the 12-pulse rectifier, the THD values of the 18-pulse rectifier are reduced, but the input PF is almost the same. When a=0° and /x/>0.5pu, the THD values are less than 5%, which satisfy the IEEE Standard 519-1992.

Chapter 5 24-pulse SCR Rectifier

In order to further reduce the line current THD and handle higher voltages, 24-pulse SCR rectifiers are employed. This chapter presents the perform ance o f the 24-pulse SCR rectifier w ith inductive and capacitive loads. The line current THD and the input PF o f the 24-pulse rectifier are discussed.

5.1 24-Pulse SCR Rectifier with Inductive Loads 5.1.1 Circuit Configuration
Fig. 5-1 shows the simplified diagram o f the 24-pulse SCR rectifier with an inductive load. The phase-shifting transform er in the diagram has four secondary windings, feeding four six-pulse SCR bridges. Different from the 20° phase-shifted zigzag windings in the 18-pulse rectifier, the transform er secondary windings in the 24-pulse rectifier are 15° phase shifted. As shown in Fig. 5-1, the phase displacem ent S o f the secondary line-toline voltages w ith respect to the prim ary line-to-line voltage are 0°, -15°, -30° and -45°. O ther arrangem ents, sueh as -15°, 0°, 15°, and 30°, are also practicable. The w inding turns ratios are selected to make the line-to-line voltage o f each secondary winding one forth o f the line-to-line voltage o f the prim ary winding.

5.1.2 Voltage and C urrent Waveforms Fig. 5-2 shows the voltage and current waveforms under the condition of a=30°, h i =lpu, Ls =0 and 1% =0.05pu. Fig. 5-2(c) shows the transformer secondary line currents iash ias2 , W and w , which are identical in waveforms, but are 15° phase shifted between each other. Reflecting these currents to the transformer primary side, we get z'asi' and iasi, which are shown in Fig. 5-2(b). The waveforms of w ' and w ' are caused by zigzag cormections. The line current îa= ' +w ' + w ' . From Fig. 5-2(e), it can

be seen that the 5*'^, 7*'', 11*'', 13"', 17*'' and 19*'' order harmonics are zero in h; thus the lowest order harmonic becomes the 23"^". As shown in Fig. 5-2(a), the waveform of îa is almost a sinusoid with 5.09% THD. In Fig. 5-2(d), the pulsated dc load voltage vl has a higher ripple frequency and a lower ripple amplitude, compared to that of the 18-pulse rectifier; therefore, a ripple free dc current can be obtained easier from the 24-pulse rectifier.

5.3 Summary
This chapter presents the performance of the 24-pulse SCR rectifier with inductive and capacitive loads. The following conclusions can be made: · · The principle of the harmonic elimination can be applied to the 24-pulse rectifier. For the two load conditions, since more low-order harmonics in the line current are eliminated, the line current THD of the 24-pulse rectifier is further reduced. Especially when the delay angle a=0°, the THD values meet the harmonic current requirement of IEEE Standard 519-1992. · For the capacitive load under heavy load conditions, the PF of the 24-pulse rectifier is slightly reduced, because the phase displacement of the line current caused by the line inductance and the transformer leakage inductance is slightly greater than that of the 12- or 18-pulse rectifier. · Multi-pulse SCR rectifiers with a higher pulse number, such as the 30- or 36-pulse, are rarely used in industry because of the high cost.

Chapter 7 Conclusions

M ulti-pulse SCR rectifiers are widely used in high power applications in industry due to their low line current Total Harm onic Distortion (THD) and high voltage capabilities. The m ain contribution o f the thesis is to analyze the performance o f the six-, 12-, 18- and 24-pulse SCR rectifiers with inductive and capacitive loads. The line current THD and the input Pow er Factor (PF) o f the rectifiers are investigated and the results are shown in graphics for engineering references. The principle o f the harmonic elim ination through the phase-shifting transform is analyzed by Fourier analysis and positive/negative sequence analysis. Experim ental verification is completed on a prototype o f the 12-pulse SCR rectifier.

A s a basic three-phase controllable ac-dc converter, the six-pulse SCR rectifier is seldom applied in high pow er applications because o f its high line current THD, low input PF and voltage sharing problem occurred when SCRs are connected in series. The draw backs o f the six-pulse SCR rectifier could be overcome by using m ulti-pulse SCR rectifiers, in w hich six-pulse rectifiers work as the building block. The benefit o f using m ulti-pulse SCR rectifiers includes: · The line current THD is reduced.

U nder the same operating condition, the larger the num ber o f pulses, the more the loworder harm onics can be eliminated, and the lower the line current THD is. For instance, the TH D o f the 18-pulse SCR rectifier is lower than that o f the 12-pulse rectifier.

·

The output dc ripple frequency in the multi-pulse rectifiers is increased and the ripple am plitude is decreased.

The dc ripple frequency o f the 12-, 18- and 24-pulse rectifiers is increased to two, three and four tim es o f that in the six-pulse rectifier, respectively. The peak-to-peak dc ripple am plitude decreases as the pulse num ber o f the rectifier increases. Therefore, it is easier to obtain a ripple free dc output in the rectifier with a larger pulse num ber.

65

·

The voltage sharing problem in the in-series SCRs is avoided.

When SCRs are connected in series to handle high voltages, simultaneous operating of the SCRs has to be ensured. In multi-pulse rectifiers, the SCR bridges are connected in series rather than SCRs, and hence the voltage sharing problem of the in-series SCRs is avoided. The larger the number of pulses, the more SCR bridges should be connected in series, and the higher voltage the rectifier can handle.

Using phase-shifting transformers in multi-pulse SCR rectifiers can cancel certain low-order harmonics from the rectifiers' line current. The principle of the harmonic elimination through phase-shifting transformers is analyzed by Fourier analysis and positive/negative sequence analysis. The harmonics that appear in the line current of multi-pulse rectifiers under normal operating conditions are the {kq ± 1) pulse number of the rectifier and A=1,2,3... where q is the

In order to verify the performance of the multi-pulse SCR rectifiers, a prototype of the 12-pulse SCR rectifier controlled by a microprocessor is designed and constructed. The experimental results show that the low-order harmonics, such as the and 7^, are

eliminated firom the line current of the 12-pulse SCR rectifier. As a result, its line current THD is reduced substantially compared to that of the six-pulse rectifier.
