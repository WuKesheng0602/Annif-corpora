ABSTRACT
Environmental Impact Assessment for Transportation Corridors using GIS
Master o f Engineering, 2005 By Iqbal Ahmed Department o f Civil Engineering Ryerson University

An environmental impact study is the significant part o f any transportation project development. In general environmental assessment is a process to find out the possible impact on environments due to the effects o f proposed initiatives before they are carried out. In transportation sector, construction o f new roads or highways m ay minimize congestion and reduce travel path and time but may also have an effect on environment. So it is necessary to develop the best alternative routes so that natural, cultural, social environmental impacts are minimized. In recent years geographic information systems (GIS) have become increasing popular for environmental studies. CIS can play a vital role for analysis and in formulating the quick mitigation plans for high-risk environments. This study is articulates what environmental impacts need to be assessed in transportation corridor planning, what geo spatial data are needed to support these identified impact assessment activities, and how and what GIS tools are required to facilitate the corresponding assessment activities. The M id-Peninsula Transportation Corridor (MPTC) planning project is analyzed as a case study.

INTRODUCTION

1.1

Overview

Environm ental Impact Assessment (EIA) is essentially an approach to conceiving, planning, desigmng, implementing and adjusting undertakings in a way that takes full account o f environmental factors including the socioeconomic and biophysical ones(Gibson, 2004). An environm ental impact study is the significant part o f any transportation project development. It is a process to find out the possible impact on enviromnents due to the effects o f proposed initiatives before they are carried out. In transportation sector, construction o f new road or highw ay m ay minimize congestion and reduce travel path and time but m ay also an effect on environment. So it is necessary to develop a system so that natural, cultural, social and environmental impacts are minimized. To determ ine EIA a lot o f information and spatial data about the studying objects and facilities should be collected and analyzed. The conventional way o f EIA study is a less accurate and m ore time consuming process because it has m ore dependant and independent variables, which have to be taken into account (e.g., land use, land price, population density, socio econom ic level, road accessibility, railway accessibility, air quality, ground water quality, noise level, biological content, historical value, archeological and visual importance), which also have different consequences. There needs to be a tool or support system, which can handle the larger volume o f spatial and non-spatial data and which is capable o f doing complex analysis and produce an alternative plan. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are the latest technologies and tools, which can produce much more accurate results quickly and effectively. GIS have been described as computer-assisted systems for the capture, storage, retrieval, analysis, and display of spatial data (Clarke, 1986). In this report the M id-Peninsula Transportation Corridor (M PTC) planning project is analyzed as a case study. In the context o f the Niagara Peninsula Transportation corridor, the application o f the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act (EAA) to the project was intended to ensure: " The betterm ent o f the people o f the whole or any part o f Ontario by providing for

the protection, conservation and wise management in Ontario o f the environm ent" . Here GIS is addressed and discussed as a m ethod which gives the power o f working with spatial inform ation to find best alternatives o f the M id-Peninsula Transportation Corridor from the four preset alternatives. 1.2 O bjective

Geographical Information System (GIS) provides an efficient technique for m anaging geographical information. Using GIS in road planning m ay significantly improve the result o f EIA. The EIA process will confirm the transportation problem s and opportunities, and develop and evaluate potential solutions. Environmental impact assessment o f the Niagara M id-Peninsula Transportation Corridor is taken as a case study o f this report and the main objectives are: · To introduce the concept o f GIS as a tool for outlining the significant environmental im pacts that can be caused by construction o f the transport corridor. · To develop a GIS based analysis system and present a comparison table o f the impacts from various alternative corridors to decision-makers and the public. 1.3 Scope and limitations

This study has demonstrated overlay techniques to assessments o f environmental impact from m any sources o f data. All analyses in the report are performed by applying GIS m ethod on the four preset alternatives o f the proposed Niagara M id-Peninsula Transportation Corridor to find out the best alternative. However the current situation is that MTO (M inistry o f Transportation, Ontario) yet has not finalized the preferred corridor. They will consult with the com m unity on the needs assessment study findings and complete an environmental assessment (federal and provincial) to determine the preferred route location for the Mid Peninsula Transportation Corridor. So result o f this study was not compared with the actual road corridor.

TRANSPORTATION PROJECT AND EIA

2.1

Introduction

Transportation networks play a vital role in contributing to the econom ic development o f nations and enhance the quality o f life o f its citizens; it has also been a m ajor contributor to the degradation o f the environment. W ith an ever increasing population, there is a constant demand for new highway infrastructure. W ith the emergence o f a m ore environm entally sound population there has been an increase in public awareness as to how and where these new highw ays are being located. This is because roads can have the negative effect o f fragm enting previously large patches o f habitat into smaller ones by creating a barrier to m ovem ent (Alexander, et al., 2000). The process o f environmental impact assessment was developed as an effective planning tool to improve, conserve and protect the environm ent due to transportation. In this report environmental impact associated with the M id-Peninsula Transportation Corridor has been discussed. MTO is undertaking the planning and environmental assessment study for the proposed MPTC. The EA Terms o f Reference is the first step in the formal EA process. If M CE approves the ToR, then the next step is the selection o f preferred route location. After EA is approved, MTO can designate the route, protect property and proceed with detail design and EA work required prior to construction o f the facility. The overall planning and EA process takes at least 8-10 years. The actual timing o f construction will be dependent on government priorities and the availability o f funding. The EA study to determine a preferred route and subsequent protection by the province is a key step in providing the required certainty for municipalities to proceed with land use planning as well as certainty for affected residents. A definite impact assessment for any o f such type o f development should be studied to safeguard the environment. Transportation planners, land use planners, transportation engineers, and environmental specialists m ust consider

environmental impacts when planning or designing a transportation project. It is important that these individuals understand why environmental planning is necessary, how the impact m ust be analyzed and what m ust be done to mitigate environmental impacts.

2.2

Needs Assessm ent

Conducting a needs assessment study constitutes the primary requirem ents o f transportation improvements. A needs assessment study involves an assessment o f future transportation problems, opportunities and transportation options within a broad analysis area. To conduct a needs assessm ent study represents the first phase o f M TO process to initiate the environmental assessment process for new transportation corridors. W hen the existing transportation network is not capable o f supporting the projected growth in population, employment, trade and tourism, it needs to be extended. For the M PTC the needs assessment study was a technical study, involving a comprehensive exam ination o f future transportation problems, opportunities and a range o f transportation alternatives including road, transit, rail, ferry and other options. Various travel and growth scenarios were considered for a 30-year planning period. The needs assessment study concluded that significant additional transportation capacity would be required through the N iagara Peninsula into the GTA to accommodate future growth in the m ovem ent o f people and goods. The needs for significant improvements to the transportation network are driven by several factors including population growth (and associated employm ent growth), trade growth, tourism growth, land use policies, and growing congestion in the existing transportation system. The needs assessment study proposed a broad multi-modal

"Transportation Development Strategy" to ensure adequate transportation network operations over the long term. The MPTC needs assessment was carried out by MTO as a separate planning and decision-making process in accordance with the following description contained in the class environmental assessment (MPTC needs assessment study, 2003). · · · To identify transportation problems and opportunities. To evaluate and select reasonable "alternatives to". To develop provincial transportation facility study objectives - "the purpose o f the undertaking". · · · · To accommodate future growth in the movement o f people and goods. To improve the international trade through the corridor. To improve tourism and travel. To im prove accessibility for tourism, industry and commerce.

· ·

To support economic growth at the provincial and municipal levels. To reduce traffie congestion and delay, aceidents, fuel eonsum ption and emissions on existing area road network.

· · ·

To defer rehabilitation requirements on existing local highways/roadways. To optim ize use o f existing rights-of-way/facilities. To reduce travel demand and optimize existing infrastructure through use o f

innovation/technologies such as Transportation Demand M anagem ent (TDM) and Transportation System Management (TSM). · To planning for existing and new transportation corridors to m inim ize impacts associated with adjacent highway development. · To pertaining population and employment growth, trade growth, tourism growth, land use policies and projected traffic congestion in relation to the need for the corridor. 2.3 Environm ental Impact Assessm ent (EIA)

EIA is defined as the systematic identification and evaluation o f the potential impacts (effects) o f proposed projects, plans, programs or legislative actions relative to the physieal, chemical, biological, cultural and socio-economic components o f the environment (Canter, 1996). As a planning tool, environmental assessment is used to identify and ensure that the potential environmental effects o f projects receive careful consideration before they are undertaken. Failure to consider the adverse environmental effects o f projects can lead to environmental degradation, damages to human health, and increased econom ic cost. Environmental assessment is a critical tool for sustainable development given the potential for irreversible damages to the environment that can result from human activities. It provides decision makers w ith the m eans to obtain the information they need to make balanced and informed decisions to sustain a healthy environment and strong economy for present and future generations. Nowadays, the EIA is needed to ensure the protection o f the environment and the natural resources from any unexpected side effects, which may be occurred during the process o f the projects. Simply, EIA is a study o f the effects o f a proposed action on the environment, where the term environm ent includes all aspects o f the natural and hum an effect (El-Raey, 2003). In Canada, converging social, economic and environmental agendas are becom ing

increasingly evident. Canadians can design better projects and policies that balance and

integrate society's environmental goals with its economic goals, social goals and cultural values. Sustainable development is a fundamental aspect o f the environmental assessment process. Best-practice EIA identifies environmental risks, lessens conflicts by prom oting community participation, minim izes adverse environmental effects, informs decision-makers, and helps lay the base for environmentally-sound projects. As a planning and decision-making tool, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act has helped to achieve sustainable development through the prom otion o f sound economic development that conserves and enhances environmental quality. The transport policy established by the government has put more weight on environm entally friendly operations o f the road transport sector. Over the past num ber o f years, the M inistry o f Transportation, Ontario (MTO) has undertaken a significant amount o f technical, forecasting and strategic planning work in the Niagara, Hamilton and Halton areas. MTO has commenced the formal environmental assessment process for the Niagara to GTA corridor for the environm entally friendly operations o f the road transport sector. It should contribute to preservation, protection and improvement o f the environment, protection o f public health, and the conservation o f natural resources. In order to reach these requirements environmental impact assessm ent in the process o f road planning has to be integrated. History o f EIA During the decade o f the 1960's, the growing concern for environmental quality put considerable pressure on the planning process and its ability to adapt to change (Looijen, 2000). The originated year o f EIA practice in some develop countries are given below. · · · EIA was first introduced in the USA. Canada followed in 1974. China started in 1980. The EIA law o f China was prom ulgated in 2002 which provides that EIA is required in regional and sector plans and programs. · · Netherlands in 1987. European Com mission in 1988 introduced a set o f guideline on EIA dictating m em ber countries to incorporate the guidelines in national legislation.

Objective o f EIA Environm ental assessment should be conducted as early as possible in the planning and proposal stages o f a project for the analysis to be valuable to decision m akers and to incorporate the m itigative m easures into the proposed plans. Tim ely and efficient environmental assessments result in m ore informed decisions-m aking that support sustainable developments. The environmental impact assessment should have the following objectives. · A pply to all projects that are expected to have a significant environmental impact and predict environmental impact o f projects, · Compare alternatives to a proposed project and find ways and m eans to reduce adverse im pacts , · · Shape project to suit local environm ent, and M onitor and feedback procedures.

Principles and Characteristics o f EIA The engineering project may have negative effect on the environment. Therefore, the effect o f any project on the existing physical environmental should be predicted with degree o f reliability and high accuracy. EIA provide decision-makers with analysis o f the total environment so that decisions can be made based on as nearly complete and balanced information as possible. Based on the scale and significance o f potential impacts, EIA can be determined by four principles and eight main characteristics. These principles are summarized as Participation, Transparency, Certainty, Accountability, Credibility, Cost effectiveness, Flexibility and Practicality. The characteristics are magnitude (extension o f impact-m easurable quantity), importance or significance (social value), higher order and cumulative effects, reversibility and irreversibility, duration, remedial measures and risks and uncertainty o f occurrence (Gramangis, 1981).

M ain Steps o f EIA M any im portant steps help to identify possible environmental effects and mitigative measures. The process o f EIA varies w ith laws and local practices prevalent in each country. Generic steps and public participation that should be included in each (Sm ith and W ansem, 1995) are discussed below. It is imperative to understand the interlinkages and dynamics between various activities and direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on physical and social environments to evaluate the impacts and to provide mitigation measures. The key steps in preparing the environmental assessment include: Identifying significant study area features. Identifying route alternatives. R efining route alternatives. A ssessing potential environmental effects. Evaluating route alternatives and selecting a preferred route alternative. Exam ining concept design alternatives and selecting the preferred concept. D eveloping m itigation measures. Consulting with regulatory agencies, municipalities, and the public (including potentially affected property owners and interest groups). EIA Process As a decision-m aking tool, EIA is heavily influenced by the nature and structure o f the local planning process. But in spite of the differences in the planning process, the EIA process can be generalized and divided into following stages: a) Screening- A screening is a systematic approach to document the environmental effects o f a proposed project and determine the need to eliminate or m inim ize (mitigate) the adverse effects, to m odify the project plan, or to recommend further assessment through mediation or an assessment by a review panel. The responsible authority m ust ensure that the screening o f the project is carried out. In the screening stage, the EIA agency consults the proponent, other agencies and public participants to determine the requirements o f further studies. At this stage, the EIA agency determines whether the project m ay proceed as planned or if it needs to be subjected to an initial or complete EIA.

Screenings will vary in time, length and depth o f analysis, depending on the circumstances o f the proposed project, the existing environment, and the likely environmental effects. Some screenings m ay require only a brief analysis o f the available information and a brief report; others m ay need new background studies and will be more thorough and rigorous. b) Com prehensive study- The m ajority o f federal projects is assessed through a screening; however, some projects require a comprehensive study. These tend to be large projects having the potential for significant adverse environmental effects. They m ay also generate public concerns. Early in the eomprehensive study, the M inister o f the Environment has to decide w hether the project should continue to be assessed as a comprehensive study, or w hether it should be referred to a mediator or review panel c) Scoping- Determ ining the scope o f environmental issues to be scrutinized in the EIA and defining the scope for each issue. The scoping stage, often m erged with screening, deals with a m ore detailed plan o f study for the project to identify major concerns and key impacts, and to decide assessment methods and models to be used. Agencies and public representatives concerned with the project or the project area are consulted. d) Impact assessment - Assessment o f each topic selected in the scoping stage. This step takes up m ost o f the EIA time and resources. For each topic, the current status is delineated, and the predicted im pacts are forecast by means o f models. In the cases where adverse impacts are identified, m itigation measures are proposed. e) EIA preparation - At the end o f the impact evaluation, a document EIA is prepared. This document is passed on to the competent authority. Usually, after the authority makes its decision on the proposed project, the public can inspect the EIA and in m any countries can resort to the courts. Hence, the EIA is a legal document. f) Alternative evaluation criteria- It will generally include a m ixture o f legally-mandated criteria, technical/scientific criteria and social acceptability criteria. Alternate sites and design process should be critically examined to maximize the positive environmental impacts, socio economic benefits, and profitability, and minimize the tem porary adverse impacts.

10

g) Post project analysis (PPA) - In some countries, the environmental authorities continue to follow the proposed project in order to check that the project initiator is following the orders o f the com petent authority and also to improve the EIA system as an ongoing process. A n overall fram ework of EIA process for planning and conducting environmental study is shown in a flow chart in Figure 1.

The M ain A ctors in EIA Several stakeholders are involved in the EIA process and this m ay very according to country and institutional framework (Looijen, 2000). The first actor is the proponent that proposes an activity, policy, plan program or project. The main actors in the EIA process is shown in Figure 2 and described below. Decision m akers-A decision-maker is the body or person responsible for deciding on the proposed project, whether a project shall proceed or not, or proceed subject to condition and constraints (Gilpin, 1995). In order to identify the decision-maker in EIA there should be a clear identification o f the responsibilities and organizational structure o f the particular agency involved in an EIA and a clear determination where decision for the type and scale o f project under consideration are made (Kreske, 1996). It is thought that the decision-maker concerning the EIA differs according to the proposals size, its objective, and the country institutional structure. The public and NGOs -Every person can participate in giving his/her opinion on the guidelines and EIA. It is thought that public participation differs greatly from one place to another place, when a corridor is proposed for connecting remote place to greater area,

m akes the congestion at connecting area, so naturally public opinion differs o f these places. The public participation is when the project had been proposed and it should continue upto and during the construction and operation period. Consultation group-A team o f specialists was assembled from various disciplines as natural sciences, socio-economics, acoustics, vibration, air quality, archaeology, heritage,

waste/contam ination, drainage, stormwater management and geotechnical. They are working in technical and environmental research units and carrying out the actual environmental impact study including producing an environmental impact study and preparing a report o f the assessment for the decision makers.

The Potential Environmental Effects for MPTC

It is difficult to comment on the specific environmental impacts associated with a MPTC at the Terms o f Reference stage, as a preferred route location alternative has not been selected. A team o f specialists was assembled from various disciplines as natural sciences, socio economics, acoustics, vibration, air quality, archaeology, heritage, waste/contam ination, drainage, storm water management and geotechnical to aid in the preparation o f this EA Terms o f Reference. These specialists were instrumental in the preparation o f documentation, the administration o f the study process, the research and consideration o f secondary source information, and the consultation with government agencies. However, the specialists from the disciplines noted above have a good understanding o f the existing environmental conditions (based on their experience and secondary source research) and the further study required to generate route alternatives, assess the impacts o f route alternatives and complete the evaluation that will lead to a preferred route. The work plans outline objectives for generating routes to minimize adverse environmental impacts, describe how impacts associated w ith route alternatives will be assessed, and outline the specific studies and field work that will be undertaken to assess impacts and develop m itigation measures. This understanding is clearly documented in a series o f environmental and technical work plans and given below. N atural Environm ent · · e M inim ize the number of water crossings.

· 2.5

Road projects occur over long distances that typically cross through a num ber o f different environmental conditions. Identification and avoidance o f environmental impacts is

principally achieved through the constraints and route selection stages. Road planning and design is an iterative process where the planning and design evolve in response to environmental and other considerations. This ensures that environmental considerations become an integral part o f the overall route corridor selection and road scheme planning and design process. The very important things at early stages o f planning is selection o f alternative routes and establish the criteria for comparing and choosing between alternatives and choice o f the preferred route. The avoidance o f impacts through the early consideration o f alternatives may

16

be the m ost important and effective environmental mitigation strategy. Introduced at an early stage o f the planning process, EIA provides the knowledge about the risk to the environment from planning facility, and its operation is obtained adequately and continuously. By describing the impacts o f the various alternatives and comparing them with a "do nothing alternative" (the situation when the project is not implemented), it is possible to m ake the choice o f the final road corridor and later, final road profile more objective. This also means that the solutions can be designed in such ways that negative impacts are limited and positive. It m ight be relevant to underline that EIA comprises not only environmental/ecological impacts but equally covers social and national economic impacts. 2.6 EIA at Different Stages of Road Planning

EIA can be done at all stages o f road planning. Depending on the planning stage and the type o f decision that is to be made, EIA can have different tasks and focuses on different issues. EIA at System Level At the system level EIA provides an impact assessment for the entire road and transport system and concentrates on impacts that are important in achievement o f long-term environmental goals. It evaluates how the project and proposed road measures correspond with national and regional environmental goals and takes up questions that are o f importance to the environmental adaptation of the entire road transport system, including coordination with other types o f transport (Vagverket, 1995). Finally, EIA makes an overall assessment o f the whole project and contribute to the decision weather or not the project is feasible from the environmental point o f view. At this stage it is being determined which direction is to be taken in the EIA work, which types o f impacts should be included, and which aspects in EIA should get the first and the second priority. Among other aspects, EIA gives an overall assessment o f the following consequences: · · Com munication interests come into conflict with other public interests, W hat im pacts (for example, water and air pollution and deterioration o f living condition) are expected for those who live in the area affected by the road planning, risk o f creating conflict with strong preservation and recreation interests, and · The effect on the land-use structure and land-use planning.

17

EIA at P roject Level At the project level, EIA provides input data for the decisions on where a possible new corridor can be located, how sections o f the road should be designed with a m inimum impact on the environm ent and which environmental measures have to be taken. EIA is included in all stages o f road planning at this level. In the initial study the role o f EIA is to give a general assessment o f what the potential impacts from alternative solutions are and to assist in selecting those solutions that will be submitted for consideration in the next stage. EIA is also needed to define the possibilities and lim itations o f the project regarding its environmental adaptation, so it would be possible to set up the priorities and specify which environmental aspects are o f m ost importance. EIA makes an evaluation on how the project from environmental point o f view concurs with the direction and the goals o f the strategic planning. At the same time EIA work in further stages gets scopes and direction. In the feasibility study EIA contributes to the comparison o f alternative corridors and serves as a basis for weighing up which alternative should later be a subject o f detailed design (Vagverket, 1995). The comparison is made on the basis o f information about impacts from different alternatives with technical and economic evaluation o f protection m easures that are needed in each case. EIA is also important when considering the public interests in decision-making. During the generation and evaluation o f alternatives, various routes will have common points where routes intersect. In such cases, an analysis will be undertaken to determine preferred routes for portions o f the study area rather than comprehensively examining all combinations o f routes for the entire corridor. For example, alternatives betw een common points "A" and "B" would be compared to select a preferred alternative route for that segment o f the corridor prior to assessing alternatives beyond comm on point "B" (see Figure 3).

In the road design, EIA is necessary while making the choice o f the road profile. It provides a detailed study o f the impact assessment from construction and operation o f the finally chosen road profile and indicates the needs for the environmental adaptation and protection measures.

USE OF GIS FOR EIA

3.1

Introduction

A Geographical Information System is a computer-based tool for handling spatial data and can play a vital role for analysis and in formulating the quick mitigation plans for high risk environments. GIS is a powerful tool for environmental data analysis and planning. GIS stores spatial information and data, which can be overlaid with data or other layers o f information into a m ap in order to view spatial information and relationships. GIS allows better viewing and understanding o f physical features and the relationships that influence in a given critical environmental condition. It can serve as the ultimate communication o f environmental information to the public and policy makers since it is the technical basis for the multimedia approach in environmental decision-making. The evolution o f spatial data standards, the Internet and the next generation o f GIS technology allow all types o f users to access the environmental information in its proper spatial context. In recent years two important developments have helped in reducing the complexity o f spatial analysis. In the last decade, due to the evolution o f computer technology, and especially their graphic capabilities. In addition the availability and quality o f digital spatial data sets have improved, to the level where they are now adequate for routine analysis (Batty, 1993). Both governmental and non-govemmental institutions are adopting GIS technology as spatial data become m ore widely available. Many sources o f data are now available on the W orld W ide W eb for little or no cost. In addition, while GIS still requires some special training, the technology is becom ing considerably more user-friendly. For example, Internet M apping Servers (IMS) offer a way to provide mapping capabilities to the public in a way that involves little or no training and does not require each user to own expensive GIS software. As a result o f these innovations to make GIS more user-friendly and accessible, increasing numbers o f institutions are developing their own spatial data and GIS applications tailored to meet local needs. GIS has a capacity to provide a very flexible system for gathering data from m any sources in a variety o f formats. Moreover, it has a capability to transform analog data into digital form. GIS can easily integrate in one system several data types, such as maps, images, digital products. Global Positioning System (GPS) data, text and tabular data. These and other

20

types o f data are combined and integrated into GIS in the form o f a database, a program or system that provides an effective storage and management o f data. Database allows to keep track o f data and to hold it conveniently for use (Devis, 1996). W hile working with data a lot o f technical problems can appear, for example: to be able to use geographical data in different scales, or to set geographical boundaries for the area o f study, or to adjust data to a particular task. On com pletion o f data analysis GIS helps in planning and m anaging the environmental hazards and risks. In order to plan and monitor the environmental problems, the assessment o f hazards and risks becomes the foundation for planning decisions and for mitigation activities. GIS supports activities in EIA monitoring and mitigation and can also be used for generating environmental models. EIA is becom ing m ore and more extensively used in the world. EIA is an aid system to decision-making and to the minimization or elimination o f environmental impacts at an early planning stage. The EIA process is potentially a basis for negotiations between the developer, public interest groups and the planning regulator. Therefore, an EIA has to be started before project initiation. EIA is a management tool for officials and managers who m ake important decisions about m ajor development projects (Hossein, 2004). As a rule, EIA is applied for physical objects or facilities that can be located on the ground and hence, can be described by geographical coordinates. In order to perform EIA a lot o f information about the studying objects and facilities should be collected and analysed. M ost o f such information has geographical references, i.e., can be connected to a certain point (object, facility) on the ground. The need to process a lot o f spatial data and information quickly and effectively makes the adoption o f GIS for the needs o f EIA almost inevitable. Accepting GIS as a means o f using spatial data can have m any advantages over traditional methods while m aking use o f spatial data. Spatial data used in EIA is coming from different sources, in different forms (both digital and analog) and in different formats (i.e., digital). This creates problems when working with a large amount o f data, especially when it should be integrated or compared. Another problem is storage o f data; since there are a lot o f people working with the same data, it should be well organized, quickly accessible and easy to exchange. Besides this, m ore and m ore digital data

21

are being used, which creates a need o f a computer system that can accept, convert and m anage large amounts o f digital data. GIS technology offers many tools for manipulating spatial data; among others is a possibility to store data in different thematic layers, which gives a user the pow er to combine different information layers according to the EIA need. W hen operating with GIS functions the user can very easy define the locations o f spatial features and make m easurements o f different types o f spatial parameters, such as distance, perimeter, area and size. GIS allows m aking use o f data m ore efficiently by offering possibilities to m anipulate data to produce new information. Among various tasks o f EIA is to be able to give forecasts o f possible consequences that the project can have on the environment. In this case, GIS can provide its user with numerous tools for analyzing geographical data and revealing trends and patterns when m aking different scenarios. W hen the results o f EIA are presented for public and authorities, they should be in short but informative form instead o f bulky reports. GIS technology gives good outcomes when used to visualize information. Possibility to display information in form o f maps in combination with graphs, tables and texts has proved to be the most efficient way to present geographical information. 3.2 T h e In teg ra tio n of GIS into E IA

EIA is decision processes, which aims to both identify and anticipate impacts on the natural environment. The interface between these two components produces several effects, which will generate specific impacts. The environmental systems include spatial data relevant to the decisions, analytic tools to process the data in ways meaningful for decision makers, and out put or display functions. An EIA can be defined as the evaluation o f the effects likely to arise from a m ajor project, or other action, significantly affecting the natural and man-made environm ent (W ood, 2003). One o f the shortcomings o f the EIA process is that it lacks a spatial dimension which is important in determining impacts accurately (Antunes, et al., 2001). Another gap in knowledge is that in the past there have been very few projects which incorporated ecological, social and engineering variables. For example, a study by Antunes et al., exam ined ecological variables involved in sighting a highway, but failed to incorporate social and engineering variables. In another study by Sadek, et al. (2000) integrated

22

ecological and engineering principles into their highway analysis; however their analysis still lacked social variables. W ith the integration o f GIS into the impact assessment process, problems such as the lack o f a spatial dimension will be removed from the process. The ability to integrate information and support decision-making is the true power o f a GIS. Fetch (1993) explained on geography in decision-making that there are certain management decisions for which spatial information, analysis and cognition are essential and that the use o f m aps influences how we look at or conceive things and therefore what we decide. Although subjectivity will never be completely removed from this process, the use o f GIS will m ake the im pact assessment process m uch more objective (Antunes, et al., 2001). This is

only true if the correct variables are used and weighted accordingly. The other significant uses o f GIS in impact assessment are namely for data management, overlay and analysis, trend analysis, as sources of data sets for mathematical impact models, habitat and aesthetic analysis, and public consultation (Antunes, et al., 2001). GIS has also been combined with other specialized systems in order to determine environmental impacts such as air pollution. For example, air pollution is a complex problem as air flow m odeling must also be combined into the GIS. M ost standard GIS systems are not capable o f calculating this air pollution factor and specialized GIS systems must be designed (Rebolj and Sturm, 1999). In 1972 a computerized version of the technique was used for pow er lines and roads (Munn, 1975). It is noteworthy that the so called "first GIS" (Canada GIS) was used for EIA in the late 1970's for the preparation o f environmental impact studies for a dam on the river Thames. GIS offers a special environment for dealing with the spatial properties o f a project. Those special attributes o f the GIS are very important for the analysis o f environmental issues, since m ost o f them are spatial by nature, and no other computerised system can handle them properly (Schaller, 1990). However, the use of GIS in EIA process in general, and for scoping in particular has been limited, due in part to their cost in tenns o f time and money relative to the time and budgets allocated for EIA preparation, and especially for scoping. GIS will bring to the EIA process a new way o f analyzing and manipulating spatial objects and an improved way o f communicating the results o f the analysis, which can be o f great importance to the public participation process. GIS represent the m ost suitable way to deal, represent and analyze these data sets. Figure 4 show that how GIS can be employed within the

23

EIA process to improve different features, mainly related to data storage and access, to the analytical capabilities and to the communicability o f the results to decision makers.

Geographical information systems can be applied at all EIA stages. This utilization does not m ake use o f the key advantage o f GIS for EIA, its ability to perform spatial analysis and m odeling (Joao and Fonseca, 1996). The development o f such a system will allow a more realistic approach to the environmental descriptors and a better understanding o f their interrelationships. Erickson (1994) identified four m ethodologies associated with impact assessment, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. As such, it might be useless searching for an ideal technique. A more realistic approach is to identify the relative merits o f

24

these alternatives. This way, a combination o f techniques can be chosen to m eet the needs o f a particular problem. The four methodologies are; 1) Overlay 2) Checklist 3) M atrix 4) Network The overlay method o f impact assessment requires physical or computerized overlays o f individual m aps o f social and physical attributes o f the project area. The data it uses include topological data, air dispersal patterns, land and resource use data, wildlife, surface and ground w ater intakes. Such data m ay be obtained from aerial photography and satellite remote sensing. This m ethod thrives on graphical display o f data, but it is limited in that it lacks analytical capabilities. GIS is the ultimate tool for overlay the environmental data. The checklist method can be a very simple or complex list o f environmental components, attributes and processes, which are categorized under disciplinary headings such as geology, vegetation and air. GIS provides a computer platform for organizing, storing and analyzing these checklists. The m atrix method, which is a modification o f checklist, facilitates related specific project activities to specific types of impacts. Matrices are found necessary because they emphasize only direct impacts. It forces consideration o f impact o f each aspect o f a proposal for a range o f environmental concerns and it considers both the magnitude and importance o f impacts. Again, GIS provides a powerful tool for organizing, analyzing and storing matrices. Lastly, the network methodology defines a network o f possible impacts that may be triggered by project activities and that require the analyst to trace out project actions and direct and indirect consequences. Using the network method, direct, secondary, and tertiary and other higher order impacts o f action may be well traced out. This method cuts across disciplinary lines and it forces the identification o f site-specific factors and conditions necessary for the establishm ent o f a proposed cause-effect relationship. This technique however requires that the analyst be knowledgeable in the various types o f environmental components and dynamics. On a GIS platform, the analyst is further aided as large volumes o f data can be better analyzed in a short while.
25

GIS is an excellent tool to assist decision-makers, but also the public in (spatial) planning (visual illustration o f environmental data interpretation). During the planning o f a particular development, several technological, economical and environmental criteria must be fulfilled before the physical work can begin. In this process spatial analysis with the help o f a GIS is a huge benefit. W hen planning to select any location with minimal impact to the environment, the evaluation o f alternatives is an integral component o f the best location. W eighting scenarios is used for this evaluation component. Generally, m ore weight is assigned to those features, which are felt to be more important in assessing impacts generated by alternatives, and less weight is given to those features, which are considered to be less important. The totals for each alternative are compared to determine the preferred alternative. Recent surveys o f the use o f GIS in EIA found that while GIS is widely utilised, its use is largely limited to the basic GIS functions such as map production, classic overlay or buffering (Joao, 1996), the overlay analysis is made much more powerful through the use o f GIS (Smith, 1993). Antunes, et al., (1996) used GIS as integrating framework for impact prediction and evaluation for decision support. The case study o f this report presented a GIS based m ap overlay m ethod to analyze and present the impacts due to MPTC on the surrounding environment. GIS applications in EIA In EIA m any environmental factors are o f spatial in nature, so Geographic Information System can have a wide used in all EIA stages which include (Rodriguez-Bachiller, 1995): Terrain use for slope and drainage analysis. Land-resource information systems for land management. Soil information for soil studies. Geoscientific modelling o f geological formations. Disaster planning related to geographically localized catastrophes. Analysis o f irrigation suitability. Contam ination and pollution monitoring. Flood studies. Determine preferred alternative route. Linking environmental databases. Constructing global databases for environmental modelling.

Overview of Cases

This section is providing an overview o f the development o f GIS applications in world. The cases below present information on the challenges and solution o f the environmental problems. Since the early 1990s, the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Departm ent (AHTD) has been developing GIS applications to support the analysis o f alternative project alignments, with a growing degree o f internal staff and consultant expertise and comfort with the technology. Through this incremental growth, AHTD recognized that GIS could help determine project impacts for ElSs in a more efficient manner. In A H TD 's view, the technology could provide a quick, accurate, and precise instrument for the generation o f maps detailing the environmental constraints for multiple alternative alignments for a proposed project. A H TD 's GIS on the 1-69 SE-Connector was to foster early coordination with resource agencies, the public and Native American tribes while efficiently addressing the requirements o f the environmental review process. AHTD delineated two-mile wide preferred corridors, each w ith 300-foot alignments. GIS coverages containing environmental constraint data were overlaid on each o f the preferred corridors, allowing for quick and thorough identification o f draft EIS alternatives. The GlS-generated maps and analyses provided partnering agencies and communities tangible examples o f how various project alternatives would impact environmental, cultural, and economic resources. Partnering agencies supported GIS use because project steps occurred more quickly. The public especially welcomed the GIS and appreciated the map visualizations. AHTD noted that public participants were eager to learn how the project would affect their neighborhoods, properties, and houses. By providing this information, AHTD was able to gamer quick public response on the subtle differences o f proposed alternatives. Since 1996, the M innesota Department o f Transportation (Mn/DOT) has been developing an archaeological predictive model, Mn/Model (see Figure 5), to avoid impacts to archaeological sites throughout Minnesota. An archaeological predictive model is a tool that indicates the probability o f encountering an archaeological site anywhere within a given area. Using these models, construction projects can be modified to avoid areas where archaeological sites are likely to be present. The goal o f Mn/Model is to be accurate enough to predict 85 percent o f

27

known archaeological sites without designating more than 33 percent o f the State's area as high or m edium site probability. MnDOT used GIS and statistical analysis to produce the current archaeological predictive model so that it could be replicated by anyone using the same data and following the same procedures.

The project, entitled "GIS-Based Cumulative Effects Assessm ent" (Study No: 34.65) has been conducted by the University o f Colorado Geographic Information Systems Programs, faculty and staff over a 2-year period, from April 2002 through March 2004. The report describes the development and application of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) databases and analysis models for cumulative effects assessment resulting from growth associated with transportation infrastructure. A spatial environmental database was collected from various sources for a 53 km by 97 km (33 mi. by 60 mi.) region bounding 1-25 from Denver to near the Colorado-W yoming border. This report demonstrates several ways that GIS can be used as a tool for performing Cumulative Effects Assessm ents (CEA). It presents
28

four environmental assessments which use GIS. The first two, a habitat suitability study and a land use change analysis, demonstrate commonly used GIS overlay and distance techniques; the rem aining two use less common and more complex technologies. The third study links a spatial database with commonly used flood design procedures to m easure hydrologie impacts due to land use change. The final study uses a number o f techniques for growth modeling. The project, entitled "Remote Sensing Applications for Environmental Analysis in

Transportation Planning: Application to the Washington State 1-405 C om dor at Oakridge" by Xiong, D., et. al (2002) create maps of overlays o f land use and land cover (LULC), transportation networks and population distributions and generate statistics that serve as indicators o f environmental impact for the proposed road infrastructure. The report, entitled "Application o f GIS in the Environmental Impact Assessment o f Sabalan Geothermal Field, NW -Iran" by Hossein (2004) presented EIA for a geothermal project on the western plains o f Sabalan, in the province o f Ardabil in Northwest Iran. The study area is a catchm ent o f Khiav River and its area is about 132 km2. The work carried out o f the possible environmental effects o f this proposed project as a precursor to an EIA. The main objective was identifying the likely key impacts o f geothermal exploration, drilling, and operation, and to suggest potential mitigating measures. Assessm ent o f positive and negative environmental effects o f the construction o f a geothermal power plant is carried out using a check list and the ArcGIS 9 software. 3.4 GIS Data

The data collected on the study area will assist in identifying the types o f impacts on each route alternative and each component o f the environment. Data include mainly spatial and nonspatial. The spatial data is characterized as point, lines and polygons. Other GIS spatial data are handled as images, or rasters, having simple row and column formats. Attribute data are handled in relational database software comprised o f records and fields, and the power o f the relational model is applied for these data. The type o f data necessary for an EIA varies with respect to geographical location and nature o f the activity. The GIS system contains several themes that are relevant for m ost EIA studies, such as topography, bathymetry, settlements and population centers, infrastructure, lakes and

29

rivers, land cover and use. Information on biological resources such as birds, fish, m am m als and invertebrates are included where relevant. Also contaminant data, when available, are often included to give an impression o f the state o f the environment. In highw ay projects where EIA is required for environmental planning and m onitoring, there is a need for a practical way to collect the data, and also a need for practical m ethods o f retrieving and storing the gathered information. Finding tools for com parative studies o f different types o f spatial data is also desirable (Stromquist and Larsson, 1994). In this respect, GIS is a tool that might be well suited. In all environmental issues there is a spatial component and where m ost EIA is concerned, there is a wide range o f data to be handled. Environm ental spatial data include hydrographic data (i.e., rivers, creeks and lakes), vegetation (i.e., orchard, wooded area and tree), wetland, w ater or air quality and natural hazards such as flooding, landslides, mud slides, rock slides, earthquake faults and liquefaction hazards. Data commonly used to support environmental analysis include transportation systems, cadastral data, political boundaries (i.e., counties, cities, etc.), population, landuse (agricultural, residential and industrial) and other m an m ade structures. Table 1 o f this report outlines the referred data components o f the environm ent (i.e., natural environm ent, socio-economic environment, cultural environment and technical requirements / considerations) associated with route alternatives. This table also outlines the specific m easures and data sources, which will be used to assess impacts.

3.5 The

Features and Attributes specification and quantification o f a decision criterion depends on physical,

environmental and socioeconomic attributes and a geographical location. Physical attributes include features o f the built environment, such as airports, cem eteries and archaeological sites. Environm ental attributes include not only the location o f endangered species, but also their range and habitat. These also include air and water quality indices and ecosystem evaluations. Socioeconomic attributes are modeled in the form o f social and comm unity impacts. Travel way attributes include name or identification m arkers, facility type, signals, geometry, capacity, restrictions, traffic volumes, deterioration conditions,

construction/m aintenance activities and material characteristics. W atershed attributes include rivers, lakes, channelized rivers, canals, harbors, bridges Name/ID, shore topography, water depth, direction, and sediment movement, type o f canals, usage (refuge, m ilitary,

commercial), bridge dimensions, and bridge crossing specifications. Base m ap datasets attributes include boundaries, land use, demographics and businesses, environment, weather conditions, utility locations, public buildings and facilities. Land use, dem ographic and business data are the basis for demand forecasting analyses that help planners assess the need for transportation facilities. Urban planning is interconnected w ith transportation planning and datasets such as zoning, property value, property vacancy, population, and travel statistics help produce current and projected population estimates for short and long-term transportation planning. Business data provide trucking and railroad companies w ith freight demands and allows them to offer services that cater to the business specific needs. Environmental data, such as the location o f sensitive or hazardous areas, contribute significantly to the decisions that are made about the location and the m ode o f transportation.

Benefits of Using GIS to Perform EIA

GIS is a very powerful and useful tool and can be very efficient and effective for EIA (Colorado D epartm ent o f Transportation, 2004). The following is a partial list o f appropriate uses: Assessing physical/biological/human impacts. Using a wide variety o f remote sensing data. Perform ing analyses at a variety o f map scales. Developing standard rating systems for comparing disparate layers. Calculating additive effects. M easuring change over time (past, present, future, or other tim e intervals). Identifying locations where impacts are greatest or least. Identifying locations that are impacted from m ultiple actions or projects. Viewing non-physical features (e.g., political, zoning, or habitat boundaries). 3.7 Constraints o f Using GIS

There are some intricate problems in implementation o f GIS in environmental studies. M any o f these are comm on to m ost applications and three categories can be distinguished according to Van (1992). The problems are: · · · N on availability o f proper spatial data. Lack o f proper infrastructure within the government bodies. Shortage o f skilled manpower in the government planning and developm ent departments. · GIS software is being m ore costly.

STUDY CASE: MID-PENINSULA TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR

4.1

S tu d y A rea

In this project the M id-Peninsula Transportation Corridor case, which will be constructed at Niagara, Ham ilton and Halton areas, was used. The M inistry o f Transportation (MTO) has undertaken a significant amount o f technical, forecasting and strategic planning work in the Niagara, Ham ilton and Halton areas. This planning work has indicated that the existing transportation system does not have the capacity to support the planned population and economic growth o f the area from the Niagara Peninsula to the Greater Toronto Area. The transportation analysis for the Niagara Peninsula Transportation Needs Assessm ent Study focused on the geographical area associated with the Regional M unicipality o f Niagara, the New City o f Ham ilton (formerly Regional Municipality o f Ham ilton-W entworth) and the Region o f Halton, including the City o f Burlington (see Figure 6 for the study area map). As the above municipalities are part o f the broader Golden Horseshoe Area, the transportation linkages w ith the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Haldimand County, and the KitchenerW aterloo-Guelph area, was considered as part o f the study. In addition, given the proxim ity to the United States and the strategic role o f the Niagara Peninsula as a m ajor international gateway and économ ie corridor, the bridge crossings into New York State were exam ined in the context o f projecting traffic growth on the transportation netw ork (MPTC, 2005).

Study Objective

The objective was to demonstrate the potential o f GIS application for im proving environmental impact assessm ent in the corridor planning. For this purpose a num ber o f analyses were performed. All analyses are designed in such a way that they cover the m ost actual aspects o f road m anagem ent planning. The analyses simulate scenarios sim ilar to those, usually investigated in the feasibility study and are m ade up as a comparative assessment o f four alternatives. 4.3 Present Situation

The M inistry o f Transportation (MTO) prepared a draft N iagara Peninsula Transportation Needs Assessm ent Study (June 2001) examining long-term transportation needs and options in the Niagara/Ham ilton/Halton area within a 30-year planning horizon and found that additional transportation capacity was needed through the N iagara Peninsula into the Greater Toronto A rea to accommodate future growth in the m ovem ent o f people and goods. The corridor will increase road capacity in the peninsula, divert traffic and development away from the tender fruit farming areas below the escarpment, and prom ote development above the escarpment. On the basis o f the technical recommendations from the Needs Assessm ent, the M inistry o f Transportation commenced the formal EA process, starting with an EA Terms o f References (ToR), for the development o f a new transportation corridor in the Niagara, Hamilton and Halton area (referred to as the M id-Peninsula Transportation Corridor). In support o f the EA ToR process, M TO completed extensive municipal, agency, stakeholder and public consultation betw een M arch 2002 and May 2003 and has submitted environmental assessment terms o f reference for its proposal to develop a new transportation corridor, comprising a highway and potential future transitway, extending from the Niagara Falls/Fort Erie area through the N iagara Peninsula to the Hamilton/Halton area. The terms o f reference were submitted under section 6(2) (c) o f the Environmental Assessm ent Act and set out how the MTO plans to prepare the environmental assessment for the proposed highway/transitway. This project has received the support o f municipalities such as Niagara Region and Ham ilton because they understand the importance o f planning for the future and prom oting econom ic growth away firom features like the tender finit lands. However, Burlington and H alton are not

36

prepared to allow the environmental process to follow its normal course. Instead, they have chosen to appeal to the courts. Over the short term (immediate to 2005), MTO will consult with the com m unity on the needs assessment study findings and complete an environmental assessment (federal and provincial) to determine the preferred route location for the mid peninsula roadway. Once approved, MTO, w ith private sector assistance, is expected to proceed with the staged implementation o f the project with tentative completion by 2011. Several approvals m ay be required for this project. The MTO will consult with approval agencies while preparing the EA to coordinate timing o f approvals, approval requirements and to ensure that approvals are ultimately obtainable. Potential permits/approvals/authorizations required include, but are not limited to, the following: N avigable W aters Protection Act Approval (Federal Government) Fisheries Act Approval (Federal Government) Canadian Environmental Assessment Act Approval (Federal Government) Agreem ents from local utilities Railw ay Crossing Agreement Hydro Construction Agreements (Hydro One Networks) T ran Canada Pipeline Crossing Permit Inter-Provincial Pipeline Crossing Permit

Criteria

The overall assessment includes techmcal and economic prerequisites for different solutions and environm ental impact assessment o f the alternative corridors. The environmental assessment considers alternative routes for the proposed highway/transitway within the defined study area to determine a preferred route. Alternative routes will be generated and evaluated which connect to the QEW to the north and south o f the City o f W elland, and which connect to Highway 401 (east o f Highway 6), Highway 407, Highway 6 and Highway 403 (in Hamilton). Route features are created on Ontario highway layer as per above considered alternatives o f the study area. The average right o f way o f the proposed MPTC is 60 meters wide to allow for future expansion to four lanes. So buffers o f 60m are created for all alternatives which are being considered and rename o f these three alternatives are Alt-1, Alt-2, Alt-3 and Alt-4 respectively. As indicated on the map (see Figure 8), the solid line describes the all alternatives location o f the mid peninsula roadway corridor. The final location o f this corridor (and possible alternatives) is currently under review as part o f the needs assessment study and environmental assessment Terms o f Reference. By com paring consequences o f different alternatives proposed in the initial study, including zero-alternative, a final road corridor is suggested. At the same time the first decision on the road technical standards is being taken, for example, for which speed category the road should be designed and which level of priority it will get (national, regional, etc.) All national, environmental and public interests that can be affected by the construction o f the road should be revealed and clearly stated at this stage. Public opinions are also taken into consideration. W hen the choice o f the road corridor is finally approved the planning process goes further to the stage o f road design.

Assessm ent o f Alternatives

The evaluation o f the natural environment considers the comparative impacts o f each alternative on the following criteria. · The degree to which the proposed transportation system m odification m inimizes resource consumption (e.g., mineral, aggregate, and agricultural land). · The degree to which the proposed transportation system m odification minimizes vegetation areas, wetlands, and habitat. · The degree to which the proposed transportation system m odification supports federal, provincial and municipal environmental protection policies. 4.7 Analysis

For N iagara Peninsula corridor to be able to choose the best alternative a detailed EIA will be needed. Several road corridors were proposed as an improvement measure during the planning stage. In order to study the potential alternative for im proving the planning process at the N iagara Peninsula corridor, several problems simulating real situations were solved by overlay operation and were performed using the program ArcGIS. The problem s are presented in the form o f six analyses on the basis o f limited environmental data. 4.7.1 Analysis 1 --Municipality Areas Conflict

Am ong the m ajor tasks o f EIA during the feasibility study is to define and describe the areas o f conflicts, i.e., areas where the corridor will cross natural, residential, or cultural environments and places that are classified as national or public interests. In order to be able to analyse the consequences o f the road construction it is necessary to know how the landscape and people will be affected. Claiming o f land m ay result in removal o f houses, buildings, ancient remains, etc. To be able to assess the caused damage, and, thus, the compensation that all affected people have a right for, it is important to know which estates will be intersected with the road, how m any people will be affected in each m unicipality area and w hat value the estates have. Figure 9 shows the number o f m unicipality and population that will be affected due to the construction o f the MPTC.

Transportation o f dangerous goods has increased tremendously during the last years and is expected to grow in the nearest future. In order to make the transportation o f dangerous goods as safe as possible, risk analyses should be performed during planning and location o f new roads. R isk analyses imply "what i f ' scenarios where the potential risk o f possible accidents is studied. The task o f this analysis is to demonstrate the application o f the GIS-method in risk analysis, where it is needed to find out what is lying in the zone o f risk. During the transportation o f dangerous goods accident may occur at any point o f proposed corridor and the risk area around the point o f accident is considered 500 meters, so a buffer o f 500m is chosen as risk zone for all alternatives (see Figure 10). The num ber o f m unicipality and people those were affected can be found or how much land or streamlines m ay be polluted can be calculated (see Figure 11).

It is necessary to m ake an overall but comprehensive assessment o f how the different types o f land use, for exam ple residential, industrial or agricultural area, will be affected and to know how m uch o f land or water areas will be claimed and how the landscape and people will be affected for the construction o f the road. This analysis is going to show how the GIS-method can be used to produce the data on land use distribution inside the road corridor (see Figure 12) and to demonstrate, as an example, which o f road corridors has less impact on valuable agricultural land. And the results o f different alternative corridors are presented in graphical form (Figurel3).

Analysis 4 - Hydrography

Roads function as barriers for water streams and can have negative effects on surface and ground w ater movement. Moreover, roads can have an impact on water streams and rivers in the form o f pollution from cars petroleum products and from transportation o f polluting goods. To find out how many rivers/creeks or streams are intersected due to construction o f corridor and how m uch area inside the zone o f risk is agricultural land, perform the same analysis for the whole study area, assuming that each point can be a potential center o f accident. The results o f different alternative corridors are presented in graphical form in Figure 14.

Another im portant m atter that is studied during EIA is the content o f the transportation corridor or road zone. In order to evaluate the impact o f different alternatives, the decision m aker needs to know the type and value o f the environment inside the corridor or road zone that will disappear during the construction. In case the road is crossing the natural environment, it is necessary to make an overall but comprehensive assessment o f how the different type's vegetation or forest area will be changed. Figure 15 shows the vegetation layer that was lying inside the road corridor for Alt-1 and Figure 16 is the graphical representation o f affected vegetation area for all alternatives.

Solving by Spatial Modeling

Spatial m odeling is also used to visualize and analyze the anticipated effects o f a proposed corridor on the environment. Spatial analysis is a process o f modeling, examining, and

interpreting m odel results useful for evaluating suitability and capability, for estimating and predicting, and for interpreting and understanding. In GIS, there are four traditional types o f spatial analysis: spatial overlay and contiguity analysis, surface analysis, linear analysis, and raster analysis. It includes such GIS functions as topological overlay, buffer generation, and spatial or network modeling. In reality significant environmental constraints cannot be avoided for any corridor alternative but environm ental impacts can be minimized. So, first find out the locations where all the environmental impacts are avoided and than take decision which alternative is lying most closely. Following environmental constraints are considered for best location. The list o f constraints for best location: · It m ust be within the municipality o f Niagara Falls, W elland, Pelham, W est Lincoln, Glanbrook, Ancaster, Flamborough, Puslinch, Thorold and Burlington. · · · · · · It cannot be within 100 m wetland. It cannot be within 500m park area. It cannot be located where the land cover contains vegetation. It cannot be within 100m o f stream line. It cannot be within 100m of hydrography structure. It cannot be within 500m o f educational Institution.

Depending upon the above constraints the systematic process o f site selection is as shown in Figure 20. All works were performed using the program ArcGIS and suitable location map is shown in Figure 21.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

MTO is undertaking the planning and Environmental Assessment (EA) process to determine a preferred route for the proposed Mid-Peninsula Transportation Corridor. The work plans outline objectives for generating routes to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and describe how the impacts are associated with route. Route selection process is based on a combination o f engineering, traffic and economic, as well as environmental factors. The consideration o f alternative route or corridor alignments is the m ost effective way to select a preferred location in which a transportation scheme can avoid significant environmental effects. This report discussed how and when EIA it needed for highway projects and what is the process for which the EIA has to be done and how GIS can serve as an important tool for environmental scoping. It didnot address the issues related to the policy level. EIA should get proper attention in the process of decision-making. This can be reached by improving the quality o f information that forms the basis for decision-making; in other words, the basis for decision-making should be more comprehensive. Thus, the aim o f EIA is to contribute to the decision-making and provide decision-makers with knowledge about the conceivable effects from the project or any other activity on the environment, people's health and natural resources. The development o f Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) tools and m ethodologies is critical to ensuring that all potentially adverse impacts are identified and assessed, and are given consideration in the decision-making process. The EIA study utilized a process that seeks to determine the environmental effects. The analyses o f spatial data are an essential part of EIA. The study showed that GIS is applicable for m anaging and analyzing spatial data for EIA purposes. Overlay maps are easy to use and understand, and are popular in practice. It is a very important way of showing the spatial distribution o f impacts. It also leads intrinsically to an impact decision. Therefore, this study has dem onstrated overlay techniques to assess o f environmental impacts. Spatial m odeling is also used to visualize and analyze the anticipated effects o f proposed corridor on the

57

environment. GIS technology gives good outcomes when used to visualize information in forms o f map. It is difficult to comment on the specific environmental impacts associated with a MidPeninsula Transportation Corridor and recommend a preferred route location alternative. There is a high level o f complexity into the preferred route-selection process. Throughout the study area, it is expected that during the generation and evaluation o f alternatives, various routes w ould have common points where routes intersect. In such cases, further analysis would be taken to determine preferred routes for portions o f the study area rather than comprehensively examining all combinations o f routes for the entire corridor. Again one

alternative m ay be better for an environmental constraint whereas other alternatives m ay be better for another one constraints. Observations revealed Alt-1 is very poorly located compared to others alternatives regarding impacts on wetlands. Alt 1 crossed through previously undeveloped land which had plenty o f wetlands, whereas Alt-3 is located in relatively urban areas with less wetland. W ith respect to landuse, Alt- 1 affected minimum agricultural land (open area), where Alt-2 scored high on land use change because it travels through a main residential area, which would require appropriation o f m uch o f that land. W ith respect to noise pollution, Alt-2 and Alt-4 are poorest because they crossed through a major residential area, whereas Alt-1 and Alt-3 are relatively better as they are further away from residential development. In the case o f educational institutions Alt-1 and Alt-2 affected minimum numbers, whereas higher numbers o f educational institutions are affected in Alt-3 and Alt-4. Alt-3 scored very low on stream crossings compared to other three alternatives. With respect to vegetation area A lt-3 is located in relatively suitable location affecting the minimum numbers o f wooded area. However from the criteria and above discussion, this limited effort observed that Alt-3 would be preferred alternative with the least impacts, although it's impact is somewhat higher than others, but it was not by a large enough margin to be considered significant. The terrestrial habitat, aquatic habitat, ecosystem integrity/connectivity, air quality, noise, archaeology, heritage and economic factors are not envisaged in this study. However, there is always an opportunity to improve the method or to use better input data, which will improve the result. B y being aware o f potential and problems o f the technique it can be m uch easier to

58

establish well functioning application o f GIS. Overall the study presented the possibilities for improving EIA perform ance by using GIS. This decision-making process includes determining corridor alternatives, their evaluation and comparison, and choosing the best environmental option. Features o f the environment that needs to be considered in this decision-making process can either be issues where the corridor potentially impacts the environment or issues where the environment potentially impacts on the corridor. These issues are identified for every project, mapped and assessed to determine the potential significance o f their impact. To determine and compare corridor alternatives, the spatial location o f these issues, their spatial relation to each other and the potential significance o f their im pact needs to be considered. Further environmental investigations, including secondary source reviews and field investigations will be required to generate route alternatives, assess the impacts o f route alternatives and complete the evaluation that will lead to a preferred route.
