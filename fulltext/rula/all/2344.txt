Abstract Rapid Prototyping (RP) technology addresses the needs of industry to shorten design cycles and improve the design quality. In this project, an existing wax deposition system was retrofitted for wax extrusion of layers followed by surface and perimeter machining to ensure accuracy and quality. Work was undertaken to assess the influence of various parameters on the quality characteristics of the prototypes and to determine whether the modified machine would function to expectations. To carry out the experiments, a

methodology and several computer programs were developed to translate a part's dimension into G-code notation. Shapes such as cubes, rectangular prisms, cylinders and pyramidal prototypes were produced from wax using the Hybrid Rapid Prototyping (HRP) system. Data relating to tolerance and accuracy was collected for the The machine's

cubic/rectangular shapes as well as the circular/cylindrical shapes.

accuracy (tolerance per inch) with respect to cubical shapes was measured at 0.018" while the accuracy associated with cylindrical shapes was slightly less at 0.022". Furthermore, experimentation dealing with the benefits of combining machining and deposition rather than just deposition revealed that accuracies increased approximately 13 times with the addition of the milling head attachment. The evolution of prototype

production from preliminary experiments was recorded, and modifications were made until the quality and dimensional accuracy were deemed to be satisfactory. The

modifications made to the RP system significantly improved the accuracy and surface quality of the prototype parts. It is concluded that other standard RP systems can also be retrofitted to accommodate a machining station in order to improve accuracy and overall quality.

CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION 1.1 Introduction Rapid Prototyping (RP), also referred to as Layered Manufacturing, is a widely used method o f manufacturing in product design and development, which has been increasingly applied in the process o f design and development o f new products. For

automatic creation o f physical prototypes, three fundamentally different methods are possible, namely incremental building, décrémentai building and deforming [1]. Among these, incremental building is commercially available in layered manufacturing systems and the other methods (décrémentai building and deforming) are available in conventional production systems like CNC milling machines and press machines. In

recent years, the layered manufacturing process has found more widespread use due to its ability to produce internal cavities. As well, RP can produce a prototype very early in the product development cycle, without specialized tooling, and enhance the design process by providing rapid and effective feedback to the designer for visualization and verification. RP can dramatically shrink the time and expense required to bring a new product fi' om initial concept to production. Over the past few years, a variety of new rapid manufacturing technologies have emerged; StereoUthography, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Fused Deposition Manufacturing (FDM), Laminated Object

Manufacturing (LOM), Ballistic Particle Manufacturing (BPM), and Three Dimensional Printing (3D Printing). These technologies are capable o f directly generating physical

objects fi-om CAD databases [1]. They all have a common important feature: adding materials rather than removing materials to produce the prototype part. This simplifies the 3D part producing process to 2D layer adding processes. This permits a part to be produced directly from its computer model.

1.2 Rapid Prototyping Technologies A number o f RP technologies exist today. A discussion o f the merits o f each of these technologies follows. Stereolithographv Apparatus fSLA) The SLA machine creates a prototype hy tracing a layer of cross-sections on the surface o f the liquid photopolymer pool with a laser beam. The laser beam is deflected horizontally along the X and Y-axes by galvanometer driven mirrors so that it moves across the surface o f the resin to produce a solid pattern. After a layer is built, the

elevator drops a specified distance and a new coating o f liquid resin covers the solidified layer. When all layers are completed, the prototype is about 95% cured. Post-curing is needed to completely solidify the prototype. This is done in a fluorescent oven where ultraviolet light floods the object. The accuracy achieved is about 0.1% of the overall dimension and deteriorates with larger sizes but no more than 0.5%. The layer thickness is between 0.004 and 0.03" [2]. Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) In an FDM process (Fig 1), a spool o f thermoplastic filament feeds into a heated FDM extrusion head. A computer controls the movement o f the FDM head.

extruded out a nozzle by a precision pump. After one layer is finished, the extrusion head moves up a programmed distance in the z direction for building the next layer. Each layer is bonded to the previous layer through thermal heating. The overall tolerance is plus or minus 0.005". Successive laminations are within the range o f 0.001 - 0.05", and wall thickness ranges fi-om 0.01 to 0.25" [2].

Selective Laser Sintering fSLSl An SLS system uses a carbon dioxide laser to sinter successive layers of powder instead o f liquid. In SLS processes, a thin layer o f powder is applied by a counterrotating roller mechanism onto the work place. The powder material is preheated

to a temperature slightly below its melting point. The laser beam traces the crossElevator

section on the powder surface to heat up the powder to the sintering temperature so yjg

that the powder scanned by the laser is bonded (see Fig 2). When a layer o f the crosssection is completed, the roller levels another layer o f powder over the sintered one for the next pass. The average accuracy achieved ranges fiom 0.005" to 0.015" for a part with 12" in diameter and 15" in height. The layer thickness is between 0.003 and 0.02" [2].

Rallistic Particle Manufacturing (BPM) The ballistic system uses a piezo-driven inkjet mechanism to shoot droplets o f melted materials, which weld together, onto a previously deposited layer (Fig 3). A layer is created by moving the droplet nozzle in x and y directions. After a layer is formed, the base plate lowers a specified distance and a new layer is created on the top o f the previous one. The overall accuracy is plus or minus 0.004". The layer thickness is about 0.0035" [2].

The layers can be glued or

welded together. The excess material of every sheet is either removed by vacuum suction or it remains as the next layer's support. The models can be constructed with an accuracy o f +/- 0.005" and do not shrink or distort because o f the use of sheet material. The thickness o f a layer is between 0.002" and 0.02". Furthermore, the materials used to make the prototypes are less fragile than those made from photopolymers [2]. Table 1 summarizes the different RP technologies and their characteristics with respect to layer thickness and accuracy.

The merits o f rapid prototyping lie in the fact that it can produce a prototype very early in the product development cycle, even before tooling, and enhance the design process by providing rapid and effective feedback to the designer for visualization and confirmation. Rapid prototyping can dramatically shrink the time and expense required to bring a new product fi'om initial thought to production.

Although the current RP process overcomes many limitations o f traditional manufacturing, the desire to use rapid prototyping for short-run manufacturing is continuously urging development o f a cost-effective technique that will produce completely finished quality parts in a very short time. To meet the new demands o f

industry, rapid prototyping must be improved in the aspects of production speed, accuracy, and cost. Thus, a new HRP system was proposed to improve the aspects listed above through performing both deposition and machining in a single station. This

combination o f extrusion and material removal will allow the machine to produce high quality finished parts. Thus, the new HRP system can dramatically reduce the total build time and improve the shape accuracy compared with the conventional RP systems. In addition, this new system can be used to retrofit conventional RP systems, so that their degree o f accuracy is also increased.

In this report, a newly developed rapid prototyping process based on the hybrid technique, i.e. additive and subtractive process, and its hardware framework are presented. In addition, a variety of Visual basic 6 programs based on simple geometric shapes are also provided in order to assist the further reduction o f the total build time for prototype parts.

1.3 Other Hybrid Methods The objective o f an HRP System is to reduce development time for a new product to enter the market. Junghoon Hur [4], developed a HRP system, called ECLIPSE-RP. The

5-axis simultaneous machining, 5-sided prismatic machining, and vertical turning all in a single step. Station-2 was used as the location where new Deposition Feature Segments (DPS) were continuously deposited until the whole building process finished. Station-3 was used for new sheet materials and where the main process cycle begins. The conveyer module automated the work piece to flow between the stations while the set-up reverse module was used for inverting the sheet material whose backside has been completely machined (Fig 7). Finally, the adhesive dispense module ejected the cyanoacrylate on the top o f the already-deposited DFS's along the predefined bonding paths. Furthermore, Hur's hybrid RP system uses very thick chemical wood sheets as building materials, compared with conventional RP systems, which use thinner layers. Through his research, Junghoon Hur found that this new hybrid system could effectively solve the limitations of the conventional manufacturing process through its unique hybrid process and process planning system. Because the proposed hybrid process performs both deposition and

machining with a facility for inverting set-up direction, it is expected to become a new cost-effective manufacturing technique that will produce completely finished quality parts in a very short time for any shape. However, one important note to mention here is that this hybrid RP system first deposits all the layers together and then it systematically begins the machining process.

A different hybrid system was proposed by Jeng-Ywan Jeng and Ming-Ching Lin [5]. These authors researched a hybrid process to facilitate mould fabrication by using selective laser cladding and milling. Their design included a Rofin Sinar RS820 1500W CO2 laser that was employed in the SLS system as the power resource for the laser cladding process. An axial PC-based controller was used to position the work piece on the X-Y table. The control software moved the work piece to the desired position and started the cladding operation; the latter operation included the movement o f the work piece, and the control o f the powder feeders, the laser shutter, and the gas-shielding valve. Once the cladding operation was completed, the focused lens of the laser was moved up and the work piece was moved to the position beneath the milling head. Then, the surface o f the work piece with the clad profile was machined to achieve the desired accuracy and produce a smooth surface, ready for the next cladding operation. The

authors concluded that mould fabrication modified by the hybrid processes of SLS and milling is feasible if the layer thickness can be further reduced.

Authors Y.H. Chen and Y. Song [6] also developed a hybrid RP system. authors ventured that although The robot

machining has its unique features, it also has the same inherent problems o f CNC machining methods. problem features is that or deep The most obvious models with eavities hollow be

machine a bottom point inside a cavity, collision occurs between the tool holder and the model surface. To solve this problem, a layer based machining method was proposed. First, the whole model is sliced into layers as in most RP systems, and then the lower layer is machined first, since the cavity on this layer is much shallower than that o f the original model. As a result, the chances o f a collision occurring between the tool and the tool holder are reduced. After the machining of the lower layer, another layer is glued to it with adhesive. Then the machining o f a new layer can be repeated. The authors

concluded that their current system is capable o f machining large-scale models with simple hollow features. Furthermore, consecutive machining on each layer produces

better results and is more practical than machining the model after deposition is complete.

1.4 Proposed Hybrid Design The Hybrid RP system (HRP system) presented in this report was constructed fi' om the modification o f an existing machine and the incorporation o f a machining spindle similar to the cited researched papers. The HRP system head consists o f a material

extrusion head and a milling head. The material extrusion head initially deposits the first layer o f plastic or wax onto the X-Y table. A quarter of an inch (%") end mill is then used to machine around the perimeter o f the deposited layer as well as the top surface of the layer. Once this operation is complete, a new layer is deposited and subsequent

machining follows. The HRP system is considerably small when compared to the RP systems that were researched by the author. The working area o f this system is no larger than 4" x 4".

A program (DeskNC) thatallows the inputof G-codes

is used to move the X.Y table

through the driver board, as shownin Figure 11. However, to generate the appropriate Gcodes for a given shape would have required hours of tedious manual input for the designated coordinates. To

simplify this situation, a Visual Basic 6 program was written to produce the necessary G-codes to produce simple geometric shapes. Fig 11: I/O Board For HRP

In this work, the material extrusion head and the end null are mounted on the same XY table with the same degree o f movement, thus creating a true single station deposition and layered machining system. This is différent than in previous work as discussed in Section 1.2. The advantage in this system is that there is no need for a transferring

mechanism, such as a conveyer system, to transport the part from one station to another where vibrations in the movement could reposition the part and thus give inaccurate results. A user interface was created using Visual Basic 6 to allow the user to input any dimension on a given number o f shapes he/she wishes to produce with the HRP system. The program then produces a G-code program to the users specifications. These codes are then passed along to the RP system, permitting the additive production o f plastic or wax modelling to begin. The G-code also takes into account the movements o f both the material extrusion head the end-milling head. The G-codes were executed on a version o f DeskNC, which, graphically displayed, in real-time, the movement of the milling and the extrusion heads. Furthermore, the X, Y and Z coordinates o f both heads will be

continuously displayed while the machine is running. An unexpected final advantage of this system was its size with respect to portability and mobility. The HRP system can quickly be disconnected and reconnected at another location with a minimal amount of time.

It is crucial to mention that the apparatus in this experiment is not comparable to the equipment mentioned in Section 1.2. Complex shapes with deep cavities on both sides are not possible with this 3-D hybrid machine. The intent is to show that this proposed system has the capability to produce prototype parts with a satisfactory accuracy scale. Furthermore, this system will demonstrate the ability to retrofit an existing machine into a hybrid system. The accuracy proposed would become apparent due to the surface

machining that is performed to reduce the "stair-step" inaccuracies that are seen in other rapid prototyping systems.

CHAPTER 2 - EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE 2.1 Previous Rapid Prototyping Apparatus The current RP machine (figures 12 and 13) located in the T-buüding at Ryerson University was originally designed by Hassan Hamzeh in 2000 as a fourth year graduating thesis project. The RP

system resembles that of a bridge design used in most CNC punch machines. The working table is

fixed while the wax deposition head is allowed to move in the X and Y Fig 12: Fnml View of RP Machtae for the smooth motion in the axes mentioned. Stepper motors are used to slide the bridge over the ball railings and to ensure an accurate method o f motion. The paraffin wax was to be stored in a 3-inch diameter aluminium cylinder (see figure 14) with a wall thickness o f a quarter o f an inch. The height o f this cylinder is 6 inches and there are three heating

coils, which encompass itsexterior surface. Mr. Hamzeh also had designed an adjustable working table to accommodate the Z-axis but was unable to assemble it before the submission o f his paper. The

schematics o f the RP design are available in Appendix 1.

The method of wax deposition was originally thought to have been more o f a continuous output -- ·

rather than individual droplets in close proximity.

Mr. Hamzeh had designed an

aluminium cylindrical holder to allow a given amount o f sohd wax (fig 15) to be placed inside. This container was then wrapped with heating coils and was connected to a

variable temperature controller box. However, his research stopped short of designing and manufacturing an appropriate nozzle for the exodus o f the wax. In the summer of 2001, a research student by the name o f Sal Lamberti designed and manufactured a Fused Deposition Model (FDM) nozzle. This researcher went through several design iterations until the single screw pump was chosen. Mr. Lamberti reported that this design provided the necessary means o f metering out the wax accurately, and also provided the simplest machining design. He outlines that his main concern was that the nozzle should have the abihty to break the surface tension o f the wax in order to allow exportation.

2.1 Hybrid Rapid Prototyping Design I

Although the last two researchers did a tremendous job on this RP system, it was left somewhat incomplete. The initial goal o f this research was to complete, calibrate and modify the existing RP system into a Hybrid Rapid Prototyping (HRP) system. modification process started with the following issues being addressed. The

The first issue to be addressed was the addition of a machine-head. A DC-motor (fig 16) was mounted on the bridge beam to be used as the spindle for the machining head. The back supports o f the Z-axis table were removed and realigned (as shown in Figure 17) in order to level the aluminium-working table. A custom-made brass collet (fig 18) was designed and manufactured to securely hold the %" end-mlll into place. molten wax reservoir, with the heating coils wrapped around the basin and no On the

protective eover designed, this presented a very dangerous electrieal hazard.

To

overcome this problem, a stainless steel/plexi cover, shown in figure 19, was designed and manufaetured to protect the user fi-om the open electrieal wires and the intense heat that would be generated from the melting o f the wax. A clear plexi eover was used in front o f the safety guard to still allow sightseeing o f the basin.

Figl9: Custom Stainless Steel Protective Cover Furthermore, the single serew design needed to be shghtly altered. The clearance

between the lead screw and the aluminium piston was slightly too large. This resulted in the wax leaking out between the clearanee and solidifying on the outside. This

solidification hindered the performance o f the single screw. To combat this problem, a much more intimate fit was designed between the serew and the piston. This new

configuration resulted in a elearanee o f 0.002" between the piston and the eylinder. Furthermore, a higher torque stepper motor was used to overeome the possible

variable speed control box for the stepper motor was again designed and manufactured (as shown in Fig 23) in order to control the metering of the wax from the nozzle. This second variable adjuster was needed to

compensate the stronger stepper motor being used. However, the leaking of the wax could not be controlled 4 , and as a result the design was aborted. Fig 23: Second Speed Variable Control Box for the Stepper Motor

2.3.1 HRP Design II Results During the jSrst experiment a huge obstacle presented itself The Polysperene plastic has a melting temperature o f 240°C. However, the heating control box and the heating cod being used only raised the cylindrical temperature to 202°C. The temperature was measured from a probe connected directly to the nozzle portion o f the cylinder and was displayed on an electrical temperature reader (see figure 25). Furthermore, because the melting temperature could not be reached, once the plastic was extruded out with great force, it almost immediately solidified into a very hardened state. The remaining plastic

inside the cylinder had also solidified once Fig l^^DigitaTTemperature Display damage was tremendous. the heating coils were de-energized. The

There was no way to get the residue plastic out unless the

melting temperature was reached. And the current heating mechanism could not reach the melting temperature. A hammer and a chisel were used to break the plastic and then an oxy-acetylene torch was used to melt the plastic. The plastic was finally removed but the damaged caused to the cylinder was irreparable. The cylinder was cracked and the threaded holes used for supporting the cylinder were stripped.

2.4 Hybrid Rapid Prototyping Design III The previous cylinder for the second design iteration was constructed out of aluminium while the piston was manufactured from steel. Their clearance was set to

0.002" in order to accommodate the expansion o f both materials when induced with heat. Since the coefficient o f expansion o f aluminium is greater than steel, the tolerance between the piston and cylinder should increase allowing for movement between the piston and the cylinder. However, as mentioned the aluminium was not strong enough to withstand the Polysperene plastic removal process and had to be replaced. Furthermore, the expansion o f the aluminium could not always be accurately predicted. In this third attempt, the cylinder was refashioned from steel to provide much more needed strength for the cylinder and also to match the expansion coefficient of the piston. Therefore, both components would have the same expansion and contraction characteristics. Also, the Polysperene plastic was discarded due to the fact that the melting temperature could not be reached and thus the paraffin wax was revisited.

Initially, the wax was broken up and placed inside the new cylinder a piece at a time. The piston was used to compact the wax and then extruded. This process was very

tedious, time consuming and proved to be flawed. When the piston extruded the wax out, there were air pockets between the wax and a continuous deposition could not be possible. To avoid this problem, the wax was melted by a hot air gun (fig 26) in a steel
pot (figure 27) and was then poured into the cylinder to cure. This created, a non-porous

slug o f wax that could be uniformly heated and extruded. After an initial trial and error period, the third attempt described above was foimd to be the most suitable to carry on

2.5 Testing Temperature. Gap size. Feed-rate and Pump-rate 2.5.1 Phase 1 The next step involved finding an optimum temperature for the extrusion o f the wax, an adequate gap size between the nozzle and the working table to allow the wax to stick on the working table before solidifying and an appropriate feed-rate for the machine and pump-rate for the piston. An approach was taken to find the variables mentioned above. Table 2 illustrates a variety o f temperatures, gap sizes, feed-rates and pump-rates that were tested for peak performance. The correct procedure for optimizing such variables is to design an experiment based on the rules o f statistical analysis and then to use methods o f calculating the roundness o f cylinders and the squareness o f cubes (CMM-Coordinate Measuring Machine) in order to correctly identify how these variables interact with each other. Furthermore, statistical tests will be needed to determine the randomness o f the values in order to validate their importance. The magnitude and depth o f such an

undertaking was beyond the scope o f this project. In order to gain some raw preliminary data, a subjective criteria based on the author's experience was created to isolate optimum variable conditions with respect to initial adhesion qualities, uniform distribution o f the wax, and suppressing an overflow o f the wax.

These three criteria were deemed to be the most important factors affecting the out come o f the prototypes. Initial adhesion refers to the instant when the paraffin wax Referring to figure 28, it is clear that for

temperatures between 49°C and 52°C, the scores associated with initial adhesion were extremely low. This was due in part to the solid state o f the wax during those

temperatures and the lack o f an adhesive ability on the part o f the working table. These

Fig 28: Max Score/Temperature vs. Temperature (1/8" gap, 1/8" Dia.) two factors combined inhibited the bonding o f the wax to the surface. The second criteria (uniform distribution) dealt with a constant width of wax being extruded over a pre determined distance. This criterion was deemed to be extremely important because the program written for the production o f simple geometric shapes was heavily dependent on a known and fixed width. The final criterion, which dealt with an overflow of material, was used in order to systematically determine the optimum speed for the stepper motor and the optimum speed o f travel for the HRP machine. Since the gap between the nozzle and the working table diflerentiated between 1/8" and 1/16", suitable speeds had to be found in order to avoid an overflow o f wax. Each criterion was given a weight out often marks and immediately after each trial; a numerical score was assigned to that specific
configuration.

determined that the wax was extremely sensitive to a minute increase in heat.

The

maximum temperature for the usefiilness o f the wax, with respect to this project, was found to be 55°C. Figure 28 illustrates the maximum score per temperature versus the temperature for 1/8" diameter nozzle with a 1/8" gap and a metallic working surface. It can be seen that for the 1/8" nozzle diameter with a gap o f 1/8" the best scores were produced around the 53°C to 54°C temperatures. At these temperatures, the wax is in a quasi-liquid solid state where it is controllable and where it will meet all the required criteria. Furthermore, since the nozzle was 1/8" in diameter, results with a gap o f 1/8" between the extrusion head and the working table were noticed to be better. This piece of information was quickly documented.

2.5.3 Phase 1 Conclusion Reviewing the results o f the table once again, it was noticed that the most immediate problems were due to the initial adhesion of the wax to the working table and the problem of overflowing. It was hoped that solving the overflowing problem would somehow help to alleviate the initial adhesion concern. Since, the initial diameter o f the nozzle used for the first half o f the testing process was an eighth o f an inch (1/8"), it was suggested that a smaller diameter nozzle might hinder the overflow o f wax. Hindering the overflow of wax might in turn allow the wax to grip more securely to the working table as the extrusion head moved around.

2.5.4 Testing Phase 2 A nozzle with a diameter o f one sixteenth o f an inch (1/16") was machined and replaced with the original nozzle. The experiment was once again carried out. However,

realizing the pattern from the initial testing phase, the experiments were concentrated around the 52 °C to 55 °C. Furthermore, since the nozzle diameter and the gap size for the previous experiment had a direct relationship, more emphasis was placed on the 0.0625" gap while using the 0.0625" diameter nozzle.

2.5.5 Phase 2 Results Table 3 documents the results o f the second phase o f the variable optimization process. Although the focus o f this phase wax concentrated around a gap size of 0.0625", some experiments were carried out with a gap size of 0.125" in order to further enforce the hypothesis that gap size and nozzle diameter have a direct influence on each other in this experiment.

Analyzing Table 3, it is quite clear that the reduction in the nozzle diameter greatly reduced the overflowing wax problem. Furthermore, Figure 29 illustrates the maximum score per temperature versus the temperature for a 1/16" nozzle diameter and a 1/16" gap for a metallic working surface. In this second round of experiments, the hypothesis that gap size and nozzle diameter have a direct impact on each other, was once again reafSrmed with the scores attributed to a gap size of 0.125" with respect to those given to a gap size o f 0.0625".

the initial adhesion quahty o f the wax.

The wax, once extruded, solidified without

sticking to the working table and was thus dragged around as the extrusion head executed its tool path, hence the lower marks awarded for that criterion. The odd times when the wax seemed to have bonded to the working surface, quickly fell apart once the machining phase began.

2.5.7 Phase 3 It was hypothesized that a coarser textured surface with a higher coefficient o f fi*iction would help grip the wax once the extrusion head was in motion. Therefore, a very strong adhesive substance was sprayed on a piece o f wood and was covered with a roughsurface absorbent paper. Almost immediately, the change in results could be seen. The wax once deposited on the new surface was firmly held into place without the overflowing dilemma. The results are apparent as they appear in Table 4.

Fig 30: Max Score/Temperature vs. Temperature (1/16" gap, 1/16" Dia., Rough Surface) It is visible from Figure 30, that the addition of the paper surface to increase friction between the wax and the working table was an instant success. The maximum possible score allowed for this decision matrix is 30 points. The rough paper raised the scores from previous trials to 29 points.

Furthermore, a maximum feed-rate and pump-rate were also assigned to allow both productivity and uniformity for the part being produced. The variable speed controller box has five speed settings as was shown in figure 23. However, only the latter three were used for testing due to their higher revolutions per minute. The lead screw

connecting the plunger (piston) to the stepper is a % - 20 UNC threaded rod. Table 5 indicates the RPM (revolutions per minute) o f the stepper motor for each pump rate setting and also the travelling speed o f the piston for each setting.

Going back through Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 above, it is noticed that a feed-rate o f 4 inches/minute and a pump-rate of 3 always gave the highest score with respect to the other feed-rate and pump-rate combinations. Therefore, these two settings were used throughout the prototyping production stage. The last column in Table 5 illustrates the time it takes to empty a full cylinder. The cylinder can hold 0.414 in^ of wax when filled right to the top and it takes 21.4 minutes to empty the cylinder on pump setting 1, 16.6 minutes to empty on pump setting 2 and 10.3 minutes to empty on pump setting 3. It should also be noted that one full load in the cylinder can generate approximately 3 layers for a 1" X 1" X 0.250" part. The next phase of the experiment dealt with the actual

production o f simple prototype parts.

2.6 Fine Tuning Test Procedure 2.6.1 Temperature Adjustment Since these initial trial periods were performed on single lines and single layers, it was discovered later that the wax needed more time to reach a homogeneous of 54°C. This was noticed once the testing was upgraded Irom a single layer, to a multi-layered cube and cylinder where vast amounts o f wax were needed. Halfway through the programs, 31

the wax would leak out uncontrollably much like it had done at 55°C. The problem was that the step-less heat controller and the heating coils needed a sufficient amount of time to reach their prescribed temperature. Previously, when the program was executing its commands, it was noticed that the temperature would keep rising and as it rose, the melting temperature o f the wax was reached and it poured out o f the nozzle uncontrollably. Therefore, the temperature was lowered by 1°C to 53°C. Again, at this

temperature the wax performed exceptionally well with respect to the required criteria and the previous trials documented above. At this temperature, the wax was also stable when testing was upgraded to that of an actual part.

2.6.2 Prototype Production Problems and Solutions The production o f simple geometric shapes, revealed new complications to over come. Firstly, although the coarser surface held the wax into place, it was however, not strong enough to secure the wax once the machining process had begun. The surface needed to have better adhesion in order to securely hold the wax into place while the end-mill machined the perimeter and surface o f the shape. Therefore, the same adhesion spray that was used to bond the rough surface paper to the wood was also sprayed on top o f the paper for better adhesion between the wax and the paper. This quick fix worked fairly well and it was apparent when the machining phase began that the deposited wax stayed fastened to the paper.

The second obstacle was evident when the second layer of wax was being deposited on the first layer. Since one layer had solidified and the other layer was in a solid-liquid state, the two layers could not fully bond together to create a homogenous continuity.

32

Due to this problem, machining was obviously not properly performed and multiple test pieces were destroyed before a contingency idea was developed. It was suggested that if the first layer were not fully cured when the second layer was deposited, then the two would bond much better. Using the hot air gun on the first layer to keep the temperature high enough to allow the cohesion between the two layers first tested this idea. However, the sheer force and heat o f the air literally melted and blew the layer away. The distance between the hot air gun and the first layer of wax was adjusted repeatedly to find a suitable range for optimum performance. Unfortunately, this method was not reliable for the reasons mentioned above and for the fact that once an optimum range was discovered, only one side o f the layer was affected. Therefore a new idea had to be developed to allow uniform heat to be distributed throughout the layer without affecting its present position. It was hypothesized that a lit candle underneath the table would allow the heat to uniformly spread across the working table and onto the layer. The candle would not be strong enough to generate heat through the quarter inch thick aluminium table and through the quarter inch thick wood. Therefore, the wood was replace with a 16 GA (0.0625") piece o f aluminium sheet metal and was clamped past the table to allow the candle to be place underneath the sheet metal only. After multiple iterations through trial and error, the most optimum distance between the candle and the sheet metal was found and implemented.

Finally, the Hybrid Rapid Prototyping system was calibrated, fully assembled and was prepared to carry out simple geometric shaping of wax prototypes. The next section of this report deals with the software portion o f the experiment and some o f the programs that were written to accommodate the production o f wax prototypes.

For the solid rectangular prism program, the path o f the tool is such that it moves from left to right, jumps a specified unit in the y-direction and then moves from right to left and jumps again in the y-direction.

Fig 32: Tool Path For A Solid Rectangular Shape

This path was used as the building blocks for the program and is illustrated in figure 32. Essentially a loop was created to repeat this path until the desired dimensions were reached.

The program to produce the cylindrical shapes is somewhat different with respect to the wax deposition head moving in a circular path from the outside in. For the solid cylinder the user is required to input a radius, a nozzle diameter, a feed-rate and the height o f the cylinder. After the program has completed its calculations it will begin to extrude the wax in a circular fashion beginning with the outer dimension. The next path will be an inner circular path slightly smaller than the original and so on until the first layer is completed. The program will then begin to machine around the perimeter o f the first layer and the top surface so that the next layer can be deposited on a flat surface.

Once the information is inputted into the program, the computer would create and return an output in standard G-code notation. The programs were also outfitted with a "Save" command that allows the user to save the G-code data as a text (.txt) file. This sub-program was very essential due to the fact that Visual basic 6 runs on the windows platform and DeskNC runs on the DOS platform. Therefore, two computers were used and the data had to be saved as a text file in Windows so that it can be transferred to the DOS program that runs the HRP system. Once the file was downloaded and all the

system checks were accounted for, the machine began to produce the required part.

The next section of this project illustrates the HRP set-up procedure and the actual production o f a prototype part. The steps for the HRP process were documented as pictures to better illustrate the actions that the system undertakes.

Table 6 depicts the results acquired fi"om the production of a one-layered square shaped object and a multi-layered cubical object. The results in Table 6 are o f those objects that were not damaged during the removal and measurement recording stage. The first three columns after the trial column represents the intended measurements required. The next three columns illustrate the measurements taken fi-om a digital calliper after production had been completed and the last two columns were assigned to give a subjective view on the edge quality and surface quality of the parts being produced. It is clear after reviewing the table, that the actual shapes produced were not perfectly square. On average, the two sides o f the square were ofiF by roughly 0.010" and the surface quality was noted to be better than the edge quality. To account for the difference in 39

quality between the edge and the surface, it should be noted that once experimentation had begun, the end-milling head was not spinning in a concentric circle. There was a tiny bit o f wobble that was noted and during that stage was judged to be negligible in consequence. However, the difference in quality and for that matter dimensional size

cannot fully be responsible for the characteristics of the end-milling station. Throughout the experimentation the stepper motors used for the X and Y-axes would periodically step or pulse without the required commands. This was attributed to the heavy load of

electrical power that was being supplied from one terminal. Using a six-station power bar, electrical power from one outlet was diverted to the main computer, the monitor, the I/O board, hot-air gun, stepper motor for the piston and the electrical power supply for end milling. The electrical load placed on this terminal would sometimes deactivate the electrical power supply for the end milling head and would occasionally force the stepper motors to pulsate in a certain direction while the program was being executed. Thus, the inaccuracies and edge quality obtained can be credited to the lack o f proper power distribution. This issue was addressed however, by halting the melting o f wax during production runs and by turning the end milling power supply off when it was not in use.

Figures 41 and 42 illustrate the evolution o f the HRP system. In Figure 41, the first piece produced is displayed on the far left hand side. The sides are clearly not square and the surface is shown to be bumpy and uneven. After several iterations the next piece (second from the left) was produced. This piece was machined more thoroughly than the previous piece, yet the edges still did not have the satisfactory quality and appearance that was required during the experimental proposal.

and top surface quality which was deemed to be acceptable. A 4-layered cubical shape followed this progression, while maintaining the same dimensional accuracy, edge quality and top surface smoothness that was witnessed in its three-layered pyramidal predecessor. Following the completion o f the cubical shape, the software was instructed to produce a series o f rectangular prisms also. Again, the evolution of the shapes can be seen in Figure 43. The piece on the far left shown in Fig 43 is not fully rectangular and the surface quality is clearly not acceptable. However, after multiple iterations and the completion o f the fine-tuning process the pieces thereafter were deemed more acceptable with respect to accuracy and surface finish.

3.2 Circular and Cylindrical Shapes The next shape in the experimentation phase was a one-layered circle and a multi layered cylinder. Referring to Table 7, the overall accuracies remained constant with

respect to the cubical shapes except that the edge quality and surface scores showed higher gains over the duration o f this experiment than the previous trials. This can be directly linked to the fact that the feed-rate and the stepper motor pump rate were reduced during this section.

In the early stages o f production it was observed that there was a major difference between the production o f cubical shapes and that of cylindrical shapes. For the

production o f cubical shapes, only one axis was being used during a direction change (for example from the X axis to the Y axis). For the production of cylindrical shapes, both axes had to be in motion in order to execute a curved line. The vibrations generated by the simultaneous movement o f both axes gave slightly worst results that those generated by the production o f squares, which only use one axis at a time. Using a feed rate o f 4 fflches/minute in combination with the movements o f the X and Y-axes, it was evident 43

that there was too much force being generated on the system for any meaningful results. Thus the feed rate was reduced to 3 inches/minute in order to reduce the vibrations, which caused miss-steps or pulses in the system. Since it was discovered that the feed rate and the stepper motor pump rate had a direct relationship, the stepper motor's speed was reduced from a speed o f 3 (7.25 revolutions/minute) to a speed of 2 (4.5 revolutions/minute). The improvements in dimensional accuracy as well as edge and

surface quality are clearly visible in Table 7. The reduction in feed-rate, helped to ease the forces caused by the system's simultaneous motions in the X and Y-axes during the cylindrical production runs so that pulses or steps being generated by the stepper motors would only be executed at the operators request and not by the forces o f vibration.

Figures 44 and 45 depict the advancement o f the cylindrical wax prototype production series relating to accuracy and surface finish. Figure 44 shows one-layered prototypes that were produced without machining. The first three prototypes are that o f a 1-inch diameter, 1-layered circle. The first piece (far left) had rough edges and an unfinished top surface. The next three prototypes highlight the final approved samples that had an acceptable edge finish, top surface finish, and had dimensionally acceptable accuracies. Referring to figure 45, the two prototypes on the left were multi-layered cylinders (3/4" diameter). Again, it can be noticed that the middle prototype was slightly more round on the edges than its predecessor on its left hand side. However, both these prototypes displayed great surface quality in terms o f smoothness. Finally, the last prototype

illustrated in figure 45, shows the extruded outline for a circular shape two inches in diameter. If the program had continued, then subsequently smaller circles would have been extruded until the first layered was complete.

3.3 Hollow Cubes and Pyramidal Shapes The last two shapes produced during this phase o f the experiment were the pyramidal shape and the hollow cube shape (Figures 46-48). These two shapes were introduced to demonstrate the capabilities o f the HRP system. As a result, no data was compiled for these two shapes with respect to precision and tolerance. Figure 46 shows multiple

samples o f different pyramidal shapes and it also illustrates a hollow pyramidal shape. The first two shapes (from left to right) resemble two-step, three-platform pyramids. Figure 47 depicts the side views of the Fig 46: Top View Pyramidal Shape pyramidal shapes. From a human eye

perspective with respect to Figure 49, it can be seen that the base of the pyramid, the middle of the pyramid and the top of the pyramid all lie square to each other. The

third shape is a one-step, two-platform pyramidal shape. Fig 47: Side View Pyramidal Shape produced not only to demonstrate the abüity of the system, but also that of the developed software. The hollow cubes (Figure 48) Again, these shapes were

machine out a 3-layer cavity directly in the middle of the prototype. Final examination of the piece revealed satisfactory side and top surface finishes.

Overall, the HRP system performed exceptionally weU for a prototype design. The tolerances achieved by the system were in the competitive range of most commercial RP technologies in the market. Table 8 depicts a comparison chart that was shown in

Chapter 1.2 o f this report with an additional row to compare the HRP system with respect to other widely used commercial technologies. Table 8; Technology Comparison For Accuracy Between HRP and RP RP Technology SLA FDM SLS BPM 3D Printing LOM Hybrid RP System Layer Thickness Range 0.004" - 0.030" 0.010" -0 .2 5 0 " 0.003" - 0.020" 0.003" 0.003" -0 .0 1 0 " 0.002" - 0.020" 0.010" -0 .0 6 0 " Accuracy (Tolerance per linear inch) 0.1% - 0.5% o f overall dimension 0.001" -0 .0 5 0 " 0.005" -0 .0 1 5 " +/- 0.004" +/-0.013" +/- 0.005" +/- 0.018"

Table 8 illustrates the accuracy per inch o f several RP technologies. It is evident from this table that despite the lack o f robotic arms, carbon dioxide lasers and six-degree of freedom milling machines, the HRP system's accuracy is very comparable to other conventional systems. In particular, the FDM system was the building block design for the hybrid system. However, with the additional machining head on the hybrid system, it is clear from Table 8 that the tolerance for the HRP design is not as far spread as that for the FDM. Furthermore, the maximum average tolerance of the HRP system is This competitive range is due to the extra

Machining the perimeter and the surface after each layer ensures that accuracies are kept tight and high and it also ensures a cleaner and higher quality surface. Table 9; Comparison Between The HRP

hybrid RP. Unfortunately, there was no empirical data based on accuracy for the "Actua 2100", which was built by 3D Systems. Therefore, emphasis will be placed on the latter three machines. Referring to Table 9, the "Genisys" (figure 51) built by Stratasys has a published tolerance of 0.014". The HRP system has a documented tolerance of 0.018". Regardless o f the fact that the "Genisys" was built by a world-class RP manufacturer with technology, manpower and capital at its disposal, it only surpassed the accuracy of the HRP system by 0.004". The next commercially available RP machine in the market is the "Personal Modeller" built BPM Technology Inc. Referring to table 9, it can be seen that for parts smaller than 51mm (2.009"), the published accuracy for the "Personal Modeller" is 0.020". When compared with the HRP system' accuracy o f 0.018", it is evident that with respect to accuracy, the HRP has a clear advantage over this commercially produced RP machine. Finally, with respect to the "Model Maker" built by Sanders Prototype Inc., which as an accuracy value o f 0.002", it is clear that, the HRP system is no competition. Nevertheless, ranking in third place (0.004" behind second place) in a comparison between three widely used and accepted RP machines in the world is quite an achievement. The HRP design has proven that when compared directly with the leading RP machines in the world, it is very competitive with respect to accuracy.

aggressive and competitive with respect to popular commercial systems. Table 10: Comparison Between The HRP And Commercial RP Systems over

To fiirther enforce the fact that the machining head attachment was the main factor that improved overall dimensional accuracy and surface quality. Table 11 illustrates the measurements o f a one layered-square test piece with and without machining. Five trials were carried out in which the test piece was first created strictly by depositing the wax on the working surface and having its measurements recorded. Next, the machining phase o f the system was re-engaged to machine the surface and perimeter o f the test piece and its measurements were also recorded.

Reviewing Table 11, it is clear that prototyping without machining gave very unacceptable and undesirable results with accuracies exceeding a quarter o f an inch (0.250"). In a manufacturing environment, these tolerances would not be acceptable.

However, once the program for the machining portion of the system was re-engaged, the 52

CHAPTER 4 -CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 4.1 Conclusion An existing rapid prototyping machine was modified to become a Hybrid Rapid Prototyping (HRP) system. Software was written using Visual Basic to create a user

fi-iendly interface in order to allow the operator to choose amongst a number o f simple geometric shapes available to rapidly produce prototype parts. Furthermore, optimization experiments were carried out to determine the most favourable parameters with respect to nozzle diameter, gap distance, feed rate and the stepper motor pump rate in order to allow an optimal environment for prototype production. Once these parameters were

discovered, further experimentation was conducted to assess the system's accuracy for manufacturing three-dimensional parts. The experiments performed suggested tolerances o f 0.018" for cubical shapes and tolerances o f 0.022" for cylindrical shapes. These

tolerances are well within the competitive range o f commercially available RP machines in the market to date. Furthermore, experiments dealing with the effectiveness of a

milling head attachment revealed that prototyping without machining produced tolerances o f roughly 0.250" and prototyping with machining showed tolerances of 0.019". Therefore, prototyping with machining presented results that were approximately 13 times better than those results obtained by just deposition prototyping. The

proposed hybrid prototyping system was modified with a machining apparatus to perform both deposition and machining in a single station and thus it is expected that other standard systems in the future can also be retrofitted to accommodate a machining station in order to improve accuracy and overall quality.

4.2 Future Recommendations Although the HRP system is fully operational, there are however key areas where improvements could be made. One such area is apparent when depositing the second layer on to the first layer. It was stated in this report that a candle was placed under the table to allow the first layer to heat up slightly so that a strong cohesive bond could be produced between each layer to securely hold the part into place. However, one candle cannot obviously distribute an even heat supply to the surface area of the part. Secondly, the heat was being generated fi' om the bottom, whereas the bond would be taking place on the face o f the layer. Therefore, one quick suggestion could be to design a heating coil system to be placed beside the extrusion heat so that once the machining phase has completed its program, the heating coils could then be turned on to allow an even supply o f heat to the surface o f the layer before the deposition o f the second layer. Conversely, heat needed to be taken away after the deposition o f each layer before the machining phase could begin. Therefore, another recommendation could be the addition o f a small battery operated cooling fan to be placed above the table to allow cooling o f the part so as to reduce production time and also as a means of blowing debris out o f the way once machining has begun.

Another area for future research and effort could be directed towards the use o f the original single pump screw design system in combination with the wax extrusion system. The extrusion head could be used with a material slightly stronger than wax (such as polyethenol plastic) in conjunction with the deposition o f the wax and the machining head to produce very complex prototype parts. The system would thus consist o f three

independently controlled stations to deliver wax, plastic and machining capabilities to generate prototypes.

In retrospect, the one advantage that the original system has over this new hybrid design is the fact that it had a large reservoir o f molten wax awaiting production. The wax extrusion head is only capable o f storing about three layers worth of wax before it needs refilling. Furthermore, each time the cylinder is refilled with liquid wax, a given amount o f time is required for the wax to solidify and then to reach a steady state temperature o f 53°C. The obvious solution for this deficiency is that a new larger

cylinder with a customized piston be designed and manufactured.
