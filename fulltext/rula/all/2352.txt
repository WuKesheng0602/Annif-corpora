ABSTRACT
LOAD DISTRIBUTION IN PRECAST WIDE-FLANGE CPCI GIRDER BRIDGES By Magued W. Ibrahim, B.Sc., P.Eng., for the degree o f Master o f Applied Science Civil Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2005

As Ontario bridge infrastructure enters the era of maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement, prefabricated bridge systems will certainly have many advantages as compared to the conventional systems. Prefabricated systems can be quickly assembled and the traffic can be opened in a very short period o f time, minimizing the lane closure time, reducing the cost and design time, and minimizing forming and labour work. The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code specifies simplified design method for slab-ongirder bridges in the form of moment and shear distribution factors. This thesis presents a parametric study, using the finite-element method, on a series of precast Wide-Flange CPCI girder bridges to examine the applicability of the CHBDC load distribution factors to this prefabricated bridge system. The parameters considered in this study include span length, number o f lanes, number of girders, live load conditions, presence o f intermediate diaphragms, and type o f connections between individual girders. This study revealed that CHBDC load distribution factors generally overestimate the structural response o f such bridges. As a result, a refined set of load distribution factor equations were developed.

INTRODUCTION
1.1 General
In bridge design it is necessary to obtain an appropriate geometric layout for the structure so that it can safely and economically carry the loads imposed on it. In densely populated cities, elevated freeways and multi-level interchange structures are necessary. Nowadays, precast bridges have become an important component in highway bridges, especially when construction time and staging restrictions are often encountered. Precast prestressed bridges allow for rapid construction, less disturbance to the traffic flow and significant improvement in the quality and the durability o f the structure with less environmental effect. Precast prestressed concrete bridges have become increasingly popular.

Approximately two-third of the bridges, with span length from 18 to 36 m, are constructed using prestressed girders [41]. According to the National Bridge Inventory during the 1990s in the United States of America, it was observed that the precast prestressed concrete 1-girder systems form about 50 percent o f the prestressed concrete bridges built in the last 40 years [41]. Precast prestressed Wide-Flange girder technology, with the elimination o f the castin-place concrete slab, is currently being investigated by the Ministry o f Transportation of Ontario (MTO) as an innovative approach to the construction and rehabilitation of bridges that can potentially yield substantial economic benefits to the bridge authorities [19].

Figure 1.1 shows view s o f the W ide-Flange CPCI girders with longitudinal connections between them, while, Figure 1.2 shows typical cross section o f such bridge system. Also, in 2001, the American Association o f State Highway and Transportation O fficials' Technology Implementation Group (TIG) selected prefabricated bridge elements and systems as one o f their focus technologies, which are innovative technologies that are targeted for rapid implementation due to their high pay-off potential [36]. However, highway administrators, bridge designers and researchers face problems for which information already exists, either in documented form or as undocumented experience and practice. This information may be fragmented, scattered, and unevaluated for a specific use. As a consequence, full knowledge o f what has been learned about a problem may not be brought to bear on its solution. Costly research findings may be gone unused, valuable experience may be overlooked, and due consideration may not be given to recommend practices for solving or alleviating the problem. An extensive literature review to assemble and evaluate such information and

make it useful for type o f innovative bridge systems is urgently required.

1.2

The Problem
Currently, the Canadian H ighway Bridge D esign Code (C H BD C ), C A N /C SA -S6-

00 [11], provides sim plified method o f analysis in the form o f load distribution factors for slab-on-girder bridges. A s per CHBDC, sim plified methods o f analysis for the live load are based upon the analysis resulting fi-om many bridge structures using grillage, sem i continuum and finite elem ent methods for which the idealized structure was essentially an orthotropic plate [11]. MTO developed a software program called "C A N B A S" which designs the bridges based on two-dim ensional analyses, in accordance with the sim plified

methods o f analysis specified in the CHBDC. Recent software programs available in the market, based on finite element method, provide more powerful tools to analyze the structure using three-dimensional shell-element models for bridges.

Despite the general availability of computers and computer software programs for the bridge analysis, bridge designers in North America strongly prefer simplified methods of analysis to reduce the time spent in the design that will be reflected on a considerable reduction in design cost [7]. Since CHBDC load distribution factors were based on an

equivalent orthotropic plate approach for general slab-on-girder bridges, a parametric study is required to investigate the applicability of these factors on the precast system considered in this thesis, especially when modelled using the three-dimensional finite element approach. If CHBDC is proved highly conservative, simplified expressions for load distribution factors for bending moment, shear, and deflection for ultimate, serviceability and fatigue limit states, focused on precast prestressed wide-flange CPCI girder bridges based on results from this study, are needed.

1.3

Objectives

The objectives of this study are: 1. To conduct a sensitivity study, using the three-dimensional fmite-element modeling, on the effect o f the type o f joints between the precast wide-flange CPCI girders (intermittent connection or continuous connection) on the load distribution among girders. 2. To carry out a practical-design-oriented parametric study, using the threedimensional finite-element modeling, on the structural response of prefabricated

bridge system w hen subjected to CH BDC truck loading condition, and correlate the results with the specified CHBDC load distribution factor for slab-on-girder bridges. 3. To develop refined expressions o f the load distribution factors for the studied prefabricated bridges.

1.4

CHAPTER II

LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 General

Studying the structural response o f a bridge to live loads is a com plex task. The design values for bending moment, deflection or shear force for interior and exterior girders depend on the location and the number o f m oving tmcks on the bridge deck, boundary conditions and the cross section properties o f the bridge components. The design values o f bending moment, deflection and shear force in the girder vary with the change in girder spacing, girder span, flexural and torsional stiffness and the number o f intermediate diaphragms. The presence o f curvature, skew and continuity o f spans further complicate the task o f estimating these design parameters. To simplify the design process, North American bridge codes,

such as C A N/CSA-S6-00 (CHBDC) [11], AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specifications (2004, 2000 and 1998) [1, 2 and 3], and AASHTO Standard Specifications (1996) [4], treat the longitudinal and transverse effects o f wheel loads as uncoupled phenomena [9], Based on these codes, to obtain the design moment, deflection and shear force, the maximum moment, deflection, and shear force caused by a single truck live load are obtained using a single girder. Then, the values are to be amplified by a factor, which is usually referred to as the live load distribution factor.

The literature survey conducted is presented as follows: (1) Bridge types, (2) History o f prestressed concrete girders, (3) Fabrication o f prestressed concrete girders, (4) Previous research work, (5) Simplified methods o f analysis, and (6) Load distribution and codes o f

practice for precast girders.

2.2

Bridge Types
Generally, bridges can be constructed entirely from reinforced concrete, pre-stressed,

post-tensioned concrete, steel, wood or composite concrete deck-steel girders.

These

bridges may be comprised of a wood deck, concrete slab or steel deck on wood, concrete or steel girders. Many types of bridges have been used significantly on highway and road to facilitate the traffic flow. The bridge types covered by the simplified methods of analysis in the CHBDC [11] are as follows; 1. Reinforced / post-tensioned solid slab 2. Post-tensioned circular / trapezoidal voided deck 3. Deck-on-girders, including concrete slab-on-girder, steel grid deck on girder and wood deck on girder 4. Truss and arch 5. Rigid frame and integral abutment types 6. Bridges incorporating wood beams 7. Box girder single cell, multicell and multispine 8. Cable Stayed 9. Suspension One o f the most common types o f bridges in Canada is the concrete slab on precast prestressed girders. As commonly known, precast prestressed can be defined as short spans

for bridges up to 20 m spans, medium from 20 to 35 m spans and long for over 35 m spans [41]. The current study deals with concrete slab cast monolithically with CPCI girder

bridges, as shown in Figures 2.1 to 2.4. While Table 2.1 summarizes section properties o f these bridge cross-sections.

2.3

History o f Prestressed Concrete Girders
The concept o f prestressed concrete was discovered by the engineer P.M. Jackson,

San Francisco, California, who patented the concept in 1872 and used it for tightening concrete blocks for floor slabs. The German Engineer C.E.W Doehring obtained a patent for prestressed concrete slab using metal wires concept about 1888 [32]. All these attempts were unsuccessful, because the prestressing force, in low strength steel, was lost due to the losses at early age o f concrete. In 1927, the French engineer E. Fressynet (1879-1962)

demonstrated the usefulness o f prestressing using high-strength steel to control prestress losses [41]. In 1950, prestressed concrete bridge construction evolved with a two-span Since the 1950's, various configurations o f

bridge o f 6.1 m and 9.1 m span lengths [41].

precast prestressed concrete girders have been developed in many countries around the world for short-span bridges between 20 m and 36 m. In 1956, three types o f these girders; I-, U-, and box-girders, were adopted in North America Standards which became known as AASHTO/PCl girders [17]. A s demand for longer-span and continuous bridges grew with time, new sections and modifications o f existing sections were developed. These include several sections o f so-called bulb-T and N U girders, which composed o f I-girders with wider top flanges [21, 20, 27]. Currently, the N U girder types are w idely used in western Canada [15]. In 1983, Chelak introduced the improvement o f the Deck Bulb T girders used

8

by Alberta Transportation. One of the major improvements is to make the web thickness 160 mm to meet the minimum requirements for the concrete cover to the stirrups [12]. In 1994, Yamane et al. presented the state-of-the-art of precast pretensioned beams section configurations for short-span bridges, using cast-in-place top slab and diaphragms, constructed in the United States and Japan [43]. Composite concrete deck slabs with precast prestressed girders have been extensively used in Canadian highways. This type of bridges has proven to be economical in North America and other parts of the world [18]. In Ontario, the most frequently used precast prestressed girders for bridges are the CPCI and box-girder types, as specified by the Canadian Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute manuals. In 2003, MTO started a project to investigate the feasibility of

constructing/rehabilitating bridges using prefabricated beam elements.

This resulted in

using 22 m single-span integral abutment bridge type using CPCI girders cast monolithically with the concrete slab in replacing a bridge in Northern Ontario [19].

2.4

Fabrication of Prestressed Concrete Girders
Precast prestressed girders are constructed with constant dimensions in a steel form.

Strands are placed after the reinforcing steel and pre-tensioned using jacks from out side the form. Hold-down points at defined locations are used to allow bending the strands from bottom layers at the middle of the girder to the upper surface at both ends. CPCI girder types are the most commonly used prefabricated girders for bridges in Ontario. These girders comprise of 660 mm wide bottom flange, 160 mm thick web and 910 mm top flange [35]. Also, Bulb-T girder types, with a thin top flange using cast9

in-place concrete slab, are w idely used in N ew Brunswick [40]. N ew girders are used in the current research and comprised of, identical bottom flange and web thickness, to CPCI girders but with wider top flange to form the concrete slab. Therefore, the

abbreviation WF-CPCI for this new ly adopted girder types w ill be used in the course o f the current study for simplicity. This abbreviation stands for W ide Flange-Canadian

Precast Concrete Institute girder. The top flange width varies from 2.0 to 2.4 m with a constant thickness o f 225 mm to accommodate the minimum required thickness for using the sim plified design method outlined in the CHBDC. The minimum width o f the flange was chosen 2.0 m to provide a reasonable spacing between girders and provide econom ical structures. The maximum width o f the top flange is limited to 2.4 m to

reduce the total weight o f the girder for the ease o f fabrication, transportation and construction. This type o f girders w ill be used with no additional cast-in-place top slab for the bridge deck, or concrete overlay, as the top flanges with different connection types w ill form the final deck surface. This w ill enhance the durability o f the top surface o f the structure and w ill significantly reduce the cost by reducing the in-situ construction period o f the structure. The main difference between the WF-CPCI and the AASHTO/PCI Deck Bulb-Tee girders is the constant 225 mm thickness o f the top flange that allows for the design using the sim plified method o f analysis in CHBDC without using cast-in-place overlay or top slab. A lso, the thickness o f the top flange allow s for two layers o f

reinforcing steel and a full connection between girders using the required standard splices. The major advantage o f the monolithic section is that the centre o f gravity o f the section becom es higher resulting in larger eccentricity o f the strands to the neutral axis with more efficient prestressing system. The advantage o f this type o f girders in the design o f the

10

superstructure is that the self-weight o f the slab will be applied to the entire section rather than to the naked girder, without top slab, in slab-on-girder bridges. Details o f different WF-CPCI girder types are presented in Figures 2.1 to 2.4. Possible examples for the types o f longitudinal intermittent and continuous connections between the girders are provided in Figure 2.5. However, more details on the type o f connections and their

structural performance up to complete collapse were reported by Sennah et al. [38].

2.5

Previous Research Work
This section summarizes previous research work pertained to load distribution in

slab-on-girder bridges. An analytical procedure for determining shear and moment due to live load for both composite and non-composite bridges was developed by Newmark et al. [33]. Newmark et al. analyzed a number of bridges using simplified assumptions based on elastic theory. They recommended the following relationship for the transverse distribution o f total longitudinal moment at a cross section in multi-girder bridges and presented the result o f their work in a series of tables containing the fixed-end moments, distribution factors, and the carryover factors for both non-composite and composite slab-on-girder bridges. M q --D / M t (2.1)

where M g is the design moment o f a given girder due to the live load at the section of interest, Mr is the maximum moment o f the same girder due to a single design truck, Df is the distribution factor, S is the girder spacing in meter and A T is a constant in meter.

11

Newmark et al. [33] suggested K o f 1.676 m. The 1996 version o f AASHTO standard [4] uses the same formula for girder spacing up to 1.829 m in order to determine the design moment for each girder in composite bridges. Experimental research work was carried out by Newmark et al. at the University o f Illinois to verify the above equations [33]. The

Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code (OHBDC), (1983 and 1991) [31, 30] and Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2000) [11] adopted the basic approach o f Newmark et al. for calculating the live load design moment for girders. The maximum live load moment in each girder is obtained by multiplying the maximum moment due to the design live load by distribution factor Df [9]. In the early fifties, to better assess the live load distribution in slab-girder bridges, more rigorous analyses were performed based on the orthotropic plate theory. In this This

approach, an equivalent orthotropic plate is analyzed instead o f the actual bridge.

transformation, however, in many cases cannot fully simulate the real bridge behaviour. With the introduction o f computers into engineering calculations, bridge engineers could use refined numerical techniques to study load distribution problems. Different bridge

responses were analyzed and evaluated for various loading conditions. Researchers started to develop simplified methods for bridge design, implementing distribution factors for the bending moment in the longitudinal direction as a factor o f the calculated longitudinal moment resulted from single girder. In 1994, Dorton [16] studied and addressed the

significant improvement to the Canadian design codes since 1950 to the draft o f the CHBDC that was supposed to be issued in 1996. In 1979, Bakht et al. [6] used the concept o f orthotropic plate to develop a simplified method for calculating the design live load longitudinal moments. In their research, they
12

conducted extensive parametric studies, which led them to find out that the distribution factor o f bridges is related to a torsional parameter a and a flexural parameter ^ which are functions o f geometry and material properties o f the bridge. These parameters are given by:

where Ec, Gc and Vc are the Young' s modulus, the shear modulus and the Poisson' s ratio, respectively, t is the concrete slab thickness, S is the girder spacing, I g and J q are the flexural and torsional moment o f inertia o f the girder cross section, respectively. The

subscript G refers to girder and c refers to the concrete slab. This method gives better results than the AASHTO recommendations [4] that assume the girder spacing S is the only 13

parameter that affects load distribution in slab-on-girder bridges. This method formed the basis o f the 1991 version o f the OHBDC [30] as well as the CHBDC provisions [11]. In 1982, Jaeger and Bakht [24] used the grillage analogy method for the idealization o f slab and beam bridges. In grillage analogy method, the longitudinal members were

positioned to coincide with the actual girders centerlines and were given the properties o f the composite section [22]. The transverse members were considered as beams replacing the strips o f the top slab. The moment o f inertia, follows:

o f the transverse beam is considered as

Details o f simplified methods o f analysis, which are also applicable for AASHTO loading, are given by Bakht and Jaeger [8]. In 1984, Kostem [25] used the finite element method to determine the transverse distribution o f moments in composite bridges. He examined the distribution factors His research on eight simple-span

provided in 1977 version o f the AASHTO standard.

prestressed concrete bridges indicated that the design parameters that govern the load 14

distribution are beam spacing, span length, width of the bridge and the number o f beams. He proposed the following equation for load distribution factor in concrete slab-on-girder bridges:

and span length o f the bridge, respectively. K} and K 2 are geometric constants that depend on bridge width, number o f girders, and number o f traffic lanes, while « is a constant. In 1986, other investigation was carried out by Kuzmanovic and Sanchez [26], using the finite element method, to study the response of three types o f structures, namely: beam and slab, multi-girder and box girder bridges. They concluded that the accuracy of the transverse load distribution factor is the key to make a really economical design. In 1989, Ho et al. [23] performed Analysis on slab-on-girder bridges using finite strip method and checked the results with those obtained from the grillage analogy method. They provided design curves to obtain a distribution factor for the design moipent. They believed that the accuracy of these curves is much higher than those factors obtained from the simplified method specified in the 1983 version o f OHBDC. In 1988, Nut et al. [34] presented a study on the distribution of wheel loads on highway bridges. A most recent version o f the elastic load distribution factor for bridges was introduced by Zokaie, et al. [45]. This new distribution factor formed the basis o f the AASHTO standard o f 1996. According to their study, the distribution factors of the

longitudinal bending moment to interior girders for slab-on-girder bridges are given by the following equations:

where S, L, Kg and ts are the spacing between girders in feet, the span length in feet, the longitudinal stiffness parameter and the slab thickness in feet, respectively. For exterior girders, they introduced correction factors to the previous equations o f the interior girders for moment and shear. In 1999, Chen performed a finite element analysis, using ADINA software program, on simple span precast prestressed concrete bridges using three types o f AASHTO I-girders [13], to evaluate the live load distribution factors for bending moments used in AASHTO and AASHTO-LRFD. The finite element model includes shell elements for the top slab, 16

frame elements representing the precast concrete girders and rigid links to link between the shell and the frame elements. She concluded that the factors derived from the finite element analysis were lower than the factors from AASHTO and AASHTO-LRFD. Also, Chen recommended that the finite element method should be used for future bridge projects [13]. In 2000, Zokaie [44] carried out extensive analysis using grillage and finite element analysis to verify and evaluate the formulas, developed earlier in 1991 [45]. In the finite element model, shell elements were used to represent the deck slab and frame elements to represent the precast girders [44]. In his study, Zokaie calibrated the developed formulas for moment and shear distribution factors to the interior and the exterior girders for bridges that are designed for one, two or more traffic lanes. According to this study, the distribution factor o f longitudinal bending moment for slab-on-girder bridges for interior girders was given by the following equations: For one traffic lane:

For exterior girders for one traffic lane, the factor 1.0 was provided for moment and shear related to the single beam distribution. For exterior girders for two or more traffic lanes, multiplication factors to the factors provided for interior girders are given as follows: For bending moment for two or more traffic lanes: I f + d, e=> 1.0 9 .1 / For shear for two or more traffic lanes: 6 / + ^, e=· 10/ where dg is the edge distance.

18

study in the year 2000.

In 2001, Shahawy and Huang [39] performed an extensive theoretical analysis with field testing and proposed some modifications to the load distribution formulas of the AASHTO code in the case of concrete slab-girder bridges. According to their investigation, the AASHTO code provisions were found accurate enough for one design lane load but for two or more design lanes loaded some modifications should be applied as follows: For interior girder: g,nlenor=gLFRD^-<f) For exterior girder: g exterior ~ g LFRD^^ where is calculated based on AASHTO formula and ^ x (2.25) . Parameters ^ and (2-24)

(j> i were derived and given in charts, e = 0.77 + dg I 2800 > 1.0, where dg is the overhang distance, i.e. is the distance between the centre of exterior girder and interior edge of curb or traffic barrier. In 2001, Schwarz and Laman carried out experimental program on three bridges, slab on concrete-I-girders type for one lane and two lane truck loadings for the comparison to the AASHTO-LRFD and to assess the numerical grillage model used in the analysis [37]. They performed tests on three bridges of 10.3, 23.3 and 31.1 m span lengths. For one loaded lane, the comparison between the load tests and the grillage model indicated that the results from grillage analysis are higher than those obtained from load tests by 32% to 38% for the interior girder under the load and less than 10% for exterior girder for the shortest

19

span. For the other two bridges with longer spans, the results obtained from the grillage model exceeded the results obtained from load tests by less than 30% for the interior girder and 10 to 20% for the exterior girder. Furthermore, the load distribution factors obtained from grillage analysis were higher than the calculated factors from AASHTO-LRFD by at least 17%. They concluded that results form grillage model were in close agreement with the measured results, neglecting the transverse diaphragm in the grillage analysis model. In 2001, Barr et al. used the finite element analysis to study live load distribution factors for bending moment for three-span skew prestressed concrete girder bridge [9]. They used shell elements for the top cast-in-place slab and frame elements for the precast prestressed girders. Rigid links were used to connect the shell elements with the frame elements that located at the neutral axes o f the girders. They compared the results with the expressions for distribution factors for bending moment specified in AASHTO-LRFD Specifications o f 1998, the AASHTO Standard Specifications o f 1996, and the OHBDC o f 1991. They observed that the distribution factors from the finite element model were 6% to 28% lower than those calculated from AASHTO-LRFD Specifications and AASHTO Standard. However, the distribution factors obtained from the finite element analysis were observed to be close, in some models, to those calculated from OHBDC and were unconservative in other models.

2.6

Simplified Methods of Analysis
The CHBDC, 2000 [11], as well as the 1991 version o f the OHBDC [30], specifies

simplified method o f analysis for live load using load distribution factors for slab-on-girder bridges. For OHBDC, the simplified method o f analysis for the live load is based on
20

considering the bridge as a rectangular orthotropic plate that was simply supported at two opposite ends on unyielding line supports which were continuous across the width o f the plate and did not impose moment restraint. For CHBDC, the simplified method of

analysis for the live load is based on the results from many bridge structures using grillage, semi-continuum and finite element methods for which the idealized structure was essentially an orthotropic plate. There are conditions and limitations for the use o f simplified method o f analysis. Two specified requirements for the concrete deck on precast girders are

specified (the longitudinal moment is to be resisted by a composite section comprised of the girder and the effective part o f the deck slab, and the transverse moment is to be taken by the deck slab). The conditions, specified in the CHBDC for applying simplified methods of analysis on straight bridges, are as follows: 1. The bridge width is constant; 2. The support conditions are closely equivalent to line support; 3. The skew Parameter { s - S tan co /L) does not exceed 1/18 where S is the spacing between girders, to is the skew angle and L is the span length; 4. There shall be at least three longitudinal girders that are of equal flexural rigidity and equally spaced or with variation from the mean o f not more than 10% in each case; and 5. The overhang does not exceed 60% o f the mean spacing between longitudinal girders and not more than 1.80 m. These restrictions have been provided for the consistency between the methods of analysis in CHBDC and OHBDC. Shear-connected beam bridges are analyzed by the
21

methods applicable to shallow superstructure provided that continuity o f transverse flexural rigidity across the cross-section is present. If not, analysis for longitudinal moments and shears is by the same method as for multi spine box girders. When the skew angle, co, o f a bridge is less than 20°, it has usually been considered safe to ignore the skew angle and analyze the bridge as a right bridge whose span is equal to the skew span. The implication o f this practice is that the angle o f skew is considered to he the only necessary measure o f the skewness o f the bridge with respect to its load distribution characteristics. Extensive comparative analyses o f skew and equivalent right bridges

conducted by Jaeger and Bakht [24] showed that the angle o f skew o f the bridge is not the only necessary measure o f its skewness, which is also affected by its span, width and girder spacing, if present. In particular, it has been shown that a dimensionless parameter

characterizing the skewness o f a slab-on-girder bridge is S tan to !L. For permitting the analysis o f a skew bridge as an equivalent right bridge, the Code has imposed the upper limit o f 1/18 for this parameter to ensure that the shear values in particular are not in unsafe error by more than 5%. CHBDC noted that the force effects in skewed, slab-on-girder type bridges may be analyzed by the simplified methods presented, if the other conditions o f the simplified method are met. The simplified method presented in the Code enable the

designer to calculate the increased shear effects that occur with increase in skewness. CHBDC stated that the two limitations pertaining to an overhanging deck slab, noted in condition 5, relate to the need to have the structure remain such that the orthotropic plate approximation is closely applicable. For a slab-on-girder bridge with equally spaced girders a distance S apart, a cantilever overhang o f SI2 on either side is the desired condition, since each longitudinal girder can then be associated in a width S/2 o f deck on either side o f its
22

centreline; a uniformly distributed load over the entire deck area would then result in the girders sharing equally in accepting the total longitudinal responses. If the overhang is

permitted to be a maximum o f 0.65, the outer girders then accept rather more bending moment and shear force than the interior ones, but the departure from uniformity is still acceptable. So far as the limitation on the deck overhang o f 1.80 m is concerned, when due allowance is made for barrier walls, curbs, etc. this limitation means that when a vehicle is travelling as far over in the outside lane as possible, its centre of gravity will not be significantly outside the centreline o f the outermost girder. This limitation is necessary if the orthotropic plate representation is to be realistic. The bridges selected for establishing analysis results for the simplified methods in this Code had the same limitations for the deck slab overhang, being equal to or less than 60% of the girder spacing, S, with a maximum overhang equal to 1.8 m.

Load Distribution and Codes of Practice for Precast Girders
The CHBDC, 2000, specifies equations for the simplified method o f analysis to

determine the longitudinal bending moments and vertical shear in slab-on-girder bridges due to live load for ultimate, serviceability and fatigue limit states using load distribution factors. The CHBDC distribution factor equations used for slab-on-prestressed-girders are as follows: For the longitudinal bending moment per girder, M ^, for ultimate and serviceability limit states: = K , ^gavg (2.26)

ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
3.1 General
The finite element method is considered as the most powerful and versatile method o f analysis available nowadays [10]. In early 1980s, the grillage analogy method was

extensively used and was very popular [24]. Because o f the recent development in finite element method, and the large capacities o f high-speed computers, it is possible to model a bridge in a very realistic manner and to provide a full description o f its stmctural response due to different loading conditions. One o f the most important advantages o f the finite

element method is the ability to deal with problems that have arbitrary arrangements o f structural elements, material properties, and boundary conditions. Also, it allows the

analysis using combination o f various structural elements such as plates, beams, and shells. Therefore, the finite element method is very suitable for the analysis o f precast This chapter includes descriptions o f modeling the The finite

different components o f the precast prestressed concrete WF-CPCI girders.

element model includes the concrete deck slab, web, bottom flange, end-diaphragms, intermediate diaphragms and the connections between girder flanges as described in subsequent sections in this chapter. The finite element analysis software "SAP2000"

version 8 [14] was used throughout this study to determine the structural behaviour o f the precast prestressed concrete girder bridges under truck loads. A general description o f this software is presented further in this chapter. The finite element method described herein was used to perform extensive parametric study on the structural response o f both partially
30

and fully connected precast prestressed concrete WF-CPCI girder bridges due to CHBDC track loading conditions.

3.2

Finite Element Approach
The finite element method is a numerical method for solving problems in fields o f

engineering and mathematical physics. In structural engineering problems, the solution is typically concerned with determining stresses and displacements and will yield approximate values o f the unknowns at discrete number of points in a continuum. This numerical

method of analysis starts by discretizing a model. Discretization is the process where a body is divided into an equivalent system of smaller bodies or units, expressed as elements, and interconnected at points, expressed as nodes, common to two or more elements and/or boundary lines and/or surface. All elements are combined in formulated equations to obtain the solution for the entire structure. Using a displacement formulation, the stiffness matrix o f each element is derived and the global stiffness matrix of the entire structure can be formulated by the direct stiffness method. This global stiffness matrix, along with the given displacement boundary conditions and applied loads is then solved, thus the displacements and stresses for the entire system are determined. The global stiffness matrix represents the nodal force-displacement relationships and is expressed in a matrix equation form as follows [10, 5]: [p] = [a:][c/] where: [P] [X] = = nodal load vector; global stiffness matrix; and (3.1)

In the case o f a linear (elastic) structuralproblem, loads are first applied on a model and the solution is obtained directly. In a non-linear case, theanalysis follows a different numerical method to obtain a solution. However, such analysis is beyond the scope o f this thesis and is not discussed.

SAP2000 Software
SAP2000 software [14] is a structural analysis program that uses the finite element

method and has a range o f capabilities depending on the version used. Widespread use across many countries during the 1980s and 1990s made SAP2000 software a popular choice for finite element analysis. The program is used worldwide to estimate structural responses o f structures due to various applied loads. It is also capable o f analyzing

structures in static and/or dynamic modes using the following type o f elements that are available in the program: · FRAME Element: The Frame element is a two-node three-dimensional element, which includes the effect o f biaxial bending, tension, axial deformation, and biaxial shear deformation. · Shell Element: The Shell element is a three- or four-node three-dimensional element, which combines separate membrane and plate-bending behaviour. The membrane behaviour includes translational in-plane stiffiiess components and rotational stiffiiess component in the direction normal to the plane o f the element. The plate bending behaviour includes two-way, out o f plane, plate rotational stiffiiess components and translational stiffiiess component in the direction normal to the plane o f the element. The program allows using pure membrane, pure plate, or full shell behaviour. · Plane Element: The Plane element is a three- to nine-node two-dimensional element, which contributes stiffness only in the two translational degrees o f freedom at each o f its connected joints. Plane element is used for modeling thin
34

plane stress structures and long plane strain structures. · Solid Element: The Solid element is an eight-node three-dimensional element, which includes nine optional incompatible bending modes. The solid element contributes stiffness in all three translational degrees o f freedom at each o f its connected joints. · Asolid Element: The Asolid element is a three- to nine-node two-dimensional element, which contributes stiffness only in the two translational degrees o f freedom at each o f its connected joints. Asolid element is used for modeling axisymmetric structures under axisymmetric loading. · Nllink Element: The Nllink element is a one joint grounded spring or two joint link which is composed of six separate springs, one o f each o f the six deformational degrees of freedom. The Nllink element is used for modeling linear or nonlinear structural behaviour. The nonlinear behaviour is used only for the time-history analysis. In addition, subsets o f these elements with varying degrees o f freedom are available in the form o f truss, frame, membrane, beam, strain, gap, and hook elements.

Finite Element Modeling of WF-CPCI Girder Bridges
A three dimensional finite element model was used to analyze the WF-CPCI girder

bridges considered in this study. A convergence study was conducted to choose the finite element mesh. The finite element mesh is usually chosen based on pilot runs and is a compromise between economy and accuracy. In the finite modeling process, the structure is

35

first divided into several components. In this case, the bridges were divided into; concrete deck slab, webs, bottom flanges, concrete diaphragms and steel connections. 3.4.1 G eom etric M odeling M odeling of D eck Slab, W ebs, B ottom Flange, and D iaphragm s

3.4.1.1

From many types o f shell elements available in SAP2000 library, the four-node shell element was chosen to model deck slabs (top flanges), webs, bottom flanges and diaphragms. The four-node shell element has six degrees o f freedom at each node that are three displacements (U l, U2, U3) and three rotations (<F1, 0 2 , 03). A detailed diagram o f the shell element is presented in Figure 3.1. Four horizontal elements were used to model each top flange between webs; while two vertical elements were used to model the web. Two horizontal elements, in the transverse direction, were used to model the bottom flange o f each girder. The diaphragms between the webs were modeled with a total o f eight

elements comprised o f four elements in the lateral direction and two elements in the vertical direction. In the longitudinal direction o f the bridge, 62 elements were considered. These elements comprised o f one element at each end representing the longitudinal overhang beyond the bearing locations for future studies and 60 elements between the two supports. Figures 3.2 to 3.6 show views o f the SAP2000 finite-element model for a bridge o f six WFCPCI girders, o f 2000 mm girder spacing, 30 m length and 1400 mm girder depth, with no intermediate diaphragms, and one or two intermediate diaphragms. A conversion study has been carried out to investigate the accuracy o f the results from the finite element analysis. In this study, various numbers o f elements, in the

longitudinal, vertical and transverse directions o f the bridge model, have been considered. In the longitudinal direction o f the bridge, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 120 elements were considered 36

between the two supports o f the bridge. In the transverse direction, 2, 3, 4 and 6 elements were considered for each top flange between webs, while 1, 2, 3 and 4 elements were considered in the vertical direction for each web. In modelling diaphragms, 1 ,2 ,3 and 4 elements were considered in the lateral direction. The accuracy factors of maximum

bending moment, deflection and shear force is presented in Appendix C. The reference values used in this comparison were highlighted in Table C-1 shown in Appendix C. Thus, the accuracy factors are considered as the ratios between the moment, shear and deflection for a certain number o f elements and those for highlighted number o f elements. The number o f elements used in conducting the parametric study is also presented in bold in Table C-1, Appendix C. The results indicate that the proposed finite element model for this parametric study provides results within ±2.5% differences from those obtained with higher or lower number o f elements. 3.4.1.2 M odeling of Connections

To model the intermittent connection between girder flanges in the longitudinal direction, two-node three-dimensional frame element was used. This frame element has two nodes with six degrees o f freedom at each node that are three displacements (U l, U2, U3) and three rotations (4>1, 0 2 , 03). Schematic view of the bridge model showing the

intermittent connections between girder flanges is presented in Figure 3.3. 3.4.13 Modeling of Moving Load Paths

SAP2000 software has the ability to run a moving load along a defined frame element path. The program shifts a group o f loads, previously defined as static loads,

certain interval along a defined path and provides the extreme straining actions at each node. Therefore, frame elements are provided in the longitudinal direction at the top o f the shell 37

elements for the paths o f the moving loads. These frame elements are modeled with a very small section dimensions so that they do not affect the finite element model o f the structure. Static loads on frame elements were used to reduce the time o f computer runs and placed to provide equivalent maximum bending moment, deflection and shear force resulted from SAP2000 moving loads runs. 3.4.2 B o u n d ary C onditions Nodal constraints were used in the analysis as boundary conditions to represent the supports o f the bridge. First, the roller support at the right end o f the bridge restricted both vertical and lateral displacements at the three nodes o f the bottom flange o f the middle girder. Second, the hinged support at the left end o f the bridge restricted all three

displacements at the three nodes o f the bottom flange o f the middle girder. Roller support, at the three nodes o f the bottom flange o f other girders at the right end o f the bridge restricted the vertical displacement only. Hinged support, at three nodes o f the bottom

flange o f the other girders at the left end o f the bridge restricted the vertical and longitudinal displacements only and released the displacement in the lateral direction. In case o f even number o f girders, one o f the most inner girders is considered the middle girder. 3.4.3 M ate rial M odeling The material properties can highly affect the results o f the analysis. Therefore, it is important that the material properties are defined so that SAP2000 software can provide suitable properties for the elements. Material properties, for concrete and steel, are

considered linear elastic and isotropic for these structures. The required properties for SAP2000 software are the elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, the weight density, the mass density and the coefficient o f the thermal expansion in three directions. 38 In SAP2000

software, the shear modulus is defined in terms o f Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio as per the following equation:

where: G = E= u=

the shear modulus; Young's modulus; and Poisson's ratio.

Materials and their properties are chosen based on the CHBDC and the common materials available in Ontario. The compressive strength o f concrete (f'^ is considered 35 MPa. As per CHBDC , the weight density (/c) for normal prestressed concrete is

considered 24.5 kN/m^. The modulus of elasticity o f concrete {Ec) is calculated tfom the following equation [11]: = (3 0 0 0 ^ + 6900)(y, / 2300)' ' (3.11)

= 27,900 MPa

'

(3.12)

The Poisson's ratio for elastic strains o f concrete is taken as 0.2 and the mass density for concrete is taken as 2500 kg/m^. The modulus o f elasticity of steel {E^ is taken as 200,000 MPa and the Poisson's ratio for elastic strains o f steel is taken as 0.3. Samples o f the resulting input files are given in Appendix A. The individual steps involved in creating the input data files are outlined in the SAP2000 Users Manual [14].

Bridge Configurations
Hundred and eighty nine (189) straight WF-CPCI bridges with different

configurations were considered in the parametric study.

WF-CPCI girders with top

flange width o f 2.0, 2,2 and 2.4 m width were considered. Four different girder depths were considered in forming the bridge prototypes, namely: 1200, 1400, 1600, and 1900 mm. The following bridge parameters were considered in this study: 1. 2. Girder span length (T) was taken as 20, 25, 30 and 35 m. Spacing between girders (S) was taken as the same width the girder (2.0, 2.2, and 2.4 m). 3. Number o f girders (AO was taken 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. as thetop flange o f

4. Three cases for intermediate diaphragm were considered, namely: no intermediate diaphragm, one intermediate diaphragm, and two intermediate diaphragms. 5. The Spacing for the lateral connection between girders in the longitudinal direction o f the bridge was taken 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500 mm and fully connected along the length o f the girder. The number o f girders, considered for each bridge cross-section, was based on the bridge width required for 2, 3, or 4 lanes, shoulders on both sides with barrier walls type Performance Level 3 (PL3) o f 570 mm width in accordance with the Structural Manual o f MTO [28]. The shoulder width considered in this study satisfies the minimum side

clearances provided in the MTO Revision Information Sheet for Geometric Design Standards for Ontario Highways [29], (Table D7-1, Minimum Side Clearances at Bridges, dated August 30, 2002). Table 3.1 summarizes the bridge deck configurations considered
40

in this study and the associated shoulder width. The number o f girders chosen herein satisfied the number o f design lanes (n) o f 3, 4, and 5 according to CHBDC requirements [11] as shown in Table 3.5. The width o f the design lane shown in Table 3.6, was

calculated in accordance with CHBDC, Section 3.8.2, from the following equation;

n where:

(3.13) is the deck width from the inner face o f the barrier wall to the inner face of

the other barrier wall. Details o f the 189 WF-CPCI girder bridges used in this study are summarized in Table 3.2. The deck cross slopes and the longitudinal grade were ignored in the analysis. No sidewalks were considered as the bridge configurations were based on PL3. Table 3.3 summarizes the bridge configurations used to conduct the parametric study on the effect o f the change in type and configuration o f the connection between the WF-CPCI girder flanges. For all WF-CPCI girder bridges considered in this study, the longitudinal flexural stiffness (D^) was calculated and provided in Table 2.1 based on the following equation that is presented in the CHBDC:

(3.14)

where: Ec

is the modulus of elasticity for concrete;

/ is the moment o f inertia o f the girder; and S is center-to-center spacing between girders.

The moment o f inertia was determined for each girder shown in Figures 2.2 to 2.5.
41

According to CHBDC, a database o f composite steel and prestressed slab-on-girder bridges from the Province o f New Brunswick was examined and an average longitudinal flexural stiffness parameter, Dx, was determined to be presented by the following empirical equation: D;, = 3350X^ + 660001 (3.15)

Also, the flexural stiffnesses for the studied WF-CPCI girder bridges were determined based on Eq. 3.14. Figure 3.21 presents a comparison between both results. It can be observed that all bridge configurations provided flexural stiffness less than those obtained from Eq. 3.15 except WF-CPCI girders with 1600 mm depth and 20 m span. However, the 1600 mm depth girders are not practical for 20 m span bridges, but these were considered in this study to broaden the range o f the applicability o f the research work.

3.6

CHBDC Specifications for Truck Loading
The live load, specified in the CHBDC, consists o f CL-W Truck or CL-W Lane

Load. The CL-W Truck consists o f idealized five axles with total load o f 625 kN as shown in Figure 3.7. The CL-625-ONT Truck load, shown in Figure 3.8, specified for the province o f Ontario is different from CL-W Truck, provided for all other provinces, in the axle loads. Both CL-W and CL-625-ONT trucks are placed centrally in a space o f 3.0 m wide that represents the clearance envelope for each truck. Dynamic load allowance is applied to both CL-W and CL-625-ONT Trucks. The CL-W Lane Load consists o f 80% o f the value given for each axle o f the CL-W Truck superimposed within a uniformly distributed load o f 9 kN/m and a space o f 3.0 m wide (Figure 3.7). The CL-625-ONT Lane Load is similar to
42

the CL-W Lane Load but using the CL-625-ONT Truck instead of using the CL-W Truck (Figure 3.8). No dynamic load allowance is considered for both CL-W and CL-625-ONT Lane Loads. For multilane loading, the live load, specified above, should be multiplied by a modification factor as shown in Table 3.4. The uniformly distributed portion o f the lane load, which decreases the load effect, shall not be applied to the structure. For serviceability and ultimate limit states, the traffic loads can be the truckload with the dynamic allowance or the lane load, which ever produces the maximum load effect. This load is positioned within each design lane. For fatigue analysis, an equivalent static load is specified in the CHBDC. Only one truck, either CL-W Truck or CL-625-ONT Truck, can be placed at the centre o f one travelling lane. The lane load is not considered for the fatigue limit state and no dynamic allowance is considered. The CHBDC states that for longitudinal bending moments and associated deflections for fatigue limit state and superstructure vibration, the vehicle edge distance (the distance Ifom the centre o f the outer wheel load to the edge of the bridge) shall not be greater than 3.0 m. In studying the bending moment and deflection distribution factors, live loading was applied on the bridge in such a way to produce maximum mid-span longitudinal stresses, (Figure 3.9). For shear force distribution factors, the loading was applied on the bridge in such a way to produce maximum reaction on the supports at one side o f the bridge, (Figure 3.10).

Loading Conditions
A preliminary study on a single girder for both CL-625-ONT Truck and CL-62543

ONT Lane Load indicated that the CL-625-ONT Truck provides the maximum load effect for simple spans o f 20 m to 35 m long. As a result, the CL-625-ONT Truck is considered in this study to obtain the design parameters. Based on the CHBDC, the design o f the bridge is characterized by three limit states, namely: the Serviceability Limit State (SLS), the Ultimate Limit State (ULS), and the Fatigue Limit State (FLS). As such, loading conditions considered herein include truck-loading cases for each o f the three limit states o f design. Since, bridge configurations considered in this study include two- to four-lane bridges which reflect three to five design lanes, three to five different sets o f loading cases were considered for the mid-span bending moment and deflection. Another three to five different sets of loading cases, based on the number o f the design lanes, were considered for the end span shear distribution. Figures 3.11 to 3.19 schematically indicate all possible live load cases considered for the bending moment, deflection and shear at both exterior and interior girders. In this study, the exterior girder is the one closest to bridge barrier location while, the interior girder is any girder between both exterior girders.

Load Distribution Factors

(Fm) for the exterior and the interior girders, the longitudinal stresses in girders at the bottom surface o f the bottom flange, resulting from the bridge analysis at the critical section (cr), due to truck loadings were identified. Also, the longitudinal stresses for the corresponding single girder, resulting from the analysis at the corresponding critical section o f the bridge (c t q ), due to a single truck loading were identified. The maximum

stress at the bottom surface o f the bottom flange was identified from the average stress results for the 4 elements adjacent to the chosen section. Thus, the girder bending

Also, the deflection for the corresponding single girder, resulting from the analysis at the corresponding critical section o f the bridge (ôo), due to single truck loading was identified. The maximum

CHAPTER IV

PARAMETRIC STUDY RESULTS
4.1 General
This chapter presents the results from a practical-design-oriented parametric study on 189 simply-supported straight concrete WF-CPCI girder bridge prototypes, using the finite-element method. The bridges were analyzed to evaluate their structural responses when subjected to CL-625-ONT truck loading conditions. The parametric study included the investigation o f the distribution factors for longitudinal bending moment, deflection and shear force at the ultimate, serviceability and fatigue limit states. The key parameters considered in this study included spacing of the lateral connection between girders in the longitudinal direction o f the bridge (s'), span length (L), number o f longitudinal girders (N), girder spacing (S), number o f intermediate diaphragms (Nj), number o f design lanes (n), and truck loading conditions. Comparison between the results from the finite element modelling and the corresponding factors from the simplified method of analysis specified in the CHBDC for slab-on-girder bridges was conducted. Based on the results generated from this parametric study, refined equations are proposed to adjust the results obtained from the CHBDC simplified methods o f analysis for slab-on-girder bridges.

4.2

Effect of the Type of Connection between Girder Flanges
The connection between the flanges o f the WF-CPCI girders can take two forms,

namely: continuous connection joint and intermittent connection joint.
50

In continuous

connection, reinforcing steel rebars are extended beyond the sides o f the flanges and overlapped to form moment-transferring joint as shown in joint (1, 2 and 3) in Figure 2.5. In this joint, moment continuity is achieved along the length o f the joint in the direction o f the girders. On the other hand, these girder flange ends can be joint together using steel plates dowelled into the flange ends at equal intervals in the direction of the girders. Once these girders are placed in their positions over the abutments or piers, these steel plates are either welded as shown in joint (4) in Figure 2.5 or bolted as shown in joint (5) in Figure 2.5. Figure 4.1 shows schematic view o f a WF-CPCI girder bridge with The behaviour o f these joints under CHBDC wheel loading was In the current research, a parametric study is conducted to

intermittent joints.

studied elsewhere [38].

examine the effect o f the type o f connection between the ends of girder flanges in the direction o f traffic. A 30 m span two-lane bridge o f 1600 mm depth was chosen to study the effect o f the type o f joint between the ends o f girder flanges. In modelling continuity of moment at the line between the ends o f girder flanges, one nodal line, with 62 nodal points in the longitudinal direction o f the bridge, was considered to represent both ends o f girder flanges as shown in Figure 3.2. At each node, three-translational and three-rotational degrees o f freedom were assumed to provide full interaction between the two sides o f the connections along the nodal line. However, to represent the intermittent connection

between the ends o f the girder flanges, two nodal lines were considered, one at each flange end as shown in Figure 3.3, with 62 nodal points in the longitudinal direction o f the bridge. A frame element was utilized to link the nodes on the first nodal line to the corresponding nodes on the second nodal line, within each slab panel. This frame

51

element was assumed to have a rectangular section o f 12 mm height and 300 mm width representing the welding between a connecting rebar and each o f the steel plates embedded on the vertical sides o f the ends o f the girder flanges. 4.2.1 M om ent D istribution F actor The results from the analysis o f the 30 m span bridge are presented in the form of moment, deflection and shear distribution factors for eccentric and centric loading cases. Figures 4.2 to 4.4 show change in the moment distribution factors in each girder due to eccentric truck loading condition with one truck in the outer lane, eccentric loading with two trucks in the outer two lanes and centric loading with three trucks in the three lanes, with the change in the flange-to-flange connection from continuous type to intermittent one, with joint spacing o f 0.5, 1.0,1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 m. Comparing the results for the exterior girder in Figures 4.2 to 4.4, it can be observed that the eccentric loading case, with two trucks in the outer two lanes, provides the design moment distribution factor for the exterior girder. As such, the results shown in these

figures are used to study the effect of connection type. It can be observed that the change in the flange-to-flange connection from continuous one to intermittent with any joint spacing between 0.5 to 3.5 m had insignificant effect on the moment distribution factor for the exterior girder. Figure 4.4 shows the change o f flange-to-flange connection from continuous type to intermittent one when all the lanes were loaded centrically. It can be observed that the

moment distribution factor for the interior girder G2 increased with the change from continuous connection to intermittent one. Further increase in moment distribution factor was observed with increase in joint spacing for girder G2. Also, Figure 4.4 shows opposite 52

trend for girder G3 with respect to girder G2. However, in design process, all the interior girders are usually assigned for the maximum bending moment in any of these girders. It can also be observed, from Figure 4.4, that maximum moment distribution factor for all interior girders, G2 to G5, changed from 1.11 in case o f continuous connection to 1.14 in case o f intermittent connection with 3.5 m joint spacing (an increase o f 2.5%). Also, it can be observed that the moment distribution factor for the second girder changed from 1.02 in case o f continuous connection to 1.14 in case o f intermittent connection with 3.5 m spacing between joints (an increase o f about 11%). Comparing the results for the interior girders in Figures 4.2 to 4.4, it can be observed that the centric loading case, with three trucks, provided the design moment distribution factor o f the interior girder for intermittent connections at G2 and for continuous connections at G3. As such. Figures 4.11 and 4.12 show the moment distribution factor for G2 and G3 girders, respectively, when the three lanes were loaded for bridges with no intermediate diaphragm, one intermediate diaphragm and two intermediate diaphragms. It can be observed from Figure 4.11 that the moment carried by girder G2, in case of continuous connection, changed from 1.03 with no intermediate diaphragms to 0.97 in case o f one intermediate diaphragm (a decrease o f about 6%). Also, It can be observed from Figure 4.12 that the moment

carried by girder G3, in case o f continuous connection, changed from 1.11 with no intermediate diaphragms to 0.97 in case o f one intermediate diaphragm (a decrease o f about 13%). In case o f bridges with no intermediate diaphragms, it can be observed that the change in flange-to-flange connection from continuous type to intermittent type with 3.5 m spacing between connections increases the moment distribution factor for girder G2 by 32%. However, the moment distribution factor for G3 decreases by 3% when

53

changing the flange-to-flange connection from continuous type to intermittent type. 4.2.2 Deflection D istribution F actor Figures 4.5 to 4.7 show change in the deflection distribution factors in each girder due to eccentric truck loading condition with one truck in the outer lane, eccentric loading with two trucks in the outer two lanes and centric loading with a truck in each lane, with the change in the flange-to-flange connection from continuous type to intermittent one, with joint spacing o f 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 m. Similar trend to that for moment distribution factors was observed in case of deflection distribution factor. For example. Figure 4.7 shows that the design deflection distribution factor (shown here for girder G2) changed from 1.016 in case o f continuous connection to 1.084 in case o f intermittent joint of 3.5 m spacing (an increase o f about 7%). 4.2.3 Shear D istribution F actor Figures 4.8 to 4.10 show change in the shear distribution factors in each girder due to eccentric tmck loading condition with one tmck in the outer lane, eccentric loading with two trucks in the outer two lanes and centric loading with a truck in each lane, with the change in the flange-to-flange connection from continuous type to intermittent one, with joint spacing o f 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 m. Similar trend to that for moment distribution factors was observed in case o f shear distribution factor. For example. Figure 4.10 shows that the design shear distribution factor (shown here for girder G2) changed from 1.33 in case o f continuous connection to 1.78 in case of intermittent connection of 3.0 m spacing (an increase o f about 34%). Figures 4.13 and 4.14 show the maximum bending moment and shear force
54

transferred through flange-to-flange connections, respectively for different loading conditions. It should be noted that the plotted values are the maximum from all flangeto-flange connections in this bridge. Figure 4.13 shows that the design bending moment, transferred through the intermittent connections, is negligible. However, it can be

observed that the maximum shear force, transferred from a girder flange to the adjacent one through the connection element, increases with the increase in spacing between these connections in the longitudinal direction o f the girder. For example, the shear force,

presented in Figure 4.14, changes from 43 kN in case o f 500 mm spacing to 190 kN in case o f 3500 mm spacing (an increase o f about 3.4 times the shear force). It can also be observed that the shear loading case o f fully loaded lanes with CHBDC trucks provides the design force for such connections.

4.3

Effect of Intermediate Diaphragms
CHBDC specifies load distribution factors for slab-on-girder bridges assuming that

there are no intermediate diaphragms between the support line and that end diaphragms exist only along the support lines. A sensitivity study was conducted herein to examine the effect o f the presence o f one or two intermediate diaphragms on load distribution factors among girders. Figures 4.15 to 4.17 show the effect o f the number o f intermediate diaphragms on the moment distribution factors due to one lane loaded eccentrically, two lanes loaded eccentrically and three lanes loaded centrically. In case of fully loaded lanes shown in

Figure 4.17, it can be observed that the presence o f intermediate diaphragms assisted in distributing the moments among girders more evenly and that the maximum moment distribution factor obtained from this load case decreased by about approximately 8% with

55

the presence o f intermediate diaphragms. Figures 4.18 to 4.20 show the effect o f the number o f intermediate diaphragms on the deflection distribution factors due to one lane loaded eeeentrieally, two lanes loaded eeeentrieally and three lanes loaded centrieally. Figure 4.19 shows a trend similar to that in case o f moment distribution factor for fully loaded lanes. It can be observed that the design deflection distribution factor increased by about 8% for the exterior girder and decreased by about 6% for the interior girder in case o f eeeentrieally loaded lanes. Figures 4.18 and 4.19 indicate slight change in the deflection profile. Figures 4.21 to 4.23 show the effect o f the number of intermediate diaphragms on the shear distribution factors due to one lane loaded eeeentrieally, two lanes loaded eccentrically and three lanes loaded centrieally. In ease o f exterior girder, Figure 4.21, the shear distribution factor changed from 1.19 in ease of no diaphragms to 1.25 in ease o f one diaphragms (an increase o f about 5%) and 1.31 in ease o f two diaphragms (an increase o f about 10%). However, for interior girders (as depicted from Figure 4.21), the shear distribution factor changed from 1.45 in case o f no diaphragms to 1.4 in ease of one diaphragms (a decrease o f about 3%) and 1.3 in case of two diaphragms (a decrease o f about 10%). In conclusion, the presence o f intermediate diaphragms improves the distribution o f loads on girders by increasing the load distribution factor for the exterior girder and decreasing it for the interior girder.

4.4
4.4.1

Effect of Span Length
M om ent D istribution Factors Figures 4.24 and 4.25 show selected results for the effect o f the bridge span length 56

on the moment distribution factors at ultimate limit state (ULS) and fatigue limit state (FLS), respectively, for the exterior girder o f bridges with girder spacing o f 2000 mm. It can be observed that the effect o f bridge span length on the moment distribution factor is insignificant at ULS. However, the moment distribution factors for FLS increase with For example, the moment distribution factor for FLS for the

increase in span length.

exterior girder o f 20 m span bridge with 7 girders is 1.02, while it is 1.19 for a similar bridge but o f 30 m span (an increase of 17%). It is interesting to mention that Figures 4.24 and 4.25 show the moment distribution factors as obtained from CHBDC equation and that a similar trend is observed. Figures 4.26 and 4.27 show selected results for the effect of the bridge span length on the moment distribution factors at ultimate limit state (ULS) and fatigue limit state (FLS), respectively, for the interior girder o f bridges with girder spacing o f 2000 mm. It can be observed that moment distribution factors at ULS have no general trend with increase in bridge span. For example these factors slightly decrease with increase in span length in case of seven-girder and eight girder bridges, while they slightly increase with increase in span length in case o f nine-girder bridges. In case of loading condition for fatigue limit state design, the moment distribution factors decrease with increase in span length. 4.4.2 Shear D istribution Factors Figures 4.28 and 4.29 show selected results for the effect o f the bridge span length on the shear distribution factor for ultimate limit state (ULS) and fatigue limit state (FLS) design, respectively, for the exterior girder o f bndges of 2000 mm girder spacing. It can be observed that bridge span length has insignificant effect on the shear distribution factors at ULS design. However, these factors increase with increase in span length in case o f FLS 57

design. Figures 4.30 and 4.31 show similar graphs for the interior girder. It can be observed that no general trend is observed in the change in shear distribution factor at ULS with increase in span length, while it decreases with increase in span length at FLS. 4.4.3 Deflection D istribution Factors Figures 4.32 and 4.33 show selected results for the effect o f the bridge span length on the deflection distribution factor for ULS and FLS design, respectively, for the exterior girder o f bridges o f 2000 mm girder spacing. It can be observed that bridge span length has insignificant effect on the deflection distribution factors at ULS. However, these factors increase with increase in span length. Figures 4.34 and 4.35 show similar graphs for the interior girder. It can be observed that no general trend is observed in the change in

deflection distribution factors at ULS with the increase in span length, while it decreases with increase in span length for FLS.

4.5

Effect of Number of Design Lanes
Figures 4.36 and 4.37 show selected results for the effect o f the number o f the

design lanes (AO on the moment distribution factor for ultimate limit state (ULS) and fatigue limit state designs (FLS), respectively, for the exterior girder of 25 m span bridges. Figures 4.38 and 4.39 show similar graphs for the interior girders. The figures include the distribution factors for bridges with 2.0, 2.2 and 2.4 m girder spacing for the sake of broadening the comparison. Generally, it can be observed that the moment distribution factor increases with increase in number o f design lanes. Also, these figures show that the results obtained from the finite element analysis follow similar trend as those obtained from CHBDC equations.
58

Figures 4.40 and 4.41 show shear distribution factors for ultimate limit state (ULS) and fatigue limit state (FLS) designs, respectively, for the exterior girder o f 25 m span bridges. Figures 4.42 and 4.43 show similar graphs for the interior girders. Also, Figures 4.44 to 4.47 show similar graphs but for the deflection distribution factors. It can be

observed that both the shear and deflection distribution factors at ULS and FLS generally increase with increase in number o f design lanes. For example, the shear distribution factor for ULS for the exterior girder of 25 m span bridge with 3 design lanes is 1.32, while it is 1.78 for a similar bridge but with 5 design lanes (an increase o f about 35%).

4.6

Effect of Number of Girders
Figures 4.48 and 4.49 show the change in number of girders on the moment

distribution factor for ULS and FLS designs, respectively, for the exterior girder o f bridges of 25 m spans and 2.2 m girder spacing. Figures 4.50 and 4.51 show similar graphs for the interior girders. It can be observed that the moment distribution factor for ULS design does not change significantly with the increase in number o f girder in case o f no presence of the intermediate diaphragms. However, a slight increase in the moment distribution factor is observed with the increase in number of girders in case o f the presence o f intermediate diaphragms. In case o f FLS design, it can be observed that the moment distribution factor significantly increases with increase in number o f girders. Figures 4.52 and 4.53 depict the change in number o f girders on the shear distribution factor for ULS and FLS designs, respectively, for the exterior girder o f bridges of 25 m spans and 2.2 m girder spacing. Figures 4.54 and 4.55 show similar graphs for the interior girders. It can be observed that the shear distribution factor generally increases with
59

increase in number o f girders irrespective o f the presence o f the intermediate diaphragms. For example, the shear distribution factor for FLS for the interior girder o f 25 m span bridge with 6 girders and 1 intermediate diaphragm is 3.35, while it is 4.42 for a similar bridge but with 8 girders (an increase o f about 32%). Figures 4.56 and 4.57 depict the change in the deflection distribution factor with the change in number o f girders for ULS and FLS designs, for the exterior girder o f bridges of 25 m span and 2.2 girder spacing. Figures 4.58 and 4.59 show similar results in case of the interior girder. It can be observed that the deflection distribution factor for FLS design significantly increases with increase in number for girders, with little effect in case o f ULS design. For example, the deflection distribution factor for ULS for the exterior girder o f 25 m span bridge with 6 girders and no intermediate diaphragm is 1.04, while it is 1.09 for a similar bridge but with 8 girders (an increase o f about 5%).

4.7

Evaluation of CHBDC Distribution Factors
To evaluate the empirical formulas for load distribution factors specified for the

simplified method o f analysis in CHBDC for slab-on-girder bridges, the results from the finite-element analysis, and the corresponding values calculated in accordance with CHBDC equations are presented. It should be noted that CHBDC load distribution factors were

developed based on slab-on-girder bndges configurations with no intermediate diaphragms, but with only end diaphragms located along the support lines. It should be noted that the results presented earlier in this chapter indicate that the presence o f intermediate diaphragms generally has a significant effect on the values of moment and shear distribution factors at ULS and FLS. As a result, three set o f graphs are presented here for bridges with no
60

intermediate diaphragms, bridges with one intermediate diaphragms and bridges with two intermediate diaphragms, respectively. Since, the CHBDC simplified method o f analysis provides one expression for both deflection and bending moment distribution factors at ULS and FLS, it is interesting to investigate the correlation between both factors resulted from the PEA. Figures 4.60 and 4.61 present the comparison between the deflection distribution factors and the

corresponding bending moment factors for exterior and interior girders, respectively. It can be observed from Figure 4.60 that the deflection distribution factors for exterior girders, resulting from the FEA, are higher than those for the bending moment (within about 5% difference). However for interior girders, it can be observed from Figure 4.61 that the

deflection distribution factors, resulting from the FEA, are lower than those for the bending moment (within 5% difference). Figures 4.62 and 4.63 are similar to Figures 4.60 and 4.61 but for load distribution factors at FLS. It can be observed that the deflection distribution factors for the exterior girders are higher than the corresponding moment distribution factors (with maximum difference o f about 25%). However, the deflection distribution factors for the interior girders are lower than the corresponding moment distribution factor at FLS (with a maximum o f 20%). For bridges with no intermediate diaphragms, Figures 4.64 and 4.65 shows the correlation between the moment distribution factors for the exterior girder as obtained from the finite element analysis and the corresponding CHBDC moment distribution factors from the equations presented in chapter 2. Figures 4.66 and 4.67 depict similar graphs but for the interior girders. Also, Figures 4.68 to 4.71 presents the correlation between the shear distribution factors for the exterior and interior girders for both ULS and FLS design. While
61

Figures 4.72 to 4.75 show the correlation between the deflection distribution factors for both the ULS and FLS designs o f the exterior and interior girders. One may observe that

CHBDC simplified method o f analysis provide highly conservative values for moment, shear deflection distribution factors for the exterior girders. For example, for moment

distribution, shear and deflection distribution factors for the exterior girder, o f 8 girders o f 2.2 m spacing and 25 m span bridge, are 1.68, 1.73 and 1.68 as obtained from CHBDC expressions shown in chapter 2. The corresponding values as obtained from finite-element analysis are 1.05, 1.36 and 1.07, respectively (an overestimation o f 38%, 21% and 36%, respectively). Similar trend is observed in the case of the interior girder except for the shear distribution factors for the interior girders. Figure 4.70 shows that in many cases, CHBDC expressions underestimate the shear distribution factor for the interior girder at ULS. For example, at a CHBDC shear distribution factor of 1.77, for 9 girders and 20 m span bridge, the corresponding value obtained from the finite-element analysis is 1.92 (an

underestimation o f about 8%). Also, Figure 4.71 shows a similar underestimation o f the shear distribution factors o f the interior girder for FLS design when using the CHBDC expressions. For example, for a fatigue shear distribution factor o f the interior girder o f 3.33, for 5 girders and 20 m span bridge, the corresponding value as obtained from the finite element analysis is 3.56 (an underestimation o f about 7%). In case o f bridges with one intermediate diaphragm. Figures 4.76 to 4.87 show the correlation between the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors for the exterior and interior girders as obtained from CHBDC simplified design method and the finite element analysis. One may observe that CHBDC expressions provide highly conservative
62

values, when compared to those obtained from the finite element analysis, in many cases expect for moment distribution factors for FLS design shown in Figure 4.79. Figures 4.77 and 4.82 show few bridges with underestimated values. However, the differences between CHBDC values and the corresponding values from the finite element analysis are within 5% and considered acceptable from the engineenng point of view. Figures 4.88 to 4.99 show the third sets of graphs representing bridges with two intermediate diaphragms. It can be observed that CHBDC simplified method o f analysis provides load distribution factors that are highly conservatisme when compared to the corresponding values obtained from the finite element analysis. The only exception of this observation is the shear distribution factor values for the interior girder at ULS design shown in Figure 4.94. However, the underestimation is this particular case is within 5% as depicted in Figure 4.94. Figures 4.100 to 4. I l l combine all the results for the cases o f no intermediate diaphragm, one intermediate diaphragm and two intermediate diaphragms for the sake o f visualizing the trend associated with the presence o f diaphragms. However, for the sake o f upgrading the CHDBC simplified method o f analysis for slab-on-girder bridges based on the aforementioned findings, it was decided to develop a new set o f load distribution factors for moment and shear at both the ULS and FLS levels for bridges with no intermediate diaphragms.

Proposed Expressions for the Load Distribution Factors for WideFlange CPCI Girder Bridges
Based in the data generated from the parametric study on wide-fiange CPCI girder

bridges with no intermediate diaphragms, a statistical package o f curve fit was used to
63

develop expressions for the moment and shear distribution factors at ULS and FLS levels for the exterior and interior girders. The following expressions were derived in the same format, as those originally exist in CHBDC for slab-on-girder bridges. 1) For moment distribution factor for the exterior girder at SLS and ULS:

Figures 4.112 to 4.119 show the correlation between the developed expressions and the corresponding values as obtained from the finite element analysis. It can be

observed that the proposed expressions provide closer values to those obtained from finite element analysis than those obtained from the currently available CHBDC simplified method o f analysis shown m Figures 4.64 to 4.71. It should be noted that the above expressions are length ranging from applicable only to wide-fiange CPCIgirder bridges with span

20 to35m,numbero f girders ranging from 5 to9, number o f design

lanes ranging from 3 to 5, girder spacing ranging from 2.0 to 2.4 m and for CHBDC truck loading.

CHAPTER V

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1 General
A practical-design-oriented parametric study, using finite element method, was conducted to investigate the static response o f Wide-Flange CPCI girder bridges o f different configurations and truck loading conditions. A literature review was provided in order to establish the bases o f this study. The influence o f several key parameters on the moment, deflection and shear distribution factors for ultimate, serviceability and fatigue limit states designs was examined with the commercially available finite-element computer program "SAP2000". The key parameters considered in this study included span length, number o f lanes, number of girders, live load loading conditions, presence o f intermediate diaphragms, and type o f longitudinal joints between individual girders.

5.2

Conclusions
Based on the results from the parametric study, the following conclusions are

drawn: 1- The type o f the connection between flanges o f the precast wide-fiange girder is an important parameter that infiuences the distribution factors in WF-CPCI girder bridges. The sensitivity study for the type o f connections indicated that the continuous connections provide better load distribution to the girders than the intermittent connections. 2- The connections between flanges o f WF-CPCI exhibit high shear force with
67

negligible bending moment. The shear force significantly increases with the increase in spacing between connections. 3- Bridge span length, number o f girder and number o f design lanes play a significant role on the value o f the load distribution factors for the exterior and interior girders. 4- The presence o f the intermediate diaphragms improves the distribution o f loads on girders. 5' CHBDC load distribution factors generally overestimate the structural response o f bridges, with a significant margin in many bridge geometries. A few cases were observed for the interior girders where CHBDC simplified method o f analysis underestimates the shear distribution factors by a maximum o f 8%. 6- Deflection distribution factors are always higher than the corresponding moment distribution factors for exterior girders and vice versa in case o f the interior girder. 7- The database generated from the parametric study was used to develop expressions for moment and shear distribution factors at ULS and FLS design for the exterior and interior girders o f bridges without intermediate diaphragms. These proposed expressions can predict the design parameters more economically and reliably when compared to the available CHBDC simplified method o f analysis.

68

5.3

Recommendations for Future Research

It is recommended that further research efforts be directed towards the following aspects: 1- The study o f load distribution factors for bridges with no shoulder conditions. 2- Investigation o f end restraints on the load distribution factors o f WF-CPCI girders if used for integral or semi-integral type bridges. 3- Investigate the effect o f material and geometric nonlinearity on the load distribution factors o f such bridges. 4- Study time-dependant effects on such bridges when span continuity is considered.
