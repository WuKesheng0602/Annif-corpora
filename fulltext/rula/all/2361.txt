ABSTRACT
The Mass Driver Project A Preliminary Design O f a Material Transfer System For Space Construction Projects Using Open Source Design Principles Masters o f Applied Science, October 2005. - Mechanical Engineering--Ryerson University Dean Anthony Marjan Gerl

This project attempts to adapt open source software development principles to the evaluation and design of a mass driver system capable of transporting construction material from the Earth's surface to orbit as a stream of inline, discrete material packages following one after another. The design process does not identify any `show stopper* physical effects. The final design of the system proposes using a novel launch rail concept to send a stream of 10 kg material packages to a 10 000 km apogee altitude, where a rocket motor fires to place the material package into a highly elliptical orbit A satellite, in a similar orbit, collects the material packages and distributes them to a space construction project Further work is required to evaluate the

aerodynamic issues related to the material package stream. Open source collaboration on the design did not occur; however seven potential collaborators were identified.

Chapter 1 Introduction to the Mass Driver Project
1.1 Introduction - The Mass Driver Project
Large scale commercialization and development of space near Earth is hindered by the high cost of transporting material to space using current rocket technology; presently, the cost is approximately $22 000 US/kg [1]. Much of this cost is due to the fact that rockets are not efficient, only approximately 5% of the takeoff mass of a large rocket is payload that reaches orbit The rest of the rocket mass is 85% fuel and 10% propulsion machinery, which are discarded along the flight to orbit [2]. Smaller rockets have a payload mass that is less than 3% of the takeoff mass, with the remaining mass dedicated to fuel and propulsion [3]. It is unlikely that further substantial cost reductions in current rocket technology is possible, given that globally, at this time, approximately $1 trillion dollars have been spent on rocket research, development and operations. Present rocket technology represents a mature technology [2]. Therefore, to get material firom Earth's surface to orbit, at a substantially lower cost, a new launch technology must be developed. Rocket research, development and operation programs have mainly been done by government agencies, government contracted organizations and government funded educational institutions. Using a traditional development method to create a new, lower cost space launch method would likely require a substantial political commitment and public funding. Therefore, the large scale development and commercialization of space is restricted because it is currently too expensive to rocket material up from Earth; yet, researching and developing a new, cheap launch technology is also too expensive to develop using traditional means. A possible solution to this conflict is to reduce the cost of researching and developing the new launch technology. To reduce the development costs, this project investigates using the Open Source Software (OSS) development model to evaluate the use of mass driver technology to deliver a series of small material packages to Earth orbit Section 1.4 introduces the mass driver material package stream transport system (MPSTS) that was proposed by Mr. Ed Panzeria, President of Axiomatic Product Development (APD) Ltd.

1.2

What is Open Source Software?
Open Source Software (OSS) is considered any software product that has the original

source code for software available to the public for use and/or modification at no cost Two factors created the OSS development process, firstly, the need for high quality web server and operating system software and secondly, a social backlash ^ the developer community) against corporate monopolization of the software market A group of programmers, who essentially shared the aforementioned views, formed a volunteer community to collaborate via the internet and create successful high quality software products like the Apache web server and Linux operating system [4]. OSS development is very cost effective because the volunteer community writes, tests and documents the software product for no monetary compensation. The compensation the volunteer community receives is a software product that likely better suits their needs than anything commercially available and the opportunity to meet and work with people with Section 2.1 explains the organization of typical OSS projects.

Open Source + Engineering = Open Engineering
The application of OSS development principles to engineering design and development

has been termed Open Engineering (OE) by Professor P. A. Salustri. A research goal, for this project, is to investigate the effectiveness of implementing the Open
E n g in eerin g

concept for a

space technology project that requires the effort of a multidisciplinary team of experts. A space technology development project was chosen as an open engineering subject mainly for two reasons. Firstly, the potential for conflicts of interest for participants and their present employers is low, since, few commercial enterprises are researching alternative space launch technology. Secondly, developing an alternative space launch technology requires a multidisciplinary development team, comprised of professionals firom science, engineering and business. An open source project has the potential to attract a broad range of people to form a collaborative multidisciplinary development team. The cost of employing a multidisciplinary development team for a space technology project would be very high; therefore, using an open source model could be

very cost effective. If the OE concept can be implemented for a complex space technology project; it is likely that the OE concept can be applied to many other fields of engineering. When this project was conceived, it was beUeved that this was the first OE project However, through the literature review performed, it was determined that at least three previous OE projects have been attempted, the open source car (OSCar) project, the OpenCores project and the ThinkCycle project projects. Section 2.2 in Chapter two provides the details of these three

Mass Driver - Material Package Stream Transport Concept
Intuitively, one of the simplest space launch systems would have a launch mechanism on

the ground that would impart the payload with enough momentum (velocity and energy) to reach orbit This idea o f using a single hnpulse or directly launching payload from Earth surface to orbit dates at least as far as Newton's thought experiment with a cannon on the side of a high mountain. Newton rationalized, that if a cannon mounted on the top of a very tall mountain, could fire a cannon ball at the appropriate velocity, the cannon ball would perpetually fall towards Earth or orbit Earth [3]. Research into a sin^e impulse or direct method of launching material into space has been on going since Newton's thought experiment The research into direct space launch technology has followed the research advancement of military gun technology. The original concepts simply used large gun powder cannons to fire material into space. As gun technology advanced, the space launch concepts envisioned using electromagnetic guns as a practical means of launching payloads to space. In the 1970's, Dr. G. O'Neill proposed the use of an electromagnetically driven launch tube named a mass driver to launch lunar soil from the Moon's surface; since then, the term mass driver is commonly used for electromagnetic launchers [3]. Sections 2.3 reviews some of the previously proposed direct launch concepts. Section 2.4 reviews two space plane concepts and Section 2.5 reviews the common launcher technology proposed for direct space launch. Presently, all material arrives in Earth orbit eidier on a rocket or the Space Shuttle, therefore no direct space launch method has been successfully implemented. Many of the

previously proposed space launch methods assumed the launch of large satellite sized payloads. 3

Mr. Ed Panzeria, of APD Ltd., proposed a space launch concept that is similar to the performance of a pitcher and catcher at a baseball game. The pitcher is responsible for accurately propelling the ball to the vicinity of the catcher and the catcher is responsible for positioning the glove to catch the ball. The ball is responsible for traveling the path from the pitcher to the catcher in a predictable manner. To allow the ball to be caught properly, the pitcher and catcher communicate with each other to ensure they both know the behavior of the ball. For Mr. Panzeria's concept, the pitcher is replaced by a mass driver launch mechanism, the catcher is substituted by an orbiting `catcher' satellite and the ball is substituted with a small payload of raw material, known as a material package (MP). Figure 1.1 depicts the `catcher' satellite (CatSat) capturing a stream of material packages (shown in red). The

performance of the mass driver launcher is nearly the same a baseball pitcher, except a series of balls or material packages are rapidly launched one after another to form a material package stream. It is assumed that the sequential launch of MPs could create a tunnel or corridor of low-density air through The series of material packages r 6 Figure 1.1: Material Stream Mass could be visualized as a cable or string extending from Driver Concept [5]

the atmosphere.

the launcher up through the atmosphere to a `catcher' satellite (CatSat).

Once the

m aterial

packages reach the vicinity of the CatSat, the satellite positions itself to capture the MP stream. Therefore, like the baseball, the MPs are merely responsible for traveling in a predictable manner through the atmosphere, the mass driver and CatSat have the `brains' to control the flight and capture of the material package. Once the MPs have been captured by the CatSat, they are either utilized for an onboard manufacturing process or bundled together and launched to an appropriate space construction location.

Mr. E. Panzeria's concept will be referred to as the material package stream transport system (MPSTS) or the open mass driver system (OpenMDS) in subsequent Sections of this document Section 2.5 and 2.6 will review the previously proposed launch mechanisms and

`catcher* satellite concepts that would be considered for use in the mass driver system design. Section 2.7 reviews tentative space construction projects that the mass driver system could be used for the supply of raw material. The mass driver system is presumed to be more beneficial than other direct space launch systems primarily for two reasons: 1. The drag reduction experienced by the series of material packages might significantly reduce the launch requirements to reach orbit Therefore, the design of the launch mechanism might be of lower performance than previously proposed direct launch systems. 2. The material package mass is intended to be small, in the order of grams to kilograms. Therefore the design of the launch mechanism should be easier since the performance requirements should be lower than previously proposed launch systems which tend to be designed for hundreds to thousands of kilogram launch masses. The goal of this thesis project was to establish an open engineering development community to design and evaluate the physical feasibility and design of the aforementioned mass driver system. Chapters 3 and 4 will detail the preliminary design and feasibility review for the ttiass driver system performed solely by the author. Chapter 5 will review the efforts to establish a development community for the project and the design results of the development community. Chapter 6 is summarizes the design process and has recommendations for further work.

Chapter 2 Literature Review
2.1 Open Source Software (OSS) Development
At this time, there is no standard method for organizing an Open Source Software (OSS) project; however, there is a general structure. Typically a founding person* or group of dedicated experts'' initiates the project and the combined work of a community of volunteers advances the project The fundamental tasks of the founding person or group are the same [4]: 1. State the requirements for the software product 2. Divide the software product into work modules. 3. Present and promote the project on the Internet 4. Select the `best' efforts (code and documentation) of the developer community for compilation into a functional new version of the software product Note that item #2 requires the founder(s) to complete a significant amount of system design of the software product before dividing the work. The developer community then is responsible for the following [4]: 1. Writing the programming code to complete the work modules. 2. Create documents explaining how code modules operate. 3. Create user manuals for the software product. 4. Test the functional versions of the software product for errors. 5. Report errors in the software product to the developer community. 6. Create and submit `fixes' for the reported errors. The development pace of an OSS project typically depends on the number of developers participating and their skill and enthusiasm. Many OS projects do not proceed or succeed because

* Linus Torvalds for the Linux operating system for example b An expert group for the Apache web server for example
6

the project fails to attract or keep a critical number of active developers. This critical number is unknown and variable [4]. A larger development group generally leads to a higher quality product because there are more
eyes

to find the errors and there is more competition amongst the developers to create

superior work. From case studies [4], it seems the successful OSS projects require a dedicated founding group to create a preliminary `prototype' version of the software product to attract other developers. The Linux operating system began as a hobby of Linus Torvalds to create an operating system for his personal computer. He initially posted a message on Usenet as a survty of what people like and dislike about available operating systems. In few weeks, he then wrote Linux 0.01 himself and made it available to others on the internet Enthusiasm for the Linux 0.01 was immediate; others downloaded, tested, tweaked and sent the modifications back to Torvalds. At the time of writing, this development cycle for Linux still continues to improve the program [6]. The purpose of the preliminary version of the software is to demonstrate the potential benefits and usefulness of the software product and the ability and dedication of the current project members. New members join feeling confident the project will continue and their works have the potential of becoming part of the product The OSS development method can be considered more of an optimization process; the `prototype' product created by the founder, is augmented by development community according to the `wish' list created by the founding group. It is not known if an OSS project that requires discovering new knowledge or developing new technology can be successful [4].

2.1.1

Advantages of OSS Development
OSS development has created products that are of high quality and compete with OSS development process has the following advantages as

commercial software products.

compared to commercial software development [4]:

1. A . H ig h ly P a ra llel D evelopm ent Process th a t Increases the Speed a n d Q u a lity o f D evelopm ent

As mentioned in the previous Section, the project founder divides the project into a number of separate, independent work rnodules. Since each module can be worked on separately, the speed of the completion of the entire program can be greatly accelerated. Successful open source projects have a developer community that can be much larger than any commercial enterprise. Therefore, an open source project can be completed more quickly than commercial products because there is simply more people to work on the work modules. Since there can be a large number of developers working on a project, it is common that many developers are working on the same work modules independently. This redundancy of labour in a commercial project could be viewed as a wasteful use of resources; however for an OSS project, since labour is essentially free, this redundancy is a powerful advantage because it creates competition among devciopers. Since, only the best work module will be selected to be included in the final version of the software product, developers will strive hard to ensure they submit the best work they can to ensure their work is included in the final product Therefore, this redundancy of labour in OSS projects improves the quality of the product
2. Involves a C om m unity o f G lobalty D istrib u ted D evelopers

Large open source projects have the potential to attract developers from around the world. Internet technology allows users from around the world to partidpate and benefit from the project The partidpation of people from different countries can identify spedal needs of people around the world, thus, the software product is more universally useable and more suitable for global markets.
3. U tili:(es a T ru ly Independent P eer R evieiv Process

Partidpants in an OSS project are not linked together by the traditional business hierarchy and professional or personal associations; therefore, the work submitted to the project recdves an unbiased and honest evaluation of the quality of the work. Since the developer does not know who will be reviewing there code, it is suspected that the developer spends extra time to ensure that the work submitted is of the highest quality. By submitting his best work, the developer is attempting to ensure his work is induded in the final version of the program.

4.

B ugs A r e Q u ic k ly Id en tified a n d F ix e d

Typically, contacting a business to report a problem with their product is not a convenient nor rapid means of fixing your problem. The internet tools implemented by an OSS project allow the person using the software to easily and rapidly communicate with the developer community to report bugs or shortcomings of the software product This rapid communication allows bugs to be reported and fixed and new versions to be released at a rapid rate. This rapid communication between the users and developers improves the quality and usefulness of the software product
5. P roducts are D eveloped hy M o tiva ted a n d D edicated People

Unlike traditional, commercial software organizations, which currently have a problem attracting and retaining appropriately skilled developers, open source projects typically attract a highly dedicated and motivated people due to the nature of the project The reputation of some highly, skilled developers working on the OSS project may help to attract more people to the project for the opportunity to work with these individuals and view there work. Since all

participants of OSS projects are volunteers, these participants must have a genuine interest in the product and a desire to produce a successful product Typically, people are participating in the project because they want to use the software product or enjoy solving challenging problems.
6. U sers are H ig k fi Involved in the D evelopm ent

User involvement is important for developing a software product that fulfills the needs of the user. OSS projects require that, like the developer, the user be highly involved in the

development process, because the users typically are responsible for testing, reporting bugs, creating documentation and defining the program requirements. The Linus Law states that, "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are found"; therefore, a high degree of user involvement should yield a high quality software product.

2.1.2

Software Tools Used for OSS Development
OSS projects lack formal business organization; therefore, it is very important that the

software tools used by OSS projects reduce the amount of managing and co-ordination efforts that are required to be done by the project founder. One of the most common software tools used is Concurrent Versions Systems (CVS). CVS is itself an OSS product CVS was developed

to manage revisions to program codes submitted by developers and provide a means of easily making the most current version of the program code available to the developers and users for downloading. CVS greatly simplifies the file management requirements of the project Internet communication tools like e-mail, newsgroups, discussion boards and web sites are extensively used for communication and collaboration amongst the participants of the OSS projects.

2.1.3 Taboos and Norms in OSS Projects
Many OSS projects have well documented guidelines for participant conduct Most of the guidelines emphasize that every participant must practice respect for one another.

Typical rules are: > Attach your name to all work that you submit. > Plagiarism of code is forbidden; it is never acceptable to remove the name of the original developer from any portion of code and submit it as your own code. > The existing maintainer of a section of code must be respected; if a change is to be made it, the maintainer should be advised. > Every participant in the project is treated as an equal. > All participants should be modest about their work. > Forking of the project into two similar but separate projects must be avoided. 2.2 Open Source Hardware Development
When the Mass Driver project was proposed it was believed that it would be the first attempt at adapting open source principles to the design of a non-software related product However, three open source hardware projects have been identified, the OSCar project, OpenCores and ThinkCycle. The following three Sections discuss each of the projects.

2.2.1 Open Source Car (OSCAR) Project
In Germany in 1999, the OSCar project was founded by Markus Merz, a former BMW manager turned e-commerce consultant, as a project to design a "world" car using open source software principles. The project had the following goals: > Create a superior automobile design, which utilizes a global input of perhaps millions of automotive engineers and enthusiasts rather than input of a few senior executives as per conventional design processes.
>

The automobile design should be modular to allow different design versions to be interchangeable.

10

^ ^

The automobile design should be innovative, incorporating features that not currently available on automobiles. Environmentally fidendly powertrain options, like fuel cells, hybdd-electric or pure electric should be considered as a possible design option. Merz and his consultant company created a web site, www.theOSCarproject.org. which

provided participants with tools such as newsgroups, on-line chat, electronic white boards, forums and databases to aid the design process. The design of the project was separated into work niodules based on BMW's structure, such as a powertrain work module, body work module, electronics work module etc. Merz also created a manifesto, stating the project's goals and principles. This manifesto proclaimed that like OSS projects, all design information will be public knowledge; however, unlike traditional OSS projects, aU major design decisions will be determined by a vote involving aU participants [7]. The project attracted a large community of mostly German automotive design engineers who generaUy had an enthusiasm for cars but experienced creative oppression in their current jobs at large automotive firms. The community decided that the Catia CAD program and its open source clone OpenCascade* would be used as the universal language' for sharing design information. Catia and OpenCascade were chosen because it was familiar to many professionals and both Catia and OpenCascade are capable of operating on home PCs. After approximately 36 months, a final design of the car was achieved and a prototype was built [8]. The prototype was built to entice an automotive manufacture to produce the design; however, at the time of writing, it seems the project failed to attract a manufacture. AdditionaUy, the project was slated to restart in November 2003; however, at the time of writing, the project appears to be at a standstill

2.2.2

OpenCores Project
The OpenCores project was founded by Damjan Lampret, in Slovenia, in 2000, as an

attempt to apply OSS development principles to design of digital circuits, commonly known as `cores'. The cores are a coUection of miUions of digjtal gates that form the integrated circuits that are imprinted on to microchips. The complexity of the cores has increased with the improved performance of microchips; this complexity has caused an increase in the development time and

cost of cotes. To mitigate the increased development time and cost, the OpenCores project proposes creating a library of core designs that are firee for all to use. It is assumed that OpenCore designs would be of high quality since a large user/developer community would exist to create, document and improve the design of OpenCores. Prior to OpenCores, all core designs were purchased from commercial vendors; however, these designs were typically poorly documented and difficult to integrate into the design of the complete microchip. The main objective of the OpenCores project is to develop open source designs for cores that are freely available, usable and reusable. Other objectives for this project are to provide complete documentation for OpenCore designs, develop standards for OpenCore designs and create tools and methods for open source hardware design [9]. At the time of writing, the OpenCores site hosted 247 core projects, with about 51% of these design projects complete and ready for manufacturing. The project organization is similar to open source software projects; each project is started and supported by an individual known as a maintainer. The OpenCores site has a `classified' section to advertise for help on the project An interested individual can view the work modules requiring completion and submit their own work. Like many OSS projects, OpenCores web site uses the CVS program to record the revision history and provide the most current version of the design to the community. The web site also offers, design and testing software to ensure all contributors are using compatible software for the design process. Given that relatively large numbers of OpenCore projects have been complete, the OpenCore project has been successful at attracting a community of developers and users. According the web site, the developer/user community is a dynamic group, meaning that individuals regularly join and leave projects. This group represent a range of people from students to professionals who are primary motivation to participate is entertainment and personal interest [9]. With more than half of the OpenCore projects completed at the time of writing, it suggests that the open source design of computer hardware is viable. At the time of writing, at

12

least one new OpenCore project was created suggesting the growth of the OpenCore site will continue.

2.2.3

ThinkCycle: Open Collaborative Design
The ThinkCycle project is an initiative started by MIT graduate students to attempt to use

open source software development principles to solve humanitarian problems of developing countries. These problems include topics such as increasing food production, providing clean water and providing better healthcare. The idea was to create a web accessible database, at ffiww.thinkcycle.org, that could receive real-world problems for developing countries and provide a space to store all the materials and documents related to the solution of the problem. The name ThinkCycle was chosen because the term summarizes the notion that designing a solution to a problem requires the people to
th in k ,

propose a preliminary design and then repeat this design p/ck

until a satisfactory final design is created [10]. The ThinkCycle concept subsidiary goal was to change the way engineering design is taught at university. Traditional engineering design courses typically give students a problem that already has a solution, therefore, the students can either optimize the existing solution or reinvent the wheel. Engineering designs courses using problems firom ThinkCycle challenge the students to solve real-world problems with no present viable solution. The typical ThinkCycle project proceeds according to the following steps: !· A non-government agency (NGO) or other stakeholder submits a problem to the ThinkCycle web site. 2. Domain experts review the problem and decide if the problem is appropriate to release to the ThinkCycle database. 3. Design faculty select problems firom the ThinkCycle database to issue to their student design teams. 4. Student teams work the problem by brainstorming, setting design restraints, investigating possible technology, proposing preliminary concepts, developing the final design and building prototypes. The information created during each phase of design is posted on the web site in the "ThinkSpace" for the project 5. During step 4, a peer review, by domain experts and other collaborators, occurs to provide advice and resources to the student teams.

13

6. The students end the project with a final report and presentation that is made available to the NGO, other stakeholders and to the public via the web site. Unlike OSS projects, where the developer community could be comprised of nearly anybody, students are mainly responsible for thé design work for ThinkCycle. The roles of the typical non-student participants for a ThinkCycle project are to provide problems, advice and resources to support the student design teams [10]. At the time of writing, the project web site, www.thinkcyc1e.org. had 149 posted problems and 55 design projects working on a solution to a posted problem. Three of these design projects have resulted in the construction of a successful prototype; these projects are an inexpensive device for cholera treatment, a passive incubator for premature infants and bio-sand filters for water treatment. The most successful project was the design of the device for cholera treatment The treatment of cholera typically requires saline to be pumped into the patient Developing countries require inexpensive and easily operated medical equipment to administer saline. The typical devices used for treatment are either a computer controlled IV pump which is easy to use but costly or an IV drip valve that is cheap but not easily used by unskilled people. A group of MIT students, lead by Professor Timothy Prestero, collaborated with physicians and various engineers to explore various possible design concepts for a cheap treatment device. The student team used the suggestions firom the collaborators to propose a concept design that is based on rotameters used by chemical engineers. The proposed device cost about $1.25 to manufacture and is intuitive to use, so even untrained people can use the device. The design is so successful,

negotiations with a medical equipment manufacture occurred and MIT applied for a patent on the device. The other two projects are not as successful and are in the prototype stages. The application for a patent raises a legal issue for open source hardware projects. Should anybody own patent rights to a device whose final design is the result of contributed work of many people and all the design work is publicly available on the internet?

Proposed Direct Space Launch Systems
Directly launching a payload from Earth surface to space has several advantages over using

a conventional rocket to place material into space. Firstly, a direct launch system potentially can offer substantially lower launch costs because most of the infirastructure for the system is reusable 14

and remains on Earth; unlike rockets which are costly, complex, single use machines. Also the recurring launch costs of a direct space launch are low, since ideally only the launch eneigy input and the launch vehicle are consumed during each launch. Launching bodies at hypersonic

velocities is advantageous since the aerodynamic drag approaches a minimum value at high hypersonic velocities (Mach 7 and greater see Figure 3.7 for example). Therefore, launching bodies at high hypersonic velocities is energy efficient since the drag is reduced. The total mass of these launch bodies is also reduced since it does not require a propulsion system for atmospheric flight A body launched directly firom Earth has a few limitations. A body directly launched firom Earth wiU travel a ballistic trajectory that will return to Earth unless either a second impulse (propulsive force) occurs to place the body in Earth orbit or the body escapes Earth's gravity field. Launching projectiles at high hypersonic speeds firom the Earth surface is technically difficult to achieve. The design of these launch bodies is complicated by the high mechanical and thermal loads. The design of the launcher mechanism is difficult because the launch process requires the launch vehicle to achieve high velocity and eneigy in a short time period. Many concepts have been proposed; however, the research into the technology for hypersonic launch of large projectiles is not sufficiently mature. The following sub-Sections of 2.3 review a few of the previously proposed direct launch concepts. These concepts range firom systems that are technically feasible with present technology to concepts that will be feasible in the future when the required technology and materials mature. The sub-Section of 2.3 is intended to introduce the complete launch system concepts. Section 2.4 will review two space launch concepts that can be considered the alternative to expendable rockets and direct space launch, the space plane. Section 2.5 wiU review the hypervelocity launcher devices proposed for direct space launches. Section 2.5 is intended to explain basic operating principles of most of the launcher technologies mentioned in direct space launch concepts of Section 2.3.

2.3.1

Bishop South Pole Accelerator
When the Mass Driver project was initiated, it was assumed that launching a series of

bodies one after another firom Earth surface to orbit was an original idea. However, through the literature review, it was determined that Mr. Forrest Bishop proposed a similar concept in his 15

unpublished work on the concept entitled the

South Po/e A ccekrator

in 1981 [11].

F. Bishop

proposed using an electromagnetic coil launcher situated at the South Pole to launch a series of slender bodies, one after another. Bishop proposed that this rapid launch of in-line bodies would create a launch corridor' of rarified air (plasma) through the atmosphere. To maintain the `launch corridor'. Bishop estimated a launch frequency of at least 10 Hz was necessary. He su^ested that the launch bodies could be coated with solid hydrogen or ice to help reduce the density of the air in the launch corridor and thermally protect the launch body. The launch bodies are to travel to a very high altitude where Earth's gravity force nearly matches the gravity force of the Sun. At this altitude, a miniature attitude control system could be used to position the launch body in Earth orbit with minimal additional propulsive impulse [11]. Mr. Bishop was contacted regarding providing further details of his concept, particularly the launch corridor. He responded that he would find his notes on the concept and post the information on his web site. At the time of writing, the details of the launch corridor did not appear on Mr. Bishop's web site.

2.3.2

ESA Nano-Satellite Rail Launcher
The European Space Agency (ESA) considered the feasibility of augmenting their current

Pegasus railgun technology to be capable of launching small payloads to sub-orbital and orbital destinations. The development plan for this launcher is proposed to occur in two stages [12]. First, the sub-orbital launcher would be developed to launch 4 kg payloads to an altitude of 115 km. This sub-orbital launcher is intended to be a more cost-effective means of launching experimental payloads that are currently launched using sounding rockets. It was determined that a slender, cylindrical vehicle could be launched with a velocity of 2.15 km/s, at angle of 85° from the horizontal, would reach an altitude of 115 km. This vehicle would be 4 kg total mass,

Figure 2.1: Proposed ESA Sub-Orbital Rail Launched Vehicle [12]

including a 1 kg payload, and Have a diameter of 50 mm and a length of 540 mm. Figure 1.2 depicts the proposed sub-orbital launch vehicle. A CFD analysis, for the sub-orbital launch, determined that the vehicle would experience the maximum temperature of 1034K at the nose cone, approximately 0.1 seconds after launch. The duration of significant atmospheric heating would be approximately 40 seconds. Given these thermal conditions, it was concluded that conventional metals or high temperature composites would be suitable materials for the thermal loads. The railgun launcher required to launch this sub-orbital projectile was determined to be approximately four times larger than the current Pegasus research facility. The length of the launcher would be about 22 meters and the energy bank would be 30 MJ. The efficiency of the railgun launcher was estimated to be about 30%. The second stage of the development proposes a railgun launcher capable of placing 5 kg nano-satellite payloads into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The cost of launching these nano-satellites is intended to be cheaper than the current cost range of about $950, 000 to $1 500 000 for piggy back rides on large conventional rocket missions. The launch velocity, to reach LEO, was

determined to be approximately 6 km /s at a launch angle of about 30° from the horizontal. The launch vehicle that would carry the 5 kg nano-satellite payload, would be a long slender cylinder with a diameter of 120 mm, a length of 2900 mm and a total mass of about 41 kg. The payload ntass fraction for this concept would be about 12.2%. The vehicle total mass includes the mass of a hybrid rocket motor for orbital insertion of the satellite. Solid and liquid rocket motors were also considered, however, neither was selected since the solid fuel has a potential to be damaged during launch and liquid fuel propulsion was 5 kg heavier than the hybrid propulsion. Figure 2.2 depicts the proposed orbital launch vehicle. A CFD analysis for the orbital vehicle launch, determined the thermal load on the vehicle to be significantly greater than the sub-orbital case. At 0.1 seconds after launch, the vehicle experiences a maximum temperature at the tip of the nose cone of 2900 K and 1700 K at the leading edges of the fins. The duration of the atmospheric heating was determined to be

17

approximately 20 seconds. It is likely that conventional refractory materials could be used as thermal protection.

L-flKOm»

Figure 2.2: Proposed ESA Orbital Rail Launched Vehicle [12]
The railgun required to launch the orbital projectile is about 180 m in length, about 30 times longer than the Pegasus facility, and the energy bank is 3.5 GJ, which is about 350 times larger than the Pegasus facility. The study concluded the feasibility of both launchers is possible, however technical challenges exist A staged approach to development would be beneficial since it allows the experience and technology improvements to be incorporated into the subsequent launcher design.

2.3.3

McNab's Rail Launcher Concept
Mr. Ian McNab proposed a direct launch concept similar to the ESA orbital rail launcher.

McNab's goal was to create a direct launcher capable of directly launching a 1000 kg vehicle from the Earth surface to LEO at a frequency of a few launches per day [13]. McNab and Dr. M. ErengU first performed an analysis to determine a satisfactory launch velocity, launch angle, payload mass and orbital altitude. McNab and ErengU assumed the launch vehicle was a Rodman cone, with a base diameter of 1 meters and a length of 6 meters, and the vehicle was launched from an equatorial location, at a 2000 meter elevation. Figure 2.3 depicts the concept for the launch vehicle. From this analysis, they determined that a launch velocity of 7.5 km /s at an angle of 17.5° from the vertical would be capable of placing a 254 kg payload in a 544 km orbit The payload mass fraction of this concept would be about 25.4%. At 100% launcher

18

efficiency, the launch would require 35 GJ of energy. This launch scenario represents a compromise between maximizing the mass of payload arid minimizing the required launch velocity. The analysis did not consider the mass required for thermal protection, attitude control or vehicle docking/retrieval.

Figure 2.3: McNab Launch Vehicle Concept [13]

McNab considered eight different launch technologies, namely railguns, coilguns, electrothermal chemical guns, light gas guns, RAM accelerator, blast wave accelerator, slingatron and laser launchers. Railgun technology was selected since experimental results have demonstrated it can achieve a launch velocity of 7.5 km/s for small masses and further military railgun research was expected to occur. Railgun research is important for this concept since current railgun

technology can not supply the required 35 GJ of energy to the launch body. McNab concluded that the d e si^ of a railgun direct launcher was not impeded by any physical barriers and the cost of launching material to space could be as low as $528/kg. Before a detailed design of the system occurs, McNab recommended a number of issues must be investigated. Most significantly, the performance of railguns operating with large launch masses must be tested and verified. The useful lifetime of present railgun design must be increased to ensure a launch system is capable of frequent launches. Additionally, the thermal protection and aerodynamic conditions affecting the projectile must be analyzed in detail.

2.3.4

DARPA Satellite Light Gas Gun Launch Concept
The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) funded a study to investigate

the technical and economic feasibility of directly launching a constellation of small communication satellites, each with a mass ranging firom 10 kg to 1000 kg, to a 700 km circular LEO [14]. The study proposed utilizing light gas gun technology. Unlike other launch technologies, iight gas guns have a proven capability of routinely achieving the launch of small masses to high velocities. Hypervelodty experiments routinely use light gas guns to achieve velocities of 8 km/s. 19

A dominant goal for the proposed light gas gun launch system is it must be affordable. It was decided that launching a satellite payload with a mass of 113 kg (250 lb) would represent a good compromise between the estimated $2 billion for a system for launching 1000 kg satellite payload and the limited capability of a 10 kg satellite launcher. The total launch mass was estimated to be about 682 kg which includes the 113 kg satellite payload, 223 kg carbon composite thermal protection system, 14 kg hydrazine fuelled attitude control system and a 250 kg solid rocket motor. The payload mass fraction was estimated to be about 16.5%. The solid rocket motor is capable of supplying a velocity change of 2.1 km/s to circularize the satellite in a 700 km orbit The launch vehicle is a slender cone with a length to diameter ratio of 11. The structural mass of the vehicle is reduced by situating the satellite payload at the base of the cone and the delicate rocket motor at the top of the cone. Figure 2.4 depicts the conceptual design of the launch vehicle. The launch velocity for the vehicle to reach a 700 km orbit is estimated to be 7 km/s at a 20 degree launch angle.

Figure 2.4: DARPA Launch Vehicle Concept [14]

The proposed light gas gun required to launch the vehicle has a length of 1.52 km, a bore of 0.635 m (25 in) and would require about 2 700 tonnes of high quality steel. Instead of just injecting hydrogen gas at the breech of the launch tube, the study proposed that fifteen injectors distributed along the side of the launch tube could be used to achieve a nearly constant acceleration of the launch vehicle. Each gas injector requires a fast acting valve capable handling high pressure, about 70 MPa or 10 000 psi, and have an opening time of about 1 ms. The cost of the hydrogen gas required for each launch represents about $700/kg of the launch cost; to reduce the launch costs it was recommended that the gas should be recycled at the end of the launch. To recycle the gas, the end of the launch tube requires a fast acting valve to allow the vehicle to exit without allowing the hydrogen to escape. The study concluded that using a light gas gun is technically and economically feasible. Further work is required to evaluate the design of the thermal protection system and the aerodynamic stability of the launch vehicle; however, a successful design is likely with current

20

materials and methods. The development of the fast acting valves for the hydrogen injectors was identified as critical issue for the design of the light gas gun launcher. The study considered the tentative design of a 113 kg communication satellite payload and concluded that this mass is likely too small to be useful for communication satellites. About 75% of the 113 kg satellite mass would be structural material and a solar power energy generation system. Only about 3.2 kg would be available for the components for the communication satellite. Therefore, the study concluded that the 113 kg satellite payload would be useful for satellites that require smaller solar power systems. Further investigation would be required to determine the optimum mass of a communication satellite. The cost to launch the 113 kg payload was estimated to be about $5500/kg, assuming 300 satellites are launched per year. The cost is comparable to low cost Russian rocket launches but much lower than other rockets systems.

Palmer and Dabiri Electromagnetic Launcher Concept
Miles Palmer and All Dabiri proposed creating an electromagnetic launch system capable

of launching a 1 kg nano-satellite payload into LEO. The authors proposed that these small payloads can be small independent satellites or a part of a constellation of satellites in LEO as a replacement for a geosynchronous communications satellite. Alternatively, the payload launched can be used to send a resupply or refueling vehicle to satellites or space stations [15]. Palmer and Dabiri performed a detailed analysis to determine the launch parameters capable of placing a 1 kg satellite in LEO with minimal launch energy. The analysis included the variation of rocket motor mass needed for different launch parameter and the variation of the coolant mass need for cooling the projectile during atmospheric transit for different launch parameters. The analysis determined that the optimum launch velocity was about 5.5 km/s and the optimum launch angle was in the range of 22 -26°, these parameters minimized the launch energy to 1400 MJ (assuming 100% efficiency). The total mass of the launch projectile was estimated to be 18.6 kg, including 0.3 kg of coolant mass. The payload mass fraction for the concept would be about 5.4%. The proposed launch vehicle was a slender cone; this geometry minimizes aerodynamic drag force and moves the center of gravity rearward to allow a statically stable flight body. It was

21

determined that the nose tip of the slender cone would require active cooling d uring atmospheric transit lithium was assumed as the coolant material for the nose tip, since it has a high specific heat The authors postulated that the total mass of the projectile may be reduced by using a

simple, pyrotechnically-timed fuse to initiate the insertion motor at ballistic apogee, instead, of utilizing an electronic trigger mechanism for the orbital insertion motor. Palmer and Dabiri selected the launch mechanism to utilize railgun technology, since this technology has demonstrated launch velocities in the range of 6 - 10 km/s for small masses. The railgun required, is a scaled up version of military designs, with a bore of 0.6 meters and a length of 250 meters. The relatively short length of the launcher allows the railgun launcher to be capable of adjusting the launch direction and launch angle to allow missions to a greater number of Earth orbits. The shorter launch length subjects the launch vehicle to acceleration forces of

approximately 64 000 Gs. Typically, undeveloped and costly pulsed power energy storage systems have been proposed for space railgun concepts. Palmer and Dabiri proposed that a bank of lead add batteries charging a large inductor would be an inexpensive means of energy storage for the raUgun instead of implementing pulsed power technology. The dectridty for the railgun is to be `turned on' using explosive switches; since an explosive switch minimizes electric arcing through actuation by a pyrotechnic charge. Palmer and Dabiri's study suggests that an dectromagnetic space launch system is a near term possibility without any obvious physical barriers. The railgun for launching 1 kg payloads could serve as a technology demonstrator, a scaled up version could be implemented to launch conventional large satellites. The cost of launching payloads could be as low as $20 to $80/kg range. Commencing research into the use of a battery bank and inductor energy supply system may lead to a successfiil alternative space launch system. However fiirther work is needed to devdop the explosive switches required for the proposed railgun design.

NASA Nuclear Waste Disposal Rail Launch Concept
In 1982, NASA contracted Columbus Laboratories to study the feasibility and viability of

an Earth to space electromagnetic (EM) latmch system capable o f launching to Earth otbit and beyond. TOs study considered using EM launchers for applications ranging from deep space probes to a booster for chemical rockets to atmosphetic experiments; however, only two o f these

applications were selected to be studied in detail The first application was the launch of small satellite payloads to Earth orbit and second application was disposing of high-level nuclear waste by launching it out of the solar system [16].  The final concept proposed a launch facility that is capable of launching both orbital payloads and nuclear waste disposal missions. It was originally considered that a single railgun launcher capable of adjusting its launch angle would be used, however this design option became technically demanding since the length of the required railgun launcher would be approximately 2040 meters. It was decided that each application would have a dedicated railgun launcher. The launch rail for the orbital application would be inclined at a 20 degree angle firom the horizontal, to îtunimizc the size of the orbital insertion motor required. The railgun launcher for nuclear waste disposal would be oriented vertically, to minimize atmospheric drag. The launch velocity for the orbital application was estimated to be between 5 and 10 km/s for sending a launch vehicle, with a high ballistic co-efficient, to LEO. It was estimated that a launch velocity of about 20 km/s was required to launch nuclear waste out of the solar system. The analysis estimated that atmospheric drag accounted for about 5% of the launch velocity with the pressure drag being dominate and sldn drag only accounting for about 1 to 2 % of the total drag. The maximum acceleration experienced by the payloads was estimated to be 2500 gee for an orbital payload and 10 000 gee for a nuclear waste payload. The railgun design for both applications would be similar. The air would be evacuated from each railgun launch tube to reduce drag on the launch vehicle. The vacuum at the end of the launch tube would be maintained by a diaphragm that would be ruptured by a laser just prior to the vehicle exit The electrical input to each railgun would be supplied by a nuclear reactor. Since the launch event requires a large amount of electricity over a short period of time, a means of storing and then quickly delivering this energy is needed. Therefore, each railgun would use homopolar generators (HGP) for energy storage since HPGs represent a technology that might require less cost and development than other technologies like battery systems, capacitors and explosive flux generators. Each railgun would utilize a distributed energy supply system, that is,

current would be fed into the rails at a number of points along the rail rather than just at the base. A distributed energy supply increases the efficiency of the railgun but increases the complexity of

23

the railgun design. The supply current, for each segment of the railgun, would be turned on by a high current, solid state switch that is actuated by the magnetic field intensity of the previous segment of rail. The study noted that technology for these field actuated switches, capable of handling high current loads, require significant research and development Both railguns were required to be capable of firequent launches; it was proposed that an automated milling and repair machinery could be designed to recondition the rails at certain time intervals. The lifetime of these space railguns could not be accurately estimated at the time of the study, since experimentation with high current railguns has not been performed. The launch vehicle for each application was assumed to be a slender cylinder with fins for stabilization. The study recommended that further research should be done to investigate the

effectiveness of fins and study spin stabilization as an alternative. The study noted that spin stabilization would require the design of a railgun launcher capable of spinning the launch vehicle during launch. The launch vehicle for the orbital application requires a rocket motor for orbital insertion o f the satellite payload. A liquid rocket motor was sized to supply the 2.1 km /s velocity increase to place a 650 kg satellite into a circular 500 km orbit It was postulated that the rocket systems could later be retrieved by the space shuttle and returned to Earth for reuse. The total mass of this launch vehicle was estimated to be 6500 kg including the satellite payload mass of 650 kg. The payload mass fiaction for the orbital launch vehicle would be about 10%. The launch vehicle for the nuclear waste disposal application is simplified since no rocket motor is needed. This launch vehicle was estimated to have a total mass of 2055 kg including 250 kg of high-level nuclear waste payload. The payload mass fraction for the nuclear waste launch would be about 12.2%. Figure 2.5 depicts a schematic o f the proposed launch vehicles and the launch facility. The thermal analysis for the launch vehicles indicated that conventional materials like refractory metals could be used for the nose cone to handle the thermal and mechanical loads. Carbon-carbon composites could be used for the sides to reduce the overall mass of the launch vehicle yet provide adequate thermal protection. The total heat input into the launch vehicle would be less than the heat input experienced by typical reentry vehicles because the duration of the heating event is short A hypersonic launch creates significant heating loads that last a few

Figure 2.5: Schematic of NASA Rail Launch Facility and Vehicles [16] seconds versus the typical reentry heating loads that lasts a. few minutes. However, the launch vehicle would experience higher temperatures than typical reentry vehicles. The study also considered the environmental effects that the proposed railgun launch system would have. lik e present rocket launches, the weather conditions for launches are

important Winds would have little effect on the launch operations; however, cloud cover would inhibit launch. It was estimated that the presence of clouds would increase the ablation, or wear rate, of the nose cone causing the destruction of the vehicle. Launch during precipitation would result in destruction of the launch vehicle. The launch would generate significant noise issues. The sonic boom generated at the exit of the launch rail was estimated to be lethal at a radius of 15 meters and 30 meters firom the exit for an orbital launch and nuclear waste disposal launch respectively. The orbital and nuclear waste disposal launch would rupture eardrums at 40 and 75 meters firom the exit respectively. Windows would be broken by an orbital and nuclear waste disposal launch at 120 and 240 meters firom the exit respectively. The study recommended the launch facility be located on a remote island near the equator because it offers many advantages. High-level nuclear waste is a security risk; a remote island

25

location offers an easier location to guard the material. The equatorial location with a launch due east maximizes the use of earth's rotation for placing payloads in equatorial orbits. The remote island offers a location that is isolated, so the sonic booms generated would pose a risk to fewer people. Finally, a remote island offers a `safe', low risk location for aborted launch vehicles to crash since the island is surrounded by an ocean. The study recommended continued research into military railgun technology may lead to a space launcher application. No technical barriers to the development of a space railgun launcher were identified. The progress of railgun technology up to 1982, suggested that a practical system would likely be available in the 2020 time period.

Molder Distributed Propellant Launcher Rail
Professor S. Molder proposed a unique method of utilizing a solid or gel propellant to

accelerate a launch body on a rail. The concept can be considered an externally fuelled single-stage rocket that is constrained to travel on a rail-road rail [17]. Figure 2.6 depicts a schematic of Professor MoldePs Distributed Propellant Launch Rail (DPLR) concept

Figure 2.6: Schematic of MoIdePs Distributed Propellant Launch Rail [17]
The raU-road rail has a slot milled along the top edge of the rail for the fijll length of the rail. The slot is filled with a solid or gel mono-propellant The launch vehicle that tides the rail is essentially a diverging rocket nozzle that is fitted over the slot of mono-propeUant An igniter system is fitted to the launch vehicle just prior to the beginning of the rocket nozzle. The operation of this launch vehicle is simple; the igniter system initiates the combustion of the mono propellant in the rail just ahead of the launch vehicle. The combustion gases then flow into the inlet o f the rocket nozzle and out through the outlet at the rear of the launch body. The expansion of the combustion gases through an increasing area rocket nozzle creates a propulsive force that accelerates the launch vehicle forward. Therefore, the launch vehicle does not catty propellant 26

The performance and efficiency of the launch system is improved because the propellant expended is used only to accelerate the igniter, rocket nozzle structure and payload mass. Unlike conventional rockets were the propellant is expended to accelerate the total mass of the storage tanks, rocket motor, remaining propellant and payload. For a base case, S. Molder assumed the mass of the launch vehicle, length, nozzle half angle and nozzle exit diameter to be 700 kg, 2.32 m, 10 degrees and 0.82 m respectively. The rail for the base case was assumed to be 1.5 km in length and have a 3 cm by 5 cm slot along the total length. The mass of the propellant loaded into the rail was assumed to be 2864 kg. The resulting final velocity of the launch vehicle traveling with drag equivalent to sea-level (1 atmosphere) was calculated to be 8.12 km/s with a maximum acceleration o f 2 382 Gs. The base case values were varied individually to determine the effects different launch parameters would cause. Molder determined that operating the launch vehicle in a vacuum would have a small effect on the final velocity; final velocity for operation in a vacuum would increase 2.2% firom 8.12 to 8.30 km/s. Changing the total mass of fuel in the rail via altering the

dimensions of the slot caused a significant change in performance. Changing the propellant mass firom 1909 to 5728 kg, increased the acceleration and velocity by a factor of 2 and 1.43 respectively. Changing the total mass of the launch vehicle also has a significant effect on

performance. By increasing the mass of the launch vehicle from 700 kg to 1000 kg, the final velocity decreased by 17.6% from 8.12 to 6.69 km/s. Molder concluded that the calculated performance of the concept is capable of accelerating launch vehicles to velocities required for direct launch and recommended that further work be done to investigate the interaction o f the fuel combustion and launch vehicle dynamics. For this concept to operate properly, the combustion of the propellant must be matched to the speed of the vehicle. If the combustion process is too slow, the gases will not be properly expanded through the rocket nozzle. Likewise, if the combustion process is too rapid, then the combustion gases will not be utilized properly by the rocket nozzle.

High Altitude Research Project (HARP)
In the 1960's Gerald Bull lead a research program to utilize a

conventional naval powder cannon to propel large payloads to high attitudes. The cannon used was a surplus 16 inch diameter naval gun, originally mounted in a battleship; however, this naval cannon was modified to increase the total length of the barrel. Special gun powder charges were used in the cannon to maintain the base pressure on the payload to accelerate it to high velocities. These payloads experienced accelerations of 5000 to 20 000 gee and exited the cannon at velocities up to 3.6 km/s [2]. Figure 2.7 is a photo of the HARP cannon launching a payload [18].

Figure 2.7: HARP [18] It was demonstrated in 1968, that the payload could reach sub-orbital altitudes of 180 km.
At this altitude, a stable satellite orbit can be established since it is above the sensible atmosphere limit of about 150 km. The payloads launched ranged from 68 kg to 909 kg in mass and demonstrated that complex components like electronics and solid rocket motors could survive the launch acceleration firom a cannon. The payloads were typically used to obtain high altitude meteorological data that previously was accessible by only by sounding rockets. However, near the end o f the program in 1968, launch vehicles known as the Martlet 2G-1 and Martlet 4, were being developed to reach LEO. The Martlets launch vehicles were staged rockets launched from the cannon and capable of inserting a small satellite in to LEO. The HARP program ended due to financial difficulties before either of the Martlets launch vehicles could be demonstrated. HARP demonstrated that directly launching a payload from the Earth surface to space was a near term possibility. However, a gun powder cannon has a maximum launch velocity of about 4 km/s. This velocity limit results from the maximum velocity of the gun powder combustion gases. It is therefore unlikely that future gun powder cannons would be capable of launching payloads much higher than the 180 km achieved by HARP, since the launch velocity for HARP was near the maximum velocity. To date the results of HARP represents the highest launch energy achieved by any direct space launch system at 440 MJ.

StarTram - Maglev Space Launch Tunnel
In 2001, Plus Ultra Technologies Inc. proposed an electromagnetic space launch concept

capable of launching reusable manned and unmanned vehicles, with a mass of 200 tonne to Earth orbit at an estimated cost of $30/kg. The vehicle is capable of carrying a payload of 70 tonnes to orbit The proposed system therefore has a payload mass fraction of 35% [19]. The StarTram concept proposes accelerating manned launch vehicles at 2.5 Gs down a 1280 km long launch tunnel to reach a final velocity of 8.023 km/s at the end of the launch tunnel. The launch vehicle travels down the launch tunnel located on Earth surface similar to a Maglev train. A superconducting magnet onboard the launch vehicle interacts with an aluminum guide track located in the launch tunnel to levitate the vehicle. A linear synchronous motor (LSIvÇ is incorporated into the guide track to propel the vehicle at nearly 100% efficiency. If the launch tunnel is evacuated of air, it is estimated that about 20 GW of electricity should be capable of accelerating the vehicle to 8 km/s. To further minimize the aerodynamic drag experience by the launch vehicle, the concept proposes that the vehicle enter a second evacuated tunnel angled at 5 degrees from the horizontal to guides the vehicle up to an altitude of 22 km. At 22 km altitude, the vehicle exits the tunnel at 8 km /s and travels through the remaining atmosphere experiencing significantly reduced drag and aerothermal effects (air density is 5% of sea-level values). The end of the tunnel utilizes a high velocity stream of air or steam to maintain the vacuum in the tunnel yet allows the vehicle to exit Constructing a structure to support the guide tunnel to a height of 22 km using conventional materials would be a challenging task. This concept proposes that superconducting cables located on the guide tube and ground below the tube could be used to generate a magnetic tepulsion force capable of supporting the weight of the guide tunnel. It has been estimated that a total current of 14 mega-amps and 280 mega-amps in the superconducting cables located on the 8tude tunnel and ground respectively, would generate a repulsive force of 4 tonnes/m at an altitude of 22 km. The guide tunnel would be stabilized against disturbing forces like winds using a network of high strength polymer cables moored to the tunnel and the ground. Figure 2.8 is a sketch of the launch vehicle exiting the end of the magnetically levitated launch tube.

2.3.10 Lofstrom Launch Loop
Mr. Keith Lofstrom proposed using a very long ribbon of iron traveling at high velocity in a loop as a means to store and deliver energy to launch a five tonne payload to geosynchronous or near lunar orbits [20]. Lofistrom likened the operation of this ribbon of iron to a stream of water firom a hose. If the stream o f water were angled upward to the
s'ky

and traveling in a vacuum, it

would follow a parabolic ballistic trajectory back to Earth. If the water stream encounters a fiat plate with a slight downward angle, the stream of water will be deflected downward and the plate would experience an upward force. Suppose the entire stream is encased in a fricrionless hose, then the downward deflection of the stream by the hose could create an upward force large enough to support the weight of the hose. The water stream travels back to Earth and can be recycled and pumped back into the beginning of the hose to create a closed loop. Instead of a stream of water, a ribbon of flexible iron traveling at high velocity could create an upward force capable of supporting a stationary mass without the need for structural support materials.

therefore, the momentum of the iron ribbon is used to support the launch track. The laimch loop begins at the Earth's surface near the equator, where the iron ribbon is launched at 14 m /s at angle of 20 degrees from the horizontal. Figure 2.9 depicts a schematic for the Launch Loop. The ribbon travels up to the 80 km altitude where it encounters an electromagnetic deflector station that redirects the ribbon in neatly a horizontal direction along the laimch track. At this first electromagnetic deflector station, 5 tonne launch vehicles are loaded on to the launch track. The launch vehicles have a magnetic base that interacts with both the high velocity ribbon and permanent magnets located on the launch track to accelerate and levitate the veWcle. The vehicle IS accelerated at about 3 Gs, down the 2000 km launch track to a final velocity of 10.5 km/s and exits the launch track. At the end of the launch track, the ribbon encounters a second Once

electromagnetic deflector to redirect the ribbon at a 20 degree angle back towards Earth.

the ribbon reaches Earth, it is accelerated using linear induction motors back toward the initial launch site to complete the loop. The launch loop has demanding design requirements. To reduce atmospheric heating, the tton ribbon is to be enclosed in high vacuum sheath structure that is also must be supported by the oiomentum of the icon ribbon. The launch loop is stabilized in the position against disturbing forces like wind using long cables extending from 80 km altitude to Earth. .The total length of the Squired iron ribbon loop is about 4900 km and its mass is about 15 600 tonnes. The kinetic

power generation station about 60 days output to accelerate the ribbon to full speed; the power loss to the deflectors and other losses accounts for about 200 MW at full speed operation. A 500 MW power supply, would capable of launching 35 vehicles per day. Lofstrom acknowledges the design requirements are demanding, and the system may ultimately be impractical or too expensive if research into the concept continues. However, through proposing this concept, it is hoped that it may inspire others to propose other low cost and high volume launch systems based on ideas from his concept

2.4

Other Novel Space Launch System Proposals
This Section will introduce two concepts that propose using a reusable space plane to

transfer material to orbit The concepts have been proposed as a more cost-effective method of transport than the current expendable rockets and Space Shuttle vehicles. The both concepts, the ESA Hopper and HASTOL system, are reusable space plane systems capable of taking off horizontally, delivering the payload to orbit and landing horizontally, much like a conventional aircraft However ESA design focuses on providing a near term system by utilizing existing rocket motor designs, the HASTOL design focuses on providing a system for future use because some critical technology must be developed to make the HASTOL system feasible.

2.4.1 ESA Hopper Space Plane
In 2003, ESA funded a study of a reusable launch vehicle, named the Hopper which was intended to be a unmanned, fully automated, reusable rocket powered launch vehicle. Hopper vehicle is intended to achieve lower launch costs than conventional rocket technology. Lower ; ; .1.. . ; The

launch costs are possible because each mission uses propellant more effectively to place the payload in orbit, the vehicle is reusable and the vehicle is less risky; therefore, a safer means of transporting payloads [21]. Figure 2.10 depicts a sketch of the Hopper concept Concept [21]

32

The operation sequence of the Hopper is relatively straightforward. The Hopper vehicle complete with an internal payload ranging firom 7.2 to 13.1 tonnes', takes off horizontally firom a launch rail located near the equator in French Guyana. The vehicle is accelerated on the launch tail to velocity of about 185 m /s. The Hopper vehicle leaves the launch rail and bums the three main liquid rocket engines until it reaches about 100 km altitude. The vehicle coasts upwards on a ballistic trajectory to 130 km altitude where a blast of pressurized helium is used to discharge firom the vehicle the payload and an upper stage rocket motor. The liquid rocket motor of the upper stage ignites and propels the payload to either a circular LEO or a Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), The Hopper vehicle continues its ballistic trajectory and returns to Earth near Europe

about 4500 km down range firom the launch site. The Hopper vehicle is returned to the launch site by boat and readied for the next mission. It is intended that one Hopper vehicle could complete 10 to 20 missions per year. The Hopper launch concept has a number of advantages. The horizontal launch rail enhances safety by mechanically guiding the vehicle duiing launch and reduces the mass of propellant and wing structure because the launch sled assists the vehicle to a high take-off velocity. Horizontal launch is desirable since it requires less thrust during takeoff than vertical launch; therefore, the main engjnes can be smaller or reduced throttle can be used to maximize engine life. The Hopper system is almost entirely reusable; the only expendable component for each mission is the upper stage. Unlike the Space Shuttle, the Hopper vehicle does not enter orbit; therefore, the total mass of the Hopper is reduced since less propellant, thermal protection and structural mass is required. The payload mass firaction of the vehicle is 1.5 and 2.5% for a GTO and a LEO mission respectively. Since the Hopper vehicle does not reach orbit, the design of the vehicle is less demanding. The design goal of the Hopper is to use existing technology, like the main engines from the Araine rocket, to maximize safety and reliability of the system while minimizing development and manufacturing costs. It is intended that the Hopper System could be developed as early as 2015. However, at the time of writing this manuscript, the concept was not selected for further development.

' 7.2 tonne payloads can be placed in GEO and 13.1 tonne payloads can be placed in LEO.

HASTOL System
The Hypersonic Airplane Assisted Space Tether Orbital Launch (HASTOL) system is a

joint proposal made, in 1999, by Boeing/MDC Phantom Work, Tethers Unlimited Inc. and the University of Maryland for a space launch system. The HASTOL system is intended to be a fuUy reusable system that is capable of placing payloads in orbit at cost less than expendable rockets. The HASTOL concept is novel because it eliminates the need to use conventional rocket engines to place material into orbit [22]. As the Paykad. i LOX(BaW }__nA

firom a conventional runway carrying a 14 tonne payload. The study proposes using an existing concept design for the hypersonic airplane, the Boeing DF-9, depicted in Figure 2.11, to reduce the development cost of the system. The DF-9 aircraft is fitted with three distinct propulsion systems for use at different velocities. An air breathing turbo ramjet is used for velocities below Mach 4.5. An air breathing ram/scram jet is used for velocities above Mach 4.5 and a linear rocket system is used at altitudes above 100 km where air is rare. The DF-9 is intended to carry the

payload to an altitude of 100 km, traveling at 3.6 km/s. At 100 km altitude, the DF-9 and the payload rendezvous with a grappling mechanism attached to the tip of a rotating space tether. The grappling mechanism** captures the payload, removes it firom the DF-9 and carries the payload into orbit. Figure 2.12 depicts the rendezvous of the payload and tether. The DF-9 returns empty to a conventional runway. The space tether is a 640 km long rotating cable that is located in an

elliptical orbit. The space tether carries the payload for one compete orbit and releases the payload into a stable elliptical orbit. The payload mass fraction for this system is estimated to be about 5%. Unlike the

conventional means of orbiting a payload by supplying energy from a Figure 2.12: Rotating Tether During Payload Transfer [22]

chemical rocket, the space tether achieves orbiting of the payload by transferring a portion of its own orbital energy to the payload. Orbiting the payload reduces the energy of the space tether; therefore, the maximum altitude of the tether orbit, the apogee, is reduced. To return the space tether to its original orbit, the space tether uses an electrodynamic propulsion system to boost the apogee of the orbit without using propellants. An electrodynamic propulsion system boosts the altitude of the tether by supplying electrical current from solar panels to a 10 km long conducting ''^ e . ITie current in the wire interacts with the Earth's magnetic field to create a force increases the apogee of the tether. The HASTOL system is based on near term technologies; however significant advancement in the design of both the hypersonic aircraft and the tether is required. The DF-9 requires the development of the propulsion systems to make the design practical. According to the study, the design of the tether system is practical with commercially available material. However, since no orbiting tethers exist at the time of writing, significant research is required in two areas, the development of an electrodynamic propulsion system and the evaluation of the lifetime of the tether material in the space environment.

Mass Driver Launcher Technology
Section 2.3 introduced entire alternative systems for launching material to orbit This

Section details operation and capabilities of the proposed launcher technologies used for directly launching material from Earth surface to orbit These launch technologies are grouped into three categories: chemical, electromagnetic and mechanical launch systems. Section 2.3 did not include a launch concept for a mechanical launcher because no detailed complete launch system could be found at the time of writing; however, a discussion of the operation of a mechanical launcher for hypersonic payloads can be found in Section 2.5.3.1. The launch technologies discussed in the following Sections will be considered as possible design solutions for the launcher for the MPSTS mentioned in Section 1.4.

2.5.1

Chemical Launch Systems
Chemical launch systems utilize the energy resulting from a chemical reaction to accelerate

the payload. Primary benefit for a chemical launch system is the storageof the launch energy is generally easy and safely accomplished by storing the chemical reagents intanks.Generally, however chemical launch systems are an inefficient means of accelerating payloads. The following Sections will briefly outline the technology and operation of a conventional cannon, a light gas gun, a RAM tube and an electrothermal launcher.

2.5.1.1

Conventional Cannon Launcher
Conventional cannon launchers use

the chemical reaction of gunpowder to generate high pressure gas at the base of a projectile to accelerate the projectile down a barrel or launch tube. Figure 2.13 depicts a schematic for a conventional cannon Conventional Cannon Launcher |23|

launcher. The molecular weight and temperature of the gas created by the ignition of gunpowder limits the maximum attainable velocity of the projectile to a range of 3 to 4 km/s [2]. The most successful attempt to use a conventional cannon for space launch was mentioned in Section 2.3.8

36

the HARP (High Altitude Research Project); however, a Canadian company, Columbaid^ is continuing the research into convention cannon technology for space launch. The benefits for using conventional cannon technology for space launch is it is a simple, well understood technology that is capable of launching relatively large payloads multiple times per day. The HARP gun launched projectiles up to 900 kg and was capable of being reloaded and repositioned in about one hour; therefore, nearly 24 launches per day are possible. However, as demonstrated in the HARP project, a pure cannon launch with a maximum projectile velocity of 4 km/s cannot place payloads much higher than 180 km altitude. The velocity limitation of

conventional cannons is the primary disadvantage for this technology. To increase the velocity of the projectile, methods such as using liquid propellants and distributing the gunpowder charges have been proposed.

Light Gas Gun Launcher

compressed gas injected at the base of the gun to accelerate a payload down a barrel or launch tube [14]. Figure 2.14 depicts a schematic for a light gas gun launcher. Light gas guns represent a mature technology, since research into light gas guns

began in 1948 as a means of performing hypervelocity experiments.

experiments, light gas guns operated with compressed hydrogen have accelerated small payloads to velocities of 10 km/s. A light gas gun, capable of firing large payloads at 10 km/s, would be more than capable of sending the payloads to LEO altitudes. However, light gas gun technology has two problems. Firstly, at launch velocities greater than about 8 km/s, the erosion rate of launch tube bore becomes significant. Fortunately, a launch velocity of 7 to 8 km/s is sufficient for a payload to reach LEO and reduces the erosion rate of the bore to acceptable levels. Secondly, since the high pressure gas is injected into the base, the payload experiences a non-uniform acceleration with the initial acceleration force being high at the base or breech then gradually

reducing as the payload moves away from the breech. To rectify this problem, the light gas gun design in Section 2.3.4 has proposed the compressed gas would be injected at multiple points along the gun to create a more uniform acceleration. Figure 2.15 depicts a

gun launcher. A uniform acceleration reduces the peak acceleration force; therefore, the structural mass and gee hardening requirements of the payload would be reduced.

2.5.1.3 RAM Launcher
A RAM launcher is composed of two parts, first a launch tube filled with a gaseous

propellant mixture and secondly a payload with a special geometry. To accelerate the payload, the payload is propelled into the launch tube with , , . , , . . enough velocity to cause shock compression and 'Vails

combustion of the gaseous propellant in the wake of the payload [13]. Figure 2.16 depicts a schematic for the RAM launcher. Just like a conventional cannon, the combustion creates gas pressure to accelerate the payload down the launch tube. The movement of the payload causes the combustion, gas generation and acceleration to occur down the entire length of the launch tube. Experiments with RAM launch tubes have obtained velocities of up to 2.7 km/s [24]. However, to achieve the velocities required for orbital launch, approximately 7 km/s, it has been estimated that the launch tube must be divided into 15 regions of gaseous propellant with different mixtures. Each of these regions must be separated from each other by a fast acting valve, door or barrier mechanism, which can quickly open when the payload approaches.

2.5.1.1 Electrothermal Launcher
An electrothermal launcher uses electrical current to improve the function of a conventional cannon [13]. Figure 2.17 depicts the schematic for an electrothermal launcher. Just like a conventional cannon, an electrothermal launcher uses the combustion of a gunpowder-like 38

material to generate a high pressure gas to accelerate a payload. However, to increase the pressure of the gas and the acceleration of the payload, electrical energy is used to excite the combustion gases into a plasma state.

technology, electrothermal technology cannot achieve the velocity required for orbital launch.

2.5.2

Electromagnetic Launch Systems
Electromagnetic launch systems utilize electrical energy to accelerate payloads.

Electromagnetic launch technology is potentially a means of launching payloads to velocities required for orbital launch with high overall efficiency. Electromagnetic technology allows for the acceleration force on the payload to be constant and accurately controlled; however, the requirements for the electrical energy storage and electrical switching (turning on and off the current) have limited the success of electromagnetic launch technology. The following two

Section introduce two common electromagnetic launchers, the railgun launcher and the coilgun launcher.

2.5.2.1

Railgun Launchers
A railgun launcher is comprised of
Amrwlofe Cwrront Flow Aimafufe

two components. The main component is a pair of parallel conductive rails connected to a source of direct current; one rail is connected to the positive polarity and the other connected to the negative polarity.

(Plasna)

Paytoad
Bucket

Figure 2.18: Railgun Launcher [23]

The second component of a railgun launcher is known as an armature. The armature slides between the two parallel rails and carries the payload. Figure 2.18 depicts a schematic of the railgun launcher. To launch the payload, the armature is positioned between the two rails to complete the electrical circuit The follow of current through the armature generates a propulsive force, known as the Lorentz force, to accelerate the armature and payload. The Lorentz force

39

occurs because the magnetic field formed around the armature is perpendicular to the field formed around the rails; therefore the fields repel each other [12]. At the end of the rails, the armature

and payload depart from the rails at a high velocity. Shortly after the armature and payload exit the railgun launcher, the armature and payload separate; the payload follows a trajectory to orbit while the armature falls hack to Earth. Experiments with railgun technology have had encouraging results for space launch applications. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that small payloads, in the order of one gram, can he accelerated to velocities up to 12 km/s [2]. The findings s u ^ s t that there are no fundamental harriers to accelerating larger payloads to these velocities. A railgun launcher has the potential to he a low cost space launch system for a number of reasons. The railgun launcher is a highly reusable system; generally, the only reoccurring cost for each launch is the cost of the electricity consumed and the cost of the armature. The cost of electricity to launch payloads to high velocities is negligible. For example the cost of electricity for launching a 1250 kg payload to a 260 km altitude would he about $2200 or $1.76 /kg [13]. This cost assumes a 30% launcher efficiency and a cost of electricity of 80/kWh. The railgun launcher is a relatively simple machine to construct, operate and maintain; therefore, the cost associated with each should he low. Railgun launcher technology does have some significant technical issues to solve before a practical system can launch large payload, in the order of lO's to lOOO's of kilograms. A

fundamental problem with railgun technology is developing the equipment needed to handle the high current loads, millions of amps [12], for launching large payloads. Launching large payloads requires an energy storage system capable of storing gigajoules of electricity. Various technologies for energy storage such as batteries, capacitors and rotating momentum machines have been suggested and investigated, hut further work is needed for a practical energy storage system. Launching large payloads also requires heavy-duty switches to turn on the power to the rails at the appropriate time. Developing switch technology capable of turning on and off millions of amps requires further development The design of an armature and rails capable of conducting millions of amps without significantly damaging the rails is another design area that must be developed

40

before a practical railgun launcher could be constructed. Many of the problems with railgun technology may be mitigated in the future because the technology receives extensive military research funding.

2.S.2.2 Coil-gun Launchers
The coil gun launcher, like the railgun launcher, utilize a magnetic field to accelerate a payload down a launch tube. Figure 2.19 depicts a schematic of a coil gun launcher. The coil gun is similar to an electric induction Figure 2.19: Coil-gun Launcher [23] onvcr coii% tiocircmagnct!;

motor, except it can be considered as unrolled and known as a linear induction motor. The stator coils or drive coils are stacked co-axially to form the launch tube. Like the railgun, the payload for the coil-gun requires a conducting armature to be attached or built into the payload^. When the drive coil directly behind the payload armature energizes, a magnetic field is created; the expansion of the magnetic field induces a current in the armature. The interaction of the drive coil magnetic field and the induced armature current creates a force accelerating the payload forward [13]. A controller precisely energizes the drive coils sequentially according to the position of the payload. The result is the drive coils create a traveling magnetic field wave that is synchronized with the motion of the payload. ITie traveling magnetic field exerts a constant and controllable acceleration force on the payload. The magnetic field wave created by the drive coils center the payload in the launch tube; therefore, the operation does not suffer from the problem of launch tube erosion that plagues other technologies. Major research and experiments with coil-guns were performed by Dr. G. O 'Neill in the 1970's for his Mass Driver concept for transporting material from the lunar surface [25]. The Mass Driver concept enhanced the performance of the coil-gun by utilizing superconducting materials for the armature on the payload. The Mass Driver concept improved the overall

efficiency of the launch system by recycling the payload armature and its kinetic energy back into launch system. After the payload was launched, an additional section of coil on the launch
^A

payload composed entirely of a conducting material can serve as the armature but the performance would be poor due to Eddy current losses.

41

tube is used to slow the armature and generate electricity to feed back into the energy storage system. The theoretical efficiency of the Mass Driver system was estimated to be about 90% [2], A practical coil-gun launcher for space launch purposes is not likely in the near term. The best coil-gun experiments have accelerated 180 g masses to 1.3 km /s [2]. Accelerating payloads to high velocities with coil-guns have been hindered by the capability of the switching technology to provide high voltages to quickly energize the drive coil. Maintaining a magnetic traveling wave synchronized with a high velocity payload is a challenging requirement for the switching technology. Like railguns, the energy storage requirements exceed present technology for launching large payloads.

2.5.3

Mechanical Launch System
Mechanical launch technology utilizes the momentum of a large moving object to

accelerate a relatively small payload. The following Section details.the operation of the Slingatron concept, a relatively new concept, proposed in 1998, for a rotating machine capable of launching payloads to orbital velocities.

2.5.3.1

Slingatron Launcher
The operation o f the Slingatron launcher is simUar to swirling coffee in a coffee cup by

gyrating the mug. The mass of the coffee is constrained to travel in a circle by the coffee mug, however, a gyrating circular motion exerts a tangential force on the coffee that causes the acceleration. To increase the velocity of the coffee, the gyration frequency must also increase. Another everyday example for the Slingatron operation is the whirling of a mass at the end of a string. If the mass is whirled at a constant frequency and the string is lengthened, the mass at the end of the string will be puUed to a higher velocity. If the string is lengthened at a constant rate, the mass will travel in a spiral [26]. The Slingatron concept proposes that a payload could be accelerated by constraining it to travel inside a spiral shaped launch tube subjected to constant circular gyration. The circular gyration of the spiral shaped launch tube is performed by the rotation of a number of swing arm drive units distributed along the spiral and operated by electric motors or turbines. Figure 2.20 42

depicts a schematic for the Slingatron launcher. One of the main advantages, of the Slingatron concept, is the supply of power required for launch is distributed among multiple drive units and the supply can be spread over a period of time to slowly increase the gyration frequency. Unlike launch electromagnetic energy is launchers, the stoiing rotational

momentum o f the spiral launch tube and swing atms act as the storage device. To launch a payload, the spiral launch tube is accelerated to the required constant gyration frequency and the payload is injected into the launch tube near the center of the spiral. Given a sufficient gyration frequency,

ntinimal fidction forces and a long spiral length,

Figure 2.20: Slingatron Launcher and Swing Arm [26]

the payload would exit the spiral at orbital launch velocities of about 8 km/s. This launcher is capable of multiple payloads launches at launch frequency equal to the gyration frequency; however, the drive units must be capable of maintaining a constant gyration frequency. The most important requirement for the proper operation of the Slingatron is to ensure fidction forces on the payload are minimized. The payload experiences two sources of fidction, aerodynamic drag in the launch tube if air is present and sliding fidction between the payload and the launch tube due to centrifugal forces. Research by D. Tidman indicates that if the launch tube Was evacuated of air and payload was supported by a gas bearing, the fidction forces would be sufficiently low. A preliminary design for launching a 1000 kg cylindrical payload with a diameter of 0.64 m at 8 km /s has been proposed. The proposed launcher would require a gyration frequency of 4.75 Hz and the mass of the spiral launch tube and swing arms would be 9525 tonnes. The length of the spiral track traversed by the payload is 28 miles. For comparison a typical passenger car weighs 43

1.4 tonnes, therefore the rotating mass for this launcher is equivalent to rotating nearly 7000 cars at a frequency of 4.75 rotations per second. Practically, it does not seem realistic to construct a machine with such a large rotating mass moving at these frequencies.

2.6

Proposed Catcher Mechanisms
I f a payload without an orbital insertion motor is launched to space directly from Earth, at

a velocity less than Earth escape velocity, a means of capturing the payload in space is necessary to prevent it from returning to Earth. The following Sections review capture or catcher mechanisms that have been previously proposed. Section 2.6.1 reviews the catcher concepts developed for the Moon Mass Driver system proposed by G. O'Neill. Section 2.6.2 reviews the grappling

mechanism for the rotating tether implemented by HASTOL concept described in Section 2.4.2. Section 2.6.3 reviews the proposed grappling mechanisms for the Momentum eXchange Electrodynamic Reboost (MXER) rotating tether system proposed by NASA and Tennessee Technological University.

2.6.1

NASA Summer Design Series Catcher Concepts
In the summer of 1977, NASA hosted a design symposium to propose a design for a

system capable of transporting soil from the moon surface to space construction projects located at Lagrange points®. The proposed transport system was to use an electromagnetic coil launcher, a Mass Driver, to launch sintered packets or bags of lunar material from the Moon. Various catcher concepts were proposed to capture these material packages in space. The catcher concepts were classified in two categories, passive catcher mechanisms with no moving components and active catcher mechanisms with moving components.

2.6.1.1

Passive Catcher Mechanism
Passive catcher mechanisms rely on the deformation of materials to absorb the kinetic

energy of incoming material packages. The first passive concept proposed was a concept that utilized a large disc of crushable material such as expanded foam or bonded glass fibers. The diameter o f this disc depends on the launch accuracy and dispersion of the material packages; it

8 Lagrange points are five locations in space where the Earth and Moon gravity forces are equal and opposite in direction, therefore a mass located at a Lagrange point is stationary relative to the Earth and Moon.

44

was assumed a 100 m diameter would be suitable. The kinetic energy of the incoming material packages would be dissipated by the deformation of the material. It was estimated that the material package traveling at 200 m /s would penetrate 1.3 m into foam material. After a period of time, the material with the lunar material imbedded is retrieved and processed to extract the lunar soil. This concept was not considered feasible since initially about 454 tonnes of material from Earth s required [27]. The second proposed passive concept was composed of two major components, a stationary rim with a grid of cables and a spinning Kevlar bag in the shape o f a cone. Figure 2.21 depicts this concept previous passive catcher Like the the

concept,

diameter of the rim was estimated to be 100 til to allow for dispersion of the material packages. The incoming material packages

are broken up into fine particles when they strike the grid of cables attached to the rim. The spray o f fine particles hits the Kevlar bag and comes to a rest The centrifugal force,

Figure 2.21: NASA Passive Catcher Concept [27]

created by the rotation of the bag, prevents the fine particles from escaping the bag. The concept was not considered feasible due to the uncertainty about the material packages breaking up and being retained as planned [27). 2.6.1.2 Active Catcher M echanism The active catcher mechanism relies on moveable components to absorb and transfer the kinetic energy of the incoming material packages into another form of energy. The proposed active catcher mechanism operates similar to the arresting cable for the deceleration of aircraft on an aircraft carrier. Figure 2.22 depicts a schematic of this cable catcher concept The proposed concept utilizes radar to detect the position of incoming material packages. The catcher system orients itself to intercept the material package in a cable netting similar to a volleyball net Each

45

end of the cable netting is attached and wound around a reel. When the material

oiaiAM iHw.ok« ihkikakk,»*

package contacts the netting, the material package's momentum creates a force that causes the reels to rotate, letting out more cable. The motion of the rotating reels can be used to turn generators or flywheels to convert the kinetic energy of the package into a useful form of energy [27].

2.6.2

HASTOL Grapple Concept
The HASTOL concept, described in Section 2.4.2, required the end of the rotating tether

to intercept a payload carried by a hypersonic aircraft

The grapple mechanism design is

challenging because the rendezvous point only occurs at a narrow region of space due to the velocity difference between the aircraft and the end of the tether. In addition, the grapple

mechanism must be capable o f sustaining the acceleration force of the payload after it is captured. The preliminary concept for the grapple mechanism was proposed as a hook extended from the payload and an `attaching' ring mounted on the end o f the tether. The operation is simple; the aircraft travels a straight flight path with the payload hook extended above the aircraft and the `attaching' ring at the end of the tether approaches the payload hook firom behind. The hook latches on to the ring upon contact [22]. Figure 2.23 depicts the schematic of the `attaching' ring assembly attached to the tether. The `attaching' ring is connected to a shock absorbing suspension cradle that allows six degrees o f movement for minor misalignment of the payload hook. The top cylindrical section could include a winch assembly for adjusting the position of the `attaching' ting. The `catching' operation occurs very quickly so it is expected that the entire process would be automated with ^ Figure 2.23: HASTOL Grapple Mechanism [22]

the use of differential GPS systems similar to those used for landing commercial aircraft. The investigators suggest further work is needed to refine the grapple design for issues such as atmospheric heating, control and power supply,

2.6.3

MXER Grapple Concept
NASA's In-space Propulsion Technology Program initiated the Momentum eXchange

Electrodynamic Reboost (MXER) Tether Program to design a rotating tether for transporting satellites from LEO to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) without the use of rocket technology. The program includes participants from Tennessee Technological University,

Lockheed Martin Astronautics and Tethers Unlimited [28]. A web site was setup, at for collaborating and proposing catcher mechanisms for the end of the MXER rotating tether [29]. ITie design challenge was to create a payload capture mechanism that would allow the rotating end of the MXER tether in an elliptical orbit to securely connect with a payload in circular LEO. The time period for capture, that is time period when the payload and the end of the tether both share the same position and have zero relative velocity, is very brief. Therefore, the "catcher' mechanism must operate very quickly. ITie ideal case is the payload and tether end share the same position and have zero velocity at time of capture, however practically, the "catcher' mechanism must accommodate some degree of error in position and relative velocity [28]. At the time of writing three concepts for the catcher mechanism were proposed. However, the only information available about the concepts was animations of the mechanisms operations available on the collaboration web site. Therefore, the following details about the concepts were inferred from the animations [29]. The first concept, known as the Iris

mechanism, is the preferred design. Like the HASTOL payload, a hook extends from the payload with an extendable boom. Figure 2.24

depicts a payload with the hook and boom extended mady to be captured by the tether. The catcher _ , . , ,, , mechanism attached to the tether is called an ins, 47 Figure 2.24: Payload Boom and Hook [29]

presumably because the mechanism opens and closes. Initially the mechanism forms a large square, see Figure 2.25a. For capture to occur, the hook of the payload must be inside the perimeter of this square. If the hook is in the perimeter of the square, the four `posts' at each comer move together very quickly to reduce the size of the square to snare the hook. Figures 2.25 a, b and c depict the process.

Figure 2.25: Iris^`Catcher' Mechanism (a) before capture, (b) during capture and (c) at capture It appears that each of the four `posts' contain two active motors (probably electric) to create the linear motion required to reduce the size of the square to achieve capture. The `posts' probably contain a sensor to detect the presence of the hook inside the perimeter of the square to trigger the capture event. The second proposed catcher mechanism utilizes the same hook and boom for the payload; however the capture mechanism on the tether differs. On the tether, a structure that is similar to a fishing net is used to snare the payload hook. Figure 2.26 depicts the net capture mechanism.

48

,-J Ü v
Figure 2.26: Net Capture Mechanism [29] Figure 2.27: Bear Trap Capture Mechanism [29]

It is assumed that this mechanism was not selected because it would be difficult to ensure that the payload is securely captured by the net and the mechanism would make release of the payload difficult. The third capture method operates like a bear trap. It is presumed that the payload utilizes a hook similar to the previous examples. A bear trap like mechanism located on the end of the tether closes around the payload hook at the appropriate time. Figure 2.27 depicts the bear trap. It ts presumed this concept was a preliminary concept since the level of work on the concept is limited.

Space Construction Projects
Five space construction projects of different magnitude have been identified from the

literature review. These five projects wiU be considered as the possible range of space construction projects that the material transfer capabilities of the Mass Driver Transport System, mentioned in Section 1.4, could be used to achieve. The five construction projects are listed below in table 2.1 from smallest to largest project [27&30]. Figure 2.28 depicts the projects. The specifications for an Ohio class submarine and Nimitz class aircraft carrier are included in table 2.1 and Figure 2.28 for comparison purposes.

The goal ' o f this project is to establish and aid an open

community for the Open Mass Driver System (OpenMD^ described in Section 1.4. This design process for the OpenMDS is intended to identify any technical limitations that would make the design impossible. Therefore, this study is concerned only with the physical feasibility o f the OpenMDS and is not concerned at this time with the economic feasibility of the mass driver system. The design of the mass driver will be first limited to a systems level design; a successful feasible systems design will then proceed towards a more detailed design also with the aid of the development community. Before an open engineering development community can be

established, it is assumed that some form of `prototype' design of the mass driver system will be required to attract a development community, since successful open source software projects tend to have an initial prototype version of the software to attract a development community. At the commencement of this project it was assumed that a detailed explanation of the operation of the concept would be sufficient to attract developers; however, through attempts'* at attracting developers, it became evident the `prototype' design required details to prove the concept was feasible and proves the commitment of the project founders. Section 1.4 introduced Mr. Panzeria's mass driver material package transport system as an Earth based launcher capable of sending a stream of small construction material packages to Earth orbit An orbiting `catcher' satellite (CatSat) situates itself to collect the construction material packages in orbit The collected MPs are then distributed as construction material to space

construction sites. The proposed concept describes how the mass driver system would operate; however, to evaluate the physical feasibility of the mass driver system, a number of design parameters must be defined and evaluated. As a starting point, Section 3.2 describes the

preliminary design parameters that were chosen as the baseline mass driver system. The goal of the design process for this Chapter is to develop a systems level design for the `prototype' OpenMDS. This Chapter will describe the evaluation of the first version of OpenMDS. The following Chapter, Chapter four, will discuss the `evolution' of the OpenMDS design towards a

of the five space construction projects introduced in Section 2.7. These projects range firom a small MIR space station sized project to a large 820 000 person habitat The range of the

construction will demonstrate the scale of space construction project that the proposed mass driver system design could be used to support The baseline mass driver system design was

considered to be comprised of three sub-systems, the launcher, material package (or pellets) and `catcher* satellite sub-systems. Figure 3.1 depicts a concept map for the OpenMDS. The concept map visually represents the sub-systems, initial design parameters and their relationships to each other. This concept map is not a complete diagram, but it records the initial design parameters identified for the OpenMDS. The following three Sections provide a description of each sub system and the assumed design parameters for the OpenMDS.

3.2.1 The Launcher Sub-system
The launcher (or mass driver) sub-system is responsible for launching a series of high velocity material packages one after another to form a material package stream (MPQ. For the preliminary OpenMDS, it is assumed the launcher would be located on Earth's surface at the equator and the launch direction would be in an easterly direction to take advantage of Earth's rotation. The launch site was assumed to be at sea-level, to account for the majority of elevations that are located on the equator. The concept map. Figure 3.1, indicates the important design parameters for establishing a material package stream is the launch velocity, launch frequency and launch energy. These three launch parameters are affected by the design parameters of the material packages and the `catcher* satellite (CatSat). Once the launch velocity, frequency and energy are determined, then the

appropriate launcher technology, from Section 2.5, can be selected. Therefore, to design the launcher sub-system all the important design parameters for the OpenMDS depicted in Figure 3.1 ^ be used to calculate the launch velocity, frequency and energy requirements. Details of the

calculation method and results are discussed in Section 3.3,3.4 and 3.5. 53

3.2.2

Material Package Sub-system
The material packages (or pellets) are ideally comprised of only the raw material needed for

the space construction project These material packages are assumed to have a total mass of less than 10 kg with each being composed of a solid construction material, like steel. It is assumed that having a small material package mass will be beneficial because it will simplify the design of the

54

launcher sub-system. The preliminary OpenMDS will consider material packages masses ranging from 1 gram, or pebble size, to 10 kg, or bowling ball size. The concept map identifies four major design parameters, in addition to the mass, for the material packages, namely the geometry, stability, drag and thermal protection. To address the geometry, it is initially assumed the material package would be a simple cylinder. It was initially assumed that flight stability of the material package would be provided by fins. The drag on each material package is a complex situation because each material package is traveling in the wake, or low pressure region of the preceding material package; section 3.3 and 3.4 discuss the details of bow the drag on the material package was apjproximated. A single launch body would require a thermal protection system to reduce the erosion or ablation of the body during hypersonic atmospheric flight. In Section 2.3, three studies [12, 14 & 16] su^ested a passive thermal

protection system utilizing conventional refractory materials would be sufficient for thermal protection; however two studies [13 &15] concluded a high performance active cooling system is required for adequate thermal protection of the launch vehicles. Determining the thermal effects experienced by an individual material package in a material package stream is a challenging problem, since the thermal effects are highly coupled to the hypersonic fluid flow about the material package stream. Early in this project; Dr. Salustri suggested that evaluating the actual fluid flow conditions about the material package stream would be beyond the scope of this project Since the thermal effects are highly associated with the actual fluid flow conditions, determining the thermal effects experience by the material packages must be deferred until flow effects about the material package stream are known. It will be assumed that a thermal protection system is possible for a material package stream since previous studies [12,13,14,15 & 16] have determined ^ thermal protection system is possible for a single launch body. It is postulated that the ideal case is, the material package stream would create slip-stream fluid flow effects that would create a low density tube of air to form around the material package stream. Therefore ideally, the reduced air density around the material package stream would reduce the thermal effects on individual material such that a thermal protection material is not required; therefore, the material package could be completely raw material. A detailed analysis of the fluid flow and thermal characteristics is needed to determine if the physical effects about the

55

material package stream conform to the proposed ideal case. Potentially, a member of the open engineering development community of this project would perform this analysis. Without a detailed analysis o f the fluid flow and thermal effects, the design o f the OpenMDS will precede according to assumptions for the material package stream fluid flow characteristics. The concept map. Figure 3.1, depicts that the design parameters for the material packages are affected by the design parameters o f the launcher and `catcher' satellite sub-systems. Therefore, like the design of the launcher sub-system, the design parameters of the OpenMDS will be used to calculate the design parameters for the material packages. Details of the calculation method and results are discussed in Section 3.3,3.4 and 3.5.

3.2.3

`Catcher* Satellite Sub-system
The `catcher* satellite (CatSat) sub-system is responsible for capturing the material

package stream and either utilizing the material for onboard manufacturing processes or distributing the material to a space construction project The concept map. Figure 3.1, identifies the altitude o f the CatSat as the main design parameter. The altitude of the CatSat affects the design parameters of the launcher and material packages. To simpUfy the design of the launcher sub-system, it is initially assumed the altitude of the CatSat would correspond to a geosynchronous (GEO-SYNQ Earth orbit A GEO-SYNC altitude simplifies the design of the launcher sub-system because the CatSat would be stationary with respect to a launcher. At GEO-SYNC, the satellite is orbiting at the same rate as Earth's rotation; therefore, the launcher can operate continuously without having a launch window. The required launcher mechanism could be constructed as a stationary device pointing at the same region of the sky, since it would not be required to slew the launch direction.

3.3

Evaluation of Baseline Mass Driver System
Since this is to be an `open engineering' project, it is very important that all the information

regarding the project be accessible to all participants of the project To facilitate the openness of the project, ideally, all software used for the design of the mass driver should be either an OSS product or at least a common, low-cost commercial product An extensive search was conducted to find the aforementioned software products to calculate the launch of hypcrvelocity masses from 56

the Earth's surface. A software product for evaluating the OpenMDS was sought because it would speed up the development time of the `prototype' design; therefore, more effort could allot to attracting a volunteer development team. The closest software candidate was NASA's Optimal Trajectories by Implicit Simulation' (OTIS) code, disttibuted by NASA Glenn Research Center's Commercial Technology Office. The program is capable o f calculating the flight of a hypervelodty body firom Earth's surface to orbit The program is a quasi-fireeware product The program is available for firee download to United States citizens only; however, the program relies on a non-linear optimization program, SNOPT, which must be purchased separately firom Stanford Business Software Inc. Since, the SNOPT program must be purchased and the author and many potential participants are not American citizens, the OTIS program was not further considered for the evaluation of the mass driver system. Since no software product for evaluating the mass'driver system was freely available, a calculation method had to be created. A goal of this study is to evaluate the physical feasibility of the OpenMDS concept; therefore, an order of magnitude estimate for design parameters would be sufficient to access the physical feasibility of the preliminary design. At this stage of development, a highly accurate calculation method is not required. A more accurate calculation method will be required for the detailed design o f the OpenMDS. The launch o f a series of hypersonic masses from the Earth surface is a complicated situation to calculate; therefore, the calculation method evolved from first a simple mathematical model of the situation to progressively more detailed models. The OpenMDS was evaluated using two calculation methods, first a 2-dimensional gravity-only mathematical model and then a 1-dimensional simulation model which accounts for gravity, aerodynamic drag and approximate launch corridor effects. The following two Sections mtroduce the calculation methods used.

3.3.1

was defined and solved using the Maple mathematical solver program. Using the Maple program hinders the `openness' of the solution since the program is not fireely available. However, potential participants to the project could use a numerical method or another mathematical solving program to obtain design parameter values. The user enters the launch mass, launch angle and launch velocity into the Maple work sheet Then Maple is used to calculate the maximum altitude or apogee of the launch mass, the velocity at apogee and the launch energy. Figure 3.2 depicts a schematic for the first calculation method. The launch velocity was manually varied to determine the velodty required to reach an apogee at GEO-SYNC for a range of launch angles and masses. Section 3.4.1 details the calculation method and Section 3.5.1 details the results for the 2dimensional launch in Earth's gravity field.

3.3.2

Introduction to the 1-D Gravity and Aerodynamic Drag Simulation Model with Approximate Launch Corridor Effects
The second calculation method considered a 1-dimensional launch from Earth's surface

(vertical launch) with Earth's gravity, aerodynamic drag and an approximate drag redudng launch corridor acting on a single launch body. This model improves the functionality of the first model by considering the aerodynamic drag on a hypersonic body traveling through the various regions o f Earth's atmosphere and also approximates the launch corridor crated by the slip-stream effects. Evaluating the slip-stream aerodynamic drag effects about a series of hypersonic inline bodies and the air properties of the launch corridor created by a steady state hypersonic material package stream is a fluid flow problem that has not been extensively studied. Section 4.2.4 details what is known about the aerodynamic effects of hypersonic slip-stream flows. Therefore, instead 58

of attempting to evaluate the actual slip-stream effects, this simulation model was programmed to establish a range of possible design values by evaluating ideal case and worst case situations. The ideal case is the operation of a steady state material package stream which causes vacuum conditions in the launch corridor or a zero density tunnel through the atmosphere. The

calculation method approximates this ideal case by eliminating the aerodynamic drag on the material package (100% drag reduction case). The worst case for the launch is the operation of the steady state material package stream that does not change the air density conditions of the launch corridor (0% drag reduction). The calculation method approximates the worst case by imposing the full aerodynamic drag on the material package; the same conditions the material package would experience if it traveled alone through the atmosphere. Before the simulation model was attempted, an analytical solution similar to mathematical model #1 was initially attempted but proved to be erroneous. Since the analytical solution was erroneous, a simulation model was created by programming an Excel spread sheet A simulation solution was a better solution because it was easier to calculate the drag effects and atmospheric properties than the analytic approach. The user is required to input the launch velocity, launch frequency, material package diameter, material package density, launch mass and percent drag reduction caused by the launch corridor. The ideal and worst case launch corridor conditions are specified by the user; the user can specify the ideal case of a perfect vacuum launch corridor by specifying 100% drag reduction or any value up to no drag reduction corresponding to 0% drag reduction. The spreadsheet then calculates the launch energy, launch apogee, velocity at apogee, spacing between material packages ^ d length to diameter ratio of the material packages. The launch velocity was manually varied to obtain a GEO-SYNC apogee for the range of launch mass from 1 gram to 10 kg. The material package diameter and density are used by the spreadsheet to calculate the length of the material package. The drag calculation used by the model was based on experimental data for a hypersonic finned missile with a length to diameter ratio of 24 [31]. The material package diameter was manually varied to until a length to diameter ratio of 24 was achieved. Figure 3.3 depicts a schematic for the second mathematical model. Section 3.4.2 details the calculation method and

59

Section 3.5.2 details the results for the 1-dimensional launch with Earth's gravity and aerodyinamic drag. The Excel program improves the `openness' of the information related to the project Excel is a common software product installed on many home PC; therefore, it is likely that many potential users would have access to the program and be familiar with operating the program. Additionally, the Excel program was chosen because the author is more famiUar with programming in Excel than other programming languages. This familiarity expedited the

evaluation o f the mass driver system since little learning was necessary to program the simulation.

To solve the system of equations the initial launch conditions must be specified. The initial position o f the launch site (at time zero) was specified as the radius of the Earth's equator as, r(0) = 6 371000m (eq. 3.7)

The Maple program was used to solve the system of differential equations formed by equations 3.5 and 3.6 and given the initial conditions, equations 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 specified by the user. Maple could not find a closed form solution to the differential equations, so the Runge Kutta numerical method was used to determine the maximum radius, r;,^^, or apogee of the ballistic trajectory and the angular rotation of the material package at apogee. As mentioned in the Section 3.3.1, the user varied the input parameters manually until an apogee at GEO-SYNC was determined.

This second calculation method improves the launch results by considering aerodynamic drag on the matpn'al package and approximating the effects of the launch corridor. The spreadsheet for the simulation model was developed under the following assumptions. 3.4.2.1 Assum ptions 1. The launch angle is vertical and the launched mass will follow a straight line trajectory since Earth rotation is neglected for this model 2. The lower atmospheric density was assumed to be defined by a density function defined by data firom the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) Standard Atmosphere [33]. 3. The upper atmosphere was assumed to follow a density function defined by the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere [34]. 4. The atmospheric temperature was defined by functions for each temperature region depicted in Figure 3.5 [33]. 5. All temperature functions between temperature regjons were assumed to be linear. 6. Experimental total drag coefficient as a function of Mach number for a hypervelodty missile was used [31]. The experimental drag co-effidcnt assumed a fin stabilised missile with an L /D of 24. 7. The package material was assumed to be steel and the geometry was assumed to be a simple cylinder. 8. The simulation model assumed constant decderation during each time step.

The Figure 3.5, above, depicts a vertical launch firom an arbitrary location on Earth s equator to a GEO-SYNC orbit The density and temperature regions o f the atmosphere are depicted. The distances shown in the Figure are not to scale. The simulation spreadsheet performs the following calculation steps: 1. The user inputs the desired time step (calculation interval), launch velocity, launch altitude (specified as sea-level), launch frequency, material package mass, material package diameter, material package density and percent slip-stream drag reduction. The user may also change the constant properties for the Earth and the air. 2. The frontal area, volume, length, L /D (length to diameter) ratio, launch energy and spacing o f the material package is calculated. The mass transfer rate and the launch power o f the system is calculated. See Part A for the calculations. N O T E : It is im portant that the L /D ratio close to 24, since the drag coefficient data used by the spreadsheet is based on an L /D ratio of 24 (see Part F). L /D ratio is adjusted by the user by manuaUy changing either the diam eter o f the package or the density.

The gravity (F q), drag (Fp) and resultant (F r) force for the material package is calculated according to equations in Part G. 10. The average acceleration, a,,^, (deceleration) experienced by the material package during the time step, is calculated according to Part H. 11.

The advantage of hypersonic travel can be observed in Figure 3.7, which is the drag co-efficient decreases as the velocity surpasses about Mach 1.8. At high hypersonic speeds (> Mach 8) the drag-coefficient approaches an asymptotic minimum value of about 0.1.

This calculation method is a simplistic means of evaluating a complex gas dynamic process occurring in the launch corridor. A slip-stream reduction factor of one hundred percent drag reduction is equivalent to the ideal case where the launch corridor conditions are a perfect vacuum. A slip-stream reduction factor o f zero percent is equivalent to the case where the launch corridor is the full density of the atmosphere at each region. These two cases represent the range of the expected drag effect, therefore the actual drag reduction effect exists at some point in this range.

Results from Calculation Methods for the Open Mass Driver System
The calculation methods were used to create a range of possible design parameters for the

OpenMDS. From performance estimates obtained from the calculation methods, a set of design parameters is selected and presented as the preliminary OpenMDS m Section 3.6. This

preliminary design represents the first design cycle for the mass driver system. The next two Sections will present the performance results and the observed trends obtained from the two mathematical models used.

3.5.1 Results for 2-D Gravity-Only Mathematical Model
The results parameters obtained from the first calculation method were the maximum altitude (or apogee) of the material package and the angular velocity of the material packages at apogee. These two resulting parameters were obtained over a range of launch angles and launch velocities. The results were obtained by first, setting the launch angle to 0 degrees (vertical lau )

and then incrementing the launch velocity up from 1 km/s until the launch velocity corresponding to a GEO-SYNC.apogee was achieved. This process was repeated for a launch angle of 25, 35, 45, and 55 degrees. The results of tlte apogee altitude vs. launch velocity are presented in Figure 3.9. It can be observed from Figure 3.9, that the lowest launch velocity to achieve any given altitude corresponds to a 0 degree or a vertical launch. This result is expected, since a vertical launch represents the shortest distance to any altitude. Therefore, the minimum launch velocity to reach a GEO-SYNC apogee was determined to be 10.306 km/s. launched at a zero degree angle. The largest angle. 55 degrees, consequently requires the latgest launch velocity. 17.97 km/s. to reach a GEO-SYNC apogee. The required launch velocities for the other launch angles are listed in Table 3.1.

At the maximum altitude (apogee), the angular velocity (vg or v-^^J, o f the material package was recorded for the same range o f launch angles and launch velocities. Table 3.1 lists the angular velocities for the material packages at a GEO-SYNC apogee. It can be observed in Table 3.1, that the general trend is as the launch angle increases, the angular velocity o f the material 74

T R E N D 2: Î Launch Angle => Î Angular Velocity of Material Package Since the material package is to be captured by the CatSat, the difference between the material package at apogee and the angular velocity of a satellite in a circular orbit at the apogee altitude is represented as the delta v quantity in Table 3.1. The general trend observed in Table 3.1 is as the launch angle increses, the velocity difference between the material package and the satellite decreases.

3: Î Launch Angle => J, Velocity Difference between Satellite and Package

Figure 3.10 is a graph of the velocity difference vs. launch velocity results. From Figure 3.10, it can be observed that for low launch velocities, thus low apogee altitudes, the effect of launch angle on launch velodty is relatively small since the lines in Figure 3.10 are dose together. However, at higher launch vdodties, thus higher altitudes, a larger launch angle significantly decreases the vdodty difference since the lines in Figure 3.10 diverge. The 55 degree launch angle has two vdodties, thus altitudes that correspond to satellite locations where the v d o d t y difference between the satellite and material package is zero. These zero vdodty locations correspo satellite orbits at about 3000 km and 11 000 km altitude. Note these altitudes are much lower than the 35 793 km altitude required for a GEO-SYNC orbit.

Figure 3.10: Results from 2D Gravity Only Model - Velocity Difference vs. Launch Velocity of Material Packages ^ 3.5.2 Results for 1-D Gravity and Aerodynamic Drag Simulation Model This model improves the results of the previous by including aerodynamic drag and an approximate launch corridor effect. However, this model essentially assumes a vertical launch; therefore, the effects of launch angle are excluded from these results. The results for this Idimensional model are concerned with evaluating how the size of the material package, traveling through the atmosphere, effects the launch requirements and the perfomunce of the mass driver system. The results for this model considered the launch o f material packages with masses ranging from I gram to to kg to GEO-SYNC altitudes. The launch corridor conditions were spedfred by the author to he either 0% slip-stream drag reduction, thus full atmosphere, or ICO»/, drag reduction, thus perfect vacuum. The 100% drag reduction case corresponds to the 0 degree launch angle in the first mathematical model. The material density of the material package was specified as steel and diameter of the material package was adjusted until a length to diameter rano o f 24 was achieved (the drag calculations are valid only for bodies with an L /D ratio of 24). The time step or calculation interval for the simulation was specified to he I second. Therefore, the 76

forces on the material package were calculated for each second of the flight The launch frequency was adjusted until the spacing between the material packages in the stream was 10 times the material package diameter. At this stage of evaluation, the value of 10 diameters separation was chosen as an estimate suggested by Professor S. Molder for the required spacing for slip-stream drag reduction to occur. Section 4.2.4 discusses the results of previous studies investigating slip stream or interference drag reduction at subsonic and hypersonic regimes. Table 3.2 lists the results obtained for the vertical launch of material packages ranging in mass from 1 gram to 10 kg to a GEO-SYNC apogee altitude. The smallest material package, 1 g total mass, has dimensions similar to a needle with a diameter of 1.09 mm and a length of 45.8 tnm. The largest material package, 10 kg total mass, has dimensions similar to a steel bar, with a diameter of 40.9 mm and a length of 990 mm. The dimensions for the material packages between these two extremes are listed in table 3.2.

The obvious trend for the geometry of the material package is, as the material package mass increases, the dimensions of the package increases since the density is assumed constant

TREND 4: Material Package Mass | => Dimensions of Material Package t
The spacing between the material packages in the stream ranges from a distance of 10,9 mm for the 1 gram material package to 409 mm for the 10 kg material package. Table 3.2 details the spacing for the other material packages. Since the spacing between the material packages is assumed to be ten times the diameter of the material package, the distance between the material package increases as the mass o f the material package increases.

TREND 5: Material Package Mass Î => Spacing (distance) between Material Package Î
The required launch velocity to reach GEO-SYNC for each material package is presented in Table 3.2 as two separate values. One velocity value assumes 0% drag reduction occurs in the launch corridor; therefore, each material package travels through the complete atmosphere. The second velocity value assumes the opposite condition, that is, the material package experience 100% drag reduction in the launch corridor or no aerodynamic drag. If no aerodynamic drag (100% drag reduction) acts on the material package, then the required launch velocity to reach GEO-SYNC was determined to be 10.31 km/s, shown in Table 3.2 for all material packages; the required launch velocity is independent of mass for the no drag situation. The no drag, vertical launch condition also serves a means of vaUdating the calculation of the simulation spreadsheet As stated in Section 3.5.1, the first calculation method determined the launch velocity for a no drag, vertical launch (0 degree launch angle) to GEO-SYNC altitude to be 10.306 km/s. Therefore, the analytical solution from the first model corresponds closely to the results obtained from the 1-D simulation spreadsheet The similarity in results validates the calculation method of the simulation spreadsheet with regards to Earth's gravity field. When fbU. aerodynamic drag is acting on the material package, the launch velocity to reach GEO-SYNC altitude depends on the mass of the material package. From table 3.2, the required launch velocity ranges from 11.07 km /s for a 10 kg material package (a 7.4% increase over the no

78

drag case) to 49.79 km/s for a 1 gram material package (a 383% increase over the no drag case). Figure 3.11 is a graph of the results for the launch velocities of the material packages in Table 3.2.

Figure 3.11: Results from ID Simulation Model - Launch Velocity and E n e i^ for 1 Gram to 10 Kg Material Packages to GEO-SYNC

Material packages with a mass of less than about 1 kg have launch velocity requirements that exponentially increase. Therefore, material packages less than 1 kg potentially can greatly benefit from slip-stream drag reduction (i.e. 383% for 1 gram package) because reducing the drag ^ould bring the drag line (blue line) in Figure 3.11, down near to the no drag line (red line) in Figure 3.11. Material packages greater than about 1 kg, would not benefit as much from slip stream drag reduction since the difference between the drag an no drag lines is small, ^.e. 7.4% for 10 kg material packages). Figure 3.12 extends the size of material package to 1000 kg. Notice that ihe drag and no drag lines approach each other near 1000 kg.

Therefore, for large material packages, the effect o f atmospheric drag is small.

The

physical reasoning behind this result is, larger material packages have more mass and less frontal area than smaller material packages; therefore, larger material packages have greater momentum at lower velocities and are not decelerated by the atmosphere as much as smaller material packages. Therefore, the general trends observed for launch velocity is, launch velocity is constant for all mass not experiencing aerodynamic drag; however, for material packages subjected to drag forces, increasing mass causes the required launch velocity to decrease.

TREND 6: Material Package Mass | => Launch Velocity Constant (for 100% drag reduction) => Launch Velocity I (0% drag reduction)
Figures 3.12 also depict the launch energy associated with each material package. The launch energy increases linearly with the size of the material package. The general trend is an increase in the material package mass causes the launch energy to increase.

TREND 7: Material Package Mass f => Launch Energy |

The required launch frequency to achieve a stream of material packages, with 10 diameter sparing between them, is effected by the launch velocity of the material package and the size of the material package. The launch frequency ranged from 7 374 Hz for 10 kg material packages to 160 000 Hz for 1 gram material packages. For comparison, the frequency of the fastest conventional gun (GE Vulcan rotary cannon*) is about 120 shots/s (Hz) and the oscillation frequency of a quartz crystal in a wrist watch is about 32 000 H z\ The general trend is an increase in the material mass causes a decrease in the launch frequency. T R E N D 8: Material Package Mass f = > Launch Frequency J. The ideal, 100% efficient, supply power needed to operate the mass driver material stream is listed in Table 3.2. The launch mechanism for launch a stream of 1 gram material packages was determined to require about 8500 MW, which is equivalent to the output of 17 nuclear reactor power generation units (500 MW each). The 10 kg material package stream launcher requires a considerably larger supply power of 3 920 000 MW, which is equivalent to about 7830 nuclear reactor units. The general trend is an increase in material package mass causes an increase in the supply power required.

The productivity of the mass driver launch system is defined by the mass transfer rate. The calculated mass transfer rate for the material package stream is depicted in Table 3.2. The mass transfer rate for the 1 gram material package stream was determined to be 576 tonnes/hr, which is equivalent to 0.48% of the 2003 world steel production [36]. The 10 kg material package stream has a mass transfer rate of 262 464 tonnes/hr, which is equivalent to about 223% of the 2003 world steel production. The general trend is an increase in material package mass causes an increase in the mass transfer rate.

The usefulness o f the mass driver system is defined by the time required to supply material to space construction projects. The time require to supply material continuously was determined using the mass transfer rate for each material package mass and the size of the project from Section 2.7. The 1 gram material package stream could supply construction material for a Mir stafion in 7 minutes, an international station in about 24 minutes, a 10 000 person habitat in about 26 month, a 70 000 person habitat in 128 months and an 820 000 person habitat in about 298 months. The 10 kg material package stream could supply construction material for a Mir station in 0.9 seconds, an international station in about 3 seconds, a 10 000 person habitat in about 0.05 month, a 70 000 person habitat in 0.28 months and an 820 000 person habitat in about 0.65 months. 3.6 Implications of Results on Open Mass Driver System Design

Below are the important trends from the results of the mathematical model. T R E N D 1: t Launch Angle = > | Launch Velocity T R E N D 2: f Launch Angle = > f Angular Velocity of Material Package T R E N D 3: f Launch Angle = > | Velocity Difference between Satellite and Package ,

To simplify the design of the launcher, it is desired that the launch velodty requirement for the launcher to be minimum, this requires the launch angle to be minimized. To simplify the design of the catcher satellite, it is desired that the velocity difference between the material package and satellite be minimized, this requires the launch angle to be maximized. Therefore, a single launch angle value can not be beneficial both for the launcher and the catcher satellite. The selected launch angle will represent a compromise between reducing the launch velocity for the launcher and reducing the velocity difference for the catcher satellite. The preliminary design of the mass driver assumes the launch angle is near vertical, since the results of the second mathematical model are for a vertical launch. (Selecting an appropriate launch angle is deferred to the next Chapter, Chapter four, where further analysis is detailed.)

The following are the important trends from the simulation spread sheet

9: Material Package Mass j"=> Supply Power |

TREND 10; Material Package Mass | => Mass Transfer Rate f
To simplify the design of the launcher, it is desired that the launch velocity, launch energy, launch frequency and supply power be minimized. By observing the trends listed above it is obvious that simultaneously minimizing all four aforementioned values is not possible. To

minimize the launch velocity and launch frequency the mass of the material package should be increased but increasing the mass of the material package increases the required launch energy and power. Therefore, just like the launch angle, the selected mass of the material package represents a trade off between the benefits of increasing the mass to reduce the launch velodty and energr and the benefits of redudng the mass to reduce the launch energy and supply power requirements. The material transfer rate is also linked to the mass of the material package. However, it cannot be simply stated that maximizing or minimizing this parameter has a dear benefit The next Section will use this parameter as the starting point for the preliminary design for the OpenMDS.

3.6.1

Preliminary Design for the Open Mass Driver System
The logeai place to start the design is to consider the mission that the mass driver system

will be used to supply construction material. The important parameter determining the usefulness of the mass driver system is the rate that it can transfer construction material to orbit If the material transfer rate is too small, the system will be not be capable of keeping up with demand for the construction material. Conversely, if the rate is too high, the material will be supplied at a rate

greater than that could be utilized, so the material would have to be stored or discarded and the mass driver system could potentially sit idle waiting for the next job. The desired material transfer rate is more easily determined if the time to supply material to a space construction project is considered. Consider a space construction project to construct a habitat for 10 000 people. This population of people is equivalent to the size of many small towns. From the results in table 3.2, a 10 kg material package stream operating continuously could provide the required material to this project in about 1.5 days (0.05 months). The energy supply for the 10 kg material package stream is the highest for the material package masses considered at the equivalent power of about 7830 nuclear reactor units (3 920 000 MW*) or about 0.02% of 2002 world electrical power output [37]. However, the 10 kg material package stream offers the lowest launch velocity, in table 3.2, at 11.07 km/s for the 0% drag reduction case and the lowest launch frequency requirements (of the masses considered) at 7374 Hz packages/s) for a 10 diameter separation. The 1 gram material package stream provides material at a more reasonable rate for future space construction projects. The required material to build a 10 000 person space habitat,

equivalent to a small town, could be supplied in a little more than two years. The supply power for the 1 gram material package launcher is the smallest, of the material package masses considered, at 8500 MW, which is equivalent to 17 nuclear reactor units or about 0.0005% of the 2002 world electrical power output [37]. However, the 1 gram material package launcher has the highest launch velocity requirements for the 0% drag reduction case at 49.79 km/s and the highest launch frequency requirements at 160 000 Hz packages/s) to maintain a 10 diameter separation. To better establish what an acceptable launch velodty for the baseline mass driver design should be, the launch velodty for the range of material packages masses was compared to the values published for launcher technologies in the studies mentioned in Section 2.3 and other direct launch studies. Figure 3.12 compares the material package launch vdodty both for 0% and 100% drag reduction to the actual launcher systems (solid data points) and proposed launcher systems

Figure 3.13: Comparison o f Launch Velocity for Present and Proposed Launcher Technology to the Material Package Stream Mass Driver

The minimum launch velocity that the launch technology must achieve for the baseline design is the 10.31 km/s for the ideal case that the material packages travel with 100% drag reduction. The potential launch technology would perferably exceed this minimum launch velocity because it is possible that the launch corridor conditions will not cause a 100% reduction in aerodynamic drag. The maximum launch velocity requirement for the launcher technology

corresponds to the velocity required to launch the material packages with 0% drag reduction. This possible range of velocity values is depicted in Figure 3.13 as a red shaded region.

85

Therefore in Figure 3.13, it can be seen that two actual raiigun designs (two solid triangles) have accelrated mass in the order of grams to velocities that exceed the 10.31 km/s minimum requirement However, when the maximum launch velocity requirement for the material packages is considered, one o f the actual raiigun designs meet the velocity requirement for aU material package masses greater than about 100 grams. It must be pointed out that, these two actual raiigun designs are based on accelerating small masses, in the order of grams; scaling the raiigun design up to accelerate masses greater than 100 grams might be technically difficult Two

proposed raiigun designs, (one being the NASA Nuclear waste concept of Section 2.3.6), propose utilizing raiigun technology capable o f exceeding the minimum launch velocity and meet the maximum launch velocity for material package masses greater than nearly 10 grams The

Lofstrom launch loop of Section 23.10, is depicted in Figure 3.13 as the two proposed novel launchers (blue star data points) capable of achieving and slightly exceeding the minimum launch velocity requirements. The majority of the actual and proposed launcher technologies depicted in Figure 3.13 are below the mimimum launch velocity because most of the investigation into direct launch to space is focussed on delivering satellites to LEO. To better establish the launch energy requirements for the range o f material package masses, the launch energy for the 0% and 100% drag reduction were compared to the launch energy of actual and proposed launcher technologies in Figure 3.14. From Hgure 3.14, the three conventional cannon launchers (solid blue diamonds) meet the required launch energy for the entire range of material packages considered. The conventional canon launchers however, do not meet the minimum velocity requirement (seen in Figure 3.13); therefore, this technology is not a suitable for the mass driver launcher technology. However, four actual raiigun designs (solid fed triangles centered around the 1 kg launch package) exceed the energy requirements for the material packages with mass less than about 100 grams. An actual fight gas gun design is also capable of meeting the energy requirements for material packages with mass less than about 1 kg. Proposed raiigun, coilgun, and the novel launchers (Molder launch rail of Section 2.3.7 and Lofstrom launch loop of Section 2.3.10) have launch energies that exceed the requirements of the material packages.

Therefore, for the preliminary OpenMDS, when considering the material transfer rate, launch velocity and launch energy effects, it seems that the extreme material package masses, the 1 gtam and 10 kg material package streams, have drawbacks that outweigh the benefits. Even though the 1 gram material package stream has very desirable material transfer rate the 1 gram stream has the risk of requiring launch velocity that is nearly five times the minimum launch velocity if the launch corridor drag reduction effects are small. Additionally, the 160 000 Hz (packages/second) launch frequency is unlikely to be achieved in the near term since the launch frequency is three orders of magnitude greater than the fastest rotary cannon and more than four htnes greater than the oscillation frequency of the quartz crystal in a wrist watch. On the other end of the mass range, as previously mentioned, the 10 kg material package has a material transfer rate that is capable of supplying enough material to construct a 10 000 87

person habitat in about 1.5 days. This material transfer rate is obviously too high, since it is unlikely that any near term construction process could utilize material at this rate since it is equivalent to building an entire town in a day and a half. From table 3.2 the rate of material transferred, associated with the 10 kg material package, is equivalent to more than double (223%) the 2003 world production o f steel. Also the power requirements of 7830 nuclear reactor units for the 10 kg launcher seem unpractical for any near term launch facility. Therefore, a trade-off exists between the potential high launch velocity and launch frequency of the 1 gram material package stream and the high material transfer rate of the 10 kg material package stream, it was decided that the baseline mass driver design will utilize a 10 gram material package stream. The 10 gram material package stream has the potential of requiring a launch velocity of only about twice the minimum launch velocity or 21.18 km /s and the launch frequency is lowered to less than half the 1 gram frequency at 73 720 Hz packages/s). The

number of nuclear reactor units to supply the 10 gram material package stream is about four times greater than the 1 gram material package stream at 79 reactor units but much less than the 10 kg material package stream. The material transfer rate for the 10 gram material package stream is capable of supply all the construction material to a 10 000 person habitat in about 5.56 months. Considering the launch velocity and energy comparison of figures 3.13 and 3.14, it seems that the raiigun technology is the most capable technology since actual systems have been demonstrated that achieve thé velocity and energy requirements for the minimum requirements and proposed raiigun designs nearly meet the maximum launch velocity requirements for the no drag reduction case. None of the potential launch technologies reviewed in Section 2.5 are capable of rapid successive launches. The raiigun and coilgun seem to be the easiest technologies to be enhanced to provide rapid launch capability, since conceptually it would be `merely" a matter of providing sufficient electrical energy, an armature, and a material package. The coilgun was not chosen since actual and proposed designs do not meet the minimum velocity requirements. The light gas gun, Molder's launch rail and the conventional cannon were not chosen because the designs do not easily allow rapid successive launch capabilities. The Lofstrom launch loop seems to be capable of the minimum launch velocity and energy requirements however this technology was not chosen because the concept requires further research and demonstration.

88

Figure 3.15 summarizes the preliminary design of the mass driver system.

This

preliminary design represents the first design cycle for the mass driver system. The resulting performance of the 10 gram material package stream is not ideal. In fact, the material transfer rate for continuous operation seems too high to practical for any near term space project and even the minimum velocity requirement are challeng^g to achieve with present and proposed launch technologies. Therefore, instead of continuing the design work on this preliminary concept, the next Chapter, Chapter four, describes the next iteration of the design cycle. The goal of the design work describe in Chapter four, is to define a mass driver system with lower launch velocity requirements, lower mass transfer rate and generally a system design that could be useful in the near term for the supply of space construction projects.

Chapter 4 Evaluation and Design of an Improved Open Mass Driver System
4.1 Overview of the Design Approach
A design goal of the OpenMDS is to create a prototype design that is interesting and feasible in order to attract a development community. The eady results of the open eng^eering attempts (see Section 5.4) indicated a feasible `prototype' OpenMDS design was required to attract volunteer developers. Therefore, the design goal for the project was to quickly identify a design for the mass driver that would be potentially feasible and have interesting design elements to attract the attention of potential volunteers. It was accepted that the proposed design may have errors but it is these errors that may entice a person with expertise to join the project to improve the design. OSS and open engineering projects are more tolerant to errors and more capable of taking risks and failing than commercial design projects because the cost of failure for OSS and open engineering projects is negligible. It is through these series of failures the path to a

successful design may be found. The proposed design process is summarized by the IDEO motto, "Fail often to succeed sooner" [38]. The preliminary design presented in Chapter 3 has performance characteristics that are not practical for any near term space construction project. However, through the process of defining the preliminary OpenMDS of Chapter 3, a general approach to the design of the mass driver was realized. The design process can be simplified to specifying the design parameters of five sub systems. These five sub-systems are depicted in Figure 4.1, as the launch trajectory, orbital trajectory, launcher mechanism, material package and the `catcheri satellite (CatSat). Figure 4.1 also depicts the design parameters that are either shared between the sub systems or affect the sub-system. The overall design of the mass driver system is complicated by the interrelatedness of the sub-systems. Changing a design parameter to improve the design of one sub-system may have a negative effect on another sub-system. The purpose of this chapter is to improve the design of the preliminary design presented Chapter 3. This Chapter begins the design process by describing the evaluation and selection of the appropriate launch trajectory. From there, the orbital trajectory of the CatSat was considered.

Once the launch and orbital trajectories are specified, the requirements from these trajectories are used to consider the design o f the appropriate launcher mechanism, material package and CatSat It must be indicated that the design detailed in Chapter four has been exclusively performed by the author under the guidance o f Dr. F. A. Salustri. The design results of Chapter four are not the result o f the Open Engineering collaboration.

4.2

Launch Trajectory Evaluation
ITie preliminary OpenMDS design proposed in Section 3.6.1 has minimum launch velocity

requirements that are at the upper limit o f demonstrated present launcher technology. If the launch corridor is not the ideal case of a perfect vacuum, then the launch velocity requirements increase and are satisfied only by proposed raiigun designs that require further research and experimentation. Iherefore, for the mass driver design to be practical in the near term, it would be prudent to reduce the range o f required launch velocity to a level that is easily achievable with present technology. Since the ideal case assumes no aerodynamic drag is acting on the material package, the only means o f reducing the launch velocity is by reducing the apogee height from GEO-SYNC to a lower orbit.

92

Two lower apogee altitudes are considered in the following analysis, one at 10 000 km and the second at 400 km altitude. The 10 000 km altitude is close to the 11 000 km altitude identified in the results for the 2D gravity only model of Section 3.51, as the altitude that corresponds to a Zero velocity difference between the material package and CatSat for the 55 degree launch angle. Therefore, at the 10 000 km altitude, it is expected that a reasonable launch angle should minimize the velocity difference between the material package and the CatSat. The 400 km altitude

represents a typical height for LEO. Since 400 km is very close to Earth compared to the GEO SYNC altitude of 35 793 km, the launch velocities should be substantially reduced. However, launching to a lower altitude complicates the design of the OpenMDS. Since at altitudes are lower than GEO-SYNC, the CatSat is no longer stationary with respect to the launcher on the ground. If the CatSat is located in an orbit lower than GEO-SYNC, then the CatSat has an orbital period less than the 24 hour rotation rate of Earth. Therefore, launching material packages to the CatSat can no longer be a continuous operation; there will be a period of time when the satellite is visible to the launcher and a period of time when the satellite is not visible to the launch site on Earth. The duration of these periods will depend on the type of orbit and the orbital altitude of the CatSat The duration of time when launch of material packages is possible is known as the launch window. The following Section, Section 4.2, will investigate the kunch window for the selected launch trajectory. The results firom the 2-D gravity only model discussed in Section 3.51, determined that there is a very large velocity difference between the material package at apogee and the orbiting CatSat for all launch angles except the 55 degree launch angle. These results indicate that at low launch velocities, thus altitudes less than GEO-SYNC, the velocity difference between the material package and a CatSat in a circular orbit (at the apogee altitude) is very high and range from about 1000 m /s (approximately the velocity of a bullet) to about 7000 m/s. Designing a capture system on the CatSat capable of stopping multiple high velocity bodies probably is not practical If the design was possible, then the `catcher' sateUite would require a large amount of energy to mamtain its orbit, due to the reaction force created by the capture event The capture event will occur over a very short time interval due to the high velocity difference. Duong this bnef time interval the CatSat has only one attempt at capturing the material package since the material package would 93

return to Earth on the ballistic launch trajectory. Therefore mitigating the velocity difference is an important design consideration. The traditional method o f changing the velocity of spacecraft in space is with a rocket motor. Firing a rocket motor onboard the material package could reduce the velocity difference by increasing the velocity of the material package. The velocity of the material package could be increased enough to place the material package in a minimum energy elliptical orbit, with the perigee (lowest orbital altitude) just above Earth's sensible atmosphere (about 200 km). If the perigee altitude was set much lower than this, the material package orbit would rapidly decay due to atmospheric drag and the material package would return to Earth, Placing the material package in orbit is benefldal because the aforementioned velocity difference would be reduced and the CatSat has more than one attempt to capture the material package, A CatSat, located in a suitable orbit, could potentially rendezvous with the material package numerous times. To evaluate launching material packages from Earth and firing a rocket motor for orbital insertion, the 1-D simulation spreadsheet described in Section 3,3,2, was modified to calculate a 2dimensional launch from Earth's equator and includes a means of determining the effect and mass o f a rocket motor bum at apogee. Figure 4,2 depicts the development process of the simulation spreadsheets created for the launch trajectory analysis. Note the 2-D gravity-only model, of Section 3,2,1, is omitted from this graphic, it should appear before the 1-D Launch Simulation spreadsheet The next Section describes the functions of the new 2-Dimensional simulation models created.

4.2.1

Improved 2-Dimensional Simulation Spreadsheet Models
The Earth_Sim spreadsheet simulates a 2-dimensional launch from Earth's equator with

Earth and Moon gravity and aerodynamic drag acting on the material package. This spreadsheet is similar to the 1-D simulation spreadsheet, detailed in Section 3.3.2, except the launch scenario is extended to a 2-dimensional launch from Earth's equator. The user is required to input the material package mass, diameter, launch angle and launch velocity. These inputs are depicted as the blue boxes in Figure 4.2 for the Earth_Sim.xls spreadsheet in the upper left comer. The spreadsheet calculates the apogee altitude, launch energy and other resulting values for the material package. The output from the simulation is depicted as the green box in Figure 4.2. Like the 1-D simulation spreadsheet, the launch velocity was manually adjusted until the material package obtained the apogee altitudes of 10 000 and 400 km. The Earth_Sim spreadsheet was revised to include a means o f calculating the effect and size of an onboard solid rocket motor. The revised version is known as Earth_Sim_RevB.xls. The input parameters for the revised spreadsheet are the same as the previous version, except the user must also specify the velocity addition created by the firing of the rocket motor and the rocket motor performance parameters. The blue boxes in Figure 4.2 depict the input parameters to the Earth_Sim_RevB model. The output parameters are the same as the Earth_Sim spreadsheet except the mass o f the required rocket motor is calculated and the resulting orbital trajectory is displayed in a graphic. Figure 4.2 depicts that the Earth_Sim_RevB model was revised to include the effects of Earth's rotation. The new model, Earth_Sim_RevC, has the same input and output parameters as the Earth_Sim_RevB model. The final revision of the simulation spreadsheet was done to approximate the effects of the launch corridor. Like the method used for the 1-D simulation spreadsheet of Section 3.3.2, the user specifies the percentage of drag reduction created by the launch corridor. The following Sections will discuss the calculation method implemented by the Earth_Sim spreadsheet and the subsequent revisions, the results and a discussion of hypersonic slip-stream effects in the launch corridor.

Calculation for Improved 2-D Simulation Spreadsheet M odels

The EarthjSim spreadsheet and its subsequent revisions perform the calculations in a similar manner to the ID simulation spreadsheet of Section 3.4.2. The obvious difference

between the calculations methods is the Earth_Sim models have a second dimension. The other differences are the rocket motor impulse calculations and the calculation for Earth's rotation. The following Sections describe the assumptions and input, output and constant parameters for the Earth_Sim spreadsheet model. The calculation method for Earth_Sim.xls and the revisions are detailed in Appendix B.

The launch plane (2-D) is the Earth-Moon equatorial plane. The simulation is limited to three bodies, the Earth, material package and Moon. The simulation model assumed constant acceleration during each time step. The lower atmospheric density was assumed to be defined by a density function defined by data firom the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) Standard Atmosphere [33]. The upper atmosphere was assumed to follow a density function defined by the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere [34]. The atmospheric temperature was defined by functions for each temperature regjon depicted in Figure B-2 [33]. All temperature functions between temperature regions were assumed to be linear. Experimental total drag coefficient for a hypervelodty missile as a function of Mach number was used [31]. This drag co-efficient assumed a fin stabilised missile with an L /D of 24. The matetial package was assumed to be composed of steel and the geometry was assumed to be a simple cylinder. Velocity additions to "orbit" the material packages occur at apogee and utilise a solid rocket motor [39].

Results for the Improved 2-D Spreadsheet Models
The final revision of the spreadsheet, ·Earth_Sim_::RevD.xls, was used to generate the

results detailed in this Section, To verify the operation of the Earth_Sim.xls spreadsheet, the vertical launch of a 10 gram material package with no drag reduction to a GEO-SYNC alfimde was calculated. This launch scenario is identical to the scenario calculated using the 1-D simulation spreadsheet of Section 3.5.2, where the required launch velocity was determined to be 21.18 km/s. The required velocity for this launch scenario using the Earth_Sim_RevD simulation spreadsheet was determined to be 21.7 km/s. The two resulting launch velocities are very similar; therefore, the calculation method of the Earth_Sim spreadsheet seems to be valid for vertical launch scenarios. The validity for launching at angle was not explicitly determined; however, the results presented below correspond with the trend observed firom the analytical model of Section 3.5.1, that is an increasing launch angle requires an increasing launch velocity to reach any given altitude. There is a slight anomaly in this trend for each of the results table listed below. The 0 degree launch angle has a higher launch velocity than the 10 and 20 degree launch angle. The cause of the anomaly has not been extensively investigated, but it is suspected that the probable cause is the averaging of the x and y accelerations in the time step calculation of Part R of Appendix B. Table 4.1 represents the data obtained firom the Earth_Sim_RevD spreadsheet, for the launch of a 10 gram material package firom sea-level to a 400 km altitude with the launch angle varying firom 0 degrees (vertical launch) to 50 degrees. Two launch velocities are listed in the table. The first velocity corresponds to the 0% drag reduction case and the second velocity corresponds to the 100% drag reduction (no drag) case. All launch velocity values in table 4.1, represent velocities that are attainable by present launcher technology (see Figure 3.13 in Section 3.6.1). The spreadsheet was used to calculate the mass of the rocket motor needed to place the material package in the minimum energy, elliptical orbit The rocket motor performance was specified as a solid rocket motor with a specific impulse of 290s and a propellant mass fraction of 0.93, which correspond to values for typical high performance solid rocket motors [39].

Launching at 0 and 10 degree launch angles are not suitable since the required rocket motor mass is greater than the total material package mass of 10 grams. The launch angles from 20 to 50 degrees have rocket motor masses less than the 10 gram total. The payload mass fraction ranges from 0.1, that is 1 gram construction material and 9 grams rocket motor mass, for a 20 degree launch and 0.44, which is 4.4 grams construction material and 6.6 grams rocket motor mass, for a 50 degree launch angle. The launch velocities for launching 10 gram material packages to a 10 0000 km altitude for the no drag reduction case, are greater than 15 km/s which exceeds the capabilities of present launcher technology, see Figure 3.13 in Section 3.6.1. The 10 gram material package was not fruther considered for two reasons. Firsdy, the rocket motor mass estimate does not include the system required to determine when to fire the rocket; this system would likely require the remainder of the material package, even if this system was as simple as pyrotechnic fuse. Secondly, the launch velocity for the no drag reduction case exceeds the launch velocity capabilities of present launch technology; lower launch velocities are desired. Since the 10 gram material package is unsuitable, the next step is to evaluate material packages with larger masses. Increasing the mass obviously aids the problem for the firing system; however, according to the Trend 6 in Section 3.5.2, increasing the material package mass also reduces the required launch velocity. The 1 kg material package mass was chosen to be evaluated next, for launch and insertion to an elliptical orbit with a perigee altitude of 200 km and an apogee altitude of 400 km or 10 000 km. The 1 kg material package represents the middle of the remaining material package mass range of 100 g to 10 kg; therefore, if the 1 kg material package is determined to be unsuitable, the evaluation would consider either a lighter or heavier material package. Table 4.3 represents the results obtained for launching a 1 kg material package into an elliptical orbit with apogee and perigee of 400 km and 200 km altitude, respectively. The results are similnr to the results for the 10 gram material package, in that for a launch angle from 0 to 50 degrees, the mass of the required rocket motor is greater than the mass of the entire material package. The evaluation was extend to launch angles of 60 and 70 degree and it was determined that at 70 degrees the mass of the rocket motor was 0.85 kg which leaves 150 grams for the rocket firing system and construction material. The launch velocity to accomplish the launch at 70

103

degrees is 9.18 km /s for the no drag reduction case and 5.59 km/s for the 100% drag reduction (no drag) case. The velocity to overcome drag is about 39% of the launch velocity; this is more than the 5% estimated for NASA nuclear waste disposal railgun of Section 2.3.6, but this is expected since the size of the NASA launch mass was greater than 2000 kg and Figure 3.11 of

Section 3.5.2, depicted the launch velocity for the drag and no drag cases approach each other as mass approach 1000 kg. ................

The percent of energy used to overcome drag is 62.98% for the 70 degree launch angle and 26.43% for the vertical (0 degree) launch angle. In fact all angles below 50 degrees, require about one quarter of the launch energy to overcome drag. The energy lost to drag most likely would go to creating heat; therefore, launching at an angle of 70 degree would benefit most from the potential drag reducing effects created by the slip-stream launch corridor. The slip-stream drag effects could reduce the launch energy requirements for à material package launched at 70 degrees by over 60%. Therefore, the launch of a 1kg material package at 70 degrees launch angle into an elliptical orbit is a possibility; however, before selecting this scenario, the launch to 10 000 km is considered next. Table 4.4 contains the results for the launch of a 1 kg material package to an elliptical orbit with apogee and perigee of 10 000 km and 200 km, respectively. From table 4.4 it is evident that 0 and 10 degree launch angles are not feasible since required rocket motor mass exceed 1 kg. At the other end of the launch angle range, the 70 degree launch requires a launch velocity that is at the upper limit of present launcher technology, however, the payload mass fraction is very high at 0.9, that is, 0.1 kg rocket motor mass and 0.9 kg for firing system and construction material. Again the launch at 70 degrees would benefit firom the slip-stream reduction effects of the launch corridor since about 62.02% of the launch energy is required to overcome drag therefore, a 62.02% energy savings is possible if the launch corridor was a perfect vacuum (no drag). From inspection of Table 4.4, the results for launch angles firom 40 to 70 degrees represent the regon where the plausible design values for the mass driver system exist At the low end of the launch angle range, the 40 degree launch angle requires a launch velocity of 10.4 km /s for the no drag reduction case and 8.75 km/s for the 100% drag reduction (no dra^ case. The percent of energy associated with drag is 29.13%; therefore, a 29.13% energy savings would be possible if a perfect vacuum launch corridor condition (no dra^ existed.

Determining the optimum values for the launch trajectory requires a design trade-off analysis. It is desired that the launch velocity be reduced but reducing the velocity reduces the launch angle, payload mass fraction and the percent of launch energy associated with drag. It ts desired that the payload mass fraction be maximized since the purpose of the mass driver system is

106

to transport material to space. The purpose of the proposed material stream mass driver is to exploit the drag reducing slip-stream effects of the launch corridor; therefore, it is also desired to maximize the energy savings for creating the ideal case of a no drag launch corridor. At this stage of design, it is difficult to define if minimizing launch velocity is more important than increasing the payload mass firaction or maximizing the energy associated with drag potential slip-stream energy saving). Therefore, to advance the design process further, the 50 degree launch angle to a 10 000 km altitude was selected as a design parameter since it is roughly the middle of the range of angles considered and represents a conservative set of design parameters. The launch velodfy, for the 50 degree launch angle, ranges firom 8.824 km/s for the 100% drag reduction (no dra^ case and 10.92 km/s for the 0% drag reduction case. The payload mass fraction is 0.6, which is 0.4 kg for the rocket motor mass and 0.6 kg for rocket firing system and construction material. The energy associated with drag is 34.70%, which would represent a

moderate energy savings for a perfect vacuum launch corridor. Table 4.5 contains the estimated performance parameters for the selected 1 kg matprial package stream with either 0% or 100% drag reduction. Since the 10 diameter separation or spacing distance between the material packages, assumed in the results of Section 3.5.2, was merely an estimate, the separation distance range was extended to determine the effects separation has on the OpenMDS design. The separation distance was varied firom the original 10 diameters to a distance of 1000 diameters which would likely represent the upper limit where any slip-stream effects would occur.

The values in table 4.5 range firom the worst scenario*" case for launch corridor effects, where 10 diameter spacing creates no drag reduction to the performance of a best case scenario launch corridor effects where 1000 diameter spacing creates 100% drag reduction. It can be seen in table 4.5, that the separation distance has a significant effect on the launch firequency and the supply power requirements of the OpenMDS design. The launch firequency

ranges firom a high of 16 850 Hz (half the oscillation speed of a quartz crystal in a wristwatch) to a low o f 453 Hz (close to 100 Hz of conventional rotary cannon technology). The supply energy requirements range firom a plausible 36 reactor units to a demanding 2010 reactor units. The mass transfer rates are not compared to the space construction supply times, since the duration of the launch window has not been determined yet Section 4.2 will review the evaluation of the launch window. From the results in table 4.5, it is obvious the design of the mass driver is dependent on determining the drag reduction effects associated with the slip-stream effects in the launch corridor. The next Section will review the work performed to estimate the likely effect of the slip stream drag about hypersonic bodies. 4.2.4 E stim ating the H ypersonic Slip-Stream Effects It was determined early in this project that evaluating the actual hypersonic slip-stream effects which occur in a material package stream, operating at steady state, is beyond the scope of this project Instead o f directly determining the slip-stream effects, an appropriate goal for this project was to determine to be establishing an estimated range of slip-stream effects. An extensive review o f literature was performed to identify any previous work for the slip stream, drafting or interference drag effects occurring about hypersonic bodies. The starting point was first to investigate the slip-stream effect about subsonic bodies. Figure 4.5 depicts a schematic for the slipstream effect for two subsonic bodies. As the spacing between the bodies decrease, the pressure fields o f the first and second body interfere with

Note: if the worst case scenario exists then there is no purpose to establish a material package stream since no drag reduction occurs

each other. The second body's positive pressure field interferes with the first body's negative pressure field; the resulting interference pressure field could be positive or negative. The drag on the bodies is generally reduced because the magnitude of the pressure forces associated with the intermediate pressure region is reduced. Generally, the second body achieves a greater benefit from the slipstream effect; however, under certain conditions the opposite is true [40]. Figure 4.6 depicts the results for the slipstream of two circular disks in an axial laminar air flow field. In Figure 4.6, the leading disk, #1, has a constant drag co efficient and therefore experiences a constant drag force. The drag co-efficient of the rear disk, #2 varies considerably with the separation distance between the disks. For small separation distances (x < 2.2 D) the drag coefficient is negative; this indicates that second disk would experience a force pushing it towards the leading disk since the pressure field in front of the second disk is negative. At separation distances greater than 2.2 Diameters coefficient (x > 2.2 D), the with drag Ô 12

109

(x > 8 D), the drag coefficient is neatly equal to the leading disk. Therefore, at separation distances greater than 8 diameters, the slipstream effect for circular disks is minimal [40], Figure 4.7 depicts interference drag about two streamlined bodies. The overall drag

coefficient for these bodies is lower than the aforementioned circular disks because the bodies are slender and streamlined. The slipstream effect for streamlined bodies is different than the

previous results. For separation distances smaller than 0.8 times the length ( x<0.8L), the drag coefficient on the leading body is negative and decreases to zero as the separation distance approaches x = 0.8 L. As the separation distance increases beyond 0.8 L, the drag coefficient increases. An opposite effect occurs on the following second body, at small separation distances the drag coefficient is high and decreases as the separation distance increases. At large separation distances (x>4L), the drag coefficient for both bodies is nearly equal. However,
0.4

the drag coeffident for the second body is always greater than the drag coeffident for the leading body. Therefore, the

Cd

following body is always pushing the leading body forward since, the positive pressure region created in front of the second body is Jasser than the negative pressure field behind the leading body [40]. These experimental results s u re s t that for the material package stream to be effective, the material packages should be blunt bodies with large negative base pressures. If a picture was taken o f a steady state material package stream, it would look like a chain or cable of material packages extending out o f the atmosphere, depicted as an exaggerated view in Figure 4.8. The leading material would have no positive pressure acting on the nose, since it is out of the atmosphere; therefore, no drag acts on this material package. Unlike the situation depicted in Figure 4.6, the leading material package would have a drag-coefficient of zero. It is assumed, the only drag that would be acting on the material package stream would be sldn drag. It has been hypothesized that

a steady state material package stream would be similar to a very long cable traveling through a fluid. The

The

investigation was limited to separation distances of 1.5 diameters. Table 4.6 contains the drag coefficients determined by Raibov and the percent drag reduction. Raibov determined the drag reduction on the trailing cylinder for separation distances between 0.25 and 1.5 diameters ranged from about 81% to 75.6%. The Raibov data was extrapolated by curve fitting in Excel to the 10, 100 and 1000 diameters evaluation trajectory. used of the for the launch

distances and obtaining a 43% reduction in drag would be beneficial since the required launch frequency and supply power would be significantly reduced. 4.3 Launch Window Analysis
With the analysis and selection o f the launch trajectory completed, the next steps in the analysis, is to evaluate the launch window effects and the location of the CatSat. Figure 4.9

Figure 4.9: Overview of Launch Window and `Catcher* Satellite Orbit Analysis
112

presents an overview of the analysis to be discussed in Sections 4.3 through to Section 4.5.
To effectively utilize the elliptical, material package orbit, described in Section 4.2.3, it is proposed that the elliptical orbit be used as a `storage' orbit for material packages. The launcher will send up a series o f material packages during a suitable launch period or launch window. The CatSat, located in an orbit that intersects the storage orbit, collects the material packages from the storage orbit. When a suitable launch window exists again, the launcher sends a stream of material packages to restock the storage orbit. Due to Earth's rotation, there is only one time instant each day that the 10 000 km altitude apogee of selected launch trajectory overlaps the apogee of the equatorial elliptical storage orbit Figure 4.10 depicts the scenario viewed along Earth's polar axis. The location corresponding to the minimum energy requirement for placing material packages in an elliptical orbit occurs at the intersection of the launch trajectory and elliptical orbit apogee. It is possible to place the material package into an elliptical orbit by firing the rocket motor at intersection locations other than the apogee intersection but this will require a larger rocket motor bum than calculated in Section 2.1.3. (These other intersection locations can be imagined by rotating the launch trajectory in Figure 4.9 about the centre of Earth.) The following Section / i

Storage Orbit and Launch Trajectory Parameters To evaluate the possible launch window, the size

of the elliptical storage orbit and the launch trajectory ellipse, specified in Section 4.1.3, must be measured. The three parameters are required to specify the size of an ellipse, the semi-major axis (a), the semi-minor axis (b) and the linear eccentricity (c). These three parameters for the launch ellipse and the elliptical storage orbit were measured directly from the position data from the Earth_Sim_RevD.xls simulation spreadsheet and

Evaluating an 80 M inute D uration Launch Window The first step to evaluating the window was to determine how many degrees the Earth

rotates during an 80 minute period. The rotation angle was determined as follows. Degree Earth Rotation = Launch Window Duration x cO g^nh = 80 minutes x 4.1667 x 10'^ deg/s = 4800 s x 4.1667 x 10'^ deg/s = 20 degrees The next step was to create an AutoCAD model similar to Figure 4.13 with the launch trajectory apogee intersecting the apogee of the material package orbit One copy of the launch trajectory was rotated 10 degrees clockwise about the centre of Earth to simulate the position of the beginning of the 80 minute launch of the material package stream. Another copy of the launch trajectory was rotated 10 degrees counter-clockwise about the Earth centre to simulate the position of the end of the 80 minute launch of the material package stream. Figure 4.13 depicts the 80 minute launch window model. The intersection points P I, P2, and P3 depicted in Figure 4.13, represent the locations where the rocket motor must fire to place the material package in the same elliptical orbit To calculate the mass o f the required rocket motor, the velocity difference between the material package on the launch trajectory and the elliptical orbit at the intersection points is required. The velodiy of the material on the launch trajectory was determined by measuring the intersection point in AutoCAD and using this position data to lookup the velocity in the simulation data. The velocity of the material package in the elliptical orbit was looked up in a position verses velocity

The result is the rocket motor mass required for the material packages at the beginning and end o f the 80 minute launch window require a mass 27% greater than the material package launched at the centre o f the window. The other material packages between the middle and the beginning and end o f the launch window would require some portion o f the 27% increased mass depending on there position. While it is possible to incorporate a varying rocket motor mass for each matpn^l package during the 80 minute window, it complicates the design and manufacturing o f the mafptial package. The intention was to mass produce the material packages; therefore, it would be easier to mass produce the material packages if the specifications for each package were the same. The next Section investigates shortening the launch window to 10 minutes, in an attempt to minimize the rocket motor mass difference thus making the design o f each material package more `mass produceable*.

4.3.3

Evaluating a 10 Minute Duration Launch Window
The evaluation o f the 10 minute launch window was done in a similar manner to the 80

minute window, except using the following amount o f Earth rotation.

Degree Earth Rotation = Launch Window Duration x cO E anh
= 10 minutes x 4.1667 x 10'^deg/s = 600 s x 4.1667 x 10'^ deg/s = 2.5 degrees Figure 4.14 depicts the AutoCAD model created to determine the intersection locations. These intersection points are much closer together than for the 80 minute launch window. Similarly, the intersection positions where used to look up the corresponding velocities in the simulation data and the table created with Material_Package_Orbitxls. Table 4.8 summarizes the Velocities, the calculated velocity differences and the required rocket motor masses.

The resulting increase for the rocket motor mass is very small, on the order of less than 2%. Since the masses are nearly the same, it probably is possible to mass produce a material package with a rocket motor mass of about 1% greater than the middle material package (P2 ' r=5minutes) requirement The difference in the orbit caused by a 1% difference in the required rocket motor mass could be compensated by the actions of the CatSat The evaluation of the

AGI Satellite Toolkit (STK)'', was discovered to be capable o f simulating and visualizing the launch and orbit o f satellites. The STK's basic satellite calculation engine and 2D visualization viewer is free on request from AGI; therefore, this software product is compatible with the open engineering approach where all software tools used should be freely accessible to all. d he STK program also has a 3D visualization viewer; however, the 3D viewer is available for a 7-day free trail and afterwards must be purchased from AGI. The STK software was used to evaluate the six possible scenarios where the 'catcher' satellite could be located to collect material packages from the elliptical orbit. The launch

trajectory from the Earth_Sim__Rev.xls spreadsheet was imported into STK and the STK program was used to generate the material package and satellite orbits. The material package orbits created assume that the same orbital insertion rocket motor fires at apogee for all material packages launched during the 10 minute launch window (see Section 4.2.3). The

result is a slight 'smearing' of the material package orbit due to the 2.5 degrees of Earth rotation during the 10 minute launch period. Figure 4.16 depicts the launch

trajectories imported into STK and the resulting orbital smear for firing the rocket motor at launch trajectory apogee. The following six Sections present the six catcher satellite scenarios and the results obtained with STK. The author utilized the 7-day trial for the 3D viewer to create the Figure 4.16: Snapshot of STK Visualization of Material Package Launch and Orbit graphics in the following Sections.

The visualizations generated for this scenario, indicated that the CatSat travels faster that the material packages, so the CatSat approaches and coUects the material stream from the last to the first material package launched. The position and velocity data for the satellite and the material packages'' at the closest approach during the apogee rendezvous were recorded in Table 4.9 and the associated screen shots at the capture events are depicted beside the table.

Only three material packages are considered in the analysis, first, middle and last material package, these represent the extreme points of the material stream; the data for the rest of the material stream will lie between the values for these extreme points.

The position of the material packages and satellite are not a close as they appear in the Figure, the difference in distance is quite large, ranging from about 11.5 to 41.7 km. The velocity difference between the material packages and satellite is relatively large at about 1.2 km/s for the three material packages considered. The capture time is coinddently the same duration as the launch window which is 10 minutes. IxKating the CatSat in a 10 000 km orbit seems plausible but the difference in position and velocity at capture between the satellite and material packages is a significant problem. The next Section will look at an alternative satellite location.

Figure 4.18: Overview of `Catcher* Satellite in 200 km Circular Orbit

The visualizations generated for this scenario, indicated that the material packages travel faster that the catcher satellite, so the material packages approach the satellite from behind; therefore, the satellite collects the material packages in the order of launch first to last. The position and velocity data for the satellite and the material packages, at the closest approach during the perigee rendezvous, were recorded in Table 4.10 and the associated screen shots at the capture events are depicted beside the table. Like scenario 1, the distance between the satellite and the material packages at capture are lari ge, ranging from about 1.5 to 46.3 km. The velocity difference is higher than scenario #1, at about 1.5 km/s over the complete capture event. The duration of the capture event is shorter than

scenario #1, at about 3 minutes; therefore, the satellite is required to collect material packages at a frequency greater than the launch frequency. A high capture frequency would complicate the design o f the CatSat. Capturing the material package stream at perigee does not represent a better satellite location than scenario #1. location for material package capture.

Scenario #3 - Catcher Satellite in a Large Elliptical Orbit
In an attempt to reduce the position and velocity differences, scenario 3 attempts placing

the satellite in an elliptical orbit that has an orbital period o f exactly double the period o f the material package storage orbit. Since the material packages have an orbital period of half the `catcher' satellites, the material packages rendezvous with the `catcher' satellite once every two revolutions of the orbit. Figure 4.19 depicts the overview of scenario #3. The orbital period of the material package orbit was determined with STK software to be 3.39 hrs. The parameters of an elliptical `catcher' satellite orbit where adjusted until the period was 6.799 hrs and the trajectory was nearly tangent with material package orbit.

Figure 4.19: Overview of `Catcheri Satellite in Large Elliptical Orbit
The visualizations generated for this scenario, indicated that the catcher satellite travels faster that the material packages, so the catcher satellite approaches and collects the material stream from the last to the first material package launched.

Like scenario 1 and 2, the distance between the satellite and the material packages at capture are large, ranging from about 24.3 to 45.3 km. The velocity difference is higher than scenario #1 but slightly lower than scenario #2, at about 1.4 km/s over the complete capture event. The duration of the capture event is shorter than scenario #1 but longer than scenario #2, at about 8 minutes. The satellite is required to collect material packages at a frequency greater than the launch frequency; therefore, this would complicate the design of the CatSat. Capturing the material package stream with a CatSat located in an elliptical orbit tangent to the material package orbit does not represent a better satellite location than scenario #1. The next Section will evaluate another alternative satellite location for material package capture. 126

4.4.4

Scenario #4 - Catcher Satellite in Middle Material Package Orbit (capture at perigee) Given that the position and velocity differences for the three previous scenarios have been

large, a possible means of reducing the differences is to locate the catcher satellite in the same orbit as the middle material package. Therefore, the satellite could easily capture the middle material package, since it shares the same position and velocity. The remaining packages in the orbiting material package stream would fire a second rocket motor at perigee to propel the material package to the catcher satellite. The second rocket motor bum is assumed to propel the material package in a straight line with constant acceleration to the catcher satellite with the duration of the bum and transit to the catcher to occur over a 10 second period of time. Perigee was selected because the distances between the material packages are at a minimum at perigee; the material package stream squeezes together at this location. Figure 4.20 depicts an overview of scenario #4 at perigee of the material package orbit.

The rocket motor mass required to propel the last material package to the CatSat was determined to be 163.1 kg (see Appendix D for sample calculation). Obviously, this mass is much greater than the material package payload mass of 0.6 kg (mass after orbital insertion rocket bum); therefore, scenario #4 is not feasible. 4.4.5 Scenario #5 - Catcher Satellite in Middle Material Package Orbit (capture at apogee) Scenario #5 is the same as scenario #4 except the second rocket motor bum and capture occurs at apogee.

The rocket motor mass required to propel the last material package to the CatSat was determined to be 50.6 kg (see Appendix D for sample calculation). Obviously, this mass is much greater than the material package payload mass of 0.6 kg; therefore, scenario #5 is not feasible.

Scenario #6 - Catcher Satellite in Middle Material Package Orbit (manoeuvrable
satellite)

The final scenario considers using a second rocket motor bum either at apogee or perigee to nudge all mntorial packages into the same orbit, the middle material package orbit Forcing all the maWcl packages in the middle material package orbit removes the orbit smearing caused by the rotation of Earth during the 10 minute launch window. The second rocket motor bum is intended to occur at the locations where each material package intersects the middle material package orbit Figure 4.22 depicts an overview of Scenario # 6. The duration of the rocket motor bum is assumed to 1 second. Table 4.14 contains the velocity differences between the first and last material package with respect to the middle material package at the intersection points. The table includes the

represent the maximum required rocket mass for the material package stream launched during the ten minute window. Material package orbits closer to the middle material package orbit require small rocket motor masses for orbital change to the middle material package orbit. The results for scenario #6 are feasible; however, since the material packages and CatSat share the same orbit, the CatSat requires a means to move along the orbit to collect the material packages.
The

position of the CatSat, relative to the orbiting material package stream, can be

manipulated by increasing or decreasing the apogee of the 'catcher' satellite orbit. Lowering the apogee will decrease the orbital period of the satellite; therefore, the satellite's position will advance

From inspection of table 4.15, Scenario # 6 represents the best location for the CatSat This Scenario eliminates the velocity difference because CatSat and material packages share the same orbit, the middle material package orbit However, a small rocket motor mass is required to adjust the orbit the material packages into the middle material package orbit From the results of scenario 6 (Section 4.3,6), the rocket motor mass required for orbital change of the first and last material package at apogee represents 2% and 0.6% of the mass of the orbital insertion rocket motor, respectively. This result is similar to the 1.68% increase in rocket motor mass determined in Section 4.2.3 for the last material package in the 10 minute launch window. Since the difference in rocket motor mass for perigee or apogee orbit changes is less than 3 grams, it would simplify the design of the material package if the orbit change was done at apogee with the orbital insertion rocket motor rather than incorporating a second rocket motor system. The manufacturing process for the orbital insertion rocket could incorporate a means of producing solid rocket motor grains with a slight variation in propellant mass to tailor the rocket motor thrust to insert all material packages into or at least very near the middle material package orbit. As mentioned in 4.4.6, the CatSat for scenario 6 must manipulate its orbit to capture the material packages. A propulsion system capable o f adjusting the orbit is discussed in the design of the CatSat in Section 4.8.

The material package and catcher satellite orbits share the same orbit parameters. parameters are as follows: Apogee Altitude: Perigee Altitude: Orbital Period: 10 000 km 200 km 3.39 hours

The operation of the mass driver system can be summarized as the following three steps (also depicted in Figure 4.24):

133

1. Launch a stream of material packages from a launch mechanism located on Earth' surface. 2. When the material packages reach the apogee of the launch trajectory, a rocket motor fires to insert the material package into the middle material package orbit 3. The material packages are collected by the `catcher' satellite located in the middle material package orbit The following Sections discuss the design of the three remaining sub-systems, the launcher mechanism, material package and catcher satellite. 4.6 Preliminary Design for the Launcher M echanism The preliminary OpenMDS, proposed in Section 3.6.1, utilized railgun technology to accelerate the material packages to high velocities. Railgun technology has been demonstrated to launch small mass to high velocities; however, there has been significant technical difficulties developing suitable energy storage devices and durable launch rails capable of allowing more than one launch from a railgun. Each mass launched from a railgun requires an expendable armature assembly that separates from the launch body after exiting the launcher. Designing armature assemblies capable o f handling high currents loads for high velocity launches has been a significant challenge. Many of direct space launch concepts, mentioned in Section 2.3, recommend the use of railguns but they also state that there are significant technical problems to solve before a practical design is possible. Proposing solutions to the technical problems associated with railguns is beyond the scope o f this project Therefore, the following Sections will not focus on the design of a railgun launcher system, rather the feasibility o f two original launcher concepts will be investigated. Since one of the purposes for the overall design for the mass driver system is to attract potential volunteers to the project, it is thought that a novel concept will draw individuals to read about the project simply from curiosity. Proposing a different concept than the mainstream idea of a railgun may at the very least create discussions why railgun technology is the best solution and should be implemented in the design. However, before the launcher concepts are considered, the first step in designing a^y launch mechanism, for the mass driver system, is to consider where it is to be located. The next Section details the proposed launch site.

134

4.6.1

Proposed Launch Site Location If the orbital insertion rocket motor fails to ignite, the material package will return to Earth

following the reentry trajectory depicted in Figure 4.24. Therefore, the launch site location should locate the impact site for the reentry trajectory in a remote, sparsely populated region. By varying the launch site location in the STK software it was determined that a launch location in central Africa would have an impact site in an unpopulated location in the Pacific Ocean. The selected launch location is depicted in Figure 4.25 below. Launch Site Location Country; Democratic Republic of the Congo Latitude: 0 degrees

Launch Duration: 10 Minute Launch Window 4.6.3 Circular Launch M echanism Concept The first concept for the launcher mechanism is a launcher that is similar to the cyclotron particle accelerators, where a mass is electromagnetically accelerated in a circular path. The concept is equivalent to a coilgun launch tube that is bent to form a circle. Figure 4.26 depicts the circular electromagnetic launch tube.

Figure 4.26: Circular Electromagnetic Launch Tube

The material package travels in the drcular guide track through the centre of the drive coils. The magnetic fields created by the drive coils provide both a propulsive force to accelerate the material package and a force to constrain the material package to a circular path. A section of the guide track contains a very fast acting entrance and exit door mechanism to allow the launch package to enter and the exit the circular launcher. The circular launch mechanism has two potential benefits. Firstly, the physical size o f
th e

circular launch mechanism would be much smaUer than a Hnear coUgun mechanism operating at 136

the same acceleration rate and the design may be simplified. To obtain higher velocities for a linear coilgun, the length of the launch tube must be increased; therefore, the number of drive coils and switching components also increase with length. In contrast, to achieve a higher velocity with a circular electromagnetic launcher, the number of cycles around the circle is increased. The material package could traverse the drcular path a number of times until the desired velodty is reached without requiring additional hardware. Secondly, the switching** requirement for the

circular launcher could potentially be reduced for high material package velodties by simply reducing the number of drive coils operating per revolution. For example if there where 12 drive coils spaced out equally around the circular track, like the hours on a dock, at low package velodties all drive coils can be turned on and off sequentially because the time period between the coils is suffidendy large to permit detection and electronic signaling. At high launch package velodties however, the time duration between each subsequent coil is small. Therefore, to increase the time period the number of drive coils operated could be reduced, such that only drive coils at the 12, 3, 6 and 9Vdock positions would be used. The obvious disadvantages of the drcular launcher is providing the additional force to constrain material package to a circular path and the need of fast acting entrance and exit doors. The first step in the evaluation of the circular launcher concept was to evaluate the magnitude of the restraining force. Two forces where considered for the preliminary analysis, the centripetal force and the magnetic force required to oppose the centripetal force. These forces were calculated as follows. Centripetal Force, F^ (N) [32];

The total mass o f the launch padcage was 1 kg. The diameter of the launch package was 0.0019 m. The length o f the launch package was 0.46 m. The magnetic force acts of half the surface area which is 0.0137 m^ Magnetic saturation o f launch package (rotor) not considered. Maximum magnetic field strength of a super-conduction magnet is 14.7 Tesla'. Maximum magnetic field strength of an electromagnet is 2 Tesla**. Figure 4.27 contains the centripetal force vs. launch velocity data calculated for circular

launcher radii ranging firom 25 m to 1000 m with the Circular_Launcher_Design.xls spreadsheet The curves in Figure 4.27 correspond to the various radii of the circular launcher considered. The lower and upper horizontal lines in Figure 4.27 represent the theoretical

maximum magnetic force that the conventional electromagnetic and super-conducting magnetic drive coil technology is capable of producing, respectively. It is evident, that conventional

electromagnetic technology is only suitable for use with circular launchers with radii greater than 1000 m and launch velocities below 3 km /s since the higher performance values all are located above the lower horizontal line. Super-conducting drive coil technology seenis suitable for a wide range o f radii o f circular launchers and launch velocities, since much of the curves lie below the upper horizontal line in Figure 4.27. Super-conducting technology, maybe capable of

counteracting the centripetal forces, the centripetal forces acting on the material packages are large. For example, for a launcher with a radius of 500 m, the centripetal force acting on a 1 kg material

138

package traveling at 11 km/s (roughly the upper velocity required to launch to a 10 000 km apogee), is 242 000 N or about 27.2 tonnes. The amount of energy consumed to power the superconducting magnets to simply counteract the centripetal force, would likely lead to a very inefficient launcher mechanism. Expending large amounts of energy to confine the material package to a circle during launch probably is not worth the marginal benefits of a smaller launcher and reduced switching requirements gained. The development of this concept will not be further considered.

4.6.4

D istributed Oxidizer Launch Rail Concept S. Molder's Distributed Propellant Launch Rail (DPLR), introduced in Section 2.3.7, is a

unique approach for direct space launcher which utilizes essentially an externally fueled rocket sled. The DLPR offers higher performance than conventional rocket sled operations, such as the Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTI) [43], because DPLR rocket sled does not have to accelerate the propellant mass. However, the distributed propellant launch rail is not suitable for use with the material package stream launcher because the launch rail has to be reloaded with solid propellant between launches. Therefore, the distributed propellant launch rail is not capable of launch frequencies specified in Section 4.6.2. The operation of the DPLR concept, inspired the author to propose a variant of the concept, the distributed oxidizer launch rail (DOLR). Instead of the launch rail containing the solid propellant, the launch rail in the DOLR dispenses an oxidizer gas, such as oxygen (O^) or nitrous oxide (NO 4 ) to the launch sled as it passes over the Section of the rail. A series of fast acting valves would be required to control the oxidizer flow. The launch vehicle operates in a similar manner, except the combustion chamber of the launch vehicle contains a solid propellant grain material such as plastic or rubber. Figure 4.28 depicts a schematic for the distributedoxidizer launch rail concept

The rocket sled is constrained to the rail with a component known as a slipper. The slipper and the collector nose 140

are used to direct oxidizer gas from the rail into the combustion chamber of the rocket sled. To accelerate the rocket sled, the rocket motor for the DOLR concept is proposed to operate similar to a hybrid rocket motor, unlike the rocket motor for the DPLR which operates like a solid rocket motor.

combustion chamber to support further combustion of the fuel grain. The hot combustion gases travel through the fuel grain, creating further combustion and Bnally, the gases exit through the rocket nozzle [39]. Figure 4.30 is a schematic of a hybrid rocket system. The performance of the DOLR will be lower than the DPLR because the DOLR must carry the fuel mass onboard the rocket sled; however, the DOLR should be capable of high launch frequencies. The launch rate would be limited to how quickly the launch sled could be loaded on the rail. The DOLR concept would be safer to operate, since the oxidizer and fuel propellants are separated and the propellants themselves could be stable and easily stored.

141

Figure 4.31 below depicts an overview of the proposed DOLR site, for the OpenMDS. As shown in Figure 4.31, the launch site is to be located on a mountain side where the launch rail is inclined up the side of the mountain at a 40 degree angle (from the horizontal). The launch rail for the site forms a loop to allow the rocket sleds to be reloaded and reused. Figure 4.31 outlines the five major events that occur during launch.

Figure 4.31: Overview of the Proposed Distributed Oxidizer Launch Rail (DOLR) The first event in the launch sequence is depicted in Figure 4.32. The rocket sleds with material packages are transferred from the storage facility to the distributed oxidizer launch rail along loading rails. Multiple loading rails are used to increase the launch frequency of the system. For example, if the loading time of the rocket sled was 1 second, then if only one loading rail was used, the launch frequency would be limited to 1 rocket sled per second. However, given the same loading time of 1 second, a system with four loading rails could launch at a rate of 4 rocket sleds per second. Four loading rails are shown for illustrative purposes, the final design will most likely

142

require more given that the lowest required launch frequency is 453 Hz and a 1 second loading time for the rocket sled simply represents an estimated time.

The second event in the launch sequence is the acceleration of the rocket sled down the launch rail. Figure 4.33 depicts a schematic. The oxidizer gas is stored in large tanks and a network of valves is used to deliver the gas to the specific location of the rocket sled on the rail. I h e potential benefit the DOLR system has over electromagnetic launchers is the simplicity of the launch energy storage. The DOLR system stores the launch energy in the form of oxidizer gas located in conventional chemical storage tanks and the solid fuel stored separately inside the rocket sleds in the storage facility. Whereas, present electromagnetic launch systems and other large electrical power systems require the development of a simple, low cost, efficient energy storage media®. The DOLR system is also well suited to be used for the 10 minute launch window. The supply power for the 10 minute launch window is generated from depleting the supply of stored propellants.
D uring the period when the launcher is not operating, the propellants can be

delivered to replenish the chemical stockpile. Whereas, for electromagnetic launch systems, the

' If this electrical storage technology existed, one of the first applications would likely be buffering the present electrical grid for peak and off-peak electrical demand.

143

supply power for a 10 minute launch must either come from the previously mentioned storage media, or dedicated power generators such as nuclear reactors, or a combination of storage and generators may be used. During the launcher off time, the storage media is recharged from the output of the generators; in a well balanced system these generators would be operating continuously at a 100% capacity. However, storing large amounts of electricity and then quickly delivering it to a load is a technically challenging problem, whereas storing and delivering chemicals is a common practice.

The third event in the launch sequence is the release of the material packages while traveling up the hillside at a 40 degree angle. Figure 4.34 depicts the release event. The material packages travel the launch trajectory specified in Section 4.5. The forth event in the launch sequence is the deceleration of the spent rocket sled. kinetic energy of the rocket sled could be converted into electrical energy that could be sold commercially as a byproduct or used on-site for processes like generating oxidizer gas. T he fifi^

event in the launch sequence is the return of the rocket sleds to the storage facility. Once at this facility, the rocket sleds are reloaded with fuel grains and material

packages. The next Section will detail the preliminary evaluation of the DOLR and the results.

4.6.4.1

Evaluation of DOLR and Results
To investigate the performance of the DOLR concept a spreadsheet,

LauncherSimulator.xls, was programmed to simulate the forces acting on the DOLR rocket sled. The simulation assumed two forces acting on the rocket sled, aerodynamic drag and a constant thrust rocket motor. The aerodynamic drag was based on the diameter of the rocket nozzle outlet and is calculated in a similar manner as previously described in Section 3.4.2.3 and Appendix B, the material package launch spreadsheets. The constant rocket thrust was assumed to be 0.934 MN which is equivalent the Super Road Runner (SRR) solid rocket motor used on the rocket sleds at HHSTT [43]. The specific impulse (319.2 sec), rocket nozzle outlet (0.4 m) and rocket nozzle mass (104.4 k ^ of the SRR motor were used in the simulation. A conservative mixture ratio of 3 parts oxidizer and 1 part fuel mass was assumed for the simulation [39]. Appendix F details the calculation method. Table 4.16a contains the original results for the DOLR rocket sled carrying either a 1 kg or 10 kg material package and operating in the open atmosphere with sea-level air density or in an evacuated launch tube with no air density. To obtain the results in Table 4.16 the fuel mass of the rocket sled was increased until burnout occurred at a distance of 20 km down the track. The 20 145

km track represents an extension of the current HHSTT facility with a track length o f 15.48 km [43]. The results in Table 4.16a indicate that for launch in the atmosphere, the DOLR is capable of launching 1 kg and 10 kg material packages at a maximum velocity of 9.65 and 9.55 km/s, respectively at the end of a 20 km track. If the DOLR rocket sleds operate in an evacuated tunnel, the maximum velocity achieved is 15.04 km/s and 14.57 km/s, for rocket sled launches of the 1 kg and 10 kg material packages, respectively. The fuel mass required by these four cases is similar

ranging &om 247 kg to 300 kg. The launch of a 10 kg material package required about 2% more fuel mass than the launch of a 1 kg material package.

However, as a result o f the response from the open engineering approach, (see Section 5.4 for details), it was identified that this original evaluation o f the DOLR concept excluded the effects o f the oxidizer gas momentum. A modified version of the simulation spreadsheet, 146

LaunchefSimulator_RevA.xls, was created to include accelerating the oxidizer gas to 80% of the velocity of the rocket sled. Accounting for only 80% of the oxidizer momentum was a suggestion from the open engineering approach detailed in Section 5.4. The modified results for the DOLR concept including the effect of oxidizer gas momentum are summarized in table 4.16b.

Including the effect of the oxidizer momentum lowered the maximum velocity obtained by the DOLR. From table 4.16b, operating the DOLR in the atmosphere, the maximum velocity obtained at the end of a 20 km rail is reduced by about 28% to 6.87 and 6.84 km/s for the launch of a 1 kg and 10 kg material package respectively. If the DOLR rocket sleds operate in an evacuated tunnel, the maximum velocity acliieved is reduced by 35% to 9.59 and 9.41 km /s for the launch of a 1 kg and 10 kg material package respectively. The required fuel mass for the modified analysis ranges from 314 kg to 368 kg. The required fuel mass for launching a 10 kg material package is less than a 2% increase over the mass required to launch a 1 kg material package.

147

From Section 4.6.2, the required launch velocity range to place a material package at an altitude of 10 000 km was determined to be 8.82 to 10.92 km/s corresponding to the 100% drag reduction and 0% drag reduction cases respectively. From the results in table 4.16b, the maximum velocity achieved by the DOLR for the 1kg material package ranges firom 6.87 km/s to 9.59 km/s for the sea-level and vacuum launch conditions respectively. Therefore, launching a 1 kg material package with the DOLR concept does not fulfill the complete range of required velocities. Since the DOLR concept cannot achieve the full velocity range requirement for the 1 kg material package mass and the fuel mass increase for launching a 10 kg material package is only 2%, the next step in the analysis was to determine the requirements for launching a 10 kg material package to a 10 000 km altitude. The required launch velocity range for the 10 kg material package is expected to be lower, since Trend 6 o f Section 3.5.2, determined that an increase in the material package mass decreases the upper range of the launch velocity requirement The calculations of Section 4.2.2, were repeated for the launch of a 10 kg material package to a 10 000 km altitude and the results are represented in Figure 4.35. For a 10 kg material

package with the launch conditions specified in Section 4.2.3, the required launch velocity was determined to be from 8.83 km/s to 9.8 km/s assuming 100% drag reduction and 0% drag reduction respectively. The reduction of the velocity range also reduced the energy savings

between the 100% and 0% drag reduction cases to about 18.82%, which is approximately half the energy savings for the 1 kg material package.

Figure 4.35: Requirements for Launch o f a 10 Kg Material Package to 10 000 km Altitude

Figure 4.36 was created to compare the launch velocity requirements to the estimated DOLR launch velocities. Figure 4.36 is a graph of the launch velocity requirements for the 1 kg and 10 kg material packages and the DOLR launch velocity values from tables 4.16a and 4.16b. The blue lines in Figure 4.36 depict the original DOLR performance results and the red lines in Figure 4.36 depict the modified DOLR results. It can be observed in Figure 4.36 that there is a very small velocity difference for launching a 1 kg and 10 kg material packages; in fact, the lines for 1 kg and 10 kg material package velocities overlap in Figure 4.36. The original analysis (blue lines) for the DOLR concept suggested that the DOLR concept could fulfill the velocity requirements for both the 1 kg and 10 kg material packages if the DOLR operated in vacuum conditions. This result is depicted in Figure 4.36, since the two upper blue lines exceed the launch velocity requirements, or the design range, for the 1 kg and 10 kg material packages.

149

PROPERTY OF RYERSON UNIVERSITY LIBRARY

The modified results (red lines) for the DOLR concept, which account for the momentum of the oxidizer gas, are not as favorable as the original DOLR results. The DOLR concept is not capable of fulfilling the launch velocity design range for the 1 kg material package, since no red line in Figure 4.36 exceeds this design range. However, the DOLR concept is nearly capable of

fulfilling the velocity design range for the 10 kg material package if the rocket sled operates in a vacuum. Launching a 10 kg material package in vacuum conditions will be considered as the launcher mechanism for the remainder of the launcher design process. However, operating the rocket sleds in an evacuated launch tunnel probably will not be practical since the rocket sleds generate combustion gases that would degrade vacuum conditions and likely could not be pumped out in a timely manner. Further work on the DOLR concept is needed to prove if the concept will be useful for the final design of the OpenMDS.

The next step in the launcher design process was to consider the layout of the launcher site assuming a DOI^R with a length of 20 km. Two layouts for the launch Section of the DOLR launch rail where considered. Figure 4.37 depicts the launch site located on the surface with a curved Section of track leading up a mountainside and an alternative launch site with a large subterraneous curved Section leading in to an inclined launch Section.

The launcher system selected is the DOLR concept launching 10 kg material packages located on Earth surface. This selection was made primarily because the velocity requirement range of the 10 kg package is close to the modified performance results of the DOLR concept.

Section 4.2.3 concluded a 1 kg material package mass would be usable; however, during the evaluation of the launcher mechanism, in Section 4.6.5, it was decided that a material package mass of 10 kg would be more suitable. The launch analysis of Section 4.2.3 determined the following requirements for the 10 kg material package:

152

Material Package Mass: 10 kg Diameter: 0.0409 m Length: 0.99 m (L/D = 24) Orbital Insertion Rocket Motor Mass: 3.71 kg Orbital Correction Rocket Mass: 0.0833 kg (maximum for last material package) Payload Mass Fraction: 0.63 The following sub-systems bave been identified for the material package along with the associated mass: Payload System: This system consists only of the construction material required for the space project All the analysis done bas assumed a construction mass of solid ste& Mass 6.3 kg Orbital Insertion Rocket Motor: A solid rocket motor is fired, at material package apogee, to place the material package into an elliptical orbit High performance values bave been assumed (Specific impulse of 290s and Propellant Mass Fraction of 0.92). Mass: 3.71 kg Orbital Correction Rocket Motor: An additional rocket impulse is needed to change the position of the material package to the middle material package orbit This rocket impulse counters the orbital `smearing' caused by Earth's rotation d uring the launch widow. The middle material package requires no additional rocket impulse while the required rocket impulse increases with the distance firom the middle material package. Mass: 0.0833 kg Guidance System/Rocket Firing System: A system is required to determine an appropriate time and location to fire the rocker motors. This system might be as simple as a time delay fuse that ignites the rocket motor at a specific time during launch. Alternatively the system could accept a signal firom a satellite that monitors the position and attitude of the material package and issues appropriate instructions to the material package. The design goal for this system should be to reduce the `smarts' that are onboard the material package. Mass: To be determined Attitude Control System: A system might be required to adjust the orientation of the material package prior to firing of the rocket motor. A conventional means for attitude control, is the use of cold gas thrusters; however, ^ven the shape and mass constraints of the material packages it is not certain if this may be an option. Mass: To be determined

153

Stability Control: Fins are assumed to maintain stable flight of the material package during the transit through the atmosphere. Instead of relying on fins, which increase drag and atmospheric heating, spin stabilization might be a possible solution with no mass penalty. Mass: To be determined Thermal Protection System: A system may be required to protect the material package from atmospheric heating and subsequent material ablation. The possible design solutions vary from sacrificing a portion of the payload to utilizing refractory materials. Mass: To be determined Figure 4.39 depicts a schematic for the design of the 10 kg material package. The overall design of the material packages leaves plenty of opportunity for further work to occur by the open engineering development group.

packages would be located in the middle material package orbit and the CatSat would collect the material packages from the middle material package orbit by adjusting the satellites apogee altitude. The following Sections will discuss the requirements for the CatSat, the propulsion system and operation. The overall design of the CatSat leaves plenty of opportunity for further work to occur by the open engineering, development group. 4.8.1 Requirem ents for Capture M echanism

The requirements that follow are based on the 10 kg material package stream specified in Section 4.6.5. Orbit! Elliptical Orbit (Apogee Altitude- 1 0 G O Dkm.

The following table, table 4.17, contains the estimated time to supply construction material to the space construction projects described in Section 2.7. The best and worst cases listed in table 4.17 are from the perspective o f the best case for the launcher design, which is 100% drag reduction and 1000 diameter material package spacing for the best case and 0% drag reduction and 10 diameter spacing for the worst case launcher design. The best case for the launcher is desired because it minimizes the required launch velodty and frequency. From inspection of the table, it is clear that the using the proposed material stream mass driver is not suitable for projects the size of MIR or International Space Stations. It seems the most probable construction project for the best case launcher scenario is the Island One Habitat, with a material supply time o f about 36.5 years for daily launch and collection o f all the material packages of the 10 minute launch window. The Island One Habitat is a 10 000 person habitat, so constructing it in a time period of 36.5 years seems plausible. The supply time period would be reduced if the launch conditions were not ideal. The other two projects have considerably longer supply time needs for the best case launcher scenario and daily launch and collection. The Island One habitat seems to be the most appropriately sized construction project

4.8.2

Manipulating the `Catcher* Satellite Orhital Position
In Section 4.4.7, the CatSat orbit was decided to be the middle material package orbit In

this orbit, the CatSat must be capable of moving around the orbit to collect all the material packages launched during the 10 minute window. Section 4.4.6 proposed manipulating the

position of the CatSat by increasing and decreasing the apogee of the satellite orbit Figure 4.23 depicts this proposal. To change the apogee altitude, a propulsion system for the CatSat is required. Capturing the material packages requires the CatSat to repeatedly use the propulsion system to adjust the apogee altitude; therefore, a propulsion system utilizing a propellant would probably not be practical. Two propellandess propulsion systems where considered for the

catcher satellite, a solar sail and an electrodynamic tether. The solar sail concept utilizes a lightweight, reflective sail material to harness the momentum of photons from the sun to propel the sail through space. The obvious advantage of a solar sail propulsion system is, it requires no onboard propellant or energy systems. However, from a literature search, it was discovered that atmospheric drag limits use of static solar sails to Earth altitudes above 1000 km [44]. Paul Fieseler proposed a solar sail design with either ramps (like a diffraction grating or moveable slats which extend the operation range of solar sails to about 350 km altitude. The ramp or slat solar sail design reduces the atmospheric drag on the sail by reducing the cross-Section exposed to the atmosphere [44]. Since perigee of the `catcher' satellite orbit is 200 km, which is lower than the 350 km limit for the proposed solar sail design, solar sail technology is not useable for the design of the `catcher' satellite. It also remains to be investigated if, solar sails could maneuver the `catcheri satellite quickly enough to capture die material package stream in the one day and one week capture periods proposed. Additionally, implementing a solar sail propulsion system might not be possible because the solar sail would likely be damaged by material packages that are not collected during capture events. Finally, solar sail propulsion has yet to be demonstrated in space; significant design challenges exist for creating solar sail space structures that are lightweight and durable. The idea of using solar sail propulsion technology for the `catcheri satellite was abandon to investigate the suitability of another propellandess propulsion system, the electrodynamic tether propulsion system.

157

An electrodynamic tether system uses a long conductive wire to interact with the Earth's magnetic field to create small propulsive forces distributed over the length of the wire. Unlike solar sail propulsion that functions poorly at low attitude, the electrodynamic tether system's function improves as the attitude lowers. This occurs because the strength of the magnetic field of Earth increases as the altitude is reduced [45]. To reduce the apogee altitude of the CatSat, the elcctrodynamic tether generates a drag force and electrical current at perigee. The electrodynamic tether system operates on principle of induction where a conductor passed through a magnetic field generates a force that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the conductor motion and a current flow in the conductor [42]. The orbital energy of the `catcher' satellite is transformed into electrical current that can be used for the operation of the `catcher' satellite or stored for reboost of the CatSat. To reboost the apogee o f the `catcher' satellite, an electrical current must be applied to the electrodynamic tether at perigee in an opposite direction to the induced current Therefore, to use an electrodynamic tether propulsion system for the CatSat, the satellite requires a system o f storing and generating electrical current for the lowering and boosting of the apogee. Electrodynamic technology requires a significant amount of development before a Presently the Tethers Unlimited" firm is pioneering

practical system can be created.

electrodynamic technology for deorbiting of satellites and propulsion for small satellites. Electrodynamic tether technology would seem to be an appropriate propulsion system; however, a preliminary design for the electrodynamic tether system remains to be completed.

4.8.3

Capture Concepts for `Catcher* Satellite
Section 2.6 discussed previous proposed capture concepts. The NASA concepts of

Section 2.6.1 are the most applicable to the design of the CatSat; however, none of the concepts are suitable for collecting the quantity of material packages launched. These concepts inspired proposing three other possible capture concepts as a means to better suit the needs o f collecting a large quantity o f orbiting material packages.

" Tethers Unlimited Inc. - www.tethers.com

158

The first capture concept proposed is the inverse of an electromagnetic launcher, the electromagnetic decelerator. Figure 4.40 depicts a schematic for the electromagnetic electromagnetic decelerator. decelerator The catcher

Figure 4.40. Electromagnetic Decelerator Capture Concept [23]

mechanism is a coil gun operating in reverse [46]. A series of coils are stacked to create a deceleration tube. The trajectory of the material package must intersect the center of the deceleration mbe. The coils are sequentially energised creating a magnetic that retards the motion of the pellet. The kinetic energy of the pellet is converted into electrical current and heat. This concept has the benefit that the velocity difference between the material package could be converted into electrical energy. However, this concept requires precise alignment

between the material package and CatSat and the material package must either be constructed of a conductive material or carry an electromagnet to interact with the coils of the decelerator. In the case where the material package is a conductive material, the current generated by the deceleration will be induced in the material package and cause heating of the material package. This concept was originally proposed for a CatSat in GEO-SYNC where the velocity difference at capture was high. Since the velocity difference for the selected CatSat orbit is very low, the potential energy production from the electromagnetic decelerator would be low. The benefits of this concept seem marginal compared to the complexity of the system; therefore, this concept was abandon, to investigate a second concept. The second concept proposed, a rotating drum, is a passive capture mechanism similar to the flat disk of crushable material proposed by NASA in Section 2.6.1.1. Figure 4.41 depicts the rotating drum capture concept. For this concept, the CatSat is a large drum of crushable material that rotates about its central axis. During the capture event, the drum positions itself such that the trajectory of the material packages in orbit pass through the drum. The thickness of the sidewall of the drum would be sufficient to allow the pellet to penetrate through the drum only once. The material packages are captured in the interior of the drum, where they maybe collected by a

159

plunger or netting that travels along the interior of the cylinder for additional processing. The process is similar to shooting BB's into a pop can.
^

The advantage o f the drum concept is the simplicity o f operation. The position o f the material packages and the catcher satellite are less critical and the size of the drum can compensate for positional error. The drum however would require regular service, since the capture event destroys the material of the drum. Building this rotating drum would require a significant supply of material. This Figure 4.41: Rotating Drum Capture Concept

system might be plausible; however, since it based on the destruction of the drum mî^terinl it probably unlikely that the drum could survive the multiple impacts firom even one ten minute launch cycle, given that at the very least there are 126 600 material packages in orbit per 10 minute launch. The final concept proposed for the `catcher* satellite is a design is similar to a Ferris wheel; Figure 4.42 depicts this Ferris wheel concept The arms of the Ferris wheel are replaced by cables. The cables can be adjusted to adjust for positional error of the material package. The 'seats' of the Ferris wheel are replaced by a grapple mechanism, similar to the grapple mechanisms of Section 2.6.2 and 2.6.3, capable o f quickly securing the material packages. The cable arms of the 'catcher' satellite rotate allowing the grapple mechanism to pickup a series of material packages. Once the material package is secured, the cable reels in the material package to the processing center. This concept requires greater positional accuracy than the rotating drum, but less accuracy than the electromagnetic decelerator. Figure 4.42 depicts the electrodynamic tether system for this capture concept

Chapter 5 - Open Engineering Organization, Tools, Attempts And Results
5.1 Open Engineering Organization
It is assumed that Open Engineering (OE) project organization should share most of the organizational characteristics of open source software (OSS) project OSS projects require a

founder to initiate the project For this Open Engineering project, the author has assumed the role of founder of the project Like an OSS project, the founding person or group for an OE project should have the following tasks to perform; 1. State the requirements for the `engineered' hardware product and provide a prototype system. 2. Divide the hardware product into work/design modules. 3. Present and promote the project on the Internet 4. Select the `best' efforts (evaluation/design) of the design community for compilation into a functional design of the hardware product The requirements for task 1 have been fultiUed and are described in Chapter 3 and 4. The tools used to fulfill task 1 are described in Section 5.2. The requirements of task 2, defining work modules, has not been entirely fulfilled at the time of writing; however, the first level of the division of the work modules for the mass driver project is depicted in Figure 4.1, as the five sub systems o f the mass driver design. The fulfillment of task 3, promotion of the product, is detailed in Section 5.3. Task 4 requires the participation of a developer community; Section 5.4 will describe the results of the development community. To promote courtesy and fairness among the development community the author adopted and improved the list of rules followed by the OSCar project''. The rules for the Mass Driver Project are as follows: o o o Knowledge and material obtained firom the project and contributed to the project is firee. Everyone has an equal voice, If you have an idea, share it

If this project may interest somebody you know, please tell them. The developer community for an OE project is responsible for a set of tasks that are

similar to OSS developers. The tasks for OE developers are as follows: 1. Suggest and evaluate possible design solutions to work/design modules and select appropriate design parameters. 2. Create documents explaining assumptions, design decisions and systems design. 3. Create design specifications and technical/user manuals for hardware product 4. Review the design work of others for errors in the design process of the hardware product 5. Report errors in the hardware product to the design community. 6. Suggest new design solutions for reported errors. The results o f the developer community will be discussed in Section 5.4. 5.2 Open Engineering Tools The fundamental tool for any OSS or OE project is a tool that will allow developers of the project to collaborate on the project As mentioned in Section 1.2, OSS projects utilize the internet to collaborate on the software projects. Establishing an OSS project is relatively easy, since an internet host site, Sourceforge.net, exists and provides the collaboration tools and storage space to support OSS projects. This site, at the time of writing, hosts over 100 000 projects with over 1 million people registered as participates to these projects. The SourceForge.net web host could not be used to support the development o f the mass driver project since the SourcePorge web site restricts hosted projects only to OSS projects [47]. Section 5.2.2 describes the host site and collaboration tools utilized by the Mass Driver Project Developing an OSS project is relatively straight forward, since once the programming language for the project is defined all developers can use various editors to write programming 164

code and submit the code for compilation. Managing the information related to an OSS project is relatively simple; it is either programming code or text documents supporting the program. Managing the information regarding the design of a hardware product is a little more complicated than OSS projects, since the design information can exist in many forms such as CAD models, CAM programs, simulation/analysis models and data, spread sheets and text documents. To further complicate matters each type of information may have its own file type and many of the file types require commercial software to read and modify information and are not compatible with other software packages. To permit the greatest number of people to participate in an OE project, it was identified that software tools used by the project should be either products that are open source and freely available or at least a common tool that most computer users would have access to. Section 5.21 describes the software tools used to develop the prototype design for the OpenMDS previously described in Chapters 3 and 4.

5.2.1

Software Products
OSS tools for engineering design are virtually non-existent at this time. The software tools

that do exist at this time rnainly support the design of computer related hardware such as circuit layout and testing. Consequently, the design of the `prototype' OpenMDS describe in Chapter 3 and 4 were performed with commonly available software.

5.2.1.1

Microsoft Excel and Open Office Calc
The software tool that was used the most was Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet product As

previously mentioned in Chapter 3 and 4, most of the evaluation of the launch trajectory was performed by creating Excel spreadsheets. This software tool was chosen since the author is more
fam iliar

with programming spreadsheets than other programming languages and the Excel

program represents a program that is commonly installed on most home computers. There is an OSS alternative that is compatible with Excel program (and other Microsoft Office programs) known as Open Office-Calc". The advanced commands for the Calc program differ somewhat from some Excel commands, so when the Excel simulation spreadsheets were imported to Calc errors occurred. It is likely that learning the appropriate Calc commands and modifying the spreadsheet could correct these errors. However, since the priority was to evaluate and propose a

165

prototype design for the mass driver, implementing the Calc program into the project was not completed. 5.2.1.2 AGI Satellite Toolkit (STK) Freeware As mentioned in Section 4.4, evaluating the appropriate location of the CatSat was first attempted with an Excel spreadsheet; however, this method proved to be cumbersome. An

internet search identified AGI's Satellite Toolkit (STK)* core program as a freeware software tool that would simplified the evaluation of the `catcher' satellite orbit. The core STK program is capable of calculating and displaying the time-dependent motion of multiple

satellites and other space related objects on a 2D map or outputting tables of calculated data. Figure 5.1 depicts an example of a satellite's trajectory superimposed over a 2 dimensional map of Earth. A copy of the program can be obtained for no charge by requesting it from AGI; therefore, this core program is compatible with the Open Engineering initiative. As mentioned in Section 4.4, the analysis and figures for the CatSat utilized a 3D visualization module for STK that was used under a 7 day evaluation license. The 3D visualization tool tnade evaluating the rendezvous or capture event of the satellite and material packages much easier since the position and velocity data can be viewed directly on screen when the satellite approaches the material packages. An open source module capable of 3D visualizations of the satellite and material package orbits would be very beneficial to the continued development of the mass driver project. An additional module that would be beneficial for continuing the development of the mass driver project would be a module to simulate the motion of a satellite with alternative propulsion

systems like electrodynamic tethers and solar sails.

As mentioned in Section 4.8.2, further

investigation for using electrodynamic tether propulsion to maneuver the CatSat for the collection of orbiting material package stream needs to be completed. A search was made for a software tool capable of simulating electrodynamic tethers; the only program identified was a commercial product, TetherSW, marketed by Tethers Unlimited.

5.2.1.3

Computer Aided Design (CAD) Software
Open Cascade* is an open source CAD package that is fireely available and downloadable.

It is capable of 3D modeling of surfaces and solids. The Open Cascade program was not used for the development of the prototype mass driver design since the version of the program available in 2004 was not compatible with Windows XP operating systems". Instead of using Open Cascade, the AutoCAD and SolidWorks2004 CAD packages available at Ryerson Computing labs were used. In addition to being available at the university, AutoCAD and SolidWorks were convenient for the author to use, since the author is very with both programs from previous work experiences.
fam iliar

The future development of the Mass

Driver project and other OE projects will require developers to collaborate CAD information. Since the OSCar project utilized the Open Cascade program for vehicle design, it is likely the program will be suitable also for the design for the OpenMDS components. The program seems to be well documented and a large user manual exists; therefore, learning the program should not be too challenging or laborious for most potential developers.

5.2.2

Collaboration Tools
Since a preexisting host site for open engineering projects did not exist when this project

commenced in September 2003, APD Ltd. provided a web server and the domain name
www.mnsRdrivcr.com to provide an internet home for the mass driver project The web space for

the mass driver project, of course had to be more than static web pages, the web site must provide a secure space to store and present information pertaining to the project as well as provide tools to

aid communication and collaboration between participants to the project.

At the time of

commencement of the mass driver project, the best suited software package for providing support to an open engineering project was PhProjekt^^, which itself is an OSS product APD Ltd. staff installed and maintains the PhProjekt program on the web server. Figure 5.2 depicts the main page of the PhProjekt program implemented on the www.massdriver.com web site.

Figure 5.3: Folder Structure for File Section of PhProjekt Collaboradon Web Page These folders contain 126 files totaling, totaling about 42 Mb of space. The files are all information that was generated at every stage of the design process for the prototype OpenMDS described in Chapter 3 and 4. All these files are available for download and modification by any member of the project. Visitors to the web site www.massdriver.com, may view these files by using Login: guest and Password: guest The final feature that was important to the mass driver project was the Wild tab. The Wild feature is an environment allowing participants to create and modify static web pages relatively easily using only their internet browser and knowledge of a few simple formatting rules. The Wiki pages can be used to form a "living document", a centralized document that is easily viewable and modifiable by all participants and defines the state of the project or sub component of the project at that time. Much of this project's information is organized as a series of linked Wild pages that form a living' document; these Wiki pages describes the current state of the design of the mass driver project and can be updated at any time by any member of the project. The purpose of using 169

the Wiki environment was to ensure that all participants could quickly and easily view the current state o f the design. The only serious drawback of utilizing the PhProjekt software is, participants must logjn in with a user name and password to gain access to the project information. The login security measure protects the project information firom malicious attack by non-interested parties; however, it prevents search engines and the general public from finding and viewing the project information. Therefore, the PhProjekt program hinders the `openness' of the project. To ensure that the search engines and the general public can view information related to the project, static public web pages were created to advertise the project and summarize the current design of the mass driver system. The following Section details the attempts at advertising the project to potential participants. 5.3 O pen Engineering Attempts To attract people to the mass driver project, it is necessary to make the existence of the project known. The vast amount of space related material on the internet is a testament to the enthusiasm that exists for space applications. The following Sections describe the attempts and events made to promote the project, both in person and virtually on the internet, to potential participants. The results o f these attempts are discussed in Section 5.4. 5.3.1 Public Web Site As mentioned in 5.2.2, the PhProjekt does not allow search engines and the general public to view the information stored in PhProjekt Obviously, having search engines locate the site is important since people searching the internet for an `open source mass driver project* can locate the site. To allow search engines to find the site, a series of public web pages were created to describe the project and the present state of the OpenMDS design. APD Ltd staff provided the author with the template for creating the web pages.

Starting in May 2004, the author submitted the www.massdriver.com URL directly to the Google search engine. Google did not locate the web site until about May 2005. This delay in locating the site might be related to the small size of the public website prior to updating the site with the summary o f the mass diiver design detailed in Chapter 4. Additionally, by May 2005, Dr. 171

F. A. Salustti's homepage and a few other internet sites had links to the project pages. These links improve the change o f Google finding the web pages.

Public Events
The mass driver project was promoted publicly at a number of different venues. The The results of these promotional

following paragraph describes the promotional attempts. attempts are described in Section 5.4.1.

The first efforts at promoting the project were two separate workshops hosted at APD Ltd. These workshops were intended as kick-off meetings to get people local to the Toronto area interested in the project The work shops were similar to the public kick-off meeting Markus Merz of the OSCar project described in Section 2.2.1, hosted to attract developers to his project The first workshop was held in December 2003. At this time, very few details of the OpenMDS design were known; the general concept of launching a series of material packages one after another as a better method of transporting a large amount of material to space could be presented. APD Ltd and Prof. P. A. Salustd extended an invitation to clients and colleagues whom would be interested in space applications to attend the workshop. The second workshop was held near the end of April 2004 when the results for launching to GEO-SYNC without atmospheric drag were known (Section 3.5.1 mathematical model results). Similarly, APD Ltd. and Prof. F. A. Salustri extended an invitation to potentially interested parties. The next public event, an Open Source Software conference hosted at the University of Toronto, occurred in May 2004. At this conference, a poster describing the goals of the project, the overall mass driver concept and the results at the time, which was the launch to GEO-SYNC without atmospheric drag, were displayed. The attendees were mostly people of the computer science background firom all regions o f Canada. Following the open source conference, the next public event was the Materials and Manufacturing Ontario (MMO) Partnerships annual conference, held in Mississauga in June 2004. The purpose of the conference is to showcase the innovation available in Ontario. At tliis venue, a

172

booth with a poster similar to the poster for the open source conference was setup. conference was attended by a mix o f academic and industrial individuals firom Ontario.

The

The final public event where the mass driver project was promoted was the International Astronautical Congress conference in Vancouver in October 2004. The author wrote a paper entitled `TA.C-04-U.1.07 - Design of a mass driver system concept using open source principles", which summarized the objectives, concept and present state of the mass driver project [48]. This paper summarized the design results of Chapter three of this manuscript Prof. F. A. Salustri presented the paper at the conference in Vancouver. The conference was attended by academic and aerospace industry individuals firom around the world.

5.3.3

Internet Postings
This Section summarizes the important internet postings that were issued to promote the

project An internet search was performed to target an audience that was more likely to be interested in space applications, like direct Earth launch systems. The Space Studies Institute" (SSI) newsgroup was identified as a potential audience for the mass driver project SSI was established at Princeton University by Dr. Gerard O'Neill as a non profit education and research organization to study technologies to permit humanity to benefit firom space technology. As previously mentioned, in Section 1.4, Dr. O'Neill researched the mass driver, an electromagnetic launcher operating on the Moon [49]. Given that the SSI studied mass driver technology, the SSI newsgroup, with its 400 members, was a logical audience to advertise for project participants or at the very least constructive advice. Two postings were made to advertise the project The first posting was posted on Alarch 16 2004, which was before

preliminary OpenMDS design described in Chapter 3 was complete. At the time of posting, only the results from the gravity only launch to GEO-SYNC were known. The message posted introduced the newsgroup to the application of open source development principles to the design o f space launch hardware. The message invited tlie readers to login to the www.massdriver.com site and review launch concept and present state of the mass driver system design. A copy of the

" Space Studies Institute web site --www.ssi.orp

message can be viewed in Appendix G and a summary of the response firom the SSI newsgroup is detailed in Section 5.4.2. A second message was posted to the SSI newsgroup, in May 2005, informing the newsgroup o f the preliminary design of the mass driver project and the DOLR launcher concept The message briefly described the material package stream launch concept and directed the readers to view the public pages which detail the present design of the OpenMDS. The readers were introduced to the DOLR concept and invited to view further details on the public web pages. Readers were asked to review the design work and provide comments. A copy of the message can be viewed in Appendix G and a summary of the response firom the SSI newsgroup is detailed in Section 5.4.2. To target an audience with the technical knowledge needed to evaluate the hypersonic slip stream effects, two web sites providing firee technical advice were identified. The Mad Scientist Network*'*' and Eng-Tips" Forum. The Mad Scientist Network is a web site hosted by the University of Washington that accepts science questions and directs the question to the appropriate panel of over 900 volunteer scientist and engineers for an answer [50]. The author posted a question in May 2004 to the Mad Scientist Network which simply asked,
`Js there a significant l^ e rso n ic sUp-stream efiect?".

The question

included a brief description of the mass driver project and the material package stream. The entire message to the Mad Scientist Network can be viewed in Appendix G and the response firom the Mad Scientist Network is detailed in Section 5.4.2. The Eng-Tips Forum's purpose is to host dialogues between engineering professionals for work-related topics. The site hosts a number of forums organized by engineering discipline and then by topic. Two messages were posted to the Eng-Tips forum. The first message was posted in May 2004, and asked participants in the Aeronautic Engineering discipline if there would be a significant aerodynamic benefit to launching a stream of small launch bodies firom Earth surface to orbit rather than a single large launch body.

The second message was posted to Eng-Tips in May 2005. The message introduced participants of the Spacecraft Engineering forum (Aerospace Engineering discipline) to the DOLR concept The message pointed readers to the public web pages on the www.massdriver.com website for additional information and asked readers to provide feedback on the DOLR concept A copy of the messages posted on the Eng-Tips forums can be viewed in Appendix G and a summary of the responses firom the Eng-Tips participants is detailed in Section 5.4.2.

Open Engineering Results
One of the research goals for this project was to document and observe how the design

process of a complicated system occurs without the hindrance of traditional organizational structures, deadlines and financial constraints. Obviously, to fulfill this research goal, a developer group was needed to study. At the commencement of the project it was assumed that given the vast amount of internet users, there will be at least a few people interested in designing a material package stream mass driver. The difficulty of establishing a developer group was underestimated. Up until the design results of Chapter 4 were made public, the mass driver project did not attract any developers to the project After the design results of Chapter 4 were made public, the mass driver project had seven people express an interest in joining the project The interest and the response to the project tend to correlate with the state of the prototype OpenMDS design. At the beginning of the project the response firom people was minimal likely because only a concept of the operation of the system was available. Whereas recently, people have expressed an interest in joining the project because presumably, the proposed prototype OpenMDS interests them. The following Sections summarize the responses the project received firom the promotion attempts mentioned in Section 5.3.

5.4.1

Results from Public Events
The first work shop held at APD Ltd. unfortunately coincided with the busy holiday

season, so only a few people attended the workshop. The attendees were interested in the concept and there was a good general discuss about the concept; the problem of material package `pile up' during initialization of the material package stream was discussed.

' Eng-Ups Forum web site - 3

175

The second workshop held at APD Ltd. attracted approximately 30 people whom mosdy were engineers from the Concord and Markham area. The attendees asked a few questions about the operation of the concept but were somewhat skeptical if the concept would be possible. The feedback from the attendees made it clear that a preliminary design of the mass driver system was need to quantify the requirements of the design and ideally prove the physical feasibility of the proposed material stream mass driver concept This preliminary design is thought to be the key to establishing a developer group. The poster presentation at the Open Source Software conference attracted a couple of discussions about the project However, the attendees were mainly of the computer science background; therefore, an open engineering project involving aerospace technology development probably was not of much interest to most attendees. The booth and poster at the MMO Partnership similarly attracted a few discussions about the general concept of the project but failed to attract any developers for the project This experience further indicated that the mass driver system design needed more work to make the project more enticing to potential developers. Dr. F. A. Salustri presented the paper describing the project at the lAC conference. The response was similar to the previously mentioned conferences. The design presented was the preliminary o f the OpenMDS described at the end of Chapter 3. It was stressed that this was not the final finding o f the project, merely the state of the design at the time. As mentioned in Chapter 3, this design had challenging design requirements that are not practical for a near term application; it is likely the response to the paper was poor because the design did not seem practical.

Results from Internet Postings
It is common for people partidpating in virtual ^tem et) communities to protect there

true identity by using usernames, since identity protection reduces the risk o f personal information o f the person to be stolen by individuals with malidous intent. However, over time, members of internet communities, such as open source development groups, tend to interact with each other and establish a certain amount of trust and friendship amongst each other. 176 Overtime, the

anonymity of members of an internet community subsides and members of the internet community trust each other and know the true identity of the person behind the user name. Since this project is just beginning to establish an internet based development community, the identity of the people providing feedback to the project is limited to user names; the person providing the feedback is essentially anonymous and the credibility of the information provided is questionable. However, it is likely that overtime, if these people became actively involved with the project, the true identity of the person would be known and the credibility of the information could be verified. The following paragraphs summarize the responses received firom the users in response to the message postings previously described in section 5.4.1. The first posting on the SSI newsgroup in March 2004 received four responses. The first

user, TangoMan, made a few technical suggestions. Firstly he suggested if the purpose of the system was to supply construction material to space projects, then the design of the proposed device would be much simpler if it was located on the Moon instead of Earth. If the proposed system operates firom Earth surface, then there is the potential for the material package stream to destroy the satellites that presently occupy LEO. Rdocating the `catcher' satellite to LEO would lower the risk to existing spacecraft. Finally, this user indicated that kinetic energy difference between the material packages and the `catcher* satellite would require a station keeping system. The second user, Xenophile, also responded with technical suggestions. He suggested that possibly the material packages could be made of ice, or encased in ice as a thermal protection system. To reduce the velocity difference between the satellite and the material packages at capture, Xenophile suggested a rotating tether might be of use. The third user, Mitchell James, responded with his experiences with collaborative en^eerin g and open source projects. He provided a link to his web page for collaborative engineering projects^^. From his experiences, he believes tliat all open source projects are required to provide the participating developer/users something useful In the case of software, it is a software product Successful projects, offer the developer/user something that is immediately useful to the developer/user, this encourages the developer/user to continue to improve the

product According to Mitchell James, the mass driver project does not fulfill any of the above criteria; therefore, the project is unlikely to attract a developer/user group. He su^ests that this is an issue for many open source engineering projects, how do you attract developers to a project that takes many years to complete? The fourth user to respond to the first posting was RyanZ. This user also commented on the open source aspect of the project The user was contemplating observing the design process in an open source project as his Master's degree thesis; however, he did not find a suitable project to observe. RyanZ agreed with Mitchell James statements. RaynZ stated that you cannot assume the ideology, "if you build it they will come". From his observations of open source, it seems that a project is more likely to be successful if it slightly extends the knowledge base rather than malting a leap in knowledge. The author responded to the responses by thanking them for the feedback. It was

discouraging at this point that the project was not gathering any developers; however, this simply emphasized that a preliminary OpenMDS design was need to demonstrate the potential benefits of the mass driver system and attract people to the project Therefore, at the time of the second posting on the SSI newsgroup a substantial amount of design work was completed and presented to the SSI newsgroup. The second posting received a response from five SSI users. The first user, Kent Ogletree, responded with a brief technical su^estion. This user suggested that the concept could be improved by incorporating Mag-Lev technology to suspend the rocket sled over the rail. The second user, Frank, praised the graphics and presentation of the public web pages. He was interested in obtaining the open source software used for the evaluation and design of the mass driver project He provided a link to his ring spacecraft® that might be an idea for a `catcher' satellite concept I responded to Frank, indicating very little open source software exists for engineering design; therefore, much of the analysis was done by programming Excel spreadsheets. The ring spacecraft is like the name indicates a ring with netting stretched across the interior. The

K Ring spacecraft ww.solar-thnistcr-saüor.inFo/figs/fig9.html

178

spacecraft utilizes ion thruster for propulsion. I indicated to Frank that the project needs people to develop the `catcher' satellite design and his concept might be a suitable design, particularly if he would like to participate in the project The third response came from Xenophile, a user that responded to the first SSI posting. He indicated he would be very interested in obtaining the spreadsheets created. The author directed Xenophile to log into the www.massdriver.com site and download the spreadsheet files and supporting documents from the files Section. The fourth response came as an e-mail from Giorgio Gaviraghi, an industrial designer in Italy and the president of the Mars Society Italy. Mr. Gaviraghi expressed an interest in joining the Mass Driver project to help design the space construction project He has previously proposed a design for modular habitat, named AstroHab which could be used for a lunar base. He was interested in modifying the AstroHab design for use for the mass driver project The author had a lengthy discussion with Mr. Gaviraghi via e-mail exchanges and we identified that to make his modular concept feasible, the size of the material packages must be at least 100 kg. Since the project lacked a development group at this time, we agreed that the author would contact Mr. Gaviraghi when the mass driver project has a development group ready to consider the space construction mission details. The fifth and final response to the second SSI posting was an e-mail from Mr. Kumar Bharath, an aeronautics graduate located in India. Mr. Bharath expressed an interest in joining the project but he wanted to review more information related to the project and he wanted to know the size of the present developer community. Mr. Bharath did not reply to a follow up e-mail sent by the author, it is assumed that he was not interested in the project at this time. Comparing the responses from the first and second SSI postings, it seems there is a correlation between the prototype design and the response from the audience. At the time of the first posting, there was not much more than the concept of the mass driver system and consequently nobody was willing to become a developer for the project At the time of the second posting, the prototype mass driver design detailed in Chapter 4 was available for review; therefore, more details about the mass driver system were known and two people expressed an interest in 179

joining the project It is expect that this trend would continue, the more detailed the prototype design becomes the more people will be attracted to the project The following paragraphs discuss the results of the technical questions posted on the Mad Scientist and Eng-Tips forums. The question regarding hypersonic slip-stream effect was sent to the Mad Scientist Network in May 2004. At this time the author was having a difficult time locating any previous work on slip-stream effects for hypersonic flows. A physicist for the Mad Scientist Network, John Link responded to the question in September 2004. Mr. Link indicated that many of the scientists of the Mad Scientist network declined to answer the question because it is difficult and complicated subject of ballistics and it is beyond the usual scope of questions on the Mad Scientist network. Mr. Link also did not have an answer to the question; however, he suggested a possible means of estimating the effect Mr. Link suggested I find information

regarding the aerodynamics effects about shotgun shot in the initial stages of the ballistic trajectory either from shell manufactures or traditional journals. The information could be used to program a spreadsheet to calculate die trajectory of inline BB shots. Mr. Link provided a link to a

spreadsheet he create to simulate the trajectory of a single BB firom a shotgun shot and suggested this could be the starting point for my analysis. Mr. Link indicated the spreadsheet is a simplified version o f the calculation method that aerospace scientists use to calculate the ballistics of rockets, missiles and other spacecraft These accurate computer models require computation power beyond that of a personal computer; an Excel spreadsheet provides a convenient means of performing these calculations on a personal computer. By the time the response from Mr. Link was received, the author independently located the hypersonic interference drag information previously detailed in Section 4.2.4. Therefore,

research into ballistics of shotgun shells was only briefly investigated but no significant information was identified. The link Mr. Link provided to his spreadsheet calculation was reviewed. Mr. Link's spreadsheet operated in a similar manner to the spreadsheets created by the author; therefore, the evaluations performed in Chapters 3 and 4 are similar to those used by aerospace scientists. The first posting on the EngTips forum regarding the benefits o f launching a series of in line bodies slip-streaming each other to space received one response. The user IRstuff responded 180

suggesting that for any slip-stream drag reduction to occur, the bodies would almost be in contact with each other. If these bodies were traveling one behind another then creating a guidance control system to maintain the position would be challenging. Finally vortex shedding and other disturbances firom the leading bodies might cause significant problems to the trailing bodies. Since, the responses to this question was limited to one, it is assumed that the users on the EngTips forum do not have experience with hypersonic slip-stream effects. The comment firom this user suggests there are many aerodynamic issues that occur around the launch bodies that must be evaluated. The second posting on the EngTips forum was posted in May 2005 and asked users to provide comments regarding the DOLR concept Four users provided a response to this posting. The first response came firom the same user as the first posting, IRstuff. The user pointed out that aerodynamic heating of the oxidizer gas at high velocities could cause pre-ignition of the fuel on the rocket sled and uncontrolled combustion would occur. The second user, Greg Locock, suggested that shock wave effects created by the rocket sled would cause problems with combustion. He also suggests that the initial performance of this concept would be better than a conventional rocket sled but at high velocities there would be little difference between this concept and a traditional rocket sled. This user suggested that the better way to get to orbit is to fly the payload to high altitude and use a rotating tether to pick the payload up and place it in orbit The third user, btrueblood, suggested the concept is similar to a RAM jet or the RAM tube accelerator (Section 2.5.13) of Washington University. The user had first hand experience with the RAM tube because he worked on the concept as a graduate student This user indicated that the statement made by the user Greg Locock, was not completely correct The performance of a RAM jet is better than a rocket because it accelerates the oxidizer only to about 80 to 90% of the velocity of the RAM jet, whereas a rocket accelerates the oxidizer to 100% of the velocity o f the rocket Therefore, the concept could perform better than a conventional rocket sled. The user also suggested that the fuel for the proposed hybrid rocket motor could be made firom recycled tires.

181

The final user, nhughesl, commented that the mechanics of the system is similar to a space launch concept he evaluated for development The concept involved accelerating a launch body down a rail until it reached a velocity of about Mach 1. At this point, the launch body would ignite a RAM jet and fly to 55 km altimde. At this altitude, a rocket propulsion system places the body in orbit The user indicated that the proposed DOLR combustion method is similar to a RAM jet, so theoretically the operation of the DOLR should be possible. The author posted a response thanking the users for the feedback. These responses received from the EngTips fomm were very helpful. The idea of using old tires as a fuel for the rocket sleds could make the launch system economically viable since the energy source, used tires, is relatively cheap, abundant and presently an environmental problem. The author did not

consider the DOLR concept as being similar to a RAM jet on a rail until the responses to the idea were posted. The revelation that this concept was similar to a RAM jet immediately identified to the author that there was a problem with the evaluation of the DOLR concept of Section 4.6.4.1. The author did not consider the momentum of the oxidizer gas in the initial analysis. The results o f the modified DOLR analysis, including momentum, were presented previously in Section 4.6.4.I. During the writing of this document (June 2005), the author was contacted via e-mail by a Mr. Joed van Zuilen, a graduate of civil engineering at Delft University in the Netherlands. Mr. Zuilen found the site as a result o f a Google search. Coincidentally, he was interested in setting up an open source mass driver project and was researching if a similar project exists. He has four other friends whom are graduates from Delft University in aerospace engineering and physics disciplines that are interested in starting an open source mass driver project Mr. Zuilen indicated they are considering the design of a mass driver capable of launching satellite payloads, since this would be o f greater near term and economic purpose. Mr. Zuilen and his associates were

interested in starting a project in the fall of 2005 and would create a web site to host their project Mr. Zulien and the author agreed to remain in contact regarding future developments o f cither of the open source projects.

Chapter 6 - Conclusion and Recommendations
6.1 Open Mass Driver System Design
Thus far, the evaluation and design process for the OpenMDS has not identified any `show stopper* physical effects that suggest the design of the OpenMDS would be impossible. Since directly investigating the aerodynamic flow effects occurring around the material package stream was determined by Dr. FA. Salustri and Dr. J. Lassoline to be beyond the scope of this project, the evaluation of the OpenMDS system determined the range of performance requirements for the OpenMDS based on assuming best and worst case scenarios and a range of material package separation (spacing) distances. The best case scenario corresponds to the ideal situation where aerodynamic effects of material package stream creating an evacuated tunnel (100% drag reduction) through the atmosphere. The worst case scenario corresponds to

aerodynamic effects of the material package stream that results in no change in atmospheric properties (0% drag reduction). The conditions for worst scenario case are no different than launching a single material package through the atmosphere; therefore, if aerodynamic conditions are determined to be the worst case then, the material package stream is not beneficial. Figure 4.42 of Section 4.9 depicts the summary of the current `prototype' OpenMDS design and organizes the design results for the best and worst cases and material package spacing into a flow chart The evaluation and design of the OpenMDS thus far has proven that, if a steady state material package stream could be established, then a system to launch and capture the material packages is plausible; however, a practical OpenMDS requires significant further research and design work to make the launch system, material package system and `catcher' satellite systems feasible. The further design of these systems is highly dependent on evaluating the actual

aerodynamic effects that are occurring about the material package stream. If the aerodynamic effects are known, then specific design requirements firom the range of performance values in Figure 4.42 can be cliosen and detailed evaluation and design of the sub-systems could occur. The purpose of establishing the material package stream is to exploit slip-stream drag effects wliich have been determined to potentially decrease the launch energy requirements over 80% (see table 4.2); however, the amount of slip-stream drag reduction is dependant on the mass

183

o f the material package, the launch angle and the apogee aldtude o f the material package (or orbital altitude of the CatSAt). The proposed OpenMDS, summarized in Figure 4.42, potentially could benefit from an 18% reduction in launch energy if best case scenario of 100% drag reduction occurs for the 10 kg material packages launched at a 50 degree angle (from vertical). The proposed OpenMDS design, summarized in Figure 4.42, is likely not the optimal design and leaves plenty of potential for others to optimize the design. The interrelatedness of the sub-systems and design parameters of the OpenMDS (see Figure 2.1) requires a compromise between the competing design parameters to be determined. Throughout the evaluation of the OpenMDS, the design goal was mainly to reduce the launch velocity to levels that were achievable by current or near-term launch technology. To lower the launch velocity, the altitude of the CatSat was reduced; however, this had a negative effect of increasing the velocity difference between the CatSat and material packages. Lowering the altitude of the CatSat complicated the operation of the OpenMDS by introducing a launch window and an orbital insertion rocket motor onboard each material package. The mass of the material package was increased to reduce the upper limits of the range of required launch velocities and increase the payload mass fraction of the material package. However, increasing the material package mass caused a significant decrease in potential energy savings of the material package stream (firom 34% for the 1 kg material package to 18% for the 10 kg material package). Lowering the launch velocity has a beneficial effect of reducing the launch frequency requirements. The launch frequency requirements are dependant on the launch velocity and the spacing between the material packages. The limiting factor for creating a practical OpenMDS design will probably be the launch frequency of the launcher. The launch frequency requirement for the Very* best case scenario for the proposed OpenMDS was determined to be 211 Hz which is about double the frequency of the state of the art rotary cannon, GE M61 Vulcan. The requirements for the worst case scenarios are an order of magnitude greater than the current state o f the art. Determining an optimal OpenMDS design requires identifying an appropriate material package mass, slip-stream drag reduction effect and material package spacing that reduces the launch velocity and launch firequency to values obtainable by current or near term launch technology. The selected design values also must maximize the launch energy savings created by

184

the material package stream and maximizing the payload mass fraction of the material package to maximize the usefulness of the OpenMDS. To determine an appropriate compromise between the design parameters, evaluating the actual slip-stream drag reduction created by the material package stream is required. This evaluation should include how spacing between the material packages affects the slip-stream drag reduction. A detailed investigation of the aerodynamic effects about the material package stream will determine if the OpenMDS concept is feasible. If the drag reduction proves to be negligible, then the OpenMDS concept is irrelevant If drag reduction proves to be favorable at extended

separation distances, then the investigation should evaluate the thermal loads on the material packages. If the thermal loads are manageable then the next step of the investigation should consider if it is possible for the material packages to maintain a trajectory (flight path) in-line with each other without causing the material packages to contact each other or `pile up'. If the material packages can maintain an in-line flight path, then the last step of the investigation should consider how to initiate the material package stream and the aerodynamic effects of the transient material package stream. If the investigation of the aerodynamics effects of the material package stream is determined to be favorable then the design of the OpenMDS should continue. The following areas of the OpenMDS design could be further designed: > DOLR system could be further evaluated to determine if the concept is capable of achieving the required launch velocity and frequency. The investigation of the DOLR concept should include the effects of friction between the slipper of the rocket sled and the launch rail. If the DOLR concept proves not feasible, then railgun technology could be further considered for the launcher application. ^ The suitability of fin stabilization for the material packages could be investigated and the size and material for the fins could be specified.

185

^

The requirements for guidance, attitude control, and rocket motor systems of the material packages capable of firing the rocket motor at the correct position and time could be evaluated.

>

The feasibility of using an electrodynamic tether propulsion system to maneuver the CatSat for the purpose of collecting material packages could be evaluated. If the

electrodynamic tether system is feasible, then the design of the tether and energy storage and generation systems could be considered.
y

The space construction mission that the OpenMDS would supply should be considered. The design of the construction mission would require in-space manufacturing process to convert the raw mateidal supplied by the OpenMDS into the final form required by the design of the space project Proposing a feasible construction project is just as important as the design of the OpenMDS because without a credible and feasible space construction project there is no need for the OpenMDS. Ultimately, the further design of the OpenMDS depends on the evaluation of the

aerodynamics of the material package stream.

If the drag on the material packages is only

marginally reduced, then the usefulness of the OpenMDS concept is questionable. The design process presented in this manuscript should provide an adequate roadmap for future investigation, design and optimization o f the OpenMDS concept

6.2

Open Engineering
Establishing a developer group for the open engineering (OE) of the OpenMDS concept

was more difficult than initially expected at the commencement of this project The O E results of Section 5.4, suggest that to attract potential developers to the project^ a preliminary design of the system is required. Presumably the preliminary design demonstrates to potential participants that the concept is feasible and the present development team is committed to completing the project The Open Engineering (OE) aspect of this project did not begjn to develop until the design results of Chapter 4 were posted on the public web pages of the www.massdriver.com in May 2005 near the end of the project Until May 2005, nobody expressed an interest in the project, presumably because the concept was not proven to be either feasible or beneficial. There was simple not 186

enough information about the project to draw the attention of any potential participants. After the results were posted in May 2005, seven people have expressed an interest in joining the project. These results suggest that for an OE project to begin to attract a development group, a significant amount of design work must be completed to prove the proposed concept is feasible, beneficial and the present participants are dedicated to the project The low level of OE participation in the project might have occurred because the expertise needed to evaluate and design OpenMDS, particularly the aerodynamic effects of the material package stream, requires the participation of highly skilled aerospace professionals. The potential pool of aerospace experts willing to participate in the OpenMDS, is likely smaller than potential pool of programmers willing to work on OSS projects. OSS projects usually has an expert or a group of experts to divide the project into a number of work modules, with the skill level required to complete these modules ranging from expert to novice developers. At the present time, all the design work for the OpenMDS, requires the participation of aerospace experts, since the design of the OpenMDS depends on the aerodynamic effects that occur about the material package stream. The design of the OpenMDS has not been reduced to the level where novice developers from diverse disciplines can participate by performing design of small components or simple calculations. This is where the challenge exists, how do you attract experts to volunteer their time and effort to evaluate these aerodynamic effects? Evaluating these aerodynamic effects may require basic researcli and experimental testing such a hypersonic wind tunnel tests; these tasks are difficult to do from a home computer on à no cost basis. This aerodynamic problem probably would be best addressed by a PhD project Developers of OSS projects volunteer for OSS project because at the end of the process they are compensated for their effort with a copy of a software product that satisfies their collective needs [4]. OE projects have less tangible commodities to offer as compensation. At the end of the design process the end result is a set of documents specifying the design and possibly instructions for the construction of the design. The end result of the OSCar project (Section 2.21) was a prototype vehicle and a set of documents specifying the construction of the vehicle. Participants of the OSCar project did not receive any compensation other than the satisfaction of 187

being involved in the project It can be concluded that a tangible commodity is not essential for the success of an OE project, but it probably would attract participants. The OSCar project (Section 2.2,1) and OpenCores (Section 2,2,2) projects have had some success at adapting open source principles to the design of physical devices. The goal of both the OSCar and OpenCores projects is to improve the design of a well known technology. In the case o f OSCar, the goal is to design an improved vehicle design and the OpenCores project is to design integrated circuits with improved function and performance. Neither project requires deriving much new knowledge or much physical experimentation to permit a successful design. It is a matter o f rearranging how present technology is applied. The design of the OpenMDS concept is a little more demanding than the design goals of the OSCar and OpenCores projects because the design process is pioneering a new concept not merely improving an existing design or technology. The design of the OpenMDS is similar to ThinkCycle projects which are pioneering new designs, ThinkCycle projects use open source collaboration to identify potential projects. The design of the solution to these problems utilize the effort of student design teams rather than internet volunteers; therefore, ThinkCycle projects rely more on the traditional academic development model where basic research into new knowledge is done at the university level and then offered to industry for further development The OpenMDS project probably represents the first project to attempt deriving new knowledge firom open source collaboration, A research goal for this project was to evaluate the OE design process. This project did not attract an active developer group; therefore, this research goal remains unfulfilled. If a future project has a similar mandate to evaluate the OE design process, the subject of the design process should be carefully selected. Selecting a challenging design problem to solve using open source principles could limit the potential pool o f developers because there are a limited number of people with the required expertise. The design project must be interesting to attract the attention o f potential participants yet present a non-trivial challenge. Improving the design of a present device could fulfill these aforementioned requirements. Additionally, such a project would be a good research project because the open source development process can be easily compared to the conventional design process and benefits and drawbacks can easily be identified.

188

The fact that this project attracted the attention of seven people'*'' suggests that support for the project exists; however, it remains to be determined if the open source development model will be successful at deriving new knowledge and pioneering new designs. One sure way of

determining if this project will be successful is by continuing the project The author intends to continue the project as a hobby, either continuing to work on the www.mnssdriver.com site if it is maintained or joining-Mr.Joeri van Zuilen's project (see Section 5.4.2).-

hh Four of these people found the project because they were specifically looking (O gling) for a project to design a mass driver space launcher using open source principles.

This data is used for the drag co-efficient of the material package. The spreadsheet contains a table of Cd vs. Mach number values obtained firom Figure 3.7. The spreadsheet uses the Mach number of the material package to look up' the appropriate drag coefficient, Cd. Part N - Atmospheric Forces Acting on the Launch Body Figure B-5 is a free body diagram (FBD) that depicts the atmospheric drag force acting on a 2-D launch body.

C rfip-strcam- Factot inputted by user as the percent slip-stream reduction The calculation method for Earth_Sim_RevD is a simplistic means of evaluating a complex gas dynamic process occurring in the launch corridor. A slip-stream reduction factor of one hundred percent drag reduction is equivalent to the ideal case where the launch corridor conditions are a perfect vacuum. A slip-stream reduction factor of zero percent is equivalent to the case where the launch corridor is the full density of the atmosphere at each region. These two cases represent the range of the expected dmg effect, therefore the actual drag reduction effect exists at some point in this range.

Appendix F - Explanation for the Simulation of the Rocket Launch Rail Launcher_Simulator.xls
Purpose: To explain the calculations used for the Rocket Launch Rail simulation spread sheet. ITte simulation is used to calculate the velocity and acceleration of three different launch rails; each launch rail has a different propulsion method. The first launch rail has a rocket sled carrying the fuel and oxidizer (a conventional rocket motor - see Figure F-1). The second rocket sled carries the fuel only and the oxidizer gas is collected from the launch rail (distributed oxidizer launch rail see Figure F-2). The third rocket sled carries no propellant, both fuel and propellant is collected from the launch rail (S. Molder's distributed propellant launch rail --see Figure F-3 [17]).

Assumptions 1. The launch motion is assumed to be along a straight line. 2. Gravity forces are ignored. 3. Friction forces with the rail and the sled are ignored. 4. No thermal heating effects are considered. 5. The simulation model assumed constant acceleration during each time step. 6. The rocket sled is assumed to have the shape o f a cylinder. 7. Experimental total drag coefficient for a hypervelodty missile as a function of Mach number was used [31]. This drag co-efficient assumed a fin stabilised missile with a L /D ratio of 24. 8. The lower atmospheric density was assumed to be defined by a density function defined by data firom the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) Standard Atmosphere [33]. 9. The upper atmosphere was assumed to follow a density function defined by the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere [34]. 10. The atmospheric temperature was defined by functions for each temperature region depicted in Figure 2. [33] 11. All temperature functions in temperature regions were assumed to be linear. ,,

Message: 3 Date: Tue, 16 Mar 2004 04:08:01 -0000 From: "dean^gerl" <dgerl@rverson.ca> Subject: The Mass Driver Project Hello, This is my first time posting on a message board, so forgive me if I violate any rules (and tell me what i have done wrong). I am trying to organize a new of^n source project, the Mass Driver Project www.massdriver.com - Use, login: guest password: guest, to review the site. Open source is an internet collaboration method that has successfully developed software like Linux Operating System. These open source programs are developed by people sharing their time and talents over the internet The www.massdriver.com has been setup as a space on the web where interested people may exchange ideas, share and post knowledge, identify and work through technical problems and eventually produce a successful mass driver concept Open source projects are successful because it allows many different people to work together towards a common goal. The goal is set and modified by the people participating in the project Large projects like mass driver technology cannot be developed by one individual successfully; however connecting many individuals together can achieve such large tasks. If you have a moment, please review the website, (www.massdriver.com login: guest password: guest) - this gives read access. Click on the "Wiki" tab, OpenEngineeringProjects and MassDri verPrqject Feel yourself around in the rest o f the site. If you are interested in joining, please contact me. This project is purely an academic exercise sponsored by Ryerson University in Toronto Canada. I am a graduate student at Ryerson University. All the information obtained is public information. The web site is young, and not so pretty, so please bear with us. Thank you in advance. Dean Gerl

The following message was the second message posted to the SSI newsgroup in May 2005.
Date: Sun, 01 May 2005 03:15:24 -0000 From: "deangerl" <deangerl @hotmai I.com> Subject: Launch Rail Concept Hello, I put a few web pages summarizing my work to date for a graduate thesis on a material transport system from Earth surface to orbit Material is sent to orbit as a series o f small masses following on after another (a material package stream, if you will). The system overview can be found at www.massdriver.com/massdriver.html. The launcher system proposed I think is unique. Instead o f using an electromagnetic system, which has technical problems with energy storage and distribution, the technology is based on a novel chemical rocket sled launch rail. (I don't think the concept has been publicly proposed before.) The proposed rocket sled traverses a launch rail carrying its launch payload and half a hybrid rocket motor that is the nozzle and the solid fuel grain. As the rocket sled traverses the launch rail, it collects an oxidizer gas dispensed from the launch rail. A schematic o f the concept can be found at vvww.massdriver.com/distributed oxidizer launch rail.htm. The performance o f the rocket sled is improved since the oxidizer mass (and storage structure) does not need to be stored onboard and accelerated. Your feed back on the idea would be helpful. Dean Gerl

The following question was posted to the Mad Scientist Network in May 2004.
Question: Is there a significant hypersonic slip-stream effect? Mass drivers have been proposed for transporting lunar material. A mass driver operating on Earth must overcome the larger gravity well plus the atmospheric drag. We are proposing that drag could be minimized by rapidly launching a stream o f material pellets. It is intended that the pellets would slip-stream each other, sort o f forming a tube through the atmosphere. We are looking for feedback on the idea or references for hypersonic slip-stream studies. I am a mechanical engineer studying design theory, open source software development applied to the design o f physical products. This idea is one o f the proposed projects to develop using open source priniciples. In short, evaluating this pellet stream is not my thesis. Thank you for any feedback you can provide. Dean Gerl

The following message was posted to the Eng Tips Aeronautic Engineering forum in May 2004.
3 May 04 14:00 Is there an aerodynamic advantage to launching a stream (series) o f small hypervelocity cone-like projectiles (say 1 kg total mass) from Earth surface to Earth orbit vs. one large (1000 kg) mass? Machine gun vs. cannon ball scenario.

The idea is that the initial projectiles will reduce the drag for the following projectiles. It is envisioned that this would sort o f form a tunnel up through the atmosphere.

Any comments on this situation would be helpful; this idea is from a few mechanical engineers, so forgive us if we are violating something obvious. Dean Gerl

The following message was posted to the Eng Tips Spacecraft Eng^eering forum (Aerospace discipline) in May 2005.
3 May 05 22:09 I am a mechanical engineer working on the system design o f a material transport system for space construction "i.e. an Earth based mass driver". Instead o f the electromagnetic launcher traditionally proposed I have proposed a rocket sled that traverses the launch rail and collects an oxidizer gas dispensed from the launch rail. The oxidizer gas is Combusted in a solid fuel grain similar to a hybrid rocket motor, onboard the rocket sled. Therefore the performance o f the rocket sled is improved because the oxidizer gas and storage structure is not accelerated with the rocket sled. A schematic o f the proposed system can be viewed at http://www.massdriver.com/distributed oxidizer launch rail.htm. My question is what is the typical pressure oxidizer gas is stored on a hybrid rocket? Also I am not an aerospace expert, more o f an abstract mechanical thinker so is there any significant technical problems with this launch rail concept? I know rail friction is a real problem which might be solved by some form o f MagLev technology, like Inductrak. This space system design is an attempt at a collaborative (or Open Source) design o f a hardware product All information related to tlie project is public knowledge. , Thanks, Dean Gerl
