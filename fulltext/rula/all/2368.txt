T he heavy o il and b itu m e n reservoirs o f Canada are one o f the largest hydrocarbon sources in th e w orld. V apor e x tra c tio n o f heavy o il, o r V A P E X , has emerged as a very prom ising recovery process since its inception in 1991. The p rin c ip a l reason is the environm en tal frie n d  liness o f V A P E X together w ith its cost-effective nature vis à vis oth e r recovery processes. In th is w ork, a review has been done on various factors affecting V A P E X process. A lso, a lab-scale V A P E X experim ental setup is designed to determ ine the dispersion coefficients o f solvent gases in heavy o il and bitum en. F u rth e r, a m athem atical m odel is developed based on earlie r reported rectangular physical m odel o f homogenous porous m edium saturated w ith heavy o il and bitum en. T he developed m athem atical m odel is sim ulated to determ ine gas dispersion along w ith s o lu b ility d u rin g the vapor e xtra ctio n o f live o il fro m a la b o ra to ry scale physical m odel. A t a given tem perature and pressure, the block is in itia lly exposed on its side to a solvent gas, w hich diffuses in to the m edium and gets absorbed. The absorption o f gas reduces th e viscosity o f heavy o il and bitum en causing it to d ra in under g ra vity. T he lo w -visco sity " liv e o il" is produced a t the b o tto m o f the porous block. The p ro d u ctio n o f liv e o il w ith tim e is accom panied by the shrinkage o f block as w ell as its increased exposure to gas fro m to p . These phenomena o f V A P E X are described by the m athem atical m odel, w hich is used to calculate live o il p ro duction w ith various values o f gas s o lu b ility and dispersion. T h e ir o p tim a l values are determ ined fo r the vapor e xtra ctio n o f C old Lake b itu m en w ith butane by m atching the calculated liv e o il production w ith its experim ental values published e a rlie r.

dissolve in to th e h ig h ly viscous n a tu ra l reserves, and reduce th e ir vis c o s ity so th a t th e liv e o il can be easily pum ped o u t. V A P E X was proposed b y B u tle r and M okrys [1991], who investiga te d th e recovery o f Tangleflags N o rth o il fro m its la b scale reservoir m odel using h o t w ater and propane gas. T h e ir experim ental results showed th a t o il recovery was hig h e r th a n th a t w ith h o t w a te r alone. In a subsequent developm ent o f V A P E X , B u tle r and M okrys [1993] found th a t o il recovery was even higher w ith th e use o f propane gas alone close to its dew p o in t under reservoir conditions. These re sults revealed th e s u ita b ility o f V A P E X fo r th e effective o il recoveiy fro m th ic k as w e ll as fre q u e n tly o ccu rrin g th in reservoirs w ith m uch sm aller h e at losses th a n a conventional th e rm a l process such as Steam A ssisted G ra v ity D rainage (S A G D ). Since th a t developm ent, V A P E X has undergone s u b s ta n tia l advancem ent fro m la b o ra to ry scale studies to p ilo t p la n t investigatio ns, and com m ercial pro je cts. A num ber o f researchers have investigated V A P E X th ro u g h its lab scale physical m odel a t U n iv e rs ity o f C algary [B u tle r and M okrys, 1991, 1993, Das and B u tle r, 1994a, B u tle r and M okrys, 1998, Das and B u tle r, 1998, B u tle r and Jiang, 2000, B o u sta n i and M a in i, 2001], U n iv e rs ity o f W ate rlo o [J in , 1999, O duntan et a l., R am akrishnan, 2003, James e t a l., 2003] and A lb e rta Research C o u n cil [C u th ie ll et a l., 2003]. A t th e in d u s tria l level, a b o u t 23 C anadian o il com panies have a c tiv e ly p a rtic ip a te d in devel opm ent o f V A P E X , w hich is ra p id ly advancing tow ard its co m m ercialization.

I In p a rtic u la r, th e heavy o il and b itu m e n reservoirs o f Canada are one o f th e larg e st hyd ro car' bon sources in th e w o rld . C anadian reserves are held in the sand and carbonate sedim entary fo rm a tio n s o f A thabasca, C o ld Lake, Peace R ive r and W abasca regions as w e ll as in C arbonate T ria n g le [A lle n , 1981]. T he estim ated o rig in a l o il-in -p la ce o f these reserves is m ore th a n 400 b illio n m ^, w h ich is about tw ice th a t o f the to ta l conventio nal o il reserves o f a ll G u lf n a tio n s [Janisch, 1981]. A ccording to N a tio n a l E nergy B oard [B o a rd ], C anadian o il sands p ro d u c tio n w ill be ab o u t 160,000 m ^ /d in 2004, and it is expected to increase m ore th a n double by 2015.

T h is fa c t indicates th a t heavy o il and b itu m e n reserves have trem endous p o te n tia l to m eet th e everincreasing dem ands o f energy and useful petroleum products. T h is is p a rtic u la rly im p o rta n t a t present when conventio nal o il reserves are d e clining a ll over th e w o rld . New o il discoveries have become rare.

R ecovery o f H eavy Oil and B itu m en

C o nventio nal crude o il flow s a t reservoir te m perature, and pum ped fro m the ground, b u t o il sands m ust be m ined o r recovered in -s itu . T h e recovery o f n a tu ra l heavy o il and b itu m e n reserves is a d iffic u lt ta sk. A lth o u g h abundant, m ore th a n 90% o f these reserves lie deep in sid e th e e a rth 's crust and are n o t easily recoverable ow ing to th e ir ve ry h ig h viscosity. T he v isco sity o f b itu m e n in th e ir n a tu ra l state is ty p ic a lly in th e range, 100 to 1000 Pa-s. F or instance, th e visco sity o f Athabasca, Peace R iv e r, C old Lake and L lo y d m in s te r reservoirs are 265 000, 126 500, 65 000 and 7 000 mPa-s respectively [Das, 1995]. W ith s ta te -o f-th e -a rt surface m in in g technology, such as th a t used b y Suncor and Syncrude, th e econom ic excava tio n and tra n s p o rta tio n o f heavy o il and reserves lie close to the surface, generally lim ite d to th e depth o f 75 m eters o r less. The m a jo rity o f heavy o il and b itu m e n lie below the surface o f 400 m eters o r m ore, and can be extracted th ro u g h in -s itu techniques. Consequently, the o b je ctive o f a ll in -s itu recovery processes is to reduce th e viscosity, o r equivalently, to in  crease the m o b ility o f heavy o il and b itu m e n reserves. T h is objective is achieved by p ro v id in g a d d itio n a l energy or m ate ria ls to heavy o il and b itu m e n reserves [L a til, 1980]. In general, recovery processes can be categorized in to th ree types-- displacem ent, th e rm a l and chem ical. V A P E X fa lls in to th e th ird category o f recovery processes. T he firs t category, displacem ent recovery processes use the in je c tio n o f w ater and im m iscible .gases in to heavy o il and bitu m e n reservoirs to displace and drive o u t th e reserves. However, th e effectiveness o f displacem ent processes is severely lim ite d due to the h ig h visco sity o f heavy o il and b itu m e n reserves. M oreover, in je cte d flu id s often get wasted in a b o tto m

w a te r s a tu ra tio n zone having the least resistance to flow . Such an occurrence is frequent in Peace R ive r, C old Lake, and W abasca form a tio n s, and results in low recoveries and poor sweep efficiencies [B u tle r and M okrys, 1998]. T he second category o f th e rm a l recovery processes includes C yclic Steam In je c tio n , Steam D rive , H o t W ater D rive , In S itu C om bustion, and Steam Assisted G ra v ity D rainage (S A G D )

1 .1 R e c o v e r y o f H e a v y O il a n d B itu m e n [B u tle r, 1982]. These processes raise the tem perature o f a reservoir to reduce th e visco sity o f its reserves. For exam ple, in SAG D , steam is continuously in je cte d th ro u g h an upper h o riz o n ta l w e ll in a reservoir to create a steam cham ber a t h igh tem peratures. As a re su lt, th e heated heavy o il and b itu m e n reserves o f reduced viscosity flow by g ra v ity along th e w alls o f th e w ell in to a low er w ell. A lth o u g h accounting fo r m ore th a n 80% share in heavy o il and b itu m e n recovery [M okrys and B u tle r, 1993b], th e rm a l processes are ofte n n o t econom ical. T h e y cause large heat losses, require huge am ounts o f w ater and vast surface fa c ilitie s , and are in e fflcie n t fo r the fre q u e n tly encountered th in reservoirs [M okrys and B u tle r, 1993a, Das and B u tle r, 1994a]. T h e th ird category, chem ical recovery processes such as V A P E X use chem icals such as pure o r m ixed solvent gases to reduce the viscosity o f heavy o il and b itum en upon gas absorption. Before the in ve n tio n o f V A P E X , m any chem ical recovery processes were proposed in th e 1970s. These processes were based on th e absorption o f solvent gases in a v e rtic a l w e ll or a group o f v e rtic a l w ells inside a heavy o il and bitum en reserve [A lle n, 1973, 1974, A lle n and B edford, B row n et al., 1977, N enniger, 1979]. For exam ple, A lle n [1974] proposed H u ff and P u ff recovery u tiliz in g butane or propane as solvent. A lle n and B edford proposed th e in je c\ tio n o f liq u id solvent, and a non-condensible gas a t reservoir tem perature and pressure. Some researchers [B row n et a l., 1977, A lle n , 1973] even proposed chem ical recovery in com bin ation w ith heating. N enniger [1979] suggested a chem ical recovery process u tiliz in g pure gases or gas m ixtu re s a t pressures s lig h tly less th a n o r equal to saturated vapor pressure. D unn et al. [1989] suggested the process o f heavy o il and b itum en recovery by g ra v ity drainage using carbon d io xide and ethane a t pressure s lig h tly less tha n th e ir dew p o in t pressures. However, these chem ical recovery processes were n o t feasible as o il recovery was p o o r due to the slow d iffu sio n o f solvents in ve rtic a l w ells [Das and B u tle r, 1998]. T he lim ita tio n s o f the early chem ical recovery processes was addressed by B u tle r and M okrys [1991], w ho proposed the use o f h o rizo n ta l wells instead o f v e rtica l ones fo r the absorp tio n o f solvents, and th e subsequent recovery o f heavy o il and bitum en.

T h e ir la b scale V A P E X recovery o f Tangleflags N o rth o il w ith h o t w ater and propane gas was found to be higher th a n th a t w ith h o t w ater alone. Soon th e y fo u n d th a t th e recovery was even higher w ith th e use o f propane gas alone [B u tle r and M okrys, 1993]. Since then, V A P E X has undergone considerable developm ent fro m la b scale experim ents to  p ilo t p la n t and com m ercial p ro je ct im plem entations.

1.2

M echanism of V A PE X

T he m echanism o f V A P E X is sim ple, and is based on th e phenomenon o f visco sity re d u ctio n o f heavy o il and bitu m e n in the presence o f absorbed solvents [B u tle r and M okrys, 1991, Das and B u tle r, 1998]. As shown in F igure 1.1, V A P E X is ty p ic a lly im plem ented in a h o rizo n ta l c o n fig u ra tio n o f an in je c tio n w e ll on to p o f a p ro d u ctio n w e ll inside a heavy o il and b itu m e n reservoir. F ig u re 1.2 shows the v e rtic a l cross section o f the reservoir, w hich explains the m echanism o f V A P E X . A vaporized solvent is inje cte d to the in je c tio n w e ll a t pressures s lig h tly less th a n or equal to its s a tu ra tio n vapor pressure. A m ixtu re o f vaporized solvents can also be used. Solvent d iffu sio n and a bsorption inside the w ell reduces the viscosity o f its heavy o il and bitum en reserves, and also causes some deasphalting, i. e. the p re c ip ita tio n o f asphaltene contents. As a re su lt, th e heavy o il and b itum e n reserves become m obile and flow under g ra v ity to th e u n d e rlyin g p ro d u ctio n w ell from where they are easily recovered. The presence o f a dissolved gas in heavy o il and b itum en enhances the recovery o f heavy o il and bitum en by (i) generating a saturated displacem ent fro n t by sw elling o il in reservoir pores [W elker and D u nlop, 1963, Sim on and Graue, 1965], and (ii) reducing adhesive forces between o il globules, film s and connate w ater [Beecher and P arkhurst, 1926, Rosman and Zana, 1977]. In V A P E X , a solvent gas m ixes w ith the bitum en phase through com bined phenomena o f m olecular d iffu sio n , viscosity reduction, c a p illa ry action, g ra v ita tio n a l flow , and si ' fa c e . renewal. T he net effect is dispersion, which can n o t be described by solvent d iffu s iv ity alone.

T he h o rizo n ta l w ells are especially superior in th e reservoir where heavy o il and b itum e n reserves are present in a th in fla t zone. These w ells enable a greater coverage o f the reserves, thereby o ffering a cost-effective recovery op e ration. F or m any heavy o il and b itum en reservoirs, the use o f h o riz o n ta l wells over short distances is a po p u la r choice so as to avoid h igh in je c tio n pressures and channeling o f solvents [T u rta and Singhal, 2004]. However, instead o f the use o f h o rizo n ta l w e ll pairs, several other con figuratio ns are also possible in V A P E X process [Das and B u tle r, 1998].

C anadian o il in d u s try is facing challenges associated w ith environm ental im pact, ca p ita l costs, energy requirem ents and w ater requirem ents w ith c u rre n tly used (SAG D ) heavy o il and b itum en recovery techniques. V A P E X has a num ber o f advantages over other heavy o il and bitum en recovery processes. The advantages o f V A P E X range fro m its cost-effectiveness to environm ental co m p a tib ility , and have been verified in a recent investig a tio n carried out by Lu h n in g et al. [2003].

V A P E X has low ca p ita l costs as the in je c tio n o f vaporized solvents does n o t require extensive surface fa c ilitie s . Since solvent in je c tio n does n o t involve th e energy losses th a t are char a cte ris tic o f th e rm a l recovery processes, V A P E X is very econom ical. For same p ro d u ctio n ra te , V A P E X uses approxim ate ly 3% o f the energy consumed by SAG D [S inghal et a l., 1997]. C om pared to liq u id solvents, vaporized solvents provide a higher d riv in g force fo r the g ra v ity drainage o f heavy o il and bitum en, and are easily recoverable. L a b o ra to ry results show th a t 90% o f in je cte d solvents can be retrieved and recycled in V A P E X [Singhal et al., 1997]. I t is notew orthy th a t V A P E X has a positive bearing on the q u a lity and cost effectiveness o f recovered heavy o il and bitum en. V A P E X carried o u t a t pressures close to the saturated vapor pressure o f solvent results in deasphalted, and upgraded heavy o il and bitum en. A s a consequence, subsequent heavy o il and bitum en tre a tm e n t is m inim ized. Table 1.1 indicates th e supply costs o f c u rre n tly used heavy o il and b itum en p ro d u ctio n techniques [B oard]. A ccording to Das [2002], Athabasca bitum en extracted w ith V A P E X , w ill have the esti m ated supply costs o f C D N $9 per barrel. The supply costs include a ll costs associated w ith p ro d u ctio n , in c lu d in g operating costs, ca p ita l costs, taxes, royalties and a ra te o f re tu rn on investm ent. T h is result is a m a jo r m o tiva tio n to o il in d u s try w hich is actively p a rtic ip a tin g in the research, developm ent and com m ercialization o f V A P E X . F in a lly , V A P E X is very suitable fo r the heavy o il and bitum en reservoirs, v.^hich have h igh w ater content, th in pay zones, low th e rm a l cond u ctivitie s o f rock fo rm ations, and un d e rlyin g aquifers [S inghal et a l., 1997, James et al., 2003].

scale using the physical m odels o f heavy o il and b itu m e n reservoirs. T he im p o rta n t factors w hich influence V A P E X are viscosity o f heavy o il and bitum en, deasphalting o f heavy o il and bitum en, d iffu sio n o f solvent in to heavy o il and bitum en, dispersion o f solvent w ith heavy o il and bitum en, solvent selection fo r V A P E X and geological factors o f reservoir. In th e fo llo w in g sections, d e tails are presented to show how each fa c to r influences th e V A P E X process.

V isc o sity o f heavy o il and b itu m en

E vid e n tly, i t is the high viscosity o f heavy o il and bitum en th a t is th e m a jo r obstacle in th e ir recovery. T he reduction in the viscosity o f heavy o il and bitu m en, and the increase in th e ir m o b ility are th e objectives o f a ll recovery processes. In V A P E X , the gaseous solvent in je c tio n results in viscosity reduction. The viscosity o f heavy o il and b itum e n is a strong fu n c tio n o f tem perature fo r n a tu ra l sam ple in com parison w ith pressure; b u t w h ile gases are dissolved in to heavy o il and b itu m e n , pressure can effectively influence the viscosity [Strausz, 1989]. In general, heavy o il viscosity is the fu n ctio n o f tem perature, concentration o f dissolved gases, pressure and asphaltene content. For exam ple, the mean viscosity o f A thabasca bitu m en, based on some tw enty sets o f data, decreases by five orders o f m agnitude from 900 Pa-s a t 20°C to 0.01 Pa-s a t 200°C [Seyer and G yte, 1989]. The effect o f dissolved gases can be even stronger. Several gases like carbon dioxide, ethane, m ethane, carbon m onoxide, and nitrogen reduce the viscosity o f bitum en rem arkably [Svrcek and M ehrotra, 1982, M e h ro tra and Svrcek, 1985a,b,c].

Based on th e num ber o f m oles o f gas absorbed in bitu m e n , the m ost effective gas fo r viscosity re d u ctio n am ong these gases is ethane w h ich is follow ed by (in th e decreasing order o f effect) carbon dioxide, m ethane, carbon m onoxide, and nitrogen . T h e crude o il is classified by its h ig h viscosities and low A P I gravities [S inghal e t al., 1997]. I f the crude o il has th e visco sity low er th a n 10,000 cP w ith A P I g ra v ity o f 20° o r less, it is know n as heavy o il, and i f the viscosity greater th a n 10,000 cP, w ith A P I g ra v ity o f 10° or less, it is know n as b itu m e n [Seyer and G yte, 1989].

S olvent gas d iffu sio n in th e heavy o il and b itu m e n is the p rim a ry reason fo r visco sity reduc tio n and hence it affects th e p ro d u ctio n ra te [Das and B u tle r, 1996], w hich makes d iffu sio n phenom enon m ost im p o rta n t in V A P E X process. D iffu s iv ity o f gas in liq u id can be deter m ined by e ith e r experim ental m ethods or by e m p irica l correlations [U p re ti and M e h ro tra , 2000]. The experim ental m ethods are classified under d ire ct m ethod and in d ire c t m ethod. T he d ire ct m ethod involves th e com positional analysis o f liq u id samples extracted a t d iffe re n t tim e . In d ire c t m ethods are classified under tw o categories, (i) based on p ro p e rty change such as, volum e, pressure, solute v o la tiliz a tio n ra te , p o sitio n o f gas-liquid interface etc., and ( ii) d iffu s iv ity m easurem ent fro m self-diffusion coefficients w hich are measured by N M R spec troscopy [U p re ti and M e h ro tra , 2000].

Due to th e s ig n ifica n t am ount o f asphaltene content, heavy o il and b it amen have higher viscosity, w hich creates a serious and com plex problem in tra n s p o rta tio n , and requires d ilu tio n w ith lig h t com ponents, o r conversion to m ake i t tra n s p o rta b le [M okrys and B u tle r, 1993b]. B ra y and B ahlke [1938] studied th e effectiveness o f various n-alkanes in deasphalting, and fo u n d th a t am ong a ll these solvents, ethane gives m axim um asphaltene p re c ip ita tio n , and the p re c ip ita tio n decreases in the order o f propane, butane, pentane and hexane.

The low -m oleculax-w eight vaporized solvent can be inje cted a t its dew p o in t as a recovery agent in th e V A P E X process. The use o f vaporized solvent a t its dew p o in t has several advantages, w hich are: (i) A s the vaporized solvent offers m axim um s o lu b ility near its dew p o in t, the ingress o f vaporized solvent is advantageous near its vapor pressure a t reservoir tem p erature [Das, 1995].

In general, solvent selection c rite ria are based on several factors: m a in ly e q u ilib riu m pressure, m olecular w eight, d ensity difference, s o lu b ility , d iffu s iv ity , and reservoir tem perature and pressure [R am akrishnan, 2003]. Das and B u tle r [1996, 1994a] suggested th a t propane and butane are very effective solvents fo r V A P E X process, and proved th a t propane diffuses faster th a n butane.

Thus, it was necessary to stu d y the effect o f m ixed solvent on VAPEX.

Several authors have studied th e effect o f geological factors (pay zone length, perm e a b ility, heterogeneity, d ip angle and re sidual o il sa tu ra tio n ) on the p ro d u ctio n rate. i) Effect o f Pay Zone Length on Production rate: T he pay zone lenght is the h eight o f the reservoir where the heavy o il and b itu m e n are situate d. O duntan et al. used rectangular channel o f variable le ngth (21-247 cm ); b u t same ca v ity dim ensions to stu d y th e effect o f pay zone le n g th on p ro d u c tio n rate. T hey observed th a t the p ro d u ctio n ra te was constant u n til 80-90% o f cum ulative o il p ro d u ctio n had taken place, fo r a given length. T he overall recovery was found to be a b o u t 85-92% o f the in itia l o il in place. T hey found th a t the v o lu m e tric p ro d u ctio n rate was p ro p o rtio n a l to the square ro o t o f the pay zone length , and th e co rre la tio n fo r a com position o f 136 darcy p e rm e a b ility and 38% p o ro sity a t 45° d ip angle was: Q = 0.0014L" f (2.10)

where Q (m ^/h .m ) is the vo lu m e tric p ro d u ctio n flo w rate per u n it w id th o f m odel and Lp* is thickness o f the pay zone in m eter. ii ) Effect o f D ip Angle: R am akrishnan [2003], and O duntan et a l. studied the effect o f d ip angle on the p ro d u ctio n rate. R am akrishnan [2003] used homogeneous system o f 156 darcy p e rm e a b ility to conduct the experim ent w ith the d ip angles o f 45°, 75°, 80° and 90°. T h e results showed th a t p ro d u ctio n rate increased w ith increased d ip angle fro m 45° to 90°, and m axim um p ro d u ctio n ra te was obtained a t 90° d ip angle, due to the fa c t th a t steep angle possesses m ore g ra vity.

The use o f high p e rm e a b ility was n o t w e ll understood because th e rela tio n sh ip to calculate the p e rm e a b ility in Hele-Shaw cell was lim ite d fo r low perm eab ilities only (sm all p la te spacing).

In m ost recent study, O duntan et al. used the p e rm e a b ility o f 25, 85, 136 and 192 darcy in th e ir experim ent and found the s im ila r result as Das [1997], and B u tle r and M okrys [1998]. O duntan et al. also found th a t volu m e tric flow rate is p ro p o rtio n a l to the square ro o t o f perm eability, and the co rre la tio n was; Q = 0.0348A "'^^ ( 2 .1 1 )

where Q is in cm ^/m in and K is in darcy. Jiang and B u tle r [1995] perform ed series o f experim ents to investigate the effects o f con tinuous and discontinuous lo w -p erm eability layers using a two dim ensional physical m odel (14 inches w ide, 9 inches high and 1.25 inches th ic k ) w ith h orizontal layers o f tw o different sized sands to get diffe re n t p e rm eability (20-30 mesh fo r 217 darcy and 30-50 mesh fo r 43.5 darcy), by using butane as solvent to recover Tangleflags, N orth fie ld and Lloydm inster o il. T hey found th a t low -p e rm e a b ility layers results in low er o il p ro duction rate than a t w ith a homogeneous m odel o f h igh-perm ea bility packing.

V A P E X is a process in v o lv in g m icroscopic, pore scale phenomena th a t occur over a large, m acroscopic area.

As solvent gas diffuses in to the heavy o il and b itu m e n , it gets less viscous and drains o u t under th e a ction o f g ra vity. T h e ir ob je ctive was to stu d y m echanism o f V A P E X a t pore scale. Jin [1999], O duntan e t al., and R am akrishnan [2003] used a m icrom odel th a t was etched on glass. T he pore scale aspects o f V A P E X observed in O duntan e t a l.'s w ork [O duntan et al.] is shown in the figure 2.3. A s shown in the F ig u re 2.3, the butane vapor gets absorbed in to heavy o il and b itum en a t surface pores, w hich tra p the butane vapor, and viscous heavy o il and bitum en gets d ilu te d so on. T h is low viscosity d ilu te d o il drains consequently under th e a ction o f g ra vity. The new pores are exposed once the form er d ra in as shown in figure fig.2.3a. As a re su lt, there is a chain o f drainage and replacem ent in the pores. A t the top end o f m odel where the packing begins, it replaces by solvent vapor since th a t end closes to o il flow when heavy o il in the pores gets d ilu te d and drained. R ather than at the oth e r sections o f m odel,

d ilu te d o il em pties fa ste r fro m th e pores a t the to p end o f m odel. Such process results in th e m ovem ent o f the solvent v a p o r/o il interface down in to the packing a t the to p end o f m odel faster (see F ig. 2.4).

U nder specified tem perature and pressure cond itio n s, th e block is in itia lly exposed to a solvent gas on the v e rtic a l face on rig h t hand side. The gas diffuses in to the b lo ck, and gets absorbed in heavy o il and b itu m e n . T h e ab so rption o f gas reduces th e visco sity o f heavy o il and b itu m e n causing it to flo w under g ra v ity th ro u g h porous m edium . T he lo w -viscosity o il or "liv e o il" is produced a t th e b o tto m o f th e block. T h e flow o f liv e o il a t th e exposed surface renews it continuously, thereby enhancing the tra n s fe r o f gas in to heavy o il and bitum en.

The gra d ie n t o f h e ig h t w ith respect to w id th decreases considerably w ith tim e as can be seen fro m the ^gure. The gradient is the m ost negative in the end. T he reason fo r th is behavior is th e im ple m e n ta tio n o f V A P E X under the con stra in t o f in itia l and boundary condition s given by E quations (4 .1 0 )-(4 .1 3 ). In itia lly , the concentration o f gas and re su ltin g liv e o il p ro d u ctio n are higher, closer to the exposed surface o f block on rig h t hand side where the consequent re d u ctio n o f height begins. W ith the passage o f tim e , th is re d u ctio n increasingly exposes the b lo ck to gas fro m the to p , beginning from the to p rig h t corner. T h is exposure, w hich progressively increases w ith tim e , results in the increasingly negative g ra d ie n t o f height o f block w ith respect to its thickness.

In order to e xplain the v a ria tio n o f mass fra c tio n in th e block a t given tim e , the e x tra p o la tio n o f shrinked g rid size to o rig in a l g rid size was done. As th e b lo ck was exposed to gas a t rig h t hand side, the sa tu ra tio n mass fra c tio n was obtaine d a t th e o il-so lve n t interface, w hich is shown in Figures 5.4 and 5.5.

T he fig u re 5.4 shows volum e o f o il was produced a t 1.2 hrs was less th a n th a t a t 4 hrs. A t 4 hrs, th e blo ck shrinked rem arkably, and gas occupied higher volum e th a n a t 1.2 hrs o f o p e ra tio n tim e . O n rig h t hand side, as the o il was always exposed to gas, th e s a tu ra tio n mass fra c tio n was observed in o il (F igures 5.4and 5.5). I t can be analyzed fro m F igure 5.4 and F igure 5.5 th a t a t t= 1 .2 hrs, o n ly 10 g rid p o in ts have the pure gas i.e . w = 1.

Conclusion

T h is thesis is the ground w o rk fo r the d e te rm in a tio n o f dispersion o f solvent gases in heavy o il and b itu m e n a t V A P E X ope ra tin g condition s. As a p a rt o f dispersion d e te rm in a tio n , th e experim ental setup was designed to p erform th e lab-scale V A P E X experim ent. F u rth e r, a m a th e m a tica l m odel was developed and sim ulated to describe V A P E X in a recta n g u la r block o f homogenous porous m edium a t specified tem perature and pressure. T h is m odel was used to determ ine th e s o lu b ility (s a tu ra tio n mass fra c tio n ) and dispersion o f butane in C old Lake bitu m e n . B o th heavy o il and bitu m e n viscosity, and gas dispersion were considered to be dependent on com position. The shrinkage o f block d u rin g V A P E X , i. e. its m oving bound ary w ith tim e and space was taken in to account. T he sim ulations o f m odel were based on th e pre vio u sly reported experim enta l d a ta o f V A P E X im p lem entatio n in a la b o ra to ry scale physical m odel. D iffe re n t values fo r the s o lu b ility and dispersion o f butane were used in th e sim ulations. T he o p tim u m s o lu b ility and dispersion were determ ined fo r w hich the ro o t mean square fra c tio n a l e rro r between the sim ulated and experim ental values o f liv e o il p ro d u ctio n is m inim um . C orresponding dispersion o f butane in C old Lake b itum en was found to be fo u r orders o f m agnitude higher th a n previously reported m olecular d iffu sio n o f butane in heavy o il and bitum en.

Recommendations for Future Work
1. T he dispersion coefficients o f butane in heavy o il and b itu m e n can be m easured fo r above am bient tem perature. 2. The dispersion coefficients o f oth e r gases i. e. propane, ethane, m ethane and carbon dioxide can be measured fo r d iffe re n t tem perature and pressure condition s. 3. Recent stu d y has proved th a t the use o f m ixed solvents v /ith p roper p ro p o rtio n can give th e p ro d u ctio n rate alm ost same as pure solvent. As a m a tte r o f fa c t th a t m ixed solvents are m ore econom ic to pure solvents, so the dispersion coefficients fo r m ixed solvents can be measured fo r econom ic v ia b ility .
