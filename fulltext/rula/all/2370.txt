ABSTRACT
A ssessm ent o f the Subsurface Pathogen A batem ent Effects o f N utrient M anagem ent Policy in Ontario. © Steven R ebellato, 2004 M aster o f Applied Science in the Program o f Environm ental Applied Science and M anagem ent

T he transport m echanism s o f pathogens through the subsurface environm ent are com plex. Provincial legislation, such as O ntario's N utrient M anagem ent A ct (2002) is designed to control nutrients in agricultural settings and it is assum ed that the Act also attempts to control pathogens from reaching source waters. The study examined the progressive restrictions on agricultural practices that are sources o f pathogens in water. Furthennore, current research in m icrobial subsurface transport and m odeling was exam ined to determ ine if existing legislation is sufficient in controlling pathogens. Analysis showed that research gaps in microbial subsurface transport studies restricts subsurface research and transport m odels from effectively predicting the fate o f pathogens. Furtherm ore, gaps in research restrict nutrient m anagem ent legislation from protecting source w aters from pathogens. Research showed that a `critical control point' strategy that acts to decrease pathogen loading to agricultural surfaces is key in reducing the risks that m icroorganism s pose to ground w ater sources.

Chapter One: Introduction
1.1 Background
A s part o f the governm ent o f O ntario's Clean W ater Strategy, the N utrient M anagem ent Act_(2002) provides province-w ide standards to address the effects o f agricultural practices on the environm ent, especially as they relate to land-applied m aterials containing nutrients. N utrients, such as nitrates and phosphates, are substances available in animal w astes and are utilized by plants along w ith surface and subsurface organism s for grow th. H ow ever, land-applied nutrients, including anim al w astes, not only contain high loads o f organic m atter, b u t also contain m icroorganism s, and specifically hum an and anim al pathogens. O riginating from livestock, pathogens o f concern include bacteria, viruses and protozoa. O f particular concern to public health officials, bacteria, viruses and protozoa can cause disease and death both in anim als and in hum ans.

T he purpose o f the N utrient M anagem ent A ct (2002) is to provide for the m anagem ent o f m aterials containing nutrients in w ays that w ill enhance the protection o f the natural environm ent and provide fo r a sustainable future for the agricultural com m unity (N utrient M anagem ent A ct B ackgrounder, 2002). K ey to the legislative fram ew ork dJQ N u trien t M anagem ent P lans (N M P) and N utrient M anagem ent Strategies (N M S) w hich are science-based tools that use best m anagem ent p ra ctices to m anage nutrients in an environm entally-responsible m an n er (N utrient M anagem ent A ct B ackgrounder, 2002). The A ct is not designed to control pathogens, b u t rather, is focused on the m anagem ent o f nutrients in agricultural settings. Indirectly, it is assum ed that the A ct attem pts to control both nutrients and pathogens given that flow patterns o f nutrients through the subsurface environm ent are (in som e respects) sim ilar to the flow o f pathogens as is observed w ith viral flow. H ow ever, due to the differences in m icrobial size, behaviour, viability, and surface properties (M aw dsley et al. 1995), the transport and survival m echanism s o f m icroorganism s in the subsurface rem ain different from nutrients. This does not m ean that nutrient flow is, in all respects, different from m icroorganism flow. H ow ever, the disparities noted betw een the flow characteristics

m ust be accounted fo r in legislation so that source w aters are protected b o th from nutrients and pathogens.

U ntil the release o f th e N utrient M anagem ent A ct (2002), the province o f O ntario had n ev er directly addressed b o th nutrient m anagem ent and pathogen control at th e agricultural level. A lthough nutrient m anagem ent and pathogen control practices w ere not addressed specifically, they w ere indirectly attended to by best m anag em en t practices (voluntary based policy instrum ents) that w ere intended to decrease nuisances from daily agricultural practices. T h e scientific aspect o f nutrient m anagem ent, and m ore specifically pathogen control, did n o t begin to receive attention until the early portion o f the 1970s. Even during the 1970s, nuisance issues such as odours played a significant role in legislation than did m icrobiological control. In fact, `organism s' w ere not m entioned until the release o f the Canada A n im a l W aste M anagem ent G uide in 1972.

S cientific evidence in current m icrobial transport research m u st p lay a critical role in the m anagem ent o f nutrients and m icroorganism s in agricultural operations. Scientific m ethods and research dem and precision. R esearch in nutrient m anagem ent and pathogen transport should dictate source w ater protection legislation. U nderstanding the transport pathw ays o f specific pathogens o f concern is critical to w ater protection. Furtherm ore, com prehension o f the subsurface environm ental conditions w hich support abatem ent (m eaning to decrease or p u t an end to) or transport o f pathogens is significant. The requirem ent for pathogen m anagem ent initiatives in the province o f O ntario is critical to health o f its population. N o t only are large-scale contam ination events an im portant indicator for change, b u t it is also significant to recognize private contam ination events o f wells from pathogenic organism s as a serious public health threat. Furtherm ore, as largescale agricultural operations becom e increasingly prevalent on the O ntario landscape, it is essential that pathog'=n control is an im portant part o f any future source w ater protection strategy.

Is there sufficient research available to develop a pathogen m anagem ent strategy w hich identifies `critical con tro ls' or hazardous environm ental settings w h ich w ould

abate m icroorganism s quickly in the subsurface? Is current research adequate to com prehend the transport pathw ays o f all pathogens? Is enough know n o f th e

environm ental conditions w hich support transport or encourage abatem ent o f pathogens? Based o n current m icrobial tran sp o rt research in the subsurface environm ent, is the N utrient M anagem ent Act_(2002) sufficient to protect O ntario's ground w ater sources and preserv^e p u b lic health?

T h e follow ing thesis is a part o f broader nutrient and pathogen m anagem ent research (Stiefelm eyer, 2003) that exam ined current international nutrient m anagem ent legislation and studied surface transport o f nutrients and pathogens in the environm ent. The follow ing study will exam ine previous legislation in the Province o f O ntario and attem pt to determ ine i f current research is sufficient at controlling m icrobial transport through th e subsurface environm ent.

1.2 Proposed Hypothesis
Based on current research a n d know ledge in the fie ld o f m icrobial subsurface pathogen abatem ent and transport, does current nutrient m anagefnent legislation in Ontario sufficiently p ro tect ground w ater sources fro m pathogens? O nce a m icroorganism is introduced to the subsurface environm ent, physochem ical, biological, and environm ental factors affect its m ovem ent. M any variables w ill determ ine w hether the m icroorganism is abated or transported vertically or horizontally tlirough the soil. N utrient m anagem ent legislation, such as O ntario's N utrient M anagem ent A ct (2002) although created to protect source w aters from agricultural nutrients, is also assum ed to protect source w aters from pathogens originating from livestock w astes applied to land. It is also assum ed that regulations m ade under the Act are founded on sound scientific research.

The assessm ent o f m icrobial survival and transport through the subsurface environm ent w ill determ ine if there is sufficient inform ation pertaining to subsurface

transport in research. The study w ill then determ ine if there is adequate research to support requirem ents provided b y nutrient m anagem ent legislation.

1.3 Purpose and Objectives
T he purpose o f the study is to exam ine past and current research in the field o f soil m icrobiology, focusing on pathogen abatem ent and transport to determ ine i f the Nutrient M anagem ent A ct (2002) is sufficient at reducing tire likelihood that pathogens will reach groundw ater sources and cause hum an illness. The study is a research-focused analysis com paring current know ledge o f m icrobial abatem ent and transport to the Province o f O ntario's current m anagem ent strategy, the N utrient M anagem ent Act_(2002) w hich aims to protect groundw ater from nutrients applied to land. There are 4 objectives in the study: 1. To establish how p revious legislation in Ontario has attem pted to control pathogen movemerit to soil and the subsurface environm ent.

T he purpose o f this legislation review is to exam ine the progressive restrictions on agricultural practices that are com m on sources o f pathogens found in w ater. The legislative review w ill exam ine governm ent docum ents w hich address (either directly or indirectly) pathogen control and source w ater protection initiatives.

2.

To evaluate cm ren t m icrobial abatem ent and transport research investigating the subsurjuce environment.

This objective will review scientific research on subsurface survival and transport o f pathogens from agricultural sources to determ ine the current state o f know ledge.

3.

To assess the relationship between current subsurface m icrobial transport and abatem ent research and m icrobial transport models.

T he purpose o f this objective is to exam ine m icrobial transport m odels to determ ine i f fate and transport m echanism s can be adequately predicted based on the findings o f current research.

4.

To p ro p o se an alternative m anagem ent strategy to p ro tect w ater sources fro m p athogens based on current research.

T he purpose o f this objective is to investigate existing predictive m odels o f pathogen survival and transport in the subsurface environm ent and to assess the usefulness o f m odels in predicting m icrobial w ater contam ination.

1.4 Outline
The thesis has been laid out as follows. Chapter Two exam ines previous nutrient m anagem ent related legislation in the province o f Ontario beginning from A n A ct Respecting the Public H ealth (1873) to current legislation such as the N utrient M anagem ent A ct (2002). C hapter Three exam ines current m icrobial subsurface research focusing on fate, transport and abatement o f pathogens including bacteria, viruses and protozoa through the subsurface environment. Chapter Four exam ines m icrobial m odels including stochastic-geom etric transport models and reaction-kinetic m odels which replicate and attem pt to predict the rate and m echanism s o f transport through the subsurface environm ent. C hapter Four also identifies gaps in m odeling research which lim it the predictive capabilities o f m icrobial transport m odels for pathogen m anagem ent systems. Chapter Five exam ines existing environm ental m anagem ent systems pertaining to the m anagem ent o f pathogens in agiicultural systems. This chapter also identifies (based on current pathogen abatem ent research) the necessary com ponents fo r an alternative pathogen m anagem ent strategy. Finally, Chapter Six concludes and provides recom m endations for future research initiatives in subsurface transport and nutrient m anagem ent strategies.

Chapter Two: Pathogen Abatement and Nutrient Management in Ontario: 1873-2003
Since confederation, the agricultural industry in Canada has proven to b e a cornerstone o f econom ic strength and stability in the economy. Even today, agriculture plays a large role in the sustainability o f the econom y and serves as a k ey benchm ark for overall m arket success and health. W hen the agricultural industry struggles (as was displayed during tlie B ovine Spongiform Encephalopathy threat in 2003), so does the economy, and vice versa.

Since the incidence o f the Escherichia coli 0157; H7 outbreak in W alkerton, Ontario (2000), there has been increasing concern about the relationship between agricultural practices, w ater quality, and pathogens in the environm ent. H owever, the events o f W alkerton are not the only concern for the province o f Ontario. Large-scale m icrobial contam ination events o f private wells point to the requirem ent for pathogencontrol centered legislation. F or example, a study b y Goss et al. (1998) showed that 14.9% o f w ells registered in the province o f Ontario had positive registered evidence o f pollution w ith Escherichia coli. Legislation and research have taken predom inant roles in the relationships betw een these entities so that agricultural practices are managed, w ater quality is protected, and pathogen abatem ent is im plem ented. W ith the introduction o ï Wïq N utrient M anagem ent A ct in 2002, large and sm all-scale agricultural businesses alike in O ntario have been asked to com ply with m ore stringent legislation than the industry has ever been asked to m eet in the past.

Since 1885, legislation has been an im portant part o f the everyday processes o f the farm ing com munity. Eaidier in the 20`* ' century, m ost governm ent publications did n ot specifically address nutrient m anagem ent and pathogen abatem ent directly. This was due in part because research did not dictate a concern in these areas o f agricultural process. However, as tim e passed, issues such as nutrient application to land, nutrient storage, w ater quality, odour control and setback distances becam e m ore prom inent in com m unities. Furtherm ore, the need for legislation stem m ed from the ever-increasing

collisions betw een rural settings and urban com munities. N uisance com plaints and odour concerns played a large part in the developm ent o f several codes and guidelines that helped shape legislation in subsequent years. Chapter Tw o discusses the docum ents that I shaped nutrient m anagem ent legislation from as early as 1873 with the introduction o f the Public H ealth A ct to the release o f the N utrient M anagem ent A ct in 2002. T he following is a com prehensive look at governm ent docum entation in Ontario which fo cu s' (or have > focused) on nutrient m anagem ent, pathogen m anagem ent and source w ater protection initiatives.

2.1 Previous legislation
: ' N utrient and pathogen m anagem ent activities have been addressed either directly or indirectly in several governm ent documents and legislation since 1873. T he following section attem pts to indicate the progressive changes/controls on farm m anure practices to control pathogens, and to indicate the limitations (if any) in controlling surface and
i

subsurface pathogens from agricultural sources in Ontario. This section identifies significant governm ent docum entation pertaining to pathogen centered provincial docum ents. For further reference to documents w ith added relevance to this study, see A ppendix 2.2. > ' 2.1.1 An A ct R especting the Public Health (1873), the Health Protection and Prom otion A ct (1990), and the M andatory Health Program s and Services Guidelines (1997) A n A ct prim arily developed for the control o f disease and spread o f illness among , the residents o f the Province o f Ontario, An Act R especting the Public H ealth (1878) along with its later successor, the H ealth Protection and Prom otion A ct (1990) utilized ^ several general duty clauses w hich indirectly tackled the issues o f nutrient m anagem ent and control o f pathogens w hich m ay have been a threat to the public's health. N either I i
1

-i /

Act directly m entions, restricts, or regulates the application or m anagem ent o f nutrients on agricultural land. However, general duty clauses in both Acts allow the M inistry o f Health to becom e involved w henever (in the opinion o f the M edical officer o f Health), a legitim ate "H ealth H azard'' exists.

In the Act R especting the Public H ealth (1878), a general duty clause pertaining to health hazards w as given as follows;

I f upon such exam ination they fi n d that the prem ises are in a filth y or unclean state, or that any m atter or thing is there which, in their opinion, may endanger the pu b lic health, they or any t^vo o f them, m ay order the proprietor or occupant o f the prem ises to cleanse the sam e and to rem ove what is so fo u n d there. (A ct Respecting the Public Health, 1878, s. 2)

Similarly, in the H ealth Protection a n d Prom otion A ct (1990), a clearer definition o f w hat constitutes a `health hazard' is provided,

A H ealth hazard means, (a) a condition o f a prem ise (b) a substance, thing, plant, anim al other than man, or (c) a solid, liqind, gas, or com bination o f any o f them, that has or is likely to have an adverse effect on the health o f any person. (H ealth Protection and Prom otion Act, 1990, s. 1(1))

T he focus o f programs and legislation developed under the um brella o f the M inistry o f H ealth have been for the protection o f the public good and environm ents w here people live. Developed under the H ealth Protection and Prom otion A ct (1995), the M andatoiy H ealth Program s and Services Guidelines (M HPSG) w ere created for all Health U nits in the province o f Ontario to follow. Program s within the G uidelines include, am ong others, a program for 'Safe Water'. A lthough w ater quality is accounted for tlirough Provincial legislation in the M inistry o f the Envirom,. int and the M inistry o f A griculture and Food, the M inistry o f H ealth still has a role in the protection o f w ater such as testing o f potable public dom ains along w ith acting as leaders in the interpretation o f water results for public consum ption. The goal o f the Safe Water Program is to reduce the incidence o f w ater-hom e illness in the population. In doing so, Provincial Health Units are expected to m aintain records o f all public drinking w ater systems, receive

reports o f adverse drinking w ater test results from the drinking w ater systems, have a w ritten protocol for dealing with adverse drinking w ater test results from the drinking w ater systems listed, and act in accordance with the Ontario D rinking Water Objectives (revised 1994) to protect the health o f the public w henever an adverse drinking w ater test result is received. 2.1.2 Canadian Code for Farm Buildings (1964) Released in 1964, the Canadian Code fo r Farm Buildings was developed as a guide for the design, construction, rem odeling and evaluation o f a w ide variety o f farm buildings (other than living quarters) by the Associate Com m ittee on the N ational Building Code. Like guidelines, codes are inform ation-based voluntary docum ents available to the public. They do not hold any legislative m erit, unless adopted b y a regulation or an act. Although the code falls short o f prescribing codes for nutrient management, it is clear that the practices consistent w ithin the code are required for effective m anagem ent o f nutrients, especially those practices dealing with adequate storage capacities and sighting o f storage facilities in relation to w ater courses and other structures.

The recom m endations in the Code, unless otherwise stated, "are consistent w ith good m anagem ent practices to prom ote efficient production and storage, econom ical construction and the protection o f environm ental quality" (1975). For example, foundations and footings are constructed in relation to 'vater table levels on a farm or agricultural operation.

Like other codes developed and released in the 1970s, the Canadian Code for Farm Buildings w as consistent in attem pting to reduce the likelihood that neighbouring com munities w ould be nuisanced by farm ing and other agiicultural practices. A ny and all existing or proposed animal enterprises and facilities were required to be built at "adequate" distances from neighbouring residences {Canadian Code fo r Farm Buildings, 1975, s. 1.3.2.1. (5)(a)). Furthermore, location and arrangem ent o f new animal production facilities w ere based on considerations o f dust, odours, prevailing w inds and the proxim ity and direction o f neighbours. Additional issues included site surface

drainage, subsoil conditions, m anure storage (type and location), m anure pile and feedlot ru n o ff detention, natural surface and subsurface w aters, snow cover, space for expansion/renovations, and traffic routes for farm operations (Canadian Code for Farm Buildings, 1975 s. 2 .1 .1.)- T he m ain focus o f the section entitled `environm ental protection' pertained to the storage o f m anure with sufficient storage capacity to avoid the necessity o f disposal on snow, frozen ground or sensitive crops (Canadian Code for Farm Buildings, 1975, s. 2.2.6.1 (1)(2)). As w ill becom e apparent in future codes and guidelines, nutrient application on snow and frozen ground is not perm itted.

M anure storage system s (based on the Code released in 1970) w ere designed based on the type o f m anure (solid or liquid) and the num ber o f anim als present on the farm (indicated by a num erical table). No inform ation about how num bers w ere obtained w as provided in the Code. Storage facilities w ere encouraged to be designed to control liquids and to w ithstand environm ental conditions so that ru n o ff was controlled. W ash w aters from m anure storage facilities w ere required to be offset into m anure tanks or lagoons so as to avoid unnecessary ru n o ff to land. M uch o f the detail provided in the 1970, 1975 and 1977 Codes is not included in m ore recent editions (1983, 1990). The 1983 edition o f the Canadian Farm Building Code was rewritten to reflect the focus o f other building codes in C anada and as a result placed less emphasis on agricultural practices and standards. Codes release after 1983 are concentrated in three areas o f building construction including fire safety, health and safety, and stm ctural sufficiency and are m ore involved w ith m atters o f occupational health and safety (safety railing requirem ents and ladders). 2.1.3 Environm ental Protection A ct (1971) Released in 1971, the E nvironm ental Protection A ct (EPA) (Bill 94) is the crown jew el o f environm ental legislation governing the protection o f the environm ent in Ontario. T he purpose o f the A ct is to provide for the protection and conservation o f the environment. Like the Flealth Protection and Prom otion A ct produced b y the M inistry o f Health (see section 2.1.1), the m ain role o f the EPA is to support for the im plem entation

10

o f m ore specialized regulations (such as the Waste M anagem ent R egulation, Regulation 347) that focus on a variety o f environm ental issues raised in the context o f the EPA.

D efinitions contained w ithin the EPA give the A ct its broad pow ers over several sectors o f th e environm ent, including agriculture. Like sim ilar acts o f its kind, specific topics such as pathogen abatem ent are covered explicitly, instead o f im plicitly. Several definitions cover the role o f application o f contam inants to land and the environm ent w hich broadly brush over several agricultural actions such as the u se o f biosolids and nutrients. For exam ple, 'contam inant ' is defined as; Any solid, liquid, gas, odour, heat, sound, vibration, radiation, or com bination o f any o f them present in the natural environm ent as a result, directly or indirectly o f the activities o f man. {Environmental Protection A ct, 1971, s. 1(c)) Similarly, the definition o f `p o llu tan f is given as; Any contam inant or combination o f contaminants p resen t in the natural environm ent or any p a r t th e reo f in excess o f the m aximum perm issible amount, concentration, or level prescribed by the regulations. {Environmental Protection Act, 1971, s. 1(1))

O f the m ore im portant sections with regards to nutrient containm ent is Section 15 (1) o f the Act, w hich states that; E very person who; (a) deposits in, adds, em its or discharges into p a rt o f the natural environment (b) is the person responsible fo r a source o f contaminants that deposits in, adds to, emit or discharges any p a rt to the natural environm ent... shall forthw ith notify the D epartm ent o f the deposit. Despite th e clause, it is stated in the EPA that subsection 1 (above) does n o t apply to waste disposed o f in accordance w ith normal farm practices (for further inform ation on `normal farm practices', see the Farm ing Food Production and Protection A ct, section 2.1.15). H ow ever, the Act could apply to actions w here `normal farm practices' are not applicable such as during events o f severe run-off into estuaries or deliberate well w ater pollution.

11

O f particular im portance to the EPA and its accom panying R egulations are Certificates ofiApprovals. Certificates o f Approval are m inistry-based contracts issued for specific endeavors requiring approval from the M inistry o f the Environm ent. Exam ples o f certificates pertaining to agriculture include w aste disposal and recycling and the application o f non-agricultural wastes to lands. F o r example, u n d er the Guide to Agricultural L a n d U se (see section 2.1.10), it is stated that the E nvironm ental Protection A ct requires that the prior approval o f sludge and septage utilization operations and application sites. This ensures that odour and w ater pollution are m inim ized and therefore prevents an excessive buildup o f a heavy m etals and other contam inants in the soil. Until the im plem entation o f the Ontario W ater Resources A ct (1990) and the N utrient M anagem ent A ct (2002), the EPA was the m ain source o f litigation fo r cases o f m alpractice in the agricultural sector. 2.1.4 Canada A nim al W aste M anagem ent Guide (1972) Produced b y the C anada C om m ittee on A gricultural Engineering, the Canada A nim al Waste Guide w as developed due m ostly to grow ing public concern o f environm ental pollution, large intensive livestock operations, and the increasing num ber o f residential dw ellings on or near farmland. The Guide assum ed that the eventual solution to w aste m anagem ent problem s would involve a balanced ecological system, m eaning that the application o f nutrients should be in balance w ith those rem oved by crops grown. The purpose o f the guide was to bring together the current practices that provided reasonable approaches to handling animal wastes. Reference legislation given in the Guide for the Province o f Ontario included the Environm ental P rotection A ct (1971), the W ater Resources Commission A ct (1956), and the Public H ealth Act.

T he Guide was the m ost com prehensive o f any publication released in reference to agricultural best m anagem ent practices and im plied scientific background and direction. M anure m anagem ent, utilization o f m anure in crop production, site selection, zoning and building construction, m anure handling system s, and processing o f animal wastes w ere discussed in the Guide.

T he `W ater P ollution' com ponent o f the Guide included pollution opportunities created in an agricultural operation. T he m ain w ater pollution hazards included inadequate storage facilities, w inter application on frozen soil, or excessively high rates

[

o f m anure on land.

T he Guide stated that m anure and/or its constituents can be carried overland into surface w ater supplies and w ould h e responsible for; (a) N itrate poisoning o f anim als and hum ans that drink contam inated w ater (b) T he transm ission o f certain diseases i f these disease-producing organism s are p resent in th e m anure (c) N utrient enrichm ent (eutrophication) and the resultant unsightly grow th o f algae and (d) Septic and unsightly conditions due to depletion o f the dissolved oxygen caused by the B O D o f the organic m aterial in m anure.

O dour and other nuisances such as noise continued to play a large role in the m anagem ent principles listed in the Guide. The principles included; (a) A ccess to sufficient land for crop utilization o f m anure and lim iting the rate and tim e o f application to avoid w ater pollution. (b) Separation betw een confined anim als and neighbours to avoid nuisance com plaints b y allow ing for the dilution o f unavoidable b am and feedlot odours and flies and dissipation o f noise. (c) F or household animals, frequent m anure rem oval from the b am into separate and undisturbed storage to m inim ize odour levels in the b am and avoid anim al and hum an exposure to gas hazards, particularly from stored liquid m anure. (d) Sufficient m anure-tight storage capacity to control surface w ater and groundw ater pollution and avoid land application o f m anure that m ay reach water. (e) R apid soil cover o f m anure to control odours during land spreading and control m anure w ashing from fields w hen surface m n o ff occurs. (Canada A nim al W aste M anagem ent G uide, 1972)

13

N itrogen m anagem ent w as a critical part o f the G uide. Inform ation on avoidance o f run o ff w aters and nitrogen balance applications was provided. Soil sam pling and analyses o f m anure w as encouraged. M ethods o f soil application included th e `plow dow n m eth o d ', w hich diverts m anure dow nw ard into a 4-foot sw ath w hile a second tractor follow s and pulls a plow slightly larger than the sw ath and covers the m anure in seconds. The second m ethod included soil injection, w hich, according to the G uide w as the m ore favorable m ethod as it `reduces odour to neighbouring com m unities'. Finally, m ethods o f treating the m anure w ere included in the Guide so that farm ers w ould have m ethods for reducing odours and w ater pollution. M ethods included dehydration, incineration, lagoons, and com posting. The G uide proved to be a benchm ark for future codes and guides since it is essentially the first piece o f legislation w hich identifies organism s as an im portant com ponent to anim al wastes. 2.1.5 A gricultural C ode o f Practice (1973) T h e A gricultural Code o f Practice took a significant step tow ards legitim izing best m anagem ent practices and bringing them together in a com plete code that other codes had failed to do such as the Canadian C ode for Farm B uildings. T he Code was released as a `cooperative action betw een farm ers, farm organizations, m unicipal officials, and a num ber o f m inistries o f the O ntario G overnm ent'. O f particular significance is the relationship betw een the Code and th e E nvironm ental P rotection A ct (1971). T he Codes practices w ere viewed as `b est m anagem ent p ractices' o f the day and therefore, any certificates o f approval granted by the M inistry o f the E nvironm ent had to have been consistent w ith the guidelines o f th e code.

K ey m easures are detailed in the C ode that could "m inim ize pollution problem s" included sufficient land area on which to spread m anure, sufficient m anure storage capacity to hold the m anure until it can be properly spread on the land at appropriate tim es, sufficient separation distances from livestock and poultry buildings and m anure storages to neighbouring dw ellings, m anagem ent guidance in keeping w ith existing know ledge on the storage, handling and use o f anim al m anures, and guidance for dead animal disposal.

14

U nlike the C anada A nim al W aste M anagem ent G uide, the C ode encouraged proactive m eans o f reducing nuisance problem s. F or exam ple, b u ffer zones w ere required to prevent livestock from accessing lo cal surface w aters and p o sin g a threat o f contam ination, to public w ater sources. The intensity o f odour from the b u ilding and the m anure storage capacity relates closely to separation distances. M anure could n o t be spread w ithin 600 feet o f a neighbouring hom e. Furtherm ore, the C ode stated that the objectionable effects o f odour in a neighbourhood could b e reduced i f livestock and poultry facilities w ere located as far as was practically possible from neighbouring facilities.

U nlike future codes and legislation, specific separation distances w ere provided from residential areas and roadw ays. O f significance w as the absence o f distances provided from w atercourses and w ellheads. T he follow ing distances w ere provided for new livestock and poultry buildings and m anure storage facilities; 1. A t least 2000 feet from land presently zoned for residential use 2. A t least 1000 feet from dw elling on adjacent property 3. A t least 300 feet from the center line o f any public road 4. A t least 200 feet from the lot lines o f the site on w hich the production u nit is situated.

A n im a l units were used in the Code for the first tim e in any legislation or policy, equating units for p articular species and providing specific units for each anim al. The origin A n im a l Units w as not defined in the Code. F urthennore, it is un clear how the

num ber o f acres w as determ ined for land application processes. T he 'm in im u m acreages' are those land requirem ents needed to avoid the risk o f groundw ater p o llu tio n by com pounds o f nitrogen. A ccording to the Code, it is expected that nutrients used on applicable land will be spread evenly on farm grounds. Soil type is b roken dow n into 2 categories o f spread m edia (based on percolation rates) including `L oam -to-C lay S oil', and secondly, `Sandy S oil'.

15

A ccording to the C ,

storage o f m anure piles w as expected to be in w atertight

·facilities so as to divert all uu.side drainage aw ay from feedlots b y dikes, ditches and drains. S torage facilities w ere to b e built so as to facilitate up to six m onths o f storage capacity. L iquid m anure system s w ere to b e used so as to b e incorporated into the soil as soon as p ossible and certainly w ith a 24-hour period. M ethods o f nutrient incorporation included plow -dow n or liquid m an u re injection. M anure spreading during th e spring and w inter m onths w as also discussed in the Code. It is stated that the greatest fertility value for m an u re is realized w hen m an u re is stored properly and incorporated into th e soil after spreading w hich w ill invariably reduces odour problem s and guard against runoff. W inter application w as discouraged, how ever not prohibited. The decision o f spread was ultim ately left up to the farm er to m ak e h is or h er best judgm ents.

In sum m ary, the Code leaves m uch to be desired in term s o f m icrobiological concerns in the agricultural fram ew ork o f the day. M anagem ent o f m anure w as viewed sim ply as a m eans o f reducing inconvenience to neighbouring com m unities. 2.1.6 A g ric u ltu ra l C o d e o f P ra c tic e (1976) T he second and final release o f the Code, the 1976 A gricultural Code o f Practice was a significant advance over its 1973 predecessor. T he 1976 code w as developed and based on the concept that all livestock m anure should be returned to the soil to grow crops. H ow ever, it w as em phasized that the land can safely accept only a lim ited am ount o f m anure w ithout increasing th e potential for w ater pollution and reduction in crop yields. Vkftiile the 1973 Code contained a fram ew ork for establishing and expanding livestock expansions, it provided little protection from the encroachm ent by other users o f the land. T he Code o f 1976 incorporated a num ber o f changes from the 1973 version by providing a `tw o -w ay ' approach to the m aintenance o f a strong livestock industry. A trend tow ards increasing m anure production, especially large production operations and storage increased th e dem and fo r a code, w hich accounted for the significant increase in m anure piles, especially in larger operations. Pollution concepts w ere addressed on several levels in th e 1976 edition o f the Code. In fact, th e goal w as to provide guidelines for livestock operations to m in im ize land, water, and air pollution potential. W ater pollution is addressed in the C ode w here it is noticeably absent in its previous edition.

16

There are several sim ilarities betw een th e two codes o f practices including the incorporation o f b u ffer zones, m anure storage capacity requirem ents, sufficient land availability, and th e use o f anim al units. H owever, several differences in th e Codes exist including the u se o f the M inim um Separation D istance F orm idae (M .D.S. I, II, and III). The M .D .S. form ulae w ere developed strictly for the separation distances required for the application and storage o f untreated m anures and to provide a consistent and fair technique to determ ine separation distances betw een non-com patible land uses. Prior separation distances failed to incorporate individual characteristics betw een farm s that m ight have led one farm w ith severe slope and perm eable soil to have a separation distance tw ice the length o f a farm w ith no slope and slow -perm eation soil characteristics.

M .D .S. Form ula I w as developed to determ ine the m inim um separation distance between other land uses such as residences establishing or expanding in close proxim ity to a livestock operation. M .D .S. F orm ula II w as used to determ ine the setback and separation distances betw een a new enlarged or rem odeled livestock facility and other non-com patible uses. Finally, M .D .S. Ill was used by agricultural engineers to determ ine the m inim um separation requirem ents fo r existing livestock setups not contem plating change o f operational or structural nature w here a Certificate o f Com pliance {Environmental P rotection Act, 1971) w ould have been required. A lthough it was not explained how th e form ulae w ere created, the follow ing factors w ere incorporated within the form ulae in o rder to determ ine corresponding distances and calculations including t)/pe o f livestock, num ber o f livestock, degree o f change, m anure system s, m anure storage, and type o f encroachm ent (in M .D .S. Form ulae I).

O ther differences betw een the two Codes included the ability o f the farm er to test his m anure to b e analyzed fo r nutrient content w here nutrients could be analyzed in 1976 and could not h av e been analyzed in 1973. In turn, recom m endations on nutrient use and nutrient application w ere m ade available to the farm er based on the inferred analysis o f m anure, soil type and type o f crop grow n from the M inistry o f A griculture. U nlike the 1973 Code, a n im al units are defined in the 1976 edition as ^the num ber o f that land o f

17

m

livestock that w ould pro d u ce 150-170 p o unds o f nitrogen in their m anure

This am ount

o f m anure is sufficient to provide the nitrogen fertilizer requirem ents fo r one acre o f com. A nim al units and rates o f livestock m anure application rem ain consistent in both Codes.

O dour issues w ere tackled often in the 1976 Code tlirough various avenues including application tim es, application conditions, proper design o f n ew buildings, m oisture content o f storage facilities, and taking m axim al advantage o f topographical and local clim atic conditions w hen spreading occurs. M anure storage facilities w ere expected to be constructed and m aintained based on the follow ing conditions; 1. Protection for ground and surface w ater 2. M inim um odour levels 3. Six m onths m inim um storage capacity to hold the m anure until it can be efficiently used on the land 4. Safety and security

5. M inim um nutrient losses during storage 6. Prevention and control o f disease in the building 7. M inim um storage w ithin the building

For the first tim e, m anure treatm ent m ethods w ere discussed. H ow ever, the treatm ent m ethods pertain m ore to the treatm ent o f hum an w astes as opposed to other w astes (animal w astes) on a farm setting. Sim ilar to several other practices contained w ithin th e Code, it was stated that usually "the main objective o f m anure treatm ent is odour co n tro l'. M ethods o f treatm ent include aeration and chem ical treatm ent, along w ith com posting, drying, and m anure lagoons.

Coliform bacteria and nitrates from m anure are listed as pollutants that can potentially contam inate both surface and ground w ater supplies. N itrates are a problem in drinking w aters since it can cause illness in hum ans at hig h concentrations including laboured breathing, rapid pulse, w eakness, diarrhea and even death. C onditions that could contribute to adverse w ater quality included run o ff from m anure spread on sloping frozen soil, physical soil erosion, direct ru n o ff from feedlots, and p o o rly constructed

18

m anure storages. The follow ing guidelines w ere provided in the Code as a m eans o f protecting w ater quality on farm s; 1. Spread m anure at specified rates (given by the M inistry) 2. W ork m anure into the ground w ithin 24 hours w here possible 3. Practice good land u se by reducing stream bank erosion, constructing grassed w aterw ays, and ploughing across slopes w here practical 4. D o not spread m anure on steeply sloping land, particularly during w inter or early spring, w hen there is essentially no crop cover 5. Prevent ru n o ff from feedlots and m anure piles 6. C onstruct concrete holding tanks and retaining walls 7. Prevent silage juices from reaching w ater supplies

The 1976 A gricultural Code o f Practice utilized new concepts com pared to its previous edition in 1973 such as soil testing and the utilization o f M .D.S formulae. B y including inform ation on site planning, the M .D .S form ulae, and m aking reference to the im portance o f the im pact o f agricultural practices on w ater quality, the Code would serve as an im portant docum ent for farmers for several years. 2.1,7 G uidelines for the Utilization of W aste (other than sewage sludge) on A gricultural land (1992) Prepared b y the Sludge and W aste U tilization Comm ittee under direction o f the Ontario M inistry o f the Environm ent, the Guidelines f o r the Utilization o f Waste (other than Sew age Sludge) 07i A gricultural Lands was produced for agricultural operations and m unicipalities w ho intended to apply wastes to their lands. The Guideline, produced under th e Enviroi^mental Protection A ct (1990), w as created to define the criteria which m ust b e m et before recycling and use o f suitable w aste on agricultural land could be considered. T he G uideline acted as a template for the 1996 Guidelmes fo r the Utilization o f B iosolids and other Wastes on Agricidtural Lands.

T he 1992 G uideline stressed that `all w aste (manures, biosolids) applied to agricultural land m ust have an acceptable low potential to generate odours and must contain acceptably low concentrations o f organism s pathogenic to m an or anim als'.

19

N uisances, especially odour concerns, remained a concern in the guideline w here spreading o f w astes should b e `no m ore objectionable than those arising from other norm al farm practices' (see section 2.1.15). O ther com ponents included in the analyses o f w astes included specified organic and inorganic w aste concentrations, including metals.

U nlike other G uidelines and Codes o f practice (such as the A gricultural Code o f Practice), tire G uideline provided general separation distances for all w astes. Distances, soil criteria, and w aiting periods w ere evaluated on a `case-by-case b asis' w here significant pathogenic loads w ere found in the waste. O f particular significance to this study is th e im plem entation o f separation distances based on soil perm eability and slope o f land. D espite setback distance, spreading m ust have been suspended w here ru n o ff was suspected and w here ground w as snow-covered or frozen. 2.1.8 The Guidelines for Sew age Sludge Utilization on A gricultural Lands (1992) A product o f the liaison betw een provincial M inistries and Federal departments m aking up the Sludge and W aste U tilization Com m ittee, the Guidelines f o r Sewage Sludge Utilization on A gricultural Lands (1992) were w ritten to address the concerns o f the potential environm ental and health im pacts o f sewage sludge utilization. The Guide was supported b y research w hich (was) ongoing from 1971 to 1992. Tlie purpose o f the guidelines was to facilitate the recycling and use o f sew age sludge on land while protecting the quality o f food, the health o f consumers, and the quality o f the environi' l; .1 The G uidelines supplem ented Regulation 309 (`Processed O rganic W aste R egulation') o f the Environm ental Protection A ct (1990).

M u ch like the Guideline f o r the Utilization o f Waste (except Sew age Sludge) on Land, the G uideline contained setback distances from surface w ater tables (0.9 meters), bedrock (1.5 m eters), drilled w ells m ore than 15 m eters deep (15 m eters), all other wells including dug wells (90 m eters) and residential areas (450 meters) (section 5.1.1). Setback distances could be increased depending on soil perm eability o f the subsurface environm ent. Soil criteria pertaining to spreading sites included reference to organic soils, m etal concentrations o f soils, soil pH, soil tests and avoidance o f sew age

20

application to snow or frozen covered ground. A ccording to the Guideline, the m axim um depth o f fluid sew age w hich m ay be spread at any one tim e w as 1.3 cm. Furtherm ore, no further application o f any nutrient could be applied until the first application had dried. As will be shown in section 2.1.7, the G uideline acted as a supplem ent to the Guidelines fo r the Utilization o f Biosolids and other wastes on A gricultural land w hich w ere released 4 years later in 1996. 2.1.9 Ontario Environm ental Farm Plan (1993). A program sponsored in part by the M inistry o f A griculture and Food, ; Environm ental Farm Plans (EFP) w ere docum ents voluntarily prepared by farm ing families to increase their awareness o f the environm ent on their farm. Through the EFP '
I

process, farmers w ho enlisted in the program would highlight environm ental strengths on their farm, `identify areas o f environm ental concern, and set realistic goals and tim e tables to im prove environm ental conditionsh A voluntary program , farmers who wished

I

to participate in the program were encouraged to com plete a self-assessm ent o f their farm, develop an action plan depending on their environm ental concerns and subm it their

1

plans to a peer-review com mittee and finally, im plem ent the plan.

Issues o f environmental concern include w ater well safety, fertilizer handling and ^ !
I

storage, storage o f agricultural wastes, soil m anagem ent, soil use and m anagem ent, and several other best m anagem ent practices shared by the agricultural com munity, including the M inistry o f A griculture and Food. The Farm Plan is quite sim ilar to the concept o f the N utrient M anagem ent Flan that is to be created by all agricultural operations under the N utrient M anagem ent A ct (2002). However, the Farm Plan was only shared w ith a

I ^

!
i

peer-review com m ittee and therefore, the m unicipality or province did not becom e involved. Environm ental farm plans w ere essentially abolished when m unicipal by-laws and the N utrient M anagem ent Act required that nutrient m anagem ent plans becom e m andatory for every agricultural operation. 2.1.10 Guide to A gricultural Land U se (1995) R eleased in 1995 by the Ontario M inistry o f A griculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the Guide to A gricultural L and Use and the M inimum D istance Separation (M DS) I and

II were the successors to the 1976 A gricultural Code o f Practice. Taken together, they formed a tw o-pronged approach to reducing land use conflicts in rural areas. Sim ilar to previous legislation and guides, the Ginde to Agricidtural L a n d Use addressed issues that " sometimes arise betw een agriculture and other land uses in the Ontario countryside'"'. It advised farm ers on how to avoid or reduce conflicts w ith neighbours and environm ental im pacts through the u se o f appropriate farm practices and equipment. The booklet set out the guidelines to create a totally inoffensive environm ent im m ediately adjacent to some agricultural facilities. U nlike several acts, regulations, codes and guidelines before it, the Guide to A gricultural L and Use m ade it clear to non-farm residents that "those w ho make the choice to accept the advantages o f country life m ust be prepared to accept the noise, odour, and dust associated w ith nonmal farm practices" .

Topics integrated in the Guide included, the use o f livestock m anure and other organic residuals, m anure m anagem ent, protection o f w ater quality, noise, and dead animal disposal. Tlie Guide contained advice on avoiding the potential for conflict between neighbouring land uses tlirougli appropriate approved developm ent and contained inform ation so that farmers could gain insight into the concerns o f rural residents about agriculture. The Gidde provided recom m endations for m anure m anagem ent issues such as storage and application o f manure. M uch like the 1976 Agriculture Code o f Practice, the Guide focused on issues involved in the m anagem ent and use o f m anure (and other organic residues), the protection o f w ater quality, dead animal disposal, and noise reduction strategies.

As the Guide was used in conjunction with MDS 1 and 11 formulae, the Guide utilized all recom m ended setback distances calculated in the fo rm u la e based on

anim al units and livestock units. The Guide suggested that all m anure should be applied in accordance with o. N utrient M anagem ent Plan. A ccording to the Guide, a 'Nutrient M anagem ent Plan is a w ritten plan o f action to handle m anure in a w ay that does not harm the environm ent. D etailed nutrient m anagem ent plans included m anure nutrient testing, safe application rates, crop nutrient needs, area required for application.

22

appropriate reductions in commercial fertilizer applications and em ergency actions in case o f spills or system failures.

T he Guide also m entioned that w hile crops benefit from m anure, problem s could arise i f it is im properly handled and used including crop damage, w ater pollution, and excessive odour. Furtherm ore, the Guide stated that when high m anure application rates w ere used, groundw ater could be contaminated by bacteria and nitrogen, and surface w ater could be contam inated b y bacteria, nutrients, toxic levels o f ammonia, suspended solids and organic m aterials. As a result, the Guide suggested that w ater testing take place at least once p e r year.

Land spreading is governed not only by the setback distances provided by the M D S 1 and 11 form ulae but also general separation distances. For example, according to the Guide, `if solid m anure is spread closer than 200 meters to an incom patible use, it should be incorporated into the soil within 24 hours'. Recom m ended application m ethods (waste spreading systems) were provided with options for agricultural industries. A ccording to the Guide, o v er-ap p licatio n o f liquid m anure `should be avoided to prevent ponding and possible leaching to drainage tiles...reg u lar checking o f tile discharge for polluted w ater is recom mended during liquid m anure spreading'. The Gidde recom m ended tlrat `if a problem is identified, stop spreading m anure and prevent the contaminated tile from leaving the fann. Storage requirements were m ade based on several environm ental factors including protection for groundw ater and surface water, m inim izing odour levels, storage periods o f at least 200 days, m inim izing nutrient losses during storage and handling, and prevention and control o f disease in the building

Term s new to the Guide included the use o f suspended and dissolved m aterials as they relate to w ater quality and soil erosion. Grassed buffer zones (5 m eters) were recom m ended to reduce the amount o f suspended and dissolved solids in lakes and nearby streams. It is obvious that som e research came to bear on the Guide as its recom m endations and best m anagem ent practices clearly show.

23

A ccording to the Guide, environm ental effects o f im proper m anure application included crop damage, w ater pollution, and excessive odour. W hen high m anure application rates w ere used by farm ers, the Guide stated that "groundw ater can be contam inated by bacteria and nitrogen, and surface w ater can be contam inated b y bacteria, nutrients, toxic levels o f am m onia, suspended solids and organic m aterials" . Farmers applying sewage sludge and septage w ere referred to the G uidelines fo r Sewage Sludge Utilization on A gricultural Lands (1996). D espite the GmWe'5 recom m endations for setbacks for nuisance purposes, it is the incorporation o f the MDS I and II form ulae and incorporation o f setback distances that m ade the Guide unique. 2.1.11 M inim um Separation D istances (M DS I and II) (1995). Released in 1995 from the M inistiy o f Agir culture and Rural A ffairs and the M inistry o f Environm ent and Energy, the M inim um Separation D istance (M DS) formula provided distance separation requirem ents betw een existing farms and new com m unity developments. In other w ords, the MDS was a tool to determ ine the distance between a livestock facility and another land use. M DS I and II replaced the M inim um Separation Form ula I in the A gricultural Code o f Practice (1976). The objective o f M DS w as to prevent land use conflicts and m inim ize nuisance com plaints from odour. M inim um separation distances will vary in length according to a num ber o f variables including type o f livestock, size o f the farm operation, type o f m anure system, and the form o f developm ent (present or proposed).

M DS I provided m inim um separation distances from existing facilities for new development, while M DS II provided m inim um separation distances from existing or approved development. M DS I calculated a separation distance based on either the actual housing capacity or potential capacity according to tillable hectares (m axim um 150 Livestock Units). M DS I was applied in any non-urban designation w here agricultural practices along with the housing o f livestock is perm itted while MDS II was based more on the com munity setting w here nuisances (odour) m ay be o f significance. O ne o f the main purposes o f the M DS program was to incorporate them into official plans and local legislation such as m unicipal by-law s. It was recom m ended in the M DS I docum ent that

24

the form ulae w ere to be used not b y them selves, but in conjunction w ith `good farm practices'.

O f particular significance to the M DS formulae and this section are the incorporation o f A n im a l Groups and Livestock units. Anim als Groups w ere defined as "livestock and poultry grouped according to their m anure production" . A livestock unit was defined as " equivalent values for various types o f animals and poultry based on m anure production and production cycles" . Based on values obtained from both the animal grouping and the livestock units w hich are given to the particular group, a manure setback distance w as provided. H ow ever, inform ation o f the origin o f hoXfx A nim al Groups and for L ivestock units is unavailable in the package. Furtherm ore, lack o f studies and research pertaining to the effectiveness o f `unit-based' systems only adds to the uncertainty o f the MDS system. 2.1.12 B est M anagem ent Practices for Farmers -A gricultural Canada (1995) O riginally produced in 1995 by the Ontario Federation o f A griculture and A griculture and A gri-Food Canada, the series o f `best m anagem ent practices' documents were released to assist farmers in stream lining agricultural practices at the fan n level. O f particular im portance to this study was the release o f Nutrient M anagem ent Practices and Livestock and Waste M anagem ent Practices. N utrient additions and rem ovals played an important role in the nutrient m anagem ent booklet. Exam ples o f factors contributing to nutrient additions to land include heavy rainfall events, feeds and bedding, nitrogen fixation, fertilizer and organic m aterial additions. N utrient removals include, erosion, livestock, crops, leaching and gaseous emissions.

A pplication o f biosolid m aterial on land is based on the Giddelines f o r the Utilization o f Biosolids and Other Wastes. Factors to consider in site approval provided by the booklet included soil tests for phosphorus, soil pH, slope o f field, soil organic m atter content, natural soil drainage, soil m oisture content, snow cover and frost, and distance to w ells, w ater table, w atercourses, bedrock, or hom es.

25

A ccording to th e nutrient m anagem ent booklet, biosolids `contain some undesirable com ponents like m etals and m ay contain pathogenic organism s and other inorganic and organic com pounds'. A nutrient management program approach is used similarly in nutrient m anagem ent plans and nutrient m anagem ent strategies found in the N utrient M anagem ent Act. It is obvious (based on current literature and literature

available in the 1990s) that som e scientific know ledge has com e to b ear on the nutrient m anagem ent section o f best m anagem ent practices since m icrobial considerations are m ade in land application m ethods and planning.

First printed in 1992, the L ivestock and Poultry Waste M anagem ent best m anagem ent practices were developed to provide inform ation to producers who w ere considering changing the w ay that m anure was managed on their farms. T he book exam ined the environm ental risks associated with poor w aste m anagem ent along with other practical problem s and solutions m any farmers m ay have experienced. M icrobiological com ponents described in the booklet relate to the application o f m anure products and potential pollution problem s that may include coliform bacteria and nitrate nitrogen which can contam inate w ater supplies (and contribute to eutrophication) and include pathogenic bacteria that can cause disease in hum ans and livestock. R u n o ff o f liquids rem ains an im portant issue in the w aste m anagem ent booklet. M ethods o f m anure treatment w ere also included to provide alternative solutions to land use such as utilizing m anure for energy purposes. 2.1.13 Guidelines for the U tilization o f Biosolids and other wastes on A gricultural land (1996). A jo in t venture betw een the M inistry o f the Environm ent and the M inistry o f A griculture and R ural A ffairs, the G iddelines fo r the Utilization o f Biosolids and other Wastes on A gricultural L and (1996) w as developed to protect enviroranental quality, consum er and anim al health, food quality and the productivity o f the land. The Guidelines w ere developed to facilitate Regulation 347 (The Waste M anagem ent Regidation) under the Environm ental Protection A ct which was designed to control the types o f w astes applied to agricultural lands. The docum ent outlines criteria w hich m ust be met before biosolids, or other w aste materials could be considered for use on

26

agricultural land. A ccording to the Guide, m aterials applied to land m ust benefit and prom ote the grow th o f crops and not degrade th e natural environm ent.

The G uideline discusses several item s relating to m aterial application, including potentially desirable and undesirable constituents, spreading rates pertaining to sewage biosolids, separation distances, soil criteria, w aste m aterial handling and spreading along w ith responsibilities and rights. Sam pling o f soil and sew age biosolids is required b y the Guideline. Soil sam pling incorporates testing fo r chem ical properties along w ith soil pH and m etal, lime and nitrogen requirem ents for crops. Sew age biosolids are required to be treated and stabilized prior to spread on land. Standard separation distances are provided in the Guideline fo r both regular circum stances and special circum stances w here low soil perm eability and sustained slope are a concern. Separation distances are provided for application distances from groundw ater tables (0.9 m eters), surface w ater courses (10 meters), bedrock (1.5 m eters deep), drilled w ells m ore than 15 m deep (15 m eters), all other wells (90 m eters), individual residences (90 m eters), and residential areas (450 m eters). Since the 1992 release o f the G uidelines fo r Sewage Sludge Utilization on Agricultural Lands, the separation distances have not changed. In fact, the two
I

G uidelines are very sim ilar sighting identical setback distances along w ith sim ilar best m anagem ent practices for handling, holding and spreading o f biosolids.

I [ It is clear that the focus o f the G uideline is the threat o f overexposure to and abatem ent o f m etals in the soil and w atercourses since biosolids have traditionally had high metal concentrations depending on their source. N evertheless, key pathogen abatem ent strategies are provided b y the G uideline w hich have a significant effect o f I I j I f ( i reducing the introduction o f accom panying organism s to the soil. 2.1.14 Ontario B uilding C ode A ct (1992), T he O ntario B u ilding Code (1997). Supportive legislation for the Ontario B uilding Code, the Ontario Building Code Act, provides authority for the establishm ent and enforcem ent o f an Ontario building code (Toombs, 1992). T he A ct (along with the Canadian Code fo r Farm Buildings), applies to the construction, alteration or dem olition o f farm structures, including m anure storages (Toom bs, 1992). O bviously, a correlation can be m ade betw een the

27

m alfunctioning o f faulty septic system s and the eontam ination o f w ell w ater on private and publie property. Separation distances are given in the code depending on w hat type o f system is installed on the property. N o reference is provided to interpret separation distances n o r is any explanation given o f their origin. 2.1.15 F arm ing Food Production Protection A ct (1998) R eleased in 1998 b y the Ontario M inistry o f A griculture, Food and R ural A ffairs, the F arm ing F ood P roduction P rotection A ct "provides protection from nuisance com plaints o f odour, noise, and dust to farm ers carrying out norm al farm practices" (Toom bs, 1992). T he FFPPA provides stronger protection fo rn u isan ces and broadens the definition o f w hat constitutes a farm ing operation. `R ight-to-farm ' legislation arose from several key factors including increasing urban sprawl and a rise in large-scale industrial agricultural productions. A lthough m anagem ent o f nutrients is n o t m entioned, the A ct does refer to an " agricultural operation" to include practices w ithin the operation such as th e application o f fertilizers and soil conditioners on the land. U n d er the FFPPA , a norm al fa rm pra ctice is a practice that; (a) is conducted in a m anner consistent w ith p ro p er and acceptable custom s and standards as established and fo llo w e d by sim ilar agricidtural operations under sim ilar circum stances, or (b) m akes use o f innovative technology in a m anner consistent w ith p ro p e r advanced fa r m m anagem ent practices. {Farm ing Food P roduction Protection A ct, 1998, s. 1).

T he Act has little significance on the environm ental im pacts o f the farm practices perform ed b y the local farm er.

2.1.16 T h e N utrien t M anagem ent A ct (2002) A s part o f the governm ent o f O ntario's Clean W ater Strategy, the N utrient M anagem ent A c t (NM A) provides for province-w ide standards to address th e effects o f agricultural practices on the environm ent, especially as they relate to land applied materials containing nutrients. The purpose o f the O ntario N u trien t M anagem ent A c t is to provide for the m anagem ent o f m aterials containing nutrients in w ays that w ill enhance the protection o f the natural environm ent. N utrient M an a g em en t P lans (N M Ps) and Nutrient M anagem ent Strategies (N M Ss) are used to attem pt to control how nutrients are

29

applied to land b y individual farm locations. B oth N M P s and N M S s are quite sim ilar to the plans and strategies once used in local m unicipal bylaw s. H ow ever, the N u trien t M anagem ent A ct addresses th e variability o f m urhcipal N M P s and N M S s and requires that all agricultural operations follow one tem plate for plans and strategies in the A ct so that all operations are sim ilar in content versus m unicipal nutrient plans and strategies w hich w ere different depending on th e location and requirem ents o f the local governm ent. N utrient m anagem ent plans and nutrient m anagem ent strategies require active participation and involvem ent from both the nutrient producer and th e m unicipalit)' w here th e nutrient presides.

A nutrient m anagem ent plan (N M P) is a docum ent that provides th e details regarding the m anagem ent o f m aterials containing nutrients that m ay be applied to agricultural lands. T he plan is specific to the fan n and the nutrients used on th e land. A plan is done for an entire farm unit and will contain all fields receiving nutrients. Included in all N M P 's are a w ritten descriptions o f the farm , any leases or agreem ents w ith oth er farms, a contingency plan fo r any em ergency's, a site plan o f all storage basins and structures, livestock num bers, anim al w eights, field sk etch 's, feed additives used, land availability fo r spreading, m anure application rates and m ethods, and annual m anure volum e produced ( if any) p e r year. A lso include in the p lan are soil and m an u re tests which are required to be p erfo n n ed every 3 years or w henever changes are m ade to the NM P.

A n u tn e n t m anagem ent strategy (NM S) is a docum ent that m ust be com pleted by all m unicipalities as well as generators o f nutrients. T he purpose o f the N M S is to provide an overall picture o f the destination and characteristics o f the nutrients generated to ensure that they are m anaged appropriately. C om ponents o f N M S include a contingency plan, location m aps o f storage and w ater-w ays, a site plan, m inim um distance separation calculations based on upcom ing regulations, lists o f quantity and types o f all nutrients generated or received, analysis o f nutrient content and quality, docum entation verifying feed additives effects as well as m ethods o f disposal o f nutrients

30

(other than land applying). T he N M S acts as a second set o f eyes on the farrn so as to ensure th at the N M P is b ein g m anaged effectively.

It is w ell know n that m any o f the nutrients generated b y farm ers, including organic m aterials, m anure, septage, and com post, harbour organism s that can be pathogenic to h um an health. H owever, although m any o f the nutrients u sed on lands are well know n for th e existence o f pathogenic organism s, the N utrient M anagem ent A ct never once m entions the term 'pathogen' or `m icroorganism '.

T he A ct is consistent w ith the W alkerton Inquiry R eport w hich envisioned a nutrient m anagem ent strategy that w ould protect soil and w ater resources w hile sustaining agricultural industry growth. The Act reaffirm s ultim ate authority to the Environm ental P rotection A c t (section 2.1.3), the Ontario W ater R esources A ct (A ppendix 2.2) and the Pesticides A ct (A ppendix 2.2). K ey to the legislative fram ew ork are N utrient M anagem ent Plans (NM Ps) and N utrient M anagem ent Strategies (NM Ss) w hich are `science based to o ls' that use best m anagem ent practices to m anage nutrients in an environm entally responsible m anner. T he Ontario M inistry o f A griculture and Food (OM AF) and the O ntario M inistry o f the Environm ent (O M O E) are jointly responsible for the A ct w here the M inistry o f the Environm ent is responsible fo r enforcem ent and the M inistry o f A griculture for policy developm ent.

Tire N u trien t M anagem ent A ct attem pts to reduce nutrient inputs to soil and w aterw ays by m anaging agricultural practices and im plem enting best m anagem ent practices and reducing the concentration o f nitrogen and phosphorus in nutrients applied to soil. The N utrient M anagem ent A ct m inistry protocols set out several specific spreading provisions including restriction o f w inter application o f nutrients {Nutrient M anagem ent A ct, 2002, s. 8(2)) as stated in the regulation. A lthough the protocol never states so, restricting w inter application o f nutrients prevents an excess o f nutrients from leaching into receiving bodies o f w ater and th e soil during spring run-off. H owever, animal health, grazing, and food source protection are not m entioned in th e A ct or its protocols. These gaps address pre-application strategies that aid in m icrobial load

31

1

reductions to soils. F o r exam ple, restriction o f grazing anim als on recen tly treated land (w ith m anure) is an effective m eans o f reducing contam ination o f younger herds o f anim als w ith pathogens.

T he A ct also tackles ''^intermediate operations" including com posting (s. 1(1)) and anaerobic digestion. T he tw o m ethods are well know n for their ability to reduce bacterial load in nutrients. Pertinent to other N utrient M anagem ent plans across C anada and in other international jurisdictions, the Ontario N utrient M anagem ent Plan includes standards for m axim um setback distances, separation from w atercourses and m inim um depth to groundw ater o r bedrock. Farm ers are expected to take into account landscape w ater table variations and seasonal fluctuations in w ater level in order to protect the drinking w ater source.

T he N utrient M anagem ent A ct tends to sw ay on the side o f b eing preventative w hereas acts dealing w ith sim ilar issues pertaining to w ater quality {Ontario Water R esources Act) are reactive statutes. Pathogen m anagem ent is dealt w ith indirectly in the N utrient M anagem ent A c t as was observed in previous pieces o f provincial environm ental legislation. T he A ct differs from previous legislation because it encom passes all aspects o f nutrient control w here other governm ent docum ents w ere not as inclusive in their scope.

2.2 Discussion - Pathogen Abatement and Nutrient Management in Ontario
The study o f the history o f nutrient m anagem ent and pathogen control legislation in Ontario is a com plex task which helps to identify how the N utrient M anagem ent A ct w as constructed. Landm ark periods o f nutrient m anagem ent legislation can clearly be observed in the periods o f the 1970s and the 1990s (see A ppendix 2.1), w here m ore than 25 provincial docum ents w ere developed. The reason for the fury o f activity w ithin these two decades is unclear. H ow ever, it is assumed that there was an obvious need for legislation and guidance in the agricultural industry during those periods.

32

f

U p until th e early 1970s, the science governing nutrient m anagem ent issues had little, if any effect on the legislative m akeup o f the province o f O ntario's nutrient m anagem ent and pathogen abatem ent initiatives. W ithout dim inishing th e significance o f earlier A cts such as the P ublic H ealth A ct (1873) and the Well D rillers A c t (1924) (see A ppendix 2.2), landm ark docum ents paved the w ay fo r the developm ent o f future provincial initiatives such as the 1976 Guide to A gricultural Land Use and th e 1992 Guidelines fo r Sew age Sludge Utilization on A gricultural Lands w hich obviously incorporated som e scientific research. A shift in hierarchical legislative significance is observed from voluntary, inform ation based codes and guidelines (which hold no significant legislative w eight unless adopted by acts or regulations) during the 1970's to the acts and regulations o f the 1990's and early part o f 2000. Furtherm ore, as science evolved over the past 30 years, an increasing num ber o f best m anagem ent practices w ere observed. H ow ever, it is difficult to validate the practices required by m uch o f the legislation since no experim ental data supports m any o f the requirem ents such as setback distances and application m ethods. This is not to suggest that setback distances and application rates w ere n o t protective (on the other hand, they could be over protective). However, since local contam ination events continue to occur across the province and because b est m anagem ent practices have not been supported by science, it is hypothesized that such regulated and recom m ended units could potentially be based on the `best professional judgm ents' o f legislators w ho create legislation at the provincial or federal level.

T he follow ing sections highlight several key issues in the m anagem ent o f nutrients based on their developm ents in previous legislation and docum ents. 2.2.1 O dour O dour is a prom inent issue in nutrient m anagem ent legislation that m ay have been the prim ary reason for the developm ent o f several pieces o f literature developed both by the Province and the Federal governm ent since 1885. Earlier guidelines and recent legislation tackle aspects o f odour, and m ore specifically nuisances related to the practices o f farm s. O f consequence to farming com m unities, odour w as (and still is) o f particular im portance to farm s w hich border housing com m unities. D espite obvious

strategies to reduce and avoid instances o f nuisance, m any practices indirectly had positive im pacts on reducing health hazards. For example, the 1973 A gricultural Code o f Practice advises against the spread o f nutrients during the w inter and w hen ground is frozen to reduce odour problem s and guard against runoff. It is well established that w inter spread (especially w hen applied on snow) m ay lead to excessive ru n o ff and possibly leaching into w atercourses. A lthough it is never established clearly in the Code, the practice indirectly guards against nuisances and pathogens.

It is not until the release o f th e M inim um D istance Separation Guides 1 and 11 (see section 2.1.11) that a shift in focus from nuisances to nutrient m anagem ent is observed. For example, the M DS I Guide states that the prim ary purpose o f the docum ent `should be for agriculture'. Furtherm ore, the Guide states that `non-farm residents w ho seek the advantages o f country life m ust be aw are o f the noise, odour, and dust associated with normal farm p ractices'.

A fter the release o f the FFPPA (see section 2.1.15) in 1998, the trend tow ards creating legislation pertaining to nuisance m anagem ent declined and an increase in environm ental aw areness and protection legislation was observed. Local advisory com m ittees and local by-law enforcem ent agencies (as opposed to Provincial officials) addressed issues o f nuisance (sm ells, noise, dust) along w ith other problem s relating to `normal farm practices'. 2.2.2 W a te r Q u ality T he standardization o f private w ater quality aided in the creation o f current source w ater protection legislation. Acts released by the M inistry o f the Environm ent such as the Safe D rinking Water A ct (2002) and the Ontario Water Resources A ct (1990) could not have been possible w ithout w ater testing technology that requirem ents w ithin these Acts com m ands. D espite this, several pieces o f legislation tackled the issue o f w ater quality long before scientific equipm ent and technology was available. F or exam ple, the Well D rillers A c t (1924) (see A ppendix 2.2) requires that all abandoned w ells should be capped so as to keep all w ater in its place o f origin and to prevent any fresh or salt w ater or other injurious substances from entering... {Well D rillers A ct, 1924, s. 9(1)). Several

34

other exam ples o f generalized sections in legislation regulating safe drinking w ater and protection o f source w ater include the Ontario W ater R esources Com m ission A ct (1956) and the Public H ealth A ct (1873). The Ontario W ater Resources Com m ission Act required that the com m ission `develop and make available supplies o f w ater and to construct and operate systems for the supply, purification and distribution o f w ater and for the disposal o f sew age' (Ontario W ater Resources Com m ission Act, 1956, s. 10(a),(b)). N ot until the 1960s and 1970s do specific practices regulating drinking w ater safety and source protection begin to surface in legislation and other publications. Inform ation leaflets published by the Ontario D epartm ent o f A griculture and Food (1966) advise farm ers to avoid application o f nutrients in areas w ith a high w ater table.

The release o f the Environm ental Protection A ct (1971) had significant im pacts in source w ater protection by prohibiting the release o f substances to the natural environm ent that m ay cause `adverse effects'. Several publications including the 1973 and 1976 editions o f the Agriculture Codes o f Practice m ake reference to the Environm ental Protection A ct and the M inistry o f the Environm ent as sources o f ultim ate authority in agriculture and w ater related issues. Exam ples o f w ater quality protection contained in the A griculture Code o f Practice (1973, 1976) included setback distances regulating nutrient application from well caps and w atercourses, control o f surface runoff, surface application rates, restriction o f animal access to waterways, and building construction standardization.

The 1990s proved to be a significant decade for the creation and standardization o f w ater quality legislation. Legislation was created not only at the provincial level, but also at the m unicipal level w here local by-laws tackled local w ater quality and nutrient m anagem ent issues such as m inim um setback distances, im plem entation o f nutrient m anagem ent plans, establishing wellhead protection areas, and construction requirem ents for new bam s. The release o f the Ontario Water Resources Act {] 992) com bines several factions o f w ater quality and safety resources including issues o f w ater protection, abstraction, treatm ent and control.

The 1997 release o f the Ontario B uilding Code addressed hom eow ner sewage treatm ent and setback distances from w ater sources and percolation rates. The Guide w as used for several years as a reference for public health departments for setback distance questions and for on-site sewage system approval. M inim um separation distances w ere addressed in the 1992 G uidelines fo r the Utilization o f Waste (other than sew age sludge) on Agricultural Lands along w ith the G uidelines f o r Sewage Sludge Utilization (1992). 2.2.3 Setback/Separation D istances and M DS I & II First released in 1973 in A gricultural Code o f Practice, setback distances were

originally used for the construction o f new m anure storage facilities to reduce odour complaints to neighbouring com munities. D istance requirem ents w ere provided for setbacks from residences, public roads and lot lines. Prior to the release o f setbacks distances, land use requirem ents w ere required to ensure the farm operation had sufficient land for the amount o f nutrients they w ere was producing.

N ot until the release o f the 1976 Code o f Practice (where setback distances and the incorporation o f the M DS I and II form ulae) did environmental quality issues com e to bare on m anure m anagem ent and w ater quality. A ccording to the Code o f Practice, the M DS formulae w ere developed to provide a consistent and fair technique to determ ine separation distances betw een non-com patible uses. Althougli non-com patible uses included sim ilar structures and landm arks as the 1973 code (nearest neighbour, com m ercially designated structures), the form ulae still incorporated relatively new tecliniques such as the use o f A nim al Units to differentiate one farm 's operation from another (depending on how mQx\y A nim al Units w ere produced on that farm). A ccording to the 1976 Code, A n im a l Unit System was developed to equate livestock num bers to

the nitrogen content o f the m anure produced w hile those animals w ere on the fan n '. A lthough it is unclear how the units w ere created, it was a relatively new concept in the nutrient m anagem ent that w ould later be follow ed in the 1995 M ininium D istance Separation Guide albeit using L ivestock Units.

2.2.4 M anure Storage Storage o f nutrients and application frequencies have been included as im portant topics in several publications pertaining to nutrient m anagem ent. Earlier publications from the Ontario D epartm ent o f Agriculture and Food (1966) (ODAF) advised farmers that the num ber o f m onths that m anure m ust be held (prior to land application) could depend on the field-cropping program associated with the livestock enterprise. However, to conserve and obtain m axim um utilization o f the plant nutrients in the liquid m anure and to avoid possible pollution o f surface w ater supplies due to run o ff from manure-laden m elting snow, it was recom m ended that the planned holding period be six m onths (ODAF, 1966).

T he 1976 Code o f Practice also recom m ended a six-m onth m inim um storage capacity to hold the m anure until it can be effectively used on the land. N o explanation o f why a six-m onth period to store nutrients is provided. However, the 1995 release o f the Gidde to A gricultural L a n d Use requires a storage period o f 200 days (roughly 5.5 to 6 m onths) w ith 250 days recom m ended for optimum flexibility so as to ensure that the manure can be effectively stored and used on the land. A ccording to the Guide, the choice o f the most appropriate system is based on m oisture content o f the m anure and the location o f the storages in relation to streams, w atercourses, wells, neighbours and roads. A fter the release o f the Guide to Agricultural Land Use in 1995, no publications were released m andating m inim um manure storage tim es for optimum application rates. However, nutrient m anagem ent plans and by-laws in Ontario after 1997 referenced the Guide along w ith the MDS system for storage requirem ents until the release o f the N utrient M anagem ent Act in 2002.

2.3 Nutrient Management Policy and Pathogen Control
T he relationship between nutrient m anagem ent policy and pathogen and nutrient control w as exam ined b y Stiefelm eyer (2003). It was shown that nutrient m anagem ent policies, including the N utrient M anagem ent A ct cannot adequately control pathogens in agricultural environments because pathogens (w ith the exception o f som e viruses) are transported differently than sedim ents and nutrients and therefore, legislation designed to

37

control pathogens and in particular, bacteria would be ineffective. Specifically, vegetated buffer zones, tillage practices and land application requirem ents w ere found to b e insufficient at controlling pathogen transport in the subsurface environm ent based on research from A twill et al. (2002), Entry et al. (2000), Coyne et al. (1995), Fenlon et al. (2000), and Ogden et al. (2001) am ong others. A nalysis o f research focusing specifically on E. coli 0157;H7, Salm onella, Giardia, and O y p lo sp o n d iu m showed that these patliogens could rem ain viable w hen applied to agricultural surfaces. Tlie survivability o f pathogenic organism s further enhances their ability to b e transported in the subsurface environment. As research has progressed, it has becom e clearer that pathogens can remain viable under stressed environm ental conditions and therefore, legislation designed specifically for pathogen control is required. Furtherm ore, a pathogen control strategy is required which accounts for differences in environm ental conditions and physicalchemical differences o f m icrobiological make-up.

Further analysis o f international nutrient m anagem ent policy showed that the majority o f policies, like the O ntario N utrient M anagem ent A ct do not address critical pathogen control issues such as herd health, biosecurity issues and treatm ents used during storage that could aid in pathogen load reduction. Such gaps in policy point to the need for further m icrobial transport studies so that legislation is supported by sound research.

2.4 Conclusion
Scientific research should influence the requirem ent and im plem entation for effective legislation in all areas o f scientific research including nutrient m anagem ent so that agricultural practices are m anaged, w ater quality is protected, and pathogen abatement tlirough soil to w atercourses is controlled.

The history o f the Province o f O ntario's nutrient m anagem ent legislation has deep roots in several M inistry's including the M inistry o f A gii culture and Food, the M inistry o f the Environm ent, the M inistry o f Housing, the M inistry o f M ines, the M inistry o f Health, the M inistry o f Natural Resources, and the M inistry o f Energy and R esource M anagement. Com bined, since 1873, the province has developed over 34 docum ents

38

pertaining to nutrient m anagem ent, w ater quality, and the protection o f the environm ent from pathogens and various other substances. M any o f the nutrient m anagem ent initiatives review ed in this chapter have inadvertently acted to protect source w aters by controlling for nuisances stem m ing from agricultural practices and operations. The developm ent o f th e N utrient M anagem ent A ct w as clearly supported from the m aturity o f legislation beginning from the enactm ent o f the W aste M anagem ent A ct in 1970. For example, the developm ent o f nutrient m anagem ent plans stem m ed from the progression o f local m unicipal by-law s in m unicipalities tlrroughout the province. Furtherm ore, the

incorporation o f b est m anagem ent practices and nutrient storage requirem ents provides evidence o f the developm ent o f the N M A from other legislative documents.

D espite the developm ent o f legislation in the province o f Ontario, it is unclear if science has substantiated the requirem ents m ade under legislation. Chapter Three will address the current research o f subsurface microbial transport and abatement. The research will aid in determ ining if studies support the m odeling o f m icroorganism s through the subsurface and if nutrient m anagem ent legislation has utilized this research to protect source w aters from pathogens.

Chapter Three: Abatement and Transport of Microorganisms in the Subsurface Environment
M ovem ent o f m atter through the soil m atrix, including transport tlirough air pockets, w ater deposits and soil particles presents different challenges for researchers who study m ovem ent through the subsurface environment. Transport o f pathogens through the subsurface environm ent has becom e especially im portant to the agricultural com m unity and to populations who surround agricultural operations. D epending on soil structure and nutrients used on agricultural lands, source w aters m ay be threatened by biological agents contained w ithin animal nutrients. It is only through research and experim ental studies that one begins to understand the relationship betw een soil and the biological and chem ical com ponents contained within it.

The introduction o f pollutants to the subsurface environm ent is well established and researched b y the scientific com munity, ranging from soil and plant nutrients (from agricultural operations) to the m icroorganism s and organic m atter that accom pany them in the soil (M aw dsley et al. 1995., Ogden et al. 2001., B lanc and N asser, 1996., D ighton et al. 1997). The challenge for researchers is to identify those factors that inhibit or encourage chem ical and microhial m ovem ent. In doing so, researchers can identify situations within environm ents w here source waters may b e tlireatened by nutrients and agricultural practices.

The heterogeneity o f the subsurface environm ent is perhaps the largest governing factor affecting the vertical and horizontal m ovem ent o f a particle or liquid. N ot only m ust we consider the physical and chem ical properties o f the foreign particle, we m ust also consider local environm ent conditions which can affect how the particle will be transported, if at all, in the subsurface. W e cannot sim ply exam ine a single environm ental factor and analyze its effect on the entire system . Rather, w e m ust look at the subsurface m atrix as a myriad o f factors that interact with one another w hich m ay im pede, suspend or encourage m ovem ent o f a particle in several possible directions. The governing factors o f particle m ovem ent through the subsurface include physical and

40

chem ical properties o f m ovem ent, environm ental and m icrobiological factors, and existing environm ental subsurface conditions.

3.1 Physical and Chemical Properties of Movement
T he laws o f biophysics and biochem istry govern m icrobial m ovem ents in the subsurface environm ent. In order for m odels to b e developed, an understanding o f particle m ovem ent is essential. It is the interaction betw een environm ental and m icrobial factors w hich will determ ine the fate o f the m icroorganism .

A ccording to a study perform ed by Loehr (1984), the objective o f land treatm ent with anim al w astes is to use the chem ical, physical, and biological properties o f the soil/plant environm ent to assim ilate w aste com ponents w ithout adversely affecting soil quality o r causing contam inants to b e released into w ater or the atm osphere. It is im portant to understand the biophysical and chem ical properties o f m icrobial m ovem ent in order to protect source w aters and the natural environm ent. G erba et al. (1991) reported that five key factors determ ine the physical transport o f m icroorganism s through soil. T hey include: 1 . A dvection - the process o f transport in bulk m otion o f flow ing w ater with carriage at a rate equal to the average velocity o f the w ater flow. 2. D ispersion - spreading o f the organism as they pass through the subsurface medium. 3. A dsorption - adhesion to soil particles 4. Filtration - removal o f organism s from the po re w ater b y size exclusion 5. D ecay or die o ff - inactivation by environm ental stress, such as tem perature, or lack o f nutrients

The retention o f organism s in the subsurface is a com plex set o f reactions that occur at the surface o f the sand particle. A ngers and Caron (1998) found that m ost chem ical, biological and physical reactions and processes occur at the interface betw een the solid, liquid, and gas states. F or exam ple, Jew ett et al. (1999) show ed in sand colum n experim ents that as bacteria accum ulated in the gas-liquid interface, total cell removal

41

was inversely proportional to w ater content in th e system . In other w ords, total bacterial retention (Rt) w as low est for w ater-saturated experim ents. D ecreasing the w ater content to 84% w ater saturation resulted in a 22% increase in Rt. A further decrease in w ater content to 46% saturation produced a 90% increase in total bacterial retention com pared to saturated conditions. Therefore, 51 % o f the cells w ere transported through the colum n under saturated conditions, w hile only 5% o f the cells passed through the colum n in the 46% w ater content experim ents. T he results suggest th at increased bacterial rem oval is obseiwed under g as-liq u id interfaces in the subsurface. The increased retention o f bacteria at the gas-liquid interface indicates that the interface is an im portant factor in lim iting pathogen m igiation, for evaluating biocolloid-facilitated transport o f pollutants, and developing biorem ediation strategies for unsaturated porous m edia.

T he surface chem istry o f soil particles and soil w ater chem istry influence surface charges on soil particles and adherence o f m icroorganism s to them (D ighton et al. 1997). O rganic m atter and clay particles both possess large, negatively charged, surface areas, w hich increase m icrobial adsoiption (M arshall, 1971). Tins is one o f th e m ain reasons why little dissem ination o f particles through subsurface environm ents w ith clay particulates is observed. A s a result, the percentage o f clay m atter w ithin the soil m atrix will help deteim ine the overall adhesion and abatem ent potential o f the soil matrix.

Sedim entation is a physical process that requires consideration in analyzing the m igration o f m icrobes. Sedim entation is filtration due to gravity and depends on particle buoyancy (Ginn et al., 2002). M any natural b acteria and viruses are neutrally buoyant, thus sedim entation is negligible (G inn et al., 2002). H owever, cultured m icroorganism s are typically larger and som etim es m ore dense than th eir native counterparts and m ay involve sizeable buoyancy-driven filtration (G inn et ah, 2002). O verall, sedim entation is observed as having a negligible effect on tire overall m ovem ent o f m icrobes and particulates through the soil m atrix.

An additional physical process that occurs w ithin the soil m atrix is straining. Straining occurs w ithin soil pores sm aller than the lim iting dim ension o f the cell, and

42

adsorption onto particles controls the m ovem ent o f bacteria through soils (C atteneo et al. 1997). Straining o f m icrobes and various other particulate in the subsurface is a natural process w hich accounts for the rem oval o f m atter, especially in fin er soils such as clays. For exam ple, straining w ould play a role in clay-based soils w here larger m icroorganism s, such as fungi are added to the soil m atrix. The rate o f passage o f a m icroorganism through the soil m ay be affected either b y B row nian m ovem ent o r its ow n m otility (G riffen & Quail, 1968). Straining and physical filtration represent the rem oval o f m icrobes from a solution b y physical (geom etric and interm olecul ar/surface) forces (Ginn et al. (2002). H ow ever, like sedim entation, straining plays a lim ited ro le in the overall transport o f significant p u b lic health m icroorganism s such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa through the subsurface environm ent.

Several researchers have m odeled attachm ent o f b acteria to soil particles via sorption m echanism s using the colloid filtration theory. A ccording to C am eron et al. (1997), sorption refers to the processes b y w hich an organic chem ical in the soil sorbs onto solid surfaces (soil) or penetrates into the solid m atrices. Sim ilarly, colloid filtration theory explains th e processes o f attachm ent o f m atter, and in particular, the attachm ent between bacteria and sedim ent. C olloid filtration theory assum es that attachm ent (o f bacteria and sedim ent) is a 2-step process. First, the bacterium m ust be transported to the porous m edia grain (the "collector") (G inn et al., 2002). Second, the physochem ical interactions that occur upon contact betw een the tw o surfaces determ ine h ow the bacterium attaches to the surface o f the collector (G inn et ah, 2002). O nce a bacterium is transported w ithin a separation distance on the order o f fractions o f its ow n radius aw ay from a collector, a com plex set o f interactions occurs th at dictates the outcom e o f the attachm ent possibility (Ginn et ah, 2002).

The D erjagiiin-Landau-Vei'w ey-O verbeek (D V L O ) theory o f colloid stability has been w idely em ployed as a m odel for describing the interaction forces betw een a m icrobe and a solid surface (Ginn et ah, 2002). The D V LO force is the sum o f the L ondon-van der Waals fo rc e and the electrostatic force (the double la y er force w hich m ay b e repulsive or attractive depending on the charges o f the tw o interacting surfaces) (G inn et

43

al., 2002). Flux o f m icroorganism s through soil is, how ever, reduced i f th e effects o f adsoiption and retardation are taken into account (G erba et ah, 1991). 3.1.1 V ertical M ovem ent V ertical and horizontal m ovem ent o f pathogens through th e subsurface are governed b y m any o f the sam e factors as other non-viable substances. U nless land is saturated (or o f an im perm eable nature), vertical m ovem ent o f m icroorganism s through the soil w ill occur (M aw dsley et al. 1995) w hen w astes (or nutrients) are applied to land. M aw dsley et al. (1995) sum m arized the factors that affect the vertical m o v em en t o f particles through th e subsurface. T h ey include; · · · « · · · · Soil type Soil w ater content R ainfall/intensity o f rainfall T em perature pH M esofaunal activity Surface properties o f m icroorganism s, and Presence o f plant roots.

Soil type influences m icrobial transport b y its physical structure (relative proportion o f sand, silt, clay, and organic m atter) and th e variation in adsorptive capacity o f its colloidal m aterial (D ighton et al. 1997). T h e adsorptive properties are thought to be im portant for viral retention, w hereas fo r bacteria, physical properties are also significant (Goyal and G erba, 1979) (See section 3.3.4).

O nce nutrients have been applied to the soil, it acts as a diffuse source. C rops m ay take up nutrients, or the nutrients m ay be available fo r transport (G oss et al. 2001). In a study perform ed by D ighton et al. (1997), it w as show n that w here a n ew population o f bacteria is added to soil, it is likely that indigenous bacteria w ill occupy m o st o f the adsorption sites. T here m ay b e som e exchange betw een the new and the added

44

population, but it is likely th at the new population will be m ore readily redistributed b y w ater fluxes (D ighton et al. 1997). 3.1.2 H orizontal M ovem ent U nlike vertical abatem ent and transport, horizontal m ovem ent o f particles and m icrobes is affected to a greater capacity b y th e topographical features o f the land. M aw dlsey et al. (1995) sum m arized the factors that m ost affect horizontal m ovem ent (and surface runoff) o f particles through the soil. They include rainfall/intensity o f rainfall, topography o f the land and proxim ity to the pollutant source, agricultural practices, and w eather/season at tim e o f application.

O nce percolating drainage w ater reaches zones o f groundw ater m ovem ent, the organism s it is carrying m ay b e m oved large horizontal distances (D ighton et al. 1997). H ow ever, that depth m ay be below the zone w here soil fauna are found, except perhaps for som e o f the deeper burrow ing lum bricoids (Dighton et al. 1997). H orizontal dispersal in the upper layers is m ore likely to b e brought about by the soil fauna rather than w ater flux, except in areas o f sloping ground. This lateral m ovem ent (such as the m ovem ent o f particulates via surface ru n -o ff o f m aterial) is a particular problem in soils w ith im perm eable substrata or in w aterlogged conditions (M aw dsley et al. 1995), especially as it relates to w ell w ater safety. 3.1.3 E lectrostatic, B iological and C hem ical processes A s organism s are introduced into the subsurface environm ent, they m ay b e altered not only b y environm ental factors, but also by their ow n grow th and replication m ethods. The m icrobial m ethods affecting abatem ent o r transport are expressed through growth and decay processes and include active adhesion/detachm ent, survival and chem otaxis m echanism s (G inn et al. 2002). Typical grow th phases o f m icrobial populations (in laboratory settings) include the lag, exponential, stationary and death phases (M adigan et al. 1997). Several factors w ill determ ine how successful a m icrobial population is w hen introduced into an environm ent. A ccording to research perform ed by G inn et al. (2002), the biological nature o f these (growth) processes presents a challenge for transport

45

m odeling in that one biological m echanism is often dependent on and/or influenced by another.

Several studies have reported that m icroorganism s exhibit active adhesion/detachm ent processes that m ay be responsive to local nutrient availability, sur\dval m echanism s, and/or grow th m echanism s (Ginn et ah, 2002). It is possible that the evidently dynam ic attaclim ent/detachm ent processes are in fact ram ifications o f extracellular polym eric substance (EPS) m echanics or other cell-driven factors under transient m etabolic states (G inn et ah, 2002). Sm ets et al (1997) reported experim ental results indicating the adhesion o f a pseudom onad to glass was significantly m ore favorable in the experim ental grow th phase than in the stationary or decay phase. This was due in m ost part to the cell surface structure, cell physiochem istry or the hydrodynam ic behaviour o f the cells at the tim e o f growth (Ginn et ah, 2002).

C hem otaxis occurs w hen an organism m oves to or aw ay from a p o in t along a chem ical gradient. T aking this chem ical process into account, chem otaxis m echanism s m ay p lay a role in the transm ission or organism s through an environm ent, especially where chem ical gradients exist. M icroorganism s that have the capability to m ove in response to a chemical gradient are term ed `chem otactic' (G inn et ah, 2002). Both random m otion (taxis in the absence o f a chem ical gradient) and chem otaxis have been cited as potential m eans o f transport fo r subsurface organism s (G inn et ah, 2002). Quantitatively, random m otility is an effective diffusing flux for m icroorganism s that depend on the local spatial gradient in aqueous m icroorganism s concentration, and chem otaxis is a flux o f m icroorganism s associated with the gradient in nutrient supply (Ginn et ah, 2002). A ccording to G inn et ah (2002), chem otaxis processes require energy (ATP) and are therefore highly dependent on the environm ent and available nutrients to determ ine the m ovem ent potential o f the m icrobe. A lthough chem otaxis processes play some role in the transport o f m icrobes, it is unlikely that gradient differences will result in significant m icrobial transport. H ow ever, chem otactic m ovem ent m ay p lay a significant role in dissem inating m icrobes large distances w hen small m ovem ents cause the m icrobe to travel through m acropores.

46

3.2 Environmental subsurface conditions
C onditions o f an environm ent will dictate how substances, specifically m icroorganism s, live and m ove, either horizontally or vertically (or both) through the subsurface. Factors dictating m ovem ent or abatem ent include differences in degrees o f pH, tem perature, soil w ater content (including precipitation), the presence o f plants, presence o f m acropores, soil aggregation practices, and soil com position and structure. 3.2.1 Soil W ater C ontent (including precipitation) Several substances contribute to the com plexity o f the subsurface environment, including w ater. Sources o f w ater in the subsurface originate from precipitation events, along w ith naturally occurring w ater deposits from ground w ater sources or from the vertical and horizontal transport o f w ater systems. Saturation o f the subsurface environm ent (particularly the severity o f environm ental saturation), presents several different scenarios for m icrobial transport to occur. For example, a heavy rainfall event could cause quick saturation o f the subsurface (depending on the com position o f the subsurface), and even quicker dissem ination o f m icrobes present both w ithin the subsurface and at the top o f the soil matrix. A study by Ogden et al. (2001) reported that the risks o f Escherichia coli contam ination are greatest im m ediately after an application o f slurry, and that the first increm ents o f drain flow (from rainfall events) carry significant bacterial concentrations.

C onversely, the risk o f contam ination appears to dim inish after the first rainfall event (follow ing a dry period). For example, a study b y Ogden et al. (2001) found that if w eather conditions are dry after application on w ell-drained sandy soils, it is unlikely that any significant losses o f bacteria (to drains) will occur. U nder dry conditions, m icroorganism s m ay rem ain on the soil/grass w here their numbers will decline due to desiccation and exposure to natural UV radiation (O gden et al., 2001). Therefore, not only is the environm ent after saturation events im portant to m icrobial abatem ent or transport, but the condition o f the environm ent prior to saturation seems to determine (among other factors) the degree o f m icrobial transport within the soil either in a vertical or horizontal direction.

47

W hile saturation certainly has som e effect on subsurface transport o f pathogens, saturation has also been shown to affect existing soil structural form. F o r exam ple, consider a soil rich in clay m atter. D epending on the percentage o f clay content, soils show variable potential to shrink and swell. The loss o f volum e after drying leads to the developm ent o f cracks which can be as large as 5 cm and can extend to considerable depths, up to 80 cm or m ore depending on the soil and clim atic conditions as w ell as the presence o f vegetation (Ravina, 1983; Angers and Caron, 1998). These `cracks' can significantly aid in deep m icrobial transport, especially w hen liquid m anure (or slurry) is added or w hen dry m atter is added to the soil surface only to be followed by precipitation.

The presence o f vegetation has also been shown to affect vertical transport o f m icrobes b y m eans o f m acropore transport (see section 3.2.5). Grevers and D e Long (1990) proved that as vegetation biom ass increased, the greater the area and length o f the m acropores (due in m ost part to w ater uptake). These pores cause relatively large gaps in the soil m atrix allow ing for quick dissemination and travel, (within the subsurface) which m ay lead to w ater contam ination events. As vegetation and root system s die and decay, form ation o f m acropores occurs, causing rapid dissem ination o f particulates through the subsurface.

D espite internal environm ental factors such as m icro and m acro pores created by vegetative root system s, it seem s that the flow intensity o f precipitation events and periods o f drying are critical to fluid and particulate transport and abatement. For exam ple, according to D ighton et al. (1997), the m ost im portant factor in the abiotic dispersal o f m icroorganism s is the flow o f percolating soil water. Cycles o f intense m oisture and drying influence the soil structure causing several changes that affect m ovem ent o f particles w ithin the soil matrix. Intense rainfall periods disturb soil systems causing particles to flow vertically. Conversely, drying produces cracks and induces soil fractures, w hile rapid w etting can induce m icro-cracks, w hich can m ake the soil more friable (D exter, 1991; Angers and Caron, 1998).

48

In general, lack o f m ovem ent (abatement) and lim ited survival o f pathogens in soil is associated w ith unsaturated conditions. Inputs o f w ater into a dry subsurface environm ent can cause an increase in particle dissemination for several reasons including altering the ionic strength o f the subsurface. M oisture low ers the ionic strength o f the pore fluid and preferential flow paths created by plant roots and soil invertebrates and promotes m icrobial transport (Zym an & Sorber 1988; D uboise et al, 1976; Trevors 1990; M adsen & A lexander 1982). Furtherm ore, m oisture has also been shown to play a predom inant role in the ecosystem by having a large effect on viability o f organism s w ithin the soil content. Griffen (1981) showed that m oisture plays a selective role in determining w hether bacteria or fungi are the dominant organism s in soil respiration (Griffen 1981). W ith the exception o f fungi (see section 3.3.6), which can grow in airfilled pores, the m icrobial population o f soil is restricted to the aqueous phase and the solid-liquid interface (M awdsley et al. 1995). Therefore, soil w ater content will not only affect m icrobial m ovem ent, but also survival o f m icroorganism s in soil, w ith different species exhibiting considerable variation in their ability to w ithstand both high and low water content (M aw dsley et al. 1995). The internal and external characteristics o f m icroorganism s distributed in the soil add to the com plexity o f m odeling subsurface transport. An ability to withstand environmental stresses, along with the surface and behavioral characteristics o f the m icrobe, will affect how it is distributed, if at all.

Pore capacity plays a significant role in determining the amount o f w ater perm itted in the pore space along with the aerobic conditions w ithin it. As soil pores becom e increasingly water-filled, bacteria m ay find them selves in an anoxic environm ent (Griffen, 1981). F or obligate aerobes, this will probably result in decreased viability and survival (M aw dsley et al. 1995). Conversely, anaerobic m icroorganism s m ay thrive in such an anoxic environm ent. Therefore, the levels o f saturation in the subsurface will not only affect the transport o f the m icroorganism s, but the viability o f the organism s during and after horizontal and vertical transport. For consistently w aterlogged conditions (high ground w ater tables), anaerobic conditions will prevail, influencing the types o f organisms (anaerobic m icroorganism s) present within the soil matrix.

49

O f particular concern to public health agencies are deep subsurface transport and abatement o f m icrobes, specifically pathogens, w hich can be harm ful to hum ans and cause illness by infiltrating drinking w ater sources. So-called `foreign' bacteria m ay be introduced by the addition o f animal w astes to land via hum an and/or animal actions. However, horizontal transport o f m icrobes is also a concern, especially w here land slope and surface w aters are concerned. W here nutrients are applied prior to significant rainfall events, horizontal transport (or ponding) is highly probable because soils can't retain and transport w aters vertically quickly enough. Horizontal m ovem ent and surface ru n o ff becom es a greater concern particularly in agricultural areas w here high giound w ater tables prevail and w here w ell-w ater potability is essential as a drinking w ater source. A bu-A shour and L ee (1999) reported th at surface runoff carries bacteria significant distances dow nstream causing serious threats to groundw ater and surface w aters. For example, E. coli has been shown to survive in semi-arid areas for long periods o f time on tlie surface. This survival increases potential o f contam ination w here imnoff potential is high. A later study b y A bu-A shour and Lee (2000) showed that run o ff events m ore than likely cause detachm ent o f cells at the surface o f soil particles in heavy rainfall events, which contributes to heavy loads o f organism s downstream from w here the nutrient (manure) w as applied. This horizontal m ovem ent can cause contamination w here surface water sources are n ear and w here pooling and flooding m ay occur which can subsequently re-contam inate animal pasture. 3.2.2 Plants and P lant Roots M icroorganism s use vegetative root systems as a m eans o f obtaining organic matter. H owever, the root system s also act as transport m echanism s to w hich fluid, along with m icroorganism s m ay be transported tlirough the soil. Angers and Caron (1998) noted that vegetation affects an organism 's structural form and stability at different scales through various direct and indirect m echanism s. By penetrating the soil, roots form m acropores which favour fluid transport (Angers and Caron, 1998). The pores create `zones o f failure', w hich fragm ent or form soil aggregates (Angers and Caron, 1988). The fluid, which is transported througlr these `zones o f failure' m ay carry m icrobes and other substituents (which are perm itted to m ove vertically) vertically tlirough the soil.

50

The distance o f rooting system s provides the opportunity for m icrobes to m ove down into the subsurface environm ent through other environmental m echanism s (as will be discussed in further sections). Increased flow o f w ater and other particles along the living roots has been attributed to the presence o f a saturated film o f w ater on the surface o f the roots (Angers and Caron, 1998). The w ater acts as a natural 'lu b rican t' which, am ong other functions aids in the transport o f m atter vertically down the root system.

Tlie viability o f the root system is irrelevant to m icrobial and particulate transport. Research perform ed by Angers and Caron (1998) noted that the w hole plant, dead or alive, could be an im portant source o f carbon. The plant systems provide m icrobes and fauna w ith a substrate for the production o f stabilizing material as well as providing physical protection o f the soil surface against structural processes like rainfall or com paction (Angers and Caron, 1998). The by-products released by the m etabolic processes o f the root system can affect soil structure. Plant roots can prom ote soil aggregation by releasing material that can directly stabilize soil particles, or, by favoring m icrobial activity in the rhizosphere, affect soil structure (Angers and Caron, 1998). The `rhizosphere' presents a very diverse area for m icrobial activity, largely induced by root exudation and mucilage, root sloughing and favorable aeration and w ater conditions in the root vicinity (Bowen and Rovina, 1991; A ngers and Caron, 1998).

R oot systems contribute to the overall chemical structure o f the soil environm ent by contributing substances w hich can change the chemistry o f the local environm ent. Reid et al. (1982) found that plant roots affect the chemical and ionic environm ent in the soil, causing the release o f m inerals and organic m atter, w hich act to increase aggregate stability. Plant roots act as food for several m icroorganism s. As a result o f their growth, m icroorganism s are dispensed deeper into the subsurface. Dispersal m ay be further increased as root depth creates new macropores. The length and activities o f root systems not only affects structural stability o f the subsurface system, but can also threaten local source w ater reservoirs w here ground w ater tables are low.

3.2.3 Soil Com position and Soil Structure Soil stnacture is as m uch a product o f its envirom uent as the m icrobes that belong to it. Soil structure is central to subsurface functions as it controls water, gas fluxes, nutrient fluxes and storage. A ccording to a study perform ed by K ay (1990), soil structure can conceptually be characterized b y its form, stability, and resilience. Structural foim refers to th e arrangem ent o f solids and voids that exist at a given time. Stability is the ability o f the soil to retain this arrangem ent w hen exposed to different stresses (Angers and Caron, 1998). It is the overall stability o f the subsurfaee system w hieh will determine the predom inant organism s in it. A long with other factors (m oisture inputs), soil com position plays a significant role in transport o f m icroorganism s. For example, Patni et al. (1984) showed that the percentage o f amrual rainfall that percolated to depths below the drains was greater in coarse as opposed to fine textured soil, suggesting the potential for dissemination o f pathogens is greater in soils o f the foim er type.

T he ratio between clays, sands and loam will detenuine the com position o f the subsurface enviromuent, along w ith the abatement potential for organism s in the soil. This ratio o f particles w ill help to determine, am ong other factors, the porosity o f the soil structure, the soil-water content, the predom inant type o f vegetation grow ing on the surface o f the soil, elements present in the soil (relationship between m etals and clay particles) and the indigenous m icrobial population predom inant in the soil. For example, a study by Catteneo et al. (1997) demonstrated that m icrobial transport depended on the clay content o f the soil, w here higher clay contents w ere responsible for higher filtration coefficients.

F o r nutrient applicators, the soil type is critical in predicting potential transport o f microbes and nutrients in the soil. For example, it is reasonable to predict that soils higli in sand (and therefore high in porosity) will m ove liquids further vertically by m eans o f giavitational action, decreased com paction, and increased pore spacing. Conversely, it is reasonable to expect that soils high in clay m atter (which generally rem ain wellcom pacted), will act to discourage vertical dispersion as porosity is usually low and com paction o f pore spaces high. D espite the overall lack o f vertical m ovem ent, the

52

survival o f m icrobes in clay soils is usually greater versus soils high in sand or loam. For example, M aw dsley et al. (1995) show ed that soil type is a m ajor factor influencing m icrobial transport in the subsurface, ow ing partly to differences in adsorptive properties o f its colloidal m aterial. Conversely, the type o f dom inant species present in the soil matrix m ay have som e effect on soil com position such as soil aggregation. 3.2.4 R esearch in Soil Structure and Pathogen A batem ent and Transport: Intact Soil Sam ples vs. N atural E nvironm ent Studies Studies in the field o f nutrient and microbial transport norm ally take place in one o f three m ethodological settings including a field setting, in a laboratory using intact soil samples, and in a laboratory using re-distributed soil sam ples

There is a debate about the m erits o f using intact soil samples as opposed to reconstituted sam ples for study purposes. Several studies have show n that reconstituted/reconstructed soil sieves are less effective in experim ents because they lack the heterogeneity o f intact structures found in field studies. For exam ple. Sm ith et al. (1985) com pared m ovem ent o f a tracer fluid in an intact soil sieve com pared w ith a con esponding disturbed soil sieve. It was shown that at least 93% o f the inoculated E. coli cells w ere retained in disturbed soil from which the m ajority o f channels and macropores had been removed by m ixing (M awdsley et al. 1995). In contrast, in the intact cores, only 21-73% o f inoculated cells w ere retained, indicating that the role o f macropores in bacterial transport had a significant effect on overall transport (M awdsley et ah 1995) (see section 3.2.5).

It is w ell established that subsurface transport studies conducted u nder true environm ental conditions are ideal for research puiposes. It is also well understood that the characteristics o f land receiving m anure will influence the fate o f nutrient constituents through factors such as soil texture (percent sand, silt, clay), slope, depth to w ater table, proxim ity to w ater resources, and tillage. W eather conditions (wind speed during application, and rainfall intensity, fiequency and duration before and after m anure application) detennine w hether potential contaminants m ove off-site in surface runoff, tile drainage flow, ground w ater, and air or remain in the root zone w here nutrients can be

53

taken up by crops. (Goss et al. 2001) In other words, variable environm ental conditions will affect overall outcome. As a result, it is im possible to predict w hat will happen to manure under a given set o f conditions (Goss et al. 2001).

D espite the lack o f evidence supporting the use o f intact core sam ples in all research initiatives, reconstituted soil colum ns still play a role in experim ents on physical and chemical transport characteristics o f organism s in the soil. Intact soil sam ples will continue to serve as valuable tools because they allow environm ental variables to be controlled and they exclude inconsistencies produced by external sources. 3.2.5 Porosity and M acropores Porosity o f a soil system is detem iined by several factors, including environmental stressors and soil com position. Soil porosity provides an assessm ent o f the total volum e o f soil available fo r storage, but gives no indication o f pore organization. Visual and m icrom orphological m ethods, as well as w ater desorption characteristics and water and gas flow m easurem ents, are used to investigate soil pore space organization (Angers and Caron, 1998). Pore space organization plays a large role in m icrobial transport, as it helps dictate w here organism s will end up in a defined soil environm ent.

Porosity w ill detennine availability o f pore spaces, which m ay enhance rapid transport o f m atter, especially in dryer climates w here saturation is decreased . W hen m oisture events occur, liquids fill pore spaces and m ay inadvertently transfer m icroorganism s vertically and/or horizontally. The stinctural fo n n o f pore enviroranents is governed by inherent soil properties (clay content and type), as well as by hum an and biological activity such as tillage practices (see section 3.2.9), root decay, and m icroflora/fauna activity. Soil structure and fonn will thus evolve in tim e response to the temporal variation o f these factors (A ngers and Caron, 1998) as environm ental factors change over time.

M acropores play a significant role in subsurface m icrobial transport, especially in agricultural system s w here overall precipitation rates are stable and nutrient application rates are high. M acropores play a role in the preferential flow phenom enon, by w hich

54

taken up by crops. (G oss et al. 2001) In other w ords, variable environm ental conditions will affect overall outcom e. A s a result, it is im possible to predict w hat w ill happen to m anure under a given set o f conditions (G oss et al. 2001).

D espite tire lack o f evidence supporting the use o f intact core sam ples in all research initiatives, reconstituted soil colum ns still play a role in experim ents on physical and chem ical transport characteristics o f organism s in the soil. Intact soil sam ples will continue to serve as valuable tools because they allow environm ental variables to be controlled and they exclude inconsistencies produced b y external sources. 3.2.5 Porosity and M acropores Porosity o f a soil system is determ ined by several factors, including environm ental stressors and soil com position. Soil porosity provides an assessm ent o f the total volum e o f soil available for storage, but gives no indication o f p o re organization. Visual and m icrom oiphological m ethods, as well as w ater desoiption characteristics and w ater and gas flow m easurem ents, are used to investigate soil pore space organization (Angers and Caron, 1998). Pore space organization plays a large role in m icrobial transport, as it helps dictate w here organism s will end up in a defined soil environm ent.

Porosity will determ ine availability o f pore spaces, which m ay enhance rapid transport o f m atter, especially in dryer clim ates w here saturation is decreased. W hen m oisture events occur, liquids fill pore spaces and m ay inadvertently transfer m icroorganism s vertically and/or horizontally. T he stm ctural form o f pore enviroranents is governed by inlierent soil properties (clay content and type), as well as by hum an and biological activity such as tillage practices (see section 3.2.9), root decay, and m icroflora/fauna activity. Soil structure and fonn will thus evolve in tim e response to the temporal variation o f these factors (A ngers and Caron, 1998) as environm ental factors change over time.

M acropores play a significant role in subsurface m icrobial transport, especially in agricultural system s w here overall precipitation rates are stable and nutrient application rates are high. M acropores play a role in the preferential flow phenom enon, by w hich

54

creation o f new ones w hich vary in size but are in the m acropore ran g e (>30 um ) (Angers and Caron, 1998). A s discussed in section 3.2.5, pores m ay be responsible fo r transpoif o f m atter long distances through the subsurface. H ow ever, when pores begin to decrease in size (due to an increase in root m ass), transport opportunities are reduced.

B arley (1954) show ed that infiltration rates could actually b e reduced b y actively grow ing roots that com pact the soil m atrix (m ore so in the upper layers o f th e soil). This com paction increases overall shear stress o f the soil. In cases w here soil structure is already rigid (clay soils), retention qualities o f th e subsurface increase, w hile transport m ay be reduced. H ow ever, w hen plants die and root system s rem ain (and decay occurs), tissue rem nants and the associated m icroflora linger as a pore coating on channel w alls enhancing w ater transport efficiency (Barley, 1954). A s decay continues, po re spaces and transport probability increase. Therefore, in a tem poral system w here cooler tem peratures prevail (in the w inter or in the fall), it can be expected that dead or decaying root system s .ict as a m eans for rapid transport o f m atter (especially fluids) as pore spaces increase and overall shear stress decreases during the w inter season.

The process o f pore fonn a ti on by roots is believed to be particularly im portant in undisturbed or no-till soils as tillage tends to disin p t the continuity o f the po re system . Tillage is the physical act o f altering the top layer o f soil (see section 3.2.9). In tilled soils, plant roots contribute indirectly to m acropore form ation by seiving as food for fauna and in particular to earthw onns which have a w ell-docum ented im pact on channel form ation (Edw ards et al. 1989; A ngers and C aron, 1998). 3.2.7 pH T he viability o f m icroorganism s in the soil solution depends on several factors including its pH. The pH o f the soil affects the overall stability o f the subsurface system, along w ith the ability o f m icrobes to be retained or transported. B itton et al. (1974) dem onstrated that tw ice as m any bacteria w ere retained in m icrocosm s o f th e sam e soil adjusted to pH 3.3, instead o f pH 6.6 (Dighton et al. 1997) due to the surface charges o f both the soil particles in the environm ent and tlie bacteria surface charge. Sim ilarly, K em p et al. (1995) showed that significantly few er genetically-m odified Pseudom onas

56

flu o rescen s cells w ere found in the leachate from soil at pH 4.5 rather than pH 7.5 (D ighton et al. 1997). The pH o f the m atrix solution w ithin a porous m edium does not seem to h av e a large effect on bacterial transport because o f the heterogeneous structure o f the cell surface.

V iral transport can vary gi'eatly depending on th e pH o f the porous m edium solution (M aier et al. 2000) and depends to a great degree on the type o f virus strain. It is shown b y several researchers (Goyal and Gerba, 1979., M aier et al. 2000) th at as pH levels drop below 7.0, there is an increase in retention o f viral cells, and a decrease in transport potential due in m ost part because viral surfaces are in m ost cases hom ogeneous and therefore, are m ore prone to surface charges o f soil particles. V iruses are am photerically (either positive or negative) charged, b u t are negative at m o st pH values (Burge and Enkiri, 1978). A dsoiption and m ovem ent o f viruses and bacteria (K em p et al. 1992) appear to b e strongly con elated w ith increases in soil pH (D ubiose et ah, 1976; Burge and Enkiri, 1978; Goyal and Gerba, 1979). F or exam ple, G oyal and G erba (1979) found that soil pH was the m ajor variable affecting adsorption o f viruses to soil w here adsoiption increased and pH decreased. It w ould appear that the effects o f soil pH on vims survival are m ediated through a chem ical equilibrium , w here the charge states are relative concentrations o f alum inum and phosphorus (H urst et al. 1980).

D espite greater overall m icrobial retention, both high and low pH values are known to decrease the survival o f m ost bacterial and viral pathogens (H urst et ah, 1980; Reddy et ah, 1981). H owever, certain organism s are able to w ithstand extrem e levels including protozoal cysts (see section 3.3.7), w hich are generally considered m ore resistant to extrem es in pH (W illiam s, 1979; M aw dsley et ah 1995). B oth th e biological and physio-chem ical properties o f soil and the subsurface are affected by pH . In turn, this w ill affect suiwival and transport o f m icroorganism s (M aw dsley et ah 1995). pH m easurem ents o f soil reflect only its bulk pH, and not those individual pockets or m icroenvironm ents w hich m ay exist (M aw dsley et ah 1995). In cases w here biofilm s are present, properties o f the entire system m ay not be indicative o f the m icroenvironm ent.

57

such as is the case w ith biofilm s w here pH and other variables m ay be com pletely different from th e surface environm ent. 3.2.8 T em perature T he effect th at tem perature h as on bacterial and viral transport is as m u ch a factor o f viability and survivability o f th e m icroorganism as it is m ovem ent. A ccording to G erba and B itton (1984), the survival and m igration o f m icroorganism s in soil and groundw ater are controlled b y the specific m icroorganism type, the nature o f th e soil, and the clim ate o f th e environm ent. T he overall am bient tem perature o f the subsurface system has different effects on different species o f organism s. It is this diversity am ongst different subsets o f organism s that prevents researchers from generalizing concepts and relationships betw een subsurface tem perature, abatem ent opportunities, transport pathw ays and v iability o f m icroorganism s.

A m bient tem peratures seem to have little effect on th e viability or transport o f m icroorganism s. H ow ever, w here tem peratures are extrem e (hot or cold), a significant difference in transport m ay be observed. F o r exam ple, N asser et al. (1996) found that the m ost im portant factor for viral persistence in the environm ent is tem perature. R esults that focused on virus m ovem ent and viability in colder clim ates point to sim ilar findings by Reneau et al. (1989). Like bacteria, Blanc and N asser (1996) found that viruses survive for long periods o f tim e in soil at am bient and cooler tem peratures. T he observations indicated further that viruses persist for long periods o f tim e in soil and groundw ater u n d er low tem peratures. Furtherm ore, R eneau et al. (1989) found that bacterial survival tim es are longest in m oist, cold soils and shortest in dry, w arm soils.

Soil tem perature m ay influence the transport o f m icroorganism s through the soil by its effect on dispersal, survival or adsoiption (K em p et ah, 1992). In general, low tem peratures favour survival o f bo th viruses (Y eager and O 'B rian , 1979; H urst et ah, 1980) and bacteria (K ibbey et ah, 1978; Zibilske and W eaver, 1978; (M aw dsley et ah, 1995) (see section 3.2.8). H ow ever, it m ust be stressed that viability does n o t

necessarily lead to abatem ent or transport. F or exam ple, although certain protozoa

58

{Giardia lam hlia) are able to w ithstand extrem e environm ental conditions (pH, tem perature), transport m ay not necessarily occur. 3.2.9 T illage Practices A ccording to Elliot and C olem an (1988), m anipulation o f soil structure is one o f the principal m eans b y w hich m icrobial dynam ics can be controlled both at the laboratory and field scales. T his control arises through alterations in habitat space, w ater and substrate distribution, and the spatial arrangem ent o f pore pathw ays. Tilling the soil is an effective m eans o f redistributing the top layers o f soil, typically in the top soil section o f the subsurface. In doing so, soils becom e m ore fertile as nutrients are redistributed in the layers w here root grow th and saturation are likely to occur.

D isturbance o f m aciopores b y cultivation prior to liquid m anure injection in fields can (further) reduce the levels o f contam ination in surface ru n o ff and tile drain w aters com pared to surface applied and conventional injection m ethods (K ing et al. 2000). K ing et al. (2000) show ed that the m odified injection m ethod is effective in reducing surface contam ination levels both im m ediately after m anure application and follow ing irrigation. H ow ever, the conventional injection m ethod appears to result in the highest levels o f bacterial contam ination vertically follow ing m anure application and is com parable to the surface application m ethod follow ing a sim ulated heavy rainfall (K ing et al. 2000). K ing also indicated that w hile conventional injection m ethods are effective in reducing surface ru n o ff losses, they contribute equal or greater m anure contam inants to the tile drains as surface application techniques (K ing et al. 2000).

W hile K ing et al. (2000) suggests m acropore flow is a likely pathw ay o f m anure to tile drains, additional research is required to determ ine the pathw ays and processes o f nutrient and bacterial transport. In som e cases, as the soil is redistributed, m icrobes m ay be exposed at the top o f the soil, leaving them vulnerable to the effects o f U V fi'om the sun. H ow ever, w here m icrobes are n o t destroyed by environm ental effects (UV light, tem perature changes), they m ay be re-dispersed into the soil m atrix by precipitation events. D epending on several factors included in the distribution and m ake-up o f the subsurface, m icroorganism s m ay be redistributed even further prio r to tillage.

Low rate sprinkler irrigation o f nutrients, in addition to pathogen dispersal through soil.results in the possibility o f aerosol dispersal. U ndoubtedly, bacteria, protozoa and viruses w ill all b e present in aerosols, but the tim e they rem ain viable largely depends on environm ental conditions (M aw dsley et al. 1995). K in g et al (2000) found th at the lack o f disturbance or disruption b y tillage (associated w ith no-till systems) has b een shown to increase earthw orm activity that can significantly contribute to m acropore formation. A s noted in section 3.2.5, the phenom enon o f preferential flow by m acropores acts to conduct w ater and solutes quickly to significant depths w ithout the soil m atrix being saturated (K ing et al. 2000). It is generally considered that to decrease the possible risk o f air contam ination, wastes should b e dispersed w here there is a low wind speed, w arm bright sunlight and a relative hum idity o f betw een 40-60% (Elliot and Ellis, 1997; M AFF, 1992b; M aw dsley et al. 1995). In general, it has been show n that an accom panying disturbance in the soil from direct agricultural aggregation leads to increased bacterial activity except w here com paction is caused b y heavy agricultural m achinery (D ighton et al. 1997).

3.3 Environmental and Microbiological Factors
T he interaction betw een viable organism s and the physical and chem ical characteristics o f the subsurface environm ent creates a com plex environm ent. Environm ental and m icrobiological variables are constantly changing to adapt to atm ospheric pressures and the chemical and physical stressors in the subsurface. 3.3.1 T ypes o f W aste Products used in agricultural settings such as m anure carry significant pathogen loads because o f their origin. It is w ell reported that the disposal o f w aste (o f fecal origin) entails a m ajor risk in the spread o f specific bacterial pathogens, as animals are reservoirs o f pathogens th at can enter the food chain and cause hum an infection (Ogden et al. 2001). Biochem ical w astes pose a contam ination threat due to their high biochem ical dem and and their ability to release phosphates and nitrates into the environm ent (M aw dsley et al. 1995) w here nitrates pose a threat to hum an health and phosphates cause eutrophication o f w ater bodies. H ow ever, chem ical w astes should not

60

be confused w ith viable m icroorganism s such as bacteria. A study by Goss et al. (2001) showed that bacteria and other pathogenic m icroorganism s are m uch larger than nitrate ions and their m ovem ent is m ore likely to be affected by the flow associated w ith the size o f pores in w hich they are transported. They have variable source charges w hich allows stronger adsorption o f the bacteria to soil particles.

A n im portant feature o f m icroorganism s is that their populations are dynamic. They are alive and are influenced b y factors that affect their survival and m otility in the subsurface (Goss et al. 2001). M aw dsley reported that the m ajor source o f contam ination on m ost farm s is likely from slurry or farmyard m anure (M aw dsley et al. 1995). Traditionally, farm ers and agricultural operations com posted farm yard m anure. An aerobic process, com posting occurs w here w astes are stored in bulk w here m icrobial activity causes tem peratures to rise as high as 70°C. A t such high tem peratures, a m ajority o f pathogens present in m anure are destroyed (Jones, 1980; M aw dsley et al. 1995). H ow ever, in m odem intensive systems, slurry is collected and stored under conditions w hich rapidly becom e anaerobic. High tem peratures and the concurrent destruction o f pathogens, seen in com posting, does not occur (M aw dsley et al. 1995).

A com m on practice linking all the types o f agricultural waste is their application on grass o r arable land. Agricultural operations m ust consider how and w here nutrients are applied, especially on land w here animal grazing is a common practice. A nother factor fo r the nutrient applicator to consider is the type o f animal w aste applied to the land. F or exam ple, Strauch (1991) showed that survival (o f m icrobes in the environment) is longest in cattle slurry, shorter in p ig slurry, and shortest in m anure from poultry and calf slurry.

Long periods w here w astes are perm itted to stay on land w ithout animal interaction or harvesting exercises are required to encourage d ie-off o f m icroorganism s (Fenlon et al. 2000). D ie-o ff is encouraged by subm itting organism s to environm ental conditions such as ultraviolet light, periods o f drying and periods o f intense heat and cold. Furtherm ore, preventing anim als from grazing on lands recently treated with

61

nutrients reduces tlie infection o f anim als. D ie o ff during the pre-harvesting and pre grazing periods discourages infection and subsequent re-infection o f grazing animals so that nutrient loads are not as concentrated w ith pathogenic organism s once m anure is collected for land application and storage.

A long w ith animal w astes, hum an wastes have been used as a source o f nutrients for m any years and are referred to as biosolids. W astes m ay be applied directly to land either as an untreated w aste or after the wastes are treated or perm itted to settle (in m unicipal treatm ent plants). M unicipalities who process wastes in a w astew ater treatm ent plant som etim es m ake this treated w aste available for use. M icrobial and chemical com position, together w ith the rate and extent o f m ovem ent o f the m icrobiological com ponent follow ing application to land will vary with w aste type (M aw dsley et al. 1995).

B iosolids present several challenges for the agricultural com m unity as they bring threats o f not on ly m icroorganism s, b u t also heavy m etals and other chem icals which if not properly treated, m ay present problem s for vegetation (through absorption via root channels) along w ith w ildlife and w ater sources. M etals have very high binding capacities for clay soils and organic m atter that m ay interfere com petitively with microbes for available binding sites. Sim ilar to m icroorganism s, the flow o f m etals in the subsurface environm ent is affected b y spéciation, pH, Eh, ionic strength, com position o f the soil solution and the clay and organic m atter content o f the soil (Gove et al. 2001 ). For example, in sand and in soils low in organic m atter, metal adsorption can be expected to be low , and therefore leaching is likely to be relatively high (Gove et al. 2001 ). Gove et al. (2001) found that sandy soils w ith low organic content are representative o f worstcase scenarios w here leaching o f m etals is likely to be a problem .

Tire com position and type o f w aste (nutrients) applied to land will play a m ajor role in th e dissem ination o f m icrobes to the subsurface environm ent. Three m ain agricultural w astes predom inantly used as soil nutrients include manure, biosolids and slurry (liquid and solid m ixture). A ccording to Strauch (1991), farmyard m anure refers

to a m ixture o f excreta together w ith substantial quantities o f bedding m aterials (straw, w ood shavings, saw dust, peat) dense enougli to b e handled as a solid. `Slurry' on the other hand, is a m ixture o f faeces and urine, which can also contain cleaning w ater, rain water, small quantities o f bedding m aterial and spoiled feed particles. Strauch (1991) added that as stored slurry is usually anaerobic, no spontaneous generation o f heat that could entail the destruction o f pathogens would occur in that m edium either in sum m er or winter. Therefore, slurries containing pathogens always pose a m icrobial hazard to animals and water.

Several studies have exam ined the survivability o f selected organism s such as enteroviruses in slurry m edia. Research by Goss et al. (2001) found that bacteria tend to be m ore evenly distributed in liquid than solid manure due in part to their mobility. Strauch (1991) found that enteroviruses are relatively `tenacious' in slurry. Furtherm ore, the tenacity o f pathogens (such as bacteria) is affected not only by environm ental conditions, but also by conditions prior to application such as storage conditions and type o f nutrient m edia (m anure or slurry).

Overall, bacterial survival in nutrient m edia is enhanced by reduction o f tem perature and an increase in solids content (Strauch, 1991). Q uantitative investigations in slurry samples w ith direct isolation o f viruses showed a virus titre o f about 1O '" TCidso per litre, whereas in sam ples which yielded enterovirus only after concentration, about 50-100 TCiD5 oper litre w ere found (Strauch, 1991). D ifferences in the chemical and biological com position o f both m edia (manure and slurry) depend on several factors including animal health along w ith storage and treatm ent m ethods. Animal health, especially w ith regard to animal feed, is an im portant issue in agricultural and w ater safety m anagem ent that should receive further attention in future research endeavors. 3.3.2 Types o f M icroorganism s The study o f m icrobial transport in the subsurface depends on the technology available to identify the biological and chemical characteristics that affect the organism . Recent genetic detection technology has perm itted researchers to discover genetic m aterial deep in subsurface environments, showing that m icrobes are well suited for deep

63

subsurface travel. For exam ple, PC R teclm ology allows researchers to identify DNA from m icroscopic organism s, such as Escherichia coli. However, tire technology does not disclose w hether the genetic m aterial came from a viable organism. Pathogenic m icroorganism s m ay he inactivated in the subsurface (or surface) environm ent over time such that, even if physically detected in groundwater, they are incapable o f causing infection. The rate o f this inactivation is organism -specific and higlily influenced by subsurface physical and chem ical conditions as discussed previously (M acler & M erkle, 1999; H urst et al. 1980; H urts and G oyle 1986; K utz and Gerba 1988; H urst et al. 1989).

Along w ith their pathogenicity, flexibility and survival strategies o f m icroorganism s have becom e equally im portant factors when transport m echanism s are j) ndicted. However, Egli et al. (2002) noted that two additional aspects nave becom e qually im portant biological m echanism s. First is the m icroorganism 's ability to easily acquire resistance to one or m ore antim icrobial drugs. Second is their capability to transfer ge: etic material related to pathogenicity and resistance-carrying DNA segments horizontally to other organism s. D ifferent species and families o f organism s possess different surfaces and survival characteristics that allow them to either flourish in the environm ent or cease to exist. Interest in the subsurface transport o f m icroorganism s stems from their ability to cause illness and death in both humans and in animals. Thus, the focus o f m ost research is custom ized to public health pathogens (see table 74) including bacteria, viruses and protozoa. 3.3.3 Viruses The unique characteristics o f viral particles m ake them difficult both to track and investigate. As opposed to bacteria, virus are m uch sm aller and thus, their transport is in most cases, synonym ous w ith particle transport. A ccording to M axwell et al. (2003), mathematical m odels o f virus transport in saturated porous media typically assum e that viruses represent a class o f subm icron particles (<1 um). As such, factors affecting their m igration include advection w ith liquid phase flow, hydrodynam ic dispersion, physical or chemical attachm ent onto the solid phase o f a porous m edium, detachm ent in the liquid phase, as well as inactivation or `d ie -o ff in either the liquid or solid phase (M axwell et ah, 2003). `Physical attachm eni' refers to the transfer o f free virus particles in the pore

64

liquids to the solid phase m inerals b y their direct physical interception, as well as their subsequent retention on these surfaces by van der W aals forces. The rate o f this transfer depends on the virus size, density, grain diameter, local flow velocity and other properties o f the liquid and porous m edium . `Chemical attachm ent' on the other hand, refers to the adsorption o f free virus particles in the solid phase as a result o f electrostatic attraction or other chem ical attractants (M axw ell et al., 2003).

V iruses can originate from m any sources. Tlie m ost frequently reported sources include sew age flom septic tanks, land application o f sewage and sew age sludges, domestic landfills, oxidation ponds and deep-well sewage injection (N asser et al. 2002). Viral transport in groundw ater is difficult to study because the principal w aterborne hum an viruses --the rotaviruses, adenoviruses, N oi'w alk viruses and the H epatitis A virus (HAV) - are m ore difficult to assay and therefore m ore difficult to detect (Sinton et al. 1996). A ccording to research from Strauch (1991), only in recent years have im provem ents in isolation techniques for viinses from heavily contaminated material led to rem arkable successes in identifying viruses in faecal m atter (Strauch, 1991). Recent techniques that allow for gene expression, such as D N A microarrays and Polym erase Chain R eaction (PCR) techniques will no doubt im prove interest in the topic o f virus transport. F or example, virus detection techniques are show ing many groundw ater sources to test positive for viruses w here they previously did not show contam ination (M axwell et al., 2003).

Studies that have exam ined viral transport in the subsurface environm ent have utilized few virus strains, opting for easily cultured viruses that are readily detectable. For exam ple, Sinton et al. (1996) found that although there have been som e studies o f viruses in groundw ater (for exam ple Sobsey et al., 1986), most investigators have used enteroviruses (which are the m ost easily cultured hum an viruses) or bacteriophages in their research. Although virus sources, pathways, and receptor links are certainly more num erous than previously docum ented, methods are still lacking to predict virus transport pathways in realistic geologic settings and to evaluate the sensitivity o f virus transport given geologic heterogeneity (M axw ell et al., 2003).

Viral survival and transport tlirough the subsurface environm ent, like bacteria, are influenced by several environm ental and m icrobial factors. Sinton et al. (1996) found that the effects o f filtration and sedim entation are generally negligible and that the principal factors affecting viral transport are the level o f soil saturation, virus type, adsorption rate, and inactivation potential.

Like bacteria, there is generally less m ovem ent o f viral particles in unsaturated conditions (Sinton et al. 1996). Fuitlreim ore, adsorption and abatem ent rates tend to be higher at low pH , low flow rates, in fine textured soils (particularly tliose w ith high clay content), and in the presence o f high cation concentrations (Sinton et al. 1996) due to surface charges o f subsurface particles. Adsorption is low er in the presence o f dissolved organics, and desorption m ay occur in the presence o f percolating rainw ater.

Genetic exchange am ongst viral particles is com mon. A ccording to D ighton et al (1997), provided that viral particles can withstand the physical constraints o f the soil environm ent, they will rem ain unaltered (Dighton et al. 1997). H owever, genetic m odification o f viruses in the subsurface environm ent appears to reduce their ability to w ithstand harsher physical constraints and environmental stresses (D ighton et al. 1997).

Virus adsorption to soil particles is influenced by soil texture, presence and concentration o f cations, soluble organics, pH, and virus type (Gerba et ah, 1975; N asser et ah, 1993; B lanc and N asser, 1996). H urst et al (1980) noted that adsoiption o f viruses to soil significantly affects virus suiwival. Cameron et al. (1997) stated that viral adsoiption by soil constituents is the prim ary mechanism o f retention (Cam eron et. al, 1997). H owever, overall soil retention is reduced as saturation (via rainfall) is increased.

Factors found to m ost influence virus survival in the subsurface environm ent include; · · · tem perature soil m oisture content presence o f aerobic m icroorganism s

degree o f virus adsorption to the soil soil levels o f resin-extractable phosphorus exchangeable alum inum soil pH.

A ccording to H urst et al. (1980), tem perature and v iras adsorption to soil appeared to b e the m ost im portant factors affecting virus sursdval. H urst et al. (1980) added that tem perature was a significant predictor o f viras survival under all sets o f conditions as inactivation rates increased when tem peratures increased. B lanc and N asser (1996) determ ined that subsurface type (loam y soil) and virus type w ere key factors in overall adsorption and transport o f viruses. The effect o f w ater quality on virus adsorption to soil w as viras type-dependent. In general, virus adsorption to sandy soil was greater than loam y soil. Blanc and N asser (1996) explained this relationship b identifying that low er adsorption o f virases to loam y soil can be attributed to the high content o f organic m aterial in the soil. In the study, no virus d ie-o ff was obseiwed at low tem peratures (10"C) under any one o f the study conditions. These results indicate that virases can persist for long periods o f tim e in soil and groundw ater under low temperatures. 3.3.4 B a cteria Research focused on contam ination o f public and private drinking w ater supplies is prim arily concentrated on bacterial transport to source w ater reservoirs. Bacterial m ovem ent tlnough the subsurface environm ent has captured the attention o f public health agencies and is recognized as a tlrreat to w ater quality and hum an health. Although the focus o f research in the past few years has been on a small num ber o f bacteria {Escherichia coli and Salmonella), several other types are o f genuine concern to public health (see Table 2). The study o f organism s such as Escherichia coli has allowed researchers to focus on specific traits o f bacterial behaviour. For example, W illshaw et al. (1994) showed that low num bers o f Escherichia coli 0157:H7 entering drinking w ater can still be hazardous due to a low infective dose. Because Escherichia coli is often used as an indicator for soil and well w ater quality, this research is significant in identifying the conditions that abate bacteria in nutrient application (W illshaw et al. 1994)

67

A ccording to Strauch (1991), the type o f bacteria isolated w ill vary w ith the geographical location o f the agricultural operation and the animal species. As discussed in section 3.3.1, the physical and chem ical com position o f m anure used as a nutrient m ay determ ine the type o f pathogen present (Strauch, 1991). It is the com position and concentration o fh a c te iia contained w ithin the w aste m aterial, along with several otherenvironm ental factors w hich will determ ine the ultim ate fate o f the organism .

Sinton et al. (1996) revealed tliat the principal attenuating factors o f bacterial abatem ent and transport are filtration, adsorption, and inactivation. Inactivation rates differ betw een species and appear to decrease for adsorbed cells, b u t increase w ith high levels o f antimicrobial activity or low soil w ater levels (Sinton et al. 1996). As discussed in section 3.3.4, bacterial m ovem ent is restricted by soil pore size. In fact, G riffen and Quail (1968) found that soil pore size is so im portant to overall abatem ent tliat there is little bacterial dispersal below a pore neck radius o f 1.5 um for bacterial cells o f 0.5 um in diam eter (w hich m ay be seen in soils which are rich in clay particles).

A lthough m ost bacteria have some type o f self-propulsion m echanism (flagella, pili), bacteria dispersal by their own m otility in soil w ater films is generally very restricted in distance traveled (Dighton et al. 1997). In fact, D ighton et al. (1997) showed that the largest recorded distance m oved by self-propulsion was 60 m m p er day w hile the average distance is m ore likely below 10 mm per day as reported b y W ong and G riffen (1976). Obviously, th e m otility o f bacteria will likely hinge on the saturation content o f the subsurface as m obile m echanism s require fluid environm ents in order to be transported. In dryer environm ents, m otility m echanism s such as use o f flagella will have little, if any im pact on transport.

3.3.5 A ctinom ycetes A ctinom ycetes exist predom inantly in soil as spores, w hich are tolerant o f prolonged starvation and desiccation (W ellington et ah, 1990). It is as spores that dispersal is m ost likely to occur under the sam e conditions and constraints as bacteria (Dighton et ah; 1997). W ang et al. (1989) show ed that m odified strains o f Streptom yces lividans could sui-yive in non-sterile soil for 30 days as both spore and m ycelia inoculants, h u t som e inoculated spores w ere able to suiwive at least 10 m onths (Dighton et al., 1997). A ccording to research perfom ied b y R uddick and W illiam s (1972), surface characteristics and structure o f A ctinom ycetes will b e the detennining factors in how far the spore m ay be dispersed in the subsurface environm ent (Digliton et ah, 1997). For example, a single smooth spore o f M icrom onospora sp. is m uch m ore likely to be m oved dow nwards by percolating w ater than the spiny-sheathed spore chains o f S.viridochrom ogenes as the surface characteristics o f S.viridochroinogenes w ould likely prevent m ovem ent through tight pore spaces. A ctinom ycetes are not considered a significant public health concern. T heir distribution through the environm ent is varied and research focusing on their survival and transport in the subsurface is sparse. 3.3.6 Fungi The transport and survival o f ftmgi in the environm ent can only be m odeled as spores, w hich will behave sim ilarly to bacteria. Fungal spores are larger than bacteria (2200 um diam eter) and are therefore m ore easily retained by soils w ith small pore spaces (Dighton et ah, 1997). In undisturbed (non-tilled) soils, die vertical m ovem ent o f fungal spores is n o n ually lim ited (cm), b u t m ay increase w here tillage o f topsoil takes place and small vertical (20-30 cm) and larger horizontal m ovem ents occur or w here large m acropores are prevalent (D ighton et ah, 1997). H ow ever, deep spore transport does not nonually take place as the size o f the spore usually inhibits vertical m ovem ent.

T he soil environm ent and conditions w ithin it p lay a m ajor role in the com position and m icrobial m akeup o f the subsurface, including those soils that contain fungus. F or exam ple, as soils becom e m ore acidic and less disturbed, organic residues accum ulate favoring fungal grow th over bacteria (D ighton et ah, 1997). In general, tillage redistributes fungal propagates vertically in the ploughed layer (D ighton et a l.

69

1997). T illing and otlier agiicultural practices add to tlie horizontal dispersal o f fungal spores via displacem ent o f soil particles. Overall, fungal species play a sm all role in tln eatening w ater sources, as deep subsurface transport is unlikely due to th eir large size. 3.3.7 Protozoa U nlike A ctinom ycetes and fungal spores, protozoa play a significant role in w ater potability and p u b lic health. The activity o f protozoa, like other m icroorganism s is closely related to soil m oisture conditions (Bam forth, 1988). Like bacteria, increased m oisture levels in the subsurface lead to increased transport o f protozoan species. Soil pore size will also affect their distribution as flagellates and small am oebae can occupy pore spaces dow n to 8 u m in diam eter and thus could b e m ore im portant vectors in com pacted soils (D ighton et al., 1997).

From a public health perspective, protozoa play a significant role in disease transm ission, especially w here the dissem ination o f C iyptosporidium p a vru m in the environm ent is a possibility. O ocysts o f O yp to sp o rid iu m pavrum are o f p articular concern in clim ates w here environm ental conditions are unstable and tem peratures are colder because oocysts are hardy and can w ithstand a variety o f stresses. F lem ing et al. (1997) reported that once applied on the soil, oocysts are capable o f sui-viving fo r long periods o f tim e (in excess o f 100 days). Furthennore, F lem ing et al. (1997) show ed that oocysts could survive for long periods o f tim e (up to several m onths) in tap w ater, river water, and in liquid cattle m anure (slu n y ). It w as also found that com posting w as effective at rendering oocysts non-viable w here tem peratures typically reach from 30 to 50 degrees C elsius (Flem ing et al. 1997). H owever, in tem perate conditions, average tem peratures rarely reach the extrem e conditions found in com posting. F lem ing et al. (1997) showed that desiccation (drying) w as 100% effective at killing the oocysts in less than 4 hours.

In the aqueous stage (s lu m es), oocysts are m ore easily transported over th e soil surface and not subjected to filtering effects in passing through the soil profile. T he breaking o f m acropores in soil h elp s to slow w ater transport through the p rofile o f the soil and hence transport o f any organism in the water. This increases the so il's

70

opportunity to absorb organism s (Flem ing et al. 1999). G razing o f anim als (particularly cattle) on recently treated pasture adds additional concern, especially w here anim al infection and shedding rates are high. A ccording to Strauch (1991), m any p arasitic infections o f farm anim als are transm itted b y ingestion o f infective m aterials, including pasture contam inated w ith faeces. D issem inated faeces are a concern not on ly as potential tlireats to subsurface transport, b u t in particular for horizontal transport in surface runoff. A s reported b y F lem ing et al. (1997), an assum ed source o f C iyptosporidium is agricultural runoff, including overland ru n o ff from m an u re storages and feedlots, ru n o ff from fields receiving livestock m anure and livestock m anure entering stream s as a resu lt o f defecation in or near stream s. Overall, it is the hardiness and stability o f the oocysts in the environm ent w h ich is its m ost favorable attribute to prolonged viability. L ittle research has show n the potential for the organism 's vertical transport capability. Rather, m ost studies o f C iyptosporidium pavrum have focused on the fate o f and capability o f the oocysts to be transported horizontally in in n -o ff events. 3.3.8 H eterogeneity o f soils Research on the transport o f particles through soil is n o t sim ply the study o f a single elem ent, variable, o r factor that acts to contribute to or restrict particle m ovem ent. Rather, it is the heterogeneity o f soil environm ents w here several variables and factors contribute to soil stm cture, function and aid in the dispersion o r restriction o f m icrobes. Several m odels o f particle flow (in particular m icroorganism s) have been developed to predict the transport o f a particle as it enters the subsurface envirom nent. M odels in abatem ent and transport theory have been developed and tested using field setting plots or reconstituted soil structures in laboratories. M uch o f the heterogeneity o f the original soil samples, including m acropores, native soil m icroorganism s and plant root cham iels (D ighton et al, 1997) has been rem oved in past and present studies. H ow ever, it is likely that these variables will be key in explaining the extent o f the dispersal or restriction (D ighton et al, 1997). Rather, m ore recent studies have used `in-tact' soil sam ples w hich m im ic subsurface settings m ore efficiently.

71

D espite the fact that colloids and m icrobes are subject to the sam e physochem ical phenom ena as are colloids, there are a num ber o f strictly biological p rocesses th at affect the transport o f m icroorganism s differently than colloids (tem poral changes in surface properties due to changes in m etabolic state; predation b y other substrate organism s) (G inn et al. 2002). In m o st dispersal and abatem ent m odels, the im portance o f heterogeneity in natural soils (vertical stratification, root channels, soil fauna burrow s) is usually excluded (D ighton et ah, 1997). It is th e heterogeneity that dictates th e fate and disposition o f m icrobes after they are introduced to the subsurface environm ent. T herefore, is th e heterogeneity o f the subsurface envirom nent a lim itin g factor in predicting m icrobial transport? R ecent research focusing on stochastic m odels o f particle distribution and m icrobial m ovem ent (see section 4.4) has exam ined this relationship. H ow ever, m odeling stochastic-geom etric m icrobial processes is still in its infancy stages and has yet to b e proven reliable at the field level (see section 4.4).

3.4 Discussion --Key findings in Pathogen Abatement and Transport Research
D ue in m ost part to public health concerns and w ater safety initiatives, m ost subsurface abatem ent and transport research has focused on bacteria, viruses and protozoan m icroorganism s as they are know n threats to groundw ater sources and public health. D espite significant transport research, the diversity o f the subsurface environm ent, along w ith th e interactions betw een the subsurface and various environm ental factors h as raised questions am ong researchers w ho look to a single variable w hich w ill have the `greatest observed effecf on transport. This diversity and environm ental interaction has proven to be especially difficult for those w ishing to develop generalized transport m echanism s for a specific organism o r gi'oup o f organism s. R ather than focus on several environm ental and m icrobial factors (variables), m ost studies isolate individual variables (pH, tem perature) to obseiwe th e ir affect on a controlled environm ent. T he m ajority o f the experim ents are perform ed in laboratory settings to control for factors that m ight lim it results in actual settings. H ow ever, it is the uncertainty in the natural environm ent that adds to the com plexity and diversity o f the system .

72

Several researchers h av e identified general principles that help the research com m unity to draw conclusions based on factors that either aid or im pede transport, especially w here bacteria, viruses and protozoa are concerned (see T able 3).

The factors found to m ost influence m icrobial abatem ent and transport in th e subsurface environm ent include surface and subsurface tem peratures, soil m oisture content and rainfall intensity, presence o f indigenous bacteria, soil com position and soil structure, soil

73

pH, porosity and presence o f plants and m acropores, and topography o f the land (horizontal m ovem ent).

A lthough these factors are im portant in understanding subsurface transport, it is essential to consider the concept o f m icrobial viability in order to estim ate the fate o f m icroorganism s. As viability o f the organism s in the subsurface increases, the potential for transport too increases. F or exam ple, w here cyst form ation is an available com ponent o f physiological structure {Giardia lamhlid), transport opportunities are increased, especially w here environm ental stresses (extrem e tem peratures) are p art o f the ecosystem . W hile other organism s m ay becom e inactivated, protected organism s m ay persist and be transported.

T he subsurface environm ent is extrem ely diverse. The im portance o f environm ental diversity and the m ultiplicity o f interacting variables is key to the understanding o f m icrobial abatem ent and transport. U ltim ately, the heterogeneity o f the subsurface environm ent is the governing factor in m icrobial transport. U nderstanding and quantifying the influence o f heterogeneity on the process o f virus transport is im portant since soil heterogeneity controls transport processes (velocity, filtration) by the natural existence o f pores, cracks, and preferred channels as well as barriers to (m icrobial) m ovem ent (M axw ell et al., 2003).

N utrients (especially nutrients o f animal origin) differ in chem ical and biological com position and are extrem ely diverse. Issues such as animal health, nutrient storage m ethods, environm ental application conditions (and frequency) add to the com plexity o f predicting m icrobial subsurface transport. F o r exam ple, research from G oss et al. (2001) looked at transport o ïE .c o li 0157:H 7 through soil. It w as found that continued research on m an u re m anagem ent in relation to pathogens is clearly required. T here are clearly gaps in know ledge surrounding the shedding o f E .coli 0157:H7, particularly on the basis o f seasonality along w ith th e influence o f diet and dietary changes o f agricultural anim als. Goss concluded that the developm ent o f vaccines to prevent the colonization o f cattle b y A.co/z 0157;H 7 needs to b e com pleted (G oss et al. 2001). B esides animal

74

interactions, other environm ental contributions such as w eather conditions and hum an interactions (the use o f pesticides and other agricultural practices) will add to either im pede or encourage transport capacities. 3.4.1 G ap A nalysis -P ath ogen T ransport Research D espite th e num ber o f studies, several gaps in research have been identified that w ould likely help in pathogen abatem ent and nutrient m anagem ent. For exam ple, adhesion and detachm ent processes o f m icrobes to particulates, the m etabolic effects o f m icrobial transport, the role biofilm s in subsurface transport and the role o f surface properties (bacteria and viruses) on transport are rarely exam ined in current research.

B y m inim izing the num ber o f variables in the studies, researchers are able to isolate changes in environm ents and hypothesize how such variables will affect the entire system. H ow ever, in the natural environm ent, single variables or sudden changes ate not likely to affect the system to a great degree. Rather, it is the relationship betw een all subsurface particles (along with buffering capacities o f ecosystem s) that will determ ine the m icroorganism 's ultim ate fate.

The general lack o f predictability o f factors has led several authors to question how current research is perform ed. As authors such as M aw dsley (1995), D ighton et al. (1997), and G inn et al. (2002) have shown in their research, factors affecting subsurface transport do not act alone. In fact, m icrobial and environm ental factors are influenced by one another. F o r example, an ecosystem with increased m oisture and sandy soils will likely have a relatively stable pH, and as a result, increased particulate and m icrobial flow. H ow ever, i f the pH level o f the system were to change (due to environm ental conditions or other factors), there w ould still be little change in overall particle catchm ent due to total soil porosity and m oisture events.

In order fo r effective transport m odels to be developed, m odels m ust account not only fo r environm ental and m icrobial diversity, but the relationships betw een variables, which m ay change depending on environm ental and subsurface characteristics. Transport m odels m ust account for how m icroorganism s enter the environment.

75

Transport m odels that study the transport characteristic o f a single organism are unrealistic as m icroorganism s usually enter the subsurface attached to some other m atter (soil particles). R ealistically, m icroorganism s are transported in colloids and films (or clumps), rather than as single entities, w hich act alone. M odels should account for this phenom enon b y accounting for film s and clumps o f m atter w hich enter a subsurface environm ent. 3.4.2 T h e New O ntario L andscape The gap b ù w e e n rural and urban interfaces in O ntario is closing. A s large-scale com m unity developm ent and urban sprawl continue, dense populations are increasingly surrounding agricultural operations and incurring associated problem s. For example, odour concerns and potability o f drinking w ater continue to dom inate com munity concerns, especially w here agricultural operations are surrounded b y dense housing developments. Shared w ell-w ater system s and aquifers are stressed, not only by intensive agricultural operations, b u t also by constraints from grow ing com munities. In addition, the num ber o f anthropogenic sources o f viruses such as septic systems, leaking sewers, animal farm ing operations, riverbank filtration, and the practice o f artificial recharge o f treated w astew ater has grow n due to population increases (M axwell et al., 2003). In turn, these activities have led to increased virus loading to several aquifers used as drinking w ater sources. R elated to this effect o f urban sprawl and the hum an perturbations that accom pany it are physical changes in `sensitive' aquifers that m akes them m ore conductive to virus transport (M axw ell et al., 2003).

Control o f pathogenic organism s begins with source-w ater protection activities to prevent faecal contam ination o f aquifers and wells. A ccording to M acler and M erkle (1999), these include assessm ent o f w ellhead vulnerability to faecal contam ination o f aquifers and correction o f identified deficiencies (M acler & M erkle, 1999). As detection m ethods im prove, the list o f identified pathogens in the subsurface environment, including drinking w ater sources w ill increase. Hundreds o f pathogens in the subsurface, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa are know n threats to hum an public health and will continue to b e in the future.

3.5 Conclusion
There are several studies in subsurface pathogen transport research which point to the diversity and com plexity o f soil matrices. C om plexity poses a problem for researchers w ishing to create general transport m odels. Since the behaviour o f all m icroorganism s cannot be accurately predicted and since gaps in m icrobial transport have b een identified, it is difficult to develop m icrobial policy w hich is capable o f abating all pathogens until gaps have been addressed.

Several environm ental and microbial variables gam er m ore attention in abatem ent and transport research because o f their ability to influence m icrobial m ovem ent. They include the effects o f surface and subsurface tem peratures, soil m oisture content and rainfall intensity, presence o f indigenous m icroorganism s in the environm ent, soil com position and soil structure, agricultural practices, soil pH, porosity and presence T plants and macropores and the topography o f the land. Similarly, as it is unlikely single organism s will be transported through the environm ent, it is im portant to look at particle m ovem ents through the subsurface as m icroorganism s will likely attach to other matter. The governing factors o f particle m ovem ent through the subsurface include the physical and chem ical properties o f the particle, physical and chemical properties o f m ovem ent, environm ental and m icrobiological factors, and existing subsurface conditions.

Though it is poorly understood how factors affecting m icrobial transport interact, it is clear in existing research that the interaction betw een organism type and soil particles is key to determ ining the fate o f the organism. The diversity o f subsurface environm ents is also significant for m anagem ent purposes as are nutrient and soil analyses.

Chapter Four: Models of Subsurface Survival and Transport
T he laws o f biophysics and biochem istry govern the conceptualizations o f m icrobial m ovem ent in the subsurface environm ent. In order for m odels and studies to realistically sim ulate the transport o f m icroorganism s, an understanding o f th e laws o f particle m ovem ent in the subsurface envirom nent is essential. V iable organism s introduce additional variables to predictive exercises, including subsurface transport m odeling. N ot only m ust the researcher conceptualize the transport pathw ay the organism will take, but m ust also determ ine i f environm ental conditions favour viability o f the species. It is this interaction betw een environm ental conditions and m icrobial factors w hich will determ ine a m icroorganism 's ultim ate fate in the subsurface environment.

M odeling pathogen transport is a sophisticated process involving know ledge in several scientific and m athem atical disciplines. R isk analysis and risk assessm ent skills are essential to m odeling transport m echanism s. Q uantitative risk assessm ent addresses the translation o f pathogen concentrations to certain effects (health effects) which are observed (Tennis & H avelaar, 2002). The estim ation o f risks involved in the transport (or abatement) o f m icroorganism s and various other particulates in the environm ent is com plex and involves an extensive set o f factors. Environmental, physical, chemical, and biological factors are all relevant aspects w hich m ust b e included in transport models. If a single factor is ignored, m odels m ay be found to be inconclusive and low in predictive ability. In general, the m ore param eters considered in a model, the greater potential the model would have for producing relevant transport predictions (M aier et al. 1999).

It is im perative that m odel developers gauge potential risks and either incorporate or dism iss potential factors o f having relevance to transport and flow. The process o f determ ining the relevance o f such risks is an arduous process involving extensive research in pathogen m ovem ent and interaction in the subsurface v ia experim entation. Ultimately, it is the risk o f hum an harm caused b y pathogenic organism s that enter source drinking waters that policy m akers attem pt to prevent. However, only through the abatem ent o f pathogens through the subsurface environm ent can the risk b e m itigated and

78

controlled for. B y utilizing m icrobial transport m odels in specific environm ents where contam inants (m icroorganism s via animal nutrients) are distributed into the subsurface environm ent, one can theoretically estim ate the risk to source waters and protect against the threat accordingly. If not, protection measures m ust b e taken in order so that pathogen loads are decreased and risks to source waters are mitigated.

A ll subsurface m icrobial transport models take different approaches in risk analysis and assessm ent but have m any similarities in m odeling and m echanistic approaches. The predictive nature o f the models, although prognostic, is essential in nutrient m anagem ent planning. D espite difficulties associated with m onitoring the subsurface environm ent, several researchers have attempted to tackle the task o f creating models o f m icrobial transport (M urphy & Ginn, 2000; Zysset et ah, 1994; H om berger et ah, 1992; M urphy et ah, 1997; Li et ah, 1996; Zhang, 1997; W u et ah, 2003; AguiiTc & Haghighi, 2003; D illon & Fauci, 2000; Sun et ah, 1999). These models are predom inantly reactive transport and stochastic-geom etric models. Reactive transport models are no m ore than a collection o f process representations (physical, chem ical, and biological) o f varying accuracy and sophistication that are used to describe the transport o f a m icroorganism in a coupled dynam ic system. Stochastic-geom etric m odels bring forward the com plexities o f the subsurface environm ent and model the transport o f microbes through heterogeneous settings. Both reaction-transport and stochasticgeom etric m odels are examined further in sections 4.3 and 4.4.

4.1 Risk Analysis and Risk Assessment in Microbial Transport Modeling
The concept o f risk is critical to nutrient m anagem ent and m icrobial transport modeling. As environm ental, m icrobial, and physical factors vary to some degree in each environment, risks, which threaten source waters, vary significantly. The estim ation o f such risks in the subsurface environm ent allows for variation in m anagem ent techniques that aid in or im pede m icrobial m ovem ent. M anagem ent practices are intended to discourage rapid m icrobial transport and encourage abatement. A ccording to Crane & M oore (1985), in order to protect surface and groundw ater sources from enteric bacterial pollution, m anagem ent practices m ust be based on sound know ledge o f th e fate o f these

79

organism s in the environm ent. H owever, unless risks are estim ated and projected adequately, tlrreats to source w aters rem ain high w here m icroorganism s enter the subsurface environm ent. There is considerable research on the factors affecting m icrobial transport in the subsurface environm ent. H ow ever in m any cases, the research has been found to be inconsistent. F or exam ple, if all factors affecting m icrobial transport w ere easily quantifiable (and available), the creation o f a `pathogen index' w ould be a m anageable task. T he trouble w ith m any o f the studies to date is that only single factors have been tested experim entally to m easure their effect on the system. However, single factors rarely have an effect on the entire subsurface system and hence, m icrobial transport. Rather, it is the com plex interaction betw een environm ental, physochem ical and biological processes that detennines the ultim ate fate o f the organism .

Other difficulties in research stem from technological factors that prevent researchers from readily identifying organism s and their interactions in the subsurface environment. A ccording to W hite et al. (1998), the assessm ent o f m icrobes and their insi tu interactions in various environm ents (including subsurface environm ents) is a m ajor problem that requires the application o f non-traditional methods. For exam ple, it has been repeatedly doeum ented in literature that viable, or direct counts o f the num ber o f bacteria attached to sedim ent grains are difficult to establish and m easurem ent m ay grossly underestim ate the extent o f the existing com m unity in a sam ple (W hite et al. 1998). Pathogenic m icroorganism s m ay be inactivated in the subsurface (or surface) over time such that, even if physically detected in groundwater, they are incapable o f causing infection. The rate o f this inactivation is organism -specific and highly influenced by subsurface physical and chemical conditions (M acler & M erkle (1999). V ariability in environm ental conditions m ust be accounted for in experim ents and transport studies, as the subsurface is not a closed entity. Rather, conditions change and effectively, so do the transport characteristics o f organism s. As a result, m odels m ust be extensive enough that fluctuating values may be computed w ithin the m odel to provide a single value o f risk. Such values o f risk would be invaluable in agricultural settings

80

where estim ation o f risk to sensitive sources (aquifers) is crucial to hum an and animal health.

A ccording to Zw ietering & G erwen (2000), risk analysis is a process which scientifically evaluates the probability o f occun ence and severity o f know n or potential adverse effect(s). A ccording to Zw ietering & G e m e n (2000), the risk analysis process consists o f four steps, w hich include; (i) hazard identification (ii) exposure assessm ent (iii) hazard characterization (iv) risk characterization

H azard identification is the identification o f (those factors) w hich are capable o f causing adverse effects, or in the case o f pathogen m anagem ent, those organism s which are capable o f being transported through the subsurface envirom nent. Exposure assessm ent is the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation o f the likelihood that the biological agent will reach a selected distance or objective location. H azard characterization is the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation o f the nature o f the adverse effects associated with the cause. In health risk assessm ent, tliis step estimates the dose-response relationship. In pathogen m anagem ent, hazard characterization would vary depending on the type o f m icroorganism being studied and the virulence o f that microbe. R isk characterization is the qualitative and/or quantitative estimation o f the probability o f occurrence o f a biological agent reaching a location and an estimate o f the consequences (Zw ietering & G eiw en, 2000). R isk characterization is detennined by estim ating the likelihood o f an event o ccu m n g and o f people b ein g exposed. In microbial subsurface transport studies, risks are m ore easily determ ined where m odels are used. Together, these four steps com plete the risk assessm ent process. 4.1.1 Sensitivity A nalysis, U ncertainty and V ariability A lthough unavoidable, uncertainty m ust be accounted fo r and m ay ultim ately alter risk assessm ent calculations in m odeling. The issue in risk assessm ent m odels is accounting for uncertainty and variability as sources o f vaiiation in model param eters

81

(Nauta, 2000). Second-order m odeling, involving the separation o f uncertainty and variability o f m odel param eters, is im portant in several fields o f risk analysis (Nauta, 2000). A ccording to N auta (2000), `uncertainty' represents the lack o f perfect know ledge o f a param eter value w hich m a y b e reduced by further m easurem ents. V ariability, on the otlier hand represents a true heterogeneity in the population that is a consequence o f the physical system and irreducible by additional m easurem ents. It is expected that any m odel o f m icrobial transport, due to lim itations in experimental research, w ill have a high level o f uncertainty and variability entrenched in its calculations and m echanistic m ake up. In other words, w hen th e nature o f the probability distribution o f a m odel param eter is not clear, it m ay be better to im precisely assign a param eter as uncertain than to not separate them at all (Nauta, 2000).

A ccording to Z w ietering & Gerwen (2000), it is im possible to determ ine risks with high accuracy due to m any inaccurate and unknow n aspects. Such variability, especially in the subsurface environm ent, is expected. H owever, w ith sensitivity analysis tools, such uncertainty can b e better managed. Sensitivity analysis is used as an effective tool w hich detennines the relevance o f variations o f factors (Zw ietering & G em en , 2000). The three stages o f sensitivity analysis include; (i) (ii) "D etenninistic analysis" - which selects the m ost relevant detenninants o f risk "W orst Case A nalysis" - which finds relevant process steps in w orst-case situations, and show s relevance o f variations o f risk. (iii) " Stochastic A nalysis" - w hich studies the effects o f variations o f factors for the variability o f risk estimates. (Zwietering & Gerwen, 2000).

Often, the trend in research is to utilize a "worst case analysis" so that all risks are accounted for. H owever, it is this `oveiprotection o f values', which often overestim ates risk o f a particular variable w ithin the model. A ccording to Coleman (2003), m ost predictive m icrobiological m odels represent w orst-case situations that m ay introduce system atic biases and result in an overestim ation o f risk. Such oveiprotection o f values underm ines the puipose o f m icrobial transport m odeling w here the goal for risk assessors

82

should b e developing reliable m odels. The goal o f a nutrient m anagem ent strategy w ould be to incorporate a system w here w orst-case scenarios along with average conditions are accounted for.

W herever possible, all uncertainty should be rem oved so as to rem ove any identifiable bias. W here uncertainty becom es a necessary part o f the m odel concept, it must b e accounted for w hen calculating overall instability o f the system . Several methods are used to decrease and discourage uncertainty. F or exam ple, w hen one knows the m ean and stochastic distribution o f all factors (after repeated experim entation), it is possible to perfo n n a M onte-C arlo sim ulation in order to determ ine overall uncertainty. In a M onte-C arlo sim ulation, a large num ber o f sim ulations are earned out w here, for each sim ulation and for every input factor, a sam ple is draw n from its distribution. The distribution in the outcome o f the risk calculation then gives a realistic probability distribution o f the risk. A M onte-C arlo analysis can be used as a type o f sensitivity analysis so as to find the m ost relevant effects, but cannot b e used to determ ine a realistic uncertainty (Zw ietering & G erwen, 2000).

A ccording to Lam m erding & Fazil (2000) the m odeling o f com plex system s (such as the m odeling o f subsurface m icrobial transport) requires som e sim plification and the use o f assum ptions as all inform ation in m any cases is unavailable or not possible to produce. Every effort should be m ade to validate the results produced b y a model, preferably against independent observed data if such data are available in other studies.

4.2 Models
One o f the main objectives o f predictive subsurface m icrobiological research is to develop m odels, including m icrobial subsurface transport m odels w hich are reasonably predictive, w ithout bias or uncertainty, and governed by the laws o f science. Transport m odels are sim plified representations o f reality, taking into account the m ain effects, and even fo r these m ain effects, the m odels are not exact (Zw ietering & G erw en, 2000). A ccordingly, there is m ore or less inaccuracy in the prediction. H ow ever, transport m odels are useftil tools to quantify the kinetic processes and to determ ine the order o f

83

m agnitude o f th e outcom es (Z w ietering & Gerw'en, 2000). A ccording to W alls & Scott (1997), m icrobiological transport m odels are used to predict the growth, survival and inactivation responses o f m icroorganism s to different environm ental conditions. M icrobial transport m odels can b e u sed to predict the m ovem ent o f both incorporated and in situ m icroorganism s in the subsurface environm ent, along w ith the fate o f the organism . M ore often than not, the processes o f h ansport and the process o f m icrobial fate go hand-in-hand.

D eveloping a transport m odel which attem pts to replicate (or predict) the p ath o f an organism as it enters th e subsurface environm ent involves several disciplines in science, including biology, chem istry, and physics. C oupled together, the interactions betw een the disciplines involve physical-chem ical and biological processes. H ow ever, according to G inn et al. (2002), there is not necessarily a clear distinction betw een processes that are physical-chem ical and biological. In fact, m any processes im portant to m icrobial transport are tenned 'physio -ch em ical-b io lo g icaf phenom ena (the effects o f cell-surface m acrom olecules on bacterial partitioning and adhesion) (Giim et ah, 2002). These effects, along with their interaction with environm ental conditions com bine to either aid in or abate the transport o f organism s in the environm ent.

The am ount subsurface m icrobial transport inform ation available in studies and experim ents is extensive. M odeling o f m icrobial transport tlnough the subsurface environm ent is com plex. H ow ever, the flow o f m icrobes is sim plistic in term s o f predicting the basic processes o f m ovem ent and m icrobial fate (see Figure 4.1). Crane and M oore (1985) showed using th eir own transport m odels that the use o f predictive m odels is helpfrd in organizing large quantities o f data from diverse sources m forecast enteric organism populations in soil and w ater system s. D eveloping transport m odels is just as im portant as testing the ineffectiveness and experim ental perform ance is a necessary com ponent o f the m o deling process. A fter all, w ithout proper experim entation to test theories or predictions, the m odel m ay be considered inconclusive and w ithout credible and necessary justification. D espite the fact that experim ents are necessary for

u sed regularly b y researchers as they are easily accounted fo r and im plem ented into transport m odels.

M o st reactive transport m odels (see section 4.3) incorporate a variety o f physical processes, such as advection, dispersion, straining and physical filtration (G inn et ah, 2002). A ccording to M cG echan & Lew is (2002), sm aller m icroorganism s (viruses and bacteria) are transported (like chem ical constituents) b y adsorption onto otherw ise harm less m obile colloidal clay particles o r soil organic m atter.

U nlike the biological processes, physical processes affecting m icrobial transport have been the focus o f num erous experim ents and num erical m odeling studies (G inn et ah, 2002). Potential im pedim ents to m ovem ent o f colloids through soil can be divided into straining and filtration, depending on w hether a particle has a dim ension greater than pores He iin g to physical trapping) or m uch sm aller. T he task is further com plicated becau se transport m odels m u st account for several sim ultaneous interactions and phases occurring betw een th e organism and subsurface particulates. T he rate o f such processes is further m itigated b y the structure o f th e organism along w ith environm ental conditions (tem perature, pH , m oistu re content) w hich vary in tim e and location. A lthough several studies have been perform ed w hich focus on the attaclrment processes o f m icroorganism s, significant research h as yet to b e determ ined such as the role o f extracellular polym eric substances (EPS) in attachm ent. A ccording to G inn et al. (2002), no generally accepted quantitative treatm ent o f dynam ic, biologically-m ediated adhesion/detachm ent processes exists to date. Tire kinetics and m echanism s o f such attachm ent process are significant in m odeling m ethods, as th e availability o f 'fre e ', or unattached m icroorganism s is considerable.

Biological processes, such as grow th/decay procedures along w ith survival and chem otactic m echanism s are n o t fully understood or agreed upon in all scientific circles. A ccording to G inn et al. (2002), the biological nature o f these processes presents a challenge for transport m o deling in that one biological m echanism is often dependent on and/or influenced b y another biological m echanism . F or exam ple, chem otaxis, the

86

process b y w hich an organism m oves in response to a chem ical gradient, is a factor in environm ents w ith higher n utrient levels (Ginn et ah, 2002). C hem otactic processes w ould b e significant in environm ents w here anim al nutrients are applied to land. A ccording to B rockm an & M urray (1997), soils and subsurface environm ents can differ dram atically in their rates o f nutrient flux. Soils w h ich receive a large input o f nutrients b y plants and anim als are very dynam ic as a result o f seasonal changes and w here tem perature and m oisture levels fluctuate. In contrast, soils that are nutrient poor, exhibit a 2 to 6 order o f m agnitude decrease in available biom ass (Brockm an & M urray, 1997). This is lik ely to result in significant differences in variability and scale o f m icrobial heterogeneity betw een soils and subsurface sedim ents (Brockm an & M urray, 1997).

M u ch o f the em phasis in subsurface research to date has been on quantitative representations o f either the kinetics o f containm ent degradation o f the physical (or physochem ical processes) that affect the transport o f bacteria in porous m edia, prim arily because th ese issues are m ore tractable to the m icrobiological and hydraulic transport fields (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). A lthough the m ajority o f transport m odels to date have focused on subsurface transport, several m odels exist w hich address surface transport. One such exam ple is the U nited States Environm ental Protection A gency's M odel fo r P rotecting Surface Water R e s e n 'oirs. Ground w ater discharge and surface ru n o ff m odels m ay be u sed to assess the potential im pact o f individual contam inant sources, and to identify w atershed areas w ith the greatest potential im pact on source w ater quality. M odeling can be used in conjunction with source w ater assessm ents to enhance source w ater q u ality protection efforts.

A num ber o f m odels have been developed to assess the im pact o f changing land use on w ater quality. Sim pler m odels require less detailed, site-specific hydrologie inform ation and provide m o re generalized and descriptive output. M ore com plex m odels require m ore extensive input data and provide output w ith greater predictive capability and site specificity. Site-specific output can provide locations o f contam ination sources and yield relatively accurate predictions o f variable flow s and w ater quality at any point in a w atershed (U SEPA , 1997). A lthough not w ithin th e scope o f this study, surface

87

w ater ru n o ff m odels m ay provide valuable inform ation about the origin o f m icroorganism s, as surface ru n o ff m a y deviate from animal nutrient sources.

B ased on consistencies in m icrobial subsurface processes and m echanism s, the follow ing approaches in m odeling m icrobial subsurface transport have b een identified as effective tools in predicting transport pathw ays in the subsurface environm ent. T hey include, reactive transport m odels, stochastic-geom etric approach m odels and advectiondispersion m odels.

4.3 Reactive Transport Models
R esearch over the p ast decade has indicated that there is a close link betw een m icrobiological processes and environm ental conditions (M awdsley et al. 1995., W ang et al. 1996., O gden et al. 2001., D ighton et al. 1997., Cam eron et al. 1997). Environm ental conditions play a role in encouraging transport or prom oting abatem ent o f m icrobes. As conditions change, so do m icrobial phy so chem ical and biological processes. Progress in m odeling m icrobial processes in porous m edia is essential to im prow ng our understanding o f h ow physical, chem ical, and biological processes are coupled in groundw ater, and their effect on groundw ater chem istiy evolution, biorem ediation, and the reactive transport o f contam inants and m icroorganism s (M urphy & G inn, 2000). The processes betw een the m icroorganism and the subsurface m atrix m ake transport o f each m icrobe unique and difficult to predict.

R eactive transport m odels are no m ore than a collection o f process representations (physical, chem ical, and biological) o f varying accuracy and sophistication that are used to describe a coupled dynam ic system (see Figure 4.2). Though a single, allencom passing reactive transport m odel has yet to be accepted, the concepts supporting existing m odels satisfy m any o f the criteria thought by m ost researchers to b e responsible for the transport o f m icroorganism s through the subsurface environm ent. In order to model th e m igration o f a dissolved contam inant in the subsurface, an appropriate governing equation should include th e effects o f the transport processes o f advection and dispersion and the effects o f reactive processes such as adsorption and biodégradation

carbon lim iting environm ents), physical processes likely dom inate transport o f the biom ass in th e system (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). In contrast, in nutiient-rich environm ents such as in contam inated aquifers, field observations consistently indicate a higher level o f biom ass in the aqueous phase indicating different m ethods o f m icrobial transport (or abatem ent) (M urphy and Ginn, 2000).

Physical, chem ical, and biological processes are coupled in groundw ater and their effect on groundw ater-chem istry evolution, biorem ediation, and the reactive transport o f contam inants and bacteria is significant (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). H ow ever, in m any cases, key variables m ay be m isrepresented or rem ain static in value to m im ic laboratory settings and not the settings o f a true subsurface environm ent. M ore often than not, key processes in reaction transport m odels are either poorly understood or lum ped into a single expression o f m ass-transfer rate (M urphy and Ginn (2000).

R eaction rates o f m icrobial interaction w ith subsurface m atter are often taken for granted as a given, static value in m any m icrobial transport m odels. A ccording to M urphy and Ginn (2000), one o f the aspects m ost im portant to m odeling fate and transport in porous m edia is the rate o f the reaction rates. R eacting m ixtures can involve a variety o f individual reactions, each w ith a particular rate and the set o f rates can range from the very slow to the very fast to the instantaneous (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). T he rate o f this reaction is im portant to overall transport pathways as m icroorganism s m ay be slowed o r b e transported easier through the subsurface. 4.3.1 Physochem ical Processes M ost reactive transport m odels that consider m icrobial processes incorporate physochem ical processes such as advection, dispersion, straining, and physical filtration (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). The physochem ical processes are prim arily based on the structure and properties o f the groundw ater flow system and porous m edia. Consequently, m ost reactive transport m odels incorporate som e m ajo r physical processes. These physical processes have been the focus o f num erous experim ental and num erical m odeling studies on colloid and biocolloid research. As outlined in C hapter 3, the m ain physical processes responsible fo r the transport o f m icrobes through the subsurface

90

environm ent include advection, dispersion, straining and physical filtration. M ore com plex m echanism s o f m ovem ent (chem otaxis) that require energy via intracellular m echanism s are biologieal mechanism s. Though im portant in their ow n right, m ost physical processes, specifically the process o f attachment, are influenced by the follow ing factors; (1) Solution ionic strength through the effect on electrostatic forces (Tan et al.

1994^
(2) pH (M aw dsley et al. 1995), and (3) M ineralogy (Fletcher and Loeb, 1979; Scholl et ah, 1990; M ills et ah, 1994).

Physochem ical processes are prim arily based on th e structure and properties o f the groundw ater flow system and porous m edia (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). U nlike the biological processes, physochem ical processes affecting m icrobial transport have been the focus o f num erous experimental and num erical m odeling studies. These im portant processes provide th e fram ew ork for bacterial transport and reaction in porous m edia (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). Quantitative representations o f physochem ical processes are distributed into three categories including, flow processes, transport processes and physical m icrobial attachm ent/detachm ent processes. Physical forces resulting in attachm ent (Brownian, electrostatic, van der W aals forces) are the dom inant m echanism s for partitioning o f biocolloids to solid m edia and have received substantial attention, partly because o f their quantitative tractability (M urphy & Ginn, 2000).

Several physochem ical processes are incorporated w ithin reactive transport models quantitatively. Q uantitative representations are grouped (according to M urphy & Ginn, 2000) into three categories including flow, transport, physical m icrobial attachm ent/detachm ent processes. The laws o f fluid transport that govern flow processes include D a rc y 's Law , along w ith the w ater mass conservation law, w here assumed constants include fluid density and viscosity. Processes governing m icrobial transport processes include solutes and microbes undergoing convective and mass fluxes whereas Stokes law (for descent o f a sphere) is used to represent the pathw ay (vertical m ovem ent) o f an organism (or particle). Physical m icrobial attachm ent/detachm ent processes

91

3 s
incorporate several quantitative representations including (am ong others) physical partitioning between solid and aqueous phases that are governed b y kinetic m odels o f reaction (first or second rate reaction kinetics) (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). 4.3.2 B iological Processes Biological processes are inherently linked through grow th-based m echanism s. G row th kinetics (M onod kinetics) along w ith biodégradation m echanism s plays a significant role in the transport process. B iological processes include com petitive inhibition processes, co-m etabolism , random m otility and chem otaxis, m etabolic lag, m icrobial growth and biodégradation processes (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). Additional biological processes affecting m icrobial transport are expressed through the growth/decay process and include active adhesion/detachm ent, survival, and chem otaxis (M urphy & Ginn, 2000).

The biological processes o f grow th/decay, chem otaxis, predation, physiological adaptation (survival), and adhesion or active detachm ent are characteristics o f the bacterial population and by com parison, have received little attention in field-scale hydrogeologic transport m odels (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). For exam ple, M urphy & Ginn (2000) note that few studies have considered the presence o f cells at various phases, but they have also assumed m icrobial reaction kinetics to be independent o f the phase in which the cell resides. This assum ption m ay not be adequate because cells attached to the solid phase may behave differently from the cells suspended in the aqueous phase. M ore research is required in this realm o f reactive m odeling (specifically biological processes) as it relates to biological processes for m icroorganism s other than bacteria such as viruses and protozoa. 4.3.3 R eaction Transport M odels - Gap A nalysis and R isk A ssessm ent Potential Reaction transport m odels m ay be effective tools in predicting the transport o f microbes in the subsurface environm ent. They incorporate several existing physical, chem ical and biological m echanism s that are required for detailed pathw ay expression. However, reaction transport m odels have significant lim itations (see F igure 4.2). M urphy and Ginn (2000) note that several advances in science will im prove overall efficiency o f

92

reactive m odels. For example, the com plexity o f the biological process requires advances in num erical and theoretical m odeling in order that specific representations m ay b e made. F urther advancem ents in the field o f m icrobial subsurface transport would allow researchers to better understand the processes o f residence tim e (the tim e an organism spends attached to a particle) and how larger groups o f incorporated m icrobial m ass, such as biofilm s interact w ith the subsurface and how the transport o f organisms is affected accordingly.

N o single reaction transport m odel has been developed which takes into account all critical reactions. True, the reaction transport model developed by M urphy and Ginn (2000) does incorporate many o f the key factors involved in the transport and abatement o f m icroorganism s in the subsurface. However, m any o f the processes in the m odel have been proven to have lim itations when biological and physochemical processes were incorporated. For example, the process o f biodégradation is modeled using M onod equation factors. However, as noted by M urphy and Ginn (2000), it is difficult to distinguish the kinetic rates for attached and unattached m icroorganism s. Furthermore, flow processes, such as groundw ater velocity are represented through D a rc y 's L aw and the w ater m ass conservation law. However, limitations in m odeling groundw ater velocity include unknow n m ultiscale variability o f perm eability in the subsurface which m ake m odeling flow processes particularly difficult.

B ased on risk analysis criteria (see section 4.1), the reaction transport model could potentially b e an efficient model for predicting the fate o f a microorganism in the subsurface environm ent (see Table 4). However, until further experimental research takes place and gaps are addressed, it is difficult to establish i f the model could predict the fate o f an organism reliably. Table 4 identifies the key elements in the risk analysis process and com pares them to the key elements incorporated in the reaction transport model.

4.4 Stochastic-Geometric Models
The subsurface environm ent is anything but a uniform and hom ogenous setting. M ixtures o f sands, loam s and clays, inconsistent voids and cracks, air pockets and developm ents o f small m icrobial com m unities add to the diversity and com plexity o f different subsurface ecosystems. In laboratory settings, experiments are created so that repeated testing can be perform ed to ensure consistency o f results. Through consistency in research, m odels m ay be created to reflect findings observed during experim entation. However, in the subsurface environm ent, m odeling has proven to be m ore difficult as the heterogeneity o f the subsurface m atrix along with the variability o f environm ental conditions adds com plexity to the overall m odeling process. V ariability is the com m on denom inator o f all natural phenom ena. V ariability in a property or process o f interest is the observed result o f a spatially heterogeneous pattern (Brockm an & M urray, 1997). V ariability does not exit in isolation. R ather, it is affected by the patterns o f num erous interacting abiotic and biotic properties in the ecosystem (Brockm an & M urray, 1997).

Stochastic geom etric transport m odels attem pt to reproduce the effect o f diverse spatial structures and heterogeneous difficulties. M ost stochastic theories (e.g. Dagan, 1989; Cushman, 1997) for groundw ater flow and solute transport in porous formations are developed under the follow ing assumptions; (1) A steady-state flow w ith no boundaries (or infinite boundaries) (2) A stationary hydraulic conductivity field (3) A uniform m ean velocity and (4) Simple initial conditions for solute plum e, such as point source or rectangular box w ith instant or step release (Wu et al, 2003)

A ccording to Li et al. (1996), stochastic-geom etric m odeling techniques incorporate to varying degrees random w alk, fractal and percolation approaches which act as alternatives to m athem atical and num eric m odels that describe subsurface transport (see figure 4.3). Conceptually, key concepts in random walk, fractal and percolation theories are intuitively associated w ith geom etric features o f the subsurface geophysics and m icrobial growth transport, such as straining flow in porous m edia (see section 3.2.3), pore size (see section 3.2.5), stream lines, fractal networks (see section 3.2.6), m icrobial clusters (biofilm s), m icrobial sizes and m icrobial aggregation (Li et al, 1996).

Random w alks, or Brow nian m otion o f m icrobial processes are the simplest natural exam ple o f a random diffusion process. The random w alk m ethod com es from statistical physics and has long been used in the analysis o f diffusion and dispersion process in porous m edia. Spatial structures play an im portant role in stochasticgeom etric m odeling w here spacing affects m icrobial transport and even m icrobial populations (Li et al, 1996). T he stochastic approach used for derivation o f the largescale transport m odel consists o f four basic steps;

1.

The local governing transport equation is averaged over the ensemble o f soil property realizations.

95

2.

C ross-correlations betw een concentration and specific discharge fluctuations are evaluated analytically and then, th e expressions for the effective transport param eters are developed.

3.

Sim plified linearized equations relating concentration fluctuations to soil property fluctuations are derived.

4.

T he large-scale transport m odel and the effective m acrodispersion param eters are developed.

(A guiree & H aghighi, 2003).

Survival o f subsurface m icroorganism s can involve a num ber o f factors including the m icrobial species involved, tem perature, the presence o f m icrobial com petitors, predators and parasites (bacteriophages) and geochem ical and hydrogeologic conditions (K nox et al., 1993; A bu-A shour et al., 1994). O ver the past decade, several studies have addressed the com plexity o f subsurface heterogeneity and m odeling difficulties. A ccording to Brockm an & M urray (1997), there is the potential fo r a high degree o f m icrobiological heterogeneity in the subsurface. M odels to date have attem pted to use strict m athem atical and num erical techniques to address such factors. So-called `realistic' num erical or m athem atical sim ulations are frequently used in subsurface m odeling. However, they have been found to be extremely com plicated, and in som e cases, difficult to apply because o f severe non-linearity in soil com position. In most cases, these m athem atical m odels cannot reflect the iion-hom ogeneous nature o f subsurface m icrobial system s (Li et al, 1996).

A ccording to Li et al. (1996) advances in m icrobial transport in heterogeneous subsurface media have proven to be im portant in studies o f the spatial heterogeneity o f subsurface chem ical, physical and m icrobial processes. H eterogeneity at different scales is a basic factor that needs to b e considered in m odels o f m icrobial m acrodispension (Harvey, 1991 ; H arvey et al, 1993). The difficulty lies in how such diversity can be placed into a model w ith precision, w hile having flexibility in order to accom m odate different environm ents. N atural environm ents are com plex, and the distribution o f m icrobiological properties results from overlapping spatially non-hom ogeneous

96

distributions o f num erous physical, chemical and m icrobiological properties (and their interactions) that yield patches o f optimal and non-optim al conditions for m icroorganism s m ust be accounted for (B rockm an & M urray, 1997).

In general, natural porous m edia are disordered. R epresenting porous m edia by som ething that is intrinsically ordered (as is the case in several m athem atical and numeric models) seem s inadequate. Statistical hom ogeneity m ay not be sufficient in general cases o f m icrobial transport through porous media. Thus, alternative approaches such as those provided b y stochastic geographic m odels have been sought. In the case o f highly heterogeneous and/or fractured geologic m edia, the selection o f an adequate conceptual model is b y no m eans obvious. The difficulty in m odeling heterogeneous processes is com plicated by the non-linearity o f the governing equations (Li et al, 1996).

97

M any researchers have used tracers to track the m obility o f fluids and particles in the subsurface. B ecause the subsurface contains all 5 m ajor groups o f m icroorganism s (bacteria, actinom ycetes, fungi, algae and protozoa) as w ell as viruses, and because m icrobes exhibit behaviour like death, reproductive predation, species-specific m ethods o f detachm ent to and detachm ent from surfaces and particles, grow th as aggregates or biofilm s, production o f spores w ith distinctly different physical properties and behaviours than active cells and m otility, th e transport o f m icrobes o v er long tim e and space scales is different from that o f innate particles or tracers (Li et al,. 1996).

To understand the process o f subsurface m icrobial transport, th e im portant role o f spatial structures in heterogeneous porous m edia m ust be understood. Spatial structures in heterogeneous porous m edia affect m icrobial m ovem ent and population dynam ics (Li et al, 1996). Transport in random heterogeneous m edia is controlled b y the underlying velocity field w hich in turn is determ ined by the hydraulic conductivity, h ydraulic head, kinem atic porosity, saturation and other factors (Zhang, 1997). Flow properties such as conductivity, head, and saturation levels are usually treated as random functions. Stochastic theories have been developed rapidly during the last two decades to explain single flow -phase transport in saturated m edia (Zhang, 1997). The subsurface environm ent often exhibits a pronounced spatial heterogeneity in physical properties as a result o f the stratified nature o f m any subsurface deposits and the actions o f hydrologie and geochem ical processes over tim e (Brockm an & M urray, 1997). P erhaps the m ost significant elem ent o f stochastic-geom etric model is that it addresses' variability in m icrobial and geophysical processes and attem pts to sim plify them into norm alized equations. 4 .4 .1 S to ch astic-G eo m etric m odels - G ap A n aly sis a n d R isk A ssessm en t O ne o f the purposes o f the stochastic-geom etric m odel is to b rin g forw ard the com plexities o f the subsurface environm ent. O therw ise, m odels such as the advectiondispersion m odel (see section 4.5) w ould be effective as advection-dispersion hinges upon the hom ogenization o f the environm ent. T he effectiveness o f the stochasticgeom etric m odel hinges upon the availability o f research in spatial representation o f pore

98

structures w hich m akes the m odel m ore suitable than other m odels w hich attem pt to predict transport (advection dispersion m odels) In th e case o f highly heterogeneous and/or fractured geologic m edia, the selection o f an adequate conceptual m odel is b y no m eans obvious (Li et al. 1996). A ccording to Li et al (1996), the stochastic-geom etric m odel m ay be m ore suitable than other m ethods because d ata are n o t available for m odels that depend on explicit spatial representation o f pore structures. D espite the m o d el's strength in geom etric structuring and transport flow, the stochastic-geom etric m odel w ould likely serve as an additional support in an all-encom passing m icrobial subsurface transport m odel, w h ich incorporates biological and physochem ical processes as dem onstrated in the reaction-transport m odel concept (see section 4.3).

Clearly, as w ith any m icrobial transport m odel, there are certain gaps (see F igure 4.3) in inform ation that allow for criticism in the m odeling approach. A ccording to W u et al. (2003), calculations used in stochastic m odels are quite sim plistic. F or exam ple, adoption o f a unified flow velocity for a fluid or m icroorganism is clearly not indicative o f w hat actually occurs in nature. A ccording to W u et al. 2003, th e assum ption o f m ean velocity is generally not valid and is only suitable for som e specific regions (or zones) o f the subsurface environm ent.

A ccording to W u et al. (2003), the predictions o f classical theories and m odels m ay significantly deviate from actual field findings. R ecently, som e o f these assum ptions have been relaxed and stochastic m odels are gradually extended to m ore com plicated cases (W u et al, 2003). U ltim ately, it is the predictive capacity o f stochastic m odels that falls victim to the uncertainty o f the subsurface environm ent. D espite the fact that num erical techniques have been im proved drastically, they cannot yield accurate results since effective large-scale (or field-scale) param eters cannot be accurately determ ined (A guiree & Haghighi, 2003). This lim itation o f the standard determ inistic m odeling approaches, especially in th e vadose zone o f the soil horizon, em phasizes the use o f statistical techniques that can incorporate the effects o f natural variability o f soil param eters (A guiree & H aghighi, 2003).

Spatial representation o f pore structures key quantitative variable identified in stochastic m ethods. Intricate m odeling techniques allow for incorporation o f spatial heterogeneity, w hich has been identified b y several authors as the key determ inant in m icrobial transport m odeling. Predictive ability o f th e m odel is unknow n. M ore experim entation and studies are required to test the validity o f the m odel. Stochastic-G eom etric m odel w ould likely serve as an additional support in an all-encom passing m icrobial subsurface transport m odel, w hich incorporates, biological and physochem ical processes as dem onstrated in the reactiontransport m odel concept

A com m on approach in reaction-kinetic, stochastic, and advection dispersion (see section 4.5) m odels is to sim plify values used to describe m icrobial b ehaviour observed in the subsurface environm ent. For exam ple, th e d ie-off rate o f organism s in the subsurface environm ent is norm ally represented using first-order m odel d ie -o ff kinetics. T he first-order m odel appears to accurately describe the die o ff o f bacteria u nder all conditions. H ow ever, the d ie-off coefficient is a highly variable param eter spanning several orders o f m agnitude for any given bacterial type (C rane & M oore, 1985). A lthough not the m ost accurate estim ate, first-order kinetic m odels are used regularly by researchers as they are easily accounted for and im plem ented into transport m odels. N otw ithstanding, stream lining values u sing generalized form ulas is an acceptable and w idely used practice in m icrobiological research. N evertheless, as th e p ractice o f generalizing such form ulations is anything b u t accurate, such inefficiencies should be accounted for.

Tire stochastic-geom etric m odel incorporates a key factor w hich m u st be accounted fo r in all m icrobial transport m odels: heterogeneity. A lth o u ^ r th e predictive capacity o f the entire m odel is unknow n due to a lack o f testing o f th e m odel at the field

100

level, it w o u ld appear that the m odel accounts for spatial particle variability, w hich is a k ey determ inant in m o deling subsurface m icrobial m ovem ent and determ ining risk. Coupled w ith a transport m odel that describes key biological, physochem ical and environm ental variables, the predictive capacity o f the stochastic m odel w ould be im proved w ith experim entation and laboratory research.

4.5 Mass Balance (Advection-Dispersion) Based Transport Models
C ontam inant transport m odels, specifically advection-dispersion m odels and filtration m odels (see appendix 3.1) are often m odified for application to m icrobial transport. Factors th at influence m icrobial transport can b e incorporated into equations governing these m odels. H ow ever, the fundam ental basis o f each m odel differs, and thus, u n d er certain conditions, u se o f a particular m odel or another m odel altogether m ay be preferable (M aier et ah, 1999).

M ost m odels used to sim ulate aqueous-phase m icrobial transport are essentially based on the m ass balance equation (often referred to as the advection-dispersion equation), w hich is m odified b y adding the reaction kinetics such as source/sink term s (Sun et al. 1999). This procedure assumes that m icrobes can be regarded in a m anner sim ilar to dissolved solutes, and hence, the concentration o f the m icroorganism s can b e expressed as their m ass o r num ber per unit volum e o f w ater (Sun et al. 1999).

U nm odified advection-dispersion m odels assum e that the contam inant (m icroorganism ) is in solution and thus has the sam e average velocity as the matrix solution (M aier et ah, 1999). V alues fo r average velocity and dispersion o f a contam inant are generally obtained from conservative tracer tests. These values m ay not be appropriate for m icrobial transport because m icrobes are not dissolved but instead, suspended in the liquid m edium .

D espite th e ir w idespread use, there rem ain several disadvantages to the strict use o f advection-dispersion equations in subsurface m icrobial transport m odels. A vailable m athem atical m odels o f m icrobial transport u sin g the advection-dispersion equation are too sim ple to describe the com plex nature o f field sites, or the natural environment. In

101

m ost cases these m odels cannot reflect the non-hom ogeneous and anisotrophic nature o f subsurface m icrobial system s (Li et al. 1996). The current know ledge o f m icrobial transport h as not reached a stage w here hydronam ic param eters can b e u sed to predict m icrobial transport in porous m ed ia (Germ ann et ah, 1987). A dditionally, advectiondispersion m odels assum e the pathw ay o f a m icroorganism is similar to that o f a particle. This is sim ply not the case in nature (w ith the exception o f viruses). T he intricate m echanism s o f m icrobial transport including behavioral characteristics and attachm ent m ethods to subsurface particulate differentiate them selves from sim ple particle transport.

4.6 M odel Validation
M odeling m icrobial transport in th e subsurface environm ent is relatively new to m icrobiological research. Since science has yet to reveal all the factors involved in the transport o f m icroorganism s in the subsurface environm ent, w e can only assum e m ost m icrobial transport m odels are lim ited in predictive ability. A ccording to O rekes et al. (1994), all scientific know ledge is provisional. A t m ost, w e can aspire to link a particular m odel to a current m odeling practice elsewhere, or to ju stify the m odel by appealing to our best theories o f natural processes, or to ground the m odel on a rich and highly constraining set o f data. A lthough m ost transport m odels are deemed to be inconclusive, the dem and for efficient and accurate m odels increases as the need to protect natural resources is amplified. A ccording to A nderson and Bates (2001), tlie dem and (for m odels) is increasing from p o licy m akers and agencies w here m odelers are under increasing pressure to show th "T long term predictions o f m icrobial fate are `w orthw hile' w hen the real context for such predictions m ay typically include unknow n boundary conditions and lack historical data.

T he greatest difficulty in producing accurate and readily accepted m odels lies in their validation and addressing their gaps (see figure 4.4). The inherent uncertainties o f m odels hav e been w idely recognized, and it is now com m only acknow ledged that the term `v alidation' is an unfortunate one because its root w ord - `valid' --im plies a legitim acy that is n o t justified in transport m odels (A nderson & Bates, 2001). D ue to the com plexity o f the subsurface system along with the lack o f experimental data (which

102

account fo r all processes in m icrobial transport), the idea o f validation is im practical. Inherently, the dem and for validation im plies that the m odel w ill to a certain extent, be precise and ultim ately strong in predictive capabilities.

A ccording to Sarewitz et al. (2000), much o f the dem and fo r model assessm ent derives from the desire to use m odels in a predictive m anner. Furtheraiore, Saraw itz et al. (2000) note that a large num ber o f m odels have been built in response to environm ental problem s - nuclear w aste disposal, acid rain, w ater supply, groundw ater contam ination --w hich involve forecasting the behaviour o f com plex natural systems. However, A nderson and Bates (2001) note that predictions originating from th e m odels are m ore often than not wrong. M oreover, while the num ber o f studies that exam ine the predicti ve accuracy o f model results is m odest com pared to the num ber o f m odels that have b een built, available studies are clear in their results, not enough is know n about

103

com plex natural system s to be able to predict tliem accurately (A nderson & Bates, 2001). U ntil m ore research is perform ed in m icrobiological transport science, predictive models w ill struggle to attain significant scientific validation.

4.7 Discussion - The Nutrient Management Act, Subsurface IVlicrobial Transport Modeling, and B isk Assessment and Analysis.
T he Ontario N utrient M anagem ent A ct (NMA) along w ith other legislation in the Province o f Ontario (O ntario W ater R esources Act, Safe D rinking W ater A ct) is a tool for the agricultural com m unity to protect w ater sources from nutrient contam ination w hether from ground or surface w ater origin. The N M A does not address pathogen reductions directly n o r does it endorse any type o f model or risk analysis or assessm ent tools or techniques w hich will predict the fate o f an organism in th e subsurface environm ent. A nalysis o f bo th m icrobial subsurface transport and m odeling shows that despite gaps, science has advanced significantly over the past 30 years to explain m any o f the relationships betw een pathogens and the subsurface. H ow ever, the province o f Ontario has seem ingly ignored the pathogen threat, instead aim ing to address nutrient concerns directly, and m icrobiological concerns indirectly. Furtherm ore, it is unclear w hy the province o f O ntario has not developed pathogen control legislation.

K ey factors identified both in this study and in m icrobial subsurface transport m odels that affect pathogen survival and transport are not m entioned in the N M A . The N M A does not explicitly address any o f the biological, physochem ical or environm ental issues that have been raised in this ' 'dy. Som e parts o f the N M A indirectly address a num ber o f the issues related to pathogen m anagem ent and transport. They include. Part V I (land application standards). Part V II (outdoor confinem ent areas). Part V llI (siting and construction standards), and Part IX (sam pling analysis, quality standards and land application rates). Future standards and regulations under the N M A are unlikely to address m odeling or risk analysis issues as the scope o f the A ct does not lend itse lf to incorporate such processes. Rather, m any o f the issues in the N M A and other related legislation in Ontario point to preventative m easures (restricting w inter application section 48) w hich decrease risks associated w ith land application.

4.7.1

C hallenges hi Future M icrobial Transport M odeling in the Subsurface

E nvironm ent. W here a m icrobial transport model is applied to a subsurface environm ent to determ ine the risk o f selected pathogens reaching a given point in the soil (such as ground w ater source), extrem e caution m ust be taken when assessing accuracy o f prediction. A ccording to M aier et al. (1999), transport m odels should account for changing conditions that the m icrobe encounters as it m igrates through the terrestrial profile. L aboratory and field studies should be conducted to verify the accuracy o f the conceptual m odels. A ccording to M aier et al. (1999), Corapcioglu and H aridas (1986) introduced a highly com prehensive equation designed to predict m icrobial m ovem ent in soils. In the study, m any factors that influence m icrobial m ovem ent, including survival, chem ical perturbations, clogging and declogging o f the soil, soil m oisture, pH, soil com position, and m icrobial growth potential were taken into consideration. However, the com plexity and expenses associated with running the experim ent prevented the study from obtaining optim um results. Furthermore, although transport m odels can be useful tools, they can also generate predictions that are o ff by orders o f m agnitude (M aier et al., 1999). Therefore, even if all factors and variables in m icrobial transport are accounted for, only m oderate levels o f certainty in risk prediction can be assumed. A num ber o f transport models describe the pathw ay o f m icroorganism s through the subsurface environm ent. The purpose o f this study was to determ ine if microbial subsurface transport m odels could be safely used for pathogen m anagem ent policy. The answ er at this tim e in research is clearly no and therefore, policies based on models are not likely to be seen in the near future in Ontario because o f their lack o f precision and accuracy. U ntil m ore experim ents are conducted and until transport m odelers can develop a com prehensive m odel capable o f incorporating all the relevant factors and variables in the subsurface environm ent, the effectiveness o f subsurface transport models will no doubt be in question. M odels should im itate reality and therefore, the level o f data required to develop an effective model is contingent upon the ability o f it to be valid to w hat actually occurs in the subsurface. A ccording to M aier et al. (1999), increasing

105

com plexity in variables equates to increases in research tim e and expense because several experim ents m ust be conducted in order to generate input data for num erous param eters. In cases w here various param eters are not know n and/or cannot be experim entally determ ined, estimates m ust b e m ade w hich therefore increase the potential for error. A ccordingly, it m akes sense to decide on the transport m odel that w ill b e applied to an environm ental system before collecting data so that appropriate param eters can be m easured w henever possible (M aier et ah, 1999). C ontinuing research is required to strengthen the applicability o f m icrobial transport m odels to realistic environm ents and to aid in risk assessm ent and predictive strategies.

Field and laboratory experim ents dem onstrate that the m etabolic activity o f subsurface m icroorganism s can create a dynam ic distribution o f a m icrobial population betw een aqueous and solid phases in groundw ater systems (M urphy & Ginn, 2000). M odeling studies often sim plify the explicit presence o f bacteria in both aqueous and attached phases, instead treating the biom ass as a fixed, often uniform phase. In reality, bacteria are distributed both in the aqueous and solid phases and this distribution is dynam ic in a contaminant plum e (M urphy & Ginn, 2000).

T he interaction betw een m icroorganism s and their environm ent is unique in that they can form distinctive com m unities, called biofilm s. A n im portant aspect o f microbial processes is the propensity o f cells to adhere to and bind to a surface. The adsorbed cells produce a m atrix o f polysaccharide fibers binding the cells to the surface and to other cells. The structure associated w ith biofilm s m ay be very different in porous m edia (Paulsen et al., 1997). B iofilm s form an essential part o f the porous m edia altering its m icroscale geom etry and chem ical environment. A t the sam e time, substrates are transported from the bulk fluid to the biofilm b y diffusion and advection proce'^es and are consum ed by the cells. Substrates m ay also be em bedded within the soil m atrix itself and diffuse into the bulk fluid or into the biofilm (Dillon & Fauci, 1999).B oth bacteria and viruses m ay inhabit biofilm s, causing variable com m unity structures and interaction.

106

D espite their significance both in subsurface transport and in public health research, viral transport m odeling has been ignored. V iruses are capable o f surviving and traveling lo n g distances in the subsurface environm ent (section 3.3.3). Recent studies carried out to support the United States Environmental Protection A gency's Ground Water Rule (EPA, 1997) have provided further quantitative evidence that confirm s largescale subsurface virus transport can occur (M axwell et al. 2003). T he processes and m echanism s o f viral transport, although well researched, have led to the creation iT few viral transport m odels. Typically, as viruses are sm aller than bacterial or protozoan organism s, they are sometimes grouped together w ith larger organisms despite differences in surface properties and genetic make-up. A ccording to M axwell et al. (2003), m athem atical models o f virus transport in saturated porous m edia typically assum e that viruses represent a class o f subm icron (< 1 um ) particles. The principle processes affecting viral m igration include, advection w ith liquid phase flow, hydrodynam ic dispersion, physical or chemical attachm ent onto the solid phase o f the porous m edium , detachm ent o f the liquid phase, as well as inactivation or die-off in either the liquid or solid phase (M axwell et al. 2003). Based on this research, it is likely that viral m odeling w ould likely b e m odeled effectively via advection dispersion-m odels since advection-dispersion models replicate the flow o f particles in the environment.

V irus transport is usually based on com m only utilized equations for colloid filtration and inactivation in porous m edia and is augm ented by an additional set o f param etric relationships used to correlate filtration effects to aquifer perm eability (M axwell et al. 2003). U nderstanding and quantifying the influence o f geologic heterogeneity on the process o f virus transport is im portant because geologic heterogeneity control processes (velocity, filtration) by the natural existence o f pores, cracks, and preferred channels as well as barriers to virus m ovem ent (M axwell et al. 2003). O bservations by Powell et al. (2003) clearly suggest the influence o f geologic heterogeneity on m icrobial transport. Therefore, in order to m ove forward in microbial subsurface transport modeling, viral-based models should b e produced as separate entities to account for their diversity and interactions in the subsurface environment.

107

4.7.2 U ncertainty and N utrient M anagem ent As this study shows, the accuracy and applicability o f m icrobial subsurface transport m odels for risk assessm ent purposes in nutrient m anagem ent venues are at best, negligible. U nlike other environm ents (atm ospheric), the subsurface environm ent contains num erous factors w hich change the dynam ic o f a m odel for analytical risk analysis purposes. F o r example, in atm ospheric science, researchers can accurately predict the size and shape o f a sm okestack plum e em itted from an industrial stack along w ith the chem ical concentration o f its em issions at a select point along its path. By inputting factors into plum e transport m odels such as wind speed, atm ospheric tem perature, heiglrt o f stack along w ith various other atm ospheric values, one can accurately predict the concentration w ithin a select distance from the point o f em ission. However, due to m icrobial interaction w ith the subsurface, it is extrem ely difficult to develop a sim ple m odel capable o f producing such consistency in subsurface m icrobial science. It becom es almost inconceivable to create a single m icrobial transport model that can predict the location o f a single m icrobe in the subsurface environm ent.

Enhancing the existing control o f pathogens in the environm ent can be accomplished by addressing the follow ing pathogen reduction strategies in agricultural settings: (i) Increasing practices w hich encourage animal health to reduce pathogen shedding strategies and contamination o f young herd. (ii) (hi) U tilizing m ethods o f nutrient pre-treatm ent. Im plem enting `w orst-case' policies in setback distances to increase distances to m axim um levels so that risk o f m icrobial contam ination is reduced to acceptable degrees.

So-called `beginning o f the p ip e' solutions to reduce m icrobial contam ination potential are required for source protection and nutrient m anagem ent. Consequently, risk reduction is achieved and subsurface pathw ay m odels and risk analyses becom e less significant. W hy `beginning o f the p ip e' processes have yet to be im plem ented into provincial legislation is unclear. H ow ever, it is hypothesized that m any o f the processes

108

such as com posting and facility developm ent have high infrastructure costs and therefore, such processes w ould be financially unattainable for m any agricultural operations. 4,7.3 H A C CP, R isk A nalysis, and Subsurface M icrobial T ransport T echnology T he H azard Analysis C ritical C ontrol P oint (HACCP) system is a risk control model capable o f m anaging risks through the m onitoring o f critical points along the process pathway. A H A C CP-based approach has been quite effective in the food industry. Consequently, subsurface transport m echanism s and m odels m ay utilize some experim ental and risk-based m echanism s contained in the H ACCP system. A ccording to H oom stra et al. (2001), m ost H ACCP systems utilize a qualitative-based approach w hen determ ining critical control points (CCPs) in the hazard analysis process. A n im portant aspect o f the H ACCP system is the specification o f criteria (setting o f critical control limits) to ensure that the activities at a specified critical control point are under control (Noterm ans et al. 1994). There are seven steps w hich serve as the foundation for a H ACCP system;

1. Conduct a hazard analysis 2. D eterm ine the CCPs 3. Establish critical control lim its 4. Establish CCP m onitoring procedures 5. Establish corrective actions 6. Establish effective record keeping procedures 7. Establish verification procedures (Sparling et al. 2001).

Test results for the food industry are determ ined in controlled laboratory settings in order to m im ic food preparation settings. This results in a poor underpinning for control m easures. I f controlled laboratory experim ents are used to test activity in an unstable environm ent w here activity is inconsistent (the vadose layer o f the soil), testing may be found to be im practical to produce realistic settings. Laboratory-based studies

are in principle m ore accurate and exact experim ents. A ccording to H oom stra et al. (2001), the result o f the `hazard analysis' aspect o f the H ACCP system is the

109

identification o f control m easures that are essential to (i) prevent contam ination, (ii) prevent unacceptable increase o f contam inants and (iii) reduce contam inants to acceptable levels. Such control measu- es, w hile applicable in controlled settings, m ore often than not are not applicable in environm ents w here m any factors affecting m icrobial transport and viability can change. A lthough several studies o f subsurface transport m echanism s have been perform ed, it is the in-situ based results w hich m ore often than not lead to inconsistent findings, as even the slightest changes in experim ental m ethod can skew results significantly.

A critical control based system (H ACCP) does not provide a quantitative
estim ation o f risk. The H A CCP m odel was not designed to be a predictive m odel for m icrobial fate nor w as it designed to determ ine the extent o f contam ination in a select environm ent. Rather, it is a hazard-based system which attem pts to m itigate risks by controlling the factors w hich contribute to overall risk w ithin the entire system. H A CCP is a control point m odel capable o f recognizing critical control points and achieving critical values at those points. W hile it is clear that there are several unknow ns in the subsurface environm ent and in m odeling the transport o f m icroorganism s in it, the risks that contribute to pathogen loading and contam ination are known to the agricultural industry. Therefore, in order to im plem ent a successful critical control point system in the agricultural sector (specifically those sectors dealing with animal w astes), the industry m ust be seen m ore like a system o f processes (as in the food industry) w hich are consistent throughout the entire nutrient m anagem ent and agricultural industry.

U nlike the food industry, agricultural operations do not take place in a closed environm ent. Food production facilities are controlled environm ents w here pathogen loads will likely fall w ithin predictive ranges as testing (for pathogen loads) o f one product to the next will likely yield sim ilar results. `O utside' factors such as environm ental variables rarely, i f ever, affect the production and H A CCP process. I f unforeseen occurrences take place, critical controls m ay be reassessed or reconfigured to conform to standards set at the select p o in t in the production process. H owever, in the

110

real environm ent, conditions consistently change and are unpredictable depending on global w eather patterns, flooding events, and the like.

In order to develop a critical control strategy for agricultural operations (see Figure 4.5), it is essential that nutrient m anagem ent operations are divided into m anageable segm ents or points o f control. The goal o f a nutrient m anagem ent critical control p oint system w ould be to produce a logical pathogen reduction strategy capable o f reducing risks to a predeterm ined level w here risks becom e so sm all that the likelihood o f source w ater contam ination becom es negligible. In order for hazards to b e controlled, they must first be understood. Processes responsible for rem oval o f m icroorganism s tfom nutrients are both com plex and diverse. Pathogen loads range in value depending on several factors including anim al species, anim al health and diet, animal behaviour and nutrient storage and handling procedures. H owever, levels can be controlled sim ply by im plem enting prim ary control points (`beginning o f p ip e' controls) that aim to reduce pathogen load prior to land application.

Im portant processes in the nutrient m anagem ent pathw ay include (am ong others) (i) nutrient collection, (ii) storage and treatm ent processes and (iii) application methods (see Figure 4.5). In order to observe an overall reduetion in pathogen loading at eaeh step in the process, critical control points m ust be m onitored and controlled w here relevant. A num ber o f critical controls are required for each process/m ethod. For exam ple, nutrient collection w ould include animal health and location o f storage collection. Figure 4.5

111

indicates three critical controls fo r each m ain process along th e nutrient m anagem ent pathway.

M ore science is required to help quantify critical control point processes so that processes and m ethods, regardless o f location and operation are consistent. F o r exam ple, certain anim al w astes are higher in m icrobiological loads. H ow ever, i f treatm ents such as com posting w ere im plem ented, m icrobiological loading rates w ould be insignificant because com posting, i f perform ed correctly, will achieve a tem perature that essentially kills a m ajority o f organism s.

4.8 Conclusion
B iological, physochem ical, and environm ental factors govern the m icrobial m ovem ent o f m icroorganism s through the subsurface environm ent. W hile scientific research has shown a num ber o f relationships betw een m icrobes and elem ents in the subsurface environm ent, m icrobial transport m odels have yet to be established as reliable predictions o f pathogen m ovem ent. As m icrobial transport m odels indicate, taking a conservative approach in m odeling relevant param eters to subsurface m icrobial transport is key. Both reaction and stochastic geom etric transport m odels address several o f the issues that are relevant to m icrobial transport including biological and physochem ical processes. It is the heterogeneity and unpredictability o f variables in the subsurface environm ent that leads to the volatility o f m any transport m odels.

In the nutrient m anagem ent forum , one m ust develop a m odel w hich best encom passes the m ain factors involved in transport and abatem ent. Until research dem onstrates consistency and until sound scientific m odeling principles are em ployed, source w ater protection initiatives m ust rely on alternative m ethods o f reducing pathogenic and contam ination risk. `Beginning o f the pip e' solutions to reduce m icrobial contam ination should be entertained as alternative m ethods o f reducing risk and protecting hum an health.

112

Chapter Five: Alternative Pathogen Management Strategy
A pproaches to source w ater protection are deeply rooted in risk analysis and risk assessm ent initiatives. Chem icals and m icroorganism s that originate from anim al w astes are better controlled w here active participation b y key stakeholders takes place and w here public policy is ro o ted in sound scientific know ledge, engineering principles, and m anagem ent strategies.

Effective n utrient m anagem ent should be governed b y scientific principles founded in m icrobiological science and subsurface m icrobial transport m echanism s. A lthough scientific research has shed considerable light on nutrient m anagem ent and subsurface transport, the literature has yielded inconsistent results. Significant gaps in nutrient research p o in t to unreliable results and a lack o f predictive capacity b y proposed m icrobial subsurface transport m odels. Therefore, until valid and consistent results are observed, m odels can at best serve as standards fo r further research in the field o f m icrobial transport in the subsurface environm ent.

Perhaps the on ly w ay to develop a m anagem ent plan for nutrient m anagem ent system s is to account for and m anage the processes that precede th e introduction o f pathogenic m icroorganism s into the subsurface environm ent. B y decreasing the m icrobiological load in the nutrient m ass, one significantly reduces the chance that organism s will contam inate a potable w ater source. U ltim ately, the goal o f m aintaining public health m ust be a priority for any environm ental m anagem ent strategy.

G eneralized system s in environm ental m anagem ent include H a za rd A nalysis Critical C ontrol P o in t (H A CCP) and IS O I4 0 0 I. These strategies, albeit efficient in several industries and organizations, are only as effective as the param eters and critical controls w hich govern them . It is the identification o f critical controls in the m anagem ent process w hich p resen t the m ost difficulty to those responsible for their developm ent and m aintenance. Setting quantitative param eters for environm ental control is a com plex task considering the variability in the subsurface environm ent and the biological m atter

contained w ith in it. F urtherm ore, a lack

earch focusing on th e processes that

govern m icrobial abatem ent in the subsurface environm ent prevent specific param eters to b e set for critical controls. R ather, general objectives, including operational, procedural, and pub lic health strategies should b e used in an effective nutrient m anagem ent strategy to reduce risk o f m icrobial contam ination in th e subsurface environm ent.

5.1 Critical Factors in a Pathogen Management Strategy
L ik e m any m anag em en t strategies in several industries and operations in Canada, a nutrient m anagem ent p o licy requires a m ultidisciplinary approach in several areas o f scientific research and m anagem ent m ethods. T h e difficulty in developing a nutrient m anagem ent approach lies in determ ining w hich scientific and m anagem ent research is relevant and can b e effectively applied to agricultural policy. A ccording to Sims et al. (1999), agencies responsible for w ater quality protection have sought to integrate (nutrient m anagem ent) research into environm ental policy. H ow ever, they have often b een frustrated b y th e fragm ented and som etim es-contradictory nature o f th e inform ation provided to them .

D ue to the v ariab ility o f the subsurface environm ent and the diversity o f m icroorganism s w hich in habit it, an all-encom passing nutrient m anagem ent strategy should ensure that risks from all potential threats to source w aters are accounted for and controlled. T he strategy should satisfy either one or both o f the follow ing objectives; (i) (ii) The strategy should have som e m icrobial subsurface predictive capacity The strategy should significantly reduce the risk o f pathogens from reaching source w aters by drastically eradicating organism s from nutrient stockpiles.

Since a m icrobial risk prediction strategy is unlikely, the focus o f future m anagem ent initiatives should center on pre-application p rocesses to elim inate m icroorganism s before they are given the chance to be transported. Therefore, all risks and hazards that supports the shedding, grow th, and stability o f organism s in nutrient sources should b e accounted

114

fo r and controlled. H azards and risks are identified by observing and studying the processes w hich contribute to potentially hazardous conditions. 5.1.1 O perational an d P rocedural O bjectives Each agricultural operation is essentially sim ilar in several com ponents o f daily and seasonal operation. A gricultural operations are cyclical. That is, significant processes are repeated if crop yield or animal grow th is sustained. The significant m echanism s o f procedure in livestock operations, anim al storage, anim al grazing, nutrient collection, nutrient storage and nutrient distribution, m ore than likely occur in m ost agricultural operations w hich house livestock and/or utilize animal w astes on their lands. A s seasonal tem perature and atm ospheric conditions vary, so do significant procedures and processes. T hese conditions and processes m ust be accounted for in any m anagem ent process, especially in O ntario w here atm ospheric conditions play a crucial role in all agricultural operations.

The concept o f constructing a flow diagram to docum ent key procedures is nothing new to m anagem ent system s. Flow diagram s w ould encourage consistency and habitual tendencies and behaviours am ongst m em bers o f agricultural operations. For exam ple, the food industry has utilized the H A C C P approach (see section 5.3) along with a critical control p o in t m ethodology in order to standardize its systems. H A C C P uses a flow diagram structure so that critical controlpoi?its are identified visually and objectives are met. Like the agricultural industry, operations in the food industry are both complex and diverse. H ow ever, the H A C C P system has succeeded in the food industry and becom e standard for food safety program m ing and accreditation am ongst m ost large food production facilities. As processes in the food industry are consistently repeated to produce a consistent product, th e H A CCP system w orks well to identify hazards in each step in the operation. The effectiveness o f the H A C C P system is further enhanced in m ost food settings considering th e m ajority o f food operations are perform ed under controlled conditions. Such conditions allow operators o f H ACCP system s to dictate local conditions o f tem perature and w ater availability w hich are key to the reproduction o f all m icroorganism s and m ulti-cellular biota.

115

T h e difficulty in im plem enting structural m anagem ent system s (such as H A C CP) in exterior environm ents (such as in farm ing operations) is that conditions o f the environm ent are contingent upon variable atm ospheric events. H ow ever, as long as preconditions for im portant processes are accounted for (the process o f treating soils w ith nutrients), it becom es the responsibility o f the operator o f the m anagem ent system to determ ine i f conditions are appropriate for action.

5.1.2 P ublic H ealth Objectives T h e history o f nutrient m anagem ent in Ontario is rooted deeply in m aintaining public health initiatives and providing potable w ater sources to m unicipalities and their residents. The link betw een effective nutrient m anagem ent practices and potable w ater sources w as discovered long before th e inception o f the Ontario N utrient M anagem ent Act. Provincial policies such as T he Waste M anagem ent A ct (1970) and the Agricultural Code o f Practice (1973) included nutrient m anagem ent and public health strategies known to reduce risk o f m icrobial contam ination to fields and w ater sources. However, despite efforts from both the agricultural com m unity and policy m akers in provincial and m unicipal governm ents, the incidences o f ground and surface w ater contam ination continued to occur. In order to develop an effective nutrient m anagem ent strategy, local public health departm ents m ust play a prom inent role in strategy developm ent. The strategy should em brace the changing Ontario landscape o f overlapping urban and rural environm ents.

R ather than focusing on reactive circum stances w here a m icroorganism or groups o f m icroorganism s h av e already entered the subsurface environm ent, researchers and policy developers should look to preventative m echanism s o f m icrobial control. Hence, m icrobial risks to source w aters m ay be significantly reduced if the nutrient applied to land is significantly reduced in pathogens or further, pathogen free. A `m ultibarrier' approach is required w hich not only addresses the issues o f m icrobial transport m echanism s, but also looks at how m icroorganism s can b e elim inated from nutrient bearing m aterials. Pathogen viability m ust be considered in pathogen

116

m anagem ent strategies because essentially, non-viability o f m icrobes elim inates their hazards along w ith the risks they pose to hum an and animal health. 5.1.3 R isk R eduction Strategies In order to control risks at the nutrient level, it is essential that an analysis o f all risks be conducted fo r all agricultural operations. In the N utrient M anagem ent Act, risks are accounted for in nutrient m anagem ent plans and nutrient m anagem ent strategies. H ow ever, as reported by Stiefelm eyer (2003) not all aspects o f risk are accounted for in plans and strategies such as pathogen load reduction, animal health and biosecurity. It is clear that the significance and degree o f risk m ay range from one farm to the next, how ever, the basic farm ing processes, collection o f animal nutrients, storage o f animal nutrients, and treatm ent o f animal nutrients and spreading o f animal nutrients rem ain the sam e for m ost operations w hich harbour livestock. As discussed in Chapter 3, research

w hich focuses on the abatem ent and transport o f m atter, specifically m icroorganism s, typically isolates single variables in experim ents in order to m easure the effect o f the variable on overall m icrobial m ovem ent. H owever, it is ineffective to sim ply exam ine and focus on a single factor and analyze its effect on the entire system . Rather, w e m ust look at the subsurface m atrix as a m yriad o f factors that interact w ith one another, and act to impede, suspend or encourage m ovem ent o f a particle in several possible directions. Similarly, as it is difficult to predict the pathw ay and fate o f a m icroorganism in the subsurface environm ent, it is essential that other m ethods o f risk reduction be im plem ented.

5.2 Management Strategies
M anagem ent systems w ork w ithin a structure o f repetitiveness w here actions are m easured, and then m easured again to ensure that they are consistently w orking within the confines o f w hat the system demands. A n effective m anagem ent strategy not only encourages consistency and habitual tendencies, but it also allows the organization to continually im prove to both m eet and exceed legislative requirem ents and progressively build the strategy to advance its efficiency and effectiveness.

117

D eveloping a nutrient m anagem ent strategy for agricultural operations is a strategic process involving several disciplines and aspects o f scientific, econom ic, political and m anagem ent com ponents. O ne o f the driving forces for m anagem ent system s in today's econom y is consum er dem and. The dem and is forcing organizations to im plem ent m anagem ent system s for several reasons including organizational due diligence and product safety. F o r exam ple, an organization w ishing to sell a certain crop to a food production plan t m ay b e required in future to becom e either H ACCP or ISO 14001 certified as th e certifications qualify that the organization has m et and/or exceed w hat is required by local governing legislation, not to m ention the dem ands o f the purchaser.

To date, no environm ental m anagem ent strategy specifically pertaining to pathogen m anagem ent has been developed. Several w ide-ranging m anagem ent system s allow users to integrate and m easure key processes o f the system in order to adequately assess predeterm ined objectives. The follow ing section discusses two key m anagem ent system s used in environm ental systems along w ith their applicability to nutrient m anagem ent systems.

5 3 HACCP
As discussed in section 4.7, the H ACCP system is a critical control m odel which is capable o f m anaging risks through the m onitoring o f critical points along a process pathway. HACCP w as c lism ally defined as " a system atic approach to the identification and assessm ent o f th e m icrobiological hazards and risks associated w ith the m anufacturing, distribution and use o f a particular foodstuff, and the definition o f m eans for their control" (N oordhuizen & Frankena, 1999). Implemented for the m ost part in the food industry, H A CCP could potentially b e used in the agricultural industry to control risks located both above and below the earth's surface. A ccording to N oordhuizen and Frankena (1999), H A CC P seem s em inently suitable for identification and control o f animal health risks. H ACCP can be farm -specific, take a bottom -up approach, enable farmers to dem onstrate herd-health status, is sim ple in its design, requires low labour

118

input and little docum entation, and proves a functional link w ith other governm ent program s (N oordhuizen & Frankena, 1999).

T he HACCP system functions by identifying critical control p o ints (CCPs). A ccording to N oordhuizen and Frankena (1999), a CCP is a process step, condition or m easuring point w hich is im portant in the elimination or reduction o f a hazard to an acceptable level. A control p oint is deemed `criticaT if it is associated with the (hazard) under study, i f m easuring can be conducted, and if control m easures can be taken w hich lead to the elim ination or reduction o f the risk (N oordhuizen & Frankena, 1999). The effectiveness o f CCPs lies in their ability to be found in a wide variety o f processes, regardless o f differences in procedures used from one agricultural operation to the next. CCPs will differ betw een farm s to a certain extent because farm conditions and structures vary. For each CCP, target levels and tolerances m ust be specified: for example, cleaning w ater tem peratures have a set point o f 80° Celsius w ith a tolerance o f 3° Celsius, and cows new ly introduced into the herd should be free from specified pathogens (tolerance zero level) (N oordhuizen & Frankena, 1999). All the CCPs w ithin the farm are intercorm ected through on-farm m onitoring and surveillance system w hich ideally would be able to detect loss o f process control and provide the farm er with inform ation relevant to taking corrective actions. The num ber o f CCPs should be limited in order to keep the m onitoring and surveillance system m anageable (Noordhuizen & Frankena, 1999). T he CCPs should be consistently m onitored (via operational review) in order to determ ine i f risks are accounted for and managed. A ccording to N oordhuizen and Frankena (1999), a CCP has to m eet certain requirem ents to be approved; 1. There should be a casual relationship between CCP and hazard 2. It m ust be m easurable 3. There should be tolerance levels and targets defined for each CCP 4. M easures should be available which, in the case o f deviant CCP values, will lead to recovery o f control, and 5. They should b e m inim al in num ber and interconnected in an on-farm m onitoring network

119

Com panies em ploying H A C C P in their organizations are said to be `H ACCP recognized' or `H ACCP approved'. In Canada, the Canadian F ood a n d Inspection A gency (CFIA) is responsible for inspecting H A C CP recognized com panies to ensure com pliance w ith the H ACCP guidelines (Sparling et al. 2001). Com panies im plem enting HACCP w ill benefit in several w ays. A ccording to Sparling et al. (2001), the following outlines th e m ost significant benefits o f H ACCP recognition: 1. M eeting regulatory requirem ents for dom estic and export m arkets 2. M eet custom er dem ands for food safety specifications 3. Low er risk o f product recall/potential liability 4. Low er operating costs 5. Provide m anagem ent with better inform ation for decision m aking

T he H A CC P system is essentially a m ethod o f process control. Those wishing to voluntarily im plem ent the H A CCP system in their agricultural operation are agreeing with the fact that the processes w ithin their system will be strictly m onitored and controlled. Ideally, if the H A CCP system was im plem ented as a m odel for agricultural operations, a tem plate would be used w here the operation would be categorized based on identified risks w ithin the operation. For example, if an agricultural operation was involved in high volum e animal w aste collection, had shallow subsurface w ater tables and was located on a w ater reservoir w hich served a large population, the operation would be deem ed `high risk '. A `high risk ' operation would require m ore control and increased inspection frequency from internal and external auditing sources. Similarly, the N utrient M anagem ent A ct bases its risk categorization on the num ber o f animal units on the agricultural operation. A lthough this addresses the concern o f potential nutrient loading, it does not address threats o f soil com position, environm ental events and subsurface m ake-up.

5.3.1 H A C C P and N utrient M anagem ent System s - Advantages T h e inherent advantage in utilizing the H ACCP system in agricultural operations is that it lim its the ability o f the operation to becom e inconsistent in its processes and approach. Cyclical m onitoring and testing coerces operators to be consistent so that risks

120

o r critical controls are managed. Otherwise, if the system is neglected, products or services are threatened and potentially hazardous occurrences m ay transpire.

A ccording to Sparling et al. (2001), H ACCP is m ost successful when applied to com panies and process involved in the food supply chain from farm inputs to the consumer. This includes the entire process o f `farm -to-tahle' production. A ccording to Sparling et al. (2001), on the farm, processes include m onitoring inputs, m aintaining sanitation procedures, and practicing good animal health m anagem ent. A t the processing level, the focus is on contam ination prevention during processing, transportation, storage, and distribution. In retail, restaurant and food service organizations emphasis is on proper sanitation, refrigeration and storage, handling and preparation procedures. A lthough H ACCP operates prim arily at the processing level, there are num erous initiatives designed to prepare farm ers for eventual H ACCP im plem entation (Sparling et al. 2001 ). T he H A CCP concept is well suited for quality control at the farm level, involving risk identification and risk m anagem ent. The on-farm monitoring and surveillance system o f critical control points in the animal production process is the most im portant tool in this procedure (N oordhuizen & Frankena, 1999). 5.3.2 H A C CP and N utrient M anagem ent Systems - D isadvantages T he H ACCP system is m ost successful when applied to operations w hich are system atic and w here critical controls can be identified. However, one o f the largest difficulties in im plem enting a H ACCP system in an agricultural operation w ould be the ability o f an operator to identify and m easure critical control points quantitatively. As discussed in Chapters Three and Four, research has yet to provide consistent and reliable results for all aspects and processes o f m icrobial subsurface transport. For exam ple, optimal ranges o f tem perature, pH, soil com position, and m oisture level for m icrobial transport have been studied, bu t have not necessarily been established. Furtherm ore, no com mon consensus has been agreed upon to identify w hat constitutes the optimal environm ental conditions for m icrobial survival or transport. D ue to the diversity o f m icroorganism s and their transport m echanism s under variable conditions, it is difficult to establish appropriate `ranges' to w hich critical controls could be m easured b y under different conditions.

121

The com plexity o f critical controls in H ACCP lies not in the process o f m easurem ent, but in establishing appropriate ranges for control in order to reduce the risk o f an organism reaching a w ater reservoir, contam inating a potable w ater source, and threatening hum an health. Until further advances are m ade in understanding m icrobial subsurface transport, it w ould b e difficult to create a com prehensive CCP system which incorporates all aspects o f best m anagem ent practices and protects public health.

Econom ic cost o f applying the H ACCP system is also a significant consideration for program im plem entation. According to Sparling et al. (2001), cost for H ACCP im plem entation depends on the product and processes involved. For a single process in a small (agricultural) operation, the cost would be approxim ately $15,000. To develop a HACCP plan and becom e H A CCP-recognized typically takes from 6-9 months (Sparling et al. 2001 ). Essentially, it is the operation and the extent o f program com plexity that will invariably determ ine the overall cost o f im plem enting H ACCP, both econom ically and environm entally.

5.4 ISO 14001 - Environmental Management
The ISO standard is synonymous with successful m anagem ent systems around the w orld in several industries and organizations. Follow ing in the tradition o f its predecessors, including ISO 9000, the ISO 14000 series o f organizational system s is the com plete program for environm ental m anagem ent. There are several different standards in the ISO 14000 fam ily, but ISO 14001 is the cornerstone. ISO 14001 requires that organizations develop an environmental policy, and their Environm ental M anagem ent System (EM S) (Sparling et al. 2001). T he ISO 14001 system is responsible for the m anagem ent o f environm ental hazards and critical controls located within the organization and apply to individual sites and organizations. A ccording to Sparling et al. (2001), ISO 14000 sets no numerical lim its for environm ental m anagem ent. Instead, it w orks w ithin the existing environm ental policy iram ew ork to ensure that a site or operation meets or exceeds all existing governm ent regulations and practices `continuous im provem ent'. It also identifies environm ental issues and risks that are not regulated and

122

develops policies and m anagem ent procedures to deal w ith them (Sparling et al. 2001). Althougli it was not intended to be an environm ental m anagem ent system , the N utrient M anagem ent A ct (N M A ) incorporates m any o f the com ponents consistent in ISO 14001 w ithin its legislation and protocols. Similarly, ISO 14001 requires sim ilar participation from key stakeholders in order to prom ote effective environm ental m anagem ent through a system atic approach.

K ey to all m anagem ent systems in the ISO standard is the requirem ent for ^plando-check-act' activities w hich requires the organization consistently m onitor com ponents o f their m anagem ent system. The ISO 14001 system requires that the organization consider the following criteria for EM S im plem entation including; 1. Overview and Poi'cy - requires a single policy be w ritten for a specific environm ental purpose 2. Planning - involves identifying critical controls, legal requirem ents and public participation 3. Im plem entation - w here training and operational control o f critical controls takes place 4. M easurem ent and Corrective A ction - Includes m onitoring and m easurem ent activities and auditing procedures and; 5. M anagem ent Review - includes internal review o f the system

A ccording to Sparling et al. (2001), ISO 14000 is a global environm ental m anagem ent initiative o f the ISO series and operates sim ilarly to ISO 9000. Its objective is the creation o f a voluntary agreem ent on EM S and practices on a w orldw ide basis. Certification is an instrum ent for increasing corporate accountability w ithout governm ent interference. Business m ust develop and m eet environmental goals, as well as consider the im pact the business has on the environm ent (Sparling et al. 2001). ISO 14001 is a self-governing system w hich requires that all hazards and controls (w hich could potentially affect the environm ent) be accounted for. ISO 14000 standards are m eant to be a com plem ent to existing laws and legislation, not a replacem ent. It is a voluntary standard, but, as noted by Sparling et al. (2001), m any organizations w ill require

123

certification in the future, if they w ish to do business in the international m arket place. T he ISO 14001 tem plate is currently being im plem ented in the U nited States in O range County, California. T he system is b eing used to m anage the land application o f biosolids on m unicipal and agricultural lands. 5.4.1 ISO 14001 and N utrient M anagem ent System s - A dvantages B oth voluntary system s, H A CCP and ISO 14001 take a generalized environm ental m anagem ent system approach so that they can be applied specifically to several applications in industries w here environm ental hazards exist. The follow ing points, according to Sparling et al. (2001) outline the m ost significant benefits that proponents claim can be obtained from the ISO 14000 certification. T hey include; 1. Better understanding o f environm ental costs 2. M otivate organizations to be aware o f environm ental legislation and problem s 3. N ot too costly, as m any organizations can adjust current environm ental practices to satisfy the ISO 14000 requirem ents 4. International acceptance and recognition trade m arketing tool 5. Q uicker response to environm ental problem s and occurrences

6. Process docum entation and m onitoring prevents problem s 7. Few er num ber o f inspections by governm ent 8. Self-regulation (proactive) to prevent governm ent from interfering

9. M eeting custom er dem ands and expectations for environm ental stew ardship

The effectiveness o f the system is contingent upon its structure. Just because the system com plies w ith the legislation does not mean that it will prevent hazardous events. Rather, the system engages current know ledge pertaining to the hazard and im plem ents it. Then, the system should be m onitored to ensure that critical controls are m aintained. 5.4.2 ISO 14001 and N utrient M anagem ent System s - Disadvantages Taking a proactive and globally consistent approach to environm ental m anagem ent would reduce the need for governm ent intervention w hile at the sam e tim e reducing an organization's environm ental risk exposure. The 14001 system is com plex, potentially costly and requires participation from several key stakeholders in the

124

com munity. Proponents o f the m anagem ent system claim that ISO 14001, sim ilar to H ACCP, w ould likely reduce hazards due to th e plan-do-check-act requirem ent in the system as it forces operators o f th e system s to be accountable for their actions. H ow ever, the system is only as effective as th e com ponents w hich govern it (legislative requirem ents and scientific research). Therefore, w ithout progressive legislation and research to support the reduction prohibition o f environm ental hazards, the m anagem ent system cannot b e expected to reduce hazards effectively

5.5 The Alternative Nutrient Management Strategy
B eing increasingly view ed under the political and public m icroscope, agricultural operators require system atic approaches which stress habitual and consistent best m anagem ent practices at the field level. The overall goal o f such a strategy w ould be to mitigate or control the microbial contam ination risk from m anure applied to agricultural lands. A harm onization o f m anagem ent approaches and scientific data is required in order to b ring together all aspects o f m icrobial transport and risk assessm ent objectives into a single m anagem ent system w hich supports due diligence practices.

Tire creation and im plem entation o f the `id eal' nutrient m anagem ent strategy should include aspects o f hum an, environm ental, econom ical and scientific elem ents. If even one o f the elem ents is ignored, the system m ay fail. A ccording to Sim s et al. (1999), the m ost com m on reason given for the failure to adopt practices aim ed at reducing non-point source pollution is that they are not econom ically viable. O ther reasons include: (i) The cause o f the environm ental problem has not been conclusively identified by research or is not w ell understood by policy m akers. H ence, there is reluctance to adopt practices that may not be effective in reducing the im pacts o f the nutrients (ii) (iii) There is disagreem ent o f the practicality o f the solution The infrastructure needed for the w idespread adoption o f a practice is not in place and therefore cannot be im plem ented for use. (iv) The solution may h av e other environm ental effects that are difficult to predict

125

(Sim s et al. (1999)). T he practice o f reducing m icrobial risks is currently used to som e degree b o th in the N utrient M anagem ent A ct and its protocols. H ow ever, there is a lack o f any evidence o f scientific data w hich inform s requirem ents in the Act, regulations, or protocols w hich w ould indicate to w h at degree overall m icrobial risks are reduced. In the case o f nutrient m anagem ent, the concept o f risk is calculated by the probability o f a m icroorganism (bacteria, viruses, protozoa) reaching a select point in the subsurface environm ent (an aquifer) m ultiplied b y the m agnitude o f a contam ination event occurring (adverse health effects to hum ans and to anim als who m ight consum e contam inated w ater).

E nhancing the existing level o f control o f pathogens in the environm ent can be accom plished by addressing the follow ing strategies in agricultural settings; (i) Increase practices that discourage anim al access to w aterw ays and practicing effective anim al health care so as to reduce pathogen shedding events and the m icrobial cross-contam ination o f young herd. (ii) U tilize m ethods o f nutrient pre-treatm ent so as to reduce m icrobial loads in animal nutrient sources. (iii) Standardize m anure application m ethods for variable environm ents.

`Beginning o f the p ip e ' solutions to reduce m icrobial contam ination potential should be im plem ented in source w ater protection and pathogen m anagem ent legislation. Consequently, risk reduction is observed and therefore, the significance o f relying upon the accuracy o f subsurface pathw ay m odels and risk analyses projections becom es less significant. Cost and benefits should also play a role in any pathogen m anagem ent strategy in order that all agricultural operations would be w illing to participate in such a plan and reap rew ards from using it. O verall, the ideal pathogen m anagem ent system should satisfy the follow ing criteria (in no particular order); (i) (ii) (iii) T he system should b e cost effective for all agricultural operations It should b e consistent w ith reliable and consistent scientific literature It should b e consistent w ith public health initiatives and legislation

126

(iv)

It should reduce overall risk o f source w ater contam ination by b o th m icrobial and chem ical elem ents

(v)

The system should be practical, concise and be easily im plem ented

T he H A C C P satisfies the requirem ents given in the list above. The difficulty in im plem enting a H A C C P system in n utrient m anagem ent system s is that critical controls p o in ts (the m ain com ponents o f any H A C C P system ) cannot b e determ ined fo r several controls at this tim e fo r m any risk-based analyses and calculations. F o r exam ple, w hat is the range o f pathogen loadings perm itted in nutrient piles p rio r to treating land w ith nutrients? Ranges o f values are required for critical control p o in ts in order that critical values are m et to control potential hazards.

A ssum ing that at som e point, research provides accurate range values fo r optim al environm ents for m icrobial abatem ent and transport, it is assum ed that one can b etter estim ate the risk th at a m icroorganism w ill reach source w aters. For exam ple, the food industry has been quite successful in using critical control p o in ts to reduce food borne illness. H ow ever, unlike the lack o f research observed in nutrient m anagem ent studies, the food industry has precise and consistent values for control o f food-bom e pathogens. For exam ple, it is w ell understood that the Escherichia coli bacterium is destroyed w here it is exposed to a tem perature o f 76° Celsius. Therefore, w here Escherichia coli is a concern in a food p ro d u ct (in ground beef), a critical control o f cooking the product to a tem perature o f 76° Celsius is im plem ented w ithin the system . Sim ilarly, i f im plem ented at the farm level, critical controls w ould be able to identify those conditions in the field w hich support transport (and abatem ent) o f m icroorganism s and restrict the application o f animal w astes (given pre-treatm ent took place) until optim al environm ental conditions (pH, tem perature, w ater availability, etc.) perm it placem ent to fields.

I f legislation or a system atic approach to m anaging nutrients is found to be ineffective in future nutrient m anagem ent efforts, drastic and likely costly econom ic solutions m ay have to be im plem ented. F o r exam ple, nutrient treatm ent m ethods (such as com posting) have been shown to be effective m ethods for reducing m icrobial populations

127

in anim al w astes. M icrobial treatm ent m ethods such as com posting are n o t necessarily difficult procedures to m aintain, but require stable environm ental conditions and facilities to host com posting processes. The advantage o f u sin g m icrobial treatm ent m ethods is sim ple. I f they are used correctly, they, for all intents and purposes reduce m icrobial loads and risk to subsurface aquifers as pathogenic m icroorganism s are either reduced significantly in m agnitude or are elim inated.

Solutions are required w hich do not require in depth scientific know ledge but rather are consistent w ithin a process and are habitual. U ltim ately, proactive, rather than reactive m ethods o f nutrient m anagem ent strategies should be im plem ented in any future stratagem . R eactive m easures are generally not considered to be effective political policy as they do little to p rotect the public. A ccording to Sim s et al. (1999), developing environm ental policies that can sustain agricultural productivity in such a changing (agricultural) clim ate w ill require a collaborative approach betw een the scientific com m unity and a consortium o f farmers, agribusiness, provincial and federal advisory and reg u lato ry agencies and public interest/environm ental groups. T herefore, even i f all critical controls are not identified, it still rem ains im portant that m anagem ent system s be used to m onitor and change the hazards w hich can be controlled.

5.6 Conclusions
S ince all aspects o f m icrobial abatem ent and transport through the soil have yet to b e conclusively identified, it is im possible to m ake risk predictions based on m icrobial location in the subsurface environm ent. Therefore, alternative m ethods o f nutrient m anagem ent should be engaged w hich specifically look at `beginning o f the pipe' processes o f m icrobial control. H azard control system s, including H aza rd A nalysis C ritical C ontrol P o in t (H A C C P) and ISO 14001 could potentially b e effective at m anaging diverse and com plex systems such as agricultural system s dealing w ith animal w aste nutrients. T he system s rely on strict param eters for identifying critical controls w hich req u ire m o nitoring and testing. Until m ore specific param eters for optim al subsurface environm ental conditions are acknow ledged, adequate critical controls cannot

128

b e accurately identified. Therefore, alternative m ethods fo r protecting source w aters require additional research.

R esearchers have identified gaps in subsurface m icrobial research and transport m odels. D espite these gaps, research should continue so th at studies continue to strive to identify th e m echanism s o f m icrobial subsurface transport. O bjectives fo r an optim al nutrient m anagem ent system include cost effectiveness o f the system, the incorporation o f consistent and reliable scientific data, ensuring consistency w ith public health initiatives and legislation along w ith reducing the overall risk o f source w ater contam ination both b y m icrobial and chem ical constituents. The m anagem ent system should em brace several facets o f com m unity and environm ental objectives including public health initiatives. U ltim ately, it is the protection o f public health interests w hich is key to all environm ental program s in the public sector.

Chapter Six: Conclusions and Recommendations
6.1 Conclusion
As the distance betw een urban and rural com m unities dim inishes, practices and policies for nutrient and pathogen m anagem ent control will becom e especially im portant w here w ell-w ater and subsurface w ater sources are used for public consum ption. Generally, it is assum ed that nutrient m anagem ent policies in Ontario use current scientific know ledge to protect against transport o f nutrients along w ith pathogenic organism s to source w aters. H ow ever, m any o f the nutrient m anagem ent initiatives o f past and present hav e focused less on th e protection o f public health, a sm aller am ount on m icrobial scientific research, and m ore on controlling nuisances stem m ing from agricultural operations. R esearch o f bo th previous legislation and current subsurface transport studies requires one to question why the province o f Ontario has not addressed pathogen m anagem ent directly as opposed to indirect m ethods such as nutrient m anagem ent? Furtherm ore, i f the province o f Ontario is indeed attem pting to control pathogens b y virtue o f nutrient control, have they utilized scientific research to support their requirem ents?

W hile scientific studies have show n a num ber o f relationships betw een m icrobes and the subsurface environm ent, risk analysis and predictive capacities o f m icrobial subsurface transport m odels are at b est unreliable. D espite this, a progression in know ledge o f subsurface research is observed. Several relationships betw een m icrobial survival and transport have been correlated with environm ental conditions. Through such studies, it is observed that m icroorganism s are in fact, quite resilient in several environm ents. U ntil sound scientific m odeling principles are em ployed, source w ater protection initiatives m ust rely on o th er m ethods o f reducing pathogenic contam ination risks. So-called `beginning o f the p ip e ' or preventative `critical control' solutions to reduce m icrobial contam ination should be entertained as alternative m ethods o f reducing risk from pathogens and protecting hum an health.

130

In this study, it w as hypothesized that based on current m icrobial subsurface transport research, nutrient m anagem ent legislation in Ontario does not sufficiently protect ground w ater sources from pathogens. A lthough the hypothesis was not conclusively proven (nor was it discredited), findings point to the continuing need for further research in pathogen abatem ent and nutrient m anagem ent research w hich specifically identifies the optimal conditions for abatem ent and transport o f m icroorganism s through the subsurface environm ent. Such studies w ould support the im plem entation o f a critical control based system w hich recognizes and controls for hazards prior to the treatm ent to land w ith nutrients. Therefore, there should be an ongoing effort to continue to identify the m echanism s o f subsurface m icrobial abatem ent and transport so that critical factors to transport can be identified and later controlled.

6.2 Recommendations
1. Enhance the use o f pre-treatm ent options in agricultural operations. Pre-treatm ent options, or `beginning o f the p ip e ' solutions can significantly reduce or elim inate pathogenic organism s from being land applied. T he only w ay to develop an effective m anagem ent plan for nutrient m anagem ent system s is to account for and m anage the processes that precede the dissem ination o f pathogenic m icroorganism s into the subsurface environm ent. B y decreasing the m icrobiological load in nutrient m ass, one significantly reduces the risk that a group or single organism will contam inate a potable w ater source.

2. The im plem entation o f an effective m anagem ent system is required in order to stream line the processes in agricultural operations throughout Ontario. Essentially, a critical control system model (HACCP, ISO 14001) w ould likely serve as an effective tem plate for assessing and treating risks. In order for the system to b e effective, critical control points m ust be established for quantitative param eters to b e m easured w ithin the system. Therefore, research focused specifically on establishing value ranges for optim um conditions for m icrobial transport and abatem ent should m ove forward.

Appendix 2.2: Summary of Previous Legislation
A n Act R especting the Contagious D iseases of A nim als (1885) The D epartm ent o f A griculture's first legislation, A n A ct Respecting the Contagious D iseases o f Animals, was developed in 1869 for farm ers who w ere trying to establish livestock herds and needed protection from diseases o f the times such as rinderpest and other European pathogens coming from their respective hom elands. N ot surprisingly, the A ct did not deal specifically with the m anagem ent o f nutrients, nor w ater quality or pollution abatement.

Indirectly, how ever, the A ct m anaged to control for the m ovem ent o f diseased animals and the products o f w aste they m ay have produced or m ay have com e into contact w ith. For example, animals that m ight have com e into contact w ith disease would have to be destroyed along with the food products they m ay have partially consumed. Furtherm ore, waste products from suspected diseased animals such as animal dung w ere not perm itted for use and w ere required to be destroyed. Any storage facilities for animals along w ith transportation vehicles (boats and vessels) were required to be cleaned and disinfected prior to allow ing any further transportation on the vessel.

The W ell Drillers A ct (1924) Passed in 1924 as An A ct to regulate the Boring and Protection o f Wells, the Well Drillers A ct was originally legislated under the authority o f the M inistry o f M ines. The Act prim arily dealt w ith two issues o f concern in well safety; 1. W ells containing natural gas deposits 2. Abandoned wells

Both circum stances could potentially lead to unsafe drinking w ater conditions w here abandoned wells w ould have to be capped and w ater deem ed officially undrinkable for public consum ption. Protection clauses contained within the Well D rillers A ct included the requirem ent to apply for a license prior to boring a well, along with plugging unused wells so as to "prevent any fresh or salt w ater or other injurious substances from en terin g ..." {Well D rillers Act, 1924, s. 9(1)). The Well D rillers A ct yNowlà be revised in

149

updated versions until the early 1940s. Future acts including the Ontario Water Resources A ct (1990) w ould focus on specific sections o f well health and construction (see appendix 2.2) rather than focusing on specifications and other general details unrelated to well w ater health which was discussed in the Well D rillers Act.

The Lakes and R ivers Im provem ent A ct (1927) Originally released in 1927 and later adopted by the M inistry o f Natural Resources, the general purpose o f the L akes and Rivers Im provem ent A c t was to (am ong others) provide for the m anagem ent, protection, preservation and use o f the w aters o f the lakes and rivers o f Ontario and the land under them. The 1990 version o f the Act consisted o f three com ponents including; (i) Construction, repair and use o f dams (ii) Public rights in lakes and rivers and (iii) W ater privileges.

One general clause in the 1990 revised edition o f the A ct pertained indirectly to nutrient m anagem ent and the pollution o f lakes and rivers. Section 36 (1) o f the A ct required that;

"N o person shall throw, deposit, discharge or perm it the throwing, depositing or discharging o f any refuse, substance or m atter in a lake or river w hether or not the lake or river is covered by ice, or on shores or banlcs o f a lake or river w ider circum stances that conflict with the purposes o f this act

Farm ing practices or environm ents were not specifically mentioned w ithin the text o f the Act. H ow ever, it is unclear i f the Lakes and R ivers Im provem ent A ct was used as a tool by the M inistry o f Natural Resources to restrict the disposal o f pollutants to lakes and rivers w hich possibly could be disposed o f by farmers.

150

An Act to Establish the O ntario W ater R esources C om m ission (1956) Established in 1956, the Ontario Water Resources Com mission had several functions and pow ers to provide w ater to the public and to supply them w here required. It was the function o f the com m ission to construct and operate w ater system s for the supply, purification and distribution o f w ater and for the disposal o f sew age and to enter into agreements w ith respect to the supply o f w ater or the disposal o f sew age (to land). The com mission provided an annual report detailing the state o f system s in Ontario to the M inister in power.

Ontario Field Crop Recom m endations (1961) D eveloped by the Ontario M inistry o f A griculture and Rural A ffairs, the recom m endations w ere released on an annual basis. Recom m endations ranged from field application m ethods to storage basins and construction practices. T he recom m endations had no bearing on legislative matters, how ever, they w ere often concurrent w ith the legislation o f the day.

The O ntario Farm M anagem ent Program (1968) T he program, developed by the Ontario D epartm ent o f A griculture and Food, was used by fanners in Ontario to provide help and guidance in areas o f financial managem ent, livestock managem ent, soil and crop m anagem ent, and m achinery m anagement.

T he W aste M anagem ent A ct (1970) C om m encing in Septem ber 1970, the Waste M anagem ent A ct targeted w aste m anagem ent systems. M ore specifically, the A ct targeted system s run in m unicipalities as either w aste `m anagem ent system s' or `waste disposal sites'. U nder the Act, `w aste sites' required a certificate o f approval from the M inister o f Energy and R esource M anagem ent (as the EPA had yet to be passed into law). A dditionally, th e A ct referred to m unicipal by-laws (see appendix 2.2) w here no certificate o f approval could be granted, unless the applicant had furnished a certificate from the m unicipality in w hich

151

the waste disposal site w as situated or w here the w aste disposal site could not contravene any o f the by-law s o f the encom passing m unicipality.

Subsequent acts (1992) focused on specific landfill sites (waste disposal sites) as a function o f the tim e rem aining for disposal in the area. T he 1992 A ct w as placed under the M inistry o f the Environm ent, w hich is responsible for Certificates o f A pproval under \hc Environm ental Protection A c t (1971) and environm ental assessm ents (under the Environm ental Asi^essment A ct) to detenuine w here w astes m ay he applied.

The Fisheries A ct (1985) D eveloped by the Federal D epartm ent o f Fisheries and Oceans, the Fisheries A ct adm inistered in Ontario hy the O ntario M inistry o f Natural Resources and the Federal M inistry o f the Environm ent. T he purpose o f the A ct is the conservation and preservation o f fish and fish habitat (Toombs, 1992). T he A ct provides that no person shall carry on any w ork or undertaking that results in the haim ful alteration, disruption or destm ction o f fish o r fish habitat (Fisheries Act, 1985, s. 35(1)). Furtherm ore, the Act requires that no person shall deposit or pennit the deposit o f a deleterious substance o f any type in w ater frequented b y fish or in any place under any conditions w here the deleterious substance or any other deleterious substance that results from the deposit o f the deleterious substance m ay enter any such w ater (Fisheries Act, 1985, s. 36(3)). Similar to the Ontario W ater R esources Act, the Fisheries A ct does not specifically mention agricultural practices n o r their pollution opportunities into specified waters. However, agricultural practices, specifically those practices that prohibit or restrict the flow o f surface w aters to locations such as streams, lakes and w aterw ays should he wary o f the consequences o f such deposits, especially i f the w aters are inhabited b y fish.

Ontario W ater R esources A ct (1990) and the Safe D rinking W ater A ct (2002) The Province o f O n tario 's principal legislative instrum ent for the m anagem ent o f water resources, the Ontario Water Resources A ct (1990) (OW RA) addresses m ost aspects o f w ater quality in the province including w ater protection, extraction, treatm ent and control. M uch like the H ealth Protection and Prom otion Act, genera] clauses and

152

definitions u nder the OW RA restrict and prohibit pathogens from entering potable sources, including ground w ater sources. For exam ple, section 30(1), a general duty clause, prohibits the discharge o f m aterial that m ay contam inate waters.

Every p erso n that discharges o r causes or p erm its the discharge o f any m aterial o f any land into or in any w aters or on any shore o r b a n k th e re o f or into or in any p la ce that m ay im pair the quality o f the w ater o f any waters is gidlty o f an offense. (O ntario W ater R esources Act, 1990, s.3 0 (l))

A lthough the OW RA generally applies to m unicipalities or utilities that w ish to extract m ore than 50,000 litres o f w ater p er day from either surface or groundw ater, the Act contains several provisions w hich operate to restrict the relevance o f pathogens and other substances to w ater sources that m ay im pair the general quality o f that water. For example, sections 35 to 50 regulate w ell drilling and construction o f wells, section 33 acts to protect public w ater sources from contam ination, and section 32 o f the O W RA provides the M inistry o f the E nvironm ent with the pow er to order m easures to prevent, reduce, or alleviate the im pairm ent o f w ater quality. A nother im portant clause o f the OW RA includes its regulation m aking pow ers so that regulations such as R egulation 459 (drinking w ater treatm ent, testing, and reporting) m ay b e m ade. O ther exam ples o f legislation under the OW RA include the Ontario D rinking Water Standards w hich w ere developed as legally enforceable standards which set standards and lim its for m icrobiological, chem ical, physical, and radioactive characteristics o f drinking w ater where m icrobiological quality is stressed as the most im portant elem ent o f w ater quality due to its potential to spread disease.

D eveloped under authority o f the M inistry o f Environm ent, the Safe D ?inking Water A c t (2002) (SDW A) w as a product o f O ntario's Safe D rinking Water Strategy in response to Justice O 'C onnor's findings. Sim ilar to the O W R A , the Safe D rin kin g Water A ct provides general clauses for drinking w ater protection, especially as it relates to human health and well-being. The purpose o f the SDW A is two-fold;

153

1. To recognize that the people o f Ontario are entitled to expect their drinking w ater to be safe. 2, To provide for the protection o f hum an health and the prevention o f drinking w ater health hazards through control and regulation o f drinking w ater system s and drinking w ater testing.

T he SD W A governs the operation o f w ater supply system s b u t still relates to several rural outlets, especially those agricultural system s that share w ells. Sim ilar to the H ealth Protection and Pro?notion A ct, the A ct defines `d rinking w ater health h azard ' as the following; (a) a condition o f the system o r a condition associated w ith the system s w aters, including anything found in the w aters, (iv) that adversely affects, o r is likely to adversely affect, the health o f the users o f the system , (v) that deters or hinders, or is likely to deter or hinder, the prevention and suppression o f disease, or (vi) that endangers or is likely to endanger public health,

(b) a prescribed condition o f the drinking-w ater system , or (c) a prescribed condition associated w ith the sy stem 's w aters or the presence o f a prescribed thing in the waters. (Safe D rinking W ater A ct, 2002, s. 2(1))

The definition provides the ministry' w ith broad pow ers capable o f defining a drinking w ater health hazard w henever it is believed that a legitim ate threat has been exposed. H ow ever, references m ade to the N utrient M anagem ent A ct, the E nvironm ental Protection A ct and the Ontario W ater Resources A ct allow for m ore specific inspection and/or charges to be laid.

dealt w ith the construction and im plem entation o f drainage system s including those involved in agricultural system s. In the A gricultural Tile D rainage A ct, the definition o f a `drainage w o rk ' included " a drainage system constructed o f tile, pipe, o r tubing o f any m aterial beneath the surface o f agricultural land, including integral inlets and outlets for the purpose o f im proving the productivity o f the land drained" . In the D rainage A ct, `drainage w orks' included a drain constructed b y any m eans, including the im proving o f a natural w atercourse, and w orks necessary to regulate the w ater table or w ater level w ithin o r on any lands to regulate the level o f the w aters o f a drain, reservoir, lake or pond, and includes a dam , em bankm ent, wall, protective works or any com bination th e re o f (section 1).

Licensed agreem ents in both pieces o f legislation play vital roles in the approval o f any system w hich is installed and/or being m odified. Pathogen abatem ent and nutrient m anagem ent principles are n o t found in the A cts as they are designed m ainly fo r those parties interested in im plem enting or constructing such drains w hich w ould require licenses and approvals from engineering professionals.

C onservation L and A ct (1990) Passed under A uthority o f the M inister o f N atural Resources, th e Consei'vation L a n d A c t was passed in 1990 and later am ended in 1994 and 2000. T he A ct, "provides for the establislim ent o f conservation authorities w hich are responsible for, conservation restoration, developm ent and m anagem ent o f the natural resources other than gas, oil, coal and m inerals w ithin the jurisdiction o f a C onservation au th o rity .... and the prevention o f floods, erosion and pollution and the adverse effects associated w ith these problem s by controlling the flow o f surface w aters" (Toom bs, 1992).

The A ct provides for the establishm ent o f program s and the allow ance o f grants to conserve lands along w ith w ork or alterations w hich m ay take place in designated areas o f concern. D esignated areas o f concern include know n flooding areas and protected lands such as the N iagara escarpm ent.

P lan n in g A ct (1990) and the M unicipal A ct (2001) U n til the im plem entation o f the N utrient M anagem ent A c t in 2002, m any m nnicipalities in O ntario had their own version o f nutrient m anagem ei. t by-law s along w ith oth er bylaw s p ertaining to the preservation and protection o f w ater resources and land m anagem ent. M ost o f these pow ers w ere levied w hen the province introduced the P la n n in g A c t under w hich the province gave m unicipalities ju risdiction over m ost local m atters including th e m anagem ent o f land and w ater resources and th e control o f all form s o f pollution in the natural environm ent. Released b y the M inistry o f M unicipal A ffairs and H ousing, the P lanning A ct allow ed m unicipalities to gain control over local m atters through th e im plem entation o f by-law s w hich w ere enforced m ainly through local advisory com m ittees. Sim ilar to the P la n n in g A ct, the M unicipal A c t further highligh ted and delegated the responsibilities o f local m atters to local governm ents. Local interests, including th e m anagem ent and preservation o f public assets along w ith fostering th e current and future econom ic, social, and environm ental w ell b eing o f the m unicip ality w ere addressed (Planning A ct, 1990, s. 2 (a), (b), (c), & (d)).

M unicipalities are created by the Province o f Ontario to be responsible and accountable governm ents w ithin their jurisdiction. Each m unicipality is given pow ers and duties under this A ct and m any other A cts for puiposes including m anaging finances and fosterin g the current econom ic, social and environm ental w ell-being o f the m unicipality. A n exam ple o f such pow ers is the enactm ent o f local and m unicipal b y  law s and zoning by-law s w hich (if im plem ented correctly) w ould reduce the likelihood o f nuisances and environm ental contam ination o f local w aters and environm ents. For further inform ation on local m unicipal by-law s, see appendix 2.2.

M u n icip al B y-L aw s (1997). A s a result o f the M u n icip a l A ct and the P la n n in g Act, m unicipalities w ere given the legislative option o f creating by-law s w ithin their jurisdiction over local m atters, includin g nutrient m anagem ent. The first m unicipality to create the first true nutrient m anagem en t by-law w as G rey Tow nship in 1997. Several years after the first by-law , a total o f 95 m unicipalities (low er and u p p er tier) adopted their ow n version o f a nutrient

156

m anagem ent by-law . This included "a num ber o f by-law s that apply to an entire county (either a single tier County such as Chatham Kent) or a by-law passed at the upper tier county level (such as Perth)'' (C aldw ell, 2003). As the issue o f nutrient m anagem ent grew in the province and as increasing num bers o f m unicipalities contem plated requiring farmers to im plem ent N utrient M anagem ent Plans, "`the Ontario Farm Environm ental Coalition developed a N utrient M anagem ent Strategy that included a draft by-law in March 1998'' (Caldw ell, 2003). T he draft by-law , aptly nam ed The M odel By-Law to Incorporate the N utrient M anagem ent Plan (NMP) Requirem ents into a M unicipal ByLaw Pursuant to the M unicipal A ct was passed on July 23, 1999.

A lthough the fram ework for nutrient accountability had been m ade available to all m unicipalities across the province, inconsistencies in legislation still rem ained depending on w here the region was located. Such inconsistency rem ained one o f the m ain reasons for the im plem entation o f the N utrient M anagem ent Act in order that all fanns and agricultural operations across the province would follow one, and only one law for m anaging their nutrients. The sam ple by-law incorporated many o f the concepts contained in several Codes and G uidelines, including: · · · · » Incorporation o f livestock units. Use o f N utrient M anagem ent Plans. A cquiring sufficient land base requirem ents for spreading. M inim um separation distance form ulae and Provisions for livestock bam s

Despite differences am ong m any nutrient m anagem ent municipal by-law s, several key observations were identified in a report authored by Dr. W.J Caldwell named 'M anaging the Transition Between M unicipal and P rovincial G overnance as Required by the Regulations Under the N utrient M anagem ent A ct ' (Caldwell. 2003). T he report studied a total o f 85 by-laws anu observed several key findings listed below ; · M ost m unicipalities require a N utrient M anagem ent Plan for operations that establish or expand above 100 or 150 Livestock Units.

157

·

M ost m unicipalities have not established a m axim um distance betw een the source o f m anure and the land base to which it is to be applied

·

T he m inim um storage requirem ent for m anure was usually set by most m unicipalities at 240 days, although there w as a range betw een 100 and 365 days

·

M ost m unicipalities apply M.D.S. II to help Guide the sighting o f barns and m anure storage facilities.

·

N early 20 m unicipalities have established caps lim iting the m axim um size o f a livestock operation

·

Som e m unicipalities have attempted to control developm ent in wellhead protection areas.

D ue to the variation in som e o f the municipal by-law s, it is the challenge o f the 95 m unicipalities to stream line their practices to be consistent with the Nutrient M anagem ent Act. Fortunately, farm s and agricultural practices have already im plem ented m any o f the requirem ents in the N utrient M anagem ent Act. such as Niitn'eni M anagem ent Plans.

The Pesticides A ct (1990) A dm inistered by the M inistry o f the Environm ent, the Pesticides Act was developed to ensure for the safe m anagem ent o f pesticides in the Province o f Ontario. The shift in thinking from a perspective o f chem icals to the use o f biological, or "natural" pest control solutions validates the inclusion o f the Pesticides A ct and the m anagem ent o f pathogens in the environm ent. Larvieide application o f cultures o f Bacillus tluiringiensis to storm w ater basins in several locations in the province to control m osquito populations to reduce the spread o f W est Nile virus is an exam ple o f such biological use o f such applications.

The Dead A nim al Disposal A ct (1990) A dm inistered by the O ntario M inistry o f A griculture and Food, the D ea d Anim al D isposal A ct was developed to provide for the safe m anagem ent and disposal o f dead

158

animals. The disposal o f animals includes horses, goats, sheep, swine and cattle (larger animals). Much like the Act Respecting Infectious or Contagious D iseases affecting Anim als did in 1885, the Act requires farmers and agricultural operations to dispose o f animals suspected o f dying from natural causes or accidents (falling) in a safe and hum ane manner. Several clauses involved in the disposal include the requirem ent o f burying the animal within a period o f 48 hours o f its death and covering it with at least 2 feet o f earth.

Appendix 3.1 Other Microbial Subsurface Transport Models and Approaches
M ACRO A ccording to M cG echan & Lewis (2002), the most com prehensive field-scale model incorporating m ost o f the im portant colloid-facilitated contam inant transport through soil is M ACRO. This m odel sim ulates contam inant transport with a dual porosity structure allow ing for different contam inant concentrations in the soil matrix and the macropores. M ACRO was prim arily developed for m odeling pesticide transport, but it includes most o f the features required for transport o f phosphorus and biological m icroorganism s (bacteria and viruses). The model includes a three-phase representation o f contam inant transport (contam inants in solution, sorbed onto static soil matrix and sorbed onto m obile colloidal particles) according to M cGechan & Lewis' (2002) model o f particle sorption in the subsurface environment.

Filtration Models Filtration models assum e that the contam inant is particulate in nature and that its removal depends on physical straining and sorption processes. These processes are often combined into a filtration coefficient for the system (M aier et ah. 1999). Such models take into account m echanism s by which colloids (in this case m icrobes) com e into contact with particle surfaces and the relative size o f the m icrobe com pared with the pores in the medium (M aier et ah, 1999). The prem ise o f these m odels is that, as the microbial suspension passes through the terrestrial profile, m icroorganism s will be removed. Yao et ah (1971) dem onstrated that filtration models m ight be applicable in tenns o f predicting bacterial im m obilization during transport through the subsurface. As with the advection-dispersion equation, terms can be incorporated into the equation to account for net m icrobial decay (M aier et ah, 1999).

160

Appendix 3.2 Advection Dispersion Model - General Formula
A ccording to M aier et al. (1999), advection-dispersion models assum e that the contam inant (rhicroorganisms) is in a solution and thus has the same average velocity as the matrix solution. A dvection-dispersion equations can be expanded in order to take into account for subsurface heterogeneities in the environm ent. The following formula illustrates the influence o f advection, dispersion, adsorption, and decay on the transport o f a contam inant. A ccording to M aier et al. (1999), a relatively simple advectiondispersion equation is:

Rf d C l d t = \ d C l d x + lyd^Cldx^ ± Rx
W here; C is the concentration o f the microbe (mass/volume) X is the distance traveled through the porous medium (length) V is the average linear velocity constant (length/time) Rx is the microbial net decay term (mass/time-volume) t is tim e and, Rf is the retardation factor, accounting for reversible interaction with the porous medium .
