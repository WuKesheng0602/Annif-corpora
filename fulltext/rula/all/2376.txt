 `Load Distribution Factors for Curved Concrete Slab-on-Steel I-Girder Bridges' By Mohammed A. Al-Hashimy, P. Eng., M.A.Sc. Ryerson University - Civil Engineering Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2005

ABSTRACT
The use o f complex interchanges in modem highway urban systems have increased recently in addition to the desire to conform to existing terrain; both have led to increase the demand for horizontally curved bridges. One type o f curved bridges consists o f composite poncrete deck over steel I-girders which has been the preferred choice due to its simplicity in fabrication, transportation and erection. Although horizontally curved steel bridges constitute roughly one-third o f all steel bridges being erected today, their structural behavior still not well understood. Due to its geometry, simple presence o f curvature in curved bridges produces non uniform torsion and consequently, lateral bending moment (warping or bi-moment) in the girder flanges. The presence o f the lateral bending moments would significantly complicate the analysis and the design of the structure. Hence, a parametric study is required to scmtinize a simplified method in designing horizontally curved steel Igirder bridges. A parametric study is conducted, using the finite-element analysis software "SAP2000", to examine the key parameters that may influence the load distribution on the curved composite steel girders. Based on the data generated from the parametric study, sets o f empirical equations are developed for the moment and shear distribution factors for straight and curved steel I-girder bridges when subjected to the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) truck loading.

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION

1.1 General
The widely use of elevated highways to alleviate traffic congestions at existing at-grade signalized junctions in urban areas became the common answer to ensure uninterrupted smooth traffic flow in modern heavy traffic networks. One of the major components of the elevated highways is the horizontally curved bridges, which in many cases are located in onand off-ramps with very tight radii of curvature and are characterized by complex vertical
I ;

and horizontal geometries. For this application, curved steel I-girder system is the preferred { choice for most designers for the following reasons: 1. Simplicity of fabrication and construction, 2. Less land is needed during erection, 3. Shallower sections can be designed, 4. Impose lighter weights on bridge foundation when compared to precast/prestressed beams or segmental prestressed concrete box girder deck, 5. Excellent serviceability performance.

Generally, the horizontally curved girder bridges are more attractive to conform to existing terrain. However, from the design point of view, the simple presence of curvature in curved steel girders complicates, to a great extent, their behavior and design considerations over those of straight girders.

There are two fabrication methods of the horizontally curved girders: (a) the flanges are cut from plates to the stipulated curve (cut curve) and are then welded to the web plate, or (b) fabrication o f straight girder is carried out in the conventional manner and then the entire girder is curved to the specific curve by applying heat in a controlled continuous or intermittent manner to the edges of the flanges (heat curve). Figure 1.1 shows typical cross section of a four-girder bridge. It consists of concrete deck slab supported over steel Igirders. To enhance the bridge structural integrity during construction, cross-bracings as well as top and bottom chords are used at equal inteiwals between bridge support lines. In designing highway bridges, bridge codes require dead, live and other types of loads to be considered. For live load design, the codes define a standard truck loading with concentrated wheel loads. Both the longitudinal position and the transverse distribution of the wheel loads are of great importance. In other words, the truck load must be positioned longitudinally to produce the maximum positive and negative bending moments, shear and deflection in the girders. North American Bridge codes define lateral-distribution factors for different materials of construction that specify the fraction of each wheel load that must be applied to each girder. For straight girder bridges, this allows each girder to be designed as an isolated single girder. Thus, the distribution factor is of fundamental importance in bridge design.

1.2 The Problem

\

'

Although horizontally curved bridges constitute roughly one third of all steel bridges, the structural behavior still not well understood (Zureick and Naqib 1999). Curvature greatly complicates the behavior of curved steel used in bridges. It introduces outof-plane "bulging" displacement of the curved web resulting in an increase in stresses. Based on literature review, the investigation of load distribution characteristics of such bridges is needed. Currently, the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2000), as well as the American bridge codes (AASHTO-LRFD, 2004; AASHTO, Guide, 2003; AASHTO, 1996) specify load distribution factor equations for the design of straight composite I-girder bridges and provide geometrically defined criterion when horizontally curved bridges may be treated the same as straight bridges. In both cases, there is no practical design method in the form of expressions for moment, shear and deflection distribution factors for composite concrete-steel I-girder bridges with significant curved alignment. The CHBDC (2000) and the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Horizontally Curved Bridges, (Guide, 2003) have recommended the use of grillage analogy, folded plate, finitestrip, and finite-element methods for analysis of the curved steel bridges. Among the above methods is the finite element method (FEM) which is a matter of concern in this study and is frequently employed for accurate final analysis and results. Unfortunately, most engineers are not familiar with the FEM and are reluctant to use this technique, especially in the preliminary designs because of its time consuming in terms of modeling, results interpretation, when the girders dimensions are not known. Consequently, Â± e need of simplified equations and methods are required to facilitate the design procedure. Hence, a

practical design method in the form o f empirical expressions for moment, shear, and deflection distribution factors need to be developed for curved composite steel I-girder bridges to fill the gabs found in the bridge codes. This study is an endeavor to achieve the abovementioned need. The results and the formulas developed in this study will assist bridge engineers in predicting the live load distribution in the horizontally curved composite steel I-girder bridges more reliably and economically.

of curvature, span length, number of girders, girders spacing, number of designs lanes, cross-bracing intervals, and truck loading conditions, The parametric study was performed using commercially available Finite Element Software "SAP2000" on 240 curved and 80 straight composite I-girder bridge prototypes subjected to CHBDC truck loading and bridges' own weight, 3.

Lastly, Chapter V is the summary and conclusions drawn from this study.

CHAPTER II LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Concept of Lateral Load Distribution Factor
Dead loading and live truck loading are imposed on Bridges. The calculation of dead load, in case of straight bridges, is simple. The distribution of deck slab, wearing surface, and curbs or traffic barriers can be considered evenly among girders. Due to the fact that curbs or traffic barriers are constructed after the concrete deck is cured, for better accuracy, these dead loads can also be considered as the live load applied to the girders. However, this approach is not valid in case of horizontally curved bridges due to the torsion effects resulting from curvature. The curvature tends to increase the longitudinal moment in the outside girder, decrease the longitudinal moment in the inside girder, and have an intermediate effect on the remaining girders. Furthermore, curvature causes torsion and

consequently, lateral bending (warping) in the flanges of the girders that must be considered (Brockenbrough, 1986).

In order to calculate the live load carried by each girder in case of a straight bridge, lateral load distribution factor is a key element and important in analyzing existing bridges and designing new ones. For simplicity, the concept of lateral load distribution factor can be introduced herein by using a straight single girder and multi-girder bridge. Figure (2.1a) shows the free body diagram o f a straight single girder under live load P. Let q (x) be the influence line o f a certain section of the girder, then the internal force at this section can be

calculated as F = P x t] ( x ). It can be inferred from the above figure that this is a simple twodimensional problem since both the load and the girder deformation are in the (x-z) plane. However, the mechanism is totally different for multi-girder straight bridge subjected to live load P, as shown in Figure (2.1b). Lateral rigidity makes the live load P to distribute in the lateral direction (y direction) as well as in the longitudinal direction (x direction). As a result, the live load on the bridge is shared among the girders, and each girder is subjected to different magnitude of the live load. In such case, the live load position and structural deformation are three-dimensional (planes x-y-z) and consequently three-dimension theory is needed to solve the internal forces of the structure. The common characteristic of threedimension theory is that the internal forces and deformation at any point of the structure can be solved directly. Alternatively, the internal forces can be calculated using the influence surface, in the same manner of using influence line to determine the internal forces in the single girder. Let r](x,y) be the influence surface of a certain section of the structure under live load, the response of the structure is then F=P x r\ (x,y). Since the live loads on the bridge are multiple concentrated wheel loads, which can move both longitudinally and transversely, the determination of maximum internal forces using influence surface is still tedious and complicated. Accordingly, the influence surface method is not widely used in practice.

To simplify the analysis, a frequently used method is to convert the complex threedimensional problem Figure (2.1b) into a simple two-dimensional problem Figure (2.1a). The principle of this method is to break down and simplify the two-variable that influence

surface function t| (x,y) into the product of two single-variable functions, that is, r| (x,y) = r\ (x) X 'H(y)- Then the internal force at the section can be expressed as,

F = P x r i ( x ,y ) = P x r i (x)X Ti (y)

( 2 .1 )

Where r\ (x) is the longitudinal influence line of that section for a single girder (Figure 2.1a), T | (y) is the live load distributed to one certain girder when a unit load moves transversely across the bridge, tj fyj is referred to as the transverse influence line for that girder and P x r| (y) is the load distributed to that girder when live load P is at point a(x, y) (Figure 2.1b). As a result, the internal forces at a certain section for a specific girder can be determined using the longitudinal and transverse influence lines, which simplifies the three-dimensional problem. In reality, actual truck loads are multiple wheel loads moving on the bridge. Figure (2.2a) shows a multi-girder bridge subjected to truck loads. The rear, middle and front axle loads of the truck are P I, P2 and P3, respectively. To determine the maximum response at point (k) of girder No. 3, for example, the transverse influence line of girder No. 3, and the worst loading position to determine the maximum magnitude of each axle load distributed to girder No. 3 are first obtained. Secondly, the maximum response at section (k) of girder No. 3 using the longitudinal single girder influence line at section (k) is determined. Obviously, if the positions o f the truck wheels on the bridge are fixed, the load distributed value to girder No. 3 is then fixed. In practice, the product of a factor (g) and the axle load expresses this fixed value. Hence, the loads distributed to girder No. 3 of the rear, middle, and front truck axle loads can be expressed as g P l, gP2, and gP3, respectively, as shown in Figure (2.2b). The factor (g) is referred to'as lateral load distribution factor. It is important to know

that the maximum load distributed to one certain girder (here is girder No. 3) is a fraction of each axle load (usually less than one).

It is noted that it is an approximate approach to convert the three-dimensional problem into a two-dimensional problem, since the paths of the load being distributed to the adjacent girders are eomplex. The concentrated load at one girder would no longer be concentrated load at the same longitudinal position after being distributed to the adjacent girders. However, (Yao, 1990) investigated theoretical and experimental research and showed that the error was relatively small for lateral load distribution by lateral deformation relationship. Moreover, the actual truck load on the bridge is not one single concentrated load, but several wheel loads distributed at different longitudinal positions. Therefore, the error would be even smaller for truck loading. Field testing has shown that distribution factors to be conservative (Mounir, 1997).

The distribution factor (g) is different for each girder within the same bridge. It varies with the variation of truck configuration, tmck longitudinal location on the bridge, and the bridge lateral rigidity. The effect of truck longitudinal location is insignificant and usually the distribution factor at girder maximum response location is used for design. The bridge lateral rigidity is related to the relative stiffness of the girders and the deck. The load distribution between girders is poor for transversely flexible bridges and is even for transversely stiff bridges (Zhang, 2002). Figure (2.3) shows various deflections of the bridge girders in a cross section when subjected to applied load P. In this Figure, E/j- is the bridge transverse or lateral rigidity. Figure (2.3a) shows the deformation of the bridge structure

when the bridge transverse rigidity E I t is zero (very poor rigidity) and the middle girder is subjected to load P . Since the load can only transfer to the middle girder, the distribution factor {g) for the middle girder is one and for other girders is zero. But, when the bridge transverse rigidity is infinity (full rigid section) and the same load P is applied at the middle girder position, " every girder has the same deflection and the same magnitude of the load as shown in figure (2.3c). As a result, the distribution factor (g) is identical for every girder is equal to 1/A, where N is the numbers of girders. For a five- girder bridge shown in Figure 2.3c, the distribution factor {g) is 0.2. While for concrete, reinforced concrete, and steel girder bridges, the transverse rigidity is between zero and infinity. When the middle girder is subjected to load P, as shown in Figure (2.3b), the distribution factor for each girder is between 1/A and one. The determination of the exact magnitude of the live load distributed to each girder is a matter of interest and it is a key issue in bridge analysis and has been studied by many researchers.

The analysis of structures under different types of loadings witnessed great advancement due to the development of fast speed and high capacity computers, many < computer programs were evolved and can be used to accurately analyze the structures under dead and live loads and would promote more realistic calculation of the actual bridge capacity. The availability o f powerful personal computers and finite element analysis software will assist bridge engineers in performing detailed and realistic modeling o f the deck geometry and boundary conditions and then in performing the analysis. However the engineer needs to be familiar with the finite element method, mesh generation and its density, accurate modeling of the geometry and support conditions, selection of proper

10

element types and their material properties, and loading positions that produce the maximum response in the bridge. One way to estimate the maximum moment and shear response in individual bridge girder would be to model the entire bridge in a three dimensional problem which can be solved by using the finite element method (FEM) or other analytical methods and determine all the internal forces and deflections in any individual member. The loading in this case has to be varied, in both longitudinal and transverse positions, to find the worst loading positions. For bridges with very complex configurations, this method might be the only way to determine the accurate maximum moment and shear under live load for each girder. However, for many types of bridges, this process could be very cumbersome and unnecessary. Distribution factors and empirical methods are still the major methods used in design of modem bridges in North America. Empirical formulas were obtained by analyzing many bridge systems and models. The development of the curved girder load distribution factors procedure followed the same technique employed in determining the straight girder load distribution equations. The difference is that to analyze a curved system is more complicated than a straight one. For this reason, the following sections will review available literatures for both straight bridges and curved bridges.

2.2 Review of Previous Research on Load Distribution
2.2.1 Review of Study on Distribution Factors for Straight Bridges
According to the level of bridge lateral rigidity, different methodologies are implemented in practice, including lever mle, eccentric compression method, hinged joint

11

method, fixed joint method, orthotropic plate analogy, AASHTO Standard, AASHTOLRFD and CHBDC simplified method.

2.2.1.1 Lever Rule Method (Yao, 1990)
The lever rule is one o f the most frequently used methods for calculation of distribution factors. In this method the deck between the girders is assumed to acts as a simply supported beam or cantilever beam, as shown in Figure (2,4). In this case, the load on each girder shall be taken as the reaction of the wheel loads. Lever rule is very accurate for two girder bridges. Lever rule can also be used for shear distribution near support, since the load would pass to the pier or abutment mostly through the adjacent two girders. Lever rule can also give very good results when the bridge transverse stiffness is relatively flexible. However, the results usually would be slightly conservative for the interior girders, and unconservative for the exterior girders.

2.2.1.2 Eccentric Compression Method (Yao, 1990)
This method can be applied to "narrow bridge" with adequate diaphragms along bridge span. "Narrow Bridge" is defined as that the ratio of bridge width, B, to span length, L, is less than 0.5, or for B/L is equal to 0.5 satisfying the ratios of bridge longitudinal rigidity per unit length, Dy, to transverse rigidity per unit width, Dx, is greater than 0.48. The deflection o f a narrow bridge with adequate diaphragms under truck load is similar to that of an eccentric compression member, as shown in Figure 2.5. From the theory o f mechanics, when girder k is subjected to load P, the load distributed to girder i is:

12

Rj,= ( . . ! . . + n 2 i=l

- .j .: .-- n Sailli i=l

)* p

(2.2)

Where n is number of girders, /, is the moment of inertia of girder No. i; a,- and a* are the distances from bridge centerline to girder No. i and k respectively. Therefore, the transverse influence line can be obtained from Equation 2.2 when load P is equal to one. If all the girders have the same cross section or the same moment of inertia, the control values of the transverse influence line for girder No. 1 are simplified as (note that ai=a5 ):

Where N is the number of girders. Once the two control values r\ 11 and t|

are determined,

the transverse influence line for girder No 1 is determined. The distribution factor can then be obtained by arranging the trucks transversely on the bridge to get the worst situation. Note that in the above procedure, the girder torque is ignored. When considering the girder torque. Equations (2.3a) and (2.3b) become:

2.2.1.3 Hinged Joint Method (Yao, 1990)
2.2.1.3.1 Hinged Joint Method fo r Slab Bridges

This method can be utilized for slab bridges with pre-cast members connected by tongue-and-groove joint. The deflection of a slab bridge under concentrated wheel load is shown in Figure (2.6a). Figure (2.6b) illustrates the general internal forces occurred at the tongue and groove joint, which are vertical shear g(x), transverse moment m(x), longitudinal shear t(x), and normal force n(x). It was noted that the longitudinal shear t(x) and the normal force n(x) are relatively small compared with vertical shear g(x) when the bridge is subjected to truck load. Because o f the joint is relatively short in configuration and very flexible in resisting moment, the transverse moment m(x) as well as the longitudinal shear t(x) and normal force n(x) can be neglected in analysis. Consequently, the joint can be simplified and

14

considered as a hinge; assuming only vertical shear force g(x) exists, as shown in Figure (2.6c). To convert the three-dimensional problem into a two-dimensional problem, the ratio of the deflection, moment, shear, and applied load, in any two strips or girders must be equal and equal to a constant C, w I (x) W 2 (x) M i (x) Q j (x) P i (x) = ---------- = ---------- = ----------- = C M 2 (x) Q2 (x) P 2 (x)

(2.6)

Sinusoidal load is assumed to meet this requirement and the sinusoidal load is in the form of
JVC

P(x) = Po sin -----

(2.7)

The free body diagram of a slab strip under sinusoidal load is shown in Figure (2.7). The error of the sinusoidal load assumption is very small in view of the fact that along the bridge span there will be many wheel loads. In order to obtain the distribution factor, the girder transverse influence line must be obtained first. For a bridge with n strips, an indeterminate problem of (n-1) order is to be solved to obtain the influence line. For convenience, transverse influence line control values for bridges with 3 to 10 slab strips are tabulated and the tables can be found in Bridge Engineering (Yao, 1990). After the transverse influence line is obtained, trucks can then be arranged transversely across the bridge to find the worst situation and the maximum distribution factors.

2.2.1.3.2

H in g ed jo in t M ethod fo r T-Shaped Girder Bridge

The hinged joint method can also be used for small span concrete T-shaped girdeiL. bridges without intermediate diaphragms. Figures (2.8a) and (2.8b) demonstrate the free body diagrams o f unit length section at bridge middle span of the hinged T-shaped girder bridge under unit sinusoidal load. Unlike the case of slab bridges, the deflection of the Tshaped girder flanges must be considered, as shown in Figures (2.8c) and (2.8d). When the cantilever length is within 0.80 m and the span length is greater than 10 m, the tables for calculating transverse influence line values for hinged slab bridges can also be used for hinged girder bridges. For better accuracy, detailed calculation is required for bridges beyond this range.

2.2.1.4 Fixed Joint Girder method (Yao, 1990)
In case when the lateral connection between girders is stiffer, the joint can be considered as a fixed joint. In addition to shear force at the joint, moment must also be considered, as shown in Figure (2.9). For n-girder Bridge, a 2(n-l) order of indeterminate problem is to be solved to obtain the shear and moment at each joint. However, only shearing force gi is considered for calculating distribution factor. Once g, is known, the same procedure as in hinged joint method can be followed to obtain the transverse influence line as well as the distribution factors.

2.2.1.5 Orthotropic Plate Analogy (Guyon-Massonnet or G-M Method)
In the case of concrete bridges with continuous slab, intermediate diaphragms and when the bridge width to span length ratio B/L greater than 0.5, grillage system may be used

16

to simulate the bridge system. Alternatively, the bridge may be analogized to a rectangular thin plate, which is called orthotropic plate analogy or known as Guyon-Massonnet (G-M) method (Yao, 1990). Orthotropic plate is referred to when a plate possesses elastic properties which are different in x and y directions. Figure (2.10a) shows the longitudinal and transverse configuration of a bridge structure. In this case, the girder spacing is considered as S, girder moment of inertia and torsional inertia are Ix and I tx, respectively, diaphragm spacing is and diaphragm moment of inertia and torsional inertia are ly and Ijy

respectively. For very small values of S and Sc compared to the bridge width and span length, and for fully composite action, we can distribute girder moment of inertia and torsional inertia Ix and hx to the distance S and distribute diaphragm moment of inertia and torsional inertia ly and h y to the distance Sc- Thus, the real grid system in Figure (2.10a) is analogized to an imaginary plate as shown in Figure (2.10b). In Figure (2.10b), the thickness in the x direction is shown in dashed line, which indicates that, the equivalent thickness in the X and y directions are different for the analogized plate. The moment of inertia and torsional inertia per unit width in the j: and y directions for the analogized plate are considered as follows:

For beam and slab concrete bridges and pre-stressed concrete bridges. Poisson's ratio Vcan be neglected for simplicity. In that case, the bridge can be analogized to an orthotropic plate with rigidity per unit width EJx, Gx J tx, Ex Jy. and Ox Jry The analogized orthotropic (in configuration) plate differential equilibrium with Ex=Ey=E and V;c=Vy=v is:

This is identical to the differential equation for orthotropic plate (in material elastic properties). This means that analogized orthotropic (in configuration) plate can be solved the same way as orthotropic (in material properties) plate, except that the stiffness constants contained in the equations are different.

The internal forces can be obtained by solving the above equation for displacement w under applied load. Directly solving the partial differential equation is difficult. For convenience, solution charts had been developed by Guyon and Massonnet, which can be found in Bridge Engineering (Yao, 1990) and can be used to easily obtain the transverse influence line. Once the transverse influence line is obtained, the distribution factors can be obtained by arranging the trucks transversely on the bridge.

2.2.1.6 AASHTO Methods
AASHTO introduced empirical methods which are more convenient to use as Compared with the theoretical methods mentioned above. AASHTO defines the distribution factor as the ratio o f the moment (or shear) obtained from the bridge system to the moment

18

(or shear) obtained from a single girder loaded by one truck wheel line {AASHTO Standard 1996) or the axle loads {AASHTO-LRFD 2004). It should be noted that AASHTO Standard Specifications and AASHTO LRFD Specifications define the live load differently. The live load in the Standard specifications consists of an HS 20 truck or a lane load. While, the live load in the LRFD specifications consists of an HS 20 truck in conjunction with a lane load. Since both trucks have a 1.8 m axle (gauge) width, it is assumed that the difference in the live load configuration does not affect the lateral load distribution (Wassef, 2004).

2.2.1.6.1

A A SH T O Standard M ethod 1996

AASHTO Standard specifications (1996) contain simple procedures used in the analysis and design of highway bridges. AASHTO adopted the simplified formulas for distribution factors based on the work done in the 1940s by Newmark (1948). AASHTO typical procedure is used to calculate the maximum bending moment based on a single line of wheel loads from the HS20 design truck or lane loading. This calculated bending moment is then multiplied by the load distribution factor (S/5.5) or in the format of {S/D), where S is the girder spacing in feet and D is a constant based on the bridge type to obtain the moment in an individual girder. This method is applicable to straight and right (non-skewed) bridges only. It was proved to be accurate when girder spacing was near 1.8m and span length was about 18 m (Zokaie, 2000). For relatively medium or long bridges, these formulas would lose accuracy.

19

2.2.1.6.2

AASHTO LRFD Method

The specifications outlined in Load and Resistance Factor Design, LRFD Design specifications (AASHTO, 1994b) were adopted. This code introduced another load

distribution factors based on a comprehensive research project, National Cooperation Highway Research Program (NCHRP) 12-26 which was entitled "Distribution of Live Loads on Highway Bridges" and initiated in 1985, consequently the guide specification for Distribution of Loads for Highway Bridges (AASHTO, 1994a) was found. This guide recommends the use of simplified formulas, simplified computer analysis, and/or detailed finite-element analysis (FEA) in calculating the actual distribution of loads in highway bridges. It was noted that those new formulas were generally more complicated than those recommended by the Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges (the above AASHTO 1996), but their use is associated with a greater degree of accuracy (Munir, 1997). For example the lateral load distribution factor for bending moment in interior girders of concrete slab on steel girder bridge superstructure is:

g = 0.15 + (S /3 f^ (S /L f^ (K g /1 2 L t\f^

(2.11)

Where g = wheel load distribution factor; S = girder spacing (ft, 3.5 < S < 16); L = span length o f the beam (ft, 20 < L < 200); tg = concrete slab thickness (in., 4.5 < t < 12); Kg = longitudinal stiffness parameter = n(l + .A e \); n = modular ratio between beam and deck material; 1 = moment o f inertia o f beam (in."^); A = cross-sectional area of beam (sq in.) and C g = distance between the center o f gravity of the basic beam and deck (in.).

20

AASHTO LRFD Specifications have become highly attractive for bridge engineers because of its incentive permitting the better and more economical use of material. The rationality of LRFD and its many advantages over the Allowable Stress Design method, ASD, are indicative that the design philosophy will downgrade ASD to the background in the next few years (Salmon and Johnson, 1996). The research results were first adopted by AASHTO Standards in 1994 and were then officially adopted by AASHTO-LRFD in 1998. More parameters, such as girder spacing, bridge length, slab thickness, girder longitudinal stiffness, and skew effect are considered in the developed formulas which earned them sound accuracy. The AASHTO-LRFD formulas were evaluated by Shahawy and Huang (2001), their evaluation showed a good agreement with test results for bridges with two or more loaded design lanes, provided that girder spacing and overhang deck did not exceed 2.4 m and 0.9 m, respectively. Outside of these ranges, the error could be as much as up to 30%. For one loaded design lane, the relative error was less than 10% for interior girders and could be as high as 100% and as low as -30% for exterior girders. Shahawy and Huang (2001) presented modification factors for the AASHTO LRFD formulas and the results of the modified formulas showed good agreement with their test results.

2.2.1.7 Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, 2000 (CHBDC)
The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, CAN/CSA-S6-00 is the 9'*' edition of the CSA Standard CAN/CSA-S6. It amalgamates and supersedes both the CAN/CSA-S6-88, Design of Highway Bridges, and the OHBDC-91-01, Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code, 3 " ^ ^ Edition. Earlier Editions of the Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code (OHBDC) were

21

published in 1983, and 1979 by the Ministry o f Transportation o f Ontario. Earlier editions of the CSA Standards were published in 1978, 1974, 1966, 1952, 1938, 1929, and 1922. The above CHBDC used the limit state design philosophy and introduced simplified methods for the analysis of different types of bridges after satisfying certain conditions. In its simplified methods of analysis, CHBDC defines the lateral load distribution factors as amplification factors that used to account for the transverse variation in maximum longitudinal moments and shear intensities. The moment distribution factor is Fm and defined as: SN_ ---- - 3: ^ \iCf F \ 1+ l 100.

2.2.1.8 Other Studies
Besides the AASHTO formulas, numerous papers have been published for load distribution factors since 1950. Their findings are invaluable for further studies. Kostem and DeCastro (1977) showed that the contribution of diaphragms to lateral load distribution was marginal regardless of the loading pattern. Many graphical and simplified computer based methods are also available for calculating wheel load distribution. Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code (OMTC, 1983) used a one popular technique of design charts, However, Hayes et al. (1986) developed a grillage analysis and simple computer program, SALOD [developed at the University of Florida], to evaluate the lateral load distribution of simplespan bridges in flexure, which have become more acceptable than monographs and design charts. Bakht and Moses (1988) presented a procedure to calculate the constant D in the AASHTO load distribution formula {S/D). Tarshini and Frederick (1992), using FEM, they studied the effect of various parameters on wheel load distribution for I-girder highway bridges and found that composite and non composite construction showed a negligible effect; the effect of the most common types of channel diaphragm and cross bracing between beams had negligible effect.

2.2.2 Distribution Factors for Curved Bridges
The first treatment of the analysis of curved beams was presented in 1843 by BarrÃ© de Saint Venant as referred by Zureik (1998, 1999). McManus et al. (1969) presented the first survey of the most published works related to horizontally curved bridges. His

bibliography list contained 202 references. After that his paper was discussed by Ketcheck

23

(1969); Pandit et al, (1970) who added additional references to the original list. Even though thousands of articles on the subject have appeared in the literatures, however, serious studies pertaining to the analysis and design of horizontally curved bridges begun only in 1969 when the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in the United States formed the Consortium o f University Research Teams (CURT). This team consisted of Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Rhode Island, and Syracuse University, whose research efforts, along with those at University of Maryland, resulted in the initial development of working Stress Design (WSD) or Allowable Stress Design (ASD) criteria and tentative design specifications. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the AASHTO Task Committee on flexural members (1977) compiled the results o f most o f the research efforts prior to 1976 and presented a set of recommendations pertaining to the design of curved I-girder bridges. The CURT research activity was followed by the development of Load Factor Design (LFD) criteria (Stegmann and Galambos 1976, Galambos 1978) adopted by AASHTO to go along with the ASD criteria. These provisions appeared in the first Guide (1980) as well as the Guide (1993). It is worthwhile to mention that the AASHTO guide specification for horizontally curved highway bridges (1993) is primarily based upon research work conducted prior to 1978.

2.2.2.1 Heins and Siminou's Study
In their study, Heins and Siminou (1970) presented and explained a simplified method for evaluating the internal forces and deformations in radial curved girder system. They introduced equations and factors that permit the determination of required crosssectional properties in a single, two, and three-span curved girder system, which are

24

necessary in utilizing various computer programs. A series of factors were developed by comparing single straight; single curved; and curved system. They used AASHTO HS20-44 truck loading, and utilized two, three, and four trucks for four, six and eight girder system respectively. The introduced factors were: Amplification Factor,

Where

girder, and fay is the reaction on a system of curved girders. The studies, which were conducted, resulting in design equations, have the following limitations: 1. Girder spacing may be 2.1, 2.4, 2.7or 3 m. 2. Individual girder span lengths varied from 15 to 30m. 3. The girders of the system must have a constant curvature limited to radii of 30 to 180 m. 4. The number of girders in the system may be 4, 6 or 8. 5. Only two-and three-span continuous bridges were examined, withall interior end spans of equal length. Heins and Siminou's concluded their study by introducing design charts for modification factors of moment, shear, deflection, rotation, and warping torsion.

25

2.2.2.2 AASHTO Methods
2.2.2.2.1 ^^SH TO Guide Commentary Method

The Guide Commentary of the AASHTO Specifications 1993, (Guide, 1993), which as mentioned earlier adopted the research results of Heins and Siminou (1970), gives the distribution factors for bending moment as:

g=

-- L ( N + 3) -- +0.7 5.5 4R

(2.15)

where S = girder spacing in ft. (7 < S < 12), R N = (R > 100 ft.), 100 L = span length in ft., and R = radius o f curvature in ft. (R > 100ft). It is interesting to note that Equation 2.15 is analogous to AASHTO Standard equation S/D. This equation is intended to present moment distribution o f the exterior girder and would be increasingly conservative for other girders across the bridge. Heins-Siminou's result is too conservative, mainly because of that the entire deck in the three-dimensional model was not included. This method was omitted from the current version of the AASHTO Guide (Guide, 2004)

2.2.2.2.2

AASHTO Guide Method

The effect o f lateral bracing was considered in AASHTO Guide Specifications for Horizontally Curved Bridges (1993). The AASHTO Guide equations take into account the

26

effect of lateral bracing, connecting the bottom flanges of the girders. The distribution factors for both ASD and LRFD, in terms of the resulting maximum live load (normal stress component + warping stress component) bottom flange stress in the girder, can be calculated as: For outside exterior girder: 3 .0 -0 .0 6 (L)
S e b f-- 3/2

L + 0.9 R `l + 0.95 or bottom lateral bracing in every other bay (2.17) R for all bays with bottom lateral bracing (2.16)

For inside exterior girder: ' --

- 0.366 X --

8 ib f -- 8 ebf

- 0.473 X

L R

All the dimensions in the equations (2.16) through (2.19) are in feet. Where, L is the outside exterior girder span length, S is the girder spacing, and R is the radius of curvature of the outside exterior girder. The maximum live load flange stress is obtained by multiplying the distribution factor with the maximum stress based on grid analysis.

2.2.2.2.3

AASHTO with V-Load Modification Method

The history of the V-load method started in 1963 when it was presented by USX in their report entitled USS Stmctural report, Analysis and Design of Horizontally Curved Steel Bridge Girders. It was a simplified analysis of two-girder curved bridge. And it was presented in 1965 as a chapter in U.S. Steel's Highway Structures Design Handbook. The V-

27

Load method was a computer programmed about 1966 which was used for the analysis and design o f many curved bridges in the 1970 (Poellot, 1987). However, a limitation was that the method and the program were applicable only to structures with radial support lines. In the early o f 80s, the V-Load method continued to serve as a state of the art design tool when it was applied to skewed bridges by USS Research. And it was first recognized by AASHTO through some provisions included in ASSHTO Guide Specifications for Horizontally Curved Bridges (1980). Figure (2.11), shows the interaction forces in two girder system

between girder and floor-beam consist of lateral reactive H forces along with vertical shears

V. If the cross fames are spaced at a distance d, then the radial flange reaction at girder (1) is
H i = M id i/h R i and at girder (2) is % = M idi/hRz. And with concentric girders and radial cross frames d l/R l = d2/R2, hence the vertical shear force V between the cross frame and the girder is obtained from the static's:

V=(H1+H2)h/D = (M l+M 2)/(RD/d) = (Ml+M2)/K

(2.20)

Where K=RD/d is a constant. Those shear forces then react on the girders resulting in a set o f self-equilibrating girder shears. The net effect of the shears is to shift the total load on the curved bridge toward the outside girder because they produced moments in the girders outside o f the bridge centerline which add to those that would exist in a straight girder o f the same developed length, and moments in the girders inside of the bridge centerline which subtract from those that would exist in a straight girder of the same developed length. These girder shears, which are applied as the external loads to the equivalent straight structure to account for the curvature, are

known as the V- loads.

28

Application of the external V-loads ensures that the internal forces in the straight structure be nearly the same as those that exist in the curved structure under applied vertical loads. In the V-Load analysis of a Multi-girder system, the bending moments caused by the applied vertical loads at the cross bracings in each isolated developed straight girder are first determined by applying the loads to straight girders. These vertical-bending moments will hereafter be referred to as primary moments. The corresponding V-load moments, which are caused by the V-load and are referred to as secondary moments, are then determined by applying the V- loads in the proper directions to the straight girders at the cross bracings. The final moments in the curved girder are then obtained by simply summing the respective straight-girder primary and secondary moments. The V-load is calculated by (Grubb, 1984):

V = Z M p /(C x K )
Where

( 2 .2 1 )

X Mp = summation of the primary moments in each girder at a particular cross bracing, C =coefficient depending on the number of girder in the system (see Table 2.1), K = (R X D )/S d , R and Sd are for the outside girder Where R = radius of curvature in feet, Sd = diaphragm spacing, and
D

= girder spacing.

The distribution factor can then be calculated as:

S primary + secondary moment gB = -- X :----------------5.5 primary moment

(2.22)

29

This method is referred to as the AASHTO with modified V-load Method. The results were proved to agree with those from the FEM analysis (Brockenbrough, 1986) for exterior girder and to be conservative for the interior girders.

2.2.2.3 Heins and Jin's Method
The effect o f cross bracing spacing on curved bridge distribution factors was studied by Heins and Jin (1984). They investigated single-girder system and multi-girder system. They developed a space model frame idealization and used grid analysis for obtaining their results. They produced number of graphs and equations that correlate the effect of the cross bracing and distribution factor, one major finding was as follows:

S 5.5

0 .0 0 8 3

S

R

-hl.O (0.4)

(2.23)

Where g is the distribution factor. Sc is the cross bracing spacing in feet, S is girder spacing in feet. The above distribution factor included the warping effect, and hence the equation 2.23 showed a good agreement with Brockenbrough's, 1986 Study.

2 2.2.4 Y o g and Littrell's Study
Y oo and Littrell (1985) studied the response of a system of 5 girders horizontally curved, connected by a slab and cross bracing under dead load and live load using threedimensional finite-element method (Sap6). There study considered the following different value parameters: radius; length; and number of braced intervals. They developed empirical

30

design equations to predict the ratio of: (a) Maximum bending stress; (b) maximum warping stress; and (c) maximum deck deflection. Their findings were (1) maximum bending stresses and maximum deck deflections stabilized with minimal bracing; (2) warping stresses were sensitive to the number of braced intervals. They also observed that partially loaded lanes; 2 trucks out of 3 trucks (deck width capacity) located near the outside edge of the bridge produced higher stresses and deflection in the curved bridges due to the tilting of the bridge deck created by the nonsymmetrical load distribution.

2.2.2.S Brockenbrough's Study
Brockenbrough (1986) utilized a 3-dimensinal model to study the effect of various parameters on the load distribution for 4-girder curved bridge using FEM. His model was 2span continuous structure comprised of composite concrete deck with steel I-shape girder and intermediate transverse cross frames between girders. His findings were as follows: (1) the central angle per span, which includes the combined effect of curvature and span length had larger effects, (2) the girder spacing, had larger effects identified; (3) variation in girder stiffness and cross-frame spacing had relatively small effects on live-load distribution factors. Brockenbrough also provided charts depicting the variation of the distribution factors with the variation of these parameters.

2.2.2.6 Schelling, Namini, Fu's Study
Schelling and Namini, (1989) studied the response of simple and continuous span horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges with and without cross bracing, during construction phase due to self own weight. They utilized 3-dimensional space frame model

31

and developed empirical equations of moment distribution factors for two, four, and six girders bridges to determine the effect of the lateral bracing on curved bridges during construction. Their analysis revealed that the results from the simple-span can be applied conservatively to the continuous span bridges provided that the supports and radial and the span length ratios do not differ greatly from unity. The empirical equation they developed had a drawback because it can be used in conjunction with the results given by the 2dimentional grid analysis method. Another thing, is the range of the bridges spans considered in their models were (36m to 90m) which are not practical for slab on steel Igirder bridges.

2 .2 .2 .7

Davidson, Keller, and Y o g 's study
Davidson et al. (1996) studied the effect of a number of parameters on the behavior

o f the horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges connected by cross bracings. Their model comprised o f 3-girder Bridge and used shell elements to model the concrete deck; and girders webs, whereas they used beam elements to model flanges, shear connectors and cross frames. Finite-element, ABAQUS software was utilized for their investigation. The above study resulted with the conclusions of that the (1) span length, (2) radius of curvature, (3) flange width, and (4) cross frame spacing; have the greatest effect on the warping-tobending stress ratio. Based on this information, a regression analysis was performed to predict the effect of these parameters on the warping-to-bending stress ratio. Consequently, an equation was developed from this regression and proposed for the preliminary cross frame spacing design:

Where Smax is the maximum bracing spacing in meters, L is the span length in meters, R is the radius of curvature in meters, and bf is the flange width in millimeters.

2.2.2.S Eissa, et. al. study
The shear distribution in curved steel I-girder bridges at construction phase (due to self weight loading) was studied by Eissa et. al, (2000). They utilized finite-element software SAP2000 to carry out bridge modeling. A three-dimensional, four-node shell element was used to model the steel web, and two-node element was used to model the top and bottom steel flanges. They studied the effect of number of parameters on the behavior of shear distribution in curved steel I-girder bridge system, these parameters were; span-to radius ratio (L/R), span length, number of girders, girder spacing and type of supports. For 3, 4, and 5 girders bridge models and for 15m, 25m, and 35m span lengths. Part of their findings was proposing empirical expressions to determine the reaction forces at the supports (hinges or rollers). Other parts of their findings were deduced that the degree of curvature (L/R) ratio, number of girders, span length, and girder spacing were considered as key parameters affecting the structural response of such bridges.

2.2 2.9 Zhang's study
Zhang H., (2002) studied the load distribution factors for curved I-girder bridges using finite-element method. A total of 111 bridge models with radius of curvature less than

33

450m were selected in his study, subjected to AASHTO truck loading. Mr. Zhang considered the following range of parameters in his study: > > > > > > > Radius o f Curvature: 45 to 450 m; Girder spacing: 1.8 to 5.0 m; Span length: 15 to 70 m; Slab thickness: 170 to 300 mm; Longitudinal stiffness: 32122 to 72226 cm *^; Number o f girders: 3 to 7; Cross frame spacing: 2 to 7 m; He concluded that radius of curvature, girder spacing, and number of girders had significant effect on the load distribution. Whereas, span length, slab thickness, and longitudinal stiffness had slight effect. Moreover the effect of cross frame spacing and girder torsional inertia could be neglected. He also concluded that the shear distribution factors have similar trend as that of moment distribution factors. The difference is that the shear distribution factor o f the outside exterior girder and the inside exterior girder are close. Mr. Zhang developed simplified equations for positive moment, negative moment, and shear distribution factors for exterior and interior girders due to one-lane loading and multiple-lane loading. It was found that the distribution factors of the outside exterior girder positive moment obtained from AASHTO Guide Commentary method (1993) for multiple-lane loading were less conservative compared with the results of FEM analysis. However, the results obtained from AASHTO Guide Commentary were too conservative for other cases. AASHTO-LRFD

34

formulas for straight bridges led to either larger or smaller results when used for curved bridges. The Heins and Jin's formula was too conservative for all cases.

2.2.2.10

WassePs study

Wassef, (2004) conducted a theoretical study on 192 simply supported straight and curved concrete slab-on-steel I-girder bridge prototypes to evaluate their structural response. He examined the influence of several parameters on the moment, deflection, and warping stress distribution in such bridges using commercially available finite-element computer software SAP2000. In the study the bridge models were subjected to the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) CL-625 truck and lane loading and dead loading. The study considered the following parameters; > Span length; 15, 25, and 35 m;

> Girder spacing; 2, 2.5, and 3 m > Number of girders; 3, 4, 5, 6, & 7 for 2 m girder spacing; 3, 4, 5, & 6 for 2.5 m girder spacing; 3, 4 & 5 for 3 m girder spacing; > Span-to-radius ratio, L/R; 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, & 0.3 for span L=15 m; 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, & 0.5 for span L=25 m; 0.0,0.1,0.4, & 0.7 for span L=35 m The study findings were; (1) curvature is the most critical parameter that influence the design of curved bridges; (2) other parameters like span length, number of girders, and girder spacing affect the values of the moment and deflection distribution factors in general; (3) Full bridge live loading does not necessary produce the extreme design values of the moment or deflection distribution factors; (4) warping-to-bending stress ratio values were

35

acceptable and within the limits, except for bridge with L/R ratio 0.7 and span length 35m; (5) CHBDC moment and deflection distribution factors overestimate the structural response o f straight bridges.

2.3

Review of Linear Elastic Behaviour of Curved I- Girder System
The behavior of thin-walled members of open cross-section under flexure and torsion

has been established for a long time and has been reviewed in many books on elementary mechanics. A recent comprehensive presentation of the basic theory of thin-walled beams, including flexure, torsion, distortion, and stress distribution, can be found in "Analysis and D esign o f Curved Steel B ridges" (Nakai and Yoo, 1988). In curved bridge, the curvature makes the cross bracings (or diaphragms) to resist torsional loads, which are of importance for curved bridge stability. Correspondingly, cross bracings introduce restoring torques to the girders and therefore cause non-uniform torsions in the girders. The torsions are resisted partly by St.-Venant torsion and to some extent by warping torsion. The warping causes lateral bending m om ent of the top and bottom flanges. The product of the lateral flange moment and lever arm of the couple (less than girder depth) is often referred to as bimoment (in the unit o f force x length^). This bimoment causes twisting of the curved girders about their longitudinal axes. For compression flange, the axial flange force tends to accentuate curvature while the lateral flange bending moment tends to reduce it. However, the net effect is always to increase curvature of the compression flange. For tension flange, the axial force tends to reduce the curvature and the lateral flange bending moment tends to increase it. The net effect can be either to increase or decrease the curvature of the tension flange, depending on flange stress and stiffness.

Review of Analysis Methods for Curved System
In reality the exact solution of the above Equation 2 3 7 is difficult and complex.

Therefore for practical purposes, it is required to adopt other types of solutions which should be easier and sufficiently accurate. The analysis methods found in the literature can be classified into two major categories: approximate and refined methods as follows, Zureick and Naqib, (1999):

40

2.4.1 Approximate methods

'

From its name, approximate methods require a least modeling effort from the designer, and therefore, are adequate for preliminary analysis and design purposes. The following are some most frequently used in the analysis of curved bridges: Â· Â· Â· The Plane-grid method The Space-frame method The V-load method

2.4.1.1 The Plane-grid or Grillage method
This method was first introduced in year 1965 by Lavelle and Boick and further developed in 1971 by Lavelle et al. and in 1975 by Lavelle and Laska. This method model the structure as an assemblage of two-dimensional grid members with one translational and two rotational degrees of freedom. It is advisable to mention that this method does not account for warping (Zureick and Naqib, 1999). The advantages of this method are: (1) integration of stresses is not required, shear and moment values on girders are directly obtained; (2) simple beam theory can be used to distribute the wheel load to adjacent nodes when loads are applied between the nodal points; (3) it utilizes a less computer running time with a plain grid idealization and only moderate effort is required for modeling. Whereas the disadvantages of this method are: (1) the method is non rigorous and does not exactly converge to the exact solution of the mathematical model; (2) Experience is required with the grillage method (the mesh design and refinement can be artistic) in order to obtain good solutions; (3) some discretion is required for assigning the cross section properties.

41

2.4.1.2

The Space-frame method
This method was first introduced in year 1973 by Brennan and Mandel for the

analysis o f open and closed curved members. This method idealized the curved members as three-dimensional straight members. In this method diaphragms and lateral bracing are assumed as truss-like members that can carry only axial loads. The warping effect is not usually included in this analysis (Zureick and Naqib, 1999).

2.4.1.3

The V-Load method (Grubb 1984)
Developed in the early of 1960's, the V-Load method is a simplified

approximate analysis method for curved I-girder bridges. The United State Steel Corp had initially extended the V-Load method to multi-girder bridges. The V-Load method evaluates curved girders as a system of straight girders with additional loads externally applied (VLoad) to account the effect of curvature and can be considered as a two-step process. First, equivalent straight girders with span lengths equal to the arc lengths instead of the individual curved girders are used so that the applied vertical loads are assumed to induce only longitudinal girder stresses. Second, self-equilibrating external vertical shear forces (acting on diaphragm location) are applied to the straight structure so that the resulting internal forces are the same as those existing in the curved structure subjected to only vertical load (refer to Figure 2.11). Thus, in the V-Load development, the curvature forces on the equivalent straight structure are treated as externally applied load. These loads are dependent on the radius o f curvature, the bridge width, and diaphragm spacing (refer to Equation 2.24). The V-load method was found suitable for approximate analysis of composite sections, variable radius o f curvature, and skewed supports. The effects of bracing in the plane o f the

42

bottom flange are not considered. The dead load results obtained from the V-load methc were proved to be very close to those obtained from the FEM analysis. For live load, th lateral load distribution factor used in the V-load analysis has a significant influence on th results. However; the V-load method has some drawbacks as follows: the V-Load method i not valid when lateral bracing was present, furthermore, it is not accurate in predicting diaphragm shear forces (McElwain and Laman, 2000); also it underestimate the innermos girder stresses, does not consider bracing effect in the plane of the bottom flange, and its reliability depends on the selection of the proper live-load distribution factors. Thus the Vload method can only be recommended for preliminary analysis (Zureiek et. al. 1998).

2.4.2 Refined methods
The refined methods are more reliable, elaborate, computationally intensive, and time eonsuming in terms of modeling. And hence these methods are used for final or detailed analysis. Some major refined methods are stipulated as follows: *t* The Finite-strip method  The Finite-difference method  Analytical solution to differential equations  ÃŽ* The Slope deflection method  The Finite-element method

43

2.4.2.1

The Finite-strip method
The curved bridge is divided in this numerical method into many narrow strips in the

circumferential direction that are supported in their radial direction. The analysis of this method considers bending, membrane action, warping, and distortional effect. This method has been successfully utilized to analyze composite curved box and plate girders with complete and incomplete interaction, using curved strip elements for the concrete slab and steel girder and spring elements for shear connectors (Arizumi et al., 1982). This method provides some simplicity (since only one single variable in the circumferential direction is considered in the function, i.e. smaller unknown required) over the finite-element method, however it does not offer the flexibility and the versatility of the latter method (Zureick and Naqib, 1999).

2.4.2.2

The Finite-difference method
This method was utilized in the dynamic analysis of curved bridges with large

deflections and small rotations (Tene al et. 1975; Sheinman 1982). The basic of this method is superimposing a grid on the structure and the governing differential equations are replaced by algebraic difference equations that are solved for each grid point.

2.4.2.3

Analytical solution to differential equations
An analytical solution to the Governing Differential Equations (GDE) is obtained in

the method. The solution is usually a closed form or a convergent series solution, such as a

44

Fourier series. This method was used in studying curved bridge dynamic response (Culver

1967; Montaivao e Silva and Urgueira 1988).

2.4.2A

The Slope deflection method
The partial differential equations are established in terms of slope-deflectior

equations, and the solution is assumed to be a Fourier series. The effects of curvature, nonuniform torsion, and diaphragms are included the above analysis. The COBRA (Curved Orthotropic Bridge Analysis) program (Bell and Heins 1969), developed by University ol Maryland, is based on analytical techniques of the slop-deflection-Fourier series and it is recommended by AASHTO Guide Specifications of 1993 to study composite and non composite girder-slab action. This method was proved by experiment to be an accurate analytical method of curved orthotropic deck bridge systems (Heins and Bell 1972).

2.4.2.S The Finite-Element Method (FEM), By Logan (2002)
This is the most famous and widely used method in many engineering applications. The principal of this numerical method is discretizing the structure into small divisions, or elements, where each element is defined by specific number of nodes (hence this process of modeling a body by dividing it into an equivalent system of smaller bodies or units called finite elements). The finite-element method is a numerical acceptable solution, it formulation of the problem results in a system of simultaneous algebraic equations for solution, rather than requiring analytical solutions (solutions of ordinary or differential equations), which because of the complicated geometries, loadings, and material properties,

45

are not usually obtainable. The behavior of each element, and ultimately the structure, is assumed to be a function o f its nodal quantities (displacements and/or stresses), which considered as the primary unknown of its nodal quantities. The modern development o f the finite-element method began by Hrennikoff in the 1941 and McHenry in 1943 using (one dimensional) elements (bars and beams) in the field of structural engineering. In 1947 Levy developed the flexibility or force method, and in 1953 he suggested that another method (the stiffness or displacement method) could be a promising alternative for use in analyzing statically redundant aircraft structures. However his equations were cumbersome to solve by hand, and hence it only became popular after the advent of the high speed computers. Turner et al. was the first who introduced the treatment of two-dimensional elements in 1956, they derived stiffness matrices for truss elements, beam elements, and two-dimensional triangular and rectangular elements in plane stress. The finite-element method extended to cover threedimensional problems only after the development of tetrahedral stiffness matrix which was done by Martin in 1961.

2. 4,2.5.1

T hree-D im ensional M ethod

University o f Pennsylvania developed the STACRE (Shore and Wilson, 1973) computer program which is characterized by a fully compatible three-dimensional flat plate circular element. Many different elements and shape functions have been studied since then, including using segmental and quadrilateral element for plate bending, annular conforming and fully compatible four-node segment element for thin plates, horizontally curved threenode isoparametric beam element, three-dimensional beam element with axial and transverse displacements or arbitrary polynomial order, and so on. General finite element

46

packages, such as ABAQUS, ADINA, ALGOR, SAP, ANASYS and MSC/NASTRAN ar also frequently used for curved bridges. The rapid advancement of computer technolog; representing in producing high-speed and high capacity computer allows the three dimensional modeling be possible. The bridge deck is usually modeled as shell element including membrane and bending effects. Girder flanges are usually modeled as bean elements to include axial and bending strains in two directions and torsional effects. Girdei web can be modeled as shell element to account for the bending stiffness. Rigid beams are usually used to connect the deck slab to girder flange and simulate the composite action with slab. Cross bracings and wind bracings can be modeled as hinged bar element. Three-dimensional plate/shell models can consider unusual geometry and complex configuration and can get the most accurate results. The disadvantages are: (a) since most of the programs do not allow loads to be placed at any point on the elements, equivalent nodal loads must be calculated with care and the mesh must be fine enough to minimize errors that may arise because of load approximations; (b) since the programs report stresses and strains other than shear and moment values, calculation of shear and moment values from the stresses must be carefully performed through integration over the beam section, and (c) integration of stresses at node points is normally less accurate and may lead to inaccurate results.

CHAPTER III FINITE-ELEMENT ANALYSIS
3.1 General
The advancement o f computers in terms of speed and storage capacity has led the engineering researches to enter a new era. More extensive and approximate numerical solutions to complicated engineering problems were initiated due to the wide use o f the finite element method. Finite element analysis has proven to give reliable results when compared to experimental findings; this built up trust encouraged the designers and code writers to allow the implementation of the finite element method in the analysis and design o f different engineering structures. The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC 2000), section 5.9, permits the use of six different refined methods of analysis for short and medium span bridges. The finite element method is one of the methods recognized by CHBDC. Of all the above-mentioned six permitted methods, the finite element method is considered to be the most powerful, and versatile. Stipulated below the most important advantages o f the finite element method: 1- Solutions can be without the use of governing differential equations, 2- It permits the combination of various structural elements such as plates, beams, and shells, 3- It is able to analyze structures having arbitrary geometries with any material variations thereof, 4- It is possible to automate every step involved in the method.

48

As a result, the finite-element method is very suitable for the analysis of curveÂ» composite I-girder bridges. The recent development in finite-element methods has facilitateÂ» to model a bridge in a very realistic manner and to provide a full description of its structura response within the elastic and post-plastic stages of loading.

In this chapter a brief description of finite-element approach will be reviewed as wel as descriptions of modeling the different components of the composite I-girder bridges. The models that intended to be analyzed by the finite-element method comprised of the reinforced concrete deck, steel top flanges, steel webs, steel bottom flanges, and cross bracing as described in subsequent sections in this chapter. The available commercial finiteelement program, SAP2000 (Wilson and Habibullah, 2002), was utilized through this study to determine the structural response of the modeled bridge prototypes. A general description of this software is presented later in this chapter. The procedure to perform an extensive parametric study on selected straight and curved bridge prototypes, loading cases, and different bridge configurations, to evaluate loads distribution characteristics is explained also in this chapter.

As mentioned earlier, the presence of curvature induces non-uniform torsion in the curved girders which as a result produces lateral bending moment (warping or bi-moment) in the top and bottom flanges that must be considered. Hence, the design of such girders becomes complicated. The methodology of how to obtain the warping-to-bending stress ratio is presented at the end of this chapter.

49

3.2

Finite-Element Approach
The finite-clement method is a numerical method for solving problems of

engineering and mathematical physics. It is the best solution for problems involving complicated geometries, loading, and material properties, when it is generally not possible to obtain analytical mathematical solution. This numerical method of analysis which begins by dividing a body into an equivalent system of smaller bodies or units (finite-elements) interconnected at points (nodes) common to two or more elements and/or boundary lines and/or surfaces is called discretization. Hence, instead of solving the problem for the entire body in one operation, it facilitates the formation of equations for each finite-element and at the end; it will combine them to obtain the solution of the whole body. For the purpose of sim plifying the formulation o f the above elements equations, matrix methods are implemented. Matrix methods are considered as an important tools used to structure the program o f the finite-element methods to facilitate their computation process in high-speed computers. In general there are two approaches associated with the finite-element; (1) force or flexibility method, and (2) displacement or stiffness method. It has been shown that for computational purposes, the latter method is more desirable because its formulation is simpler for most structural analysis problems; moreover a vast majority of general-purpose finite-element programs have incorporated the displacement formulation for solving structure problems. The finite-element method uses different types of elements; (1) one dimensional element or so called linear element; (2) two-dimensional element which can be in the forms o f plane element or triangular and quadrilateral shape elements; and (3) threedimensional solid shape elements.

50

Selecting the most appropriate element type should be to model the most closely to th( actual physical behavior. An equation is then formulated combining all the elements to obtain : solution for one whole body. Using a displacement formulation, the stiffness matrix of eact element is derived and the global stiffness matrix of the entire structure can be formulated bj the direct stiffness method. This global stiffness matrix, along with the given displacemeni boundary conditions and applied loads is then solved, thus that the displacements and stresses for the entire system are determined. The global stiffness matrix represents the nodal forcedisplacement relationships and is expressed in a matrix equation form as follows: [P] = [KJ[U] Where: [P] [K] [U] = = = nodal load vector; the global stiffness matrix; the nodal displacement vector; (3.1)

3.3

SAP2000 Computer Program
The available commercial software "SAP2000" is a structural analysis program that

employs the finite-element method in the analysis and designs of complicated structures. This program has a range of capabilities depending on the version used. SAP2000 is also capable of analyzing structures in static and/or dynamic modes. Its finite-element library consists of six elements. 1- Two-dimensional PLANE element 2- Three-dimensional FRAME element. 3- Three-dimensional SHELL element

51

4- Two-dimensional SOLID element 5- Three-dimensional SOLID element 6- Three- dimensional NLLINK element In addition, subsets o f these elements with varying degrees o f freedom are available in the form o f truss, frame, membrane, beam, strain, gap, and hook elements.

3.4

CHBDC Design Loading
The design o f Highways and Bridges in Canada has its own criteria in terms of the

critical live loads selected in the design. Two types of live loads were specified in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2000); namely: truck loading and lane loading. Both above mentioned loads were investigated in this study. Figure 3.1 shows a view the abovementioned CHBDC live truck and lane loads namely; CL-W truck loading and the CL-W lane loading. The CL-W truck is an idealized five-axle truck, the number "W " indicates the gross load (625) of the CL-W truck in KN. Wheel and axle loads are shown in terms of W, and are also shown specifically for CL-625 truck. Whereas the CL-W lane loading consists o f CL-W truck loading, with each axle load reduced to 80% of its original value, and superimposed within a uniformly distributed load of 9 KN/m over 3.0 m width. For the purpose of this study, the following different CHBDC truck loading configurations were considered: (1) For studying the shear distribution between the girders, four levels of loading were employed in this study, namely: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 truck. Figure 3.2 shows the configurations of each of these load levels.

52

(2)

For studying the moment and deflection distributions between the girders one level is employed in this study, namely: Level 1 as shown in Figure 3.3, since bridges with 10 m spans were considered in this study as a continuation of W assef s research work on moment distribution. Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4 shown in Figure 3.3 were studied by (Wassef, 2004).

Levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 refer to the different bridge span lengths, 10, 15, 25 and 35 m , respectively. In studying the shear, moment and deflection distributions, the loading on the bridge prototypes was applied in such a way to produce maximum forces and longitudinal stresses.

3.5

Truck Loading Cases

The selection between the two different CHBDC types of live loads (CL-625 truck and CL-625 lane) depends on whichever gives the greatest design values. A sensitivity study was carried out in this regard showed that the CL-625 truck loading is governing the extreme design values for the single girder of 10, 15, 25, and 35 m span lengths. Accordingly, the CL-625 lane loading was not utilized in this study. The CHBDC requires considering three limit states in bridge designs; namely: i. The Ultimate Limit State (ULS), that involve failure, including rupture, overturning, sliding, and other instability, ii. The Serviceability Limit State (SLS), at which the effect of vibration, permanent deformation, and cracking on the usability or condition of the structure are considered,

53

iii.

The Fatigue Limit State (FLS), at which the effect of fatigue on the strength or condition of the structure are considered. Dead load and truck load cases were considered for each of the above three CHBDC

requirements.

Different loading configurations were also considered

in this study

represented by: one-lane, two-lane, three-lane and four-lane bridges. As a result, a total of 48 different load cases assembled in 4 groups were employed on each level of the above mentioned design requirements. Figures 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 show schematic diagrams of the loading cases considered in determining the structural response of the exterior girder, middle girder, and interior girder. It is essential to mention that the exterior girder here refers to the girder which is far away from the centre of curvature in the bridge, whereas the. interior girder is the one which is closest to the centre of the curvature. The middle girder considered herein is any girder between the exterior and interior girders. A brief description might be required here to give an idea on how these load cases were assembled in the above diagrams. Diagrams in Figure 3.5 are taken as an example, the first loading case. Load case (1) in each figure is always for the dead load of the structure. For the exterior girder, two truck loading cases were considered. Load case (2) included a single truck load located in the outer lane far away from the centre of curvature, on which the outer wheel load was located at 0.6 m from the barrier. Load case (3) included two trucks one in each lane with the outer wheel load located at 0.6 m from the barrier for the first truck and at 0.6 m from the outer edge o f the inner lane for the second truck. Load case (4) was intended to provide the maximum load on the middle girder, which is at or very close to the centroid of the bridge cross-section. In this case one truck was considered in each lane and located as shown in Figure 3.5. Load cases (5) and (6) were intended to provide the maximum load in

54

the interior girder. Whereas Load cases (7) and (8) were intended to provide the maximun load in the girders for fatigue design. In this case, CHBDC specifies only one truck loading located at the centre of the actual lane, the width of this actual lane is determined aftei deducting the width of both side shoulders from the total bridge width and dividing the outcome by the number of design lanes. In this study the shoulder width taken to be in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 m.

3.6

Composite Bridge Configurations
320 simply supported straight and curved concrete slab-on-steel I-girder bridge

prototypes were considered for finite-element analysis in this parametric study. Several major parameters were considered as follows:  Span length (L): 10, 15, 25, and 35 m;  Girder spacing (S): 2, 2.5, and 3 m  Number of girders (N): 3, 4, 5, 6, & 7 for 2 m girder spacing; 3, 4, 5, & 6 for 2.5 m girder spacing; 3 ,4 & 5 for 3 m girder spacing;  Span-to-radius of curvature ratio (L/R): 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, & 0.3 for spans L=10 m and L=15 m; 0.0, 0.1, L=35 m. Based on CHBDC code which specifies number of design lanes as a basis for bridge width (see Tables 3.1 & 3.2), some of the above diversity of parameters were determined. Other bridge configurations are listed as below: > The deck slab thickness of was taken as 225 mm, 0.3, & 0.5 for span L=25 m; and 0.0, 0.1, 0.4, & 0.7 for span

55

>

The deck slab width (Wc) was taken equal to the total bridge width minus 1.0 m to consider the parapet thickness of 0.5 m on each side of the bridge,

>

The depth o f the girder webs was taken (1/20) of the centre line span except for spans length =10 m, the depth was taken 0.75 m,

> > >

The girder web thickness was considered equal to 16 mm, The over-hanged slab length was considered equal to half the girder spacing, The bottom and top steel flanges width and thickness were maintained 300 mm, and 20 mm, respectively.

Table 3.1 summarizes the straight bridge configurations considered in this study. Figure 3.8 visualizes the details o f the typical composite deck steel I-girder bridge cross-section used in this study. X-type cross-bracings with top and bottom chords were utilized in this study as shown in Figure 3.8. These bracings were spaced at equal intervals between the support lines and were made o f single steel angles dimensioned (L150xL150x25mm) and o f 0.0075 m^ cross sectional area. The equal intervals spacing between these cross-bracings were based on equation 2.24, which was developed by Davidson et al. (1996) to reduce and limit the warping-to-bending stress ratio. Typical plan of straight and curved girders with the distribution o f the transverse bracings are shown in Figure 3.9.

56

3.7

Research Assumptions
This study was based on the following assumptions;

(1)

The reinforced deck slab had complete composite action with the top steel flange of the girders (fully restrained, 100% shear interaction),

(2) (3) (4) (5)

All the bridges were simply supported, All materials were elastic and homogenous, The effect of road superelevation, and curbs were ignored; Bridges had constant radii of curvature between support lines.

Regarding the first assumption, Wassef, (2004) performed a sensitivity study to verify the full composite action between the concrete deck and top girder flange. He used 35-m span bridge with 7 girders spaced at 2.0 m, the concrete deck connected with the steel top flange by M22 studs. The bridge was first analyzed using the finite-element method for a case representing the M22 studs of 0.5 m spacing as frame elements and for a case representing the M22 studs as shell element with equivalent area. Wassef then verified the results manually using flexural beam theory, he concluded that the shell element revealed better agreement with the manual calculation than the frame element, hence the latter was ignored. Other design values were taken as follows; the modulus of elasticity of concrete material was taken 28 GPa with Poisson's ratio of 0.20, while these design values for steel material were taken; 200 GPa and 0.30, respectively.

57

3.8

Finite-Element Bridges modeling

3.8.1 Geometric Modeling
Finite element modeling is partly an art guided by visualizing physical interactions taking place within the body (Logan, 2002). One can appear to acquire good modeling

techniques through experience and by working with experienced people. To analyze all the above mentioned composite bridges and to determine their structural response, a threedimensional finite-element model was adopted. To facilitate the analysis, the structure was divided into major components as follows: a concrete deck slab, top steel flange, steel web, bottom steel flange, and cross-bracings. In modeling, choosing the proper type of element or elements to match as closely as possible the physical behavior of the problem is sometimes difficult task if not guided by an educated judgment. In general an element yield best results if its shape is compact and regular. Hence, in this study, four-node shell elements with six degree o f freedom at each node were used to model the concrete deck slab, the top and bottom girder flanges, and finally the girder web. Whereas frame elements, pinned at both ends, were used to model the cross-bracings with the top and bottom chords. Based on previous work on finite-element modeling, four vertical shell elements were used in each web, and another four were used horizontally for the deck slabs between the webs, whereas two shell elements were used for the overhanged deck slab, and for the upper and lower steel flanges. Figure 3.10 shows a finite-element discretization of four-girder cross section. Figures 3.11 and 3.12 visualized views from the SAP2000 finite-element models for 6girder curved bridge.

58

3.8.2

Aspect Ratio

:

C-';

In finite-element modeling, the aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the longesi dimension to the shortest dimension of a quadrilateral element. In many cases, as the aspect ratio increases, the inaccuracy of the solution increases (Logan, 2002). Logan presented a graph showing that as the aspect ratio raises above 4, the percentage of error from the exact solution increases greater than 15%. Consequently, in this study, 72 elements in the longitudinal direction were considered for 15, 25, and 35-m bridge span lengths, whereas only 36 elements were considered for the 10-m bridge span length to keep down the aspect ratio in acceptable ranges.

3.8.3 Boundary conditions
Setting proper boundary conditions to suit the nature of the problem and type of structure is sometimes a complicated mission. Experience and previous work are also called herein to choose carefully proper boundary conditions. In modeling the bridge supports in this study, the lower nodes of the web ends were restrained against translation in such way to simulate temperature-free bridge superstructure. In Figure 3.13, the interior support at the right end of the bridge was restrained against movements in all direction. The middle supports and the exterior support at the same right end of the bridge were restrained against the vertical movement and against the movement in y-direction (towards the bridge longitudinal direction). On the other end of the bridge (left end), all the supports were restrained only against vertical movement, except for the interior support which in addition to the vertical restraining, it was restrained in x-direction (towards the bridge transverse

59

direction) and as shown in Figure 3.13. Appendices A and B demonstrate samples o f SA P2000 input files used in this study.

3.9

Calculation of the Shear Distribution Factors
In determining the shear distribution factor (SDF) for curved girder, the maximum

shear forces, (Rstraight)tnick, and (Rstraight)oL, were calculated for straight simply supported beam due to a single CHBDC truck loading and own dead load, respectively, as shown in Appendix C. It is important to mention that the span length for the above straight simply supported beam is taken equal to the centerline length of the curved bridges. And from the finite-element modeling, the maximum shear forces for dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading were determined. Consequently, the shear distribution factors (SDF) were calculated as follows:

3.10 Calculation of the Moment Distribution Factors
In the same manner mentioned above, the moment distribution factors (MDF) for curved girders were determined. The maximum flexural stresses (o
straight) tmck, ( o straight)
du

were calculated for the straight simply supported beam due to CHBDC truck loading and own dead load, respectively. It is important here to determine the effective concrete slab width, Be, in order to calculate the moment of inertia of the idealized girder. CHBDC specifies the following two equations for calculating Be:

Be B 15B

L for -- < 1 5 B

(3.14)

Be

= 1,
B

L for -- >15 B

(3.15)

Where B is the clear spacing between girders = (S - 2bf); bf is the steel flange width; L is the girder span length; and S is the girder spacing (all the units are in meters). The follow ing flexural formula was used to calculate the flexural stress of the idealized girder: (^straight) truck " M 7 (Yb) / It (3.16)

where M t = the mid-span moment for a straight simply supported girder due to a single CHBDC truck loading. yb = the distance from the neutral axis to the bottom flange. It = the moment o f inertia of the composite girder.

62

In likewise manner, the flexure stress of the idealized girder due to dead load was
calculated as in the following flexural stress equation;
(^ s tra ig h t) DL ~ ^ D L (Yb) / (3 -1 7 )

where Mdl = the mid-span moment for a straight simply supported girder due to a single girder dead load. Also the results of the above equations were tabulated in Appendix C and were verified by SAP2000 program. And from the finite-element modeling, the maximum longitudinal moment stresses along the bottom flange for dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading were calculated. Consequently, the moment distribution factors (MDF) were calculated as follows:

3.11 Calculation of the Deflection Distribution Factors
To determine the deflection distribution factor (DDF) for curved girder, the mid-span deflection,
(A stra ig h t)tru c k . (A stra ig h t)D L ,

were calculated for a straight simply supported

64

girder subjected to CHBDC truck loading, and dead loads, respectively. Similar to the above SDF and MDF cases, the span of the straight simply supported girder is taken as the curved length of the bridge centre-line. The deflections values of the idealized girder due to truck loading and dead load, were calculated using SAP2000 software, and then verified by manual calculations. Results of these calculations are presented in Appendix C. And from the finite-element modeling, the mid-span deflection values at the middle of the bottom flange due to dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading were determined. Consequently, the deflection distribution factors (DDF), were calculated from the following relationships;-

3.12 Warping to-bending stress ratio
A s previewed in chapter 2, curved bridges are subjected to lateral bending moments acted at the top and bottom flanges due to curvature as shown in Figure 3.15. This lateral bending moment also called "bi-moment" or "torsional warping moment which induces

warping o f the girder cross-section. This bi-moment will increase the longitudinal flexural

66

stress in flanges, and hence is called "warping stress". To study the effect of this warpin stress and its changes with different bridges parameters and load cases, the ratio betwee warping stress to the average bending stress in the bottom flange is examined in this stud] with the following relationship: WBR = <iw/CTb = (O i-a3)/(cf3 + cyi) where C T i and

CHAPTER IV RESULTS FROM THE PARAMETRIC STUDY
4.1 General
A s mentioned in the previous chapter the finite element "SAP2000" program was chosen to conduct the current research. A parametric study on 256 simply supported straight and curved concrete slab-on-steel I-girder bridge prototypes was conducted to investigate the shear distribution factors. In addition to that; another parametric study conducted on 64 composite bridge prototypes to investigate the moment and deflection distribution factors as a continuation o f W assefs research work (2004). All the above-mentioned bridge prototypes were analyzed to evaluate their structural response against a total of 48 different combinations o f load cases (dead loading as well as the Canadian Highway Bridge Design truck loading, CHBDC truck). This chapter presents the results of the above parametric studies in terms o f ( 1 ) shear distribution among composite girders, (2 ) moment distribution among composite girders, (3) deflection distribution, and (4) warping-to-bending stress ratios in steel flanges. In this study the following major key parameters were considered: (i). (ii). (iii). (iv). (v). Span-to-radius o f curvature ratio (L/R), Number o f girders (N), Girder spacing (S), Bridge span length (L), Number o f cross-bracing intervals between support lines.

68

As mentioned in Chapter (I) and based on the results from this research, the objectives this parametric study were to: 1- Scrutinize the influence of the major parameters on the structural response composite I-girder bridges. 2- Generate a database for the maximum longitudinal bending stresses in bottc flanges and shear forces at support locations. 3- Developing new simplified formulas for Shear and Moments Distribution Factors f curved composite concrete steel I-girder bridges that help the design engineers and code authors.

4.2

Shear Distribution in Simply Supported Composite Curved Bridge;

4.2.1 Effect of Curvature
Curvature is considered one of the major factors that influencing the curved bridge behavic and controlling the stress distribution among their girders. The results of current parametri study conformed this fact. Figures 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 show the variation in the sheÂ£ distribution factors with increase in span-to-radius of curvature ratio (L/R), for the exteric girder of one-lane bridge comprised of 3 girders spaced at 2 m under dead load, fully loade( lanes with truck loading, and fatigue loading, respectively. It can be observed that as L/I ratio increases, the shear distribution factor for the exterior girder increases, for example ii Figure 4.2, as the L/R ratio increased from 0.1 to 0.4 for the 35 m bridge span length, the

69

shear distribution factor increased from 1.87 to 2.43. Also, the rate of increase of the shear distribution factor is observed to generally increases with the increase in span length. The above trend however, is considerably changed in the behavior of the shear distribution factors o f the middle girder as shown in Figures 4.4, 4.5, and
4 .6

due to dead load, fully

loaded lanes, and fatigue loading, respectively. Except for the dead load case, it can be observed that the shear distribution factor slightly decreases as the L/R ratio increases for bridge span lengths 10 and 15 m, whereas it follows the same pattern of the exterior girder for the span lengths 25 and 35 m. On the other hand, an inverse relation between the shear distribution factors and the curvature become more dominant in the behavior of the interior girder (the closest to the central of curvature) as shown in Figures 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9 for dead load, fully loaded lanes, and fatigue loading, respectively. This is due to the fact that the torsion stresses induced from the curvature tend to increase longitudinal bending stresses in the exterior girders and to reduce them in the interior girders. A two-lane bridge, with 4 girders spaced at 2.5 m was also investigated to broaden the findings with respect to the effect o f curvature. The effects of the span-to-radius ratio (L/R) on the shear distribution factor found to be similar to those of the above-mentioned one-lane, 3 girder system. This can be observed in Figures 4.10, to 4.16, for different load cases of the exterior and interior girders. CHBDC considers curved bridge to be treated as a straight one if / (b.R) is not

greater than 1, where L is the curved span length, b is half of the bridge width, and R is the radius o f curvature. Considering the above CHBDC limitations in this study, the resulting L/R ratio for the bridges considered in this study are:

70

(1) For 10-m bridge span; L/R ratio equal 0.3 and 0.7 for 6 -m and 14-m bridge wic respectively; (2) For 15-m bridge span; L/R ratio equal 0.2 and 0.47 for 6 -m and 14-m bridge wid respectively; (3) For 25-m bridge span; L/R ratio equal 0.12 and 0.28 for 6 -m and 14-m bridge wid respectively; (4) For 35-m bridge span; L/R ratio equal 0.09 and 0.2 for 6 -m and 14-m bridge widl respectively; When the above limiting values are applied to Figures 4.1 to 4.6 for the exterior and midd girders of a one-lane bridge and Figures 4.10 to 4.13 for the exterior girders of a two-lai bridge, it can be clearly seen that CHBDC significantly underestimates the shear distributic factors for the exterior and middle girders of the curved system bridges.

4.2.2 Effect of Number of Girders
A bridge of 35-m span with 2.0 m girder spacing was selected to investigate the effect of th number of girders on the shear distribution factors. Results on the shear distribution factor c the exterior girder due to dead load revealed a reduction in the shear distribution factor witl the increase in number of girders for span-to-radius of curvature ratio greater than 0 . 1 , a shown in Figure 4.17. However, different trend is noticed in Figures 4.18 and 4.19 for fulb loaded lanes and partially loaded lanes, respectively. It can be observed that the shea distribution factor decreases (from 2.43 to 1.60 as shown in Figure 4.18 for L/R=0.4) as number of girders increase to 4, then the above relation is reversed (from 1.6 to 1.92) foi number of girders more than 4. Figure 4.20 showed another trend in the relation between the

71

shear distribution factors and the number o f girders for fatigue loading case, the shear distribution factors fluctuate with increase in number of girders. Figures 4.21, 4.22, and 4.23 represent the above-mentioned relationship for the middle girder under dead load, fully loaded lanes, and fatigue loading respectively. While Figures 4.24, 4.25, 4.26, and 4.27 show the change o f the shear distribution factor for the interior girder under dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes and fatigue loading, respectively, with increase in number o f girders. In general, the shear distribution factors for the middle and the interior girders increase with the increase in number of girders except for the middle girder dead loading case where insignificant effect is witnessed.

4.2.3

E ffect o f G irders Spacing

Figures 4.28, 4.29, 4.30, and 4.31 show the relationship between the shear distribution factors and girder spacing for the exterior girder of two-lane, 25-m span bridge having 4 girders under dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading, respectively. Generally, it can be noticed that the shear distribution factor increases as the girder spacing increase ( from Figure 4.29, as the girder spacing increased from 2 to 3m, the shear distribution factor increased by 23.5% for L/R = 0.3) except for the deal load case, where the above relation is slightly reversed. Similar behavior is observed in case o f the middle girder (Figures 4.32, and 4.33) for fully loaded lanes and fatigue loading, respectively, and for the interior girder (Figures 4.34, and 4.35) for fully loaded lanes, and partially loaded lanes, respectively.

72

4.2.4 Effect of Span Length

/-K

Figures 4.36 and 4.37 show the effect of span length on the shear distribution factors for t exterior girder of one-lane, 3-girder bridge due to dead load and fully loaded lan( respectively. In case of dead load, insignificant effect of the span length on the she distribution factors is observed except for the span-to-radius ratio (L/R) of 0.3, at tho values the shear distribution factor increases as the span length increases. However, tl shear distribution factor of the exterior girder under fully loaded lanes increases as the spt length increases (from Figure 4.37, as the span length increased from 10 to 25 m, the she; distribution factor increased from 1.73 to 2.10 for L/R = 0.3) . It is also observed that th rate of increase in the shear distribution factor increases with increase in the L/R ratio. Th effect of the span length on the shear distribution factor for the middle girder is observed t be insignificant for spans greater than 25 m, as shown in Figure 4.38. However, the shea distribution factor for the interior girder decreases with the increase of the span length ii curved bridges as shown in Figures 4.39 and 4.40 for dead load and fully loaded lanes respectively. Once again the rate of the slop decrease of the shear distribution factor line i: increases as the L/R ratio increase.

4.2.5 Effect of Loading Conditions
When analyzing bridge prototypes to determine the shear distribution factors, many loading cases for CHBDC truck loading were considered. These loading cases can be divided into two main groups; namely: bridges with fully loaded lanes and bridges with partially loaded lanes. To investigate the effect of these two loading cases on the shear distribution factors. Figures 4.41, 4.42, 4.43, and 4.44 represent the relationship between the shear distribution

73

factors o f the exterior girder o f 10, 15, 25, and 35-m span bridges, respectively, due to fully loaded lanes and partially loaded lanes. The horizontal axis represents the shear distribution ' factor due to fully loaded lanes while the vertical axis represents the corresponding shear distribution factor for the case o f partially loaded lanes. These plotted relationships are for all bridges regardless on number of girders, girders spacing, and number o f lanes. It can be observed that shear distribution factors obtained for partially loaded lanes are usually higher than those for fully laded lanes, especially for shorter spans. Figures 4.45, 4.46, 4.47, and 4.48 show similar relationship but for the interior girder. Results revealed that in some exterior and middle girders cases of 10-m span bridges with 4 design lanes; partially loaded lanes with two trucks only produced higher shear distribution factors than the case o f partially loaded lanes with 3 trucks and fully loaded lanes as shown in Table 4.1.

4.2.6

Effect of Number of Lanes

Figures 4.49, and 4.50 illustrate the relationship between the shear distribution factors and the number o f lanes for the exterior girder of a bridge with 2 m girder spacing and 35-m span length due to fully loaded lanes and partially loaded lanes respectively. It can be noticed that as the number o f lanes increases, the shear distribution factors decreases. Example o f that can be observed in Figure 4.49, as the number of lanes increased from 1 to 3 lanes, the shear distribution factor decreased from 3.07 to 1.6 for L/R=0.7. Middle and interior girders demonstrate different relationship between the shear distribution factors and the number o f lanes for the same bridge configuration as shown in Figures 4.51 to 4,54.

74

4.2.7 Effect of Number of Bracing Intervals
It was mentioned in chapter (II) that the number of bracing intervals used in this study w based on equation 2.24. To verify the reliability of this equation and to study the effect number of bracing interval on the shear distribution factor, a sensitivity study was conduch on a two-lane Bridge of 35-m span length, with 4 girders, and span-to-radius of curvatu ratio (L/R) of 0.7, against various numbers of bracing intervals; (2, 3, 4,
6, 8,

9, and 12

Figure 4.55 shows the effect of the number of bracing intervals on the shear distributic factor of the exterior girder when the bridge is subjected to dead load, fully loaded lane: and partially loaded lanes. It can be observed that the shear distribution factor decreases wit increase in number of cross-bracing intervals up to 4. No further reduction is observe beyond 4 bracing intervals. This means that the outcome of equation 2.24 is too conservativ in case of shear distribution, while it is required for limiting the warping-to-bending stresse ratios.

4.2.8 Effect of Load Cases
As mentioned earlier in chapter III, this research investigated different patterns of load cases shown in Figures 3.4 to 3.7 to produce the maximum shear distribution factors. Figures 4.56, 4.57, and 4.58 show the shear distribution factor obtained from each loading case for the exterior, middle, and interior girders, respectively, of two-lanes, 25-m span, bridge with
4

girders spaced at 2 m. As expected, in the exterior girder case number 2 governs the shear distribution factor value for L/R ratio of 0.1 and below, and case number 3 governs it for the L/R ratio greater than 0.1, whereas cases number 4 and 5 govern the shear distribution factor

75

for the middle and interior girders, respectively. It's important to mentions that in the exterior girders (when L/R <= 0.1) and interior girders, the governing cases are those for the partially loaded lanes (one truck loaded in a two-lane bridge). Figures 4.59, 4.60, and 4.61 show SD F obtained from each load case for 3-lane, 25-m span bridge, with 7 girders spaced at 2 m for the exterior, middle, and interior girders, respectively. It can be observed that for exterior and interior girders, loading cases 3 and 10, respectively, (two trucks loaded in 3lane bridge) provide the design values, whereas for middle girder, cases
3

and

5

(two trucks

loaded in 3-lane bridge) govern the design shear distribution factor. To show the diversity in the outcome from loading cases, results from a 4-lane bridge with 35 m span are shown in Figures 4.62, 4.63, and 4.64. Two cases (4 & 9), (4 & 9), and (10 & 15) show thp peak SDF values for the exterior, middle, and interior girders, respectively. All these loading cases represent partially loaded lanes of (3 trucks loaded in 4-lane bridge) except case 15 o f 2 trucks loaded in 4-lane bridge.

4.3

Shear Distribution Between Bridge Girders

Figures 4.65, and 4.66 investigate the distribution of the shear between the girders o f the com posite bridges to understand how the loads are distributed between the girders with increase in L/R ratios. A two-lane bridge of 35-m span with 5 girders spaced at 2.0 m, was analyzed under dead loading and fully loaded lanes, respectively. It was observed that the shear distribution factor increases as the span-to-radius ratio increases for the girders located between bridge centre-line and the exterior girder. However it decreases as the span-toradius ratio increase for the rest of the girders between the inner (interior) girder and the centre-line o f the bridge. This is attributed to the high torsional moments associated with

76

curvature. Similar trend was observed in case of a 4-lane bridge with girders, spaced at 2 m as shown in Figures 4.67 and 4.68.

4.4

SDF Effect with Type of the Support

A two-lane bridge of 35-m span and 5 girders spaced at 2 m was chosen to investigat whether there is a change in shear distribution at the roller and hinge support line mentioned in the finite-element modeling of support conditions in chapter HI. Figures 4.6! and 4.70 show the values of shear distribution factor along the hinged support line unde dead load and fully loaded lanes, respectively, while Figures 4.71 and 4.72 show simila results along the roller support line under the same above load configuration. No significan effect was witnessed; this means that calculation of shear forces or reactions along the rollei or the hinge support lines does not effect the design value.

4.5

Shear Distribution Equations Comparison between CHBDC and those obtained from Current Finite Element Analysis

The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code specifies equations for calculating the shear distribution factors for straight slab-on-girder bridges, including reinforced concrete girders, pre-stressed concrete girders and composite concrete-steel girders. CHBDC applied some conditions to use these equations, one of them related to the type of girders' lateral supports, identified as diaphragms which are required to be provided at support lines and at equal intervals between the supports to enhance girders stability. There are different types of diaphragms that can be used to satisfy CHBDC requirements. As mentioned in chapter (III), this study utilized, cross-bracing type diaphragm with top and bottom chords, which is

77

considered as lateral supports to the steel girders. This study conducted a comparison between the shear distribution factors obtained from the empirical expressions in the CHBDC for straight slab-on-girder bridges and the results acquired from the current study using the finite-element analysis for the same types o f bridges. Figures 4.73 and 4.74 show the correlation between the shear distribution factors of the exterior girder due to truck loading and fatigue loading, respectively as obtained from CHBDC equations and from the current study. In a similar manner, Figures 4.75 and 4.76 show similar correlation for the middle girder under the same loading configurations. It can be concluded that the CHBDC equations always overestimate the structural response except of very few cases for truck loading as shown in Figure 4.75. This may be attributed to the presence o f cross-bracings between support lines that was ignored when developing CHBDC equations.

4.6

Moment and Deflection Distributions in Simply Supported Composite Curved Bridges

4.6.1

Effect of Curvature

Once again the results o f current parametric study revealed that the curvature of bridges is considered as a major parameter which significantly effects the distribution of bending moments among girders. Figures 4.77, 4.78, 4.79, and 4.80 present the moment distribution factor for the exterior girder o f a two-lane bridge with 7 girders equally spaced at 2 m, under dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading, respectively. It can be observed that the moment distribution factor increases as the span-to-radius o f curvature ratio (L/R) increases. Similar trend was observed in case of the middle girder, as shown in Figures 4.81, 4.82, and 4.83 for dead load, fully loaded lanes, and fatigue loading.

78

respectively. Figures 4.84, 4.85, 4.86, and 4.87 show the effect of curvature ratio on tl moment distribution factor for the interior girder due to dead load, fully loaded lane partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading, respectively. It can be observed for the case < fully loaded lanes that the moment distribution factor follows the above-mentione dominant behavior for the exterior girder, (i.e. increase in moment distribution factor as th curvature ratio increase). However, in case of dead loading, the moment distribution factc increases as the curvature ratio increases till reaching a certain value of L/R (0.2), beyon which the moment distribution factor starts to decrease as shown in Figure 4.84. SimiL behavior but with less effect is witnessed in case of fatigue load as shown in Figure 4.81 The case of partially loaded lanes shown in Figure 4.86, shows insignificant effect of L/I ratio on the MDF. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that the increase in L/R rath and the decrease in the span length of the interior girder. So, at low L/R values the increast of curvature dominates the decrease in span length, but when the L/R increases the decreast in span length become dominant. Going back to clause 4.2.1 to in the CHBDC for a curvec bridge to be treated as a straight one, results in Figures 4.77 to 4.87 revealed that CHBDC is significantly underestimate the moment distribution factors in curved bridges that meet the requirement of L" / (b.R) being less than 1. The effect of curvature ratio on deflection factors was also studied parallel to the MDF study and similar trend was observed as shown in Figures 4.111 to 4.121.

4.6.2 Effect of Number of Girders
Figures 4.88, 4.89, 4,90, and 4.91 show the effect of number of longitudinal girders on the moment distribution factor for the exterior girder of a two-lane,

girder spacing under dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading respectively. Although insignificant effect is observed between the number of girders and moment distribution factor for the dead load case as shown in Figure 4.88, significant increase in the moment distribution factor was found with increase in number o f girders for fully loaded and partially loaded lane cases as shown in Figures 4.89, and 4.90 respectively. Fatigue load case revealed another pattern as shown in Figure 4.91; follow ing a pattern other than a straight line. For the middle girder, the effect of number o f girders on the moment distribution factor revealed that the moment distribution factor increases as the number o f girder increases except for the dead load case, where insignificant behavior is found as shown in Figures 4.92 to 4.95. Figures 4.96 to 4.99 show the moment distribution factor o f the interior girder under dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading, respectively, with the increase in number of girders. A trend similar to that in case o f the exterior girder is observed. The effect of number of girders on the deflection distribution factor was also investigated in parallel to the study on moment distribution factor. A similar trend was observed as shown in Figures 4.122 to 4.131.

4.6.3

Effect of Girders Spacing

Figures 4.100 to 4.103 for two-lane, 10-m span, bridge with 4 girders show the effect of the girders spacing on moment distribution factor it can be observed that, the moment distribution factor increases as the girder spacing increases except for the dead load case when insignificant relationship was found. Similar trend is observed in case o f the middle and interior girders as shown in Figures 4.104 to 4.107. Similar behavior was observed in case o f the deflection distribution factors as shown in Figures 4.132 to 4.140.

80

4.6.4 Effect of Loading Conditions
As examined in the case of the shear distribution factor study, it is important to examine tf effect of number of loaded lanes on the moment distribution factor to establish the critic cases that produce extreme values of moment distribution factors. Accordingly, two loadir cases were considered; fully loaded lanes with truck loading and partially loaded lanes wil truck loading. Figures 4.108, 4.109, and 4.110 show the relationship between result obtained from the case of fully loaded lanes and the case that provides the maximui moment distribution factor of all the partially loaded cases for the exterior, middle, an interior girders, respectively. It is worthwhile to reiterate that these plotted values are for a bridges of
1 0 -m

spans regardless of number of lanes, or number of girders or girder

spacing. It can be infer from the above Figures that sometimes even though the partial! loaded lanes are almost half of the live load of the fully loaded lanes, still they can provid extreme design values. However, the results from the fully loaded lanes generally dominÃ¢t the design value when compared to the partially loading. Similar trend was observed for thi deflection distribution factors as shown in Figures 4.141 to 4.143.

Warping Stress Distribution in Simply Supported Curved Bridges

To study the effect of the warping stress distribution in simply supported curved bridge, 10 m span bridge was selected. As mentioned earlier in chapter III, in order to investigate the change in warping stresses with the changes in bridge geometry and loading conditions, the ratio of the warping stress-to-the-average bending stress in the bottom flanges (WBR as calculated in equation 3.42) was calculated in this study. The AASHTO Guide specification

81

for Horizontally Curved Bridges (Guide, 2003) acknowledged a limitation value for the warping-to-bending stress ratio (WBR) of 0.5 to ensure the stability of the structure. In this parametric study, the values for WBR were calculated for the exterior, middle, and interior girders due to different load cases. Figures 4.144, 4.145, 4.146, and 4.147 illustrate the WBR values for the exterior girder o f all the curved bridges o f
1 0 -m

span considered in this study in ascending order, due to dead

load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading, respectively. The negative values observed in these figures refer to the orientation o f the lateral stresses at the bottom flange which is not affecting the absolute value of the warping-to-bending stress ratio. It can be inferred from the above figures that the WBR increases with the increase o f the span-to-radius o f curvature (L/R) ratio. Another important remark is that the extreme values o f W BR shown in the above all figures did not exceed 0.2 which is considered com plying with the requirements of AASHTO Guide 2003. Figures 4.148, 4.149, 4.150, and 4.151 illustrate the warping-to-bending stress ratio for the middle girder of all the curved bridges considered in this study in ascending order, due to dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading respectively. Similar pattern of WBR to that of the exterior girder was observed; however there was slight increase in the upper limit of the W BR values for the middle girder as compared to those of the exterior girder. Nevertheless in all cases the W BR values did not exceed 0.25 which is still below the AASHTO requirements. The warping-to-bending stress ratio in the interior girder followed the same trend to that o f the exterior and the middle girders. Figures 4.152, 4,153, 4.154, and 4.155 illustrate the warping-to-bending stress ratio for the interior girder of all the curved bridges considered in this study in ascending order, due to dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially

82

loaded lanes, and fatigue loading, respectively. There was slight increase in the upper lim of the WBR values in the interior girder as compared to those of the middle girder (0.4 < shown in Figure 4.152), which still below the AASHTO limits.

Comparison Between CHBDC Moment Distribution Equations and those obtained from Current Finite Element Analysis

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC specifies empirical equations for the moment distribution factors in case of straight bridges including different types of bridges supported laterally by diaphragms at the support lines. Ii order to study the correlation between the CHBDC empirical equations and the results fron this study, the outcome from this research and the corresponding values obtained fron CHBDC equations were drawn against each other in graphical format. The produced graph: were for the exterior and middle girders due to truck loading and fatigue loading respectively, as shown in Figures 4.156, 4.157, 4.158, and 4.159. It was observed that th( CHBDC moment distribution equations always overestimate the structural response of the studied bridges except for few cases for the exterior girders due to fatigue loading. In ordei to investigate the correlation between the moment distribution factors and the deflection distribution factors, the results from the finite-element analysis for moment distribution factors and deflection distribution factors were plotted against each other in Figures 4.160, 4.161, 4.162, and 4.163 for the exterior girder under truck loading and fatigue loading and for the middle girders under the same type of loading, respectively. For straight bridges, it can be observed that the moment distribution factor correlates very well with the deflection distribution factor, however in curved bridges the deflection distribution factors are always

83

bigger than the corresponding moment distribution factors. As a result, the deflection distribution factors for curved bridges should not be taken as the moment distribution factors and new deflection distribution factors should be developed for curved bridges in addition to the moment distribution factors.

CHAPTER V
SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
5.1 Summary
This study investigated the effect of the following parameters on the lateral load distribution factors for straight and horizontally curved composite concrete-steel I-girder bridges using the finite-element analysis:  Span length (L): 10, 15, 25, and 35 m;  Girder spacing (S): 2, 2.5, and 3 m;  Number o f girders (N): 3, 4, 5, 6 , & 7 for 2 m girder spacing; 3, 4, 5, & 6 for 2.5 m girder spacing; 3, 4 & 5 for 3 m girder spacing;  Span-to-radius of curvature ratio, (L/R): 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, & 0.3 for spans L=10 m and L=15 m; 0.0, 0.1, L=35 m;  Loading conditions: fully loaded lanes and partially loaded lanes;  Cross-bracing intervals, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12;  Number o f lanes: 1, 2, 3, and 4 0.3, & 0.5 for span L=25 m; and 0.0, 0.1, 0.4, & 0.7 for span

5.2

Conclusions
Based on the results from the parametric study, the following conclusions are drawn:

88

(1) Curvature is the most significant factor which is playing an important role determining the lateral load distribution factors. The increase in the span-to-radius curvature ratio (L/R) leads to significant increase in the shear distribution factors f the exterior and middle girders and a decrease in the SDF for the interior girde whereas the increase in the curvature ratio results in significant increase in tl moment distribution factors and deflection distribution factors for all the girders. Tl same conclusion can be drawn for the effect of curvature on warping-to-bendin stress ratio. (2) The number of girders and girders spacing are other important parameters that affei the lateral load distribution factors. In general, the increase in the number of girder: as well as in girders spacing results in an increase in the shear distribution facto: moment distribution factor, and deflection distribution factor. (3) In general, the span length slightly affects the shear distribution factors; howevei span length shows significant effect when the L/R ratio exceeds 0.10. (4) This study revealed that the partially loaded lane cases almost govern the extremi values of the shear distribution factors. However, the moment distribution factor: and deflection distribution factors showed rebellious results compared to those of th< shear distribution factors, when the fully loaded lane cases govern the design. (5) The number of cross-bracing intervals over 3, proved to have less significant effect on the shear distribution factors. (6 ) In general, this study revealed that CHBDC overestimates the structural response ol the straight composite I-girder bridges.

89

(7) This study showed that CHBDC significantly underestimates the structural response o f curved bridges by treating them as straight bridges when than 1. This provision should be investigated. ( 8 ) Sets o f empirical expressions for shear, moment and deflection distribution factors were developed for both straight and curved bridges, yielding more economical bridge construction. / (b.R) is not greater

5.3

Recommendations for Future Research

The author recommends future research in the following areas: 1- More experimental verification studies to gather field response data for on site bridges having the same configuration and geometry of the bridges considered in this study to evaluate the compatibility of the results. 2- The study o f load distribution in continuous curved composite I-girder bridges. 3- Study o f the effect of dynamic loads on curved composite I-girder bridges. 4- The study o f the non-linear behavior on the structural response of curved composite I-girder bridges and evaluates the critical stresses at failure. 5- Investigation on the safe limiting curvature ratio to treat a curved bridge as a straight one.
6-

Investigate the effect o f curvature on bracing axial forces.
