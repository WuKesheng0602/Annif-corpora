Load Distribution in Adjacent Precast "Deck Free" Concrete Box-Girder Bridges By Waqar Khan. Ryerson University - Civil Engineering Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2010

ABSTRACT
Bridges built with adjacent precast, prestressed concrete box-girders are a popular and economical solution for short-span bridges because they can be constructed rapidly. The top flanges of the precast box girders form the bridge deck surface. A shear key is introduced between the adjacent boxes over the depth of the top flange (i.e. 225 mm thick as the thickness of the box's top flange). Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, CHBDC specifies empirical equations for the moment and shear distribution factors for selected bridge configurations but not for adjacent precast concrete box-girder bridge type. In this study, a parametric study was conducted, using the 3D finite-element modeling, and a set of simplified equations for the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors for the studied bridge configuration was developed.

4.1 GENERAL ................................................................................................................................................ 46  The following sections present the results from the parametric study as compared to the available equations in CHBDC for voided slab bridges, slab-on-girder bridges and multiple-spine composite steel box girder bridges. The chapter will conclude with the developed equations and their limitation of use along with correlation between the FEA values and those from the developed equation to stand on the latter's level of accuracy.46  4.2 Effect of Number of Girders 47  4.2.1 MOMENT DISTRIBUTION FACTOR ...................................................................................................... 48  4.2.2 SHEAR DISTRIBUTION FACTOR........................................................................................................... 48  FIGURES 4.25 TO 4.48 SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF GIRDERS AND THE SHEAR DISTRIBUTION FACTOR, FV, OF SELECTED BRIDGE GEOMETRIES. THE RESULTS ARE INTRODUCED FOR BOTH ULS AND SLS DESIGN AND FLS DESIGN. TO EXPLAIN THE TREND, FIGURE 4.25 IS TAKEN HERE AS AN EXAMPLE. THIS
FIGURE SHOWS THE CHANGE IN SHEAR DISTRIBUTION FACTOR WITH INCREASE IN NUMBER OF GIRDERS FOR A TWO-LANE, 16-M SPAN, BRIDGE MADE OF B700 BOX GIRDERS. IT CAN BE OBSERVED THAT FV CHANGES FROM 1.99 TO 2.74 WHEN INCREASING NUMBER OF GIRDERS FROM 6 TO 8 FOR FLS DESIGN. THIS CONSIDERS AN INCREASE OF 37.7%. ON THE OTHER HAND, FV INCREASES FROM 1.29 TO 1.68 WHEN INCREASING NUMBER OF GIRDERS FROM 6 TO 8 (AN INCREASE OF 30%) FOR ULS AND SLS DESIGNS. ...................................................... 48  4.2.3 DEFLECTION DISTRIBUTION FACTOR ................................................................................................ 49  4. 3 EFFECT OF SPAN LENGTH ..................................................................................................................... 49  4.3.1 MOMENT DISTRIBUTION FACTOR ...................................................................................................... 50  4.3.3 DEFLECTION DISTRIBUTION FACTOR ................................................................................................ 51  4.4 EFFECT OF NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES ................................................................................................ 51  4.4.1 MOMENT DISTRIBUTION FACTOR ...................................................................................................... 51  FIGURES 4.88 TO 4.95 PRESENT THE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES ON THE MOMENT DISTRIBUTION FACTOR OF SELECTED BRIDGES. ONE MAY OBSERVE THE GENERAL TREND OF INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF CHANGE IN NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES ON FM VALUES AT THE ULS DESIGN AS COMPARED TO THOSE AT FLS DESIGN. AS AN EXAMPLE, FIGURE 4.95 DEPICTS THE CHANGE IN FM VALUES WITH INCREASE IN NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES FOR A 32-M SPAN BRIDGE MADE OF B1000 BOX GIRDERS. IT CAN BE OBSERVED THAT FM CHANGES FROM 1.09 TO 1.45 (AN INCREASE OF 33%) WHEN CHANGING THE NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES FROM 2 TO 4. WHILE THE INCREASE IN FM FOR ULS WAS 3.9% (I.E. CHANGE FROM 1.02 TO 1.06) WHEN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES FROM 2 TO 4. ............................................................................. 51  4.4.2 SHEAR DISTRIBUTION FACTOR........................................................................................................... 52  SIMILAR TREND FOR SHEAR DISTRIBUTION FACTORS AND THE MOMENT DISTRIBUTION FACTOR WHEN STUDYING THE EFFECT ON NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES AS DEPICTED IN FIGS. 4.96 TO 4.103. AS AN EXAMPLE, FIGURE 4.103 DEPICTS THE CHANGE IN FV VALUES WITH INCREASE IN NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES FOR A 32-M SPAN BRIDGE MADE OF B1000 BOX GIRDERS. IT CAN BE OBSERVED THAT FV CHANGES FROM 2.10 TO 3.77 (AN INCREASE OF 79.5%) WHEN CHANGING THE NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES FROM 2 TO 4. WHILE THE INCREASE IN FV FOR ULS WAS 9.2% (I.E. CHANGE FROM 1.53 TO 1.67) WHEN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF DESIGN LANES FROM 2 TO 4. .................................................................................................................................................. 52  4.4.3 DEFLECTION DISTRIBUTION FACTOR ................................................................................................ 52  4. 5 EFFECT OF GIRDER SPACING ................................................................................................................ 52 

In this study the spacing between the girders is constant 15mm, box girders are placed adjacent to each other. The width of box girder is 1.22m and centre to centre spacing between the girders is considered

viii 

1.235m for all the bridge models. Due to the constant box girder spacing in all the bridges, the effect of girder spacing is not applicable in this study. 52  4.6 EFFECT OF LOAD CASES ........................................................................................................................ 53  4.7  COMPARISON BETWEEN THE RESULTS FROM THE STUDIED DECK-FREE PRECAST BOX-GIRDER BRIDGES AND CHBDC SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR I-GIRDER, VOIDED SLAB AND MULTI SPINE BRIDGES. 53  4.8 DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LOAD DISTRIBUTION FACTOR EQUATIONS .................................................. 54  In this study, it was decided to have two sets of empirical equations for moment and deflection for SLS designs since it have been proved from the data generated from the parametric study that the deflection distribution factors were generally less than those for moment distribution factors. This conclusion was observed in Figs. 4.127 to 4.135 for different bridge configurations. In case of shear shear distribution factor the following equation was used: 55  CHAPTER V CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 57  57

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
1.1 General
In densely populated cities, elevated freeways and multi-level interchange structures are necessary. Nowadays, precast bridges have become an important component in highway bridges, especially where construction time and staging restrictions are often encountered. Precast prestressed bridges allow for rapid construction, less disturbance to the traffic flow and significant improvement in the quality and the durability of the structure with less environmental effect. Precast prestressed concrete bridges have become increasingly popular. Approximately two-third of the bridges, with spans between 18 m and 36 m, are constructed using prestressed girders.

Bridges built with adjacent precast, prestressed concrete box-girders are a popular and economical solution for short-span bridges because they can be constructed rapidly and most deck forming is eliminated. The box girders are generally connected by partial-depth or fulldepth keyways between each of the boxes, incorporating grouts. Transverse ties, grouted or un-grouted, vary in the form of (i) limited number of reinforcing steel bars with ends embedded in full-depth reinforced concrete edge beams, (ii) a limited number of nontensioned threaded rods anchored to the out webs of the edge boxes, or (iii) few highstrength tendons post-tensioned in multiple stages. A non-composite concrete topping or a composite structural slab is added. Such bridges have been in service for many years and have generally performed well. A recurring problem, however, is cracking in the

1 

longitudinal grouted joints between adjacent box girders, resulting in reflective cracks forming in the wearing surface. This in turn may lead to leakage which allows chlorideladen water to saturate the sides and bottom of the beams, eventually causing corrosion of the non-prestressing reinforcement, prestressing strand, and transverse ties. In severe cases, complete cracking of joints and loss of load transfer occur. To improve long-term durability and reduce long-term maintenance, precast "deck free" adjacent box girders can be used in such a way the top flanges of the precast box girders form the final bridge deck surface. In this system, the precast box girders with thick top flanges are cast in a controlled environment at the fabrication facility and then shipped to the bridge site. Box girders are then placed beside each other over the abutment and piers with 15 mm gaps. This system requires a closure strip to be poured on site between the precast box girders to make it continuous for live load distribution. A shear key is introduced between the adjacent boxes over the depth of the top flange (i.e. 225 mm thick as the thickness of the box's top flange). Lateral bending strength of the closure strip is maintained using U bars projecting from each box's top flange and embedded in a 200 mm width joint. Such durable system has been implemented by Ontario Ministry of Transportation in Ontario bridges since 2006. Figure 1.1 shows cross-section of Sucker Creek Bridge, County Road 41, built in Ontario in 2006 with deck-free adjacent precast box beams. While Figure 1.2 shows view of deck-free precast box beams used in this bridge before fiiling the closure strips with concrete grout. Figure 1.3 shows view of the deck-free precast box beam used in Suneshine Creek Bridge Hwy 11/17 built in Ontario in Summer 2007. Joint details between adjacent precast box beams used in this bridge is shown in Fig. 1.4.

1.2 The Problem
The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2006) specifies empirical equations for the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors for selected bridge configurations, including slab-on-girders, multiples-spine bridges, cellular or voided slab bridge and solid slab bridges (Fig. 1.5). However, a simplified method of analysis of adjacent precast concrete box-girder bridge is as yet unavailable. Despite the general availability of computers and computer software programs for the bridge analysis, bridge designers strongly prefer simplified methods of analysis to reduce the time spent in the design that would be reflected in a considerable reduction in design cost. In addition, most engineers are not familiar with the finite-element modeling and are reluctant to use this technique, especially in the preliminary designs because of its time consuming in terms of modeling assumptions and verifications and results interpretation. In this study, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the applicability of the simplified analysis method specified in CHBDC for multiple-spine or voided slab bridge configuration on adjacent precast box beams with longitudinal joints that can transfer both bending and shear between each adjacent box girders. In this study, the 3D finite element modelling, using SAP2000 software (Computers and Structures, 2009) was conducted on wide range of adjacent box girders to obtain their moment and shear distribution factors when subjected to CHBDC truck loading conditions. Then, the obtained results were correlated with those available in CHDBC for slab-on-girder bridges, voided slab bridges and multiple-spine bridges. Correlation between the obtained FEA results and CHBDC equations were conducted.

1.3 Objectives
The objectives of this study are: 1. Conduct a parametric study, using the three-dimensional finite-element modeling, on selected deck-free box girder bridge prototypes, to find out the maximum bottom flange flexural stresses, support reaction forces and deflection to provide database for the evaluation of their moment, shear and deflection distribution factors. 2. Develop simplified formulas for shear, moment, and deflection distribution factors for precast box girder bridges with joints between their top flanges.

1.4 Scope
The scope of this study includes the following: 1. A literature review of previous research, textbooks, and design codes of practice related to the study. Conduct a practical-design-oriented study to investigate the key parameters affecting the load distribution among girders. The range of studied parameters include: (i) span of the bridge; (ii) total width of bridge (as a function of number of girders); (iii) number of design lanes; and (vi) truck loading conditions. The parametric study was performed using the commercially-available Finite-Element Software "SAP2000" on 192 box girder bridges subjected to CHBDC truck loading, leading to more than 2000 loading cases. 2. Preparation of database that can be correlated with the available CHBDC simplified method of analysis. 3. Developing shear, moment, and deflection distribution factor formulas for the studied bridge configuration.

CHAPTER II LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Concept of Lateral Load Distribution Factor
In the analysis and designing of bridge, the calculation of structural response of a bridge to live loads is a complicated and lengthy task. The design values for bending moment, shear or deflection force for box girders depend on the location and the number of moving trucks on the bridge, boundary conditions and the cross section properties of bridge components. These values vary with the change in girder span, width of bridge, number of girders and load cases. In order to calculate the live load carried by each girder in case of a straight bridge, lateral load distribution factor is a key element and important in analyzing existing bridges and designing new ones. To simplify the design process, North American bridge codes, such as CAN/CSA-S6-06 (CHBDC, 2006), AASHTO-LRFD Bridge Design Specification (AASHTO, 2004), Load and Resistance Factor Design Specifications (AASHTO, 2007, 2004 and 2000), and AASHTO Standard Specifications (AASHTO, 1996), treat the longitudinal and transverse effects of wheel loads as uncoupled phenomena. Based on these codes, to obtain the design moment, deflection and shear force, we calculate the maximum moment, deflection, and shear force caused by a single truck live load using a single girder. Then the values are to be amplified by a factor, which is usually referred to as the live load distribution factor.

2.2 Bridge Types
Bridge is not a construction but it is a concept, the concept of crossing over large spans of land or huge masses of water. The idea behind a bridge is to connect two far-off points eventually reducing the distance between them. Apart from this poetic aspect of `bridges', there is a technical aspect to them that classifies bridges on the basis of the techniques of their construction. Bridges can be constructed entirely from reinforced concrete, pre-stressed, post-tensioned concrete, steel, wood or composite concrete deck-steel girders. These bridges may be comprised of a wood deck, concrete slab or steel deck on wood, concrete or steel girders. The box girder bridge can be used in such a way the top flanges of the precast box girders form the bridge deck surface. Many types of bridges have been used significantly on highway and road to facilitate the traffic flow. The bridge types covered by the simplified methods of analysis in the CHBDC are as follows: (a) Reinforced / post-tensioned solid slab (b) Post-tensioned circular / trapezoidal voided deck (c) Deck-on-girders, including concrete slab-on-girder, steel grid deck on girder and wood deck on girder (d) Truss and arch (e) Rigid frame and integral abutment types (f) Bridges incorporating wood beams (g) Multi-cell and multi-spine 7 

(h) Cable Stayed (i) Suspension Bridges built with adjacent precast, prestressed concrete box bridges are one of the most popular and economical solution because they can be constructed rapidly, and deck forming is eliminated. Adjacent box girders are widely used in most part of the world for span up to 32m, due to ease of erection, shallow superstructure depth and aesthetic appeal.

2.3 History of Prestressed Box Girders
The concept of prestressed concrete was discovered by the engineer P.H. Jackson, San Francisco, California, who patented the concept in 1872 and used it for tightening concrete blocks for floor slabs. The German Engineer C.E.W Doehring obtained a patent for prestressed concrete slab using metal wires concept about 1888. All these attempts were unsuccessful, because the prestressing force was lost due to shrinkage and creep of concrete. In 1927, the French engineer E. Fressynet (1879-1962) demonstrated the usefulness of prestressing using high-strength steel to control prestress losses (Steinman and Watson, 1957; Raafat, 1958; Lin, 1963; O'Connor, 1971; Naaman, 1982). Composite concrete deck slabs with precast prestressed girders have been extensively used in Canadian highways Since the 1950's, various configurations of precast prestressed concrete girders have been developed in many countries around the world for short-span bridges between 20 m and 36 m. In 1950, three types of these girders; I-, U-, and box-girders, were adopted in North America Standards which became known as AASHTO/PCI girders (Dunker and Rabbat, 1990).

8 

Precast prestressed box girders have been extensively used in Canadian highways. The use of prestressed concrete adjacent box girders started in about 1950 for bridges with span lengths of 9m to 32m, and these box girders are widely used today for these span lengths. The girders design evolved from an open channel design. Shear keys or construction in the top flange were used to transfer the load between adjacent girders. Macioce et al. (2007) reported that adjacent box beam bridges constructed of non-composite prestressed concrete with an asphalt wearing surface were developed during the interstate construction period to provide a shallow superstructure, rapid uncomplicated construction, and low initial costs.

2.4 Fabrication of Precast Prestressed Concrete Box Girders
Precast prestressed box girders are constructed with constant dimensions in a steel form. Strands are placed after the reinforcing steel, and then pre-tensioned by using jacks from out side the form. Hold-down points at defined locations are used to allow bending the strands from bottom layers at the middle of the girder to the upper surface at both ends. CPCI box girder types are the most commonly used prefabricated girders for bridges in Canada. We have four different sections of box girders i.e. B700, B800, B900 and B1000. All dimensions of these box girders are same except depth which varies from 700mm to 1000mm. These girders comprise of 1220 mm width, top and bottom flanges with thickness of 140mm, and the webs are 125mm thick (Precon, 2007).

2.5 Review of Previous Research on Load Distribution
2.5.1 Review of Study on Distribution Factors for Straight Bridges This section summarizes previous research work pertained to load distribution in bridges. According to the level of bridge lateral rigidity, different methodologies are implemented in practice, including lever rule, eccentric compression method, hinged joint method, fixed joint method, orthotropic plate analogy, AASHTO Standard, AASHTO-LRFD and CHBDC simplified method.

2.5.1.1 Elastic Theory Method (Newmark, 1948) An analytical procedure for determining shear and moment due to live load for both composite and non-composite bridges was developed by Newmark et al. (1948). They analyzed a number of bridges using simplified assumptions based on elastic theory. They recommended the following relationship for the transverse distribution of total longitudinal moment at a cross section in multi-girder bridges and presented the result of their work in a series of tables containing the fixed-end moment, distribution factors, and the carryover factors for both noncomposite and composite slab-on-girder bridges. MG = Df MT (2.1) (2.2)

Df =

S K

Where MG is the design moment of a given girder due to the live load at the section of interest,

MT is the maximum moment of the same girder due to a single design truck, Df is the
distribution factor, S is the girder spacing and K is a constant. Newmark et al. suggested K of 10 

1.676. The 1996 version of AASHTO standard (AASHTO, 1996) uses the same formula for girder spacing up to 1.829 m in order to determine the design moment for each girder in composite bridges. Experimental research work was carried out by Newmark et. al. at the University of Illinois to verify the above equations (Newmark et. Al, 1948). The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2006) adopts the basic approach of Newmark et al. for calculating the live load design moment for girders. The maximum live load moment in each girder is obtained by multiplying the maximum moment due to the design live load by distribution factor Df .

2.5.1.2 Orthotropic Plate Analogy (Bakht, 1979) In 1979, Bakht et al. used the concept of orthotropic plate to develop a simplified method for calculating the design live load longitudinal moments, see Figure 2.1. In their research, they conducted extensive parametric studies, which led them to find out that the distribution factor of bridges is related to a torsional parameter  and a flexural parameter , which are functions of geometry and material properties of the bridge. These parameters are given by:

=

Dxy + Dyx + D1 + D2 2(Dx Dy )
   
0.25

0.5

(2.3)

b   Dx = 2L   Dy

(2.4)

Where b is the bridge width, L is the span length of the bridge and the various rigidities are given by: Dx = EG I G E c t 3 + S 12
11 

(2.5)

Ec t 3 Dy = 12(1 -  c2 ) GG J G Gc t 3 + Dxy = S 6 D yx = Gc t 3 6

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

D1 = D2 =  c Dy

(2.9)

Which Ec, Gc and c are the Young's modulus, the shear modulus and the Poisson's ratio, respectively, t is the concrete slab thickness, S is the girder spacing, IG and JG are the flexural and torsional moment of inertia of the girder cross section, respectively. The subscript G refers to girder and c refers to the concrete slab. This method gives better results than the AASHTO recommendations that assume the girder spacing S is the only parameter that affects load distribution in slab-on-girder bridges. This method formed the basis of the 1991 version of the OHBDC as well as the CHBDC provisions. In 1982, Jaeger and Bakht used the grillage analogy method for the idealization of slab and beam bridges (Jaeger and Bakht, 1982). In grillage analogy method, the longitudinal members were positioned to coincide with the actual girders centrelines and were given the properties of the composite section. The transverse members were considered as beams replacing the strips of the top slab. The moment of inertia, Iy, of the transverse beam is considered as follows:

Iy =

Lx t 3 Ix 12

(2.10)

And the torsional inertia, Jx, is given by the relationship:

Gc Jx = Ec Iy
12 

(2.11)

In which results to:
 Ec   Lx t 3  Jx =    12   G  c   

(2.12)

Where Lx is the length of the strip in the longitudinal direction, t is the thickness of the strip, Ec and Gc are the concrete material modulus of elasticity and the shear modulus respectively. Details of simplified methods of analysis, which are also applicable for AASHTO loading, are given by Bakht and Jaeger (Bakht and Jaeger, 1985).

2.5.1.3 Lever Rule Method (Yao, 1990)

The lever rule is one of the most frequently used methods for calculation of distribution factors. In this method the deck between the girders is assumed to acts as a simply supported beam or cantilever beam, as shown in Figure 2.2. In this case, the load on each girder shall be taken as the reaction of the wheel loads. Lever rule is very accurate for two girder bridges. Lever rule can also be used for shear distribution near support, since the load would pass to the pier or abutment mostly through the adjacent two girders. Lever rule can also give very good results when the bridge transverse stiffness is relatively flexible. However, the results usually would be slightly conservative for the interior girders and unconservative for the exterior girders.

2.5.1.4 Hinged Joint Method (Yao, 1990)

The hinged joint method can also be used for small span concrete T-shaped girder bridges without intermediate diaphragms. Figures 2.3 demonstrate the free body diagrams of unit length section at bridge middle span of the hinged T-shaped girder bridge under unit
13 

sinusoidal load. Unlike the case of slab bridges, the deflection of the T-shaped girder flanges must be considered, as shown in Figures 2.3. When the cantilever length is within 0.80 m and the span length is greater than 10 m, the tables for calculating transverse influence line values for hinged slab bridges can also be used for hinged girder bridges. For better accuracy, detailed calculation is required for bridges beyond this range.

2.5.1.5 Fixed Joint Girder method (Yao, 1990)

In case when the lateral connection between girders is stiffer, the joint can be considered as a fixed joint. In addition to shear force at the joint, moment must also be considered, as shown in Figure 2.4. For n-girder bridge, a 2(n-1) order of indeterminate problem is to be solved to obtain the shear and moment at each joint. However, only shearing force gi is considered for calculating distribution factor. Once gi is known, the same procedure as in hinged joint method can be followed to obtain the transverse influence line as well as the distribution factors.

2.5.1.6 Grillage Method (Zokaie, 2000)

In 2000, Zokaie (Zokaie, 2000) carried out extensive analysis using grillage and finite element analysis to verify and evaluate the formulas, developed earlier in 1991. In the finite element model, shell element was used to represent the deck slab and frame element to represent the precast girders. In his study, Zokaie calibrated the developed formulas for moment and shear distribution factors to the interior and the exterior girders for bridges designed for one traffic lane and for bridges designed for two or more traffic lanes. According to this study, the

14 

distribution factor of longitudinal bending moment for slab-on-girder bridges for interior girders was given by the following equations: For one traffic lane:
 S D f = 0.1 +  4f 
0.3   S   Kg     L   Lt 3      s 0.4 0.1

(2.13)

For two or more traffic lanes:  S D f = 0.15 +  3f    S   Kg     L   Lt 3      s
0.6 0.2 0.1

(2.14)

The distribution factor of the longitudinal shear for slab-on-girder bridges for interior was given by the following equations: For one traffic lane:  S D f = 0.6 +   15 f     

(2.15)

For two or more traffic lanes:  S D f = 0.4 +  6f    S  -    25 f    
2

(2.16)

Where: S, L, Kg and ts are the spacing between girders, the span length, the longitudinal stiffness parameter, and the slab thickness, respectively. The factor f is a conversion factor between metric and imperial systems which equal to 304.8 mm and 1.0 ft. For exterior girders for one traffic lane, the factor 1.0 was provided for moment and shear related to the single beam distribution. For exterior girders for two or more traffic lanes, multiplication factors to the factors provided for interior girders are given as follows:
15 

For bending moment for two or more traffic lanes: e= 7 f + de  1.0 9.1 f (2.17)

For shear for two or more traffic lanes: e= 6 f + de 10 f (2.18)

Where: de is the edge distance. The factor f is a conversion factor between metric and imperial systems which equal to 304.8 mm. Zokaie concluded that the results from the formulas previously provided in 1991 were within 5% of the results from the finite element analysis that he performed in his study in the year 2000.

2.5.1.7 The Finite-Element Method (Logan 2002)

This is the most famous and widely used method in many engineering applications. The principal of this numerical method is discretizing the structure into small divisions, or elements, where each element is defined by specific number of nodes (hence this process of modeling a body by dividing it into an equivalent system of smaller bodies or units called finite elements). The finite-element method is a numerical acceptable solution, it formulation of the problem results in a system of simultaneous algebraic equations for solution, rather than requiring analytical solutions (solutions of ordinary or differential equations), which because of the complicated geometries, loadings, and material properties, are not usually obtainable. The behavior of each element, and ultimately the structure, is assumed to be a function of its nodal quantities (displacements and/or stresses), which considered as the primary unknown of its nodal quantities. The modern development of the
16 

finite-element method began by Hrennikoff in the 1941 and McHenry in 1943 using (onedimensional) elements (bars and beams) in the field of structural engineering. In 1947 Levy developed the flexibility or force method, and in 1953 he suggested that another method (the stiffness or displacement method) could be a promising alternative for use in analyzing statically redundant aircraft structures. However his equations were cumbersome to solve by hand, and hence it only became popular after the advent of the high speed computers. Turner et al. was the first who introduced the treatment of two-dimensional elements in 1956, they derived stiffness matrices for truss elements, beam elements, and two-dimensional triangular and rectangular elements in plane stress. The finite-element method extended to cover threedimensional problems only after the development of tetrahedral stiffness matrix which was done by Martin in 1961.

2.5.1.8 Erin Hughs and Rola Idriss Study 2006

This study presents an evaluation of shear and moment live-load distribution factors for a new, prestressed concrete, spread box-girder bridge. The shear and moment distribution factors were measured under a live-load test using embedded fiber-optic sensors and used to verify a finite element model. The model was then loaded with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation (AASHTO) design truck. The resulting maximum girder distribution factors were compared to those calculated from both the AASHTO standard specifications and the AASHTO LRFD bridge design specifications. The LRFD specifications predictions of girder distribution factors were accurate to conservative when compared to the finite element model for all distribution factors. The standard specifications predictions of girder distribution factors ranged from highly unconservative to highly
17 

conservative when compared to the finite element model. For the study bridge, the LRFD specifications would result in a safe design, though exterior girders would be overdesigned. The standard Specifications, however, would result in an unsafe design for interior girders and overdesigned exterior girders.

2.5.1.9 Song, Chai and Hida Study 2003

The current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specifications impose fairly strict limits on the use of its live-load distribution factor for design of highway bridges. These limits include requirements for a prismatic cross section, a large span-length-to-width ratio, and a small plan curvature. Refined analyses using 3D models are required for bridges outside of these limits. These limits place severe restrictions on the routine design of bridges in California, as box-girder bridges outside of these limits are frequently constructed. This paper presents the results of a study investigating the live-load distribution characteristics of box-girder bridges and the limits imposed by the LRFD specifications. Distribution factors determined from a set of bridges with parameters outside of the LRFD limits are compared with the distribution factors suggested by the LRFD specifications. For the range of parameters investigated, results indicated that the current LRFD distribution factor formulas generally provide a conservative estimate of the design bending moment and shear force.

2.5.1.10 AASHTO Methods

AASHTO introduced empirical methods which are more convenient to use as compared with the theoretical methods mentioned above. AASHTO defines the distribution factor as
18 

the ratio of the moment or shear obtained from the bridge system to the moment or shear obtained from a single girder loaded by one truck wheel line (AASHTO Standard 1996) or the axle loads (AASHTO-LRFD 2004). It should be noted that AASHTO Standard Specifications and AASHTO LRFD Specifications define the live load differently. The live load in the Standard specifications consists of an HS 20 truck or a lane load. While, the live load in the LRFD specifications consists of an HS 20 truck in conjunction with a lane load.

2.5.1.10.1 AASHTO Standard Method 1996

AASHTO Standard specifications contain simple procedures used in the analysis and design of highway bridges. AASHTO adopted the simplified formulas for distribution factors based on the work done in the 1940s by Newmark (1948). AASHTO typical procedure is used to calculate the maximum bending moment based on a single line of wheel loads from the HS20 design truck or lane loading. This calculated bending moment is then multiplied by the load distribution factor (S/5.5) or in the format of (S/D), where S is the girder spacing in feet and D is a constant based on the bridge type to obtain the moment in an individual girder. This method is applicable to straight and right (non-skewed) bridges only. It was proved to be accurate when girder spacing was near 1.8m and span length was about 18 m (Zokaie, 2000). For relatively medium or long bridges, these formulas would lose accuracy.

2.5.1.10.2 AASHTO LRFD Method

The specifications outlined in Load and Resistance Factor Design, LRFD Design specifications were adopted (AASHTO, 2004). This code introduced another load distribution factors based on a comprehensive research project, National Cooperation
19 

Highway Research Program (NCHRP) 12-26 which was entitled "Distribution of Live Loads on Highway Bridges" and initiated in 1985, consequently the guide specification for Distribution of Loads for Highway Bridges (AASHTO, 1994) was found. This guide recommends the use of simplified formulas, simplified computer analysis, and/or detailed finite-element analysis (FEA) in calculating the actual distribution of loads in highway bridges. It was noted that those new formulas were generally more complicated than those recommended by the Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges (AASHTO 1996), but their use is associated with a greater degree of accuracy (Munir, 1997). For example the lateral load distribution factor for bending moment in interior girders of concrete slab on steel girder bridge superstructure is:

g = 0.15 + (S/3)0.6 (S/L)0.2 (Kg/12Lt3s)0.1

(2.19)

Where g = wheel load distribution factor; S = girder spacing in feet, (3.5 < S < 16); L = span length of the beam in feet ( 20 < L < 200); ts = concrete slab thickness in inches (4.5 < t < 12); Kg = longitudinal stiffness parameter = n(I + Ae2g); n = modular ratio between beam and deck material; I = moment of inertia of beam (in.4); A = cross-sectional area of beam (in.2) and eg = distance between the center of gravity of the basic beam and deck (in.). AASHTO LRFD Specifications have become highly attractive for bridge engineers because of its incentive permitting the better and more economical use of material. The rationality of LRFD and its many advantages over the Allowable Stress Design method, ASD, are indicative that the design philosophy will downgrade ASD to the background in the next few years (Salmon and Johnson, 1996). The research results were first adopted by AASHTO

20 

Standards in 1994 and were then officially adopted by AASHTO-LRFD in 1998. More parameters, such as girder spacing, bridge length, slab thickness, girder longitudinal stiffness, and skew effect are considered in the developed formulas which earned them sound accuracy. The AASHTO-LRFD formulas were evaluated by Shahawy and Huang (2001), their evaluation showed a good agreement with test results for bridges with two or more loaded design lanes, provided that girder spacing and overhang deck did not exceed 2.4 m and 0.9 m, respectively. Outside of these ranges, the error could be as much as up to 30%. For one loaded design lane, the relative error was less than 10% for interior girders and could be as high as 100% and as low as ­30% for exterior girders. Shahawy and Huang presented modification factors for the AASHTO LRFD formulas and the results of the modified formulas showed good agreement with their test results (Shahawy and Huang, 2001).

2.5.1.11 Simplified Methods of Analysis (CHBDC 2006)

The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2006), as well as the 1991 version of the Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code (OHBDC, 1991)), specifies simplified method of analysis for live load using load distribution factors for slab-on-girder bridges. For OHBDC, the simplified method of analysis for the live load is based on considering the bridge as a rectangular orthotropic plate that was simply supported at two opposite ends on unyielding line supports which were continuous across the width of the plate and did not impose moment restraint. For CHBDC, the simplified method of analysis for the live load is based on the results from many bridge structures using grillage, semi-continuum and finite element methods for which the idealized structure was essentially an orthotropic plate. There are conditions and limitations for the use of simplified method of analysis, which are specified in
21 

the CHBDC. Conditions for applying simplified methods of analysis on straight bridges are as follows: 1. The bridge width is constant; 2. The support conditions are closely equivalent to line support; 3. The skew Parameter ( = S tan  /L) does not exceed 1/18 where "S" is the spacing between girders, "" is the skew angle and "L" is the span length; 4. There shall be at least three longitudinal girders that are of equal flexural rigidity and equally spaced or with variation from the mean of not more than 10% in each case; and 5. The overhang does not exceed 60% of the spacing between longitudinal girders and not more than 1.80 m. These restrictions have been provided for the consistency between the methods of analysis in CHBDC and OHBDC. Shear-connected beam bridges are analyzed by the methods applicable to shallow superstructure provided that continuity of transverse flexural rigidity across the cross-section is present. If not, analysis for longitudinal moments and shears is by the same method as for multispine box girders. When the skew angle "" of a bridge is less than 20o, it has usually been considered safe to ignore the skew angle and analyze the bridge as a right bridge whose span is equal to the skew span. The implication of this practice is that the angle of skew is considered to be the only necessary measure of the "skewness" of the bridge with respect to its load distribution characteristics. Extensive comparative analyses of skew and equivalent right bridges

conducted by Jaeger and Bakht showed that the angle of skew of the bridge is not the only necessary measure of its skew ness, which is also affected by its span, width and girder spacing, if present. In particular, it has been shown that a dimensionless parameter characterizing the skewness of a slab-on-girder bridge is S tan  /L. For permitting the analysis of a skew bridge
22 

as an equivalent right bridge, the Code has imposed the upper limits of 1/18 for this parameter to ensure that the shear values in particular are not in unsafe error by more than 5%. CHBDC noted that the force effects in skewed, slab-on-girder type bridges may be analyzed by the simplified methods presented, if the other conditions of the simplified method are met. The simplified method presented in the CODE enable the designer to calculate the increased shear effects that occur with increase in skewness. CHBDC stated that the two limitations pertaining to an overhanging deck slab, noted in condition 5, relate to the need to have the structure remain such that the orthotropic plate approximation is closely applicable. For a slab-on-girder bridge with equally spaced girders a distance S apart, a cantilever overhang of S/2 on either side is the desired condition, since each longitudinal girder can then be associated in a width S/2 of deck on either side of its centreline; a uniformly distributed load over the entire deck area would then result in the girders sharing equally in accepting the total longitudinal responses. If the overhang is permitted to be a maximum of 0.6S, the outer girders then accept rather more bending moment and shear force than the interior ones, but the departure from uniformity is still acceptable. So far as the limitation on the deck overhang of 1.80 m is concerned, when due allowance is made for barrier walls, curbs, etc. this limitation means that when a vehicle is travelling as far over in the outside lane as possible, its centre of gravity will not be significantly outside the centreline of the outermost girder. This limitation is necessary if the orthotropic plate representation is to be realistic. The bridges selected for establishing analysis results for the simplified methods in this Code had the same limitations for the deck slab overhang, being equal to or less than 60% of the girder spacing, S, with a maximum overhang equal to 1.8 m.

23 

The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2006) specifies equations for the simplified method of analysis to determine the longitudinal bending moments and vertical shear in slab-on-girder bridges due to live load for ultimate, serviceability and fatigue limit states using load distribution factors. The CHBDC distribution factor equations used for slab-on-prestressed-girders are as follows: For the longitudinal bending moment per girder, M g , for ultimate and serviceability limit states: M g = Fm M g avg (2.20)

Where M g avg is the average moment per girder and Fm is an amplification factor for the transverse variation in maximum longitudinal moment intensity (Distribution Factor).

CHAPTER III FINITE-ELEMENT ANALYSIS
3.1 General
The advancement of computers in terms of hardware and software engineering let the structural engineering enter into a new era. More extensive and approximate numerical solutions to complicated engineering problems were initiated due to the wide use of the finite element method. The finite element method is considered the most powerful and versatile method of analysis available nowadays. In early 1980's, the grillage analogy method was extensively used and was very popular. Because of the recent development in the finite element method, and the large capacities of high-speed computers, it is possible to model a bridge in a very realistic manner and to provide a full description of its structural response due to different loading conditions. One of the most important advantages of the finite element method is the ability to deal with problems that have arbitrary arrangements of structural elements, material properties, and boundary conditions. Finite element analysis has proven to give reliable results when compared to experimental findings; this built up trust encouraged the designers and code writers to allow the implementation of the finite element method in the analysis and design of different engineering structures. The finite element analysis software "SAP2000" version 10 was used throughout this study to determine the structural behaviour of the prestressed concrete box girder bridges under truck loads. A general

description of this software is presented further in this chapter. The developed finite element methods described herein were used to perform extensive parametric study on the structural

27 

response of precast prestressed concrete box girder bridges due to CHBDC truck loading conditions.

The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC 2006), section 5.9, permits the use of six different refined methods of analysis for short and medium span bridges. The finite element method is one of the methods recognized by CHBDC. From all the six permitted methods, the finite element method is considered to be the most powerful, and versatile. In finite element method solutions can be find out without the use of governing differential equations, It permits the combination of various structural elements such as plates, beams, and shells, It is able to analyze structures having arbitrary geometries with any material variations thereof, and It is possible to automate every step involved in the method. In this chapter a brief description of finite-element approach will be reviewed as well as descriptions of modeling the different components of the composite box-girder bridges. The available commercial finite-element program, SAP2000, was utilized through this study to determine the structural response of the modeled bridge prototypes. A general description of this software is presented later in this chapter. The procedure to perform an extensive parametric study on selected straight and curved bridge prototypes, loading cases, and different bridge configurations, to evaluate loads distribution characteristics is explained also in this chapter.

3.2

Finite-Element Approach

The finite-element method is a numerical method for solving problems of engineering and mathematical physics. In structural engineering problems, the solution is typically concerned

28 

with determining stresses and displacements and will yield approximate values of the unknowns at discrete number of points in a continuum. This numerical method of analysis starts by discretizing a model. This numerical method of analysis which begins by dividing a body into an equivalent system of smaller bodies or units (finite-elements) interconnected at points (nodes) common to two or more elements and/or boundary lines and/or surfaces is called discretization. Hence, instead of solving the problem for the entire body in one operation, it facilitates the formation of equations for each finite-element and at the end; it will combine them to obtain the solution of the whole body. For the purpose of simplifying the formulation of the above elements equations, matrix methods are implemented. Matrix methods are considered as an important tools used to structure the program of the finiteelement methods to facilitate their computation process in high-speed computers.

In general there are two approaches associated with the finite-element; (1) force or flexibility method, and (2) displacement or stiffness method. It has been shown that for computational purposes, the latter method is more desirable because its formulation is simpler for most structural analysis problems; moreover a vast majority of general-purpose finite-element programs have incorporated the displacement formulation for solving structure problems. The finite-element method uses different types of elements; (1) one dimensional element or so called linear element; (2) two-dimensional element which can be in the forms of plane element or triangular and quadrilateral shape elements; and (3) threedimensional solid shape elements.

29 

Selecting the most appropriate element type should be to model the most closely to the actual physical behaviour. An equation is then formulated combining all the elements to obtain a solution for one whole body. Using a displacement formulation, the stiffness matrix of each element is derived and the global stiffness matrix of the entire structure can be formulated by the direct stiffness method. This global stiffness matrix, along with the given displacement boundary conditions and applied loads is then solved, thus that the displacements and stresses for the entire system are determined. The global stiffness matrix represents the nodal forcedisplacement relationships and is expressed in a matrix equation form as follows:

[P] = [K][U]
Where: [P] [K] [U] = = = nodal load vector; the global stiffness matrix; the nodal displacement vector;

(3.1)

The steps for deriving the above equation can be summarized in the following basic relationships: a)

 ( x, y ) = [ ( x, y )][ ]
Where:

(3.2)

 ( x, y ) =
[ (x,y)] =

the internal displacement vector of the element; the displacement function matrix; and

[] = the generalized coordinates matrix. b)

[U ] = [A][ ]

then, [ ] = [ A] [U ]

[ (x , y )] = [D] [ (x , y )] = [D][B (x , y )][A]-1 [U ]

[k'] = the element stiffness matrix. f) From the principle of virtual work, WE = WI. By taking one element of virtual nodal displacement vector [u'] equal to unity successfully, the solution becomes:

[P] = [K ][U ]

(3.9)

Where [K] = [k'], so the global structural stiffness matrix is an assemblage of the element stiffness matrix [k']. g) The solution of the resulting system of equations yields the values of nodal displacement [U] and the internal forces for each element can be obtained from equation (3.4). In the case of a linear (elastic) structural problem, loads are first applied on a model and the solution is obtained directly. In a non-linear case, the analysis follows a different numerical method to obtain a solution. However, such analysis is beyond the scope of this thesis and is not discussed.

3.3 SAP2000 Computer Program
The software "SAP2000" is a structural analysis program that employs the finite-element method in the analysis and designs of complicated structures. During the 1980's and 1990's SAP engineering software become a popular choice for finite element analysis. The program is used worldwide to estimate structural responses of structures due to various applied loads. This program has a range of capabilities depending on the version used. SAP2000 is also capable of analyzing structures in static and/or dynamic modes. Its finite-element library consists of six elements.
32 

1. FRAME Element: The Frame element is a two-node three-dimensional element, which includes the effect of biaxial bending, tension, axial deformation, and biaxial shear deformation. 2. Shell Element: The Shell element is a three or four-node three-dimensional element, which combines separate membrane and plate-bending behaviour. The membrane behaviour includes translational in-plane stiffness components and rotational stiffness component in the direction normal to the plane of the element. The plate bending behaviour includes two-way, out of plane, plate rotational stiffness components and translational stiffness component in the direction normal to the plane of the element. The program allows using pure membrane, pure plate, or full shell behaviour. 3. Plane Element: The Plane element is a three- to nine-node two-dimensional element, which contributes stiffness only in the two translational degrees of freedom at each of its connected joints. Plane element is used for modeling thin plane stress structures and long plane strain structures. 4. Solid Element: The Solid element is an eight-node three-dimensional element, which includes nine optional incompatible bending modes. The solid element contributes stiffness in all three translational degrees of freedom at each of its connected joints. 5. Asolid Element: The Asolid element is a three- to nine-node two-dimensional element, which contributes stiffness only in the two translational degrees of freedom at each of its connected joints. Asolid element is used for modeling axisymmetric structures under axisymmetric loading.
33 

6. Nllink Element: The Nllink element is a one joint grounded spring or two joint link which is composed of six separate springs, one of each of the six deformational degrees of freedom. The Nllink element is used for modeling linear or nonlinear structural behaviour. The nonlinear behaviour is used only for the time-history analysis. In addition, subsets of these elements with varying degrees of freedom are available in the form of truss, frame, membrane, beam, strain, gap, and hook elements.

3.4 Finite Element Modeling of Box Girder Bridges
A three dimensional finite element model was used to analyze the box girder bridges in this study. A sensitivity study was conducted to choose the finite element mesh. The finite element mesh is usually chosen based on pilot runs and is a compromise between economy and accuracy. In the finite modeling process, the structure is first divided into several components. In this research, the bridges were divided into: concrete bottom flange, concrete top flange (deck slab), concrete webs, concrete diaphragms and concrete connection joints, as shown in Figures 3.10 and 3.11.

3.4.1 Geometric Modeling 3.4.1.1 Modeling of Webs, Top and Bottom Flanges, and Diaphragms
To analyze box girder bridges and to determine their structural response, a threedimensional finite-element model was adopted. To facilitate the analysis, the structure was divided into major components as follows: top flange, bottom flange, web, and connection
34 

joints. From SAP2000 library, the four-node shell element was chosen to model all bridge components, see Figure 3.9. The four-node shell element has six degrees of freedom at each node that are three displacements (U1, U2, U3) and three rotations (1, 2, 3). Four

horizontal elements were used to model each top and bottom flanges, three vertical elements were used to model the web. It should be noted that web and bottom flange thicknesses were taken as those specified in the Precon Manual, while the thickness of top flange was taken as 225 mm. One horizontal shell element was used for connection joint between the box girders at top flange centre-line. The thickness of this shell element was taken as 225 mm as the flange thickness. End diaphragms between the webs of each box were modeled with a total of twelve elements comprised of five elements in the lateral direction and two elements in the vertical direction. A diaphragm thickness of 300 mm was considered in this study. No intermediate diaphragms were used along the bridge span between supports. In the longitudinal direction of the bridge, number of elements are depends on the length of bridge.

A case sensitivity study has been carried out to investigate the accuracy of the results from the finite element analysis. In this study, various numbers of elements, in the longitudinal, vertical and transverse directions of the bridge model, have been considered. The various number and types of boundary conditions were used to find the accurate results. The level of accuracy of the developed FEA model was examined against results from simple beam analysis for the following loading cases: (i) self-weight of the bridge superstructure; (ii) a uniform superimposed loading of 10 kN/m2; and a line load at the mid-span section of total value of 100 kN. The straining actions considered for comparison were maximum bending stresses at midspan location, maximum mid-span deflection and support reaction. The results from the
35 

sensitivity study are presented in Table A.1 through A.8 for a bridge prototype of 6 box girders and 7.396 bridge width. The analysis was conducted for different span lengths and box girder depth. The results shown in these tables indicate that the proposed finite-element models for this parametric study provides results within +2.0% differences from those obtained from simple-beam analysis.

3.4.1.2 Aspect Ratio

The aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the longest dimension to the shortest dimension of a quadrilateral element. In many cases, as the aspect ratio increases, the inaccuracy of the solution increases (Logan, 2002). Logan presented a graph showing that as the aspect ratio rises above 4, the percentage of error from the exact solution increases greater than 15%. By maintaining the length of the shell elements in the direction of bridge as 500 mm, the maximum aspect ratio used in the modeling of elements in this study was 2.5.

3.4.1.3 Modeling of Moving Load Paths
SAP2000 software has the ability to run a moving load along a defined frame element path. The program shifts a group of loads, previously defined as static loads, certain interval along a defined path and provides the extreme straining actions at each node. Therefore, Frame elements are provided in the longitudinal direction at the top of the shell elements for the paths of the moving loads. These frame elements are modeled with a very small section dimensions so that they do not affect the finite element model of the structure. Static loads on frame elements were used to reduce the time of computer runs and placed to provide equivalent

36 

maximum bending moment, deflection and shear force resulted from SAP2000 moving loads runs.

3.4.2 Boundary Conditions
Nodal constraints were used in the analysis as boundary conditions to represent the supports of the bridge. The roller support condition at the every node of the bottom flange of the box girder was provided at the one end of the bridge to restrain both vertical and lateral displacements. While, the hinged support condition at every node of the bottom flange of the box girder was provided at the other end of the bridge to restrain displacements in all directions.

3.4.3 Material Modeling
The material properties can highly affect the results of the analysis. Therefore, it is important that the material properties are defined so that SAP2000 software can provide suitable properties for elements. Material properties are considered linear elastic and isotropic for these structures. The required properties for SAP2000 software are the elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, the weight density, the mass density and the coefficient of the thermal expansion in three directions. In SAP2000 software, the shear modulus is defined in terms of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio as per the following equation:
G= E 2(1+  ) (3.10)

Where: G= the shear modulus;
37 

E= =

Young's modulus; and Poisson's ratio.

Materials and their properties are chosen based on the CHBDC and the common materials available in Ontario. The compressive strength of concrete (f'c) is considered 35 MPa. As per CHBDC, the weight density (c) for normal prestressed concrete is considered 24.0 kN/m3. The modulus of elasticity of concrete (Ec) is calculated from the following equation: Ec = 3000 f c + 6900 ( c / 2300) Ec = 27,900.0 MPa Poisson's ratio for elastic strains of concrete is taken as 0.2. Mass density for concrete is taken as 2500 kg/m3.

3.5 CHBDC Design Loading
The design of Highways and Bridges in Canada has its own criteria in terms of the critical live loads selected in the design. Two types of live loads were specified in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2006); namely: truck loading and lane loading. Both above mentioned loads were investigated in this study. Figure 3.3 shows a view the above mentioned CHBDC live truck and lane loads namely; CL-W truck loading and the CL-W lane loading. The CL-W truck is an idealized five-axle truck, the number "W" indicates the gross load (625) of the CL-W truck in KN. Wheel and axle loads are shown in terms of W, and are also shown specifically for CL-625 truck. Whereas the CL-W lane loading consists of CL-W truck loading, with each axle load reduced to 80% of its original value, and superimposed within a uniformly distributed load of 9 KN/m over 3.0 m width.
38 

For the purpose of this study, the following different CHBDC truck loading configurations were considered: Figure 3.4 presents a schematic diagram of truck axle load locations to produce maximum bending moment. By inspection, Level 2 loading was used in the analysis of the 16m and 20m span bridges, while Level 4 was used to analyze bridges of 24, 26, 30 and 32m spans. Figure 3.5 presents a schematic diagram of truck axle load locations to produce maximum reaction force. By inspection, Level 2 loading was used in the analysis of the 16m span bridges, while Level 4 was used to analyze bridges of 20, 24, 26, 30 and 32m spans. In studying the moment, shear and deflection distributions, the loading on the bridge prototypes was applied in such a way to produce maximum reaction forces and longitudinal flexural stresses.

3.6 CHBDC Specifications for Truck Loading
The live load specified in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, CHBDC, consists of CL-W Truck or CL-W Lane Load. CL-W Truck, provided for all other provinces, in the axle loads. The selection between the two different CHBDC types of live loads (CL-625 truck and CL-625 lane) depends on whichever gives the greatest design values. Dynamic load allowance is applied to both CL-W and CL-625-ONT Trucks. The CL-W Lane Load consists of 80% of the value given for each axle of the CL-W Truck superimposed within a uniformly distributed load of 9 kN/m and a space of 3.0 m wide (Figure 3.3). No dynamic load allowance is considered for both CL-W and CL-625-ONT Lane Loads. A sensitivity study was carried out in this regard showed that the CL-625 truck loading is governing the extreme design values for the box girder of 16, 20, 24, 26, 30 and 32m span lengths. CL-625 truck loading

39 

giving higher values, accordingly the CL-625 lane loading was utilized in this study. CHBDC requires considering three limit states in bridge designs; namely: a. The Ultimate Limit State (ULS), that involve failure, including rupture, overturning, sliding, and other instability, b. The Serviceability Limit State (SLS), at which the effect of vibration, permanent deformation, and cracking on the usability or condition of the structure are considered, c. The Fatigue Limit State (FLS), at which the effect of fatigue on the strength or condition of the structure are considered. For fatigue analysis, an equivalent static load is specified in the CHBDC. Only one truck, either CL-W Truck or CL-625-ONT Truck, can be placed at the centre of one travelling lane. The lane load is not considered for the fatigue limit state. CHBDC states that for longitudinal bending moments and associated deflections for Fatigue Limit State and superstructure vibration, the vehicle edge distance (the distance from the centre of the outer wheel load to the edge of the bridge) shall not be greater than 3.0 m. Dead load and truck load cases were considered for each of the above three CHBDC requirements. Different loading configurations were also considered in this study represented by: two-lanes, three-lane and four-lane bridges. As a result, a total of 48 different load cases were employed of the above mentioned design requirements. Figures 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 presents the loading cases considered in this study for two-, three-, and fourlane bridges, respectively.

3.7 Composite Bridge Configurations
192 concrete box girder bridge prototypes with were considered for the finite-element analysis in this parametric study. Below are the major parameters were considered: a. Span length (L): 16, 20, 24, 26, 30, and 32 m b. Girder spacing (S): 1.235 m based on the commercial size of precast box girders c. Number of precast box girders (N): 6 to 14 Based on CHBDC code which specifies number of design lanes as a basis for bridge width (see Tables 3.1), some of the above diversity of parameters were determined. Other bridge configurations are listed as below:
¾ The deck slab (Top flange) thickness was taken as 225 mm, ¾ The bottom flange thickness was taken as 140 mm, ¾ The girder web thickness was considered equal to 125 mm, ¾ The thickness of joints between boxed was maintained 225 mm, and width 140 mm.

The later represents a 15 mm gap between boxes and half the web thickness on each side.
¾ The deck slab width (Wc) was taken equal to the total bridge width minus 1.0 m to

allow for barrier wall thickness of 0.5 m on each side of the bridge,

3.8 Load Distribution Factor 3.8.1 Calculation of the Moment Distribution Factors
We calculated the longitudinal stresses (FE) in girders at the bottom surface of the bottom flange in order to determine load distribution factor for longitudinal bending moment (Fm) due to truck loadings. The maximum flexural stresses (
straight) truck,

were calculated for the

straight simply-supported beam due to CHBDC truck loading.

(straight) truck = MT (yb) / It

(3.13)

¾ where MT = the mid-span moment for a straight simply supported girder due to a

single CHBDC truck loading.
¾ yb = the distance from the neutral axis to the bottom flange. ¾ It = the moment of inertia of the box girder.

Also the results of the above equations were verified by SAP2000 program using the developed FEA model. The finite-element modeling was then used to calculate the maximum longitudinal flexural stresses along the bottom flange for dead loads, fully-loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading conditions presented in Figs. 3.6 to 3.8. Consequently, the moment distribution factors (Fm,) due to dead loading, fatigue loading conditions and various truck loading conditions, respectively, were calculated as follows:
¾ (Fm)DL = ( FE.)DL / ( straight)DL ¾ (Fm)FL = ( FE.)FL x N / (( straight)truck x n) ¾ (Fm)PL = ( FE.)PL x N x RL / (( straight)truck x n x RL)

(3.14) (3.15) (3.17)

( FE.)FL

= the maximum average flexure stress, resulting from FEA bridge analysis, at the bottom surface of the bottom flange of the girder due to fatigue Loadings;

3.8.2 Calculation of the Shear Distribution Factors
In determining the shear distribution factor (Fv) for box girder, the maximum shear forces, (Rstraight)truck, were calculated for straight simply supported beam due to a single CHBDC truck loading. By using finite-element modeling, the maximum shear forces (RFE) for dead load, fully loaded lanes, partially loaded lanes, and fatigue loading were determined. Consequently, the shear distribution factors (Fv) were calculated as follows: (Fv)DL = (RFE. ext)DL / (Rstraight)DL (Fv)FL = (RFE.)FL x N / ((Rstraight)truck x n) (Fv)PL = (RFE.)PL x N x RL/ ((Rstraight)truck x n x RL) (Fv)Fat = (RFE.)Fat x N / (Rstraight)truck (3.18) (3.19) (3.20) (3.21)

3.8.3 Calculation of the Deflection Distribution Factors
In order to determine the load distribution factor for deflections (Fd) for the exterior girders, the deflection resulting from bridge analysis at the critical section (FE), due to truck loadings at fatigue load case was identified. Also, the deflection for the corresponding single girder, resulting from the analysis at the corresponding critical section of the bridge (straight)
truck,

due to single truck loading was identified. The maximum deflection at the

bottom flange was identified from the average vertical displacements for the three nodal joints adjacent to the chosen section. The distribution factors for deflections were calculated in accordance with CHBDC as follows: For deflection at exterior girders for fatigue (Ff ext): (Fd)Fat.ext = (FE ext)Fat x N /(straight) truck Where:

CHAPTER IV RESULTS FROM THE PARAMETRIC STUDY
4.1 General
A practical-design-oriented parametric study on 192 simply-supported straight, deck-free, adjacent precast box-girder bridge prototypes was conducted to investigate the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors at the ultimate, serviceability and fatigue limit states. The bridges were analyzed to evaluate their structural responses when subjected to the Canadian Highway Bridge Design truck loading, CHBDC truck CL-625. Based on the results generated from the parametric study, new simplified formulas for Moment, shear and deflection Distribution Factors for such bridges were developed. These equations will be useful for code writers and bridge engineers designing such bridge superstructure.

In this study the following major key parameters were considered: a) Number of girders (N), b) Girder spacing (S), c) Girder size (I, Yb,... etc), d) Bridge span length (L), e) Number of design lanes (n), and f) Truck loading conditions

The following sections present the results from the parametric study as compared to the available equations in CHBDC for voided slab bridges, slab-on-girder bridges and multiplespine composite steel box girder bridges. The chapter will conclude with the developed
46 

equations and their limitation of use along with correlation between the FEA values and those from the developed equation to stand on the latter's level of accuracy.

4.2 Effect of Number of Girders
To form a cross section of the bridge, precast box beams were used. These beams are of fixed width of 1.22 m. considering 15 mm gap between boxes, the served width of the box would be 1.235 m. As such, the bridge width is a multiplier of the box width and increases with increase in number of girders. Therefore, changes in bridge width and number of girders are assumed to have similar effect of the structural response of such bridges. Bridge width, deck width and the numbers of girders for different design lanes considered in this study are given below. For bridge cross-section with two design lanes: a) Bridge width = 7.396m, deck width = 6.396 m and number of box girders = 6 b) Bridge width = 8.631m, deck width = 7.631m and number of box girders = 7 c) Bridge width = 9.866m, deck width = 8.866m and number of box girders = 8 For bridge cross-section with three design lanes: a) Bridge width = 11.101m, deck width = 10.101m and number of box girders = 9 b) Bridge width = 12.336m, deck width = 11.336m and number of box girders =10 c) Bridge width = 13.571m, deck width = 12.571m and number of box girders =11 For bridge cross-section with four design lanes: a) Bridge width = 14.806m, deck width = 13.806m and number of box girders = 12 b) Bridge width = 16.041m, deck width = 15.041m and number of box girders =13 c) Bridge width = 17.276m, deck width = 16.276m and number of box girders =14

47 

The following subsections explain the effect of number of girders on the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors.

4.2.1 Moment Distribution Factor
Figures 4.1 to 4.24 show the relationship between the number of girders and moment distribution factor, Fm, of selected bridge geometries. The results are introduced for both ULS and SLS design and FLS design. As an example, Figure 4.1 depicts the change in moment distribution factor with increase in number of girders for a two-lane, 16-m span, bridge made of B700 box girders. It can be observed that Fm changes from 1.17 to 1.28 when increasing number of girders from 6 to 8 (or increasing bridge width) for FLS design. This considers an increase of 9.4%. On the other hand, Fm increases from 1.09 to 1.13 when increasing number of girders from 6 to 8 (an increase of 3.7%) for ULS and SLS designs. It should be noted that the change in bridge width and corresponding number of girders is implied in the parameter µ in equation 2.27 in the CHBDC simplified method.

4.2.2 Shear Distribution Factor
Figures 4.25 to 4.48 show the relationship between the number of girders and the shear distribution factor, Fv, of selected bridge geometries. The results are introduced for both ULS and SLS design and FLS design. To explain the trend, Figure 4.25 is taken here as an example. This figure shows the change in shear distribution factor with increase in number of girders for a two-lane, 16-m span, bridge made of B700 box girders. It can be observed that Fv changes from 1.99 to 2.74 when increasing number of girders from 6 to 8 for FLS design. This

48 

considers an increase of 37.7%. On the other hand, Fv increases from 1.29 to 1.68 when increasing number of girders from 6 to 8 (an increase of 30%) for ULS and SLS designs.

4.2.3 Deflection Distribution Factor
Figures 4.49 through 4.60 depicts the change in deflection distribution factor, Fd, with increase in number of girders. As an example, Figure 4.49 depicts the change in deflection distribution factor with increase in number of girders for a two-lane, 16-m span, bridge made of B700 box girders. It can be observed that Fd changes from 1.14 to 1.19 when increasing number of girders from 6 to 7, then it decrease to 1.16 when increasing number of girders to 8 for FLS designs. By inspection, it can be observed that the rate of change of Fd values with change in number of girders is less than that for moment and shear distribution factors presented in the previous subsections.

4. 3 Effect of Span Length
To study bridge span effect of the structural response of studied bridges, 6 different span length were considered, namely: 16, 20, 24, 26, 30 and 32 m. To maintain realistic bridge flexural stiffness with increase in bridge span, four different box girder sizes (B700, B800, B900 and B1000) were considered in the FEA modeling as follows: a) B700 box girder for 16 and 24 m spans, b) B800 box girder for 20 and 26 m spans, c) B900 box girder for 24 and 30 m spans, and d) B1000 box girder for 26 and 32 m spans.

49 

The following subsections explain the effect of span length of the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors of the studied bridges.

4.3.1 Moment Distribution Factor
Figures 4.61 to 4.69 show the relationship between the change in span length and moment distribution factor, Fm, of selected bridge geometries. To explain the trend, Figure 4.68 depicts the change in moment distribution factor with increase in span length of a four-lane bridge made of 13 box girders and 16 m bridge width. It can be observed that Fm changes from 1.15 to 1.04 when increasing span length from 16 to 32 m for ULS design. This considers a decrease of 9.6%. In the same sense, Fm decreases from 1.87 to 1.41 when increasing bridge span from 16 to 32 m (a decrease of 24.6%) for FLS design. It should be noted that the change in bridge width and corresponding number of girders is implied in the parameters F and Cf in equation 2.22 in the CHBDC simplified method.

4.3.2 Shear Distribution Factor
Figures 4.70 to 4.78 show the relationship between the span length and the shear distribution factor, Fv, of selected bridge geometries. To explain the trend, Figure 4.72 is taken here as an example. This figure shows the change in shear distribution factor with increase in span length from 16 to 32 m for a two-lane bridge made of eight girders. It can be observed that Fv changes from 2.74 to 1.97 when increasing bridge span from 16 to 32 m for FLS design, a decrease of 28%. Also, Fv changes from 1.68 to 1.50 when increasing bridge span from 16 to 32 m for ULS and SLS designs, a decrease of 10.7%.

50 

4.3.3 Deflection Distribution Factor
Figures 4.79 through 4.87 depicts the change in deflection distribution factor, Fd, with increase in bridge span length. As an example, Figure 4.86 depicts the change in deflection distribution factor with increase in bridge span a four-lane bridge made of 13 box girders. It can be observed that Fd changes from 1.83 to 1.43 when increasing bridge span from 16 to 32 m, a decrease of 21.9%.

4.4 Effect of Number of Design Lanes
As stated earlier, three different numbers of design lanes were considered in this study, namely, 2, 3 and 4. Bridge width is dependent on the lanes of bridge as given in CHBDC Table 3.1. It should be noted the simplified method of analysis specified in CHBDC provides sets of F and Cf parameters shown in Equation 2.22 for bridges made of one-design lane to more that four-design lanes. This effect directly include the effect of change in bridge width, in addition to change in design lane width implied in the parameter µ in Equation 2.27.

4.4.1 Moment Distribution Factor
Figures 4.88 to 4.95 present the effect of change in number of design lanes on the moment distribution factor of selected bridges. One may observe the general trend of insignificant effect of change in number of design lanes on Fm values at the ULS design as compared to those at FLS design. As an example, Figure 4.95 depicts the change in Fm values with increase in number of design lanes for a 32-m span bridge made of B1000 box girders. It can be observed that Fm changes from 1.09 to 1.45 (an increase of 33%) when changing the
51 

number of design lanes from 2 to 4. While the increase in Fm for ULS was 3.9% (i.e. change from 1.02 to 1.06) when increasing the number of design lanes from 2 to 4.

4.4.2 Shear Distribution Factor
Similar trend for shear distribution factors and the moment distribution factor when studying the effect on number of design lanes as depicted in Figs. 4.96 to 4.103. As an example, Figure 4.103 depicts the change in Fv values with increase in number of design lanes for a 32-m span bridge made of B1000 box girders. It can be observed that Fv changes from 2.10 to 3.77 (an increase of 79.5%) when changing the number of design lanes from 2 to 4. While the increase in Fv for ULS was 9.2% (i.e. change from 1.53 to 1.67) when increasing the number of design lanes from 2 to 4.

4.4.3 Deflection Distribution Factor
Figures 4.104 through 4.111 depicts the change in deflection distribution factor, Fd, with increase in number of design lanes. As an example, Figure 4.111 depicts the change in deflection distribution factor with increase in number of design lanes for 32-m span bridge made of B1000 box girders. It can be observed that Fd changes from 1.07 to 1.41 when increasing the number of design lanes from 2 to 4, an increase of 31.8%.

4. 5 Effect of Girder Spacing
In this study the spacing between the girders is constant 15mm, box girders are placed adjacent to each other. The width of box girder is 1.22m and centre to centre spacing

52 

between the girders is considered 1.235m for all the bridge models. Due to the constant box girder spacing in all the bridges, the effect of girder spacing is not applicable in this study.

4.6 Effect of Load Cases
Few loading cases for CHBDC truck loading were considered in the analysis to obtain the maximum effect of each girder. These loading cases were presented in Chapter III and can be divided into two main groups; namely: bridges with fully loaded lanes and bridges with partially loaded lanes. Tables A.36 to A.123 in Appendix A summarize the values of the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors obtained from the parametric study due to fully loaded lanes and partially loaded lanes. There is no specific trend to reach regarding which type of loading provide the maximum effect on girders. However, the greatest value of the distribution factor for each bridge geometric was considered for further analysis to developed new expressions for designers. It should be noted that the Fm, Fv and Fd determined in this study were the greatest values occurred in all girders. As such, the current study does not differentiate between exterior girder and interior girder as used to be in CHBDC simplified method of analysis.

4.7

Comparison between the Results from the studied Deck-Free

Precast Box-Girder Bridges and CHBDC Simplified Method for I-Girder, Voided Slab and Multi Spine Bridges.
The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code specifies equations for calculating the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors for straight slab-on-girder bridges, voided slab and multi-spine bridges. It should be noted that CHBDC specifies the Fd values for such bridges
53 

can be taken as those for Fm values for simplicity. Figures 4.112 to 4.126 presents correlation between the results from the current study for deck-free precast box girders and those obtained from the CHDBC simplified method for straight slab-on-girder bridges, voided slab and multi-spine bridges. It should be noted that for the sake of obtained load distribution factors for the equations for slab-on-girder bridges, the number girders were considered as the number of boxes in the studied bridges. By inspection of these figures, it can be observed that the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors for the studied deck-free precast box-girder bridges are close to those for multispine and voided slab bridge values. The results obtained based on the CHBDC equations for slab-on-girder bridges are much higher than those obtained from FEA analysis of the deck-free precast box girder bridges. Due to these discrepancies in correlation, it was decided to develop new empirical expressions for the studied bridge geometries to provide bridge engineers and code writers of more economical and reliable simplified method of analysis.

4.8 Development of New Load Distribution Factor Equations
The following general equation of the load distribution factors for moment or deflection specified in CHBDC for the simplified method of analysis was proposed in the current study.

Fm =

SN F 1+

 C    100 
f

(4.1)

Where Fm : is the moment distribution factor, (for deflection distribution factor, use Fd)
54 

S : is the girder spacing in meters, N : is the number of girders, F : is a width dimension factor that characterizes load distribution for a bridge.

 =

We - 3.3 but  1.0 0.6

We : is the width of a design lane in meters, calculated with CHBDC clause 3.8.2; Cf : is a correction factor, in %.

In this study, it was decided to have two sets of empirical equations for moment and deflection for SLS designs since it have been proved from the data generated from the parametric study that the deflection distribution factors were generally less than those for moment distribution factors. This conclusion was observed in Figs. 4.127 to 4.135 for different bridge configurations. In case of shear shear distribution factor the following equation was used:

Fv = S x N / F

(4.2)

Using statistical package for curve fit (Microsoft Excel), the data generated from the parametric study was used to developed new parameters F and Cf for the deck-free precast box girder bridges. A linear function was assumed for both parameters and yielded good accuracy. Tables 4.1 to 4.5 provide summary of these developed parameters in a similar format of CHDBC simplified method of analysis. These equations were developed with a condition that the resulting values underestimates the response by a maximum 5%. To provide confidence on the developed equations, Figs. 4.136 to 4.140 present the correlation

55 

between the FEA results and those resulting from the developed equations at the ULS, SLS2 and FLS designs. The limitations of use of the developed expressions are: 1- Span length ranges from 16 to 32 m. 2- Number of design lanes ranges from 2 to 4. 3- Values of shear distribution factors are per box. So, shear force in the web is considered half the obtained value for the box. 4- Bridges are simply-supported over bearings representing almost line supports. 5- The proposed values are applicable to Classes A and B highways. However, they can conservatively be applied to Classes C and D highways since the difference would be on the applicable factor for multi-presence of vehicles on design lanes and the intensity of the uniformly distributed portion of the lane loading. The latter is considered insignificant since the design of such critical values for moment, shear and deflection are governed by the truck loading conditions rather that the lane loading conditions for such bridge span length.

56 

CHAPTER V
CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
5.1 General
A practical-design-oriented parametric study, using finite element method, was conducted to investigate the static response of simply-supported deck-free precast box-girder bridges. A literature review was provided in order to establish the basis of this study. The influence of few key parameters on the moment, deflection and shear distribution factors for ultimate, serviceability and fatigue limit states designs was investigated using commercially-available finite-element computer program "SAP2000". The key parameters considered in this study included span length, number of design lanes, number of girders, and loading conditions.

5.2 Conclusions
Based on the results from the parametric study, the following conclusions are drawn: 1. Bridge span length, number of girders as related to bridge width and number of design lanes play a significant role on the values of the load distribution factors. 2. Deflection distribution factors are generally smaller than the corresponding moment distribution factors for a typical bridge configuration. 3. Results from the parametric study on deck-free precast box beams showed that they are closer to those for multiple-spine steel box girders and the voided-slab bridges than for slab-on-girder bridges based on CHBDC simplified methods of analysis.
57 

4. The database generated from the parametric study was used to develop empirical expressions for moment, shear and deflection distribution factors at ULS, SLS2 and FLS designs. The proposed expressions can be used with confidence to design new bridges more economically and reliably.

5.3 Recommendations for Future Research
It is recommended that further research efforts be directed towards the following: 1- Extend the proposed empirical equations for bridges with design lanes more that 4 and for continuous spans. 2- Investigate the critical lateral bending moment and vertical shear force that can be used to design the closure strip between precast beams at the top flange locations.
