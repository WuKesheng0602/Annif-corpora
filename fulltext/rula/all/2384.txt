Association of Escherichia coli 0157:H 7 in Floes: Role of Extracellular Polymeric Substances and Fate of Pathogenic Organisms By Mitsuko Kanetani Environmental Applied Science and Management, 2005 Master of Applied Science, Ryerson University ABSTRACT

In North America, Escherichia coli (£ coli) 0157:H7 has been frequently associated with outbreaks of food-borne and water-borne infection. The association of E. coli 0157:H7 to floes is hypothesized to be a potential mechanism of transport and survival in natural environments. This study examines this hypothesis with a focus on the role of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and on E. coli 0157:H7 survival/pathogenicity in an aquatic environment. The floe characterization experiment indicated that EPS play a significant role in floe stability. The EPS distribution experiment revealed abundant hydrophobic protein throughout the floe, which contributes to floe stability and microbial adhesion. In examining survival o f E. coli 0157:H7 in a low nutrient water sample for 10-day incubation, more floeadherent E. coli 0157:H7 survived than the free-living form since EPS provided protection, nutrients and stable sites for survival. Surviving E. coli 0157:H7 exhibited both decreased host adhesion ability and a-actinin accumulation; however, their infection ability was not affected. This suggests that low nutrient levels did not affect pathogenicity over 10 days in this study.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background Over the last several years there has been an inereasing number of waterborne infeetion outbreaks associated with drinking water. These outbreaks were often caused by pathogenic microorganisms, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) 0157:H7 (Nicholls et a l, 2002), In 2000, in the case o f drinking water contamination in Walkerton, Ontario, it was suggested that E. coli 0157:H7 entered the drinking water distribution system tlirough a well. The groundwater was contaminated with agricultural runoff from a nearby farm where cattle manure was spread on the fields (Nicholls et al., 2002, O'Connor, 2002). Recent studies have indicated that E. coli 0157:H7 might persist in environments for extended periods (Artz and Killham, 2002; Ogden et

al., 2001). However, the transport of E. coli 0157:H7 from a source of contamination to a point
o f infection and the survival o f E. co// 0 1 57:H7 in the environment during the transport have not been elucidated in detail as yet. The association and adherence of pathogens, in particular Æ coli 0157:H7, to floes is hypothesized to be a potential mechanism of transport and survival for the pathogens. Microbial adherence to floes and to biofilms is thought to offer many advantages to adhered microorganisms, such as protection against disinfectants and predators, resistance to toxins, and availability o f reserve carbon sources (Schembri et a l, 2003). While the association of pathogens with stationary biofilms (sessile fixed structures) has been intensively studied, the association of pathogens with the more mobile floes has not been investigated to the same extent. Microbial adhesion associated with floes, including microbial-microbial interaction, is thought to occur through the following interactions: van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridging (Jorand et a l, 1998; Liao et a l, 2003; Nielsen et a l, 1996). These interactions are related to physicochemical properties o f floes such as hydrophobicity, surface charge and composition o f extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) within the floes. It has been proposed that proteins are involved in hydrophobic interactions within the EPS matrix (Wingender et a l, 1999). Further, negatively charged amino acids in proteins are also thought to form salt bridges with polyvalent cations such as Ca^^ or Fe^^ in floes (Flemming, 2002; Jorand et al, 1998; Wingender et a l , 1999). Since EPS seem to play an important role in microbial adhesion to floes and floe stability, it is necessary to study the distribution and composition o f EPS in floes in

1

iurther detail. Only a lew studies have been conducted in this area. For example, a mapping of EPS in biofilm has been eonducted, showing the colocalization of proteins and carbohydrates in a biofilm (Lawrence el ai, 2003). In this study, the mapping of EPS in llocs using targeted dyes and confoeal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) reveals macromolecular distributions of EPS, which will assist with understanding the role of EPS in microbial adhesion to floes and floe stability. It is also important to investigate the virulence expression of fioc-adherent E. coli 0157:H7 because virulence gene expression might be altered after pathogens have adhered to floes. Microorganisms are known to obtain and accordingly respond to a wide range of information from their surrounding environment by modulating gene expression for successful adaptation (Decho, 1999). For example, in biofilms, non-pathogenic E. coli in the grovvlh phase Were found to enhance the expression of genes associated with biofilm formation compared to that in planktonic (free-living) fonn (Sehembri ei ai, 2003). Furthermore, the virulence expression o f E. co// 0157:117 in vivo is regulated by the quorum sensing system that allows cells to communicate with each other (Sperandio ef a i, 1999). However, the virulence expression o f E. coli 0157:H7 has not been examined in an environmental sample as yet. The current study was intended to investigate these matters in further detail. Specific objectives of this study were: 1. To examine the relationship between floe properties and EPS. Enzymes such as pronase E or proteinase K were used to digest protein from EPS and the effects on fioc properties were observed; 2. To understand the structure and distribution of EPS macromolecules, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids by mapping EPS in llocs. Lectins were used to differentiate the composition of carbohydrates in the EPS and the stained floes were then viewed by CLSM. Pronase E or proteinase K were also used to observe the underlying structure and distribution of EPS; 3. To study the fate of E. coli 0157:H7 and their survival in water samples. Viable cells were counted by plate count and GFP (green fluorescent protein) labelled E. coli 0157:H7 adhered to floes were observed under CLSM; and 4. To study if E. coli 0157:H7 remain pathogenic after being cultured in a low nutrient condition.

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW This chapter presents a review of the literature regarding the function and properties of llocs/bioiilms. microbial adhesion to llocs and pathogenicity of E. coli 0157:H7. First, the signillcance of floes and biofilms in natural and engineered environments are described. Next, Hoc and biofilm function and physicochemical properties, including those of EPS, are reviewed. This leads to a discussion of microbial adherence in llocs/biofilms, including gene expression of microorganisms in llocs/biofilms. Lastly, the signillcance of E. coli OI57:H7 as a pathogen that can adhere to llocs and biolllms is discussed. In particular, the pathogenicity of E. coli OI57:H7, including, virulence factors, attaching effacing lesions and quorum sensing system, is reviewed. 2.1. Significance of Floes and Biofilms in Natural Environments Bacteria are generally known to exist in the environment as suspended cells or attached cells. Suspended (planktonic or free-living) cells are typically found in environments such as open water in oceans and deep lakes as well as in large-scale industrial Icrmentors (Wolfaardt d

^il-, 1999). Attached cells generally occur adjacent to surfaces in both natural aquatic
environments and technical water systems. Attached bacteria typically occur in aggregated forms such as floes and biofilms (Wingender el a l, 1999; Wolfaardt el a i, 1999). Floes are stable complex aggregates that consist of bioorganic and inorganic material and heterogeneous microorganisms embedded in polymeric networks, known generally as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Liss, 2002; Wilen et ai, 2003). Floes have been also described as individual micro-ecosystems with autonomous and interactive physical, chemical ` 'ind biological functions or behaviours operating within the floe matrix (Droppo ei ah, 1997). Floes are found in natural environments such as freshwater and marine systems. For example, Ireshwater floes form flocculated fine grain sediment in the benthic regions of freshwater environments (Liss, 2002). Floes in natural environments have been studied because they influence the fate of a contaminant that is adsorbed to the floes and dispersed in aquatic environments. Association of floes with contaminants regulates the surrounding water quality by their physical, chemical and/or biological activity (Droppo el a l, 1997). Floes are also found in engineered environments such as activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants and processing equipment. Activated sludge has been intensively examined in the context of seeking ways to

improve wastewater processes such as settling and dewatering processes (Droppo, 2001; Liss, 2002 ). Biolllms are stable complexes of microbial aggregates but, unlike llocs, they are typically sessile structures (Liss, 2002). Biolllms are generally found at liquid-solid interfaces (W olfe/ al., 2002). Biolllms are widely recognised as important structures due to their potential for detrimental impact on human health, industrial processes and drinking water distribution systems. As such, many studies have been conducted on biolllms. For example, biolllms growing on medical devices present a considerable hygiene and infection risk (Meyer, 2003). Biolllms in industries are known to cause biocorrosion of metal and concrete, which reduces the lifetime of industrial equipment and buildings (Videla, 2002). Biolllms in drinking water distribution systems also cause material deterioration, significant energy losses and water quality deterioration (Smith et ai. 2000; Williams el al., 2003; Wolf et a l, 2002). If there is a disinfection failure in a drinking water treatment process, biofilms in drinking water distribution systems might pose a risk of pathogen contamination. In particular, pathogens such as E. coli,

Legionella bozemanii, Mycohactennm smegmatm, and oocysts of Cryptospondium parviim have
been observed to readily colonize preformed biofilms isolated from drinking water systems (Smith et al., 2000). Even though a number of studies have been conducted on biolllms in controlled industrial or public systems, only a.few studies have been reported regarding the association o f pathogens with llocs/biofilms in natural environments. Whitman and Ne vers (2003) pointed out the possibility o f pathogens surviving in biolllms in beach sand. They examined E. coli distribution in sand and beach water along Lake Michigan. E. coli is an indicator organism of sewage contamination, which indicates a possible presence of human pathogens (bacteria, protozoa and viruses) (Whitman and Nevers 2003). This study suggested that beach sand acted as a source o f E. coli and caused beach water contamination because the beach sand seemed to offer advantages to microorganisms by providing a large surface area for biolllm fonnation, where microflora growth was supported by a steady supply of nutrients and gases, protection from lethal sunlight and predation (Whitman and Nevers 2003). The persistence of pathogens in marine waters are also linked to the association of pathogens with floes (Decho, 2000). The increasing salinity results in a substantial increase in cations such as Na^, Ca^^ and Mg^^ when going from freshwater to full seawater. Upon reaching saline water, enhanced floe fonnation and aggregation o f suspended dissolved organic carbon, silts and clays are generally

observed in mosl intertidal systems (Decho. 2000). Similar to biofilms, floes are thought to improve the survival and propagation of'adhered microorganisms. In particular, a few studies have focused on the survival of £  . coU in sediment. Since floes contribute to sediment fonnation, these studies may be useful background to the present study. It was found that the coneentration of E. coli was higher in sediments than that in the overlaying water. Further, E. coli persisted longer when sediment was present, indicating that E. coli was capable of utilizing nutrients adsorbed to sediments (Brettar and Hofle, 1992; Gerba and McLeod, 1976; LaLiberte and Grimes, 1982). E. coli persisting in sediment can also be resuspended in the overlaying water when the sediment was disturbed by boating or recreational activities (An el al., 2002; Decho, 2000). Thus, it seems quite possible that pathogens adhered to floes may persist for extended periods of time and that adhered pathogens might be occasionally transported with floes and then resuspended. It is important to examine pathogen association with floes, with regard to floe properties and pathogen survival and pathogenicity. 2.2. FIoc Surface Properties Floes may play a key role in the pathogen transport and survival in an aquatie environment. It is important to examine properties and functions of floes since these will affect the viability of pathogenic E. coli within floes leading to transport. For example, floe size can have significant implications for pathogen dispersion in an aquatic environment since the larger floes will generally settle out much faster than finer floes, which will likely travel with their associated pathogens much further within water systems (Liss, 2002). The properties and functions of floes are also affected by the properties and functions of EPS that are the major component of floes. In this section, the literature regarding the properties and functions of floes and EPS are discussed. 2.2.1. Surface Charge, Hydrophobicity Surface charge and hydrophobicity are physical properties of floes. Both of these properties appear to influence floe formation as well as other properties of formed floes. Surface charge is considered to be associated with both flocculation and bulking (Jin el al., 2003). The surface charge of floes is generally negative under neutral pH conditions. The negative charge is contributed to by the presence of ionisable groups such as carboxyl, phosphate and amino groups ·n the EPS (Liss, 2002). The negative surface charge is also suggested to affect the stability of

llocs since the negative cliarge on Hoc surfaces may create repulsive electrostatic interactions and prevent close contact. As a result, bonds between Hoc fractions are weak and unstable (.lin et

a l, 2003; Liao et a!., 2001 ; Wilen et al., 2003). blocs are naturally hydrated, due to the presence
o f large numbers of hydroxyl, carboxyl and phosphate groups in EPS, however. Hoc surfaces also possess hydrophobic areas. 1hese hydrophobic areas are contributed to by the presence of side chains in amino acids, the methyl groups in carbohydrates, and the long-chain carbon groups in lipids in EPS (Liss, 2002). Furthermore, in general, bacteria also possess a hydrophobic cell surface. Thus, hydrophobic interactions appear to be involved with Hoc formation and bacterial adherence to floes (Liao et a l, 2001; Olofsson et al. 1998; Zita and Hermansson, 1997a,b). In particular, Olofsson et a l (1998) and Zita and Hermansson et al (1997b) investigated microbial adhesion to activated sludge Hoes. Both studies found that bacteria with a higher cell surface hydrophobicity attached in higher numbers to activated sludge Hoes than lower cell surface hydrophobicity (more hydrophilic) bacteria (Olofsson et a l, 1998; Zita and Hermansson et a l, 1997b). These findings were also supported by the results of an in situ investigation of cell surface hydrophobicity o f free-living, single cells in wastewater, which showed that the majority o f these bacteria possess lower cell surface hydrophobicity (more hydrophilic) (Zita and Hermansson et al, 1997a). The two surface properties, surface charge and hydrophobicity, are also believed to correlate with each other inversely. For example, as negative surface charge increases, the ionisable groups of EPS that contribute to the negative surface charge also increase the polar interactions with water molecules, which resulted in lowering the hydrophobicity (Liao

et a l, 2001). These surface properties, surface charge and hydrophobicity, are also related to the
characteristics of EPS. It has been suggested that EPS possess both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. In particular, .lorand et al ( 1998) found that hydrophobicity was more related to EPS protein than to total EPS content of Hoes. This study showed that the hydrophobic fraction of EPS was made up of only proteins. The proteins contained amino acids with hydrophobic side groups, which seemed to contribute significantly to the hydrophobicity of floes. On the other hand, the hydrophilic fraction of EPS was made up of both proteins and carbohydrates (Jorand et

al., 1998; Liss, 2002). Thus, the ratio of proteins to carbohydrates may be somewhat
representative o f the hydrophobicity of the floes. Liao et al (2001) also found that the proportions of EPS components (proteins/carbohydrates and/or proteins/(carbohydrates+ deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA))) were more important than the quantities of individual EPS

components in controlling hydrophobicity and surface charge for the sludge in laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) (Liao et al., 2001 ). 2.3. Extracellular Polymeric Substances The surface properties of llocs arc closely related to the characteristics of EPS. EPS can be defined as organic polymers of microbial origin that are found outside of the cellular boundaries. In a lloc/biofilm, EPS may be associated with nearby bacterial cell surfaces either loosely or firmly. EPS are formed when polymeric substances are actively secreted by microorganisms, released as a product of cellular lysis or adsorbed from the surrounding medium (Frolund et a!., 1996; Jahn and Nielsen, 1996; Wilen and Lant. 2003; Zhang et al., 1999). EPS form a matrix of extracellular organic material that binds heterogeneous microorganisms and other particulates together to form microbial aggregates (floes/ biolllms) (Wilen and Lant, 2003; Wingender et al., 1999). 2.3.1. General Extraeellular Polymeric Substances Composition EPS are known to include a variety of polymeric materials including neutral and acidic carbohydrates, lipopolysaccharides, protein, nucleic acids, (phospho)lipids, and humic acids as described in Table 1 (Bura et al., 1998; Tsuneda et al., 2003; Wingender et al., 1999). The EPS composition and relative quantities of constituents may vary spatially and temporally depending on microbial community, substrate properties and enzymatic activities such as polymerizing, modifying, and degrading of biological molecules in llocs/biofilms (Sponza, 2003; Wingender et

^fl-, 1999). Numerous environmental factors also affect EPS composition, including high levels
of oxygen, desiccation, low temperatures and nutrients (COD: N: P) (Bura et al., 1998; Ryu and Beuchat, 2004). For example, a limited availability o f nitrogen (N) resulted in reduced amounts of proteins, while a limited availability o f phosphorus (P) increased proteins and carbohydrates (Bura et al., 1998). Wastewater composition also affects the quantities of EPS components. The activated sludge in wastewater from pulp-paper, textile (cotton knit fabrics) and petrochemical industries (containing more complex organics and substrates) generally contained EPS with lower amounts of proteins and higher DNA levels.

Table 1. General composition of microbial EPS (Adapted from W ingender g /»/., 1999) EPS Principal components Substituents Carbohydrates monosaccharides organic: 0-acetyl. ;V-acetyl. suceinyl, pyruvyl uronic acids inorganic; sulfate, phosphate amino sugars Proteins oligosaccharides (glycoprotein), amino acids (Polypeptides) fatty acids (lipoprotein) Nucleic acids nucleotides (Phospho)lipids fatty acids glycerol phosphate ethanolamine serine choline sugars Humic substances phenolic compounds simple sugars amino acids On the other hand, the activated sludge in wastewater from the winery industry and municipal activated sludge (wastewater containing readily biodegradable organics in wastewater) generally contained EPS with a high level of proteins and a low DNA content (Bura el al., 1998; Sponza, 2003). The predominance of proteins in the municipal wastewater/activated sludge was suggested to be due to the large quantities of exoenzymes excreted in the EPS. These exoenzymes may hydrolyse a high amount of bound EPS in floes in the presence of readily biodegradable organics (Nielsen et al., 1996; Sponza. 2003). 2.3.2. Distribution of Extracellular Polymeric Substances in Biofilms Another definition o f EPS indicates that EPS includes all polymers that exist outside the bacterial cell wall and whieh are not directly anchored in the outer membrane/murein-proteinlayer (Nielsen and Jahn, 1999). When EPS are generated and secreted by bacterial cells, EPS are initially found around bacterial cells as capsules, sheaths and slimes. This type of EPS is generally called bound EPS (Nielsen and Jahn, 1999). Capsules ("integral capsules") are firmly associated with the cell surface as discrete structures with distinct outlines. Capsular polymers are attached to the cell surface by noncovalent interaetions, but may also be covalently bound to phospholipid or lipid-A-molecules at the cell surface. Sheaths are found around filamentous bacteria, such as certain cyanobacteria or bacteria of the genera Leptothrix and Sphaerotilus, as

linear EPS-containing structures surrounding chains of cells and are analogous to capsules in nonfilamentous organisms (Wingender et al, 1999). On the other hand, slime is a loose binding to the cell surface and this type of EPS can be shed into the surrounding environment as a less organized slime (Wingender et al, 1999; Nielsen and Jahn, 1999). EPS may also exist in a dissolved state. This type of EPS is called soluble EPS. Soluble EPS include soluble macromolecules and colloids (Nielsen and Jahn, 1999). As more EPS are formed, more EPS accumulate around and between cells to form an EPS matrix in a biofilm. At this stage, one o f the major EPS components, carbohydrates, are generally distributed not only around the bacterial cells but within cell-free areas in the biofilm (Nielsen and Jahn, 1999; Strathmann et al., 2002; Wolfaardt et a l, 1999). The distribution of EPS components has been studied mainly with regard to carbohydrates. Strathmann et al (2002) observ ed that bound EPS associated with bacterial cell surfaces in a biolllm predominantly contained A^-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and A-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc), based on staining with lectin Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). On the other hand, EPS in cell-free regions contained a-D-glucose (Glc) and a -D-mannose (Man), based on staining with the lectin Concanavalin A (ConA). ConA produced cloud-like regions that were heterogeneously distributed within the biofilm and were separated by dark areas. It was suggested that the unstained areas in the biofilms be due to water-filled pores and/or EPS that did not bind the lectin (Strathmann et a l, 2002). Lawrence et al (2003) also demonstrated a way to map the distribution of EPS macromolecular subcomponents of biofilm cells and matrices using CLSM. In this experiment, staining with nucleic acid-, protein-, lipophilic, and glycoconjugate-specific fiuorescent probes revealed localization and colocalization of these biomolecules within the cells nnd matrix o f the biofilm. As well as these biomolecules, Jorand et al (1998) suggested the presence o f glycoproteins in the EPS matrix (Jorand et a l, 1998). When the CLSM probes noted above were used in combination with glycoconjugate-specific lectins such as those from Datura

·''tfamonium or Sambucus nigra with an affinity for GlcNAc - and A^-acetyl-D-galactosamine
(GalNAc) -rich regions, respectively, the presence of nucleic acid-, protein-, or lipid-enriched regions associated with carbohydrates could be detected (Lawrence et al, 2003). Furthermore, Higgins and Novak (1997) observed that the addition of pronase E (200 activity unit) to an activated sludge sample resulted in a release of bound carbohydrates and reduction o f fioc size. This was understood to indicate that the proteins and carbohydrates are

10

linked like lectins within the biopolymer network. This finding suggested the mechanism of protein-carbohydrate interaction on forming and stabilizing of the EPS matrix (Higgins and Novak 1997). 2.3.3. Properties of Extracellular Polymeric Substances EPS composition is directly related to EPS properties. The most important properties of EPS are adhesion, sorption, mechanical stability, cohesion of bacterial aggregates and diffusion. Since EPS are typically major components within flocs/biofilms, the physical properties of EPS are also closely related to the properties of llocs/biofilms. The EPS property o f adhesion to abiotic surfaces is a prerequisite for initial and on-going biofilm growth. The extracellular surface-active polymers with lipidic components in the EPS are involved in the interaction between bacteria and surfaces (Wingender et al., 1999). Once a biofilm is formed, the sorption property o f the EPS accumulates nutrients, retains water and protects against desiccation (Flemming, 2002). During growth, the EPS form a three-dimensional network (EPS matrix) to provide mechanical stability and cohesion of bacterial aggregates. In fonriing the EPS matrix, the following main forces are thought to be working: van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, salt bridging and protein-carbohydrate interaction (Jorand et al. 1998; Higgins and Novak, 1997: Nielsen et a l, 1996; Wilen and Lant, 2003). Derjaugin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) theor>' suggests that interactions between the lloc/biofilm components are stabilized when van der Waals forces and the electrostatic repulsive forces that are caused by interpenetration of electrical double layers are added together (Jorand et a l, 1998; Zita and Hermansson, 1994). Hydrophobic interactions between EPS and bacterial cells are also important for Hoc stability. Since the enzyme, pronase E digested proteins and disrupted hydrophobic interactions, fioc dissociation occurred (Endo et a l, 1976; Flemming, 2002; Higgins and Novak, 1997; Wingender et a l, 1999). Further, salt bridges are thought to be formed by negatively charged EPS and/or by polyvalent cations such as Ca^^ or Fe^^ from nutrients (Flemming, 2002; Liao et a l, 2002). In particular, Ca^^ has been suggested to play an important role based on the observation that addition of Ca^^ led to refiocculation of activated sludge (Zita and Hermansson, 1994). An increase in divalent cations (Ca^^, Mg^^) also improved protein binding within the EPS matrix. This might be because salt bridges were formed with a relatively high content o f negatively charged amino acids in the protein (Higgins and Novak, 1997;

11

Wingender et a i. 1999). Removal of salt bridging has been used in many studies, including EPS extraction experiments. It was found that the use of cation exchange resin (CER) and ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) released liumic substances, protein and carbohydrates from Hoes into bulk water. The release of EPS was likely to occur because the displacement of Ca^^ with N'*' in activated sludge llocs would reduce binding of biopolymers within the Hoc (Brown and Lester, 1980; Higgins and Novak, 1997; Keiding and Neilsen, 1997; Zhang ct ai, 1999). In addition, EDTA was used to measure a floe stability (a dissociation constant) (see more detailed description below) (Endo et ai, 1976; Liao et ai, 2002). The diffusion property relates to the phenomenon that diffusion through the cell-EPS matrix of biofilms occurs generally at a slower rate than through water. This reduced rate of diffusion potentially reduces rates of nutrient and oxygen delivery to cells and may also cause the accumulation of inhibitory waste products. The diffusion property and/or the presence of charged reactive groups in EPS might also allow the maintenance of a more favourable microenvironment in an otherwise hostile environment (Wolfaardt e/ a i, 1999). 2.3.4. Functions of Extracellular Polymeric Substances EPS properties are also related to EPS function. In this section, some important EPS functions such as adhesion phenomena, matrix structure formation, supply nutrients, protection effect, and microbial physiological processes are reviewed (Tsuneda et ai, 2003; Wingender et

`li, 1999; Wolfaardt et al., 1999). EPS are important mediators in bacterial adhesion to surfaces.
Capsular EPS are thought to be involved in the initial stage of attachment when attractive interactions take place between polymers already present on the bacterial cell surface and the attachment surface (Wolfaardt et ai, 1999). Following bacterial aggregation, EPS are also involved in maintaining the structural integrity of floc/biofllms by forming a gel-like 3D network, which leads to a stable biofilm community. Attached microbial cells and microcolonies have been observed to be present in enmeshed fibrous polysaccharides structures (Wolfaardt et

^l; 1999). The function of EPS in maintaining structural integrity may also lead to
deflocculation, which is the collapse of floe or biofilm structure. EPS hydrolysis and deflocculation as well as inhibition of EPS production occur when bacteria in floe/ biofilm are exposed to anaerobic conditions too long. Deflocculation is frequently observed in thick biofilms where oxygen is consumed by aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria at the outer layers

12

resulting in the creation oI'areas with anaerobic conditions inside the bioilim (Jin ct a/., 2003; Nielsen et a i. 1996; Wolfaardt et a i. 1999). Fonning a stable bacterial aggregates also leads to establishing favourable microenvironments. EPS are believed to function to promote spatial organization of cells. For example, microcolony formation allows bacterial cell-cell recognition and interactions between bacterial cells in these close associations (Wolfaardt ct a!., 1999). It is important to interact among different bacteria (consortial activities) since llocs/ biofilms are generally a heterogeneous community. Consortial activities involve maximizing bacterial metabolic capabilities through co-operative interactions between two or more populations sharing a mutual habitat such tliat individual members interact to optimize nutrient utilization and waste cycling. Through these interactions the individual cells contribute to the overall maintenance of population or community integrity and stability and thereby their own survival (Wolfaardt e / «/., 1999). In creating favourable microenvironments, EPS are also suggested to function as a protective barrier on organisms in flocs/biofilms against adverse abiotic and biotic influences from the environment, such as extreme pH values, elevated temperature, drying, freezing, biocides, heavy metal ions (C u"\ Pb^^ and Cr^^) and detergents (Wolfaardt ct a i, 1999). As an example, it has frequently been observed that biofilm cells can tolerate significantly higher concentrations of certain biocides including disinfectants and antibiotics than planktonic populations. This is understood to be due mainly to physiological changes o f biofilm bacteria enhancing their resistance to biocides. Some cells deeply embedded in a biofilm alter its physiology since they receive less oxygen and nutrients, so that the buried cells become more resistant to the uptake o f toxic agents and antibiotics (Bower and Daeschel, 1999; Smith ct a i, 2000; Williams ct a i, 2003; Wolf ct a i,
2 0 0 2 ).

Furthermore, it is also assumed that barrier

function o f the EPS matrix (and in particular, the extracellular carbohydrates) prevents biocides or host defence mechanisms from reaching target bacteria within the biofilm by hindering diffusion and inactivating reactions with biocides (Bower and Daeschel, 1999; Davey and O'toole, 2000; Flemming, 2002; Samrakandi ct a i, 1997; Soda et a i, 1999; Wolf et ai, 2002). The function o f EPS in providing bacteria in flocs/biofilms with nutrients has not been clarified yet. Some studies have indicated that EPS generally do not serve as reserve sources of carbon and energy. Other studies have shown that there appear to be at least two ways in which EPS may function as a food reservoir: (i) Production of EPS as nutrient reserve and (ii) Accumulation

13

o f nutrients by EPS (Wolfaardt el a/., 1999). Nevertheless, it was observed that river biofilms were remarkably resilient to depletion of organie matter from the overlying waters, suggesting lhat a store o f energy existed within the biolllm that was able to supplement exogenous sources during periods of searcity (Williams et al.. 2003: Wolfaardt et al., 1999). EPS protein, enzymes in floe/ biolllm also have an important function in obtaining nutrients from the environment. Exoenzymes released by bacteria into their external environment were generally adsorbed in EPS in floe/ biolllm. These adsorbed enzymes digest exogenous macromolecules and particulate material in the microenvironment and provide low-molecular weight nutrients, which can readily been taken up and metabolized by the bacterial cells (Wolfaardt et al., 1999). Furthermore, these adsorbed enzymes may also be involved in the degradation o f carbohydrate EPS allowing the release of biolllm bacteria and the spreading of the bacteria to new environments (Wingender et

al., 1999; Wolfaardt et al., 1999).
Several of the functions o f EPS are summarized in the Table 2. Tabic 2.

2.4.. Bacterial Adherence in Biofilms/FIocs Pathogen association with floes thought to be deeply related to mierobial adhesion to floes and floe and EPS properties. However, microbial adhesion and iloe properties have generally only been examined during floe formation in the eontext of seeking ways to improve wastewater processes. The mechanism o f microbial adhesion onto established (preformed) fioes has been examined only a limited number of studies. In one study, Olofsson e! al. (1998) reported that hydrophobie interaction is involved in microbial adhesion onto prefonned llocs. They examined adhesion o f hydrophilie and hydrophobie microbial cells onto sludge llocs and found the correlation between mierobial cell surfaee hydrophobicity and the numbers of adherent cells to floes (Olofsson el al., 1998). Furthermore, adherent hydrophobic bacterial cells in floes were more widely dispersed on the surfaee of the floe and in the interior of the floe whereas hydrophilie microbial cells were found on the surfaee (Olofsson et ai, 1998). Other studies have been foeused on the surfaee features of fioes and mieroorganisms, sueh as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), flagella, fimbriae and pili and their involvement in microbial adhesion (Bura et al., 1998; Park et al., 2000). As an example, Park et al. (2000) examined the involvement o f filamentous cell appendages in mierobial adhesion. When an activated sludge sample was treated with either pronase E or carbohydrate-oxidizing agent, some bacteria were released from the activated sludge fioes due to the loss of extracellular filamentous cell

15

appendages. Consequently, adhesion ability of these released bacteria surface was affected signillcantly (Park el al, 2003). This result might indicate that EPS proteins and carbohydrates may be important in microbial adhesion. Interestingly, another study focused on the cell appendages of Myxococcus xantluis (M. xanthiis) and microbial adhesion (Behmlander and Dworkin, 1994). M xantlnis produces large amounts of extracellular material, which is in the form of extracellular matrix fibrils. It has been proposed that the fibrils are the mediators of the cell-cell cohesion in M. xanthus, which form the basis for the social and developmental lifestyle of this organism (Behmlander and Dworkin, 1994). In order to study the biochemical interaction and structure of extracellular matrix fibrils, fibrils isolated from M xanthus were treated with pronase E or periodic acid to digest carbohydrates. Removal of the proteins caused no detectable change in the fibrils structure, however, digestion of the carbohydrates resulted in dissolution of fibrils structure (Behmlander and Dworkin, 1994). This result indicated that the proteins were not involved in the maintenance of fibrillar structure. Furthenuore, it suggested that the fibrils structure consist of a carbohydrate backbone coated with associated protein (Behmlander and Dworkin, 1994). The possible fibrils structure might serve as a clue for EPS fibrillar structure. 2.4.1. Gene Expression of Bacteria in Biofilms/Flocs Bacteria sense their surrounding environmental conditions and adapt to the environment by morphological and physiological changes such as respiration rate and reproduction ability. These changes are thought to give the bacteria an optimum strategy to protect themselves against environmental stresses. The environmental stresses include temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, some inhibitors and starv'ation (Ozkanca and Flint, 1997). For example, starvation triggers changes in the expression of outer membrane proteins (OMPs). OMPs are related to stabilization of membrane, retaining cell shape and membrane transport. The changes in OMPs expression lead to a smaller and more rounded appearance of E. coli (Ozkanca and Flint, 2002; Wang and Doyle, 1998). Microbial adhesion in floes/ biofilms causes bacteria to change in expression of certain genes. Schembri et al. (2003) observed significant gene expression changes in E. coli K12

(non-pathogenic strain) between growth phase in biofilm and that in planktonic form and

between planktonic growth phases, the exponential and stationary growth phases (Schembri et 2003). Highly expressed genes in biofilms were associated with cell structure such asfnnA encoding type 1 fimbriae and flu encoding Ag43. The type 1 fimbriae and Ag43 are known to be

16

involved with initial attachment process and autoaggregation, respectively, which enhances biolllm formation (Schembri et al., 2003). Furthermore, the expression of rpoS-regulated genes was also altered in biofilms. The rpoS-encoded sigma factor cr controls the expression of genes in £ coli in cellular responses to a range of stresses including starvation, osmotic stress, acid shock, cold shock, heat shock, oxidative DNA damage and transition to stationary phase. Since oxygen and nutrient starvation are typically occur in the interior regions of biofilms, the rjDoSregulated genes are important for E. coli to survive in biofilms, otherwise E. coli biolllm growth would be dramatically impaired (Schembri ct al., 2003). Based on the literature searching done to date, it appear^ that the virulence expression of

E. coli 0157:H7 that are/have been adhered to floes has not been studied yet. It is important to
investigate whether the virulence expression of adherent E. coli 0157:117 to floes remains since this will impact the importance o f floes and it might also be useful in developing a better understanding of the mechanism o f virulence gene expression in this pathogen. 2.5. Significance of Æ^c/imc/zm co//0157:H 7 In North America, E. coli 0157:H7 has been frequently associated with outbreaks of food-borne and water-borne diarrhea, which can result in hemorrhagic colitis and/or the lifethreatening haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (Li et al., 2000). It has been found that the infectious dose of E. coli 0157:H7 is as low as 50 organisms (Kuntz and Kunts. 1999; Rice, 1999; Tilden et al., 1996). In addition to the low infectious dose, other factors also enhance the risk of infection. First, the increase in pathogenic E. coU contamination may be associated with an increase in the spectrum of animal reser\'oirs. Stx-producing E. coli, including E. coli 0157:H7, has been found to have originated not only from cows, but also a number of animal species including sheep, goats, deer, pigs, poultry, cats, dogs and wild birds (Burnett et ai, 2000; Ceponis et a i, 2005; Kaper, 1998; Nielsen and Scheutz,
2 0 0 2 ).

It was reported that seagull

droppings are attributed to E. coli 0157:H7 contamination at urban landfills and in intertidal sediments (Kaper, 1998; Wallance et a i, 1997). Second, E. coli 0157:H7 might persist in natural environments for the extended periods of time. Recent studies showed that the viability of E. coli 0157:H 7 was affected by predation, competition, bacterial inhibitors, temperature and level of nutrients, similar to non-pathogenic E. coli. E. coli 0157:H7 persisted longer at lower temperatures and nutrient levels but did not survive as long in the presence of predation and

17

competition (Allen ct a i, 2001 ; Arts and Killham, 2002; Ogden ct ai, 2001 ; Wang and Doyle, 1998). It was reported that some E. coli 0157:117 was able to produce EPS and form biofilms, 'vhich are linked to its protection from environmental stresses (Ryu and Beuchat, 2004). Third, transmission routes of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) including E. coli 0157:H7 are increasing. Initially, transmission o f E. coli 0157:117 was associated with consumption of beef products and contaminated water and person-to-person transmission. Later, the consumption of uncooked vegetables and fruits such as lettuce and apple juice were also recognised as a transmission route (Burnett ct ai, 2000; Rice, 1999; Wachtel ct a i, 2002). These vegetables and Iruits are likely contaminated by animal feces during growth or processing (Besser et ai, 1999; CDC, 1997; Kaper, 1998). It has been demonstrated that E. coli 0157:H7 can infiltrate the core of an intact fruit (apple) as well as a punctured fruit, which makes it difficult to eliminate these pathogens. 2.6. Pathogenesis Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli

2.6.1. Adhesion

E. coli 0157:117 belongs to a group of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) within a
group of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) (Johson-Henry ct ai, 2001). The first step in EHEC pathogenesis is the colonization of the intestinal mucosal surface, however, the niechanisms underlying the adherence of EHEC to epithelial cells is still only partly understood (Tarr ct a i,
2 0 0 0 ).

It has been suggested that E. coli 0157 adhesion is stimulated by conditions

such as those in the large bowel, the presumed site of infection (Law, 2000). The ability to adhere to epithelial cells is an important virulence trait, because adherence presumably enables EllEC to deliver toxins efficiently to host organs, overcome peristaltic resistance and gain access to host derived nutrients (Tarr ct a i, 2000). The fimbriae and outer membrane protein (OMP) have been identified as possible EHEC adhesins (Law, 2000). For example, E. coli 0157:H7 possesses an adherence-conferring protein, lha, which confers the capacity to adhere to epithelial cells in a diffuse pattern rather than discretely localized adherence, lha is encoded by a chromosomal gene, iha, coding for a protein similar to the IrgA (iron-regulated gene A) protein of Vibrio cholerae (Tarr et ai,
2 0 0 0 ).

Many studies have also been conducted on intimin as a

potential adhesin involved in both initial attaclunent and intimate attachment. Intimin was found

18

to be critical for intimate attachment o rn i lF-C to the enterocyte. causing A/E lesions (Allen et

a l, 2001 : Law. 2000; Nicholls. 2002: Rice. 1999; Tarr et a l. 2000).
2.6.2. Virulence Factors Most important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of disease clue to EHEC is Shiga toxin (Stx). EHEC produces Shiga toxins (Stxl and Stx2) that are cytotoxic to human renal endothelial cells. The typical renal histopathology consists o f swollen glomerular endothelial cells and deposition of platelets and fibrin within the glomeruli. The decreased glomerular filtration rate can lead to the acute renal failure seen with HUS (Kaper, 1998). EHEC also produces several effector molecules that subvert cellular processes and contribute to disease. These effectors modulate host cell pathways to promote bacterial survival and replication within the host. In addition, the majority o f£ . coli 0157 isolates possess a large 60-MDa plasmid designated p0157 however, the role of this plasmid in pathogenesis is not certain (Kaper, 1998; Law, 2000; Sperandio et a l. 1999). Infections caused by EHEC result in histopathology called attaching and effacing (A/E). A/E lesions are characterized by effacement o f intestinal microvilli, followed by intimate association o f bacteria to host cells and pedestal structure formation containing high concentration of actin and intermediate filaments directly beneath the adherent bacteria. A/E lesion fonnation correlates with severity of infection in the host since a loss in absorptive intestinal surfaces may result in ionic imbalance and diarrhea production, however, its exact role in disease is unknown (Jarvis and Kaper, 1996). The genes required for the formation o f A/E lesions are clustered together in a single chromosomal pathogenicity island known as the locus for enterocyte effacement called the LEE encodes all o f the known virulence factors necessary for A/E lesions. These genes are organized into three major regions with known functions. The middle region contains the genes eae encoding intimin, an outer membrane protein required for intimate attachment and Tir encoding the protein translocated intimin receptor (Tir). Upstream of eae and Tir are genes encoding the type III secretion system (TTSS). The third major region of the LEE, located downstream of eae, encodes several translocated effector proteins (Acheson, et a l, 1998; Law, 2000; Rice, 1999). TTSS spans both inner and outer bacterial membranes and upon contact with host cells, which has been described as a `molecular syringe' TTSS is dependent on the E. coli secreted proteins EspA, EspB and EspD, which are proposed to form TTSS transiocon. The EspA forms

19

filamentous structures on the bacterial surface bridging to the host celis's surface. (Law, 2000; Li

cl al., 2000). These structures facilitate translocation of effector molecules such as EspB and Tir.
The EspB is delivered primarily into the host cell membrane, where it becomes an integral membrane protein. EspB along with EspD probably forms a pore structure through which other bacteria ef fectors, such as Tir, gain access to the host cell (Law, 2000). 2.6.3. Attaching and Effacing Lesions The Tir is translocated into host cells via TTSS where it forms a hairpin structure in the host cell plasma membrane with two transmembrane domains, an extracellular loop and aminoand carboxy-terminal domains that are exposed to the host cell cytoplasm. The extracellular loop of Tir interacts directly with the bacterial outer membrane protein intimin, thus anchoring the bacteria tightly to the host cell. The cytoplasmically exposed domains of Tir bind host cytoskeletal and signalling proteins and initiate A/E lesion. This results in disassembly of microvilli in infected cells and the formation o f the characteristic actin pedestal structures underneath adherent bacteria (Gruenheid el al., 2004). The mechanism o f pedestal formation of EHEC has been studied but is not well understood yet. On the other hand, the mechanism of pedestal formation of enteropathogenic E.

coli (EPEC) is better understood and this mechanism can be examined to assist in understanding
the mechanism of pedestal formation of EHEC. EPEC is a major cause of non bloody diarrhea in infants. A crucial difference between EPEC and EHEC is that the former do not produce Shiga toxin (Kaper, 1998). Following initial adherence to the epithelial cells, EPEC insert virulence factors (effector molecules) via TTSS for intimate attachment into host cells. EPEC Tir is tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylated upon insertion into the host cell membrane, and phosphorylation of tyrosine 474 is required for pedestal formation. Pedestal structure formation requires the recruitment o f neural-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), which is recruited to the pedestal in a Tir tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. N-WASP functions to target the actin-related protein 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) complex to Tir, which is required for pedestal elongation. Both N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex are essential for pedestal formation. Other cytoskeletal proteins recruited are a-actinin, ezrin, cortactin, talin, fimbrin, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and villin (Goosney el al, 2001). a-Actinin has recently been shown to

20

bind Tir directly at its N terminus independently of Tir phosphorylation and may function to link Tir directly to the actin cytoskeleton. Additionally, the amino-terminus of EPEC Tir binds directly to the host actin binding and cross-linking protein a-actinin anchoring Tir to the host actin cytoskeleton. The focal adhesion proteins talin and vinculin have also been shown to interact directly with Tir (Devinney e/r//., 2001). Considerably less is understood about the mechanism of A/E lesion fomiation by EHEC. Unlike EPEC Tir, EHEC Tir is phosphorylated on serine or threonine but not on tyrosine, however, the role o f these phosphoprylation events is still unknown. EHEC seem to have additional bacterial factors delivered to the host cell (Devinney cl al.. 2001). With regard to the pedestal structure formation, a-actinin, actin, N-WASP and the Arp 2/3 complex are recruited to the EHEC pedestal (Goosney el a!., 2001). Despite the differences in the additional bacterial factors and Tir phosphorylation, EHEC forms seemingly identical pedestal structures with the host cell (Devinney el a!., 2001). a-Actinin also forms tight profiles associated with EHEC (Finlay el al., 1992). Detection methods using fluorescence microscopy or CLSM is efficient since it allows for scanning a large number of infected host cells for evidence of changes in the cytoskeleton following bacterial infection (Johnson-Henry el a i, 2001; Yamamoto el a l, 1994). A/E lesion also associated with the cellular changes including an increase in levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and intracellular free calcium (Dytoc el a i, 1994; Goosney el a/., 2001; Kaper, 1998). 2.6.4. Quorum Sensing Systems Quorum sensing is a mechanism of cell-to cell signalling via the production of compounds known as autoinducers that allow a bacterium to '`sense'' its own population as well as the population of other bacteria in a given environment (Sperandio el ai, 1999). The quorum sensing systems in E. coli 0157:H7 regulates the expression o f virulenee factors such as the TTSS, the Tir and intimin in vivo (Sperandio el a i, 1999). It has been proposed that the EHEC TTSS is activated by autoinducers synthesized by normal flora E. coli resident in the large intestine. The presence of autoinducers in the large intestine could activate the EHEC LEE genes, thereby allowing intestinal colonization mediated by intimin to proceed (Sperandio el a i, 1999). However, it has not been studied if the expression of virulence factors for E. coli 0157:H 7 isolated from environments is affected.

CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 3.1. Experimental Approach This chapter contains experimental protocols, including descriptions of the experimental conditions, equipment and chemicals used. It contains three major parts. The first part describes the analysis of Hoc characterization. This first part discusses the source of llocs, physical analyses of floes, extraction of EPS and chemical analyses of EPS. The physical analyses of floes conducted are surface charge, hydrophobicity and dissociation constant. Since EPS are an important part of floes, EPS was extracted and subject to chemical analyses. The chemical analyses of the EPS conducted are carbohydrate, protein, humic acids and DNA analyses. The second part o f the chapter describes the microscopic observation techniques used, beginning with the settings used for conventional optical microscopy (COM) and CLSM. This part also describes the EPS mapping protocol, including the various dyes used. The last part of this chapter describes the analysis o ïE. coli 0 1 57:H7 association with llocs. It begins with a description of culture conditions and inoculation of the E. coli 0157:1-17 strain, continues with the methods used for enumeration of the viable cells and microscopic observation of £. coli 0157:H7 adhered to floes, and lastly, describes immunofluorescence detection o f a-actinin assay. 3.2. Source of FIocs It was initially planned that floes would be sampled from a Toronto municipal wastewater plant, however, due to difficulties in obtaining and keeping fresh samples, it was decided to use a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR). All experiments were conducted on floes obtained from the SBR. The SBR was seeded with activated sludge from a Ptilp and paper mill wastewater treatment plant and then fed with pulp and paper mill wastewater as described in the following table. The SBR system was operated at pH 8-10 and room temperature with a cycle of: aeration and mixing state for 47 hours, settling for 40 minutes, discharging for
10

minutes.

In some experiments, the obtained floe samples were treated with enzymes pronase E and proteinase K in order to examine the effect o f protein removal on the stability o f floes and EPS Composition/distribution.

In particular, Endo et al (1976) found that the concentration of DNA (an indicator of the amount of cell lysis) in the enzyme-treated sample was same as that in the control floes sample. Pronase E is a non-specific enzyme that hydrolyses proteins at a number of cleavage sites (Higgins and Novak, 1997). It has been used on an activated sludge sample and fioes formed by Hoc forming bacteria (Endo, et a l, 1976; Higgins and Novak. 1997). Proteinase K is a serine endopeptidase, which is able to hydrolyse native proteins rapidly. It has been used mostly in molecular biology (Rao e/a/., 1998). The fioc samples were washed three times in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH7.4) by settling for 30 min, removing supernatant and resuspending in PBS. After washing the fioc samples, one of the enzymes 200 pg/ml pronase E (Sigma-Aldrich Canada, Ltd. Oakville, ON) or 200 pg/ml proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the fioc sample and incubated for 2 h at 37 "C and 150 rpm (Higgins and Novak, 1997). Two control samples (i.e. fioc samples without addition of enzyme and PBS with addition of enzyme) were also prepared (Yi. Z.. personal communication). These control samples were incubated in the same manner. After incubation, all samples were examined to characterize fioes and EPS. 3.3. Characterization of FIocs & Extracellular Polymeric Substances The physical characteristics o f fioes and the chemical characteristics o f EPS were examined. The chemical analyses included EPS composition analyses and EPS mapping. 3.3.1. Physical Analysis of FIocs The physical analyses performed included an examination o f surface charge, hydrophobicity and the dissociation constant.

23

3.3.1.1. Hydrophobicity The hydrophobicity of enzyme treated ilocs and control samples was measured by the microbial adherence to hydrocarbons (MATH) method (Wilén el al., 2003). The Hoc samples were washed in deionized distilled water twice by centrifuging at 3000 x g for 5 min. Each Hoc sample were homogenised by using a blender for 1 min. The homogenized sample was diluted in deionized distilled water to absorbance of 1.5 ± 0.2 (lo) at 400 nm. A 10 ml of the diluted floe sample was mixed with 1.0 ml hexadecane (Sigma) and vortexed for 2 min and then transferred to a separatory funnel. After 10 min, when the hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases had separated completely, the aqueous phase was collected and absorbance was measured at 400 nm (I)
'It I k '-' 

(Spectronic® 2 0 ^, Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY, USA). The relative hydrophobicity of each o f the samples was calculated using the following equation Eqs 1: % Hydrophobicity =
( I n - 1 ) 100

"lo (I) Where Iq is the initial absorbance (= 1 .5 ± 0 .2 ) and I is the absorbance of the aqueous phase. 3.3.1.2. Surface Charge The surface charge of the enzyme treated floes and control samples was measured by colloidal titration (Morgan, el a!., 1990). Polybrene and polyanetholsulfonic acid (PAS) were used as the standard cationic and anionic colloids with the indicator toluidine blue. The floe samples were washed in pH 7.0 deionized distilled water twice by centrifuging at 3000 x g for 5 uiin prior to titration. Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) of each floe sample was measured according to Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). A 2 ml floe sample was diluted in 40ml pH 7.0 deionized distilled water, mixed with 4.0 ml of excess 0.001 N polybrene and then titrated against 0.001 N PAS. Electrical neutrality was reached when the colour of a sample changed from blue to violet pink. An equal volume of the blank solution was prepared by replacing a 2 ml floe sample with pH 7.0 deionised distilled water. The blank solution was also titrated against PAS. The surface charge for each sample was calculated using the following equation Eqs 2: x N x 1000 2 X MLSS (2) Where Vo is the volume o f PAS added to blank, V is the volume of PAS added to floe sample, N

3.3.1.3. Floe Stability/Dissociation Constant Floe stability is characterized by the dissociation constant (Zita and Hermansson, 1994; Liao et al, 2002). The dissociation constant is defined as unit absorbance/gram of biomass/washing, which is generally proportional to the number o f fine particles or the mass of fine particles removed from larger llocs per washing and per gram of biomass (Liao et al., 2002). EDTA is known to cause dissociation of fioes and was used in the determination o f the dissociation constant. First, a 15ml fioc sample was allowed to settle for 30 min. Following settling, the supernatant was removed and the biomass was then resuspended in O.IM PBS (pH7.4). This step was conducted to remove fine particles and was repeated three times. After removing the fine particles, a washing procedure was started. The settled biomass (containing larger fioes) was rcsuspended in 30 ml o f 1000 pg/ml EDTA or 0.1 M PBS (control) (called the diluted fioc sample). The diluted fioc samples were then gently mixed in a shaker at a speed of 150 rpm for 15 min. The diluted fioc samples were then allowed to stand for another 15 min. A 5 ml supernatant was taken out in duplicate and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 420 nm (Spectronic^ 20^, Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY, USA). Once the first washing procedure was completed, the diluted fioc sample was next resuspended with a
10

ml fresh

EDTA or PBS solution and the next washing was performed. In total, 4 or 5 washings were performed (Liao et a l, 2002). Washing was terminated when the absorbance did not increase from the previous washing. A graph of accumulated absorbance in sequential washing versus the number of sequential washings was created to obtain the dissociation constant from the linear slope (standard linear regression) of the graph (Zita and Hermansson, 1994; Liao et al, 2002).

Microscopic studies After the last washing was conducted, 50 pi of the fioc sample was used for a wet mount slide. The fioc structure and size were observed under COM with phase contrast at 100 x magnification (please refer to COM section below). Protein Digestion

After the last EDTA washing was conducted, the enzyme treatment was prepared. First, the fioc samples were resuspended in PBS and allowed to settle for 30 min. After settling, the

25

supernatant was removed. This procedure from the resuspension of PBS to supernatant removal was repeated three times. The Hoc sample was then further resuspended in PBS and 200 pg/ml of un enzyme (pronase E or proteinase K) was added to the Hoc sample and incubated for 2 h at 37 "C (please refer to floe source section). After incubation, the floe structure and size were observed (please refer to microscopical studies). The maximum dimension across a floe was measured. Each floe was categorized as small (< 150 pm), medium (150 pm-500 pm) or large size (> 500 pm) according to the manual on the cause and control of floe bulking and foaming (Jenkins, 1993). 3.3.2. EPS Extraction Two types o f EPS, loosely bound EPS fraction and bound EPS fraction were extracted from the enzyme treated floe samples and the control sample. 3.3.2.1. Extraction of Loosely Bound EPS Fraction Easily removed loosely bound EPS was collected by centrifugation. The floe samples Were eentrifuged at 200 rpm for 2 min. The loosely bound EPS present in the supernatant was stored at -- 20 "C for later EPS composition analyses. The remaining floe was subject to further extraction of bound EPS (Higgins and Novak, 1997). 3.3.2.2. Extraction of Bound EPS Fraction Bound EPS fraction was extracted by a cation exchange resin (CER) method (Frolund et "/·» 1996; Liao et al, 2001). This extraction procedure is based on the method by Frolund et a l, (1996). A floe sample was washed three times with extraetion buffer (2 mM Na^PO^. 4 mM NUH2PO4, 9 mM NaCl and 1 mM KCl at pH 7 ) by centrifugation for 15 min at 1,000 x g. The amount o f CER (DOWEX® HCR-W2 Cation Exchange Resin in the sodium form, Supelco, PA, fJSA) was calculated as 80g of resin per gram of washed MLSS and added to the floe. The floe sample with CER was then stirred at 600 rpm for 2 hours at 4 "C. The extracted EPS were han'estcd by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 x g. After centrifugation, the bound EPS fraction present in the supernatant was stored at -20 "C for later EPS composition analyses. Prior to the EPS composition analyses, all EPS samples (loosely bound and bound EPS) Were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 x g again. The supernatant of the samples was analyzed

26

for carbohydrates, protein, humic substances and DNA concentrations in duplicate (Kraemer,

2002).
3.3.3. Chemical Analysis of EPS 3.3.3.1. C arbohydrates The concentration o f carbohydrates was measured by the Gaudy method (Gaudy, 1962; Frolund et a l, 1996). The range o fO - lOOmg/L D-glucose was prepared to obtain a standard curve. At 60 s intervals, 5 ml ice cold an throne reagent (0.2 % (w/v) anthrone in 95 % (v/v) H 2SO 4) was added to a
2 .0

ml sample, vorte.xed for 30 s and placed in a water bath at 100 "C for

15 min. Sequentially samples were cooled to room temperature in an ice bath and absorbance was measured at 625 nm (Spectronic* 20^, Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY, USA). 3.3.3.2. Proteins and Humic Substances The concentration of protein was measured by a modified Lowr>' method. Since the co existing humic substances in EPS affect the protein measurement of the Lowry method, the correction o f the protein concentration is required. The protein and the humic substances are measured by the same method except that the protein are measured with CUSO4 addition while the humic substances are measured without CuSO^ addition (Lowry et a l, 1951; Frolund et al, 1995 and 1996; Lucarini and Kilikian, 1999). When C 11SO4 is omitted the colour development is due to humic substances and chromogenic amino acids (Frolund et a l, 1995). For the protein measurement, the range o f 0 - 200 mg/L bovine serum albumin was prepared to obtain a standard curve. At 30 s inter\'als, 5 ml CuSO^ alkaline reagent (0.5 % (w/v) CUSO4 5 H2O in 1% (w/v) sodium tartrate solution and 2 % (w/v) Na2C0 3 in O.IM NaOH solution mixed in a ratio of 1:25) was added to a 1.0 ml sample. The sample was vortexed for 15 s and allowed to stand for 10 min. After 10 min incubation, 0.5 ml Folin reagent (50 % (v/v) Folin and Ciocalteu's phenol reagent in deionized distilled water (Milli-Q Water Systems, Millipore Corporation, MA)) was added to each sample at 15 s intervals. The sample was vortexed for 15 s and allowed to stand for at least 30 min. The absorbance (zlioiai) was measured at 750nm (Spectronic® 20"^, Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY, USA). For the humic substances measurement, 0 - 1 0 0 mg/L humic acids solution was prepared to obtain a standard curve. At 30 s intervals, 5 ml alkaline reagent (2 % (w/v) Na2C 0 ] in 0.1 M

27

NaOll solution) was added to a 1.0 ml sample. The following procedures were the same as the protein procedure. After 30 min incubation, the absorbance
( /Ib iim i)

was measured at 735nm

(Spectronic* 20^, Spectronic Instruments, Rochester. NY, USA). The correction of protein and humic substances measurement was performed using the lollowing equations Eqs 3-6.

33 .3.3. DNA
The concentration of DNA was measured by the fluorometric method (Gerhardt et al, 1994) using a standard fluorescent DNA quantitation kit (BIO-RAD Laboratories. Hercule, CA). Calf Thymus DNA was used to obtain a standard curve. 3ml
0.1

pg/ml Hoechst dye and an

appropriate volume o f a sample were mixed well. DNA in the mixed sample was measured by Huorometer (RF-Mini 150 Recording fluorometer, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Guelph, On) at 360 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. 3.4. Microscopic Observ ation of FIocs & Extracellular Polymeric Substances ^·4.1. Conventional Optical Microscopy Floe samples were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope equipped ^Ith a CCD camera (Carl Zeiss Inc, Toronto, On). Wet mount slides of samples were prepared and examined under phase contrast at lOOx magnification using a Zeiss 10 x/0.25 Phi objective.

3.4.2. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy CLSM is a microscopic technique that has been widely used in many areas. CLSM is generally described as an cpilluorescent microscope that creates a thin plane-oi-focus in which out-of focus light has been eliminated. This can be achieved either by optical barriers (pinholes) or by the physics o f light absorption (for "multiphoton" microscopy) (Wolf el (//., 2002). CLSM has been used in combination with a range of lluor-conjugated lectins to study 3D spatial bacterial arrangement within biofilms (Lawrence el al, 2003). The intense light provided by a laser source is able to penetrate thick specimens, and it can excite either intrinsic biomolecules or added fluorophors. A automated computer-controlled stepping motor is used to scan through the sample, and thus digital XY sections can be collected along the Z-dimension in real time. From these image stacks 3D images of the sample can be reconstructed via computerized image analysis methods (Lawrence et al, 1996; Neu el al, 2001). This method is used in examining the identification and distribution of EPS in llocs. The CLSM used in this study was a Zeiss Axioplan LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss Inc. Toronto, On) equipped with a water-immersible Achroplan 63 x 0.9 numerieal aperture (NA) lens and a 63
X /1 .2 W

NA (Zeiss Inc, Toronto On) lens. The 63 x 0.9 NA lens was used for observation of

fioc samples and the 63 x/1.2W NA lens was used for obser\ ation of epithelial cells. The CLSM is also equipped with Ar lasers (excitation line 488 nm) and helium-neon lasers (excitation lines 543 nm and 633nm). 3.4.2.1. Mapping of Extracellular Polymeric Substances Sample Preparation Two drops (approximately 300 pi) of Hoc sample was placed on a plankton chamber plate using a wide mouth pipette and then 700 pi 0.75 % low melting point agarose was added. In this way, the floe remains hydrated and stabilized immediately, which minimizes any fioc morphological change (Droppo el al., 1996).

Lectin Dyes and Stains Lectins are protein bound to specific carbohydrates. Generally, lectins interact with their target through multiple binding sites via hydrogen bonds, metal coordination, van der Waals and hydrophobic interaction, which increases affinity and specificity (Neu el al, 2001). This

29

specillcity is very use fill to investijzate carbohydrates moiety of glycoconjugates in the EPS matrix. Lectins conjugated with iluor have been applied in combination with CLSM to examine luily hydrated environmental biofilms (Neu and Lawrence, 1999; Lawrence et ah 2003). In addition, the use of stains such as nucleic acids, protein and lipid-hydrophobic sites are also available (Lawrence et al. 2003). The stains used in this study were Syto61 (nucleic acids), SyproOrange (protein), Nile Red (lipid-hydrophobic sites). The fluor conjugated lectins were

Ccmavalia emiforniis (ConA; specifically binds to mannopyranosyl and glucopyranosyl
residues). Triticwn vulgaris (WGA; A-acetylglucosaminyl residues) and Glycine max (SBA; Nacctylgalactosaminyl and galactopyranosyl residues). These lectins were chosen because these extracellular polymers are prominently found in EPS excreted by aquatic microorganisms (Bura e/ al., 1998; Mood and Schmidt, 1996; Kreamer, 2002; Lawrence et al, 2003:). Table 4 lists information about the stains and fluor conjugated lectins used in the present study.

Table 5 lists the stock concentration and final concentration of stains and fluor conjugated lectins used in this study. A stock solution of each stain or conjugate-conjugate was prepared and stored at -2 0 "C. Staining was performed following the stabilization of floes. Prior lo staining, the stock solution was thawed and centrifuged for 2 min at max speed. The concentration of stock solution was appropriately diluted using O.IM PBS (pH7.4) with ImM and Mn^^ according to the final concentration of stains and fluorescent probes. After the Agarose solidified, the diluted stains and fluorescent probes were applied to the stabilized floe sample and incubated for 1h at RT in a dark place. After I h incubation, excess dyes were

washed out using 0.1 M PBS (pi 17.4) with 1 mM

and Mn^^ three times. Lastly, the

stabilized Hoc sample was dried for 10 min at R.T in a dark place.

Escherichia coli 0157:117 Association with FIocs The pathogenicity of £. coli 0157:H7 can be detected by a phenotypic examination. In this study, the presence of £. coli 0157:117 and their pathogenic expression in epithelial cells 'vas examined using an antibody specifically targeted for E. coli 0157 and a-actinin. All experiments were conducted twice. 3.5.1. Strains, Plasmids and Growth Conditions EHEC 86-24 (0157:H7) carrying the plasmid p.lBA29 was used in this experiment. In the remainder o f this document, the term EHEC refers specifically to this strain carrying this plasmid. EHEC had been previously transformed with the plasmid pJBA 29 (Kanetani, 2003) The plasmid pJBA29 was isolated from Escherichia coli JBI22, which was kindly provided by J.T. Trevors of the University of Guelph. The plasmid pJBA 29 is a gfp vector of a suicide plasmid harbouring the mini-Tn 5 transposon (Figure I). It is maintained only in strains that have Ihe X pir. The transposase located outside of the mini-Tn5 operates to make the transposon move. Once it moves, it remains stable in the recipient cell's replieon (So et al.,
2 0 0 2 ).

3.5.2. Inoculation of £jc//tv7c/////co//0157:H 7 Foes were obtained from mixed liquor removed from the SBR and three types of samples were prepared. These were a buffer sample where Docs were suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4), an SBR sample, and an SBR sample with replenished nutrients (NSBR). The nutrients were added on day 2, 5, and 7 of incubation by removing supernatant and adding an equal volume of the SBR feed solution. These samples were then referred to as the NSBR samples. In this section, water type sample name is mentioned. Since the water type sample name was long, a shorter code name was given. For example. EHEC in floes suspended in PBS buffer for 2 days was shortened to 2_BF by taking the number of incubation days, letter of water sample type (B is PBS buffer, S is SBR, and N is NSBR) and letter o f EHEC type (F is flocadherent EHEC and S is free-living EHEC isolated from supernatant). All o f the floe samples were spiked with 10* colony forming unit (CFU)/ml overnight culture o f EHEC. The floe samples were shaken at 150 rpm at room temperature and observed for
10

days.

3.5.3. Enum eration of Escherichia coli 0157:H 7 by Plate Counts The number of EHEC in the free-living form and adherent form (i.e. adhered to the llocs) were daily estimated by plate counts in triplicate. The free-living form EHEC in supernatant

33

Were obtained by settling the Hoc samples for 30 min. The adherent l£Ml:C were obtained by breaking up the remaining Hoc sample utilizing syringe and vortex. These were diluted and then plated out on LB plates as indicated above. On the day lollowing plating, the number of colonies was counted. To confirm the GFP 86-24 marking, colonies on the LB plates were examined under COM with UV or plated on DC plates (Gelda Scientific, Mississauga. ON). DC plates contain two chromogenic substrates, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-P-D-glucuronide and 6 -chloro3-indolyl- p -D-galactoside. E. coli has enzymes to utilize both substrates, while most other known coliforms have the enzyme only for the galactoside substrate. As such, £ coli colonies appear blue, non-£. coli coli form colonies appear pink and non-coliform colonics appear white or translucent (Umble, et a i, 1999 ). 3.5.4. Direct Observ ation of Adherent Escherichia coli 0157:117 by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy The distribution of adherent EHEC in floes was observed by CLSM at intervals of 2, 5 and 7 days. The floes with adherent EHEC were stabilized in the same manner described in the sample preparation under EPS mapping. The prepared samples were scanned under CLSM in the two modes: fluorescence mode (Ar laser) and transmission mode. The CLSM parameters and image analysis procedures were performed in the same manner as those listed under EPS mapping. 3.5.5. Pathogenicity of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 Isolated From Water Samples 3 5.5.1. Immunofluorescence Detection of a-.4ctinin The pathogenicity of EHEC extracted from both systems, floes and supernatant, in PBS buffer, SBR and NSBR were examined. Two aspects of pathogenicity were examined. First is a Jevel of host adhesion ability, which depends on expression of adhesions. Second is a level of a3ctinin accumulation (foci o f a-actinin), which depends on host adhesion as well as expression o f other virulence factors (Foster, personal communication). Foci of a-actinin were detected in infected epithelial cells by following the protocol previously described (.Tohnson-Henry etai, 2001). A single colony o f EHEC was obtained from the enumeration plates for 2 day, 4 day and 10 day incubation. EHEC were grown overnight in 10ml LB broth as indicated. 1 ml overnight culture EHEC was grown for 2 h in static, 7 ml Dulbecco minimal Eagle medium (DMEM)

34

(Gibco Laboratories, Gand Island, N.Y.) at 37 "C in 5 % CO 2. The human epithelial cell line. HEp-2 was grown to 80 % confluence at 37"C, 5 % CO2 in Minimal Essential Media (MEM) (Gibco) containing 10 % fetal calf serum (PCS) (Gansera International Inc) and 0.1 % gentamycin (Gibco BRL) in four-well chamber slides (Nunc Inc, Naperville III USA). Monolayers of HEp-2 cells (approximately 10^ epithelial cells per well as determined by count with a hemocytometer slide) were washed with sterile PBS (pM7.l) two times, and then infected with approximately lO' EHEC (total number of EHEC in DMEM was estimated by spectrophotometer at 600nm and the inoculation volume was calculated) at a multiplicity of infection of 100:1 in MEM without PCS and gentamycin for 4 hours at 37 "C in 5 % CO2. After 4 hours, non-adherent bacteria were removed from the cells by six washes with PBS. The monolayers were then fixed in 98 % methanol at room temperature for 10 min and followed by three washes with PBS. The fixed cells were incubated with a 1/100 dilution o f goat anti E. coli 0157 (Biodesign International, Saco, ME, USA) as primary antibody for Ih at 37 "C with gentle shaking. After six washes with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with a I/I 00 dilution of Alexa Pluor" 647 donkey anti-goat IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, Inc, Eugene. Greg USA) as secondary antibody with protection from light for Ih at 37 °C with gentle shaking. After six washes with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with the second set of primary antibody, I/I 00 dilution of mouse anti-a-actinin IgM (Sigrna, Oakville, ON Canada) and the secondary antibody. I-in 100 dilution o f Alexa Pluor® 546 goat anti-mouse IgM conjugates (Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene. Oreg USA) in the same manner as described above. The slides were then mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation Inc., Mississauga, ON) and allowed to dry overnight at 4 "C. Bacterial adhesion (£. co// 0157 staining) and foci of a-actinin were examined under fluorescence mode and transmission mode at 6300-x magnification using a Zeiss Ac63 x/l. 2 W objective by CLSM. The specific parameters for these assays are given in Table 8 . E. coli 0157 and foci of a-actinin appeared green and red respectively. Two aspects of pathogenicity were examined. Pirst is a level of host adhesion ability, which depends on expression of adhesion. Second is a level of a-actinin accumulation, which depends on host adhesion as well as expression of other virulence factors. Por each sample, the total number of epithelial cells was based on a count o f a minimum of epithelial cells (Johnson-Henry, et a!., 2001). Epithelial eells with

presented either singly or in a microcolony were scored positively for host adherence (Abe el ai, 2002). Epithelial cells bearing 1 or more foci of a-actinin under adherent EHEC were scored positively for a-actinin accumulation. The ratio of each score (for host adherence or a-actinin accumulation) to total epithelial cells was then estimated and compared. Furthermore, the ratio of a-actinin accumulation to host adherence was also calculated as the adherent infection ability and compared.

CH A PTER 4. RESULTS 4.1. Charactcrizafion of Floes & Extracellular Polymeric Substances The adhesion of pathogens to Aocs is hypothesized to be an important process in pathogen persistence and transport. The fate of adherent pathogens is strongly inAuenccd by the stability o f Docs. Floe stability appears to be related to EPS because EPS are involved with interparticle interactions such as salt bridges, physical enmeshment and hydrophobic interactions (Liao el a l, 2002). In particular, it has been suggested that proteins, which are a major component of EPS, is important in the salt bridges of sludge Aocs and in hydrophobic interactions for bacterial adhesion (Higgins and Novak, 1998). Thus, in this study, the effect of protein removal on Aoc stability and interparticle interactions was investigated by digesting proteins from Aocs by enzyme treatment. In the following sections, the results from the physical and chemical analyses of Aocs are discussed before moving on to a discussion o f the results of Aoc stability. 4.1.1. Physical Analysis of Floes The physical analysis of Aocs involved an examination of hydrophobicity, surface charge and dissociation constant. 4.1.1.1. Hydrophobicity Hydrophobicity o f Aocs is an important characteristic because it involves Aoc formation and pathogen adherence on Aocs via hydrophobic interaction (Liao et al. 2001). As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, hydrophobicity decreased signiAcantly when proteins were digested by pronase E or proteinase K for 2h incubation (t-test, P< 0.05). In Figure 2, the mean hydrophobicity of pronase E treated Aoc samples was 83.5 ±2.1 % while that of control samples was 90.2 ± 1.4 %. In Figure 3, the mean hydrophobicity of proteinase K treated Aoc samples was 86.5 ± 0.6 % while that o f control samples was
8 8 .8

± 1.1 %.

` ^·1.1.2. Surface Charge Surface charge has been considered to be associated with flocculation. The presence of a net negative surface charge on floe surfaces may create repulsive electrostatic interactions, which prevents close contact (Wilen et ah, 2003). As a result, weaker bonding occurs between the various floe fractions (Wilen et al., 2003). It has been suggested that one of the major contributors o f the negative surface charge is the functional group in proteins. Thus, it is expected that the digestion of proteins would lead to less negative charge (Wilen et a i, 2003).

38

However, as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, the mean negativity of surface cliarge significantly increased when proteins were digested by both enzymes (t-test, P< 0.05). Figure 4 shows that the mean surface charge of pronase E treated Hoc samples was -0.884 ± 0.051 meq/g MLSS while that o f the control samples was -0.735 ± 0.038 meq/g MLSS. Figure 5 shows that the mean surface charge o f proteinase K treated floe samples was -0.866 ± 0.038 meq/g MLSS while that o f the control samples was -0.740 ± 0.028 meq/g MLSS.

4.1.1.3. Dissociation Constant The dissociation constant is a further indicator of the stability of flocs. The dissociation constant can be obtained from a standard linear regression of the accumulated absorbance in sequential washing versus the number of sequential washings (Liao et a l, 2002). An example of dissociation by EDTA is shown in the Appendix C. Figure 6 shows that the mean dissociation constant of 1000 pg/ml EDTA treated (0.254 ± 0.056) flocs was significantly greater than that of the control (-0.03 ± 0.014) (t-test, P< 0.05). This indicates that EDTA significantly deflocculated flocs to generate fine unsettleable parts of the flocs.

Figure 6. Dissociation constants for EDTA treated floes * P<0.05 Dissociation caused by EDTA was directly observed under COM. As Figure 7 shows, most flocs were dissociated into irregular and diffuse flocs, however some flocs remained dense 3nd compact as shown in Figure 8. The dense and compact flocs generally contained dominant EPS areas, which were also observed in the control flocs (Figure 9). Some flocs were as large as the control flocs. Each floe in the EDTA treated and the control samples was compared in terms of the size fraction. Flocs were categorized into three size fractions, small are those flocs with a largest diameter less than 150 pm, medium are from more than 150 pm to less than 500 pm, large is more than 500 pm.

Figure 8. EPS dominated flocs after EDTA treatm ent Flocs were observed under phase contrast x 100. Scale bar = 250 pm. Dominant EPS areas (dark areas) were found in large flocs after EDTA treatment.

Figure 9. Control flocs with dense areas of EPS Floe sample was treated with O.IM PBS for 105 min (4 PBS washings). Flocs were observed under phase contrast x 100. Scale bar = 250 pm. Rounded and dense Control flocs with dominant EPS areas were observed.

Figure 10 shows the small llocs dominate in both treatment samples. The 80.5 ± 6.5 % Hoes was small size fraction in the EDTA treated sample while the 63.5 ± 12.7 % flocs was small fraction in the control sample. The EDTA treated sample contained more small flocs, however, there was no significant difference between the two (t-test, P<0.05). On the other hand, the significantly lower medium fractions in EDTA treated sample (13.8 ± 5.9% flocs) were observed when compared with that in the control sample (26.8 ± 5.9 % flocs) (t-test, P<0.05). fhc large fraction also decreased in the EDTA treated sample (5.75 ± 1.98 % flocs) compared to the control sample (9.68 ± 7.0 % flocs), however, there was no significant difference (t-test, P<0.05).

Figure 10. Effect of EDTA treatment on floe size In order to examine if digestion of proteins leads to complete floe dissociation, the EDTA treated samples were further treated with 200 pg/ml pronase E or 200 pg/ml proteinase K for 2 h Incubation. Figure 12 and Figure 13 show that not all flocs were completely dissociated after enzyme treatments. Some flocs dissociated into smaller flocs that contained dense EPS areas, interestingly, some large flocs appear to be composed of branches of dense EPS areas. These branches were not obsen'cd in the control sample (Figure 14). The size fraction of the enzyme treated flocs and the control samples were compared in the same manner as above. Similar to EDTA treated sample. Figure 11 shows the small flocs dominated in both pronase E treatment

and control samples. The small size fraction of pronase E treated (68.99 ± 10.03 % llocs) was larger than the control (57.97 ± 13.89 % flocs). The medium fraetion of pronase E was lower (22.62 ± 5.43 % floes) compared to the control (33.27 ± 12.00 % flocs). The large fraction of pronase E (8.386 ± 6.331 % llocs) was also lower compared to the control (8.748 ± 4.618 % flocs). However, these differences in the size fractions between two samples were not statistically significant (t-test, P<0.05). 100

Figure 11. Effect of pronase E treatment following EDTA treatment on floe size Similar to the trend of the EDTA and pronase E treated samples, Figure 15 shows that the small flocs dominated in both proteinase K treatment and control samples. Contrary to the size fractions in the EDTA and pronase E treated samples, lower small size fraction in the proteinase K treated sample (53.45 ± 21.63 % flocs) was found compared to the control (62.72 ± 22.08 % flocs). Furthermore, higher medium fraction of the proteinase K treated sample (34.94 ± 14.96 % flocs) compared to the control (29.87 ± 18.25 % flocs) and higher large fraction of the proteinase K treated sample (11.60 ± 6.717 % flocs) compared to the control (7.409 ± 4.060 %). were observed. Even though the fractions in the proteinase K treated sample did not significantly differ from that in the control (t-test, P<0,05), these results might indicate that some flocs became larger in size during proteinase K treatment.

4.1.2. Chemical Analysis of Extracellular Polymeric Substances EPS are known to include carbohydrates, proteins, humic substances and DNA. It is important to chemically analyse each EPS component since it has been suggested that each EPS component contributes to floe characteristics such as hydrophobicity and surface charge. In this study, two types of EPS were analysed. The first was loosely bound EPS, which is the EPS fraction present in supernatant after centrifugation. The other was bound EPS, which is the EPS fraetion present in supernatant after centrifugation following the CER extraction method (Higgins and Novak, 1997; Wilén et al., 2003). Figure 16 illustrates the results for the loosely bound EPS. The dominant humic substances and proteins in the pronase E treated sample (15.0 ± 1.5 mg/g MLSS, 5.75 ± 1,08 mg/g MLSS) were significantly lower compared to the control (38.1 ±1.1 mg/g MLSS, 9.35 ± 1.38 mg/g MLSS) (P<0.05). On the other hand, carbohydrates in the pronase E treated sample (23.7 ± 2.0 mg/g MLSS) were significantly higher compared to the control (10.8 ± 0.3 mg/g MLSS) (P<0.05). DNA was a minor component in both samples, pronase E (0.018 ± 0.000 mg/g MLSS) and control (0.023 ± O.OOOmg/g MLSS).

4.2. Microscopic Observ ation of Extracellular Polymeric Substances Microscopic observation of EPS is very useful because it provides a non-destructive analysis that gives useful information about spatial distribution o f EPS and localization of EPS composition. 4.2.1. M apping of Extracellular Polymeric Substances 4.2.1 . 1 . Nucleic Acids, Lipid-hydrophobic Sites and Proteins Floe samples were first treated with 1000 pg/ml EDTA for 135min and then treated with proteinase K for 120 min (this full treatment is referred to as EDTA-K treatment). After the treatment, EDTA, EDTA-K and control floe samples were stained with dyes, Syto 61 (blue), Nile red (red) and SyproOrange (green), which are specific to nucleic acids, lipids-hydrophobic sites and proteins. The stained samples were observed under CLSM to examine the distribution o f EPS components in flocs. The CLSM micrographs in Figures 20-26, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38 show two-dimensional orthogonal sections of the three-dimensional flocs and are made up of three panels. In each Figure, Panel A shows an xy image at the z plane. Panel B shows a yz image at the x plane. Panel C shows an xz image at the y plane. In this way, both the vertical and horizontal distribution of EPS components can be observed.

48

In all samples, nucleic acids, lipids-hydrophobic sites and proteins were detected. Nucleic acids appear blue, lipid-hydrophobic sites appear red and proteins appear green. These macromoleeuies generally exist heterogeneously, horizontally and vertically throughout the llocs. As an example. Figure 20 shows nucleic acids, lipid-hydrophobic sites and proteins distribution in EDTA-treated flocs along with the same floe image in a reflectance mode. The macromoleeuies seem to be localized where dense floe areas are found in the reflectance mode. In addition, proteins appear to be the most abundant and are distributed uniformly such that they cover the floe. Figure 20 also seems to indicate that there are large areas of the flocs that include eolocalization of two or more macromoleeuies. It seems that the degree of colocalization varies depending on the type of macromoleeuies. The degree of macromolecule eolocalization is examined in the following images, initially dealing with EDTA-treated flocs and then covering the EDTA and enzyme treated flocs. Figure 21 illustrates that a high degree of eolocalization of nucleic acids, lipids-hydrophobic sites and proteins occurred in the EDTA-treated floes. This colocalization appears as white/light blue areas and is indicated by arrows. This colocalization appears to be present at the surface/periphery of the floe. Further, Figure 21 (b) shows a relatively large colocalization of nucleic aeids and lipid-hydrophobic sites (magenta). Dense nucleic acids appear to cover the whole floe whereas less dense (dot-like) lipid-hydrophobie site appears to be localized in the floe. The nucleic acid dye stains extracellular nucleic acids and microorganisms. The lipidhydrophobic site dye seems to stain extracellular lipids and probably microorganisms based on the size o f the red dots. Thus, the colocalization of nucleic acids and lipid-hydrophobic sites seems to indicate the association o f microorganisms with extracellular lipids and attribution of microorganisms to the hydrophobic properties in flocs. It is also noted that some lipidhydrophobic sites are also distributed around nucleic acids and the interior of the floe. Figure 21 (c) also shows a large colocalization o f nucleic acids and proteins, which appears as cyan. This colocalization appears to cover most o f the floe, which might indicate that the association of microorganisms and extracellular proteins as well as the presence o f proteins in on surface of the microorganisms. Similar to the lipid-hydrophobie sites, proteins are also found around nucleic acids and in the interior of the floe. Figure 21 (d) shows yellow areas, representing the colocalization of lipid-hydrophobie sites and proteins. Similar to the colocalization of nucleic aeids and lipid-hydrophobie sites, this colocalization appears to be relatively large and present at

the surface/periphery of the flocs. This colocalization also seems to indicate that there are both hydrophobic and non-hydrophobic (hydrophilic) proteins in the EDTA-treated floc. Next, the degree of macromolecule colocalization in the control floc is examined. Similar to the colocalization in the EDTA-treated floc above, Figure 22 (b) illustrates a relatively large colocalization of nucleic acids, lipids-hydrophobic sites and proteins in the control floc (which are indicated by arrows). In the control floc, the colocalization of pairs of macromoleeuies is also found. Figure 22 (c) shows a large area of colocalization of nucleic acids and lipid-hydrophobic sites, which appears magenta. Compared to the EDTA-treated floc, the control floc contained a greater degree of this type of colocalization. This might indicate the close association of microorganisms with either extracellular lipids or floc hydrophobicity. It is also noted that the lipid-hydrophobic sites are distributed throughout the control floc. In addition, the lipidhydrophobic sites are found around nucleic acids. Figure 22 (d) also shows the colocalization of nucleic acids and proteins, which appears cyan. Similar to the EDTA-treated floc, a higher degree of colocalization occurred, which appears to cover most of the control floc. This might also indicate the association of microorganisms and extracellular proteins. Similar to the lipidhydrophobic sites, proteins are also found around nucleic acids and in the interior of the flocs. Figure 22 (e) shows the colocalization of proteins and lipid-hydrophobic sites, which appears yellow. Compared to the EDTA-treated floc, it seems that the control floc had more proteins colocalized with lipid-hydrophobic sites. Next, the degree of macromolecule colocalization in the EDTA-K floc is examined. Similar to the images above. Figure 23 illustrates the high degree of colocalization of nucleic acids, lipids-hydrophobic sites and proteins. Similar to the EDTA-treated floc, this colocalization appears to cover the whole floc. Furthermore, the colocalization of pairs of two macromoleeuies is also easily found in the EDTA-K floc. However, it seems that the EDTA-K floc contains a lower degree of colocalization of nucleic acids and proteins. This might be because the EDTA-K floc contained a smaller amount of proteins compared to nucleic acids. However, some proteins are found in the interior of the floc such as beneath the colocalization (Figure 23(d) panel B and C) and around nucleic acids. In addition, most proteins seem to colocalize with lipidhydrophobie sites, indicating most proteins are hydrophobic in the EDTA-K floc.

4.2.I.2. Lcctin-conjugatcd Dyes Similar to the previous method, floc samples were treated with 1000 pg/ml EDTA for 135 min and then treated with proteinase K for 120 min. Control floc samples were also prepared. After each treatment, flocs were stained with lectin-conjugate dyes, ConA (blue), WGA (red), and SBA (green). These dyes are specific to carbohydrate residues. ConA is specific to mannopyranosyl (Man) and glucopyranosyl (Glc) residue. WGA is specific to Nacetylglucosaminyl (GlcNAc) residues. SBA is specific to A-acetylgalactosaminyl (GalNAc) and galactopyranosyl (Gal) residues. The stained samples were observed under CLSM to examine distribution of carbohydrates in flocs. In all samples, ConA, WGA and SBA stained areas were detected. These carbohydrates are generally thought to exist heterogeneously, horizontally and vertically throughout the flocs. However, the distribution pattern of the stained areas appeared different. Figure 24 shows ConA, WGA and SBA distribution in the control flocs, along with the same floc shown in a reflectance mode. In the control floc, WGA bound in a relatively large area of floc from the surface to the interior of the floc. Contrary to WGA, ConA bound in the very small area of the periphery of the floc. SBA also bound to small areas that were scattered around the surface of the flocs. Each lectin dye stained distinct area and very limited amount of colocalization was observed. Figure 25 shows ConA, WGA and SBA distribution in the EDTA-treated floc along with a reflectance mode image o f the floc. WGA has a similar distribution pattern as the control however, it seems that ConA and SBA have bound over a larger area. In particular, SBA shows a more diffusive and cloud-like staining pattern from the surface to the interior of the flocs, which led to an increased in the overlap with WGA. Figure 26 shows ConA, WGA and SBA distribution in the EDTA-K treated floc, along with a reflectance mode image of the floc. ConA and WGA have similar distribution patterns as the control. Similar to the EDTA-treated floc, SBA in the EDTAK treated floc seems to have bound in a larger area of floc from the surface to the interior of the floc. SBA also showed a more diffusive and cloud-like staining pattern, which increased colocalization with WGA at the surface and the interior of floc.

4.3. Association of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 with Floc It is known that E. coli 0157:H7 can survive in an adverse environment for extended periods o f time and then cause health problems through food and water contamination. However, it is not clearly known how they survive in some environments, and in partieular, natural aquatic environments. It is also not clearly known if they still retain the capability to infect in such environments. In this study, the survival of E. coli 0157:H7 (referred as EHEC) in floc suspended water, in particular, due to its association with flocs, is examined. Adherent EHEC were isolated from flocs and their pathogenicity was also investigated. 4.3.1. Survival of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 in Water Water samples containing SBR flocs in PBS buffer, NSBR and SBR were inoculated with 10* CFU/ml EHEC and the number of surviving EHEC (both free-living and adhered to flocs) in each water sample was estimated by plate count for a period of 10 days. This experiment was conducted twice. Table 9 and Table 10 show that there was a gradual decrease in the number of EHEC adhered to flocs and in free-living form in all'samples. The order of highest survival of EHEC of each form remained the same for each sample solution type. The highest number o f EHEC surviving at the 10-day incubation was in the PBS buffer sample (adherent; 1.05

10^ ± 0.04 X 10^ CFU/ml and free-living form; 3.82 x 10* ± 0.17 x 10^ CFU/ml). The

lowest survival was in the SBR (adherent; 1.35 x 10* ± 0.21 x 10* CFU/ml and free-living form; 1.61

lO' CFU/ml). The number of adherent and free-living EHEC surviving in the

PBS buffer sample at the 10-day incubation was a significantly higher level than in the other two samples (P<0.05). Furthermore, Table 9 and Table 10 also show that, in all samples, more adherent EHEC survived than free-living EHEC. However, there were no significant survival differences between the types o f EHEC in each sample (P<0.05). Moreover, it is important to estimate what degree o f EHEC adhered to the EPS area, since the more stable EPS area allows EHEC to persist in water for a longer time posing higher risk of infection. Thus, flocs with adhered EHEC were further treated with proteinase K.

Figure 27 shows that the ratio of adherent EHEC in the EPS to total adherent EHEC in PBS buffer and SBR remained similar for 10 days of incubation. However, the ratio of adherent EHEC in the EPS to total adherent EHEC in NSBR showed a spike at 6 days of incubation and then dropped significantly. Among the tliree water samples, the NSBR sample had a significantly higher percentage of EHEC in the EPS (19.2 ± 1.6 %) compared to the SBR (15.0 ± 1.9 %) and the PBS buffer (6.10 ± 0.48 %) at the 10-day incubation (P<0.05). Furthermore, the flocs on the 10-day incubation from each sample were also examined under COM and are shown in Figure 28. Figure 28 (a) shows that the floc in the PBS buffer (PBS floc) is degrading due to starvation. Figure 28 (b) shows that the floc in NSBR (NSBR floc) includes dense EPS areas. Figure 28 (c) shows that the floc in SBR (SBR floc) has not degraded as much as the PBS floc and has less dense EPS than the NSBR floc.

4.3.2. Direct Observ ation of adherent Escherichia coli 0157:H 7 by CLSM The distribution of adherent EHEC in flocs were observed under CLSM. Figure 29 and Figure 30 show the distribution of EHEC in flocs suspended in PBS buffer on a 2-day incubation. In Figure 29B, EHEC are seen as the green fluorescent spots indicated with arrows. In general, EHEC dispersed individually in flocs. Figure 30 is the orthogonal section o f Figure 29 illustrating that adherent EHEC generally appear to locate at/near the surface of flocs. The average width of the green band on z axis is approximately 6.6 pm, which serves as an indicator for EHEC distribution. Figure 31 and Figure 32 demonstrates the distribution o f EHEC in flocs suspended in SBR on a 2-day incubation. Similar to the above figures. Figure 31 demonstrates that EHEC are dispersed individually in flocs. Figure 32 shows that adherent EHEC generally appear to locate at/near the surface o f flocs. In particular. Panel C (Figure 32) illustrates that EHEC are on the top o f the dark dense EPS area. The average width of the green band on z axis is approximately 5.3 pm.

Figure 34 is an orthogonal section illustrating that adherent EHEC generally appear to locate at/near the surface of flocs. The average width of the green band on z axis is approximately 9.2 pm.

Figure 36 is an orthogonal section illustrating that adherent EHEC generally appear to be in the interior o f NSBR flocs. The average width o f the green band on z axis is approximately 7.6 pm. This result is again wider than the flocs in SBR at the 2-day incubation but somewhat narrower than the PBS flocs at 7-day incubation. Again this indicates that the EHEC distribution spreads inward o f flocs. Both Figures also show a compact and dense floe with a large EPS area. Figure 37 and Figure 38 show the distribution of EHEC in SBR flocs at 7-day incubation. There are a smaller number of adherent EHEC, including individual cells, which is in agreement with the plate counts. Figure 38 is an orthogonal section illustrating that adherent EHEC generally appear to locate at/near the surface o f flocs. The average width of the green band on z axis is approximately 7.4 pm. This result is also wider than the 2-day incubation, which might indicate that the EHEC distribution spreads inward into the flocs. In addition. Figure 38 shows that this floe is less compact and dense than the NSBR floe. 4.3.3. Pathogenicity of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 Extracted from Floe samples Since it has been observed that EHEC were able to survive In water samples, it is important to investigate if these EHEC retain pathogenicity in this environment. The EHEC were isolated from water samples and then their pathogenicity were observed based on a-actinin accumulation in epithelial HEp-2 cells. In this study, the effects of the environment (free-living or in flocs, types of water samples and various incubation times (2- or 10-days)) on pathogenicity were examined. 4.3.3.I. Immunofluorescent Assays In each sample examined, EHEC isolated from the water samples were generally able to adhere to and infect epithelial cells after 4 h incubation. However, based on a detailed CLSM image analysis, it appears that the degree of EHEC adherence to cells and the subsequent a actinin accumulation differed. For each samples, the ratio of host adhesion ability and a-actinin accumulation were estimated and shown in Figure 39. These results show that levels of host adhesion ability in all water samples were lower than that in the positive control of EHEC grown in a rich medium. In most water samples, the difference was significant except for 10_SF and 10_SS (P<0.05). Similarly, levels of a-actinin accumulation in all water samples were also lower than the control but there was no significant difference in the following water samples, 2_SF,

67

10_BS, 10_SF and 10 SS (P<0.05). When the type of EHEC was compared, floc-adherent EHEC showed higher levels of host adhesion ability and a-actinin accumulation than free-living EHEC, but these were not significantly different in both cases (P<0.05). The free-living EHEC also showed higher (10_SS) and lower (2_SS) levels of both compared to the floc-adherent EHEC. With respect to the type of water sample, it did not seem to have any significant effect on the levels of host infection ability and a-actinin accumulation because only 10_SF showed significantly higher levels of host adhesion ability and a-actinin accumulation than lO NF (P5 O.O5 ). Lastly, the effect of the incubation time (2- or 10-days) of EHEC was also examined. In general, EHEC at the longer incubation time showed higher levels of host adhesion ability and a-actinin accumulation. In particular, significantly higher levels were found in BE, BS and SS solutions (P<0.05).

Since a-actinin accumulation depends on bacterial adhesion as a precursor, it is also important to determine whether the ratio of a-actinin accumulation to bacterial adhesion was altered. This ratio is expressed as an infection ability, which is shown in Table 11. These results show that the infection ability appears to be unchanged with respect to the type of EHEC (floe adherent or free-living), water sample type or incubation time (P<0.05). Table 11. EHEC infection ability (N=2) Water Samples Ratio of a-Actinin Accumulation to Host Adherence (%) Control 38.51 ±7.28 2 BE 23.71 ± 14.03 2_BS 28.66 ± 19.79 2 SE* 32.14 ±9.45 2_SS* 15.48 ±8.99 10 BE 38.02 ± 10.38 10 BS 50.23 ± 22.54 10 NE 30.45 ±9.17 34.09 ± 20.06 I ONS 10_SE* 36.02 ±2.77 10 SS* 39.39 ±9.44 These results were based on the data from one experiment. Interestingly, various EHEC adhesion patterns such as microcolonies and aggregated single bacteria in clusters were observed. After 4 h infection time, very few discrete EHEC microcolonies and a-actinin accumulation under bacterial adherence was found. Those samples Were 2 BE, 2 BS, and lO NF. As an example, microcolony and actin accumulation in 2_BS are shown in Figure 40. Other EHEC adhered in clusters, which was observed in all samples, but aactinin accumulation at the site of bacterial attachment was found in 2 BE, 1Q BE, 1O NE, IO NS and lO SS. As an example, EHEC in clusters and actin accumulation in 2_BE are shown in Figure 41. Sometimes, EHEC adhesion was not accompanied by foci of a-actinin accumulation. As an example, lO SS are shown in Figure 42.

CHAPTER 5. DISCUSSION 5.1. Characterization of Flocs & Extracellular Polymeric Substances The characterization of flocs and EPS included both a physical analysis of flocs and a chemical analysis of EPS 5.1.1. Physical Analysis of Flocs The physical analysis of flocs involved an examination of hydrophobicity, surface charge and dissociation constant. Hydrophobicity is important for floe formation and microbial adherence (including pathogens) on flocs via hydrophobic interaction (Liao et al., 2001). Surface charge is considered to be associated with flocculation contact (i.e. floe formation) (Wilén et a i, 2003). The dissociation constant is a measure of the stability of flocs. Since these properties are also related to the properties of EPS in flocs (Jorand et a i, 1998; Liao et ai, 2001; Wilén et ai, 2003), the present study focused on the effect on these properties when there were variations in EPS composition. In particular, the experiments focused on the removal of EPS proteins. EPS proteins were digested by enzymes, pronase E or proteinase K, and then subject to surface characterization. These enzyme treatments were expected to have a relatively significant effect on these surface properties of flocs. Each enzyme treatment significantly lowered the hydrophobicity of the floe sample compared to the control floe sample (t-test, p<0.05) (Figures 2 and 3). Each enzyme treatment also significantly increased the negative surface charge of the same floe sample compared to the control floe sample (t-test, p<0.05) (Figures 4 and 5). The increased negative surface charge and lowered hydrophobicity might both have occurred because the initial flocs were dissociated into smaller flocs. This dissociation of flocs by enzyme treatment is in agreement with studies by Endo et ai (1976) and Higgins and Novak (1997). In dissociation, the smaller flocs have a larger surface area and present a larger surface charge because former "inner floe charge" is exposed as a "surface charge". The surface charge was measured by a colloidal titration method, in which excess cationic polymer was added to the floe sample prior to the titration. The increased surface area reacted with the cationic polymers to a fairly large degree as indicated by the lower amount of titrant (anionic) that was required to reach electrical neutrality (in accord with Mikkelsen, 2003). As a result, a greater negative surface charge was indicated.

74

Because of.this negative surface charge, the floe surface appeared strongly polar, which resulted in stronger interactions with water molecules. Therefore, decreased hydrophobicity was observed (as suggested by Liao el al., 2001). The change in surface charge and hydrophobicity may also have been due related to an increase in humic substances. As discussed in more detail below, the enzyme treatments resulted in an increase in humic substances in bound EPS. An increase in humic substances contributes to an increase in the negativity of surface charge because humic substances are a complicated mixture o f polyaliphatic and polyaromatic compounds, containing carboxylic, phenolic and other functional groups, which give a highly negative charge density to the surface (Jones and Bryan, 1998; Wilén c / «/., 2003). 5.1.1.1. Dissociation Constant Salt bridges are one of the factors involved in stabilizing flocs. Divalent cations are suggested to be involved in salt bridges by binding with negatively charged EPS (Flemming. 2002; Liao et a i, 2002). The divalent cation Ca^^ has been suggested to play an important role since the addition of Ca^^ leads to reflocculation of activated sludge and the removal o f Ca^^ leads to dissociation o f flocs (Higgins and Novak, 1997; Liao et a l, 2002; Zita and Hemiansson, 1994). The stability o f flocs due to salt bridges has been examined using the dissociation constant as an indicator o f Hoc stability - a greater dissociation constant indicates a poorer stability (Liao ct al, 2002). In the present study, a floe sample was treated with 1000 pg/ml EDTA. As expected, the mean dissociation constant o f the EDTA treated flocs was significantly greater than that of the control (t-test, p<0.05) (Figures 6). This appears to indicate that EDTA causes dissociation of flocs. The EDTA treated flocs were then examined directly by microscope and size measurements were taken. In both the control and the EDTA treated floe samples, small size (less than 150 pm) flocs were dominant. Medium size (between 150 pm and 500 pm) flocs were the second most abundant and large size (larger than 500 pm) flocs were the least represented (Figure 10). Interestingly, the ratio of the size fraction was different between the EDTA treated flocs and the control samples. The EDTA treated floe sample contained a higher amount of small flocs (not statistically significant) and a lower amount of medium flocs (statistically significantly). This result is in accordance with the findings of Liao et al. (2002) who found that

75

EDTA caused dissociation of activated sludge flocs. The major effect of EDTA was the disruption of salt bridges via the [M2EDTA]^' ion removing divalent cations that were involved in the salt bridges in flocs (Liao et al, 2002). The EDTA treated floe sample was also directly observed under COM. As expected, smaller (dissociated) flocs were observed. However, relatively large flocs were also observed. Interestingly, the large flocs were found in the vicinity o f fine particles generated by dissociation of other flocs (Figure 7). This indicates that the large flocs were somehow able to withstand the dissociation by EDTA. The large flocs appeared to contain one or more dark, distinct EPS areas. This may indicate that the presence of EPS is important in the stability of flocs. This is in agreement with the general idea of EPS being involved in the fonnation and stability of flocs due to hydrophobic interactions and physical enmesliment (Liao et a l, 2002). Since proteins in the EPS have been suggested to be important in hydrophobic interactions within the EPS matrix, the next step was to remove the proteins from the flocs in order to examine the floe stability. The EDTA treated samples were further treated by enzymes, either pronase E or proteinase K and then examined by COM. Similar to the EDTA treated flocs, some enzyme treated flocs were further deflocculated (dissociated) but others seemed to remain relatively large. This observation was contrary to the finding by Endo et al. (1976) that pronase E treatment led to complete deflocculation and the finding by Park et al. (2000) that pronase E treatment led to removal o f proteinaceous structures. Interestingly, the remaining larger flocs appeared to contain branches of dense EPS areas. These branches were not observed in the control sample (Figure 12). The enzyme treated flocs were also categorized by size (Figures 14 and 15). Similar to control and the EDTA treated floe samples, the small size (less than 150 pm) flocs were dominant. The pronase E treated flocs contained a higher amount of small flocs and lower amount o f medium flocs (between 150 pm and 500 pm) compared to the control flocs (not statistically significant). It seems that only medium size flocs were susceptible to dissociation by pronase E. On the contrary, the proteinase K treated flocs showed a lower amount of small flocs and a higher amount of medium and large flocs than the control flocs. Even though the size fractions did not significantly differ from the control sample (t-test, p<0.05), this result might indicate that some flocs became larger during proteinase K treatment due to reflocculation This reflocculation seems to be linked to the observation of large flocs consisting of branches of EPS areas after reflocculation. Reflocculation o f previously deflocculated sludge flocs has been

76

observed by Biggs and Lant (2000) and Jin el al. (2003). The reflocculation mechanism has not been clarified yet, however, it has been suggested that dissociated Hoc fragments collide with each other during stirring. Although some of collisions cause an attachment whereas others do not, it has been proposed that the EPS composition and internal molecular binding forces are involved in the rellocculation ability (Jin el a i, 2003). Nevertheless, the results in this study seem to infer that EPS are resistant to chemical and enzymatic dissociation and is quite important for floe stability. 5.1.2. Chemical Analysis of Extracellular Polymeric Substances The chemical analysis of EPS in the present study involves a quantification of EPS components. EPS components are suggested to play an important role in floe characteristics, including flocculation, stability and reflocculation (Jorand et ai, 1998; Liao el al., 2002; Wilén

et al., 2003). Two types of EPS, loosely bound EPS and bound EPS were analysed. Loosely
bound EPS was obtained in supernatant after centrifugation. Bound EPS was obtained in supernatant after cation exchange resin (CER) extraction (Higgins and Novak, 1997; Wilén et

a l, 2003). These two types o f EPS were observed following separate treatment of the flocs with
two different enzymes, pronase E and proteinase K. All EPS solutions (including the control) were quantified for humic substances, protein, carbohydrates and DNA. In loosely bound EPS, the pronase E treated flocs released a significant amount of carbohydrates from the flocs into the supernatant after the centrifuge (p<0.05), which was indicated by a higher concentration of carbohydrates. In addition, the pronase E treated flocs contained a significantly lower concentration of humic substances and protein (p<0.05) (Figure 16). On the other hand, the proteinase K treated flocs contained significantly higher concentrations of humic substances and carbohydrates (p<0.05) (Figure 18). The proteinase K treated flocs also resulted in a lower concentration of protein (however, not statistically significant). It is difficult to determine the effect of enzyme treatments on humic substances in loosely bound EPS because the results in both samples contradicted each other. However, the addition o f enzymes to the floe samples appeared to cause a release of carbohydrates from bound EPS (see below), which was also found by Higgins and Novak (1997). This might have occurred because the enzymes disrupted the protein-carbohydrate interaction in the EPS matrix (Higgins and Novak, 1997). On the other hand, a decrease in the concentration of protein in loosely bound

77

EPS might be caused by two possibilities. One is that increased carbohydrate concentration in loosely bound EPS might have interfered with the protein measurement (Lowry method). Even though the Lowry method is sensitive and precise enough to detect a single amino acid, sugars such as glucose and sucrose are known to interfere with this type of protein measurement (Lucarini and Kilikian, 1999). The other cause may be that proteins in the loosely bound EPS became bound to the flocs (reflocculation), which might be explained by the increased concentration of proteins in the bound EPS in the enzyme treated flocs (as discussed further below). The removal of proteins from supernatant was observed by Wilén el al. (2000) when the anaerobic sludge (deflocculated) floe was reflocculated by oxygen. This study showed that the number of bacteria and the amount of protein and humic substances correlated well with the turbidity in the supernatant (Wilén el al. (2000). The bound EPS extracted by the CER method was analysed in the same manner as the loosely bound EPS. The pronase E treated flocs contained significantly higher concentrations of humic substances and proteins (p<0.05) (Figure 17). Similar to the loosely bound EPS, the proteinase K treated flocs resulted in a significantly higher concentration of humic substances (p50.05) (Figure 19). The proteinase K treated flocs also contained a higher concentration of proteins, however, it was not statistically significant. An increase in the concentration of proteins in bound EPS may be caused by the presence of the enzymes in flocs. Alternatively, hydrophobic proteins in the loosely bound EPS might bind to the bound EPS via hydrophobic interactions. Some fraction o f proteins in EPS was found to be hydrophobic due to amino acids with hydrophobic side groups (.lorand el al., 1998). Lastly, the enzyme treatments might cause an increase in extractable proteins in the CER method. Some studies observed the inefficiency of the CER method to extract proteins (including enzymes) from activated sludge flocs (Frolund el n/., 1996; Gessesse el al., 2003). For example, Frolund el al. (1996) demonstrated that 50% of total proteins in activated sludge floe were extractable protein by the CER method (Frolund el

ol., 1996). In the present study, it may be possible that added enzymes digested non-extractable
proteins, which became extractable by the CER method. The increase in the humic substances concentration might have occurred because humic substances became more easily extracted due to the enzyme treatments. A study by Keilding and Nielsen (1997) suggested that humic substances are generally weakly linked to the EPS matrix. Interestingly, a high concentration of humic substances in the enzyme treated floe seems to be related to dissociation of flocs.

78

According to DLVO theor>', high negative charge density o f the humic substances may have led to higher repulsive forces between molecules in flocs (Jin e! al., 2003; Liao et al., 2001 ; Wilén et

al., 2003). In particular, Wilén et al. (2003) observed a negative correlation between the
concentration o f humic substances and reflocculation. In the same study, a positive correlation between the concentration of protein and reflocculation was found. The importance of protein in flocculation was also observed in the study by Higgins and Novak (1997) and in the present study, where the digestion of proteins from flocs led to the dissociation of flocs. In the present study, the enzyme treatment of flocs appears to generally result in the dissociation of some flocs based on the effect of both the increased humic acid and protein concentrations. 5.2. Microscopic Observ ation of Extracellular Polymeric Substances Microscopic observation is very useful because it reveals the non-destructed distribution o f EPS composition and colocalization of EPS components. This gives useful infonnation about the role o f EPS composition in the physicochemical characteristics of flocs. 5.2.1. Mapping of Extracellular Polymeric Substances 5.2.1.1. Nucleic Acids, Lipid-hydrophobic Sites and Protein Floe samples were treated with 1000 pg/ml EDTA for 135min and then treated with proteinase K for 120 min (this treatment is called EDTA-K treatment). Pronase E was not used because it seemed to contain carbohydrates (data is shown in the Appendix E). After the treatment, EDTA, EDTA-K and control floe samples were stained with dyes, Syto 61, Nile Red and SyproOrange, which are specific to nucleic acids, lipids-hydrophobic sites and protein. The stained samples were observed under CLSM. Nucleic acids appear blue, lipid-hydrophobic sites appear red and proteins appear green. In all samples, nucleic acids, lipids-hydrophobic sites and proteins were detected. These macromolecules generally existed heterogeneously, horizontally and vertically throughout the flocs. The macromolecules seem to be localized where dense floe areas were found in the reflectance mode (Figure 20). Further, the colocalization of the macromolecules was also observed. The distribution of each component was observed along with the colocalization examination (Figures 21-23). In general, a high degree o f colocalization of nucleic acids, lipidshydrophobic sites and proteins occurred in all samples. This colocalization o f three

79

macroniolecules appears to occur more frequently at the surface/periphery of the Hoc. The colocalization of pairs of components was also observed. First, the colocalization of nucleic acids and lipid-hydrophobic sites was examined. This colocalization was observed in all samples. Generally, a dense blue colour of nucleic acids covered the whole floe. This indicates that the nucleic acids dye likely stained microorganisms as well as the extracellular nucleic acids. Tims, the nucleic acid stained area was assumed to be equivalent to the bacterial biomass as has been done in other studies which used nucleic acids dye to examine bacterial biomass in biofilm material (Lawrence el al., 1998; Neu and Lawrence, 1999). In this way, the colocalization of nucleic acids and the other macromoleeules (such as lipid-hydrophobic sites (here) and proteins (below)) will reveal the distribution of the other maeromolecule (lipid-hydrophobic or protein sites) throughout the floe. The Nile Red appears to stain many small, localized areas, which seemed to stain extracellular lipids and microorganisms. Lipids are released to the extracellular space when cell lysis occurs and gram-negative bacteria secret integral cellular components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Microorganisms also have lipid-hydrophobic surface membranes, which consist of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (in gram-negative bacteria) (Wingender el al., 1999). Thus, the colocalization of nucleic acids and lipid-hydrophobic sites indicates possible hydrophobic interactions between EPS and microorganisms and between microorganisms. This is in accordance with past studies (Flemming, 2002; Liao el al., 2001; Olofsson el al, 1998; Zita and Hermansson, I997a,b). In the present study, the intense eolocalization of nucleic acids and lipid-hydrophobic sites covered from the surface to the interior of the control and EDTA-K treated floe. This seems to show that most microorganisms were embedded in the EPS matrix by hydrophobic interactions. On the other hand, the less intense colocalization was present in scattered areas of EDTA treated fioc. It might indicate that removal of salt bridges affected the structure of the EPS matrix. Furthermore, all samples contained lipid-hydrophobic sites (i.e. without colocalization with nucleic acids) in the interior of flocs suggesting the hydrophobic nature of the EPS matrix. Tliis is in agreement with the spectroscopic study by Ganaye el al. (1997) showing that the inside of activated sludge flocs contained highly pronounced hydrophobic zones (Ganaye el al, 1997). Interestingly, the degree of colocalization of the EDTA-K seems be similar to that of the control fioc. This seems to contradict the result above showing that hydrophobicity of the enzyme treated flocs was significantly lower than the control fioc (see Physical Analysis Section above). This unusual

80

result might be because the hydrophobicity result obtained in the physical analysis section above was a collective value from various ilocs in a sample (i.e. a mean value from all floe samples), whereas the CLSM observations were focused on a single floe. Since some flocs with dense EPS areas showed resistance to deflocculation by EDTA and proteinase K, it appears that the stability o f these partieular flocs was related to hydrophobic interactions in the EPS matrix. However, not all nucleic acids were covered by lipid-hydrophobic sites, which indicates that some EPS are hydrophilic. This result is in accordance with the study by Jorand et al. (1998). Next, the colocalization of nucleic acids and proteins was examined. SyproOrange appeared to stain large areas of flocs, which seemed to stain extracellular proteins and microbial proteinaceous structure such as S-layer, pili and flagella (Park et ai, 2000). This colocalization might suggest the association of microorganisms with extracellular proteins (enzymes) as well as the presence of proteinaceous structure. This observation is consistent with a study by Gessesse

et ol. (2003) that suggested that the most of part of the enzymes are bound on the cell surface. By
keeping enzymes on or near the surface, cells can have a better access to hydrolysis products for immediate uptake for intracellular metabolism (Gessesse et a i, 20Ô3). In the present study, all samples contained a relatively large degree o f colocalization from the surface to the interior of flocs, which might indicate protein involvement in the EPS matrix. The least degree of colocalization was found in the control floe because the least amount of protein was present. This result was in agreement with the results of chemical analysis indicating that the control floe contained a lower concentration of protein (as bound EPS) than the enzyme treated flocs. On the other hand, the larger degree of colocalization was found in EDTA and EDTA K samples. It may be because the SyproOragne was able to stain due to better accessibility. The treatment of cells by chelating agents (EDTA) and detergents is known to release cell surface bound proteins (Gessesse et a i, 2003). The released bound proteins may be trapped in the EPS matrix, which were more easily stained by SyproOrange. Nevertheless, the dense EPS areas in EDTA and EDTA_K treated flocs contain a large amount of proteins stabilizing the flocs. Despite the expectation that lower protein would be detected in the EDTA-K treated floe due to the enzymatic treatment, EDTA-K treated floe appeared to contain as much protein as the control (Figures 22 and 23). In addition, proteins without the colocalization with nucleic acids were also found around nucleic acids stained areas in all samples. In particular, EDTA-K treated floe

81

contained intense protein stained areas, some of which might be attributed by the added enzymes present in flocs. Lastly, the colocalization of protein and lipid-hydrophobic sites was examined. This type ol colocalization shows hydrophobic proteins in Ilocs. Hydrophobic proteins are important because proteins are suggested to be involved in hydrophobic interactions for formation, stability of Ilocs and bacterial adherence (Wingender et al, 1999). Similar to the other types of colocalization, a relatively large colocalization was found in all samples. Most of the proteins seem to be hydrophobic in the control floe. This is also in agreement with the observation by Gessesse ct al. (2003) that proteins (enzymes) were attached to the floe components (e.g. the cell wall of indrvidual cells) predominantly by hydrophobic interactions (Gessesse et al, 2003). The lower amount o f hydrophobic proteins in the EDTA-K floe and the least amount of hydrophobic and a fairly large amount of hydrophilic proteins were found in the EDTA treated floe. These results may be related to the treatment of cells by the EDTA treatment, which disrupted hydrophobic interactions and release cell surface bound proteins (Gessesse et al., 2003). In addition, these results also appear to be linked to the results for the dissociation constant (see above), which showed that the control floe was the most stable floe in this study. The differing amounts o f hydrophobic protein between EDTA and EDTA-K floe might be related to the ability o f the EDTA-K to rellocculate. The greater the amount of hydrophobic protein, the more likely is the chance to have rellocculation, which might be the case in the EDTA-K treatment. 5.2.1.2. Lectin-conjugated Dyes Extracellular carbohydrates arc also suggested to maintain the Hoc structure by forming the EPS matrix (Wolfaardt et al., 1999). In order to examine distribution of extracellular carbohydrate components in flocs, lectin-conjugated dyes ConA, WGA and SBA were used. The lectin-conjugated dyes are specific to carbohydrate residues; ConA is specific to mannopyranosyl (Man) and glucopyranosyl (Glc) residues, WGA is specific to A^-acetylglucosaminyl residues (GlcNAc) and SBA is specific to TV^acetylgalactosaminyl (GalNAc) and galactopyranosyl (Gal) residues. The stained fioc samples were observed under CLSM. ConA appears blue, WGA appears red and SBA appears green (Figure 24,25 and 26). In all samples, ConA, WGA and SBA were all detected. WGA was a dominant component and was distributed widely from the floe surface to the interior of fioc. Similar to WGA, other stained areas generally

82

existed heterogeneously, horizontally and vertically throughout the flocs however, each stain was also observed in localized and discrete areas. The different stain patterns of indicate heterogeneous production of extracellular material within the Hoc population (Strathmann el al., 2002). In this section, the distribution of each stained area is examined. In the control Hoc, ConA bound to very small areas, which were found mostly along the periphery o f the Hoc. WGA bound to a relatively large area, which seemed to cover from the periphery to the interior of the Hoc. WGA also appears to have stained inside o f ConA. Similar to ConA, SBA bound to small areas that scattered around the periphery of Hoes, some of which were overlapped with WGA but rarely ConA. In the EDTA treated Hoc, WGA had a similar distribution pattern as that in the control, however, it seems that ConA and SBA bound-o more areas. In the EDTA-K treated Hoc, ConA and WGA had a similar distribution pattern as those in the control, however, SBA also seemed to bind to a larger area. Thus, SBA in both non-control samples showed a more diffusive and cloud-like staining pattern. An increase in SBA bound to EPS may be related to these treatments that generally dissociated tlocs. There are two possible causes. One cause is that greater amount of the dye reached the internal of Hoes due to the smaller size. The other cause might be related to the removal of divalent cations and digesting of protein. The removal of cations and proteins might have led to better lectin binding. It might indicate an EPS structure in which protein is around the carbohydrates. Interestingly, a known fibril structure, the cell appendages o f Myxococcm .xanthus, is suggested to be a carbohydrate backbone coated with protein. The fibrils are suggested to be involved in the cell-cell cohesion (Behmlander and Dworkin, 1994). The current results seem to indicate that a similar structure occurs in EPS but further study is needed. Contrary to the current study, ConA used in other studies has shown a cloud-like (diffusive) pattern, which was suggested to be associated with microcolonies and bacterial cell clusters. In addition, ConA was also observed in spaces between bacterial cells, indicating the presence o f EPS (Neu el al., 2001 ; Strathmann el a!., 2002). When the ConA staining pattern in the current study was compared to the nucleic acid staining in the control Hoc in the section above, the ConA did not seem to be associated with microcolonies. Instead, the ConA might have stained mannopyranosyl and glucopyranosyl residues in EPS. Since the WGA staining pattern was similar to the nucleic acid staining pattern, WGA seems to bind to cell surface structures. WGA binding to cell surface structures has been reported to be a characteristic of

83

Gram-positive bacteria, where the peptidoglycan-containing cell walls (containing GlcNAc and //-acetylnuramic acid (NeuNAc) can be exposed directly to the external medium and are easily accessible for lectin binding. In addition, it has been reported that leakage or release of the cell component from the periplasmic space to the cell surface can occur during biofilm development (Strathmann et ai, 2002). Furthermore, it is also observed that WGA stained not only bacteria but also spaces between bacteria (Lawrence et a i, 1998). SBA might have stained the cell surface structures and the GalNAc and Gal residues in EPS. It is known that both sugar compounds are found in bacterial surface structure such as in peptidoglycan and LPS, which might bé indicated by the colocalization of WGA and SBA.

5.3. Association of jElycZ/t'/'/c/////cr>//0157:117 with Flocs It has been suggested that Ilocs are potentially resistant to dissociation (deflocculation) due to additional stability provided by EPS in the flocs. This additional stability of flocs might allow the flocs to act as transport for pathogens in an aquatic environment. The above sections deal with this concept from the floe side but it is also important to investigate from the pathogen side. In the following, the term EHEC refers to E. coli 0157:H7. In particular, two points were investigated, i) Does EHEC adhere to flocs and does the adherence to flocs lead to increased survival? ii) Do adherent EHEC still retain the capability of infection in such environments. In this study, the survival of pathogenic EHEC in various water types containing flocs is examined. Moreover, the pathogenicity of free-living and adherent EHEC that were extracted from flocs Was also investigated. 5.3.1. Survival of Esc/tencltia coli 0157:117 in Water Water samples containing SBR flocs in PBS buffer, SBR with nutrients replenished (called NSBR), and SBR were inoculated with 10* CFU/ml EHEC. The number of EHEC (both free-living and adhered to flocs) in each water sample was estimated by plate count for a period o f 10 days. This experiment was conducted twice (Tables 9 and 10). In all samples, EHEC was found in two forms, free-living and adherent to flocs. The difference between these two forms probably depends on the surface hydrophobicity of EHEC in a population. In the present study, free-living EHEC was likely to have a hydrophilic surface and adherent EHEC to flocs was likely to have a hydrophobic surface. According to the observation by Olofsson et ai (1998), E. coli 0157: H7 population had heterogeneous hydrophobicity and

84

more hydrophobic bacteria generally adhered in higher numbers to sludge Ilocs. By contrast, less hydrophobic bacteria tended to remain free-living fomis (Olofsson el al., 1998). Furthemiore, some fraction o f EHEC used in the present experiment might have become more hydrophobic and adhered to Ilocs since the bacterial growth conditions are thought to affect the hydrophobicity of bacteria. Burnett el al. (2000) suggested that E. coli cells grown in a nutrientlimited medium were more hydrophobic than cells grown in tiy'ptie soy broth (rich nutrient medium), probably due to changes in bacterial membrane fatty acid composition that are brought about by the nutrient-limited environment (Burnett el al., 2000). EHEC also shov/ed a gradual decrease in the viable cell counts, regardless o f the type of EHEC, adhered to flocs and in free-living form, or type of water in all samples. The gradual decrease in the viable cell counts might be caused by lower nutrient levels, predation (grazing pressure) and competition by native microflora (Brettar and Hofle, 1992; Gerba and McLeod, 1976; LaLiberte and Grimes, 1982, Wang and Doyle, 1997). In the present study, higher number of adherent EHEC survived than free-living EHEC in all samples. Higher survival of adherent EHEC is consistent with findings by other studies that found higher concentrations of coliforms (indicator organism) and enteric pathogenic bacteria existed in sediments than in the overlaying water. These studies also found that non-patliogenic adherent E. coli was capable of utilizing nutrients adsorbed to estuarine sediments (including flocs) so that E. coli persisted longer when sediment was present (Brettar and Hofle, 1992; Gerba and McLeod, 1976; LaLiberte and Grimes, 1982). In addition, sediments were suggested to provide protection from predation since bacterial grazers were not able to graze on large (sediment) particles (Brettar and Hofle, 1992). However, in the present experiment, the number of surviving EHEC in the two forms was not significantly different (p<0.05). There might be two possible reasons. The first is that free-living as well as adherent EHEC were able to obtain nutrients from flocs. During 10 days incubation, flocs were degrading in PBS buffer and SBR due to lack o f nutrients. Since the degradation of floe causes dissociation of flocs, nutrients such as carbohydrates were released from flocs into the bulk water. The release of carbohydrates from dissociated flocs was observed in the EPS chemical analysis of the present study and other studies (Higgins and Novak, 1997; Keiding and Neilsen, 1997). Furthermore, a COM micrograph taken at 10 days incubation revealed the degraded flocs suspended in PBS buffer (Figure 28). Compared to the flocs suspended in NSBR, PBS flocs appear to be thinner and

85

without distinct EPS areas. Thus,.some free-living EHEC may have been able to survive by obtaining some nutrients released from flocs. The second reason is that starvation may have caused free-living EHEC to go through physiological changes such as decreased respiration rate and loss of reproduction ability in order to protect themselves against environmental stresses (Ozkanca and Flint, 1997). Since nutrient level is one of the important factors for the survival of EHEC, the effect of nutrients on survival was also examined by placing EHEC in PBS buffer, NSBR and SBR containing flocs. Both adherent and free-living EHEC in the PBS buffer sample showed significantly higher level of survival at the 10-day incubation than that in NSBR and SBR samples (p<0.05). Unexpectedly, the lowest nutrient level o f the PBS buffer showed the highest EHEC survival. This might be related to a form of nutrients available in PBS. The released nutrients from degrading flocs may be the form easily utilized by EHEC. Past studies observed that nutrients bound to the fresh sediment material in PBS buffer were easily released and utilized by non-pathogenic E. coli (Gerba and McLeod, 1976; Hendricks, 1970). Even though nutrient was added to NSBR, it did not seem to have improved the survival of EHEC. This might be because SBR and NSBR could not support the EHEC growth such that more EHEC died than that could be replaced by the reproduction rate. As the next step, the number of EHEC adhered to dense EPS areas in flocs were also estimated. Since adherent EHEC showed higher survival than the free-living fonn, adherent EHEC on the more stable EPS areasTnay be able to persist in water for extended periods of time and increase the infection risk. To estimate the adherent EHEC to EPS, the flocs with adhered EHEC were further treated with proteinase K. This part of the experiment was conducted from 4 days incubation because it has been reported that the bulk o f EHEC was detected on sediment particles after 3 days from inoculation (Brettar and Hofle, 1992). It was found that the NSBR had a significantly higher percentage o f adherent EHEC to the EPS area than other samples (p<0.05) (Figure 39). It might be because larger dense EPS areas in NSBR flocs would be resistant to proteinase K treatment so that it is likely that a higher number of adherent EHEC was isolated from these areas. This indicates the importance of floe stability because stable flocs are able to provide a stable area for EHEC survival. Thus, the addition of nutrients retained dense EPS areas ond floe stability, which supported EHEC survival (Wingender ei al, 1999; Wolfaardt et al., 1999).

5.3.2. Direct Observation of Adherent Escherichia coli 0157:117 by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy CLSM is very useful to observe the spatial distribution ofEMEC in llocs in conjunction with the observation of the EPS composition. Water samples containingl 0* CFU/ml El lEC were incubated with floes suspended in PBS buffer, NSBR and SBR. First, the distribution of EMEC in floes suspended in PBS buffer and SBR at the 2-days incubation was investigated (Figure 2932). Floes in NSBR were not examined at this stage since the first nutrient was added at 2-day incubation. In both samples, most adherent EFIEC appear to locate at/near the surface of floes, which are coincident with hydrophobic lipid sites and hydrophobic proteins observed in the EPS mapping (shown above). It might suggest that EHEC adhesion occurred via hydrophobic interaction. In particular, hydrophobic interaction seems to be involved in the SBR llocs since most EHEC in the SBR were found on the top of the dark dense EPS area. In all samples, EHEC generally dispersed individually in floes, which might indicate that EHEC did not reproduce as much due to the stressful environment. Second, the distribution o f EHEC in floes suspended in PBS buffer, NSBR and SBR at 7day incubation were observed (Figure 33-38). In all samples, the distribution of EHEC seems to spread inward into the floes. This is consistent to the finding by Olofsson et al. (1998) that adhered cells were found not only on the surface o f floes but also in the interior of the Hoc (Olofsson et al, 1998). This suggests that adherent EHEC migrated toward dense EPS areas because EPS are known to provide nutrients and protection (Tsuneda et al, 2003; Wingender et

a l, 1999; Wolfaardt et a l, 1999). Interestingly the distribution of EHEC in NSBR seems to be
limited compared to that in the PBS buffer. The adherent EHEC colonies and individual cells in NSBR llocs seem to associate with the border between dense EPS areas and the remainder of the llocs. The degree of EHEC distribution might be related to the Hoc conditions such that PBS floes were generally degraded while NSBR floes seemed to be more stable with dense EPS areas. These different floe conditions would exhibit a different diffusion rate in the inside of llocs. Since the dense EPS areas in NSBR floes were likely to have a slower diffusion rate of nutrients and oxygen delivery to adhered cells, the deep interior of dense EPS areas would not be an optimal environment for EHEC (Wolfaardt et a l, 1999). On the other hand, floes in PBS buffer had a loose structure without dense EPS areas. In such floe structures, diffusion rate would be similar to that of water, which makes bacteria to obtain nutrients and oxygen easier (Wolfaardt et

87

«/., 1999). Thus, adherent EHEC in PBS buffer might have largely dispersed through these llocs. Interestingly, in all samples at 7-day incubation, colonies as well as individual EHEC were observed, which might show that EHEC had some ability to adapt to the stressful environment. 5.3.3. Escherichia coli 0157:H7 Extracted from Floe Samples Since EHEC was able to persist in water samples, it is important to investigate if these EHEC retain pathogenicity. The pathogenicity was examined based on a-actinin accumulation in epithelial HEp-2 cells. In this study, the effect of three factors on pathogenicity were examined: i) the type o f EHEC (free-living or in floes), ii) nutrient level in water samples (PBS buffer, NSBR and SBR) and iii) incubation times in the water samples (2- or 10-days). Furthermore, the patterns o f EHEC adherence and a-accumulation were also examined. 5.3.3.]. Immunofluorescent Assay In the present study, two aspects of pathogenicity were examined. First is a level of host adhesion ability, which depends on expression of adhesions. Second is a level of a-actinin accumulation (foci of a-actinin), which depends on host adhesion as well as expression of other virulence factors. EHEC recovered from the water samples were generally able to adhere to and infect epithelial cells after 4 h incubation (Figure 39). Compared to the positive control, EHEC grown in a rich nutrient medium, EHEC in most water samples had significantly lower levels of host adherence and a-actinin accumulation except forlO_SF and 10_SS (host adhesion level) and 2_SF, 10_BS, 10_SF and 10_SS (a-actinin accumulation) (p<0.05). In general, it seems that pathogenicity of EHEC recovered from the water samples was somehow affected. When the EHEC type on the pathogenicity was examined, it does not seriously seem to affect the pathogenicity in the present study based on the following results. First, the free-living EHEC showed both higher and lower level o f the pathogenicity than the fioc-adherent EHEC. Second, floe-adherent EHEC did not show significantly higher levels of host adhesion ability and asctinin accumulation than free-living EHEC (p<0.05). This may be because all EHEC recovered from the water samples were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) prior to the infection and observation in the immunofluorescent assay. It seems that DMEM stimulated the adherence of EHEC by increasing the expression of the Locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) encoded genes such as espA, espD and tir since this nutrient-rich medium containing

88

HCOs' ions provided an optimal growth environment similar to human intestine (Abe et a!., 2002). Next, the water samples with different nutrient levels were eompared. It was found that only Hoc-adherent EHEC incubated in SBR for 10 days (IO_SF) appeared to have significantly higher levels of host adhesion ability and a-actinin accumulation than the NBSR sample (10_NF) (p<0.05). This may suggest that the effect of the nutrient level of the water samples was also insignificant on the pathogenicity. This result may shows that less metabolically active EHEC (due to low nutrient levels) was able to easily respond to optimal growth conditions (DMEM medium). Lastly, the effect of incubation time in the water samples (2 or 10-days) on pathogenicity was examined. Unexpectedly, EHEC from the longer incubation time had higher levels of host adhesion ability and a-actinin accumulation. This seems to be contrary to an earlier study that reported that pathogenic E. coli (such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)) isolated from environments (non-treated water, such as recreational lakes, dams, mines, rivers and wells) had lost its virulence-related genes (Valentini et al., 1992). This unexpected result might be related to EHEC adaptation to the environment since it is known that bacteria go through morphological and physiological changes for their survival (Ozkanca and Flint, 1997). In order to examine the EHEC ability to cause infection, the ratio of a-actinin accumulation to bacterial adhesion was compared (Table 11). These results show that the infection ability of EHEC recovered from the water samples was not significantly different from that from the control (p<0.05). This may suggest that EHEC from the water samples retained the similar level of ability to express type 111 secretion effectors once the host adhesion occurred. Furthermore, the infection ability appears to be unchanged with respect to the type of EHEC (floe adherent or free-living), water sample type or incubation time (?<0.05). These results were important because it suggests that EHEC retain their infection ability even in the unfavourable growth condition such as natural environments. Overall, EHEC adhering to floes and, in particular EPS areas, survived for longer periods o f time than free-living EHEC. Even though the surviving EHEC exhibited a decreased host adhesion ability, the infection ability of EHEC was not affected once host adhesion occurred. The fact that any surviving EHEC remained infectious is significant due to the low infectious dose of this EHEC strain.

CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of floes in transport and survival o f Escherichia co// 0157:117 (EHEC) via adherence to floes in a nutrient deprived environment. In particular, three objectives were examined. First, the relationship between floe properties and EPS was investigated. Second, the distribution of components in EPS was examined. Lastly, survival and pathogenicity of EHEC in floes suspended in water samples was investigated. The main conclusions drawn from this study are:

1. Removal o f salt bridging and disruption of hydrophobic interactions did not completely dissociate floes because EPS might be resistant to chemical and enzymatic dissociation.

2. Digestion of protein by enzymes released carbohydrate from floes into the surrounding bulk water, which indicates the disruption of protein-carbohydrate interaction in the EPS matrix.

3. Individual EPS components seem to be involved in floe characteristics. Proteins in the EPS matrix contribute to stability o f floes via hydrophobic interactions and affect surface characteristics of floe, such as negative surface charge and hydrophobicity. An increase  in humic substances in the EPS matrix might cause a dissociation of floes.

4. CLSM analysis revealed a high degree of colocalization of nucleic acids, lipidhydrophobic sites and proteins in control, EDTA and EDTA - proteinase K treated floes. Colocalization indicates the hydrophobic interaction between EPS and microorganisms and between microorganisms as well as the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic EPS.

5. CLSM analysis also showed that A^-acetylglucosaminyl residues were the dominant carbohydrates in all samples. The vV-acetylglucosaminyl residues bind to EPS as well as to cell surface structures. EDTA and EDTA- proteinase K treatment showed a larger area of A/-acetylgalactosaminyl and galactopyranosyl residues in EPS.

6. EHEC survived in low nutrient water for 10 days. Adherence to llocs improved the survival rate because the llocs seemed to provide nutrients and protection. The CLSM analysis showed that EHEC was distributed from the surface to the interior of the llocs. In particular, EHEC adherence to EPS areas is significant because the more stable EPS area allowed EHEC to persist in water for a longer time. This increases the infection risk.

7. Even EHEC grown in low nutrient water for 10 days were able to adhere to epithelial cells and cause infection. However, the EHEC did show a decreased ability to adhere to epithelial cells and a-actinin accumulation (pathogenicity).

8. EHEC grown in low nutrient water for the longer incubation time showed a higher level o f pathogenicity than that for the shorter incubation time. This may be due to EHEC adaptation to the environment but further study is needed to verify.

9. Adhesion to epithelial cells is an important trait since it is the precursor of infection. Once the host adhesion occurred, the level of a-actinin accumulation caused by EHEC grown in low nutrient water was as high as that by the EHEC grown in a rich nutrient medium.

As described above, this study focused on floe properties, and in particular EPS, and their role in survival of EHEC. The significance of this study was to examine not only the association o f EHEC with floes but also the fate of pathogenicity when EHEC were grown in a nutrient deprived environment. This study has provided the above important conclusions, however, some o f the experiments could be improved. In this study, the experimental approach contained three major parts. The first part was the analysis o f floe characterization. The second part was the EPS mapping using CLSM. The last part was the survival of EHEC in association with floes. In the first part, it would be easier to characterize EPS if the enzymes used are replaced with other chemical agents such as 0.5 % Triton X-100 (Gessesse et a l, 2003) since the presence o f the added enzymes might have affected the measurement of floe properties and EPS

91

composition. Use of Triton X-IOO was expected to detach enzymes bound on the surface of cells or adsorbed in the EPS matrix with little or no cell disruption (Gessesse et ah, 2003). In the second part, other types or various combinations of lectin dyes and other stains could be explored in order to better observe the colocalization of these macromolecules (such as nucleic acids, lipid-hydrophobic sites and protein). In this study, nucleic acid could have been used with lectin dyes in order to better indicate the relationship between microorganisms and carbohydrate distribution. In the last part, the EHEC survival experiment could be extended since the EHEC remained-pathogenicity even after 10 days o f low nutrient growth condition. It would be useful to determine if pathogenicity continues for a longer time period. This study can also be developed into various new directions. First, it may be useful to have an experimental setting that is more relevant to natural environments. For example, the experimental approach used in this study might be applied to a new study using lake water with lake sediment. In such a study, not only the survival of EHEC in floes and fate of pathogenicity but also the effect of competition with natural microflora and predation can be examined. The results of the new study might lead to a modeling of EHEC contamination in the environment. Next, the fate of pathogenicity might be examined by different methods. In this study, pathogenicity was indirectly examined using immunolluorescence a-actinin assay. This method >s easy and simple, however, it only shows the phenotypic characteristics. Alternatively, DNA niicroarray technology could be used to allow for simultaneous examination of the virulence genes and their expression (Chizhikov et al., 2001). Thus, the relationship between multiple virulence genes would be revealed. This type of study will show the mechanisms of virulence factors when EHEC are present in a low nutrient condition (equivalent to natural environmental condition) for a long time. It might also indicate when EHEC lose its pathogenicity since some studies reported that pathogenic E. coli (such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)) isolated from environment (non-treated water-recreational lakes, dams, mines, rivers and wells) had lost its ''irulence-related genes (Valentini et al., 1992).

(a ) EDTA treated flocs. Floe sample was treated with lOOOpg/ml EDTA for 105 min (4 EDTA washings). Flocs were observed under phase contrast x 100. Scale bar = 250pm. Most flocs were completely deflocculated into irregular and diffused flocs by EDTA (a), however, some flocs were dissociated to smaller flocs that became a size of EPS (b). Note that flocs contained dominant EPS areas (dark areas). In addition, large flocs were also observed (c).

Control Floe sample was treated with O.IM PBS for 105 min (4 PBS washings). Flocs were observed under phase contrast x 100. Scale bar = 250pm. Rounded and firm Control flocs with dominant EPS area were observed.

Similar to EDTA treated flocs, most flocs were completely deflocculated into irregular and diffused flocs (a) however, some flocs dissociated into smaller flocs that were approximately the size of EPS in the original flocs (b and c). Note that those flocs contained dominant EPS areas (dark areas). Furthermore, some flocs appear to be composed of branches of dense EPS areas (c).
