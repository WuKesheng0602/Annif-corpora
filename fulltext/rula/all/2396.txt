Abstract
Radio Frequency Identi cation (RFID) and Wi-Fi WLANs have achieved widespread applicability in different application domains. However, tag range of RFID systems is very short. Hence, integrating RFID with WLAN networks can contribute to wider application of RFID since Wi-Fi nodes have much larger communication range. However, both RFID and WLAN use the same frequency band and incurs interference by each other for channel utilization. In this thesis, an ef cient approach to solve the coexistence and integration problem of RFID and Wi-Fi WLAN is proposed. This solution allows these networks to access the medium in a time sharing manner by making the WLAN Access Point (AP) aware of the RFID neighboring network at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Thus, it is possible to locate and identify the RFID tags in the physical space, with co-located Wi-Fi WLANS. Simulation results show that both networks work together by maintaining the performance such as higher throughput and lower collision probability, as is desired.

Introduction

Background information, motivation, research statement, proposed solution and contribution are brie y presented in the following sections.

1.1

Background

Recently, Radio Frequency Identi cation (RFID) and IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) technologies have achieved widespread applicability in different application areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, public transportation, telecommunications, airline bagging and are considered as an alternative of barcode system in the distribution industry adn access control. Thus, using RFID technology increases the security in identi cation of a product. Moreover, RFID technology is simple, easy to use, and provides faster communication speed and hence, reduces processing time, increases productivity and improves the quality of service. RFID technology work at the 2.45 GHz Industrial Scienti c Medical Band (ISM) and uses radio frequency to transfer data between readers and tags.

Chapter 1: Introduction

RFID tags are placed into objects such as cars, products in grocery stores. RFID readers in the vicinity of a tag read tag's data whenever is required. However, there is still no standard published for RFID. IEEE is working on a standard called IEEE 802.15.4f, which is still under processing. They adopt the IEEE 802.15.4 Zigbee protocol for the active RFID that is specially designed for low cost and low power applications. On the other hand, the IEEE 802.11 standard de nes one Media Access Control (MAC) and several physical layer speci cations for WLANs connectivity for xed, portable, and

movable stations that require rapid deployment. The MAC procedure supports quality of service (QoS) requirements of the local area networks applications such as transport of voice, audio and video. This standard allows computers to communicate three physical layer speci cations: two in the 2.4-GHz band (ISM) and one in the infrared, all operating at 1 and 2 Mbps. The IEEE 802.11 logical architecture contains several components: Station (STA), Wireless Access Point (AP), Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS), Basic Service Set (BSS), Distribution System (DS), and Extended Service Set (ESS). Some of these components map directly to hardware devices, such as stations STAs and wireless APs. The wireless STA contains an adapter card, PC Card, or an embedded device to provide wireless connectivity. The wireless AP functions as a bridge between the wireless STAs and the existing network backbone for network access. The ordinary nodes within WLAN use the basic medium access protocol, namely, Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) having 4-way RTS/CTS handshaking mechanism to access the medium. DCF is a contention based mechanism and easy to implement. However, many studies [24] suggest that DCF is quite inef cient and can be improved by Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) to provide the QoS in the networks. Another access control mechanism, Point Co-

ordination Function (PCF) is used to access the medium with controlled delay. PCF works by polling scheme where, a single station gets the uninterrupted time to access the medium. All other stations are polled by round robin fashion and get the chance to transfer the frame. The detailed frame structure of PCF, DCF, and EDCA will be discussed with their working mechanism in Chapter 3. RFID network uses the IEEE 802.15.4 Zigbee protocol. work in the ISM 2.4 GHz frequency band. Figure Both Zigbee and WLAN

1.1 illustrates the available channels

for WLAN and Zigbee standards. Channels 11 to 26 (16 channels) are allocated to LRWPANs. Each channel has a bandwidth of 2 MHz and is separated by 5 MHz in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band. Orthogonal Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (O-QPSK) technique is used as a transmit scheme with the transmission rate of 250 Kbps. The channel usage depends on the regulatory domain [17] for WLAN. On the other hand, the IEEE

802.11 standard de nes 14 channels. Most of the adjacent channels are partially overlapped as shown in Figure 1.1. Thus, channel interference might occur when two or more 802.11 nodes operate using the adjacent channels. In USA and Canada, 11 channels are used each having a bandwidth of 22 MHz in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The IEEE 802.11b standard recommends using non overlapping channels 1, 6 and 11 for North America. Channels 13 and 14 are not used that allows LR-WPAN channels to operate without any interference of Wi-Fi (Figure 1.1). However, the 2.4 GHz applications allow larger bandwidth and more channels. Table 1.1 summarizes some of the important properties of the wireless standards that work in the 2.4GHz frequency band.

Thesis Motivation

Tag range that measures the performance of RFID system is the maximum distance a RFID reader can either read or write information at the tag. According to the US regulation for ISM 2.45 GHz microwave sub-band, tags can cover up to 11 meters, whereas it is 30 meters for the 860-960 MHz ultra high frequency sub-band. Wi-Fi WLAN can cover the larger area upto to hundred meters. Due to the short reading range of RFID readers they cannot read RFID tag's from a distant place and thus, cannot be used for many large scale applications. To alleviate this problem RFID networks can be integrated with Wi-Fi WLAN to increase the network coverage because of their large transmission range and power. This would also contribute to even wider applications of RFID, including areas such as security, public safety, emergency responses and health care, where RFID is currently not used due to the problems outlined above. However, both WLAN and RFID networks use the same unlicensed free ISM bands 2.4 GHz frequency band. Working in the same frequency bands results the interference and co-existence problems between the IEEE 802.15.4 Zigbee and 802.11 WLAN standards that requires to be managed and controlled properly to ensure the desired performance requirements. Existing solutions to the co-existence and integration problems rely on readers to be integrated with the Access Point (AP) and are not considered ef cient. Moreover,

6

Chapter 1: Introduction

the IEEE 802.11 DCF MAC protocol does not provide Quality of Service (QoS)and performance degrade at heavy data traf c load. DCF controlled stations have same priority to access the medium and use same distributed interframe space (DIFS) value so there are no differences among the data traf c. Figure 1.2 demonstrates the physical proximity

collision domain of RFID and WLAN network.

1.3

Research Statement

The proposed research statement is how to provide quality of service (QoS) such as higher throughput, lower collision probability while integrating Wi-Fi WLAN with RFID network so that a large network area can be covered to extend the application domain of RFID networks. Thus, the proposed research would develop a framework to solve

WLAN/RFID co-existence and integration problem using existing hardware, which is compatible with the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. Thus, this solution would be economically feasible and readily applicable in practice.

1.4

Solution Approach

To solve the proposed research problem and achieve QoS, we design and implement an approach that uses a two tiered network architecture: (i)RFID networks and (ii) WiFi WLAN. This approach works using Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) between WLAN and RFID. In the rst tier, RFID tags send data to RFID readers using the IEEE exible and universal functionality than

802.15.4 Zigbee protocol. Zigbee provides more

other available wireless standards. An alternative of Zigbee can be slotted ALOHA but it

Chapter 1: Introduction

is trends to be less adoptive to the load.In the second tier of Wi-Fi WLAN, RFID readers integrate two networks and work as special WLAN node having higher priority to extend the RFID transmission range. The IEEE 802.11 PCF protocol is used which allows contention free access and contention based access of the medium. More speci cally, RFID networks mainly work in the Contention Free Period (CFP) of PCF and WLAN remains in sleep mode during this period. In the DCF or Contention Period (CP), readers of RFID network and Wi-Fi nodes compete to win the medium to transfer their frames to the AP. The IEEE 802.11 protocol provides QoS by introducing the IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism. Thus, we would use EDCA instead of DCF to achieve QoS. In the EDCA protocol, we assume that stations have two different priorities to access the medium. Readers (special station) have the highest priority and WLAN STAs have the lowest priority. We measure the performance of these proposed framework to observe how both networks work together and maintain the performance as required level.

1.5

Thesis Contribution

We simulate the proposed scheme using the Artifex simulator tool and measure its performance in terms of different QoS metrics such as throughput, frame collision probability, frame access delay, average backoff phase, and access probability. From the simulation results, we nd the proposed scheme achieves the network accuracy as the desired level when

readers work as the highest priority station and Wi-Fi nodes as the lower priority station. This represents our contribution to alleviate the co-existence and interference problems between RFID and Wi-Fi networks.

Background and Related work

2.1

Related Work

Integration of RFID and WLAN has been heavily investigated recently [12] [13] [15] [39]. Existing solutions do not solve the coexistence problem in a satisfactory manner. Some solutions rely on the readers being integrated with the Access Point (AP) [39]. This increases the network complexity and cost and limits the RFID network coverage. If the coexistence and integration problem is solved this would facilitate the development of much needed RFID applications. This would also allow the use of existing available hardware that makes the system economically feasible. The work done in paper [39] suggests three types of network integration architecture. These are: (i) smart stations mixed with RFID readers and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) base stations, (ii) network with RFID readers and WSN base station deployment, and (iii) a smart active tag network architecture. The rst case limits the number of reader being

integrated whereas for the second case, integration increases the number of readers in the

networks.

For the third case, data is transmitted among the tags before transmitting to exible to use. However, the integration method is selected

readers that makes it more

based on the cost and application requirements. In our proposed scheme, readers are not integrated with the AP. Hence, the network complexity and cost are reduced. Active tags are used in our proposed framework that cover a large communication area. The work done in [15], [12] analyze the coexistence impact of an IEEE 802.15.4 network on the IEEE 802.11b devices. In [12], the interference problem between the signals of WPAN (Zigbee) and health care medical equipments is discussed. In [34], channel conict and interference issues of the IEEE 802.11b and 802.15.4 is discussed. The authors of this paper show that if the number of 802.11b networks increases the con ict among channels increases. The work done in [13] discusses the interference and co-existence impact of the IEEE 802.11 and 802.15.4 in terms of throughput. In [28], the authors address the interference problem between WPAN and WLAN in terms of overlapping channels. By simulation they show that about 90% of WPAN frames are destroyed by the interfering WLAN frames. Interference and coexistence problems of Zigbee and WLAN are discussed in paper [27]. They analysis the interference between Zigbee and WLAN by measuring the throughput of the framework. They demonstrate that the Zigbee interference has more effect on IEEE 802.11 uplink communication than that of the downlink communication. They consider Zigbee peer-to-peer network topology that work at 115 kbps data transmission rate. However, in our proposed scheme, we consider the IEEE 802.15.4 star topology network that work at 250 kbps data transmission rate. The work done in [30] proposes a RFID/WLAN integration scheme to solve the problem of location estimation in indoor environment. This scheme estimates the accurate client position. On the other hand, in our

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

proposed scheme, a RFID reader works as a bridge to integrate two networks to send tag IDs to the coordinator. In recent years, the IEEE 802.11 WLAN becomes a dominant technology. The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) that is considered as the main MAC protocol, does not provide any QoS [16] [8] [18]. Hence, the new version of the standard IEEE 802.11e provides QoS by improving the DCF MAC protocol by Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) protocol. Many researchers analyze the performance of the coexistence of DCF and EDCA. In [16], the authors analyze the coexistence problem of DCF and EDCA. They show that QoS stations of EDCA that have lower inter frame space value (AIFS) work better in heavy load than that of the DCF controlled stations. The EDCA protocol provides super QoS performance for real-time applications. In [8], authors analyze the

earlier legacy IEEE 802.11 DCF access method. They measure the performance of both protocols using NS-2 simulation tool. The limitations of DCF protocol are discussed in [18]. Stations working using the DCF protocol have same priority to access the medium and use same Contention Window (CW) value. As a result, stations and their traf c cannot be differentiated and QoS is not maintained. The data frame of DCF is best effort [24], which does not provide QoS. Thus, the performance degrades at heavy load. In our proposed scheme, we consider RFID readers as QoS stations work with ordinary WiFi stations to send their stored data. Thus, the performance of both networks is achieved as is desired.

Radio Frequency Identi cation (RFID)

Radio Frequency Identi cation (RFID) is a fast developing automatic identi cation technique that consists of two components: readers and tags [35]. A tag stores a bit

string in its memory as an identi cation (ID) of an object. The reader can read the IDs of the neighboring tags using a link-layer protocol over the wireless channel. Tags are normally attached or embedded into objects for the identi cation or tracking purposes. Tags work as alternatives to UPC barcode in most common application of RFID, such as supplychain management. By reading all the tag IDs in the neighborhood and then consulting a back-end database that provides a mapping between IDs and objects, the reader learns the existence of the corresponding objects in the neighborhood. RFID tags are classi ed as active, passive and semi passive based on the types of power usage (e.g., electromagnetic, battery. Passive tags: Passive tags have no tag power source and transmitter. They are powered by the signals that are sent by reader to the tags. These tags are cheaper and have shorter reading range, about 4 inches - 15 feet. The power needed for passive tags to transmit their IDs to the interrogating reader is supplied by the reader itself. The reader energizes the tags in the vicinity with Radio Frequency (RF) power continuously for the entire read operation, which consists of a query from the reader and followed by the tag response. For the tag response, part of RF power is transmitted back to the reader (using a process called backscattering) after appropriative modulation and coding via the tag's electronics. The electronics can also perform simple computations and has a small amount of memory.

Semi-Passive tags: They have on tag power source (e.g., batteries) but do not have an on tag transmitter. Thus, tags use the energy transmitted from the reader for communication. Semi-passive tags have greater communication range than that of passive tags. Active tags: These tags use batteries to power the digital logic as well as transmissions. Thus, they have larger communication range as compared to passive tags, at a higher complexity and cost [35]. We plan to use active tags in the proposed research. Based on the radio frequency used RFID systems can be divided into Low Frequency(LF), High Frequency(HF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and Microwave. A summary of the frequency characteristics, transmission rang and their applications are tabulated in table 2.2.

Basic Infrastructure

The purpose of a RFID system is to collect information of objects that are available in a portable device called a tag. Readers collect and process data based on the application requirements. The collected information from tags are location information, product price, color, date of purchase and other application speci c information. Now a days, RFID

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

technology has been used by many companies because of it's ability to track stationary or mobile objects quickly. A basic RFID system consists of three components [1].

1. An antenna or coil.

2. A transceiver (with decoder)

3. A transponder or RFID tag which is electronically programmed with unique information.

Antenna
The antenna emits RF to activate the tag and read/write information from/to the tag. Antenna is connected with the reader. Mainly passive tags are powered by the RF signal transmitted from readers whereas active tag has it's own on-board power.

Figure 2.1: Basic components of RFID system [1]

Reader
To collect data from the tag, RFID readers emit radio wave in the range of one inch to 100 feet or even more that depends on the communication range of tags and also on the ra-

dio frequency used. When tags are within the communication range of readers and receive the electromagnetic(EM) signal it detects the activation signal from the reader. Readers decode data that are encoded in the tag's integrated circuit (silicon chip) and transmit data to the host computer for further processing.

Transponder/Tag
A typical RFID tag is an integrated circuit which is actually a microchip attached to a radio antenna mounted on an object. The chip can store upto 2 kilobytes of data. Figure 2.2 shows the basic sequence of communication between the reader and tag. A reader sends data to a host computer that displays the commands of the reader [40]. The sequence of operation by RFID readers is presented as follows.

Operating principles of RFID systems

There are many different operational methods and several ways in which RFID reader and tag communicate with each other.Passive tags use two different coupling techniques: near and far eld coupling techniques. These techniques are presented as follows.

Near-Field Coupling
The RFID tags having low communication range and low frequency range use near eld coupling techniques. The EM The electric and magnetic eld in the near eld region is reactive in nature [10].

eld are orthogonal and quasi-static. They dominate each other

depending on the type of antenna used. However, passive tags mostly rely on the magnetic eld. Current ows through the coil of the reader and produces a magnetic eld around

it. This magnetic

eld induces the coil of tags to generate a small current. This technique gure ( 2.3). A tag is able to

is based upon Faraday's principle of magnetic induction change the current of its

eld by changing the antenna load. This mechanism is called load

modulation. Readers and tags communicate through this mechanism. Due to the mutual inductance between reader`s coil and tag`s coil any changes to the tag`s current results in

18

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

changes to the reader`s coil. It is a simple technique and used by most of the passive RFID systems. However, a large antenna coil is required for the low frequency band.

Figure 2.3: Near- eld communication using inductive coupling [10]

Far-Field Coupling
The EM eld of far eld coupling is radiative in nature and uses a technique called

backscattering as shown in Figure 2.4. A part of the generated current around the tag`s coil is re ected back due to the mismatch of antenna and load circuit. Far eld coupling is

used by a long range (5-20 meters) and high frequency (860-960 MHz UHF or 2.45 GHz microwave) RFID systems. Far compared to the near eld coupling usees small antennas that reduces cost as

eld coupling techniques.

Tag Memory

Passive tags typically have 64 bits to 1 kilobyte of non-volatile EEPROM memory. However, some passive tags can store up to 1 kilobyte of data on the tag depending on the amount of data required and application purpose. Active tags have 128 kilobytes of SRAM memory. I-Code is a commonly used RFID system [36] where, a tag provides 64-bytes memory that is addressable in blocks of 4 bytes. All blocks are readable but writing to some blocks is protected by a set of bits. This prevents changes to the serial number and similar data. 46 bytes of the memory are used for application data. The remaining 18 bytes are reserved for a serial number, write protection, indicating electronic article surveillance (one bit) and indicating the quiet state of the tag (one bit). The tag cannot communication with the reader if the quiet bit is set.

2.2.4

Programming Interface

The RFID reader device provides the programming interface of the system. It comprises commands for con gurations setting of the reader such as commands for setting the speed of the serial connection, and handling communication with tags that are in the range of readers. Communication commands have the following functionalities. Anti-collision/Select (ACS): On the activation of ACS commands all the tags in the communication range send their serial numbers and become selected as long as they are in the range. If any tag moves out of the range it becomes unselected. Then the tags needs to send the serial number again to become selected. This command can be used to locate the neighboring active tags. It is a prerequisite for writing to tags, since the write command affects only selected tags. However, an ACS cycle takes signi cantly longer period of time. Write: Write command is used to write data to a selected tag indicated by ACS commands. While writing to tags, they cannot move in and out of the range. However, only one data block of 4 bytes can be written at a time. Read: Only the tags selected by ACS commnad can send their data using READ command. Read Unselected: This command is similar to read command. Only difference is that all tags can be triggered without checking their selection status.

RFID Communication protocol: IEEE 802.15.4 or Zigbee

The main objective of a RFID system is to identify tags that are in the communication range of an active reader. There is a possibility of collision among readers if reading range of multiple readers overlaps. Similarly, collision between tags occurs if more than one tag tries to send their id at the same time. To avoid the collision many anti-collision protocols have been proposed such as ALOHA [7], slotted ALOHA protocols [25], tree based

protocols [9], and frame slotted ALOHA [37]. In this thesis, we consider IEEE 802.14.5 or Zigbee protocol as a collision avoidance protocol since it is suitable for low cost and low power applications. We only consider tag-tag collision. The IEEE 802.15.4 technology provides low complexity, low power consumption, low data rate, and energy ef cient battery powered devices. Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are low data rate, and short range wireless networks that build on the IEEE 802.15.4 standards. These networks are mostly infrastructure less and used for applications based on their requirements for data rate, power consumption and QoS. The IEEE 802.15.4 works on three frequency bands: 868 MHz, 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz (Table 2.2). 2.45GHz frequency band is known as ISM band and used by various WPAN standards such as IEEE 802.15.1, 802.15.3 and also by microwave ovens. The maximum data transmission rate of this band is 250 kbps. In WPAN networks, there is a central controller called PAN coordinator that builds personal area networks with other nodes within a small space. PAN coordinator mainly supports two types of topologies: star and pair-to-pair. In star topology, a device must go through PAN coordinator

22

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

to communicate with other devices. In pair-to-pair topology, a device can communicate directly with others if they are in the communication range. In our simulator model, we use the star topology. Devices are classi es based on the level of complexity: Full Functional Device (FFD) and Reduced-Functional Device (RFD). A FFD can function as a PAN coordinator or as a cluster coordinator or as an ordinary device and can communicate with any device of the networks. On the other hand, a RFD can only function as an ordinary device but not as a coordinator and can only communicate with one FFD at a time. RFD is used only for simple applications where individual nodes perform basic communications and have little computational capability.

Star Topology and Beacon Enabled Operation

The way of communication between device to device or device to PAN coordinator depends on whether the network supports beacon or not. The beacon synchronizes the

whole networks transmission procedure. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard de nes two MAC channel access mechanisms: (i) beacon-enabled and (ii) non-beacon-enabled channel ac-

cess. The network with the star topology uses beacon-enabled channel access mechanism. This mechanism is also known as slotted carrier sensed multiple access mechanism with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA). On the other hand, non-beacon-enabled networks use non-slotted CSMA-CA mechanism. In this thesis, we use the beacon-enabled slotted channel access mechanism. The tags are synchronized with the beacon frame after they wake up from sleeping mode. In beacon-enabled mode, the coordinator periodically transmits a beacon frame. The PAN coordinator divides the channel time. The time between two beacon frames is called beacon interval (BI) or superframe. Each superframe starts with a beacon frame and is divided into an active and inactive portion as shown in Figure 2.5. All the devices communicate with their PAN coordinator during the active portion of the superframe. They send their data to the coordinator through uplink transmission and receive data from the coordinator through downlink transmission. After the active portion of the superframe,

the coordinator and individual node goes to the sleep mode to save energy in the inactive portion of the superframe. The active portion of a superframes is equivalent to the superframe duration (SD), where SD cannot be longer than the BI. The active portion of the superframe is divided into a number of equal sized slots. Each slot lasts for exactly 2
SO

[23]. The aBaseSlot Durat ion symbols contains 3 back-

off periods, which is the duration to transmit 20 symbols. The beacon frame is transmitted at the beginning of slot 0 and then the contention access period (CAP) starts. During the CAP, all nodes including the coordinator must use the slotted CSMA-CA channel access mechanism. It is a contention-based channel access mechanism and every device completes for it`s transaction within the CAP period of the current superframe. After the CAP

24

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

period, there is one optional contention free period (CFP), where each device can have guaranteed timeslot to access the medium. The beacon interval and active portion of the superframe duration is controlled by two important MAC parameters: superframe order (SO) and beacon order (BO). The duration (0

is calculated by

using the formula listed in Table 2.3. In the real scenario, the formula is valid only for the values less than and equal to 14. Every synchronized node should listen for the beacon for aBaseSu per f rameDuration * (2

beacon frame is received during this period. The maximum retry limit is 4. Once this limit exceeds, the MAC layer sends the message regarding the loss of synchronization in the higher layer of the protocol stack.

and so, data is only transmitting from nodes to the Access Point but not the vise versa. The working principle of CSMA-CA algorithm is shown in Figure 2.6. The algorithm

starts when the ready queue holds at least a packet to transmit. The value of the following parameters are initialized as follows.

1. Retry count or NB refers to the number of times, a station needs to retry to access the medium when it becomes idle.It is set to 0.

2. Contention Window (CW) refers to the number of backoff periods or slots a station senses the channel to become idle before the packet transmission begins. It is set to 2

3. Backoff exponent BE is the number of backoff times a device should wait before attempting to access the medium. If the device is operating in battery power (i.e., when macBatt Li f eE xt is set to true) the value is set to 2. Otherwise, the value is set to 3.

In this algorithm, transmission occurs only at the boundary of the backoff slots. The algorithm locates for the boundary of the next backoff period and all operations must be synchronized with the backoff periods. In the next step, a random number is generated at

26

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

backoff periods in the range 0 . . . 2

BE

- 1.

The value is then decremented at the boundary of

each backoff period, which is called Random Backoff Countdown or RBC . During RBC, the channel is not sensed and if it is not available backoff countdown is not frozen. the current superframe do not have enough time to If

nish the RBC, the station needs to

wait until the next superframe active period. The counter only keeps frozen in the inactive portion of the superframe and resumes again in the active portion of the next superframe. If the value of RBC reaches to zero before transmitting the packet the algorithm needs to check the status (idle or not) of the channel. This is done by listening to the channel by Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) procedure in two backoff periods. Before starting the CCA the algorithm also needs to check if the current CAP have enough time to complete the necessary number of CCA checks, the packet transmission time, and acknowledgement. If there is enough time for all these activities the algorithm starts CCA check. Otherwise, the station needs to wait until the active period of the next superframe. If the channel

is busy during the CCA checks the value of NB and BE are increased by one, and CW and CCA are reset to 2. The algorithm is also restarted, generates a new RBC value and, keeps retrying until the value of NB is less than or equal to macMaxCSMABacko f f s (its default value is 5). If the value of NB exceeds MaxCSMABacko f f s the algorithm reports the failure of packet transmission to the higher layer of the protocol. The algorithm then decides whether to retransmit as a new packet or drops the packet. It is also mentioned that the value of BE value cannot exceed macMaxBE , which is set to 5 as default. Once the medium is found IDLE after checking CCA twice, the packet is transmitted. It is noted that the backoff countdown value is restricted by the NB and BE values. If the device is operating in non-battery power that is determined by macBatt Li f eE xt (if it is set to false)

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

27

the value of RBC does not exceed 7, 15, 31, 31, and 31, in successive retries. If the device is operating in battery power (if macBatt Li f eE xt is set to true) the value of RBC remains between zero and 3, 7, 15, 31, 31 on successive retries [23]. The smaller the value of RBC the larger the lifetime of batter is.

2.3.3

Acknowledgment of Successful Transmissions

The use of acknowledgment (ACK) frame is optional. This frame is sent by the coordinator on the request of subsequent devices. After sending the data packet the device should wait for the duration of macAckWait Durat ion, which amounts to 54 or 120 symbols depending on the PHY option. If the frame is not received within that period the device assumes that the data frame is lost and hence, initiates a retransmission. To retransmit a lost frame there should have enough time in the CAP of the current superframe. Otherwise, the device needs to wait for the CAP of next superframe. The standard allows for the retransmission of a lost frame upto macMaxFrameRet ries times, which is set to 3. If macMaxFrameRet ries exceeds its maximum value without the successful retransmission, the frame is dropped and the failure is reported to the higher layer of the protocol stack. To transmit an ACK frame the standard allows piggybacked that means it can transmit without using CSMA-CA mechanism. However, two conditions must be ful lled: (i)the coordinator must transmit the ACK packet by aT urnaroundT ime + aU nit Backo f f Period period after receiving the data frame and (ii) there should be enough time in the current CAP for the data frame, interframe space value, and acknowledgement frame. If both conditions are not ful lled then the ACK packet needs to be transmitted through the CSMA-CA procedure. In this thesis, we allow frames to be transmitted by following the CSMA-CA procedure and ACK frame is expected by the sender after data transmission. According to the standard, the ACK transmission should start at aT urnaroundT ime + aU nit Backo f f Period after the transmission of data frame, which results in the delay of 12 to 32 symbol periods depending on the PHY option. One backoff period is equal to 20 symbol. Thus, for this period, the channel is kept idle for one backoff period.

Guaranteed Time Slots

After CAP, there could be a contention free period (CFP) within the time period of active portion of the superframe. In some applications, contention-based access may not work properly due to collision. If a node needs CFP it requests for this period and PAN coordinator may reserve some timeslots for this node for dedicated access to the medium. This contention free dedicated timeslots is called guaranteed timeslots (GTSs) illustrated in Figure 2.5. The coordinator may or may not accept the request. If the request is accepted the node can access the medium without any interference resulted by other nodes. During that period other nodes are not allowed to transmit any data. It is noted that the node that gets GTSs can still use the CAP with all other nodes. In this thesis, we do not consider any guaranteed timeslot in the active period. In the superframe, we consider only the CAP and

Probability of Sleeping for Tags

that have on board energy go to power saving mode or sleeping mode when the network is not active or reader is not available or there are no data to send. By turning off the

radio subsystem sensor nodes and tags save the energy consumptions. In this thesis, we consider that RFID tags go to sleeping mode at the end of CFP period. They search and wait for the reader's signal when wake-up again. Thus, idle waiting time is reduced. To avoid synchronized wake-up time, the sleeping time of tags is randomized using geometric probability distribution [23]. Hence, the probability of more than one tags wake-up at the same time that results collision is reduced. The duration of sleeping period [23] can be expressed by Equation 2.1.

In a beacon enabled 802.15.4 cluster, a node that returns from the sleeping state and have packet to transmit will have to synchronize with the beacon.

IEEE 802.11 Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol

The IEEE 802.11 is a set of standard that ensure that both radio-based network interface cards (NICs) and access points implement access methods for sharing the air medium [4]. This standard implements the Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) that use the frequency bands of 2.4, 3.6 and 5 GHz. This standard also allows for multiple modulation schemes, and high data rates. The fundamental method of IEEE 802.11 standard to access the medium is called Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) that is also known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). It uses an optional access method, called Point Coordination Function (PCF) and also hybrid access mechanism, called Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) as shown in Figure 2.8.

Figure 2.8: Medium Access Control Architecture [5]

2.4.1

Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)

DCF protocol is the fundamental method to access the medium using CSMA/CA medium access control algorithm. CSMA/CA works by sensing the medium before transmit. This

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

33

means that if a station wishing to transmit must

rst sense the radio channel to determine

if another station is transmitting. The CSMA/CA scheme implements a minimum time gap exist between contiguous frames sequences. A station that has packet to transmit rst sense the channel status.If the medium is not

busy, the transmission may proceed.If the medium is sense busy then the station differ it`s transmission and needs to wait until medium becomes idle again.Stations need to sense medium being idle for distributed inter frame space(DIFS) period of time.The time after the idle DIFS is slotted and station is allow to transmit on the beginning of the time slot. Once the time has passed, the station selects a random amount(random backoff) of time to wait before sensing again to verify a clear channel on which to transmit. The CSMA/CA protocol avoids collisions among stations that share the medium by utilizing a random back-off time if the station's physical or logical sensing mechanism indicates a busy medium.The random backoff time is decremented until the medium sensed idle and frozen if the medium becomes busy. The backoff counter is resume again after medium is sensed idle for more than DIF S period of time. When the random counter reaches zero then the packet is ready to transmit. Figure 2.9 present the IEEE 802.11 DCF medium access control mechanism .

34

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

Figure 2.9: Basic Access Method of DCF [5]

The receiver of the packet acknowledge the successful transmission by sending a acknowledgement (ACK) packet after short interframe space SIF S to the sender station. The transmission is reported as unsuccessful if the ACK is not received during SIF S after the completion of current transmission. The unsuccessful packet needs to retransmit with doubling the CW until it reaches the retransmit limit.Once a frame has been sent from a given transmitted station then that station needs to wait until DIFS time interval to transmit again. When a station is transmitting than all other stations differ their access by setting Network allocation Vector (NA V) value.NA V use virtual carrier sense mechanism to determine the state of the medium. The NA V contains the duration information announced in frames prior to the actual exchange of data. The duration of NA V indicates the BUSY or IDLE state of the medium. If the medium is sensed BUSY when a station has started to transmit it should wait until the current transmission ends which duration is the amount of time set by other transmitting station in their NA V.

ing a short RTS frame .

The destination station acknowledge (ACK) the receipt of the

RTS frame by sending back a CTS frame. Then, the transmitting station sends the actual data packet and receiving stations replies with an ACK if it receives the data packet. Since no other station can transmit RTS or data packet after a successful transmission of RTS and receipt of CTS by a station, the collision can only occur on the RTS frame and is detected by the lack of CTS frame. The NA V contains the duration information announced in RTS/CTS frames prior to the actual exchange of data. All the other stations set their NA V value accordingly. Detailed working principle of this mechanism is illustrated in Figure 2.11.

2.4.2

Point Coordination Function (PCF)

The IEEE 802.11 standard also de nes an optional access method called Point Coordination Function (PCF), which is a centralized MAC protocol. PCF is built on top of the CSMA/CA-based DCF, by utilizing the access priority provisions, as illustrated Figure 2.8. PCF enables the transmission of time sensitive information [4]. In PCF, a point coordinator

37

(PC) which can be the AP, controls the network and decides which stations can transmit for a certain period of time. It is an opportunity for the AP to become a PC. PCF provides contention free frame transfer in contention free period (CFP) and a PC goes through all the stations and poll one station at a time. The operating characteristics of PCF are that all stations get the chance to work in the same basic service set (BSS) under one PC. For instance, in CFP period, a station is being polled by PC and that station transmits data frame for a speci c period of time when no other station can transmit. Then, the PC polls the next station. This process continues for all stations in the polling list. In PCF, stations are selected to transmit based on the round robin algorithm. At the beginning of the CFP all other stations set their NA V value and do not try to access the medium. The station being polled by a PC is called contention free(CF)-pollable station. PC and CF-pollable station transmit frame without using RTS/CTS mechanism. In CFP, a CF-pollable station may only transmit one MPDU to the PC or may be for other destination and may piggyback the acknowledgement of received frame from the PC. If the acknowledgement of the transmitted frame is not received by the CF-Pollable station, the station cannot retransmit the frame unless it is polled again by the PC in the CFP or can retransmit in CP. If the frame receiver station is not CF-Pollable then the station replies to the recipient of the frame by sending an ACK frame following the DCF acknowledgement rules. A PC may retransmit an unacknowledged frame when the particular frame association identi er (AID) is in top of the polling list. A PC retransmits the unacknowledged frames during CFP after PIFS time. The transmitted data frame or acknowledged polling frame that are sent by PC or CF-Pollable station during CFP use the appropriate data sub-types based on the following rules. [5].

CFP Frame Structure and Timing

The PCF uses virtual carrier sense (CS) mechanism to access the medium which has access priority mechanism over other access method of IEEE 802.11 standard. The PCF sends information about getting control of the medium through beacon management frame and all the stations set their NA V value accordingly. The interframe space value use in PCF frame (PIFS) transfer is smaller than the DCF (DIFS) frame transfer, which gives the PCF point coordinator more priority to access the medium and transfer frame over DCF access method. This access priority provides CF access period and all the stations can transmit framed without contention for a limited period of time. IEEE 802.11 protocol supports to alternate between the PCF and DCF access mechanism. Time is divided into CFP and CP as shown in Figure 2.12. In DCF time period, stations compete for using the CSMA algorithm. In PCF time period, stations wait for the poll to be selected as CF-Pollable station by PC before sending data. During CFP, frame transfer is controlled by PCF and each CFP begins after the beacon frame. The beacon frame contains Delivery Traf c Indication Message (DTIM) element and information regarding the CFP duration. All the stations set their NA V value based on these information. Beacon management frame also contains the CF parameter setting elements and Prob Response frames that are transmitted by stations. CFP duration is generated by PC regularly

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

39

at the CFP repetition interval, which is de ne as a number of DTIM intervals as shown in Figure 2.13. PC of the PCF controls the length of the CFP. The maximum length of CFP is calculated by the parameter CF PMaxDurat ion that is de ned in the CF parameter setting elements of PC. CF PMaxDurat ion should be long enough to send and receive one data frame and short enough to send one frame during the CP period. The duration of CFP duration is as long as the length of several beacon frames. If this duration is greater than the beacon interval, PC should transmits the beacon in the appropriate time of the CFP. Then the time remaining eld of CFP calculates the time left to reach it CF PMaxDurat ion. If

the CFP starts after the beacon frame then the CF PMaxDurat ion is equal to the remaining duration of CF PDurRemaining. All the stations set their NA V value according to the value of CF PDurRemaining. CF PDurRemaining speci es the maximum time duration of CFP, starting from the target beacon transmission time (TBTT) to the end of CFP. CF PDurRemaining is represented in time-unit(TU). After CFP, the beacon frames that are sent in CP should contain a zero value in CF PDurRemaining. Figure 2.13 illustrates the relationship of all parameters,

where the CFP period and CFP repetition interval are twice and thrice of DTIM intervals, respectively. DTIM intervals is equal to 3 beacon intervals and aCFPMaxDuration is approximately equal to 2.5 beacon intervals. Depending on the size of the polling list and traf c in the network, PC has the ability to terminate any CFP before aCF PMaxDurat ion. If the medium is busy there is a possibility of delay in transmission of beacon frame in TBTT. This delay results the CFP to be foreshortened by the amount of beacon transmission delay as shown in Figure 2.14. If the medium becomes busy during the exchange of DCF frames the beacon is delayed until the end of the frame transmission. In this case,

CF PMaxDurat ion speci es a value at the beginning of CFP that causes the end of CFP within the time period of T BT T

+ aCF PMaxDurat ion.

PCF Frame Transfer Procedure

PCF is a contention free protocol that provides contention free frame transfer and all the stations can transmit frames synchronously. Figure 2.15 illustrates the detailed description of a typical CFP cycle of PCF. At the beginning of the CFP, the station senses the medium for PIFS period of time. If the medium is sensed idle the beacon frame containing the CF parameter set element and a DTIM element is sent. A beacon frame also contains

the information about the CF PMaxDurat ion and the remaining CF PDurarion and all the stations set their NA V value accordingly. After waiting for SIFS period of time of the

beacon frame PC sends any of the following frames : data, CF-Poll, Data containing CFPoll, management, or CF-End frame. As the response to the CF-Poll frame a station sends an acknowledgement frame (optional) after waiting for SIFS period of time. If a PC nds

any data for that polled station it sends data containing CF-Poll. Otherwise, it only sends CF-Poll frame. After polled by the PC the station calculates if there is enough time in CFP to transmit a MPDU and receive its subsequent acknowledgement. If there is not enough

42

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

time remaining the station should defer the access and sends a Null or CF-ACK frame. In a condition when a station is being polled but there is no data to send the CF-End frame should transmitted immediately after the Beacon frame.After being polled, a station gets SIFS + timeToTxDataFrame interval of time to response to the poll in normal condition, but after waiting for again PIFS period of time the PC regain the control and moves to the next station of the polling list. In the response of the Poll if the station has data to send reply with Data+CFAck otherwise reply simply CFAck. . PC goes through it`s polling list one by one and the station on top of list is being polled rst. If there is enough time remaining

then PC can poll another station and continue until the MinimumDataTransferTime left in the CFP. After that PC sends a CF-End frame to announce the end of the CFP and all the stations set their NA V value as null. Figure 2.16 shows the procedure of the PCF. owchart of the medium access

2.4.3

Limitation of IEEE 802.11

DCF: Using the DCF basic access mechanism a station determines the time to access the medium. This decision making process is distributed to all stations. All stations have the same minimum value of contention window and same priority to access the medium. Hence, there is no difference between the higher and lower priority stations and their traf c. Thus, no QoS support exists in DCF. PCF:The IEEE 802.11 PCF provides QoS for time bounded services. Medium access for the PCF controlled stations have higher priority than that of the DCF controlled stations. PCF provides the limited QoS to the networks due to beacon delay and unknown transmission time for polled stations. Stations can start transmission before TBTT even if the current MSDU has not been nished. Because of the beacon delay from the TBTT a

transmission delay occur for the time bounded MSDUs. This delay affects QoS since it causes irregular delay in each CFP. Moreover, PCs have no control of polled stations as they are allowed to transmit fragmented MSDU or MSDU with the maximum length of 2304 bytes. This reduces the QoS of the stations, which are polled in the remaining time period of CFP.

2.5

QoS support mechanisms of IEEE 802.11e

The improved version of the IEEE 802.11 called IEEE 802.11e standard supports priority schemes. To ensure QoS in stations it provides user access priorities among the stations. The IEEE 802.11e supports CP and CFP within one superframe. IEEE 802.11e

supports Contention-based channel access method that provides contention based frame

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

45

transfer called Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism. EDCA is used only in CP.

2.5.1

Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Protocol (EDCA)

To avoid unpredictable transmission delay, the IEEE 802.11e MAC is improved by using the transmission opportunity (TXOP) value. This value ensures that an IEEE 802.11e station that obtains medium access should not use the medium longer than the de ned TXOP limit value. A TXOP is a interval of time during when a station gets an uninterrupted transmission opportunity to transmit MSDUs to the medium. Frames initiate transmission if there is enough time to complete the transmission. This also reduces the beacon delay, as no frame is permitted to transmitted across the Target Beacon Transmission Time (TBTT). Which gives HC better control of the medium. EDCA provides distributed and differentiated access to the medium by the stations which use 8 different user priorities (UPs). These UPs are categories into 4 Access categories (ACs). For each AC, an enhanced DCF medium access mechanism is used, which follows the same rules of DCF. However, three major changes to the operation of the original DCF are listed below.

46

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

Figure 2.17: UP-to-AC mappings [23]

1. Instead of distributed inter-frame space (DIFS), an inter-frame space (AIFS) is used. AIFS is the minimum idle time after which a station is permitted to access the medium.

2. Contention window (CW) pair minimum/maximum size is not same for every ACs. Using the CW random backoff value is computed.

3. During the maximum channel holding time or transmission opportunity time (TXOP) a station can access medium and send more than one packet. If the value of TXOP is set to 0 then only one frame can be sent.

The QoS support is provided to the stations by introducing these AC`s with different and multiple independent backoff procedures. Each stations can transmit parallel 4 MSDU`s using 4 different backoff entity as categorize according to their target application. Each of the backoff entity is prioritized according to AC speci c contention parameters which is

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

47

de ne in EDCA parameter set. The EDCA parameter set de nes the AC`s priority as in order of AC VO(voice), AC VI(video), AC BE(best effort) and AC BK(background). The EDCA parameter set differentiate the AC`s chance of medium access by setting individual interframe space value, contention window, TXOP value and many other parameter values per AC.

2.5.2

Queuing Structure

Each of the stations has 4 queue and data frames are prioritized according to the 4 access categories as mentioned earlier. If a station has data frames ready to send, it is classi ed and placed in to the appropriate queues. The inter frame space value and contention window value is calculated independently for each AC queues and decremented in parallel when medium is sense idle. In case of internal collision which happens when two or more queues are ready to transmit at the same time, the higher priority queue can transmit where as, the other queues act as physical collision happen during the transmission. The collided queue needs to double their CW value and increase retry counter. Thus each physical station The

works as 4 logical stations and hold 4 queues, each for one type of traf c queue. following gure 2.18 illustrates these priority queues.

48

Figure 2.18: Queuing Structure of IEEE 802.11e EDCA [23]

2.5.3

Interframe space value

Each backoff entity needs to wait for a small amount of time before start down counting the backoff value. The time interval between the frames is de ned by interframe space (IFS) value. During this value a station should determine that medium is idle through

carrier sensing (CS). Five different types of IFS value is used which provides the different priority to access the wireless medium-

1. SIFS short interframe space

2. PIFS PCF interframe space

3. DIFS DCF interframe space

4. AIFS arbitration interframe space (used by the QoS facility)

5. EIFS extended interframe space

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

49

Figure 2.19: Some IFS relationships [23]

The different IFSs used by different stations depend on their bit rate and these values are determined by the PHY according to their attributes. AIFS: The IFS de ned for EDCA is called Arbitration Interframe space (AIFS) which is different according to AC (AIFS[AC]). The QoS stations use AIFS to transmit MPDUs, all management frames (MMPDUs) and for the PS-POLL, RTS, CTS,BlockAckReq and BlockACK control frames. The AIFS[AC] value should be at least Duration of DIFS and can be vary depending on AC priority which is determine by the help of arbitration interframe space number (AIFSN[AC]). AIFSN[AC] value is selected for QoS STA by HC for each AIFS[AC] from the dot11QAPEDCATableAIFSN attributes in its MIB.For non -AP QoS STA this value is determine for each AIFS[AC] from the dot11QAPEDCATableAIFSN attributes in its MIB. The AIFSN [AC] de nes the duration of AIFS [AC] according to the following formulaAIFS[AC] = SIFS+AIFSN[AC] x aSlotTime, AIFSN[AC]

=2

The smallest access time of medium is DIFS, aSlotTime is the duration of a slot. The AC with small AIFSN[AC] gets the higher priority to access the medium.

2.5.4

Contention Window (CW) value

CW value is the another parameter value depend on which AC gets the priority to access the medium. The random backoff counter value is de ned by the CW. The EDCA parameter set de ne the CWmin and CWmax value for each AC . The smaller the CWmin[AC] value the higher the medium access probability. The EDCA contention window value varies according to AC and derived from DCF base values which is according to standard [5] for IEEE 802.11b aCW min is 31 and aCW max is 1023. AC VO Voice CWmin = aCW min + 1/4 - 1 , CWmax = aCW min + 1/2 - 1 AC VI Video CWmin = aCW min + 1/2 - 1 , CWmax = aCWmin AC BE Best E f f ort CWmin = aCWmin , CWmax = aCWmax AC BK Background CWmin = aCWmin , CWmax = aCWmax Following table 2.4 shows the default values of AIFSN[AC] and CW[AC] for IEEE 802.11b PHY in a QoS BSS according to standard [5]

Table 2.4: EDCA parameter set element value Priority UP (Same as 802.11 UP) low low high high 0 1 2 3 AC (informative) AC BE AC BK AC VI AC VO Best Effort Background Video Voice 31 31 15 7 1023 1023 31 15 3 7 2 2 Designation CWmin CWmax AIFSN [AC]

In a QoS BSS each queue of the AC has different access time to the medium. The frames of the voice queue which is AC[3] will initially select a random backoff timer between 0-3, frames in the video queue which is AC[2] will select a random backoff timer between 0 - 7,other ACs (AC[1] and AC[0]) will also select their backoff value according the above table. In this way, frames of the voice queue which have higher priority, have the

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

51

grater chance of selecting lower random backoff value compared with video, best effort and background. There are chances of lower priority frames can select lower random backoff value, but normally it doesn't happen. From the table we can see that , the maximum and minimum CW values of voice and video are smaller then best effort and background queue. The CWmin and CWmax values are encoded in exponent from with base 2. Each led of

the values are 4 bit long and decremented by 1 in the EDCA parameter set information element. Accordingly the CWmin values is 0 and CWmax is 32,767 [1] but practically the CWmax value always set as 1,023 and never above this.

2.5.5

Contention Window Scaling
gure 2.20 shows the increment of CW values with number of retries. Inirst attempt of transmission the random backoff timer it is set to a value

Following tially for the

between 0 - Cwmin. In case of collision indicated by lack of acknowledge frame the CW value will be increase. For each number of retries the CW value will double by a power of 2 which is called binary exponential backoff. When the CWmax value reaches the maximum limit it will remain unchanged until the subsequent retransmission attempt reached the retry limit or frame is successfully transmitted.. The maximum number of retries is 7 according to this standard.

when EDCA rules permit to access to the medium. Multiple frame transmission within one EDCA TXOP duration is occur when the EDCAF(Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Function) obtain the right to access the medium and complete the frame sequence. The TXOP limit value is broadcast by AP in the EDCA parameter set information element through the Beacon and Probe response frames. TXOP limit value 0 means that a single MSDU or MMPDU can be transmitted.

2.5.7

EDCA Medium Access Control mechanism

In EDCA for each ACs an enhanced DCF is used which follow the same rules of DCF four way hand shaking (RTS-CTS)medium access mechanism only some operational rules and parameters changes in the channel access method discussed above. If a node with

AC[k](where k indicating the access category number) wants to transmit a packet it needs to sense the medium for the duration of AIFSk(AIFS number for ACk).If the medium is still idle after AIFSk it can transmit the packet without backoff procedure. In this protocol medium can become busy during the AIFSk period then it needs to restart the AIFSk value and wait for the medium becomes idle again. After the medium becomes idle carrier sensing needs to restart from the beginning of the AIFSk. For interrupted AIFSk each AC can not transmit the packet without backoff procedure. The backoff procedure is necessary for an EDCAF, if

1. for that AC an attempt to transmit the packet after sensing medium idle for AIFSN[AC] without backoff was not successful;

2. packet needs to retransmit as fail of transmission due to collision, indicated by failure of receiving of CTS in response of RTS and receiving of ACK in response of MPDU;

54

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

3. A frame of that AC is ready to transmit but medium is not idle indicated by physical or virtual carrier sense and backoff countdown becomes zero.

4. The AC with TXOP

nished the

nal transmission and was successful.

5. For the internal collision when two or more EDCAFs of the same stations get the TXOP at the same time and collide one with another that has higher priority.

The CW [AC] value is reset to CWmin [AC] if the frame is successfully transmitted by that AC. If the backoff procedure is invoked because of the above condition 3 the value of CW [AC] shall be left unchanged. If the backoff procedure is called because of the above condition 2 and 5 the CW [AC] value shall be updated as follows:

1. If the QoS station reached the retry limit of EDCA parameter set element indicated value ,CW[AC] shall be reset to CWmin[AC]

2. If CW[AC] is less than CWmax[AC], it shall be increase by double in every retries as (CW[AC]+1)*2-1.

3. If CW [AC] is equal to CWmax [AC], the CW [AC] value shall remain unchanged for the rest of the reties.

After the AIFSk period if medium is still idle then a random backoff number is generated.The backoff number is decremented in each idle backoff slot.If the medium becomes busy during the backoff countdown, the backoff counter will be remain frozen until the medium becomes idle again for the duration of AIFSk = AIFSNk * aSlotTime. When the medium sense idle and backoff counter becomes zero frame transmission starts.After backoff phase 0 (uninterrupted) if there is no packet in the queue then without backoff it can not

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

55

be transmitted. When another packet will be in the queue than the previous packet can be transmitted. If the collision occurs the frame needs to retransmit and repeat backoff procedure with doubling the contention window. In this protocol transmission of a frame can be retry 7 times after that that frame is dropped. There are 7 backoff phase starting from phase 0 and CW value can be double until it reaches the CWmax value. After CWmax the value remain unchanged until the end of the transmission. Figure shows 2.22 the ow

chart of EDCA CSMA/CA medium access mechanism.EDCA protocol also use RTS/CTS four way handshaking technique to transit a frame. Where before sending the data packet it rst send the RTS frame. After sensing the medium idle for AIFS [AC] it starts backoff

counting.

Chapter 2: Background and Related work

57

When the backoff counter reaches zero and there is another packet in the queue of that AC then it can send the RTS and wait for the CTS. After receiving the CTS the data packet is transmitted and waits for the ACK frame. In case of collision, which is indicated by failure to receive a CTS or ACK, the packet is retransmitted until backoff phase 7 after that the packet id dropped. If there is a internal collision, because of the fact that two or more traf c queue transmit at the same time, the higher priority queue will get the chance to transmit, whereas other queues will retry upto 7 times with double CW values.

Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

Timing mechanism within the IEEE 802.11 standard supports that stations on the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) alternate between the use of Distributed coordination function (DCF) and Point coordination function (PCF) [4]. Time is divided in to contention free period (CFP) and contention period (CP). As a result, the WLAN can support both asynchronous and synchronous information ows. To solve the problem of WLAN/RFID

co-existence, the proposed solution allows the WLAN and RFID to access the medium in a time sharing manner by making the WLAN Access Point (AP) aware of the RFID neighboring network at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. In this approach, RFID readers act as Wi-Fi nodes. Thus, a RFID readers works as bridge between RFID and

WLAN networks and allows a single AP to cover multiple RFID networks. We consider the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol to transmit tags ID from tag to the reader. In the WLAN side, we consider Quality of Service (QoS) stations in the networks by improving the basic ac-

58

Chapter 3: Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

59

cess protocol of the IEEE 802.11 DCF to access the medium with Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA). EDCA provides QoS among the stations by dividing 8 user priorities into 4 Access Categories (AC).The objective of the proposed research is to provide QoS while integrating RFID with Wi-Fi WLAN so that there will be differentiation between the data of RFID and ordinary WLAN nodes. We are expecting RFID reader will not be affected by ordinary Wi-Fi nodes while they are accessing medium to send their data packet. We only consider 2 traf c classes. The data traf c from the RFID network is the AC [3], which gets the highest priority to access the medium, whereas the data traf c from WLAN is the AC [0] which has the lowest priority to access the medium. In the proposed solution,we consider that the RFID active tags and WLAN networks work on 2.4GHz microwave band with data transmission rate of 250 kbps for RFID and 2 Mbps for WLAN. At the beginning, the AP periodically broadcasts beacon frames. These frames contain information about the duration of Contention-Free Period (CFP) and Contention Period (CP), which are be used to access the medium by RFID and Wi-Fi, respectively. In CFP or PCF period only RFID networks (tags) work and all other networks such as WLAN remain silent. After the PCF or CFP period, Wi-Fi nodes of WLAN along with RFID readers work and send data to AP in the CP or DCF period. No polling is performed at the beginning of the CFP instead all RFID readers start reading the tags in their vicinity. Then, the readers transfer data to the Wi-Fi nodes through a shared buffer. At the end of CFP (or at the beginning of the subsequent CP), the RFID/Wi-Fi bridge will transmit information obtained from tags to the AP. For faster and more reliable access, one reader can be co-located with the AP. The AP collects RFID readings from all the bridged readers and forwards them to the application server. This approach might require a simple mod-

60

Chapter 3: Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

i cation on both the RFID readers and AP MAC parameters but it does not require any modi cation on the existing RFID tag hardware or software. This makes this approach economically feasible and thus, readily applicable in practice. Furthermore, the use of offthe-shelf Wi-Fi hardware provides an easy transmission of RFID readings to the AP that is also transparent to the ordinary WLAN nodes. The primary prototype of the proposed model is shown in Figure 3.1. We consider 3 RFID networks each with one reader and up to 200 tags. The reader collects data from the tag and sends to AP where, a single AP is able to cover the whole RFID and WLAN networks.

Readers send data to AP as well as other Wi-Fi nodes that work in the CP period. In the CFP or active period of 802.15.4 superframe, data is sent from tags to readers. Inactive period starts when a CF-End frame is received at the end of CFP period. Then the tags go into the sleeping mode. After the CP period, again beacon frame is sent that repeatedly starts the new superframe. In the

Uplink Communication of RFID Networks in Contention Free Period

One of the objectives of the proposed solution is to consider the IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 interference problem. The possible solution is to use the IEEE 802.11 PCF medium access mechanism. RFID networks only work in the CFP period of PCF and other networks remain in sleep mode in that period. This phenomenon reduces the interference problem greatly. In the proposed simulation model, we only consider the uplink communication using the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, where data is only transmitting from tags to readers but not vise versa. AP sends beacon messages at the beginning of the CFP. The beacon contains information regarding CFP period. Readers initiate transmission whenever they receive

Chapter 3: Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

63

polling from AP and send them to the tags.

Readers also send ACK to the AP if they

receive polling. One reader work at a time that is selected on round robin fashion. As soon as a reader nishes transmission controlled is transferred to the next reader of the polling

list. If there is not enough time to complete the data transmission a frame indicating the end of CFP is sent. If a station can send all data within the speci ed time period the polled station control is transferred to another station at the end of current transmission. Tags transmit data to a reader which also work as a coordinator for the RFID networks. RFID use Slotted CSMA-CA medium access mechanism to transfer data from tags to a reader. A few modi cation of the current IEEE 802.15.4 standard`s MAC frame is required for the RFID network that work in the frequency band of 2.45GHz with data transmission rate of 250kbps (Figure 3.5, and 3.4). IEEE proposes a new standard IEEE 802.15.4f

which mentions the necessary MAC frame changes. For the proposed simulation model, we consider 3 BSS, where each BSS consists of one reader and up to 200 tags. In the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, values for two important parameters, beacon order (BO) and superframe order (SO) are chosen carefully and are listed in Table 2.3. The SO is used to calculate the super Frame Duration (SD) period and BO is used to calculate the Beacon Interval (BI) period. The slot time of the IEEE 802.15.4 is 16 times larger than that of the IEEE 802.11. The backoff value in one superframe is 2 and all slots are equally divided. Whenever tags receive beacon from the polled readers, CAP/active period of 802.15.4 superframe starts working. If a tag has data to send it sets the initial parameters value as mentioned in the Section 2.3 of Chapter 2 and starts to countdown RBC . When the value of RBC reaches zero the tag requires to perform two clear channel assessments (CCA). In the rst CCA, if the medium is free, the tag performs the second CCA. If the medium is

64

Chapter 3: Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

found free in both CCAs the tag can transmit the packet and wait for the acknowledgement. Transmission occurs only at the boundary of the slot. Hence, if the transmission requirement is ful lled in the middle of the slot the tags needs to wait for the boundary of the slot to make it happen. Before the two CCA, it requires to check if the current superframe has suf cient time to send the packet. Otherwise, the tags needs to wait until the active period of next superframe. A CF-END frame is sent to tags that indicates the end of active and CFP period. At the end of active period, the inactive period starts when the tags remain in sleep mode. Each tag has an input buffer which store 2 packet in our simulation model. In the active period, if a new packets arrives but nds the buffer full that packet is dropped.

When the server is in the sleep state, the `push-out' policy is used, where a newly arrived packet is always admitted to the buffer. If the buffer is full at that time, admission is accomplished by discarding the packet at the head of the buffer and moving all other packets in the buffer one position so as to make space for the newly arrived packet. Thus, the server that returns from the sleep state always bene cial in many sensing applications. nds the most recent packets in its buffer, which is

Uplink Communication of WLAN Network in Contention Period

Another objective of the proposed solution is to integrate RFID and WLAN networks. RFID reader acts as a special station and integrates two networks. After the CFP period of PCF, CP of DCF starts. In DCF, all normal Wi-Fi stations and RFID readers compete for the medium to transmit data packets to AP. Data packets are transferred only when the medium is found idle by following the DCF medium access mechanism. The CP or active period of DCF protocol of WLAN is mapped with the inactive period of the IEEE 802.15.4 superframe (Figure 3.2). At the end of CFP, CP starts when RFID network remains in

sleep mode and set there NA V value. During the uplink communication of WLAN, data is transferred from a station to AP

66

Chapter 3: Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

but not vise versa. The IEEE 802.11e contention-based channel mechanism, EDCA protocol is used as a medium access mechanism. CSMA-CA algorithm and DCF four-way handshaking (RTS/CTS) packet transmission technique is used in CP period. If a station has data to transmit it checks the status of the medium and also whether it is CP or CFP. If the station senses the medium as idle for the duration of inter-frame space of time (AIFS) in CP or active period of Wi-Fi mode then the station generates a random number. The random number/backoff is decremented if the station receives idle backoff value (i.e., idle medium). Whenever the random backoff value reaches zero the station transmits if there is any packet in the queue. Before sending the data packet the station sends the RTS packet and waits to receive CTS packet from the AP. The station sends data packet to AP after receiving CTS. If AP receives data successfully it replies with an ACK packet that noti es the end of current transmission. At the end of CP period, the WLAN station sets its NA V value according to the CFP period of PCF.

Superframe Timing Schedule of Proposed Solution

Figure 3.5 illustrates the total communication cycle of the proposed solution. In the rst cycle of superframe, AP sends a beacon frame that contains information about the CFP period and then reader one (R1 ) is polled to start working. During this period, only R1 uses the medium and collects tag IDs and store them for further use. All other stations set there NA V value accordingly. At the end of CFP or CF PMaximum, R1 sends CF-END frame to AP to notify the end of its activity. If R1 still have frames to transmit but the CFP period ends and reaches to CF PMaximum the AP switches to CP of DCF when WLAN networks start working. R1 also works with all other normal Wi-Fi nodes to send its stored tag IDs to

Chapter 3: Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

67

AP since it is a special node that works as an interface between two networks. At the end of the CP period of DCF, the second cycle of superframe starts when reader two (R2 ) is polled. Similarly, R3 works in the third cycle. Since we consider only three RFID networks, only stations of WLAN work in the whole fourth cycle. Then R1 will be polled again in the cycle. The time duration between the fth

rst cycle of R1 and the next cycle for R1 polled cycle

is called beacon interval (BI). The default value of BI between PCF and DCF is 100TU.

Figure 3.5: Timing structure of the proposed solution

The detailed description of a cycle is illustrate in Figure 3.6. In a typical cycle, CFP and CP alternates. At the beginning of CFP, AP sends a beacon and R1 is polled and replies

68

Chapter 3: Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

with a Poll-ACK frame. Then R1 sends a beacon frame to its vicinity to announce the presence of it. The active tags response by sending their IDs. Tags sleep according to their sleeping probability and after wakeup they wait for the speci c beacon frame containing the information of active reader. At the end of CFP, R1 sends CF-END frame to the AP. Then the control is transfer to the CP of DCF form AP where WLAN networks along with the R1 reader sends their data to AP. At the end of the rst cycle, CFP period is announced

again by the AP. Then, AP sends the beacon frame after waiting for duration of the point coordination function interframe space (PIFS). This process continues synchronously. During the rst cycle, when R1 works other RFID networks (R2, and R3) set their NA V value

according to the PCF period.

Challenges

It is very important and challenging to identify the values of parameters that provide the best overall performance of the networks. The DCF protocol causes many troubles in WLANs. RF interference is probably the most vulnerable problem. If a source of RF interference (e.g., cordless phone or other WLAN stations) is present, data transmissions are blocked by DCF as long as the interfering signal is present. The stations sense enough energy on the medium and wait patiently, in most cases for just a few seconds or minutes. This also causes the throughput of the network to drop signi cantly. following limitations and try to We consider the

nd appropriate values for the following parameters in

order to design an ef cient approach in this regard. Tag Range: The most important parameter for evaluating the performance of an RFID system is tag range. It is de ned as the the maximum distance at which a RFID reader can either read or write information at a tag. We consider active tags with the tag range up to 11 meters that work in the 2.45 GHz microwave sub-band. Collision: The collision problems occur when multiple tags send the packet at the same time. To avoid the problem, tags go to sleep mode based on the value of its sleeping probability value after sending one successful packet. We need to calculate the average sleeping time properly. If the wakeup time is set as random the possibility for a number of tags wakeup at the same time is less. The possibility of using multiple readers in the same physical space gives rise to the problem [2] that two readers may simultaneously try to read tags. If the readers are in close vicinity they may interfere with each other directly. The transmitted RF power from one reader may result the tag to response to another reader in the vicinity (reader-tag collision) if they are on the same channel. Even when two readers

70

Chapter 3: Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

on different channels, if there are tags within the coverage of these two readers, tags might not be able to respond to either reader`s query reliably upon receiving signal from both readers (reader-reader collision). This problem can be sloved by using different frequency for the interfering reads. However, frequency coordination problem arises when number of frequency is limited. In the proposed approach, one reader works in one active period since the IEEE 802.11 PCF medium access mechanism works by polling one node at a time. All other nodes are selected in round robin fashion. Thus, the probability of reader-reader collision is less. Tag Density: To nd the actual number of tags that send data packets in one active

period is a great challenge. We assume that the data size is 4 slots and active period is 48 slots. Thus, 12 tags can send data packet to readers. Contention Free Period (CFP) and Contention Period (CP): We need to nd the

actual duration of PCF period (i.e., CFP) and DCF period (i.e., CP).Superframe duration (SD) and beason interval (BI) are chosen by two important parameter values BO and SO. If PCF (CFP) or DCF (CP) periods are too short then tags will have not much time to send their IDs or stations and readers will have not enough time to send their data packets that results a saturation. TimeSlot: The duration of a timeslot that is used in the IEEE 802.11 is 20 microseconds and in the IEEE 802.15.4 is 320 microseconds (16 time larger than 802.11). Thus, we need to adjust the timeslots duration for two networks properly. The deployment of such RFID/WLAN solutions in practice would thus contribute to even more wider applications of RFID, including areas where RFID is currently not used due to the coexistence problems mentioned above. We try to share the access of medium

Chapter 3: Scheme for WLAN and RFID Coexistence

among the RFID and WLAN networks in a fair way to solve the coexistence problem. There can be more issues arise during the design and deployment. assign the appropriate values and features to them. Hence, we need to

Simulation Parameters and their Values

The parameter values that we use in the simulation are calculated using the speci cation of the IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 standards. In this section, we de ne the parameters, and calculate their values. Tables 3.2 and 3.3 present most of the parameters we use in the simulation. aCFPMaxduration aCF PMaxDurat ion is de ned as the maximum duration of the CFP period of PCF. The limit of this value allows the coexistence between contention and contention free traf c. Once this time is reached, PCF access method ends and DCF period starts. If the end

of the CFP period is not announced by PCF but it reaches to aCF PMaxdurat ion the AP terminates the CFP period and transfers control to the DCF period. We calculate aCF PMaxdurat ion in microsecods according to the following formula. CF PMaxDurat ion = (BeaconPeriod  DT IMPeriod  CF PRat e) -(MaxMPDU T ime + 2  SIF ST ime + 2  Slot T ime + 8  ACKSize) Where, MaxMPDU T ime = T imeToT xMaxSizedMACFrame + T imeToT x  (Preamble + header + t railer + ex pansionBit s) The minimum value of CF PMaxDurat ion is MinCF PMaxDurat ion that provides sufcient time for the AP to send one data frame to a station, polling that station and allow the

72

polled station to respond with one data frame.

The maximum duration of CFP is de ned by the beacon interval. The default value of beacon interval is 100 milliseconds. Sometimes PC may terminate any CFP before the aCF PMaxdurat ion period based on the available traf c and size of the polling list. Beacon frames must wait if the medium is busy. In this case, they need to wait in CP untill the DCF frame transfer ends. This results the late arrival of beacon frames. Target Beacon Transmission Time (TBTT) If it is the time for CFP but the frames of CP are in still transmission then the CP frames should nish their transmission that shortens the CFP time. Thus, CFP time starts whenever nish. Thus, TBTT is de ned as the maximum time between foreshortened and

CP frames

actual CFP time. Superframe Duration (SD) and Beacon Interval (BI) A slot time in Wi-Fi scale is equal to 20 µ s whereas, a slot time in RFID scale is 320 µ , that is 320/20 = 16 times larger than that of the Wi-Fi scale. A superframe of

IEEE 802.15.4 or Zigbee consists of active and inactive periods which are 48 slots in total. SD of RFID scale contains 16 timeslots, each having the same length.

A timeslot

is divided into aBaseSlot Durat ion  2

symbols, where aBaseSlot Durat ion denotes the

minimum number of symbols in a slot (e.g., aBaseSlot Durat ion has 60 symbols if SO is equal to 0). The value of aBaseSu per f rameDurat ion is xed to 960 symbols (i.e.,

band of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The BI and SD are de ned by the BO and SO, respectively. The range of the BO is between 0 and 14, and the range of the SO is between 0 and BO. The nodes can only communicate with the coordinator during an active period of RFID netwrok, while the coordinator and nodes may enter the idle state during an inactive period. If we consider SO

Most of the time tags are in sleep state and check beacon message after they wakeup. If the beacon is not available tags go to sleep mode again. The value of average sleep time value is equal to 1/Pslee p . Table 3.1 illustrates the average sleeping time in minutes and in RFID slots and also their corresponding sleeping probability values. The parameters and their corresponding values that we use in the simulation simulator are listed in Tables 3.2 and 3.3.

Simulator Design

Simulator Model

Simulator is a way of validation and performance evaluation of a model. We use the Artifex simulation tool to validate our proposed scheme and measure the performance. Artifex is built using object oriented Petri net simulation engine [11] that provides graphical user interface to build a simulator model using different combination of objects, elements and classes. In Artifex, the common elements are places, transitions and links as shown in Figure 4.2. The rectangles, circles and arrows represent transitions, places and links, respectively. Places hold tokens and are connected with one or more transitions. In transitions, action codes are written, which are actually the processing unit of the model. Tokens are transmitted from a transition to another according to the user controlled code of transition actions. Links are connectors that connect places with transitions.

78

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

79

Figure 4.1: Graphical representation of our simulator

Places hold information in the form of tokens. Tokens are structured data. Objects are connected to each other through interfaces, which are a set of input and output places. To transfer information, the input place of one object is connected to the output place of another object. Using Artifex, a complex simulator can be designed by splitting a page into multiple pages and connecting them through the interface. Artifex is suitable for discrete event systems and user can build a non-ambiguous model of a system. Figure 4.1 illustrates the graphical representation of simulator design of the proposed scheme.

The Top Level

The top level page of the proposed simulator integrates RFID with the WLAN networks (Figure 4.2. In IEEE 802.11 WLAN networks, 40 stations (D1, D2 and so on) are connected with the medium to send uplink data to access point (AP). Stations, wi medium

and APs are connected to each other through interfaces and also to the RECORD. When an event occurs, data go to the MEASUREMENT page through RECORD input place(Figure 4.3) to measure the value of different performance metrics. In the RFID side, tags(T1,T2 and so on) are connected with r dmedium to send their ids to the de ned readers (R1 or

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

81

R2 or R3). Readers are also connected with wi medium and AP to send the tags ids to AP in WLAN mode. Two networks are integrated with each other through reader. In the WLAN mode, these readers work as special stations along with other normal stations. In the proposed model, we only consider uplink communications, where data are only sent from stations/readers to AP.

Access Point

The Access Point (AP) consists of three pages: MAIN PAGE, CSMA CA ALGORITHM, and DOWNLINK QUEUE page. AP contains two input places (i) RECEIVE DATA:PACKET, and (ii) GET:BACKOFF and two output places (i) SEND OUT:PACKET, and (ii) SEND:BEACON. Figures 4.4 illustrate AP class. The PACKET, and BACKOFF are two different data types or tokens that are sent to and received from the MEDIUM class. link data and stores them in the DOWNLINK QUEUES class. An AP receives up-

For each station in the

82

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

DOWNLINK QUEUE page, there are buffers to store data. These data are sent later to the application server. In the proposed simulation model, a single AP covers both the RFID and WLAN networks. In the contention free period (CFP) of point coordination function (PCF), an AP can poll one reader at one time. AP sends beacon frames and then sends Poll frames to the appropriate reader (R1 or R2 or R3 ). After polling the readers send Poll ACK frame to the AP. The reader sends the beacon frame to notify the neighboring tags about its availability. Tags send their IDs to the AP through the reader. AP sends beacon to the stations and receives CTS and data. After receiving RTS from a station AP waits for the SIFS period of time (0.5 slots) and generates CTS frame and sends to that station. When a station receive CTS it sends data to AP through medium. AP sends beacon frames after beacon interval of 100 Time Unit (TU), which is the total superframe time of PCF and DCF. To convert time unit, Artifex uses real and virtual time. In our simulation model, we consider the virtual time. In the rst cycle of the simulator, the rst beacon is sent and reader R1 is

polled. Readers R2 and R3 are polled in the 2nd and 3rd cycle. Since we have only three RFID networks, only WLAN networks work in the fourth cycle. The same process repeats afterwards.

WLAN Medium Class

Medium receives PACKET, and BEACON from the stations and sends BACKOFF and DATA to AP. Medium receives frames from stations and AP through the input places, RECEIVE:PACKET and LISTEN:BEACON . It sends the frames to stations and AP through the SEND TO DEVICE, SEND TO AP and SEND DCF:BACKOFF output places. MEDIUM synchronizes the time period of RFID and WLAN. After receiving the BEACON frame from AP, the medium starts a clock that indicates the start of the RFID networks. Receiving the CF END frame from the RFID MEDIUM indicates the end of the RFID duration.

84

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

After receiving the CF END (i.e.,

nish of CF Pmaximum duration) the DCF period starts,

as shown in the transition GO TO DCF PERIOD of Figure 4.5. At each timeslot the clock sends a token to the stations in the form of BACKOFF token (SEND DCF:BACKOFF output place). Collision occurs if more than one token arrives in the MEDIUM. However, collision is only considered for RTS frames. The medium is considered to be busy when any transmission is sensed in the MAC layer. If non collided RTS can pass through the medium, the medium is kept busy until the end of current transmission. This status is dened in the RTS frame as a Network Allocation Vector(NA V). Other nodes set their NA V value accordingly and cannot access the medium during this time. Medium becomes IDLE again when ACK is received by the stations for the current transmission. In case of collision, the medium is kept busy for the duration of packetsize + tack + ACKsize before passing the packets to the place, DESTROY:PACKET. Once the packet is destroyed the medium becomes free again.

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

85

Figure 4.5: MEDIUM class of WiFi networks

4.1.4

Station Class

Station class contains three pages: MAIN PAGE, CSMA CA ALGORITHM, and SOURCE POISSON page. The SOURCE POISSON page is responsible for generating the packets according to Poisson Distribution method. The inter arrival time between two packet (WAIT transition) is maintained by an exponential distribution. Firstly, the participating station`s ID is checked through the transition CHECK DEVICE that is illustrated in Figure 4.6. The SOURCE POSSION page maintains a nite buffer size of 1023 bytes. If the buffer be-

comes full but more packets are still arriving the extra packets are passed to the DISCARD

86

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

transition. The CSMA CA algorithm is implemented in the CSMA CA ALGORITHM page. If there is a ready packet to transmit in the SOURCE POISSON page then the station initializes the value of AIFS and contention window (CW) according to the access category (AC) of the stations. We consider the highest AC for reader/station and the lowest AC for normal Wi-Fi stations. After sensing the medium for AIFS period a random number is generated. The BACKOFF value is sensed through the SENSE DCF:BACKOFF place and the random number is decremented by one in every free medium backoff slot. The predicate of the transition READY TO checks if there is any packet in the queue. If the random number becomes zero and there are ready packets in the queue then the packets are directly transmitted to the medium after zeroth backoff through UPLINK TO place connected to the MAIN PAGE. If there is no packet in the queue, i.e., the predicate of transition AC2 becomes true, (as illustrated in Figure 4.8) then the packet needs to wait until the another packet is ready to send. Before sending the packet the station keeps a copy of the packet in case of failure due to collision. Collision is detected by the lack of receiving CTS within

(RT S + CT S + DAT A + ACK + 3  SIF S)

slots. The packet can be retransmitted 7 times.

After this number of attempts that packet is dropped and information is sent to the MEASUREMENT page through the RECORD:MEASUREMENT output place. The MAIN PAGE receives PACKET and BACKOFF through the WELCOME:PACKET and RECEIVE DCF:BACKOFF input places and sends packet to the medium and MEASUREMENT page through the SEND OUT:PACKET and RECORD:MEASUREMENT output places as is shown in Figure 4.7. Ready to transmit packets (RTS and data) are sent through the SEND OUT:PACKET output place, and CTS and ACK are received through

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

87

the WELCOME:PACKET input place. Upon the successful transmission of the current packet, that is con rmed by the receiving of ACK packet, the process continues (PROCESS NEXT) if packets still exist in the queue. In the proposed simulation model, readers also work as special stations following the same working mechanism mentioned above.

Tag

In the RFID level, we consider three RFID networks. Each RFID network consists of maximum 200 tags and one reader. At a time one reader and tags in the vicinity of the reader can send their IDs to the AP. Once the reader is polled by an AP, the reader sends a beacon control request frame to its neighboring tags through the LISTEN:BEACON input place. As the response of this request tags send their IDs through the SEND OUT RF:PACKET output place. The tag class contains three pages: MAIN PAGE, CSMA CA ALGORITHM, and SOURCE POISSON page. The SOURCE POISSON page works similar to the SOURCE POISSON page of station class. The only difference is that tags receive the active reader information through the LISTEN:R BEACON input place and the availability of the tags are checked

90

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

accordingly. The IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA protocol is used as a medium access mechanism to send the IDs to the medium. Figure 4.10 shows the CSMA CA page of the networks. Whenever the tags wakeup from the sleep mode they receive the information regarding the availability of active readers through BEACON (MAIN PAGE). Then, the tag initializes (INITIALIZE) the value of three parameters: Retry Count(NB), CW, and backoff exponent(BE) and generates a random number. The random number is decremented by one after receiving the backoff through the place FORWARD:BACKOFF. In this standard, transmission occurs at the beginning of the boundary. Once the random number reaches to zero this algorithm checks if the current superframe has enough time (or active period) to transmit the frame through the (WAIT ACTIVE PERIOD) transition and receive its subsequent ACK. If not, the token or data packet needs to wait in the WAIT INACTIVE PERIOD transition for the next superframe. After completing two Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) if the medium is still IDLE data packet is passed to the MAIN PAGE to send to RFID MEDIUM. Before sending the packet the CSMA/CA protocol used in this page keeps a copy of the token to be retransmitted in case of collision. On the presence of the subsequent readers, tags send IDs to the reader and wait for the ACK that ensures the successful transmission. The MAIN PAGE receives acknowledgement (ACK) through the RECEIVE ACK:PACKET input place. This page also has two output places: SEND OUT RF:PACKET, and RECORD:MEASUREMENT. Each tag sleeps (GO TO SLEEP) according to the sleeping probability (0.999999911). The sleeping time of two tags is randomized exponentially. Thus, the probability that two tags wake at the same time is very less. When tags wakeup from the sleep mode tokens are passed to the WAIT FOR BEACON transition (Figure 4.9) to check and wait for the

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

91

subsequent active reader. After that tokens are passed to the SOURCE POISSON page. After the successful transmission of the packet (tag IDs) the tag goes to sleep mode again and the process continues. In the event of successful transmission of tag ID or when tag wake up data is passed to the measurement(RECORS:MEASUREMENT) page.

Medium RFID

Medium page is responsible for generating backoff and transmitting packets (tag IDs) to the appropriate active reader. This page sends backoff to the tag class through the

SEND:BACKOFF output place so that tags can check the medium status. After receiving BEACON through (REC BEACON:BEACON) in each timeslot this page sends the medium status to the tag class. The size of the active period (ACTIVE PERIOD) of superframe is only 48 slots. After

Chapter 4: Simulator Design

93

this period, token is passed to the INACTIVE PERIOD transition, which indicates the end of the superframe and a CF END frame is transmitted to the WiFi-MEDIUM. Medium receives tag IDs through the RECEIVE:PACKET input place and sends the packets to the reader through (TRANSMIT:PACKET). When the medium receives a packet it becomes BUSY for other tags. Those tags also set their NA V value accordingly. If more one token arrive in the medium at the same time a collision is occurred. The collided tokens are passed to the COLLISION transition. Before destroying the token medium is kept busy for the duration of

( packet size + ACK + tack ).

After that the medium declares itself as idle. Even if

no collision occurs the medium is also kept busy for the duration of

( packet - size + ACK ).

The medium becomes idle again once it receives ACK for the current transmission (Figure 4.11).

WELCOME:PACKET) input placce. Then, it sends beacon frame to its subsequent networks through SEND OUT R:R BEACON to notify its presence. It also sends POLL ACK

frame through the SEND OUT:PACKET output place to AP (Figure 4.12).

As the re-

sponse to this request, tags send their IDs to the reader using (REC RFID DATA) and store data into the buffer of SOURCE POISSON page using GET PACKET (Figure 4.13). This is done for the transmissions to AP later in the WLAN period. RFID readers work as the QoS stations for the IEEE 802.11e WLAN networks and send the collected tag IDs to AP. The working mechanism of CSMA CA page and MAIN PAGE is same as the CSMA CA ALGORITHM page and MAIN PAGE of station class. Thus, they send RTS, wait to receive CTS, send the stored tag ids, and again wait for the ACK.

Performance Evaluation

A simulation model is designed for the proposed approach that solves the coexistence and integration problems of IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (WLAN) with Radio Frequency Identi cation (RFID) technologies. This approach locates and identi es the RFID tags in the physical spaces with the co-located Wi-Fi WLAN using IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi compatible existing hardware. In this chapter, we present the simulation results and performance evaluation.

Performance Evaluation of RFID

5.1.1

Design Consideration

In the simulation model for RFID network, we assume that an infrastructure network is operating in the saturation mode for single hop communication using IEEE 802.15.4 or Zigbee standard. We assume that three RFID networks exist in this model, each having one reader and 200 active tags working in the frequency band of 2.4 GHz microwave sub-

97

Chapter 5: Performance Evaluation

band or ISM band with transmission rate of 250 kbps. We consider that each tag always has a packet to transmit when wake-up from the sleeping mode. Each tag sleeps most of the time since it has a sleeping probability (0.999999911). As a result, their wakeup time is randomized exponentially and the probability that more than one tags wakeup at the same time is very less. This way CSMA-CA protocol works better and reduces collision. After a successful transmission tags go to the sleep mode again and search for the active reader when they wakeup. If the active reader is not available tags wait until the beacon frame arrives that contains information about the active reader. Each RFID network has one reader and 200 active tags. Each RFID network works in such a way that no reader collects information of the tags of anothe networks or no tag responses with the requrest of other networks reader. In this model, we only consider the uplink queue that allows the transfer of packets from tags to access point (AP) but not the vice versa. We consider the transmission time and delay in number of slots, where a slot time is 320 microseconds for RFID network. The length of a tag ID is 4 RFID slots that includes the MAC header. The size of beacon and acknowledgement(ACK) frame is 2 RFID slots.The size of the active period of the superframe is 48 slots and SO,BO value is chosen as 0 and 5.Tags compete to win the medium following the IEEE 802.15.4 slotted CSMA/CA medium access mechanism.

5.1.2

Simulation Results

We measure the performance in terms of frame collision probability, average number of collision in each superframe, average waiting time of tags after wake up, average number of awaken tags in each superframe, average collision position in each superframe, and average successful transmission position in each superframe. Results are generated as 2-D

plots using Maple mathematical software. We measure the performance for two scenarios.

1. By changing the average sleeping time (1,5,7,10,and 15 minutes) for a of tags (80 tags in each network)

xed number

2. By changing the number of tags (20,40,60,100, and 150) for a time (1 minute)

xed average sleeping

Now, we de ne the operational metrics that are used to measure the performance of the proposed approach.

Frame Collision Probability
The probability of unsuccessful packets in the network is called collision probability. Collision probability is calculated as the ratio of the the total number of collided tags to the total number of tags that are transmitted.

Average number of Collisions in each superframe
The ratio of calculating total unsuccessful frames in a duration of a frame cycle is de ne as the number of collisions in each superframe. Average number of Collisions in each superframe is calculated by measuring the total number of collisions over the total number of superframes.

100

Chapter 5: Performance Evaluation

Average Waiting time for Tags
Average waiting time for tags is the average of all tags waiting time, where tags waiting time is calculated as the time difference between the moment when a tag wakes-up and receives the subsequent beacon.

Average number of awaken tags in each superframe
The tag that is active means wakeup from sleeping mode is called awaken tag. Average number of awaken tags in each superframe is calculated by measuring the number of total awaken tags over the total number of superframes.

Average collision position
The slot number of a superframe in which collision happens is identi ed as collision position of that collided packet. Average collision position in each superframe is the ratio of the average of all positions when collision happens in the 48 slots superframes.

Average successful transmission position
The slot number of a superframe in which packet was successfully transmitted is identi ed as successful transmiossion position of that packet. In the 48 slots superframe, the average successful transmission position is calculated by measuring the total successful packets over the number of superframes. Figure 5.1 illustrates the results for a variable sleeping time but for a tags in each networks having 80 tags. xed number of

Chapter 5: Performance Evaluation

In Figure 5.1(a), we

nd that increasing the average sleeping time from 1 to 15 minutes

decreases the collision probability. This is because if the average sleeping time of tags is high, i.e., tags remain in sleep mode for a long period of time, then the probability that more than one tags wakeup at the same time is less. On the other hand, if the average sleeping time is low, this probability of waking up more than one tags at the same time will be high. A random number generator is used to generate tag`s wakeup time. Hence, Figure 5.1(a) demonstrates that the collision probability for 1 minute sleeping time is much higher than that of the collision probability for sleeping time 15 minutes.The effect of decreasing the collision probability has relation with the number of collisions in the network. Hence, Figure 5.1(b) demonstrates that the average number of collisions of the network decreases when the sleeping time of tags increase. Figure 5.1(c) illustrates the average collision

position in each superframe over sleeping time. We observe that the position of a collision is near the start of a superframe, where the collision position is at the slot number 4 for 1 minute sleeping time. The collision position is moving forward to the slot number 7 with increasing the sleeping time upto 10 minutes then decreases. We do not observe any collision for the sleeping time 15 minutes. Figure 5.1(d) demonstrates that the average

tags waiting time after they wake up and receive the beacon do not change signi cantly when average sleeping time is increasing. When the sleeping time of tags is low (i.e., 1 minute) there is a high probability that several tags wakeup at the same time and wait for beacons. However, only one vicinity tags is allowed to receive the beacon. Thus, remaining tags wait for the next available beacons that increases the average tag waiting time. But this is not the case, when the sleeping time of tags is high. Hence, Figure 5.1(d) shows a slight decrease of the waiting time for increasing the sleeping time of tags.According

Chapter 5: Performance Evaluation

103

to the Figure 5.1(e), the number of awake tags decreases when the sleeping time of tags increases since it increases the wakeup interval.According to the Figure 5.1(f), the position of successful transmission moves towards the beginning position of the superframe as the number of collision decreases and vice versa. At the beginning, when the average sleeping time is 1 minute, the number of collision increases that decreases the number of successful transmissions (occurs at the timeslot 9 in superframe). Similarly, the position of successful transmission moves towards the starting position of the superframe for the increase average sleeping time (5,7,10 and 15 minutes), which is at the slot number 4. observed at all in this case. In the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, transmission always takes place at the beginning of backoff slots. Hence, the position of frame a collision or a successful transmission occurs at the beginning of a superframe. We observe from Figure 5.1 that increasing the sleeping time has a positive impact on the overall networks performance as the collision probability deceases and the successful transmission position moves towards the starting position of the superframe. Figure 5.2 illustrates the simulation results of the second scenario, a variable number of tags but for a xed average sleeping time (1 minute). No collision is

Chapter 5: Performance Evaluation

105

In Figures 5.2(a) and 5.2(b), we observe that increasing the number of tags has impact on the network performance. Collision probability and number of collisions increase for increasing the number of tags from 20 to 140.When the network traf c is high, the probability that more than one tags wakeup at the same time increases. This increases the number of collisions. On the other hand, when the network traf c is very low (number of tags is 20), the collision in the network decreases (Figure 5.2(a)).Again, if the number of tags with a xed sleeping time increases, the number of tags that wakeup at the same time

also increases. As a result, the number of collisions in each superframe increases (Figure 5.2(b)).Figure 5.2(c) illustrates the average number of awake tags in each superframe. The result slows that average number of awake tags increases if the number of tags in the network increase from 20 to 140 tags.Increasing the number of tags does not change much of the average tag waiting time as shown in Figure 5.2(d). However, when a large number of tags are awake most of them need to wait for the beacon as only for a subsequent reader the subordinate tags response. As a result, the waiting time of tags increases.According to Figure 5.2(e), the collision position moves towards the beginning of the superframe for

increasing the number of tags. We observe that there is no collision when only 20 tags are present in the network. But for the increased traf c in the network (40 tags) the collision position moves forward of the superframe at the slot number 7. Similarly, the collision position moves towards the beginning position of the superframe when we further increase the tags number to 60,100 and 140 tags because of the increased collision probability. For the value of CW (=2) the collision position should be between 0 and 8 that is observed in the result.On the other hand, the successful transmission position moves forward of the superframe as is illustrated in Figure 5.2(f). When the number of collision in superframe

106

Chapter 5: Performance Evaluation

increases the number of successful transmissions decreases. As a result, the superframe position of successful transmission moves forward. We also observe that when the number of tags is 20, the collision probability(Figure 5.2(a)) is 0 and the position of successful

transmission is very close to the beginning of the superframe (approximately at slot number 2). When the collision probability increases for the number of tags 140, the position of successful transmission moves to the slot number 10. Figure 5.2 shows that if the number of tags in each network increases the collision probability increases. This is opposite to the result illustrated in Figure 5.1.

5.2

Performance Metrics and Simulation Results for EDCA

In the simulation model, we assume that an infrastructure network is operating in the saturation mode for single hop communication. We consider only two station classes:

Wi-Fi normal/ordinary stations and reader/station class. For WiFi normal/ordinary nodes, we consider that packets are generated from the top level of the TCP in saturation mode. Poisson distribution is used to calculate the inter arrival rate between two packets with the assumption that p device lambda

=

p arrival rat e. For reader/station, data arrival rate

depends on the RFID networks, where 150 tags send their ID with the average sleeping time is equal to 1 minute. We measure the performance in terms of throughput, access probability, average backoff time, average backoff phase, packet drop probability, AIFSN restart, collision probability, and probability of idle state. We de ne the following operational metrics.

Chapter 5: Performance Evaluation

107

Throughput
Throughput is de ned as the ratio of the total amount of transmitted data (in slots) to the total number of back-off slots. It is calculated for data transmissions by all stations in the network and also for transmitting data by a speci c station over the back-off period. Amount of data transmission in slots = number of transmitted data * 100. Where data size for the Wi-Fi node is assumed to be 100 slots without the header information. On the other side, the data size of reader/stations is only 100 bytes, which is assumed to be 20 slots without header information.

RTS collision probability
The probability of unsuccessful packets in the network is called collision probability. Collision probability is calculated by measuring the total number of collided RTS over total number of transmitted RTS packets.

Average backoff time
It is de ned as the time a packet needs to wait before transmitting.

Access probability
The probability of accessing the medium by a device in order to transmit a successful packet is denoted as access probability. It is calculated by measuring the total number of transmitted RTS over the number of free back-off slots. We measure the performance of WLAN networks considering the following scenario.

xed data

Normal Wi-Fi nodes have the lowest priority (AC[0]) and reader/stations have the highest priority (AC[3]) to access the medium. A reader receives tag`s id from the tag and the number of receipt data varies based on the number of tags that are present in its vicinity.We measure the performance of reader/station for a 3). Readers receive data from a xed number of reader/stations (reader = xed tag sleeping time. We

aggregate the received tag`s data upto 100 bytes (i.e., 10 IDs) so that the throughput of the overall network is maintained as the desired level. The plotted line with plus (+) represents reader/station and box

Figure 5.3: Performance evaluation of WLAN varying number of normal stations

Figure

5.3(a) illustrates the throughput of the WLAN networks. When the number

of normal stations increases from 8 to 40 the network traf c also increases. Hence, the throughput of AC[0] increases. On the other hand, the reader/station traf c load is almost same for the whole network as the number of tags and their transmitted IDs (data) are constant in the network and they are transmitted with high priority. We also aggregate the tag IDs that restuls the throughput for AC[3] is almost constant. Figure 5.3(b) illustrates

110

Chapter 5: Performance Evaluation

that the collision probability of the Wi-Fi normal nodes increases from 2% to 10% as the number of nodes increases.Number of collision for reader/stations is lower since they have the higher priority with the lower AIFSN and CW values. When the traf c load is smaller (i.e., the number of normal station 8,16, and 24) the collision probability of reader/station is almost zero. However, collision occurs for higher traf c load of normal stations, for instance, when the number of stations is 32, and 40. Figure 5.3(c) illustrates that the access probability for AC[0] increases as the number of nodes increases. Hence, the probability to access the medium decreases for increasing number of nodes. On the other hand, the access probability for AC[3] also slightly increases as the network traf c load increases. This shows that AC[0] nodes have small impact on traf c coming from AC[3] modes. In Figure 5.3(d) we observe that the AIFSN value for AC[3] increases for varying the number of normal nodes. That means, medium access is interrupted while accessing the medium due to the unavailability of the medium. There is a difference between the increase of

AIFSN value for AC[0] and AC[3], which is about 4% difference on an average.

Figure 5.4: Performance evaluation of WLAN varying number of normal stations

Figures 5.4(a) and 5.4(b) demonstrate the average backoff phase and average backoff time in slots. We see from the Figure 5.4(a) that the average backoff phase of reader/station is zero or negligible. This is because all the transmitted packets are successful within the 1st backoff phase and average backoff time (slot) that increases slightly. On the other hand, the average backoff phase for normal stations increases (Figure 5.4(a)) and the backoff time also increases from 14 to 133 slots on an average (Figure 5.4(b)). Figure 5.4(c) illustrates

112

Chapter 5: Performance Evaluation

that the probability of being in idle state decreases as the traf c load increases from node 8 to 40. When only 8 normal stations with AC[0] and 3 reader/stations with AC[3] work most of the time the nodes remain idle as the traf c load increases. They become busy whenever require to transmit data. Only 3 reader/stations are used for AC[3]. In this case, the total network load increases for increasing the number of normal nodes. Moreover, there is always a station that is ready to transmit. No packet drops are observed in Figure 5.4(d) since the network load is low having only two access category. Hence, the transmitted packet is successful within the 7th backoff phases that results the overall networks performance as is desired.

5.3

Discussion
5.1, 5.2 5.3 and 5.4), we observe that individual network

From the results (Figure

performs at the desired level. We see that the collision probability for both networks is very low. In RFID network, the collision probability is only 0.15% with a high traf c load, and is .07% for a medium traf c load (number of tags = 80). On the other hand, in WLAN network, the collision probability is 10% and 0.39% for a high traf c load but for the lower priority and higher priority nodes, respectively. This result demonstrates that both networks are not in interference by each other and the ratio of successful transmission is high. When two networks are integrated through the reader (works as a bridge), the throughput of the networks for lower priority nodes and higher priority nodes are in satisfactory level. The highest priority nodes are not affected by the lower priority nodes (observed in Figure 5.3). The QoS of the networks are also maintained. Thus, the proposed approach is ef cient to eliminate the problems of interference and co-existence for RFID and WLAN

Conclusion

In this thesis, we implemented a framework comprising of Radio Frequency Identi cation (RFID) and IEEE 802.11 WLAN technologies that eliminates the well-known coexistence and integration problems of these two widely used networks working in the same 2.45 GHz ISM frequency band. The IEEE 802.11 WLAN uses the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) protocol to improve the network quality of service (QoS). Both networks work in a time sharing manner using the medium access mechanisms of Point Coordination Function (PCF) and Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). In this framework, readers work as a special nodes and an interface between two networks to maintain the QoS. We simulate and measure the performance of this framework using Artifex simulation tool for only uplink communication. In the WLAN networks, we vary the number of ordinary stations for a xed data arrival rate and a xed number of reader/stations. We measure

the performance in terms of throughput, frame collision probability, packet drop probability, and access probability etc. In the RFID network part, we measure the performance in

114

Chapter 6: Conclusion

115

terms of collision probability, frame collision position etc. The collision probability decreases, as is desired, for increasing the sleeping time of tags and increases for increasing the number of tags. Results also show that when readers work as the highest priority station and Wi-Fi nodes as lower priority, they maintain the network accuracy as the desired level. Simulation results also show that the highest priority nodes are not affected by the lower priority nodes. Thus, we achieve the objective of this thesis work.
