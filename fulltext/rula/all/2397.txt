Abstract
A n expert system is a programmable device developed to provide automation fo r engineering problem solving. It is composed o f artificial intelligence modules, subroutine functions, and databases. U nder this framework, a design process is proposed to assist the conceptual design o f aerial vehicles' deploym ent systems. The problem is firs t defined by a set o f design requirements fo r takeoff, landing, and cruise. The values are then translated to a set o f performance parameters needed fo r the design process via a new ly developed parametric search algorithm. Such parameters are categorised by a fu z z y inference module to determine the most suitable deployment-propulsion system , fo r conventional and V /S T O L vehicles. Through the use o f linear and neural network regression, a num ber o f aerodynamic terms are estimated to support flig h t mechanics analyses, where the optimal takeoff and landing thrust vectors are determined. Engine specifications are deduced in term s o f u n it thrust, weight, bypass ratio and dimension. The design process demonstrates effectiveness in sizing engines fo r V /STO L operations.

1 INTRODUCTION
The design of an aerial vehicle is an enduring process. From initial analysis to the integration of com ponents, im m ense am ounts of aeronautical knowledge related to theories and design histories are involved. In consideration of data compilation and extensive

processing of decisions, the use of com putation technology may provide an efficient m ethod in aerial vehicle design. In this study, an expert system is developed as a software platform for the acquisition and application of aeronautical knowledge. A n expert system is the clustering of field specific knowledge, which provides decision m aking via the use of artificial intelligence, or AI. Expert systems are form ulated to "sim ulate h u m an expertise in a narrow dom ain" [1]. Applications of expert systems are found in m any engineering design developm ents [2,3]. With the advancem ent of AI and the progressive reliability of individual engineering software, expert systems have evolved to centralise know ledge and provide the com m unication interface across software platform s [4,5]. This includes com puter assisted design, simulation, database and optim isation algorithms. A t the sam e tim e, due to their specialised problem solving nature, the transfer and reusability of know ledge are often limited. Individual system m ust then be modified or reconfigured to solve new or variants of the same problem. To construct a reusable expert system, it is

necessary to establish an efficient fram ework for the organisation of knowledge, and to prom ote unrestricted know ledge acquisition capabilities. Consequently, large scale problem s that require expert know ledge from different dom ains may then be solved, i.e., the design of aerial vehicles. The term aerial vehicle broadly includes devices that are controllable during atm ospheric flight including unm anned vehicles, utility props, jet transports, etc. Traditional airplane

design first investigates all mission requirem ents and prioritises them accordingly. Once the design options are evaluated, com ponents are fitted and sized based on such requirem ents [4]. D ue to the bread th of airplane design knowledge, this study confines the problem of conceptual design by specialising in the selection of deploym ent propulsion system, i.e., for takeoff and landing. This is governed by the selection and thrust output of propulsion

system s. Since the takeoff phase of a vehicle typically requires the m axim um perform ance of engines, the resultant engine specifications are thus good m easures of the general thrust requirem ents. This study investigates the perform ance dom ain of jet based deploym ent

system s. C onventional takeoff vehicles have thrust to w eight ratio of about 0.4, and about 1.2 for vehicles w ith V/STOL capability. This dem onstrates that the dem and for thrust varies considerably depending on the deploym ent requirem ents [6,7]. In addition, the issues of

th ru st assisted lift, propulsive efficiency and vehicle stability need to be addressed in the layout an d the sizing of engine units. As such, the design of deploym ent systems not only requires conventional airplane design knowledge [7], but also the developm ent background of V/STOL vehicles [8]. Im plem entation of know ledge relating to the above into the expert system perm its the use of AI tow ards the autom ation of mission requirem ent analysis systematically. Hence, this research aim s to accom plish tw o goals: 1. Develop an expert system framework that is expandable, subject to solving various engineering problems. This fram ework is given the name of E^. 2. Form ulate a process of deploym ent design know n as D^, w ithin the establishm ent of E3. This report first provides some insights of vehicle design specific to V/STOL. Then,

tow ards the establishm ent of E^, aspects of expert system are presented including the com ponents of AI com ponents. Utilising the resources of knowledge and expert system for analysis, and the final

construction, the m ission requirem ents of vehicles are fed into deploym ent system is proposed.

Referencing to existing airframes, interm ediate and final

o u tp u t results are validated in different perspectives for thrust based propulsion systems.

2 DEPLOYMENT DESIGN KNOWLEDGE
2.1 General Vehicle Design
N ew designs begin from a set of mission requirem ent, and are p u t forth to the conceptual phase of design. The phase analyses each of the design requirem ents and investigates the available design options. The available options are often categorised according to their For example, the selection of a w ing involves

structural or flight mechanics properties.

characteristics like: tapered or elliptical, positive or negative dihedral, sw ept forw ard or backw ard, etc. These are determ ined from flight requirem ents and histories of related designs, i.e., num erical analysis and categorical data trend studies [7], Sim ilar literature relating to aerial vehicle design has classified knowledge is as follows [3]: 1. Governing knowledge: i.e., scientific laws and air traffic regulations. 2. C onfiguration knowledge: relating to individual components and the interactions am ong them. 3. Design process: solving the design problem efficiently. The above descriptions of design knowledge are im plem ented into the subroutine and database m odules of and are integrated into the process of D^.

2.2

V/STOL Design
Since the 1950s, num erous V/STOL concepts, such as 'fan in wing' and 'tilt wing' have been

tested [9,10,11].

A lthough m any did not succeed to production developm ents, they have

identified key areas to be overcome for the design of V/STOL vehicles:  T hrust efficiency, as significant losses may incur upon the redirection of engine exhaust  Integration of airfram e and pow er plant, influencing the structural and flight dynam ics of a vehicle  Stability and control, particularly at low speed and during the transition from lift to cruise thrust The progress of V/STOL research w as profoundly driven by the need for carrier based operations. This is dem onstrated by the production of the Yak-38 and the Yak-41 [10]. Later, the AV-8 and the F-35B of Figure 1 provide definite roles in naval operations.

Figure 1: AV-8 [12] and F-35B

In addition, due to the high tem perature and the high velocity of engine exhaust gas, jet V/STOL designs m u st properly address the following ground induced phenom ena [8]:  Recirculation of high tem perature exhaust into the induction system, reducing the th ru st perform ance of engines  G eneration of a low pressure region beneath the vehicle from the high velocity exhaust, such that the vehicle experiences a suck dow n effect  Secondary lift effect from the rebound of exhaust gas from the ground It w as later realised that the high fuel consum ption rate during the phase of vertical deploym ent has significantly lim ited the vehicle's mission effectiveness in aspects such as speed an d payload capacity. This gives rise to the concept of short takeoff and landing systems. M ost short takeoff designs originated from modifications of production designs. For exam ple, the C-1 transport w as converted to the Aska research aircraft w ith the takeoff lift provided by u p p er surface blowing of engine exhaust [13]; and mechanical thrust vectoring nozzles w ere equipped on the research m odels of the F-15 and the F/A-18 [14]. Throughout such dynam ic history of V/STOL research, there are several types of deploym ent system s that d em onstrated m ission effectiveness and production feasibility. The following is a discussion of the six configuration types, in which some posses both conventional and V/STOL capabilities. The helicopter rotor system is fundam entally designed for vertical takeoff. This

configuration is referred to as A = H , where A is a variable expressing the configuration type. Since the rotor is aligned w ith to the vertical axis of the vehicle for lift thrust, the forw ard speed is generally lim ited w ithin the low subsonic regime. Due to the relative size of the rotors, th ru st is produce by providing m om entum to a large mass flow. Consequently,

helicopters' rotor system s have the highest propulsive efficiency am ong other propulsion types.

The tiltprop configuration, A --P , describes general propeller driven vehicles w ith em phasis on th ru st pitch m echanism from 0° to 90° that enable V/STOL operations. Figure 2 is a layout of such production design featuring the V-22 Osprey. This configuration portrays b o th the vertical takeoff capability helicopters and the efficiency of propellers for m id subsonic flight [8].

i
Figure 2: Schematic of the V-22 tiltprop [13]

Upper surface blowing, A = f / , is a technique of jet based propulsion system that enables high lift at low speeds. As depicted in Figure 3, this configuration of the engine over the m ain w in g causes the high velocity exhaust to generate very low pressure, thereby enhancing lift [8] an d shortening the ground roll distance for takeoff. Vehicles w ith upper engine configuration are confined w ithin m id to high subsonic speeds due the presence of engine nacelle as flow speed increases above the w ing [15]. Hence, the cruise speed rem ains well below the

supersonic regime. Type U configurations have been deployed on military, m edium speed jet transports such as the An-72 in Figure 4.

Situation of engine units are norm ally below the w ing for transport vehicles, w here they do n o t require enhanced takeoff capabilities. Yet this conventional engine configuration, A = C , m ay be configured for V/STOL operations by the deflection of engine exhaust d o w n w ard s via the m ain w ing or flaps. Related studies have shown that interactions of engine exhaust an d the m ain w ing increases the effective lift coefficient as a function of the thrust 5

[8,16].

Type C configurations are found to be effective on the C-17 and other m ilitary The draw back of this design is the deflection of flow that inevitably causes a

reduction in effective thrust. Experimental results reveal that loss of thrust via type C engine deflection is relatively higher than type U configurations described previously [17,18]. T hrust m ay be used to enhance lift by the vectoring of nozzles. This is typically found on V/STOL capable aircrafts w here the entire propulsion system is fully integrated into the m ain body; e.g. perform ance fighters. In early stages of research, it w as strongly believed th at the red u n d an cy provided by m ultiple engine units is required for vertical takeoff in the case of an engine failure. The progressive increase in engine reliability has enabled V/STOL operation via a single lift-cruise engine unit for both lift and cruise thrust, A = S , reducing the w eight of the deploym ent system and enhancing the overall mission effectiveness of the vehicle. The type S configuration supports V/STOL operations by balancing betw een the compressor th ru st and turbine th ru st about the vehicle's centre of gravity [19,20]. Careful arrangem ent of engine exhaust w ith respect to the m ain w ing reduces the effects of suck down, and the force of rebounding air m ay be maximised. In corollary, cool com pressor thrust is circulated to the induction system, elim inating the effect of hot air ingestion. In practice, a large bypass

com pressor flow is required to balance the thrust produced by the exhaust during vertical deploym ent. Thus, the frontal area of the AV-8 is apparently large to accom modate the engine installation. This has lim ited the vehicle's flight envelope w ithin the subsonic regime. Shown in Figure 5 are the FI 19 engine of the X-32 and the Pegasus engine of the AV-8. The FI 19 core th ru st nozzle pitches u p to 20°. The resultant pitching m om ent is balanced w ith the

com pressor th ru st during short takeoff operations.

Recalling the early stages of V/STOL research, developers at Yakovlev had realised that type S design m ay n o t satisfy both vertical takeoff and supersonic cruise requirem ents [10]. A dual lift-cruise deploym ent system, A = D , bridges tw o such design requirem ents by separating the propulsion departm ent for takeoff and for cruise. This type D system perm its

m ore design freedom in term s of airfram e integration and the transfer of propulsive power. Figure 6 presents tw o production designs that utilise type D system configurations. A lthough the Yak-38 w as successful at perform ing vertical deploym ent and supersonic flight, the unused w eights of the lift engines during cruise have set back its operation range. suspected th at significant time was required to engage the lift engines [10]. It w as also The above

concerns have been perceived in the developm ent of the short takeoff F-35B. The m ultirole fighter utilises a 90° sw ivelling nozzle and a lift fan that is driven by the core engine through a gearbox, w hich is responsible for disengaging the lift fan during cruise. The lift com ponent is therefore light w eight and consume on engine load during other phases of flight. PH #O M lv * th r«

3.2

Parametric Problem Solving
A problem solving alg orithm is developed to autom ate the execution of subroutines

corresponding to the problem specified. As a com ponent of AI, this param etric search m odule provides extensive support to the mathematical formulation of engineering problems. The search begins by uploading the know n param eters and the unknow n param eters as null entries to the blackboard memory, as indicated on the top of Figure 11. D uring the operation of the search, the validity of each subroutine of the knowledge base is evaluated by com paring the kno w n and unknow n param eters of the blackboard against the input and output of each subroutine indexed by the first tw o lines of Figure 8. The matching subroutine is then

perform ed, solving for the unknow n values. In cases where there are no exact matches found, the algorithm executes any solvable subroutine based only on the available input. The

corresponding outputs are returned to the blackboard as additional resources for the next search recursion. This process is iterated until, or all unknow n param eters are found or all solvable subroutines have been executed. In effect, a solution is determ ined through a search of the know ledge base.

Fuzzy Reasoning
G eneral AI system s are m ade up of decisive rules such as 'if a then b'. However, it is

difficult for conventional logic to evaluate such a rule w hen a o rb are expressed qualitatively. H ere, fuzzy reasoning provides the means to evaluate qualitative values by first classifying num erical values. Figure 12 show s the takeoff distance, fuzzified into three categories

represented by three m em bership functions. The degree of m em bership Ô , a scale betw een 0 an d 1, determ ines the applicability of the categorical definition, or sim ply how well a m em bership describes a value.

H ence, rules th at ap p ear to be conflicting in discrete logic may now be sim ultaneously applied, such as:
'If takeoff is vertical...' 'if takeoff is short...' 'if takeoff is horizontal...'

The w eight of each rule is fundam entally dependent on the degree of m em bership describing the terms. The influence of each rule may be aggregated through a num ber of m ethods, resulting in a fuzzy, or defuzzified output value. The developm ent of utilises the

Fuzzy Inference System interface provided by Matlab to deduce a qualitative description of the deploym ent configuration as part of the expert system's knowledge base.

3.4

Neural Network Regression
A irplane design often requires statistical data for prelim inary analysis, w herein

conventional curve fitting m ethods are often used. However, it may be difficult for convention curve fits to m odel complex behaviour of data presented. The concept of neural netw ork was recognised to be a valuable tool in pattern recognition in the 1980s [23], e.g., in predicting u n k n o w n functions. Like a biological neuron, a single unit of an artificial neuron sum m ates and evaluates inputs through an activation function. If activated, the neuron sends an output signal linking to other neurons or interprets the final output. The associated w eight factor of each n euron changes to adapt to a specified output. This training process enables the learning capability for interconnected neurons, or a neural network. A m ong various types, the generalised regression neural netw ork is found to be m ost com pliant in function approxim ations [24]. This is provided that the num ber of sample data for training is sufficient and are reasonably distributed over the dom ain to be m odelled.

* The vector is unique provided that the membership functions do not share a single axis of symmetry along the measuring value. -]2 r ; ' n p

Furtherm ore, the use of neural network compromises a value on non unique data b y w eighting averages, e.g., the data that is m arked jc in Figure 13, whereas m athem atical curve fits often encounter difficulties in this respect.

In the interest of this study, series of sample data are fed into a neural netw ork; and a scalar o u tp u t is considered, corresponding to a m ultiple input single output system. neural netw ork adapts to each sam ple record of input [a, The

] by changing the w eighing

param eters to the target ou tp u t x. A complete set of sample training data is represented in equation 2: «1 6, ··· A trained neural netw ork m ay then approximate an output value x, given an arbitrary in p u t vector [a^ a j . Hence, a neural netw ork m ay be seen as an approxim ation function X,

In a generalised regression neural network, the response of the netw ork to each sam ple d ata can be adjusted via an adaptive parameter®. This param eter governs the degree of

influence on x by nearby sam ple data. Refer again to Figure 13; the smaller adaptive value corresponds closely to the actual data plots. As the param eter is increased, the netw ork tends to generalise the system. However, this m ay not be absolutely desirable; and the netw ork may not produce estim ations over a wide domain. Based on the generalised regression neural netw ork algorithm of Matlab, provides an The

algorithm to autom atically generate a netw ork given a database of training samples.

algorithm also serves to scale the adaptive parameter, beginning from a small ini tied estim ation. Then, should the network fail in producing an estimate, the adaptive value is increased to sim ulate a more general approximation. However, since the adjustm ent of the adaptive param eter m ust be proportional to the m agnitude of the training values, it is often difficult to project how m uch the param eter m ust be increased. Here, regulates this by

norm alising the training data w ith respect to an average, such that the range of data can be condensed. This repetitive task of training and calibration of neural netw ork requires a

significant am ount of com putation resources that is proportional to the size of the training database`s.

Deployment Design Process
C onstructed w ithin the knowledge base, the deploym ent design subroutine derives a

deploym ent system m ost suitable to the design requirem ents, by netw orking w ith AI, subroutines, and databases under the establishment of E^. The process of is divided into

five analysis phases, as described in Figure 14. The process is initiated by a user specified set of in p u ts and is converted to the standard performance parameters, know n as the primary inputs:

®This Is also known as the measure of spread [21]. " The neural network module of E ® also serves to approximate values that are missing In the training data by successive generation of neural networks. However, this is not recommended as estimation errors may easily propagate such that the accuracy of the network Is reduced.

For exam ple, the fuzzy m o d u le m ay in terp ret the Boeing 747 as a heavy, transonic vehicle th at takeoff and land conventionally, in other w ords, horizontally. Next, the general design and specialised V/STOL k n o w led g e are translated into fuzzy rules. Some are:

Since the scale of 'con fig u ratio n ' is based on an arbitrary scale from Figure 16 and does not represent a m eaningful quantity, an additional refuzzification subroutine determ ines the configuration type A s^i^cied th at m ost describes the o u tp u t quantity, along w ith its degree of

Flight Characteristics Sequence
The estim ations of basic flight characteristics are necessary in the sup p o rt of perform ance

This m odule hypothesises the aerodynam ics properties regarding the vehicle of

interest. R elated statistical d ata are queried from A.3. From this point on, analysis refers only to th ru st b ased p ro p u lsio n system s of type U, C, S, D.

" Alternatively, equation 15 can be expressed in the form of a nonlinear differential equation, where the boundary conditions are given by the initial and final takeoff displacements. An optimal thrust vector can be found at each increment of time, thereby producing an optimal takeoff trajectory of thrust pitch. Full solution is not presented here due to the extensiveness of the final expression. Note the local areas of instabilities, i.e., jittering of the curve, due to the step size of numerical integration. This must be suppressed in actual simulation. Here, it does not obstruct the purpose of this demonstration. = More appropriately, the takeoff thrust for V/STOL vehicles should include an excess thrust needed for reaction control

24

As discussed in section 2, type U and C engine systems achieve V/STOL via the change of flow fields above and below the m ain wing, respectively, for an increase of lift. The increase in lift can be stated as a function of thrust [16]:

The increase of lift resulting from equation 20 indicates that the takeoff criterion of equation 18 m ay be achieved sooner, thereby reducing the thrust required of each takeoff simulation. The effects of u p p er surface blow ing and the deflection of engine thrust below the w ing are strongly dependent on the arrangem ent betw een the engines and the m ain wing. Section A.5 attem pts to m odel various U and C type designs via experimental and flight test results found in related researches [16,27].

5 RESULTS
5.1 Fuzzy Module
The m em bership functions and the govem ing rules of the fuzzy inference m odule discussed in section 4.2 are determ ined to reflect actual airframe designs. This fuzzy system is found to be 90% in accordance w ith the deploym ent configurations of airframes found in A.3.1. Since the fuzzy m odel accounts for merely four input variables, it cannot achieve full accuracy due to exclusion of other design factors that have definite impact on propulsion settings, e.g., flight agility. Table 1 presents full comparisons of actual designs against the fuzzy results in shaded areas, including the fuzzified input values, the selected configuration type, its degree of m em bership, an d the next viable configuration option following the flowchart of fuzzy reasoning in Figure 17. It is realised that the fuzzy definitions of and m ay be

better interpreted on u nit m ass bases to portray vehicles of different sizes. Results of A are congruent to actual designs w ith relatively high confidence levels of certainty, as indicated by S . N ote for the Ka-22, the fuzzy system proposes a helicopter configuration,

w hereas the actual Ka-22 is a tiltprop design. This reflects the incapability of the fuzzy system to determ ine the configurations w ithout the input of the service altitude, which differentiates the type H an d type P designs.

Neural Module
Results of the neural netw ork regression closely portray actual values of conventional

designs. H ow ever, since the am ount of training data describing unconventional designs is relatively small, particularly for V/STOL vehicles, the ability of neural netw orks to recognise such designs is consequently less proficient. This problem may be solved by first filtering the training data for only V/STOL vehicles. Yet this sacrifices the accuracy of neural estim ation d ue to the lim ited num ber of filtered data. Here, neural networks are trained by a set of thirty to fifty sam ple airplane data queried from the database of airframes A.3.1. The influence of neural estim ations errors on latter flight mechanics calculation can be seen on Figure 26 and Figure 27 in section 5.3. O utputs of are em phasised in grey w ithin each table. It is evident that estim ation of

Table 2 show s the neural estim ation of aspect ratio.

V/STOL vehicles, such as the An-72 and the C-17A, is less precise, due to the scarcity of relevant d ata for training. The result for the Su-30 is also significantly underestim ated, which is suspected to be caused by the lack of training data at high Mach regime. It was also found th at cr also varies considerably w ith respect to the agility of supersonic m ilitary vehicles. Hence, th e adaptive param eter of M is configured higher to somewhat m aintain the netw ork's generalisation.

N o errors are attributed to the estimation of GR. Mk 7 and the Eurofighter 2000 based on an identical n eural netw ork training data entry. It is found that if the network becomes more reliant on by the adjustm ent of the adaptive parameter, better results are produced. It is

expected th at the inclusion of other engine performance param eters such as fuel consum ption m ay enhance the overall accuracy of P neural approximation. In the neural interpolation of d , sample results of Table 6 convincingly show that equation 33 is a good estim ator for geometric sizing w ith respect to the design airframe. Note th at the m agnitude of errors of the last two entries implies the coverage of training data is less com petent in speculating w ith thrust input that are too high or too low.

Flight Mechanics
The determ ination of takeoff thrust is a critical step tow ards the selection of a deploym ent

system. Hence, the num erical m ethod from section 4.4 is verified w ith three sample results, collectively presented in Table 7, where calculations are shown in gray. Note that is

the respective optim um

angle. Result of sam ple A reveals that the numerical solution of takeoff is w ithin 2.45% margin from the reference literature [6]. This m agnitude of error is solely contributed by the difference in num erical m odeling m ethods. Meanwhile, the same calculation of the inputs from sam ple B indicates an optim al thrust pitch angle of 15 ° is predicted to save 15.7% of thrust relative to the n o n pitching design. D ata of sample C is obtained from appendix A.3.1, which sim ulates the vectored takeoff of the Sea H arrier at a ground roll of 305m. The takeoff profile is found in

6 CONCLUSION
The developm ent of the expandable engineering expert system design process and the deploym ent have been presented in this study. The developm ent combined elements of

AI and existing airplane design knowledge. The resultant new design approach has been evaluated at different levels. It is found that the use of fuzzy classification of airplane types have accurately portrayed actual designs. Despite the inherent numerical uncertainties from d ata sources, the use of neural netw ork regression in predicting flight characteristics is precise an d efficient, in which it supports further analysis of performance requirem ent of the p ropulsion system. N um erical simulation results of takeoff and landing were verified with referenced sources. Calculations of gross thrust reveal that produces the m ost accurate

engine specifications based on the deploym ent requirements of takeoff, in which this study is dedicated to accomplish. Overall, the output param eters clearly describe the deploym ent an economical design

system s at the expense of five prim ary input parameters, m aking

process. The design case studies of various vehicle types have further proven D^, in which the capabilities of the expert system was effectively utilised. E^ itself has dem onstrated the

versatility in m anaging knowledge in various forms. This asset is crucial for modifications and interdisciplinary problem solving. This is based on the simple, yet organisational, expert

system platform and AI analysis tools provided by Matlab and developed in this study. As w ith m ost com putational analyses, more accurate data w ould have positive effects on the results of D^. This will enable more sophisticated design process know ledge to be

im plem ented. It is hypothesised that the categorisation of vehicle types prior to data or flight m echanics calculations m ay significantly improve the error margin to less than 20%. This is based on the low error margins of results found on the remote areas of the x axes in Figure 26 and Figure 27. The process of categorisation may involve modification of the existing fuzzy m odule w ith additional inputs and outputs. A lthough presented as an open loop design process, the logical sequence of may be

m odified to incorporate other design factors. For example, FAR® 23 states that single engine light vehicles m ust have an upper limit of stall speed. This statem ent can only be verified after the engine sizing sequence. Thus, this can be im plem ented as in Figure 28.

The above m odels are used to sim ulate takeoff of a num ber of vehicles. A thrust recovery factor of 0.71 com pensates for losses through aerodynam ic deflection of exhaust [26]. This is applied to b o th U an d C type takeoffs. The table below shows the calculated thrust requirem ents derived from the above V/STOL models. The idealisation of the above takeoff m odels via linear

interpolation has yielded significant underestim ations of the actual thrust.

It is n oted th at the second neural network is comparatively accuracy w ith respect to the first netw ork. Since the param eter S is not a prim ary input value, it may be necessary to first estimate S , e.g., via equation 8. However, successive estimations of param eters may lead to possible error am plification tow ards the prediction of v^,^,, . The third neural network is unable to distinguish die stall characteristics of regional jets from military vehicles from the results of RJlOO and MiG-31, in w hich this is provided by the param eters M or S .
