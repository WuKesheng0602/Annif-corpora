ABSTRACT
Three-Dimensional Modeling of the Rotation Effect on the Growth of Gei-xSix by the Traveling Solvent Method

Master of Applied Science 2004, Theodore J. Makriyannis School of Graduate Studies, Ryerson University
The traveling solvent method known as TSM is a process used to produce pure and homogeneous crystals. The TSM process has been tested on many alloys producing uniform and uncontaminated crystal products. A three-dimensional

numerical simulation for the growth o f Gei.xSix by the traveling solvent method under axial rotation has been modeled. In this model a mesh sensitivity analysis has been carried out to find an optimum mesh which provides accurate results while saving computational time. The full Navier-Stokes equations together with the

energy, mass transport and continuity equations were solved numerically using the finite element technique. The application o f crucible rotation to the traveling solvent method is an attempt to control the buoyancy induced convection throughout the melt and to suppress the three-dimensional characteristics o f unsteady heat flow. The

application of different rotational speeds on the solvent has also been investigated. These different speeds o f rotation were shown to have a considerable effect on the buoyancy induced flow. The solute distribution throughout the melt was also

affected substantially. Taking these two factors into account plays a crucial role in the crystal growth process. The speed o f rotation was found to have a significant effect on the intensity o f the convective flow in the melt and an optimal rotational speed was encountered.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction

W ith today's technological demands, the production o f purer crystal structures o f semiconductor materials is required to increase the performance o f all m odem electronics. This includes telecommunications to consumer electronics, from gam ing consoles to life saving medical equipment. The performance o f these

semiconductor materials is reliant on the consistent internal arrangement o f the atoms w ithin the three-dimensional crystal structure being uniform and uncontam inated. Each crystal structure can be broken down into a single unit cell which is the smallest configuration o f arranged atoms that give the m aterial its unique characteristics. W hen these unit cells are repeated next to each otlier a crystal lattice is formed. To ensure the highest level o f purity, homogeneity and crystalline perfection, these crystals have to be grown under very specific conditions. Today one o f the most popular methods o f crystal growth encompassing these very specific conditions is crystallization from the melt. Unfortunately, this scheme o f crystal growth has

complications which arise that do not allow the crystal to be grown in a perfect threedimensional arrangement o f atoms or molecules. These complications have a

generalized name called grovrth defects. These growth defects include vacancies (a m issing atom in the crystal lattice), interstitials (an extra atom that has squeezed itself into the crystal lattice), substitutionals (an atom that has replaced an atom o f the crystal lattice), dislocations (atoms that are misaligned in the crystal lattice) and grain boundaries (two small grains of crystal having different crystallographic

orientations). All these defects lead to the reduction o f the grown crystal's quality. Thus the research o f crystal growth is intended to closer explain the relation between the resulting crystal quality, the physical properties and the growth parameters.

T he influence o f gravity on crystal grow th is a large factor in flu en cin g the

grow th process as it is the cause o f the buoyant force which affects the mechanisms o f m ass and heat transport throughout the system. W ith gravity on Earth known as the terrestrial condition, the hotter less dense fluid in the crystal m elt rises while cooler denser fluid sinks. This is the convective flow that leads to the irregular

spread o f the dopant as w ell as considerably effecting the perfection of the growing crystal. This is the m otivation behind research in microgravity conditions, such as that onboard the International Space Station where there will be no buoyancy induced convection or hydrostatic pressure, which can lead to a better understanding o f crystal growth. Currently there are a num ber o f different methods o f crystal growth from the melt that are being studied. All these techniques require similar conditions throughout the m elt in order to obtain optimum growth conditions. Some o f these conditions include having a symmetric heat distribution, a symmetric flow, a smoothed concentration o f dopant along the growth interface, and an interface containing the least amount o f curvature as possible [1]. The m ost popular o f these techniques are the Bridgm an technique, the Czochralski growth technique, the float zone technique and the traveling solvent m ethod (TSM), also known as the traveling heater method (THM).

The Bridgman technique was designed for the purpose o f growing metallic crystals. An ampoule contains the melt which is translated through the axial

temperature gradient in a furnace. W ith this technique the whole feed material is .molten and a two zone vertical furnace is used for the crystal growth. The upper heater is at a higher tem perature keeping the feed material in a liquid state while the lower heater is slightly cooler allowing the crystal to form. This technique allows for the shape o f the growing crystal to be controlled by the crucible, but by the crucible having contact with the m elt and the crystal, strain is caused which may result in differently aligned crystals known as grain boundaries.

Research has been done on the Bridgman technique by Ouyang et al. [2] who modeled a numerical sim ulation for steady-state Bridgman growth and found that the curvature o f the melt interface depends on the variations o f thermal conductivities. M artinez-Tomaz et al. [3] showed that CdTe has a very long response time in attaining a stationary value o f both the growth rate and the axial thermal gradient using the Bridgman technique. Lan et al. [4] conducted a three-dimensional analysis o f flow and segregation w ith the application o f axial and transversal magnetic fields applied to the Bridgman technique where the transverse magnetic field was found to be more effective in suppressing the convection throughout the system.

In the Czochralski technique, the polycrystalline material is first melted in a heated crucible until the desired initial temperature field is reached. To initiate

crystal growth a small crystal seed is dipped into the m elt and pulled vertically upward from the m elt in a way so that the crystal grows at a constant diameter except for the initial and final stages. The crystal rod and crucible are usually rotated in opposite directions to reduce asymmetries in the temperature gradient and to promote better mixing o f the melt. W ith this technique there is difficulty in predicting reliably the shapes o f the three free boundaries between the crystal, the melt and the gas, and the dynamics o f the triple point adjacent to all three phases [5].

The Czochralski technique has been studied by Ziao et al. [6] who developed a CZ simulation for quick realistic computations on personal computers. The

effectiveness o f this method was illustrated with a semiconductor compound CZ growth system. This package was lacking the incorporation o f a moving crystal/melt interface and transient phenomena. Tanaka et al. [7] studied the melt surface

temperature in CZ silicon growth. It was found that depending on crucible rotation rates the temperature changed in four observable patterns. Vizman et al. [8] modeled a three-dimensional numerical simulation o f thermal convection and made comparisons to experimental results. High amplitudes o f temperature fluctuations were discovered to exist near the solidification interface. The numerical and

experimental results were found to be in close agreement deep inside the melt rather than those close to the solidification interface.

The float zone technique commonly applied in microgravity conditions contains a melt zone between a lower seed material and an upper feed rod. This melt zone is maintained by applying localized heating where the melt zone is translated upwards along the rod so that the crystal is growing on the seed and at the same time melting the feed material. The system is kept crucible free and the melt is held in place by surface tension. W ith terrestrial conditions, the melt zone height is limited as the liquid will run if the molten zone is too large. This limits the possible diameter of crystals grown under gravity. In microgravity the maximum zone height is given by the circumference o f the crystal [9].

Saghir et al. [10] conducted a numerical simulation o f float zone crystal growth o f Bi]2 GeO 20 under terrestrial and microgravity conditions. M icrogravity

conditions showed a weaker convection resulting in a much more stable float zone. Campbell et al. [11] grew Gcj.xSix (x < 1 0 %) single crystal with the float zone technique. Deviations were observed from regular convex interface morphology as a function o f silicon concentration. This only occurred with the combination o f free melt surfaces, which indicated that it was due to solutal Marangoni convection which occurs when surface tension is present. Dold et al. [12] measured the growth rates o f float zone silicon crystals using the heat pulse technique. The heat pulses generated finely spaced periodic time markers which overlay the dopant inhomogeneities caused by the instabilities in the melt. Dopant striations were formed that were not completely parallel to the markers, which showed the influence o f concentration variation in the boundary layer.

The traveling solvent method is another very promising technique used to produce pure and homogeneous crystals. The TSM process has been tested on many alloys producing uniform and uncontaminated crystal products. The ampoule in this system contains the seed material at the bottom, the m elt in the middle and the feed material on top. This method goes through the melt phase differently than in the Bridgman, Czochralski and float zone techniques. In the Bridgman technique there is no feed rod on top o f the melt; in the Czochralski there is a melt between the solution and the seed; and in the float zone technique surface tension holds the m elt together. The greatest difference between the TSM method and other melt growth methods is that o f the material composition where the top two stages differ in order to successfully apply a lower heater thermal gradient to the system. This allows for two things. Firstly, with the lower heater thermal gradient, the crystal can be grown with less heater thermal stresses. Secondly, rather than melting the feed material, it is softened and the dopant is induced to diffuse into the solution zone giving a m uch smoother concentration transition. The way in which the TSM method works is, the heated solution zone passes through the polycrystalline feed rod in order to grow the single crystal. This solution zone is heated by radiation usually given o ff by halogen lamps encompassed in a mirror furnace. This TSM ampoule which contains the

crystal, solution zone and the feed rod is then translated through the common focus o f the furnace's mirrors at a rate o f about 4mm/day. Since the TSM process takes place

at a low er temperature than other conventional methods, contamination from the container is reduced. The reduced operating temperature also leads to a lower

ambient pressure within the growth environment, a reduced risk o f ampoule fracture, and a reduction in the crystal's defect density.

M atasumoto et al. [13] carried out a numerical simulation o f friP crystal growth by the traveling solvent method. It was found that in the case o f strong buoyancy convection, constitutional super cooling tended to occur near the interface, whereas it did not appear in the case o f weak buoyancy convection. Lent et al. [14] performed a numerical simulation o f TSM growth o f ternary semiconductor materials under suppressed gravity conditions. It was found that the position o f the thermal profile severely affected the characteristics and stability o f the growing crystal. Various levels o f applied magnetic field were applied, aligned and misaligned. An upper limit o f misalignment was found at which increased alignment would cause the growth interface to lose stability. The convective flow due to small misalignment was fotmd to increase mixing in the horizontal plane and was beneficial for the growth process. Martinez-Tomas et al. [15] studied the effects o f thermal conditions in the TSM growth o f HgTe. The study showed the heat transfer between the furnace and the ampoule for central positions increased the length o f the liquid zone. The calculated concentration field showed a uniform concentration core in the liquid zone and a step concentration along the growth interfaces indicating the importance o f convection.

The TSM has also been used in conjunction with a rotating magnetic field (RMF) in an attempt to slow buoyancy-induced convection while processing CdTe crystal [16]. The influence of the magnetic field was tested under terrestrial and microgravity conditions. The study showed that under microgravity conditions the application of the RM F can be used to overcome residual buoyancy-induced convection and used to control the uniformity o f the solution-zone composition at the growth front without appreciable modification o f the growth interface shape [16].

Studies have been done with steady and accelerated crucible rotation added to the crystal growth system. The application o f rotation to the system is an attempt to further control the convective flow throughout the melt. W ith rotation, it has been

found that convection and dopant segregation can be affected considerably and the effect is similar to that o f an axial magnetic field [17]. Ampoule rotation decreases the intensity o f convection and stretches the flow axially. W hen convection is weak, flow can be suppressed almost completely by ampoule rotation and the dopant becomes diffusion-controlled. Lan et al. [17] studied the effects of ampoule rotation on the flow and dopant segregation in the vertical Bridgman crystal growth.

Okano et al. [18] applied THM to the numerical modeling o f a simulation for the growth of GaSb from a Ga-solution. The effects o f crucible temperature, rotation and material on the crystal interface shape were studied. It was found that with The

increasing crucible temperature, the interface curvature became larger.

application o f rotation was successful in suppressing the natural convection in the solution and in obtaining an interface with less curvature. With lower crucible

temperatures, the interface shape was slightly convex toward the crystal and the effect o f crucible rotation was not significant.

Lan et al. [19] found that the use o f steady ampoule rotation is effective in suppressing 3D characteristics o f unsteady heat flow. Ampoule rotation o f only 10 rpm suppressed the 3D effects considerably both on symmetry breaking and unsteadiness. It was also shown that, for the asymmetric growth condition due to ampoule tilting or asymmetric heating, ampoule rotation was effective in minimizing the asymmetry. Lan et al. [20] also studied the effects o f steady ampoule rotation versus accelerated rotation on vertical zone melting crystal growth. It was found that the steady ampoule rotation, at low speeds o f 3-5 rpm significantly affected the heat flow and the interface shape. achieved. Interface inversion from concave to convex was

With the same rotation speed, it was found that with the accelerated

crucible rotation technique (ACRT) showed similar effects but was less effective. ACRT was found to induce severe growth and re-melting that could be responsible for growth striations. Bars et al. [21] conducted a two-dimensional numerical study o f convection during THM growth o f CdTe w ith accelerated crucible rotation. Their research showed that ACRT is effective in increasing mixing in the solution zone and in obtaining higher growth rate limits.

In this thesis, a three-dimensional numerical simulation for the growth of Gej.xSix by the traveling solvent method has been carried out with the application o f crucible rotation. The crucible rotation is an attempt to control the buoyancy induced convection throughout the m elt and to suppress the three-dimensional characteristics o f unsteady heat flow. Speeds o f up to 10 rpm have been considered, as references [18-20] have shown that these speeds are more than sufficient to observe a considerable change in flow throughout the solution zone. These rotational speeds have been applied to both the terrestrial and microgravity condition. Since all

furnaces have a lagging heater profile, which in some cases, may be so small that it goes unnoticed, the heating element will produce unsymmetrical heating throughout the system. So, in this thesis, the uniform heating and non-uniform heating condition have been studied. It is the intention o f this thesis that by applying symmetrical and unsymmetrical heating to the crystal growth system to closer explain experimentally obtained results and to observe if added ampoule rotation can benefit or improve the growing crystal's quality.

CHAPTER 2 Theory and Setup
2.0 Traveling solvent method

The TSM process has three main phases. The first phase is the starting phase where the Geo.85 Sio.15 polycrystalline feed rod is on top o f the un-melted Geo ggSio.oz polycrystalline material which is above the Ge seed crystal. This phase is complete when the heater has heated up and melted the Ge 0 .9 gSi0.02 material and steady state has been achieved throughout the molten zone. W hen a steady state has been

accomplished, the second phase begins where the heater begins to slowly translate up the polycrystalline feed rod allowing the new single crystal to form along the growth interface and allowing the silicon to diffuse through the solvent from the dissolution interface. Since silicon has a higher melting temperature than germanium, it allows for the solvent to be at the molten state without melting the feed material and allowing the silicon to be softened so it can slowly diffuse into the melt. W hen the heater has traveled the full length o f the rod the second phase has been completed. In the third phase, the heater is shut off and the molten zone at the top of the newly formed single crystal is allowed to cool and solidify ending the crystal growth process. This is shown in Figure 2.1.

2.1 Model Description

A three-dimensional numerical simulation for the growth o f Geo.9 gSio.02 by the traveling solvent method under axial rotation has been modeled. The model is shown in Figure 2.2. The system is described by a fixed cylindrical coordinate

system ( r ,0 ,z ) that has its origin at the center base o f the model. L is the length o f the ampoule, Douter is the outer diameter o f the quartz tube and Di,,,,er is the diameter o f the sample within the quartz. Gravity is acting downward but can be adjusted to simulate crucible tilt by giving a value to y, and Q is the angular velocity o f the ampoule about the z-axis, where it is zero for no rotation. The source (feed rod) is solid, the solvent (melt, solution zone) is liquid and the substrate (crystal) is solid.

The dissolution interface is the interface which is dissolving and allowing the dopant to segregate through the solvent and the growth interface is the interface which is solidifying, forming the new highly pure crystal. Uh is the speed at which the heater moves up along the side o f the sample in the z-direction. Experimentally, this speed has been shown to be in the vicinity o f about 4mm/day. The heater zone here is described by a temperature heater thermal profile defined by Th( r, 6, z, t ). This

profile is kept stationary for this simulation as quasi steady state condition is assumed due to the slow heater translational speed. The ampoule pulling speed is set to be the steady melting and growth rates, where this assumption is viable and can reduce computational power [22]. Further simplification is in the assumption that the crystal size and thermal environment are unchanged throughout the simulation. Also, the thermal boundary conditions on the ampoule wall are fixed and remain unchanged during the growth process. This model incorporates all the governing equations o f energy transfer, mass transport, momentum and continuity where the use o f the commercial computational code FBDAP has been used as the solver. FIDAP is a well known finite element software for the simulation o f crystal growth and provides sufficient capabilities for accurate simulations o f fluid flow and heat transfer for this process [23-24]. It has been used numerous times by researchers for comparing experimental results to numerical results, being in very close agreement to experimentally obtained data [25-26].

2.2 Governing Equations

This mathematical simulation incorporates the three-dimensional steady state Navier-Stokes equations combined with the energy transfer, m ass transport and continuity equations. The equations used are in cylindrical fonu for simplification in dealing with a cylindrical flow. The simulation is carried out in non-dimensional form. Using dimensional analysis helps convergence through out the iterative

process by providing the software with simpler numbers to be used in the m atrices to be solved. Dimensional analysis leaves the system with all the governing equations being dimensionless and optimizes convergence o f the system in the solver. Some dimensionless numbers used are the Reynolds number, Prandtl number and Grashof number. The equations that are non-dimensionalized are shown in 2.2.1-2.2.4.

2.2.1 Navier-Stokes Equations

The commonly used Navier-Stokes equations under non-turbulent conditions fiilly describe the motion o f an incompressible fluid and are used to calculate the rate of flow, pressure and positions o f any free surface. The following are the NavierStokes equations used in this model, where in the r - Component the last 2 terms have been added due to the effect o f rotation on the system. They are the centrifugal and coriolis forces respectively. In the z - Component the last term is the coupling term which incorporates buoyancy and uses the boussinesq approximation. The governing equations used neglect the transient terms as steady state has been assumed.

2.5 M odel Boundary Conditions and Heater Profile

2.5.1 Model Dimensions

The simulated model consists o f a Geo.s5 Sio.15 source rod with a diameter o f 0.8 cm and a length o f 3.6 cm. This rod is located on top o f a Ge0 .9 sSi0.02 solvent having the same diameter and a length o f 1 cm. Both these zones are positioned above a purely germanium substrate used for the crystal mapping area to grow the crystal. The substrate also has the same diameter but with a length o f 1.5cm. Since the silicon has a higher melting temperature than germanium, by having a higher concentration o f silicon in the source the solvent can be kept in a liquid state while softening the dissolution interface without any melting. This allows the silicon from the Si-rich source to diffuse through the solvent and deposition itself along the growth interface. Figure 2.3a shows the three-dimensional geometrical model used in the simulation.

2.5.2 Model Boundary Conditions

The zero velocity boundary condition has been applied to the source, the substrate and to the sides o f the model as well as on the top and the bottom o f the sample as shown in Figure 2.3a. The source and substrate have zero velocity as they are both solid and since this model is simulating crystal growth within an enclosed ampoule, the no slip boundary condition is applied to the outside o f the cylinder by applying zero velocity. This model contains 15 percent silicon in the source, 2

percent in the solvent, and 0 percent in the substrate. For this simulation, a boundary condition o f 15 percent silicon is applied at the dissolution interface and 2 percent at the growth interface. The application o f a concentration value to the growth and dissolution interface is adopted from [27] and the values are obtained from the Si-Ge phase diagram [28] shown in Figure 2.4.

The model uses the latent heat o f the material and the continuity of velocities and temperature to be exchanged along the solid liquid interfaces. This is given by:

This simulation also incorporates the quasi steady state model where the transient effect o f heat, m ass and fluid flow are considered small enough to be negligible. The approximation is justified due to the slow growth rates typical for semiconductor materials as mentioned earlier o f about 4 mm/day. Similar approximations have been made by references [29-32].

is

experimentally at Dalhousie University. The fiimace used is illustrated in Figure 2.5 and the experimentally measured temperature profile is show in Figure 2.3b. This temperature profile was converted to dimensionless units in terms o f length and temperature then applied to the model by using a best fit polynomial curve to map it to the input file. The 6" '' order polynomial curve was found to accurately map this experimentally m easured profile. Two heater profile variations were applied to this model, one having symmetric uniform heating around the sample, and another having an unsymmetrical non-uniform heating. Heater furnaces used for crystal growth

claim to provide a certain heater profile but in reality this profile willTje slightly nonuniform. This non-uniform heater profile therefore simulates the case o f a lagging furnace. Experimentally, a lagging heater profile always exists due to the heater coils or convective flow throughout the air between the ampoule and the furnace. This lag may be so slight that throughout the experiment it goes unnoticed, so it is the intension o f this simulation to simulate a worst case model to observe how cmcible rotation applied to crystal growth may benefit crystal growth and overall improve the grown crystal quality.

2.6 M esh Sensitivity Analysis

In order to save computational time and to ensure accuracy in results, mesh sensitivity analysis was carried out for this model. The source and the substrate modeled have been kept at a constant mesh o f 40 and 30 elements respectively in the axial direction. These zones are kept constant because both o f these regions are solid and a finer mesh is not needed in solid regions for improving numerical accuracy as the temperature gradient is less in those areas. Since the foil Navier Stokes, energy transfer and mass transport equations were solved in the solvent and this area has a high temperature gradient, the mesh sensitivity is focused on the solvent part only. The solvent was varied from 20 to 120 elements in the axial direction in increments o f 20. This was carried out for two models, one containing 40 circumferential Figure 2.6 shows the 12

elements and the other 60 circumferential elements.

different solvent meshes considered. For these 12 meshes, the terrestrial case o f a uniform heater profile with no rotation was used to calculate and compare the Nusselt number. The Nusselt number is used for mesh sensitivity because it is directly

related to the driving force o f the simulation. This driving force is the temperature thermal gradient applied to the system^ The Nusselt numbers calculated for each case are listed in table 1. Analyzing the results listed, it is seen that the deviation o f the Nusselt number starts to decrease at 80 axial elements and almost no change is noticed when reaching 100 and 120 axial elements. From the results listed, 100 axial elements with a circumference of 60 elements was adopted for the numerical model o f the solvent region. The mesh for this numerical model is symmetrical and the same mesh is used for all the conditions considered.

The mesh is constructed of tri-linear, eight node, isometric brick elements having temperature, velocities and pressure as unknowns at each node. The iterations o f the system continue until an error value o f 10"^ is found between two consecutive iterations in the temperature, the velocities and the pressures at each node, then the system is considered to have converged. The solution zone is considered to be

incompressible and a Newtonian Fluid. In addition this model adopts the Boussinesq approximation where variation in fluid density affects only the buoyancy term; and the fluid density is a function o f temperature and silicon concentration.

3.0 Introduction

This chapter presents the results obtained with the uniform heater profile applied to the TSM m odel under different rotational speeds. The uniform heater profile that was applied is shown in figure 3.1. This chapter is broken down into two sections; the first section discusses the results obtained in the terrestrial condition and the second, the results obtained in the microgravity condition.

3.1 Terrestrial Condition

The terrestrial condition simulates the effect o f gravity on earth where g = go = 9.81 m/s^. In this terrestrial condition the speeds o f 0, 2, 5 and 7 rpm were applied to the TSM crystal growth system. The results o f the axial velocity contours are shown in Figures 3.2 --3.5. In these figures, a three-dimensional model is displayed accompanied by two planes cut horizontally and vertically showing the axial velocity contours, two surface graphs displaying the three-dimensional axial velocity variation and an axial velocity variation plot. The horizontal plane is cut 0.25 cm below the dissolution interface where the convective current is relatively unsteady due to the silicon diffusion from the dissolution interface and the vertically cut plane is cut along the r-z plane with unsymmetrical heating. The surface graphs plot the axial velocity at the horizontally cut plane and at 0.03 cm above the growth interface where the velocity variation plot is also graphed.

In examining the results o f the speed contours, it can be seen that in Figure 3.2 at 0 rpm, the horizontally cut plane has a slight dissymmetry near the center. This dissymmetry is the result o f the three-dimensional characteristic flow within the solution. The horizontal view shows that just below the dissolution interface the two highest velocities occur at the center and close to the wall, here there is an axial velocity o f -0.202 cm/s at the center where it is negative because the flow is moving dovrawards and 0.143 cm/s close to the wall, where it is positive because the flow is m oving upwards. Just below the horizontal view, the three-dimensional velocity

variation and the vertically cut plane o f the solvent can be observed. In the vertical plane it can be seen that three flow cells have been formed. The velocity contours here appear to have a slight dip in the upper portion o f the middle contour cell. This dip demonstrates that the velocity has a sudden drop in this region giving a slight unsteadiness to the solvents flow. Similar to this dip, a slight upward groove appears in the lower portion o f the center flow cell but it is not shown to be quite as strong. N either o f these velocity drops is desirable for the crystal growth process. H ere the maximum velocity also occurs at the center and the sides at -0.458 cm/s and 0.315 cm/s respectively. Below the vertical view o f Figure 3.2, the surface graphs show the three-dimensional velocity variation and below the velocity across the solvent at 0.03 cm above the growth interface is graphed. A noticeable variation in axial velocity

can be observed ranging from 0.037 cm/s to -0.06 cm/s, where for good crystal growth quality a minimal amount o f velocity variation is desired along this interface.

In Figure 3.3 where a rotational speed o f 2 rpm has been applied, looking at the horizontal view , it is observed that the axial velocity at the center and along the sides have slightly decreased from -0.202 cm/s and 0.143 cm/s to -0.199 cm/s and 0.131 cm/s respectively. Here there is a 0.003 cm/s decrease at the center and a 0.012 cm/s decrease along the sides. Moving down to the vertical view it is seen that the dip that had formed in the previous case with 0 rpm has lessened m eaning that this region has become less unsteady and the groove that w as observed at the bottom o f the center flow cell has completely disappeared. In comparing the maximum

velocities in the center and at the sides it can be observed that the center velocity has decreased 0.009 cm/s and at the sides by 0.018 cm/s. This decrease in flow velocity means that the application o f crucible rotation has weakened the convective flow in the system. The graph at the bottom right o f Figure 3.3 also illustrates that the flow velocity at 0.03 cm above the growth interface close to the center has also decreased, being more advantageous for crystal growth.

W ith the application o f 5 rpm (see Figure 3.4) the flow in the horizontal plane has been further suppressed to -0.170 cm/s at the center and to 0.117 cm/s at the sides, having further decreased the velocities from the case o f 2 rpm by 0.029 cm/s and 0.014cm/s. Also it is observed that a new unsteady jagged contour has formed, but this is not a problem as the main concern is to suppress the convective flow and to have steadiness in velocity contours along the growth interface. In the vertical view the dip seen in the previous two cases at the top o f the center flow cell has completely disappeared and the flow has become more axi-symmetric. Here the flow at the center and the sides has been reduced to -0.386 cm/s and 0.262 cm/s respectively. This increase in rpm has lessened the flow velocity by 0.063 cm/s and 0.035 cm/s at the center and the sides from the previous case. In analyzing the

velocity graph at 0.03 cm above the growth interface it can be seen that close to the center o f the inflow the velocity has been reduced to -0.042 cm/s, further improving crystal growth conditions along the growth interface.

A t 7 rpm shown in Figure 3.5, the horizontal plane's velocities at the center and at the sides have been further reduced to -0.142 and 0.108 respectively and also it is observed that this unsteady jagged contour is still present but not as abrupt. The vertical view shows almost no change in shape o f the three velocity contour cells in comparison to that o f Figure 3.4. H ere the m aximum velocity at the center and the sides has been reduced to -- 0.328 cm/s and 0.233 cm/s, having decreased the flow velocity at the center and the sides from the case o f 5 rpm by 0.058 cm/s and 0.029 cm/s respectively. The flow graphed at 0.03 cm above the growth interface close to the center has also decreased to -0.03 cm/s. In comparing this velocity to the case o f 0 rpm, it is observed that the intensity o f the flow along the growth interface has been reduced by 0.173 cm/s w hich is very beneficial for the improvement o f crystal growth quality.

Looking at the graph in Figure 3.6 the maximum speed o f flow is graphed as a function o f rotation from 0 to 7 rpm. In this graph it can be seen that as the

rotational speed is increased the maximum speed in the solvent decreases linearly. This reveals that the application o f rotation is successful in helping suppress the convective flow throughout the solution zone.

The concentration contours throughout the solvent are shown for the rotational speeds o f 0, 2, 5 and 7 rpm in Figures 3.7 - 3.10. These Figures show a three-dimensional model accompanied to the right by two horizontally cut planes one cut mid-way in the solvent at 0.5cm above the growth interface and the other at 0.03 cm above the growth interface, two three-dimensional silicon concentration surface graphs located at 0.5 and 0.03 cm above the growth interface and a vertically cut plane along the center axis in the r-z plane. The horizontally cut planes mid-way in the solvent were chosen to observe how the silicon is behaving along its descent through the solvent and the horizontally cut planes at 0.03 cm above the growth interface were chosen to see how the silicon is depositing itself along the growth interface and the vertical plane was chosen to show how the silicon is behaving through the solvent. In Figure 3.7 at 0 rpm, it can be seen that concentration contours are quite unsymmetrical. This is due to the three-dimensional flow characteristics o f the model. Looking at the horizontal plane cut at 0.5 cm above the growth interface a large jum p in silicon concentration exists from 6.5% in the outer contour ring to 10.4% at the center.

This can be seen in the three-dimensional graph just below where a sharp peak is shown at the center. At the position o f 0.03 cm above the growth interface quite a large variation o f concentration is observed which is undesirable for crystal growth where there is 9.1% silicon at the center and 6.5% towards the sides. The shape o f how the silicon is depositing itself along the growth interface can be seen in the three-dimensional graph shown just above this plane. Looking at the vertical plane, it is observed that the highest concentration of silicon exists along the central axis o f the solvent and closer to the growth interface the silicon concentration lessens. This shows that the silicon is diffusing down through the center o f the solution zone then spreading to the sides as it nears the growth interface. This follows the convective flow direction where the hotter less dense liquid is rising at the sides o f the sample and the cooler more dense liquid is sinking at the center.

Figure 3.8 shows the concentration distribution for the rotational speed o f 2 rpm. Here in the horizontally cut plane at 0.5 cm above the growth interface, a drop down to 7.8% in silicon concentration is observed at the center, which is quite a considerable drop. Also it can be seen that this rotational speed seems to have added some unsymmetrical contours o f silicon towards the sides o f this plane. Looking at the vertical plane, the silicon distribution has become much more symmetrical and the center concentration has dropped to 9.1% silicon from 10.4%. This is due to the decrease o f flow velocity slowing the diffusion o f silicon. The horizontal plane at 0.03 cm above the growth interface has become much smoother where the highest concentration o f silicon is 6.5% and the concentration close to the sides is 3.9%.

With application o f the rotational speed o f 5 rpm (Figure 3.9) more symmetry is added along the sides o f the lower portion in the solvent. The

horizontally cut plane at 0.5 cm above the growth interface has not changed in concentration at the center but the unsymmetrical concentration contours that were seen at 2 rpm have almost disappeared. In the vertical plane this is observed to have added symmetry and it is also seen that one o f the concentration contours has been shortened where it is no longer along the growth interface. The horizontal plane cut at 0.03 cm above the growth interface shows almost no change at all except that the diameter o f the 6.5% contour has lessened slightly.

34

At 7 rpm (Figure 3.10) the concentration results appear to be the same as 5 rpm except for the plane located 0.5 cm above the growth interface where almost perfect symmetry can now be observed.

The silicon concentration distribution at 0.03 cm above the growth interface for the rotational speeds o f 0, 2, 5, 7 and 10 rpm can be seen in Figure 3.11. The additional speed o f 10 rpm has been added in this Figure to show that with any rotational speed higher than 7 rpm results being undesirable for crystal growth begin to occur. Numerically results were calculated for 8, 9 rpm but for clarity only 10 rpm was plotted. W ith the speed o f 0 rpm a convex concentration shape is formed along this plane and as the rotational speed is increased this convex shape flattens out and becomes smoother, until 7 rpm is reached. In the case o f 10 rpm it can be observed how rotational speeds larger than 7 rpm start to form a concave shape which is undesirable for crystal growth. For crystal growth it is desired to have a smooth and as flat as possible concentration distribution along the growth interface, so from this figure it is seen that for the optimum crystal growth o f GeSi in the terrestrial condition, a rotational speed o f 7 rpm is desired.

3.2 Microgravity Condition

The microgravity condition simulates the'effect o f gravity in space w here g = lO'^gb- This is studied due to the fact that the effect o f buoyancy is weak, and can be used to help better understand the flow phenomenon within the crystal's solution zone as this can be considered a pure diffusion model. In the microgravity condition, the rotational speeds of 0, 2 and 5 rpm where applied to the TSM crystal growth configuration. The velocity contours in the axial-direction for these rotational speeds are shown in Figures 3.12 --3.14. These Figures show the three-dimensional model, a horizontally cut plane at 0.25 cm below the dissolution interface, two threedimensional axial velocity surface graphs, a vertical view o f the solvent cut in the r-z plane, and a graph o f the axial velocity at 0.03 cm above the growth interface. The horizontally cut plane and the r-z plane where chosen for the same reasoning mentioned earlier. Figure 3.12 at 0 rpm in the horizontally cut plane shows very little flow on the order o f 10'^ cm/s. The vertical plane shows three velocity contour cells, here a velocity o f -1.62x10'^ cm/s is found at the center o f the m iddle cell and a velocity o f 5.26x10'^ cm/s is found at the center o f the cell located on the right side which is symmetrical to the cell on the left. In the velocity graph below it can be seen that flow at 0.03 cm above the growth interface is almost nonexistent. This can be seen in the three-dimensional graph just above this graph where an almost perfectly flat velocity plane is observed.

The application o f 2 rpm to the sample is shown in Figure 3.13.

In the

horizontally cut plane, the flow shows an increase in velocity with the flow velocity having been reversed at the side and speed contour lines having become fewer. Looking at the vertical plane, it can be noticed that the application o f 2 rpm has created breaking o f the three flow cells seen at 0 rpm into six flow cells w ithin the solvent region. This added rotation has increased the speed throughout the system. The speed at the center o f the lower middle cell is increased to -4.46 xlO ^ cm/s and the speed at the center o f the cell located at the lower right side is increased to 1.89x10"^ cm/s. W ith the formation o f the three new flow cells to the system, the three strong ones have been pushed closer to the growth interface and the three weaker ones have taken form in the top quarter o f the solvent close to the dissolution region. Since the three strong flow cells have been pushed closer to the growth

interface, a slight increase in flow velocity to ± 5x10'^ cm/s is observed in the velocity graph at 0.03cm above the growth interface.

At 5 rpm , shown in Figure 3.14, a much more complex formation o f velocity flow cells are formed in the solvent where there is a total o f seven cells. In the

horizontal plane it can be seen that the flow has become quite abrupt compared to that o f 2 rpm where there is a m uch larger variation in flow from -- 1.09x10"^ cm/s to 1.76x10"* cm/s. The speeds in the vertical plane are further increased to -6.82x10"* cm/s at the center o f the m iddle flow cell and to 6.05x10"* cm/s at the center o f the cell located at the lower right. This vertical plane shows further compression o f the flow cells towards the growth interface which gives rise to the higher axial velocities graphed 0.03 cm above the growth interface. The velocity in the graph varies from 1.5x10"* cm/s to 2.5x10"* cm/s. For crystal growth this is undesirable, as a steady constant velocity preferably close to zero is best for growth quality.

Figure 3.15 shows the maximum speed o f flow as a function o f rotation in the solvent for the cases o f 0, 2 and 5 rpm. The maximum speed o f flow with the application o f crucible rotation increases from 1.68x10"^ cm/s at 0 rpm to 1.89x10'^ cm/s at 5 rpm. It is seen that in the microgravity case, the application o f rotation is not suitable in helping achieve uniform silicon deposition along the growth interface as it does not help in suppressing the flow, but instead increases the speed o f the flow throughout the solution, complicates the flow and also gives unsteady flow conditions along the growth interface.

Figures 3.16 -- 3.18 display the concentration contours obtained from the microgravity cases o f 0, 2 and 5 rpm. Looking at Figure 3.16, it can be seen that with no rotation, smooth and almost perfectly straight concentration contours are formed being evenly spaced throughout the solvent. In Figure 3.17, where a rotational speed o f 2 rpm has been added, a slight dip in the concentration contours appear due to the added velocity and centripetal force to the system. This concentration contour

deformation further increases with the rotational speed o f 5 rpm as shown in Figure 3.18. From the rotational speeds studied in the microgravity condition the most

desirable case for crystal growth is that o f no rotation as this provides the most uniform and flat concentration distribution .along the growth interface. The

concentration distribution located at 0.03 cm above the growth interface is presented in Figure 3.19.Here it can easily be seen that the concentration distribution is the smoothest and most uniform with the application o f 0 rpm and the most disturbed with the rotational speed o f 5 rpm. >

CHAPTER 4 Non-Uniform Heating Condition
4.0 Introduction

This chapter presents the results obtained with the non-uniform heater profile applied to the TSM model under different rotational speeds. The non-uniform

heating condition has been studied due to the fact that in reality there is no such thing as a perfectly uniform heater profile. Every heater profile lags whether it is

noticeable or not. Here it will be observed if rotation can help reduce the effect of heater lag on the growing crystal. The non-uniform heater profile applied was

obtained by adding a polynomial temperature variation in the x and y directions to the temperature profile applied in the uniform heating condition. This allows the temperature to change gradually around the circumference o f the sample. Figure 4.1 shows how the temperature profile was varied around the sample with zero being the original temperature profile unchanged. Figure 4.2 shows the non-uniform

temperature distribution around the model as a result o f the temperature variation. This chapter is broken down into two sections; the first section discusses the results obtained in the terrestrial condition and the second the results obtained in the microgravity condition.

4.1 Terrestrial Condition

In the terrestrial condition, as was done in chapter 3, the rotational speeds of 0, 2, 5, and 7 rpm were applied to the crystal growth model. The results o f the axial velocity contours are shown in Figures 4.3 - 4.6. In these figures, the three-

dimensional model is accompanied by two planes cut horizontally and vertically showing the axial velocity contours, two surface graphs displaying the axial velocity variation and an axial velocity variation plot. The horizontally cut plane is cut 0.25

cm below the dissolution interface where the flow will be relatively unsteady due to the silicon diffusion from the dissolution interface and the vertically cut plane is cut along the r-z plane with unsymmetrical heating. The surface graphs, graph the axial flow at the horizontally cut plane and at 0.03 cm above the growth interface and the velocity variation plot, is at 0.03 cm above the growth interface as well.

Examining the rotational speed o f 0 rpm in Figure 4.3, it can be seen from the three-dimensional view how the non-uniform heating has affected the flow by disrupting the shape o f the flow cells that where present in chapter 3. The horizontal view shows three flow cells which appear to have a line o f symmetry. This line o f symmetry is in agreement with the heater profile applied, see Figure 4.1. In

comparing this horizontal plane to Figure 4.1 there should be a higher velocity along the walls o f higher temperature. This would be where the 2 degree increase occurs where the velocity is 0.454 cm/s. W here there is no increase, a velocity o f 0.249 cm/s is obtained. So the line o f symmetry, when observing figure 4.1, is located

along the x-axis passing through the origin of the z plane. Just as in the uniform heating case a negative velocity has occurred at the center o f the plane indicating that the direction of the flow is downwards at the center. Below the horizontal plane, the plane's axial velocity is depicted in a surface graph, this gives a three-dimensional perspective of how the velocity is varying along this plane. Looking at the vertically cut plane, it can be seen that the symmetry o f the flow cells that was present in chapter 3 has been destroyed. In the left contour cell there is an axial velocity of 0.454 cm/s and in the right contour cell an axial velocity o f 0.249 cm/s, again indicating that highest temperatures are on the left side where the velocity is the greatest. At the center, the flow is directed downwards having a max velocity o f 0.469 cm/s. The axial velocity plot shows a large variation in flow velocity 0.03 cm

above the growth interface ranging from 0.033 cm/s to - 0.087 cm/s. The surface graph above the velocity plot indicates that this plane is quite symmetrical all around with a dip in the center where the velocity is moving downwards.

At 2 rpm (Figure 4.4) observing the horizontal velocity contour plane, it can be seen that this line o f symmetry that existed at 0 rpm has vanished. The left flow cell still has the highest velocity being 0.456 cm/s which has increased by 0.002 cm/s and the right flow cell has a velocity o f 0.257 cm/s having increased 0.08 cm/s. The flow at the center has slowed down to - 0.234 cm/s which has decreased by 0.03 cm/s. Looking at the vertical velocity contour plane the flow cells have kept the same shape. The velocity has increased in both the left and right flow cells to 0.456 cm/s and to 0.257 cm/s, giving an increase o f 0.002 cm/s and 0.008 cm/s respectively. The center flow cell velocity has been lessened to - 0.442 cm/s, having been decreased by 0.027 cm/s. A t the bottom o f Figure 4.4 it can be seen that from the axial velocity plot, the maximum negative velocity has been decreased to 0.066 cm/s, a 0.021 cm/s decrease. This decrease in speed is beneficial for the crystal

growth process which will help the concentration to be more evenly distributed along the growth interface.

W ith the application o f 5 ipm (Figure 4.5) the horizontal contour plane shows that the flow cells have been even further disrupted, with increased dissymmetry. The maximum speed in the left flow cell has decreased to 0.431 cm/s and in the right flow cell to 0.248 cm/s giving a decrease o f 0.025 cm/s and 0.009 cm/s respectively. The speed at the center has been increased to - 0.277 cm/s having an increase o f 0.045 cm/s. Looking at the vertical plane, the flow cells have become more symmetrical and the flow cell at the center has spread its contours out. This explains the increase in velocity in the center flow cell o f the horizontal plane. The velocity in the left flow cell of the vertical plane has decreased to 0.431 cm/s and the velocity in the right flow cell has increased to 0.343 cm/s giving a decrease o f 0.025 cm/s and an increase o f 0.086 cm/s respectively. The increase in velocity in the right cell has improved the symmetry o f flow cells and seems to have started pushing the center flow cell more towards the center o f the system. The maximum negative The

velocity has been decreased to - 0.366 cm/s giving a 0.086 cm/s decrease.

maximum positive velocity o f 0.0264 cm/s and a maximum negative velocity of -- 0.0415 cm/s. This decrease in velocity variation further assists in production o f a more uniform crystal.

At 7 rpm shown in Figure 4.6, the horizontal plane shows no change in shape o f the flow cells; the only change shown is some o f the contours have stretched to cover a larger area. The velocity in the left flow cell o f the horizontal plane has decreased to 0.411 cm/s and has increased in the right flow cell to 0.253 cm/s giving a decrease o f 0.02 cm/s and an increase of 0.005 cm/s respectively. The center flow cell has increased its velocity to - 0.301 cm/s, having a 0.034 cm/s increase. The vertical plane has become almost symmetric where the left flow cell has decreased to a velocity o f 0.411 cm/s and the right flow cell has decreased to 0.332 cm/s giving a change o f 0.02 cm/s and 0.011 cm/s respectively. The center flow cell has also

lowered its velocity to - 0.301 cm/s giving a 0.064 cm/s decrease. A t 0.03 cm above the inflow, the m aximum positive and negative velocities have becom e 0.0284 cm/s and - 0.0254 cm/s. The maximum positive velocity has slightly increased by 0.002 cm/s and the m aximum negative velocity has decreased by 0.0161 cm/s. This change in velocity has even further reduced the magnitude o f velocity variation being best for crystal growth out o f the rotational speeds observed.

Looking at the graph in Figure 4.7, the maximum speed o f flow is graphed as a function o f the rotational speeds ranging from 0 -7 rpm. Some unsteadiness can be seen ranging from 0 rpm to 3 rpm where the speed is decreasing non-linearly. From 3 rpm to 7 rpm the maximum speed starts to decrease linearly, indicating that the rotation seems to have gained control over the unsteady speed throughout the system. As mentioned in chapter 3, since the maximum speed is decreasing with increasing rotational speed, the application o f rotation is successful in helping suppress the convective flow within the system.

The concentration contours throughout the solvent are shown for the rotational speeds o f 0, 2, 5, and 7 ipm in Figures 4.8 - 4 .1 1 . These Figures include a three-dimensional model accompanied by two horizontally cut planes, one vertically cut plane and tw o horizontal three-dimensional surface plots. The horizontally cut planes are located mid-way in the solvent at 0.5 cm above the growth interface and at 0.03 cm above the growth interface. The vertically cut plane o f the solvent is cut along the plane o f unsymmetrical heating and the two surface plots are the same two planes o f the horizontal cut depicting a three-dimensional view o f the concentration distribution.

In Figure 4.8 with 0 rpm being applied, it can be seen that from the threedimensional model that the concentration distribution has been disrupted significantly due to the non-uniform heating- Looking at the mid-way horizontally cut plane, it is seen that the nice uniformity observed earlier in the uniform heating case is no longer present, but a line o f symmetry does exist similar to that which was mentioned in the velocity distribution o f the non-uniform heating at 0 rpm. Here the concentration varies between 7.9% and 5.3%. Below, the surface graph depicts the uneven

distribution o f the silicon in this plane. Looking at the vertically cut plane, it is seen that the silicon diffusion that was occurring at the center in the uniform heating case has now been pushed over to the right and no symmetry can be seen. Again the silicon concentration lessens as it reaches the bottom o f the solvent. This indicates that the silicon is diffusing downwards. The horizontally cut plane at 0.03 cm above the growth interface shows a silicon variation o f 6.6% at the center to 4% at the sides. It can also be seen that the inner most concentration contour is unsymmetrical.

At 2 rpm shown in Figure 4.9, the three-dimensional model contours have changed shape but are still very disturbed. In analyzing the mid-way horizontally cut plane, it is observed that all symmetry that was present at 0 rpm has been destroyed and the silicon concentration variation has changed to 9.2% - 6.6%. The vertically cut plane shows that a larger amount o f silicon has begun to diffuse down towards the growth interface. This increase in concentration is shown to take effect in the

horizontal plane at 0.03 cm above the growth interface where the iimer most contour that was present before has spread out, increasing the concentration towards the side o f the growth interface. It can also be observed that this contour has now become symmetrical which is what is required for better crystal growth conditions.

Figure 4.10 shows the concentration distribution for 5 rpm. The mid-way horizontally cut plane has become less disturbed with the same silicon concentration variation to that o f the 2 rpm case. Looking at the vertically cut plane, it can be seen that where the largest concentration o f silicon is diffusing from the top, it has shifted towards the center and that the concentration reaching the bottom o f the solvent has further increased to 9.2%. The horizontally cut plane at the bottom has introduced a new contour line with an increased concentration of 7.9%. This new contour is not quite symmetrical which is undesirable for the growth o f the crystal.

At 7 rpm shown in Figure 4.11, the mid-way horizontal plane has become even steadier in terms o f the silicon distribution to that o f 5 rpm and the silicon concentrations rem ain the same as that o f the 2 and 5 rpm contours. Looking at the vertically cut plane it can be seen that where this largest concentration o f silicon is diffusing downwards, it has been positioned almost perfectly in the center and the contour distribution has become more symmetrical. The horizontal plane just above the growth interface shows the same contours to that of the 5 rpm case but with middle contour being less symmetric to that at 5 rpm.

The silicon concentration distribution at 0.03 cm above the growth interface for the rotational speeds o f 0, 2, 5, 7 and 10 rpm can be seen in Figure 4.12. This graph is plotted along the radial line o f unsymmetrical heating as was done with the axial velocity previously. W ith the speed o f 0 rpm, a concave shape is observed as well as no symmetry being present. A t 2 rpm, concentration distribution keeps the same shape but is increased. Moving to 5 and 7 rpm, the concentration is further increased and the distribution has become flat and symmetric which is ideal for crystal growth. Out o f the 5 and 7 rpm cases, the 5 rpm condition is more desirable as it is at a higher concentration while also having its uniformity slightly more stretched out along the growth interface than that o f 7 rpm. The rotational speed of 10 rpm has been plotted just as in chapter 3 to show how any larger rotational speed produces undesirable results. Here it can be seen that at 10 rpm the concentration distribution is lowered, taking a concave shape and has become unsymmetrical, all o f which are undesirable for crystal growth.

4.2 Microgravity Condition

The microgravity condition is studied with the non-uniform heating condition to better understand the flow phenomenon within the solution zone as was done in chapter 3 where this can be considered a pure diffusion experiment where g -- lO'^goIn the microgravity condition the rotational speeds o f 0, 2 and 5 rpm have been applied to the non-uniform heating crystal growth model. The axial-direction

velocity contours for these rotational speeds are shown in Figures 4.13 --4.15. The figures show a three-dimensional model, a horizontally cut plane 0.25 cm below the dissolution interface, a vertically cut plane along the plane o f unsymmetrical heating, an axial velocity variation plot at 0.03 cm above the growth interface and two horizontal surface graphs showing the three-dimensional axial velocity variation at 0.25 cm below the dissolution interface and at 0.03 cm above the growth interface.

At 0 rpm shown in Figure 4.13, th " three-dimensional model shows that vertically an unsymmetrical flow has resulted in the system. In the horizontally cut plane, it can be seen that three flow cells have formed and a line symmetry exists. In this plane there is very little flow on the order o f 10'^ cm/s. Below the horizontal plane the three-dimensional velocity graph shows this velocity variation. The

v'ertically cut plane shows the tlnee flows just as in the uniform heating case but now these flow cells have become unsymmetrical. At the center o f the middle flow cell there is a velocity o f - 1.6x10"^ cm/s and at the center of the left and right flow cells velocities o f 1.3x10"^ cm/s and 6.4x10'^ cm/s respectively. Looking at the velocity variation plot and the three-dimensional horizontal surface graph, it is observed that the flow at 0.03 cm above the growth interface is just as in chapter 3 almost nonexistent.

Figure 4.14 shows the application o f 2 rpm to the sample. In the horizontal view, this line o f symmetry that was present has now been lost and the velocity has

In th e v e rtic a l p la n e , th e re is a f o rm a tio n o f

four flow cells where the three that were present at 0 rpm have been compressed towards the growth interface and a new one has formed above them. The velocity at the center o f the middle flow cell has increased to --4.3x10"^ cm/s and the velocities at the center o f the left and right flow cells have increased to 2.2x10"^ cm/s and

1.5x10'^ cm/s respectively. The velocity in the newly formed flow cell above the others is much less being 7.9x10'^ cm/s. Looking at the velocity variation plot and the three-dimensional horizontal surface graph at 0.03 cm above the growth interface, the velocity has increased throughout this plane to ± 5x10'^ cm/s. This increase in velocity is due to the fact the three flow cells observed at 0 rpm have been pushed closer to the growth interface.

At 5 rpm shown in Figure 4.15, the same complex formation o f flow cells has occurred that where present with the uniform heating condition in chapter 3. In the horizontal plane, it can be seen that the flow contours have been more evenly distributed and two small abrupt contour regions have formed. The flow at the center has decreased from 7.8x10'^ cm/s in the 2 rpm case to 4.4x10'^ cm/s and the velocity in the abrupt regions is 1.9x10"^ cm/s. This decrease in velocity in the center can be seen in the three-dimensional surface graph. Looking at the horizontal plane, the exact same pattern o f contour cells has formed to that o f the uniform heating condition. In examining the flow velocities, it is observed that all the contours are very close to that o f the uniform heating condition indicating that in the microgravity condition the application o f 5 rpm takes control over the flow in the system. The velocity variation plot here also varies in the same m agnitude as in chapter 3 from 1.5x10"^ to 2.5x10'^ and the same undesirable shape o f velocity distribution is shown in the three-dimensional surface graph at 0.03 cm above the growth interface.

Figure 4.16 shows the maximum speed o f flow graphed as a function o f the rotational speeds o f 0, 2 and 5 rpm. The maximum speed o f flow increases from 1.72x10"^ cm/s at 0 rpm to 1.79x10'^ cm/s at 5 rpm. This again shows that just as in chapter 3 the application o f crucible rotation does not help in suppressing the flow in the m icrogravity condition, but increases the speed o f the flow throughout the system, and gives complex unsteady flow conditions along the growth interface.

Figures 4.17 - 4.19 display the concentration contours obtained from the rotational speeds o f 0, 2 and 5 rpm. The application o f 0 rpm is shown in Figure 4.17. Here it can be seen that with no rotation there is almost perfectly smooth

concentration contours and that the non-uniform heating has slightly raised these contours on the left side. At 2 rpm Figure 4.18 ju st as in the uniform heating

condition, a slight dip has been added to the silicon concentration contours in the system due to the increased velocity o f flow and the added centripetal force. This

dip is further increased with the application o f 5 rpm shown in Figure 4.19. From the rotational speeds shown, rotational speed o f 0 rpm is the most desired as it provides the most uniform and flat concentration along the growth interface as is observed in Figure 4.20 where the concentration at 0.03 cm above the growth interface has been plotted for the three rotational speeds.

CHAPTERS Conclusion
A study o f buoyancy driven convection in the Geo.9 gSio.02 solution has been conducted in order to study the effect of added crucible rotation on the crystal groAvth o f Gci.xSix by the traveling solvent method. This has been carried out by developing a three-dimensional thermal-solutal model, which accounts for the influence o f both the thermal and solutal convections in the heat and mass transfer o f the system. The three-dimensional model incorporates the use o f the quasi-steady state condition of temperature, concentration and convective flow fields throughout the system. In

addition, mesh sensitivity analysis has been carried out to ensure accuracy in results while saving computational time.

The application o f crucible rotation has been applied to two cases, the uniform heating condition and the non-uniform heating condition. In each o f the cases, both the terrestrial and the microgravity condition have been analyzed. In the terrestrial condition, the rotational speeds o f 0, 2, 5 and 7 rpm have been applied and in the microgravity condition, the rotational speeds of 0, 2 and 5 rpm have been applied. With uniform heating under the terrestrial condition, it was found that

crucible rotation was successful in suppressing the buoyancy induced flow throughout the system and provided a much flatter, smoother and more uniform silicon concentration along the growth interface. It was also noticed that the

rotational effect minimized the three-dimensional flow characteristics throughout the solution zone. For this condition an optimal speed o f 7 rpm was found to be the most suitable for crystal growth; any rotational speed higher than this lead to a concave silicon concentration distribution along the growth interface being undesirable for crystal growth.

In the case o f non-uniform heating under terrestrial conditions, it was observed that cmcible rotation was again successful in suppressing the buoyancy nduced flow throughout the system giving a more uniform velocity distribution across the. growth interface. The rotation in this case did not add much symmetry to the flow as it did in the uniform heating condition. The rotation o f the system

increased the smoothness and uniformity o f the silicon concentration along the growth interface up until 7 rpm where any higher rotational speeds lead to nonuniform silicon distribution along the growth interface. For this condition, the

rotational speeds o f 5 and 7 rpm were considered the best for crystal growth. Out o f the two, the optimal speed o f 5 rpm was chosen as it provided a higher concentration along the growth interface while having a slightly wider uniform concentration distribution to that o f 7 rpm along the growth interface.

The microgravity condition in both cases showed that with increasing rotational speeds, more complex flows were formed resulting in a very complex flow along the growth interface as well as increasing the non-uniformity o f silicon distribution, neither being desirable for crystal growth. An interesting result was

observed in the 5 rpm case where the non-uniform heating condition flow matched that o f the uniform heating condition. This result is thought to be due to the fact that the effect of rotation overcame the force o f unsteady flow caused by non-uniform heating in the system, thereby giving the same result to that o f the uniform heating condition. From these results it is highly recommended not to add rotation to the system in microgravity even i f non-uniform heating is present.

Ultimately for crystal growth, the most desired condition is to have a solvent region which consists o f pure diffusion. velocity. This is accomplished by having zero

To obtain zero velocity, the convective flow due to buoyancy must be

eliminated; the best way o f achieving this is to apply the microgravity condition where the growth process would have to occur in space. It is also required to have a flat smooth and uniform silicon concentration distribution along the growth interface. This will allow for a much larger crystal to be gro,, n with less stress being applied to the crystal lattice.

In conclusion, under terrestrial conditions, the application o f rotation to the crystal growth system will improve the grown crystal quality but under microgravity conditions, the crystal growth process is best left undisturbed with no rotation added. The results o f this numerical simulation will be helpful in future experimental studies where rotation will be applied for crystal growth.

For flirther study, it would be interesting to see the effect crucible rotation would have on the model i f the system underwent crucible misalignment where gravity would no longer be acting directly downwards, but at a slight angle. Also it would be interesting to observe the effect of rotation w ith crucible misalignment being combined to that o f the non-uniform heating condition.
