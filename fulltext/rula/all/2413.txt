A Comparative Analysis of MEMS Parallel Plate Actuators  Master of Engineering, 2011  Boris Shapiro  Mechanical Engineering  Ryerson University 

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to compare the deformation of the moving top plate of five  distinct parallel plate capacitor designs under applied voltage as well as compare the pullin voltage  of each design. The parallel plate designs are created using AutoCAD 2008 software and the  simulations are performed using CoventorWare 2010. The control design is first validated with  known results and then compared to the remaining four designs. Finally, pullin voltages of all five  designs is determined and compared to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each  design.

1.1 Introduction
Variable parallel plate capacitors are widely used in various applications, such as Radio Frequency MEMS (RF MEMS). These MEMS devices can be microrelays[1], micromirrors[2], micro actuators[3], microswitches[4], micro position sensors[5], voltage controlled oscillators[6], resonators[7] and even pixels in display systems[8].

These capacitors consist of a single moving plate and a fixed plate (usually to the substrate). When voltage is applied to the capacitor the free plate is attracted to the fixed plate. If a high enough voltage is applied, the plates touch and the device is short circuited. The threshold distance apart after which the free plate cannot avoid touching the fixed plate is called the pull-in distance, and the voltage threshold is called the pull-in voltage.

In order to prevent the two plates from touching, designers must be aware of this pull-in distance and voltage and estimate them using two simple equations (which are expanded upon in the literature review and theory chapters). These two equations, however, ignore any deformation the moving plate may experience when voltage is applied. This report uses the work by Zhang and Fang[9] as a benchmark and compares five distinct parallel plate capacitors to determine the generality of their modified formulation for the pull-in voltage calculation.

This report also compares the deformations of the moving plate as well as the applied voltages of these five designs. Lastly, this report seeks to determine the generality of the

1

formulation by Zhang and Fang[9] and to determine any advantages or disadvantages of various parallel plate designs.

Chapter 2
2.1 Literature Review
2.1.1 Types of Parallel Plate Actuators/Capacitors As mentioned before, variable plate capacitors are used in a myriad of applications. Digital micromirror devices, or DMDs, are used in digital light processing (DLP) projection technology invented by Texas Instruments in 1987[10]. The DMD is an array of micro square mirrors. Each of these mirrors can be turned on and off thousands of time a second. Each mirror represents a pixel in the projected image[10]. This allows for a brighter, sharper and more realistic images than using alternative technologies.

MEMS display technology is not limited to micrometers. Mirasol[8] has designed the MEMS Drive IMOD Reflective technology screen. This screen consists of millions of pixels, where each pixel is a parallel plate actuator with one moving plate (thin film) and one fixed plate. When voltage is applied, the moving film can achieve one of three states. When light hits a pixel and voltage is not applied, red, green or blue is reflected. When voltage is applied, the moving plate is moved towards the fixed plate and the pixel is then turned black[8]. By using ambient light and very small voltages, Mirasol was able to create displays that use very little power, in fact, Mirasol claims that when displaying static images their display has near zero power usage[8].

2.1.2 An Alternate Approach to Calculating Pull-In Voltage

Traditionally when it comes to parallel plate capacitors (or actuators) estimating the pullin distance and voltage is relatively simple. The pull-in distance, dpull-in[14], is estimated to be one third of the initial gap, d0 between the two plates:

dpull-in = where d0 is the initial gap between the two plates. The pull-in voltage, by

(2.1) [14], is estimated

(2.2) Where A is the overlapping area of the two plates, is the relative permittivity, is the

permittivity in vacuum and k is the stiffness of the support beams.

Zhang and Fang[9], however, argue that since the moving plate bends when voltage is applied, these estimates are not entirely accurate. They describe the top plate as having three sections (See Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) as opposed to the uniform change in displacement of the ideal model (Fig. 3), where under each section there is a variance in capacitance induced by the deformation of the top plate.

Figure 1. Parallel Plate Model With Translation and Deformation [9]

Figure 2. Simplified Model of the Parallel Plate Capacitor [9]

Figure 3. Traditional Model of the Parallel Plate Capacitor [9]

In their paper, Zhang and Fang[9] provide a formulation to compensate for the deformation of the top plate in order to obtain a more accurate pull-in voltage estimate. Their formulation is based on their own design of a parallel plate capacitor (and other similar designs), namely having the support beams on opposite edges (Fig. 4). This raises the question of just how generally applicable the formulation is and how the design of the capacitor affects the top plate deformation.

Chapter 3
3.1 Theory
3.1.1 Traditional Pull-In Analysis[14] Consider the parallel plate actuator described in Fig. 3. The capacitance is expressed (3.1) where is the relative permittivity, is vacuum permittivity, A is the overlapping area of the , is expressed with

two plates and

is the initial gap. The total electric energy stored,

(3.2) where is the voltage applied squared. If there is a change in displacement, Eqn. (3.2) becomes (3.3)

where d is the gap after applied voltage. According to the principle of virtual work[13], the electrostatic force, | |, is equal to the gradient of stored energy with respect to the position (or displacement) of the moveable electrode (top moving plate). Thus

| Combining Eqns. (3.3) and (3.4), the electrostatic force acting on the moving plate is

(3.4)

(3.5) The spring force, expressed as , is acting in the opposite direction of . This spring force is linear and is

where

is the equivalent stiffness of the support beams. For the system to be in equilibrium, . Thus combining (3.5) and (3.6) it is possible to isolate V as

(3.7) To determine the pull-in distance (maximum displacement) and voltage, the first derivative of Eqn. (3.7) with respect to d yields

(3.8) Thus, Eqn. (9) shows that the pull-in distance is one third of the initial gap. Using eqn. (3.8) in Eqn. (3.7) it is straight forward to show that the pull-in voltage is

(3.9)

3.1.2 The Method of Zhang and Fang[9] Zhang and Fang[9] attempt to take into account the deformation of the moving plate. As such, they represent the capacitance of the system, C, in terms of the sum of the centre capacitance, C2, and the two border capacitances, C3, (Fig. 2). Thus

(3.10) To calculate C3 (Fig. 5), first suppose that the sloping length is , the sloping section and the horizontal section intersect at O and the angle between the two parts is . C3 can be divided into many ideal narrow sections. The capacitance of each section is defined as (3.11)

7

where b is the width of the plate. Therefore, the capacitance C3 is (3.12) where (3.13) Thus (3.14) When   0, x  


  

(3.15)

Equation (3.15) is the result of the nominal parallel plate capacitor. If  is very small, suppose


(3.16)

Then (3.17) The capacitance C2 can be expressed as


(3.18)

Since pull-in occurs at

, y can be expressed as   (3.19)

That is (3.20) Then the capacitance of the system can then be expressed as (3.21)

8

With this new expression for capacitance, the pull-in voltage can now be determined using Eqns. (3.1) to (3.9).

3.2 Manufacturing Process
Zhang and Fang[9] do not mention the manufacturing process of their actuator; they merely describe it as a "simple surface micromachining" and proceed to describe the steps taken to fabricate their capacitor. The material used in their design is nickel. Hence it can be speculated that the manufacturing process is MetalMUMPS: a process under the Multi User MEMS Process umbrella.

A different manufacturing process is used for this project. This process also falls under the MUMPS category, however instead of using Nickel the material of choice is Polysilicon. As such the name of this process is called PolyMUMPs. The familiarity of the author with PolyMUMPs influenced this decision. Additionally, since Zhang and Fang[9] indicate that their formulation is generalized, the actual manufacturing process and the materials used in fabrication should not affect its validity.

PolyMUMPs is a relatively simple process which consists of three layers. The process begins with a 150 mm silicon wafer, typically of 1-2  resistivity[11]. The wafer is heavily 9

doped with phosphorus in a diffusion furnace using a phosphosilicate glass (PSG) sacrificial layer. This reduces (or prevents) the charge feeding through to the substrate from the devices on the surface. Then, after the removal of the PSG film, a silicon nitride layer is deposited as an insulation layer. This layer is 600 nm (0.6 µm) thick and deposited using a process called Low Pressure Chemical Vapour Deposition (LPCVD). Following that, the first polysilicon layer (Poly0) is deposited on top of the nitride layer. This polysilicon layer is 500 nm (0.5 µm) thick and is deposited using LPCVD. Poly0 is then patterned using photolithography (Fig. 6, 7 and 8). Photolithography is a process which involves the coating of the wafer with a photoresist material. The wafer is then covered with the appropriate mask (the design appropriate to the layer) and is exposed to UV light. After exposure, the poly0 layer is etched using a plasma etch system.

Figure 6. Nitride, Poly0 and Photoresist layers deposited on the Silicon wafer substrate [11]

10

Figure 7. The Photoresist Layer patterned using Photolithography [11]

Figure 8. The exposed Poly0 sections are etched away and the Photoresist chemically peeled [11] Following the etch of poly0, a 2.0 µm PSG sacrificial layer is deposited and annealed. This layer is known as first Oxide and it is removed at the end of the manufacturing process in order to free the first mechanical layer of polysilicon. This layer is lithographically patterned with dimples and etched using a Reactive Ion Etch (RIE) system. These dimples are generally 0.75 µm deep and are used to prevent sticking caused by the pull-in effect. After the dimples are etched the third mask layer, called Anchor1, is RIE etched into the PSG sacrificial layer. This provides anchor points for the Poly1 layer (Fig. 9).

11

Figure 9. First Oxide Layer, etched dimples and Anchor points [11] After Anchor1 is etched, the first structural layer of polysilicon (called Poly1) is deposited with thickness of 2.0 µm. A 0.2 µm layer of PSG is then deposited on poly1 and annealed. This dopes poly1 with phosphorus from the PSG layer on both sides, significantly reducing the net stress in Poly1 (Fig. 10).

Figure 10. Poly1 and PSG mask are deposited [11] PolyMUMPs machined MEMS devices can have a second structural layer of polysilicon (Poly2, 1.5 µm thick) as well as a metal top layer (0.5 µm). The metal layer provides for proving, bonding electrical routing and highly reflective mirror surfaces. However, the designs used in

12

this report do not use Poly2 or metal layers so the process and related steps ­ such as Anchor2 ­ are ignored.

At this point, the sacrificial layers are etched and Poly1 is supported entirely on its own (Fig. 11). In order to etch the sacrificial layer from under Poly1, holes are added (labelled Hole0 for poly1 and Hole1 for Poly2. Please note that Hole0 and Hole1 can only be seen from bird's eye view and as such are not mentioned in Figures 6 through 11. Hole0, however, is visible in Figures 12 through 16). These holes have no set size rules and are designed based on the engineer experience of the engineer; however there is a maximum distance between holes of 30 µm. Anything larger than that will result in the PSG layer under Poly1 to not be removed in its entirety. This 30 µm limit is due to limitations in the RIE process.

3.3 The Designs
Zhang and Fang's[9] design used two support beams on either side of the moving plate. This design played a part in their formulation. However, not all parallel plate actuators are designed in this manner and as such four additional designs are considered in this comparative 13

analysis. Zhang and Fang[9] provided some measurements of their device. It is known that the overlap area was 700 µm by 700 µm and that the air gap was 3 µm. Thus, all five designs used have an overlap area of 700 µm by 700 and the air gap, however, is only 2 µm as per PolyMUMPs design rules. The other dimensions in the design had to be estimated. As such, the connector pads were estimated to be 135 µm by 135 µm. The length of each support beam was estimated to be 248 µm and its width to be 68 µm. Since Zhang and Fang's design did not use MUMPs rule, Hole0 dimensions are adjusted to comply with MUMPs rules. For Designs 1, 2, 3 and 5 the holes are 25.83 µm by 25.83 µm.

Design 1 (Fig. 12) is identical to that of Zhang and Fang[9] with the exception of modifying the holes to conform with PolyMUMPs design rules. Design 2 (Fig. 13) and 3 (Fig. 14) contain slight modifications to Zhang and Fang's design. In Design 2 there are still four support beams, however they are connected at the halfway point of each side of the top plate: one beam per side. Design 2 again features a different location for the support beam. In this design, the support beams are located at the corners of the top plate and just like in Design 2, each corner has one support beam. In Designs 2 and 3 all dimensions are identical to Design 1.

Figure 14. Design 3: a modified version of Design 1 with displaced support beams Design 4 (Fig. 15) is not a simple square 700 µm by 700 µm actuator. As seen in Figure 15, it is of hexagonal shape with 3 support beams. To maintain consistency, the overlap area is remained as 700 µm by 700 µm, however the dimensions are modified slightly. Each edge of the hexagon is 434.3 µm. The support beams are 551.5 µm in length. The connector pads remain at 135 µm by 135 µm. The holes are 25.56 µm by 25.56 µm.

16

Figure 15. Design 4: Hexagonal plates and only 3 support beams Design 5 (Fig. 16) is a combination of design 1 through 3 and 4 in the sense that it has a square top plate; however, the support beams are similar to that of design 4 in the sense that they form a 90 degree angle to each side of the plate and run parallel to the plate as opposed to perpendicular (or in the case of design 3, at a 45 degree angle). For Design 4, the length of the support beams is 620 µm. The connector pads and holes have the same dimensions as Designs 1 through 4.

3.4 Elements Used
For the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) two types of elements are used: Manhattan brick and tetrahedral elements. The Manhattan brick mesh option creates orthogonal or nearly orthogonal hexahedral, or brick, elements. The geometry is subdivided at concave intersections of faces and further subdivided using parallel planes or nearly parallel faces. These elements are best suited for orthogonal or near orthogonal geometry. Manhattan bricks can be linear or parabolic. Linear Manhattan bricks have two nodes along each edge, creating an 8-node

18

hexahedra (bricks). Parabolic Manhattan bricks have three nodes along each face, creating a 27 node hexahedra[12]. Tetrahedral elements are used when Manhattan brick meshing is impossible. The element order available is linear and parabolic. Linear tetrahedrons have two nodes along each edge, creating a four node tetrahedron. Parabolic tetrahedron elements have three nodes along each edge, creating a ten node tetrahedral element[12].

Chapter 4
4.1 Analysis
4.1.1 Static Analysis For this section only the bending behaviour of the top plate of each design was examined. To remain consistent, 12.5V was used as the initial load; the same as Zhang and Fang[9] used in their Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of their design. However, instead of using ANSYS, a MEMS specific analyser, CoventorWare, was employed for all portions of the analysis with the exception of creating the 2D models. The models were created using AutoCAD 2008.

4.1.1.1 Design 1 As previously discussed, the first design is by Zhang and Fang[9]. The only exception is that PolyMUMPs process was used. For the mesh, Manhattan Brick elements were used with a size of 20 µm by 20 µm by 1 µm. This creates a relatively coarse mesh, however this was needed in order to reduce computational time during the simulation (Fig. 17).

20

Figure 17. An illustration of the mesh used in Design 1 4.1.1.2 Design 2 Due to the similarities of Design 2 to Design 1, the same parameters are used for meshing (Fig. 18).

Figure 18. An illustration of the mesh used in Design 2 21

4.1.1.3 Design 3 Design 3 could not be meshed using Manhattan Brick elements due to the support beam placement, thus tetrahedral elements of size 20 were selected (Fig. 19). The same conductor boundary condition of 12.5V was used, the same as for Designs 1 and 2.

Figure 19. An illustration of the mesh used in Design 3

22

4.1.1.4 Design 4 Again, due to the unique geometry of this design, Manhattan Brick elements could not be used, and as a result the same parameters as Design 3 were chosen (Fig. 20).

Figure 20. An illustration of the mesh used in Design 4 4.1.1.5 Design 5 The meshing for design 5 returns to Manhattan Bricks of size 20 µm by 20 µm by 1 µm (Fig. 21). Once again, the initial voltage boundary condition was set to 12.5V for consistency.

23

Figure 21. An illustration of the mesh used in Design 5 4.1.2 Static Analysis Results It is immediately apparent that the voltage values used by Zhang and Fang[9] cannot be used for these designs when the manufacturing process is PolyMUMPs and the material is polysilicon; the maximum displacement of the moving plate is between 6.8 µm (Fig. 22) and 99 µm (Fig. 23). However, there is some consistency: Design 1 (Fig. 22) exhibits the same bending profile as shown in the simulations by Zhang and Fang[9] (Fig. 24). This allows Design 1 to be the control in this comparative analysis.

24

Figure 23. Design 5 Static Analysis under 12.5V Load 25

Figure 24. Zhang and Fang's Static Analysis under 12-13V load [9]

Based on the results of Design 1, the deformation shapes of the rest of the designs are expected to follow a similar pattern; greater deformation around the centre is due to the Designs having one support beam on each edge. This appears to hold true to Designs 2 (Fig. 25) and 3 (Fig. 26).

26

Figure 25. Design 2 Under 12.5V Load

Figure 26. Design 3 Under 12.5V Load 27

Designs 4 and 5, however, do not follow this expected behaviour. Both Designs 4 (Fig. 27) and 5 (Fig. 23) have a uniform displacement about their moving plates with what appears to be little to no deformation under applied voltage. This is a very interesting result as it indicates that the placement and design of the support beam affect the way the moving plate deforms.

Figure 27. Design 4 Under 12.5V Load 4.1.3 Pull-In Analysis Using the static analysis it is possible to make a rough estimate for the pull-in voltages for each design. Given that under an applied voltage of 12.5V, the top plates maximum displacement was between 6.8 µm and 99 µm (far greater than the 2 µm air gap), it is safe to 28

assume that the voltage range is no more than 5V. Hence, the voltage range for the pull-in analysis was 1.0V to 5.0V with 0.5V increments. The pull-in tolerance ­ a setting required by the solver ­ is set to 0.1. The pull-in tolerance is used by the solver to determine when to stop the simulation; the simulation ends when the difference between the last convergent or nonconvergent and divergent solutions is less than the pull-in tolerance.

4.1.3.1 Design 1 Results The pull-in voltage for Design 1 predicted using CoventorWare is approximately 2.44V. The simulation neither converged nor diverged at this applied voltage (Fig. 28). CoventorWare treats "not converged" results the same as converged.

Figure 28. Pull-In Simulation Results for Design 1 It is interesting to note that at pull-in voltage the moving plate of the capacitor is not deforming the way it deformed in the static analysis under voltages that exceeded the pull-in effect (Fig. 29). Only the edges where the support beams are attached to the moving plate approached the maximum displacement. At 2.44V, the top plate moved 0.57 µm (maximum displacement), or almost a third of the air gap between the two plates (approximately 0.67 µm), however the centre area of the moving plate displaced approximately 0.42 µm (Fig. 29). 29

Figure 29. Design 1 Deformation at pull-in voltage 4.1.3.2 Design 2 Results For this design, the pull-in voltage was determined to be 3.38V (Fig. 30) with, again, a maximum displacement of 0.57 µm (Fig. 31). For this applied voltage the simulation did converge, unlike Design 1. It is fascinating to note again, that the deformation is not as extreme as expected at the pull-in boundary, however there is slightly more deformation than in design 1. For design 2, only the corner edges of the moving plate deformed, as opposed to the beam placement edges. However, just like with design 1, the centre area of the moving plate does not reach the 1/3rd distance. For 3.38V, the maximum displacement is calculated to be 0.57 µm, same as in Design 1, but the majority of the plate only reaches a displacement of approximately 0.24 µm (Fig. 31).

4.1.3.3 Design 3 Results Unfortunately, the results for Design 3 do not appear to be correct. The top plate is being repelled from the bottom plate as opposed to being attracted. Several voltage ranges were used, however each time the results remained the same (Fig. 32). Hence, Design 3 will be ignored in the overall conclusion.

Figure 32. Design 3 Pull-In Deformation 4.1.3.4 Design 4 Results For this design, the pull-in voltage was determined to be 1.0V (Fig. 33) with a maximum displacement of 0.65 µm (Fig. 34). Interestingly enough, just like the static analysis, the 32

deformation of the top plate is uniform throughout. It is an indication that the design of the plate, the design of the support beams, or the combination of the two affects how the moving plate deforms. In addition, this is the first example of the top plate approaching the estimated pull-in distance of 1/3rd of the gap throughout. Finally, this result shows that by altering the design of the capacitor, greater displacement can be achieved at lower voltages.

4.1.3.5 Design 5 Results For this design the pull-in voltage was determined to be 1.06V (Fig. 35) with a maximum displacement of 0.58 µm (Fig. 36). Just like for design 4, the top plate deformation is uniform throughout, which confirms the importance of the design of the support beams as conjectured in section 4.1.3.4.

5.1 Conclusions
It is evident from Designs 1and 2 and to a lesser extent Design 3, that deformation when voltage is applied can be a serious concern and that pull-in voltage and distance estimates cannot always be as accurate as desired. However, Designs 4 and 5 show that the effect can be ameliorated. For example, Changing the shape and length, not the position, of the support beam provides a more uniform motion of the moving plate and very little deformation, thus allowing for the relatively simplistic approximation to be very effective. This however, adds additional stress onto the support beams and makes the overall structure less stiff.

Designs 4 and 5 offer other advantages as well. Firstly, Designs 4 and 5 generate the same displacement as Designs 1 and 2, but with a significantly smaller applied voltage; an average voltage of 1.03V for Designs 3 and 4 versus 2.91V for Designs 1 and 2. Given the applications involving parallel plate, energy consumption is always an issue.

Secondly, Designs 4 and 5 are relatively more compact than Designs 1, 2 and 3. Design 1 is 1399 µm across. Design 2 is 1466 µm across. Design 3 is 1687.9 µm diagonally. While Design 4 is 1193.07 µm (distance between two furthest points) and design 5 is 1013 µm across. This not only uses less material but speeds up the manufacturing process and allows for more devices to be micro-machined on the same wafer.

Finally, as previously mentioned, Designs 4 and 5 do not require any modification to the pull-in distance and voltage equations. This allows for easy computation of these properties 35

without using any significant amount of computational power which is an ever important resource.

5.2 Future Work
Further work can be done on this topic. Firstly, the 5 designs can be made more consistent with each other; the support beams for Designs 4 and 5 are significantly longer than those of Designs 1, 2 and 3 as well as Design 4 having only three beams. As such the end results of this paper are skewed.

Secondly, stresses can be investigated and the advantages and disadvantages of applying more stress on the support beams as opposed to the moving plate. This investigation may provide insight on long term or heavy use effects of these actuators.
