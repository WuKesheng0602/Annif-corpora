Optimization and Modeling of an Emulsion Polymerization Reactor

Narges Ghadi, 2004 M aster of Applied Science Chemical Engineering Department Ryerson University

Abstract
A mathematical model was developed to simulate emulsion polymerization in batch, semi-batch and continuous reactors for monomers w ith high water solubility and significant desorption such as vinyl acetate. The effects o f operating conditions such as initiator and em ulsifier concentration as w ell as reactor temperature have been studied. The simulation results revealed the sensitivity o f polymer properties and monomer conversion to variation o f these operating conditions. Furthermore, the impact o f monomer soluble im purities on reduction o f monomer conversion has been investigated. In order to control polymer molecular weight, application o f chain transfer agents such as t-nonyl mercaptan was suggested. Generally, the simulation results fitted w ell

experimental data from the literature. Several optim ization policies were considered to enhance the reaction operation fo r better product quality. During continuous polymerization, the reactor demonstrates oscillatory behavior tliroughout the operation. A new reactor train configuration was considered w ith the aim o f damping the oscillations and producing high-quality latex.

Chapter 1 Introduction

1.1 Em ulsion Polym erization
Emulsion polymerization is an important industrial polym erization process for manufacturing water based polymers such as: latex paints, rubbers, coatings and adhesives. Latexes are cuiTently undergoing extensive research and development as key replacement materials fo r many solvent-based systems. Emulsion polymerization is a free radical reaction carried out under heterogeneous conditions and it is m ostly used fo r the synthesis o f wide range latex polymers on a commercial scale. The advantages o f emulsion polymerization include favourable kinetics, safety, environmental and compositional control, high solid level and conversion. The low viscosity o f latexes allows a high rate o f heat transfer during polymerization. Four essential components are required to carry out an emulsion polymerization process: the dispersion medium which is in general water, the monomer which is often slightly soluble in water, the water soluble initiator and an emulsifier. The heterogeneous nature o f the process requires the diffusion o f the monomers from the em ulsified droplets, through the aqueous medium into the polymer particles where the polym erization takes place. Therefore, the monomer should be soluble enough to allow effective diffusion. In fact, very hydrophobic monomers are not suitable for emulsion polymerizations. The water-soluble initiator commonly used is potassium or sodium persulfate. The polymer produced is in the form o f small particles having an average diameter around 5 j.in i. Emulsion polymerization can be done in batch, semi-batch and continuous stirred tanks reactors (CSTR). In commercial batch reactors, it has been found that tliere is an always small variation, from batch to batch in monomer conversion, particle number and size, molecular weight and polymer branching. Operation o f CSTRs fo r emulsion polymerization offers several advantages over batch reactors, the most im portant o f which are high production rate and better polymer quality. CSTRs may eliminate the problem

encoimtered in batch reactors and also produce polymers w ith narrower molecular weight distribution (M W D ). End-use properties o f polymers (fle x ib ility , elasticity...) are related to molecular morphology and particle size, which strongly depend on the reactor type and operating conditions (temperature, monomer or initiator concentration, in itiator type and cooling medium flo w rate). Research on modelling, optimization and control o f the emulsion polymerization reactors has been expanding rapidly due to the increasing demand fo r new and high quality latex products. The objectives are usually to maximize the production rate and to control product properties such as polymer particle size distribution, long chain branching and crosslinking. The success o f optim ization metliods is highly dependent on the availability o f valid dynamic models fo r the chemical changes occuning in this complex polymerization. In case o f optim ization and control, the reactor model should be detailed and precise enough to predict the effect o f tire main process input variables on the output variables, and to represent w ell the relationship between operating conditions, kinetics and fin a l product properties. The model should also remain at a precision level allow ing optim al profile . determination and control law computation. The main purpose o f this thesis is to study the emulsion polym erization mechanism and try to develop a mathematical model, which can describe the process behaviour tliroughout the reaction. The model m ainly considers the behaviour o f highly water soluble monomers by application o f population balance tlieory. A fte r that the m odel should be tested and verified w ith experimental data over different operating conditions in order to show its capability to simulate tire emulsion reaction in batch, semi-batch and continuous reactors. The verified model is tlien used to fin d optimal policies fo r feed and reactor temperature fo r the production o f high quality polymer, w hich in turn is h ig h ly dependent on operating conditions. Based on the objectives, the follow ing part briefly describes the order o f contents o f this thesis.

1.2 O rganization o f Thesis
Chapter 2 o f this study reviews studies done on emulsion polymerization. The review shows how the understanding and modeling o f emulsion polymerization has gradually progressed over the years. Chapter 3 consists o f two sections. The first section deals with understanding the process and the second section describes the steps o f model development for emulsion polymerization processes o f case 1 monomers, which can predict the rate o f change o f reactants through the reaction as well as product properties. The formulated model is then tested to simulate a w ell-m ixed reactor in different modes (batch, semi-batch and continuous), whose results fitted w ell experimental data from the literature (Chapter 4). In polymerization industry, it is very incentive to produce high quality polymers and achieve high monomer conversion. Therefore, in addition to simulation results. Chapter 4 includes optimization policies w ith the aim o f achieving desired product property and high monomer conversion. The end-product properties are related to the structure o f the polymer molecules, which can be described in terms o f molecular weight distribution (M W D ), molecular weight averages ( M n jV I w ) and number o f branching points ( ). Furthermore, new train configurations are presented to keep the

reactor under stable conditions, which is highly desirable in industry to prevent serious implications like runaway during the high portion o f the conversion oscillation. Chapter 5 summarizes the most important concluding remarks and finally Chapter 6 proposes recommendations for future studies.

Chapter 2 Literature Review

In recent years considerable advances have been made in the modeling o f emulsion polymerization reactions. The basic mechanism fo r emulsion polymerization was first postulated by Harkins (1947). Smith and Ewart (1948) were the first group that quantitatively expressed H arkin's postulation in an em pirical form ulation. Models in 1960s and 1970s were more or less extended/modified versions o f the Sm ith-Ew art' s theory. In general, particle nuclÃ©ation phenomena as w e ll as balances fo r particle size distribution (PSD) were not included in emulsion polym erization models developed before 1974. N ow both homogeneous nuclÃ©ation and m icellar nuclÃ©ation mechanisms are considered in most models. Two levels o f models are used to calculate the particle size. Â· The monodispersed approximation method; models the number o f particles and the total particle volume assuming monodispersed particles. Â· Age distribution analysis method: uses moments o f these distribution equations to get the total or average properties. Penlidis et al. (1984) worked on m odeling of the continuous emulsion

polymerization o f vinyl chloride. Their model was able to predict monomer conversion, polymer particle size distribution, m olecular. weight distribution and long and short branching frequencies. New reactor train configurations were also suggested to keep the reactor operation in a stable mode. Another research group, L u and L in (1985), proposed a model fo r absolute particle size distribution in continuous emulsion polym erization o f styrene based on the m odified population balance tlieory. The effect o f em ulsifier and in itiator concentrations as well as mean residence tim e on the product properties were investigated. Later, Penlidis (1986) m odified the previous models based on particle age distribution analysis and simulated dynamic behaviour o f emulsion polym erization reactor

in different modes (batch, semi-batch and continuous) for vin yl acetate and vin yl chloride monomers. Experimental studies were also carried out to demonstrate the improved performance o f the m odified model. Lu and L in (1986) found the best value fo r desorption coefficient by comparing theoretical predictions w ith experimental data. The effect o f radical desorption as w e ll as residence time on the quality o f the product were analyzed. A model predicting the behaviour o f emulsion polym erization reactors on the basis o f population balance equations was formulated by Rawlings and Ray (1988). M odel predictions were compared w ith experimental data o f styrene, methyl methacrylate and

vin yl acetate. They were in good agreement w itl: laboratory data and the model was capable o f predicting other experimentally observed phenomena like sustained oscillations and overshoots during the continuous reactor' s start-up. The effect o f water soluble and monomer soluble impurities on the kinetics o f emulsion polym erization reactor were earned out experim entally by Penlidis et al. (1988). The outcome o f their study revealed that impurities could have an appreciable effect on both polym er particle nuclÃ©ation and growth. In a more recent study, Chiu and Lee (1997) worked on seeded soapless emulsion polymerization. Poly (methyl methacrylate) (P M M A ) was considered as seeds, styrene as monomer and potassium persulfate (KaSiOs) as initiator. They m odified the core-shell model proposed in previous studies to predict the monomer conversion that fitted w ell w ith the experimental data. M eira et al. (1998) investigated a starved emulsion polym erization o f styrene in order to control the molecular weights o f the product. The reactor was operated under a starved feed o f a m ixture o f monomer and chain transfer agent (tertdodecyl and tert-nonyl mercaptans). This method produced a constant m olecular weight distribution along the polymerization. For better interpretation o f effect o f chain transfer agent' s length, a mathematical model was developed. Tw o batch experimental reactors were used to adjust some o f the model parameters. Nomura et al. (2001) conducted emulsion polymerization o f styrene in a CouetteTaylor Vortex flo w reactor (CTVFR). They developed a model by com bining the empirical correlation o f the m ixing characteristics o f a C TVFR and a CSTR. Experimental results revealed that a CTVFR is more suitable to be used as a first reactor in a reactor system fo r continuous emulsion polymerization. Further, Pinto et al. (2001) formulated a mathematical

model to compute dynamic evolution o f m olecular w eight distributions (M W D s) during nonlinear emulsion polymerization reactions. The M W D s were calculated by application o f an adaptive orthogonal collocation technique. The m odel was in agreement w ith

experimental data o f methyl methacrylate/butyl acrylate (B uA ) in semi continuous and o f vin yl acrylate (V A )/veovalO in continuous emulsion polym erization reactors. B oth reaction systems show significant chain transfer reactions to polym er chains due to the presence o f B u A and V A , respectively. The model was able to predict quite properly the kinetics and M W D o f polym er samples during emulsion polymerizations. Recently, Gao and Penlidis (2002) developed a complete computer database package fo r emulsion hom o-/copolynierization under wide range o f reaction and operation conditions (batch, semi-batch, seeded or unseeded, etc.). This comprehensive m odel was able to describe all im portant physicochemical phenomena in em ulsion polym erization both qualitatively and quantitatively. The effects o f particle nuclÃ©ation, absorption and desorption o f radicals, monomer partitioning and gel effect were also investigated. Kiparissides and his coworkers (2002) investigated the influence o f oxygen concentration on the polym erization rate and particle size distribution (PSD). Since the generated radicals due to initiator decomposition are scavenged by dissolved oxygen, a reduction o f polymerization rate was observed as a consequence o f increasing the oxygen concentration in the water phase. M ore recently, a model was reported by D oyle I I I et al. (2003) fo r emulsion polym erization o f styrene under nonisothermal condition. The model was used to control particle size distributions. Sensitivity results suggested that operation o f reactor under semi-batch condition rather than batch mode increases the accuracy o f online measured model pai'ameters. The nonosithermal operation o f the reactor revealed that the reactor temperature could be manipulated to achieve desired fin a l product properties.

Since emulsion hom opolym erization is a very com plex system, m odeling o f emulsion copolymerization is an even more challenging task. Therefore, more m odeling is required fo r a better understanding o f the complicated physicochemical is sim ila r to reaction of a

al. (1985) developed a dynamic model to predict polym er particle properties such as m olecular w eight averages { M n , M w ) and particle size distribution fo r the emulsion copolym erisation o f styrene/butadiene. The model was used to design, optim ize and control emulsion copolym erisation in w ell-m ixed stirred tank reactors operated in batch, semi batch and continuous modes for transient and steady state operations. M ulticom ponent free radical polym erization fo r solution and emulsion systems were carried out by Hamielec et al. (1987). The model was considered to be applicable to several comonomer systems such as; styrene/acrylonitrile, p-methyl styrene/acrylonitri 1 e and styrene/butadiene. Free volume theory used to represent diffusion-controlled term ination and propagation reactions. Beside distinctive study on emulsion hom opolym erization, Penlidis et al. (1996) simulated the emulsion copolym erization o f acrylon itrile/ butadiene (nitrile rubber). The main objective was to predict rates o f production o f polym er and product properties in an industrial setting. The predicted monomer conversion was in good agreement w ith industrial pilot-plant data. Industrial emulsion (co) polym erization is generally performed in large-scale semi batch processes because o f the process fle x ib ility . During most batches, certain components such as em ulsifier, chain transfer agent and monomer have to be added to control the particle size distribution and other properties o f the polymer. Sclioltens et al. (2001) designed a tubular continuous flow reactor, a pulsed packed column (PPG), as an alternative fo r semi-batch reactors. The production o f copolymers o f styrene and methyl

acrylate was investigated to test the perfonnance o f the new reactor arrangement. The main
advantage o f the column is its a b ility to be operated under steady state condition in improved temperature control and elim ination o f batch-to-batch variations.

In more recent study, D oyle I I I et al. (2003) developed a population balance model fo r the particle size distribution in the emulsion copolym erization o f v in y l acetate and butyl acrylate w ith non-ionic poly (ethylene oxide) surfactants and a redox initiator. The effects o f nuclÃ©ation, growth and coagulation events were accounted for in the model. The model predicts to a reasonable accuracy the experimental data on the particle size distribution. The demand fo r producing polymers w ith special properties rose academic interest in the control and optim ization o f emulsion polym erization reactors. Some recent

contributions to the area o f optim ization o f polym erization reactor operation are surveyed herein. W u and co-workers (1982) were one o f the first groups who studied optim ization schemes for bulk polym erization o f styrene both theoretically and experimentally. They found optim al temperature policies by em ploying boundary condition iteration method to reach the final conversion and molecular weight averages. Later on, Jang and Yang (1989) employed a m ixed integration collocation m etliod (M IC O ) to obtain in itia to r feed policies for m in im izin g the batch tim e o f an emulsion polym erization reactor producing p o lyvin yl acetate. Constrains during their optim ization were m axim um polym erization rate and an upper lim it on the total amount o f initiator.

Furthermore, they proposed a m inim um final-tim e in itia to r concentration and/or temperature policies (Jang and Lin, 1991). Previously, it was assumed that tlie optim al in itiator policy fo r the operation o f a batch v in y l acetate latex reactor could be approximated by a collocation polynomial. But in their new study, the discontinuous policies were found using finite-elem ent collocation method. Since the physical and chemical properties o f the latex are usually different during different stages o f

polymerization, the discontinuous policies were shown to be superior to continuous ones. Other attempts were made to enhance the polym er quality and investigate benefits o f applying optim al operating conditions. Liang et al. (1992) developed optim al control policies fo r free radical polym erization o f styrene in a batch reactor. A m u lti objective dynamic optim ization technique was employed; monomer conversion, polym er m olecular weight, in itia to r residue level and total reaction time. The results showed the realization o f optimal in itia to r m ixture and reactor temperature can significantly im prove the

performance o f the batch process. Leiza et al. (1993) determined m inim um amount o f monomer required to in itia lly form copolym er w ith desired composition in semi-batch emulsion copolym erisation reactors. CoiToiu et al. (1999) worked on the optim ization o f a batch reactor temperature for emulsion polym erization o f styrene and a-methylstyrene. They m inim ized the reaction final time. Constraints were imposed on the end-product latex properties and thermal lim itations o f the p ilo t plan. The optim al temperature p rofile was tracked using a nonlinear

geometric control technique, w hich is particu.:, :y adapted to polym erization reactor control. Experimental results showed good agreement w ith m odel predictions. A control strategy fo r a simultaneous control o f m icrostructural properties o f copolymer latex was presented by Asua et al. (2002). The im plem entation o f the open-loop control allowed the production o f M M A /n -B A emulsion copolymers o f a w ell-defined

copolymer com position and m olecular weight distribution. Gao et al. (2004) reviewed several com m only used process optim ization policies. Since it is highly desirable in industry to reduce the production cost and produce a high quality polymer, tl ,e reactor temperature w ith selective mono- or bifunctional initiators were employed to decrease batch tim e fo r pre-specified m olecular weight averages. Due to high demand o f producing high quality polymers by emulsion

polym erization method, this mechanism s till needs to be more studied and effect o f various parameters on enhancement o f product property should be further investigated. Therefore this study deals w ith modeling and sim ulation o f emulsion hom opolym erization.

Furthermore the sim ulation results aie employed to optim ize the process by calculating optim al operating condition and also keep the reactor under stable and safe condition in order to avoid any runaway problem.

C hapter 3 D evelopm ent o f Kinetic M odel for Em ulsion Polym erization Reaction
This Chapter is dedicated fo r explaining the detail mechanism as w e ll as the m ethodology fo r development o f model fo r this mechanism. It is divided to two m ain sections: Reaction mechanism and M odel development respectively.

3.1 R eaction M echanism
The physical picture o f emulsion polym erization is based on the original qualitative mechanism of. Harkins [1947] and the quantitative theory o f Sm ith [1948]. A sim plified schematic representation o f an emulsion polym erization system is shown in Figure 3.1. E m ulsifier dissolves into water u n til its concentration reaches the critical m icelle concentration (C M C ). When the concentration exceeds the C M C value, it w ill form aggregates called micelles. Typical micelles have diameters o f 2-10 nm w ith each m icelle containing 50-150 em ulsifier molecules. The em ulsifier molecules are self-arranged Into a m icelle w ith their hydrophilic ends pointing hydrophobic ends pointing outwards. Generally, monomers can exist inside the micelles or fo rm large monomer droplets but since monomers are usually slightly soluble in water, the largest portion o f them is dispersed as monomer droplets in the water phase. The in itia to r present in the water phase decomposes into in itia tin g radicals. The most common initiators are potassium or sodium persulfate w hich are insoluble in organic monomers. Therefore, the m icelles act as a meeting place fo r the monomer and the initiator. Em ulsion polym erization is considered to undergo through three intervals: Â· Â« Â· Stage 1: Particle nuclÃ©ation and increasing growth rate Stage 2: Constant growth rate Stage 3: Decreasing polym erization rate towards the aqueous phase and their

As the polymer particles grow in size they absorb more and more emulsifier, causing the em ulsifier concentration to fall under the C M C level so the micelles w ill disappear. A t this point the number o f generated particles becomes a constant and the particle size continues to grow. In general, the number o f particles increases w ith time in Stage 1 and then remains constant in stage 2 and 3. The final number o f polym er particles is achieved in a very short tim e and subsequently starts to grow dui'ing stage 2. The fall o f free em ulsifier concentration under the CMC level characterizes the end to stage 1 . W ithout micelles, no new particle generation occurs. However, monomer droplets and aqueous free radicals are still present and diffuse into polymer particles.

Hence, polymer particles continue to grow in the second stage by absorbing monomer from monomer droplets. The second interval ends when all monomer droplets are consumed and after disappearance o f all monomer droplets, polym er particles ai'e the only

component present in the system. The final stage begins when the polymerization rate start decreasing as the monomer concentration in the polymer particles decreases. Furthermore, the number o f generated particles remains the same as stage 2 because no more new generation happens in this stage. Based on these stages, the general reaction mechanism o f emulsion polymerization can be described as:

3.1.1 Reaction Steps

Initiation
The first step in a polymerization reaction involves the creation o f highly reactive fi-ee radicals. The initiator w ill decompose into two reactive free radicals, which then react w ith monomers to produce primary radical R ` . The most commonly used in itiator in emulsion polymerization reaction is potassium persulfate. (3.1) (3.2)

Propagation
The second and main step o f emulsion polymerization reaction starts when the generated radicals propagate w ith monomer. The reaction results in a live polymeric radical chain o f length r + 1 . r> i (3.3)

Termination
Live polymer radicals may terminate upon encountering each other. T liis

termination may occur by a combination or disproportionation o f live radicals: Termination by combination (3.4) Termination by disproportionation + (3.5)

3.2 D evelopm ent o f K inetic model
Models for emulsion polymerization reactors vary greatly in their com plexity (Penlidis, 1986; Odian, 1991; Kum ar and Gupta, 1998). In the case o f designing a controller, the reactor model should be detailed enough and precise, hr order to develop the model fo r this process, a molar balance for each reactant, and molecular weight development equations for both linear and branched systems are included in tlris part. For emulsion polymerization monomers are usually classified into three categories; Â» Case 1; monomers w ith high water solubility and significant desorption, like vin yl acetate, vin yl chloride. Â· Case 2: monomers w ith lo w water solubility and negligible desorption, like styrene, butadiene. Â· Case 3: monomers that exhibit significant gel effect like M M A .

The model herein is used to study the characteristics o f vinyl acetate fuitlrer. The main characteristics o f emulsion polymerization o f vinyl acetate when there is no chain transfer agent and inhibitor in the reactor are; Â· Â· Â· The gel effect is usually not observed. Termination reactions are not as important as they are in bulk reactions. M olecular weight is m ainly controlled by chain transfer reactions to monomer and polymer. Â· Chain transfer to monomer is the first step in the desorption process.

In this section, the concentration o f each species in the feed stream is designated by the subscript F and Ã represents the average residence time o f the stream in the reactor.

As the area o f polymer particles increase, the radical capture rate by the existing polymer particles becomes greater than the rate o f initiation o f new radicals, therefore the homogeneous rate constant, ki,, decreases towards zero, since there is a higher probability for an oligomer to be captured by a pre-existing particle.

Total population balance theory Polymer model is based on the population balance strategy. In this approach, a

phase space is defined fo r particles whose coordinates describe its location as w e ll as its quality. This method is useful fo r all mechanisms in which the value o f each phase coordinate changes w ith time. In the present analysis the birth tim e o f the polymer particles in the reactor vesseft, is the phase coordinate. n (/,r) shows the class o f particles in the reactor at time t which were born in time r . Therefore, the number density o f particles in the phase space, n { t .r ) d T , can be defined as the class o f particles in the reactor at time t which were born between times r and r + t / r . Integration o f /?(/, r ) d r over tire time period t w ill give tire total number o f particles in the reactor at time t. Based on this definition, any physical property,/?(/, r ) , o f particles in the polymer reactor (e.g. the average diairreter or area o f a particle), can be calculated by summing up the p {t, v) over all classes o f particles in the reactor.

4.1.1 Batch emiiLsion polym erization reactor Figure 4.1 shows plots o f total polym er diameter, smface area and volum e versa batch time. The ability o f the model to account fo r particle volum e shrinlcage in stage 3 i clearly shown. This shrinkage is due to tire difference in densities o f monomer and polyme particles and occurs after 20 minutes o f reaction. N o rm a lly the polym er density is highe than the density o f monomer as it is stated in Table 3.2. Based on equation (3.57), befoi the critical conversion, the second term on the rig h t hand side o f the equation equals zer and the polymer density doesn' t have great effect on its size since there are s till mor

monomer droplets present in the system in comparison w ith polym er particles. When the monomer passes the critical value, the second term becomes active and according to equation (3.58), parameter c is a constant number less than one because the polymer density is more than monomer density. I f one substitutes all the parameters in equation (3.63) and does all the sim plifications, the fifth term on the right hand side o f this equation w ill be always less than zero and that is the reason fo r the shrinkage in size after com pletion o f the second stage. A fte r the second stage there w on' t be any monomer droplet in the system and based on the density' s d efin ition when the density increases the volume o f that particle decreases because o f their inverse relationship. Figure 4.2 shows conversion results. The critica l conversion (fo r vin yl acetate=20%) is shown in this Figure. A fter this point the rate o f polym erization starts decreasing due to gradual disappearance o f monomer droplets. Figure 4.3 plots the total number o f polymer particles versus conversion. A total number o f particles o f about 13x10'^ particle/L-latex was predicted. Therefore, the

number o f polym er particles grows very quickly in stage one and reaches a final constant from about 5% up to fu ll conversion. This observation proves the nuclÃ©ation theory discussed in Chapter 3. Thus, a ll properties o f the final product depending on the number

and size o f particles are defined in stage 1 which is generally the shortest o f the three stages. The particle number remains constant in both stage 2 and 3. As the polymer particles grow in size, they still contain monomer particles. They absorb more and more surfactant in order to maintain physical stability. By the end o f stage I, almost all the surfactant in the system has been absorbed. The water soluble monomers such as vin yl acetate tend to end stage 1 much faster than the less water soluble ones. This is m ainly a consequence o f the significant extent o f homogenous nuclÃ©ation occurring simultaneously w ith m icellar nuclÃ©ation results in achieving the steady state particle number sooner. Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show the predictions o f number and weight average molecular weights, respectively, w ith conversion. Generally it is known that the polymer produced in emulsion polym erization has ve iy high m olecular weights compared w ith bulk/solution polymerization. The variation o f polydispersity index (PDI) w ith conversion is displayed in Figure 4.6. W lien the conversion increases, the PDI also increases since it is a function o f

m olecular weight averages, which in turn become greater as the reaction proceeds. The average number o f long chain branching is plotted in the Figure 4.7. Equation (3.123) has been used to calculate this property. M ainly, reaction (3.11) is responsible fo r the generation o f branch points. A large number o f properties depend on the m olecular w eight distribution (M W D ) o f polym er chain, which is calculated using equation (3.124) and result o f w hich are plotted in Figure 4.8, fo r different final conversions. The higher the conversion, the w ider the distribution. This pltenomenon is due to an increase in the number o f branchings at higher conversion. Some research groups worked on this characteristic o f the polym er product and its sensitivity to the operating conditions (Tobita 1994; Choi and C row ley 1997). Variations o f the polym erization rate w ith conversion depend on the relative rates o f initiation, propagation and termination, which are in turn functions o f the operating conditions. Since the generation o f particles proliferate w ith tim e in stage 1, polym erization rate ( /?,,) also increases during this stage. In stage 2, the monomer concentration in the particles is maintained at the saturation level by diffusion o f monomer from solution and dissolution o f monomer from the monomer droplets. Stage 2 ends when the monomer droplets disappear and during stage 3 the monomer concentration decreases and consequently R,. goes down in this stage. Due to high water solubility o f vin yl acetate the transition fro m stage 2 to stage 3 occurs at conversion around 20%-30%. Therefore, stage 2 has a very short tim e fo r this monomer. The sim ulation result (Figure 4.9) also agrees w ith this theory and the model is able to account for polymerization rate reduction throughout the th ird stage.

In the next step o f this study, the effects o f the operating conditions have been studied. In the first sets o f runs, the em ulsifier concentration was set to 0.0417 m ol/L, w hile varying in itiator level. M odel testing results are shown in Figures 4.10-4.16. The higher concentration o f initiator, the higher the rates o f polym erization and conversion. Figure 4.11 shows that w ith higher initiator concentration, the reaction speeds up because more radicals are present in the system and as a result the monomer conversion goes to completion in a shorter time. Figure 4.10 also confirm s this trend. The in itiator

concentration does not have great influence on the size o f particles but the particle size

shrinks much sooner w ith higher in itiator concentration w hich is again the result o f shorter nuclÃ©ation tim e (stage 1) and constant growth rate o f m onom er-polym er particles (stage 2). Based on the model prediction fo r polymer particle diameter during the emulsion polym erization o f v in y l acetate under case 1 operating condition (Figure 4.10, part (a)), stage 2 lasts 20 minutes after adding the in itia to r to the system, while in higher concentration o f in itia to r the monomer droplets disappear in about 5 minutes. Furthermore, higher in itiator concentration yields in higher m olecular weights and increases the branching points o f the polym er (figures 4.13-4.16). The same study has been done on tire effect o f em ulsifier concentration on batch emulsion polym erization o f vin yl acetate. The model predictions are plotted in Figures 4.17-4.23. When the em ulsifier concentration increases, more micelles w ill be available in tire system. Therefore, the rate o f polym erization increases and p o lyvin yl acetate w ith higher molecular w eight is produced. A n im portant point, w hich should be stressed, is the number o f branching points. Feeding more in itia to r and em ulsifier to the system favours more branching points at the end o f reaction time. Sometimes polym er w ith high number o f branching is desired w h ile in some other circumstances, it is not. Therefore, based on the desired property o f the product, the concentration o f in itia to r and em ulsifier can be identified.

concentrations but the varying operating temperature between 40Â°C and 80Â°C. The results are shown in Figures 4.24-4.30. Figure 4.25 shows that w ith a constant temperature o f 80Â°C, a conversion o f about 90% is achieved in about ten minutes. The increase in the rate o f polym erization and also final product property is due to high sensitivity o f the rate constants to temperature. Higher temperature results in higher reaction rate so,

polymerization completes in shorter time. Some research groups, particularly L o ve ll et al. (1998) studied the effect o f chain transfer to polym er in free radical bulk and emulsion polymerization o f vin yl acetate using N M R spectroscopy. They stated out that in both bulk and emulsion polym erization, the mole percent o f branching increases steadily w ith overall conversion. Further, their experiments revealed that since the emulsion polymerisation proceeds exclusively w ith in the latex particles and at high instantaneous conversion, the level o f branching in the poly-vinyl acetate produced in em ulsion is higher than bulk

polym erization. They also studied the effect o f temperature on increasing the mole percent o f the branch points. The sim ulation results o f the current study fo r the number o f branching point, and also its sensitivity to the operation conditions are in good agreement w ith the studies found in literature. In all the performed runs, it was assumed that the reactor temperature is constant during the reaction, which means that the cooling medium can do its duty very w e ll that the temperature o f the system w ill be kept on a desired value. But in fact due to the exothermic nature o f polym erization reactions, it is not very easy to keep the temperature at a constant value throughout the reaction. In the next part o f this study, the variation effect o f temperature has been investigated and results are presented in Figures 4.31-4.37. The results compare the isothermal and nonisothermal cases. For sim ilar feed condition, firs t the reactor is run under isothermal condition in which it is assumed that reactor temperature remains constant at some desired value (T=50Â°C) while in nonisothermal condition, the reactor' s in itia l temperature is set at T=50 C and after that the cooling jacket is employed to keep the reactor temperature constant. Due the exothermic nature o f reaction, it is not possible to keep the temperature constant throughout the reaction w hich is the main reason to have different fin a l values for monomer conversion and m olecular w eight averages. Figure 4.36 plots the variation o f rector temperature throughout the reaction. Running the reactor under nonisothermal condition yields in lower conversion due to low er rate o f polym erization. Final properties o f the product such as m olecular w eight averages and number o f branch points are also decreased by application in nonisothermal operations. Consequently, the significant effect o f the initiator, em ulsifier concentrations and the temperature show the necessity o f designing good control strategies to keep the operating conditions on the desired value because a m inor variation in operating condition may results in deviation from the desired properties. It is know n that emulsion polym erization method produces polymers w ith high m olecular weight, compared to bulk/solution methods. Therefore, another control p olicy to control physical properties o f the final product is addition o f chain transfer agents (C T A ) to the reactor. Based on dead polymer m olar balances, (equations (3.116-3.118)), C T A decreases the molecular weight averages o f the product. When a polym er w ith lower

m olecular w eight is desired, chain transfer agents such as: t-nonyi mercaptan, n-dodecyl or mercaptan w ill be employed. Some researchers worked on molecular weight control in emulsion polym erization (M e ira e t al., 1998). The influence o f different C T A differs not only because o f their dissim ilar chemical structures but o f their d iffu sivity. CTAs w ith more carbon units have low er water solubility. W hen the reaction starts, a C T A w ith lo w water so lubility remains in the monomer droplets but it expected to diffuse out to polym er particles as the reaction proceeds. N o rm ally, a C T A w ith lower water solubility diffuses to the water phase much slower than that w ith high water solubility therefore the C T A affects the polym er property differently. atoms Figures 4.38-4.39 display the effect o f t-nonyl mercaptan w ith nine carbon = 0,0325 at T = 7 0 "C , M eira et al, 1998) on average molecular weight and

number o f branch points. The prediction o f molecular weight average is quite satisfactory and higher concentration o f C T A produces shorter polym er chains as more mercaptan is abstracted. Hence, low er average molecular weight is predicted. In order to validate the model the results should be compared w ith experimental data. Unfortunately, there have not been many studies done on emulsion polym erization o f vin yl acetate w ith sim ilar conditions. The only experimental data were found from Penlidis (1986). Plots in Figures 4.40-4.45 compare model predictions w ith experimental data. There is a good agreement between the model predictions and the data. Figure 4.41 shows plots o f the conversion in two different temperatures; as expected, higher temperature speeds up the reaction and the conversion goes to com pletion in shorter tim e. Figure 4.42 presents monomer conversion at two different levels o f em ulsifier. The sim ulation results successfully fo llo w the conversion points throughout the entire runs. In overall, the model gives also a good prediction o f the effect o f em ulsifier and reactor temperature on the emulsion polym erization. M ost studies neglect the presence o f im purities in the polym erization reactor. Since most industrial scale processes use either unpurified, partially purified monomers or monomer recycle streams, predictions may diverge from real process data. Figure 4.46-4.56 shows the model predictions o f several variables fo r different im purity levels in a batch emulsion polym erization o f V in yl Acetate. Plots o f conversion versus tim e show little difference fo r low concentration o f im purities but much larger effect at higher

concentration o f impurities (100-200 ppm). The validity o f the model observed comparing the results w ith experimental data (Figures 4.51-4.56). As it was discussed in chapter 3, it was assumed that the rate constant for changing to in hib itor is equal to rate constant o f propagation. Based on the operating condition shown in Figure 4.56 where = 0.84K,,

there is a good agreement between the experimental data and the model prediction, so it means that a reasonable assumption was made for value.

4.1.2 Sem i-batch em ulsion polym erization reactor

Generally, semi-batch polymerization reactors involve a continuous or intermittent addition o f one or more ingredients to the batch w hile the reaction is in progress. A ddition o f monomer dur' ng emulsion polymerization reaction leads to higher rate o f polymerization and also easier control o f the reaction rate. One effective strategy o f controlling polymer particle size is to control the polymer particle nuclÃ©ation time. From the developed equations which show the rate o f particle generation, it is evident that manipulation o f initiator or em ulsifier concentration or flo w rate can have significant effect on polymer particle nuclÃ©ation. As it is shown in Figures 4.3. most o f the nuclÃ©ation happens in stage 1, which fo r case 1 monomers is less than two minutes. Therefore, in a very short time almost all polymer particles are formed and subsequently start to grow during stage 2. It means that properties o f the final product dependent on the polymer particle number and defined in stage 1 and 2, w hich are both completed in less than 10 minutes. In the vinyl acetate case, the droplets disappear at low concentration complicated. Previous studies showed that the number o f polymer particles generated is almost independent o f in itiator concentration while the em ulsifier concentration can affect the number o f formed particles; hence it may be used to extend the nuclÃ©ation time. The em ulsifier can be feed in pulses or at a very slow constant feed rate to cause a series o f consecutive particles generation. Each particle generation lasts until the free em ulsifier level in the reaction become less than the critical micelles concentration (CMC). Previous studies (Penlidis, 1986) revealed that tlie system is extremely sensitive to em ulsifier flo w rate and development o f feed policies for em ulsifier was not very easy to realize due to high sensitivity o f the particle generation period to internal small changes. Another proposed approach is to manipulate ( /) , the free em ulsifier area in the reactor, to
(x c = 2 0 % ),

which makes the situation

monitor the desired number o f particles. Based on the value o f /4 ,,,(/), three partitions may exist: d^,,,(0 < 0 ; No micelles exist in the system and the m icellar nuclÃ©ation is zero. = The amount o f total em ulsifier in the system brings tlie m icellar

concentration up to the CMC level and covers the existing polymer particles.

-4,,,(/`) > 0: The total emulsifier is partially used to completely cover the surface o f the existing polymer particles and the remainder to exceed the C M C level and form new micelles. New micelles generate new polymer particles and fin a lly increase the total particle surface area. Figure 4.57 shows the adjustment o f ^,,,(0 to give the three particle generations. This adjustment drives the process to generate micelles three times during the reaction, every time the area o f the micelles positive. I f no em ulsifier is added in during the reaction, the m icellar area decays to zero in very short time, as shown in the same plot. Figure 4.58 shows the growth o f number o f polymer particles. A ll three consecutive generations can be detected in this plot. As a result, the effect on the duration o f stage 1 is considerable. This stage is extended to about 20 minutes by application o f new feed policy. The emulsifier feed policy needed to give was solved and is shown in Figure 4.60.

Since manipulation o f ^,,,(0 for extension o f the nuclÃ©ation time is not easy in practice because it is d iffic u lt to be followed during the reaction. So it is necessary to find the em ulsifier feed rate policy which gives the desired ( 0 versus time history. The

emulsifier feed rate policy has also a positive effect on the size o f particles. Since more micelles are present in the system, the size o f polymer particles increases (Figure 4.59).

4.1.3 C ontinuons stirre d tank reactor (CSTR) Batch and semi-batch reactors are m ostly used in industrial latex production. Continuous polym erization reactors can offer several advantages such as low er operating costs, better heat removal capabilities and more consistency in product quality. Continuous emulsion polym erization in a CSTR is much more com plex than batch polym erizations and often exhibits large and sustained oscillation in particle concentration, size and conversion. The oscillation is particularly true fo r case 1 monomers because o f the rapid generation o f a large number o f particles due to periodic particle nuclÃ©ation. A t the beginning o f the reaction, a large number o f particles is generated by particle nuclÃ©ation leading to an increase in the surface area o f the grow ing particles. The surface area is covered w ith emulsion molecules. Wlien the area o f particles becomes great enough, the total surface area o f m icelles becomes negative means there is no surfactant available in the reactor. As a result, the particle generation rate is lo w or even zero. A fte r a w h ile w ith a new em ulsifier being fed to the reactor, em ulsifier' s concentration becomes sufficient to fo m i new micelles and eventually start another stage o f particle nuclÃ©ation. The pronounced oscillation was studied by Kiparissides (1978) in great details. Furthermore, he worked on the effect o f feed condition (in itia to r and em ulsifier

concentration) and residence tim e in a single reactor.

The same experimental condition

was used in this study and Figures 4.61-4.65 represent sim ulation results using the presently developed model. The discussed process is easily revealed in these results too. In each interval when /1,,,(0 becomes greater than zero, a new particle generation occurs until all the m icellar area is used up by this new particles. As shown in figure 4.64, the rate o f polym erization also goes to zero when there is no m icelle available in the reactor, and then it increases very fast when the particle generation starts again. The mean residence time o f the reactor is an im portant factor that affects the process conversion. Figures 4.66-4.68 show another run under the same condition but lower residence time (9=20 min). The conversion remains below 30% w hile in the previous run (0=30 m in). the conversion was about 45%. The reactants need more tim e in the reactor, long ^nough to be absorbed by the micelles and to start the reaction. When the residence time is reduced, these components don' t have enough tim e to properly so most o f them may come out o f reactor unreacted. There is also a great difference in the number o f

76

generated particles. The faster the reactants come out o f the reactor, the fewer the generated particles are. Therefore defining a good residence time is an im portant factor in continuous polym erization reactors. I f the residence tim e is too high, it may result in accumulation in the system and on the other hand, low values o f residence time m ay decreases the monomer conversion as shown in Figures 4.66-4.68. In the next step, the same reaction is run under a nonisothermal condition, w hich results in a reduction in Nj, and conversion due to high sensitivity o f the reaction to

temperature variation (Figures 4.69-4.71). The plotted results u n til now pointed out the importance o f designing a proper residence time and reactor control policy in order to avoid producing polym er w ith undesired properties. The next concern is about the effect o f feed com position and its variation on the emulsion polym erization process. D uring the operation o f CSTRs, it is assumed that the feed is continuously fed to the reactor w ith a constant composition. This assumption is not very close to reality since in real processes there m ight be some variation in feed condition fo r different reasons. Figures 4.72-4.76 represent the effect o f step changes in in itia to r concentration. The concentration o f in itia to r is decreased to 0.005 m ol/L after 160 m in o f reactor operation. The number o f generated particles, polym erization rate and reaction conversion w ill decrease consequently because there are fewer radicals available in the reactor. The second step change is implemented at t=320 m in and the in itiator concentration is increased to 0.015 m o l/L , which results in a higher particle generation and higher reaction conversion. The same thing is done fo r the effect o f variation o f em ulsifier concentration. A t tim e t=160 m in the em ulsifier concentration is increased to 0.02 m o l/L and at tim e t=320 m in, is reduced to 0.008 m ol/L. The results o f this variation are shown in Figures 4.774.81. M odel testing is repeated for em ulsifier concentration changes and effects on the process state out that when the em ulsifier concentration in the system increases by any chance, the micelles w ill be available in the reactor fo r more tim e (Figure 4.80) therefore the influence o f this reactant on decreasing the reactor oscillation should be considered. Generally the effect o f feed com position and im plem entation o f any step change in teed condition beside the effect o f residence time has been studied fo r a continuous stirred

tank reactor. M ore Figures can be found in appendix A , displaying the effect o f operating conditions on some other reaction variables such as: (t) , etc.

Furthermore, it was shown that the nonisothermal runs o f the program results in lov.'er particle generation and conversion. According to the results, it can be concluded that i f it is desired to produce latex w ith high qualities, the control and optim ization o f operating conditions should be in the first priority. A prim ary consideration in the operation o f continuous reactors is the elim ination o f the oscillation phenomenon that is highly undesirable in industry due to probable serious im plication like reactor runaway. Since in case 1 monomers a rapid generation o f particles (particle nuclÃ©ation) happens in a very short time, the rate o f polym erization may become very high and the designed cooling capacity o f the reactor' s jacket m ight not be adequate to remove the released heat from the reactor. A remedy fo r this problem is proposed in the fo llo w in g section. Furthermore, oscillation can increase coagulation o f latex particles in the reactor and cause extensive long chain branching during the high conversion portion o f the oscillation.

4 .2 O p t im iz a t io n R e s u lts Generally the next step after modeling a process is to optim ize its operation. The model should be derived to describe the changes o f state variables as they are affected by manipulation o f input variables. Dynamic optim ization o f polym erization reactors usually deals w ith finding the optim al dynamic operation o f batch or semi-batch reactors and also start-up policies fo r continuous reactors.

4.2.1 Batch reactor optim ization Operation o f a typical batch reactor can be optim ized in different ways based on the objective fiinction and control variables. M ostly, the objective function is defined in the squared form o f some difference. In tlris study different objective functions are defined fo r both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions o f a batch reactor and results are discussed later. The objective functions for nine different cases are tabulated in Table 4.2. The optim ization toolbox in M atlab has been used to optim ize the operation o f batch emulsion polym erization reactor. Generally, optim ization methods are divided to two main classes; direct search methods and indirect search methods. For instance, the NeiderMead method falls in the general class o f direct search methods, w hich attempts to m inim ize a nonlinear function o f n real variables using o n ly function values, w ith out any derivative inform ation. In this method a simplex in Â«-dimensional space is characterized by the n+ J distinct vectors that are its vertices. In two-space, a sim plex is a triangle; in threespace, it is a pyramid. A t each step o f the search, a new point in or near the current simplex is generated. The function value at the new point is compared w ith the function values at the vertices o f the simplex and usually, one o f the vertices is replaced by the new point, giving a new simplex. This step is repeated until the diameter o f the sim plex is less than a pre-specified tolerance.

In the first set o f runs, the objective is to m axim ize the monomer conversion in the reactor using feed temperature as tire optim ization variable. The reactor is run under isothermal condition. I f polym erization starts under previous condition (case 1) to polymerize 4.32 m ol/L o f vin yl acetate, the final m onom er conversion w ill be about 90% but by using the optim ization toolbox and im plem enting new reactor temperature, the monomer conversion reaches to 100% much faster. The effect o f new reactor temperature policy on the number o f generated particles is shown in part (a) o f Figure (4.82). Higher temperature yields in lower number o f particles. Therefore, there is not a great reduction in the property o f the product and does not have significant effect on the product quality. The phenomenon is due to higher rate o f polymerization. Higher temperatures speed up reaction rates, w hich in turn generate particles to grow faster based on equation (3.23) ( ^ ,,,( 0 = ( [5 '( 0 ]~ [`5'(0]f,w f)`^<,^/i ~ ^ p ( O X where the m icelle area falls under its critical point (end o f stage 1). As a result, low er number o f particles are generated. The effect o f optim al operating condition on m olecular w eight averages is displayed in parts (c) and (d) o f Figure (4.83). W ith higher temperature, low er m olecular w eight averages ate produced than the standard case. S im ilar results were achieved in the previous section (m odeling and sim ulation results), when the effect o f reactor temperature on molecular w eight averages was investigated. Figures 4.82(e) and 4.82(f) show the number o f branching points and polydispersity index. The final number o f branching points and polydispersity index obtained are higher in the case o f optim al operating temperature. Therefore, fo r higher conversion w ith no change in product quality, there should be some conditions on the molecular w eight averages o f product. In the next set o f runs a non-isothermal reactor is studied w o rking under the same operating condition o f case 1. As Figure 4.83, the final conversion is low er than w ith the isothermal case. Thus it is im portant to find a good feed policy beside proper cooling medium temperature, w hich gives higher monomer conversion. Running the reactor under new operating condition calculated by the optim ization toolbox can solve this problem and bring the reactor conversion to fu ll. The start-up temperature was set to 50Â°C but after that the cooling jacket is employed to control the reactor temperature in order to reach higher monomer conversion. This new optim ization policy produces sim ilar effects on the product

D uring run #3, the goal is the same as run #1 but it was desired to know i f the concentrations o f em ulsifier and initiator in the feed are enough to polymerize 4.32 mol/L vin yl acetate monomer. Since, usually one o f the most im portant aspects o f any industrial process is its economical point o f view. So it is important to make using the lowest amount o f initiator and em ulsifier fo r polymerization possible. In this part, three variables are considered and i f one compares the optim ization results w ith those o f case 1, it can be seen that the in itia to r and em ulsifier concentrations in case 1 are almost the same as optimal values and it is ju st recommended to run the reactor under higher temperature (the same as run #1). The effect o f higher reactor temperature on product can be again seen in Figure

4.84.
Runs #4 and #5 deal w ith optim izing the system to get the desired weight average molecular weight, M w . So i f in any condition, one wants to have low er molecular weight averages, this optim ization package can calculate better feed policies. A s discussed in part 4.1.1, one o f the solutions to decrease the molecular weight averages is to add a certain amount o f chain transfer agent (C T A ) to the reactor. In this section, the best amount o f required C T A is calculated fo r both isothermal and non-isothermal cases. The final conversion is the same as standard case because the objective is defined to decrease the weight average molecular weight in the same conversion as standard case. Polym erization o f vin yl acetate under case 1 condition results in weight average molecular weights o f about 1.8 x 10^ g-/mo/e and 6 x 10*^ g /m o/e for isothermal and nonisothermal conditions respectively. But by application o f optim al feed policy and addition o f some C T A , the weight average molecular weight o f the product can be kept on some desired value (8 x 10'" g /m o/e and 4 x 10^ g / mo/e ) while the monomer conversion w on' t change (Figures 4.85-4.86). In the next runs (#6 and #7), the objective functions consist o f two parts, the first part deals w ith keeping the w eight average molecular weight on some desired value and the second part works on increasing the monomer conversion to its highest value. Based on this new defined objective function, new feed policies are found for isothermal/non-isothermal conditions. Figures 4.87-4.88 display the optim ization results, which present the

advantages o f newly defined objective function, which is able to increase the monomer conversion without deteriorating the product quality. In other words, by this method the monomer conversion and product properties can be controlled simultaneously. Generally, runs # l-# 5 were preliminary approaches fo r investigation o f optimal operating conditions effecting the monomer conversion and product properties. They are helpful to understand the process behaviour under each objective function separately and then combine them in one m ulti objective function to fin d a more general optim al policy which can optimize the system from both points o f view. As discussed before, monomer conversion of industrial scale emulsion

polymerization reactors has some deviation (usually reduction) from the laboratory scale results. Usually purified monomers are employed for experimental purposes w hile in industrial operations; unpurified, partially purified or even recycled monomers are used in which the presence o f impurities is very probable. The effect o f im purities on reduction o f monomer conversion has been studied in modeling and sim ulation part and here in run #8, the objective function is defined to maximize the monomer conversion while there is 200 ppm o f im purity in the reactor. In the presence o f im purity, the final reactor conversion reaches 90% but application o f optimal feed policy the conversion can goes to 100%. In order to increase the conversion, it is required to feed more em ulsifier and in itiator to the reactor since some part o f generated radicals is consumed by the impurities. A large number o f properties depend on tire molecular weight distribution o f the polymer. The higher the conversion, the wider the graph. This phenomenon is due to an increase in the number o f branching in higher conversion. Since it is usually desired to

have higher conversion w ith less branching, the optim ization toolbox can be employed to find the best feed policy which gives a narrower distribution in the same conversion. As shown in Figure 4.89 part (a), the distribution for 91% o f conversion is wider than that for 82%. So i f one selects the solid line (x=0.82) as the desired line and optimizes the system in order to get it in higher conversion (x=0.91), the optim ization toolbox is able to find the best policy. The objective function in this part (run #9) consists o f summation o f three parts. The distribution (equation 3.124) is a function o f molecular weight averages, the optimization method for the conditions that giving the final molecular weight averages (previously obtained at 82%) but having higher conversion o f 91%, which is incorporated

in the objective function. In the other words, the set points fo r molecular weight averages are the same as those w ith 82% o f conversion. The optim ization results show good performance as shown in Figure 4.89 (b), M W D becomes narrower in comparison w ith that obtained w ith 91 % o f monomer conversion. In this part the Matlab optimization toolbox was employed to find optimal operating conditions fo r vinyl acetate polymerization reactor. The results recommend good feed policies. The next step o f this study deals w ith optimization o f CSTRs. As it was shown in section 4.1.1, due to periodic generation o f micelles, these reactors have oscillatory behaviour so the next concern is to find some remedies to suppress the oscillation.

C o n tin u o u s reactor optim ization

Possible solutions to the oscillation problem
The problems encountered when operating emulsion continuous reactors show the importance o f finding possible solutions to overdamp the oscillatory behaviour o f the process. The oscillatory behaviour of a single CSTR was w idely investigated

experimentally by Penlidis (1986). The first and common remedy is to run the process w ith higher em ulsifier concentration (Penlidis, 1984; Nom ura et el., 2002). The oscillation w ill be elim inated as the high soap concentration hinders o n -o ff nuclÃ©ation o f polym er particle (Figures 4.91-492). As long as, the concentration o f em ulsifier is higher than its critica l value, A ,,, ( t) w ill be greater than zero. Nomura et al. (2002) also carried out continuous em ulsion polym erization o f v in y l acetate and investigated the effect o f residence tim e and in itia to r concentration on the oscillatory behaviour o f the reactor. S im ilar conditions are applied in the present sim ulation procedure and the results are in agreement w ith their study. M odel testing results are shown in Figures 4.93-4.95. Low er residence time leads to lower oscillation since the monomer conversion is low. Besides, running the reactor under lower concentration o f in itia to r decreases the unsteady behaviour but the lo w number o f radicals result in low er monomer conversion and low er number o f generated particles. E lim ination o f the oscillations, using higher concentration o f em ulsifier is not a practical solution from a standpoint o f both

experimental and product quality. M ore em ulsifier means more expensive operation, larger number o f generated particles and reduced capability to control particle size. C ontrollab ility o f the polymer particle size and its distribution by taking advantage o f the self-sustained oscillations o f monomer conversion was examined by Ohmura et al. (1998) in continuous emulsion polym erization o f vin yl acetate. He stated that due to the dependence o f particle size distribution on operating conditions, this distribution and also monomer conversion can be controlled by varying the em ulsifier concentration under its C M C level. In their recent study, application o f novel operating method was studied for

controlling the particle "hze distribution. The mean residence tim e was switched between two values, w hich can afiect the size o f particles. Another possible remedy to this problem can be done by feeding a stream o f seed particles to the reactor continuously. The continuous addition o f seed particles prevents new particle form ation. The results. Figures 4.97-4.98, show that the conversion and the number o f particles are much more stable in a seeded reactor in comparison those in unseeded reactor. Besides, the monomer conversion is high and results in high productivity o f the process. The next design consideration focuses on the w a' o f seeding the reactor. Batch wise production o f seeds is costly and also is it hard to keep a consistent seed property from batch to batch operation. A short plug flo w tubular reactor (PFTR) can be employed as a seeder to accomplish the nuclÃ©ation but it may cause operational and cleaning problems due to agglomeration, wall fouling and plugging. Since, a small PFTR is sim ilar to a small CSTR, it is more recommended to employ a small CSTR fo r a better m ixing, operation and cleaning.

A S p lit Feed Seeding R eactor Design A reactor configuration for a non-oscillatory production o f P V A c in continuous emulsion reactors was suggested by Pollock et al. (1981). In the design procedure, the first large reactor is preceded by a very small in itia l CSTR (approxim ately one tenth or less o f the size o f the subsequent reactor in the train). In order to keep em ulsifier and in itiator concentrations high in the small reactor, almost all o f the in itia to r and em ulsifier were fed into it. W ith this configuration, the in itiator and em ulsifier concentration in the seed reactor plus the degree o f split o f monomer and water can be controlled to produce P V A c w ith desired properties. Usually 10-40 percent o f monomer and water are fed to the small CSTR, therefore it can operate under high concentration o f in itia to r and em ulsifier. As a result, generation o f most polymer particles can be entirely accomplished in the first reactor and the second reactor be used only for particle growth. Figure 4.90 presents the reactor configuration.

A d e fin ition o f flo w split was proposed by Penlidis (1986), w hich is more easily applicable for on-line measurements.

Table 4.3 shows the flo w rate profiles o f this run. In itia to r flo w rate and split are changed to show their effect on conversion. The conversion behaviour for parts A , B and C is shown in Figures 4.99-4.101.

D uring part A , no in itiator is fed to the seed reactor, so this reactor acts like an em ulsifying vessel w ith zero conversion. In this part when all in itia to r is diverted to the second reactor, the oscillatory behaviour is evident which verifies the usual unstable behaviour o f conventional CSTRs once more. In parts B and C, the polymerization starts by feeding some amount o f in itiator to the first reactor. A lthough this reactor has oscillatory behaviour, the second reactor reaches its steady behaviour soon after start-up and does not show any oscillation. These results again show the stable behaviour o f the new train in the presence o f tire seeding reactor (Figures 4.99-4.101). The solid line in Figure 4.102 shows the model prediction, which is close to experimental data (Penlidis, 1986). The decrease in conversion o f part C (experimental data) is due to problem happened during running the experiments such as: leakage or inconsistency in em ulsifier and monomer flo w rate to the first reactor. These problems usually mean lower polym erization rate and number o f polymer particles. Generally the two-reactor configuration presented its superiority to the conventional reactor in overdamping the oscillation. I f the emulsion polym erization is carried out in these reactors, the main focus can be on controlling the operating conditions to produce high quality latex since the reactor operates under stable condition. The splifted amount o f defined split can affect the product properties so it is important to apply control scheme to

have the optimal split. Obviously, any other controller must be considered m ainly fo r the seeding reactor and what is just important about the second reactor it trying to keep the em ulsifier concentration under its CM C level throughout the reaction in order to avoid any more particle generation which results in overshoots in its behaviour.

Chapter 5 Conclusions
The reaction mechanism o f emulsion polym erization was described in detail in this study. A mathematical model was developed for emulsion polym erization and applied on batch, semi-batch and continuous reactors. The probability o f presence o f monomer soluble im purities was also considered in this model since in industrial scale plants, it- is very common to have some im purity in monomer. The model was tested fo r polymerization o f ' vinyl acetate. Moreover, the effects o f initiator and em ulsifier concentrations as w ell as reactor temperature on monomer conversion and product properties have been investigated in detail. The results revealed the sensitivity o f the process to these variables. The sim ulation results were compared w ith experimental data and the model successfully followed these data in most o f the conditions. The next section o f this study deals with optim ization o f the process in both batch and continuous reactors. The optim ization o f batch reactor was carried out m ainly w ith the aim o f increasing the monomer conversion as w e ll as producing polym er w ith desired properties. Some suggestions were proposed to enhance the quality o f the polym er in the continuous reactor mode, the main problem as shown in chapter 4 is reactor' s oscillatory behaviour, therefore some remedies have been suggested and the results were also in good agreement w ith experimental data.

Chapter 6 Recommendations
Since this study was only a theoretical research paper, there can be some recommendation considered in future works. Â· Set up a small emulsion polymerization reactor and perform some lab-scale

experiments Â· Perfonnance o f some experiments to test the va lid ity o f proposed optim ization

policies for batch and continuous reactors. Â· A pplication o f the same study on emulsion copolym erization w ith the aim o f

enhancing polym er properties
