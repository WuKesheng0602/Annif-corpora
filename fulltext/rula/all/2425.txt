ABSTRACT

Canada is facing a major crisis with the deterioration of its infrastructure (bridges, harbors, buildings, water struetures, sewers, parking garages, etc.). Many of these structures were build using precast prestressed concrete members. These members may be under-strength because of deficiencies in design, increase in applied loads, loss of prestress, or damage due to the effects of corrosion, collision or military operations. Epoxy-bonding composite materials to the tension side of prestressed concrete girders is an effective technique for shear/flexural rehabilitation and strengthening of such members. To ensure successful and cost-effective applications of such materials, engineers need to improve their knowledge with respect to the actual behavior of full-size girders so that they can gain confidence on using these materials on structural strengthening and rehabilitation. This can be achieved by providing more data on testing to-collapse and on field conditions full-scale prestressed girders strengthened using FRP materials. This study details the use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Sheets to repair and strengthen preeast prestressed concrete Double-Tee (DT) girders in flexure and shear. Three actual-size partially-damaged DT precast pretensioned girders were obtained from the manufacturer. All three of the girders were repaired and strengthened, and then tested to failure to determine flexural and shear capacities. The stems of two of these girders were strengthened in flexures using U-shape un-directional carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets (CFRP), extending from the mid-span to the quarter points of the girders. Two girders were strengthened in shear the dapped ends using 0° wrapping technique around the stem, while the dapped ends of the third girder were strengthened using 0°/90° wrapping technique. Each girder was loaded incrementally up to failure using Jersey Barriers. This project summarizes the loading history and reports test results that can be further used to demonstrate the practicality of girder strengthening with CFRP sheets in field conditions.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION
1.1 General
Double-Tee (DT) precast pretensioned girder members are a vital part of our modem infrastmcture, they are used to constract civil projects nation wide. They can be found in residential, industrial and commercial buildings as well as bridge decks, and parking garages. Predominately used in parking garages, these girders make up a key component to the overall design. The design of parking garages is generally made up in such a way as to blend serviceability issues to cost effectiveness and most importantly speed up the construction phase otherwise known as down-time of a project. Parking garages are mainly built up of precast members. As the foundation and slab on grade floor system is developed, the only members that are cast in-situ are the columns. Once the columns are set and poured in to place, precast members making up the support beams are lifted and simply supported by these columns at each end. The next step is to install the double-Tee girders whom span from support beam to support beam much like a joist in conventional residential construction. Once one floor of the parking garage is completely finished a surface course made up of three to four inches of concrete is poured in-situ over the whole area. This process not only acts as a surface wearing course but also as a cover to external detrimental elements that would deteriorate the precast sections. As one floor is completed these steps are repeated to complete the construction for the successive floors. Figure 1.1 shows a photo of flat slab parking garage located at Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Ontario.

Cities and Municipalities depend on structures such as parking garages to perform their activities and serve the public. The increasing age of these structures is becoming a major concern, requiring new and improved rehabilitation methods. The conventional means of rehabilitating a damaged double T girder would be to close that section of the parking garage, break away at the damaged concrete and pour a new concrete patch over the effect area. This method is not only very expensive, but will only act as a band-aid and solve the problem temporarily, giving way for reoccurring deterioration. A superior way to ensure the durability and serviceability of these structures must be found. In order to meet this challenge, this thesis presents an innovative rehabilitation technique that involves the use of externally bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) to strengthen the deteriorated or damaged structure.

1.2

The Problem

Parking structures and bridge decks in many parts of Canada and the USA are exposed to severe environmental conditions. The main being de-icing chemicals. Chemicals such as salt cause corrosion of the steel reinforcement in concrete structures. It has been found

that parking structures may start to suffer from reinforcing steel corrosion due to de-icing salt only 10 years after their construction (Walker, 1986). In Canada, the estimated cost of repairing existing parking structures is in the range of four to six billion dollars. The estimated repair and rehabilitation cost of the existing highway bridges and parking structures in the USA is over 50 billion dollars (Michaluk et al. 1998). A npmber of methods and precautions have been introduced to prevent corrosion of steel reinforcement. Among those methods are decreasing the permeability of concrete by using dense concrete, adding additives to concrete, coating concrete with impermeable layers, coating steel rebar with epoxy and cathodic protection of reinforcement, and providing thicker cover to the reinforcement. However, most of these protection measures inerease the cost of the structure and do not prevent corrosion completely; rather they delay the problem, and they may even worsen the problem if not done properly. There are many conventional systems that can be approached to retrofit old parking garages. Most of which only act as a temporary fix and not a cure. An ideal solution is to reinforce the girder by using fiber reinforced polymer sheets (FRP) which are immune to corrosion. Of course, the new reinforcement must have adequate strength and stiffiiess and must be reasonably economical. It must also be able to withstand other environmental and short and long term loading effects. Among the FRP, carbon fiber
3

reinforced polymers (CFRP) are known to be practically immune to chemical attacks and they have high strength and relatively high modulus elasticity. To ensure successful and cost-effective applications of such materials, engineers need to improve their knowledge with respect to the actual behavior of full-size girders so that they can gain confidence on using these materials on structural strengthening and rehabilitation. This can be achieved by providing more data on testing to-collapse and on field conditions full-scale prestressed girders strengthened using FRP materials. This study details the use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Sheets to repair and strengthen precast prestressed concrete Double-Tee (DT) girders in flexure and shear.

1.3

Objectives

The proposed research is aimed at conducting field-testing of full-scale deteriorated double-tee (DT) precast pretensioned girders strengthened with carbon fiber polymer (CFRP) sheets so that further studies can be conducted to answer the following questions: 1. How is the safety level of a double-tee (DT) precast/prestressed girder

compromised if it is strengthened using carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) sheets? How much strengthening is beneficial, and when is it detrimental? 2. How the experimental findings correlate with the available design equations for

flexure and shear for the precast pretensioned concrete girder? 3. How the recently developed FRP design codes fit with the experimental findings

recorded in this thesis?

1.4

Scope

The focus of this study is on three precast prestressed double-tee girders of different geometric characteristics and level of damage. All three of the girders were repaired and strengthened, and then tested to failure to determine flexural and shear capacities. The stems of two of these girders were strengthened in flexures using U-shape un-directional carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets (CFRP), extending from the mid-span to the quarter points of the girders. While all the three girders were strengthened in shear at the dappedends. Two girders were strengthened in shear the dapped ends using 0° wrapping technique around the stem, while the dapped ends of the third girder were strengthened using 0° / 90° wrapping technique. Each girder was loaded incrementally up to failure using Jersey Barriers. The results from testing were reported for further studies to demonstrate the practicality of strengthening a damaged structure with bonded CFRP sheets in field conditions through comparison between the experimental findings and the theoretical results from the available equation for flexural and shear capacities of such girders was made.

LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 General
In the last couple of decades, a significant amount of research has been conducted to predict the behavior of different types of fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) as used for strengthening, rehabilitation or retrofitting of stmctural members. However, very few

studies have been undertaken to investigate the application of such material to full-scale structural members. This chapter deals with literature review pertained to concrete beams of various sizes and design configurations strengthened in flexure, shear or combined flexure and shear. Also, this chapter summarizes the characteristics of FRP material used in structural applications.

2.2

Literature Review of Beam Strengthening

2.2.1 Flexure Few authors dealt with the behavior of concrete beams strengthened using FRP. Bonacci and Maalej (2001) studied the performance of conventionally reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened in flexure with externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymers (EB-FRP). A database of experimental testing results was compiled on which 127 specimens from 23 separate studies were included in the database. A profile of specimens in the database was given, followed by an analysis of trends in failure mode, strength gain, and deformability. Failure by de-bonding of FRP was prevalent among specimens in the database. One-third of the specimens with external reinforcement added
6

showed strength increases of 50% or more in combination with considerable deflection capacity. It was clear from the experimental studies that the followed procedures were most representative of member strengthening rather than repair. Most of the specimens in the database were not subjected to sustained loading or damage causing loss of original capacity before external reinforcement was added. To assess the real potential of using FRP for expedient and economical field repair and strengthening of RC members, it was concluded that future research on the application of FRP to RC members should focus on conditions that are similar to what is observed in the field, including the effects of sustained load during repair/strengthening as well as corrosion- and load-induced damage.

Rahimi and Hutchinson (2001) investigated the structural behavior of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with adhesively bonded fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP). The experimental work included flexural testing of 2.3-m-long concrete beams with bonded external reinforcements. The test variables included the amount o f conventional (internal) reinforcement and also the type and amount of external reinforcement. For comparison, some of the beams were strengthened with bonded steel plates. Theoretical analyses included 2D nonlinear finite-element modeling incorporating a "damage" material model for concrete. In general there were reasonably good correlations between the experimental results and nonlinear finite-element models. It was suggested that the detachment o f bonded external plates from the concrete at ultimate loads was governed by a limiting principal stress value at the concrete/external plate interface.

Fanning and Kelly (2001) studied the ultimate response of reinforced concrete

beams strengthened with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) plates. The beams in this study were precracked with an initial loading of 30 to 70 percent of the ultimate capacity of the member, below the yielding of the tensile steel. It was observed that at higher load levels, the crack patterns in beams with externally bonded fiber reinforced polymer strips have exhibited a shift from several widely spaced large cracks to many smaller cracks at a much closer spacing. It was calculated that thicker strips provide a larger area of FRP and can provide greater amounts of strengthening. As the thickness of a FRP strip is increased, the peeling stresses at the strip end increase as a result of moving the tensile force resultant farther from the bottom surface of the concrete beam. These peeling stresses tend to pull the end of the strip away from the beam, causing a delamination failure. It was also observed that the smaller the length of the sheet is extended into the shear span of a beam loaded in three or four point bending, the more likely the strip is to peel off.

De Lorenzis et al. (2001), studied Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates as being successfully used worldwide for strengthening existing reinforced concrete structures. The bond of FRP reinforcement to the concrete substrate was of critical importance for the effectiveness of the technique. In this project, flexural test specimens were prepared to address some of the factors expected to affect bond, namely: bonded length, concrete strength, number of plies (stiffness), ply width, and, to a limited extent, surface preparation. A linear bond stress-slip relationship, along with a simple shear model for the evaluation of the slip modulus, was used to predict the strain distribution at moderate load levels. Finally, expressions of the peeling load and the effective bond

length were presented. A design equation was proposed for calculating the effective FRP ultimate strain to be used in design to account for bond-controlled failure.

Bonacci and Maalej (2000) studied the effect of externally bonded fiberreinforced polymer for rehabilitation of corrosion damaged concrete beams. The authors reported the results of an experimental program designed to provide a realistic assessment of the potential of using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials in the repair and strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) fiexural members. The experimental program included seven RC fiexural beams 270 x 400 mm in cross section and 4350 mm in length. Four of the seven RC beams were reinforced externally with one or two layers of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite. Different variables considered in this experimental program included state of damage (damaged versus undamaged) and loading condition during bonding (loaded versus unloaded). Damage was introduced in four of the seven RC beams using an accelerated corrosion technique developed at University of Toronto. Tests in the current study show that it is necessary to consider the effects of corrosion- and load-induced damage as well as sustained load on the loadcarrying and deflection capacities of externally reinforced fiexural members. Also, it is concluded that it is possible to achieve adequate corrosion repair with externally bonded CFRP with minimal intervention. In particular, the current study shows that it is important to optimize CFRP layout to balance strength recovery with control of faulting and splitting, which could lead to premature member failure.

Sebastian (2001) investigated the significance of midspan debonding failure in

fiber reinforced polymer-plated concrete. Reinforced concrete beams enhanced in flexure with adhesively-bonded fibre reinforced polymer plates are susceptible to a brittle form of failure, defined by delamination of the cover concrete attached to the adhesive that causes the plates to debond from the beam. The author demonstrates that, while previous research has focused on one debonding mode in which concrete delamination progresses from the ends of the plates inwards, there exists another critical debond mode that initiates near flexural cracks in the midspan region of the plated beam and propagates out to the ends of the plates. Data from large-scale experimental work are presented to show that midspan debonding action is triggered by high shear stresses transmitted from the plates through the adhesive to the cover concrete. These stresses arise initially from tension stiffening in the cracked concrete and corrosion of the embedded steel. It is shown that strain gauge data are required from both the bonded and exposed surfaces of the plate for accurate quantification of these shear stresses. The shear span of the external load and the stiffness of the plate are cited as parameters that may influence whether in practice end peel or midspan debond occur in plated beams. The paper concludes by describing compulsory features of any numerical modeling of the midspan debond phenomenon.

Spadea et al. (2001) studied the strength and ductility of reinforced concrete beams repaired with bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymers. Three series of tests on eleven reinforced concrete beams were carried out and their ultimate load capacities and ductilities were evaluated. The variables considered in this experimental program were longitudinal steel ratio, the volume of the internal stirrups, and the location and configuration of external anchorages. The results show that both deflection and energy

10

absorption are drastically reduced when beams are strengthened with bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymers plates without external anchorages. Suitably designed and positioned external anchorages allow much of this lost ductility to be regained; however, even then the ductility of the strengthened beam can not be restored to its original level. It is shown that definitions of ductility based on deflection and energy are able to give a good and rational representation of the physical aspects of ductility o f reinforced concrete beams strengthened with bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminates with or without external anchorages.

Brena et al. (2003) predicted the increasing flexural capacity of reinforced concrete beams using carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites. A series of reinforced concrete beams strengthened in flexure using different carbon fiber-reinforced polymers composite systems were fabricated and tested in the laboratory to examine the effects of the strengthening configuration on the specimen behavior. The main goal of these tests was to explore different strengthening configurations capable of developing the strength of the composite laminates and preclude failure by debonding of the composite systems from the concrete surface. Results indicate that relying on the contact area between the composite laminates and the concrete surface is not sufficient to eliminate debonding. Strengthening configurations involving techniques such as placement of transverse straps along the composite laminates or bonding the composites on the side surface of the specimens controlled debonding and provided a more ductile failure mode than placement on the bottom surface of the beams.

11

Harraq, et al. (2002) made an investigation of prestressed concrete girders strengthened with externally bonded carbon fibre sheets. Prestressed concrete beams may be under-strength because of deficiencies in design, increases in applied loads, loss of prestress, damage due to the effect of collision, corrosion or military operations and salt damage. There has been limited research on the repair of environmental exposure, inadequate design and heavy traffic. Because they are impermeable, the laminates resist moisture and the resulting corrosion. An added advantage of carbon laminates is their ease installation due to their extremely light weight compared to steel or concrete. The authors examined the strength enhancement provided to the flexural capacity of prestressed concrete girders by the external bonding of carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminates through a large scale beam study. Seven half scale standard CPCI 900 mm pretensioned bridge girders comprising two unreinforced and five reinforced by carbon fiber reinforced polymer were considered in this study. They conclude that by bonding the CFRP sheets the loss of prestressing can be compensated and the durability can be improved.

2.2.2

Shear Antonopoulos and Triantafillou (2003) investigated experimentally the

strengthening of reinforced concrete beam-column joints. The results of a comprehensive experimental program, aimed at providing a fundamental understanding of the behavior of shear-critical exterior reinforced concrete joints strengthened with fiber reinforced polymers under simulated seismic load, were presented. The role of various parameters on the effectiveness of fiber reinforced polymers was examined through 2/3-scale testing

12

of 18 exterior reinforced concrete joints. Conclusions were drawn on the basis of certain load versus imposed displacement response characteristics, comprising the strength (maximum lateral load), the stiffness, and the cumulative energy dissipation capacity. The results demonstrate the important role of including the distribution o f fiber reinforced polymers between the beam and the column, column axial load, internal joint (steel) reinforcement, initial damage, carbon versus glass fibers, sheets versus strips, and effect of transverse beams.

Chaallal et al. (2002) investigated retrofitting techniques for reinforced concrete bridges for shear using fiber reinforced polymers. Damage sustained by reinforced members was observed to be due to problems related to marine environments, use of deicing salts and an overall increase in the number and permissible weight end bearing. A total of 14 T-girders were reinforced in shear by externally bonding CFRP sheets to the web and were tested under static loading. Deflection and strain responses were observed yielding positive results for the reinforced specimens as compared to the control ones.

Deniaud and Cheng (2001) investigated the different design methods found in the literature for reinforced concrete beams strengthened externally with FRP sheets. The FRF shear design methods presented include the effective FRP strain and the bond mechanism method with shear friction approach. A total of 16 full-scale T-beam test results were used in the evaluation. The test results showed that the mechanical model using the strip method with shear friction approach evaluates better the FRP shear contribution. The predicted capacities from this mechanical model are also found

13

conservative and in excellent agreement with the test results. In conclusion, with the exception of the shear friction method, all the design models yield very conservative and scattered predictions with a test-to-predicted coefficient variation exceeding 20%.

Naito et al. (2002) evaluated bridge beam-column joints under simulated seismic loading. The studies of 1989 Lama Prieta earthquake effects resulted in higher design requirements for transverse reinforcement in reinforced concrete bridge beam-column joints constructed in California. In general, the proposed reinforcement details can be congested and difficult to construct. An experimental investigation examined four largescale interior joints with details typical to those required in California. The experimental program included tied square cross-section columns and spirally reinforced circular cross-section columns. Both conventional and headed joint reinforcement configurations were investigated. Experimental results show that existing design requirements produce joints that remain essentially elastic to relatively large drifts, whereas the columns develop inelastic rotations adjacent to the joints. The use of headed reinforcement within the joint regions was shown to be effective in reducing congestion and thereby improving constructability while maintaining comparable structural behavior.

2.2.3 Combined Flexure and Shear Sheikh et al. (2002) investigated retrofitting techniques for concrete structures for shear and flexural using fiber reinforced polymers. Damage sustained by foundation walls and large beams in a building was simulated in full-size to near-full-scale model specimens in the laboratory. The damaged specimens were repaired with carbon and
14

glass fiber-reinforced polymer sheets and tested to failure. Control specimens were tested to failure without rehabilitation to provide a basis for comparison and evaluate the effectiveness of the repair techniques. The results showed that fiber-reinforced polymers were active in strengthening for flexure as well as shear. It was also shown that over reinforcing in flexure resulted in shifting the failure to shear mode, which in some cases may be undesirable. Strengthening of a member in shear, on the other hand, resulted in increasing the ultimate displacement by more than tenfold, and toughness by a factor of more than 26. Available analytical procedures and building code provisions (ACI318-95) were found to simulate the behaviour of specimens retrofitted with fiber reinforced polymers reasonably well.

Bencardion et al. (2002) studied the strength and ductility of reinforced concrete beams externally reinforced with carbon fiber fabric. They presented results obtained from an experimental investigation of reinforced concrete beams strengthened in flexure and shear using externally bonded epoxy with bi-directional carbon fiber fabric. Two series of three large-scale concrete beam models were built and tested under four-point bending. The beams of the two series were internally reinforced with high-tensile steel for both shear and flexure. One beam for each series without external reinforcement was used as control beam. The difference between the two series was in the amount of internal stirrups and concrete strength. To study the effect of the external composite reinforcement, variations in the number of layers applied and in the external end arrangements were made. One type of external reinforcement consisted of two layers of fabric bonded to the tension face of the beam and partly extended up to the vertical sides.

15

The second arrangement consisted of four layers of fabric with supplementary end anchorages. The composite reinforcement led to an increase both in the load-carrying capacity at ultimate and flexural stiffness as compared to those for the control beams.

Tung and Campbell (2002) studied the ductility of pretensioned concrete beams with hybrid fiber reinforced polymer and stainless steel reinforcements. Naturally corrosion-resistant materials such as fibre reinforced polymer or stainless steel have been used to adder the corrosion problems in reinforced concrete structures. The authors investigated the behavior of pretensioned concrete beams containing a hybrid arrangement of prestressed carbon fiber reinforced polymer tendons and stainless steel bars. It was observed that conventional measures of ductility based on the yielding of reinforcement are not applicable to concrete beams with only fiber reinforced polymer because of the linearly elastic characteristic of fiber reinforced polymer up to failure. A proposed ductility index based on the consumed plastic and stored elastic energies has been adopted. The application of these energies requires knowledge of the complete loading and uploading load-deflection relationship of a beam. Five hybrid carbon fiber reinforced polymer and stainless steel concrete beams, with variable bonding pattern of carbon fiber reinforced polymer tendons, have been constructed and tested to obtain the complete load-deflection relationships and related ductility indices. Five pretensioned concrete beams with partially-bonded prestressed carbon fiber reinforced polymer tendons and non-prestressed stainless steel bars were constructed and tested to investigate the influence of the bonding pattern of the tendons on the loading and unloading behaviors, and hence on the deformability and ductility of the beams. As many

16

researchers have concluded, increasing unbonded tendon length improves the deformability of concrete beams. However, the current study showed that bonding pattern has an insignificant effect on the energy dissipation and hence on ductility of the beams.

2.3

History of Fiber Reinforced Polymers
The concept of FRP can be traced back to 3000 B. C., where ancient Egyptians

used straw to reinforce mud bricks. The first use of actual FRP was in the early 1950's in aerospace engineering. The materials lightweight, high strength, and stiffhess properties were a perfect fit for the industry. The first civil engineering application of FRP was in 1968. It was used on a dome structure built in Benghazi, Libya. Slowly other applications of the composite material followed. Fibre reinforced polymers are a class of materials that are referred to as composite materials. Composite materials (composites), consist of two or more materials that, when combined, retain their respective chemical and physical characteristics. Composites allow the properties of each material to be utilized to their greatest effect (Mair, 1999). These FRP composites offer the designer many properties (lightweight, ease of application, and high strength increase) that were not available in traditional materials. It is possible to introduce the fibres in the polymer matrix at highly stressed regions in a specific position, direction, and volume in order to obtain the maximum efficiency from the reinforcement within the member; Because of this, the reinforcement within the member can be reduced to a minimal amount at regions of low stress value. Furthermore, FRP's high strength-toweight ratio is of significant benefit. It has also been shown that FRP response to axial stress exhibit a linear elastic behavior (Chung, 2002). FRP has many positive qualities

17

some of which: it is resistant to corrosion, low construction costs, and greater efficiency in design compared with more conventional materials. However, like most structural materials, FRP has its disadvantages. These disadvantages have created uncertainty in the civil engineering/construction industry. Theses disadvantages include, brittle behaviour, susceptibility to deformation under long-term loading, UV degradation, photo degradation (from exposure to light), poor fire resistance, lack of design codes, and most importantly, lack of awareness (Chung, 2002).

2.4

Composition of FRP
The FRP system is comprised of several different parts. The main part of the

system is fibre reinforcement, which provides the strength to the system. The layer system that makes up the product placement is shown in Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1- CFRP System

18

2.4.1 Fibres Fibres provide tensile strength and stiffhess to the system and are the important constituents in FRP system. The fibre generally occupies 30-70 percent of the matrix volume in the composites and may be in the form of unidirectional strand, chopped strand mat, continuous roving or woven roving. A wide range of amorphous and crystalline materials can be used as the fibre in FRP. In the constructions industry, the most common used fibres are of glass and carbon, both increase strength and ductility in a structural member. Aramid fibres can be used instead of glass fibres to give increased stiffhess to the composite.

Carbon fibres can be divided into five grades: general purpose, high strength, ultra high strength, high modulus, and ultra high modulus. Carbon fibers increase compressive strength in a member by a greater percentage that any of the other fibers (see Figure 2-2). This is because the lateral strength developed due to the carbon fiber is much higher than that of glass. Exposure to wet-dry environments has little effect on the compressive strength and ductility of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP); whereas, exposure to ffeeze-thaw environments shows a significant degradation in strength and ductility of CFRP (Toutanji & Balaguru, 1998). It should also be noted that carbon fibers have a higher modulus of elasticity.

Glass fibres come in four types. E-glass, AR-glass, A-glass, and Class S high strength glass. The most common used in the construction industry are Class E and a

19

higher strength Class S. Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) also improves compressive strength, but not to the same degree as CFRP. Exposure to wet-dry, and fi-eeze-thaw environments show significant reduction in strength and ductility in GFRP (Toutanji & Balaguru, 1998). Figure 2.2 gives indication of the strength of these composite systems relative to conventional steel.

2.4.2 Epoxy Resins There are two main types of resin that are used for the application of FRP: thermoplastics and thermosets. Thermoplastics polymers are normally produced in one step and then made into products in a subsequent process. They become soft and

20

formable when heated, and can be formed and shaped in this soften state. When cooled significantly below their softening point they again become rigid. This type of polymer can be readily recycled because each time it is heated it can again be reshaped of formed into a new article. Thermoplastic resins that are used in composite manufacture include: polyolefins, polyamides, vinylic polymer, polyacetals, polysulphones, polycarbonates, polyphenylenes, and polyimides. Thermosetting polymers are normally produced and formed in the same step; because when heated thermosetting polymers will become soft, but they cannot be shaped or formed to any great extent. The types of thermosetting polymers that are used in the construction industry are polyesters and epoxides.

2.4.3 Protective Coatings Protective coatings are used to protect the FRP sheets from environmental factors. Factors that include: moisture, chlorine concentration, freezing, thawing, fire, and UV exposure. The reason for the application of protective coatings is the inadequacy of the fiber's to resist many of these factors, and the damage they may cause.

2.4.4 Fire Resistance of FRP Currently there are serious concerns associated with the behavior of FRP materials at high temperatures and thus reluctance to use this technology. In the past, the applications of FRP have been generally focused on bridges where fire resistance in not a major concern. Before accepting the use of FRP materials in buildings the properties of the material at high temperatures must be knows and able to be controlled. The many different types and combinations of FRP available make a general solution to fire

21

resistance very difficult to attain because different types of fibers have different properties and changes in matrix formulations can have large effects on the high temperature performance of the composite material. Most commonly used epoxies and polyesters from a matrix that is combustible and has mechanical properties, which decline due to even mild increases in temperature. The combustion of the polymer matrix may increase the flame spread and amount of smoke produced in a fire. The smoke produced by the epoxy matrix also has the potential to be toxic. Experiments have shown that a protective layer of intumescent latex added to the exterior of the FRP wrap has successfully yielded acceptable flame spread and smoke generation characteristics.

The increase in temperature due to fire causes a decrease in the mechanical properties of FRP due to the deterioration of the polymer matrix. This reduction in mechanical properties results in a loss of the composite action between the fibres and epoxy as well as a reduction in the bond strength between the FRP system and the underlying concrete member. The matrix will soften at temperatures between 65 and 150°C, which is the glass transition temperature (GTT) for the matrix. If the temperature increases beyond the GTT the strength and stiffhess of the epoxy resin are greatly reduced. This leads to the conclusion that any increase in strength or ductility achieved in the member due to the addition of externally bonded FRP would be lost suddenly during a fire if not protected and a dangerous situation could arise. Carbon fibers have good thermal resistance and have properties that are able to withstand temperatures in access of 1000°C. A reduction in the stress redistribution among fibers due to the failure of the resin at high temperatures significantly reduced the tensile properties of the overall FRP

22

system at high temperatures. In externally bonded FRP the resin is relied on to transfer the load from the member to the fibers. The loss of composite action between the concrete and FRP will occur at temperatures below 200°C, which are within 10 to 20°C of the GTT.

Based on the data currently available for the fire resistance of FRP general relationships have been derived for the effect of increased temperature on strength and ductility properties of externally bonded FRP. The relationships indicate that the increase in the strength obtained from FRP will be lost within 15-30 minutes of exposure to fire. The main areas of concern with FRP and fire are as follows: · · · Reduction in strength and stiffiiess due to the softening of the matrix. Loss of bond with the underlying concrete due to the softening of the matrix Increased heat generation increasing the temperatures locally around the member · Potential for spalling due to the entrapment of water inside the impermeable wrap

2.4.5 Application Procedure of CFRP The application of CFRP is one of the key aspects in its versatility. Arriving on the site as a dry flexible fabric, along with the resin, CFRP can be applied in a matter of hours. Its lightweight and ease of handling reduce labour costs significantly over traditional rehabilitation methods. The following is the step by step application procedure:

23

1. Structure preparation - Basic repairs must be made to the structure prior to strengthening. Spalled concrete removed, corroded or damaged steel addressed and major cracks injected. 2. Surface preparation - The surface to be repaired is typically abraded to smooth out irregularities, remove contaminants and radius sharp comers. This can be performed by sand blasting or grinding. 3. Prim er - In order to promote adhesion and prevent the surface from drawing resin from the FRP, a low viscosity epoxy primer is applied with a roller until the substrate is locally saturated. 4. Putty - An adhesive, high viscosity putty is applied when necessary to the surface to fill in `bug holes' offsets or voids. 5. Cutting fabric- In a clean area away from the resins, the fabric is carefully measured and cut in accordance with the specifications. 6. Saturating fabric - On large, high volume projects, the fabric can be saturated mechanically before application. For lower volumes & shorter strips, the fabric can be either saturated on a table, or the surface can be coated with resin and the dry fabric applied. 7. Applying fabric- The pre-wetted, or dry, fabric is carefully laid onto the surface and smoothed out to remove air bubbles and ensure that the fibers are straight. 8. Quality Control monitoring- During the cure, 2 to 6 hrs depending on ambient conditions, the fabric is checked to ensure that all air bubbles are removed and that the fabric is not sagging 9. Quality assurance- Good record keeping in accordance with manufacturers QA/QC

24

procedures ensures a successful finish product. 10. Top coat- Once cured and inspected, the system can be covered with any coating, for aesthetic blending and low maintenance protection.

3.3 Construction of Girder Supports
3.3.1 Site Preparation

Given the magnitude of the projeet an off-campus facility had to be used. Once a large enough facility was found, extensive work efforts were undertaken to adapt the bearing capacity of site to be able to adequately receive the added loads from the various equipment and materials that were required to complete the experiment. Please refer to figures 3.12 to 3.14 for a general rendering of such work.

Substrate Preparation

Before the CFRP application can start the concrete substrate must be grinded and or sandblasted to ensure that the interface between the epoxy resin and the concrete is free from any sharp edges and or voids. This procedure can be seen in Figure 3.25 below.

Figure 3.25- Substrate Preparation by Mechanical Grinding

3.4.3

Pre-existing Damage Repair

After grinding operations are complete, any voids and or damages are corrected with a high strength concrete patching compound so that a complete and full bonding surface area is available for the CFRP application.

3.4.4

Application of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Sheet

The installation procedure of the CFRP sheets is as follows; (i) making sure that the surface was free from sharp edges and voids in concrete bad to be filled, the comers

41

must be rounded, brooming the surface to make sure it is clean, placing a protective cover to keep the surrounding areas clean, (ii) mix 100 parts component A and 42 parts component B by volume, (iii) allowing the epoxy to soak into the concrete and become tacky by suing a roller, and (iv) applying the carbon fiber reinforced polymers so that it is smooth and uniform, and working out of bubbles. This procedure can be seen in Figure 3.26 below.

CFRP Arrangement of DT-41 Girder

DT-41 girder was strengthened in flexure and shear. The stems of two of the girder were strengthened in flexures using U-shape un-directional carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets (CFRP), extending fi-om the mid-span to the quarter points of the girders. Also, the dapped ends of girder stems were strengthened in shear using CFRP wrapping with fibers being oriented horizontally. While the part of the stem over the support is also strengthened with CFRP sheet with fibers being oriented vertically as shown in Figure 3.27. One layer of CFRP sheets was used in each direction of installation. Figures 3.28 to 3.34 show different views of the girder with CFRP sheets.

Instrumentation
The instrumentation used for these tests consisted of concrete strain gauges to

measure concrete strains and normal strain in CFRP sheets and Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LYDT's) to measure slab deflection.

3.6.1

Strain Gauge Application Concrete normal strains as well as strains in CFRP sheats at the mid-span section

were monitored using concrete strain gauges of 50 mm length. The strain gauges were glued at the predetermined locations on the specimens after the CFRP was applied. The contact surface was first cleaned with CSM-IA degreaser and rubbed with M-Prep conditioner A and left to dry, then the surface was rubbed again with M-Prep Neutralizer 5A. The adhesive used to attach the gauge was M-Bond 200. A total of concrete strain gauges per girder were installed at the mid-span section as shown in Figure 3.51. Other 6 strain gauges were installed over the CFRP sheets at 45° from the girder supports as shown in Figures 3.52 and 3.53. Figures 3.54 to 3.59 show the location of the strain gauges for each girder.

3.6 3.3 Loading using Jersey Barriers Loading of girders was carried out by the use concrete Barriers. These precast members are generally used to temporarily divert traffic during road construction works. Given that the precast members were all of the same cross section and length, we were able to accurately measure the dimensions of one barrier and use them incrementally. A check was also calculated by the crane's capacity gauge as it picked up each specimen. It was found that the barrier weight is 2200 kg. Figure 3.68 shows shows view of the loading procedure using the crane.

Experimental Results and Discussion
4.1 General
As part of a large project to investigate the use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Sheets to repair and strengthen damaged or deteriorated precast prestressed concrete Double-Tee (DT) girders in flexure and shear, this project details the strengthening and testing to-collapse three actual-size partially-damaged DT precast pretensioned girders as obtained from the precast manufacturer. All three of the girders were repaired and

strengthened, and then tested to failure to determine flexural and shear capacities. The stems of two of these girders were strengthened in flexures using U-shape un-directional carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets (CFRP), extending from the mid-span to the quarter points of the girders. Two girders were strengthened in shear the dapped ends using 0° wrapping technique around the stem, while the dapped ends of the third girder were strengthened using 0°/90° wrapping technique.

After testing the girders, two cores were taken for slab overhangs of each girder to determine concrete compressive strength experimentally. Table 4.1 summarizes the results from core tests against the design compressive strength of concrete as stated in the structural drawings. It should be noted that for a core diameter-to-height ratio of 1, the correction factor for compressive strength of concrete as obtained from core tests is 0.87 (ASTM, 1997). Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show views of core sampling and a core sample after failure, respectively.

Each girder was loaded incrementally up to failure using Jersey Barriers. Each barrier weights approximately 2200 kg and dimensions shown in Figure 4.3. Figures 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 show views of the girders before applying barrier weights. This Chapter summarizes crack propagation for each girder as well as the results from sensors as recorded by the data acquisition system. These results can be used in a further study to investigate the performance of CFRP sheet is shear and flexural strengthening.

Loading History and Crack Pattern
DT-41 Girder The stems of this girder was strengthened in flexure using U-shape un-directional

carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets (CFRP), extending from the mid-span to the quarter points of the girders. Also, the girder was strengthened in shear the dapped ends using 0° wrapping technique around the stem as detailed in Chapter HI. It was intended to strengthen this girder in flexure up to the quarter points and load it with barriers at its middle part between the quarter points to examine whether stopping CFRP sheets in flexure at a point within the girder span, rather than extending them to the supports, would affect the failure mode as well as the load carrying capacity. As such, the girder was loaded by concrete barriers in increments as shown in Figures 4.7 and 4.8. The total number of barriers used to load this girder is 13 as shown in Figure 4.7, in addition to barrier No. 14 after which the test stopped due to observed major wide shear-flexure cracks at the quarter points of each girder.

It should be noted that after applying the 10`* ' barrier, major shear-flexure cracks appeared at the ends of the CFRP sheets between the mid height of the girder and stem bottom face, approximately at the girder quarter points. This appears in views of the girder after failure in Figures 4.13 to 4.19. Delamination of CFRP and concrete was also observed at the ends of the CFRP sheets as shown in Figures 4.15, 4.16 and 4.20. The delamination mode of failure in CFRP strengthened girders is among the least understood and yet, its effect is not desirable from the design point of view because it is a brittle failure mode that can have catastrophic consequences.

Figure 4.21- Sketch of General Crack pattern of the DT-41 Girder

In addition to the major flexural-shear crack occurred at the ends of CFRP sheets glued to the girder stem, diagonal cracks were observed between this major crack and the mid span section, with irregular spacing ranging between 150 to 450 mm. Figures 4.13, 4.14, 4.17 and 4.19 show this crack pattern on each side of the double-tee girders. While Figure 4.21 shows a sketch of the general crack pattern after failure.

As it was mentioned in Chapter III, reading from sensors were recorded after applying each barrier weight. Table A.l shows deflection values at the mid-span section and at the support as obtained from the LVDTs. It can be observed that the maximum girder deflection at the mid-span section at failure was about 158 mm. While, insignificant deflection of the supports was observed, maximum of 2.14 mm after failure. This proves that settlement of the concrete foundation built over ground had insignificant effect on the LVDT readings at the mid-span section. Figure 4.12 shows view of the girder deflected shape after applying the 13*'' barrier. Tables A.4, A.7 and A. 10 show the strain gauge reading at the locations shown in Figure 3.51 and 3.53. These values will be used in further studies to compare the experimental findings with the analytical solution of such girders when strengthened using CFRP sheets.

4.2.2

DT-102A Girder The stems of this girder was strengthened in flexure using U-shape un-directional

carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets (CFRP), extending from the mid-span to the quarter points of the girders. Also, the girder was strengthened in shear the dapped ends using 0° /90° wrapping technique around the stem in two layers as detailed in Chapter HI. It was intended to strengthen this girder in flexure up to the quarter points and load it with barriers forming uniformly distributed load allover its length to examine whether stopping CFRP sheets in flexure at a point within the girder span, rather than extending them to the supports, would affect the failure mode as well as the load carrying capacity. As such, the girder was loaded by concrete barriers in increments as shown in Figures 4.22 and 4.23. The total number of barriers used to load this girder is 24 as shown in Figure 4.22. Figures 4.24,4.25 and 4.26 show views of the girder deflected shape during loaded it with barriers.

It was observed that crack were distributed almost uniformly between the mid span section and the supports, with cracks slopes decreasing towards the supports as a result of the effect of shear combined with flexure. In contrast to the failure mode in DT41 girder, no major flexural-shear was observed at the ends of the flexural CFRP sheets. This may be attributed to the fact that the applied barrier loading was uniformly distributed all over span. Figure 4.38 shows a sketch of the general crack pattern of DT102A girder.

As it was mentioned in Chapter III, reading from sensors were recorded after applying each barrier weight. Table A.2 shows deflection values at the mid-span section and at the support as obtained from the LVDTs. It can be observed that the maximum girder deflection at the mid-span section at failure was about 136 mm. While, insignificant deflection of the supports was observed, maximum of 4.48 mm after failure. This proves that settlement of the concrete foundation built over ground had insignificant effect on the LVDT readings at the mid-span section. Tables A.5, A.8 and A.l 1 show the strain gauge reading at the locations shown in Figure 3.51 and 3.53. These values will be used in further studies to compare the experimental findings with the analytical solution of such girders when strengthened using CFRP sheets.

4.2.3

DT-100 Girder

As a result of the level of deterioration shown in Chapter III, this girder was only strengthened in shear the dapped ends using 0°/90° wrapping technique around the stem in two layers as detailed in Chapter III. The girder was loaded by concrete barriers in

increments as shown in Figures 4.39 and 4.40, simulating a failure load with almost uniformly distributed loading. The total number of barriers used to load this girder is 12 as shown in Figure 4.39, however, more barriers were added to examine whether fracture of the prestressing strands would occur.

Figures 4.41 to 4.44 show views of the girder while applying the barrier weight. It should be noted that after applying the 8* barrier, major flexure cracks appeared at the mid-span section. These cracks are repeated towards the supports with increase of barrier loads. The failure of the girder was due to pure flexural crack. No sign of shear cracks were observed near the supports. Figures 4.45 and 4.46 show close-up of the flexural crack at the mid-span section after loading the girder with many barriers so that it rest over the ground. While Figure 4.47 shows view of crack pattern in the girder between the mid-span and the supports after removing the barriers. Figure 4.49 shows a sketch of the general crack pattern after failure with crack regularly spaced at 300 mm.

Readings from sensors were recorded after applying each barrier weight. Table A. 3 shows deflection values at the mid-span section and at the support as obtained from the LVDTs. It can be observed that the maximum girder deflection at the mid-span section after applying the 12* barrier was about 110 mm. While, insignificant deflection of the supports was observed, maximum of 0.34 mm after failure. This proves that settlement of the concrete foundation built over ground had insignificant effect on the LVDT readings at the mid-span section. Tables A.7, A.9 and A. 12 show the strain gauge reading at the locations shown in Figure 3.51 and 3.53. These values will be used in further studies to compare the experimental findings with the analytical solution of such girders when strengthened using CFRP sheets.

CHAPTER V

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
5.1 General
Research has been recently directed to the use of epoxy-bonding composite materials in strengthening deteriorated prestressed concrete girders. To ensure successful and costeffective applications of such materials, engineers need to improve their knowledge with respect to the actual behavior of full-size girders so that they can gain confidence on using these materials on structural strengthening and rehabilitation. This can be achieved by providing more data on testing to-collapse and on field conditions full-scale prestressed girders strengthened using FRP materials. This study details the use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Sheets to repair and strengthen precast prestressed concrete Double-Tee (DT) girders in flexure and shear. Three actual-size partially-damaged DT precast pretensioned girders were obtained from the manufacturer. All three of the girders were repaired and strengthened, and then tested to failure to determine flexural and shear capacities. The stems of two of these girders were strengthened in flexures using U-shape un-directional carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets (CFRP), extending from the mid-span to the quarter points of the girders. Two girders were strengthened in shear the dapped ends using 0° wrapping technique around the stem, while the dapped ends of the third girder were strengthened using 0790° wrapping technique. Each girder was loaded incrementally up to failure using Jersey Barriers. This project summarizes the loading history and reports test results that can be further used to demonstrate the practicality of girder strengthening with CFRP sheets in field conditions.

Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Research

The following are the conclusions and recommendations for future research resulting from this research. 1- Experimental results show that strengthening CFRP sheets in flexure for part of the girder span within the mid-span may triggers major flexural-shear crack at the ends of the CFRP sheets. Thus, it is recommended either to extend the flexural CFRP sheets to the supports to provide enough anchorage or to use local anchors at the ends of the CFRP sheets to prevent peeling.

2- Delamination mode of failure in CFRP strengthened girder was observed. Since it is a brittle failure mode that can cause catastrophic consequences, it is recommended that future work focus on developing a good understanding of the mechanisms governing this mode of failure. Such an understanding is crucial for the development of comprehensive design provisions for CFRP strengthened girder. 3- It should be noted that this project report is part of a large project to evaluate the use of CFRP sheets in rehabilitation of precast girders. As such, the recorded data from sensors, reported in Appendix A shall be used to compare the experimental findings with the analytical solution for the load history of such girders, using either strain compatibility method or the materially non-linear finite-element modeling.
