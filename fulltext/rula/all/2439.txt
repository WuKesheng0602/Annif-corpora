MODIFIED LOGISTICAL CREEP STRAIN PREDICTION METHOD
A CONSTITUTIVE CREEP STRAIN MODEL OF A NICKEL BASED SUPER-ALLOY MASTER OF APPLIED SCIENCE 2011 AMIR SEIF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING RYERSON UNIVERSITY

In turbine blade design, all three stages of creep are of concern. Moreover, for most commonly employed materials, creep rupture data is readily available where as long term creep strain data is not [1]. Recently, effort has been expended by many researchers in the development of material models incorporating all three stages of creep at varying stress and temperatures. Several developed models are complex or burdened by large numbers of material fitting constants. There is need for the development of a constitutive creep strain prediction formulation that is simplistic and requires minimal empirical data. In this thesis, the creep strain model proposed by Holmstrom et al., called the Logistic Creep Strain Prediction (LCSP) method was modified and used to model all three stages of creep of the well known nickel based super alloy Inconel 718 [1]. very attractive solution. The LCSP is robustness and accurate, and possesses a simplistic formulation ideal for algebraic manipulation and differentiation making it a

INTRODUCTION

RESEARCH MOTIVATION & GOALS

In the aviation industry gas turbines push their components to the very limit of their thermal capacity. The ever increasing demand on the design of engines with greater thermal performance has spurred a major need in the development of models expressing all three stages of creep. The first two stages of creep for design are no longer adequate. Since, long term creep strain data is not as common as long term rupture time data, a need for the development of constitutive creep strain models has been incited. Models that are capable of predicting long term creep strain data from short term experiments, with a simple formulation. This research was motivated by the need of a constitutive formulation that encompassed the entire creep strain curve at varying stress levels and temperatures. The criterions of the development effort focused on a simplistic formulation, encompassing all three creep stages, requiring minimal empirical data and containing a minimal number of material fitting parameters. The criterions are derived from what is termed the goals of applicability. The goals of applicability are concerned with the following qualities: Ease of application Cost of application Versatility

Ease of application was met by the simplistic formulation of the modified LCSP and the minimal number of material fitting constants. Cost of application is met by the fact that the model for Inconel 718 could be developed from whatever empirical data could be found from the literature. Versatility is met by the evidence that the material constants of the modified LCSP are connected to the mechanisms of creep rather than the specific material. The implied connection of the material fitting constants and the mechanisms of creep would reason that the proposed model can be easily applied to other similar materials. The modified LCSP presented in this thesis fills the need of a constitutive creep strain prediction model, encompassing all three stages of creep. The modified LCSP also has the potential of giving greater understanding of the mechanisms of creep through state variable type material constants due to the constraints applied to them. Since a vast majority of proposed constitutive models have yet to be widely accepted or standardized through batteries of benchmarking exercises, most commercial Finite Element Method (FEM) software packages do not include full creep strain curve modeling in the default instillation. Most FEM packages such as

ANSYS or ABACAS offer the user the ability to customize a user defined subroutine. In this research, the modified LCSP will be written into an ANSYS User-Programmable Feature (UPF). The user subroutine is an example of the modified LCSPs easy application and versatility. The UPF is discussed in greater detail in  Chapter 3, section  3.1. 1.2 THE CONCEPT OF CREEP

The advancement of technology and the need for stronger materials for high temperature applications has driven researchers to study material behaviour at high temperature. Moreover, the need to understand the critical modes of failure at high temperature and the ability to predict failure is at the forefront of many engineering problems. A long standing interest has existed in creep phenomenon and its initial observation is obscured in the pages of human history. If someone were to try pinpointing a time in history as the beginning of major interest in the analysis of creep, one might choose the work of French engineer L. J. Vicat in 1834 as a beginning. Vicats primary interest was in the application of wire for load-carrying members in suspension bridges. His observations lied within what is now accepted as the primary creep stage of the creep curve (Figure 1) [2]. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Phillips (1905) and Andrade (1910) introduced the concept of the full creep curve with the creep curves for iron and several other materials. Creep phenomenon is broken up into three stages, namely primary, secondary and tertiary. The three stages correspond to a decreasing, constant and increasing strain rate respectively. A typical creep strain versus time curve is presented in Figure 1.

2

Figure 1 is a typical metal creep curve, displaying all three stages [2] Since the achievements of Phillips and Andrade, the reminder of the twentieth century to the present is littered with the work of many in the study of creep behaviour. The insurgence of the industrial revolution required machinery that could operate at high temperatures for greater thermal efficiency. The advancements in aircraft technologies during the two Great World Wars required engine components that could handle greater temperatures as humanity moved into the jet age. During the late 1950s to the 1960s interest in nuclear power generation peaked another great surge in interest in the studies of creep analysis [2]. At present, there is great interest in creep modeling that incorporates all three stages of creep in a single unified model. This interest is driven by the demands of turbo-machinery technology which is found in both aircraft and power generation industries. Many researchers have developed and studied a plethora of modeling techniques, some of which will be discussed in the literature survey. The remainder of this introduction is intended as a summary of the twentieth century equations and models describing individual creep stages or multiple stages at once. A literal description of the mechanisms and mechanics of the creep phenomenon will also be presented. There will, however, be little or no effort to present a detailed derivation of any equations in this section. This section is merely intended to introduce the concept and is in no way exhaustive. The equations presented in this section are intended to give an awareness of some of the commonly accepted fundamental
3

mathematical relations of the various stages of creep. Detailed derivation is left to the literature survey section detailing full creep curve modeling techniques, the primary interest of this thesis. Since the creep phenomenon is a complex material behaviour, its analysis is often based on curvefitting of experimental creep data. Typically, an effort is made to describe creep strain strain rate or creep as a function of stress , temperature T, and time . The relations and models

producing constitutive equations are most commonly derived by one of three methods [2; 3], Phenomenological (macroscopic, empirical): Derivation of empirical formulas that model experimental data Physical (microscopic): Derivation of equations based on metallurgical creep mechanisms Physical-Phenomenological (micro-macroscopic): As its name implies these types of equations combine the first two types. These formulations are dominated by state variables representing prevailing creep mechanisms. Table 7 is duplicated in APPENDIX A: Tables AND CHARTS from Advance Mechanics of Materials of empirical one-dimensional creep formulas [2]. Table 7 is a good summary of the generally accepted equations and concepts developed over the twentieth century. The proceeding sections of the introduction will briefly give a literal description of the mechanisms controlling the different stages of creep. The literal description will be followed by a discussion of some of the basic mathematical relations describing the stage. First the Primary/Secondary stages will be discussed as they are similar in mechanism. Finally, the introduction will finish off with a discussion on the tertiary creep stage. 1.3 PRIMARY/SECONDARY CREEP

Dislocation creep theory is based on the principle of crystallographic dislocation of a materials atoms arranged in a crystal structure or lattice. The atoms dislocate by means of gliding along their slip planes, but are not restricted to glide only. The atoms can climb, meaning they are not forced to only move along their slip planes. Dislocation theory is the premise that a material is hardened with deformation and softened with time [3]. The primary and secondary creep stages are characterized by this process of simultaneous hardening and softening. The concept was first coined by Bailey and Orowan.

4

At high temperatures roughly one-third of the absolute material melting temperature, dislocations obtain a new degree of freedom. This degree of freedom is climb. The climb mechanism allows for the gradual freeing of dislocations previously created by increasing strain. The strain dependent dislocation or glide dislocation can be halted by obstacles such as other dislocations or second-phase particles. The dislocation is said to recover if it undergoes a climb mechanism, releasing the dislocation to slide to the next obstacle. The glide mechanism is the principal creep mechanism of the primary stage. The glide-climb mechanism is dubbed the hardening-recovery mechanism. Hardening is the process of the dislocation being restrained by an obstacle and recovery is the freeing of the dislocation by climb. Empirical evidence would suggest the dislocations are arranged in a network. Creep consists of continuous events of recovery and hardening within this network. Network consistency is ensured by the repulsive and attractive forces among the dislocations. The stress and high temperature subjected dislocations lengthen and therefore increase in density. This causes strain and hardening to increase. At the initiation of the stress the glide mechanism is predominate such that there is initially a large number of loosely connected dislocations. This results in a high initial creep strain rate. Eventually, the number of loosely held dislocations is reduced over time which gives the primary stages characteristic decreasing strain rate (hardening). The decreasing strain rate or hardening process is countered by the recovery mechanism (softening). The climb trend is increasing with increasing dislocation density over time. Finally, equilibrium is achieved by both mechanisms of hardening and softening. The effect is a steady state creep rate or the beginning of the secondary creep stage. The objective of mathematical descriptions of material phenomenon is to accurately relate empirically determined values of creep strain, stress, temperature and time. efforts have been centered to the fitting of single portions of the creep curve. The primary creep stage, characterized by a monotonic decrease in creep strain rate, strain  can be described simplistically by the time-hardening-theory.

mathematical relation can take the form of a single equation or a system of equations. Historically,

and m are temperature dependent material constants determined from uni-axial stress creep tests.

Furthermore, differentiating Equation  1.1 with respect to time (t), the creep rate determined as,

can be

Equation  1.2

If time is substituted from Equation  1.1 into Equation  1.2, we get the relation,
Equation  1.3

Equation  1.3 is referred to as the strain-hardening-theory [4]. Both time-hardening and strain-hardening theories are default models provided in Ansys mechanical modeling software. Among the two theories mentioned above, Generalized Exponential, Generalized Graham, Generalized Blackburn, Modified Time-Hardening, and Modified StrainHardening are the available default primary creep models available in Ansys 12 Finite Element Method (FEM) software package. Secondary stage creep is similar in behaviour to pure plastic behaviour. Moreover, creep

deformations "of metals will usually be uninfluenced if a hydrostatic pressure is superimposed" [4]. A similar behaviour observed of pure plastic deformations and, as such, creep can be described by methods employing the mathematical theories of plasticity. The secondary stage can also be described by its characteristic constant strain rate, at constant stress level and temperature. For uni-axial tensile tests all at the same temperature but different stress levels, the constant creep strain rate of the secondary stage can be described as a function of the stress level  [2 p. 635]:
Equation  1.4

Equation  1.4 ignores primary and tertiary stages and is only applicable to situations when a component exhibits a curve that appears dominated by a secondary creep stage. In this instance creep strain is approximated by straight lines such as those in Figure 2.

6

Figure 2 illustrates the type of curve Equation  1.4 produces [2] Models employing formulations such as Equation  1.4 are termed steady-state creep models. Equation  1.3 or the strain-hardening-theory can be used to model both primary and secondary stages together. Available default creep models in Ansys 12 are, Generalized Garofalo, Exponential Form, or Norton. 1.4 TERTIARY CREEP

The final stage of creep before rupture is the tertiary stage. This stage is characterized by an exponentially increasing creep strain rate. The increasing strain rate is related to the damage accumulation within the internal crystalline structure of the material. The dislocation mechanisms of the primary/secondary stages cause cavities (microscopic cracks) on the grain boundaries. These cavities are initially small and have negligible effect on the strain rate. However, with increasing time and creep strain the cracks grow and meet to form larger cavities. Eventually, the growing creep damage becomes a prominent factor in the behaviour of the strain rate. It is at this point the characteristic exponentially increasing strain rate of the tertiary stage can be observed [3; 4]. Other forms of damage may arise such as void formation from a certain stress history. Less certain, but still of interest is the effect of oxidation on or below the surface causing microscopic cavities [3]. Hence, was born an interest and study of damage mechanics and specifically continuum damage mechanics (CDM) methods. However, there has been little benchmarking to date on CDM methods and therefore it is often difficult to "establish the accuracy of the numerical formulations"

7

[5]. Since it is difficult to establish the accuracy of such methods, commercial general-purpose Finite Element (FE) codes leave it to the individual users to incorporate in-house FE codes. Among some of the modeling methods explored in this paper are Theta-Projection, Omega, and Typical Katchanov-Robotnov (CDM) and Logistic Creep Strain Prediction methods. damage mechanics Methods. The descriptions of the methods are left to the section within the literature survey entitled continuum

CHAPTER 2

LITERATURE SURVEY

Initially, the literature survey served to familiarize the author with not only previously proposed creep models encompassing the entire creep strain curve, but also the mechanics and basic mathematical relations of the creep phenomenon. It became apparent at the beginning of this study that the subject of creep was immense and that a focus was going to be required. A literature survey that encompassed a review of the major historical mathematical relations developed in twentieth century would be a task in itself. The primary goal of this research project is the development of a procedural method in modeling a materials entire creep strain evolutionary curve. This was to be done by choosing an appropriate existing creep model that fits the development criterions outlined previously. As a consequence this literature review reflects the main formulations of interest that were considered for use in this thesis. 2.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

There has been a great deal of interest within the past century in the study of creep behaviour and development of modelling techniques. Arguably the first researcher to introduce the concept of the creep strain curve with all three stages as it is known today was Andrade [6]. Initially, many scientists approached the analysis of creep modeling within its individual stages. One of the most well known formulations is the Norton-Bailey relation:
Equation  2.1

Where

and

are material constants and R, T and

are the global constant, absolute temperature

and applied constant stress respectively. However, as remarked by Batsoulas, "the use of this relation in the design means that (i) the creep curve is a straight line, (ii) the initial and tertiary creep are neglected, and (iii) the rate of secondary creep, (and the creep life, ) is, essentially defined as the exclusive designing parameter"[3]. As might be imagined this is simply unacceptable in most, if not all serious creep analysis of modern components. The majority of relations developed early in this century till relatively recently have tackled one or two stages of the creep and not the entire curve. Batsoulas lists several of these concerning the first and second creep stages. Herein, only a few representing some of the more well known relations will be reproduced. Andrades Relation

Andrade, Nabarro, Garofalo and many other notable scientists are found in the literature for their contributions to the understanding of creep. As some of their postulated relations became accepted researchers of the present are modifying the old to create more robust and accurate all encompassing relations. Some of the relations accepted as fundamental formulations are found in popular Finite Element Method (FEM) software packages such as a generalized Garofalo relation in ANSYS 12. Recently, there have been efforts by some researchers to compile and provide benchmarks of some of the past proposed creep strain models [3; 7; 8]. Figure 3 is a table taken from the European Creep Collaborative Committees (ECCC) publication entitled, Recommendations and Guidance for the Assessment of Creep Strain and Creep Strength Data [8; 9]. The table is a modest compilation of models most commonly used by organizations currently active in the ECCC.

Figure 3 P ­ Primary, S ­ Secondary, T ­ Tertiary creep stages. In the past two or three decades, a shift was made to model the creep curve in its entirety. Either, it was to be modelled by macroscopic phenomenological curve fitting techniques, or continuum damage mechanics (CDM) approaches incorporating state variables corresponding to the dominant physical procedures of damage [3]. Three methods listed in Figure 3 were of particularly interest, the Rabotnov-Kachanov, Theta and Omega models. Additionally, one other model is presented and described in addition to the aforementioned methods. The Logistic Creep Strain Prediction (LCSP) model developed by Holmstrom and Auerkari is the final model studied in this paper. The LCSP model is a phenomenological model or a non-linear asymmetric transition function with regulated steepness, as described by its authors [10]. A detailed description of the Rabotnov-Kachanov, Theta, Omega and LCSP models is provided in the ensuing subsections of the literature survey.

2.2

RABOTNOV-KACHANOV METHOD

Kachanov has been dubbed the founder and developer of classical Continuum Damage Mechanics or CDM as it is referred to. His original work has been revised and adapted by many researchers with considerable success to many applications [3; 7; 11; 12; 13]. Initially, Kachanov introduced the concept of CDM for the case of creep damage [13]. His initial concept took the form,
Equation  2.5

He

represented the accumulation of damage as the loss in material cross-section, due to cavitation [14].

is Kachanovs damage parameter he called the ,,continuity. The state variable ,,continuity is defined as the ratio of the remaining effective area ( ) to the initial area ( ). This continuity state variable could be taken a step further to relate to initial stress ( ) and effective stress ( ) as,
Equation  2.6

In Equation  2.6, the effective stress is increasing due to increasing damage or decreasing effective area ( ). Later Rabotnov would modify Kachanovs state variable ,,continuity concept with the damage parameter . The new damage parameter is defined as,
Equation  2.7

Equation  2.6 can be re-written to reflect Rabotnovs modification as,
Equation  2.8

Eventually, with the combined effort of Kachanov, Rabotnov, and Hayhurst and co-workers, the damage rate ( ) would be expressed in terms of applied stress and current state of damage ( ) as,
Equation  2.9

The constants , , and using the conditions that

are material constants. Two more fundamental equations can be derived at , at ( is time and is time to failure).

Integrating Equation  2.9 using the conditions described above gives,
Equation  2.10

Finally, the instantaneous damage state can be derived as,
Equation  2.11

12

In 1958 Kachanov proposed a modified Nortons creep rate equation utilizing his effective stress for the applied stress used in the original Nortons equation [14]. The modified Nortons steady state creep rate equation took the form,
Equation  2.12

Equation  2.12 is suitable for uni-axial secondary/tertiary creep modeling. A commonly used single-state variable constitutive multi-axial stress equation based on the original Kachanov type equation takes the form [12],
Equation  2.13

Here,

and

are the deviatoric and equivalent stresses respectively and

,

and

are material

constants. Researchers such as Hyde, Becker, Sun and many others have found success in a variety of applications employing Kachanov adaptations such as Equation  2.13 in their work [12]. Accompanying Equation  2.13 is the rate of change of the damage parameter which takes the form [7],
Equation  2.14

Where

,

and

are continuum damage material constants. In Equation  2.14,

is a rupture

stress that can be calculated by [7],
Equation  2.15

In Equation  2.15

is a material constant that ranges from 1 (maximum first principle stress

dominant) to 0 (equivalent or Von Mises stress dominant) [7]. Equation  2.13 to Equation  2.15 can be applied to multi-axial stress cases that lie primarily in the secondary/ tertiary creep stages. The equations can be modified to incorporate the primary creep stage [7]. As it stands, the Kachanov based equations  2.13 to  2.15 have a total of 9 material constants. This formulation does not even include the primary creep region. The Kachanov style formulation represented in this section was eliminated during the selection process on several accounts. The number of material constants required implies the need for a great deal of material data for accurate modeling of creep strain curve family. The model would not be easily integrated into a FEM software package. It was concluded that a Kachanov style model would
13

not best achieve the development criterions of the proposed constitutive modeling procedural method. 2.3 THETA  PROJECTION METHOD

The Theta Projection (TP) method is a parametric method used to obtain approximations of longterm creep strain or time data from short term experimental creep data [15]. The TP method is one that has gained some favour among researchers as a promising constitutive creep formulation. The TP method expresses creep strain evolution with respect to time in the form,
Equation  2.16

Where

is creep strain,

is time to specific creep strain,

terms are experimentally determined

material constants [16].

The method attempts to perform two functions, empirically fitting

experimental strain-time data and provide insight into the processes characteristic of creep damage mechanics [16]. Though this method is not explicitly a CDM approach, it does however have similar attributes as it relies on the failure mechanisms of both primary and tertiary creep. The first group of terms in Equation  2.16 models the primary stage and the second group of terms models tertiary. Any constant secondary creep stage is considered an inflection in the curve. In other word, the first group is representative of the primary stages characteristic hardening process. The second group is representative of the tertiary stages mechanism of accumulated damage or softening. The balancing of the two groups of terms results in an equilibrium being achieved. This equilibrium is representative of the secondary stage. Furthermore, though the TP method does not contain any damage parameter, it is reminiscent of the Kachanov damage state variable concept. The creep strain rate can be defined by differentiating Equation  2.16 to give,
Equation  2.17

The theta

terms can be expressed as functions of applied constant stress

and temperature

as,

Equation  2.18

The theta terms vary approximately linearly with respect to stress and temperature [16]. It has been shown that the TP method is capable of predicting creep rupture strains as a function of stress and temperature.
Equation  2.19

The TP method is a favourable creep strain evolution formulation. It has become more widely used as its advantage and flexibility have become appreciated [3; 15; 16; 17]. Despite the fewer number of
14

material constants than a Kachanov style CDM method, there still exists a modeling formulation incorporating some well established relations with fewer material constants. Moreover, the TP method appears more dependent on empirical data to accurately model a family of creep curves. It was believed that the TP method would be dependent on the number of points defining a single curve of a family of curves in order to adequately model its shape. Furthermore, several curves at multiple conditions would be required with a great deal of data to extrapolate/interpolate other curves within that same family of curves. It was concluded that a model with even fewer material constants was required and a model that could utilize master curve data such as the Larson-Miller relation to specified creep strains and creep rupture time. For the abovementioned reasons, the TP method was eliminated as the modeling choice.

2.4

OMEGA () METHOD

Developed by the Materials Properties Council (MPC) and presented by Prager, the MPC Omega method is founded on the premise that the current creep strain rate along with a brief history of creep strain rates is adequate to predict past and future creep behaviour of a component [12]. The MPC Omega () method has received some interest from several researchers [12; 18]. The  method relies on the premise that a materials ability to resist a given stress decreases with increasing creep damage. Creep strain rate is therefore defined by,
Equation  2.20

Where

is the imaginary initial creep strain rate,

is creep strain (at some time),

is the omega

material parameter. A small primary creep region results in a strain rate (secondary creep stage).

that is near the minimum creep

The factor material parameter omega is implicitly a function of stress, mechanical damage and micro-structural changes [18]. Integrating Equation  2.20 with respect to time gives a relation with strain and time t.
Equation  2.21

Finally, at large values of as [18],

, such as those at creep rupture. The value of the exponential term in can be approximated

Equation  2.21 can be considered negligible. Moreover, creep rupture time

Equation  2.22

The imaginary initial strain rate

and omega

parameters are stress and temperature dependent.

The determination of the appropriate fitting function that relates stress and temperature for either parameter is material dependent (i.e. polynomial, exponential). For instance, Jong-Taek Yeom et al. initially chose an exponential power law to express the material parameter with respect to stress and temperature. It was found that the developed power law expressions did not fit the material parameters accurately, and a hyperbolic sine formulation was used to describe imaginary initial strain rate and omega parameters as functions of stress and temperature [18]. method appeared very promising. However, of concern was the fact that

dependent. This would be a serious disadvantage when trying to develop a creep model that can be somewhat standardized for multiple materials for application in a user-defined creep model in a FEM software package. The number of constants and the accuracy of the MPC model are not in question, but the concern over curve fitting issues even among similar materials disqualified this model as a choice for the development of the proposed constitutive creep strain procedural method. 2.5 LOGISTIC CREEP STRAIN PREDICTION (LCSP) METHOD

The Logistic Creep Strain Prediction (LCSP) model, developed by Holmstrom and Auerkari, is a logistic non-linear asymmetric transition function that fits logarithmic strain versus time in its basic form. The LCSP model relies on time to rupture to control the end point of each curve. Time to rupture can be provided via true data or master curve predicted data such as that predicted by a Larson-Miller relation. The formulation of the LCSP provides three parameters for data fitting each curve or curve family ( , , ). A unique feature of the LCSP formulation is that strain as a to specified logarithmic strain at function of time and strain rate as a function of time can all be determined algebraically. The equation of the LCSP is described as logarithmic time engineering stress and temperature as [10],
Equation  2.23

Where

is the time to rupture and

, ,

and

are fitting factors. In its simplest form the fitting

factors are found to be constants. However, typically some of the fitting factors will be a function of stress and temperature. Equation  2.23 can be re-written algebraically to describe strain as a function of time as,
Equation  2.24

Where,
Equation  2.25

It should be noted, equations  2.23 -  2.25 implies that at strain assuming necessary [10]. . The variable

the time to rupture is attained,

can be used to correct the strain at time to rupture to correspond

to the actual creep ductility. For most creep ductile materials, however, this is most likely not

17

Moreover, differentiating Equation  2.25 with respect to time gives the algebraic expression for creep strain rate as,
Equation  2.26

Where is determined by Equation  2.24, and
Equation  2.27

And
Equation  2.28

The LCSP method is attractive for several reasons. First, if we assume

the model is reduced

to a total of three fitting material constants that can be determined by a minimal amount of actual data or master curve data. Furthermore, the formulation is easily manipulated algebraically from one form to another, which is ideal for characterizing creep in terms of creep strain or creep strain rate. The LCSPs robust and simplistic nature made it the ideal constitutive model for application in this research.

THEORY & APPLICATION

ANSYS USER-PROGRAMMABLE FEATURES

ANSYS provides thirteen creep formulations for implicit analysis. The Norton law and Blackburn model are examples of the models available in ANSYS implicit creep analysis [19]. Despite the many included implicit creep analysis tools, some users may wish to use a customized creep equation that has already been validated through testing. Or perhaps, the application of a damage parameter is required for a certain application. The creep laws that come preinstalled assume creep is to be used in design rather than failure analysis and as a consequence the available creep laws are meant to model primary and secondary creep only. In order to surmount this limitation ANSYS provides a means of allowing the user the ability to customize a user defined creep subroutine via ANSYS User-Programmable Features (UPF). Since, ANSYS has an open architecture it allows the user to write their own routines or subroutines in C or FORTRAN. The routines or subroutines can either be linked to ANSYS or used externally as commands [20]. Therefore, using UPFs the user can tailor the ANSYS program to their specific needs. The UPF of particular interest in this research is the usercreep.F subroutine. The usercreep

subroutine is activated by "the TB command with the CREEP option and with TBOPT =100" [20]. For the usercreep subroutine, a uniaxial creep law can be used which will be generalized to the multi-axial state by the general time-dependent viscoplasticity material formulation implemented in ANSYS. The original ANSYS instillation provides a usercreep.F file, as source code based on the strain hardening law TBOPT = 1 [19]. The usercreep.F source code provided with the original installation is reproduced in Appendix B, Source Code 1. Available variables for use in the subroutine are effective creep strain or time, effective stress, and temperature. Also available is hydrostatic pressure [19]. The TBDATA command used in creating a material model input file is used to input the creep material constants right after the TB, CREEP, , , ,100 command is given. Other temperature dependent material properties such as Modulus of Elasticity are also input in this way. For specifics on material property input, the user manuals provided with the ANSYS installation can be reviewed. Moreover, an example of a material property input file is provided in Appendix B, Source Code 3.
19

Three outputs are required by ANSYS for the calculation of creep strain from the subroutine. First, the incremental creep strain designated ,,delcr is required. The last two outputs required are, "the derivatives of the incremental creep strain with respect to effective stress and creep strain, which are dcrda(1) and dcrda(2), respectively" [19]. It is crucial that these derivatives are calculated correctly as ANSYS requires them to calculate the material tangent stiffness matrix. Miscalculating the derivatives can negatively impact the convergence behaviour and accuracy of the subroutine. In the case that the model to be used is complex and the derivative cannot be evaluated directly, it is suggested that numerical differentiation be used [19]. Therefore from first principles, dcrda(1) would take the form,
Equation  3.1

The value of stress increment (

) is a very small arbitrarily chosen number that may require ) in place of stress increment.

adjustment to achieve acceptable accuracy. The value of dcrda(2) would take a similar form to Equation  3.1 with creep strain increment (

ANSYS UPF usercreep.F subroutine was implemented using the LCSP method as the means of constructing and analysing creep material properties of all three stages of the creep strain curve of Inconel 718. The derivation of the equations used in the source code which is reproduced in Appendix B, Source Code 2, will be covered in the next section entitled LCSP. The specific equations used to calculate the values of incremental creep strain, dcrda(1) and dcrda(2) are derived in the next section. 3.2 LCSP LIMITS & CONSTRAINTS

Upon careful observation of the original LCSP formulation, two limitations can be identified. The original LCSP formulation, time to specified strain is reiterated below for convenience.
Equation  2.23

The condition of creep strain ( ) equal to zero, would imply time to specified strain ( ) is also zero. However, if zero is subbed into the left side of Equation  2.23, a complex value results. In order to avoid the calculation of a complex value, a value of one is added to each value of time to specified strain such that Equation  2.23 can be re-written as,

20

Equation  3.2

Although, typically researchers and engineers are not concerned with cases where rupture time is zero, for completeness the same logic was applied to rupture time ( ) and Equation  3.2 is re-written to take the form,
Equation  3.3

The final constraint of the original LCSP involves the denominator of the right side of Equation 2.23. It is possible to calculate a complex value in the denominator in two situations. In both cases  the value of the material constant p, which is fractional, has an even denominator (eg. If p = 3.5 = 7/2). A complex value will be calculated if is negative which will result from any creep strain can produce a complex value value less than 1. Finally, a negative value of the material constant strain such that Equation  3.3 is further modified to give,
Equation  3.4

in the denominator of Equation  2.23. Therefore, a value of one is added to each value of creep

Furthermore, to avoid the calculation of a complex value or infinity a lower limit is imposed on the material constant , specifically,
Equation  3.5

In this research, MATLAB software and FORTRAN are used as a mathematical computer aid and programming language of the subroutine respectively. In both software packages the command log is the natural logarithm (ln). Therefore, all logarithms of the LCSP are interpreted as natural logarithms. This was done primarily for aesthetic purposes of the programming of any m code or FORTRAN programming. Finally, the LCSP method was developed with the fitting of creep strain as a percent, but ANSYS calculates strain as a fraction. Therefore, fractional strain is multiplied by one hundred percent and Equation  3.4 takes its finally form as,
Equation  3.6

21

In its final modified form (Equation  3.6), creep strain ( ), is interpreted as fractional strain. Moreover, Equation  3.6 can be algebraically rearranged for creep strain as,
Equation  3.7

Where LTF is now,
Equation  3.8

The creep strain rate is found by taking the derivative of Equation  3.7 with respect to time, which follows,
Equation  3.9

In Equation  3.9 creep strain can be calculated via Equation  3.7 and k1 and k2 are,
Equation  3.10

And,
Equation  3.11

3.3

LCSP USER-DEFINED CREEP EQUATIONS

As mentioned previously, ANSYS requires three outputs from the user subroutine for analysis. The first of these outputs is incremental creep strain or delcr, which from Equation  3.9 takes the form,
Equation  3.12

Here

is incremental time, which in ANSYS is the sub-step time size. The last two outputs are the

derivatives of incremental creep strain with respect to stress and strain. It is apparent that the evaluation of the derivatives would be complex and therefore it was decided that numerical differentiation would be employed. The numerical differentiation of incremental creep strain with respect to stress, dcrda(1), is defined by Equation  3.1. Since creep strain in Equation  3.12 can be replaced by Equation  3.7 which implies that Equation  3.12 is a function of stress and temperature solely. Therefore, the derivative of incremental creep strain with respect to creep strain, dcrda(2), is equal to zero. Equations  3.1,  3.12 and the fact that dcrda(2) is equal to zero are the three required output of the ANSYS usercreep

22

subroutine that was compiled and linked into ANSYS. APPENDIX B: ANSYS Source Code .

CHAPTER 4

PROCEDURE

The procedure of the proposed constitutive creep strain modeling method involved several steps. They are listed and discussed in order within this chapter under their respective subchapters. This chapter includes the following subchapters, Material Data Collection Creep Strain Curve Fitting FORTRAN Compiling and Linking CATIA V5 Geometry Creation Workbench Meshing APDL Creep Analysis Input Files 4.1 MATERIAL DATA COLLECTION

The proposed model was to be based on creep strain and rupture data that could be found in the literature. As a starting point, the Aerospace Structural Metals Handbook was consulted for a commonly used material in Turbine Blade design. A well know nickel based super alloy employed in Turbo-Machinery, Inconel 718 (IN718), was found to be well documented [21]. Data was collected for IN718 under the following heat treatment [21; 18]: Annealing for 1 hour at 1750°F - 1800°F then air cooled Two Step aging treatment   8 hours at 1325°F then furnace cooled to 1150°F at 100-108°F/hour Held at 1150°F for an additional 8 hours and finally air cooled

The above heat treatment is the most commonly used treatment procedure with regards to optimum creep properties [22]. Creep strain data was digitized from creep curves presented by Yeom et al [18]. Modulus of Elasticity was taken from the High Temp Metals Inc website and poisons ratio was taken from the Aerospace Structural Metals Handbook [21; 23]. OriginPro 8 SRO v8.0724 was used to digitize all required data which is then output to text files by the program. The text files can then be read into Excel. Figure 4 is the illustrated original creep strain curves taken [18] from Yeom et al for IN718 [18]. The digitized data points for the Creep Strain Curves are provided in APPENDIX A: Tables AND CHARTS , Figure 20.

The LCSP is fitted in the form of time as a function of the creep strain (Equation  3.6). Three material constants result from each stress/temperature case. MATLAB Version 7.10.0.499 64-bit (win64) was used for all curve fitting procedures. The MATLAB curve fitting tool uses x and y data in the form of,
Equation  4.1

In order to use Equation  3.6 within the MATLAB curve fitting tool graphical user interface (GUI), the equation was re-written as,
Equation  4.2

Where,
Equation  4.3

And,
Equation  4.4

Values of x and y were calculated using the digitized creep strain and corresponding time data (APPENDIX A: Tables AND CHARTS
26

, Figure 20) in Excel. Since the creep strain data is to rupture, the last time data point was taken to be the rupture time of each curve. The x and y data for each creep curve at specified stress and temperature was read into MATLAB from Excel and the curve fitting tool was opened in MATLAB with the command ,,cftool. Data is selected within the Data tab of the cftool GUI. From the ,,Data tab the x and y data was loaded from the MATLAB workspace where data was earlier read from excel. Next, fit options and the data to be fitted are selected. The specific options chosen in the ,,Fit Editor accessed through the fitting button are as follow, Select new fit Populate fit name in the ,,Fit name field Selected desired data from the ,,Data set drop down menu Custom Equations is selected from the drop down menu of ,,Type of fit Under Custom Equations, the ,,New button is selected to create new custom equation In the ,,New Custom Equations window under ,,General Equations tab right side of Equation 4.2 is input into the field to the right of the equal sign, the appropriate rupture time was subbed in and then ok was selected. Back in the Fit Editor, ,,Fit options button is pressed and the following options are selected in the ,,Fit Options window:    Robust: Off Algorithm: Trust-Region Lower: 0

Each creep curve at specified temperature and stress is fitted using the steps and options listed above. Once all creep curves where created, m-code representing the fitting of all the curves was generated by selecting the Generate M-file option from the file drop down menu in the ,,Curve Fitting Tool window. This serves three purposes, Document the fitting procedure Incorporate generated m-function into Excel data reading m-code Saves fitting information in a MATLAB Structure Array that can be retrieved for further use

The generated code for curve fitting is modified slightly to output structural arrays containing the goodness of the fit (R-squared value) and the values of the three material constants of each
27

respective creep strain curve. The m-code reading and writing the Excel data and the generated modified curve fitting m-function is reproduced in APPENDIX C: MATLAB SOURCE CODE , Source Code 5 and Source Code 6 respectively. The next phase of curve fitting was done to fit relations to the material constants as functions of stress level. Temperature dependence was accounted for by determining the relations as a function of stress level at a particular temperature. Similar procedure was followed for the fitting of the material constants versus stress level at specified temperature as the curve fitting procedure of the creep strain curves. In the case of the material constant fitting, the material constants were the y values and their corresponding stress level was the x values. The values of x and y were again read in from Excel. The values of the material constants (x) are the values that had just been written in by MATLAB from the first curve fitting procedure of the creep strain curves. Also, curve fitted was a relation describing the Larson-Miller Parameter versus logarithmic stress level. The Larson-Miller Parameter relation is used in the user defined creep subroutine to calculate rupture time. The Larson-Miller Parameter (LMP) is defined as,
Equation  4.5

Where T is temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and stress is in kilo-pound per square inch (ksi). The value of C is a constant that is typically 20 for metals. The LMP was calculated for each creep curve. For curve fitting x data is represented by and corresponding y values are the respective LMP value. The values are again read into MATLAB from Excel. The curve fitting of the material constants and LMP is analogous to that of the creep strain curves with a few notable differences. The differences are tabulated below.

The fitting equations of the material constants and the LMP were chosen based on known constraints ( 4.3 ) and the observable pattern of the resulting data points. FORTRAN COMPILING AND LINKING

In order to be capable of utilizing the UPF features in ANSYS, the incumbent must have the proper software and setup requirements. For this it is recommended that they refer to the specific users manuals such as the Guide to ANSYS User Programmable Features provided with every version of ANSYS [24]. Several other sources provided insightful information regarding UPFs [25; 26]. The method of compiling and linking the usercreep.F will not be detailed here as this information can be found for each individual version of ANSYS being used. The usercreep.F subroutine code used for this work can be found in Appendix B. 4.4 CATIA V5 GEOMETRY CREATION

The two-dimensional axi-symmetric model of the smooth specimen for use in ANSYS was constructed in CATIA Version 5 Release 20. The model geometry is derived from a smooth cylindrical specimen with dimensions of a 25 mm (0.9843 inches) gauge section and 6 mm (0.2362

29

inches) diameter [18]. Figure 7 is an illustration of the CATIA geometry later imported into ANSYS Workbench 12.

Figure 7 Catia Smooth Axi-Symmetric Cross-Section Sketch 4.5 WORKBENCH MESHING

The CATIA surface part, Figure 8, was imported as an igs geometry file into ANSYS Workbench Version 12 for meshing.

30

Figure 8 Surface Geometry of Catia Axi-Symmetric Model The two-dimensional model is simple and therefore default settings where kept for meshing. Only one option was used, Face Sizing of the surface of the model with an element size of 1.0E-2 inches. The resulting mesh is adequate for the simplicity of the model. The mesh is illustrated in Figure 9.

31

Figure 9 Axi-Symmetric Smooth Specimen Mesh From the meshed model an input file was written to transfer the mesh into ANSYS classical. 4.6 APDL CREEP ANALYSIS INPUT FILES

The ANSYS analysis options and commands are written in ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) text files. APDL presents the advantage of documenting the analysis details as well as automation of the analysis, simplifying consistent reruns of the analysis. It is a quick efficient way of avoiding the need to setup the analysis each and every trial run through the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The example of an input file for the case of 109 ksi and 1112 °F is provided in APPENDIX B: ANSYS Source Code

CHAPTER 5

RESULTS & DISCUSSION

This chapter is a summary and discussion of the results of the work performed. The first results to be discussed are the curve fitting of the creep strain curves and their resulting material constants. This is followed by the results of the equations relating the material constants with stress level and the LMP with logarithmic stress. The measure of accuracy is presented by the R-squared value or also known as the coefficient of determination as calculated by MATLAB for each curve fit. In MATLAB the R-squared value is described as the goodness of the fit. The last results to be presented, is a comparison of the analytical creep strain curves as generated by ANSYS and the LCSP usercreep subroutine against the original empirical curves.

32

The resulting material constants of the MATLAB curve fitting procedure for the LCSP fitting of the creep strain curves are tabulated in Table 2 below. Table 2 MATLAB LCSP Curve Fitting Results

It should be noted that ,,B is actually the material constant . Table 2 was generated from the data output by MATLAB into an Excel spreadsheet. Given the very high R-Square values for each of the curves approximated by the modified LCSP formulation, is evidence of the methods considerable accuracy. The apparent accuracy and robustness of the method with minimal empirical data usage is attractive for application to user-defined creep models, incorporating all three stages of creep, within Finite Element Method (FEM) software packages. In order to interpolate between creep curves at varying stress and temperature, it was necessary to determine functions of stress and temperature for each material constant. The relations and their RSquared fitting accuracies are presented in Tables 3 - 5. Table 3 Material Constant

The functions fitted to the material constants  and p was chosen intuitively from the observable graphical pattern of the material constants plotted versus stress at specified temperature. The function fitted to xo was chosen partially via the observable graphical pattern of the parameter plotted versus stress. Also considered in the choice of the function, was the imposed constraints of the modified LCSP. Also, the Larson-Miller parameter was described by a function of logarithmic base 10 stress. The Larson-Miller parameter is used to determine the rupture time of the new creep strain curve. The Larson-Miller Parameter as a function of stress is presented in Table 6. Table 6 Larson-Miller Parameter

Some notable observations were made concerning the pattern of the relations of the material constants to stress.  versus stress at 1112°F tends towards some small value above zero as stress

drops (infinite rupture). As stress increases  tends toward negative infinity (no rupture life). In contrast,  versus stress at 1292°F tends toward positive infinity as stress decreases (infinite rupture) and tends toward some horizontal asymptote just below zero as stress increases (no rupture life). An illustration of the described behaviour is presented in Figure 10,

Figure 10 MATLAB Generated Plot of Material Constant Beta Versus Stress The inverse in the trend indicates the possibility that  is actually related to stress by a logistic function, which is characterized by two horizontal asymptotes. Figure 11 is an example of a logistic function plot,

35

More empirical creep strain curves at other stress levels would be required to produce more values of  to confirm this pattern. A stress low enough to produce large life and a stress high enough to produce nearly immediate rupture is required to acquire a true sense of the relationship of material constant  and stress. The graphical relationship of the material constant stress. is considerably more apparent than that of . with

The plot in Figure 12 illustrates the observed logistical relationship of material constant

36

Figure 12 MATLAB Generated Plot of Material Constant xo versus Logarithmic Stress The effect of temperature seems to manifest as shifting and compression/stretching of the logistical function. The material constant p, displays a polynomial relation of power two. Figure 13 illustrates the polynomial relation of material constant p with respect to stress level.

37

Figure 13 MATLAB Generated Plot of Material Constant p versus Stress The characteristic point of inflection in a polynomial function of power two (quadratic relation) is indicative of the material constant p controlling the inflection characterizing the transition of primary creep to tertiary creep. Therefore, the quadratic relation of p with stress implies that the material constant p has some effect on curve shape and specifically on the length and presence of a secondary stage. Temperature appears to manifest itself in the concavity of the quadratic relation. The last and most important results to be presented is the analytical results of the ANSYS Usercreep LCSP based subroutine generated creep strain curves compared against the empirical data points. Creep strain versus time data was output into text files through the Time History PostProcessor for each of the six cases analyzed. The creep strain curves of the six cases are illustrated in Figure 14 - 19.

The figures

- 16 demonstrated the most significant divergence with R-Squared values of

approximately .916, .936 and .787 respectively. The remaining figures 17 - 19, possessed R-Squared values of approximately .844, .982, and .958. Several sources of error were noted. First, it was observed that the LCSP is highly sensitive to the model used to predict rupture time which is used to determine the end point of each curve [10]. Slight deviations of predicted rupture time result in either stretched or compressed creep curves such as figures 14 and 16 respectively. Moreover, empirical data scatter that is slightly irregular such as Figure 16 are difficult to quantify, such that they do not conform to the expected creep curve shape. Finally, it should be noted that there is also combined error. The fitting error of the original curve fits is compounded with the fitting error of the material constant relations and the Larson Miller relation. Furthermore, the element formulation and calculations internally performed within ANSYS have their own error to contend with. It should be noted no attempt was made to characterize the relationship between the material constants and temperature. This was done for two reasons. First, since data for only two temperatures was acquired from the literature, only a linear relation with temperature can be inferred which may be misleading. Moreover, typically in ANSYS material parameters are described with respect to stress at a given temperature and ANSYS is allowed to interpolate between temperatures internally. Finally, temperature interpolation is not suggested for the reasons stated earlier. More data would be required to better understand the relation between the material constants and temperature. Therefore, the model of IN718 developed in this paper is not suggested for use when temperature interpolation or extrapolation is required.

CHAPTER 6

CONCLUSION

In summary, a modified Logistic Creep Strain Prediction (LCSP) method was developed and applied to the material IN718. The formulation maintains a simplistic formulation that encompasses all three stages of creep without limitations that the original LCSP method contained. In this thesis several modifications and constraints were proposed eliminating limitations the original formulation contained. Specifically, the modelling limitation on a minimum of 1 percent creep and minimum of 1 hour for effective creep modeling. The modified LCSP formulation of this thesis suffers no minimums in its modelling capabilities. Furthermore, the proposed modifications and constraints present evidence of a possible insight into the mechanisms of creep rather than simply being material fitting constants. The research performed was guided by the following development criterions: Minimal empirical data requirements Simplistic formulation Easy commercial FEM software integration

The development criterions are derived from what was termed the goals of applicability. Reiterating the goals of applicability, a models applicability is founded on the principles of Its easy application Cost of application Versatility

From this research, several things can be concluded. First, the LCSP modeling technique devised by Holmstrom et al. is a robust method that, with some modification, accurately predicts the creep strain curve of super alloys such as IN718. The modified LCSP formulation proposed in this thesis, offers a creep strain prediction method that encompasses all three stages of creep while maintaining a simplistic formulation. The modified LCSP, once again, does not contain any of the limitations the original formulation contained. Moreover, the modified formulation gives some insight into the mechanisms of creep rather than simply define the shape of a specific creep curve for a specified material. Furthermore, application of the modified modelling method to IN718 in an ANSYS userdefined creep strain subroutine is evidence of the simplicity, robustness and versatility of the modified LCSP modeling method developed in this work.

Finally, the development of the modified LCSP modelling method accomplishes all the development criterions set out at the beginning of this endeavour. The modified LCSP model does not need a great deal of empirical data to describe any particular creep strain curve. In fact, a few points from within each stage present in the curve which can be acquired from master curve data such as the LMP for time to specified strain can be used. The modified LCSP is a simplistic formulation not requiring complex variable data such as deviatoric stress or activation energies. It is easily algebraically manipulated from one form to another. Its formulation includes, in this case, a total of three material fitting constants, such that the fourth fitting constant  from the original formulation is assumed to equal 1. The value of  is set to one as is suggested by Holmstrom et al [10]. As for the very last of the criterions, easy commercial FEM software integration, the LCSP was shown to be easily integrated via a user-defined subroutine that was compiled and linked into ANSYS 12. The simplistic nature of the LCSP formulation made it easy to manipulate it into a form similar to the already standard creep material models pre-installed in ANSYS 12. In conclusion, despite any compounded error, the fact that only two of the modelled case has R-Squared values lower than .9 is evidence of the accuracy and robustness of the proposed formulation. The modified LCSP model proposed achieves the requirements of a model robust and accurate describing all three stages of creep at varying stress and temperature. The ease, of which the modified LCSP was integrated into a FEM package (ANSYS), is a testament to its simplicity and versatility. It presents itself as a viable modeling technique to be utilized for creep analysis requiring the incorporation of all three stages of creep. While, still maintaining the criterions outlined in this thesis.

CHAPTER 7

RECOMMENDATIONS & FUTURE WORK

Several recommendations can be made with regard to the work performed in this thesis. Despite the fact that the LCSP method requires little empirical data for anyone specific creep strain curve. In order to accurately assess the relationship between material constant and stress, creep strain curves at extremes (extreme low: rupture life < 15 hours; extreme high: rupture life > 5000 hours) should be included amongst a few more creep strain curves in-between. Also, as a standard of good practice the influence of temperature on creep material constants should include more than two temperatures to avoid the assumed linear relation between them. Furthermore, the interesting observation of the possible representation of creep stages by specific material constants as remarked earlier should be studied further. This could be done by observing the behaviour of the relation of the material constants and creep strain curve shape, and the presence or lack of particular stages of creep. Finally, the proposed model and the application of the LCSP model should be extended to the study of notched acuity and multi-axial states of stress. Moreover, many researchers have studied notched behaviour using other methods of creep strain modeling, that include all three stages of creep [13; 22; 27; 28; 29; 30]. This would be the natural step forward in the complete development of a well rounded creep material modeling method.
