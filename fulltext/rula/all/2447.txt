AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE COMPARABILITY OF COMMON JET ENGINE MATERIALS WITH NEXT GENERATION BIOFUELS
Masters of Applied Science, 2012 Paul Yoon, Aerospace Engineering Ryerson University

Abstract
Growing concerns regarding the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels and energy independence has spurned the transportation industry into developing a more eco-friendly and sustainable way to travel. The most promising frontier in this endeavor is the development of alternative fuels that will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of our current engines with little or no modifications required. The effect that one of these frontier fuels may have, camelina based biofuel, on various fuel system materials was evaluated in this report in accordance with ASTM D4054 in the form of a 50:50 mixture. The materials went through an immersion process at varying temperatures and tested under the numerous standards outlined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The results were compared to a benchmark Jet A1 fuel since the effects of this fuel on current fuel system materials is extensively known. The purpose of this research is to determine the viability of using a 50:50 biofuel mixture in current aircraft fuel systems by evaluating the physical properties after being fuel treated. The results showed that the biofuel mixture affected the non-metallic materials in varying degrees, while not affecting the metallic materials.

Introduction
1.1 Overview

As population grows and air traffic becomes increasingly dense, a method to curb our carbon footprint is becoming an increasingly pressing issue in the industry, government, and amongst public sentiment. Aviation presently represents about 2% of global emissions. This may be a relatively small slice of the emissions pie, but even a relatively small reduction in emissions can lead to great positive effects on the environment. It is also important to note that aircraft are contributing to emissions at a much higher altitude than surface level vehicles. Hence the effect on the atmosphere may or may not have a larger impact on our climate when compared to other modes of transport. Currently the most prevalent source of our energy is dug up from the ground, known as fossil fuel, and processed into aviation grade kerosene. We have been enjoying the benefits of this source of fuel as a relatively cheap way to provide energy for almost a century. However, times are changing. Fossil fuels are becoming i) increasingly more expensive to extract, ii) crude oil deposits which once were thought to be limitless are being depleted, and iii) the combustion of fossil fuels are causing environmental changes to the extent of which we can yet accurately predict. As such, there have been many investigations into the viability of fuels derived from a renewable source, in particular a renewable source which does not take away crop or land designated for human food consumption. Any new introductions of fuels whether it is in the form of fuel additives or a completely new fuel mixture would require extensive compatibility investigation to determine whether or not the changes made to the base fuel are detrimental to existing aircraft fuel systems. This is the
1

question that this report attempts to address. By performing a comparison analysis between standard Jet A1 and a camelina based biodiesel blend we can observe changes in physical behaviour of various fuel system related materials. The biofuel blend being used for this experiment is a 50/50 mixture of camelina biodiesel and standard Jet A1 fuel. In order to conduct a comparison analysis a series of standard tests are utilized as outlined in ASTM D4054, which is an operational handbook used as an overhead guide. ASTM D4054 outlines the fuel system materials to be included in the analysis, as well as their associated soaking temperatures and the particular testing to be undertaken. The scope of this report is as follows: i) Developing testing methodologies inclusive of: specimen preparation, soaking preparation, and test practices. ii) Determining the workability of laboratory equipment and achieving expected functionality. iii) iv) Conducting material tests based upon ASTM test standards. Evaluation of the resulting data collected for determination of the material compatibility of the Biofuel 50/50 to fuel system materials.

Chapter 2
Literature review
2.1 Introduction

The purpose of this research was to determine the efficacy of a bio-based Biodiesel/Jet A1 mixture in the fuel systems components of aircrafts. The search for a renewable source of jet fuel that leaves little to no carbon footprint has intensified in the last decade due to a host of accumulating factors. Primarily of which is the ever increasing cost of crude oil which is the base source of the bulk majority contemporary fuels used in today's aircraft. Factoring in our environment and the growing movement to mitigate climate change and we now have significant pressure to discover better ways to fuel our way from place to place. Altering the fuel is the first step in improving carbon footprint as it requires the least amount of modifications to present-day aircrafts, thereby decreasing any initial cost burdens placed on aircraft operators and simplifies implementation into the current system. Biofuels should therefore be sourced from articles that are either a renewable source or a waste product that can be converted to be useful as a propellant. The numbers of source candidates that meet this requirement are slim. Some examples include using algae, camelina, tallows, jatropha, and other waste oils. Of these fuel candidates, the most promising fuel source by far is currently biodiesel derived from camelina and jatropha oil. Fuels which are synthesized from these sources have very common chemical properties with each other, and therefore their effects on fuel system components will reveal similar characteristics. Jatropha oil is derived from the jatropha plant which produces a very oily seed that can be crushed to extract the oils and processed to develop biodiesels suitable to be used in aircraft
4

engines. Jatropha is a plant that is highly toxic, and has the ability to grow in relatively nutritionally poor and dry areas. However, plants grown in such nutrient deficient conditions demonstrate smaller yields than if it were in nutritionally richer soils. Therefore, a heavy emphasis is currently placed on the search for an acceptable source for bio-based fuels (Tomes D. 2011).

2.2

History of Biofuels and Alternative Energy

The leading technology for converting a variety of carbon-based materials into liquid fuels is the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process (Marsh G. 2008). Invented in Germany in the 1920s, this versatile system first converts feedstock to a synthetic gaseous mix of mainly carbon, hydrogen and oxygen called syngas. This is then catalysed into liquid hydrocarbon, which is subsequently refined into a range of synfuels including jet fuel. Significant drawbacks of the F-T system are its cost and carbon dioxide emissions. Gasifying the initial feedstock is energy intensive and therefore expensive. Converting coal or gas to liquid (CTL and GTL) hydrocarbons produces more CO2 even than emitted in refining crude oil (assuming that the CO2 is not sequestered and stored). While a military organisation might be prepared to accept the cost and `own goal' in environmental terms for the sake of an assured fuel supply, this course is clearly not ideal. Far better, it would seem, to use plant-derived biofuels along with wastes and other biomass, both as the feedstock and as the energy source for the process, thereby reducing CO2 emissions by 70 to 90% (Marsh G. 2008). Alternatives to food plant-derived fuels are the focus of research taking place around the world. Some are produced from waste and other organic feed stocks. Others are based on oils generated by micro-organisms, in particular algae Â­ the organisms responsible for the blooms that grow on ocean surfaces and the scum that floats on ponds. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory
5

(NREL) in the United States estimates that high lipid algae could produce up to three times more oil than soybeans on an equivalent area and resource basis (Marsh G. 2008). Jatropha is also discovered to be a very attractive candidate for the development of a plant-derived fuel for the aforementioned reasons in the previous paragraphs. Its' seeds are known to have 25% to 35% of extractable oil by weight and are used as a significant fuel source in India and Southeast Asia (Tomes D. 2011).

2.3

Earlier Development of Material-Fuel Compatibility Studies

In aircraft fuel systems, fuel comes into contact with a wide variety of materials. Biodiesel is chemically different from that of diesel derived from petroleum. Petro-diesel is a mixture of hydrocarbons, while biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid esters. The material compatibility using conventional petroleum based fuels have long been established. However, there is much less information available on the compatibility of fuel system elastomers with biodiesel. It has been reported in Biodiesel Compatibility with Carbon Steel and HDPE Parts: Fuel Processing Technology (Maru MM, et al. 2009) that degradation of certain elastomers is one of the main issues related to material incompatibility in biodiesel. Combustion characteristics of biofuels are different from those of regular fuels due to: differences in fuel flow, physical phase change, fuel atomization to chemical reaction, and heat exchange. In addition to combustion issues, replacing fossil-based fuels with biofuels can lead to other concerns about engine performance, durability and fuel storage (W.E.C. 2010). An article by Bessee and Fey (Bessee GB, Fey JP. 1997) investigated how the introduction of methyl soyester and diesel blends affected the tensile strength, elongation, hardness and swelling of several common elastomers. They showed that nitrile rubber, nylon 6/6, and high-density polypropylene showed changes in physical properties. Telfon, Viton 401-C and Viton GFLT
6

were unaffected. An article titled Biodiesel Research (Shafer A. 1994) found that methylesters can cause swelling of triloburtyl-dilene and nitrile rubbers. The reason for the effect on nitrile elastomers when subjected to biodiesel fuels may be due to the fuel containing more carboxylic groups as compared to those in petrodiesel. Elastomers tend to degrade more by these carboxylic polar groups of biodiesel (Haseeb A. 2010). An experimental study was performed by the University of Malaya (Haseeb A. 2010) regarding the compatibility of three different elastomer materials: nitrile rubber (NBR), polychloroprene (PR), and Fluoro-Viton A with a palm derived biofuel. Three different concentrations were investigated in this research: B0 (zero percent biofuel), B10 (10% biofuel), and B100 (100% biofuel) for 500 hours. The study then performed experimental tests at the end of the immersion period by measuring changes in mass, volume, hardness, tensile strength and elongation as shown below:

Figure 2.1 - (a) weight and (b) volume of different elastomers after immersion at room temperature for 500h (Haseeb A. 2010)

Figure 2.1 clearly shows how the increase in concentration of biofuels used in the soaking process leads to significant increases in swelling. The second figure further demonstrates how increasing fuel concentration affects the elastomers being studied. NBR seems to show an

7

increase in swelling as the concentration is elevated, while PR demonstrates a remarkable decrease by more than 50%. Fluoro-Viton A seems to exhibit statistically no change due to concentration levels, as well as virtually no chance due to temperature elevations. The same case can be made for the hardness results provided as shown in the figure below.

Figure 2.2 - (a) Tensile Strength and (b) Elongation of the Raw Elastomer and Elastomers from Different Fuels after Immersion at Room Temperature for 500h (Haseeb A. 2010)

Figure 2.3 - Changes in Hardness of Elastomers in Different Blends after Immersion at Different Conditions for 500h (Haseeb A. 2010)

The previous study seems to indicate the particular vulnerability of nitrile elastomers to biobased fuels. This is particularly of interest to our research primarily because our test specimens
8

comprise of nitrile based materials. The research paper written by the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic/Dockyard Laboratory (Hiltz J. 2003) provides further insight into the effects of, in this case JP-5 aviation fuel, with that of various rubbers.

Figure 2.4 - Shore A hardness of six elastomers before and after exposure to fuels (Hiltz J. 1993)

Table 2 in the article by Hiltzl (1993) shows how the hardness and weight drops after immersion in the JP-5 fuel. Focusing on the nitrile, we see that the hardness value drops nearly 50% and sheds just over 2% in weight. Keeping in mind that bio-based fuels according to Haseeb (2010) degrade nitrile polymers much more rapidly than petrol-based fuel, this material will be of particular interest during the course of the experimentation. The article written by J.A. Hiltz (1993) attempts to explain this phenomenon by stating that the "immersion of a rubber in a fluid may also result in the leaching of additives such as plasticizers from the rubber. Examination of the plots of fractional weight gain of the Buna N and black nitrile rubbers immersed in JP-5 against the square root of immersion time... indicate that the samples reached a maximum weight and then started to lose weight. Gas chromatography/ mass spectrometric analysis of a sample of JP-5 used as the immersion fluid indicated that dioctyl phthalate plasticizer was being leached from these rubbers." (Hiltz, J.1992)

Another article titled: Elastomer selection for bio-fuel requires a systems approach (Micallef G. 2009) investigates biofuel effects on various elastomer compounds. In this case, the study looks at fluorosilicone and fluorocarbon elastomers using five different test fuels of varying qualities. The test that we are concerned with however is the test performed with the B30 biofuel mixture made with rapeseed oil, which is a natural methyl ester.

Figure 2.5 - The results of Immersion tests comparing the effect of B30 blend of bio-diesel with B30 + 1% water for 336 hours at 150C (Micallef G. 2009)

The results show a large deterioration in properties for compounds 2, 4 and 5, which are all bisphenol cured fluorocarbon. Figure 2.6 illustrates the extent of the volume change for the test pieces together with blistering of some of the compounds. It has been suggested that the water contaminant causes hydrolysis of the esters found in biodiesel and the subsequent formation of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acids in conjunction with the metal oxides contained in bisphenol cured FKM cause the deterioration of the polymer via dehydroflourination (Micallef G.
10

2009). Unlike bisphenol cured FKM peroxide cured compounds do not require metal oxides for good vulcanisation. None of the peroxide compounds in this study contain metal oxides hence the deterioration in B30 + 1% water is significantly less. The only fluorosilicone tested showed the highest deterioration in this test with the test pieces disintegrating before a stress-strain reading could be obtained. This demonstrates that it is very important for the material selection to take account of the actual working conditions and that water contamination of the diesel must be considered in the material selection (Micallef G. 2009). We should then see trends and patterns similar to ones found in the articles above. Especially ones that involve the use of bio-based fuel composed of methyl esters. We can observe from a study performed by Chulalongkorn University (Trakarnpruk W, 2008) regarding the immersion of NBR, HNBR, NBR/PVC, acrylic rubber, co-polymer FKM, and terpolymer FKM, which are all materials used commonly in pumps, seals, fuel hoses, and filters.

Figure 2.6 - Mass Change and Volume Change results of elastomers (Trakarnpruk W, 2008)

11

Figure 2.7 - Elongation Change and Tensile Change results of elastomers (Trakarnpruk W, 2008)

"Biodiesel was tested as a 10% blend with a base fuel (B10) to evaluate its impact on the performance of elastomers in fuel system component. This includes fuel system O-rings and hose materials. Elastomer compatibility testing includes six types of elastomers (NBR, HNBR, NBR/PVC, acrylic rubber, co-polymer FKM, and terpolymer FKM). Tests were performed at 100 1C for 23, 670, and 1008 h followed by examination (% mass change, % volume change, % hardness change, tensile change, and elongation change). Mass change and volume change of elastomers after immersion in B10 blend at 100C are presented in Figures 2.7 and 2.8. Both changes show similar trends. Among the elastomers tested, acrylic rubber shows the highest change, followed by HNBR while the fluroelastomers, co-KFM and ter-KFM show the lowest change. Acrylic rubber has carboxylic groups which can absorb oil. For NBR and NBR/PVC, they show negative change with immersion time. This is due to the absorption of oil by the elastomer and resulted in the extraction of soluble components such as plasticizers from the elastomer. Biodiesel functions as a solvent. The increase in volume or swelling resulted as the extent of liquid absorption usually exceeds that of extraction.

12

Figure 2.8 - Hardness Change of elastomers (Trakarnpruk W, 2008)

The hardness changes observed on immersions of the selected elastomers for each period of time are illustrated in Figure 2.9. Acrylic rubber and HNBR show high decrease in hardness as a consequence of high swelling. Both NBR and NBR/PVC show high increases in hardness with time. However, the hardness changes were comparable to the practical tolerances of 10Â­12 points of hardness quoted elsewhere (Mortaon, M. 1987). Changes in the tensile strength of the elastomers after oil immersion are shown in Figure 2.8. All elastomers except HNBR show decreased tensile strength. However, difference in tensile change was not significant (Clamroth, R. 1979). Effect of B10 on elongation change, as shown in Figure 2.8, is pronounced in the cases of NBR and NBR/PVC. Upon immersion in B10, the polymer chains tend to have reduced entanglements, the elongation at break decreased." (Trakarnpruk, W. 2008)

Observing Fuel Compatibility with Fuel System Materials
3.1 Overview

The purpose of the test program was to ensure that the candidate fuel will have no negative impact on engine safety, durability, or performance. Much experience in fuel compatibility research has already been compiled from ASTM, various academic institutions, military, and OEM past efforts directed at investigating fuels and fuel additives. Evaluations have included fuel sources from the oil sands, shale oil, Fischer-Tropsh synthetic kerosene and the emerging biofuel option. As the aviation industry moves towards `greener' fuel substitutes (ie. fuels derived either partially or fully from renewable sources), the new fuels must be critically tested alongside either known results or currently industry active fuels to get a sense of how aircraft materials will behave once they are immersed in the new fuel system. Since using biofuels in aircraft are a relatively recent development, there were uncertainties about how the new fuel would interact with the aircraft fuel system on which it is deployed. Depending on the fuel system material, it may either exhibit no noticeable variance between different sets of fuels, or show some dissimilarity in mechanical behavior. The idea was to ensure that if there was some discernible change, that the change is minimal and within operational parameters. The parameters mentioned are outlined in ASTM D4054-09 for the wide range of materials involved, as well as the various testing procedures associated with the materials.

Test Program
Test Materials

Materials were chosen based on components which come in operational contact with the fuel system. Fuel system components such as seals, gaskets, hoses, pipes, fuel tanks were represented in the testing by their commonly used aerospace product. The type of testing was also outlined based on the application of the particular material in the aircraft. For instance, if the material was a sealant, then it was imperative that its' swelling or contracting attributes when in contact with fuel was noted. If the material was a fuel tank coating, then its scratch and abrasion resistivity was measured and so forth. The following table illustrates the Non-Metallic materials and their respective tests.

Tables 3.1 and 3.2 above are derived from the "short list" by the engine and aircraft OEMs and DOD found on Tables A3.2 and A3.3 in ASTM 4054-09. Table A3.2 is a list of representative non-metallic materials used in gas turbine engine and airframe fuel systems. Table A3.3 is a list
16

of representative metals used in gas turbine engine and airframe fuel systems. Tables A3.2 and A3.3 are comprised of materials that have been selected as representative, or worst case, for each class of material listed in Table A3.4. For example, many different polysulfide sealants are used in fuel tanks. Rather than test them all, a representative manganese dioxide cured product and a representative chromate cured product were selected for the short list. Testing material classes significantly reduced the burden from that of testing all 255 materials listed in Table A3.4 that are present in engine and airplane fuel systems.
3.2.2 Test Temperatures

The temperature column denotes the temperature at which the respective material was soaked in during the month long process. The temperatures are governed by the operational specification ASTM D 4054-09. The different temperatures were allocated depending on the type of material to be tested, and this correlates to various operational temperatures that the particular material will experience during its operational life in the aircraft. Materials were tested at the highest temperature to which it will be subjected for its specific application within an aircraft and engine fuel system. The scope of this report included temperatures of 71C, 93C, 153C and 163C.
3.2.3 Screening Tests

The tests called out in the tables above compares changes in properties of materials soaked in the new fuel (biofuel blend) to that of materials soaked in the baseline reference fuel (Jet A1). The tests are intended to be a first level screening to identify potential compatibility problems. If test results are within allowable variation as defined in the evaluation criteria given in the table below for each material, then the risk level of the new fuel was considered minimal. A set of the minimum baseline variation criteria is outlined in Table 3.3. Metallic specimens were evaluated under microscope and any signs of defects or corrosion were noted.

Fuel Soak

Each material was exposed to fuel at its associated temperature for a period of 28 days. Nonmetallic materials as listed in Table 3.1 were interrupted every 14 days to change out the fuel medium. Metallic materials as listed in Table 3.2 were interrupted every 7 days to change out the fuel medium. This was done to ensure that fresh fuel was being continuously used throughout the soaking procedure since there lay a possibility the properties of the fuel changing significantly when exposed to high temperatures for an extended period of time. The soaking was carried out for the 28 day period to confirm that the material to be tested had been thoroughly immersed and affected by its fuel environment as to simulate operational conditions.

3.4

Ovens

Soaking was done within two convection-heated ovens (Blue M Friction Aire Safety Oven HS 3804E). The ovens are designed to be explosion proof in its design as the source of heat is derived from a high velocity airflow system which creates air turbulence and friction from the air it draws, as opposed to traditional heating elements which may ignite fuel vapours emitting from the jars during the soaking process. The ovens also featured natural temperature interlock and built-in over temperature protection system, as well as an exhaust duct which continuously expels the internal gases within the oven which provides added safety. In order to conduct the soaking procedure in a safe manner, the aforementioned qualities are mandatory for testing and processing of hazardous materials such as the Jet A1 and biofuel that were used in this research.

19

Figure 3.1 - Blue M Friction Aire Safety Oven HS 3804E

3.5

Soaking Jars

For the soaking procedure, specimens were held in a glass mason jar of two different sizes depending on the size of the specimen. This was done so that the entirety of the specimen can be encapsulated within the volume of the jar while being soaked. A quart size jar (Ball 67000 3.5" x 3.5" x 6.9") was used for smaller specimens such as volume swell and hardness specimens, and a larger half gallon jar (Ball 68100 4.5" x 4.5" x 9") was used for larger specimens such as lap shear specimens. It is important that the entire specimen can fit within the jar since the container must have the ability to be sealed tightly during the soak procedure. Materials of different types were separated by different jars during the aging process. This is because it may be possible that components may leach out into the fuel and react with the other material specimen or component. For example, the polysulfide dichromate sealant was soaked in a separate jar from the polysulfide manganese sealant, even though they are to be soaked at the same temperature. Specimens which will undergo different tests from the same material type were also separated into different jars. This was done primarily because certain test specifications require particular
20

orientation within the jar during the soaking process. For example, tensile & elongation, hardness and volume swell specimens were required to be hung as per ASTM D 4054-09. However, they required different fuel levels in the mason jar and therefore they are all placed in separate containers. It is important that the appropriate fuel levels are placed within the jars to cover the testing area of the specimen. Specimens such as hardness and volume swell required its' entirely to be immersed in fuel during the aging process. However, tensile and lap shear specimens were just immersed under its neck and overlapping areas respectively. This was done to not only conserve fuel being used during the soaking process, but also to ensure that the fuel does not dangerously expand and create unsafe pressures to the sealed glass mason jar. Expansion of the fuel was shown in the figures below after a prolonged exposure to temperatures of 163 degrees Celsius (which is the highest temperature in the Test Program). Similar expansion can be expected for the 50/50 Biofuel.

Figure 3.2 - 400 mL of Jet A1 Fuel @ 163C Expansion to ~430 mL (Before and After Respectively)

In order to prevent the escape of evaporating fumes during the soaking process, the jars were required to be sealed air tight while withstanding the curing temperatures of the oven. In accordance with ASTM 4054-09, a piece of foil was placed over the mouth of the jar with an

inch overhang and then the lid was screwed into place to prevent evaporation of the fuel while aging. This method was proven to be insufficient in keeping the jars air tight, as evaporation testing demonstrated how fuel levels dropped during mock soaking periods at 163 degrees Celsius illustrated in the figure below.

Figure 3.3 - Fuel Levels Before and After Soaking at 163 C Respectively

Roughly 25 mL of the original 375 mL (approx. 7%) had seemed to have evaporated during the test. While this seemed like a trivial amount, the summation of fuel lost can become drastic as you fill the oven with 20-30 jars and they are all shedding 7% of their volume during the soaking process. This was not only a problem due to loss of fuel coming into contact with curing specimens, but also a severe safety hazard as a buildup of highly combustible vapours in an enclosed space such as an oven can cause a severe explosion. To minimize such a catastrophic event from occurring, another sealing method was developed to keep the jars from leaking fumes. It was noticed during the evaporation test that the primary culprit to the leakage was that the foil was being torn as the lid was being screwed onto the jar. Therefore, the aluminum foil was doubled in thickness and it was tightly wrapped over the open mouth of the jar and into the jar mouth threading. High temperature Kapton tape (CGS Tape), 2

22

mil in thickness, was then tightly wrapped over the thread area of the jar once around. Excess tape was folded over the top face of the foil covering the jar mouth to protect the foil from being torn by the lid. The lid was then smoothly and firmly twisted over the applied tape until snug. This method was shown to exhibit absolutely zero fume leakage when being soaked at 163C in the convection oven and is the recommended practise when sealing Mason jars in preparation for high temperature soaking. The figures below illustrate the process of sealing the jars in the revised manner.

Figure 3.4 - Revised Jar Sealing Method

3.6

Types of Tests to be Performed after 28-Day Soak Period

After the soaking period reached completion, the materials listed in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 were ready to be tested for evaluation. Examples of the test to be performed on the non-metallic materials of Table 3.1 were as follows:
3.6.1 Non-Metallic Materials

The testing apparatus used for the Single Lap Shear, Tensile, Elongation, and Compression Set was the Universal Testing Machine STM-50KN by United Testing Systems Inc. It supports loading up to 11240 lbs and has a top loading speed of 20 in/min throughout the 41 inches of

23

travel length. Its versatility allowed the operator to add smaller load cells, customized grips, and variable loading parameters to meet the various ASTM requirements of the tests.

Figure 3.5 - United Testing Systems Inc. STM-50 kN

3.6.1.1 Lap Shear Â­ ASTM D1002

This test method covered the determination of the apparent shear strengths of adhesives for bonding metals when tested on a standard single lap joint specimen and under specified conditions of preparation and test. In our case, the base metal was chosen to be Aluminum 2024 T3.

Figure 3.6 - Lap Shear Gripped in Tensile Machine

24

Prior to placing the specimen in grips, the specimen was abraded on both sides at the gripping edges to prevent the specimen from slippage during pulling. Any slipping during testing provided erroneous results that do not truly reflect the load curve of the adhesive being tested. Another important factor to consider was the alignment of the specimen once it was being gripped in the UTM. A pair of spacers with the same thickness as the specimen was placed at the grip ends of the assembly. This was done to correct the alignment of the specimen which will be off-plane of the tensile force due to the overlap created the offset. If spacers are not employed, then the tensile force generated by the UTM multiplied by the offset distance will create a moment that will cause the tested adhesive to fail at a much more premature force than if the adhesive were to experience pure shear. Therefore, to achieve the best possible results the specimen was set up as follows.

Figure 3.7 - Lap Shear Specimen without and with Spacers Respectively

The rate of loading for lap shear testing was set for 0.05 in/min and was gripped with a pair of self-aligning grips that adjusted grip strength as the specimen is being pulled.

25

3.6.1.2 Volume Swell Â­ D471

This test method covered the required procedures to evaluate the comparative ability of rubber and rubber-like compositions to withstand the effect of liquids. It was designed for testing: 1) specimens of vulcanized rubber cut from standard sheets, 2) specimens cut from fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, or 3) finished articles of commerce. In our case, all of our samples were specimens of vulcanized rubber cut from standard sheets or created by molding. Certain rubbers used in the fuel system such as gaskets, hoses, seals, sleeves, and diaphragms exhibited changes in physical properties from contact with oils and fuels. The changes in physical properties varied depending on the chemical makeup of the material, its exposure to a type of fluid, and the operating temperature at which this occurs. Properties of rubber articles deteriorate during exposure to these liquids, affecting the performance of the rubber part, which can lead to failure of the material. This test was designed to distinguish the change in mass property of the material after it has been conditioned in fuel.

Figure 3.8 - Method of Separation of the Specimens in Fuel

26

Volume swell specimens were suspended and separated in the fuel medium during the conditioning procedure. This was so that the specimen surface can have sufficient contact with the fuel and therefore creates the optimal scenario for volume swelling to occur. In order to determine the amount of volume swell which has occurred, the mass of the specimen in air and suspended in water was measured prior to, and post conditioning in the testing fuel as per ASTM D471.

Figure 3.9 - Example of Measuring Specimen in Water

The following formula was used to determine the percentage change in volume. This equation is used with the assumption that the delta density remains negligible.

M1 and M2 are the mass of the specimen dry and wet prior to soaking and M3 and M4 are the mass of the specimen dry and wet post fuel conditioning to the nearest milligram.
27

3.6.1.3 Tensile & Elongation Â­ D412

These test methods are used to evaluate the tensile properties of vulcanized rubbers and elastomers. Specimens tested were primarily in the shape of dumbbells, rings and straight pieces of uniform cross-sectional area. The conditions of which the specimens will be tested in have a great impact on the results of the test. Therefore, all variables such as the rate of separation, temperature, humidity, specimen geometry, were kept as consistent as possible in order to allow for results comparisons. According to ASTM D412, the rate of separation was dictated to be 20 in/min. The geometry set `Die C' was chosen to represent the dumbbell specimens for all the sealants and potting compounds in our scope of research. The dimensions of the specimen are given as follows:

Figure 3.10 - Dumbbell Specimen Dimensions

The maximum load up to failure, and its maximum elongation was recorded by the Universal Tensile Machine. Load curves of stress vs. elongation were plotted for graphical representation.
3.6.1.4 Static Shear Â­ D4562

This test method covers the determination of the shear strength of curing liquid adhesives used for retaining cylindrical assemblies or for locking and sealing threaded fasteners. Although
28

ASTM D1002 covers adhesive strength in the form of lap shear, this test method was more appropriate for the specific application mentioned above because the pin and collar motion more closely resembles practical use. This test method provided reasonably accurate information with regard to the ability of an adhesive to withstand shearing forces. It was also useful to determine the degree of cure and the effect of environment on shear strength as is in the case of this experiment. A pin and collar specimen was used to represent the candidate adhesive to be loaded in a compressive manner. The Universal Testing Machine was employed for applying the force to the specimen. The pin and collar assembly was placed on the UTM, and loaded using a crosshead speed of 0.05 in/min. The static shear strength is found by dividing the breakaway load by the bond area as follows:

3.6.1.5 Tape Adhesion Â­ D3359

This test method was developed to determine the strength of industry coatings on applicable substrates through the application of a pressure sensitive tape over slices made into the applied coating. This test method was mostly used to establish whether the adhesion of a coating to a substrate was at a generally adequate level. If a coating is to fulfill its function of protecting a substrate, it must be able to properly adhere to it during its service life. The substrate and substrate surface preparation are critical in determining the quality of the coat adhesion to the surface. If improper preparations are taken, then the coat can easily lift off the surface and fail to protect the substrate material. This was especially important in areas such as fuel tank interiors

29

where the metal comes in constant contact with fuel. Any failure to adequately cover the surface will lead to corrosion and possibly failure of the component prior to its expected lifetime. The tape used was a one-inch wide semitransparent pressure sensitive tape that is specially rated for ASTM D3359 testing. This tape was used throughout the entire specimen range because the variability in adhesion strength from batch to batch should be kept nominally the same. Three inches of length was adequate for the testing procedure and provides the necessary overhand needed for the pullback. When performing the test, an area that is free of defects and other surface imperfections was chosen and cleaned of any oils. Two cuts in the film of about 1.5 inches long that intersect near their middle with a smaller angle between 30 to 45 degrees were made. This was done using a sharp scalpel or other blade that will provide a clean and deep cut that cut through the coating all the way down to the aluminum substrate. It is important that the cut is made in one smooth and firm stroke. If an error was made then an attempt to go over the cut is not permitted as this may cause premature failure. Clean cuts can be determined by inspecting the incisions for reflection of the light from the metal substrate.

Figure 3.11 - X-Cuts Exposing the Substrate

30

A three inch piece of the testing tape was then removed from the roll, and applied firmly on the incision made. The centre of the tape was at the intersection made, with the tape running in the same direction as the smaller angles. The tape was then rubbed smoothly onto the cut area so that the color of the transparent tape is of uniform shade, indicating correct adhesion. An eraser was then rubbed firmly onto the tape to ensure contact.

Figure 3.12 - Tape Applied onto Cut Area

Within 1-2 minutes of application, the tape was removed by seizing the free end and pulling it off rapidly, and uniformly, upon itself as close to an angle of 180 degrees as possible. The X-cut area was then inspected for removal of the coating from the substrate by the tape pull and rated by the following scale:

31

3.6.1.6 Hardness Â­D2240

This test method is based on the penetration of an indenter when forced into the surface material under specified conditions. The indenter was either of Type M, or Type A depending on the material being tested. The indentation hardness is inversely related to the penetration and is dependent on the elastic modulus and viscoelastic behavior of the material. The test method is an empirical test and is intended primarily for control purposes. There exists no simple relationship between indentation hardness determined by this test method and any fundamental property of the material tested. Therefore, for our purposes, it was exclusively used for comparison purposes. A hardness testing machine (Shore Micro O-Ring Hardness Tester) was used to get digital readings on the hardness of the material. Calibration was performed by testing the indentors on OEM rubber pucks of known factory hardness, which are provided with the testing apparatus.

Figure 3.13 - Hardness Testing Apparatus

32

To test the hardness of O-rings, an O-Ring was placed on the test bed between two placement markers. The test needle was of type M for O-Ring specimens as dictated by ASTM D2240. The test needle was raised to a specified height which is set by the Shore testing machine and latched at its top position. The latch was then released, and readings are taken. This was repeated for five different areas of the O-Ring for all the specimens and the mean result is taken. Hardness specimens made from the sealants are tested on a level, solid surface. The test needle was swapped for a Type A indentor, and removed from the micro O-Ring testing apparatus. By hand, the indentor was smoothly and firmly pressed onto the surface of the specimen at five different locations on the specimen surface. The five positions were at least 6 mm apart from each other to get results as indicative to the entire specimen as possible. The mean result was taken.

Figure 3.14 - Indent Locations on a 2"x 1" Hardness Specimen

3.6.1.7 Compression Set Â­ D395

This test method covers the testing of rubber materials that are intended for use in compressed environments such as gaskets, or other sealing areas. The rubber gaskets in the fuel system environment will be exposed to jet fuel during operation, and therefore it must be known how the gasket will behave when a different type of fuel is introduced. The material was tested using Method B of ASTM D 395 which is the compression set under constant deflection in air.

33

The materials involved in the compression set testing are the O-Ring specimens indicated in the previous section. The compression device consisted of two flat steel plates with chrome finishing on the inner sides of the plates that will come in contact with the O-Rings. The surfaces contacting the O-Rings were then polished so not to introduce erroneous results when compressed. Prior to placing the specimens, the surface was cleaned of any grease, dirt, or other imperfections. Spacers are placed between the two plates so that 25% of the material thickness was being compressed. The plates between the test specimens that were compressed were made of a steel of sufficient thickness to withstand the compressive stresses without bending. The two plates were fastened together using mechanical bolts.

Figure 3.15 - Compression Plate and O-Ring Setup

34

The bolts are tightened incrementally one at a time so that it is brought to bear on the specimens evenly and smoothly. The test temperature was chosen depending on the soaking temperature of the O-Ring, and the test period was conducted for 70 hours. Once complete, the assembly was taken out and allowed to cool in room temperature. The specimens were then removed and allowed to rest for 30 minutes before measurements were taken of the final thickness. The compression percentage is calculated as follows:

3.6.2

Metallic Materials

As per ASTM 4054-09 A3.2.9.3 and A3.2.9.4: At the conclusion of the 28 day soak cycle, the metal test specimens were removed from the test fluid, air dried, and examined visually under low power (<50x) optical magnification. The objective was to inspect for evidence of staining, deposits, surface pits, or gross corrosion. Staining was considered a benign surface phenomenon. Staining results in no appreciable weight loss or gain and indicates the formation of a passive layer that inhibits corrosion. Subsequent to the initial examination, the metal surfaces were cleaned using acetone or alcohol and re-examined for surface pits. Following surface evaluation, metal test specimens were crosssectioned, mounted, and polished to reveal a profile of the surface and interior. Polishing was conducted in accordance with procedures established by the evaluating laboratory. The procedures were consistent with those specified by the polishing apparatus manufacturer, and

35

appropriate for use on metallic alloys being evaluated as described by metallographic procedures outline in the ASTM Metals Handbook. Mounted and polished specimens were examined at optical magnification levels between 100X and 1000X for evidence of microstructural changes, corrosion or other effects of exposure on the surface or bulk material. Observations made from specimens soaked in the reference fuel versus specimens soaked in the test fuel were compared by noting any dissimilarity between the materials.

Chapter 4
Synopsis of Materials and Preparations
4.1
4.1.1

Materials
Introduction

The materials introduced in this chapter are various products and base materials found commonly, and used widely in the Aerospace industry. The materials were divided into two large categories: Metallic and non-metallic materials. The metallic materials consisted of various Aluminum alloys, Titanium alloys, Steel alloys common in the industry, as well as other alloys such as Inconel and Waspaloy. Unlike the materials in the list of non-metallics, all metals were isotropic in nature. Metallic specimens were treated differently from Non-Metallic specimens throughout the research, from soaking procedure to testing requirements. All metallic specimens came pre-fabricated and preparation procedure for these specimens will not be represented. Non-metallic materials are all other materials represented in tests. Non-metallic materials included specimens made from commonly used aircraft sealants such as PR-1422, bonding adhesives, carbon fiber composites, gaskets, bladders, film strips, paint coatings, and foams. Non-metallic materials shared very little in common with each other when compared to the metallic materials. Their characteristics ranged from being extremely elastic to extremely brittle and varied in colour much more diversely than metallic materials. Their mechanical behavior was therefore extremely varied and complex in nature. The non-metallic specimens were in general prepared from base materials, or fabricated from pre-manufactured materials. The specimens that were prepared in any way are represented in the second half of this section.

37

4.1.2

Non-Metallics

4.1.2.1 Epoxy Paste Adhesive - Hysol EA 9394

Hysol EA 9394 is a two-part structural paste adhesive which cures at room temperature and possesses excellent strength to 350F/ 177C and higher. Its thixotropic nature and excellent high temperature compressive strength also makes it ideal for potting, filling and liquid shim applications. The adhesive typically comes in two parts, and when mixed together it produces a thick grey paste which is easily handled.
4.1.2.2 Methacrylate Adhesive - Loctite 609

Loctite 609 provides bonding of cylindrical fitting parts such as pin and collar assemblies, screws, and bolts. The product cures anaerobically when confined in the absence of air between close fitting metal surfaces and prevents loosening and leakage from shock and vibration. Typical applications include rotor to shafts in fractional and sub fractional horsepower motors, locks, bushings, and sleeves in housings on shafts. This product is not recommended for use in pure oxygen and/or oxygen rich systems and should not be selected as a sealant for chlorine or other strong oxidizing materials. The adhesive is identified by its green colour.
4.1.2.3 Nitrile Coating Â­ EC 776

EC 776 is a general purpose fuel resistant coating. It is a solvent-based adhesive/coating with a good adhesion to synthetic rubber, metal, glass and many plastics. EC-776SR is a variant of the same coating which includes a red dye for identification purposes. The coating when cured resists oil, gasoline and aromatic fuels. It is not recommended for use with alcohol containing fuels (gasohol) or jet fuel containing microbial organisms.
4.1.2.4 Polyurethane Coating Â­ 825X309

825X309 is a DeSoto integral fuel tank coating which is chemically cured acid and fluid resistant urethane coating intended for the protection against fuel contaminants. These products are

38

designed to provide maximum protection for non-ferrous metals, against fresh or salt water, aircraft fuels, hydraulic fuels, engine oils and dilute acid solutions. It offers excellent adhesion to chemically treated surfaces and is unique in having good adhesion to titanium and stainless steel. It exhibits very good intercoat compatibility with sealants and touch-up materials when properly cleaned, even after long term exposure to fuel. This material contains photochemically reactive solvents per SCAQMD Rule 102. This coating is widely used in the aerospace industry to protect the inside of aircraft fuel tanks against corrosion from fuel contaminants or oxidation. When the parts are mixed together, the coating is a pastel green colour which cures to a dark green colour.
4.1.2.5 Teflon

Polytetrafluoroethylene, or Teflon, is a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene that finds numerous applications. Teflon is a compound consisting exclusively of carbon and fluorine and is hydrophobic in nature. Teflon also exhibits one of the lowest coefficients of friction against any solid. Due to these physical qualities, Teflon is widely used in the aerospace industry throughout many areas of an aircraft. Examples of aerospace applications include fasteners, shafts, bushes, hoses, bearings, filters, screens, connectors, exhaust systems, etc.
4.1.2.6 Polyethylene

Polyethylene, or PE, is the most common plastic available and in production. It has the chemical formula (C2H4)nH2 where the `n` denotes the length of the chain. Most polyethylene grades have excellent chemical resistance, meaning that it is not attacked by strong acids or strong bases. It is also resistant to gentle oxidants and reducing agents. Applications are extremely wide ranging in an aircraft. It can be used virtually everywhere from trims, covers, hoses, tapes, tubes, fasteners, bushings, shims, screens, etc.

39

4.1.2.7 Kapton

Kapton is a polyimide film developed by DuPont which can remain stable in a wide range of temperatures, from -273 to +400 Â°C. Kapton insulated wiring has been widely used in civil and military aircraft because it is lighter than other insulators, and has good insulating and temperature characteristics. Kapton does however exhibit low mechanical abrasion qualities and the industry as a whole has moved away from the use of Kapton wire covers in areas where mechanical abrasion is prevalent and can lead to the possibility of short circuits. (Navick, X. 2004)
4.1.2.8 Polyurethane

Polyurethane, or PU, is a polymer composed of a chain of organic units joined by urethane links. Polyurethanes are also widely used in the aerospace industry. They are used in the manufacture of flexible, high-resilient foam seating, rigid foam insulation, seals, gaskets, electrical potting compounds, adhesives, surfaces coatings, and surface sealants. In the case of our research, polyurethane as a foam is represented as being used in fuel tanks. The polyurethane foam in the fuel tank prevents catastrophic explosions of ignited fuel vapors in the tank cause by electrical arcing, overheating of internal components, lightning strikes, or by static electrical discharge. In the event of a fuel tank rupture it mitigates fuel spray as the fuel is being contained in the foam matrix.
4.1.2.9 Nitrile O-Ring Â­ N602-76

Nitrile rubber (NBR) is the general term for acrylonitrile butadiene terpolymer. The acrylonitrile content of nitrile sealing compounds varies considerably (18% to 50%) and influences the physical properties of the finished material. The higher the acrylonitrile content, the better the resistance to oil and fuel. At the same time, elasticity and resistance to compression set is adversely affected. In view of these opposing realities, a compromise is often drawn, and
40

medium acrylonitrile content selected. NBR has good mechanical properties when compared with other elastomers and high wear resistance. NBR is not resistant to weathering and ozone. See Figure 2-2. In view of these opposing realities, a compromise is again drawn and a medium acrylonitrile content selected. This material is used commonly as seals and gaskets for fuel systems and is characterized by its dark colour with shiny finish.
4.1.2.10 Fluorocarbon & L.T. Fluorocarbon O-Rings Â­ V747 & VM128

Fluorocarbon (FKM) has excellent resistance to high temperatures, ozone, oxygen, mineral oil, synthetic hydraulic fluids, fuels, aromatics and many organic solvents and chemicals. Low temperature resistance is normally not favorable and for static applications is limited to approximately -26Â°C (-15Â°F) although in certain situations it is suitable down to -40Â°C (-40Â°F). Under dynamic conditions, the lowest service temperature is between -15Â°C and -18Â°C (5Â°F and 0Â°F). Gas permeability of the material is very low and has a good chemical resistance to fuels. Fluorocarbon is characterized by its dark colour, and LT Fluorocarbon is characterized by its dark colour with dull finish.
4.1.2.11 Hose

Epichlorohydrin (ECO) has properties similar to nitrile rubber but with better heat, oil and petrol resistance. It has a low gas permeability and better low temperature flexibility than NBR. Its resistance to acids, alkalis and ozone is excellent. However, its poor compression set limits its use as a sealing material and its corrosive effect on metals can increase tooling costs and limit metal bonding applications. Typical uses are in fuel systems, bladders, diaphragms and rollers. (EEL. 2009)
4.1.2.12 Polysulfide Sealant Â­ CS3100

CS 3100 is a two-part polysulfide component that cures to a firm and flexible rubber. Part A is characterized by its white colour, and the curing agent is of a reddish brown colour. The mixture
41

prior to curing is less viscous than the other sealants explored in this report and is very easy to manipulate. The material is used for potting and sealing electrical connectors and components for protection from moisture, fuels, dirt and other contaminants.

44

4.1.3

Metals

4.1.3.1 2024 T3

Good machinability and surface finish capabilities. It is a high strength material of adequate workability. This is due to its primary alloying element being copper. 2024 T3 is used extensively in the aerospace industry for a wide range of components. It largely has superseded 2017 for structural applications. Common applications are fittings, gears, shafts, bolts, fuse parts, hydraulic valve bodies, nuts, etc.
4.1.3.2 6061 T6

6061 T6 offers excellent joining characteristics, and good acceptance of applied coating. It combines relatively high strength, good workability, and high resistance to corrosion. 6061 T6 is widely available and common. It is commonly used in aircraft fittings, and structures such as wings and fuselages. Although 6061 is characteristically weaker than 2024, it offers better corrosion resistance even when the surface is abraded.
4.1.3.3 7075-T6

7075-T6 is a very high strength material used in highly stressed structural parts. It is primarily alloyed with zinc. It has strength which is comparable to many steels, and has good fatigue strength and average machinability. Compared to other aluminum alloys however, it offers less resistance to corrosion. Applications include aircraft fittings, gears, shafts, fuse parts, meter shafts and gears, regulating valve parts, etc.
4.1.3.4 Chromate Conversion Coating, Chromic Acid & Sulphuric Acid Coating

Acid coating is a type of conversion coating used to passivate aluminum alloys. They are primarily used as a corrosion inhibitor, or primer. The process is usually performed in an acid solution which slowly dissolves the aluminum oxide. The acid action is balanced with the oxidation rate to form a coating with nanopores. The acid used differentiates the type of

45

anodization between the three explored in this report. Aluminum that has been surface treated will exhibit different colour characteristics depending on the type of acid being used.
4.1.3.7 17-4 PH

17-4 Precipitation Hardening also known as Type 630 is a chromium-copper precipitation hardening stainless steel used for applications requiring high strength and a moderate level of corrosion resistance. High strength is maintained to approximately 600 degrees Fahrenheit. Alloy 17-4 PH is a precipitation hardening martensitic stainless steel with Cu and Nb/Cb additions. The grade combines high strength, hardness (up to 572Â°F / 300Â°C), and corrosion resistance. Mechanical properties can be optimized with heat treatment. Very high yield strength up to 1100-1300 MPa (160-190 ksi) can be achieved. The grade should not be used at temperatures above 572Â°F (300Â°C) or at very low temperatures. It has adequate resistance to atmospheric corrosion or in diluted acids or salts where its corrosion resistance is equivalent to Alloy 304 or 430. It has common applications in turbine blades in the aerospace industry.
4.1.3.8 304-SS

304-SS is an austenitic Cr-Ni stainless steel. Better corrosion resistance than Type 302. It has high ductility, excellent drawing, forming, and spinning properties. Essentially non-magnetic, becomes slightly magnetic when cold worked. Low carbon content means less carbide precipitation in the heat-affected zone during welding and a lower susceptibility to intergranular corrosion. It is used commonly in tubing, flexible metal hoses, oil well filter screens, etc.
4.1.3.9 Inconel 625

Inconel Filler Metal 625 is recommended for gas metal arc and gas tungsten arc welding of nickel base alloys 625 and 601, Incoloy alloys, carbon steels, low alloy steels and stainless steels. This alloy is useful for jet engine applications requiring excellent stress-rupture strength, oxidation resistance to 1200Â°F, plus outstanding fatigue strength and cryogenic properties. Many
46

engine applications include ducting systems, combustion systems, thrust reverser assemblies, fuel nozzles, afterburner parts and spray bars.
4.1.3.10 Inconel 718

Developed in the early 1960's, IN718 is still considered the material of choice for the majority of aircraft engine components with service temperatures below 1200Â°F (650Â°C). Inconel 718 is a precipitation-hardenable nickel-chromium alloy containing also significant amounts of iron, niobium, and molybdenum along with lesser amounts of aluminum and titanium. It combines corrosion resistance and high strength with outstanding weldability including resistance to postweld cracking. The alloy has excellent creep-rupture strength at temperatures to 1300Â°F (700Â°C).
4.1.3.11 Monel 400

Monel 400 is a nickel-copper alloy with high strength and excellent corrosion resistance in a range of media including sea water, hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, and alkalis. Monel metal finds bulk uses in aircraft construction, especially in the making of frames and skins of components that experience great operational heating. Monel metal retains its strength at very high temperatures, allowing it to maintain its shape at high atmospheric flight speeds.
4.1.3.12 Nickel 200

Commercially pure (99.6%) wrought nickel with good mechanical properties and resistance to a range of corrosive media. Good thermal, electrical, and magnetostrictive properties. Ferromagnetic. Used for a variety of processing equipment, particularly to maintain product purity in handling foods, synthetic fibers, and alkalis.
4.1.3.13 Ti 3Al-2.5V, Ti 8Al-1V-1Mo & Ti CP70

Titanium alloys are metals which contain a mixture of titanium and otherchemical elements. Such alloys have very high tensile strength and toughness (even at extreme temperatures). They
47

are light weight, have extraordinary corrosion resistance and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures.
4.1.3.16 Waspaloy

Waspaloy is an age-hardenable, nickel-based superalloy with excellent strength properties through temperatures of roughly 1800Â°F (980Â°C). Other characteristics of Waspaloy include good corrosion resistance, as well as being relatively impervious to oxidation making it well suited for service in extreme environments. Waspaloy alloy is typically used in high temperature applications, particularly in gas turbines. Components include turbine compressor blades and discs, shafts, spacers, fasteners, and other miscellaneous jet engine hardware.

Specimen Preparation
Tensile/Elongation Dog Bone, Hardness, and Volume Swell Specimens

4.2.1.1 The Mold: Surface Conditioning and Prior Engagements

The tensile, hardness, and volume swell specimens for the sealant materials were created using a flatbed female mold made of 6061 Aluminum. The material was chosen due to its machinability, and relative cost, however Aluminum is known to have a strong bonding characteristic to pretty much every PRC compound. Silicone or Teflon would probably be the best material to create a mold for this sort of application. However the cost benefits of manufacturing a custom mold made of these materials would be negated due to the cost outweighing the advantages. To aid in the removal process of the specimens from the mold after they have sufficiently cured, the surface of the mold was milled to a finish of roughly 32 micro inches. This in itself is not sufficient in lifting the material off the mold. A release agent was used in conjunction with the Aluminium mold to ensure the proper removal of the specimens without damage occurring to the specimen from sticking. The nature of the release agent can vary per the personal preferences of
48

the research operator. However, it has been found in personal trials that the Flex-Z 6.0 (Zyvax) release agent performed appreciably better than Teflon, or silicone release agents. Zyvax also has Flex-Z 5.0 to 1.0 in its product lineup, however the 6.0 was exclusively used for the specimens created by this research operator. Using a lint-free cotton cloth, the release agent was applied thinly across all pertaining surfaces. The Flex was left to dry for 15 minutes, and another layer was applied. This was repeated for 3-5 layers depending on the material which was entering the mold. Some sealants displayed much more adhesive characteristics than others, and judgement is left to the research operator on how many layers are required.

Figure 4.1 - Flex Z 6.0 Release Agent

This arrangement worked quite well in producing consistent and good quality test samples. This was especially important for the dog bone tensile strength specimens, where the neck of the specimen is of particular interest. The volume swell and hardness tests are more forgiving in terms of the surface characteristics of the specimen. The neck area of the dog bone specimen however, required defect free conditions to provide reliable and consistent test results.

49

4.2.1.2 Mixing Two Part PRC Sealants

PRC sealants usually arrive as a two-part component usually 6 ounces in volume. Part A and B are contained in two separate tubes which come attached together as a semkit as shown in the figure below.

Figure 4.2 - PRC DeSoto Semkit

There are in general two different types of sealant dispensing units. One is the `Barrier Style', and the other is the `Injection Style'. Our experience has only come across the Injection Style, and the proper method of operation is described in the following paragraph is to describe this style only. Proper mixing was critical in order to maintain consistent specimen quality and therefore consistent specimens across the various tests. In order to get proper mixing of the two parts, Part B was first inserted about a third of the way into the Part A compartment using the injection rod to ram the compound in. A third of the Part B compound was then injected into the Part A. Part B was then inserted two thirds of the way into Part A and another third of the Part B compound was injected using the ram rod. The final third of the Part B compound was injected into the bottom third of the Part A component. The PRC mixture is now ready to be mixed, and this was accomplished by created linear back and forth extension/compression of the Part B component through the entire range of movement. Through the range of motion, the handle was twisted 180 degrees counter clockwise in a gradual motion. This ensured that the Parts A and B were being thoroughly mixed together. One compression movement followed by the extension movement is considered to be one stroke. 60 strokes within roughly 3 minutes are required to
50

have a thoroughly mixed even mixture. Various sealant compounds have different stroke counts or time constraints, however in general 60 strokes/ 3 minutes was common. The reason why the limit on the number of strokes was set to 60 is because excessive mixing can begin to introduce bubbles and other contaminants into the mixture. Therefore, the operator should take caution not to under mix, or over mix the sealant. If there is an issue of under mixing, it can be visible through the side of the Part A component since the casing is translucent. After thorough mixing, the Part B component was removed by turning it clockwise, and discarded. The Part A component was now able to fit snugly into a sealant gun. An additional nozzle, which sometimes comes packaged with the semkit, can be attached to the nose of the semkit. From our observations, we have noted that the nozzle is useful for very precise application situations, such as to fill narrow channels or gaps. In the perspective of specimen preparation however, it was for the most part useless.
4.2.1.3 Filling the Molds

When filling the mold pockets with the sealant, special care was taken to avoid having any contaminants, or air pockets trapped. This was done initially by mixing sealants properly in the semkit as mentioned in the previous section. When the sealant was ready for pouring, the nozzle was first be placed as close as possible to the bottom of the mold pocket which is to be filled. The sealant gun was then be squeezed in a constant manner, while at the same time lifting the gun so that the height of the nozzle is consistently at the surface of the sealant being poured. This was done to avoid creating air pockets during pouring. The research operator should observe for any contaminants which become imbedded in the specimen mold and promptly remove them before continuation of the pouring. After filling the mold pocket, further care to remove air bubbles was taken by pressing the sealant into the mold using a plastic scraper.
51

Figure 4.3 - Metal scrapers should be avoided for a number of reasons: The first being that the sealant bonds quite well to metals making cleaning difficult, and the second being that metal scrapers will damage the aluminium mold.

Extra attention was given to critical areas of the specimens being prepared such as neck regions of tensile specimens. These areas were pressed first to disperse any possibly existing bubbles to the outer grip regions, and then the rest of the specimen was pressed subsequently. Following the pressing, the scraper wasplaced edge first onto the surface of the mold and run across the top of the specimen to remove any excess sealant material. This process was executed in a slow manner, since sealants in general are a highly viscous material and may drag with the scraper if not careful. If the scraping revealed imperfections in the specimen, then the process of pressing and scraping was repeated until the specimen was acceptable. It should be noted that one 6 ounce sealant semkit material is enough material for 6 hardness, 9 tensile, and 6 volume swell specimens. Figures below depict acceptable specimens ready to be cured.

4.2.2

Lap Shear: EA 9394

4.2.2.1 Surface Preparation

Hysol EA 9394 is an epoxy which was bonded to the surface of a metal substrate, in our case Aluminum 2024-T3 and tested to failure under shear stress. In this case the subject material was tested while adhered to a host material, the nature and quality of the adhesion between the two materials was just as critical as the preparation of the subject material itself. Therefore, particular care had been taken when performing the surface preparation to get acceptable and consistent results. Before application of the adhesive on the substrate, the surface was first roughened up to increase the ability for the adhesive to bond more strongly. Using a 150J grit emery paper, the surface was evenly and sufficiently roughened up with slight application of water to aid in the sanding process. After surface roughening, the surface was made free of dirt, grease or other contaminants which exists due to material handling. Using a lint-free cloth, the surface was degreased using any common industrial degreaser. In this case, CSM-2 (Vishay Industries) was employed.

Figure 4.6 - Wiping Down with Degreaser

54

After the surface was degreased and allowed to air dry, the bonding area was submerged in an acetone bath and wiped with a clean lint free cloth.

Figure 4.7 - Soaking Specimens in Acetone Bath

With a clean scraper, the substrate strips were all marked at 0.5" (12.7 mm) from the leading bonding edge. This provided guidance to where the bonding area will stop, to save time and increase accuracy and consistency.

Figure 4.8 - Half Inch Mark

55

4.2.2.2 Adhesive Preparation and Application

The EA 9394 was mixed in accordance with OEM procedures, and applied on the bond area as outlined in the previous paragraph in accordance with OEM specifications with regards to bond thickness. A second strip was done the same, and the two bond areas were combined together. Care was taken to make sure the bond does not pass the marked lines, and that the specimens are bonded as in-line as possible since bonds that aren't straight will give erroneous results when clamped in the tensile machine. When the bond orientation is satisfactory, they were held in place by small light clips. The small light clips were only used to hold the specimen in proper orientation until we apply the required 40 psi to the specimen for curing. Excess adhesive which is squeezed out was wiped clean after being clipped.

Figure 4.9 Â­ Adhesive Applied to Bond Area and Held in Correct Orientation

After half an hour, the bonded strips were clamped to 40 psi, and further excessive adhesive squeezed out was wiped clean. Speed curing was used in the oven at 66 degrees Celsius for one hour as per OEM instructions. From this research operator's experience, speed curing for Hysol EA 9394 created a more consistent and stronger bond than room temperature curing. The final bond is represented in figure below.

4.2.3. Tape Adhesion and Pencil Hardness: 825X309 4.2.3.1 Surface Preparation

The substrate used for this test material was chosen to be a 2 by 5 inch 6061 Aluminum plate. The thickness of the plate was inconsequential as the coating behavior on the surface is the primary concern for both pencil hardness and tape adhesion tests but thicknesses between 0.06 inches to 0.1 inches would be sufficient. In order to correctly prepare the aluminum surface to accept the coating, the surface was thoroughly degreased and wiped clean of any existing contaminants. Any industrial degreaser is acceptable, however in our case CSM-2 degreaser (Vishay Industries) was employed using a lintfree cloth. The degreased specimen was then immersed in an AlumiPrep #33 (Henkel Turco) bath containing two parts AlumiPrep and one part water. AlumiPrep is a non-flammable phosphoric acid based cleaner, brightener and pre-paint conditioner for aluminum. It was used to dissolve any remaining contaminants from the aluminum surface, as well as strip the corroded

57

oxide layer on the Aluminum to reveal a bare surface which bonded to the coating more willingly.

Figure 4.11 - AlumiPrep #33 Immersion

The specimen was immersed for 30 seconds, then taken out and rinsed with distilled water. Observation was done to see if the water on the substrate surface was `beading'. Beading of the water indicated that the surface has been inadequately cleaned. If this was observed, then the cleaning process as mentioned in this paragraph was repeated until the water on the substrate surface displayed non-beading characteristics. After soaking in the AlumiPrep solution, the specimen was immersed in an Alodine 1201 solution containing a 3:1 ratio of Alodine and water respectively. Immersion in Alodine transformed the surface of the aluminum substrate into a tan color and it became a part of the aluminum surface. The Alodine solution was used primarily because it performed to offer a good substrate for both paint adhesion and corrosion resistance. The specimen was immersed in the Alodine solution for approximately 5-10 minutes before it was removed and rinsed in water.

58

Figure 4.12 - Alodine 1201 Being Poured into Immersion Container

A thorough rinse with distilled water was necessary to remove residual Alodine coating chemical salts from the metal surface. If blistering and corrosion problems appeared under the applied coating, this was usually the result of poor rinsing. The specimen was scrutinized once more after the rinsing process to observe for any residual Alodine, as well as for an even coating of Alodine. This was easily observed as the surface exhibited consistent tan color intensity if an even coating was achieved. After observation, the specimen was allowed to air dry to be prepared for the application of 825X309. The coating was applied as soon as possible to the newly surface treated specimen, to prevent contamination of the surface from reoccurring.

Figure 4.13 - Specimen Alodine Coated

59

4.2.3.2 Coating Application

After mixing the coating in accordance with OEM instructions, the coating was applied to the specimen face using a sponge brush. The coating can also be applied by a bristle brush, roller brush, or spray gun depending on the operator's preference. The coating thickness was as thin and even as possible without exposing any of the under metal.

Figure 4.14 - Application of Coating

Figure 4.15 - Specimens Post Curing

This was roughly 0.8-1.2 mils thickness. All specimens were coated as consistently as possible. After the coating was applied to all the specimens, it was air cured at standard conditions (25 C @ 50% humidity) for 24 hours to dry hardness, and 14 days to ultimate cure hardness. Care had been taken so that the specimens are curing on an even level surface, and that they are not disturbed during the curing process.
4.2.4 Tape Adhesion and Pencil Hardness: EC776

4.2.4.1 Surface Preparation

The substrate used for this test material was chosen to be a 2 by 5 inch 6061 Aluminum plate. The thickness of the plate was inconsequential as the coating behavior on the surface is the primary concern for both pencil hardness and tape adhesion tests but thicknesses between 0.06 inches to 0.1 inches was sufficient.

60

The substrate surface has been properly cleaned and degreased in order to prepare it for the EC776 coating. The surface was degreased using an industrial degreaser and lint-free cloth. In our case, CSM-2 (Vishay Industries) was used; however any other industrial degreasing agent can be employed as long as the surface is clean of contaminants.
4.2.4.2 Coating Preparation

The coating EC776 is a general purpose, solvent based adhesive-coating with good adhesion to synthetic rubbers, metals, glass, and plastics. The coating is resistant to fuels; hence it is employed as tank coatings. The particular coating employed for our experiment was EC-776 SR, which includes a red dye in the compound. EC-776 is a clear/light amber color which makes application by visual inspection difficult. The applied coating thickness was much more easily identifiable with the SR due to the red dye in the mixture.

Figure 4.16 - EC 776 Fuel Resistant Coating

The coat application coat thickness recommended by the OEM (3M) was approximately 1 mil dry film thickness. This thickness was found difficult to achieve when applying the coating using

61

brushing, since the viscosity of the EC 776 straight out of the can was rated at 1200 cps (syrup consistency). In order to dilute the coating to a more usable consistency, the EC 776 coating was poured into a separate container. Methyl-Ethyl Ketone (MEK, or Butanone) was then mixed with the EC 776 until the desirable viscosity is achieved. MEK is a common industrial solvent which flash dissolves when left in standard conditions, and is recommended by the OEM to dilute the EC 776 prior to application. The amount of MEK to be mixed in is determined by the research operator, and can vary batch by batch. Proper care should be taken by the research operator when handling MEK as it is a moderate explosive, and an irritant to the eyes and nasal passages. MEK was used in well ventilated areas only, and while wearing proper safety equipment covering the eyes, nose and mouth.

Figure 4.17 - Methyl Ethyl Ketone

The mixture was applied to the substrate by dipping the bristle brush into the mixture to get a thorough soaking of the applicator. From the top of the substrate downwards, the brush is applied at a constant rate, with consistent pressure. One coating was sufficient to get the desired coating thickness. If additional thickness is required, then the research operator should wait about 10 minutes prior to applying an additional layer of coating. Streaking occured depending on the
62

grade of bristle used for brush application. Much time was not spent trying to even the streaks as they smoothed out and disappeared during the curing process.

Figure 4.18 - Brush Application of EC 776

Figure 4.19 - Final Cured Specimen

It was noted that the applied thickness was thicker than the final dry film thickness since the coating lost mass as the MEK solvent dissolved from the solution. This was taken into consideration when applying the coating. EC 776 cured in standard conditions. To tack free condition it took roughly 20 minutes, and for ultimate cure the specimen was left at standard condition for 24 hours. During the curing process, tiny bubbles appeared on the coated surface of the EC 776. This was due to the MEK solvent and other solvents in the mixture escaping the compound. Much concern was not placed on these bubbles as they quickly escaped the surface entirely.
4.2.5 Static Shear: Loctite 609

4.2.5.1 Substrate Preparation

The substrate used for the static shear compression testing consisted of a pin and collar assembly. The material of the pin and collar can vary, however it was recommended by ASTM D4562 that the material be made of 12L14 steel, which has a high lead content.

63

Figure 4.20 - Dimensions from ASTM D4562

The dimensions of the pin and collar were also dictated by ASTM D4562 as shown in Figure 4.20. The substrate was degreased and void of other surface contaminants prior to the bonding procedure. Surface degreasing was done by CSM-2 (Vishay Industries) with a lint-free cloth. However, other industrial degreasing agents may be employed. Extra attention had been given to the exterior of the rod piece, as well as the interior of the collar piece as these are the surfaces where the adhesive was applied. The inside of the collar was degreased using a lint-free cloth soaked in the degreasing agent and shimmied through the hole back and forth. Impurities being scrubbed off the surface became visible on the surface of the cloth indicating progress.
4.2.5.2 Application of the Adhesive

Prior to applying the Loctite 609 adhesive, the pins and collars to be bonded were assembled together to ensure that they fit correctly without exhibiting any sticks or catching between the mating pieces. Once the assembly was established, the adhesive was applied to the circumference of one side of the pin, and the entire interior of the collar piece. This was to ensure
64

that complete envelopment of the adhesive between the pin and collar occurred once mated. The pin was then slipped into the collar piece while turning the pin in a 180 degree rotation.

Figure 4.21 - Pin and Collar Specimen

Figure 4.22 - Specimens on Curing Rack

This sliding-rotating motion was repeated three times until the pin and collar demonstrated smooth and consistent resistance to motion. This ensures that the adhesive had been evenly spread between the pin and collar. The assembly was then placed in a curing rack of specified height by ASTM D4562. Excess adhesive material was left on the leading edge of the collar after mating the two pieces to create a fillet. If a fillet does not exist, then extra adhesive was applied to create the fillet. Curing typically took 72 hours for our specified bond gap as defined by the OEM material data sheet. The curing rack was coated with a release agent prior to placing the specimens onto the rack, as the excess Loctite 609 bonded to the rack during curing and made removal of the specimens difficult. During the curing process, the specimens were shifted from its position periodically to ensure that the assembly does not bond to the curing rack.

65

4.2.6

Film Specimens: Kapton, Teflon, and Polyurethane

4.2.6.1 Specimen Preparation

The films were all cut from a larger sheet of material supplied by McMaster Carr. Using a sharp edge, such as a scalpel and a straight edge, specimen pieces were cut 6 inches by half an inch in dimension. If the edge of the cutter appears rough or worn, then it was replaced with a new cutting edge. Rough edges created uneven cuts and adversely affect the test results. The thickness of the films varied depending on the material used, but it was noted for future references. The larger sheets were taped down to a flat surface to keep it immobilised during cutting. Cuts were made with one smooth stroke, and pressed firmly through the subject material. If a mistake had been made during the cut, then another cut was made at another location. This is to prevent premature failure of the specimen during testing. Cuts were also not be made twice over the same line, as this created uneven edges which cause premature failure. Guide marks were made on the film surface using a marker or other soft felt tip to aid in the cutting process.

Figure 4.23 - Film Specimen Kapton Being Cut

66

4.2.7

Polyurethane Foam

4.2.7.1 Specimen Preparation

The polyurethane foam (G-15M) came prefabricated from Crest Foam Industries as a large block of material. The polyurethane block is extremely porous which made cutting using conventional means difficult. Cutting mechanically may yield poor results as well, as the cutting edge may fray and leave the surface ragged. This was critical when dealing with tensile specimens, as defects in the edge resulted in erroneous test results. Therefore, in order to produce a cutting edge that would be smooth; the block was cut using a wire heated by an electric power source. The polyurethane block was placed on a cutting surface with 1 inch of material hanging over the surface edge. Using another metal guide on top situated 1 inch from the free surface, the heated wire was slowly run through the length of the polyurethane block. It was important to perform the cutting slowly, and consistently to get the smoothest cut possible. The cutting procedure was done in a well ventilated area with a face mask, since the heated wire cutting through the polyurethane block creates noxious fumes. After cutting an inch thick slab from the block, the slab was cut into 1 inch by 1 inch tensile specimen strips to be prepared for soaking.
4.2.7 Volume Swell Specimens: Epichlorohydrin Hose

4.2.7.1 Specimen Preparation

The volume swell specimens for the Ephichlorohydrin hose material was created from a prefabricated slab in accordance with ASTM D471. Using a straight edge and a marking tool, the slab was sub-sectioned into 2" by 1" rectangular pieces and cut using a strong, sharp tool. A box cutter or shears were sufficient, as creating a perfectly straight edge was not consequential in affecting the results. A scalpel may be used with caution, as the blade may snap during the cutting process. Areas where the slab has greater thicknesses was neglected, as the thickness of the specimen was more critical to consistent results than the cut edge.

The static shear testing was conducted on the Loctite 609 adhesive using a pin and collar specimen as described in Chapter 3. ASTM D4562 was used as the guideline for material preparation, testing procedures and the resulting calculations. The figure above is a Force (lbs) vs. Extension (%) graph which illustrates the material loading to failure. As illustrated in Figure 5.1, the failure event is recognized quite clearly as a sharp dip in loading occurs at around 0.03% elongation, and continues to sustain a constant loading at around 80% peak load. The testing was discontinued after the initial failure has occurred as the adhesive will never reach its ultimate strength. The full sets of results are referenced in Appendix B of this report.

Chapter 6
Discussions
The objective of this research was to determine the effect of mixed Biofuel/Jet A1 propellant on specimens compared to a benchmark fuel of pure Jet A1. The results as mentioned in the previous chapters are compared to baseline results which were extrapolated from Jet A1 testing, and given limiting criteria which were outlined by ASTM D4054. Each test method was evaluated using its representative ASTM procedure, and the results tabulated were from the respective standard. The results evaluated were found to be acceptable, and no items were found to egregiously violate the baseline evaluation criteria. The following section summarizes the results found and any discussions pertaining to the test performed.

6.1

Static Shear Â­ ASTM D4562

The adhesive used for the static shear testing was Loctite 609 provided by Loctite, which is a subsidiary company of Henkel. A total of five specimens were used, with a shear area of 0.785 in2. When determining the shear stress, we simply divide the observed load with the effective area as follows.

76

The table above shows how Loctite 609 performs when exposed to Jet A1 and Biofuel 50/50. Every specimen tested seems to indicate that when the adhesive is in contact with Biofuel 50/50, it increases the strength of the adhesive. This can clearly be nothing but a good thing in the perspective of the adhesive, and passes the allowable criteria.

6.2

Lap Shear Â­ ASTM D1002

The lap shear specimens were tested with Hysol EA 9394 epoxy paste adhesive. A total of five specimens were used, with a shear area of 0.5 in2. When determining the shear stress, we simply divide the observed load with the effective area as follows.

Allowable Criteria 250 psi decrease

The table above shows how the Hysol EA 9394 performs when exposed to Jet A1 and Biofuel 50/50. Every specimen tested seems to indicate that when the adhesive is in contact with Biofuel 50/50, it decreases the strength of the adhesive. This is contrary to the results of Loctite 609, however the two adhesives are chemically different and a deviation of comparability can be expected. The difference of the average however is still well within the allowable baseline criteria. Therefore, the effects of the Biofuel on the adhesive are determined to be acceptable.

Polyurethane Foam Â­ ASTM D412

Tensile and Elongation tests were performed on the Polyurethane Foam by Crest Foam Industries. Total of five specimens were used, with a cross section area of 1 in2. When determining the tensile stress, we simply divide the observed load with the effective area as follows.

Allowable Criteria 15 % decrease

The table above shows how polyurethane foam performs when exposed to Jet A1 and Biofuel 50/50. Every specimen tested seems to indicate that when the material is in contact with Biofuel 50/50, it decreases in elongation properties. The differences of the averages are significant enough to warrant the result to be unacceptable under the baseline criteria as outlined in the previous section. This may be due to the biofuel is making the polyurethane foam more brittle and susceptible to tearing during stretching. Another possibility could be that both elongations are extremely high, and a difference of 15% between the two fuels may be too narrow a margin to consistently achieve. Since the results were consistent, we can conclude that the results were not isolated.

6.4

Kapton Film Â­ ASTM D412

Tensile and Elongation tests were performed on the Kapton film provided by McMaster Carr. Total of five specimens were used, with a cross section area of 0.0025 in2. When determining the tensile stress, we simply divide the observed load with the effective area as follows.

The table above shows how Kapton film performs when exposed to Jet A1 and Biofuel 50/50. Every specimen tested seems to indicate that when the material is in contact with Biofuel 50/50, it decreases in elongation properties. The differences of the averages are significant enough to warrant the result to be unacceptable under the baseline criteria as outlined in the previous

80

section. This may be due to the biofuel is making the Kapton Film more brittle and susceptible to tearing during stretching. Another possibility could be that the foams were tested at different time intervals after the soaking process has occurred and that could have had an effect on the results. Grip setup may also play a factor in the results, and may be a culprit in the premature breaking. Since the result is consistent, we can conclude that the result was not isolated.

Allowable Criteria 15% decrease

The table above shows how Teflon film performs when exposed to Jet A1 and Biofuel 50/50. The specimens tested seem to yield inconclusive data when the results between the Biofuel 50/50 are compared with Jet A1. Some results show an increase in elongation, while others indicate a decrease in elongation. The differences of the averages taken are significant enough to warrant the result to be unacceptable under the baseline criteria as outlined in the previous section. Grip setup may also play a factor in the results, and may be a culprit in the differences in elongation. The margin of failure may also be too narrow for the material being tested as both fuels show elongation over 300% and widening the acceptable margin may be necessary in ASTM D4054. The quality of the cut edge may also be a factor in the inconsistencies.

6.20 Metallic Specimens Â­ ASTM D4054
All metallic specimens under 40X magnification show no visible surface corrosion as shown in Appendix A. These would be identifiable by looking for pitting, or other physical defects. Staining and fuel residue was present for some of the metallic specimens examined, however under ASTM D4054 visual inspection criteria they are considered passive and not conducive to material failure. The specimens were cross-sectioned, and further examined under 150X magnification as shown in Appendix A. Focus was placed on the leading edge of the cross sectioned material to examine if material corrosion has occurred through the surface of the specimen. All the metallic specimens examined show no signs of corrosion within the cross sectioned area. Therefore, the effect of the Jet A1 and Biofuel can be determined to be negligible on all the metallic specimens analyzed.

Chapter 7
Conclusions and Closing Statements
The purpose of this research was to determine the efficacy of a camelina based Biodiesel/Jet A1 mixture in the fuel systems components of aircrafts. Materials that have contact with the fuel during normal course of operations were scrutinized through the wide range of tests that were employed in this study. These materials included various sealants, hoses, metals, films, adhesives, potting compounds, and others. The biodiesel tests were compared to results taken from a base line fuel, which was in this case regular aviation Jet A1 fuel. Jet A1 is used as the benchmark since an extensive volume of results already exists on the effects of Jet A1 on fuel system materials due to its heavy use in the aviation industry. When comparing the results of Biofuel/Jet A1 50/50 mixture with that of regular Jet A1, we were presented with a clear image of just how the Biofuel 50/50 has an effect on aviation fuel systems. A great deal of effort was placed on the specimen preparation portion of the research. Much of the materials that were tested for this report came as raw components that needed to be mixed, applied, molded, or manufactured in one way shape or form. Manufacturing of the specimens posed the greatest variable when determining whether or not a specimen that was tested provided accurate results or not. This was the case as specimen preparation sometimes involved multiple steps such as i) correct surface preparation and cleaning ii) priming of the bare metal iii) curing of the primer iv) application of the test material v) curing of the test material and finally vi) conditioning of the test material. Often if the material did not sufficiently meet dry testing requirements, it was due to one of those steps being improperly conducted. OEM technical data sheets were used as a basis for specimen preparations and should be used as an initial guide
103

when preparing any material. If proper steps were conducted in accordance with the OEM guide and test specimens still provide erroneous results, then other variations of preparations are to be explored. It is not uncommon to detract from the OEM guide, and it was found that by altering simple variables such as curing temperature and time resulted in vastly greater results. In general, the materials showed positive results when compared between the Biofuel 50/50 and Jet A1 fuels. Results vary where the mechanical properties of some materials were enhanced when subjected to the biofuel mix, while some materials exhibited deterioration in properties after the soaking process. The reason for the variation can be related to the sheer diversity of the materials being tested and their respective chemical properties. Loctite 609 methacrylate adhesive and Hysol EA 9394 epoxy paste adhesive are good examples of the above described phenomenon, with the former exhibiting stronger shear properties after exposure to the biofuel mixture while the latter showing weaker qualities even though both meet the acceptable criteria given in ASTM D4054.
Table 7.1 - Summary of Failed Materials

Material Kapton Film Teflon Film Polyethylene Foam PR2911 Sealant VM128 O-Ring

ASTM D412 D412 D412 D412 D471

Failed Requirement >25% initial elongation >15% allowable decrease elongation >15% allowable decrease elongation >35 psi decrease, >25% decrease elongation > 10% initial volume swell

There were examples of specimens which passed one set of test criteria, while concurrently failing another set of test requirements. Kapton film, Teflon film, and Polyethylene foam all pass their tensile test criteria. However, they concurrently fail their elongation benchmarks. In the case of Kapton film, the initial elongation is required to be greater than 20%, however an elongation average of 17% was reached. It was noticeably evident when looking at the resulting
104

data that some specimens clearly surpassed the base line criteria while some others did not. This is likely the result of variations in specimen preparation as well as the edge condition of the film to cause early failure. The Teflon film and polyethylene foam both show a marked difference between the Biofuel and Jet A1 fuels. They both fail the biofuel elongation criteria by a significant margin. The primary issue may be that both these materials show upwards of 300% elongation, yet the allowable base line variation is a 15% decrease which is a very narrow pass window. A possible solution may be to ensure that specimen geometry and condition between the Jet A1 and Biofuel 50/50 are as congruent as possible which may help to close the elongation difference. PR2911 is a specialized sealant which exhibits incredible elastic properties. Again the biofuel results yielded significantly lower results than the Jet A1 counterpart for both tensile and elongation tests. It can be that the chemical property of the polythioether polyurethane is susceptible to the Biofuel mixture. VM128 failed to meet the base line volume swell test with 32% swelling when the allowable limit is between 0 to 10%. The technical data sheet provided by the material manufacturer indicated the optimum operation temperature should be between 50 and 150 Celsius. According to ASTM D4054, the soaking temperature for VM128 was stated to be 163C. Since the soaking temperature is outside the optimal range, it may be the reason why the volume swell tests are showing erroneous results. These gaskets should be used either in a lower temperature setting between 50 and 150 Celsius, or another gasket which can tolerate the higher temperature should be employed in its place.
