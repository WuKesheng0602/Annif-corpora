ABSTRACT A case study is presented evaluating the productivity and ergonomic consequences of strategies implemented in a re-design of an electronics assembly system. The company applied partial automation strategies for assembly and transportation functions, moving from a parallel-batch to a serial line-based production system. Through simultaneous consideration of technical and ergonomic indicators we aimed to identify linkages between design decisions, productivity, and ergonomics. Data obtained from company records and key company informants were combined with detailed video analysis, biomechanical modelling and field observations of the system. Implementation of the strategy to partly automate assembly operations was seen to reduce labour inputs for component assembly work without directly affecting ergonomic conditions. The automation of transportation strategy reduced both labour inputs and work in progress. This strategy also resulted in considerable reductions in work-task variability, and hence increases in repetitiveness for operators at manual assembly workstations. The manual assembly station examined had some increase in shoulder load amplitudes and a larger increase in the time-density of work (reduced porosity). Work activities were focused almost exclusively on stereotyped `get and put' actions which increased in average frequency from one every 8.3 seconds to one every 7.4 seconds. Workstation design was constrained by initial decisions to adopt automation technologies and also affected by later problems in the automation of assembly. Ergonomic conditions varied across individuals and stations in the system. The adopted work organisation plan resulted in uneven distribution of risk factors across operators in the production system. It is concluded that strategic decisions made early in the design of the production system have considerable impact on ergonomic conditions in the production system. Optimal design for sustainable and efficient production require simultaneous and integrated consideration of technological and operator functions in the manufacturing system.

1.0 INTRODUCTION While risk factors related to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs)are known (Hagberg et al., 1998; Benard 1997; Buckle and Deveraux, 1999), it is less clear how production system design decisions may foster injury potential. Figure 1 presents a theoretical framework in which operators are exposed to WMSD risk factors as a result of the designed production system and work organisation. Pressure to increase worker productivity by increasing the time-density of work may result in the elimination of needed recovery periods and raise the workers' accumulated loading. In some cases the

1

improvement of the workstation design, and consequent reduction in peak loading, has actually facilitated the increasing time-density of work and thereby increased injury risk. This has been called the `ergonomic pitfall' (Winkel & Westgaard 1996). Similarly, implementing strategies to specialise workers' tasks by narrowing the range of duties may concentrate biomechanical loading onto particular anatomical structures. More varied work would distribute this loading across the body. These are two examples in which decisions in the design of the production system can have ergonomic consequences for the operator. Our research investigates the relationship between production system design decisions and the resulting technical and ergonomic performance of the implemented system. Key dimensions of exposure to mechanical injury risk factors include the amplitude of the load, the pattern of loading, as well as the total duration of loading experienced by the operator (Winkel & Mathiassen 1994).

2.0 METHODS An electronics company, producing AC/DC converters for the telecommunications industry, decided to increase productivity by automating parts of their production process. This automation was intended to improve the technical performance of the system. The company was concerned about ergonomic conditions in the new system and engaged the research team through the COPE program (Co-operative for Optimisation of Industrial Production Systems regarding Productivity and Ergonomics; Winkel et al., 1999). The company formed two groups: a technical design group responsible for
2

technical aspects of the system, and a work organisation group who focussed on workstation design and work organisation strategies for the new system. The COPE researchers assisted the company in making it's own ergonomics assessments for it's work-organisation team from the design group. This team then produced a proposal for the work organisation in the new system. The research team evaluated the ergonomic and technical consequences of the production system re-design using detailed video analysis of transport and assembly activities from positions across the system. Production information was also obtained to describe the system performance. Additionally interviews with company personnel helped provide qualitative information on both system performance and working conditions. Comparisons were made at the level of the production system including data normalised to the per product level and also expressed as a function of operator working hours. A detailed analysis of ergonomic and production performance at a specific manual assembly workstation, performing comparable operations in both the old and the new system, was conducted. Video analyses of core job tasks were conducted using a detailed video analysis system (Engström & Medbo 1997). One subject was available for video analysis in the old batch system and five subjects were available from the new line-based system. Biomechanical modelling techniques were also applied to these workstations in order to quantify physical demands of the two systems.. This allowed the assessment of some of the specific ergonomic consequences of the strategies applied in the new system. Limited sample sizes available for comparisons of physical workload indicators precluded statistical comparisons. Instead, multiple methods, supported with qualitative data from company personnel and the multidisciplinary research team, were used in order to `triangulate' and confirm key-findings.

Management personnel, who had not been involved in designing the work organisation strategy, felt the plan was unworkable since part of the staff on the new system came from an outside `temporary' employment agency and were unfamiliar with the system. Instead particular operators staffed more complex and variable jobs, such as robot supervision, without rotation. Operators who rotated every shift in an informal pattern filled the remaining positions. The jobs among which rotation occurred tended to be the low variability manual assembly and inspection work with frequent stereotyped upper arm movements. 4.0 DISCUSSION 4.1 Automation Strategies in the Production System Both automation strategies used in the case study improved labour efficiency in terms of worker minutes used per product. The strategy to automate assembly was observed to reduce the total exposure of system operators to repetitive monotonous assembly work although the remaining component insertion work remained concentrated onto three workstations. Problems in the automation of some component insertion operations resulted in increased shoulder loads on the remaining manual station that had to pick up the work that could not be automated. Automation of the transport system in contrast eliminated work that had provided muscular variability for operators. The result was a concentration of muscular activities on stereotyped and rapid `get & put' movements at the manual assembly workstation. Intensification of worker effort has been observed in other cases of automation improvements (Coury et al., 2000). Even though loads observed here were of low amplitude injury risk remains as these loads occur for extended periods involving the same body tissues. Exposure amplitudes as low as 2% of maximum capability are of potential concern if the force demands are sustained over a long time period (Westgaard, 1999). Further ergonomic concern relates to the reduction in variability and potential loss of recovery time, or micro-pauses, reductions of which have been associated with WMSDs (eg. Stoy & Aspen 1999, Veiersted et al.1993). Electromyographic testing would be required to support this possible injury pathway. These findings illustrate how decisions during the development of the production system can determine the subsequent risk factor exposure of operators in the functioning system (figure 1).

4.2 Workstation Design The design of the workstations was considered after technical system decisions had been made. Even though ergonomic considerations were explicitly considered during workstation design, the work organisation group was not able to overcome constraints created by the previously chosen technical strategies. In both cases of automation, negative ergonomic consequences were observed to result from interactions between the automation and the physical workstation design. In the case of the line system, which created some spatial constraints for component stocks, an elevated rack was used to hold component bins above the line level. A second elevated rack had to be added as difficulties reaching automation objectives resulted in shifting extra components to the manual stations (Figure 2). While the provision of sit-stand capability at the workstation might increase variety in whole body posture it would not reduce the essential `get & put' demands the job placed on the shoulder. The worsening ergonomic conditions on this workstation can be interpreted as unintended side effects of the partial automation strategies applied. Procedurally, this increase in injury risk is the consequence of placing
6

ergonomic design criteria beneath strategic decisions relating to the design of the technical sub-system which are made at higher levels of the model presented in Figure 1.

Figure 2: Layout of manual assembly station on the new automated line system. Elevated racks were required to make room for the conveyor system and to accommodate parts shifted from automatic assembly back to the manual assembly process.

4.3 Work Organisation Given a series of workstations with varying exposures, the work organisational strategy will determine operators' ultimate exposure pattern to these risk factors. In the case studied we observed the development of a team-based rotation strategy which was suggested by the work organisation group. Managers who had not been involved in the planning process subsequently rejected this strategy. Part of the reason for this appears to be the use of temporary workers, which made the multiskilling of workers appear less cost effective as future automation efforts would lead to the elimination of these operators. From a biomechanical perspective, it is improbable that rotation among work tasks with similar demands will provide substantial reductions in overall loading. Nevertheless, rotation strategies remain a potential approach to limit the duration of exposure of operators to workstations that have particularly intensive time-loading patterns.

4.4 General Discussion These results establish coherent chains of consequence, which link strategic production decisions to the exposure of operators to known injury risk factors as illustrated in Figure 1. Understanding this causal chain of increasing injury risk is necessary to develop

7

effective intervention strategies. If the primary sources of the risk factors are embedded in the production strategies used when designing the system, then it is unlikely that subsequent reactive improvement effects will have substantial impact. Ergonomic quality in the production system is determined by managers and engineers who choose and then implement particular manufacturing strategies. While caution should be used when generalising from case study data, it is probable that the relationships observed over the course of this re-design process will exist in other projects. The positioning of workstation design decisions subsequent to technical subsystem decisions, for example, has been noted as a potential problem. Johansson et al. (1993) have suggested that "...paying insufficient attention to human resource issues until after the technology has been selected and implemented creates a risk of problems that are so severe that the capital investment in new technology may be completely negated". Designers should note that the ergonomics consequences of automation strategies depends on the nature of the work that is being automated as well as what work tasks remain for the operators. The work organisation strategy can be used to increase task variety and thus distribute work-loads across more body tissues. Integrated consideration of a production systems technologies and it's operator interfaces is necessary to achieve optimal designs.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS Production system designers and senior decision-makers have clear impacts on, and hence responsibility for, the ergonomics of their production systems. The automation strategies implemented here increased both productivity and potential risk of musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. Early selection of technological solutions provided constraints that could not be overcome in the ergonomic consideration of the workstation layout.

6.0 RECOMMENDATIONS Designers and managers should recognise the possible ergonomic implications of decisions made during production system design. Automation efforts should focus on stereotyped repetitive work while maintaining work variability for operators. Feedback on, and accountability for, ergonomic conditions in production systems should be established within the design process. Simultaneous and integrated consideration of operators and operations, from the earliest stages of the design process, should be applied to develop manufacturing systems that are both productive and sustainable.
