Fuzzy Logic Control o f Compressor Surge in a Turbojet Engine Model

Е Mark Laderman, 2004 Master o f Applied Science in the Program o f Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University
Stable operation of a gas turbine engine's axial compressor is constrained by compressor surge and rotating stall. In order to avoid these flow instabilities, an active fuzzy logic control approach is applied to a turbojet engine model. The actuator surfaces used in the controller are the inlet guide vanes, movable stator blades, and variable spool speed with regards to the compressor; in addition, consideration is given to varying the engine inlet and exit geometries. For design purposes, in the simulation, the rotor blade geometry is also allowed to be variable. This thesis also examines the stability and control o f the Moore-Greitzer model, and Gravdabl and Egeland's close coupled valve active controller. The Moore-Greitzer model is used as a black box to create a surge detection and avoidance fuzzy logic controller that does not require a stall line. The controller responds to the fluctuations in the axial mass flow coefficient and the pressure coefficient across the compressor system, and adjusts the throttle characteristic or the closed coupled valve characteristic.

INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW
The main focus o f this chapter is to illustrate the differences between active and avoidance control with regards to surge in an axial compressor. This chapter provides background information on axial compressors and the flow instabilities, rotating stall and surge that can occur within the compressor. A literature review o f some o f the more predominant papers in the field o f compressor modeling and active control is also provided. Finally, fuzzy logic control is introduced as an alternative to classical control theory along with a brief literature review on current fuzzy logic applications.

FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL OF COMPRESSOR SURGE IN A TURBOJET ENGINE MODEL

1.1 MOTIVATION The work in this thesis is motivated by the fundamehtal mstabilily problems o f surge and rotating stall which limit the range o f operation o f the compressor stage in a gas turbine engine. The current industry solution for the instability problems is based on surge

avoidance, where the operating point of the eompressor is kept below the surge line using a surge margin. Aircraft engines are most effective when the compressor is operating at or near these aero-mechanical limits. Therefore, there is a potential for increasing the effieiency o f the compressor by narrowing the gap between the current margin line and the surge line. This approach raises the need for an active controller that can quickly stabilize a compressor that crosses into the surge region. Active surge control in

approach is fundamentally different to surge avoidance, In active surge control, feedback is used to stabilize the unstable regime Of the Compressor map. Another alternative to surge avoidance is surge detection and avoidance. Using a detection strategy, the

drawbacks o f the loosely defined surge margin can be avoided,

1.2 BACKGROUND ON AXIAL COMPRESSORS A compressor transfers kinetic energy from an aero-mechanically-driven rotor to a steady flow of air. The pressure o f the air is raised by converting the acceleration imparted by the rotating parts o f the compressor via diffusion. In an axM 'Рow compressor the ah flows through in the dhection parallel to the axis o f rotation: The interest in this field largely involves axial compressors rather then centrifugal, mainly due to the fact that the majority o f ahcraft engines utilize axial compressors (Gravdahl and Egeland, 1997b).

The kinetic energy o f the rotor is converted into pressure energy o f the air through the alternate rows o f fixed stator blades and moving rotor blades. The moving blades are root^mounted to the turbine driven rotor; the fixed blades^ which fimction as the diffusers, are attached to the compressor casing. A h is drawn into the compressor intake and enters the first cascade o f moving rotor blades, where its absolute velocity is mcreased. The increase in velocity results from the action o f the rotor blades, which, because o f the applied torque, causes a whhl or rotational velocity to the a h in the dhection o f the rotor

INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW

blade motion. In addition to the gain o f whirl velocity, the divergent shapes o f the passage between the blades results in a small pressure rise.

O n leaving the rotor blades, the air enters the fixed stator blades where the whirl velocity is reduced and a further pressure rise occurs. The air leaves the stator blades with

approximately the velocity it had before entering the moving blades, but at an increased pressure. A set of one ring of rotor blades and one ring o f stator blades is called a stage and a stage pressure ratio is normally about 1.1:1. Due to the practical limit o f the achievable pressure ratio - about 1.5 - o f each stage o f an axial compressor (Bathie, 1996), many stages are necessary to obtain a useful overall pressure ratio. The flow through a compressor will be examined in more detail in Section 2.1.2 o f this report.

1.2.1 ROTATING STALL A n aircraft wing is said to stall when its angle o f incidence is increased to the point where the air no longer flows smoothly over the wing but breaks away from the surface and becomes turbulent. When this happens the lift drops sharply and the drag increases. Rotating compressor blades are subject to stalling in a similar manner if the angle of incidence between the blade and the direction o f the airflow is varied beyond critical limits. A design incidence angle that results in the smallest pressure loss coefficient can be calculated for each compressor cascade. As a general rule during operation the actual incidence angle should only deviate by ▒ ten degrees from the design value, keeping the loss coefficient within an acceptable range of less then or equal to twice the minimum loss coefficient (Aungier, 2003).

Rotating stall is a two-dimensional, local instability phenomenon in which one or more local regions of stagnant flow rotate around the circumference o f the compressor. These cells have a constant rotational speed between 20% and 70% o f the rotor speed. Rotating stall induces large vibratory stresses in the blading, and depending on the stalled characteristics, can result in a large drop in performance and efficiency (Moore, 1984). The reduced flow rates can lead to undesirable thermal loads in the turbine.

FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL OF COMPRESSOR SURGE EN A TURBOJET ENGINE MODEL

Should tho muss flow be reduced when the compressor is turning at low speed, because o f the back pressure from the combustion chamber, stalling will start at the first row o f moving blades and then progress aft. In the event o f a reduction o f mass flow when the compressor is turning at high speeds, a sudden change of aircraft attitude affecting the airflow at intake, a condition can arise in which stalling occurs in the high-pressure stages o f the compressor (Greitzer, 1976).

1.2.2 SURGE Aircraft wings not only have a stalling angle but also a stalling speed; the angle between the airflow and the wing chord line changes with speed, becoming greater as the speed drops. If the air mass flow through a compressor is reduced, the axial velocity o f the air passing through the compressor is reduced accordingly. As the air velocity falls, stalling occurs at some hlade stages and, if the condition is severe, other stages stall in unison and surging results. Surging signifies a complete breakdown o f flow through the compressor.

Surge is characterized by large amplitude fluctuations o f the nominal compressor pressure rise, and unsteady annulus-average mass flow through the compressor. Toward low mass flows, stable operation is constrained by surge. Surge can lead to failure in the system due to large mechanical and thermal loads in the blading and casing. Avoidance o f surge improves maintainability, life span, and the performance o f the compressor.

1.2.3 COMPRESSOR PERFORMANCE MAP In normal operation o f a compressor, the flow is nominally steady and axisymraetrie. The pressure rise is dependent on the speed o f rotation, but the efficient range is limited. As the flow through the compressor is throttled from the d sign point to the stall limits, the steady axisymmetriу flow pattern becomes unstable. This instability ean take on one o f two forms, either surge or rotating stall depending upon the engine speed.

The performance o f a compressor is plotted as pressure ratio versus mass flow for diflУrent rotational speeds as shown in Figure l.I. The plot is divided into two regions by the stall (or surge) line. This line defines the operation limits o f the engine. To the

left of the stall line the flow is no longer steady. In this region large oscillations o f the mass flow rate may occur (surge) or severe self-induced circumferential flow distortions may rotate around the annulus (rotating stall), or a combination of both may appear (Greitzer, 1980).

It is important to know which mode o f instability will occur since their consequences can be quite different. Rotating stall induces large vibratory stresses in the blading that is

unacceptable for structural reasons. In addition, there is a drop in performance and an increase in turbine operating temperature. Surge causes high blade and casing stress

levels as well as possible system failure (Willems et. al, 1998). For low flow regimes, the operating range is limited by surge and rotating stall. For higli mass flow the operating range is bounded by the limited capacity o f the compressor.

MASS FLOW

Figure 1.1 : Compressor performance map As mass flow is reduced the pressure rise increases. A point is reached at which the pressure rise is a maximum and ftirther reduction in mass flow leads to an abrupt and definite change in the flow pattern in the compressor. Beyond this point the compressor enters into either a stall or a surge. Regardless o f the flow instability this point is called the surge point.

1.2.4 SURGE MARGIN Surge avoidance prevents the compressor ftrom operating in a region near and beyond the surge line by preventing the compressor firom crossing the surge margin.

operation can be guaranteed by operating the compressor at a safe distance from the unstable region (avoidance control). In this strategy, a surge margin is defined at some distance below the surge line. The safety margin is set by the sensors and actuator

limitations, and the uncertainty in the location of the surge line. I f the compressor's operating point crosses the surge margin, the controller must compensate quickly by adjusting the current flight settings. According to Cumpsty (1989), in a multistage axial

compressor in a turbojet it is normal to insist on a 25% surge margin,

1.3 BACKGROUND ON COMPRESSOR MODELS An essential step in controller design is to understand the physical phenomena in the system and to develop a mathematical model that describes the most important phenomena. Table 1 provides an overview o f various model properties; one-dimensional models describe axisymmetric flows, while two-dimensional models predict flow variations in both axial and circumferential directions.

The models described m Badmus, et al. (1994) and Botros (1995) start from a general description by applying principles o f conservation o f mass, energy, and momentum for a perfect gas. Both models can be applied to generic compressor systems to describe the dynamic behaviour o f axial and centriftigal compressors during surge. In comparison to the other models studied, these models are relatively complex.

The theoretical compressor model developed by Moore and Greitzer approximates fully developed surge and rotating stall observed in laboratory-scale gas turbines. For dynamic analysis and controller design in axial compressors, the low-dimensional Greitzer, Moore, and Moore^Greitzer models are frequently used. The Greitzer model (1976) can predict the onset o f stall and the Moore model (1984) can foresee the onset o f surge. Moore and Greitzer combined their models (1986) to predict both flow instabilities. The majority o f literature available on compressor modeling refers to this model as a starting point for new developments and variations. For instance Haynes, et al. (1994) introduces the effect o f blade row time-lags to the Moore-Greitzer model to describe the occurrence of higher order rotating stall modes at different mass flows. The Botros and Gravdahl6 of 136

INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW

Egeland (1997a) models incorporate rotor speed variations in order to include spool dynamics in the Moore-Greitzer model. Numerous other variations o f the Moore-

Greitzer model have been developed to contain variable throttle values, bleed valves and actuators.

A: Axial Compressor, C: Centrifugal Compressor, S: Surge, R: Rotating Stall Table 1.1: Overview of compressor model properties Haynes, at al. (1994) showed that rotating stall mainly occurs in low-speed axial compressors, whereas surge occurs at relatively high speeds in axial as well as radial compressors. Although not as common, Fink, et al. (1992) reported results o f rotating stall in radial compressors. The occurring type o f instability can be affected by the plenum volume; rotating stall may result from surge when the size of the plenum is progressively reduced. Also surge may propagate by tlrrottling the compressor to lower mass flows. Both flow phenomena are related and techniques that delay the onset o f one instability is seen to be effective in delaying the other. Instabilities in axial compressors generally are better understood then those in centrifugal compressors and the Moore-Greitzer model has emerged as the workhorse o f axial flow compressor modeling. For these reasons, this model is used later in this report as a black box representation of a jet engine compressor.

, LOGIC CONTROL OF COMPRESSOR SURGE IN A TURBOJET ENGINE MODEL

In the MG model, an incompressible fluid is pressurized m the compressor and is discharged into a closed tank that contains a compressible gas. This tank discharges via a throttle valve into another larger reservoir. The essential elements in the system are the compressor that realizes the pressurization, the inertness o f the incompressible fluid in the compressor and throttle ducts, the mass storage capacity of the system in the closed tank - the plenum - and the throttle, whieh represents the system pressure requirements. This system is analogous to a gas turbine engine, where the plenum is the eombustion chamber and the throttle represents the turbine. The idealized system is shown in Figure 1,2, The Moore-Greitzer model is a shnplifled model o f a single shaft gas tttrbine.

1.4 BACKGROUND ON ACTIVE CONTROL An early publication on active stabilization o f surge is by Ffowcs Williams and Huang (1989), Ffowcs Williams and Huang use a modifled Greitzer model that contains a

movable wall in the plenum. The wall surface is part of a mass-spring system responding to the unsteady pressure fluctuations in the plenum. The surge controller is able to

stabilize the system both before and after surge had occurred. Similar results are also found in Epstein et a l (1989), where control is achieved by the use o f complex valued

Epstein et al. (1989) names several actuators that might also be used to implement their algorithm: unsteady jets or wiggling stators far upstream, wiggling inlet guide vanes and downstream pressure perturbation using loudspeakers or pulsing the combustor. In

Simon and Valavani (1991) and Simon (1993), a close coupled valve (CCV) is the actuator used for active surge control. The pressure drop over the valve downstream of the compressor reshapes the compressor characteristic creating a combined characteristic o f compressor and valve resulting in a stable operating point. The same CCV idea is utilized by Gravdahl (1998) and Gravdahl and Egeland (1997b) where an adaptive control law stabilises a system that undergoes pressure and flow disturbances. Fully automated active control strategies such as opening and closing o f bleed ports either lower the back-pressure, or increase the mass flow rate whenever rotating stall is imminent. Steady bleeding with preset amounts of bleed opening is effective, but can be wasteful. In modem engines with small cores the mass flow rate is already small. Liaw and Abed (1992) relate the amount of bleeding to the stall amplitude such that the loss o f highpressure air through bleeding is minimized. Badmus et al. (1995b) implemented the Liaw and Abed Controller at the Georgia Tech Axial Compressor Facility, and demonstrated that it works successfully.

1.5 BACKGROUND ON FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) can be utilized to avoid flow instabilities. In very

simplistic terminology, fiizzy logic allows situations or problems to be described by linguistic variables rather then precise numeric values. Linguistic variables are adjectives that are used to describe the situation, such as "tall" or "cold". The use o f a linguistic variable frees a given element ffom the rigid traditional set theory. With traditional set theory the element is either completely within the set or completely out o f the set. W ith a fiizzy set, a given element can be partially in a set to a given degree. The degree to which an element is within a set is defined as the element's degree of membership. Elements

are no longer classified using the Boolean zero^oBone logic, with the use o f a membership function an element can have a degree o f membership o f any real number between zero and one (Tanaka,1997).

Using crisp logiCs the definition o f hot water might be water at temperatures above 80«F. By this definition wafer at 70░F would nof be considered to be hot, Using a fuzzy logic linguistie variable, water at 70░F might be said to be warm, or by the use o f a membership function the water inight be said to be hot to a degree o f 0.75.

INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW

The process o f calculating the degree of membership o f a variable relative to its membership function is called the fiizzification process. Clearly it can be seen that more information is contained in the fuzzy definition o f water temperature then the traditional definition. The ability o f fuzzy logic to capture and convey `grey' levels o f truth is one o f the main advantages over conventional Boolean logic. Fuzzy logic is an attractive technique for the control o f poorly understood, unmodeled, or complex systems where the experience of human operators is available to provide qualitative "rules o f thumb" (Lee, 1990). These rule-bases can also be developed from numerical simulations o f mathematical models. Swaminathan, et al. (1997) derived a

fuzzy rule-base from the Moore-Greitzer model and successfully tested it at the Georgia Tech axial compressor facility. The pressure fluctuations upstream o f the compressor w ere measured at three sensor locations and classified into three fuzzy sets: positive, approximately zero, and negative. The fuzzified measurements were then passed through the inference engine, to determine the value of the throttle opening (the opening and closing of a bleed valve). The Georgia Tech compressor quickly experiences rotating stall, when the main throttle opening is reduced to 50% o f the design value. A

combination of passive controller, that modifies the inlet, and the fuzzy controller allowed the system to operate at 40% o f the design throttle setting. When rotating stall did develop in the compressor, the amplitude of the stall with the fuzzy control was found to be much smaller than with other classical control methods.

A particular problem with engine control and nonlinear systems in general, is that the gains o f the controller have to be scheduled over the operating envelope. At each design point, the controller is required to meet a set of performance objectives. A mathematical model that describes the complete behaviour of a system does not exist, and since the control strategy depends strongly on the current operating point, linear PID control models are not suitable (Hindmon, 1998). A reduced order model or complex look-up tables, generated from the results o f extensive testing and an engineer's experience, are the basis for most engine control strategies. The automotive industries o f Japan, Korea, Sweden and France have found success in fuzzy logic engine control as a replacement for the limitations o f reduced order models or the look-up table method (von Altrock, 1997).

FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL OF COMPRESSOR SURGE IN A TURBOJET ENGINE MODEL

CMpperfield, et al. (2002) use fuzzy logic towards improving the performance and simultaneously enhancmg the flexibility o f the control strategy o f a gas turbine aero engine. FLC is used to regulate fuel flow, nozzle geometry and inlet guide vane (IGV) positioning. The resulting controllers where shown to offer improved thnist responses while still satisfying stability and structural design constraints. The fuzzy scheduling system was also able to marginally improve the turbine blade temperature and the surge mafgih while maintainiiig the thrust mapping.

Despite many successes FLC has not been regarded as a rigorous discipline due to the lack of formal techniques that guarantee stability, performance, and robusmess. This is particularly true for flight control applications where certification standards require Я very stringent assessment o f the system qualities and performance (Chipperfield, et al., 2002). Blumel, et al. (1999) evaluated the robusmess o f their fuzzy trajectory controller for a non-linear missile model, showing that it achieved the desired tracking performance with no overshoot and almost no steady state error.

1.5 APPROACH The objective o f the present work is to utilize fuzzy logic control to allow the compressor o f a mrbojet model to operate at close proximity to the stall line, in order to increase compressor performance. A mrbojet engine model is created in MATLAB using velocity triangles to approximate the flow through the multiple stage compressor and mrbine. Various fiizzy logic controllers are implemented via the MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Engine. The fuzzy logic controllers tune variables such as the inlet guide vane positioning, the stator blade stagger angles, the spool speed, and the compressor inlet velocity. Static variables that are commonly not tuned during flight can be mned during these simulations for design purposes. A known surge line is utilized to mne the engine conditions in order to operate at a set surge margin.

Two gas turbine models for surge transients arC also implemented in MATLAB, the Moore-Greitzer model and the Gravdahl and Egeland modified Moore-Greitzer model. The fiizzy logic controller used for these models measures the flucmations in the axial

mass flow coefficient, 0 , and the pressure coefficient, T , across the compressor system. The magnitude o f the fluctuations is normalized and converted into a change in either throttle or CCV gain via a fuzzy membership function. The gains are directly

proportional to tlie throttle or valve opening. This method o f control does not require prior knowledge of the surge line as it reacts upon measurable fluctuations within the compressor.

Finally a fuzzy logic model of a gas turbine compressor that predicts the probability o f flow instability is designed. The compressor is represented by linguistic variables that are expressed as membership functions. The design o f the rule base is discussed and presented in a series of design matrices.

TURBOJET ENGINE MODELING
The first section o f this chapter outlines the six sections o f a turbojet en fin e modeh shown in Figure 2.1. It is assumed that the fiow-fieldproperties are uniform across any cross section and vary only in the flow direction, and thus this is a quasi-one-dimensional flow engine model. Special attention is placed on the engine compressor, as it is the dynamics o f the compressor which is the main study o f this thesis. The evolution o f the Greitzer, the Moore-Greitzer and finally the Gravdahl and Egeland modified MooreGreitzer compressor models are traced in the second portion o f this, chapter. The chapter is concluded with a look at fu zzy logic modeling o f a gas turbine compressor stage.

2.1 TURBOJET ENGINE MODEL Each section o f the turbojet model is contained in its own module. Each module is called from the main program, along with the desired controller algorithm (outlined in Chapter 3), which loops continuously as the engine is m flight. A module that calculates the atmospheric conditions is called at the beginning o f each program loop, if the altitude of the engine is adjusted during the simulation.

All of the user defined variables are defined within the main program. A summary of these user defined variables can be found in the tables at the beginning o f each subsection that focuses on the breakdown o f the engine stages.

2.1.1 INTAIGES AND NOZZLES The purpose of any aircraft gas turbine intake is to provide a sufficient air supply to the compressor at a low subsonic velocity without exhibiting large losses in total pressure for different flight speeds, altitudes, and attitudes. Though the outlined turbojet model would most commonly fly under subsonic conditions, for the sake o f completeness, three variable geometry inlets are modeled for both subsonic and supersonic flight.

FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL OF COMPRESSOR SURGE IN A TURBOJET ENGINE MODEL

To aid the regulation o f the engine thrust, variable geometry nozzles are utilized for this turbojet model. Again, both the converging nozzle commonly found in subsonic flight and the converging-diverging nozzle used for supersonic flight is included.

2.1.1.1 SUBSONIC DIFFUSER INTAKE This simplified subsonic intake is a diffixser with a circular cross-sectional area. The area of the diffuser increases with a linear relation defined by the inlet and exit areas. The area expands in cross-section flom the mouth of the intake in order to difflise the subsonic flow. The model assumes that flow separation will not occur around the inlet lip of the intake. As well, it is assumed that this intake will be free of transonic flow zones associated with Shockwaves and boundary layer problems.

The diffuser intake increases the static pressure and reduces the kinetic energy o f the flow. The geometry o f the intake is shown in Figure 2.2 and the required user defined variables are summarized in Table 2.1.

2.1.1.2 LOW SUPERSONIC PITOT INTAKE This type o f intake generates a strong shock wave (a normal shock) across the mouth of the intake. This intake is designed to fly at transonic Mach numbers not much higher than 1. The flow behind a standing normal shock is always subsonic and thus the intake duct is the same subsonic diffuser intake described in Section 2.1.1.1, I f the flow into

the pitot intake drops below Mach 1 then no shock will occur and the flow enters the diffuser unchanged; and if the flow rises above Mach 1.4, the simulation is halted. While the flow velocity remains within the intake's operation range, it is assumed that the inlet will always generate a strong normal shock wave across the mouth o f the intake that is governed by the following equations for a normal shock (Anderson, 1991):

where the subscript On refers to the state after the normal shock where the now subsonic flow enters the diffuser. For simplicity, the ratio o f specific heats used in the calculations across the shock waves is assumed to be equal to the value used in the diffuser.

2.1.1.3 HIGH SUPERSONIC MULTIPLE SHOCK INTAKE This intake employs a spike center body ahead o f the intake mouth as shown in Figure 2.3. The spike is made up of a series o f adjustable ramps that cause an oblique shock at each ramp junction. The number o f ramp junctions as well as each ramp angle can be defined by the user. In order to guarantee that no separation occurs, the ramp angles must be less than 45.5░ (Anderson, 1991). After the flow passes through the n number of oblique shocks a normal shock will occur at the mouth o f the diffuser and the model will revert to the intake described in Section 2.1.1.2 as the flow will now be subsonic beyond the normal shock. If the flow over the spike is subsonic then the model will revert to the model outlined in Section 2.1.1.1.

the Mach angle as an initialguess and the left-hand sideo f Equation 2.12 iswithin the defined tolerance then the shock angle has been found, If the angle has yet to be found the guess is increased by a defined step size and the equation is retested. Since the Mach angle must always he smaller then the shock angle this step method will always guarantee convergence.

The subscript 0.1 refers to the state after the first oblique shock where the supersonic flow will then pass through either another oblique shock (resulting in state 0.2, etc.) or the normal shock at the mouth o f the diffuser.

2.1.1.4 CONVERGING NOZZLE The cross-sectional area at the nozzle inlet is assumed to be large so that the velocity is negligibly small, meaning that the pressure and temperature at the nozzle inlet are assumed to be the stagnation pressure and temperature and respectively (Bathie,

2.1.2 COMPRESSORS AND TURBINES An axial compressor is made up o f many alternating rows o f rotating and stationary blades called rotors and stators, respectively. The first stationary row (which comes before the first rotor row) is comprised o f the inlet guide vanes or IGVs. Each successive rotor-stator pair is called a compressor stage. Hence compressors with many blade rows are termed multistage compressors.

The rotor adds swirl to the flow, thus increasing the total energy carried in the flow by increasing the angular momentum (adding tP the kinetic energy associated with the tangential or swirl velocity). The stator removes swirl from the flow, but it is not a moving blade row and thus cannot add any net energy to the flow. Rather, the stator converts the kinetic energy associated with swirl to internal energy (raising the static pressure o f the flow). The IGV also adds no energy to the flow. It is designed to add swirl in the direction o f rotor motion to lower the Mach number o f the flow relative to the rotor bladess and thus improve the aerodynamic performance o f the rotor.

The thermodynamics and fluid mechanics for a stage of compressor blades are basically the same for a stage o f turbine blades. For a turbine stage the stationary blade, commonly known as the nozzle, precedes the rotor blade. As well, the relative velocities in an axiah flow turbine are generally substantially higher than in an axial-flow compressor, with a greater change in enthalpy per stage (Dixion, 1998). In the turbine nozzle, the tangential velocity is increased in the direction o f rotation with a corresponding drop in the static
24 01136

TURBOJET ENGINE MODELING

pressure. In the rotor row, the tangential velocity is decreased. Fewer stages are needed for an axial-flow turbine than in an axial-flow compressor because in the compressor the flow is decelerating in the passageways with a corresponding rise in pressure, whereas in the turbine the gas is accelerating. The diffuser action o f a compressor allows for only moderate changes in the compressor passageways to avoid separation (Bathie, 1996).

Velocity triangles are used in the following sections to relate the flow properties through an axial flow compressor with the blade design parameters in the relative ftame (rotating with the moving blades), to the properties in the stationary or absolute frame. It is

assumed that the area of the annulus through which the flow passes is nearly constant and the density changes are small so that the axial velocity is approximately constant.

The same velocity triangles, shown in the following section for a compressor, can be applied to a turbine. If the tangential velocity increases across a blade row (where positive tangential velocity is defined in the same direction as the rotor motion) then work is added to the flow (a compressor). I f the tangential velocity decreases across a blade row (where positive tangential velocity is defined in the same direction as the rotor motion) then work is removed from the flow (a turbine).

2.1.2.1 BLADE GEOMETRY Table 2.3 outlines the user-defined variables required for one stage o f an axial-flow compressor. These same variables are used for one stage o f an axial-flow turbine. It should be noted that flow enters and exits the blades at the flow angles calculated by the velocity triangles outlined in the following subsections. The flow angles are not the same as the blade (or metal) angles which are the actual angles o f the physical structure. These angles must be kept very similar in order to avoid separation o f the flow. This will be dealt with in more detail in Chapter 3. Blade and flow angles are illustrated in Figure 2.4, along w ith the required sign conventions.

2.1.2.2 INLET GUIDE VANES The model contains the option o f adding hilet guide vaUes (IGVs) ahead o f the first compressor stage. The IGVs are a row of stator blades that direct the air flow into the first row o f rotor blades. The IGV blade angle can be set as a constant or can be adjusted. Limits are set on the IGV blade angle╗ 0 to 60 degrees (where 0 degrees represents a blade parallel to the flow, which would not affect the fluid as it passes over). assumed that there are no temperature losses over the IGV stage. Figure 2,6 shows the velocity triangles for the IGV stage. The simulation will halt if the incoming axial air flow velocity entering the compressor from the intake is sonic. It is It is

assumed the flow velocity at the trailing edge of the IGV, Vj, leaves the blade at the blade exit angle. The following trigonometric relationship relates the flows:

2.2 G R EIT ZER COM PRESSOR M ODEL The main advantage of Greitzer's original model over other models at the time was that Greitzer developed a systematic rule for determining wliich instability would occur in the compressor, using Greitzer's B-parameter,

2 m 2 a where U is the mean rotor velocity, m^, is the Helmholtz resonator frequency, Vp is the plenum volume, A^. is the flow-through area, and is the effective compressor and duct

length. Surge tends to occur for high speeds and large plenum volumes where B > and rotating stall tends to occur for lower speeds and smaller plenum volumes when B< . The value for is compressor-dependent.

Referring to Figure 1.2, Greitzer modeled the compressor and mass-flow throttle as actuator discs, assuming low Mach numbers and low pressure ratios compared to ambient conditions. Small inertial forces in the throttle duct are assumed, and the compressor pressure rise is considered to be quasi-steady. The two states o f the model are the

nondimenisionalized mass flow referred to as the axial mass flow coefficient, O , and the nondimenisionalized pressure difference known as the pressure coefficient, T . The mass flow coefficient in this case is the axial velocity parameter, the axial velocity: l U , where is

The pressure coefficient is the pressure difference across the plenum normalized by the density and square o f the blade speed:

Figure 2.10: Stability of the linearized Greitzer Model If 7^ < 0 the system has one eigenvalue in the left half-plane and one eigenvalue in the right-half plane, and the equilibrium state is thus a saddle-point, which is unstable (shown in Figure 2.10a and 2.10c). This t>'pe o f instability is called static by Greitzer. If 7^ > 0 and 7^ < 0 (as seen in Figure 2.10d) the equilibrium state can be one o f two types, dependent on the numerical value of B.

unstable node (static instability). If 7^ > 0 and 7^ > 0 (as seen in Figure 2.10b) the system is stable, and depending on B, will either be a stable focus or a stable node. Whether the instability is dynamic or static, the nonlinear system will go into surge oscillations.

As predicted by the value o f B, an engine is more likely to surge as the speed is increased. Increasing the blade speed leads to an increase in B for the same system parameters, so that a configuration is more likely to surge as the rotational speed is increased. A natural way to account for the number o f axial compressor stages is to use B' = NB where N is the number of compressor stages.

2,3 MOORE - GREITZER MODEL In Moore and Greitzer's later works, Grietzer's model is expanded to include the state J, the square of the amplitude o f angular disturbance o f the axial flow coefficient, 0 . Finite^amplitude rotating stall cannot evolve without producing a finite disturbance in 0 or the total-to-static pressure rise coefficient, T . In the case o f pure surge, when / = 0, the model shown in Equations 2.74, 2.75, and 2.76 reduces to that o f Greitzer's original model for surge. This three-state model is capable of describing the growth o f rotating

stall and surge during a compressor mass-flow transient. W !H ^ _ J _ W JV

2.3.1 IMPLICATIONS OF MOORE GREITZER MODEL For rotating stall, the time derivative vanishes. This occurs when J has the constant equilibrium value; f0 J = J \ = 4 I - ------ 1 iR/- ; 2 2.82

When Je from Equation 2.82 is substituted into the right-hand side of Equation 2.75, the result is the steady performance map arising from Equation 2.78, which may be used to infer the performance effect of rotating stall. In the case of pure surge, j = 0, and once J is zero it will remain zero forever unless the compressor is physically reset.

It appears impossible for rotating stall to evolve without producing some disturbance in 0 or Y . I f J changes then the model shows that 0 or must also change. The

Яhgular-disturbance amplitude J grows at a rate which initially depends only on the disturbance itself, but then tries tO approach the equilibrium position in Equation 2.82. The model shows that pure modes o f surge (time variation) or rotating stall (angle vatiatioh) cati exist without the other. fluctuations are coupled. However, ih general the time and angular

The angular variation grows towards a time dependent

equilibrium, while the damping rate o f any time variation depends on the strength o f the angular variation.

2.4 GRAVDAHL AND EGELAND CCV MOORE GREITZER MODEL The approach of active surge/stall control is to use feedback to stabilize the unstable regime of the compressor map. It is common to use bleed valves as surge avoidance actuators, The compressed high energy in nominal bleed-off operation is not wasted in aircraft engines, as it is utilized by other aircraft systems. Unscheduled bleed-off may however result in some lost energy. By stabilizing an unstable area o f the compressor map using feedback, one allows for compression operation in the peak efficiency and pressure rise regions located in the

40 Of 136

TURBOJET ENGINE MODELING

neighbourhood o f the surge line. Active control broadens the operating range o f the compressor by effectively shifting the surge line and the surge avoidance line, thereby enabling the machine to now operate in regions that were previously unreliable (de Jager 1995). A close coupled valve (CCV) incorporated into the present engine model

represents this active bleed control capability.

The CCV has a characteristic given by;

2.83

where /,, > 0 is CCV gain which is proportional to the valve opening. The pressure rise across the compressor is modified according to:

Greitzer 5-parameter; as discussed earlier, a small value for B results in rotating stall, and a large B gives surge.

2.5 FUZZY LOGIC COMPRESSOR MODEL The two states of the MG model, the axial mass flow coefficient, 0 , and the pressure coefficient, T , can be simplified down to the three variable and measurable quantities which they are based upon; blade speed [rpm]; axial velocity [m/s]; and pressure ratio across the stage. With these three values a three-input, one-output model can be created to predict the probability of flow instability (either compressor surge or rotating stall) using a fuzzy logic model. The operating ranges o f the inputs are summarized in Table 2.5, and the operating range of the ftizzy output, being the probability o f a flow instability, is summarized in Table 2.6. The basis o f selection for these values come from the operation of the above turbojet and compressor models.

This type o f modeling requires a working knowledge o f the system. The more empirical data availabie on the operation o f a particular compressor tire better, as the prograrnrner will have a better picture for comparison as the fuzzy model is adjusted during creation.

2.5.1 CREATING THE MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS A membership function is a curve that defines how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value (or degree o f membership) between 0 and 1. The

function itself can be any arbitrary curve whose shape can be defined as a funetion that suits the problem. A more advanced discussion on membership functions can he fotmd in Chapter S. For this example model, triangular membership fiinctions are defined for each classified CategOi-y o f input and c .rput. The base o f each triangular membership function rests on the intervals o f each category, and the apex o f the triangle is located above the midpoint o f the interval. The membership functions for blade speed and the probability of a flow instability are plotted in Figure 2.12 and Figure 2T3, respectively.

2.5.2 CONSTRUCTING THE RULE BASE For the case of a three^input and one^output modef the rule base can be constructed by creating two matrices o f options and solutions, The first matrix is based on the mass flow

TURBOJET ENGINE MODELING

coefficient, where as a guide line 0 should be within the range o f 0.4 and 0.7 (Archer, 1996). The input variable axial flow velocity is along the top o f the matrix and the input variable blade speed along the side (see Table 2.7). The entries in the matrix are the desired response of the system, or in this case the probability o f surge or rotating stall. The second matrix utilizes the work coefficient as a guideline, predicting safe operation if the coefficient is kept within the range o f 0.35 and 0.5 (Archer, 1996). The pressure ratio is across the top of this matr ix and the blade speed is along the side, and once again, the entries in this two-by-two matrix are the probabilities o f either surge or rotatmg stall occuning.

Figure 3.1: Fuzzy control logic flowchart A fizzy rule is created by combining various fizzy statements to form the premise and the consequence of the rule. A fizzy rule appears no different than an ordinary rule; however, the difference arises when clauses take oh partial truths. These partial truths are evaluated based on the membership function. This value, referred to as the rule alpha^ is used to indicate the significaiice o f the rule and the significance o f the consequence. A rule that is not completely true will still be able to convey information toward the final outcome. A collection o f these fuzzy rules makes up the rule-base for the decision

makmg processor. Traditionally, these assembled rules are designed such that no two contradicting rules are true. However, m fizzy logic it is common for a multiple o f rules to take on non-zжro values (degrees of truth). A fe r the variables have been passed

FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLERS

The standard method o f creating a fuzzy control system involves identifying and naming the fuzzy inputs and outputs, creating the fuzzy membership functions for each, constructing the rule base, and then deciding how the action will be carried out. A

collection o f these fuzzy rules makes up the knowledge base of the decision-making processor, shown earlier in Chapter 2.

3.1.1 FUZZY SETS The purpose o f a set is to single out its elements from those in its domain. The

relationship between two sets has two possibilities, either they are partners merged in a larger entity or the relationship consists o f the elements that they have in common. Sets that are partners are called disjunctions or unions. The union o f A and B, denoted

as vf u .B, is defined to be the set o f all elements within A and B. In the fuzzy world, this partnership expresses the maximum value for the two sets involved. The intersection o f A and B, denoted as A n B , is defined to only the set o f elements that are found in both A and B. In the fuzzy world a conjunction is expressed as the minimum value for the two fuzzy sets. Fuzzy rules are either `and' or `or' rules, where `and' rules set the rule alpha value to the maximum value o f the set while the `or' rule defines the rule alpha value as the minimum value o f the set. By using the `or' rules, the increase in step size o f the gain is smaller so that it will reduce overshoot that was more commonly found when using the `and' rules. In classic set theory (see Figure 3.2) A - > B is read as A implies B. Therefore i f A is true it is inferred that B is also true or vice versa. I f A is false, then A -> B implies B is false. Now, let A and B be sets of fuzzy numbers. In fuzzy logic A ^ B is interpreted as A is contained in B and B is true i Ь A > B . The statement ^ A (not A) or A^' (compliment o f A) in both crispy and fuzzy logic is defined as all elements in the domain that are not in the set of In crisp logic A ^ 'U A would contain the entire domain while A^ n A is

impossible since both sets are mutually exclusive. In fuzzy terms A^ u A = max(v4` ^, A ) , which would not contain the entire domain and A^ n A = rmn{A'^ ,A ) is possible and would not be equal to an empty set. The differences between fuzzy and classical set theory are summarized in Table 3.1.

3.1.3 FUZZY INFERENCE AND DEFUZZIFICATION ThУ prOcУss of interpreting Я fuzzy logic rжsuit involves first the fUzzy inference step followed by the process known as defuzzification. The two rnost cornmon inference methods are thж "max-min" inference method and the "max-dЗt/prЗdЧct^suih" inference method, and the most common defuzzification method is the "centroid" defuzzification. For simple cases the two inference methods will produce the sarne results^ but in complex situations can produce drastically different results; (Tanaka, 1997)

To illustrate the differences in the above methods, the following simplistic Rule Base and membership functions Will be utilized: IF (x is hot) AND (y is large) THEN (z is fast) If
(x

is warm) AND (y is large) THEN (z is slow)

3.2 SPOOL SPEED CONTROLLER The first fuzzy controller was developed to adjust the spool speed with respect to the airspeed (the axial flow velocity entering the inlet) and altitude. A third input variable can be added to incorporate the desired thrust, and thus increase the spool speed to increase the thrust output. As the input values vary, the spool speed is varied accordingly by the fiizzy logic controller.

The fuzzy logic controller is provided with normalized input values for both the airspeed and the altitude. The simulated altitude is normalized over the specified maximum

aircraff ceiling which is inputted by the User. The aXial-flow velocity is normalized over the maximum allowable velocity that is based upon a user-selected Mach number. The controller outputs a scaling factor from 0 to 1 which is multiplied by the maximum allowable spool speed. 3.4 The maximum allowable spool speed is calculated by solving the compressor tip speed at a given maximum Mach number:

When modeling membership functions it is often easier to start with simple symmetric triangular functions for the controller inputs aS seen in FigUrC 3.7, along with the uSC o f a straightforward one-to-one rule base as shown in Table 3.2. The sensitivities o f the

controller can be adjusted by massaging the output membership functions to achieve the desired control surface (seC Figure 3.8).

controller that will govern spool speed with respect to all o f the previously mentioned aspects.

Figure 3.10 expresses the acceptable range of the mass flow coefficient as membership functions.

3.3 IGV AND STATOR BLADE ANGLE CONTROLLERS The design angle o f attack o:,, defines the near-optimum inlet flow angle for the blade cascade. An empkical model by Aungier (2003) based on the design charts of Herrig et al. (1957) for NACA 65-series blades was developed to calculate this design value:

P in

^" %

The design incidence angle for each cascade is related to the design angle o f attack by the following relationship, whCrв К is the blade stagger angle (Horlock, 1982):

Using Lieblein's (1960) correlation, with all angles in degrees, an iterative solution can be used to compute the design incidence angle with the following:
i ^ K^,^K^.ig+nO

n = 0.025g - 0.06 -

^ 1.5 + 0.43(7

3.13

Separation is liable to occur if the incidence angle is more than ▒10░ different then the design incidence angle (Archer, 1996). The difference between the simulated actual

incidence angle and the design incidence angle becomes the input to the FLC:
e ,. =

.. . / -I

3.14

The output o f the FLC is the amount in radians that the IGV must be adjusted. The iterative nature of Lieblein's correlation works well within the loop o f the sirnulatioh model. With each simulation step, one iteration of Lieblein's correlation is calculated, and then the FLC is called to adjust the IGVs, which results in a new flow angle and a smaller difference between the design and actual incidence angle.

As before, a one-to-one rule base is used for this controller: if the error term is negative then a large positive adjustment occurs in the IGV; if the error term is about zero then a

small adjustment occurs in the IGV; and if the error term is positive then a negative adjustment occurs in the IGV. The same triangle membership functions shown in Figure 3.7 are utilized for both the input error term and the output term; the only difference being the domain has been changed to [- 1 , 1 ] ^ order to compensate for situations where the design incidence angle is smaller than the actual incidence angle.

3.3.2 ADJUSTABLE IGV TO OPERATE AT DEFINED REACTION The degree of reaction for a compressor is defined as the ratio o f the static enthalpy increase across the rotor to the increase in static enthalpy for the stage. When the degree o f reaction is 0.5, the increase in static enthalpy is evenly divided between the rotor and stator. This configuration is optimal for the present application, as it will minimize the tendency o f the blade boundary layer to separate. Using the velocity triangles defined in Chapter 2, the degree o f reaction can be defined as (Horlock, 1982);

R' = 0 .5 - ^ [ t a n

+ tan /3,^y ]

3.21

The FLC outlined in Section 3.3.1 can be used to adjust the IGV in order to achieve a degree of reaction o f 0.5. Now the inputted error term will become:

62 df 136

FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLERS

e = 0 .5 - R '

^

The deHaller number is a measurement o f the amount o f diffusion, noting that both the rotor and stator act as diffusers. I f the rate o f diffusion is very slow, the blade length becomes excessive, resulting in large friction losses, and if the rate o f diffusion is very large, boundary layer separation may occur (Harman, 1981). Based on the velocity

triangle compressor model outlined in Chapter 2, the deHaller number can be calculated as follows:

deH = ^

3.23

Many designers use 0.707 as a target deHaller number (Cumpsty, 1989). Once again, the same methodology described above can be used to tune the deHaller number o f a compressor stage.

3.3.3 STATOR CONTROL AT DESIGN INCIDENCE ANGLE
Stator blades can be treated the same as inlet guide vanes with respect to the two controller examples above. Either the stator blade turn angle, , can be adjusted, or the

entire stator blade can be rotated, hence adjusting the stagger angle, ^ , o f the blades. These controllers can be run simultaneously on the IGVs and the stator blades o f any stage.

3.3.4 COMBINATION CONTROL
The controller outlined in Section 3.3 can be run in parallel with any combination o f the abovementioned controllers. Now the IGVs are tuned to simultaneously meet more then one condition (shown in Figure 3.15a). A natural middle ground is found where all the conditions are partially met according to the condition weighting. A multiple-input FLC can be used in place o f running the controllers in parallel; as shown in Figure 3.15b, any number of error values can be passed to the fuzzy logic controller, which will output a change in the IGVs.

3.5 ACTIVE SURGE CONTROLLER This controllei uses the same feedback-loop fuzzy decision-making method as the abovementioned controllers. The goal of this control is to show that engine operation can occur along the surge line, as any disturbance that pushes the operation point into the surge region will be quickly corrected.

This method of control requires knowledge o f the surge line, and for this example a generic quadratic surge Ime is defined as follows for the design work coefficient:

By lowering the y-intercept in Equation 3.24 a surge margin can be placed on the abovementioned defined surge line, both the surge line and margin fine are plotted in Figure 3.17. An upper and lower bound is required for the mass flow coefficient, 0 . The

second controller outlined in Section 3.2 will be run for this example, to obtain the desired limitations on the mass flow coefficient.

, must be raised. The IGV

whirl, Wj, will change proportionately to the IGV angle, and W 3 can be adjusted by changing the rotor turn angle (this can be tuned in the simulation, but is not commonly done in practice).

From Equation 2.39 the whirl velocity across the IGV can be expressed in terms o f the axial velocity and the IGV angle:
Wg = v , t a n y ^ c y 3 .2 7

Combining Equations 2.44, 2.46, and 2.47, the whirl velocity entering the stator cascade can be expressed in terms of the blade speed, the axial velocity, the flow angle entering the rotor stage and the rotor turn angle:

Substituting Equations 3.27 and 3.28 into Equation 3.25 yields the following relationship for the work coefficient:

Ц

67 of 136

FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL OF COMPRESSOR SURGE IN A TURBOJET ENGINE MODEL

Equations 3.29 and 3.30 illustrate that the work coefficient is dependent on the rnass flow coefficient, the IGV blade angle, and the rotor turn angle. As previously mentioned, the mass flow coefficient will be governed by the controller outlined in Section 3.2, leaving the need for a FLC that will update the IGV angle and the rotor turn angle.

3.5.1 IGV SURGE C O N TR O L In this section, a FLC is created using only the IGVs as the actuators for active surge control. The need to oversee the rotor and stator blade incidence angles (in order to avoid stall as seen in Section 3.3T) is still a major concern. The avoidance of surge is given a heavier weigliting, and thus the FLC will settle at an operating point that best meets the surge conditions while staying within the larger allowable boundaries for the stall condition. The MF for the incidence angle error term^ e,, from Equation 3.14 is shown in Figure 3.18. The IGV is only altered if the flow entering the rotor blade is in danger o f separating or more specifically if \e\ > 6 ░. Figure 3.19 shows the two-dimensional plot of the control surface created by the first two rules from the following rule base:

IF ( e, is NEGATIVE) THEN ( IF {e. is POSITIVE) THEN

3 .3 1

IF ( gy is NEGATIVE) THEN ( Ayg^^r is LARGE INCREASE) IF (gy is ZERO) THEN (Ayg^or is ZERO) IF (gy is POSITVE) THEN ( Ayg.^^ is DECREASED)

The work coefficient error e thus has more weight in the settling position o f the IGV blades. If the work coefficient error is negative, then the system has crossed over into the surge region, and the IGV angle is quickly increased. If the work coefficient error is positive, then the system is working safely below the surge line, and the IGV angle can be slowly decreased. The lower limit of the IGV angle will be dictated by the incidence angle error.

Figure 3.18: MF for incidence angle error for IGV surge controller This non-symmetrical controller is created by combining non-symmetrical membership functions shown in Figures 3.20 and 3.21. The output MF contains one trapezoid MF which will slew the results quickly to the positive side if the work coefficient error becomes negative. The trapezoid MF in FLC input creates the step increase seen in the control surface (see Figure 3.22) as e becomes negative. In comparison, the gentler

slope, as e becomes positive, is created by using an open-ended Gaussian membership function. In both cases, if jg^j > 0.4, the maximum displacement for the IGV results; this range is set by the base of the triangular MF in the FLC input.

The triangular MF in the FLC input is required to settle the error term to zero. Any shift o f the triangle's apex will result in a shift o f the same magnitude of the controller's final settling point for the error value. The same relationship is found in shifting the apex of the central triangular MF in the FLC output with respect to the final settling point of the IGV displacement (both apexes are located above the zero, resulting in an equilibrium point of zero IGV displacement at a zero error).

3.5.2 IGV AND VARIABLE ROTOR GEOMETRY CONTROL Thж IGV positioriing is often restricted by stall that occurs over the rotor blade. By intfoducing variable gebmetry to the rotor blade, the blade can be turned into the flow, reducing the limitations caused by stall, while increasing the operation range o f the IGVs. A second FLC is created to run simultaneously with, yet independently oft the controller outlined in Section 3 A . L This second controller is only concerned with rotating the rotor blade into the air flow and thus setting the incident angle and the deviation angle to the design value as outlined in Section 3.3. Just like the stator blade shown in Figure 3.1, the rotor blade can be rotated as a whole by altering just the blade stagger angle and keeping the turn angle constant, or by altering both the inlet and outlet blade angle independently and thus altering the rotor turn angle. As seen in Equations 3.11 and 3.17, altering the rotor turn angle results in changing both the design incidence angle and the design deviation angle. The sarne design strategy used in Section 3-3 to manoeuvre the IGV is applied to the rotor blade.

3.6 DETECTION/AVOIDANCE CONTROLLER This control does not require any knowledge o f the compressor characteristic. Instead, the controller analyses the fluctuations of the axial mass flow coefficient, A O , and

pressure coefficient, A'F . The response of the MG model is drawn upon for modeling the control system. Increasing the control gains will stabilize the system, however, at a penalty of pressure lost across the system.

The fluctuations of the axial mass flow coefficient, A O , and pressure coefficient AT are normalized before being sent to the FLC as the crisp input by the following:

Triangular membership functions were defined for each classified category o f input and output as shown in Table 3.3. The base of each triangular membership function rests on the intervals of each category, and the apex df the triangle is located above the midpoint of the interval.

The effect of altering the IGV to correct the rotor incidence can be seen in the flow entefhig the stator stages thus creating a slight overshoot in the stator uieidenee error. This overshoot can he seeft In Figure 4.9, which plots the actual change of the stator angle.

4.1.4 COMBINED CONTROL In this example^ the two controllers run concurrently^ both the rotor .)lade incidence angle FLC and the defined rate o f reaction FLC. Since both controllers use the IGV as an actuator there is a very low probability that both conditions can be met. instead what results is a compromise as both conditions are partially met. Figure 4.1Q shows that the rotor incidence angle error is reduced to Within approximately one-third a degree and Figure 4.11 shows the degree o f reaction is reduced to Within 10% of the desired goal.

4.3.2 IGV AND VARIABLE ROTOR GEOMETRY This simulation tunes the rotor blade angles in order to free up the limitations that stall places on the IGVs. The change in the IGV angle is plotted in Figure 4.14. Since the system is operating at a safe distance from the surge margin, the FLC first takes care of the threat o f blade stall by adjusting the rotoi blade geometry and the IGV. Since the mass coefficient was held constant, the resulting system behaviour plotted against the compressor characteristic is a straight line from the starting point to the surge margin, as shown hr Figure 4.15.

After the adjustment are made to avoid blade stall, the IGV finetunes the work coefficient enor to a zero value as seen in Figure 4.16. Convergence of the incidence and deviation angles begins to occur around the 60*'' time interval as seen m Figure 4.17 and Figure 4.18 respectively. The change in velocity triangles and blade geometry is illustrated in Figure 4.19, and more detailed results from this simulation are summarized in Appendix A.

Figure 4.20 shows the change in the work coefficient error value, which turns negative at the 50**' time step. The system's behaviour is plotted against the compressor characteristic in Figure 4.21. First the controller is pushing the compressor slowly towards the surge margin line, then after the disturbance occurs, the FLC quickly brings the system back to a safe operating point along the surge margin line.

This simulation relies on the IGV to bring the system out o f the dangerous surge region. Figure 4.22 shows the plot of the IGV changing over time. Also included are the plots of the incidence and deviation angles o f the rotor blade in Figure 4.23 and Figure 4.24, respectively. More details from this simulation are summarized hr Appendix A.

4.4 DETECTION/AVOIDANCE CONTROLLER The results of two simulations are presented in this section. The first is the MG model without a CCV, and the second simulation is the MG №nЗdжl with the CCV. For both simulations the value o f J, the squared amplitude o f rotating stall, has been set to zero. The Greitzer parameter E = 1.8, and the throttle gain has been set so that the intersection of the throttle line and the compressor characteristic is located on the part o f the characteristic that has Я positivж slope, resulting in an unstable equilibrium (pure surge). The numerical values used in the simulations are listed in Table 4.2. Figure 4.25 shows the response o f the system before the controller was switched on and after the controller was switched oh at tiihж %= 1ннн. BжfЗrж thж controller was switched on, thж ihЯss flow and the pressure coefficients are fluctuating with a regular period and amplitude, and thus the system is surging.

Both simulations pushed the design point along the compressor characteristic until it reaches a stable operation point without overshooting a stable equilibrium point. An overshoot o f the equilibrium point Would result in a pressure loss across the throttle or CCV; The gains are tuned back down towards the initial stable operation point in the case o f overshoot. The optimal operating position is where the throttle characteristic intersects the compressor or equivalent compressor characteristic at a position just right of the maximum value o f the compressor characteristic (slope o f compressor characteristic is negative).

Figure 4:26 is a plot o f the compressor and throttle characteristics in the first simulation: Initially the throttle gain was set to 0.41 which causes the plot o f the throttle characteristic to cross into the unstable region o f the compressor characteristic. The FLC has tuned the throttle gain up to the value o f 0.63 which places the intersection point to the right o f the maximum value o f the compressor characteristic. The surge cycle is also plotted in Figure 4.26. The cycle begins at the intersection o f the initial throttle

characteristic and the compressor characteristic where the flow becomes unstable. It then jumps to the reverse flow characteristic on the negative side o f the flow axis causing the mass flow to flow in the reverse direction. The cycle then jumps back to the compressor

FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL OF COMPRESSOR SURGE IN A TURBOJET ENGINE MODEL

5.1 SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS A fuzzy logic controller was developed for active surge and stall control o f a compressor iri a turbojet engine model with the objective of allowing the compressor to operate at close proximity to the stall line, in order to increase compressor performance. A turbojet engine model was created in MATLAB using velocity triangles to approximate the flow through the compressor. The actuator surfaces Used in the controller are the inlet guide vanes, movable stator blades, and variable spool speed, and for design purposes, in thж simulation, the rotor blade geometry is also variable.

Also, the stability Яiid cЗhtrOl o f the Moorж-Grжitzжr inOdel, and GrРvdЯhl and ╦gelРiid's close coupled valve active controller are examined. The MG model and the modified MG model are used as black boxes to create a surge detection and avoidance fuzzy logic controller that does hOt require a surge line. The controller responds tO the flUctUatiOiis hi the axial mass flow coefficient and the pressure coefficient across the compressor system, and adjusts the throttle characteristic or the close coupled valve characteristic in order to obtain a stable operation point.

The controllers make use o f nonsymmetrical membership functions in order to create nonlinear and continuous control surfaces for usage at all operating conditions. The ease with which fuzzy logic can be adapted to these problems is demonstrated through the ability to allow one or more control surfaces to be simultaneously controlled by one or multiple inputs is established.

5.2 CONCLUSIONS The main benefit of a fuzzy logic controller is the simple way in which a nonlinear and continuous control surface can be created. The instability problem o f surge and rotating stall is dependent on the simulated compressor's operation point, thus requiring a controller with the ability to reaOt differently to the various operating conditions. Most noteworthy are the following three situations: when the operation point crosses the surge margin into the surge region; when the operation point is well below the surge region; and when the operation point is just below the surge margin.
96 of 136

CONCLUSIONS

Section 4.3.2 illustrates a situation where the simulated compressor is working well below the surge margin. In this situation the IGV angle is primarily adjusted to ensure that stall will not occur over the stator blades with the secondary objective o f raising the operation pomt towards the surge line. Simultaneously the rotor blade inlet angle and turn angle is altered to assure the stall will not occur across the rotor cascade, with the secondary objective o f raising the operation point. Figure 4.15 shows the system's

operation point, plotted against the compressor characteristic, successfully reaching then stabilizing on the surge margin with zero overshoot. Figure 4.17 and Figure 4.18 are plots o f the incidence and deviation angles, respectively, across the rotor cascade. Clearly from these plots no separation will occur across the rotor blades as both error values are kept well within the ▒ 1 0 ░ range.

The same FLC that was used successfully in Section 4.1.1, to avoid stall across the stator blades, was applied in Section 4.3.2 to keep the rotor blades from stalling. An additional benefit o f FLC is the ease with which controllers can be used for multiple applications, thus drastically cutting development time. Amother example o f controller capability is the three-dimensional control surface developed for the spool speed control in Section 3.2, which in turn was used for the detection/avoidance controller described in Section 3.6.

A decrease m axial velocity that pushes the operation point across the surge margin occurs in the simulation noted in Section 4.3.3. The plot o f the work coefficient error in Figure 4.20 shows the error beginning to level off as it approaches zero before the disturbance occurs at the 50* time interval. As shown in previous simulations such as presented in Section 4.1.1 and Section 4.1.3, the rate o f change o f the control surface is maximized when the inputted error variable is large but will gently decrease as the error value approaches zero (see Figure 4.3). The spool speed is continuously monitored,

before and after the disturbance occurs, by the control surface shown in Figure 3.13, to assure that the mass flow coefficient remains within the desired range. Figure 4.22 shows the immediate increase of the IGV angle as the simulation crosses the surge margin; again, the plot illustrates the nonlinear qualities o f the FLC as the rate o f change o f the IGV angle lowers to zero as the work coefficient error approaches zero, hence leading to

zero overshoot. Thж FLCs successfully bring the shnulatioЧ back to Я stable operating point along the surge margin while avoiding stall over the rotor and stator blades. Therefore, this active surge control approach escalates the potential for increasing the efficiency of the compressor. Since the FLC can quickly recover from excursions into the surge region, the simulation can operate at a close proximity to the surge line.

The surge detectioti atid avdidaiice approach, avoids the drawbacks o f the loosely defined surge line. The MG models rely on a defined sUrge line; hOwжvжr, thж FLC treats the MG models as a black box compressor models. The FLC controller is based exclusively on the fluctuations o f the pressure arid mass flow coefficients. The first simulation, without the CCVi begins operation at (Oo^'P(,) = ( 0 .6 ,

this simulation the CCV gain and the throttle gain are adjusted to bring the system to a new operation point, at a much lower mass flow coefficient, that could not be reached in the first simulation. The addition o f the CCV successfully extends the operation range o f the compressor simulation. In both simulations the fuzzy logic controller successfully brings the system oUt of surge to a stable operation point.

Fuzzy logic control is concepmally easy to understand. The visual namre o f the MFs and rule base allows for Я trial and error approach that allows the User to massage the MFs iri order to generate a desired control surface. The flexibility of such an approach allows for simple alterations in the controller in order to quickly adjust to the needs o f various situations, without starting again ftom scratch.

Complex control problems were broken down into combinations o f simple fuzzy logic controllers and these controllers were then layered; this approach was firequently adopted in this thesis. As welh this thesis demonstrates that fuzzy logic can model nonlinear functions o f arbitrary complexity by virtue o f MF adjustment. With respect to mrbojet

CONCLUSIONS

engine control, via fuzzy logic the gap between the surge margin and the surge line can be closed, since both the simple velocity triangle and Moore-Greitzer models were able to rapidly recover from disturbances that pushed the system beyond the surge line. Using this detection and recoven/ strategy, the drawbacks o f the loosely defined surge margin were avoided.

5.3 FUTURE W ORK The next step in this body o f work would be to implement these controllers on a real working model. The approach o f the active controllers is not limited to turbojet engines, and could be easily applied to other systems. With regards to the detection/avoidance controller, more research is required into the area o f modeling pressure and mass flow sensors. The main challenge is to create a fuzzy logic controller that can decipher sensor noise from subtle pressure and mass flow fluctuations associated with surge.

As a learning tool, it would be beneficial to organize these turbojet engine modules and FLCs with a user interface that would allow students to easily witness the controllers in action.
