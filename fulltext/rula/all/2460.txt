ABSTRACT

T H E R M A L L Y IN D U C ED D EFO R M A TIO N S IN N U C L EA R FU E L ELEM EN TS By: H aihui (Stella) Yang M aster o f A pplied Science in the Program o f M echanical Engineering, Ryerson University, 2004

N onlinear three-dim ensional m ultibody surface-surface contacts, therm ally induced deform ations, and the curvature transfer factor in C A N D U fuel elem ents are investigated using the finite e lem ent m ethod in this thesis.

A N SY S is selected to obtain num erical solutions for C A N D U fuel elem ents under several operating conditions. In the A N SY S m odels, the 20-node structural elem ents (SO LID 186) are em ployed to m esh individual solids; the surface-to-surface contact pairs (T A R G E 170 and C O N T A 174) are used to handle contacts betw een solids. Sensitivity studies on the curvature tran sfer factor are conducted for several key operational param eters.

If there is full radial contact betw een the pellets and the sheath, a C A N D U fuel elem ent m ay be considered as a com posite beam because o f the large length-to-diam eter ratio. The T im oshenko beam theory is used in conjunction w ith a three-node beam elem ent to explore the thermal deform ation behaviors o f a fuel elem ent. A program w ritten in M A T L A B is m uch m ore efficient com pared w ith the A N SY S solutions.

During operations, the temperature in the pellets may vary circumferentially because of the neutron flux depression and non-uniform heat transfer coefficient across the pellet-sheath gap. As a result, the pellets bend. Since the radial gap between the sheath and pellets is very small, the thermally induced bending in the pellets may be transferred to the sheath. Thus, the whole fuel element may bend. Figure 1-3 shows fuel element bending in a fuel bundle. The bending behavior in a fuel element should be explored to prevent the fuel element from contacting with the pressure tube enclosing the fuel bundle.

Fuel element bending in a fuel bundle

To assess the am ount of a fuel elem ent bending caused by the pellet bending, a curvature transfer factor (C TF), defined as the ratio of sheath curvature to the pellet curvature, is used in the C anadian nuclear industry to assess the degree at which a pellet can im pose its curvature on the sheath.

C ontact problem s are nonlinear as the actual contacting surface, and the stresses and displacem ents on the contacting surface are all unknow n prior to the solution o f the problem . C onsequently, contact problem s involve system s of inequalities or nonlinear equations. In general, it is difficult to obtain exact analytical solutions to the nonlinear equations. In the nuclear industry, bending and contact problem s in C A N D U fuel elem ents were investigated. Tayal (1989) developed the B O W code using the com posite beam theory to calculate the bending o f a fuel elem ent due to tem perature gradients, hydraulic drag force and gravity. Suk et al. (1995) investigated therm ally induced bow ing o f C A N D U fuel elem ents em ploying a generalized and explicit analytical m ethod. X u (2000) used an annulus type o f three-dim ensional finite elem ent for solving therm om echanical and pellet-sheath contact problem s in a nuclear fuel elem ent. In this thesis, m ultibody contacts are analyzed w hile m odeling radial contacts betw een the sheath and pellets, as w ell as axial contacts betw een the neighboring pellets and betw een the end pellets and the end caps.

and contact behaviors of CANDU fuel elements. Three-dimensional finite element models having various initial radial and axial gap sizes are created, for which symmetry conditions are considered as possible to simplify the modeling. The 20-node structural finite element (SOLID 186) is employed to mesh all solid components of a CANDU fuel element - pellets, sheath and end cap. The SOLID 186 element is a high order three-dimensional structural solid element supporting thermal stress analysis, and it is suitable for meshing irregular geometry. Temperature is the only driving force for fuel element expansion and bending. Non-uniform temperature loads are applied directly on the finite element nodes via input tables.

The potential contact areas are large in a CANDU fuel element. The entire sheath inner surface may be in contact with all pellet outer surfaces; end surfaces of each pellet may be in contact with its neighboring pellets. The surface-to-surface contact pairs consisting of TARGE 170 and CONTA 174 are built to model the interactions between the pellets and sheath, and between the neighboring pellets. CONTA 174 is applicable to three-dimensional coupled thermal-structural contact analysis. Real constant FKN is used to define a normal contact stiffness factor. A smaller value provides easier convergence but with more penetration. The stiffness factor has to be adjusted to avoid convergence difficulties or too much penetration. Real constant FTOLN, defined as a tolerance factor, is applied in the normal direction of the surface. The value for this factor is based on the thickness of the element. Contact compatibility is satisfied if penetration is within a clearance of the value FTOLN multiplied by the depth of the underlying solid element. Initial contact conditions, such as closing the gap, reducing initial penetration, or either closing

the gap o r reducing initial penetration, have to be adjusted at the beginning o f the analyses to ensure that the contact pairs are in contact in the initial geom etry. For the contact algorithm , the direct penalty m ethod is em ployed to form ulate the contact conditions, and the m ost attractive reason is that additional iterations can be avoided.

T hree sim ple test cases are conducted for sim plified m odels involving only one or tw o pellets to validate the A N SY S m odels. R adial contact pressure, radial displacem ent, axial contact pressure, axial stress and pressure betw een tw o neighboring pellets are calculated based on the uniform tem p eratu re in pellets and sheath and a concentrated force applied on end cap. An analytical solution for bending o f a com posite beam is derived to further validate the finite elem ent m odel.

W hen there is full radial contact betw een the pellets and the sheath, a C A N D U fuel elem ent m ay be considered as a com posite beam for which a num erical solution m ay be obtained using the finite beam elem ents. In this case, a M ATLAB code is developed to deal w ith the therm ally induced deform ations o f a fuel elem ent. A series o f sensitivity studies is perform ed for situations involving a m issing pellet at various locations. The T im oshenko beam theory is em ployed in com bination w ith a three-node beam elem ent to enhance the accuracy o f com puted values.

A ssessm ent o f bending o f nuclear fuel elem ents can help dem onstrate the integrity o f fuel and o f surrounding com ponents under norm al operating conditions. The sensitivity studies conducted on geom etric and operational param eters show w hich param eters are the m ain factors affecting
5

bending. The FE results obtained in this thesis provide some guidance to the Canadian nuclear industry concerning how much bending of pellets due to circumferential temperature gradients gets transferred to the sheath through contacts.

2.1 Sim plification of a Fuel Elem ent
In m odeling a fuel elem ent, the follow ing assum ptions are made: 1) 2) 3) All m aterials are isotropic; Initial radial and axial gaps are uniform everyw here in a fuel elem ent; T em perature distribution is sym m etric w ith respect to both the fuel elem ent m idplane and the vertical plane, and the sam e for every pellet; 4) Friction betw een tw o contacting surfaces is negligible.

From the above assum ptions, the deform ations o f all com ponents in a fuel elem ent are sym m etric w ith respect to the fuel elem ent m idplane. H ence only a q u arter o f a fuel elem ent is m o d eled as show n in Figure 2-1.

2.3 Solid Model Development
A quarter of a fuel element model consists of 15 solid cylindrical pellets, a hollow sheath and an end cap. To simplify the contact problem, fuel element details such as pellet chamfers and dishes are not modeled. The end cap is represented by a solid cylindrical disk where a diameter is the same as the outside diameter of the sheath and an equivalent thickness is used. The end cap is brazed to the sheath. A portion of the simplified model is shown in Figure 2-3.

2.5 Solution Techniques
In A N SY S, the linear algebraic equations generated by the finite elem ent procedure are solved using a direct elim ination process or an iterative m ethod. Two direct solvers are available: the S parse D irect Solver and the Frontal (W avefront) Solver. The Sparse D irect Solver m akes use of the fact that the finite elem ent m atrices are sparsely populated. This sparseness allow s the system o f sim ultaneous equations to be solved efficiently by m inim izing the operation counts. Iterative (preconditioned conjugate gradient (PC G )) solvers include Jacobi C onjugate G radient (JC G ) and Incom plete C holesksy C onjugated G radient (ICCG).

A direct elim ination process is prim arily the use o f G aussian elim ination to solve for the unknow n vector o f variables {«} in the follow ing equation:

[ ü:]{ m} = {F}

(2.1)

w here [AT] is the global stiffness m atrix; {«} is the global displacem ent vector; and {F} is the global load vector.

T he direct elim ination process involves decom position o f the m atrix [ k \ into low er triangular m atrix [ l ] and u p p er triangular m atrix [l] and

[u],

that is [AT] = [l1[17] , then forw ard and back

substitutions using

[U] to com pute the solution vector {u } . E quation (2.1 ) is

subjected to contact conditions.

11

A typical iterative method involves an initial guess of the solution vector {«}, and then successive steps of iteration lead to a sequence of vectors such that, in the limit, tends to infinity. The calculation of = {wjas n

involves [/T], {F} and {«} vectors from one or two

of the previous iterations. Typically, the solution converges to within a specified tolerance after a finite number of iterations.

M ULTIBO DY CONTACTS IN A CANDU FUEL ELEM ENT

In this chapter, A N SY S is used to analyze m ultibody contacts in a C A N D U fuel elem ent. T he solid m odel developm ent and m esh generation are the first two steps for the finite elem ent form ulation. A fter the m odel is m eshed, the analysis procedure includes: (i) using

surface-to-surface contact elem ents to create contact pairs; (ii) em ploying tem perature-dependent m aterial properties o f the pellets, sheath and end cap assem bly; (iii) prescribing tem peratures in all solids; and (iv) applying appropriate boundary conditions. T o prevent any potential m istakes, th e International System o f U nits (SI) is used in the FE m odeling.

3.1 A nalysis Procedure
O nce the m odel is m eshed, the contact pairs are built to sim ulate interaction betw een tw o contacting surfaces. Target and contact surfaces form a contact pair. C onstraints and loads are applied directly into the finite elem ent nodes.

T he T A R G E 170 and C O N T A 174 contact pairs show n in A ppendix are used as the contact elem ents because (i) they can m odel curved surfaces; (ii) they are com patible w ith the high-order solid elem ents used to m esh individual solids; and (iii) they perm it large sliding betw een tw o contacting surfaces. In the FE m odels, all potential contact surfaces are m odeled using contact elem ents T A R G E 170 and CO NTA 174. A total o f 30 contact pairs are created to m onitor radial
13

contacts between the pellets and the sheath, as well as axial contacts between the neighboring pellets. During the analysis process, normal contact stiffness factor (FKN) is specified at each load step to ensure the FKN is large enough so that the contact penetration is acceptably small; and allowable penetration tolerance (FTOLN) values can be adjusted, a too small value may cause nonconvergence of the global solution.

Appropriate boundary conditions ensure that all FE model components are properly constrained, and all rigid body motions of components are avoided. Symmetry boundary conditions are applied to all symmetric planes. The end cap is used to restrain the displacement of the fuel element in the radial direction. The central node of the end cap has its radial degree of freedom constrained. For the FE model involving neither initial radial gap nor initial axial gap, no nodes on the pellets are restrained to avoid any singularities during the solution. However, axial contact does not occur in models involving axial gap. As a result, each pellet has a rigid body motion mode in the axial direction. To eliminate the rigid body motion, the axial degrees of freedom of pellet centra] nodes are constrained.

In this thesis, the temperature and the temperature gradient in the pellets are the only driving forces for fuel element deformations. The temperature distributions applied on the fuel element are given in Table 3-1.

3.2 Validation of FE Models
Three FE models are first created to validate the feasibility of the structural solid elements and the surface-to-surface contact elements. The FE results obtained from the three models are verified against independent analytical solutions.

3.2.1 Test of Radial Contact
Figure 3-3 shows a two-dimensional view of a three-dimensional idealized model. One pellet and its surrounding sheath are involved in this model, hence only the radial contact is concerned. Initial radial gap is set to be zero.

The temperatures are

=T ^^j. +800°K in the pellets and 7] = 7}^ in the sheath. Contact occurs

when the pellet experiences uniform thermal expansion. Due to the pellet uniform expansion in the radial direction, the contact pressure is uniform in the circumferential direction.

Test of radial contact between pellet and sheath

An analytical solution for the radial contact pressure and radial displacement of the sheath with infinite length was derived by Xu (2000). It is used here to validate the ANSYS models.

16

F rom F igures 3-4 and 3-5, it is seen that radial contact pressure betw een the p ellet and sheath, as w ell as the radial displacem ent o f the sheath at r obtained from A N SY S is in good

agreem ent w ith the analytical solutions. H ow ever, there is som e discrepancy in the m agnitude betw een the A N SY S and analytical solutions. This m ay be attributed to the fact that analytical solution is obtained for an infinitely long cylinder.

A s show n in Figure 3-5, therm al expansion in the pellet end regions is larger than that in the pellet m idplane regions. This hourglassing phenom enon causes a ridging effect on the sheath, and the design o f the cham fer in the pellet is to avoid this unfavorable effect. T he sam e trend as in F igure 3-5 is also found in Figure 3-4 for radial contact pressure.

3.2.2 Test of Axial Contact
A two-dimensional view of an idealized FE model is shown in Figure 3-6. In this test case, the initial radial gap and initial axial gap are all set to be zero. The temperature in the pellet is Tp = +50°K, and in the sheath is . It is further assumed that i) the middle plane of

the second pellet is constrained in the z direction; ii) the radial contact as well as the axial contact between two pellets is neglected; iii) a very rigid end cap, whose material modulus of elasticity 84.1xlO*GPa is present. Therefore, in this model, only the axial contact between the second pellet and the end cap is involved. When the second pellet expands in the z direction, the axial contact occurs.

The test results for the aforementioned three test cases all agree very well with the analytical solutions. The FE models, in conjunction with the 20-node structural solid finite elements and the surface-to-surface contact pairs, can be used to efficiently and accurately solve the thermomechanical and multibody contact problems in a CANDU fuel element.

This is consistent with the radial displacement and radial contact pressure distributions. Due to uniform expansion of the pellets, at the bottom inner surface of the sheath, the values are identical for the radial and axial stresses, respectively.

Figure 4-8 compares thermally induced bending in a fuel element when the pellets experience a temperature gradient AT across the pellet diameter. Figure 4-9 shows the relationship between the maximum bending and the AT. Values of AT used in the analyses are 50°K, 100°K and 150°K. The average volume temperature in the pellets is 343.15°K. The temperature in the sheath is = . It is noted from Figure 4-8 that the larger the value of AT, the more significant

the bending. Thus, the bending of a fuel element is sensitive to the magnitude of AT. From Figure 4-9 it is observed that the maximum bending is in linear relationship with the AT.

In the case w hen a fuel elem ent experiences therm al bending, the radial and axial stress d istributions at the top and bottom inner surfaces o f the sheath are co m p ared in Figures 4-10 and 4-11. T hese distributions in the sheath reflect the stress variations for the pellets stacked end-toend. In this analysis, AT = 50°K , Tg= 343.15°K , and 7]. = 7}^ , and the tem perature increases linearly along the pellet diam eter from top to bottom , so the top is the colder surface, and the bottom is the ho tter surface.

It is seen from Figures 4-10 and 4-11 that the radial and axial stresses at the sheath bottom surface are larger than those in the top surface due to dow nw ard bending o f the fuel elem ent. As show n in F igure 4-10 for radial stresses, som e variations are noted for each segm ent distribution, w hich verifies that bending instead o f uniform expansion occurs.

O nce the finite elem ent m odel is created, it is possible to p redict the bending o f a fuel elem ent under a variety o f therm al loads. As a result, operating condition lim its can be established to ensure that the am ount o f bending is acceptable.

4.3 Bending o f a Com posite Beam
U nder certain conditions, a fuel elem ent m ay be considered as a single straight com posite beam for w hich an analytical solution can be easily obtained. T he key assum ption is that gaps everyw here m ust be initially zero and rem ain zero after the application o f therm al loads. A ssum e initial radial gap and initial axial gap are all zero.

From Figure 4-14, it can be seen that there is excellent agreement between the two sets of results. For this special fuel element model, the fuel element axial length is much greater than the radial diameter, and the fuel element is straight and has constant cross sections, so the fuel element may be treated as a composite beam. Therefore, the analytical solution can be derived easily to validate the ANSYS fuel element model.

CURVATURE TR A N SFER FACTOR CORRELATION

T he curvature tran sfer factor (C TF), defined as the ratio o f sheath curvature increase to the pellet curvature, is used to quantify the am ount o f pellet bending transferred to the sheath. The C T F value depends on m any geom etric and operational param eters. It varies betw een zero (no interaction betw een the pellets and sheath) and a lim iting value (< 1 ) w hen there is full contact everyw here.

In this chapter, the geom etric and operational param eters affecting C T F value are identified and ranked according to their im pact on CTF. Sensitivity studies on key geom etric and operational param eters are conducted, and C T F curves for different operating conditions are presented.

5.1 Param eters Affecting CTF

5.2 Sensitivity Studies 5.2.1 Initial Pellet-Pellet Axial Gap
Figures 5-3 through 5-5 present comparisons of radial displacement in the hotter inner surface of the sheath, and Figures 5-6 through 5-10 show comparisons of radial stress distribution in both colder and hotter inner surfaces of the sheath for 7^= 343.15°K, A7' =50°K, and initial pellet-pellet axial gaps are 0, 0.05mm and 0.1mm, respectively. For the FE models involving

36

axial gaps, th eir stress distributions are m ade up o f tw o figures; one show n in Figure 5-1 contains nodes contacting w ith central nodes o f each pellet, and the other show n in Figure 5-2 includes nodal points having interaction w ith tw o end side nodes o f each pellet.

To investigate the effect o f axial contact on the CTF, the axial gap is introduced so that it is large enough to avoid any axial contact. For the FE m odels involving the axial gap, the pellet therm al bending m o m en t can only get transferred to the sheath through pellet-sheath contact.

Subsequently, the am ount o f bending in the fuel elem ent is very sm all, w hich causes a sm aller radial stress com pared w ith the m odel w ithout the axial gap. T herefore, the initial pellet-pellet axial gap plays a significant role in the C TF value.

37

Results shown in Figures 5-4 and 5-5 indicate that the deflections of a fuel element with axial gaps of 0.05mm and 0.1mm are almost identical. This indicates that the global bending behavior is not dependent on the axial gap under non-axial contact conditions. Moreover, it is noted that the local bending is captured, and this is because of the zero radial gap between the sheath and pellets and non-zero axial gaps between the neighboring pellets.

Consistent with the radial displacement, the radial stress distributions are almost identical for the finite element models without the axial contact, as shown in Figures 5-7 through 5-10. The stress values in the colder inner surface of the sheath are smaller than those in the hotter inner surface for the central nodes, whereas for the end side nodes, the situation is converse.

5.2.2 Initial Sheath-Pellet Radial Gap
Sensitivity studies on initial sheath-pellet radial gap are conducted on two finite element models involving zero initial pellet-pellet axial gaps, and initial sheath-pellet radial gaps are
0

and

0.005mm, respectively. For both models, 7^ is 443.15°K, and A T is 50°K. Figures 5-11 and 5-12 show the radial displacement in the hotter inner surface of the sheath, and Figures 5-13 and 5-14 present comparisons of the radial stress distribution in the colder and hotter inner surfaces of the sheath.

The radial displacement decreases with increasing radial gap, as the pellets cannot come into tight contact with the sheath because of the pellet-sheath gap. Due to the small difference in magnitude of the radial gap, the difference in displacement is not significant between Figure 5-11 and Figure 5-12.

42

In F ig u re 5-14, the stress distributions show a decreasing trend. T he pellet-sheath m echanical interaction is low w hen the radial gap is present. As a result, under the assum ptions that self-w eight and friction are negligible in order to reduce the com plexity o f the m odel, the initial radial pellet-sheath gap m ust be lim ited to a much sm aller value than suggested in the nuclear industry (0.04m m ). M oreover, the tem perature 7^ should be high enough to ensure strong pellet-sheath contact m ay occur.

R adial stress distribution for radial gap 0.005m m m odel

5.2.3 A v e ra g e P e lle t V olum e T e m p e ra tu re Tw o finite elem en t m odels involving average axial gaps 0 and 0.1m m are taken as sensitivity study exam ples. In both o f the m odels, the initial radial gaps are zero. Figures 5-15 through 5-24 show com p arisons o f deflection and stress distribution w hen the pellets experience a different average volum e tem perature T^. In this study, the circum ferential tem perature gradient in the pellets, A T , is held constant at 50°K.

W hen To increases from 3 4 3 .1 5 °K to 393.15°K , as show n in Figures 5-15 and 5-16, and from 393.15°K to 493.15°K , as seen in Figures 5-19 and 5-20, it is observed that the deflection increases slightly. T his indicates that bending is not very sensitive to Tq .

45

As compared in Figures 5-17 and 5-18, as well as in Figures 5-21 through 5-24, it is noted that the stress for the two individual models rises by a large value with the increase of Tq. Thus, it indicates that stress is sensitive toTg.

Figures 5-17 and 5-18 also show a drastic change in stress in the sheath area close to the end cap. This is because the initial radial and axial gaps are zero everywhere. Hence, the effect of the end cap on the stress is large.

5.2.4 T e m p e ra tu re G r a d ie n t A cross P ellet D ia m e te r T his sensitivity study is conducted on FE m odels w ith axial gaps o f 0 and 0.1m m . T he radial gaps are zero for both m odels. Figures 5-25 through 5-28 present com parisons o f deflection and radial stress distribution when 7^ is kept the sam e at 343.15°K and A T varies from 50°K to 100°K. F igures 5-29 to 5-34 show deflection and radial stress distribution com parisons, for w hich is held at 4 9 3 .1 5 °K and A T increases from 50°K to 200°K .

Observing results o f the tw o independent m odels, it can be seen that the deflection increases iignificantly w ith A T and stress is not sensitive to A T .

51

As shown in Figure 5-28, for the special model involving neither initial radial nor initial axial gap, when AT is 100°K, the bending is too much so that the first pellet keeps away from the sheath after deformation, the stress on the sheath is thus low in the segment having interaction with the first pellet. Reasonable initial pellet-sheath radial gap (0.04mm) and initial pellet-pellet axial gap (0 . 1 mm) are therefore suggested in the nuclear industry to make sure a fuel element can be operated under various temperature conditions.

A sensitivity study on the temperature gradient across the pellet diameter provides the range of A T . For the FE model involving the non-axial gap, AT ranges from 50°K to 100°K; for the FE model with the axial gap of 0.1mm, AT can reach a maximum of 200°K.

5.3 C urvature Transfer Factor Curve
T h e C T F is defined as the ratio o f the sheath curvature to the independent pellet bending curvature. F o r the single pellet pure bending, it is assum ed that there is no transverse shear force along its section. As the pellet bends due to a sym m etric therm al load, plane sections rem ain plane but rotate relative to each other. Figure 5-35 illustrates a finite elem ent m esh for the bending o f a single pellet caused by the tem perature gradient. Since the pellet cross-section only rotates w ithout w arping, the slope o f the cross sectional plane is constant, w hich m eans that the axial deflection due to bending is linear. T he axial strain m ust also vary linearly w ith zero value at the neutral axis.

57

Figure 5-35

Single meshed pellet pure bending

Three sets of CTF curves are obtained and shown in Figures 5-36 through 5-38. The first two sets are conducted on a FE model involving neither initial radial gap nor initial axial gap, so that both radial and axial contacts are included. For the first set, the temperature gradient AT is held constant at 50°K; and for the second set, the average volume temperature in the pellets Tq is a constant of 343.15°K. As a comparison, the third set is tested on a FE model involving an average axial gap of 0.1mm, so no axial contact is involved. The temperature gradient AT is held constant at 50°K for this model.

Radial contact pressure is dependent on average pellet volume temperature. As shown in Figures 5-36 and 5-38, if the radial contact pressure is small, the pellet bending moment can only transfer a little to the sheath. Therefore, the CTF value is small. Due to the axial contact, the CTF values in Figure 5-36 are larger than those in Figure 5-38. For the FE model with both the radial and
58

axial contacts, the C T F values are alm ost identical with the increasing A T , as show n in Figure 5-37.

Bending curves and stress distributions for four fuel element models having various initial radial and axial gap sizes are described in this chapter. As average sheath-pellet radial contact pressure and average pellet-pellet axial contact pressure vary with four key parameters - initial pellet-pellet axial gap, initial sheath-pellet radial gap, average pellet volume temperature, and temperature gradient across pellet diameter, hence the contact pressures are not investigated independently. From the CTF curves, it is noted that under certain contact pressure, the CTF values change significantly with the contact pressures.

In dealing with thermally induced bending of a fuel element and the fuel element having one pellet missing at various locations, as shown in Figure 6-2, the finite element method and the Timoshenko beam theory are used. The equivalent thermal bending moment is applied directly to the corresponding beam element nodes. The displacement continuity and force equilibrium conditions across the interface where two different substructures are joined together can be satisfied.

6.2 N um erical Results A typical fuel element contains 30 pellets. When investigating the thermal bending behaviors of a fuel element with one pellet missing at various locations, the bending moment (obtained in
66

C hapter 4 for com posite beam bending) is applied on each pellet except the place w here the p ellet is m issing and only the sheath is left, because the pellets are used to transm it bending m om ent. In this analysis, AT is chosen as 50°K.

T he b en ding deform ation is obtained and com pared in Figure

6

- 6 . T he stars in the figure denote

the location s o f the m issing pellet. It is observed that w hen there is one pellet m issing, the defo rm atio n is less than that o f a fuel elem ent with no pellet m issing; w hen the location o f the m issing p e lle t m oves from left to the m iddle, the bending deform ation reduces gradually.

7.1 C onclusions
T hree-dim ensional finite elem ent analyses o f C A N D U fuel elem ents are carried out using A N SY S and M A TLA B in this thesis. These analyses involve investigations on three-dim ensional therm om echanical, large-scale m ultibody contact and curvature transfer factor problem s. C ontact pressures, stresses and displacem ents are determ ined based on the given tem perature profiles applied on fuel elem ent m odels. Therm al bending behaviors for a fuel elem ent are obtained and com pared.

T hree idealized FE m odels involving one or two pellets are first created to validate the radial contact, axial contact and contact pair betw een tw o pellets. The m odels are verified against three independent analytical solutions for pellets subjected to different loads and constraints. T he test results d em onstrate the feasibility o f A N SY S and the m odeling techniques.

An analytical solution concerning bending o f a com posite beam is derived and com pared with b e A N S Y S solution for a fuel elem ent involving neither initial radial gap nor initial axial gap. The k ey assum ption for this case is that gaps everyw here m ust be initially zero and rem ain zero after the application o f therm al loads. G ood agreem ent betw een the A N SY S and analytical solutions is observed.
69

The CTF values obtained under various operational conditions provide some guidance concerning the amount of bending of pellets due to temperature gradients that is transferred to the sheath through contacts. CTF curves demonstrate the trend of CTF values varying with radial contact pressure. Under certain contact pressure, the CTF values change significantly with the contact pressures. After the radial contact pressure increases to a certain value, the CTF curve becomes smooth.

Series of sensitivity studies on the curvature transfer factor for several key geometric and operational parameters - initial radial gap and initial axial gap, average pellet volume temperature and temperature gradient - show that initial axial gap and circumferential temperature gradient are the major factors affecting bending. Initial pellet-sheath radial gap is small to avoid too much slippage between the pellets and sheath. Bending is not sensitive to the initial radial gap due to its small value, and high pellet-sheath mechanical interaction may still occur. Sensitivity studies also show that ANSYS is applicable to some special situations, converged results are failed to yield in some situations when larger radial gaps are involved or large circumferential temperature gradients are applied on the fuel element model with zero gaps everywhere.

The Timoshenko beam theory, in conjunction with a three-node beam element, is used to analyze thermal deformation of a fuel element with one pellet missing at various locations. The results show that when there is one pellet missing, the deformation is less than that of fuel element with
70

no p ellet m issing. W hen the location o f the m issing pellet m oves from left to the m iddle, the bending deform ation reduces gradually.

7.2 Future W ork
F uture d ev elopm ent o f the fuel elem ent m odel m ay include the p ellet hourglassing phenom enon to m odel pellet dishes and cham fers, as well as friction betw een pellets and sheath to investigate larger initial radial gaps.

1. SOLID186 Structural Finite Element As shown in Figure 1, SOLID 186 is a high-order structural solid element, which permits displacements to vary in complete quadratic polynomials within the element. Each element node has three degrees of freedom; translations in the nodal x, y, and z directions. The SOLID 186 elements also allow for thermal stress analyses. These capabilities enhance the degree of accuracy and the rate of convergence for computed displacements, stresses and contact pressures.

2. Surface-to-Surface Contact Pair The surface-to-surface contact pair consists of 3D 8 -Node surface-to-surface contact element (CONTAI74) and target element (TARGE170), as shown in Figure 2. For rigid-flexible contact, the target surface is always the rigid surface, and the contact surface is the deformable surface.

CONTA 174 surface-to-surface contact element

CONTA 174 is applicable to three-dimensional analyses of coupled thermal and structural contact, and it has the same geometric characteristics as the solid or shell element face with which it is connected. Contact occurs when the element surface penetrates one of the target segment elements TARGE 170 on a specified target surface.

Two contact algorithms, the penalty method and the augmented Lagrange method, are available in the ANSYS program. The latter is an iterative method, which takes series of penalty updates to find the exact Lagrange multipliers. To avoid using additional iterations, the direct penalty method is employed in this thesis.

Normal contact stiffness factor (FKN) needs to be specified for each contact pair. The amount of penetration between the two surfaces depends on this stiffness. Higher stiffness values decrease the amount of penetration but can lead to ill-conditioning of the global stiffness matrix and convergence difficulties. Ideally, FKN should be large enough so that the contact penetration is acceptably small. The results are sensitive to the magnitude of FKN when using the direct penalty method. FTOLN is used to calculate allowable penetration, which is a

75

factor based on the thickness of the element. FTOLN values can be adjusted; a too small value may cause nonconvergence of the global solution.

Contact detection points, as shown in Figure 3, are located at the Gauss integration points of the contact elements. Use of Gauss integration points provides more accurate results than the Newton-Cotes/Lobatto nodal integration scheme, which uses the nodes themselves as the integration points. The contact elements are constrained against penetrating into the target surfaces at its integration points. However, for target surfaces, they can, in principle, penetrate into the contact surfaces.

In static analyses, rigid body displacements often occur when a body is only restrained by contact. Initial contact conditions are adjusted at the beginning of the analyses to ensure that the contact pairs are in contact in the initial geometry. The following techniques can be performed; i) closing the gap; ii) reducing initial penetration; iii) either closing the gap or reducing initial penetration.
