Volumetric Properties of Stone Mastic Asphalt Mixtures Containing Tear Off Shingles

M. Nawaz Panhwer Master o f Engineering, 2004 Department o f Civil Engineering Ryerson University

ABSTRACT

Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) is a tough, stable, rut-resistant mixture that relies on stoneto-stone contact to provide strength and a rich mortar binder to provide durability. The design o f an SMA is critical in providing an aggregate grading that will be compatible with the high bitumen content that provides durability without binder drainage. This project investigates the use o f tear-off shingles in SMA to produce economic mixtures. The mixture containing shingles were compared to control mixes (without shingles), but with fibers at the same level as those mixtures containing shingles. As per Superpave method o f mix design all mixes met the air void ratio at N (design) and N (m ax). SMA Mixtures were tested using Marshall Method for stability and flow. Mix design results showed that all required volumetric properties can be achieved with lower binder content if shingles can be added to SMA mixes. The critical property in SMA (the draindown) was controlled and the tensile strength ratio was improved by using tear-off shingles.

Chapter 1 Introduction
This project focuses on developing Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) Mix designs that comply with the requirements o f Ontario Provincial Standards Specifications. The developed mixes intended to reduce the cost o f construction and be more durable and stable in terms o f rutting and fatigue resistance. At the beginning, it is important to introduce the importance o f highways for the development o f our society.

1.1 Why we need Highways
The need for basic transportation is common to all nations, cultures and times. When ancient Rome ruled the western world, its broad highways crossed the empire, carrying Roman law and civilization to its territories, and local commerce to its markets. Economic growth depends upon roads to connect people and resources, but development o f the automobile in the last 100 years has greatly accelerated the worldwide need for good roads. Most modem highways are now built o f asphalt concrete and cement concrete, rather than stone and packed earth, and today's paving equipment is powerful, efficient and modem. Good engineering have always been important in building roads. A design engineer considers alignment, gradient, and drainage as well as materials and workmanship in a roadway project. The highways constmction depends upon materials and their percentage of mixing. The asphalt concrete mix design is the combination of: a) Aggregates b) Asphalt Cement (Binder) The economical blend o f aggregates and asphalt that meet the requirements is called as mix design, in other words the object o f mix design is to optimize the properties o f mixture with respect to the strength, durability, flexibility, fatigue resistance, skid resistance, permeability and workability. The importance o f formulating a mix design cannot be overstated. Design specifications generally do not name materials, proportions or methods. Rather, a specified road must meet predetermined criteria for the finished pavement; these may include strength, flow, air voids, and most recently, rut-value requirements. The formula is usually worked out

and tested before hand in an engineering laboratory, so that the completed road will meet the specified criteria when it is constructed. Each criterion o f the design is measured with standardized, accepted procedures. There were two methods of mix design initially but at the present time there are three methods o f mix design. There are Hveem method o f mix design, Marshall Method o f mix design and Superpave method o f mix design. The main differences in these three methods are the way o f compaction. Battered by weather and increasing traffic loads, asphalt concrete pavements throughout the world are wearing out much sooner than expected. The result o f rough pavements can cause higher maintenance and rehabilitation expenses and more temporary work zones that slow traffic and endanger workers and motorists. The solution is to build asphalt pavements to hold up better under the weather and traffic conditions found at each project site. That's where the Superpave system comes in.

1.2 Purpose and Scope of Project
This project focuses on investigating the potential use o f tear off shingles in stone mastic asphalt mixtures. Mix design will be performed according to Superpave method o f mix design and to meet the requirements o f Ontario Provincial Standard specifications Special Provision No. 313S45M May 2002

1.3 What is Stone Mastic Asphalt?
Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) is a tough, stable, rut-resistant mixture that relies on stoneto-stone contact to provide strength and a rich mortar binder to provide durability. Stone Mastic Asphalt technology was developed in Germany and has been used for over 20 years in Europe and Japan. [19] It produces higher quality pavements, which are less susceptible to deterioration and rutting. The technology entails the mixing o f aggregate material (sand and stone) with asphalt cement in a form, proportion and manner different from conventional pavement mixes. The major differences are that the asphalt cement content is higher and all aggregates are crushed and graded according to sizes before the mixing operation. Stone mastic asphalt mixes have a higher proportion o f coarse

aggregates (stones) as opposed to fine aggregates (sandy material) than do conventional mixes. Although it is a relatively new mix type in North America over 3 million tons have been placed since 1991. The estimated 20-25 percent increase in cost is more than offset by the increase in life expectancy o f the mix, primarily through the decreased rutting and increased durability. SMA is considered to be a premium mix by several state Departments o f Transportation for use in areas where high-volume traffic conditions exist and frequent maintenance is costly. The design o f an SMA is critical in providing an aggregate grading that will accept the high bitumen content that provides durability without binder drainage.

Conversely an aggregate design that requires a lower binder content to prevent binder drainage will result in a bituminous mixture that will be less durable and have a reduced life. Miller Group constructed the first application o f Stone Mastic asphalt in Ontario in 1990 at Miller Avenue Markham Ontario.

1.4 Material Selection
Material selection in Superpave method o f mix design is more important than other methods. All properties depend on materials selection. The aggregate properties played the integral role in overcoming permanent deformation (rutting). Fatigue cracking and low temperature cracking were less affected by aggregates characteristics. The Marshall and Hveem methods o f mix design do not incorporate aggregate criteria into their procedures. In Superpave method o f mix design it identifies the two categories o f aggregate properties that needed to be used in the Superpave system: physical properties and source properties. Selection o f high quality materials for SMA is essential to attain high quality performance and durability. For binder selection in Superpave method the Performance grade specifications are intended to predict pavement performance. . Determine asphalt properties that will affect the performance o f Stone mastic asphalt. Performance should be related to the general pavement behavior, such as rutting, stripping, fatigue cracking, and thermal cracking.

Chapter 2 Literature Review

2.1 SMA verses Conventional mixes
Stone mastic asphalt (SMA) is gap-graded hot mix asphalt that is designed to increase deformation (rutting) resistance and durability by using o f stone-on-stone contact o f aggregates. Therefore rut resistance depends on aggregate properties than asphalt binder properties. Since aggregates do not retain as much as asphalt binder under load, this stone-on-stone contact greatly reduces rutting. SMA is generally more expensive than a typical dense-graded HMA (conventional) because it requires more durable aggregates, higher asphalt content and, typically, a modified asphalt binder with fibers. In proper way it should be cost-effective because o f its increased rut resistance and improved durability Contrary to SMA, dense-graded mix is a graded HMA mixture intended for general use. When properly designed and constructed, a dense-graded mix is relatively impermeable. Dense-graded mixes are generally referred to by their nominal maximum aggregate size. They can further be classified as either fine-graded or coarse-graded. Fine-graded mixes have more fine and sand sized particles than coarse-graded mixes. Figure 1.1 provides the difference between Stone Mastic Asphalt and dense-graded conventional mixtures. An open-graded HMA mixture is designed to be water permeable (dense-graded and SMA mixes usually are not permeable). Open-graded mixes use only crushed stone (or gravel) and a small percentage o f manufactured sands.

2.1.1 Advantages of SMA
Mostly SMA benefits include wet weather friction and lower tire noise (due to a coarser surface texture) and less reflective cracking. Mineral fillers and additives are usually added to reduce asphalt binder drain-down during construction. [14] In general SMA have the following advantages: 1. SMA can be considered a standard, high quality, improved performance surface course mix in Ontario. 2. A successful SMA technology has been already developed and used in Ontario.

3. Field performance in Ontario to date shows superior frictional resistance, rutting resistance, fatigue resistance, and noise reduction for SMA surface courses. 4. Life-cycle cost analysis indicates that, despite the higher initial costs for asphalt pavements with SMA surface course, the reduction in deformation and cracking is such that the SMA pavement alternative is very cost effective for major routes with high performance requirements.[25] 5. SMA mixes can be produced and placed using available high quality materials and conventional equipment. 6. Both SMA and Superpave mixtures have been shown to be rut-resistant even when placed on high traffic volume facilities. 7. Much o f the observed cracking, especially load-related cracking, appeared to be more related to problems other than mix design or material properties (such as underestimating traffic volumes, or using less than the normal 20-year pavement design life) o f the surface courses. 8. SMA mixtures can be expected to last longer than Superpave mixtures before reaching the same condition level. 9. Several o f the Superpave and SMA projects are still in excellent condition after being in service for 5 and 9 years, respectively. 10. SMA mixes may significantly reduce the propagation rate o f reflective cracking.

2.1.2 Features to be considered for SMA
Following points to be considered for SMA mixtures: 1. Stone mastic asphalt mixes are more expensive in term o f cost 2. Adding fibers are very critical in asphalt plants 3. SMA is binder rich, if the use o f vibrating roller results in bitumen "flushing up" then operates without vibration. Compaction without vibration means using a larger dead-weight roller to achieve acceptable compaction 4. To allow effective placement and compaction, it is most important that temperature loss is minimized during transport and storage. The high bitumen content o f mixtures means that, provided material temperatures remain high enough, compaction is relatively easy 5. Fat spots are one o f the most objectionable occurrences in SMA mixtures 6. Because SMA mixes have a high asphalt binder content (on the order o f 6 percent), as the mix sits in the HMA storage silos, transport trucks, and after it is placed, the asphalt binder has a tendency to drain off the aggregate and down to the bottom - a phenomenon known as "mix draindown". Adding cellulose or mineral fibers to keep the asphalt binder in place usually combats Mix draindown. Cellulose fibers are typically shredded newspapers and magazines, while mineral fibers are spun from molten rock. A laboratory test is run during mix design to ensure the mix is not subject to excessive draindown. [10]

2.1.3 Use of SMA on Intersections
Stone Mastic asphalt has an improved rut resistance and durability. Therefore, SMA is almost exclusively used for surface courses on high volume intersections.

2.2 Mix Design
The object o f mix design is to optimize the properties o f mixture with respect to the strength, durability, flexibility, fatigue resistance, skid resistance, permeability and workability.

2.2.1 Approaches to proper design of SMA mixtures
Proper material selection and mix design to be considered the key factors to succeed with SMA. In the mix design o f Stone Mastic Asphalt before 1991, all the agencies were using the Marshall method o f mix designing but after that every agency tried to get their mix design with Superpave mix design criteria. [23]

This review covers the Superpave method o f mix design. The design process for Stone Mastic Asphalt involves adjusting the grading to accommodate the required binder

content and voids content rather than the traditional design process for other asphalt mixes, o f adjusting the binder content to suit an aggregate gradation. Only crushed aggregates are specified for the Stone Mastic Asphalt to ensure suitable aggregate interlock. The use o f natural aggregates containing polished or rounded particles, such as sand, is not permitted. As Stone Mastic Asphalt relies on stone-to-stone contact to provide its strength and a mastic mortar rich in binder, stabilizing additives are needed in the mastic in order to prevent the binder from draining down into the mix. [9]

2.2.2 Evaluation of Stone-on-Stone contact in SMA Mix
To obtain optimum resistance to rutting it is believed that stone-on-stone contact in the coarse aggregate portion o f the SMA mixture is desired. In the past stone-on-stone contact has been very subjective and has only been evaluated by visual observation from cored samples. Voids in mineral aggregates (VMA) and voids in coarse aggregates (VGA) should be calculated for the compacted samples. Voids in coarse aggregates to be calculated by replacing percent o f aggregates in mix (used in VMA calculations) by percent o f coarse aggregates in the calculations. To measure the VGA with no fine aggregates, the coarse aggregate was placed in a container and dry rodded to maximum. The aggregates were rodded when the container was filled to one-third, two-thirds and full. The VGA in the dry rodded condition 15 represents the condition at which stone-onstone contact exists. The VMA and VGA at the optimum asphalt content can be then plotted against the percent fines and compared to the VGA for a mix without any fine aggregates. The point at which the VGA in the mixture is equal to the VGA in the dry rodded condition is the point at which it is assumed that stone-on-stone contact exists. [6] In mix design a test for voids in the coarse aggregate (AASHTO T 19) is used to ensure there is stone-on-stone contact.

2.3 Pavement Performance
In mechanistic pavement design the two main criteria o f pavement failure are fatigue cracking and permanent deformation (rutting). For permanent deformation the vertical strain at the bottom o f the sub base is responsible whereas the horizontal strain between the bituminous and granular layers cause fatigue cracking. The research showed that the generation o f vertical strain between the granular and bituminous layer o f samples subjected to wheel-tracking tests. It examines the performance o f traditional hot rolled asphalt in comparison to stone mastic asphalt. The process o f measuring horizontal longitudinal strain in bituminous mixtures is outlined and results include graphs o f strain measurement and rut depths. The improved rutting behavior o f SMA compared to conventional mix can be confirmed as well as a correlation o f peak strain and rut depth. Stone mastic asphalt shows excellent rutting behavior with wheel tracking rates only 20% that o f conventional mix. [14] Peak strain values for conventional mixes increase during the test period where as SMA values decrease for considerable amount o f time. Field performance that confirmed the findings o f the laboratory comparative

characterization completed on representative 1994 SMA, 1995 SMA, HL 1 (PG 64-28) and HL 1 asphalt cores using the Nottingham Asphalt Tester (NAT). The basic

2.3.1 Rutting
The SMA application on Highway 401 was constructed in 1996, a part o f a pavement rehabilitation contract between Highway 25 and Trafalgar Road near Milton. The SMA project was designed to compare the performance o f SMA surface mix in the three eastbound lanes with dense friction coarse (DFC) mix placed in the westbound lanes. The project, which is about 11km in length (approximately 22,000 tones o f mix) and carries about the same level o f traffic in both directions, provided an excellent opportunity to collect performance data for the assessment o f service life and overall cost effectiveness. Ministry o f Transportation Ontario (MTO) conducted ARAN profile measurements in the summer o f 1998 and 1999. The average rut depth is essentially less than 5 mm with the

exception o f the flushed area at the start o f the eastbound driving lane. The amount o f rutting is within the expected and normally acceptable range. [8]

2.3.2 Frictional characteristics
The pavement frictional characteristics were determined using the ASTM E274 skid trailer for the SMA application on Highway 401 and was part o f a pavement rehabilitation contract between Highway 25 and Trafalgar Road near Milton. The data shows an improvement in frictional characteristics for both the SMA and DFC surfaces. Measured SNIOO (at a speed o f 100 km/hr) values below 30 for Lane 3 reflect the intermittent flushing in the SMA at the start o f the eastbound driving lane. The overall 1999 data is significantly lower than the 1997 survey data partly as a result o f the corresponding temperature differences at the time o f testing. The average temperature at the time o f testing was 0°C, while in 1999 the temperature at the time o f testing varied from 14°C to 18°C. Differences in temperature o f this magnitude have a significant impact on frictional properties. [8]

2.3.3 Moisture Sensitivity Damage
The research found that the increase in asphalt stiffness, related to the application o f certain additives or aging, is associated to an increase in mechanical strength (indirect tensile and compressive) and retained strength (moisture damage resistance). There is no evidence o f aggregate - asphalt binder adhesion being diminished as asphalt becomes stiffer (expected since stiffer binders are supposed to be easier to detach by water); on the contrary, the fact o f retained compressive strength growing faster than retained indirect tensile strength, as the asphalt becomes stiffer, suggests the possibility o f an improved aggregate - asphalt binder adhesion through aging. [20]

2.3.4 Fatigue Cracking
Stone Mastic Asphalt mixes have performed very well in resisting rutting. Not enough research was performed on fatigue resistance o f SMA. The use o f cellulose fibers in asphalt mixes has generally been limited to gap graded mixtures such as Stone Mastic

Asphalt and Open Graded Frietion Courses and they are used only to minimize the draindown o f asphalt. In the enhaneement o f resistance to fatigue cracking, 150 mm by 50 mm thick cylindrical specimens were prepared and tested at 20°C with various proportions of cellulose oil palm fibers. The specimens were loaded at a constant deformation rate o f 5 mm per minute o f vertical ram movement until failure. The load, deformations, crack initiation and propagation were measured and analyzed. The research showed remarkable enhancement in the fatigue resistance, for a fiber range o f 0.6 percent by weight o f total mix. [22]

2.4 Shingles
Roofing shingles are unlike other by-product or secondary materials in that they contain fine aggregate, mineral filler and asphalt cement

2.4.1 Types of Shingles
There are two types o f roofing shingle. They are referred as tear-off roofing shingles, and manufactured shingle, also called prompt roofing shingle scrap. Tear-off roofing shingles are generated during the demolition or replacement o f existing roofs. Roofing shingle tabs are generated when new asphalt shingles are trimmed during production to the required physical dimensions. The quality o f tear-off roofing shingles can be quite variable.[l] Roofing shingles are produced by collecting either organic felt produced from cellulose fibers, or glass felt produced from glass fibers, with a hot saturant asphalt, which is subsequently coated on both sides with more asphalt and finally surfaced with mineral granules. Most roofing shingles are products o f the organic felt type.Both saturant and coating asphalts are produced by "blowing", a process in which air is bubbled through molten asphalt flux. The heat and oxygen act to change the characteristics o f the asphalt (makes it stiffer) The largest component o f roofing shingles (60 to 70 percent by mass) is the mineral material. There are several different types in each shingle. They can include ceramic

granules (comprising crushed rock particles, typically trap rock, coated with colored, ceramic oxides), lap granules (coal slag ground to roughly the same size as the ceramic granules), backsurfacer sand (washed, natural sand used in small quantities to keep packaged shingles from sticking together), and asphalt stabilizer (powdered limestone that is mixed into the asphalt).[l]

2.4.2 Typical Composition of Shingles

Component Asphalt Cellulose Fibers Felt Mineral Filler Minerals Granules

Organic Shingles 30-35% 12-15% 5-15% 10-20% 30-50%

Fiberglass shingles 15-20% 12-15% 5-15% 15-20% 30-50%

2.4.3 Use of Shingles in Hot mix Asphalt
Laboratory studies undertaken during the 1980's suggest that asphalt mixtures containing roofing shingle scrap could show mix design properties similar to that o f conventional asphalt mixtures. By using o f roofing shingle scrap in hot mix asphalt pavements began in 1990 with trial sections placed in Minnesota. Since then, interest in the use o f asphalt paving mixtures containing roofing shingle scrap has increased, with additional studies and trials in Minnesota, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, and Ontario, Canada. [16] Typical addition rates for roofing shingle scrap in hot mix asphalt have ranged from 3 to 6 percent (by mass). Evaluations o f a New Jersey trial pavement section after a few years o f service have indicated that performance similar to conventional hot mix asphalt pavements can be expected, with no significant differences in rut depth, cracking, or skid resistance.

2.4.4 Use of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) In Hot mix Asphalt
RAP is essentially old pavement that is reclaimed for use. In its most common form, it is collected in loose granular form as a byproduct o f pavement rehabilitation or reconstruction. RAP can be used in a variety o f ways such as:

· · · ·

As an addition to regular HMA. As an aggregate in cold-mix asphalt. As a granular base course when pulverized. As a fill or embankment material.

RAP is viable replacement for virgin aggregate. With depleting natural resources municipalities should consider RAP as an alternative product. Aggregates in older pavements contain some o f the best materials available today. Research carried out by Little e,t al 1981, Meyers et al 1983, and Kandhal et al 1994 has indicated that the structural performance o f recycled mixes is equal and in some instances better than that o f the conventional mixes. The properties o f the recycled mixture are believed to be mainly influenced by the aged reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) binder properties and the amount o f RAP in the mixture. Some mixtures prepared from the recycled binder blends generally age at a slower rate than virgin mixtures. This may be due to the fact that the RAP binder has already undergone oxidation which tends to retard the rate o f hardening, have indicated that the recycled mixtures withstood the action o f water better than the virgin mixtures. It is also shown that the durability o f recycled asphalt concrete mixtures is greater than that o f the conventional mixtures. [3] According to Georgia Department o f Transportation specification the RAP binder, when blended with virgin asphalt cement, should give a viscosity between 6,000 poises to 16,000 poises after the thin film oven test. [21] The mix design requirements for Superpave mixtures containing RAP are given below:

15

1. General Mix design requirements remain unchanged for Superpave mixtures containing RAP. Requirements for aggregate properties, gradation and volumetric properties should be met by the blend o f virgin and reclaimed materials. 2. The gradation o f aggregate in the RAP should be used in calculation o f the mix gradation. RAP is treated like a stockpile o f aggregate during this analysis. Aggregate consensus properties may be run on the individual RAP aggregate stockpile at the agency's discretion. While fine aggregate angularity, sand equivalency, and flat and elongated particles might not be measured on the individual RAP aggregate stockpile, some amount o f RAP aggregate will need to be extracted, combined with the total aggregate blend and tested for compliance with aggregate consensus properties. 3. The percentage o f asphalt binder in the RAP should be considered when determining the trial asphalt content. Asphalt binder content o f the total mixture for mix batching includes virgin and reclaimed asphalt binder. [11]

2.4.5 Performance of pavement containing shingles
A number o f demonstration projects have been completed using manufactured shingle modifier hot- mix asphalt, covering a broad range o f asphalt concrete types and traffic (loading) conditions. The most significant o f these are Highway 86 in Waterloo (1995, Ontario Ministry of Transportation) and Sheppard Avenue (1996, Toronto

Transportation). These asphalt pavements are being monitored for surface condition (durability), thermal cracking and rutting performance. The performance o f these pavements has been most favorable, confirming the laboratory evaluations o f manufactured shingle modifier and control section asphalt cores in the Nottingham Asphalt Tester. No problems were encountered during shingles production, placement and compaction. [26] It was shown that up to 5%, by weight o f mixture, o f manufacturing waste roofing shingles could be used in asphalt concrete with a minimum impact on the properties o f

16

the mixture. At a level o f 7.5%, a noticeable hardening o f the mixture occurs, and this might be detrimental to pavement performance. [4] Manufactured roofing shingle waste can be incorporated successfully into hot-mix asphalt (HMA), and that roofing shingle modified mixes show less temperature susceptibility than mixes without shingles. Significant savings in the use o f asphalt binder can be made since shingles are made o f 40-50% asphalt binder. The properties o f HMA are affected mainly because o f the presence o f asphalt and fiber in the shingles. Mallick and Mogawen in 2000 recommended that tensile properties o f shingle-modified mixes must be determined for evaluation o f use o f waste shingle in HMA. The authors also showed that the effect on the properties o f HMA is dependent on the amount o f shingles used, and the effect on tensile strength can get reversed at higher percentage o f shingles. [15]

The results from Minnesota Department o f Transportation's report show that the use o f manufactured waste shingles in HMA does not cause a significant difference in the quality o f the HMA. Actually, the rutting resistance is improved by using manufactured waste shingles. Standard deviations o f test results for mixes with shingles are low, indicating consistency in the quality o f the shingles. Since the mixes with shingles were prepared with less asphalt binder than the control mixes, the results also show that the shingles contribute a significant amount o f asphalt binder to the mix, and hence, using 5 % shingles, the amount o f asphalt can be reduced significantly. The author recommended for conducting a field evaluation o f use o f shingles in HMA. As 3 % shingles does not result in significant savings, it is recommended that test sections with 5 % shingles and control mix be constructed and evaluated for performance. [13] Waste roofing shingles can be used in HMA in the same way as recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) material, and that significant savings in amount o f asphalt binder can be made. Experimental results showed that high temperature rutting resistance can be improved by the addition o f shingles in HMA. [12]

It has been concluded from field projects that the use o f shingles in HMA can provide excellent performance and result in significant savings by reducing the amount o f virgin

asphalt binder required in HMA. They also concluded that shingle modified mixes are as resistant to moisture as are unmodified mixes, and that a slight increase in hardness o f binder o f the mix, resulting from the binder in the shingles did not have any adverse effect on low temperature properties o f the HMA. Based on the results o f laboratory and field study, the authors recommended the use o f waste shingles in HMA in the state o f Minnesota. [18] Creep compliance analyses led the researchers to conclude that deformation was reduced when shingles were added to a mix prepared with softer (120/150 penetration) asphalt, but that the opposite was true when shingles were added to mixtures using the harder (85/100 penetration) asphalt. The performance o f the shingle-containing SMA was equivalent to the control SMA. [16] Use o f manufactured shingle waste resulted in a less temperature susceptible asphalt mixture. The mixture stiffness was increased when the shingle content exceeded five percent by weight o f the aggregate. The roofing waste mixtures for the SMA experiment had similar stiffness to that found for the cellulose fiber control mixture. [9] In general previous work concluded that: · Use o f manufactured shingle waste did not significantly change the moisture susceptibility o f the conventional dense-graded mixtures. · Samples containing tear off material had increased susceptibility to moisture damage. · Manufactured roofing waste seemed to actually improve the resistance to water damage in the SMA mixtures. · Tensile strengths at low temperatures decreased with increasing roofing waste content. · Mixtures made with the tear o ff material showed a decrease in strain capacity with increased shingle content, implying that this material will be more brittle at cold temperatures.

Chapter 3 Materials & Experimental Details 3.1 Materials
Coarse aggregates were selected from MRT quarry located at Havelock, Ontario, and washed screening as fine aggregates from same quarry. The dust is used to accommodate as filler from dust collector o f any asphalt plant, which was collected from Miller G roup's Asphalt plant in Whitby Ontario. The Superpave mix design system integrates material selection and depends upon the projects climate and design traffic. The selection o f aggregates materials depends upon the following items:

3.2 Physical Properties
The physical properties o f the aggregates used in this study are determined in accordance with Superpave design guidelines. Those properties which achieve high performance and must qualify various levels o f depending on the traffic volume and position within the pavement, high traffic levels and surface mixtures require more strict values for physical properties. These properties identified in Superpave are:

3.2.1 Coarse aggregate angularity (crushed)
This property ensures a high degree o f aggregate internal friction and rutting resistance. It is defined as the percentage (by mass) o f aggregates larger than 4.75mm with one or more fractured faces. It gives the required minimum values for coarse aggregate angularity as a function o f traffic volume and position within the pavement. The percent crushed particles details are given in Table 3.1 According to OPSS # LS-607 60-80% particles should be crushed.

3.2.2 Fine aggregate angularity
The angularity o f fine aggregates is determined by measuring the amount o f voids in a certain volume o f aggregates in a loose condition. This void content provides an indication o f the aggregate angularity, the higher the voids, the high angularity o f sand. For testing take a sample o f fine, washed and dried aggregate poured into a small calibrated cylinder through a standard funnel, the mass o f fine aggregate (W) in the filled cylinder o f known volume (V), the void content can be calculated as the difference between the cylinder volume and fine aggregate volume collected in cylinder.
The bulk specific gravity (Gsb) is used to determine the fine aggregate volume. See figure

This characteristic is the percentage by mass o f coarse aggregates that have maximum to

minimum dimension ratio greater than five. Flat and elongated particles are undesirable because they have a tendency to break during construction and under traffic. The maximum limit for surface course should be 20% as per OPSS # LS-608 The proportional caliper device as shown in Figure 3.1 measures the dimensional ratio of a representative sample o f aggregate particles.

It measures the relative density (apparent, bulk and saturated, surface dry) and absorption o f a sample o f coarse aggregates. Aggregates are porous, not solid particles, water is absorbed by the particle in the pore spaces, which may be relatively shallow or may extend well into the aggregate particle. The specific Gravity and percent absorption for coarse aggregate comes out to be 2.859 and 0.652 respectively.

Source properties are those, which are to be used to qualify local source o f aggregate while these properties are very important and these are identified in Superpave, It is the present loss o f material from an aggregate blend during the Los Angeles Abrasion test or through Micro Deval test. It estimates the resistance o f coarse aggregate to abrasion and mechanical degradation during handling, construction and in service.

In the Stone Mastic Asphalt, overcoming the drain down percentage is a common challenge, different researchers and asphalt concrete producers used fibers to meet the requirement o f drain down, as we know that binder content is so high due to coarse aggregates. In the experimental design tear off shingles were used as a source o f fibers and compare the volumetric properties with control mix design. The tear off shingles has been collected from waste yard near Brampton Ontario, those shingles contain average 30% binder content and the gradations are given in table 3.13 Figure 3.5 is the graphical presentation o f shingle's gradation.

3.7 Design Parameters
Mixtures were designed to meet the requirements o f Ontario Provincial Standard Specification OPSS # 313S45M May 2002, which are described below:

3.7.1 Voids In Coarse Aggregate
The integrity o f the aggregate skeleton is assured by establishing that the Void in Coarse aggregate (VGA) o f the SMA mixture is equal to or less than the VGA o f the coarse aggregate fraction as determined by the dry rodded unit weight test. When designing SMA mixtures, it is suggested that at least three trial gradations be initially evaluated. The percent air voids, voids in mineral aggregate and voids in coarse aggregate o f the selected mix design compared with the requirements for air voids, voids in mineral aggregate and voids in coarse aggregate in the dry rodded condition. With some aggregates, particularly soft ones, it may be difficult to meet the VMA requirements no matter how the aggregates are blended. The inability to meet the VMA requirements may be the result o f excessive aggregate breakdown that is an indication the aggregate may be unsuitable for use in stone mastic asphalt mixtures. Thus every effort should be made to meet the VMA requirements. The dry rodded density o f coarse aggregate used in this study is 1689kg/m^

3.7.2 Blending of Aggregate
In asphalt mix design when all requirements o f materials complied with specification, then it is required to prepare a blend with different ratios o f selected materials to meet the target gradation o f the specified mix. In our study it complies with the requirements for Stone Mastic Asphalt with Ontario Provincial Standard Specification Special Provision No. 313S45M. In first trial blend the selected coarse aggregate was 68%, fine aggregate was 22%, shingles was 5% and dust was 5%. As first trial blend did not achieve the required gradation, different blends have to be tried to achieve the target-grading curve, the selected blending o f aggregates is given in Table 3.15 and graphical presentation in Figure 3.7.

3.7.3 Preparation of Asphalt Mix
After blending o f aggregates was finalized, three batches o f aggregate with different blending ratios were kept in the oven for overnight to dry. On next day asphalt mix with initial percent o f hinder were prepared. Three hatches o f mix will he prepared by using mechanical mixer in the laboratory. Each hatch o f mix was enough for one specimen o f Superpave, two specimens were prepared and one mix was used for Theoretical Maximum Density. The asphalt mixes were placed in conditioned oven for short-term absorption (for two hours) to correlates with the mix prepared at asphalt plant and delivered to paving site. The Superpave method o f mix design was used in this study. Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) researchers had several goals in developing a laboratory compaction method, the important point was they want to realistically compact mixture test specimen to densities achieved under actual pavement climate and loading conditions. The compacting equipment was required to he capable o f accommodating large size of aggregates and to measure the degree o f compaction and height as well. The basis for the Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC) was the Texas gyratory compactor that was modified to use the compaction principles o f a French gyratory compactor. The modified Texas gyratory accomplished the goals o f realistic specimen densification and it was reasonably portable. Its 6-inch sample diameter that will be 150mm on SGC would be effectively reasonable for maximum size o f aggregates. The Superpave gyratory compactor has following parts, which show in figure 3.15 [23] · · · · Reaction frame, rotating base and motor Loading system, loading ram, and pressure gauge Height measuring and recording system Mold and Base plate Specimen Extruding device

A loading mechanism presses against the reaction frame and applies a load to the loading ram to produce a 600-kpa-compaction pressure on the specimen. A pressure gauge measures the ram loading to maintain constant pressure during the compaction. The SGC mold has an internal diameter o f 150mm and a base plate in the bottom o f the mold provides confinement during compaction and the base rotates at a constant rate o f 30 gyrations per minute during compaction, with the mold positioned at a compaction angle o f 1.25 degrees as shown in Figure 3.12 [23]

Next, a minimum o f two specimens for each trial blend is compacted using the SGC. Two samples are also prepared for determination o f the mixture's maximum theoretical specific gravity
( G ,n m ) .

An average weight o f mix for one specimen was 5000g, which is

usually sufficient for the compacted specimens. An aggregate weight o f 2000 grams is usually sufficient for the specimens used to determine maximum theoretical specific gravity (Gmm). AASHTO T-209 should be consulted to determine the minimum sample size required for various mixtures. The number o f gyrations used for compaction is determined based on the traffic level; it is explained in table No. 3.16 with reference to Superpave method o f mix design guide MS-2 Table 3.16 Details about Gyration and traffic

3.7.4 Calculation for % Gm m
Each specimen was compacted to the design number o f gyrations, with specimen height data collected during the compaction process. During compaction, the height o f the specimen is continuously monitored. After compaction is complete, the specimen is extruded from the mold and allowed to cool. Next, the bulk specific gravity (Gmb) o f the specimen is determined using AASHTO T166. The Gmm o f each blend is determined using AASHTO T209. Gmb is then divided by Gmm to determine the %Gmm @ Ndes. The % Gmm at any number o f gyrations (Nx) is then calculated by multiplying %Gmm @ Ndes by the ratio o f the heights at Ndes and Nx Superpave gyratory compaction data is analyzed by computing the estimated bulk specific gravity, corrected bulk specific gravity, and corrected percentage o f maximum theoretical specific gravity for each desired gyration. During compaction, the height is measured and recorded after each gyration. Gmb o f compacted specimen and Gmm o f loose mixture are measured. An estimate o f Gmb at any value o f gyration is made by dividing the mass o f the mixture by volume o f the compaction mold.

3.7.5 N(m ax) Verification
Superpave specifies a maximum density o f 98% at N(max)- Specifying a maximum density at N prevents design o f a mixture that will compact excessively under traffic.

become plastic, and produce permanent deformation. Since N(max) represents a compactive effort that would he equivalent to traffic much greater than the design traffic, excessive compaction will not occur. After selecting the blend and selecting the design asphalt binder content (4.0%) two additional specimens are compacted to 160 gyrations.

3.7.6 Drain down percentage
One o f the problems that have been observed with SMA is draindown o f the asphalt cement resulting in fat spots. The percentage of drain down in the mix resulting from dripping has to be checked. This is done through measuring the amount o f asphalt cement that passes through a standard mesh. See Figure.No.3.6 for draindown basket assembly. The basket with the mix was placed into a preheated oven and maintained at 152°C for two hours. Pre-weighed papers were placed underneath the container to collect the asphalt cement drippings. The drippings were collected and weighed after one-hour period. The same procedure was repeated for another sample with the oven temperature at 165°C. The weights were calculated and expressed as a percentage o f the initial weight o f the mix and the numbers were reported as percent draindown. The maximum percent o f draindown should not exceed 0.3% as per requirement o f OPSS # 313S45M May 2002 Figure No.3.12 Draindown basket assembly SIDE VIEW

3.7.7 Moisture Sensitivity
Moisture susceptibility was determined in aeeordance with AASHTO T 283. Six briquettes (95mm) were prepared and compacted at 6% to 7% air voids, three o f them will be tested for dry strength and three were vacuum saturated, freezing for 16-24 hours and than kept in water bath for 60°C for 24 hours and then tested as wet strength. The average tensile strength ratio should not be less than 70%. For tensile strength ratio, many laboratories use the same load frame, which used to be used for Marshall Stability. The indirect tensile test uses the same specimen orientation but the breaking head has been modified to induce a more theoretically correct application o f the load.

Chapter 4 Results and Analysis

4.1 Analysis of Resuits
In this chapter every mix design will be discussed with respect to volumetric properties. Five different SMA Mixes has been designed and investigated. These are given in Table 4.1 Table 4.1 Mix design description

Mix Number 1 IB 2 3 4 5 Description
5% Shingles + Baghouse dust as mineral filler 5% Shingles + CKD as mineral filler 3% Shingles + Baghouse dust as mineral filler 0.6% Fibers + Baghouse dust as mineral filler 0.3% Fibers + Baghouse dust as mineral filler 10% Shingles + CKD as mineral filler

4.1.1 Trials to reach optimum result
It is assumed that all binder (asphalt cement) in the shingles is "available" to the mixture. Since the asphalt content o f the shingles used in this study is 30%, in this way 5% shingles will provide 1.5% asphalt to the mixture. The first mixture was conducted at 5% shingles. To adjust the aggregate blending, three blends A, B and C were conducted at different aggregate blending ratios and a total asphalt(binder) content o f 5.5% ( 4% version binder and 1.5% from shingles). These are shown in Table 4.2

The blend o f trial C was chosen since it provides the 4% air voids and adequate VMA. After that, the same aggregate blending was tried at three binder contents namely 5, 5.5 and 6% as detailed in section 4.11 Table 4.2 Results o f different trials

4.1.2 SMA Mix design No.1B
One trial prepared with same aggregate blending, shingle and binder content but dust has been replaced with cement Kiln dust to check the properties. The detailed results are mentioned in Table 4.8. From the result and visual examination o f the mix, one can conclude that less CKD could have been used and provide adequate result. This would require changing the blending o f the aggregates. The CKD is finer than the Baghouse dust and this would require the (CKD) mixes to contain less mineral filler, for gradation o f CKD and dust refer to chapter 3.

4.4 Discussion of Results
With respect to properties, all volumetric properties were within the required limits but the value o f tensile strength is relatively high so that it could be a problem in future in terms o f fatigue resistant or low temperature cracking in heavy traffic volume. If we compare the results o f both mixes with shingles and mixes with fibers, it is very clear that mixes with fibers will be more costly due to high binder content and in the mixes with shingles we are getting lot o f economic and environmental benefits in terms o f binder as well as recycling o f scrap shingles.

Chapter 5 Conclusions & Recommendations

5.1 Conclusions
1. The volumetric properties and tensile strength ratio were in compliance with Ontario Provincial Standard Specifications, with 5% shingles. This would result in a saving o f 2% o f binder per ton o f mixture which is a total cost o f $4.0 per ton o f mix. 2. The 3% shingles did also meet the requirements o f Ontario Provincial Standard Specifications; however it looks from tensile strength ratio that these mixes may be better in terms o f fatigue. In other words, the mixture looks softer than that o f containing 5% shingles. 3. Comparing the SMA mixes containing shingles with SMA containing fibers both can achieve the requirement o f Ontario Provincial Standard Specifications, however the mixture with shingles have saving both in the cost o f binder( about 1.1 to 2% saving) in addition to the cost o f fibers 4. Cement kiln dust was found to require more binder content as compare to bag house dust, however this require further detailed investigation. 5. There are several economic advantages that can be realized by recycling prompt roofing shingle scrap for use in hot-mix asphalt. One o f the most significant cost savings is incurred by diverting roofing shingle scrap from landfills. 6. In addition to saving landfill space, the benefits to recycling asphalt shingles in hot mix asphalt include possible economic savings and improved pavement performance.

5.2 Recommendations
Based on the results obtained in this study the following are recommendations for further research in the area o f recycling roof shingles in asphalt mixtures: 1. Performance testing should be conducting in SMA containing different levels o f shingles to study the properties o f such mixtures in terms o f rutting, fatigue and low temperature cracking 2. It is recommended to test the binder extracted from shingles to get an idea about the properties o f such binder and its effected performance.
