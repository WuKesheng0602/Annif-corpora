COMPATIBILITY OF METALLIC & NON-METALLIC TURBINE ENGINE MATERIALS WITH AVIATION FUELS Master of Applied Science, 2011 Olcay Met, Aerospace Engineering Ryerson University

Abstract
As known alternative fuels shall undergo two crucial regulations in order to be certified: emission gas rate and the compatibility with engine parts. The objective of this research is to assess the compatibility of engine materials with JetA. The methodology here is in accordance with ASTM D4054; the proposed materials are soaked in proposed fuel. Subsequent to the soak period specimens are subject to specific test standards such as ASTM and visual inspection. Through assessment of compatibility the actual objective is to establish a systematic methodology for future alternative fuel research studies. In another meaning it is aimed to develop in-house capability to create optimum medium for future alternative fuel studies at Ryerson University's Facility for Research on Aerospace Materials and Engineered Structure. Results demonstrate that being wetted at elevated temperatures played a significant role on the physical properties of most non-metallic materials and there is almost no surface deformation observed on metallic materials.

Chapter 1 Statement of the Research and Objectives

1.1 Introduction
As the economical demands grow and environmental restrictions become more stringent, the automobile and aviation industries feel the pressure to develop new alternative fuels. Even though the aviation section is responsible for 2 % of the total amount of emission gases, the industry still is required to undergo the regulations by such environmental safety committees. The investigation of new alternative fuels mainly covers emission gas rate and material compatibility. Since both categories are prominent, the latter one is the chief concern in this thesis. Aircraft turbine engines are formed of both metallic and non-metallic materials, and those components are continuously in contact with the fuel. Since this contact may cause serious contamination, and degradation of material properties, a detailed examination shall be conducted over the compatibility of materials with proposed fuels. Any adverse effect on materials by the fuel may cause safety issues. Another main goal being sought in this research is to enhance the in-house capability of Ryerson University for any possible future alternative fuel studies. There are many material compatibility studies that shows similar process of assessment, however there are differences in soaking process in terms of soak period and temperature, depending on where the parts are used, and evaluation of change of physical properties. In this thesis, the methodology of examination is in accordance with ASTM D4054. Four main steps of achieving the goals are:

1



Develop the methodology for soak process and conducting after-soak tests which are outlined in ASTM D4054.

 

Implement the stage of material immersion. Evaluate, based on ASTM test procedures and guidelines, whether the contact with fuel has any impact on materials` physical properties.



Verify any change on materials` nature and whether those changes are within allowable limits.



Most importantly, by conducting this research, develop inhouse capability of Ryerson's Facility for Research on Aerospace Materials and Engineered Structures (FRAMES) for prospective alternative fuel studies through purchasing any kinds of equipments required by ASTM standards.

The common method throughout the research program conducted so far is that all test materials are being soaked in a candidate fuel for some period.

Figure 1.1 The Soaking Scheme

The soaking procedure shall not violate the following restrictions:   Test materials are to be incubated completely The holders for test materials must not contaminate the test fuel(s).

1.2 Overview
Chapter 2 will present the literature review on compatibility studies of materials with
alternative fuels. It will discuss the general mechanical properties of metallic and non-metallic materials, and will describe the change of their physical properties depending on time and temperature in contact with fuels.

Chapter 3 will outline the fundamentals of compatibility study, the materials to be tested, and
the types of ASTM standards to be applied. The main focus of this chapter will be to explain the motivation and scope of this project, and will describe the experimental set-up and the test methodology.

Chapter 4 will focus on the description of materials in details and the preparation of materials
procured in raw form. It will also focus on the equipments needed for the soaking period such as ovens and jars.

Chapter 5 will show results of the experimental work in this thesis and will propose
recommendation regarding utilization of the materials in turbine engines.

Chapter 6 will draw conclusions based on the results of the experimental investigations that
were discussed in Chapter 5. This chapter will also present the future work.

Chapter 2 Literature Review
2.1 Introduction
Environmental and economical demands require aircraft turbine engine manufacturers to evaluate a variety of alternative fuels. Environmental issues are put forward by international organizations, agreements (e.g., Kyoto Agreement), which involves all industrialized countries. Their primary objective is to restrict emission gases dissipation to a certain amount. Second demand, which is economical, is being brought up by military institutions and travel agencies through aircraft manufacturers. Therefore, turbine engine and car manufacturers, being the core of solution, have been conducting various researches on new fuel technologies. Besides obtaining optimum emission rate by using alternative fuel, there is another prominent issue which is the compatibility of engine parts with newly-developed fuel. The reviewed documents are generally in favour of compatibility evaluation of various metallic and nonmetallic materials. Since the compatibility issue is crucial to both aerospace and automobile industries that exhibit very similar methodology, reviewed literature covers both areas. In either means, parts, to be used in an engine, are incubated in designated fuels and subsequently subjected to some standardized tests including; visual inspection, tensile test, volume swell, hardness measurements, etc. The need of reviewing previously done research studies is based on several reasons: the use of similar test fuels, materials, methodology. Even though the soaking period and temperatures are usually different, the review of literature will provide a good understanding of materials'

behaviour when exposed to various test fuels. Moreover, it provides a better insight into the compatibility-of-materials issues.

2.2 History of Alternative Fuel Research
In the period of World War II, the high demand of bio fuels was due to the increased use as an alternative for imported fuel. In this period, Germany was one of the countries that underwent a serious shortage of fuel. It was during this period that various other inventions took place like the use of gasoline along with alcohol that was derived from potatoes. Britain was the second country which came up with the concept of grain alcohol mixed with petrol. The war times were the periods when the various major technological changes took place but, during the period of peace, cheap oil from the gulf countries as well as the Middle East again eased off the pressure. With the increased supply of fossil fuel, the geopolitical and economic interest in biofuel faded away. A serious fuel crisis again hit the various countries during the period of 1973 and 1979, because of the geopolitical conflict. Thus (OPEC), Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries made a heavy cut in exports especially to the non OPEC nations. The constant shortage of fuel attracted the attention of the various academics and governments to the issues of energy crisis and the use of bio fuels. The twentieth century came with the attention of the people towards the use of bio fuels. Some of the main reasons for the people shifting their interest to bio fuels were the rising prices of oil, emission of the greenhouse gases and interest like rural development.

2.3 Commonly Used Aviation Fuels
2.3.1 Jet A
Jet A is the standard jet fuel type in the U.S. since the 1950s and is only available there. Jet A is similar to Jet-A1, except for its higher freezing point of -40 Â°C (vs. -47 Â°C for Jet A -1). Like Jet A-1, Jet A has a fairly high flash point of 38 Â°C (100 Â°F), with an auto ignition temperature of 210 Â°C (410 Â°F). The annual U.S. usage of jet fuel was 21 billion gallons (80 billion litres) in 2006.

2.3.2 JP8
JP-8 or JP8 (for Jet Propellant 8") is a jet fuel, specified in 1990 by the U.S. government. It is kerosene-based. It is a replacement for the JP-4 fuel; the U.S. Air Force replaced JP-4 with JP8 completely by the fall of 1996, to use a less flammable, less hazardous fuel for better safety and combat survivability. Commercial aviation uses a similar mixture under the name Jet-A. JP8 in addition contains icing inhibitor, corrosion inhibitors, lubricants, and antistatic agents. JP-8+100 is a version of JP-8 with an additive that increases its thermal stability by 56Â°C (100Â°F). The additive is a combination of a surfactant, metal deactivator, and an antioxidant. It was introduced in 1994. The additive reduces coking and fouling in engine fuel systems.

2.5 History of Fuel-Material Compatibility
2.5.1 Early Development of Compatibility Research
The very first published alternative fuel studies appeared in the 70's. Since the significance of material compatibility was noticed, many researches have been conducted to evaluate the physical properties of materials, that are used in aircraft turbine engines, under exposure to fuels. It appears that one of the very early research studies was conducted in military aviation industry. A nitrile rubber was incubated in Jet A and several blends (Naphthalene, Tetralin, Decalin, etc. ). The methodology of soaking process employed few different ways; soaking independently in each fuel, and soaking with periodically cycling between fuels. (Coleman and Gallop, 1982) The main attack by the fuel was its aromatics. Naphthalene was particularly effective in promoting swell and softening, but had about the same effect on elastic properties as mononuclear aromatics at the same level. However, this research covered only one type of elastomeric and involved cycling of samples between fuels, and the sample was subject to limited test standards. (Coleman and Gallop, 1982) In another work, the difficulty of a quantitative measure of the effect of processing variables on the shear strength of solid state diffusion bonds due to the scatter in test data was examined. For test strips Al alloys were utilized. Even though the bond strength depends on the usual processing variables ie. Temperature, pressure, bonding time and interface deformation, the oxide film present on Al alloys is a major obstacle to the formation of high quality bonds. Hence a different bonding technique called diffusion bonding was introduced. This method was achieved using the bonding jig shown in figure 2.2. (Harvey et all, 1985)

Figure 2.1 Effect on rubber (SA 463) properties of room temperature storage in Jet A-1 (Courtesy of J.R. Coleman and L.D. Gallop) Improved bonding and testing techniques have reduced the scatter in shear strength data for small diffusion-bonded lap shear test pieces. This enabled the precise measurement of shear stress-strain curves for lap joints and led to reproducible shear strength values. (Harvey et all, 1985) Another research was conducted on swelling behaviour of fluorocarbon elastomers in methanol and water. The fluorocarbon elastomer used in this investigation was a copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluorpropylene. Samples were exposed to the fluid for 72 hours at room temperature. (Myers and Abu-Isa, 1985) At the end of soak period, the volume change of the fluorocarbon elastomer after exposure to water is -l%, indicating slight shrinkage. For methanol a very large positive volume change of 89% is determined, showing that methanol is different in its interaction with the fluorocarbon elastomer than water. (Myers and Abu-Isa, 1985)

Another early prominent research was completed in Southwest Research Institute. Several kinds of non-metallic materials were soaked in baseline fuel JP-8 and four blends: MIL-F-46162B, MIL-F-46162C, MIL-F-53080, Middle distillate fuel stimulant. The test materials were towable fuel drum (Elastomer A), collapsible fuel tank material and associated seam section (Elastomer B and C, respectively), and Berm liner and its seam section (Elastomer D and E, respectively). JP-8 was allowed to contain maximum 25 % of aromatics. (Fodor, 1989) The soak process was carried out at 80 C for 14 days for five samples of each material, and three samples were placed into each bottle, the remaining two into the other bottle which were sealed with Teflon-lined screw caps. Subsequent to the immersion period, hardness value was measured for each elastomer two times; after 2 days and 6 weeks. And as data from the paper suggested,

9

elastomer A is more sensitive to exposure to fuels. The others did not show significant sensitivity to any of the fuels. (Fodor, 1989) Another work was done on the resistance of elastomers with parylene coating against aggressive fuels. Fuel system seals, O-rings, hoses, and diaphragms coated with parylene were subject to hardness, tensile strength, elongation, and volume swell tests. The coated specimens were compared with uncoated ones. Parylene-coated fluorocarbon (FKM), nitrile (NBR), hydrogenated nitrile (HNBR), and silicone elastomers were candidates in this paper and as fuel methanol was used. Samples were soaked for 168hours at 158 F. (Jeff Pyle, Machine Design; May 14, 1993; 65, 9; ABI/INFORM Global pg. 77) As a result, The parylene-coated specimens exhibited significant reduction in volume swell, moderate reduction in elongation, functional level of increase in tensile properties, and good retention in hardness. (Jeff Pyle, Machine Design; May 14, 1993; 65, 9; ABI/INFORM Global pg. 77)

2.5.2 Latest Development of Compatibility Research
The second period of development started in mid 1990`s and continues to the present. This period can be viewed as the rapid and intense growth of alternative fuel research. This second era was initiated by one of the most detailed projects. Wide range of materials (adhesives, sealants, foams, etc..) and test standards(hardness, elongation, peel strength, etc..) was covered in this research. More than 100 materials have been soaked in a Teflon sealed glass containers at different temperatures for 28-day period. Airframe materials, engine materials, and some older airframe materials were soaked at 200,325, and 160 F, respectively. The test fuels used as baseline fuel and additives are JP-8, JP8+100 and MDA/BHT, respectively. (Heneghan et all, 1996)
10

As a result of this research, none of the materials showed any detrimental effects due to the additive package. A fascinating result, not associated with the JP-8+100 program, is that some materials currently in use are not compatible with JP-8, or are being used at temperatures that are beyond their operating range. (Heneghan et all, 1996) Another interesting research, again in the very early stage of later development, was conducted on the compatibility of non-metallic materials with JP-8 and JP-8+100. This study of compatibility is very similar to the previous worked mentioned above in terms of material types, fuel types, and test standards. Test materials tested were included adhesives, bladders, O-rings, and few. The materials were all immersed in three fuels (JP-8, JP-8+100, and JP-8+100(4X)) at 160, 200, and 325 F for 28 days with fuel changes every 7 days. Test samples were blotted dry and tested within 30 min after removal. (Fletcher, 1997) The initial results of this research showed many failures that needed to be analyzed for root cause. Primarily, the failures occurred because the temperature limitation of the material had been breached. Later tests were performed at lower temperatures to prove this conclusion. (Fletcher, 1997) Similar research was carried out on both elastomer and metallic materials. This research covered the testing of various fuels; JP-8, ASTM low-sulphur reference diesel fuel (LSDF), Reference No.2 Diesel fuel, and Biodiesel. As well as the variety of test fuels, compatibility covered wide range of materials: Elastomer (Teflon, Nylon 6/6, Nitrile rubber, Viton A401C, Fluorosilicone, Polyurethane, Polypropylene), Metallic(C110 copper, SAE 1010 steel, C260 brass, 6061 aluminum, A319 cast aluminum, C510 bronze). Both elastomer and metallic materials were incubated in each fuel at 51.7 C for 22, 70, and 694 hours. Subsequently ASTM D 471 and D 412 were applied. (Bessee and Frey, 1997)
11

According to the above research, some of the materials were affected severely and the rest maintained their physical properties with minimum variation to non-soaked state. Nitrile rubber, nylon 6/6, and high-density polypropylene were affected, but Teflon and Viton appeared to have good resistance and minimal changes in physical properties. Copper-containing metals showed severe corrosion. (Bessee and Frey, 1997) An interesting research on compatibility was conducted by US army aviation (. The candidate fuel being used was JP-8+100. Various metallic and non-metallic materials were subjected to testings( e.g., tensile, hardness). Having the paper classified, there is no information about how the soaking process was carried out. The results obtained of that research was quiet satisfying. There were no material compatibility issue with JP-8+100 figured out. (Owens et all, 2000) After we stepped into the third millennium, fuel-material compatibility gained momentum. Besides automobile and aviation sectors, there has been quite important fuel researches conducted for satellite systems. One of them was carried out by NASA and US Air Force joint program. The intension of this study was to evaluate the compatibility of materials of construction of small satellites with HAN (hydroxyl ammonium nitrate)-based propellant. As test fuels 13M HAN and XM46 were used. The materials covered were of only metallic materials: A16061, carbon steel, nickel 200, titanium, Ti-6Al-4V, and 304, 310, 316, 410 stainless steel. Materials were soaked in candidate fuels at various temperatures, ranging from 25 to 65 C and durations from 6 to 369 days. (Reed and Harasim, 2001) Some of the materials were affected detrimentally by candidate fuels: A16061 broke apart and had significant mass loss, carbon steel had significant mass loss, nickel 200 and 410 stainless steel were pitted and has significant mass loss , Ti-6Al-4V was pitted, the remaining had no obvious sign of attack. (Reed and Harasim, 2001)
12

As the compatibility becomes one of the major problems, studies towards sorting out that problem have been growing bigger. One significant research called synthetic Fischer-Tropsch JP-5/JP-8 aviation turbine fuel elastomer compatibility was carried out. There were few test fuels involved in that research: S-5 (blend of JP-5 and JP-8 without aromatics), JP-5 with 18% aromatics, S-5 + 10% A150 (by Exxon Mobil), S-5 + 25% A150, ECD-1(emission control diesel-1). There was only one material type to be tested; nitrile elastomer N0674-70 in forms of coupons and O-rings. Five samples of each form were incubated at 40 C for 43 days in each test fluid. After immersion ASTM D471 and D2240 were applied. (Muzzel et all, 2005) For the coupons there were significant results observed on the materials. As the aromatic content increased, the volume swell increased as well. Unlike volume swell, as the aromatic level increased, hardness decreased. The most significant change was in S-5 + 25% A150. For Orings, for both volume swell and hardness, increase was observed in all fluids but S-5. (Muzzel et all, 2005) In another fuel study the impact of biodiesel on fuel system components was examined. The research involved several types of fuels; BP-15- Base fuel, B5 RME( 5 % in BP-15 Rapeseed biodiesel), B5 SME( 5 % in BP-15 Soy based biodiesel), B5 Oxidized SME, B20 RME( 20 % in BP-15), B20 SME( 20 % in BP-15), B20 Oxidized SME. The materials tested were all elastomers O-rings; Nitrile rubber (NB104-75, NO674-70), nitrile polymer (KB162-80), and Fluorocarbon polymer (VB153-75, V1164-75). Materials were soaked in candidate fuels at 60 C for 1000 hours. Subsequent to the soaking period, they were subjected to ASTM D1414, D471, and D395. (Terry, 2005) As a result of this compatibility research; fluorocarbons were compatible with all the candidate fuels, nitrile rubber showed acceptable performance in all fluids with the exception of B20 SME
13

and B20 Oxidized SME where volume swell measurement were high. Equally NO674-70 showed good performance in all fluids with the exception of B20 SME. NB104-75 performed well in terms of hardness and volume change but overall exhibited substantial physical property changes across the range of test fluids, therefore not recommended. (Terry, 2005) Another research was conducted on characteristic tensile properites of elastomers at lower deformation. The tensile loadÂ­deformation relationship of elastomers is considerably nonlinear. The local slope of the loadÂ­ deformation curve drops off significantly and the gradient of the curve changes as the elastomer is stretched. A typical result of tensile test of elastomers is then a stressÂ­strain curve of S-shape, for which Hooke's law is not valid. For characterization of elastomer properties, stress at 100% strain, stress at 300% strain, tensile strength and ultimate elongation are commonly used. Rubber dumbbell specimens of clay filled vulcanized styrenebutadiene rubber compound were used in this work. (Malac, 2005) As a lower deformation region, we have arbitrary chosen the range up to 25% sample strain. The measured force-extension dependence in the range to 20% strain for the tested specimen is shown in Fig. 2.3. The dependence is evidently nonlinear and measured extension data are not equally spaced apart. (Malac, 2005)

14

Figure 2.3 Force-extension dependence to 20% strain of tested specimen (Courtesy of Jiri Malac, 2005). As the need of alternative fuel grows bigger, more studies are to be conducted. An interesting research was done about effect of biodiesel blend on elastomer properties. Diesel was used as a baseline fuel and biodiesel, B10 prepared from palm oil, was the candidate fuel. There were bunch of elastomers to be tested; NBR, HNBR, NBR/PVC, acrylic rubber, co-polymer FKM, and terpolymer FKM. The test materials were immersed in B10 (10 % biodiesel) for 22, 670, and 1008 hours at 100 C. And then ASTM D471, D2240, and D412 were applied. The result of this research was pretty satisfying that B10 demonstrated little impact on the properties of elastomers. (Trakarnpruk and Porntangjitlikit, 2007) Another review is about the experimental research on the resistance of rubber materials to dimethyl ether. 20 % DME (Dimethyl Ether) blended in diesel, known as D20 was used as a fuel. There were 5 different types of materials to be tested; Chloroprene rubber, acrylate rubber, fluorosilicone rubber, ethylene-propylene-diene monomer rubber, nitrile-butadiene rubber, and fluorocarbon rubber. Samples were incubated in D20 for 1, 7, and 30 days and then ASTM
15

D412, D471, and D2240 were applied. The results derived from that research speaks in favour of only nitrile-butadiene rubber which was found to be the least susceptible to the presence of DME in diesel and appears to have the best chance of working in a practical application. (Li and Zhou, 2008) Another work was carried out to exhibit high-performance nano-adhesive bonding of titanium for aerospace and space applications. The high-performance nano-adhesive is prepared by dispersing silicate nanoparticles into the ultra-high-temperature-resistant epoxy adhesive at 10 % weight ratio with the matrix adhesive followed by modification of the nano-adhesive after curing under high-energy radiation for 6 h in the pool of SLOWPOKE-2 nuclear reactor to promote crosslink into the adhesive. As a result, a significant increase in lap shear strength was obtained. In Fig 2.4 comparison between the adhesives is shown. (Bhowmik et all, 2008) Another experimental research was done over the swell behaviours of O-rings with different test fuels. The tested materials were including; VMQ (silicone), CR (chloroprene), NBR (nitrile), FVMQ (fluorosilicone), FKM (fluorocarbon), and EPDM (ethylene-propylene). As for test fluids high-aromatic gasoline, jet-turbine lubricant, phosphate-ester hydraulic fluid, and standard reference test oils were utilized. (Keller, 2009)

16

Figure 2.4 Tensile lap shear strength of adhesive joint of plasma-nitrided titanium (Courtesy of Bhowmik et all, 2008). For more than 60 years, engineers specifying seals and customers using them have accepted the arbitrary rule that the maximum amount O-rings will swell in most applications is a 25% change in volume. Results showed that the maximum volume change for O-rings in most applications is actually 40%, not 25%. (Keller, 2009).

2.5 Concluding Remarks
This chapter reviewed previously done research studies on compatibility of materials with alternative fuels. However, material-fuel compatibility research studies are not revealed fully due to proprietary concerns and nature of the studies is partially explained. Chiefly, duration of soaking, temperature, and the type of fuel have an influence on mechanical properties of materials, and have to be considered when characterizing the materials.

Chapter 3 Evaluating Compatibility of Additives or Fuels with Fuel System Materials
3.1 Introduction
The information included in this chapter is obtained from ASTM standard practice D4054-09 titled: Standard Practice for Qualification and Approval of New Aviation Turbine Fuels and Fuel Additives. According to section A3 of this standard; this practice covers and provides a framework for the qualification and approval of new fuels and new fuel additives for use in commercial and military aviation gas turbine engines. The practice was developed as a guide by the aviation gas-turbine engine Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) with ASTM International member support. The OEMs are solely responsible for approval of a fuel or additive in their respective engines and airframes. For the purpose of this guide, approval means permission to use; it is not an endorsement of any kind. Standards organizations such as ASTM International, United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, and the U.S. military list only those fuels and additives that are mutually acceptable to all OEMs. ASTM International and OEM participation in the evaluation or approval procedure does not constitute an endorsement of the fuel or additive.

3.2 Test Program
3.2.2 Test Materials
Tables 3.2 and 3.4, collectively, are referred to as the short list by the engine and aircraft OEMs and DOD. Table 3.2 is a list of representative non-metallic materials used in gas turbine
18

engine and airframe fuel systems. Table 3.4 is a list of representative metals used in gas turbine engine and airframe fuel systems. The engine manufacturers, airplane manufacturers, and DOD have agreed to these generic classes of materials for the purpose of evaluating compatibility with fuels and fuel additives. The list of materials to be tested in Tables 3.2 and 3.4 include 15 nonmetallics and 15 metals, respectively.

3.2.3 Test Temperatures
Materials are to be tested at the highest temperature to which it will be subjected for its specific application within an aircraft and engine fuel system. Testing at temperatures beyond these maximums result in diminished baseline material performance and significantly reduces test sensitivity. The appropriate test temperature for each material is shown in Tables 3.2 and 3.4 along with the standard test procedure. Since 93 and 163 C are the most prevalent temperatures, materials are soaked in these two temperatures.

3.2.4 Screening Tests
If the OEMs determine that material compatibility testing is required, laboratory-scale soak tests shall be performed on the short list of materials compiled in Tables 3.2 and 3.4. Soak temperatures, test methods, and acceptance criteria are called out in Table 3.3. The soak period is 28 days and the test fluid shall be changed out every 14 days with fresh test fluid. The tests called out in Tables 3.2 and 3.3 compare changes in properties. For example; tensile strength, of materials soaked in the new fuel (or new fuel additive blend) to that of materials soaked in a baseline reference fuel(s). The tests are intended to be a first level screening to identify potential compatibility problems. If tests results are within allowable variation as defined in the evaluation

19

criteria for each material, then the risk level of the new fuel or fuel additive is considered minimal. TABLE 3.2 Non-Metallic Materials

3.2.5 Procedure for Soaking (Aging) Test Materials in Fuel
3.2.5.1 Material Procurement for the Soak Procedure
(1) Sealant, coating, and adhesive materials are typically procured in their raw (uncured) form. This often consists of a two-part mixture, pre-preg, or film. The integrity of the work relies on fabricating and testing equipment on facility. For example, once prepared, sealant specimens are required to be cured in environmentally controlled rooms (75Â°F and 50 % relative humidity). (2) Adhesive lap shear testing is done using aluminum adherents with the manufacturer's recommended surface preparation and cure cycle. (3) Foam materials are procured as a sheet of the material from the applicable vendor. These sheets are then utilized to die-out (cut out) the specimens required for the testing. (4) O-rings are also obtained directly from the vendors which manufacture materials meeting the various specifications. (5) Metallic specimens are obtained from various sources who can certify the materials to meet the applicable specifications. Typically, three specimens of each material are utilized in the aging of the metallic specimens. These specimens are roughly one inch by two inches. Thickness is not relevant as we are only looking at surface effects. While all the materials were being procured, there were few issues encountered. One of the issues was about US-Canada border customs; some of the materials needed over-protection for safety reasons. Another setback was the cost of materials. Since a small amount of material was needed, most vendors were not willing to sell their products in small quantities. Hence that generated a cost issue for the materials to be purchased in bulk.

21

3.2.5.2 Fuel Soak
(1) Materials are typically exposed to the fuel in separate glass mason jars (quart-size). Specimens of different materials are not aged in the same container because it is possible that components may leach out into the fuel and react with other material specimens or components. For example, the tensile & elongation and volume swell specimens of the AMS-S-8802 polysulfide sealant are aged in a separate jar from the AMS-3281 lightweight polysulfide tensile & elongation and volume swell specimens. (2) Tensile and elongation; volume swell; and hardness specimens must be suspended in the fuel and not just laid in the bottom of the jar. This can be done by using a rack and wires to hang the specimens, which can then be placed in the jar. (3) A piece of foil is placed over the mouth of the jar and then the lid is screwed into place to prevent evaporation of the fuel while aging. The foil should extend roughly one inch over all sides of the mouth of the jar. The heating of the quart-jars is done using explosion-proof ovens. These ovens can hold a large number of jars, so many specimens which require the same temperature can be aged simultaneously. (4) Fuel change out, that is, replacement of old fuel with fresh fuel, must be performed after 14 days for the 28-day aging of non-metallic specimens and after 7 days for the metallic specimens. Change out of the fuel is necessary because properties of the fuel can change significantly when exposed to high temperatures for an extended period of time.

22

3.2.7 Types of Tests to be performed after 28-Day Soak Period
3.2.7.1 Non-Metallic Materials
Examples of the tests to be performed on the non-metallic materials listed in Table A3.2 include the following: (1) Single Lap and Static Shear (2) Volume Swell (3) Tensile (4) Elongation (5) Tape Adhesion (6) Hardness The test results of each material shall conform to the requirements by ASTM 4054. Following table illustrates the requirements being sought.

3.2.7.2 Metals
Surface Evaluation--at the conclusion of the 28-day soak, the metal test specimens shall be removed from the test fluid, air dried, and examined visually and under low power of less than 50 times optical magnification. The objective is to inspect for evidence of staining, deposits, surface pits, or gross corrosion. Staining is considered a benign surface phenomenon. Staining results in no appreciable weight loss or gain and indicates the formation of a passive layer that inhibits corrosion. Subsequent to the initial examination, the metal surfaces shall be cleaned using acetone or alcohol and re-examined for surface pits. If desired, deposits can be preserved by evaporating the solvents and then storing in desiccators for future analysis.

3.2.8 Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation criterion for non-metallic materials is shown in Table 3.2. The approach is to look for significant variations in test values between the dry state and the candidate fuel. The allowable variations from the baseline fuel for Non-metallic materials are based on the precision and bias of the test method. Most of the materials have test requirements expressed as maximum or minimum values. These values are drawn from the material specification when applicable. If
24

there is no material specification or the specification does not have a fuel-soak requirement, then pass/fail criteria is gleaned from experience gained in previous investigations performed on similar materials.

Chapter 4 Materials and Methodology
4.1 Introduction
This chapter describes the physical properties of each material in details, and the equipments utilized for soaking based on products' Technical Data Sheet. As mentioned previously in Chapter 3, some of the materials are procured in raw form. Hence this chapter will also focus on the preparation of samples from those materials. The materials, utilized in this research, can be grouped in two categories: non-metallic and metallic.

4.2 Non-Metallic Materials
Non-metallic materials are categorized in 6 different types; adhesives, coating materials, films, foams, o-rings, and sealants.

4.2.1 Adhesives
Hysol EA 9394
Hysol EA 9394 is a structural paste adhesive formed of two parts and qualified to MMM-A-132 Rev A, Type I, Class 3. It cures at room temperature and possesses high strength to 350Â°F/177Â°C and higher. Its thixotropic nature and high temperature compressive strength also make it ideal for pottings, fillings, and liquid shim applications

Loctite 609
Loctite 609 is designed for the bonding of cylindrical fitting parts and meets the requirements of Military Specification Mil-R-46082B. The product cures when confined in the absence of air

26

between close fitting metal surfaces and prevents loosening and leakage from shock and vibration.

4.2.2 Coating Materials
EC 776SR
EC 776SR is a general purpose, solvent-based adhesive/coating with good adhesion to synthetic rubber, metal, glass, and many plastics. Since EC 776 and EC 776SR show very close physical characteristics, EC 776SR includes a red dye for identification purposes.

825X309
825X309 is a chemically cured acid and fluid resistant urethane coating intended for the protection against fuel contaminants. It provides protection for non-ferrous metals, against fresh or salt water, aircraft fuels, hydraulic fluids, engine oils and dilute acid solutions. It offers good adhesion to chemically treated surfaces and is unique in having good adhesion to titanium and stainless steel. It exhibits very good intercoat compatibility with sealants and touch-up materials when properly cleaned, even after long term exposure to fuel. 825X309 is used to protect the inside of an aircraft's fuel tank against corrosion from fuel contaminants. It is compatible with all current spray equipment, is easy to apply in a variety of environmental conditions, and meets the specification AMS-C-27725 Type II.

4.2.3 Foams
Crestfoam Crest SafeCrest reticulated polyurethane foams are suitable for explosion suppression and surge/noise mitigation and environmentally-friendly materials for use in fuel tanks of aircraft, boats, military vehicles, competition and emergency vehicles, automobiles and trucks- virtually
27

any vehicle where the possibility of fuel tank explosion exists, or where surge/noise mitigation is required.

4.2.4 O-Rings
Parker VM 128 VM128 is made of a low-temperature fluorocarbon polymer that results in functional seal performance down to -40Â°F (-40Â°C). Like other fluorocarbon compounds, VM128 has a +400Â°F (+200Â°C) upper temperature limit with very good compression set resistance. As application temperatures continue to climb, nitrile materials may no longer perform adequately. VM128 offers a substantial improvement in high temperature performance over these other seal material options. Fluorocarbon rubber as a polymer family has great chemical resistance. VM128 is fully compatible with all aerospace jet fuels and hydrocarbon-based hydraulic oils.

Sealants

There are 5 types of sealants to be tested in this work and the properties of each material are described in details below.

PR 1422-B
PR-1422 Class B is a two-part aircraft integral fuel tank sealant, which has a service temperature range from -65Â°F (-54Â°C) to 250Â°F (121Â°C), with intermittent excursions up to 275Â°F (135Â°C). This material is designed for fillet sealing of fuel tanks and other aircraft fuselage sealing applications. The cured sealant maintains very good elastomeric properties after prolonged exposure to both jet fuel and aviation gas. It cures at room temperature to form a resilient sealant having excellent adhesion to common aircraft substrates. It meets the specification MIL-S-8802.

PS 890
P/S 890 Class B, like PR 1422, is a two-part aircraft integral fuel tank sealant, which has a service temperature range from -65Â°F (-54Â°C) to 250Â°F (121Â°C), with intermittent excursions up to 275Â°F (135Â°C). This material is designed for fillet sealing of fuel tanks and other aircraft fuselage sealing applications. The cured sealant maintains very good elastomeric properties after prolonged exposure to both jet fuel and aviation gas. It cures at room temperature to form a resilient sealant having very good adhesion to common aircraft substrates. It meets the specification MIL-S-8802.

Q4 2817
Q4-2817 is a one-part, ready to use, high strength solvent-free fluorosilicone elastomer paste. It retains its properties under exposure to fuels, oils and solvents, exhibits very good adhesion and

29

bond strength to most materials. It is resistant to weathering, moisture and ozone and cures at room temperature to form a tough, rubbery solid.

PR 1828
PR-1828 Class B is a two-part rapid curing, primer-free to most common substrates, aircraft integral fuel tank sealant. It has a service temperature range from -80Â°F (-62Â°C) to 320Â°F (160Â°C), with intermittent excursions up to 420Â°F (216Â°C). This material is designed for fillet sealing of fuel tanks and other aircraft fuselage sealing applications. The cured sealant maintains very good elastomeric properties after prolonged exposure to both jet fuel and aviation gas. Unlike standard polysulfide fuel tank sealants, it can cure at low temperatures and is unaffected by changes in relative humidity. It has very good adhesion to common aircraft substrates and meets the specification AMS 3277.

PR 1776
PR 1776 is a two-part, high temperature resistant low gravity, fuel tank and fuselage sealant, based on Permapol P-5 liquid polymers, a chemically modified improved class of polysulfide polymers.

4.3.2 Titanium 8A1-1V-1MO, CP 70, 3Al-2.5V
Titanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Sometimes called the "space age metal", it has a low density and is a strong, lustrous, corrosion-resistant (including sea water, aqua regia and chlorine) transition metal with a silver color.

4.3.3 Inconel
Inconel is a registered trademark of Special Metals Corporation that refers to a family of austenitic nickel-chromium-based superalloys. Inconel alloys are typically used in high temperature applications. It is often referred to in English as "Inco" (or occasionally "Inconel"). Inconel 625 and 718 are to be used in this research.

4.3.4 Monel
Monel is a trademark of Special Metals Corporation for a series of nickel alloys, primarily composed of nickel (up to 67%) and copper, with some iron and other trace elements. Monel was created by David H. Browne, chief metallurgist for International Nickel Co. Monel alloy 400 is binary alloy of the same proportions of nickel and copper as is found naturally in the nickel ore from the Sudbury (Ontario) mines. Monel was named for company president Ambrose Monell,
31

and patented in 1906. One L was dropped, because family names were not allowed as trademarks at that time. Monel 400 is to be utilized in this research.

4.3.5 Waspaloy
Waspaloy is a registered trademark of United Technology Corp that refers to an age

hardening austenitic nickel-based super-alloy. Waspaloy is typically used in high temperature applications, particularly in gas turbines. Nominal composition: Nickel 58%, chromium 19%, cobalt 13%, molybdenum 4%, titanium 3%, and aluminum 1.4%.

4.3.6 Nickel
Nickel is a chemical element, with the chemical symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silverywhite lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. It is one of the four elements that are ferromagnetic around room temperature, the other three being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Nickel 400 is to be tested.

4.3.7 Stainless Steel
In metallurgy stainless steel, also known as inox steel or inox from French "inoxydable, is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of 10.5 or 11% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not stain, corrode, or rust as easily as ordinary steel, but it is not stain-proof. It is also called corrosion-resistant steel or CRES when the alloy type and grade are not detailed, particularly in the aviation industry. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment the alloy must endure. Stainless steel is used where both the properties of steel and resistance to corrosion are required. 304 and 17-4 pH are to be tested.

4.2 Equipments
4.2.1 Jars
Depending on the specimen size there are 2 types of jars to be used; Ball 67000 quart size wide mouth mason jars with 3.5" x 3.5" x 6.9" and Ball 68100 half gallon wide mouth mason jars with 4.5" x 4.5" x 9". And they are made sure to withstand the sought soak temperature and pressure forming inside.

Figure 4.2 Ball 68100 and 67000 Jars

4.2.2 Oven
Two indentical HS 3804 E series explosion-proof ovens are to be used for this experimental work. HS 3804 E contains friction-aired chamber, which can be used for a number of hazardous
33

work applications due to the unique operating concept of providing controlled heat without heating elements. This characteristic helps solve the problem of operational safety when operating in a Class 1, Group D processing environment by removing an ignition source.

4.3 Specimen Preparation
4.3.1 Adhesives
Hysol EA 9394
Hysol EA 9394, as stated in Table 3.2, is to be tested to evaluate lap shear strength with reference to ASTM D1002. Since the method being used is single lap shear, two aluminum 2024-T3 strips are employed. Since it is undesirable to exceed the yield point of the metal in tension during test, the permissible length of overlap in the specimen will vary with the thickness and type of metal, and on the general level of strength of the adhesive being investigated. As recommended by ASTM D1002 the overlap length, 12.7 mm (0.5 in).
34

Figure 4.4 Single Lap Shear Specimen

Figure 4.5 Prepared Lap Shear Specimens . The thickness of aluminum strips for EA 9394 is 0.063 in. Before bonding process, the contact areas are to be cleaned with acetone. And the surfaces stand several minutes while the chemical evaporates. Since Hysol EA 9394 consists of two parts, Part A and B, there is a mix ratio: by weight 100 Part A and 17 Part B. Metal strips are bonded together with 20 lb clamps and cured in an air circulating oven for 1 hour at 66 C.

35

Loctite 609
Loctite 609, as indicated in Table 3.2, is to be tested to evaluate its static shear strength with reference to ASTM D4562.

4.3.5 Sealants
Sealants, as indicated in Table 3.2, is to be tested to evaluate its tensile strength and elongation, hardness, and volume swell according to ASTM D412, D 2240, and D471 respectively. Since the nature of stated ASTM standards requires no substrate, there is no surface preparation. Uncured materials are to be moulded in order to obtain the shapes recommended by ASTM as shown in the following figure. Before pouring the material into the pockets, surfaces are degreased and cleaned thoroughly. Then, since the mould is made of aluminum, all the contact areas are sprayed with release agent prior to the moulding process in order to prevent sealants from sticking to the surface.

Figure 4.11 Sealant Tensile, Volume Swell, and Hardness Test Specimen Mould. As seen in Figure specimens are made in shapes of dumbbell and rectangular. Dumbbell specimens are moulded in accordance with ASTM D412 Die C. Hardness and volume swell specimens are represented by dotted and dashed areas respectively. The thickness of dumbbell and volume swell specimens is 2 mm. Hardness specimens are 6 mm thick. Figure 4.12 shows the examples of cured sealant specimens.

Chapter 5 Results and Discussions
In this chapter, after 28-day soak period, the results of experimental work for each material are shown. Some results are depicted in graphic form in order to show the mechanical responses of elastomers under whether tensile or compressive force. As for metallic materials, results will be shown in pictorial form in Appendix section.

5.1 Test Results of Elastomers
5.1.1 Lap Shear Test Results
As stated in Table 3.2 Hysol product is subject to ASTM D1002 single lap shear test and 3 samples of each material are tested. After being soaked for 28 days in Jet A fuel, samples are taken out of the jars and tested in accordance with ASTM D1002. The testing machine, as suggested, is capable of maintaining a rate of loading of 0.05 in. /min. It is provided with a suitable pair of self-aligning grips to hold the specimen. Specimens are placed in the grips of the testing machine so that the outer 25 mm (1 in.) of each end are in contact with the jaws and so that the long axis of the test specimen coincides with the direction of applied pull through the center line of the grip assembly. Subsequent to specimen mounting, load is applied at the rate of 0.05 in. /min as mentioned above. The following data is the results obtained from the computer.( ASTM D1002-01, Standard Test Method for Apparent Shear Strength of Single-LapJoint Adhesively Bonded Metal Specimens by Tension Loading (Metal-to-Metal), Section 5 & 6).

5.1.2 Static Shear Test Results
After the static shear specimens removed from the jar, they are conditioned at room temperature for a while. Once they are ready, they are placed, as instructed in ASTM D4562, on the universal test machine as shown in Fig. 3 and loaded smoothly at about 500 lb./s (2200 N/s) using a free crosshead speed of 0.05 in./min (1.3 mm/min). (ASTM D4562-01, Standard Test Method for Shear Strength of Adhesives Using Pin-and-Collar Specimen, ASTM D5363, Standard Specification for Anaerobic Single-Component Adhesives, and MIL-R-46082, Retaining Compounds, Single Component, Anaerobic.). The static shear strength is calculated by dividing the breakaway load by the bond area as follows:

5.1.3 Tape Adhesion Test Results
EC 776SR and 825x309
As stated in ASTM 4054 both materials are subject to ASTM D3359 tape adhesion. For tape adhesion, there are two methods of testing recommended but Method A is the procedure to be followed. For tape adhesion there are few apparatus needed such as sharp razor blade, cutting guide, 1in. wide semitransparent pressure-sensitive tape, rubber eraser on the end of a pencil and a good source of light. An area clean, dry and free of blemishes is selected. Then two cuts, which intersect in the middle with 40 degree angle, of 1.5 in. length are made in the film with one steady motion. A piece of about 3 in. (75 mm) long tape is cut and the center of the tape is placed at the intersection of the cuts with the tape running in the same direction as the smaller angles. The tape by finger is placed in the area of the incisions and then is rubbed firmly with the eraser on the end of a pencil. Within 90 Â± 30 s of application, remove the tape is removed by seizing the free end and pulling it off rapidly (not jerked) back upon itself at as close to an angle of 180Â° as possible. The test is repeated in two other locations on each test panel. Two specimens are tested from each material and the adhesion is rated in accordance with the following scale: 5A No peeling or removal, 4A Trace peeling or removal along incisions or at their intersection, 3A Jagged removal along incisions up to 1/16 in. (1.6 mm) on either side, 2A Jagged removal along most of incisions up to 1/8 in. (3.2 mm) on either side, 1A Removal from most of the area of the X under the tape, 0A Removal beyond the area of the X (ASTM D3359-02, Standard Test Methods for Measuring Adhesion by Tape Test.)

49

Dry Test results; Since there is not any trace of removal observed on both specimens for EC 776 SR and 825x309, they are rated 5A according to the scale given above. Post-Soak Test results; After the soak period, the same method is applied to specimens and there is no any trace of removal observed. Hence, both EC 776 SR and 825x309 are rated 5A.

5.1.4 Pencil Hardness Test Results
EC 776SR and 825x309
For pencil hardness a set of calibrated wood pencils, pencil holder cart with 45 degree angle, pencil sharpener, and abrasive paper with grit No. 400 are needed. Pencil tips are made sure to be smooth and flat by rubbing the pencil against the abrasive paper at 90 degree. The coated panel is placed to be tested on a level, firm horizontal surface. Pencil is placed in the scratcher cart and positioned at a 45 degree angle to the test panel. Starting with hardest lead cart is pushed away exerting enough force to either crush the lead edge or scratch/mar the paint. Length of the strokes is Â¼ in. minimum. Process is repeated by selecting and testing the leads (going from harder to softer) until a lead is tested that will not mar or scratch the coated surface. The materials are rated in accordance with the following scale: 6H-5H-4H-3H-2H-H-F-HB-B-2B-3B-4B-5B-6B (ASTM D3363-05, Standard Test Method for Film Hardness by Pencil Test.) Dry Test results; Starting from the softest one, it is found out that EC 776SR is rated 3H and 825x309 is rated higher than 6H.
50

Post-Soak Test results; At the end of soak period, starting from the softest one, it is found out that EC 776SR is rated H and 825x309 is rated, as dry try test results, higher than 6H.

5.1.5 Tensile and Elongation Test Results
Referring to Table 3.2 O ring, sealant, foam, and film specimens are subject to tensile and elongation test.As mention in Chapter 3 test procedure will be in compliance with ASTM D412 and D1414. Both test standards require a universal tensile machine with 500 mm/min grip separation rate is used. Since ASTM D1414 is designated for O-rings, grips for testing consist of ball-bearing spools 9 mm diameter, and is capable of being brought within 19 mm center to center distance at closest approach. With this method materials tensile strenght and ultimate elongation rate are evaluated.( ASTM D412-98a, Standard Test Methods for Vulcanized Rubber and Thermoplastic Elastomers-Tension and ASTM D1414-94, Standard Test Methods for Rubber O-Rings.) Tensile Strength (TS) = F/A F = Breakforce A = twice the cross-sectional area calculated from actual thickness, W= 0.07 in, as follows: = pi*W^2*2 = 1.57* W^2 => TS= F/ (1.57* W^2)

Ultimate elongation, % = [2D + G -C] x 100 D = distance between centers of the spool grips at the time of rupture of specimen, G = circumference of one spool (spool diameter x 3.14) = 0.2 x 3.14 = 0.628 in. C = inside circumference of the specimen (or inside diameter x 3.14) = (1.239-014) x 3.14 = 3.45 in

5.1.6 Volume Swell Test Results
For volume swell evaluation ASTM D471 is being used. Since Jet A is water-insoluable, water displacement for water-insoluable liquids method is conducted. Three specimens are tested and average result is taken into consideration. The mass M1(g) of each specimen in air is obtained to the nearest 1 mg, and then the mass M2(g) of each specimen is obtained immersed in distilled water at room temperature. Each specimen is dipped in alcohol to remove water, blotted dry with filter paper free of lint and foreign material, and placed in a mason jar to complete the 28-day immersion test at 93 C. At the end of the required immersion period, each specimen is removed from the test tube. The specimens are cooled to room temperature by transferring them to a cool, clean portion of the test liquid for 30 to 60 min, and then dipped quickly in acetone at room temperature, blotted lightly with filter paper free of lint or foreign material, placed in a tarred, stoppered weighing bottle, weighed, and the mass is recorded as M3(g). Each specimen is removed from the bottle, weighed in distilled water, and the mass is recorded as M4(g) in immediate consecutive order to determine the water displacement after immersion. Three specimens are tested and average result is taken into consideration (ASTM D471-98e1, Standard Test Method for Rubber Property-Effect of Liquids).

5.2 Visual Inspection Results
As mentioned in Chapter 4, metallic specimens are to be inspected visually for both surface and microstructural evaluations. Surface Evaluation--before the 28-day soak period, the metal test specimens are examined visually and under low power (50X) optical magnification. The objective is to compare any surface deformation between pre-soak and post-soak states. After the examination of dry specimens, they are soaked for 28 days. At the end of the 28-day soak period, specimens are inspected for evidence of staining, deposits, surface pits, or gross corrosion. Staining is considered a benign surface phenomenon. Staining results in no appreciable weight loss or gain and indicates the formation of a passive layer that inhibits corrosion. Subsequent to the initial examination, the metal surfaces are cleaned using acetone or alcohol and re-examined for surface pits. Figures illustrated in the Appendix section is the depiction of comparison between pre-soak and post-soak states (ASTM D4054-09, Standard Practice for Qualification and Approval of New Aviation Turbine Fuels and Fuel Additives, Section A3).

5.3 Discussions
As stated before, evaluating the compatibility of selected engine materials with kerosene is the main theme of this research. Hence evaluation criteria is based on the test results and the allowable variation from baseline which represents dry test results. For Hysol EA 9394, as given above in Section 5.1, being exposed to kerosene for 28 days had a significant impact on its shear strength properties. The average strength decrased from 3144 to 1415 psi, which indicates 55 % reduction on products performance. Another tested adhesive is Loctite 609 and was subject to static shear test. At the end of the 28-day soak period it is

observed that exposure to kerosene improves its static shear strength; dry test results show the average of 3330 psi and post-soak tests result in 3723 psi. Although, the improvement of mechanical response after soaking apears unconventional, but this type of improvement has been reported before (see William G. Fortener Susan S. Saliba, 2005 Fuel System Materials Compatibility Testing of Fuel Additives for Reducing the Amount of Small Particulate in Turbine Engine Exhaust.). Another series of test were performed on the effect of soaking on testspecimens coated with EC 776SR and 825x309. These coated specimens were tested for pensile hardness and peeling tests before and after soaking. As for tape adhesion (peeling test) both before and after soak they were rated 5A which indicates no removal on the surface. In pencil hardness they exhibit different performance; EC 776SR is rated 3H before soak and H after soak, 825x309 is rated higher than 6H both before and after soak. In this research work, O-Ring specimens were subject to tensile, volume swell, and hardness tests. The soaking resulted in a significant decrease in tensile properties. Aaverage tensile strength and elongation rate dropped from 2218 psi and 405 % to 1573 psi and 192 %. In terms of volume swell performance materials were swollen by 35 %. Shore M hardness results showed significant difference between post and pre soak states and hardness value increased from 73 to 82 shore M reading scale. Upilex-S was the only film to be tested. Only tensile and elongation characteristics were of interest. Average tensile strength of the material fell from 18107 to 15934 psi whereas elongation rate rose from 40.5 to 44.2 % after soaking. Similarly, only CrestFoam foam was to be studied. And the only concern was on its tensile and elongation properties. As illustrated in the results section the drop in tensile strength was
81

insignificant, 11 psi before soak and 10.6 psi after soak. Such argument could also be made for elongation rate as the drop in elongation of 504 to 427 % was experienced. There were 5 types of sealants to be tested in accordance with volume swell, tensile, and hardness tests. Among the sealants PS 890 showed the lowest volume change by 6 %. PR 1776 and PR 1828 had the highest rate of change by 18 %. The remaining two sealants, PR 1422 and Q4-2817 experienced a volume swell of 16 and 9 % respectively. As for hardness evaluation PR1422 had 57 Shore A for both pre and post soak states. PS 890 had an increase of 7 points due to soaking from presoak of 51 on shore A scale to 58 respectively. Similarly, Q4-2817 experienced an increase of hardness by 9 points after soaked, from 45 to 54 on shore A scale. Comparing to PS 890 and Q4-2817, PR 1828 has a low increase in its hardness value, 44 pre-soak and 49 postsoak on same shore A scale. PR 1776 is the only sealant to get softer after incubation. However, the drop in its hardness was not significant, 49 pre soak and 48 post-soak. They also illustrated interesting results in terms of tensile and elongation characteristics. PR 1422 had a significant decrease in both tensile strength and elongation rate; tensile strength drops from 523 to 375 psi and elongation from 547 to 388 %. PS 890 showed similar results but the decrease in tensile strength was less significant; tensile strength decreased from 320 to 270 psi and elongation from 540 to 300 %. Q4-2817 was the most resilient sealant, showing very close characteristic between pre-soak and post-soak states; 573 psi tensile strength , 567 % elongation initially , and 545 psi, 450 % after being soaked. Another detrimentally affected sealant is PR 1776; both in tensile strength and elongation a notable drop was observed. Tensile strength and elongation decreased from 384 to 217 psi and 471 to 197 % respectively. PR 1828 also followed the same trend as its tensile strength and elongation dropped noticeably from 505 to 395 psi. The noteworthy decrease

82

was in elongation rate from 880 to 296 %. The primary reason for these results could be attributed to the hardening of the materials after soaking. Metallic materials were intended to be inspected visually under low magnification both before and after soak in order to trace staining, corrosion or any other form of surface deformation. As the results indicate, there were no significant staining corrosion or surface pits.

Chapter 6 Conclusions and Recommendations
As stated before, the purpose of this research was to determine the compatibility of a list of nonmetallic and metallic materials prescribed by ASTM with Jet fuels (Kerosene in this case), and after the results were obtained, each material was assessed through the eligibility criteria (TABLE 3.3). There was a major problem encountered during the preparation of sealant specimens; the very first specimens contained bubbles and voids because of the viscous nature of sealants and that caused a noteworthy decrease in physical properties especially tensile strength. The issue was sorted out by applying vibration over the moulds. Sealants show a great deal of compatibility with kerosene; there has been no issue with tensile strength and elongation, volume swell, and hardness. PR 1828, comparing to rest of the sealants, shows really poor results specifically in tensile properties but still meets the requirements. As for coatings, results provided that 825x309 perfectly conform to the requirements. The same judgment cannot be made for EC 776SR, even though it meets the tape adhesion requirement, since hardness value dropped by 2 levels from 3H to H. Hence EC 776SR failed in meeting the pencil hardness requirement which shall be above or equal to the dry test result. Adhesive EA 9394 performed poorly after being fuel-wetted; lap shear strength was mandated to be over 1500 psi but 1415 psi was obtained. Since only 3 specimens were tested, and even though the results obtained from each were really close, there was not sufficient statistical data to make judgments whether the material is recommended or not. Another adhesive Loctite 609 presented a good characteristic which meets the requirements. Since the surface preparation and
84

clamp pressure were important on material's performance, specimens were prepared and tested before soak in order to get optimum results. Overall it is recommended to test numerous adhesive specimens to obtain more stable statistical data. O-ring product VM 128 failed to meet the requirements, both volume-swell and hardness test. The O-ring showed 35% volume swell and an increase in hardness by 9 points which should be between 0 and 10 %, and Â± 5 points from pre-soaked state respectively. According to the technical data sheet, the optimum operation condition is between 50 and 150 C. Since the material was soaked at 163 C, another material or lower temperatures may be suggested. Upilex-S Kapton film and Crestfoam have no compatibility issues. Metallic materials were not affected at all by the fuel used in this work. Overall, through many steps including material procurement, specimen preparation, generating plots for application of ASTM standards, and purchasing and calibration of test equipments inhouse capability of F.R.A.M.E.S. reached a level that future alternative fuel studies can easily be conducted.
