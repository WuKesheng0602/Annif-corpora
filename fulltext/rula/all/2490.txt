Mobile  Survey  November  2008  
§ Book  Study  Rooms   § Check  hours  and  schedule   § Check  borrower  record   § Search  Catalogue   § Over  half  wanted  to  search  for  articles   § Slightly  less  than  half  ­  read  ebooks  

What  we  learned  
§ Approximately  20%  of  our  population  had  

Internet-enabled  smart  phones   § Potential  for  most  of  our  population  having   these  phones  within  3  years   § Data  plan  costs  are  a  deterrent  to  use   § We  should  be  looking  at  personalized  services
