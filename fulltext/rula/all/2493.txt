§ Introduction   § Brief  history  of  the  mobile  phone   § Shift  from  e-  to  m-learning   § Student  Mobile  Usage     § Mobile  Services  for  Libraries   § Future  Trends  

The  Information  Landscape  is  Changing.  

Sept  13th  1956  ­  IBM  invents  first  Hard  drive.    Weighs  a   ton  and  costs  $250,000  USD  (approx.,  in  today's  dollars)   and  stores  a  whopping  5MB  of  information  

Jan  27th  2009  ­  single  hard  drive  with   largest  capacity  on  the  market  sells  for   $400  (approx.)  holds  2TBs  (Two  Million   MBs)  of  information  

Interesting  Facts  from  "How  much  data  is  that?":  

·  Complete  works  of  Shakespeare  =  5MB     ·  Content  in  an  Academic  Research  Library  =  2TBs   ·  Library  of  Congress  print  holdings  =  10TBs   ·  All  printed  material  in  the  world  =  200  Petabytes  (204,800  TBs)  

Don't  worry,  we  are  not  going  to  get  into  a  debate  on  digitization...      

Concept  to  remember:       There  has  been  a  major  change  over  the  years  in  the  
way  information  has  been  acquired,  stored  and   consumed.  

§ What  matters:    
ú The  content   ú Relevance  to  the  user   ú Understandability  

Wires  no  more.  

Humans  are  mobile  creatures  

§ The  way  we  acquire,  store,  

consume  and  utilize  information   has  changed  rapidly.  

§ The  desired  content  should  
ú Emphasis  on  usability  

seamlessly  display  on  all  device   types  

Before  we  continue...  
§ A  brief  history  of  the  mobile  phone   § Why?  
"  Only  a  good-for-nothing             is  not    interested  in             his  past.  "                                            ­  Sigmund  Freud  
  

  

"History  is  the  witness  that  testifies  to  the  passing  of   time;  it  illuminates  reality,  vitalizes  memory,  provides   guidance  in  daily  life,  and  brings  us  tidings  of  antiquity."                   ­  Cicero

Technologies   § Powerful  technologies  which  can  adapt  to  our   mobile  lifestyles  

   How  does  this  fit  within  academic  institutions   and  especially  for  libraries?  

E-learning  has  become  a  substantial  building  block   within  higher  education.     
§ Many  benefits:  
ú 24  hour  access  to  resources   ú On  or  off  campus  access  (as  long  as  one  has  internet  

access)   ú Distance  Education  

From  "e-"  to  "m-"  Learning  
§ m-learning  extends  the  e-learning  concept  

by  adding  the  mobile  computing  element  
ú Access  to  resources  wherever  you  are   ú Strong  searching  capabilities   ú Rich  User  Interaction  

ú Independence  from  a  location  in  space  and  

time  

Students  entering  University  have  been  exposed  to  an   assortment  of  technological  devices  
  
·  iPods  and  other  MP3  players,  iPhone  and   BlackBerry  smart-phones,  cell-phones,   PDA's,  personal  gaming  devices,  e-book   readers,  GPS  devices,  DVD  players,  digital   cameras  and  video  cameras.     

§ Technologies  cause  

problems:  

- Attention  during  lectures  

(i.e.,  web-  surfing,  gaming)   - Disruptions  (i.e.,  cell   phones)  

§ Technologies  assist  in  

learning:  

ú designing  engaging  

learning  experiences     ú Alternative  teaching   methods  
  Multi-media     Discovery  of  information   from  the  internet  

Library's  Role  in  this  shift  
§ Information  needs  of  patrons  

are  changing   § Library  must  cater  to  this   adapting  needs  
ú No  longer  answering  

"Encyclopedia  Style"  questions.   ú Performing  deeper  levels  of   service  
  Comparing  Strengths  and   Weaknesses  of  various  resources  for   the  patrons     Engaging  in  reference  interviews   about  complex,  often  obscure  topics   not  easily  searchable  on  the  internet  

  

Library's  Role  in  this  shift  
§ Facilitate  the  delivery  

of  these  resources  to   patron  devices   § Information  needs  to   be  formatted  properly   for  that  device  and   should  be  contextually   relevant  to  their   location  in  space  and   time.
