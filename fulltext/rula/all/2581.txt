1.  Introduction   Although  postcards  first  appeared  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century,  it  wasn't  until  the   beginning  of  the  twentieth  century  that  the  craze  for  collecting  of  postcards  commenced  in   earnest.    The  period  from  1900  to  1914,  the  beginning  of  World  War  I,  is  often  identified  as   the  "Golden  Age  of  Picture  Postcards."    It  is  during  this  period  that  economic  and  socio- cultural  factors  encouraged  the  exchange  and  collection  of  postcards.      In  Canada,  these   factors  facilitated  the  publishing  of  postcards  depicting  various  scenes  of  the  City  of   Toronto.   In  2011  an  anonymous  donor  gave  the  Art  Gallery  of  Ontario  (AGO)  one  hundred   and  sixteen  postcards  to  be  added  to  its  Photography  Collection.    The  postcards  were   published  from  the  1900s  to  1950s  with  a  predominant  number  produced  during  the  first   three  decades  of  the  twentieth  century.    The  views  reproduced  on  the  cards  depict  public   buildings,  street  scenes  and  recreational  events  with  forty-one  of  them  showing  scenes   from  the  Canadian  National  Exhibition.    In  addition  the  postcards  display  a  variety  of   techniques  used  to  mechanically  reproduce  the  image  on  the  recto  of  the  card.   This  applied  thesis  entails  the  full  cataloguing  and  illustration  of  the  one  hundred   and  sixteen  postcards  currently  catalogued  using  The  Museum  System  (TMS)  database   software.    The  objectives  of  the  thesis  are  to  verify  and  to  expand  upon  the  information   available  in  TMS  with  the  aim  of  encouraging  a  greater  access  to  the  collection  by   researchers.   My  research  included  visiting  the  Baldwin  Room  of  the  Toronto  Reference  Library   and  the  Ryerson  Archives  and  the  City  of  Toronto  Archives  to  research  information   pertaining  to  the  AGO  postcards.    These  visits  were  undertaken  to  verify  information   already  present  in  the  AGO  TMS  database  and  proved  invaluable  in  contextualizing  the  AGO      1  

collection  and  furthering  my  understanding  of  the  production  of  postcards  in  Toronto  at   the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century.   My  thesis  incorporates  an  essay  and  an  illustrated  catalogue.    The  essay  portion   contains  a  literature  review  focused  on  the  history  of  and  cataloguing  of  postcards,  and  an   account  of  the  methodology  employed  to  produce  the  thesis.    The  body  of  the  essay  is   divided  into  three  sections  and  expands  upon  information  first  offered  in  the  literature   review.    The  first  section  discusses  historical  and  economic  factors  related  to  the  City  of   Toronto  and  the  production  of  postcards.    The  second  section  offers  a  description  and   analysis  of  the  AGO  postcards  and  is  followed  by  a  conclusion.     The  catalogue  is  the  largest  component  of  the  thesis.    An  introduction  defines  each   of  the  fields  employed  in  the  cataloguing  process.    The  catalogue  contains  one  hundred  and   sixteen  records  and  two  hundred  and  thirty-two  illustrations  of  the  recto  and  verso  of  each   card.    Appendix  1  listing  the  Toronto  publishers  of  the  AGO  postcards  and  Appendix  2   offering  a  brief  description  of  the  photomechanical  reproduction  techniques  employed  in   the  production  of  the  postcards  precedes  the  bibliography.

2.  Literature  Review   Cataloguing  Postcards:  A  Rationale      By  way  of  introducing  a  discussion  concerned  with  cataloguing  the  AGO  postcards,  I  

felt  it  important  to  consider  the  basis  upon  which  an  image  databases  may  be  accessed:   postcards  are  not  commonly  catalogued  at  the  item  level  and  when  they  are  the  catalogue   record  tends  to  offer  only  rudimentary  information.   Sara  Shatford  Layne  in  her  essay,  "Some  Issues  in  the  Indexing  of  Images"  (1994)   notes  that  the  indexing  of  images  should  be  based  on  their  attributes.    She  suggests  that   these  attributes  be  divided  into  four  categories:  biographical,  subjective,  exemplified  and   relationship.    Layne  contends  that  employing  these  categories  will  provide  access  to  both   individual  and  groupings  of  images.    Biographical  attributes  entail  objective  information   related  to  the  creator  of  the  image,  time  of  creation  and  the  geographical  location  of  the   depicted  subject  and  the  site  of  production.    Subjective  attributes  combine  objective   observation  and  subjective  interpretation  of  the  image,  list  specific  and  generic   descriptions  of  the  image,  and  record  time,  space,  activities  and  events.    Exemplified   attributes  distinguish  between  the  subject  of  the  image  and  the  image  object.    Relationship   attributes  point  to  the  existence  and  nature  of  significant  associations  between  textual  and   image  works.1   In  Elizabeth  Edward's  Anthropology  &  Photography  1860-1920,  Joanna  C.  Scherer   makes  the  case  for  the  use  of  photographs  as  a  "...  reliable  evidence  open  to  analysis  and   interpretation  as  seen  through  the  interrelationship  of  the  photographer,  subject  and

different  photographers  or  the  same  scene  photographed  by  the  same  photographer  over   time  can  be  arranged  and  analyzed  systematically  to  measure  change  in  the  urban   environment.9     Carol  Sawyer  and  David  Butler  in  their  essay,  "The  Use  of  Historical  Picture   Postcards  as  Photographic  Sources  for  Examining  Environmental  Change:  Promises  and   Problems"(2010)  suggest  that  postcards  are  a  low-cost  alternative  to  historical   photographs  for  education  and  research  purposes.10  However  they  also  report  that   postcards  are  not  without  problems  as  they  are  susceptible  to  distortion  by  publishers  and   photographers.    Distortions  arise  due  to  the  colouring  in  the  production  of  the  postcard  and   with  the  elimination  and  addition  of  visual  elements  not  present  in  the  original  photograph.     These  processes  are  often  employed  to  disguise  photographs  taken  by  someone  other  than   the  publisher  or  to  highlight  certain  elements  over  others.11      Nonetheless  the  authors   contend  that  because  of  their  abundance  in  the  later  part  of  the  nineteenth  and  early  part  of   the  twentieth  century,  picture  postcards  afford  useful  visual  data  depicting  environmental   conditions  prior  to  the  introduction  of  aerial  photography  in  the  1950s.       Picture  postcards  collected  by  individuals  and  institutions  are  often  thought  of  as   novelty  artifacts  evidencing  behaviours  associated  with  mass  communication  and  social   mores.    Arreola  and  Burkhardt,  Sawyer  and  Butler  argue  that  picture  postcards  have   considerable  value  as  documents  of  a  particular  time  and  space  for  research  purposes  in   urban  geography.    This  argument  can  easily  be  extended  to  include  other  disciplines  such

By  way  of  contextualizing  this  collection  of  postcards  I  considered  factors  affecting  

the  growth  of  the  City  of  Toronto  at  the  turn  of  the  century  to  better  contextualize  the  AGO   collection  of  postcards.    A  number  of  sources,  including  The  Canadian  City:  Essays  in  Urban   and  Social  History  by  Gilbert  A.  Stelter  and  Alan  F.  J.  Artibise,17  offer  an  overview  of  ideas   related  to  civic  planning  and  architectural  styles  in  evidence  during  the  period  under   consideration.    The  essays,  "Visuality  and  the  Emergence  of  City  Planning  in  Early   Twentieth-Century  Toronto  and  Montreal"18  and  "Picturing  the  Professionalization  of   Planning  in  Canada,  1901-1927"19  by  Sarah  Bassnett,  offer  a  discussion  of  ideas  that  were   to  shape  the  development  of  Toronto  into  a  modern  metropolis.      The  History  of  Picture  Postcards   Richard  Carline's  book,  Pictures  in  the  Post:  The  Story  of  the  Picture  Postcard   (1971),20  and  Frank  Staff's,  The  Picture  Postcard  and  Its  Origin  (1966),21  offer  a  general   historical  overview  of  the  picture  postcard  from  its  beginnings  to  the  mid  nineteenth   century.    Bjarne  Rogan's  essay,  "An  Entangled  Object:  The  Picture  Postcard  as  Souvenir  and   Collectible,  Exchange  and  Ritual  Communication"  (2005)22  provides  an  analysis  of  the   cultural  impact  of  the  postcard  in  the  modern  age.    Howard  Woody's,  "International   Postcards:  Their  History,  Production  and  Distribution  (Circa  1895  to  1915)"  included  in

   3.  Methodology     On  examining  the  electronic  records  in  AGO's  The  Museum  System  (TMS)  catalogue   of  the  one  hundred  and  sixteen  postcards  I  observed  that  some  information  was  missing  or   incomplete  and  that  information  already  entered  into  the  database  system  required   verification.    When  first  considered  for  accession  by  the  AGO's  Photography  Collection  a   temporary  ID  number  was  assigned  to  each  of  the  postcards  and  a  document  titled  "Initial   Examination  Survey"  was  completed  by  the  gallery's  Art  Conservation  Department   Photography  Laboratory.    When  the  donor  gave  the  postcards  to  the  AGO  he  or  she  was   unable  to  supply  information  concerning  the  production  and  history  of  the  postcards.    At   the  time  I  began  to  work  with  the  cards  there  had  been  no  research  undertaken  to  add  to   the  existing  electronic  records.   I  began  the  process  of  cataloguing  the  postcards  by  researching  which  TMS   catalogue  fields  were  pertinent  to  the  cataloguing  of  postcards,  and  if  information  was   missing  and  was  required  to  be  moved  to  other  fields.    I  also  examined  the  postcards  for   inscriptions  and  marks  that  needed  to  be  added  to  the  database.   I  consulted  the  Print  Collection  Cataloguing  Manual  developed  by  David  Harris  in   2001  for  the  Mira  Godard  Study  Centre  (MGSC),  Ryerson  University  and  The  Museum   System  (TMS)  database  (2012  version)  used  by  the  AGO  in  order  to  select  the  appropriate   fields  to  be  used.    I  also  considered  The  Getty  Research  Institute's  online  Art  &  Architecture   Thesaurus®  (AAT)  and  Rules  for  Archival  Description  (RAD)  to  determine  the  appropriate   terminology  and  format  for  information  to  be  used  for  the  cataloguing  of  the  postcards.   David  Harris  developed  the  manual  for  cataloguing  photographic  objects  to  be  used   in  conjunction  with  the  FileMaker  Pro  database  software  employed  by  the  MGSC  in  2001.

The  manual  stipulates  twelve  required  fields  and  sixteen  optional  fields  to  be  used  when   additional  information  becomes  available.    The  twenty-eight  fields  offer  a  full  cataloguing   record  and  are  similar  to  the  fields  available  in  TMS.    My  goal  was  to  select  a  set  of  fields   similar  to  the  TMS  to  ensure  the  easy  transference  of  information  electronically  to  the   AGO's  database.    The  resulting  catalogue  using  TMS  fields  will  also  exist  as  a  stand-alone   reference  for  researchers.    As  a  result  I  selected  fourteen  fields  for  the  cataloguing  of  the   AGO  postcards.    A  description  of  the  fields  can  be  found  in  the  introduction  to  the  Catalogue   section  of  this  thesis  that  follows  the  Conclusion.      The  postcards  are  presently  stored  in  the  Print  &  Drawing  vault  adjacent  to  the  

Marvin  Gelber  Print  &  Drawing  Centre  on  the  AGO's  main  floor.    The  postcards  are  wrapped   in  tissue  and  housed  in  an  acid  free,  lignin  free  archival  box.    As  a  graduate  student  in  the   Photographic  Preservation  and  Collections  Management  Program  at  Ryerson  University   and  assigned  to  the  AGO,  I  was  granted  access  to  the  vault  unaccompanied  to  examine  the   postcards.      I  first  measured  each  postcard  to  determine  the  dimensions  of  the  image  and  the  

support  and  recorded  inscriptions  and  marks  on  the  recto  and  verso  of  each  postcard.   Additionally  I  examined  the  image  on  the  recto  of  each  card  to  determine  the   photomechanical  reproductive  process  used  to  print  the  image  and  thus  confirm   information  listed  in  the  AGO's  "Initial  Examination  Survey  Report".      By  way  of  commencing  the  research  phase  of  the  project  I  began  gathering  

biographical  information  related  to  the  twenty-seven  publishers  of  the  postcards.    Six  cards   were  without  a  publisher.    Additionally  I  created  a  list  of  the  subject  of  each  of  the   postcards  and  began  to  gather  historical  and  architectural  information  that  I  intended  to   add  to  the  catalogue.      12  

  

I  contacted  Alan  Walker,  Special  Collections  Department,  Toronto  Reference  Library  

(TRL)  to  arrange  a  visit  to  review  their  collection  of  Toronto  postcards  in  an  effort  to   determine  if  other  dates  than  those  offered  by  postmarks  on  thirty-seven  cards  could   indicate  productions  dates.    I  was  able  to  view  photocopies  of  the  cards  during  my  initial   visit  to  the  TRL.    On  a  subsequent  visit  I  requested  and  was  able  to  view  a  select  group  of   original  postcards  similar  to  the  AGO  postcards.    As  a  result  I  discovered  similar  postcards   to  those  in  the  AGO  collection  that  were  produced  by  different  publishers.   On  the  completion  of  my  visit  to  the  Baldwin  Room,  I  visited  the  Ryerson  University   Archives  to  research  information  related  to  four  of  the  AGO  postcards  showing  the  Normal   School  located  at  St.  James  Square.    The  Normal  School  was  located  on  the  grounds  of   Ryerson  Institute  of  Technology  (now  Ryerson  University).    The  building  was  demolished   in  1958  and  the  façade  of  the  Normal  School  is  presently  installed  on  the  southern  edge  of   the  Ryerson  Community  Park  behind  Kerr  Hall  South.    My  visit  resulted  in  identifying  the   photographer  for  one  the  AGO  postcards.    Because  of  a  photograph  by  Alexander  W.   Galbraith  of  the  Normal  School  credited  to  the  City  of  Toronto  Archives  discovered  in  the   Ryerson  University  Archives  I  contacted  and  met  with  Patrick  Cummins,  the  archivist   specializing  in  photographic,  cartographic  and  architectural  records  at  the  City  of  Toronto   Archives  about  the  possibility  of  establishing  the  identity  of  other  photographers   responsible  for  images  used  in  the  production  of  the  AGO  postcards.

   4.  Toronto  at  the  Beginning  of  the  Twentieth  Century   a.  City  Building      The  AGO  postcards  of  Toronto  depict  public  buildings  including  churches,  cultural  

and  educational  institutions,  street  scenes  and  recreational  activities.    The  earliest  card  is   dated  between  1902  and  1910  and  the  latest  between  1955  and  1964.    However  a   predominant  number  of  the  cards  were  produced  in  the  first  three  decades  of  the  twentieth   century.    Many  of  the  buildings  represented  on  the  cards  were  constructed  during  this  time,   including  those  located  on  the  Canadian  National  Exhibition  grounds.    With  my  goal  of   contextualizing  the  production  of  the  AGO  postcards  I  researched  events  occurring  in  the   City  of  Toronto  during  these  years.      Between  1881  and  1921  Canada's  urban  population  increased  in  absolute  terms  

from  1.1  million  to  4.3  million.30    This  was  due  in  part  to  migration  from  surrounding  rural   areas  as  well  as  immigration  from  Eastern  Europe  and  Asia.    In  1871  the  British  accounted   for  95%  of  the  population  of  Toronto  dropping  to  80%  at  the  beginning  of  the  century.    In   1911,  manufacturing  accounted  for  37%,  building  trades  11%,  domestics  10%  and   professionals  7%  of  the  population.    By  1931  manufacturing  accounted  for  20%,  building   trades  7%,  domestics  4%  and  professionals  9%  and  hospitality  12%  of  the  population.31   The  area  encompassed  by  the  city  grew  substantially  during  this  time  as  well.     Boundaries  were  extended  to  incorporate  North  Rosedale  (1906);  Deer  Park  &  East   Toronto  (1908);  West  Toronto  (1909);  Dovercourt  &  Earlscourt  (1910)  and  North  Toronto

the  twentieth  century.    These  included  the  Art  Gallery  of  Toronto  (1916-18),  later  to  be   renamed  the  Art  Gallery  of  Ontario,  and  the  Royal  Ontario  Museum  (1910-11).34    Toronto   underwent  significant  civic  improvements  with  the  construction  of  its  City  Hall  in  1900,  the   Prince  Edward  Viaduct  (1915-1919),  the  R.  C.  Harris  Filtration  Plant  (planned  in  1913  and   constructed  in  1930)  and  the  High  Level  Pumping  Station  (1906).35    In  the  area  of  health,   the  Toronto  General  Hospital  moved  to  its  present  location  at  College  Street  and  University   Avenue  from  its  eastern  location  at  Gerrard  and  Parliament  Streets  in  1914  and  the  public   health  nursing  service  was  created  in  1908.36      Toronto's  architecture  was  greatly  influenced  in  part  by  the  work  of  Henry  Hobson  

Richardson  (1836-1886)  and  the  Chicago  School  of  architecture  described  below.     Richardson  employed  the  Romanesque  style  of  northern  Italy  that  became  known  as   "Rchardson  Romanesque"  and  can  be  observed  in  the  construction  of  Toronto's  City  Hall,

With  unprecedented  growth  the  City  of  Toronto  proceeded  to  attend  to  issues  

associated  with  over  crowding,  sanitation,  housing  reform  and  civic  beautification.    The   early  part  of  the  twentieth  century  also  recorded  the  first  enterprises  in  the  area  of  low   cost  public  housing  with  the  establishment  of  the  Toronto  Housing  Company  in  1914  to   build  Spruce  Court  in  Cabbagetown  and  Riverdale  Courts  east  of  the  Don  River.39    The   Ontario  Association  of  Architects  (1889),  The  Architectural  Eighteen  Club  (1900),  The   Toronto  Guild  of  Civic  Art  (1897),  the  Town  Planning  Institute  of  Canada  (1919)  and  the   National  Council  of  Women  of  Canada  (1893)  promoted  ideas  related  to  city  planning  in  an   effort  to  regulate  urban  growth  and  to  ensure  the  health  and  well  being  of  its  citizenship.    It   was  generally  thought  that  an  efficiently  managed  and  aesthetically  constructed  city  would   result  in  greater  prosperity  for  all  the  citizens  of  Toronto.40      b.  The  Role  of  Photography  in  Toronto      In  1910  the  City  Council  of  Toronto  began  an  investigation  of  the  management  of  

departments  under  the  control  of  the  City  Engineer's  Office.    As  a  result,  the  council   reorganized  the  City  Engineer's  Office  and  in  1912  created  the  Works  Department  with   Roland  C.  Harris  as  the  Commissioner  of  Works  and  City  Engineering.    The  new  department

5.  AGO  Postcards  of  Toronto:  Description  and  Analysis   The  history  of  postcards  begins  with  the  introduction  of  the  Correspondenze  Karte   (correspondence  card)  in  1869  in  Austria  and  proceeds  to  the  1870s  and  1880s  when  cards   derived  from  line  drawings  and  block  prints  were  mass-produced  for  tourists,  promotion   and  collectors.47    Developments  in  the  printing  of  postcards  and  changing  postal   regulations  produced  discrete  historical  periods  as  follows:  the  Pioneer  Era  (pre  1898),   Private  Mailing  Card  (1898  to  1901),  Undivided  Back  era  (1901  to  1907),  Divided  Back  era   (1907  to  1915),  White  Border  era  (1915  to  1930),  Linen  era  (1930  to  1945)  and  the  Photo   Chrome  era  (1945  to  today).    The  craze  for  postcards  reaches  its  zenith  during  the  "Golden   Age  of  Postcards"  (1900-1914)  corresponding  to  the  Divided  era.48   As  early  as  1889  a  photograph  was  used  in  the  production  of  a  postcard  and  Blum   and  Degan  of  London  and  Valentine  &  Sons  of  Dundee  incorporated  photography  to   produce  postcards  as  early  as  1898.49    Images  by  commercial  photographers  significantly   impacted  the  quality  in  the  production  of  postcards.    Professional  photographers  skilled  in   the  composition  and  production  of  images  displaying  sharp  detail  and  tonality  were  able  to   produce  prints  appropriate  for  the  various  mechanical  reproductive  processes  used  to   produce  postcards.50    The  earliest  mechanical  reproductive  process  employed  in  the   production  of  postcards  was  the  collotype.51    With  the  introduction  of  rotary  presses  in   1905  and  the  lithographic  offset  press  in  1908  high  quality  postcards  employing

photographic  images  were  produced  in  the  millions.    By  1905,  seven  billion  cards  had   passed  through  the  world's  post  offices.52     The  production  cycle  of  postcards  began  with  an  individual  known  as  a  jobber  or   drummer  acting  as  sales  person  for  regional,  national  and  international  distributor  and   manufacturers  of  postcards.    It  is  through  the  jobbers  that  the  retailers  arranged  with   wholesalers  for  the  production  of  postcards  according  to  specifications.    In  some  instances   a  single  company  assumed  the  roles  of  publisher,  printer  and  distributor  of  postcards.     Individual  entrepreneurs,  independent  printers  and  publishers  of  educational  texts  who   saw  the  potential  profits  arising  from  the  postcard  craze  began  to  produce  or  commission   their  own  photographs  for  postcard  use.53       The  AGO  postcards  reveal  a  similar  history  to  the  production  and  distribution  of   postcards  internationally.    Twenty-seven  publishers  are  identified  on  the  verso  of  one   hundred  and  ten  of  their  postcards.    Of  the  twenty-seven  publishers,  seventeen  were  local   or  regional,  six  national  and  four  international  publishers  of  postcards.    The  Valentine  &   Sons  Publishing  Co.  Ltd,  of  Montreal  and  Toronto  (1903-1922)  established  by  Valentine  of   Dundee  Ltd.  of  Scotland  also  maintained  offices  in  South  Africa,  Australia,  America  and   Norway  as  well  as  Canada.    According  to  one  account,  the  Valentine  &  Sons  Co.  Ltd.   produced  twenty  thousand  views  of  Canada.54    Over  eight  hundred  of  these  views  are  of   Toronto.55    Valentine  &  Sons  Company  is  represented  by  fifty-one  postcards  in  the  AGO   collection.    Other  contributors  to  the  AGO  collection  are  the  Warwick  Bro's  &  Rutter,

Limited,  Printers  (8),  W.  G.  MacFarlane  Publishing  Co.  Ltd.  (6),  the  Royal  Specialty  Sales  Co.   (5),  and  The  Post  Card  &  Greeting  Card  Co.  Ltd.  (4).    Gardiner,  Thomson  &  Bowles,  the   Kiwanis  Club  of  West  Toronto,  the  Photogelatine  Engraving  Co.  Ltd.,  Souvenir  Post  Card  Co.   and  the  Valentine-Black  Co.  Ltd  are  each  represented  by  three  postcards.    The  Canadian   View  Card  Co.  and  the  E.  Zaitchick,  Canadian  National  Exhibition  are  represented  by  two   postcards  each.    The  remaining  identified  publishers  are  represented  by  one  card  each.   (See  Appendix  I  for  a  full  list  of  publishers).   Three  events  shaped  the  production  and  dissemination  of  postcards  in  Canada  at   the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century.    In  1903  the  relaxation  of  Canadian  postal   regulations  lead  to  the  introduction  of  the  divided  back  postcard.56    The  divided  back   allowed  for  both  the  message  and  the  address  to  be  written  on  the  verso  of  the  card  and   increased  the  demand  for  postcards  to  be  sent  through  the  mail.    Publishers  were   encouraged  to  invest  in  the  production  of  postcards  and  the  W.  G.  MacFarlane  and  Warwick   Bro's  &  Rutter  are  two  of  the  earliest  firms  to  take  advantage  of  the  new  regulation.    The   second  is  the  passing  of  the  Payne-Aldrich  Act  of  1909  by  the  United  States.    The  act   imposed  a  tariff  on  foreign  items,  including  postcards,  entering  the  United  States.    The   result  was  to  create  a  glut  of  postcards  as  sponsors  and  jobbers  stocked  up  on  cards  before   the  act  was  to  take  effect  leading  to  a  decline  in  the  price  of  postcards  in  the  United  States.     Access  to  the  American  market  plus  the  decline  in  price  of  cards  greatly  reduced  the   postcard  production  in  Canada.    It  seems  that  the  W.  G.  MacFarlane  Co.  ceased  production   of  cards  in  1910  in  part  due  to  the  act.57    Finally,  World  War  I  curtailed  production  of   postcards  worldwide.    Many  publishers  including  those  producing  the  AGO  postcards  of

Toronto  had  relied  on  the  superior  printing  facilities  offered  by  German  companies.    Due  to   shortages  of  paper  and  ink,  and  the  redirecting  of  supplies  to  the  war  effort,  the  production   of  postcards,  a  novelty  item  for  many  publishers,  was  unsustainable.    A  limited  number  of   publishers  including  Valentine  &  Sons  continued  to  produce  postcards  after  the  war.     In  all  but  two  cases  the  AGO  postcards  show  a  printed  title  on  the  recto  of  the   postcard.    The  names  of  significant  buildings  such  as  the  Royal  Ontario  Museum   (constructed  in  1910-11),  the  Carnegie  Library  (constructed  in  1906-09)  and  Government   House  (constructed  in  1911-15)  are  clearly  prominent  in  the  title.    Other  titles,  for  example,   Technical  School  and  College  Street,  Toronto,  identify  a  structure  and  the  street  on  which   the  building  is  located  and  includes  a  streetcar  and  a  horse  drawn  carriage,  subjects  that   are  common  place  for  a  city  undergoing  modernization.    Some  titles  identify  a  street  such   as  St.  George  Street  to  show  quiet  neighbourhoods  or  bustling  thoroughfares.    Recreational   events  such  as  picnicking  on  Toronto  Islands  or  attending  the  Canadian  National  Exhibition   are  also  common  scenes.    Additionally  cards  such  as,  Lagoon  at  Island  Park,  Toronto  and   Humber  River  View  reproduce  bucolic  scenes.    Thus  the  AGO  collection  of  postcards  depicts   a  cross  section  of  views  of  buildings,  streets,  events  and  landscapes  in  Toronto.    Taken   together  we  can  consider  postcards  as  a  means  of  circulating  photographs  of  significant   changes  taking  place  in  the  City  of  Toronto  thus  educating  the  citizenry  and  encouraging   newcomers  to  visit.   The  AGO  postcards  manifest  specific  uses  and  reasons  for  their  production.     Postcards  published  by  the  Dept.  of  Publicity,  Canadian  National  Exhibition,  the  Advertising   Dept.  Walker  House,  the  Walter  M.  Lowney  Co.  of  Canada  Ltd.  and  the  Kiwanis  Club  of  West   Toronto  are  specifically  produced  for  promotional  purposes.    The  cards  published  by  the   CNE  and  the  Kiwanis  Club  also  contain  biographical  information  related  to  attendance.    The      22  

card  by  Walker  House  announces  a  specific  event  related  to  an  exhibition  of  airplanes  in   Toronto  commencing  after  World  War  I  and  promotes  the  availability  of  rooms  at  the  hotel.     A  postcard  depicting  Fort  York  and  published  by  the  Toronto  Convention  &  Tourist   Association  highlights  the  history  of  a  notable  landmark  of  the  City  of  Toronto  to  citizens   and  visitors  to  Toronto.       The  postcard  titled  Toronto,  St.  George  Street  (see  page  146  of  the  catalogue)  and   published  by  W.  J.  Cage  Co.  of  Toronto  displays  the  imprint  of  the  Galbraith  Photo  Co.  and   offers  an  opportunity  to  consider  the  exchange  of  photographs  between  photographers  and   the  publishers  of  postcards.    The  Galbraith  Photo  Co.  operated  by  Alexander  W.  Galbraith   was  established  in  1901  and  continued  operation  until  1922.    The  Canadian  View  Card   Company  published  a  postcard  titled  St.  George  Street,  Toronto  (see  page  147  of  the   catalogue)  identical  to  the  postcard  published  by  the  W.  J.  Cage  Co.    Thus  two  postcards   bearing  the  same  image  by  the  same  photographer  but  reproduced  by  two  different   publishers  suggests  that  the  photographer  may  have  made  his  photographs  available  to   more  than  one  publisher  or  that  publishers  may  have  sold  photographs  to  other  publishers.   While  rare  that  the  photographer  of  the  image  on  the  postcard  is  identified,  the  AGO   collection  contains  four  postcards  reproducing  photographs  by  Galbraith  Photo  Co.    Two   postcards  are  published  by  The  Canadian  View  Card  Co.,  one  by  the  W.  J.  Gage  Co.  Ltd.  and   the  last  by  an  unknown  publisher.    The  postcard  by  the  unknown  publisher  depicts  the   Armouries  (see  page  36  of  the  catalogue)  once  located  just  north  of  the  intersection  of   Queen  Street  West  and  University  Avenue.    Online  research  has  revealed  that  both   Warwick  Bro's  &  Rutter  Co.  and  Arthur  Strauss  Inc.  reproduced  the  same  image.    From  this   we  can  infer  that  the  Galbraith  Photo  Co.  sold  the  same  photographs  to  multiple  publishers.     Research  has  shown  that  Galbraith  also  dealt  with  the  Canadian  National  Exhibition  in      23  

Toronto58.    At  this  time  it  is  not  possible  to  confirm  if  he  was  also  responsible  for  the   photographs  used  in  the  production  of  postcards  depicting  scenes  of  the  CNE.   As  reported  above,  publishers  often  manipulated  the  photographs  they  published.     The  AGO  collection  contains  an  example  of  one  form  of  this  manipulation.    Two  postcards   titled,  A  Glimpse  of  the  Manufacturers'  Building,  Toronto  Exhibition  by  night  (fig.  1)  and  A   Glimpse  of  the  Manufacturers'  Building,  Toronto  Exhibition,  Canada  (fig.  2)  are  of  the  same   image.    The  latter  depicts  a  daylight  scene  while  the  former  shows  a  darkened  sky  with   clouds  and  a  `halo'  of  light  around  each  of  the  streetlights  to  give  the  impression  of  a   nighttime  view.

A  comparison  of  the  AGO  postcard  collection  with  the  TRL's  shows  more  dramatic   changes.    The  Valentine-Black  Co.  Ltd.  produced  two  postcards  with  the  same  image  and   title,  "Sunnyside"  Toronto,  Canada.    The  postcard  located  at  the  TRL  depicts  what  appears  to   be  an  aerial  view  of  Sunnyside  Park  (fig.  3);  whereas  the  AGO  postcard  has  been  altered  by   the  elimination  of  poles,  the  shape  of  the  automobiles  and  the  use  of  saturated  colour  (fig.   4).    The  image  on  the  AGO  postcard  titled,  King  Street,  Toronto,  Canada  (fig.  5)  and   published  by  the  W.  G.  MacFarlane  Co.  Ltd.  was  also  reproduced  by  Raphael  Tuck  &  Sons   and  titled  Toronto,  King  Street  (fig.  6).    The  AGO  card  depicts  street  level  view  with  subdued   colour  while  the  `Tuck'  postcard  exhibits  brighter  colours  and  the  marked  inclusion  of  a   figure  with  a  cane  crossing  the  street  followed  by  a  dog  absent  from  the  W.  G.  MacFarlane   Co.,  Ltd.  postcard.

The  comparison  of  these  two  postcards  poses  questions  related  to  the  processes  used  and   dates  of  their  production  as  well  as  their  intended  audiences.    We  know  that  the  W.  G.   MacFarlane  Co.,  Ltd.  located  in  Toronto,  published  postcards  between  1902  and  1910  while   Raphael  Tuck  &  Sons  located  in  London,  England  published  greeting  cards  including   postcards  between  1866  and  1960.    It  appears  that  the  image  for  this  postcard  migrated   from  Toronto  to  London  possibly  when  W.  G.  MacFarlane  Co.,  Ltd.  ceased  producing   postcards  and  possibly  sold  the  image  to  Raphael  Tuck  &  Sons.    We  might  also  conclude   that  "Tuck"  had  greater  resources  to  take  advantage  of  the  image  for  retail.

   While  different  publishers  published  the  same  photograph,  and  while  they  felt  free   to  add  colour,  figures  or  eliminate  parts  of  the  image  they  did  not  want,  they  also  produced   different-looking  postcards  by  printing  the  photograph  with  different  processes.    Valentine   &  Sons  Co.  Ltd.  published  a  colour  postcard  titled,  York  Pioneers  House,  Exhibition  Grounds   at  Sunset,  Toronto,  Canada  (fig  7)  employing  the  letterpress  halftone  process.    They   published  the  same  image  using  the  collotype  process  to  produce  a  monochromatic  image   with  a  different  design.  (fig.  8).    The  latter  was  produced  prior  to  1908  and  the  former  after   that  year  when  the  Valentine  &  Sons  Co.  Ltd.  had  adopted  the  motto  `famous  throughout   the  world'.

At  the  beginning  of  the  "Golden  Age  of  Postcards"  (1900  to  1914)  the  quality  of   postcards  was  paramount.    Postcards  produced  using  the  collotype  and  rotogravure   processes  were  popular  with  the  public,  postcard  clubs  and  collectors  fueling  the  demand   for  further  production.    However,  by  1912,  increased  production  costs  and  the  availability   of  production  supplies  diminished  the  quality  of  postcards  and  signaled  the  end  of  the   Golden  Age.    The  white  borders  of  the  White  Border  era  (1915-1930)  marked  a  means  for   publishers  to  save  on  the  cost  of  ink  and  paper.    As  well  as  production  and  supply   difficulties  a  lack  of  new  subject  views,  the  inactivity  of  postcard  clubs  and  collectors  and   the  dwindling  of  profits  caused  by  a  glut  of  postcard  also  contributed  to  the  decline  of  the   Golden  Age.    But  as  postcards  were  responsible  for  creating  "a  historical  visual  record  that   encompassed  the  world"59  their  diminishing  popularity  is  equally  owed  to  the  publication   of  photography  in  popular  magazines  and  newspapers.60    Photographs  in  these  mass  media   finally  displaced  the  postcard  as  means  for  the  distribution  of  photographic  imagery.

   Conclusion      The  full  cataloguing  of  the  Art  Gallery  of  Ontario's  collection  of  one  hundred  and  

sixteen  postcards  offers  the  opportunity  to  consider  both  the  histories  of  postcards  and  the   City  of  Toronto  in  the  opening  decades  of  the  twentieth  century.    I  have  argued  that   postcards  offer  a  visual  documentation  for  the  study  of  changes  in  the  urban  environment.     Postcards  can  also  be  shown  to  be  a  successful  means  for  the  dissemination  of   photographic  imagery  prior  to  the  introduction  of  photographs  in  the  popular  media  of  the   day.    While  we  can  observe  the  manipulation  of  the  photographic  image  the  significance  of   the  content  of  the  image  of  postcards  should  not  be  dismissed.    The  depiction  of  major   institutions  including  the  Royal  Ontario  Museum  and  Toronto's  Main  Reference  Library   constructed  from  1906  to  1911  reveals  a  city  in  the  throes  of  modernization.    The  scenes  of   the  Toronto  Industrial  Exhibition  and  the  Canadian  National  Exhibition  show  Toronto  as  a   burgeoning  centre  for  commerce  and  tourism.    Scenes  of  the  public  picnicking  on  the   Toronto  Islands  and  visiting  Hanlan's  Point  and  Sunnyside  Amusement  Parks  depict  the   extent  of  Toronto's  recreational  facilities.      Additionally  the  AGO  postcards  offer  an  occasion  to  consider  the  economic  

relationships  between  photographers  and  publishers,  and  publishers  and  publishers  of   postcards.    While  the  collection  has  revealed  Alexander  W.  Galbraith  as  a  photographer   producing  images  for  postcards,  it  is  possible  with  further  research  to  identify  other   commercial  photographers  working  in  Toronto  during  the  period  from  1900  to  1930.    For   example,  Henry  Pellat  the  original  owner  of  Casa  Loma  often  engaged  the  services  of  

  

29  

William  James,  a  successful  Toronto  commercial  photographer  from  1909  to  the  1930s.61    It   may  be  possible  to  ascribe  images  on  the  postcards  of  Casa  Loma  to  him.    It  is  hoped  that   further  research  will  expand  upon  the  information  included  in  the  cataloguing  of  the  AGO   postcards  to  supplement  existing  information  about  commercial  photography  in  the  City  of   Toronto  at  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century.   Finally  the  humble  photographic  postcard  can  offer  information  gleaned  from  its   content  and  production  to  further  our  understanding  of  the  modernization  of  the  City  of   Toronto  and  commercial  photography  adding  to  an  as  yet  unwritten  history  of   photography.

   Appendix  2:  List  of  Photomechanical  Reproductive  Processes      Chromolithography   The  chromolithographic  process  involved  the  printing  of  multiple  colours  employing   multiple  plates.    Each  plate  contained  a  printable  image  transferred  from  paper  and  etched.     The  stone  is  then  inked  with  the  selected  colour  and  printed  in  register  with  a  "key"  plate.     Stones  allowed  for  solid  areas  of  colour  and  stippling  (large  dot  pattern).    Detail  is  visible  in   solid  colours  and  areas  where  the  dot  pattern  diffuses  the  colour.    Two  overlaid   transparent  colours  can  produce  a  third  colour.      Collotype   The  collotype  shares  with  lithography  the  incompatibility  of  oil  and  water  to  describe  the   printing  surface.    Unlike  lithography  the  collotype  plates  employ  a  reticulated  gelatin   coating  to  produce  an  image  derived  from  a  continuous-tone  negative.    The  collotype  plate   moved  underneath  a  series  of  ink  rollers  and  under  a  cylinder  holding  the  paper  the  image   was  to  be  deposited  on.    As  the  cylinder  came  into  contact  with  the  printing  plate  a  single   impression  of  ink  is  transferred  to  the  paper.    Colour  collotypes  can  be  achieved  with  the   use  of  three-colour  separation  negatives  to  produce  three  collotype  plates  and  registered   multiple  printing.    Colour  can  also  be  added  using  stencils  and  applying  paints  over  the   stencils  by  hand.          Gravure   The  gravure  process  combines  etching  and  aquatint  to  produce  an  image  similar  to  a   carbon  print.    A  polished  copper  plate  is  dusted  with  acid  resistant  grains  similar  to  the   aquatint  process.      Carbon/gelatin  tissue  with  red  pigment  is  sensitized  to  light  and   exposed  to  a  film  or  glass  plate  to  produce  a  positive  image.    This  carbon/gelatin  image  is   then  pressed  to  the  copper  plate,  the  tissue  is  removed  with  the  use  of  hot  water  and  the   plate  is  etched  using  ferric  chloride  in  water  transferring  the  image  to  the  copper  plate.     The  absorption  of  water  by  the  gelatin  permits  the  ferric  chloride  to  etch  the  dark  and  light   areas  of  the  image.    When  the  plate  is  finished  etching  the  resist  and  aquatint  are  removed.     The  plate  now  displays  a  set  of  pits  that  have  been  etched  inversely  proportional  to  the   thickness  of  the  gelatin  layer.    When  inked  the  plate  reveals  continuous  tonality.     Photogravures  are  produced  using  flat  plates  while  rotogravures  employ  a  series  of   cylinders  to  ink  and  transport  paper  for  the  image  to  be  transferred.

Letterpress  Halftone   The  letterpress  halftone  process  commences  with  the  production  of  a  halftone  negative  of   an  original  image  through  a  ruled  screen  of  tiny  apertures.    When  exposed  to  a  sensitized   plate  and  developed  in  a  high  contrast  developer,  these  tiny  apertures  produce  dots  of   various  sizes  in  relation  to  the  intensity  of  illumination  by  the  original.    The  halftone   negative  is  contacted  printed  onto  a  light-sensitive  resist  deposited  on  a  copper  plate.    The   resist  is  hardened  where  exposed  to  light  and  is  soft  where  the  resist  is  unexposed.    The   plate  is  washed  and  the  soft  resist  is  removed.    The  plate  is  then  etched  in  an  acid  bath   dissolving  area  where  the  copper  plate  is  bare  between  the  dots.    The  undercutting  of  the   copper  plate  by  the  acid  diminished  the  size  of  the  dots  resulting  in  a  lighter  print.          Photo  Offset  Lithography   Having  its  origins  in  chromolithography,  photo  offset  lithography  employs  metal  plates  and   the  refinement  of  the  halftone  screen  to  reproduce  the  photographic  image.    The  process   involved  the  transfer  of  an  image  on  an  inked  metal  plate  to  a  rubber  blanket  and  then  onto   paper  with  the  use  of  three  cylinders  arranged  above  each  other.    The  photo  offset   lithographic  process  allows  for  300  dots  per  linear  inch  producing  an  image  with  finer   tonal  gradation  unlike  the  letterpress  halftone  limited  to  150  dots  per  linear  inch.
