ABSTRACT Robert C. Kraut's Japan: Cataloguing and Contextualizing a Post World War Two Photographic Album of Japan and the South Pacific at the Art Gallery of Ontario,

Steven Kramer, Masters of Arts 2013 Photographic Preservation and Collections Management Ryerson University in association with the Art Gallery of Ontario

This applied thesis examines three albums created by US Army Air Force personnel Robert C. Kraut from 1945-46. The albums were donated by Toronto based artist Max Dean to the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), and serve as a case study for the process of cataloguing and contextualizing albums for future researchers and museum staff. This paper includes a literature survey examining care and handling, social and historical evolutions, and cataloguing practices related to both photographic albums and scrapbooks. An historical analysis of the photographic album as a medium, vernacular photography and the donation process of the albums into the AGO's collection follows. A detailed analysis of the narrative, material orientation, annotation, layout and materiality qualities for each album is included. A cataloguing methodology that both accounts for the albums' unique layouts and holds to the established conventions for cataloguing albums at the AGO is discussed and described in detail.

INTRODUCTION
There are at least two narratives to nearly every photographic album. First, there is the narrative the compiler consciously and deliberately created, and secondly there are additional narratives that manifest themselves and can be unearthed through an examination of the juxtaposition of the album's images, the varying material used throughout, as well as through external factors such as the identity of the album's compiler, the point in history when the album was created and where it was created. The purpose of this applied thesis project is to catalogue three photographic albums of post World War Two Japan complied by a US Army Air Force personnel, Robert C. Kraut, which are currently at the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), to reveal some of these narratives through the examination of the present and available information within the albums. All of this will be accomplished through the application of various methods of handling, and cataloguing and will incorporate insight provided by numerous literary sources that have dealt with the concept of the photographic album as well as additional research regarding specificities of the album's content. It wasn't until the 1860s that commercially produced albums, specifically created to serve as photographic albums, were being mass produced. However, previous to the photographic album, scrapbooking, had been practiced for decades, thus providing a template for the attitudes and creative expression that became the trend for compiling the photographic album. While the primary focus of this thesis is the cataloguing of the albums, secondary contextualizing research will also be carried out in order to into provide a framework for better understanding this body of work. Additional research into the subjects photographed and the photographer will also help to formulate a context for these albums.

This thesis paper will also provide a step-by-step narrative of the challenges faced and decisions made regarding cataloguing methods, handling and preservation practices consistent with standards at the Art Gallery of Ontario. In addition to this narrative, catalogue entries will be provided within the appendix portion of these thesis. A visual geographical aid will also accompany the appendix material which will indicate the locations documented and photographed throughout the course of the three albums. During all of these practices and applied efforts, the goal of this thesis is to provide this body of work and the AGO with a comprehensive record of these objects, as well as additional information about the subjects of the photographs and their compiler, Robert C. Kraut. Such analysis will also provide the AGO staff and future researchers with additional context for these albums that will aid in their access, preservation and possible display.

LITERATURE SURVEY
To insure that this applied thesis project was done correctly and the decisions involving handling and cataloguing of the albums were carefully considered, I identified multiple areas of necessary research, all relating to elements of preservation and interpretation of the photographic album. By examining multiple sources, approaches, methodologies and theories a much broader understanding of how the object's uniqueness plays a role in the decision making of cataloguing and handling albums could be exposed, thus presenting options for handling this body of work. In addition to looking at handling and cataloguing methods, I also examined the social history of the photographic album. For this reason the following literature review will be split into two main areas of focus; literature based on the examination of the social aspects of the album, and literature that delves into preservation aspects of handling albums.
Preservation and Care of Albums and Scrapbooks

In his 2008 book The Printed Picture Richard Benson, examines that evolution of the techniques of print making from the Renaissance to the present day. The publication also serves as an aid for identifying photographic process and educating his readers about their differences. Benson's book not only explores the photographic medium but also photomechanical and nonphotographic print processes. One of the themes Benson investigates throughout his book is the phenomenon of publishing and reproducing images on a large scale in the form of books, albums and magazines.. While examining the role of multiple types of image making and their effects and uses throughout history and society, Benson attributes the album's creation to a demand for storage of people's growing image collection. In his 2009 book Photographs of the Past Process and Preservation, Bertrand LavÃ©drine's presents a wide range of issues on how to preserve pre-digital photographs and

3

photographic objects. Only a page, however, of LavÃ©drine's text delves into preservation concerns regarding the photographic album. LavÃ©drine expresses the importance of maintaining albums in their original state, in order that the narrative and individuality of the object is not lost. Increased chance of physical damage is cited as the main concerns and rationale for not removing photographic material from albums. However, LavÃ©drine does acknowledge that if kept in their original state photographic material does run the risk of possible degradation if images remain in albums constructed of low grade materials. Whereas LavÃ©drine only spent a page on photographic album preservation, Shannon Zachary's devotes her entire publication: Conservation of Scrapbooks and Albums: Postprints of the Book and Paper Group/Photographic Materials Group Joint Session at the 27th Annual Meeting of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, June 11, 1999, St. Louis, Missouri to examining various concerns and issues surrounding the photographic album. Unlike LavÃ©drine's publication, Zachary's is a compilation from different authors and contributors each focusing on specialized concerns, case studies, reports and other topics regarding the varying aspects of photographic albums. Chapters 2 and 3 of the publication, written by Richard Horton, examines what he calls, historical photographic albums, as well as providing the reader with a glossary of terms related to photographic albums. The remainder of the publication focuses primarily on historical contextualizing of multiple albums as well as the process through which the albums were conserved, treated and restored based on their unique structural damage and level of degradation. Such a source provides not only multiple case studies of album preservation and restoration, but also provides a vocabulary for albums and scrapbooks. In her 2012 thesis: "Housing the Family: Re-Housing the Peterkin Family (Theresa Bywater Peterkin) Carte-de-visite and Cabinet Portrait Album at the Art Gallery of Ontario"

4

author Melodie Hueber explores the multi-faceted nature of the photographic album. Not only does Hueber develop a historical contextualization of the medium found in the album she catalogued, in this case the cartes-de-visite, but she also describes the methods she chose as her preferred handling and cataloguing methods. Through her research into the various care and handling methods, Hueber is able to amalgamate various approaches to create a method of rehousing that works specifically for her body of work. This object-based specialization is carried over to her method of cataloguing as well. Hueber created a template for recording and imputing catalog data that describes the album's structure and arrangement but stays within the cataloguing format of the Art Gallery of Ontario's cataloguing database. Such a source provided a starting point for this thesis, as both the body of work covered by Hueber and the subjects of her thesis are part of the AGO's collection.

Social Aspects of Albums and Scrapbooks. Martha Langford's 2008 book Suspended Conversations: The Afterlife of Memory in Photographic Albums examines photographic albums not just from an historical or structural perspective, but from a cultural and social vantage point. Langford delves into concepts of visual narrative and communication and doesn't really address preservation treatments but she does discuss the importance in keeping albums intact in their original form so as not to disturb their narrative. Langford also discusses the need for an accompanying oral presentation as a way to eliminate, the mystery that so often surrounds albums after their creators are no longer around to tell their story. However, Langford also shows us how she was able to piece together clues from the album's materials, construction and presentation which provide valuable information about the history and narrative of the album.

Barbara Levine and Stephanie Snyder's 2006 Snapshot Chronicles: Inventing the American Photo Album examines the creative aspect of the photographic album. The bulk of the book is dedicated to visuals of various albums, displaying numerous layouts, album structures, subject matter and photographic process. Like Langford, attention to preservation is not the focus of the publication but rather the social aspect of album compilation and narration. Snyder also provides a historical narrative about the events that lead up the commercialization of the photographic album and how the rise of vernacular photography aided in the albums growth as a means of displaying and housing photographs. The book not only highlights the photographic aspect of the album but also notes the importance of annotation when interpreting an album. Verna Posever Curtis's book: Photographic Memory: The Album in the Age of Photography is a collaborative publication that draws on the expertise of multiple authors. The book provides an historical examination of not only the rise of the photographic album, but the origins of the album itself, dating back to the Renaissance. The remainder of the book examines and contextualizes several individual albums from the Library of Congress collection, with emphasis being on how the photographs in each album take on the central role. The publication is heavily illustrated, presenting both the album covers and several pages from each. The aim of this publication is to present the reader with the social and historical narratives of each album. However, the book does provide approaches to proper preservation and housing as well as explanations behind why structural degradation in albums can and will occur. In the final chapter of the book, "Preserving Photographic Albums" contributors Alan Haley and Adrienne Lundgren provide an historical timeline of the photographic album. Both identify causes and challenges when faced with physical and chemical changes. The overall stability of the album is also

6

discussed, as Haley and Lundgren state that the stability of any album is dependent on the materials used to consruct the album.1 While the book The Scapbook in American Life by Susan Tucker, Katherine Ott and Patricia P. Buckler, may not focus primarily on the photographic album, contributor Sarah McNair Vosmeier 's chapter "Picturing Land and Friendship: Photograph Albums and Networks of Affection in the 1860" does. Specifically, Vosmeier's chapter examines how romantic relationships were both represented in photographic form, during the mid 19th century, as well as how they were shared and displayed. Through the examination of multiple albums, Vosmeier is able to unearth much about youth culture and the presence of both hetero and homosexual displays of affection. Vosmeier explains that like other personal objects (i.e. a locket of hair) received from one's partner, lover, family member or close friend, photographs soon came to be seen as a memento of the individual. Thus the need for a means to store and display ones collection of photographs was created: the album. Much like Verna Posever Curtis's book, graphic designer Jessica Helfand's Scrapbooks: An American History examines the medium by presenting readers multiple scrapbooks that span time and are diverse in subject matter. All the albums, however, focus on various elements of US history from 1913 to 1989. Examination into composition, annotations, and material used reflect the culture of the American public and the methods of communication in their time. Through this examination, Helferd claims that the scrapbook moved away from the decorative craft it started out as, to that of a celebration of one's individualism. Due to Helfand's background as a graphic designer, the elements of composition and communication are the primary focus of this publication.

With the aid of these literary resources, I was able to develop my own approach in regards to the decision making process when I was determining the best methods of contextualizing, handling, and cataloguing the three albums involved in this thesis. The decisions chosen were selected not only for the albums' sake but also as a means to provide future researchers and AGO staff with as much contextual data about the albums as well as maintain the original essence of the albums and their narrative.

A HISTORIC BACKGROUND OF ALBUMS AND SCRAPBOOKS Understanding Albums In order to interpret and contextualize the albums, an examination into the history and social culture surrounding the concept of the photographic album is needed. The power and value of an album is derived not only from the subjects or events documented, but also in the authorship and artistic expression created through the juxtaposition of varying mediums and forms to formulate a narrative.2 Each album provides a unique study of visual communication expressing a story of both the compiler and the time they lived in. Much can be gleaned from the content of the photographs in the albums chosen for this thesis, however my focus will be limited to the album's significance in the context of a museum collection. Instead of looking at the history of the album's subjects, this thesis will examine the history of these objects and how they reveal their compiler, Robert C. Kraut, an enlisted man in US Army Air Force. More will be discussed regarding Kraut's identity during the contextualization portion of this thesis. What does the construction and the material layout of these albums say about Kraut himself, and what do they say about the time they were made in? To begin to better understand the aim of Kraut's album's narrative, a brief examination into the histories of the photographic album is, while expansive, necessary to at least provide a general background. Just as understanding the uses and purposes of a single photograph requires a broader understanding of the medium's history, so too does the medium of the photographic album. 3

Evolution of the Photographic Album The earliest examples of albums were not photographic or even pictorial, instead they were script based. The earliest pictorial use found in albums can be traced back to Europe during the Renaissance4. Centuries later, during the early years of Daguerreian photography, the concept of the photographic albums was still not widely practiced. This is due to the precious and delicate nature of photographic objects at the time. However, as years passed, technology advanced and the advent of paper based photography created an explosion of photographs that could suddenly be easily and cheaply produced, disseminated and acquired. Because of photography's newfound collectability, owners needed means to both house and display their rapidly growing image collection. During this time, due to the relative ease with which paper base photographs such as cartes-de-visite could be produced and disseminated photography became a medium collected by the masses.5 Because of their collectability and the need for a method of storing growing photograph collections, the album form became the most sought after approach. 6 Essentially, the creation of the early family albums arose out of the demand for a photographic storage system7 The earliest commercially manufactured photographic albums were being produced by the 1850's. The construction of these albums and the methods used to house photographs was greatly influenced by the standardized physical characteristics of the widely popular cartes-de-

visite and cabinet cards. 8 The introduction of the albumen process in 1850, introduced a new wave of albums types because these images had to be mounted on card stock. Albumen prints required pages that were thick enough and strong enough to support them and keep them flat as seen in the Peterkin album, another photographic album of albumen prints currently being housed at the AGO [Fig 1]. The next major change in the evolution of the photographic album came with the introduction of the gelatin silver print process in late 19th century, Around the same time thanks to the introduction of George Eastman's Kodak camera in 1888, the act of taking a photograph became possible for amateurs. Albums also evolved with the changes in the photographic medium, and with that evolution came new and more varied album types9. This lead to albums becaming less anchored to one particular format or type of photography, such as the cartes-devisite, cabinet cards or even tintypes, allowing creators new opportunities to customize in their albums. This aspect of customization allowed not only for the album's compilers to position different types and sizes of images in various arrangements, but also allowed for other, nonphotographic material to find its way into albums, As a result, the popular art of scrapbooking and the photographic album began to merge.10 The origins of scrapbook can be traced back as early as 1775, when Englishman James Gargner published a biographical history of England. The book came with blank pages that both

Gargner and others encouraged owners of the books to collect various engravings that could be added in by the books' owners.11 With the already well established practice of scrapbooking, and introduction of non photographic material, the advent of the gelatin silver print process began to see the replacement of the cartes-de-visite, in albums, with that of the gelatin silver print and photomechanical reproductions like postcards.12 Thanks to the creation of mounting corners, no photograph, postcard or other similar material was too big or uniquely proportioned to include in ones narrative. Compilers now had a greater flexibility when it came to album customization thanks to the advances in picture making and an evolving scrapbooking market. Standardization in regards to what material could be housed in an album, was no longer an issue, and this allowed for multiple types of artifacts to be part of an album's narrative. With each new advancement came a new sense of freedom and creativity.

VERNACULAR PHOTOGRAPHY AND ALBUMS
The presence of vernacular photography within the museum setting has increased over the last 10 to 15 years due to growing attention about the significant role vernacular photography has played in the history of photography. For decades vernacular photography was seen as too commonplace and too diverse to be considered worth studying, much less exhibiting in an institutionalized setting. 13 Yet for years artists and professional photographers alike have drawn inspiration from this genre. Despite snapshots existing for over one hundred years, reluctance to explore, preserve or celebrate the genre has persisted. But with growing interest and investment in collecting vernacular photographs, a new area of the field is now being examined. Social practices relating to how images were taken, how subjects were framed and how individuals presented themselves in photographs are just some of the areas of research and exploration vernacular collections can and have yielded thus far. 14 Due to the growing interest to preserve, collect, study and exhibit this area of photography and social behavior, more and more institutions have been bringing in vernacular photographs into their collection. Yet in the fine art institutional setting, vernacular photographic albums tend to be exhibited as just a part of a larger narrative, rather than focusing on the album itself. Works chosen are also more often than not decided upon based either on aesthetic qualities or because of some unusual characteristic, be it structural or content related. Historical institutions tend to explore the information and image content rather than focusing on the object as a whole. In both instances, what is neglected as vital information worth exploring and showcasing, is the narrative of the album, the primary reason for its existence.

13

The hurdle that each institution faces in regards to the photographic album is determining how it should be displayed. Because the purpose of most albums is a narrative, how to display the work in a way that doesn't emphasize aesthetic or hallmark some unusual aspect of the albums is crucial. Instead, display methods should manage to exhibit how the albums were used, present their materiality, narrative and subjects depicted in the images. Such a task is difficult but vital, as every annotation, scratch, tear and even missing elements offer contextual information regarding the subjects in the album and the history of the album itself. In doing so, the importance and qualities of a vernacular collection will not be lost, but instead deepen and contribute to an institutions' overall collection. In regards to this thesis, the types of images Kraut presents in his three albums can in most cases be described as "snapshots": casual photographs made typically by an amateur with a small handheld camera.15 But defining a snapshot this way can inadvertently change the perception of the photographer. For one, this definition can project either hastiness in regards to the amount of time to take the picture, or possibly discredit the photographic professionalism of Kraut himself. To avoid the latter, more is needed to be known about Kraut, such as his duties while serving.

MAX DEAN AND THE ALBUMS The Kraut albums were part of a much larger donation by artist Max Dean, an artist who had no connection to Kraut or his family. As a result, what little contextual information about the albums came from interviewing Dean. Max Dean had collected the Kraut albums along with a variety of others created by a wide range of individuals in different times and places. Dean was born in Leeds, England, in 1949, and his family later immigrated to Canada. He received his B.A. in Art History in 1971 from the University of British Columbia. Since then, Dean has developed a vibrant and varied artistic practice and he continues to exhibit widely. 16 Over the course of many years, previous to his donation of albums to the AGO, Dean began to collect numerous vernacular and family photographic albums, as a result of a personal reaction he experienced after the creation of one of his earlier artistic installations. The albums that are the focus of this thesis were purchased at the Sunday Flea Market on West 26th Street in New York City in late 1990's. In regards to the albums which are the focus of this thesis, Dean was drawn to them because they were a set of three almost intact albums created by one individual. While there are a few images missing from the albums, the vast majority of the content remained in good condition. Dean also found the time and place of the album's narrative very unique.17 Unlike many photographic albums of family outings, these albums depicted a very important and very brief time in both Japanese and American history as witnessed and retold by a person who was actually there.

During Dean's album collection period, from 1992 to 2002, Max Dean amassed over 600 albums. The content, subject matter and date of this collection spanned nearly a 100-year period. While most of the albums in the collection are of North American origins, there are also several examples of foreign albums. The AGO could not take in the entire collection, due to the amount of space that was required, and the museum's mandate stipulates that all items possess justifiable historical relevance to the mission of the museum. However, an alternate solution was devised between Dean and the museum's photography curators Maia Sutnik and Sophie Hackett, whereby the AGO would acquire a selection of albums from Dean's collection and the remaining albums would serve as the basis for an interactive public art project. In the Spring of 2012, Dean and Hackett produced an interactive exchange exhibition of the albums titled Max Dean: Album which was featured at the annual Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival in Toronto, Canada, which ran through the month of May that year18. The origin of this project was an extension of Dean's previous interactive structures As Yet Untitled (1992 to 1995) [Fig. 2]. This interactive installation presented the viewer with the task of deciding whether or not an image, presented to them via a robotic arm, would be saved in a pile of other photographs or shredded right then and there while they watched. The machine would then resume destroying images regardless of whether a viewer was present or not. For this reason Dean was forced to search for photographic material to feed the installation. It was out of this need to have 4 x 6 inch photographs, that Dean began to collect photographic albums. After purchasing an album in Seattle, Dean returned to his hotel to begin his task of removing the images needed for his installation. However, as Dean examined the

photographs and flipped through the pages of the Seattle album, he couldn't bring himself to remove a single image. The power of the images and intimacy of the narratives from people he had never met, rendered him incapable of subjecting them to the destructive nature of his installation.This newfound love for the photographic album resulted in a ten year project that ended with Dean amassing a collection of over 600 family photographic albums. 19 The three albums that are part of this thesis were from the 237 albums the AGO selected to acquire for the museum's collection. The goal of the selection process was to insure that a diverse range of the albums Max Dean had collected was represented as a part of the AGO's collection. While most were of Canadian and American subject matter, the AGO made sure that other locations, peoples, cultures and languages were part of the selected collection. Dates of the albums fall anywhere between the 1900's to the late 20th century. Albums that were selected by the AGO had to clear a 3-part examination before being considered for acquisition. "Personality", nationality and condition were the three major factors that determined whether an album would be accessioned into the collection or not. Albums that required extraordinary conservation treatments were rejected. The album's "Personality" was based on the quality of the album's photographs, caption layout, and the types of places and events depicted in the albums. Of the albums selected, 97 were Canadian, with 57 albums from the United States, 31 from Germany and 15 from the UK. The remaining 37 albums were from various locations around the world such as the Middle East and Scandinavia. 20 The Kraut albums were selected for their uniqueness and the historical content they possessed. Not only were they of an American armed service member's time abroad, but it was the when and where factor that attracted the eyes of the curatorial staff at the AGO. Unlike the

majority of the albums that Dean had amassed, these particular albums were not of a family or a vacation per se. Instead, these albums provide a glimpse into the world of Japan, just after World War Two during the US occupation, a pivotal moment in history of both countries. While the albums are part of a unified narrative of the journey of US Army Air Force personnel Robert C. Kraut (1925 - 1997) [Fig. 3] and they appear similar from the outside, the method of display and personality of each album varies from one to the next.

ROBERT C. KRAUT ALBUMS Each of the albums that are part of this thesis measures 30cm in width, 35cm in height and roughly 4cm in thickness, which varies between each album incrementally due to the different amounts and types of material mounted inside. [Fig. 4] All three albums are of the same maker, The House Co, Inc. Boston. Each album utilizes one of the more typical stubbing methods to hold their pages together, and each page is kept in place using a loose-leaf, side sewn pattern.21 At one point, the albums were held together via a length of cord that was fed through holes that were drilled through each of the page's edges and covers, closest to the spine. The cord would pass through all the album's pages and each covers thus binding the album together. However this particular style of binding meant the spine of the albums was exposed, leaving the pages edges visible. Due to the age of the albums, the binding cord was no longer intact leaving the albums entirely loose leaf. [Fig. 5] This will be discussed further in the care and handling portion of this thesis. Each album's exterior covers are black. On each album's front cover is printed the words "Scrap Book" in gold ink at the top left corner. Album I is the first and only album with an indicated title page [Fig. 6], which includes an a photograph of Robert C. Kraut and bears the title of the body of work PICTORIAL REVIEW FROM APRIL 1945 - AUG 1946 OF SO. PACIFIC ISLANDS, PHILIPPINES, OKINAWA AND JAPAN. Album I consists of 98 pages with 274 silver gelatin prints, 1 post card and a small paper menu. The first half of album documents US Army Air Force personnel Robert C. Kraut's aerial travels that start in Oahu, Hawaii. From there Kraut's narrative continues south to Palmyra Atoll. Heading west, Kraut lands on both Canton Island and Tarawa. From there Kraut crosses over

into Oceania, where he surveys Los Negros Island, Papua New Guinea. From Papua New Guinea Kraut lands on the Indonesian island of Biak. From there he heads north to the Philippines, with a survey of Manila, the nations capital located in the Luzon province. After the Philippines, Kraut heads north to Okinawa ( ) and then on to Nagoya () Japan, located in the Chbu region () of the country's largest and main island Honshu (  ). The remaining two albums continue to survey Japan, and documents locations in me (  ), Osaka (  ) and Kyoto (  ). The album, at first, is filled with photographs of various army bases and aerial surveys, each accompanied by hand written annotations from Kraut indicating specifics about each location [Fig 7]. The language in these annotations is straightforward, but seems to lack a sense of personality one might associate with a family album. The majority of the photograph dimensions in the first half of the album are uniform, all roughly staying within a 16cm x 21cm layout [Fig. 8]. The regimented layout and standardization in image size at first gives the impression that the album could have been created and used for more official military purposes. Up until midway through Album I, all the material remained primarily gelatin silver prints, with the exception of a few pieces of adhered paper with inscribed annotations describing the contents of the photographs. This changes when Kraut finally reaches Showa Army Air base in Japan, December of 1945. It is from this point that not only does the incorporation of the nonphotographic material greatly increase, but the subject matter and annotation becomes less drenched in military jargon and begins to highlight more daily matters of both military and native Japanese life. Quickly the album takes on a familiar presentation to that of the more widely perceived concept of a photographic album. Images of smiling faces, social events and posed group shots at

20

various locations of importance begin to fill the pages of Kraut's album [Fig 9a, b, and c]. The remainder of the album chronicles Kraut's trip though rural and mountainous parts of Japan, accompanied at times by one other companion or by a small group of US military personnel. Album II continues Robert C. Kraut's journey through Japan, starting in January of 1946 [Fig. 10]. Album II has only 90 pages which most likely is a result of that album's condition which in fact was the worst of the three when Dean purchased them. Album II was not as well preserved as the other albums and unlike albums I and III, the binding cord was already severed. For this reason the album was no longer being held together. This could very well be the reason Album II possesses fewer pages then the other two, as pages may have fallen out. In addition to this possibility, Dean suspects, Album II could have been more heavily plundered as it may have contained a larger number of sought after photographs or ephemera. The contents of album II includes an increase in the amount of non-photographic material with the introduction of items such as travel pamphlets, maps, and postcards. The vast majority of the second album remains photographic, however the number is far less then either album I or III, with only 64 gelatin silver prints. It is in album II that the introduction of chromogenic photographs appear, 19 in total, all of which depict landscape views [Fig. 11]. The remainder of the album includes 7 pamphlets, 3 menu sheets, 2 maps, 28 postcards, and 1 newspaper clipping. Unlike the first album, the album II starts off with neither a title page nor does it focus on any military activity. Instead, the opening narrative and set of images highlights a hunting expedition and the hotel Kraut where was staying. A great deal of the second album focuses on Mount Fujiyama in the Chbu region of Honshu. Multiple pictures by Kraut's depict the mountain from all angles, including several from above, taken from an aircraft during a flyover. It is here a slower approach to Kraut's picture taking occurs, as attention to composition is more

21

evident. Kraut's images of Mount Fujiyama and its surroundings appear to be more thought out, as attention to foreground elements help highlight the mountain, such as its reflection from a nearby lake. Kraut also frames the mountain through the use of branches from nearby trees. [Fig.12] The rest of the album continues Robert C. Kraut's journey throughout Honshu. After Mount Fuji, Kraut travels east to Kanagawa Prefecture () cities of Kamakura (), Chigasaki( ), and Enoshima (). From there, Kraut head south west to Hakone () and Atami (). Kraut Then travels even further southwest when he visits one of the Three Great Gardens of Japan Kraku-en () in Okayama (). From there other historical sites in Kya-san () Nagoya (), and lastly Toyokawa () Through the album's narrative, in addition to photographs of the location Kraut visits, he also includes postcards and travel pamphlets in the album. Not only does Kraut collect and display these postcards and pamphlets, he also makes an effort of photographing and presenting his own images of the exact same landmarks, in some cases from the same or similar angle depicted in the postcards and pamphlets. [Fig. 13] Album III consists of 162 gelatin prints, 7 pamphlets, 2 menu sheets, 1 letter, 8 banknotes, 1 negative, 25 postcards, 4 newspaper clippings, and 2 packs of mounting corners. [Fig.14] Album III sees the largest collection of non-photographic material. The album also takes on a much more tourist like quality, serving a more memorial or souvenir function, rather than reflecting Kraut's daily life in the military. The album's subject matter remains in the Kant region with a great deal of emphasis on sights in Tokyo (  ) and Nikk (  ), which is located 140k north of Tokyo.

22

The album begins with street scenes of Tokyo, images of the Imperial Palace, as well as a few aerial photographs of bombarded cityscapes. As the album continues, the mood changes to that of a more tourist type expedition. Much like the second half of the first album, smiling faces, group shots and candid images fill the pages of the third album. [Fig.15] Kraut continues his Japanese adventure collecting tourist packets, postcards, and taking images of the places he visited. In addition to the collection of tourist material such as postcards and pamphlets Kraut also incorporates other material such as Japanese banknotes as well [Fig.16]. The third album is however the most incomplete as 31 of the last 32 pages are blank. Neither Kraut's pen nor any of his images grace the final pages of the album. Contextualizing Kraut Albums By the time of Robert C. Kraut's albums, (1945 - 1946) silver gelatin printing was the primary process of developing photographs. Also by this time, many other photomechanical processes existed and were being utilized such as letterpress and offset lithography. The ability to add non-photographic elements, such as postcards and other material produced photomechanically, to one's "photographic" album can be seen as not just simply a decorative musing by the compiler, but as validation or confirmation of ones narrative or presence in the narrative.22 Postcards provide a framed approach to the subject, usually glamorous or idealized.
23

This can however, in some ways rob the depicted location or object from it's natural everyday

scale or genuine appearance. Kraut's images of the landmarks, both man made and natural, establish not only his presence at the location, but also the accuracy of that object or location in contrast to what was presented in the postcard image. The exact reason as to why Kraut chose to

take a photograph and display a postcard, remains with him, however their presence in the albums among one another provide that, for the sake of Kraut's narrative, he felt both were necessary. Perhaps the postcards simply serve as additional proof of Kraut's presence at the locations depicted . In regards to Kraut's precise military involvement, all that is known at this time is that he served in the 5th Air Force unit. While this is not directly stated in any written text within the albums themselves, in several of the images of Kraut, a US 5th Air Force patch can be seen on the left shoulder of his uniform [Fig. 17]. Unlike most forces, the 5th Air Force was never based within the United States. The 5th also remained in Japan as part of the occupation effort after the war.24 The lack of an official or constant means of visually representing rank within the USAAF during World War Two also adds to the lack of available indicators that could help identify more about Kraut's role during his service and time in Japan. A constant and regulated means of visually indicating rank wasn't fully established, until the USAAF officially became the United States Air Force in 1948; it's own independent branch of the US Armed Forces in 1948.25
26

Due to the lack of information available regarding Kraut's role during his service, it is at this point too difficult to indicate whether the images in the albums are simply personal photographs of a military photographer, or the personal images of a solider who happened to have a camera with him. Personnel records containing information regarding Robert C. Kraut's

service as part of the US Army Air Force could not be located by the staff at the National Personnel Records Archives Center in St. Louis, Missouri. It is important to note that parts of the center was damaged by a fire on June 12, 1973. The fire resulted in both loss and damage to many army and air force records. This may explain why Kraut's files were not found. It is known however that Kraut did at least hold some of his images in higher regard, and that they all weren't considered or viewed as mere snapshots. Halfway through the album II, two loose images reveal an attempt made by Kraut to submit his work to the 1948 Popular Photography Contest [Fig. 18]. The photographs (AGO.102938.33a and AGO.102938.33b) are both of scenes from Kraut's time in Japan. On the verso of these prints are adhered forms, where Kraut listed information regarding the location where the images were taken, type of film used, film speed and camera [Fig 19]. It is important to understand that this is where Robert C. Kraut's name first appears. In all the preceding annotations and the whole first album, all images containing Kraut were simply labeled using pro-form language and words, such as "me" or "myself". Without these two images, very little would have been known about the compiler, which in and of itself says something very important about the albums. The fact that Kraut didn't list his name in either his annotations or the title of the albums, says that these albums were more than likely meant to be viewed by those who knew him, and therefore did not need an official introduction. This could also mean these albums were more than likely not used for any military purpose. Despite the regimented layout and military jargon at the beginning of the first album, it would seem highly unlikely that a service member would provide a set of photographic albums and not indicate his name, rank or even division within the

25

armed forces. For this reason, it seems more likely that these albums were compiled for personal and or family use. Not only is it believed that these albums served as a means for remembering one's time in a foreign place, but also to serve as a piece of that place. For a solider, the images they take can serve as souvenirs of their time at a certain location and the memories that destination holds. 27 Much like the early photographic family albums, these albums by Kraut resulted from being there and through a necessity to store a growing collection of objects that represented his fond memories. However, unlike a photograph, which is simply the visual validation of ones presence at a certain location, Kraut also collected objects (i.e. ticket stubs, menus, pamphlets, etc.) from the places he visited which are also included the album. While a photograph may be the most visually accurate depiction of a location, it may not contain the same level of authenticity or tactile tangibility of being from a foreign destination that an object from that physical location has. For this reason, the addition of non-photographic material could have been collected by Kraut for design reasons, in order to incorporate colour in the narrative, but also add an additional sense of tangibility, or at least more objects from which to conjure up and/or associate memories.

METHODOLOGY
Approach to Cataloguing One of the main reasons this project was taken on was out of the necessity to have these albums cataloged and properly entered into the AGO's database, which uses The Museum System (TMS) computer software. Cataloguing not only helps place the object in the museum but also helps highlights the many different aspects, subjects, and characteristics the object has to offer to both museum staff and researchers. Cataloguing should be more than simple data entry and should contain an element of research and critical thought in regards to what is both present in the album, as well as what is not. Through the power of electronic cataloguing systems such as TMS, providing the object's titles, mediums, subject matter, creators, and any other descriptive detail aid to the items overall discoverability in the collection.. Cataloguing methods regarding albums must implement a degree of attention to the object's narrative as a whole, and not merely rely on the annotated description provided by the compiler. What isn't stated or said by the compiler of an album is just as important as what is present in the albums.28 Because of the necessity for continuity, standards and templates are used to insure that similar works or media are cataloged in the same manner. These standards and templates must be followed rigorously in order to make the retrieval and the return of the objects, easier29 For this reason, before the cataloguing efforts of this thesis began, an examination of how previous albums had been cataloged at the Art Gallery of Ontario was implemented. For this, a comparison of the work done by former Ryerson University graduate Melodie Hueber, and the Art Gallery of Ontario's Collection Manager, Liana Radvak was examined.

Peterkin Family Album Catalogue Analysis

While the methods for cataloguing the Peterkin Family Album by Melodie Hueber, was ideal for this particular album, they did not translate well into an approach I could use for with Kraut Albums. For this reason, an adaptation of Hueber and Radvak's method was implemented. An adaptation that was different enough to suit the need of the Kraut albums, but also one that kept the records within a reasonable degree of continuity with the AGO's template for cataloguing albums, be they photographic or non-photographic. The main reasons for a varied and adapted approach to cataloguing the Kraut albums, was due to their condition, the presentation of the albums content, and their materiality. When I compared the two albums it was evident the Peterkin album was much older than the Kraut albums, dating back to the late 19th century. This meant the types of photographs in the album as well as the album format itself were very different from another. While the main photographic material in the Kraut albums is gelatin silver prints, the Peterkin album is created with mounted albumen prints. Therefore the method of presenting them in an album meant that the pages had extra mass making the Peterkin album much thicker than the Kraut's albums. The mounted images in the Peterkin album are held in place, not by adhesion or mounting corners but instead via mounting slots that enabled the complier to slide the mounted photograph into an open slip in the page itself. Once slid in, a precut frame on the page would hold the image in place concealing the mount the image was printed on and revealing the image and the subject it was depicting. Such albums were widely utilized during the mid to late 19th century, due to the popularity and dissemination of the carte-de-visite.30 Due to the almost complete standardization of the mounted

photograph medium, albums like this have designated slots for their compiler's images, each measured to fit the average cabinet card or carte-de-visite. Unlike the Kraut album, whose pages were produced blank allowing Kraut to position the images anywhere on the page, the Peterkin album could not offer such customization. For this reason the manner in which each of these two albums was cataloged, differed to a degree. Because the Peterkin album only possessed a maximum of 4 photographs per page, and that each image was either located in the top left, top right, bottom left or bottom right, a straightforward approach to identifying each image's location on the page was represented in the albums TMS records [Fig. 20]. In order to help differentiate each photograph in the museum's database an alphabetic/numeric system was created. Images mounted on the top left of the page were indicated with the addition of the letter "a" at the end of their accession number. Images located at the top right were indicated with the addition of the letter "b", bottom left was indicated by the letter "c" and images that were mounted at the bottom right were indicated by the letter "d". 31

Cataloguing Methodology While the format of the Kraut photographs and their layout on each page, along with other material, was not the same as the Peterkin album, the same method for identifying each item was used. Similarly to the Peterkin album, objects in the Kraut albums, be they photographic or not, are identified by the addition of an alphabetic integer to the object record's number. The object number reflects the page number in the album. For example, the record for the Album I is (AGO.102937). Page 1 of album 1 is title (AGO.102937.1) The addition of the

period and number 1 indicates that the record refers to page 1. The record for the first photograph found on the first page of the first album is then titled as (AGO.102937.1a). Every adhered or present image is identified alphabetically beginning from top left with `a' and proceeding across the page, from left to right and top to bottom 32 Through the cataloguing process of the album, each record, be it page or image, was given Creator, Title, Date, Marks, Inscription, Medium and a Dimension fields to be filled out.

Creators: Unless indicated through written annotation or unless identified on the object itself, most of the Creator fields were credited to Robert C. Kraut. However, in the case of postcards or pamphlets, provided printer or publishing companies were listed as the objects creator.

Date: Unless specified through annotation, or other means of identification, objects were marked as being created between the years of 1945 to 1946, the years of the photographic survey indicated by Robert C. Kraut on the title page of Album I.

Marks: Any non-textual markings, such as pen strokes or stamps, were indicated as Marks. Their general shape and location were then noted and entered in the field.

Inscriptions: Any handwritten or typed text was transcribed and entered into the field, along with its location on the page or object.

30

Medium: Identified the type of material or process used to create the object. In the case of page level records, this field indicates the types of material or process that are represented on each page, not the material or process of the page itself. If items appear to have been removed from the page prior to albums donation or if the page is blank it is noted in this field in the page level record. Dimension: Height and width of each album, page, and object were first measured in centimeters then converted into inches. In some instances, some images were found folded in half (panoramas), as they exceeded the album's width. In these cases their measurements reflect the object at its full length.

31

STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND HANDLING CONCERNS Before any cataloguing could begin, the condition of the albums demanded attention and action to be taken in order to eliminate continued structural degradation. All three of the album's cords meant to bound the pages and covers together had come apart and had begun to unravel. Because of this, it was unsafe to open and close the albums without incurring physical damage to the pages, which were and still are brittle. With assistance and advice from AGO conservator Katharine Whitman, it was concluded that in order to any future damage, and to make viewing the objects easier, the cords had to be removed. Loose material, such as paper-based photographs or other non-photographic material was cataloged and kept in its original location within the album so as not to alter the album's overall narrative. The loose material was then encapsulated with archival tissue to reduce physical damage that might occur as a result of it rubbing against other material in the album [Fig. 21] [Fig. 22]. In order to maintain the album's original narrative, and due to the nature of the materiality of the Kraut album's photographs, the images and all other material in the albums remain in their original place, rather than being removed and housed separately. This is because un-mounted photographs, the majority of the photographic material in the Kraut albums, are at greater risk of physical damage, than mounted photographs, similar to the cartes-de-visite in the Peterkin album that were removed and rehoused. 33 34 Because these loose Kraut images are not as well protected by the support of a mount board/album page, there is a greater chance of these photographs being torn or creased if removed.

Albums themselves were not specifically created with preservation in mind; therefore any action related to removing objects or even handling old albums must be considered carefully. 35 Not only would one run the risk of increasing the physical damage if the images were to be removed, but the uniqueness of the object as a whole could be lost. For this reason, both the album itself and the items it houses should together be considered as unique artifact, rather than separate entities. 36 Therefore it was decided upon that the Kraut albums and the material inside would remain as they were when they were donated, with the obvious exception of the binding cord, which, as mentioned, had to be removed, lest the albums incur any more damage.

CONCLUSION The two-pronged objective of this thesis was to catalog three photographic albums as well as piece together a context through the examination their layout, structure, and the types of objects used throughout. As this thesis has shown, the examination of the material layout in albums offers not only information in regards to the narrative, but also the method by which one is to catalog and record the album's information. Cataloguing an album should appreciate both the narrative of an album and it's materiality. Uniqueness is an inherent quality of the album, and therefore each should be examined and cataloged according to their individual character. Though much can be explained about the evolution of the album style from one generation to the next, and while the contents of images may offer rich historical events to further explore, photographic albums and scrapbooks alone do not possess all the necessary contextual clues needed to express the fullness of their narrative. Their mysteries remain and to some degree this is what makes photographic albums so interesting as artifacts.. Due to Kraut's passing in 1997, we will never have the benefit of looking at the albums with him. His accompanying narration to his body of work will never be heard, nor will the answers to questions surrounding the albums' layout or why he wanted to create the albums in the first place, ever be revealed. For instance, despite the title on the first page of the first album - a pictorial review Kraut chose a scrapbook, rather than something designated as a photographic album. This may say something about these albums and how Kraut himself viewed the body of work. It is impossible to know whether the decision to house this narrative in a scrapbook rather than a photographic album, was intentional or not.

34

Though the histories of the various media found in albums, their formats and their basic function as a social practice can be explained to a degree and the contents of their pages can be explored. The entirety of the intellectual narrative that led the compiler to include, exclude and arrange the works the way they did may however never truly be understood. However, this shouldn't be viewed as a negative characteristic or a failure of information gathering, but rather simply as an inherent quality of each and every album. What can be determined by examining and contextualizing albums, is the uniqueness of the object and its creator. Rather then blanket all albums and scrapbooks with the generalization that they are simply vernacular musings of the common person, they should be cherished as individual collections of both expression and documentation. Each not only provides it's own style but also an individual's view of the world around them. They are a study in human creativity, communication, perception and response to the world and those around them. However, these distinctive qualities present numerous challenges for the staff of collecting institutions. Through the course of this thesis, previously established and initiated practices of cataloguing other like objects at the Art Gallery of Ontario was examined and then altered to meet both the needs for the museum database in order to maintain continuity as well as provide the most accurate and complete information regarding the object itself. In the case of the Kraut albums, they went from being simply labeled as albums compiled by an unknown American, to having their own narrative documented and their compiler indicated. With the ability to electronically catalogue the albums at the record, page and item levels in TMS, the albums will now be more effective as searchable objects within the collection and researchers along with staff will have easier access to information about the album and the materials in them. This access to the electronic records also gives the albums a longer life

expectancy. No longer will archivists or researchers have to open and turn the pages of each album to discover what is in them. If there is any aspect of a particular area of inquiry they desire to observe regarding any of the album's, the exact page and album can be identified via the museum's TMS catalog. This will save both the researchers time and will protect the albums from unnecessary overuse and will preserve Robert Kraut's humble and fascinating legacy.
