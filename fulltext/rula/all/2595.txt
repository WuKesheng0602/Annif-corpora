Abstract

The Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs consists of 4820 photographs taken by photographer Arnold Newman between the years 1938 and 2004. This thesis acts as a research project investigating the collection and making it accessible to researchers and collections management at the Art Gallery of Ontario. The project includes research on the sitting subjects, an overview of the physical photographs, an annotated bibliography and the organization and housing of the collection for permanent accession into the Art Gallery of Ontario's photography collection. The paper consists of an analytical portion which outlines the methodology of creating the finding aid. The finding aid acts as a standalone paper designed to assist researchers navigating the collection.

Part I: Analytical Paper Introduction While there are many different types of finding aids that have been created by various institutions, each has tailored these aids to suit their individual collections and mandates. For the purposes of this thesis project, a finding aid will be defined as "a descriptive document created to allow retrieval. Types of finding aids include file lists, inventories and guides." 1 As such, this paper's goal is to outline an investigation into the series of decisions made during the development of the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs Finding Aid at the Art Gallery of Ontario. In doing so I plan to establish, expand upon and clarify the decisions I made throughout the development of this project. The Newman Collection was acquired by the Art Gallery of Ontario, in Toronto, Canada, in the summer of 2012. Donated anonymously, the collection contained 4820 of Arnold Newman's photographs created between 1938 and 2004. The collection was composed of a main body of work which included portraits, a Bravo Stravinsky book dummy, photographs for a book on Carl Sandburg which never came to fruition, a group of prints documenting Newman's exhibitions and a group of photographs which are inscribed by the documented sitting subjects.2 The Newman Collection represents a large-scale body of work produced by a seminal American portrait photographer who captured historically prominent figures from the 20 th century. Therefore, this is an important collection for the Art Gallery of Ontario and was the basis of my graduate research project. I was introduced to the collection in the summer of 2012 by Art Gallery of Ontario curator Maia Sutnik during the course of an internship where I completed a preliminary catalogue of the majority of

the photographic objects in the Newman Collection. During this time it became apparent that the collection would benefit from additional research and more thorough organization. I proposed that I continue working on the collection by creating a finding aid, making the collection more accessible by providing research on Newman and the portrait subjects found within the collection. The collection arrived in disarray, housed in a variety of boxes with the majority of the prints stacked in banker's boxes. The Newman Collection is interesting when compared to other archival collections of comparable sizes in that it does not contain much diversity in terms of materials and/or the sizes of the photographs. The collection is entirely composed of photographic objects, which are largely black and white gelatin silver prints on "standard" sized paper. 3 These are work, reference and exhibitions prints. There are no negatives or handwritten letters, and there are no drawings or technological objects. The furthest deviation from this standard is a book dummy, which is largely composed of silver gelatin black and white photographs with an accompanying draft of written content. As a result, dividing the collection by material or providing brief descriptions of the material objects would not effectively assist a researcher approaching the collection for the first time due to the fact that this information becomes increasingly redundant. 4 The homogeneity of this collection ultimately affected how this finding aid was constructed. The remainder of this essay will elaborate on the research conducted and the steps I took in creating the Newman Collection Finding Aid. To begin the construction of this finding aid, one needs to imagine how the collection would be used in the future. How would a researcher interact with this material? Considering Newman's history as an internationally renowned portrait photographer, it is safe

Standard sized photographic paper tend to be 5" X 7", 8" X 10", 11" X 14", 16" X 20" and 20" X 24". For example, if a researcher was to use a TMS excel spreadsheet to organize the information by media type, approximately 12 entries would show up as chromogenic prints, followed by over 4,700 entries labelled as silver gelatin prints that are either mounted or un-mounted.

to assume that just as many, if not more, researchers would be interested in the subjects of the images as they would be interested in the photographs themselves as expressive objects. In fact, researchers are more likely to be using the collection as a resource for photographs of influential 20th century personalities. This being said, this paper will also cover the photographic objects, what problems were encountered regarding organization and time constraints. Further, this finding aid may be of service to those who wish to navigate the collection without having to search through the thousands of associated records within The Museum System (TMS) database; the current collections information system of the Art Gallery of Ontario. The paper will end by detailing currently unresolved issues that may be explored by future managers of the Newman Collection.

Background Research & Literature Survey As stated in my introduction, there are very few sources on best practice when constructing a finding aid. This may be attributed to the wide variety of institutions and mandates governing the innumerable collections that exist in the international archival and collections world. The guides that do exist tend to be either too vague for the purposes of this project, or defined for a collection that includes a broader range of archival materials. It might also be suggested that standards for finding aids are difficult to determine because institutions often customise these tools to suit their specific collections and practices. In conducting a literature review on the subject of creating finding aids, I searched through online collections of finding aids, most notably the Library of Congress and other finding aids constructed by international collections managers and theses written by past students of the Ryerson Photographic Preservation and Collections Management program at both the Art Gallery of Ontario and George Eastman House. Considering the range of finding aid construction guides created by different institutions, this literature survey will not attempt to cover all of these sources, but instead give some examples that have affected the decisions made in completing this project. The Library of Congress has a significant collection of finding aids, all of which follow electronic archival description (EAD) methodologies.5 These sets of standards were helpful in constructing this finding aid, in that it highlighted a number of elements that should be included, such as scope and content, effective dates, biographical sketches, and arrangement. This being said, the methodology is designed to create a standardized format of finding aid creation for the institution, as

there are numerous searchable finding aids online. There are certain code properties that have been established to ensure content can easily be transferred online. Furthermore, the database appears to have been developed to suit the purposes of creating a general collection summary as opposed to an object by object finding aid. This is understandable considering that the collection of objects within the Library of Congress varies significantly by type. An additional source for finding aid construction that was useful in creating the Arnold Newman Collection Finding Aid was the construction guidelines used by the Benson Ford Research Centre. 6 While the collections held at this institution are historical in nature, the construction guidelines outline an effective way to organize the content in a finding aid. However, much of the information is not applicable to this project, as they use very different cataloguing procedures for documenting their objects. The Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania created a finding aid that is very similar to the ones described above, 7 and this construction guide also influenced some minor aspects of my finding aid. Lisa C. Henessey, a former student of the PPCM program, assembled a thorough finding aid for a collection of photographs held at George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. 8 Using her finding aid as a basic model, I decided to include additional areas of research into the finding aid I otherwise would not have. For example, Hennessey's choice to include an independent analytical paper outlining the creation of the finding aid directly inspired the format of my research project. However, there are categorical differences between our two collections that prevented me from using her model as a

complete foundation. Hennessey was working with a smaller number of photographs, allowing her to go into greater detail with her cataloguing. Further, the photographs Hennessey studied have a unifying subject matter, World War II, which provided her with different research opportunities. Hennessey was able to undertake research on the singular subject matter alongside the creation of detailed catalogue entries. Working with approximately five times the number of photographs in the Newman Collection precluded detailed catalogue entries. Further, the range of subjects and unfamiliarity with the subject matter of each individual print limited my research to identification and index creation­the essential tasks of my project. Finally, the last source of information that affected the development of the Arnold Newman Collection Finding Aid was Arnold Newman's Sitting Book. 9 Using simple tables, the artist wrote down basic information regarding certain sitters, such as when he took specific photographs and the names of his clients. Creating a complimentary finding aid with the sitting book would increase the finding aid's interoperability with collections of Newman's work at other institutions. The finding aid includes an annotated bibliography which helped inform the finding aid's shape and construction. Newman's numerous photographic publications have many organizational qualities that remain consistent throughout the various books. A sitting subject index is almost always included; this is especially true of those publications which focus on Newman's photographs exclusively. Including a similar index would assist researchers in finding particular prints that may be found within the Newman Collection. Some of the more prominent publications that scholars should investigate when researching Newman include: Arnold Newman: Five Decades, One Mind's Eye: The Portraits and Other Photographs of Arnold Newman, Bravo Stravinsky, Arnold Newman in Florida, Interviews with

Master Photographers and the Eastman Kodak video publication Techniques of the Masters. All of these sources have been expanded upon in the annotated bibliography section of the finding aid. There are a wide variety of subjects and publications that inspired the format of this finding aid. Based on the information and literature that would be applicable to the construction of the Newman Finding Aid, I selected individual elements that would be useful in navigating the Newman Collection of 4820 photographs. These elements include biographies on important figures, an overview of the various markings that can be found on the Newman photographs, an overview of some of Newman's portraits, an index containing approximately 1,300 captured subjects and an annotated bibliography covering Newman's published works and interviews.

Creating the Finding Aid At the inception of this project I approached the Art Gallery of Ontario's curator Maia Sutnik and the gallery's collection management staff and proposed the creation of a finding aid for the Newman Collection. I felt this was an ideal Master's thesis project as I spent the summer of 2012 cataloguing the photographs contained within the collection. Achieving this goal would require a substantial amount of research on finding aid construction, investigating associated catalogue records and the sitting subjects within the collection, in addition to research on Newman himself. My initial research on Newman was broad, based on his photographic career and his iconic portrait sessions. Including the large publications on Newman alongside smaller interviews within the annotated bibliography would help give researchers context to his published material. To begin, many finding aid construction guides and archival researchers note the increasing number of systems and databases being used by archival institutions. 10 The catalogue of accession entries is perhaps the most well known and most used system of abstracting object information into a searchable database. As such, understanding the cataloguing program used by the Art Gallery of Ontario and how it functions within the institution are factors that were fundamental to the construction of this finding aid. The Art Gallery of Ontario uses TMS as their cataloguing program of choice, which operates according to a series of tables that allow for input of information in any number of formats. These individual records can be printed off and viewed, or a large number can be consolidated into excel spreadsheets. However, these tables present researchers with a large amount of data that could be difficult to navigate. Having had to sort through and interpret similar spreadsheets in the creation of this finding aid, I became familiar with this complex system throughout the development of this project.

TMS is not a user-friendly search engine, as it requires accurate description for record retrieval.11 The program is constantly being revised, requiring continuing education for collections managers. If an untrained researcher were allowed to freely navigate this program they would most likely have trouble finding the information or the photograph they needed. What is even more troublesome is that they might accidentally destroy important information in the catalogue. Finally, TMS is a proprietary program relying on the continued existence of its developing company.12 Creating an effective research alternative not only increases efficiency for researchers, but will also provide a searchable alternative for those unfamiliar with the TMS database system. Knowing this, my finding aid is to be accessible for navigation and a reliable source of information and as such it will need to be organized in a different way from the Art Gallery of Ontario's TMS database. I did not want the Newman Finding Aid to be completely independent from TMS; if the program were ever to become obsolete, a finding aid would be the only alternative to accessing the collection. Saying this, I readily acknowledge that the chances of TMS crashing or losing all the information contained within are quite minimal. Interoperability with information from TMS will improve the finding aid and will ensure that the aid provides a reliable alternative for the future. If this is to be achieved, the finding aid must have complete coverage of the collection in one form or another. To do this, I have broken down the collection by subject (sitter, place, subject matter) and have then listed the location, negative date and number of photographs for each sitter. By doing this alphabetically, one can easily navigate the collection and find the required information in an effective and intuitive manner. This

Searching for particular prints in TMS requires that one is aware of particular print qualities beforehand. For the Newman prints, this can be problematic when you consider the physical homogeneity of the collection. Knowing that there is an 8"X10" print of an American politician in the collection will do little good during a search unless you know additional specific details. 12 The Museum System is a product produced by Gallery Systems, a company based out of New York City, New York, The United States of America.

decision was also influenced by publications containing Arnold Newman photographs which often include a similar index. 13 Covering the collection and creating a finding aid has a greater impact than simply providing researchers with a navigation tool. There will likely be a wide variety of researchers accessing this finding aid with differing intentions, and therefore there needs to be a variety of approaches in establishing coverage of the collection. As such, the finding aid was designed using a top-down approach to ensure the success of interested researchers. This has been achieved by providing an overview of the entire collection,14 each sub-collection and each box.15 Furthermore, by using a largescale index, I have provided an overview of the portrait subjects that can be found, down to the number of associated objects. 16 In accordance with best practices at the AGO, a box summary has been included with each box that gives a breakdown of the objects contained within. The Newman Collection will be accompanied by a compact disc that will include excel spreadsheets of all box summaries alongside digital file formats of the finding aid. Creating a finding aid that can be easily edited or changed by collections managers and skilled users is a very important aspect of this project. As there are no pre-written guidelines created by the Art Gallery of Ontario in establishing a finding aid for a project of this size, I took initiative in working with already established aspects of their cataloguing system. By doing so I have created a finding aid that could be used to further benefit cataloguers who wish to work on the collection in the future, as it is evident that there will be additional work that can be pursued with this collection in TMS. I have also used basic programs such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel to ensure that future users can edit the

finding aid to better suit their needs. For example, the TMS catalogue records for the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs contain all of the titles of the sitting subjects; however, records for these approximately 1300 constituents have not yet been created. By using my finding aid, cataloguers can create basic constituent records for the sitting subjects without having to do additional research to identify the sitter. Changing technology within archival institutions is inevitable, as is technological obsolescence. Communicating simple information as efficiently as possible would ensure that the information could be edited and adapted in the future. This is especially true for the index I have designed. I accomplished this by breaking up my finding aid into a number of highly compatible file formats and have kept all of this information within the collection itself in archival CD format and a USB thumb drive, alongside a printed hard copy. 17 The included instructions on how to edit and use this information will assist future users in editing and modifying the finding aid to suit their own needs. Finally, one of the more important aspects of creating a finding aid is the amount of time an institution can dedicate to its creation. For many institutions, dedicating the time necessary to create an object-by-object finding aid is not possible. This is especially true when dealing with approximately 5000 objects. In many situations, a catalogue record can act as an alternative to the finding aid for those who regularly access the collection. As discussed earlier, this is not an effective solution for encouraging researchers to investigate the collection, and does not translate well to those unfamiliar with TMS vocabulary.

17

The CD-Rom that accompanies this finding aid will have all the source material in their primary formats (.doc and .xlxs) and will also be in an open source format. (.pdf) This has been done to help future proof the digital copies from becoming obsolete.

13

An additional source of information that I felt was necessary to include was an annotated bibliography. Newman was a significant post-war American photographer who was widely collected and exhibited by major fine art museums. As such, he had to opportunity to publish a number of monographs of his work and he was included in many anthologies about photography and portraiture. Annotating the major publications associated with Arnold Newman and including an overview of his interviews will inform researchers of the many publications associated with Arnold Newman and his photographs. One of the goals of this project, was to dedicate a significant amount of time to creating a finding aid, while diverting minimal resources from the AGO. This is one of the major reasons I felt creating a finding aid would be a useful and necessary project, as it could be largely completed offsite with minimal supervision. This being said, there are a number of steps that will need to be taken in the future to ensure the preservation of this collection. Due to the size of the collection and limited resources, there were some preservation and collections management practices that could not be fulfilled. These steps include applying accession numbers to the prints, fully expanding each catalogue entry, expanding the lots for the Carl Sandburg, Bravo Stravinsky and Exhibition Prints, and ensuring each object has been housed in archival mylar sleeves. I have expanded upon and provided possible solutions to these shortcomings in the conclusion section of the finding aid.

14

The Photographs The photographs in the Newman Collection are fairly uniform in terms of their physical characteristics. There are a small number of chromogenic colour prints; however, the majority of the prints are black and white silver gelatin, both toned and un-toned, and can be found loose, mounted on board, masonite or matted. The prints are generally found in good condition, a few are yellowing with age and some have visible fingerprints. However, researchers will more than likely be investigating this collection for the content of the photographs rather than the physical characteristics of the prints. This being said, another area for potential interest and research beyond the subjective interpretation of the photographs are the markings located on both the recto and verso of the photographs. These marks and inscriptions have all been successfully documented and transferred into the TMS database; however, this information is abstract and without any context may be difficult to understand. A section in the finding aid has been dedicated to briefly analyzing a number of different photographs which display these markings. I have included brief descriptions of the markings, which photographs are being shown and where they may be found. While writing this section it became clear to me that explanations of the markings alone would not be sufficient. Vocabulary that is deeply rooted in photographic practice must be used on a regular basis and in light of this I have provided some basic definitions to assist researchers who may not be aware of the full range of photographic techniques and terms. Burning, dodging, recto and verso are some of the basic terms that have been defined. A large selection of artist stamps used by Newman throughout his career has been incorporated alongside the different styles of signatures. Print number and sitting book numbers have been explained, and some information on image surface marks has been provided.

15

Although many of Newman's photographs are well recognized and considered to be iconic images, including a selection of five to six studio sessions will inform researchers who may not be aware of Newman's photographic legacy. Brief descriptions underneath the images will provide context. By showing photographs that are represented in the collection alongside a number of variants, researchers will get an idea of Newman's photographic approach without actually having to access the collection. It is important to include the markings and photographs sections because all of the publications I have investigated in the annotated bibliography fail to thoroughly investigate the markings or the myriad of variants that exist for particular images. Including this information may satisfy a researcher enough that they will not need to inspect the Newman collection physically.

16

Methodology of Re-Housing the Newman Collection In the summer of 2012, I had the opportunity to work with the Newman collection over a twelveweek internship. During this time I learned the role of collections management at the AGO. I was asked to complete a basic catalogue18of the photographs and work on these objects over the course of my placement, during which time I catalogued the vast majority of the collection. Knowing that there was simply far too much material for a single student to deal with in 12 weeks, I proposed to continue working on the collection for my thesis project, with the plan to eventually create a finding aid. In order for this to be a useful finding aid, a reorganization of the collection had to occur. This was made evident to the curator and collections management during the acquisition process. The photographs had been stored in a variety of boxes, including banker's boxes. The original owner inscribed print numbers in ascending order onto these photographs; however, this arrangement has yet to be identified as having any organizational advantages. This problem lead to the decision that a total reorganization of the collection would be required, which was determined by a group that included the curator, the collections managers and myself. My responsibilities included an initial assessment of the collection as well as the creation of a more effective physical and intellectual arrangement through cataloguing the objects. I proposed a more thorough project, thereby improving the functionality of the collection, as my thesis. This was completed by printing out a list of each subject's name that was reformatted into a last name, first name table which was then alphabetized. The list was then matched to the 4820 photographs assembled for inspection and the prints were slowly and carefully reorganized based upon the box number assigned to each photograph. Particular prints were removed based on their subject matter (i.e.

17

abstractions) and then each box was given a certain number of prints dependent upon how many were mounted and how many were un-mounted. 19 This was not done for the sub lots for Bravo Stravinsky, Carl Sandburg, the Arnold Newman Exhibition Prints or the inscribed photographs, as these are to be catalogued individually at a later date. Each box contains approximately 45-65 prints, depending on space requirements, and each box has been arranged in a pyramid scheme, meaning that the largest photographs are at the bottom, with subsequently smaller photographs stacked on top. Considering that the majority of photographs in the collection are standard sizes, this means that most boxes are organized 8"x10" on top of 11"x14" on top of 16"x20" photographs. 20 Each size has been organized alphabetically from top to bottom. There are one to two boxes for oversized prints. The box indexes located in each box have been organized in this way and contain basic information located in TMS alongside them. The individual Newman prints have been assigned Art Gallery of Ontario Identification (AGO ID) numbers for primary tracking and accountability for registration inventory, and have placement holders assigned for accession numbers to be subsequently tagged and labeled onto the prints. While incompletely accessioned at the time of developing the organizational structure for the collection, each index row will link the AGO ID number to the corresponding print number, which is written in pencil in the bottom left hand corner of each photograph. This will easily allow future work on the collection to address these issues.

19 20

A mounted print could take up to 5 times the amount of space an un-mounted photograph would. This style of organization for objects of multiple sizes is considered best practice by many photographic institutions, including the Art Gallery of Ontario and George Eastman House.

18

Methodology of Creating the Indexes Going into this project, I was of the opinion that the success of the finding aid would hinge on the quality of the indexes. Ensuring complete coverage of the collection meant I would have to determine the final arrangement of the indexes beforehand, as going back to add any additional information would take many hours. Choosing what information to include was determined through investigating a number of sources. As I mentioned earlier in this paper, I wanted the finding aid to work with TMS, but still remain completely independent. To do this, I examined TMS to see what information could not be included, or had yet to be included in the records. The largest area that is missing from the TMS records is constituent entries for the sitting subjects. Including brief information on each sitting subject would assist researchers in identification and also act as a source for when collections management decide to attach constituent records for each object in the future. There was a list containing hundreds of sitting subjects that was provided with the collection upon acquisition. Knowing that Arnold Newman generally took photographs of well-known public figures made identifying these subjects fairly straightforward. This being said, there were a number of subjects that I was unable to identify due to a number of reasons, including Newman misspelling names, the previous collector providing the AGO with incorrect data, or lacking sufficient information to successfully identify the sitter. I decided to include nationality and life dates, because these are basic records in TMS for constituents. I also decided to include occupation; this decision was informed by Newman's sitting book, which would intermittently include this information next to a subject's name.21 Most of the identification process was completed by researching a variety of sources, including but not limited to encyclopaedia articles, library of congress records, death certificates, newspaper

19

articles, obituaries, artist websites, gallery websites, and so on. Any sitting subject name that brought up multiple identities was noted for visual identification at a later date. If no pertinent information could be obtained then the subject was marked as unidentified. Many subjects marked as unidentified are based upon the format of the name provided. i.e. Dr. Smith could be any number of Dr. Smith's, and considering the large number of incomplete names (almost 300), attempting to visually identify each one at this time in the project would be an inefficient use of available time.

20

Conclusion This finding aid has been constructed through my personal experiences while familiarizing myself with this extensive collection. When the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs arrived at the AGO it was disorganized, poorly housed, not catalogued and difficult to navigate. At the beginning of this project I had one primary goal, which was to make the collection accessible. I have hoped to achieve this through a thorough, albeit basic, catalogue of each object, a thorough reorganization, an object by object inventory with basic research completed on every subject alongside an overarching investigation into Arnold Newman, publications on his work, and some major projects that are found within this collection. There are still a number of tasks that need to be completed within the collection. For future users and managers of the collection, each object should be more thoroughly catalogued. By using the sitting subject index as a reference tool, collections management can easily apply relevant constituent information to each photograph. By using the box lists included with the physical photographs one can easily apply accession numbers onto the photographs. Finally, the basic cataloguing information will help inform future preservation projects, such as housing each object in an archival mylar sleeve.

Part II: The Arnold Newman Collections of Photographs Finding Aid Collections History and Provenance The Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs was donated by a single anonymous donor in the fall of 2012. The core collection was managed by Ron Kurtz on behalf of the estate of the artist. The collection has been appraised for fair market value by two independent and accredited appraisers. Information regarding the donation of the collection and the appraisal process is currently confidential. When and if this information becomes publically available it will be added to the finding aid. As such, this information may not be included in the Arnold Newman Finding Aid. At the time of the creation of this finding aid, the vast majority of the collection has been accounted for with basic catalogue data. Copyright of the images in the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs resides with the Arnold Newman Estate. The Art Gallery of Ontario has license to reproduce these images for all purposes related to the collection and its use at the Art Gallery of Ontario.

Notes on Important Figures:

Figure 1

Arnold Newman (1918 ­ 2004) Arnold Newman was an American photographer with a career spanning over 60 years. His signature style, described as "environmental portraiture," defined his photographic practice. Arnold was born in 1918 to Freda and Isador Newman in the Manhattan district of New York City. The family lived there briefly before relocating to Atlantic City and eventually settling in Miami, Florida. In 1936 at the age of 18, Newman enrolled at the University of Miami where, for the first time, he began to seriously study art; initially drawn to sculpture, painting and drawing. In Newman's second year of university he ran out of funds to continue studying and applied for work at a photographic studio owned by Leon A. Perskie in Philadelphia, where he made 49 cent portraits. While working in Philadelphia, portraiture not

23

only became Newman's primary income, but emerged as his primary source of creative and artistic expression. In 1939 Newman received a job offer for a management position at a photographic studio in West Palm Beach, Florida. This move marked the beginning of Newman's career as a nationally recognized portrait photographer and his reputation grew with a number of commissions by prominent clients eager to have him capture their likeness. Many of the photographs he took during his time in West Palm Beach are represented by the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs. Several of the prints are labelled as being taken in West Palm Beach; however, there is the possibility that many other photographs went unlabeled by Newman and as such may appear throughout the collection. In the mid-1940s Newman invested in a large format press camera, and was offered a joint exhibition with Ben Rose at the A-D Gallery in 1941. Over the next two years he built up a portfolio of portraits and expanded his photographic skillset while living in New York City. In 1942 he moved back to West Palm Beach and opened up a commercially successful portrait studio. In 1946 Newman returned to New York City and began working for many large publications, including Newsweek, Life Magazine and Fortune Magazine. He defined himself through portraits of international public figures from a wide range of professions. His signature style, "environmental portraiture," captured subjects in their day-to-day lives. Some of the more famous examples from this period can be found in the Examples of Photographs section of the finding aid. Newman's career continued to skyrocket through the 1950's to the 1970's. He photographed five American Presidents, hundreds of artists, politicians, musicians and royalty from around the world. His portraits represent a significant record of faces from the 20th century. He passed away in New York City in 2004, leaving behind his wife and two sons.
24

While Newman is best known for his portraits of well-known public figures and celebrities, the Newman Collection also contains a number of self-portraits taken throughout his life. After closing his studio, Newman continued to take photographs for pleasure, recording personal events and gatherings with friends and family. A selection of examples from the Newman Collection can be found in the Photographs section of the finding aid. Igor Stravinsky (1882 ­ 1972) The Newman Collection contains many photographs of Igor Stravinsky, including a book dummy entitled "Bravo Stravinsky." The box containing this book dummy can be found within the Physical Organization section of the finding aid. Arnold Newman owes much of his professional success to a photograph of Igor Stravinsky, which gained much critical acclaim. This photograph, including variants, can be found in the Photographs section of the finding aid. Additional photographs can be found in the sitting subject index. Igor Stravinsky was a Russian born composer who gained notoriety through his three compositions, The Firebird, Petrushka and The Rite of Spring, which were performed in Paris between 1910 and 1913. At the outbreak of World War I, Stravinsky lived in Switzerland, continuing to write and compose. However, with the numerous social and political issues associated with World War I, he had a difficult time collecting royalties on his compositions and theatrical works, especially on plays performed within his homeland of Russia. In his later years he lived and composed in America with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and Paramount Pictures, among others.

25

Carl Sandburg (1878 ­ 1967) Carl Sandburg was an American born author and writer. After dropping out of school at the age of 13, he continued his education later in life by enrolling in a local college in his hometown of Galesburg. His career as a writer began at the Chicago Daily News. A self-identified socialist, he was an avid member of the Social Democratic Party during his years living in Milwaukee. He married Lilian Steichen, the sister of Edward Steichen, during this period. Carl Sandburg is remembered for his poetry and his children's literature, most notably, Rootabaga Stories. Sandburg was awarded a Pulitzer prizes for his works The Complete Poems of Carl Sandburg, and Abraham Lincoln: The War Years. The Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs contains an especially large number of photographs of Carl Sandburg, and it also contains a sub-collection specifically dedicated to works depicting Sandburg and his life. These photographs can be found within the Physical Organization section of the finding aid. For additional photographs of Carl Sandburg not located within this section, please refer to the sitting subject index. Other Figures The Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs consists of 4820 photographs of a variety of subjects, including over 1,300 identifiable sitting subjects. Due to the logistical impossibility of writing biographical notes on each sitting subject, one can find concise information regarding all identified sitting subjects in the subject index. Names, life dates, nationality and occupations have been included in this subject index. Biographical references to Igor Stravinsky and Carl Sandburg have been expanded due to their relative importance within the collection.

Effective Dates

The dates listed for each photograph were provided by the Newman estate administration and have been verified by independent accredited appraisers. They reflect the negative dates, the time and place Arnold Newman captured the photograph but not the date of printing. The estate has identified the vintage for individual prints and this has been confirmed by accredited appraisers. The earliest negative date is the 24th of January, 1938 and the last negative date is the 22nd of August, 2004. These negative dates are listed in the subject index next to the number of associated photographs for this negative date. Further, within the subject index one can find the life dates next to each identified sitter written as (BIRTH ­ DEATH).

Physical Description and Organization

The Arnold New Collection of Photographs is composed of 4820 photographs. They are almost exclusively black and white gelatin silver prints, with only twelve chromogenic photographic prints. The vast majority of the photographs are printed on paper in `standard' sizes, i.e. 5"X7", 8"X10", 11"X14", 16"X20" and 20"X24". They have been arranged into a number of archival boxes. The collection itself is composed of five individual groups of photographs: 1. The Bravo Stravinsky Book photographs. 2. The Carl Sandburg photographs. 3. Newman's Exhibition photographs. 4. Inscribed Photographs. 5. The main collection of his work. a. Abstract photographs and landscapes. b. Portraits. The list below will give the reader a brief outline of the contents of each box. Detailed box lists that include individual object information can be found in each corresponding box. This will include the original print number, Newman's sitting number, AGO identification number, negative date, title and medium. A full document containing the box-list inventory can be found in archival CD form, located in Box 1, alongside a digital version of this finding aid. This CD can be copied onto one's computer, burned, or printed off at request by gallery employees.

Markings

The photographs found within the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs display a variety of markings on both the recto and verso of each photograph. These markings can be attributed to the original use of the photographs, as many were created for reproduction in periodic print publications and not intended as exhibition prints to be hung on a gallery wall. Like many photographers, Newman would "work" his photographs; highlighting areas that required special treatment in the development process. Further, Newman kept consistent records, and he would inscribe information onto the back of his photographs to facilitate contact with his many clients. The following ten pages will explain many of the markings that can be found on individual prints within the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs. Unfortunately, not all the markings can be deciphered, and many are illegible. The photographic examples provided in this section will provide the reader with an idea of what they will find while investigating Newman's photographs. To assist the reader in understanding these markings, we will define some key terms and vocabulary. Recto: Image side of the photograph. Verso: Reverse side of a photograph. Inscription: Any information written onto a photograph. Burning/ Dodging: During the height of the film era of photography, photographers would work in darkrooms and would physically determine the quality of a photographic print by manipulating light transmitted through the photographic negative onto light sensitive paper. Burning: A term used for adding exposure to a selected area of the photograph to increase darkness.
31

Dodging: The opposite action of burning. By preventing light from hitting a selected area of image, this area of the photograph develops lighter. In some instances, photographers would use coloured pencil to highlight what areas of a print required burning and dodging for the subsequent attempt. See Figure 17 for more information. Cropping: A popular photographic technique that occurs when a photographer isolates an area of a photograph and removes any outlying information. This effectively reframes the photograph measurably into a more appealing aesthetic. Artist's Stamp: A stamp located on the verso of a photograph which generally includes the photographer's name, location of studio and contact information. It is often used as a mark of copyright and an easier method of signing a photograph for authentication. The photographs below display the variety of stamps that can be found in the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs.

Sitting Book Number: Arnold Newman made efforts to keep records of his photographs. These numbers were also included in a sitting book where he wrote down basic information about the session. The sitting book number associated the individual print with the session, which may have resulted in a number of related photographs. Print Number: This number was taken from the estate records and verso of the photographs when the collection was acquired. There does not seem to be any organizational intent behind the print number, aside from the fact that the prints were in this inventory order when acquired by the Art Gallery of Ontario.

34

Signature: The signature of the photograph is found on either the recto or verso of a photograph. Arnold Newman had a number of different signatures that he would use. This more than likely has to do with each photograph's intended usage. Below you can see the different ways Newman would sign his photographs. We have the simple initials, often found on the verso as well as the full signature which could be found on the verso or on the recto.

Figure 16

Figure 16 represents how the markings are generally arranged on the photographs in the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs. In the bottom left hand corner we can find the Print Number, 4858. The Sitting Book number can be found in the center, 6494 with an accompanying number, 4. There are often unidentified numbers connected with the sitting book number. The Artist's Stamp is located in the top center and reads: "© ARNOLD NEWMAN/THIS PHOTOGRAPH CANNOT BE COPIED/TELEVISED OR REPRODUCED IN ANY FORM/WITHOUT THE EXPRESSED AND WRITTEN/PERMISSION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER, IT/CAN BE USED FOR EXHIBIT PURPOSES ONLY./39 WEST 67th ST., N.Y.C. 10023." These stamps can be found on the verso of a photograph, they are not necessarily level or aligned with the bottom of the photograph. These three sets
36

of data, print number, sitting book number and artist stamp, can be found on the vast majority of prints, and is often the only information provided.

Figure 17

On Figure 17 we can see some markings over the subject's face. These are "work" markings used by Arnold Newman to determine how the photograph would be burned and dodged during the development stage. By physically marking the photograph in this way, the printer could use it as a map to add light to this area of the image thereby darkening the two figures so they no longer distract the viewer from the figure of Stravinsky. There are few prints with these types of markings within the collection; this can generally be attributed to the fact that work prints are often discarded after use.

37

Figure 18 and 19 are two of the prints found in the Bravo Stravinsky book dummy. The many markings found alongside the photograph help the book publisher and binders determine where the photograph requires cropping to ensure the publisher can create a high quality copy. Many of the photographs contain a myriad of markings on the verso as displayed above.

39

Figure 20

With Figure 20 you can see that there is quite a bit more information. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the information on this print cannot be verified. Like the first example print, sitting book number, print number and artist stamp are provided. There is a string of numbers and letters and much of the inscription speaks of dodging and burning. More than likely this information was used by Newman to determine the exposure and development times of the print. While these are just a few examples of the types of markings you will find in the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs, Newman was a consistent printer, which is reflected in his markings. Only a few prints show markings which fall outside of these examples. Additional information on each individual print may be found in the box list index, the sitting subject index and by referencing the digitized Arnold Newman Sitting Book. See the table of contents for the locations of these resources.

Photographs The following pages will give the reader an overview of photographic examples of Newman's working method. Each page will reference a single sitting subject, represented by a number of variations. The first page will display four images containing identifying data. The second page will give additional information found on the verso (not shown).

Picasso, Pablo (1881 ­ 1973) Spanish Painter, Sculptor, Printmaker and Ceramicist There are numerous photographs of Pablo Picasso in the Newman Collection and the collection includes variants of each photograph, including full sized, un-cropped versions of many prints. There are also a number of photographs of Picasso in his studio, the subject surrounded by his artwork. Figures 21 ­ 24, illustrated below, are a group of variants of a photograph used by the Art Gallery of Ontario for advertising an exhibition during the summer of 2012.

Stravinsky, Igor (1882 ­ 1971) Russian American Composer, Pianist and Conductor Many sources consider Igor Stravinsky to be one of Newman's most famous subjects. The photograph of Stravinsky sitting at his grand piano validated Newman as photographer of note internationally. Interestingly, the client that hired him to shoot the photograph failed to appreciate the image and refused to publish it, opting for a variant. The Newman Collection has this image in a number of sizes, including a number of variants. Further, Newman would continue to take portraits of Igor Stravinsky throughout his life, even designing and publishing a book on the work focused around Stravinsky. The Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs has a copy of the book dummy for Bravo Stravinsky. For additional information on Bravo Stravinsky please see the entry in the annotated bibliography.

O'Keefe, Georgia (1887 ­ 1986) American Artist Stieglitz, Alfred (1864 ­ 1946) American Photographer Figure 29 and 31 are earlier portraits by Newman, Figure 29 being one of the few portraits taken of Stieglitz and O'Keefe together in the collection. O'Keefe would have her portrait taken by Newman multiple times throughout his career, including a session that was shot at O'Keefe's ranch in Arizona. The Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs contains a number of variants in different sizes and different printing conditions. They can be found by looking up either sitting subject in the subject index. Figure 30 and figure 32 are taken at a later date by Newman, of O'Keefe at her farm in Arizona. The Newman collection represents such a wide range of Newman's career that there are often multiple shoots of the same subject throughout their lives, an invaluable resource for researchers interested in Newman's career.

Moore, Henry (1898 ­ 1986) English Sculptor Henry Moore is an important subject in the Arnold Newman Collection considering the relationship the Art Gallery of Ontario has with the late artist. Many of his works are on display at the AGO, including a public work, Two Large Forms (1966-1969) on the northeast corner of the gallery's property. Arnold Newman took a substantial number of portraits of the artist, of which many are represented in the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs. For information on the portraits of Moore, look for his entry in the sitting subject index.

Sandburg, Carl (1878 ­ 1967) American Writer and Editor These photographs are some of the many portraits Newman would take of Carl Sandburg throughout his career. Sandburg and Newman would become friends through their mutual interactions together. This friendship is well documented in the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs; there are some thirty photographs of Sandburg represented in the collection, alongside an additional body of work for an unpublished book. For more information on these prints, refer to his entry in the sitting subject index.

Annotated Bibliography: Masterclass: Arnold Newman
Newman, Arnold, William A. Ewing, Todd Brandow, Arthur Ollman, David Coleman, Corinne Currat, and Arnold Newman. Masterclass: Arnold Newman. London: Thames & Hudson, 2012.

Masterclass is a recent publication of Newman's work, coinciding with an exhibition curated by William A. Ewing. The book contains a preface by curator Todd Brandow, and essays by Ewing, photographer Arthur Ollman, David Coleman and biographies by curator Corinne Currat. Each essay approaches Newman from a different perspective; Ewing investigates Newman's history by breaking up his photographic career into two parts, named Student and Master. Student covers Newman's formative years and investigates the figures, events and institutions that would influence his early photographic practice. Master focuses on his years as a practicing photographer. Ollman approaches Newman from a personal perspective. Finally, Coleman investigates Newman's work with Great American Faces, which is more thoroughly covered by the publication Faces USA. Masterclass contains many plates found in both colour and black and white. For researchers investigating Arnold Newman, his history, his publications or his exhibitions, Masterclass is an effective overview of his photographic career. Visions and Images
Diamonstein-Spielvogel, Barbaralee, and Harry M. Callahan. Visions and Images, American Photographers on Photography. New York: Rizzoli, 1981.

Visions and Images contains a number of printed interviews conducted by the author, Diamonstein-Spielvogel, a prominent American public servant, with a number of American photographers. Each interview revolves around the photographer's work, history and thoughts on the state of contemporary photography. Diamonstein-Spielvogel's interview with Arnold Newman investigates his portraits, his growth as a photographer and his thoughts on the future of his practice. They specifically mention such subjects
59

as Piet Mondrian, John Kennedy, Alfried Krupp, Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky and Jackson Pollock. Newman describes how he worked with each of these subjects, how the session progressed and the reception of each portrait. In this interview he also discusses his relationship with his wife, Augusta Newman, and how her efforts and contributions to his photographic practice make it possible for him to dedicate himself to the act of taking a photograph. Interviews with Master Photographers
Danziger, James, and Barnaby Conrad. Interviews with Master Photographers. New York: Paddington, 1977.

James Danziger, an American gallerist and Barnaby Conrad III, an American author and artist, engage with and interview a number of photographers they deem to be "masters" of photography. Within Interviews the authors engage with Minor White, Imogen Cunningham, Cornell Capa, Elliott Erwitt, Yousuf Karsh, Arnold Newman, Lord Snowdon and Brett Weston. The interview with Arnold Newman was conducted by both Danziger and Conrad and took place within the Newman family home as well as Newman's photographic studio. Questions about Newman's past and present photographic practice, Newman's thoughts on the state of contemporary photography and his preferences regarding camera technology arise in the discussion. The largest topic of conversation revolves around the act of taking a portrait, and the strategies Newman employs in taking what he considers to be a great photograph. The responses are thorough and give many insights into Newman's photographic practice and work, outside of the art historical interpretations of his work found throughout his major publications and photographic books. Those who are interested in Newman as a research subject would benefit from reading this interview. The book contains two black and white reproductions of photographs taken by Arnold Newman, Alfried Krupp, Essen, Germany 1963 and Claes Oldenburg, 1967-1972. Both of these photographs can be found within the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs.

Arnold Newman: Five Decades
Ollman, Arthur, and Arnold Newman. Arnold Newman: Five Decades. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Publ., 1986.

Five Decades is a photographic book containing 114 black and white reproductions of portraits taken by Arnold Newman between the years 1938 and the year of publication, 1986. Each photograph takes up a full page, with basic caption information (i.e. "68 LOUISE NEVELSON, NEW YORK CITY, 1972"). Arthur Ollman, an American photographer, introduces the book and succinctly covers Arnold Newman's photographic practice from its inception to the date of publication. He investigates many individual photographs illustrated in the book, while giving insights into the defining characteristics of Newman's practice during each decade. Following this introduction is a detailed biography covering Newman's academic, professional and artistic career. The book ends with a short afterword by Newman in which he outlines his thoughts on developing style, his own photographic practice, what photography is capable of achieving and what he hopes to accomplish with this retrospective. The essays can be reviewed in a short period of time. The book offers a selection of images that Newman considers important to his practice from the years 1938 ­ 1986. Finally, the index of sitting subjects within this publication makes it easy to find corresponding sitting subjects from this publication which are also represented in the Newman Collection at the AGO. Artists, Portraits from Four Decades
Newman, Arnold and Henry Geldzahler. Artists, Portraits from Four Decades. Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1980.

Artists, Portraits from Four Decades is a photographic publication with a foreword by Henry Geldzahler, commissioner of cultural affairs for New York City, and includes an introduction by Arnold Newman. While Four Decades strives to understand Newman's overall practice as a photographer, Artists specifically informs the reader of Newman's photographic approach to framing and taking portraits of other artists. As such, the essay sets a tone that delves into art history and art theory.

61

Considering the potential future uses of the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs within the context of the Art Gallery of Ontario, it makes sense that the photographs of artists will be in high demand. Anticipating this, Artists is an important publication to consider for anyone investigating Arnold Newman as an artist, or investigating the Newman Collection of Photographs within the larger context of an art gallery. Finally, the index of sitting subjects allows for the cross reference of those subjects represented in the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs. Arnold Newman, Photo District News by Anthony Lasala
Lasala, Anthony. "Arnold Newman." Photo District News [New York City] Aug. 1998, 18th ed., sec. 8.

Lasala's interview is directed towards Newman's early photographic career and Newman's thoughts on environmental portraiture. This interview does have some information not contained in other interviews in the annotated bibliography. However, Interviews with Master Photographers is far more thorough. One Mind's Eye: The Portraits and Other Photographs of Arnold Newman
Newman, Arnold, and Robert Sobieszek. One Mind's Eye: The Portraits and Other Photographs of Arnold Newman. Boston: D. R. Godine, 1974.

Out of all the publications listed in this bibliography, One Mind's Eye presents the reader with the widest variety of styles that can be found within Arnold Newman's photographic career. All the plates (192 in total) are presented with an additional seven pages of drawings, contact prints and photographic variants. These additional images are included alongside an introduction by Robert Sobieszek, curator of George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y. By taking quotes from Newman and using photographic source material as an effective visual aid, Sobieszek constructs one of the most informative and thorough biographies on the artist. Paired with the extensive collection of photographs, One Mind's Eye becomes a relevant publication for anyone researching Newman in any form. Finally,

62

the included index of sitting subjects within this publication make it easy to cross reference sitting subjects from this publication with those that are also represented in the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs. Artists Look Like This
Archives of American Art. "Artists Look Like This." Archives of American Art: The Quarterly Bulletin 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4. 1962-1963

Artists Look Like This was published through the Archives of American Art. It is composed of a singular photograph with a small caption underneath. Five photographs of artists taken by Arnold Newman were published, in order: Jacques Lipschitz, David Hare, Jo Davidson, Frederico Castellon and Karl Knaths. Each photograph has a very short biography (approximately 100 words) about the represented artist. Unless the reader is interested in Newman's photographs as mass produced objects, or is particularly interested in the Archives of American Art, I would not recommend investigating these prints in much depth. Bravo Stravinsky
Newman, Arnold, Robert Craft, Francis Steegmuller, and Igor Stravinsky. Bravo Stravinsky. Cleveland: World Pub., 1967.

The content in Bravo Stravinsky investigates Russian born composer Igor Stravinsky`s daily life in 1966. A foreword by Francis Steegmuller introduces the publication and gives some insights into Stravinsky, his thoughts and his lasting legacy. Stravinsky's relationship with Arnold Newman goes back to the beginning of Newman's career; one of Newman's most recognized and popular photographs is a portrait of Stravinsky sitting at his grand piano. The rest of the publication consists of photographs taken by Arnold Newman alongside an essay by Robert Craft. The arrangement of the text and photographs is very reminiscent of the popularized mid 19th-century photo-essay, with the text being secondary to the multitude of photographs that take up

63

the majority of the page space. Unlike the other publications covered in this annotated bibliography, Bravo Stravinsky highlights Newman's ability to put together a body of work around a single topic, constructing a full and well thought out narrative. Bravo Stravinsky is an important publication for researchers interested in the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs. In the collection, there is a full book dummy containing all of the original prints used for the publication of this book. Arnold Newman in Florida
Newman, Arnold, Richard A. Madigan and Bruce Weber. Arnold Newman in Florida. Boston, MA: D.R. Godine in Association with Norton Gallery of Art, 1988.

Arnold Newman in Florida is an exhibition catalogue organized by curator Bruce Weber of the Norton Gallery of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. The book focuses on Newman's photographic production that took place while he was living in West Palm Beach, Florida at the beginning of his career. The exhibition includes a group of prints Newman would produce revisiting Florida in the 1980's. The publication has a brief introduction by Richard A. Madigan, director of the Norton Gallery of Art, and is followed by an interview held between Newman and Weber. Researchers will find this interview valuable as it focuses on a very specific time in Newman's career. Newman enlightens the reader on his years spent in high school, the few years he spent studying in university and how photographing West Palm Beach would inform his future photographic practice. Weber and Newman discuss early exhibitions, his move to New York City in the 40s, his return to Miami and Newman's fir st portrait studio. The interview is detailed, thorough and provides some of the best material on Newman's formative years as a practicing photographer. The remainder of the publication consists of black and white photographs, arranged singularly on a page with basic identifying information underneath. The publication ends with an exhibition checklist.

Photographers Photographed
Jay, Bill. Photographers Photographed. Salt Lake City: Peregrine Smith, 1983.

Photographers Photographed is a compilation of photographs taken by English photographer Bill Jay, of other photographers. Each photograph is accompanied by a short written caption detailing some of Jay's thoughts on the photograph and/or the photographer. Newman's likeness can be found on page 13, where he is seated in his New York City apartment. While the publication does not go into much detail about Newman, it may be a worthwhile publication to investigate if one is interested in photographs of artists or photographs, or representations of Newman made by a contemporary. On the Other Side of the Camera
Crane, Arnold H. On the Other Side of the Camera. Köln: Könemann, 1995.

On the Other Side of the Camera is a publication of photographs taken by American photographer Arnold Crane of other photographers. The chapters contain four to six photographs of each photographer in a variety of settings alongside a brief written essay on the photographers in English German and French. Crane's photographs of Newman were taken in his New York Studio in 1995. Newman is seen at his desk working, sitting on a chair in the middle of his studio and the final photograph is a traditional headshot with a dark background. The essay on Newman is a general overview of his photographic career and does not offer any additional information than what can be found in any of the publications dedicated solely to Newman. Celebrating the Negative
Loengard, John. Celebrating the Negative. New York: Arcade Pub., 1994.

Celebrating the Negative is a photographic publication created by LIFE magazine photographer John Loengard. Within, Loengard displays photographs of negatives while they are being held by the original photographer. These negatives are held in front of a light source to better illu minate the finer

65

details of the object. A summary of the historical importance of the negative is provided alongside each photograph. On page 59 of the publication, Newman's negative of Igor Stravinsky is shown, with Newman holding it with white cotton gloves. Leongard provides context for the reader, labelling it as one of Newman's seminal photographs. Researchers will find this source useful if they are interested in representations of Newman and his photographic career. Famous Portraits
Gruber, L. Fritz. Famous Portraits. New York: Ziff-Davis Pub., 1960.

The Contact Sheet
Crist, Steve. The Contact Sheet. Los Angeles, California: AMMO, 2009.

The Contact Sheet offers the reader an interesting investigation into a photographic practice that other publications in this bibliography fail to do, by comparing and contrasting a single image alongside its original contact sheet. Within, Crist covers Newman's work with Charles and Ray Eames, furniture designers. To the right of the image summary are four negatives with the final image on the following page. This is an important publication as it is one of the few included in this bibliography that compares and contrasts a finalized image with a number of unedited variants. Great Photographers
Great Photographers. New York, NY: Time-Life, 1971. Print.

Great Photographers acts as a survey of what the editor of Time-Life considers to be the world's greatest photographs throughout history. Each section is broken down by two to four decades represented by approximately a dozen photographers. Each photographer is represented by a summary alongside two to four images. Arnold Newman is found on page 228-229 and is represented by his photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Geogia O'Keeffe and Yaacov Agam. The summary is brief and contains no information that cannot be found in one of the publications dedicated solely to Newman's work. If researchers are interested in how Newman has been appropriated into publications concerned with the general history of photography, this may be a worthwhile source to investigate. The Photographer's Eye
Szarkowski, John. The Photographer's Eye. New York: Museum of Modern Art; Distributed by Doubleday, Garden City, N.Y., 1966. Print.

Based on an exhibition by the same name, organized by famed Museum of Modern Art, New York City, N.Y., curator John Szarkowski, the publication acts as a reinvestigation into the formal ways photographs are perceived. Newman's photograph of Jean Arp can be found in the top right corner of page 86. For those researchers interested in Newman's presence in major photographic exhibitions of the
67

20th century, and the specific analysis of these photographs by Szarkowski, The Photographer's Eye will be of importance. Looking at Photographs
Szarkowski, John. Looking at Photographs; 100 Pictures from the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art. New York: Distributed by New York Graphic Society, Greenwich, Conn, 1973.

Edited by Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) curator John Szarkowski, Looking at Photographs fulfills the dual purposes of showcasing the MOMA's large collection of photographs and acting as an investigation into the changing landscape of photographic practice during the MOMA's then 40 years of collecting. Unrepresented are colour photographs, as Szarkowski believes they deserve their own anthology. Looking at Photographs provides interpretive text to assist in an understanding of the medium. Each photographer has two pages dedicated to their work, with one page containing a brief biography next to a photograph held at MOMA. Arnold Newman's section can be found on page 140, next to a photograph of Yasuo Kuniyoshi with a worthy analysis by Szarkowski. For researchers interested in how Newman's work is represented within the context of a greater photographic and art collection, or Szarkowski's interpretations of Newman's work, this is a worthwhile publication to investigate. Exploring Photography
Campbell, Bryn. Exploring Photography. New York: Hudson Hills, 1979.

Exploring Photography is a survey publication with 100 images which focuses on investigating the myriad of methods photographers employ in the creation of their photographs. Author and historian Bryn Campbell investigates two of Newman's photographs which are often overlooked, his collages of Andy Warhol and Clays Oldenburg, which was deliberately torn halfway down the middle. These photographs can be found on page 129. Newman gives insight on the decisions he made creating these two photographs, and his thoughts on physically manipulating the photographic paper for each print.

The Picture History of Photography.
Pollack, Peter. The Picture History of Photography: From the Earliest Beginnings to the Present Day. New York: H.N. Abrams, 1969.

The Picture History of Photography is a large publication, over 700 pages in length containing hundreds of photographic plates. Acting as a survey for the entire history of photography, American curator Peter Pollack investigates photography and photographers from its inception up until 1969, the date of this edition's revision. Chapter 50, under the section Photography Today, is dedicated to Arnold Newman. While the chapter on Newman is short, it is of use to researchers investigating his role within a larger context of photographic history. Arnold Newman, The Early Work
Newman, Arnold, Ron Kurtz, Howard Greenberg, and Philip Brookman. Arnold Newman: The Early Work. Göttingen: Steidl, 2008.

The Early Work is a posthumous publication centering around Newman's photographic practice before he would become a professional photographer. The imagines found in the book focus on the years of 1938 ­ 1941, the year he was "discovered" by Beaumont Newhall and Alfred Stieglitz. There are two forewords written by Ron Kurtz, and Howard Greenburg, who both new Newman personally and professionally. An introduction by Philip Brookman introduces the reader both to Newman, and the purpose of the publication. Newman's formative years as a photographer were not focused on portraiture specifically; however, Newman considered the work he made in West Palm Beach to be of great importance to the development of his career as a portrait photographer. The work is arranged chronologically, and each two page spread contains a single photograph on the right, with the name and date of the photograph on the left. There is no afterword or list of plates, however the publication has approximately 100 photographs.

The Great British
Newman, Arnold, John Hayes, The Great British. Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1979.

The Great British is an exhibition publication detailing a project put together between John Hayes, director of the National Portrait Gallery and Arnold Newman; where he was to photograph prominent British figures so their likeness could be held at the new photographic collection at the National Portrait Gallery. The introduction by George Perry covers the inception of the project and their choice in employing Arnold Newman. Perry further covers Newman's shooting style, and the variety of strategies Newman employs when easing a new subject into having their portrait taken. Finally, biographical information provides context for Newman as a person and a photographer. The publication is informative as each plate has a biography of the sitting subject alongside anecdotes provided by Newman. There are a large number of colour photographs in this collection, which is differentiates the publication from most Newman publications which only contain black and white images. Faces USA
Newman, Arnold. Faces USA. Garden City, NY: American Photographic Book Pub., 1978.

Faces USA is a publication covering a project named Great American Faces involving Arnold Newman and a number of American art institutions, in which Newman was challenged to take portraits of American citizens and families chosen by a panel of judges for the contest. Great American Faces was a much larger project outside of Newman's contributions, as it also included thousands of snapshots sent in by families from across the nation to be selected by judges for exhibition. This publication in particular only shows Newman's work--each family that he took portraits of includes a brief introduction alongside a number of black and white photographs.

Natural Beauty: Farber Nudes
Farber, Robert. Natural Beauty: Farber Nudes. London: Merrell, 2001.

Natural Beauty, as the source would indicate, is not a Newman publication--instead it contains a brief foreword written by Newman on Farber's photographic practice and the act of taking portraits of nudes. El Regalo De Newman, 50 Anos de Fotografia
Fundacion Pedro Barrie De LaMaza, Conde DeFenosa, ed. ElRegaloDe Newman 50 Anos DeFotografia. Coruna: Tapa Blanda, 1998.

A Spanish exhibition catalogue showcasing Newman's work spanning his 50 year career. This would be beneficial for those researchers interested in how Newman's photographs have been exhibited outside of the North American art sphere. Newman's Own
Ben-David, Calaev. The Jerusalem Report (Feb 24, 1994): 42.

This article published in The Jerusalem Report by reporter Calaev Ben-David who discusses Newman's relationship to Israel via Newman's wife, and the portraits the photographer has taken of prominent members of the Israeli Community. Newman's photographic career would include many trips to Israel to capture the portraits of politicians, artists and prominent members of the Israeli community. The article is interesting in that it analyzes a very small portion of Newman's artistic output based on geography. Further, it is one of the few articles that mentions Newman's wife, how they met and her role within his photographic practice as record keeper and artistic advisor. The article discusses three photographs in particular, an image of Newman in Jerusalem, a photograph of David-Ben Gurion and a photograph of Piet Mondrian.

Everyone who was anyone: Arnold Newman photographed the heroes of the 20th century, from Truman to Marilyn Monroe.
Morgan-Griffiths, Lauris. Financial Times [London Edition (UK)] 11 Nov 2000: 08. Print

This short article gives the reader a brief overview of Arnold Newman, and some of the portraits he has taken over the course of his career. Reporter Morgan-Griffiths shares a number of quotes by Arnold Newman to reinforce his narrative. Some of the photographs discussed are images of Marilyn Monroe, Igor Stravinsky, I.M. Pei and Picasso. For information on photographs of these subjects that are contained in the Arnold Newman Collection of photography, see the sitting subject index. Additional Sources Techniques of the Masters
Eastman Kodak Corporation "Techniques of the Masters.Arnold Newman and Andreas Heumann." Kodak Business Television. KBTV. Rochester, New York, 1990.

Techniques of the Masters is a two hour television broadcast was produced by the Eastman Kodak Company. The series includes a variety of talk-show and news style programs covering a wide variety of topics and events related to the world of photography. Each segment covers new photographic exhibitions, investigates new camera technologies, conducts interviews with photographers and curators and reviews photographic techniques for the aspiring photographer. Many of these topics are Eastman Kodak related. The lengthy interviews with master photographers provide an inside look into the life of a photographer on assignment. The final segment of this broadcast is dedicated to Arnold Newman. The program follows Newman as he conducts a studio session, creating a portrait for one member of the Kodak video production team. Throughout the session, Newman provides insight into how he constructs an image. This includes his use of natural light, using props from the location to create a pleasing composition and how he has learned to effectively direct a sitting subject. Newman's team of photographic assistants are seen
72

quite often and Newman himself comments on their technical abilities and their knowledge of when to "stay away so that I can build a relationship with my subject." Newman expands his thoughts and opinion to address the profession of photography in a more general fashion. The difficulty of the profession is a topic he believes is often overlooked by the general population. The idea behind "environmental portraiture" is discussed, and Newman explains that he coined the term at the time because he was not aware of any photographers creating portraits in a similar style. Creating the term would allow people to easily discuss his photographs. He goes on to further talk about how he makes his subjects feel comfortable with having their picture taken, as it is unnatural to hold the same pose for four to five minutes. The broadcast continues in Newman's personal studio, which includes discussions on his filing and photographic storage system. Newman discusses his photographs of Nixon, Picasso and the difficulties of retaking Stravinsky's portrait after many years. The video is an effective resource as it allows the viewer to witness Newman's process in creating a portrait alongside personal commentary from the photographer himself. Interview: Photographer Arnold Newman Discusses his Photography and his Book, Arnold Newman
Morning Edition: 1. Washington, D.C.: National Public Radio. 2000. Radio Broadcast

Interview was conducted by National Public Radio's Renee Montange who covers Newman's publication Arnold Newman. The two discuss Newman's interactions with his subjects when taking a portrait; specifically they cover his photographs of Gypsee Rose Lee, Igor Stavinsky, Woody Allen and Alfried Krupp. For the Krupp session, Newman specifically elaborated on his printing technique, the emanation of the green tone cast, and his subjective choices in printing the photograph in this colour.

Contents The main body of work within the Arnold Newman Collection of Photographs are portraits taken of approximately 1,300 different sitting subjects. There are also some, albeit relatively few, photographs of landscapes and abstract photographs. Many of these photographs have been separated out of the portraits for ease of browsing based on their title. Newman would often title his photographs as abstracts or landscapes. Of the sitting subjects, many have been successfully identified; however, there are still approximately 300 subjects that have yet to be identified or could not be identified with the information available at this time. Unidentified subjects are labelled as such if the writer could not find any pertinent information, or if there was not enough identifying information (i.e. AGO.104802 ­ Graham). This finding aid contains two main sections to assist in finding particular portraits. A list of identified sitters, listed alphabetically which include life dates, nationality and recognized occupation. To the right of this information one will find the number of photographic prints associated with this subject, the dates these photographs were taken, and the box(es) within which one can find these photographs. ID numbers have not been provided as they vary widely. One can find AGO ID numbers in the electronic spreadsheet box lists provided with this finding aid. The section containing unidentified sitters has been organized in a similar manner, minus life dates, nationality and occupation. If a researcher does happen to successfully identify an unknown sitter, the writer requests that AGO collections management staff is made aware so that this finding aid may be updated in the future. The following pages of this finding aid will list, at approximately 45 entries per page, each subject and where their related photograph can be found. An additional five pages will be dedicated to unidentified sitters.
