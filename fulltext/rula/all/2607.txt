Abstract PERFORMANCE OF PIEZOCERAMIC SENSORS

by SYED RUMMAAN AHMED Masters of Engineering Civil Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada 2013

This study is in continuation of the previous research conducted at Ryerson University to develop a model for active monitoring of reinforced concrete members using piezo-ceramic sensor. In the previous research large concrete beam were investigated. The following study examines the performance of piezo-ceramic sensor to monitor maturity of concrete and to evaluate crack width of large base width concrete plates. Small scale beams and large scale slabs specimens were tested under three and four points bending respectively to evaluate the effectiveness of piezo-sensors at different failure modes. Test results from small scale beams were used to model correlation between concrete crack width/strains and sensor signals. The test result indicated that piezo-sensor can be used for active concrete strength monitoring at later stages. It can also be used as an effective indicator of crack width for reinforced concrete members with small base width.

Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION
Reinforced concrete (RC) structures are widely used in the world due to their durability and economy. Offshore platforms, nuclear power containment, bridges and other critical structures require the most reliable and durable structural health monitoring system to maintain overall serviceability and safety throughout their life-span. This research investigates the development and implementation of piezo-ceramic sensor as a part of an active health monitoring system for reinforced concrete member. The proposed system uses embedded piezo-cermic sensor to assess the structural integrity of RC structures throughout their lifetime. The proposed system not only provides a mean of establishing a damage index relative to its initial condition but also specifies the location of the damage. Due to increasing world economic demands, a large number of sensitive structure have come into existence. These structures are very expensive and are required to have extended lifespans (exceeding 50 years). It is therefore required to design cheap, yet durable and reliable method that can be used to efficiently monitor the overall health and performance of the structure. The current study investigates the performance of piezo-ceramic sensor to detect the propagation of cracks in a structure. Although reinforced concrete is designed to crack, the amount of cracking a structural member can experience is limited. The limits are set indicating the serviceability of the structure. Concrete's low tensile stress makes it easily prone to cracking. Structures exposed to harsh environment, such as off-shore oil platforms and bridges, have firm limitation due to salt degradation, and can quickly become unserviceable. The presence of cracks will allow ingress of chloride as well as sulfate ions into concrete matrix. These salts will accelerate rebar's corrosion and will in turn results in concrete deterioration. The allowed serviceability limit of the structure is dependent upon it use and is thereby governed by design limitations. Structures such as oil tanks, containment structures, and other nuclear reactor facilities, have zero tolerance for cracking. The appearance of cracking in such a facility would make it unserviceable, and cause devastating environmental problems. The development of such a system to detect the presence of cracking in these critical structures would ensure its safe and reliable operation. The proposed piezo-ceramic system in this

investigation is developed to eliminate the drawbacks of conventional non-destructive and monitoring techniques, and to facilitate fair evaluation of reinforced concrete mega structures 1.1 Scope The scope of the study is: Â· To verify the effectiveness of embedded piezo-sensor for structural health monitoring.

Chapter 2 LITREATURE REVIEW

2.1 Introduction Reinforced concrete (RC) structures are widely used in civil infrastructure as they are low cost and possess long service life under various conditions. With good loading capacity and relatively low requirements for skilled constructions, its applications are in bridges, buildings, highway systems, underground structures, water tank, and dams. An RC Structure is strong in compression but weak in tension, frequently leading to cracks and failure. In particular, debond damage of steel reinforcing bars cause serious problems. Due to deterioration or overloading, the debond damage weakens or destroys the structure's integrity. Debond damage could also greatly reduce the tensile resistance of the structure, causing it to become more vulnerable to damage when there are earthquake and other dynamic forces. Thereforce, it is necessary to apply a damage detection strategy for engineering structure, especially in offshore and other important massive structure. To ensure structural integrity and safety, civil structures have to be equipped with Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), which aims to develop automated systems for the continuous monitoring, inspection, and damage detection of structures with minimum labour involvement. An effective SHM system can in real time detect various defects and monitor strain, stress, and temperature so that the optimum maintenance of the structures can be carried out to ensure safety and durable service life (Sun, et al., 2010)

2.2 Structural Health Monitoring Structural health monitoring (SHM), structural sensing, structural health and performance diagnosis are all related to modern structural engineering. Due to advancement in signal 4

processing, communications techniques and sensors, it is now possible to monitor precisely it structural properties (physical and mechanical) and behavior to assess the damage level and predict its structural health. SHM enhance the safety of structure by giving warning of impeding failure so that resources can be utilized more efficiently for maintenance as well as safety of structure (Huston, 2011a). Intelligent sensor helps determining the early detection of damage of structure by taking into account a potentially diverse array of data and imaging its condition. Thus it's imperative to know wide varieties of sensors that can be deployed for the inspection of structure to increase their safety and reliability. The sensors must be robust and should have good signal to noise ratio as compared to the level of potential damage that it would assess. They also need to highly reliable so that they can operate in the long run without constant monitoring (Mukhopadhyay & Ihara, 2011).

2.2.1 Components of Structural Health Monitoring In general SHM System consists of the following aspects, and are also illustrated in Figure 2.1 (Sun & Yan, 2008) 1. The transducer system, including the signal projector and receiver. 2. The signal transmitted and received system. 3. The damage identification system. 4. The warning system

Figure 2.1: The SHM system composition (W. Sun & Yan, 2008)

W. Sun and Yan (2008) in their paper discussed three basic concept of health monitoring strategy. Firstly, transducer should be placed in the form of an array to cover the region effectively. The transducer array divided the structure into many sub-regions where the damage locations were approximately determined. The accuracy of the damage location will be better and finer with the increasing of the transducer array resolution. Secondly, it was proposed that high frequency signal should be used as it is sensitive to micro cracks. Lastly, a feasible damage identification method was proposed.

2.3 Stress Wave Ultrasonic testing is based on time varying vibration or deformation generally referred as acoustics. When a solid body is disturbed by means of an impact or electrical mechanical impedance (as in piezoelectric transducers), it causes the entire body to respond by linear and angular accelerations. If the applied force is rapid and changes with time, such as piezoelectric transducers or the collision of two solid bodies and occurs within elastic strange, stress waves are generated. Primarily, three types of stress waves propagate in concrete: 6

compression waves or P waves and shear waves or S wave and third type of stress waves which propagates along the surface is known as Rayleigh waves or R-wave.

2.3.1 Longitudinal Waves The compression wave or P wave propagates through a solid medium in a similar fashion like sound waves travel through air. The polarization of P wave is longitudinal and vibrates parallel to the direction of propagation, which produces compressive or tensile stress. They are also referred as density waves because their particle density fluctuates as they travel through medium. P waves travel at higher velocities, followed by S wave and R waves, in the order. These types of waves are used to access one dimensional characteristic of internal structure, hence used in non-destructive techniques like impact-echo. For concrete, the compression waves velocity ranges from 3000 to 5000 m/s. Particle movement responsible for propagation of compression and shear waves are illustrated in Figure 2.2:

Figure 2.2: Compression and Shear waves propagation (NDT Resource Centre) 7

2.3.2 Shear Waves For Shear waves or S waves, particle motion is vertical or perpendicular to the direction of propagation, which produces shear stress. S waves provide much vibrant image of the internal structure due to their perpendicular propagation as they possess higher chance to come in contact with the internal imperfection of the medium through which they propagates. Shear waves requires an acoustically solid material for effective propagation and hence are not effective in material like liquid or gases. In concrete, the velocities of shear waves are typically 60% of the compressional waves velocity. The MIRA 3D topographer is a nondestructive instrument that utilizes stress waves to inspect structural flaws. Particle movement responsible for propagation of compression and shear waves are illustrated in Figure 2.2.

2.3.3 Rayleigh Waves Rayleigh waves, surface waves or R waves travel the surface of relatively thick solid material penetrating to a depth of one wavelength. Surface waves combine with compressional and shear waves to create an elliptic orbit particle motion. Rayleigh waves are useful as they are sensitive to surface defects and they follow surface around curves. Cracks that penetrate deeper into the surface than the wavelength will completely attenuate this wave mode. In concrete, the velocity of surface waves is typically 55% of the compression waves velocity.

2.3.4 Guided Waves Guide wave are structure borne ultrasonic waves that propagates along a structure confined and guided by its geometric boundaries. GW has been found efficient to detect damages due to its capacity of relatively long propagation range as well as its flexibility in selecting sensitive mode frequency combination.(Wang et al., 2009) The operating frequency of GWT is usually low 5 to 250 kHz compared to ultrasonic testing. (Guided Wave Testing)

2.3.5 Stress Wave Propagation Principles The waves generated by piezoelectric transducer must conform to the fundamental equation of stress and electromagnetic waves propagation. These waves principal are hence useful in ultrasonic testing and data analyzing. Among the properties of waves propagating in

isotropic solid material are wavelength, frequency and velocity. Stress wave follow the fundamental equation of waves given by:  =  .  - (2.1)

Where, C is the wave velocity, f is the wave frequency and  is the wavelength. The velocity of stress waves in a material depends upon the properties of material it travels through, its density as well as elastic properties of material from which it is composed. In an infinite elastic solid, the velocity P wave is computed by the following equation:  (1 -  )  =  (1 +  )(1 + 2 )

- (2.2)

where E is the Young's modulus of elasticity, CP is the P wave velocity,  is the density and  is the Poisson's ration. In rod-shaped structures, where the diameter of the cylinder is much smaller than its length, d<<l, the transverse strains are similar to axial strain. Therefore, velocity P wave is now given by:   =   The shear wave velocity CS is computed by the following equation:   =  2(1 + ) 9

- (2.3)

- (2.4)

Rayleigh wave velocity CR, can be determined by the following equation following equation:  = 0.87 + 1.12 1 +  - (2.5)

2.3.6 Waves Reflection/Refraction Mechanism The interaction of waves between various materials boundaries is an important characteristic of ultrasonic wave's analysis. When stress waves encounter a medium of different acoustic interface, it causes reflection, refraction and mode conversion of the waveform. An acoustic interface is the boundary between two materials with different acoustic impedance. Acoustic impedance, Z is defined by the following equation:  =  .  - (2.6)

For a P wave with normal angle of incidence, the incidence and reflected stresses are computed by the following equation:  =  2 - 1 2 + 1 - (2.7)

where,  is the density of the material and  is the compression wave velocity.

Where Ip is the stress associated with incident P waves, Rp is the stress associated with reflected P waves. Z1 is the acoustic impedance of the first medium and Z2 is the acoustic impedance of the second medium. As if compression P waves are incident on a material with lower acoustic impedance Z2 i.e. concrete/air interface, the waves sign polarity changes this means that a compression waves changes to a tension waves and most of the waves is reflected back. Similarly, if the second medium has higher acoustic impedance (Z2>>Z1) the reflected waves remain with same polarity. The acoustic impedance of each material and the wave's angle of incidence, control the stresses associated with the wave reflection and refraction (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009). 10

2.3.7 Factors Affecting Waves Propagation The particle velocity of the wave depends on the elastic properties and density of the medium through which it propagates. For elastic, homogenous solid media the compressional wave velocity is given by (Naik et al., 2003)

where, CP is compressional wave velocity; E is the dynamic modulus of elasticity;  is density; Âµ= dynamic Poisson's ratio and K= (1-Âµ)/((1+Âµ)(1-2Âµ)). Thus, the variation in E and  has more significant effect on `Cp' than variation in `Âµ'. The magnitude of the scattering wave is more if the wavelength of the propagating waves is of the same size or smaller than the size of the scatterer, resulting in rapid wave attenuation. A material causes higher rate of attenuation of any transmitted waves when it passes through non-homogeneous material. The total attenuation is the summation of the absorption and scattering and is commonly measured as loss in sound per distance of travel. Scattering in concrete is a function of the maximum particle diameter; the smaller the particle the higher the scattering experienced by the signal. Coarse aggregate will facilitate the transfer of signal within the concrete as they are homogeneous in nature. The effects of scattering and absorption will largely reduce the signal strength reaching the receiver; as well the spectral response period will increase, due to signal lag, and leading to skewed results.

2.4 Piezo-Sensors Piezoelectric sensor uses electrical/mechanical transformation. Piezoelectric effect is the strain-induced voltage or the voltage-induced strain in solids. Three main types of materials appears in piezoelectric transducer (1) single-crystal like quartz (2) polycrystalline 11

piezoceramic, for example, lead zirconate titanate (PZT); (3) piezopolymers, for example , polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Huston, 2011b). Piezoelectric sensors are actively used in SHM as smart sensing technology based on the measurement of electrical impedance and by using elastic waves. The impedance method utilizes higher frequency waves greater than 20 kHz to monitor mechanical impedance of the structure by the sensors. Physical change in the structure induces change in the mechanical properties of concrete and hence electrical impedance. Thus it can be used to identify damage in the structure. This method relies on the electrical impedance generated by a single sensor and hence can be proved ineffective when large concrete member are used. Costly impedance also restricted its application (Zhu et al., 2012). The second method of elastic waves relies on the propagation of waves. It is found active in monitoring damage in structure and is also relatively cheap. The principle of elastic wave method relies on the decomposition of frequency using FFT (Fourier Transformation) or by Wavelet Transformation into frequency amplitude domain which are analyzed. Piezo-sensors are used as an integral part of modern structural engineering. Many researches have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of sensors to help determining the material property, in strength monitoring, measuring deboning and impact evaluation.

2.4.1 Application of Piezo-electric Sensots 2.4.1.1 Cracks and Inclusion Detection Hu et al. (2013) in their research studied the effectiveness of embedded piezoelectric sensor or smart aggregates for detecting flaws and inclusions in concrete structure. A total of five specimens with identical dimensions of 5x5x16 in (127x127 x406.4mm) were casted, having smart aggregates embedded on central axis near two ends. One specimen were used as control specimen, three contained different types of defects: notch, hole, inclusion ( while the last one tested under two point loading for detecting real cracks in concrete. Band pass filter (BPS) is used so that only certain range of frequencies can be generated. Hinkley criterion 12

was adopted for arrival time determination, which measure arrival time from the angle of its energy content. However, energy contents fluctuate due to presence of noise so a certain value is subtracted to account for it. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is used for wavelet packet decomposition into time and frequency domain which represented Damage index for the structure as: 2 =1, - 0, 
2 2 =1 0, 2

 = 

- (2.9)

where, E0,j is the energy of a specimen at its healthy state, i is an index that corresponds to specimen's health status and j is the number of signal set. From their experimental investigation they concluded that notch and hole type defects affects the time of flight and signal amplitude. Signal amplitude decreased while the time of flight increased irrespective of defect type. However, impurity inclusion in concrete doesn't affect the time of flight but reduces signal amplitude. Bending test results exhibited similar behavior, time of flight increased and amplitude decreased. It was also proposed that wavelet packet decomposition based damage index is very sensitive to damage in concrete. Zhu et al. (2012) in their research also evaluated wave propagation based active crack detection technique with surface bonded and embedded piezoelectric ceramic (PZT) patches on concrete structure. A series of eight beams with one control beam was tested with different crack lengths. In their study they discussed the influence of excited frequencies; actuator sensor distance, crack depth and the type of wave propagation on the received sensor signals. Amplitude attenuation coefficient (Rv) is used as an indicator of the damage

existence in concrete structure in contrast to the baseline of the intact structure. Amplitude attenuation coefficient Rv is expressed as:  = actuation signal. 13   - (2.10)

where, Ar= is the received signal amplitude and Aa= is the maximum amplitude of the

Based on their experimental results they concluded that the signal in range of 10-100 kHz follows a trend of exponential attenuation with 10 kHz is stronger than those at excitation central frequencies more than 20 kHz. However, contradictory results were obtained while examining effect of embedded and surfaced bonded sensors on stress wave's propagation. It was shown that the nearest sensor for the surface bonded PZT received maximum voltage of 350 mV, while for the embedded PZT maximum voltage appeared maximum in the farthest sensor i.e. 1500 mV. Higher signal intensities actuated by the embedded PZT sensor make them more suitable for structural health monitoring. It was also concluded that relative attenuation factor decreases with increasing sensor distance as well as crack depth as it will decreased signal amplitude received at sensor.

2.4.1.2 Material Properties/Early Strength Evaluation The stress waves generated by PZT actuators carry information about the host structure and thus can be used to identify the properties of it. The harmonic amplitude `A' and angular frequency `' is correlated with material properties by equation 1 42  =      
1/4

- (2.11)

where, E is young modulus and  is the density of the material. From this equation, it can be seen that as Young modulus `E' of the material increases, harmonic amplitude `A' decreases. Concrete gains strength during the hydration process which leads to the increase in young's modulus of concrete. Thus, the amplitude of stress waves generated is a representation of compressive strength gain by concrete. This equation is also used in literature to estimate material properties like density and young modulus. Jinsong and Likun (2011) also conducted research to investigate the mechanical properties of concrete structure using piezoelectric sensor based wave propagation method. The experimental results of cube and cylinder specimen were used to investigate the effect of excitation frequencies; excitation amplitude, wave propagation path and curing age on the 14

output signals of sensors are evaluated. For their research they concluded that RVAC sharply decreased to a relatively steady level after the 28days curing age. The influence of the input signal was observed by varying it over the range of 1-50 kHz and found that RVAC is independent of the amplitude. The results indicated that RVAC decreased as the excitation frequency increased as the waves serves greater attenuation at higher frequencies. Kim et al. (2011) also monitored real time concrete strength by using guided waves. The guided waves signals were measured by embedded piezoelectric sensors in an unreinforced concrete member. The test was processed at 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 28 days. The maximum propagation power in each signal is extracted and related with measure compressive strength using linear regression method represented by () = 333.2 + 8.692 - (2.12)

Where S represents the estimated strength and Pw represents the maximum propagation value. signal amplitude.

They examined that the maximum power of the guided waves signal is increasing with the

2.4.1.3 Debonding Detection Wu and Chang (2006) in their study utilized built-in piezoelectric ceramic discs as sensors and actuator to diagnose debond damage in an RC structure. In their test 20x4x4 in. beams were used with a steel reinforcing bar embedded in middle having diameter of 0.75 in. Three types of test were performed on it. Firstly, debond test on RC beam to observe signal changes from debond damage in beams. Secondly, tensile test on reinforcement bars to observe signal change to load and bar deformation. Lastly, Bending test on RC beam to provide combined effect of debond damage and tensile test which provide better simulation of real application. From their test result they concluded that piezoelectric sensors are effective in determining the debonding damage. Further they showed that the signal's amplitude increases as the extent of debond increases and signal's arrival time is sensitive to rebar elongation.

2.4.2 Optical Fibre Bragg Gratting (FBG Sensor) FOS has gained prime importance to effectively monitor structural health performance. FOS is generally embedded into the structure or surface mounted to yield information about strain (static or dynamic), temperature and defects (cracks and delamination) (Kreuzer). The sensor works in way that stretching a fiber optic sensor causes change in the grating period and hence change in wavelength of ultraviolet reflected light. The operating wavelength also referred as Bragg wavelength can vary from 153-1550nm. The grating consists of a number of small fringes. Bragg grating reflects specific wavelength of light, called Bragg wavelength from there fringes as shown in Figure 2.3. This caused FBG to reflect specific frequency while transmitting other. The Bragg wavelength is thus a function of `n' the refractive index of the fiber core and  is the spacing between fringes knows as grating period as shown in Figure 2.4 given by:  = 2 - (2.13)

Figure 2.3: Operation of an FBG Optical Sensor (National Instrument, 2011)

A change in strain or temperature affect both the refractive index `n' and grating period `' which causes shift in reflected wavelength. This change is then correlated to strain and temperature (National Instrument, 2011). 16

Figure 2.4: FBG Sensors and it component (National Instrument, 2011) Many literatures are found evident of the accuracy and stability of FOS in measuring crack and strain in reinforced concrete structure. Quirion and Ballivy (2000) evaluated the performance of FOS embedded in high performance concrete. They concluded that FOS give exact measure of strain at high level as compared to LVDT (linear Variable Differential Transformer), electrical strain gauge and vibrating wire.

2.5 Other Concrete Non-Destructive Techniques 2.5.1 Impact Echo (IE) The impact echo system is composed of three systems: an impact source, a receiving transducer and wave form analyzer, which is used to store the output of the transducer in the waveform and perform signal analysis. This technique measures the surface displacement close to the impact point which is generated by mechanical impact i.e. hammer. The stress wave generated by it propagates into the objects, which undergoes multiple reflections between the test surface and the internal defects of the opposite boundary of the test objects. The reflected wave `P' travels twice distance from the surface to the internal defects i.e. 2T when the wave reflects from a free or low stress boundary (i.e. concrete/air or concrete/soil boundary) (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009).Hence, the travel time `t' between the successive arrivals of reflected `P' waves that depend on on the P wave velocity CP, and is computed by:  = 2  - (2.14)

However, where the secondary boundary has higher acoustics (i.e. concrete/steel or concrete/rock), the reflection characteristics of the signal changes and arrivals of the signal on the surface further doubles i.e. 4T.

Figure 2.5: Impact echo principle (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009) 18

Thus, the depth of the object can be determined by measuring the travel/contact time `t' of the multiple P wave reflection. Generally, the frequency value of the highest frequency component with significant amplitude are used to calculate the contact time `t' which is equal to inverse of frequency and the shortest wavelength should corresponds to the size of the smallest flaw that has to be detected. Thus, the receiving transducer must be broadband so that it can detect wide range of frequencies (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009).

2.5.2 Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) The SASW system consists of an impact device, two surface displacements transducers, and a waveform analyzer. It is used to determine stiffness profile of layered structures. It's based on the principle that various wavelength components penetrates to different depths in the layered pavement in the impact generated surface. Unlike P waves, the velocity of given R waves, CR is also a function of the property of the material it propagates through. Therefore, the frequency component of the R waves will propagate at different speeds in the layered structure. The velocity component of R wave is also termed as `phase velocity'. The velocity is calculated by measuring the travel time between two transducers of known separation distance `X', when they reach at the surface (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009). The wavelength is related to the frequency and phase velocity as,  = where,  is the phase difference 360  = .    - (2.15)

19

Figure 2.6: Principle of Spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) system (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009)

2.5.3 Ultrasonic Through Transmission (UTT) The equipment of a UTT consists of a receiving transmitting & receiving transducer and a digital waveform analyzer. This technique utilizes the relationship between the quality of concrete and the velocity of an electronic pulse through the material. The pulse velocity is computed by measuring the travel time `t' between the two transducer separated by distance `X'. It is given by the following equation  =   - (2.16)

Fairly extensive research has been conducted to relate the pulse velocity with the compressive strength. Compressive strength is based on number of variables i.e. w/c ratio, aggregate size etc., however not all of these variables affects the pulse velocity. The UTT is used to evaluate the uniformity of concrete, thus it yields more qualitative results than quantitative.

20

Figure 2.7: Ultrasonic Through Transmission (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009)

Ultrasonic tomography is often used to create an acoustic image of the structure. It uses spatial distribution of propagated stress wave's velocity, which depends on characteristic of medium through which it propagates, to reconstruct the acoustic image of the object. The Ultrasonic pulse-echo system is another technique which measures the change in the travel of the ultrasonic signal to detect the position of the cracks and discontinuities in the structure. In this technique, both transmitting and receiving transducers are placed on the same face of the structure. In the recent developments, particular filters (Split Spectrum Processing or SSP) are used in order to remove the effect of inherent noise caused by aggregates and air bubbles (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009).

2.5.4 Miniature Seismic Reflection (MSR) The MSR System consists of a vertical and tangential transducer, impact source and waveform analyzer. Its function is based on the principle of impact-echo principle. A supplementary tangential transducer helps evaluate the dynamic elastic properties of concrete. The maximum peak of the frequency spectrum generated by tangential transducer is

21

the indicator of shear wave reflection. Figure 2.8 represents typical MSR system schematic diagram.

Figure 2.8 : The MSR System (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009)

If the thickness `T' and frequency of P & S waves are known, the wave's velocity can be computed by following relation = = 2.   = = 2.   - (2.17) - (2.18)

Thus, the wave's (P & S) velocity and concrete density helps evaluate Poisson ration, shear modulus, young's modulus and bulk modulus of elasticity of concrete. MSR advantage is that it can operate from one free surface and also helps determine internal flaws.(Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009)

22

2.5.5 Impulse Response (IR) The Impulse response (IR) method is a surface reflection technique that depends on the identification of compression wave reflection. The test involves impacting the drilled shaft with low strain hammer so that structure responds to impact in bending mode i.e. it vibrates at low frequency. The FFT algorithm is used to process both signals to give, force vs frequency for the hammer impact and velocity vs frequency for the geophone responses. The frequency for the geophone is the actual structural vibration frequency at the test point in response to the impact. As the response is dependent on the impact force a "transfer function" termed as Mobility plot is derived by dividing the velocity spectrum (structure response) by the force spectrum (hammer input) with its unit expressed in `m/sN' (Clausen et al., 2012). Figure 2.9 shows typical mobility plot for pile.

Figure 2.9 : Mobility plot for pile (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009) The impulse response function depends upon the type of structure, its geometry, support condition and existence of flaws in structure. At low frequencies, pile and soil vibrate together and the mobility plot thus provides information of the dynamic stiffness of the soil/structure.

23

2.5.6 Short Pulse Radar (SPR) OR Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) Short pulse radar (SPR) is widely used for testing of concrete. SPR system is based on SPR wave's i.e. electromagnetic waves (EM) that propagate through air at the speed of light. EM wave's behavior is governed by material dielectric and conductivity properties. If the EM waves encounter two material of different dielectric constant, they will have part of it reflected from the interface and part of it transmitted through it. Any defect in concrete such as air, water, salt water or air gap, will cause a new dielectric constant in concrete. Any reflection that is caused by this new interface of different dielectric constant will be recorded by the equipment and type of severity will be assessed. Reflection coefficient of the materials is given by  1 - 2 =  1 + 2

 =

- (2.19)

where, R is the amplitude of reflected energy, I is the amplitude of incident energy, 1 and 2 are the dielectric constant of the material 1 and material 2. The larger the difference in dielectric constant larger will be the reflection. However, only defects that are perpendicular to the direction of travel of radar pulse are detected. Figure 2.10 shows schematic diagram of basic of short pulse radar technique (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009).

Figure 2.10 : Basics of Short Pulse Radar technique (Sadri & Mirkhani, 2009) 24

2.6 Cracks Width Concrete is strong in tension and weak in compression and its tensile capacity is about 5% of its compressive strength. Due to its low tensile capacity, it can be easily prone to cracks if applied load or stress exceeds the threshold value to its tensile capacity. Further, Concrete suffers many types of deterioration and distress i.e. sulphate attack, freezing/Thawing, shrinkage, corrosion etc. particularly in offshore structures. These types of distress and deterioration lead concrete to expand and contraction, ultimately leads to cracks. Cracks in concrete are not only aesthetically appealing but can also create structural problems. The Canadian Standard Association (CSA) offshore code CSA-S474-04 and Norwegian Council for Building Standardization code 3473E (E-1992) are found to be most precise in estimating crack spacing relevant to reinforced concrete offshore structure (Marzouk & Hossin, 2008; Marzouk et al., 2010). The Canadian Standard Association (CSA) offshore code CSA-S47404 provides the following expression for calculating the crack spacing:  = 2.0( + 0.1) + 1 2    - (2.20)



where, Srm=Average crack spacing (mm); k1 is the bond properties coefficient (0.4 for deformed bar, 0.8 for plain bar); k2 is coefficient to account for Strain gradient= ; S is the bar spacing in outer layer (mm); 1 and 2=Smallest and largest tensile strain in embedded zone; dbe=bar diameter (mm2); hef=effective embedded thickness (mm); b is the base width (mm); As=Area of reinforcement in effective thickness ; a1 is the distance to the top of the outer layer of reinforcement (mm); a2=distance to the inner layer of reinforcement (mm). This equation takes into account the effect of geometry as well as the effects of bond properties of bars and strain gradient. The Canadian Code suggests that crack width is a function of the average tensile strain (ft) multiplied by the average crack spacing (Sm). 0.33   25

where,    is equal to concrete compressive strength and 1 is the tensile strain on the tension reinforcement.

Norwegian Council for Building Standardization code 3473E (E-1992) on the other hands takes into account the tensioning stiffening effect for calculating represented by factor r. The average and characteristic spacing of the cracks are given by  = 1.7 - (2.22) - (2.24) - (2.23)

Similar equation is given by both, Norwegian Code 3473E and Canadian code CSA-S474-04 for calculating crack spacing. Further, Norwegian Code 3473E estimates the crack width at the level of reinforcement and Canadian code CSA-S474-04 estimates it at the surface of member. (Marzouk & Hossin, 2008) 26

2.7 Effect of Shear Span to Depth Ratio The cracking pattern and failure of beam is largely governed by the effect of shear and flexure stress magnitude. Many literatures have shown that shear-span to depth ratio (a/d) is the governing factors that influence mode of failure. This factor is directly proportional to the shear and flexure stresses at particular location in the beam (Brzev & Pao, 2009). In general, three types of failure mode or their combination occurs depending on the a/d ratio: flexural failure, diagonal tension failure, and shear compression failure as show in figure 2.12.

Figure 2.12: Failure mode of concrete beam without shear reinforcement (a)Flexure Failure (b) Diagonal tension failure (c) crack pattern of diagonal tension failure (d) Shear compression failure (ASCE ACI Committee 426, 1973)

27

Short Beam: with a/d in the range of 1 to 2.5, failure is initiated by an inclined crack usually a flexure shear crack. The actual failure may take place either by: (1). Crushing of the reduced concrete section above the tip of the crack under combined shear and compression, termed shear tension failure.(2). Secondary cracking along the tension reinforcement termed as shear tension failure. Both of these types of failure occur before the flexural strength of the beam is achieved Normal Beam: have a/d ratio in excess of 2.5. Such beams may fail either in shear or in flexure. The limiting a/d ratio above which flexure failure is certain depends on the tension steel area well as strength of concrete and steel. Long Beam: with a/d ratio greater than 5.5. Vertical flexure shear cracks develop at the midspan after approximately 50% of the load. The mode of failure depends on the amount ore reinforcement as either (concrete controlled or steel controlled). (Menon, 1998)

Lee and Kim (2008) in their considered the effect of shear span to depth (a/d) longitudinal tensile ratio and compressive strength on deflection and reserve strength after diagonal cracking. From their test result of 26RC beam, they concluded that by increasing a/d ratio from 3 to 5 and longitudinal ratio from .0093 to 0.0279, reserve strength increased by 8% and 16% respectively. They also concluded that shear reinforcement ratio should be increased with increasing a/d ratio to have adequate reserve strength after cracking. Similarly, high strength concrete decreased the diagonal concrete strength. Constantinescu and Magureanu (2010) in their research on high strength concrete observed that by decreasing a/d ratio from 1.7 to 1.5, an increase in 12% bearing resistance is achieved. Similarly, the bearing strength increased when stirrups spacing is decreased irrespective of a/d ratio. Gurutzeaga et al. studied the effect of longitudinal bar spacing on one-way slab. They observed that with short longitudinal bar spacing, the shear failure was cylindrical and uniform. On contrary, in the slab with large spacing between longitudinal bars, the shear failure was irregular and curled due to three dimensional resisting mechanisms. 28

Chapter 3 EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION

The following chapter details the experimental investigation undertaken to validate the effective of embedded piezo-ceramic sensors for structural health monitoring of reinforced concrete members. The experimental program including specimen preparation, experimental setup and test procedure are presented. Previous research dealt with small and large beams. This experimental program consisted of two small-scale beams and two full-scale slabs that were tested under flexural loading. The small-scale beams were used to develop a model to predict and quantify the appearance of cracking in a reinforced concrete member. The full scale slabs are then used to verify the model's effectiveness for predictive health monitoring of reinforced concrete plates. This experimental program was carried out to establish a correlation between sensor signal and concrete strain/crack width as well as to monitor the development of concrete early age strength.

3.1 Material Strength Gain Identification Previous research conducted by Hughi (2012) proved that the piezo-sensor provide an effective means of non-destructive material strength gain evaluation. This research will further investigate the effectiveness of piezo-sensor in concrete strength maturity. A total of 30 standard cylinders; 100 mm into 200 mm were casted. Three cylinders will be tested each day at the curing age of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 14 day. The piezo-sensor signals are also processed in small scale specimen at the same time during testing of cylinder specimen to have fair evaluation of concrete strength.

29

3.2 Structural Specimen Identification A total of four specimens were cast and tested as part of this experimental investigation, two full-scale slabs and two small-scale beams. Their specifications are summarized in Table 3.1. A series of steps were undertaken to investigate the piezo-ceramic sensors' effectiveness. These steps include theoretical capacity failure mode calculation, formwork design and mouldings, reinforcement layout, sensors mounting, casting, curing and testing procedures.

3.3 Small-Scale Beam Specimen The scope of the small-scale experimental program was to determine the piezo-ceramic sensors ability to predict, detect and quantify the appearance of flexural cracks in a reinforced concrete member. Two small scale beams were designed so that one flexural crack would appear directly at the centre. The results of these specimens are used to compare the effectiveness of piezo-ceramic sensors with conventional means of determining strains and crack widths. These specimens were also used for prediction of concrete early strength.

3.3.1 Member Specification The beams were designed to resist an ultimate bending moment of 52 kN.m, a cracking moment of 16 kN.m, and exceed a shear capacity of 150 kN; thus ensuring flexural failure. The beams had a height of 300 mm, base width of 200 mm, and unsupported span of 800 30

mm. The design requirements dictated that each beam would have three 10 M bars to act in the tension zone, two 10 M bars in the compression zone, and stirrup spaced at 125 mm, as illustrated by Figure 3.1. Two beams were loaded in 5 kN load step upto failure. Reading were taken using steel strain gauges, FBG Fibre optic sensor, concrete crack gauges and piezo-sensors. The beams cracking pattern was also visually observed throughout the loading program.

Figure 3.1: Reinforcement Details - SS Beams

3.3.2 Member Fabrication The following section explains the member fabrication process which includes formwork fabrication, reinforcement placement, casting and curing process. Ready mix concrete having a minimum of 60 MPa compressive strength was required to achieve the desired flexural capacity.

3.3.3 Formwork The formworks used in the casting of the beams were constructed out from timber. They were first modelled on Google SketchUp to have precise dimension and adequate stability as illustrated in Figure 3.2.

31

Figure 3.2: Formwork Model SS Beams (a) Assembled (b) Google Sketchup Model

The beam wooden moulds consisted of five panels assembled together using nuts and bolts. The beams sides and bottom were made from 5-ply plywood of 19 mm (3/4 in.) thickness, reinforced with timber stiffeners longitudinally and vertically bearing a cross-section of 38 x 89 mm (1.5 x 3.5 in). The vertical and longitudinal stiffeners are used to avoid distortion in the member's dimensions during the casting process. The joints between each beams side were water sealed using silicone, as to keep the moisture of the concrete confined inside the mould. The actual and modelled beam formworks are shown in Figure 3.2. A notch of 3 mm is introduced on the tension face of the beam at midspan by placing cardboard during casting, which provided a weak zone and thus facilitates the initiation of cracking

3.3.4 Reinforcement Beams reinforcement cage was made with 10 M bars of yield strength 450 MPa. The cage is made with three flexure bars in tension; two bars in compression attached with seven prefabricated stirrups attached using zip ties. The three tensile flexural bars in the specimen were attached to plastic seats to provide the 30 mm clear concrete cover required. Two hangers were also fabricated and implemented as part of the reinforcement cage. The hangers were placed one at either end of the beam, as to provide a means of transporting the member

32

once it is cast and ready to test. The placement of the reinforcement cage in the wooden mold is illustrated in Figure 3.3

Figure 3.3: Reinforcement of Small Scale Beams

3.3.5 Casting/Curing Both small scale beams were casted with Ready Mix concrete of strength of 70 MPa, minimum aggregate size of 14 mm. and with slump of 150 mm. A total of forty cylinders were also cast to obtain the compressive strength of the samples at various time intervals. Moulds were sprayed with oil lubricant before placing of concrete so that the concrete doesn't adhere to the plywood during de-moulding. The concrete was poured into the moulds, a third of the height at a time, and vibrated for two minutes to ensure an even distribution of aggregate and paste throughout the reinforced concrete beams, and to avoid the occurrence of honeycombing during the casting process. The samples were covered with damp burlap for the duration of the first seven days after casting, and sealed underneath a plastic tarp. This would ensure the proper curing of the samples in the critical first seven days. On the seventh day after the concrete reached approximately 80% of its strength, the beams were de-moulded and tested. Figure 3.4 illustrated the beams/slabs on the day of demolding. 33

Figure 3.4: Beam demolded and stacked aside each other

3.3.6 Loading Procedure Small Scale beams were tested under three point flexure tests as illustrated in Figure 3.5. Crack-Gauges are attached to the surface of the beam on the either side at 80 mm from tension surface to measure the crack width. The beam is loaded at load steps of 5kN at the midspan of the beam up to failure. Load application at the midspan would ensure that crack would first appear from the artificial notch provided Figure 3.5 illustrates the test setup. Deflection is measured using LVDT (Linear Variable Displacement Transducer), while rebar and concrete strains were recorded with different measurement devices at every load step. Piezosensors signals are recorded initially before load application and are then recorded at every increment of load, which is converted to concrete strains after.

34

3.3.7 Measurement Devices The following section explains the placement of the various measuring devices used in determining member cracking response during its loading program. These devices include steel strain gages, FBG fiber optic sensors, piezo-ceramic sensors, and concrete crack gages.

3.3.7.1 Steel Strain Guages A steel strain-gauge is attached at the centre of the middle tension reinforcement to measure strains experienced by the reinforcement at time of load application as shown in Figure 3.6. The steel strain will also be used to measure the rebar strains at the midspan, which is the probable cracking region, and determine once the beam has exceeded its serviceability limit, and ultimate limit state.

35

Figure 3.6: SS-Beams with Strain Guages

3.3.7.2 Crack Gage Crack gauges were attached over the midspan of the beam where the expected cracking region is. The crack width was measured 80 mm above the tension face of the member. These were surface mounted and were used to correlate to the results obtained from the piezoceramic sensors. The installed crack gauge is illustrated in Figure 3.7.

Figure 3.7: SS-Beams with Crack-Gauges on either face

3.3.7.3 FBG Fiber Optic Sensors The beams were also equipped with Fibre Optics Sensor (FBG) at midspan to measure

of the beam, which is also the centre of the piezo sensors. The strains from embedded The placement of Fibre Optics Sensor (FBG) is demonstrated in Figure 3.8. 36

concrete strains precisely. The FBG sensor was placed at 70 mm above the tension face

piezo-sesnor will be a useful tool to correlate concrete strains with the sensors signals.

Figure 3.8: SS-Beams with FBG Fibre Optics Sensor

3.3.7.4 Piezo-Ceramic Sensors All the beams were equipped with embedded piezosensors to determine its effectiveness as an active structural health monitoring system. The piezosensors were attached at the centre over the tension reinforcement 235 mm apart, measuring the transmitted signal at 75mm above the tension face of the beam as shown in Figure 3.9. The sensors were isolated from the tension reinforcement from the rubber pad so that a sensors signal doesn't transit through the reinforcement bars.

Figure 3.9: SS-Beams with Piezo-Ceramics Sensor

37

3.4 Full-Scale Slab Specimens 3.4.1 Member Specification Two slabs were cast as a part of full scale program. They were used to determine effectiveness of piezosensor and also validate the model determined from small scale experimental program. The piezosensors were arranged to depict different cracking mechanism (Shear and Flexure) experienced by the slab by varying (a/d) ratio.

3.4.2 Member Fabrication The slabs were designed to resist an ultimate bending moment of 238.38 kN.m , and a cracking moment of 76.68 kN.m . One slab was forced to failure in shear and the second slab was forced to fail in flexure. This was achieved by varying the shear span (a/d) ratios as discussed in Section 2.7. Both slabs had a height of 300 mm, base width of 1100 mm and unsupported span of 2500 mm. Based on CSA A-23 requirements each slab was dictated to have five 30 M bars in the tension zone. Minimum reinforcement was provided with 10M bars spaced at 300 mm perpendicular to the flexural reinforcement in the tension zone and in both direction in the compression zone as shown in Figure 3.10

Figure 3.10: Reinforcement Detail Â­ LS Slab

38

3.4.2.1 Shear Span to Depth Ratio Many literatures have shown that shear-span to depth ratio (a/d) is the governing factors that influence mode of failure. This factor is directly proportional to the shear and flexure stresses at particular location in the beam (Brzev & Pao, 2009). LS-S1 has (a/d) ratio of 4.04 which falls into the category of normal beam, having (a/d) ratio exceeding 2.5. Normal beam are beams either fails in shear or flexure depending on concrete strength and steel ratio. LS-S2 also has (a/d) ratio of 2.67 and governs the limitation for normal beam. (Menon, 1998). Gurutzeaga et al. studied the effect of longitudinal bar spacing on one-way slab. They observed that with short longitudinal bar spacing, the shear failure was cylindrical and uniform. On contrary, in the slab with large spacing between longitudinal bars, the shear failure was irregular and curled due to three dimensional resisting mechanisms.

3.4.3 Formwork The slabs were modelled precisely on the Google SketchUp as shown in Figure 3.11. Two slabs formwork were moulded side by side resting on three 5-ply plywood having dimension of 1219 x 2438 mm (4x8 ft.) to ensure an even surface. The slab sides were made of the same 5-ply plywood cut to dimension reinforced laterally with 18 x 38 mm (1.5 x 3.5 in.) at bottom and with 18 x 18 mm (1.5 x 1.5 in.) at top. These parts were joined to each other and at the bottom plywood surface using screws of varying length. The sides were sealed using silicone and duct tape was applied at the joining surfaces of the bottom plywood. The actual and modelled beam formwork as illustrated in Figure 3.11.

3.4.4 Reinforcement Slab reinforcement cage was made by placing 30 M bar in bottom longitudinally with minimum shrinkage reinforcement of 10 M bar placed in transverse direction with reinforcement ratio of 1.3%. Top layer comprises of minimum flexural and shrinkage reinforcement i.e. 10 M bar placed in both direction. Longitudinal reinforcement is attached to the transverse reinforcement by means of zip ties. Bottom and top layer were attached to the plastic seats as to provide clearance of 50 mm. and 230 mm. with the bottom respectively. Eight hangers in pairs were placed at each corner of the slab so it can be used to transport the slab. The reinforcement cage of the slab is illustrated in Figure 3.12.

3.4.5 Casting/Curing Both Large scale slabs were casted with the same Ready Mix concrete as that of beam having compressive strength of 60 MPa, minimum aggregate size of 14 mm. and with slump of 150 mm. Moulds were sprayed with oil lubricant before placing of concrete so that the concrete doesn't adhere to the plywood during de-moulding. The concrete was poured into the moulds, a third of the height at a time, and vibrated for two minutes to ensure an even distribution of aggregate and paste throughout the reinforced concrete beams, and to avoid the occurrence of honeycombing during the casting process. The samples were covered with damp burlap for the duration of the first seven days after casting, and sealed underneath a plastic tarp as shown in Figure 3.13. This would ensure the proper curing of the samples in the critical first seven days. On the seventh day after the concrete reached approximately 80% of its strength, the beams were de-moulded and tested. Figure 3.14 illustrated the slabs on the day of demolding.

3.4.6 Loading Procedure Large scale slabs were tested under four point bending as illustrated in Figure 3.15. Shear and flexure mode of failure were obtained by varying span to depth ratio of the slabs. LS-S1 and LS-S2 were tested with shear span to depth ratio (a/d) of 4.04 and 2.76 respectively. Slabs were loaded in 10kN steps up to failure. Crack gauges are attached over the surface after the first crack become visible at the surface. Three LVDT's are attached; two at the quarter spans and one at the midspans to measure displacement through the loading program. The signals are recorded from different set of embedded piezosensors to monitor the whole region of slab forming an array. An initial signals reading from piezosensors was noted before load is applied. These signals are then correlated to the rebar strains, chiefly at the midspan to validate the effectiveness of the model.

3.4.7 Measurement Devices 3.4.7.1 Steel Strain Gage Rebar's in LS-S1 and LS-S2 were equipped with six and nine strain gauges respectively. The steel strain gauges were used to measure strains in rebar's between sensors up to serviceability limit of 2/3 fy as indicated by CSA code. The LS-S1 is loaded in a way to fail in flexure and is thereby equipped with six strain gauges. Three strains gauges were attached to second and to fourth rebar's at quarter and middle spans as shown in Figure. LS-S2 is loaded in a way to fail in shear and is equipped with nine strain gauges i.e. three in second rebar and six in fourth rebar to measure as shown in Figure 3.16-3.17

3.4.7.2 Crack Guage Crack Gauges were attached to the surface of the concrete once concrete cracking had initiated. These crack-gages are intended to measure the crack width from the initiation of cracking to the serviceability limit of the slab. The length of the crack gauge used was 10cm and measure the strains in Âµm.

3.4.7.3 Piezo-Ceramic Sensors Large scales slabs (LS-S1/LS-S2) were equipped with equal number of number of piezosensors (i.e. fifteen sensors) to monitor the shear and flexure cracks in the reinforced concrete members. Twelve piezo-sensors are distributed along two longitudinal bars (i.e. second and fourth bar) in tension, while two of them are mounted on the top longitudinal compression reinforcement bars in each slab as shown in Figure 3.18-3.21. Figure 3.22 illustrates the final placement of all measuring devices in large scale samples. These piezo-sensors work as a pair of transmitting and receiving sensors to make an array over the whole slab. The sensor signals are transmitted and received in the following manner as shown in Table 3.2

Chapter 4 RESULT ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Introduction This chapter will discuss the results obtained from the experimental program for the small scale and large-scale specimens. This research work is in continuations of the past research conducted by Hughi (2012) on the piezoceramic sensor. The sensor signal output determined are used establish relation between concrete strength maturity and frequency shift as well as to correlate the sensor signals with the concrete strain/crack width.

4.2 Early Strength Development An investigation was carried out for quantifying the development of concrete's early strength using the piezo-sensors on the small scale experimental beams. This section will illustrate the results obtained from multiple standard concrete cylinders testing during the first seven days after concrete casting (for results see Appendix A). The result obtained for the concrete compressive strength is plotted in Figure 4.1 and and tabulated in Table 4.1.

Figure 4.2 represents the vibration characteristic or frequency shift for SS-B1 and SS-B2 between two piezo-sensors in the first seven days of casting. The initial reading was taken after 24 hours of the mix casting as is used as a reference for shift in frequency for the days after. Four control points were taken on vibration characteristic curve as a reference of frequency shift. These points were tracked for the first seven days on the vibration characteristic curve and the resulting shift are illustrated in Figure 4.2, and tabulated in Table 4.2. The proposed method of determining compressive strength by Hughi (2012) is based on initial compressive strength after 24hours of casting and on the average spectral shift of frequency domain with respect to initial condition. The equation used to predict the compressive strength is given by:
    = 163.65    - (121.47 + 1 )

The vibration characteristic of the beam were taken daily for the first seven days to accurately measure the natural frequency shift of the concrete mix. Three standard cylinders are also tested daily for the first seven to have reliable compressive strength for comparison. Specified points representing the highs and lows of spectrum were monitored throughout the development of compressive strength. Table 4.3 tabulates the average spectral shift of the small scale beams. It can be seen from the table that the frequency domain has shifted from 1.04 to 1.07 for SS-B1 and 1.05 to 1.07 for SS-B2 in the first seven days. The reading was also taken on the test day i.e. fourteenth day and sixteenth day for SS-B1 and SS-B2 respectively. The average spectral shift found was 1.27 and 1.22 for SS-B1 and SS-B2 respectively.

Table 4.3: Average Beam Frequency Spectral Shift; (a) SS-B1, (b) SS-B2

To verify equation 4.1, the spectral shift obtained in Table 4.3 are processed using equation the equation into the respective compressive strength as to compare the standard cylinder compressive strength to that obtained from piezo-system. The results of the compressive strength for the first seven days along with that obtained from piezo-sensor system are tabulated in Table 4.4 and illustrated in Figure 4.3.

The results obtained from the analysis suggest that piezo-system give good evaluation of concrete compressive strength at later stages. It is also observed that the results obtained during first seven days are far from those obtained using standard cylinder testing. These results are in contrary to that obtained by Hughi and Marzouk (2013) as their results experienced deviation at latter stages. Thus it can be concluded that the proposed equation is inconsistent for variety of concrete mix. Other parameter influencing the evaluation of concrete compressive strength using piezo-system must be investigated and equation must be modified.

4.3.1 Small Scale Beams The small scale program consisted of two beams tested under three points loading. These members were equipped with pair of piezo-sensors, FBG Fibre Optic sensor, steel strain gauge and a crack gauges on either face of the beam. The beams were loaded to failure in 5 kN load step and the results obtained from the measurement devices are used to correlates concrete strain with piezo-sensor signals. The HMI value obtained from the piezosensors signals are interpreted to concrete strains using relationship proposed by Hughi (2012) in their past research.

4.3.1.1 Member Behaviour The two beams tested in this experimental program were identical with respect to geometry, reinforcement detailing, material properties and loading procedure. The beams mid-span load deflection curves are presented in Figure 4.4, which demonstrate that both beams exhibited similar behaviour on application of loads. Table 4.5 tabulates the failure load, corresponding mid-span deflection, observed and actual cracking load. SS-B1 has the failure load of 170 kN with midspan deflection of 2.45 mm; similarly SS-B2 has the failure load of 170 kN with midspan deflection of 1.98 mm. Overall the member has comparable durability as well as failure mode. Both beams failed in flexure as dictated by their design. The crack was first initiated at the midspan and their corresponding observed loads are tabulated in Table 4.5. Actual cracking load corresponds to average concrete strain of 110 Âµm that was experienced by crack gauges attached to either face of the beam.

Figure 4.5 represents the strain experienced by the rebars at the midspan on the application of load. It can be seen from the graph that both beam depicted similar behaviour for load and strain curve. For both beam, the steel started to yield after about 2500 Âµm which corresponds to strain for 450 MPa steel. The crack width formulations as indicted by CSA-S474 corresponds to 2/3 yield stress of rebar which is primary purpose in calculating crack width. The corresponding strain at the serviceability limit is 1650Âµm which is experienced by SS-B1 at around 110 kN and SS-B2 by around 120 kN.

4.3.1.2 Piezo-Sensor Results The piezo-sensors were to monitor the development of cracks across the midsection of the member. The sensors are used to compare the signal output from the piezo-sensors and strain reading from crack gauges and FBG (Fibre Optics Sensor). The sensors signals are recorded as HMI (Health Monitoring Index) which depends upon the initial and final amplitude. The results obtained from the measurement devices are used to locate the point at which the beam has reached its cracking load and to correlates the piezo-sensor strains with concrete strains. The crack width equation as given by Canadian Offshore structures code (CSA-S474-04) gives the average crack width as a function of average crack spacing (Srm) and total average tensile concrete strain considering the contribution of tension stiffening. CSA-S474-04 and NS 3473 E provides similar expression for calculating crack spacing with Canadian Code estimating the crack spacing at the surface of the member while Norwegian Code estimates it at the level of reinforcement. Equation 2.20-2.23 are used to calculated the crack spacing, average crack width and character crack width and are given by following expressions:  = 2.0( + 0.1) + 1 2     = 1  57  = 1.7



The values of HMI are used to approximate average concrete strains between two piezsensors for pre and post cracking stage is given by equation: (Hughi, 2012)  = 0.1217 ln( ) - 0.2664; 0.1335 ln( ) - 0.2875; 0    110 0    3500

Equation (4.3) is used to calculate piezo-sensor strains. These strains are related to the values of strains measured by FBG Fibre Optic Sensor (FBG) and crack gauges on either face. Table 4.6-4.7 tabulates the actual and observed cracking loads and their respective strains. It can be seen from the table that actual cracking load corresponding to 110 Âµm strain is experienced by SS-B1 at around 50 kN and SS-B2 at around 55 kN. At the actual cracking load on SS-B1, 58

the value of strain from crack gauges is 109.5 Âµm while piezo-sensors strains came out to be 132.50 Âµm with the percentage difference of 17.36%. Similarly, crack gauges on SS-B2 experienced strains of 127.50 Âµm with 223Âµm piezo-sensor strains with 74.90% percentage difference. Table 4.6-4.7 tabulates the strains measured by crack gauges and interpreted piezo-sensor strains. SS-B1 experienced the crack at the load of 65 kN with 665 Âµm crack gauges strain and 543 Âµm piezo-sensor strains with overall difference of 18.35%. Similarly, SS-B2 experienced the crack at 85 kN load with 1152 Âµm and 1597 Âµm strain for crack gauges and piezo-sensor respectively. The percentage difference in strain measured by both was 38.62%.

Figure 4.7 Â­ 4.8 represents the piezo-strains, average crack gauge strain and FBG strains. It can be seen from the Figure 4.7 that piezo-sensors strains of SS-B1 were in good comparison to that of crack gauges strain up to 500 Âµm but starts to deviate from it afterwards. Similarly, 59

the piezo-sensor strain of SS-B2 doesn't correspond to that of strain from crack-gauges and FBG from start as show in Figure 4.8. The probable reason for this deviation is that the equation derived by Hughi (2012) based on different concrete strength and the piezo-sensors are made from different epoxy coated material. The proposed equation is dependent only on the HMI values which result in erroneous strains.

Figure 4.7: Load Strains Graph (SS-B1)

Figure 4.8: Load Strains Graph (SS-B2) Figure 4.9-4.10 represents the comparison of crack-width measured from crack-gauges, average crack width equation and piezo-sensors HMI based crack width equation. It can be seen that piezo-sensors in SS-B1 gave accurate crack width until the actual cracking load 60

strain i.e. 50 kN and similar is the results from SS-B2 which gives precise crack width upto a load of 55 N. After the concrete has reached the 110 Âµm strain, the piezo-sensor crack width deviated from that experienced by the crack-gauges in both beams. SS-B1 piezo-sensor crack width didn't experience as much deviation as that experienced by SS-B2 but results obtained were not in good agreement as those measured by crack-gauges. Similarly, the average crack width equation given by CSA-S474-04 showed that concrete start to crack at about 80 kN load and increased linearly at a steady rate. It can be seen that average crack width equation hasn't give good justification of crack width as in comparison to reading measured by crackgauge. On the other hand in SS-B2, it can be seen the piezo-sensor crack width appears to give close relation to the crack width after the load of 120 kN. The piezo crack width appears to whirl around the graphed average crack width line as given by equation 2.21.

4.3.2 Large Scale Slabs Two slabs were tested under large scale experimental program which have similar dimension, longitudinal and transverse reinforcement. Slabs were tested under four point bending at 10 kN load steps under varying shear span to have different mode of failure i.e. shear and flexure. Slabs were equipped with steel strain gauges to illustrate member behaviour throughout the loading procedure. The results from piezo-sensors were used to correlate it to concrete strain/crack width and are also verified by small scale experimental results.

4.3.2.1 Member Behaviour The load deflection curve for both slabs LS-S1 and LS-S2 is shown in Figure 4.11. Three LVDT were installed in each slab at mid and the two quarter span of the beams. From the load deflection graph, it can be seen that LS-S1 has achieved higher deflection at midspans at lower load than LS-S2. The reason for this is that LS-S1 was loaded with higher span to depth ratio to have flexure failure and has thereby experienced more deflection. LS-S2 has lower shear span to acquire flexure failure and hence it can be seen that quarter span deflections are higher in LS-S2 than LS-S1 at lower load. 62

Figure 4.11: Load Deflection Curve; (a) LS-S1 midspan (b) LS-S1 Quarter Span (c) LSS2 midspan (d) LS-S2 Quarter Span

Figure 4.12-4.13 represents the rebar strain of LS-S1 and LS-S2 at every 10kN load step. From the graphs of Figure 4.12, it can be seen that midspan strains recorded on second and fourth rebar were consistent up to load of 80 kN and then it started to deviate. Overall the trend of strain increment was found consistent for strain gauge `B' and `E' following a linear behaviour at the end. Similar behaviour of strain was experienced by strain gauges on left quarter span `F' and `C' and on the right quarter span `D' and `A'. The strain gauges at quarter span achieved a plateau at around 160 kN following by yielding of rebar at constant load and then responded in a linear fashion to the load. 63

Figure 4.13 indicate the rebar strain experienced by LS-S2 placed at different location as indicated in Figure 3.18. Strain gauge `B', `D' and `A', `E' are placed at equidistance from the middle of rebar and hence are plotted together for comparison. Whereas strain gauge `C' is located close to midspan and strain gauge `F' is placed near to support to have adequate strains measurement throughout the span. All strain gauges other than `F' exhibited similar trend indicating strain plateau achieved around load of 120 kN followed by linear increase of strain thereafter. Similar behaviour was exhibited by LS-S1 which showed that both slabs have comparable durability for results comparison.

Absurd reading of piezo-sensor signals were obtained on application of load on both slabs as shown in Figure 4.14-4.15. HMI reading of LS-S1 showed that the sensor worked initially giving change in amplitude upto load of 100 kN and then achieved a plateau. Similar, results were obtained by LS-S2 showing no signs of change in amplitude on application of load. These results showed that the signal are either completely attenuated by using reinforced concrete members of higher width as 65

compare to those of beams. Other probable reason could be that the crack might not have run through the whole width of slab cross-section thereby no change of amplitude was observed after certain point.

Chapter 5 CONCLUSION

This project was intended to determine the effectiveness of embedded piezo-sensor to monitor structural health. Determination of crack width is important ensure the serviceability of concrete. The test comprises of small scale beam and large scale slabs used to determine the piezo-sensor workability in reinforced concrete members. Small scale beams were tested to verify the effectiveness of sensor as well to correlate the piezo-sensor signals with concrete strain/crack width. The developed model was verified in the light of past research as well as verified by applying it to large scale members.

5.1 Research Findings Throughout the casting process, the sensor proved to be very durable and the rugged epoxy coating made it ideal for mass concrete structure. The piezo-sensors proved to be effective in determining concrete strength maturity for varying dimension structural member. The equation presented for determining concrete early strength appeared to give good estimate of concrete strength at the later stage in this research. In the previous research, Hughi (2012) showed that the piezo-sensor showed good strength evaluation in early six days. Thus, it can be concluded that piezo-sensor provide good evaluation of concrete strength. However the proposed equation is very sensitive by means picking control points and analysing their shift which can result in erroneous results. Small scale beam and large scale slabs were also tested under three and four point bending respectively. The signals from sensor were recorded at every load in terms of difference in amplitude with respect to initial condition referred as HMI. For concrete strain/crack width, the data from different measuring devices was carefully processed to correlation it to signal change. From the experimental program, it can be concluded that small scale beam piezosensor strain showed good comparison with crack-gauges strain. However, piezo-sensor 67

system doesn't appear to work for reinforced concrete members with large base width more than a meter width due to rapid attenuation of signal. Further, piezo-system proved to be a useful indicator of concrete maturity at latter stages which is in contrary to results obtained by in their research. The equation for piezo-system concrete strain and early strength as derived by Hughi (2012) is very much dependent on their particular testing condition. In this research, different concrete mix and epoxy coating used for encasing piezo-sensor might have led to erroneous results for piezo-strains as well as piezo dictated early strength.

5.2 Recommendation In the light of this experimental program, following recommendation can be made: Â· Â· The value of HMI interpreted by piezo-sensors at different condition need to be evaluated carefully. The complete attenuation of piezo-signal in large base width reinforced members need to be evaluated and governing factor should be considered before designing any health monitoring system.
