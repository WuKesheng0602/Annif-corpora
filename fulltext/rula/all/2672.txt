The Schostal Agency: A Finding Aid for the Schostal Press Collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario Master of Arts, 2014 Rebecca Madamba Film and Photography Preservation and Collections Management Ryerson University Abstract This thesis presents the applied project of housing, intellectually arranging and creating a finding aid for the Schostal Agency collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO). This collection includes 5,066 gelatin silver prints, 58 information sheets, and 34 photograph envelopes dating from the late 1920s to mid 1940s. The paper is structured in two parts: 1) an analytical paper, and 2) the finding aid. Part one investigates the historical context of the Schostal Agency, finding aids and collections management practices, as well as the methodology for organizing, housing, and creating the finding aid. Part two is the finding aid, which includes a descriptive summary, administrative information, scope and content of the collection, biographies and historical sketches, box lists, and a summary box list tracing the collection as a whole. This document will be made available to researchers in the Marvin Gelber Print and Drawing Study Centre at the AGO.

PART I: ANALYTICAL PAPER Introduction In 1992, an unknown Austrian art dealer made an extraordinary discovery in the basement of an apartment in the ninth district of Vienna. Approximately 130,000 well preserved photographs bearing the Schostal Agency stamp came to light more than 40 years after the agency went out of business in 1948.1 Once a major European press agency from the late 1920s to 1930s, it produced and distributed both locally and globally up to one million photographs at its head office in Vienna, Austria in a wide range of topics such as world events, fashion and advertising.2 In June 1938 Nazi troops invaded Austria. At this time, the Schostal agency, owned by Robert F. Schostal, was taken over by an Aryan director named Friedrich Gondosch, and rebranded with the stamp "Wien Bild" followed by the catch phrase "Fotos für Presse und Propaganda."3 Gondosch had close relationships with members of the National Socialist party and they began to use the agency to produce and distribute Nazi propaganda.4 After the war, in 1948, the agency closed and for an unknown reason some of the photos were hidden in a basement in Vienna for over 40 years.5 Parts of the collection that were discovered in 1992 were sold or auctioned off to various institutions. As Anne-Dorte Krause, Picture Archive Researcher at the German Historical Museum in Berlin, explained in a private correspondence, the photographs were sold and divided

across various institutions.6 In the article "Agentur Schostal: Mit den Fotos Kehrt die Erinnerung zurück, (2002) author Milena Grief notes several of these institutions: The German Historical Museum bought 40,000 photos in 1995, The Hamburg Museum of Arts and Crafts bought 350 fashion photographs, and some were even discovered in the collection of the National Library of Vienna. Other isolated examples of prints bearing the Schostal agency stamp have surfaced at art auctions.7 The majority of the photographs are owned by the Austrian publisher Christian Brandstätter, the founder of IMAGNO Brandstätter Institute, a leading historical picture agency in Austria that currently has 300,000 Schostal photographs in their holdings. It is unknown how this company acquired the majority of photographs as the number in the collection surpasses the 130,000 prints discovered in 1992.8 A portion of this collection, 5,066 gelatin silver prints, 58 information sheets, and 34 photograph envelopes made between 1927 and 1945, was anonymously donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) in 2008. It includes photographs by studios and photographers such as Becker & Maass (studio active in Berlin, 1902­1945), Dainko (20th century), Anton Doliwa (Austrian, 1905-1954?), Karel Hájek (Czech, 1900 ­1978), Alois Sedlar (20th century), Wilhelm Sturm (Austrian, 1915­1980) and Eva Tropper (Austrian, 20th century), as well as works made for other agencies: the Associated Press, Atlantic Photo and Keystone.9 Since 2008, when the Schostal collection was anonymously donated to the AGO, the photographs in the collection remained housed in the original boxes and order imposed on them

by the donor. The current organization, which will be described in more detail in the Methodology section of this thesis, made the photographs in this collection difficult to access. This applied thesis project set out with two main goals: 1. To re-house this collection of 5,066 press photographs; (later discovering an additional 58 information sheets, and 34 photograph envelopes) and 2. Create a finding aid to make it accessible to researchers. This posed the following research questions: What is the best way to house this collection? What is the best method of organizing the content? And finally, what is the historical context of the Schostal Agency? With these goals in mind, this thesis will discuss how to preserve a collection of international historical significance, as well as make it more accessible to researchers through a finding aid that can be used to locate the prints in this collection by maker, date and keywords for subject matter. The first section of this thesis provides a descriptive analysis of the process and methodology for completing this project. It has been divided into four sections: 1. Literature Survey: a) Historical Context, and b) Finding Aids and Collections Management Practices, 2. Description of the Schostal Agency Collection at the AGO, 3. Housing Strategy, and 4. Creation of the Finding Aid. The literature survey establishes the rationale for each choice made in both the physical and intellectual organization of this collection. This is followed by a description of the collection both within its original context in Central Europe between late 1920s and late 1930s, and its role in the AGO collection. The final two sections describe the methodology behind the physical organization of the collection, and creation of the finding aid.

Literature Survey: Part I: Historical Context The Schostal Agency was founded in 1929 with the aim of producing and distributing photographs both locally and globally.10 With the exception of a brief history of the agency written by Milena Grief in a journal article for Rundbrief Fotografie 9 (2002),11 no source has dealt with the Schostal Agency specifically. However, this literature survey uses several other sources that address the history of press photography, press agencies and the social, cultural and political contexts in which they developed in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. This survey has been divided into two sections: (a) History of Press Agencies, and (b) Photography in Europe, late 1920s to 1930s. The first section provides an overview of the history of press agencies in order to contextualize the Schostal collection's place in the history of photography. The focus is on literature written specifically about the collection's original historical and cultural context. This will shed light on the following dominant cultural influences on photography in the AGO Schostal collection: WWII Nazi propaganda, the worker photography movement, as well as modern fashion and portrait photography. The second half of this literature survey will discuss the collections management resources examined in order to develop an effective approach to the physical and intellectual organization of the finding aid. (A) HISTORY OF PRESS AGENCIES The Schostal Agency emerged at the height of press photography in the late 1920s and 1930s, producing up to a million photographs.12 This raises the question: why did agencies start to proliferate at this time and place? From the literature reviewed, the answer lies in the

introduction of new technology. In his book 20th Century Photography (London: Carlton Books, 1999), Reuel Golden attributes this phenomenon to new technologies such as the 35mm Leica camera, which replaced bulky and difficult to use equipment, making the medium more accessible, and the capture of candid moments or cultural and historical events easier and more rapid. This allowed an unsurpassed growth of the medium, particularly in the field of photojournalism. Indeed, no decade prior to this had produced such a vast amount of photographs. Today, this makes it challenging to track the history of press agencies founded in the twentieth century, and the various photographers and studios that worked with them. Examining how other photographic press agencies worked can establish a point of reference and greater understanding about how the Schostal agency may have functioned. Hendrik Neubauer's work Black Star: 60 Years of Photojournalism, (Köln: Könemann, 1997) describes the history of the Black Star agency and its photographers. In the introduction Neubauer offers a comprehensive overview of how press agencies worked. He asserts that modern photojournalism was developed in Germany around 1925 in the workers' illustrated magazines of the Weimar Republic and the Soviet Union and where many of Black Star's photographers came from in the early years.13 However, many Jewish photographers, such as the founders of Black Star, fled Europe during the mid-1930s to escape the Nazi regime.14 Black Star acts as a point of comparison and contrast for the Schostal Agency. While the Schostal Agency and its history must be understood in the context of Nazi oppression, Black Star's photographers were forced to flee this environment, establishing their agency in the United States.

Tim Gidal, a photographer born in Munich in 1909 who worked for several agencies, including Life magazine and the Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung, was part of this generation. In his book Modern Photojournalism: Origin and Evolution, 1910-1933 (1973) he argues that the individual photo-reporter was the backbone of a new kind of photojournalism. He stated that, "It seems to me that I always encountered the same basic themes in my reportages: how does man live, how does he fit into society, and what is the life of this society."15 For Gidal, the photo reporter's job was to present an objective and truthful image of the "factual, tangible world."16 Photographers such as Gidal believed that true innovators from this era were able to have their aesthetic style reflected in newspapers and magazines, despite changes and manipulations that may have occurred at the hands of photo editors after photographers submitted their photographs. As Neubauer asserts, the role of the picture agency was simply to create the relationships between the photographer and the picture editors in order to make sure material is created, published and the employees are compensated.17 Gidal and Neubauer's literature draws attention to the fact that the history of press agencies need to be understood in terms of a complex network of agencies, editors and photographers. Beaumont Newhall, in his seminal book, The History of Photography: From 1839 to the Present, 5th ed., (New York Museum of Modern Art, 1982) shares Gidal's view on the role of the photographer. Newhall dedicates an entire chapter to the evolution of press photography in his section titled "For the Printed Page," thus acknowledging the importance of this form of the medium. Primarily concerned with establishing aesthetic criteria, he argues that new technologies, which placed cameras in the hands of numerous amateur photographers, did not

automatically generate a photograph of high standard. He asserts that news photography requires a unique skill set such as "boldness, strong nerves, and a mastery of his camera so complete that handling it is an automatic reflex."18 In essence, the technology of the era allowed for the medium to grow and evolve; press agencies such as Schostal and their photographers played key roles in the production and circulation of images in this new realm, thus becoming an influential and dominant part of twentieth century culture. (B) PHOTOGRAPHY IN EUROPE: LATE 1920S TO 193OS Founded in the late 1920s Vienna, the Schostal agency was one of the dominant agencies of that era.19 The AGO's 5,066 prints reflect the diverse subject matter, with three significant themes present in this collection: Nazi propaganda, worker photography, and fashion and portraiture. The literature in this survey discusses these themes as they relate to the photographs found in the Schostal Agency collection at the AGO. In 1933, the National Socialist Party instituted a new policy to "Aryanise" the print media of the Weimar period and turned it into what Neubauer describes as a "one-dimensional propaganda machine,"20 using it to fulfill political and social agendas. After the Nazi invasion of Vienna in 1938, the Schostal agency was "Aryanised" ­ handed over to a Nazi sympathizer ­ which allowed the Party to use the agency as a platform for their propaganda.21 Curator's, such as Dr. Simone Erpel, have noted the Nazi party's ability to shape public consciousness through their carefully monitored media outlets. Erpel, in collaboration with over 40 Berlin-based museums, memorials, associations, and initiatives dealing with Berlin's Nazi Germany past, curated a

photographic exhibition titled "Diversity destroyed: Berlin 1933 - 1938." This exhibition took place at the German Historical Museum in Berlin from January 31 to November 1, 2013, marking the 80th anniversary of the Nazi Party election in 1933. The exhibition examined how the cultural diversity of Berlin in the 1920s disappeared with Nazi censorship and repression.22 For instance, the exhibition displayed photographs taken of over 50,000 Nazis marching through the Brandenburg Gate to celebrate the appointment of Adolph Hitler as the Reich Chancellor, presenting how they were repeatedly restaged in subsequent propaganda photographs.23 The idea was to make the event seem more "splendid" each time.24 This exhibition not only underscores Berlin's need to re-examine its Nazi past, but also to learn how Nazi propaganda was used to manipulate readers. There are numerous examples of this that can be found in the Schostal collection at the AGO (see illustrations 1, 2 and 3). For example, a photograph titled "Hitler with baby" from December 1st, 1939 taken by his personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann during the celebration of Hermann Göring's 46th birthday (see illustration 1). The photograph attempts to project an intimate and personal side of Hitler as he reaches to hold a baby. The public viewing this image of Hitler puts forward an idea of a figure the public could relate to, farremoved from the reality of World War II, which began just three months prior. This exhibition provides context for the Schostal collection, with similar examples that reflect the destruction of culture in Berlin caused by Nazi terror, and the use of the agency as a propaganda tool. Matthew Witkovsky, in his book Foto: Modernity in Central Europe, 1918-194525 (2007), offers a different look at modern photography in Central Europe during the 1920s and

1930s. He focuses on photographers from Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Poland. In particular, Witkovsky draws attention to two important social movements: the new role of women, and the workers photography movement. Witkovsky argues that Central Europe's role in the evolution of modern photography is often lost and obscured by the dominant topic of Nazi oppression and fascism. Robert Lebeck and Bodo Von Dewitz's book A History of Photojournalism (Göttingen: Steidl, 2001), point to the United State's of America's role in the evolution of modernism. The authors claim that innovations in photographic publications during the modernist movement were primarily innovated in English-speaking countries.26 Witkovsky argues that the Nazi invasion in Germany in 1933, when many photographers were forced to stop working or immigrate to another country was the primary reason. For example, the Russian El Lissitzky, the Hungarian László Moholy-Nagy, and the German Hannah Höch , all well-known artists, each originally developed their photographic ideas in Germany. Witkovsky discusses how photography was "as an ideal medium to display the issues with modernism" while "also inherently being a product of modernism."27 He argues that the public discontent in the period between the two world wars, with poverty and unemployment sparked what has been termed by some as "worker photography" which "took place in Germany unlike anywhere else."28 In the book "The Worker Photography Movement 1926­1939"29 by Jorge Ribalta, Erika Wolf, and Mikhail Koltsov, curator Jorge Ribalta surveys the history of worker photography. The book discusses how this movement took place in countries such as Russia, Germany, Spain and the United States, recognizing the movement's importance in

underpinning the development of 20th century modernist photography. In an interview with Guy Lane, Ribalto explains one of the reasons why he thinks the worker photography movement (WPM) in Central Europe is ignored by photo historians: "...you have to understand that in Germany, for example, the WPM was repressed by the Nazi regime after 1933; that some photographers went into exile or to prison, and that their archives were lost or largely destroyed."30 The Schostal collection includes various examples of worker photography, however, it's not clear whether these were created while the agency was under Nazi control. Illustrations 4 and 5 highlight examples from contributing agencies such as Atlantic Photo, which includes an entire series dedicated to rural workers. This body of works demonstrates how the Schostal agency reflects the social and political movements that were happening in Central Europe. Witkovsky also discusses the new role of women in the workplace as a vivid example of modernity in central Europe. He claims that "... the sales girl, the modern typist, became clichés of this era."31 They also became consumers of fashion and thus targets for advertisers. In Monika Faber and Janos Frecot's book "Portraits of an Age: Photography in Germany and Austria,1900­ 193832 "(2005), the authors look at specific visual conventions of German and Austrian portrait photography from this 1900 to 1938. Photographic technology of the 1920s allowed for spontaneous images to be shot, developing a more natural look such as, "a turn of the head, a furtive glance, a momentary reflection in the mirror."33 Although this demonstrated a shift in portrait photography, this was not necessarily the end of classic or formal portrait photography.

For example, in the 1930s, Studio Manassé was sought after by those in search of the highly dramatic photography they were known to construct. According to Witkovsky, Studio Manassé reflected the emerging Hollywood ideals of beauty for both men and women.34 Both Witkovsky and Faber and Frecot examine Central Europe's involvement in the new ideas surrounding fashion, portraiture and advertising. A significant grouping of over 600 fashion and portrait photographs has been identified in the Schostal Agency collection at the AGO. These include prints from the Berlin based studio Becker and Maass (see illustration 6), the sought after Studio Manassé (see illustration 7), and the famous Studio Madame D'ora (see illustration 8). In essence, the ideas discussed by these authors place the Schostal Agency within a regionalized context where many innovative photographers, studios, and agencies emerged within the constraints brought upon by Nazi oppression and poverty. This oppression was juxtaposed by feelings of hope and a desire for change. The Schostal collection at the AGO reflect this period of oppression with photographs of Nazi propaganda, while also including many examples of modern portraiture and fashion photography by the innovative studios or photographers mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Literature Survey: Part II: Finding Aids and Collections Management Practices Now that an understanding of the historical context of the Schostal Press Agency collection has been established, the following literature survey was conducted to determine the best method of physically and intellectually organizing such a diverse collection. Beginning with a broad overview of collections management, the findings in this literature survey revealed the growing push towards new and innovative practices that suit the changing needs and expectations of collections managers across institutions. To begin, an overview of collections management practices both old and new will look at the responsibilities of collections managers when dealing with a large collection of historically significant works. This is followed by an analysis of finding aids specifically focused on photography collections created within the last ten years that have influenced the structure and methodological approach to creating the finding aid for the Schostal collection. (A) COLLECTIONS MANAGEMENT PRACTICES The intellectual arrangement, re-housing and creation of a finding aid for the Schostal collection at the AGO is a major project that required the examination of a variety of collections management resources. First, an understanding of archival practices must be understood, such as the accepted Canadian standard Rules for Archival Description (RAD).35 A key concept deriving in the literature is that of original order. Rules for Archival Description (RAD) define the creator of a collection as whoever has accumulated and made use of the materials, and the order imposed on the collection by the creator is the one that should be maintained.36 This definition was derived from the earlier French concept of 'respect des fond,'

and this concept has had a major influence on the methodology of archival arrangement to date.37 According to H. MacNeil in an article titled "Archivalterity: Rethinking Original Order" (2008), original order is the re-arrangement or restoring of works to the original order of their maker, and the undoing of any potential damage of previous institutions or handlers.38 MacNeil raises issues associated with this thinking in terms of how to define and what constitutes original order.39 For instance, the photographs in the Schostal collection arrived at the AGO sorted into archival boxes in loose sleeves. They were arranged primarily by theme, however some of the photographs were also separated by maker. This arrangement was possibly established by the agency itself, potentially indicating the photographs' pattern of use; the donor could also have created it. This information is nonetheless useful and should be documented and kept. However, the physical arrangement needed to be changed to fit the AGO's standard of organizing their collection by maker. This creates a tension between the art historical arrangement and archival access. One of the most comprehensive and practical guides available to collection managers is the book, Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition (2011), edited by Rebecca A. Buck and Jean Allman.40 This book provides the basic to complete essential tasks from a museum collections management perspective. For example, the author provides step-by-step instructions on how to successfully complete an inventory of a collection in order to determine the needs of your project.41 This is an essential step for beginning an organization project for any collection.

It allows you to get to know your collection, assess any potential damage and gain perspective on what your project needs. Joan M. Benedetti's book Art Museum Libraries and Librarianship (Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, UC, 2007), stresses the importance of allowing researchers and the general public to access collections while also balancing this access with security and maintenance.42 This concept of increasing both physical and intellectual access, while balancing the security of the objects is an important basis for this project. While Benedetti's book provided more insight into some of the issues and hot topics of collections management in an art museum, Museum Registration Methods provided more hands on and practical advice regarding how to see a project through from beginning to end. The value in these texts is their contribution to establishing a strong foundation in the principles, practices, and context of collections management. The next section, on finding aids, discusses the most useful resources found in developing the structure of the finding aid used for this thesis project. (B) FINDING AIDS Finding aids can take a great deal of time and thoughtful consideration to produce, as the unique intricacies of a collection are considered. The initial time investment can significantly improve the intellectual and physical access of the objects by providing researchers with a tool to navigate and handle the material quickly and efficiently. The finding aids gathered for this literature survey focus on recent material written and published between 2008 and 2012, produced specifically for press photographs created in the 20th century. This literature survey reveals that while the collections management standards discussed in the previous section must

                                                                                                                          42   Joan M. Benedetti, Art Museum Libraries and Librarianship, (Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, UC,

be taken in consideration, the overall creation of a finding aid is flexible and can be adapted to fit the needs of the specific collection and institution. One of the most relevant finding aids referenced for this project was Rebecca Streiman's thesis "The British Press Agencies Collections at the AGO" (2008).43 Similar to the Schostal Agency collection it deals with a large and diverse European press collection from the mid 1920s to late 1930s. Streiman's finding aid includes a box list, arranging the images based on the photographer or press agency to make it easy to locate prints by maker.44 As Streiman points out, an advantage of this methodological approach is to offer researchers an opportunity to examine the visual differences between different agencies that were working in the same time period.45 Cassie Lomore's thesis, on the other hand, "Finding Oceania: Organizing a Collection of Oceanic Photographs and Albums at the Art Gallery of Ontario,"46 (Ryerson, 2012) deals with a much smaller collection, enabling her to complete a thorough catalogue record of each object. In Lomore's catalogue records she consults the Getty vocabularies to ensure proper use of terminology for artist names, geographic locations and medium descriptions. Lomore also makes note of the importance of referencing Canadian standard Rules for Archival Description (RAD), but asserts that the first priority of a finding aid is to ensure that it is user-friendly.47 Both Streiman and Lomore take into account the standards used by the AGO for their photographic collections, and have therefore been a valuable resource in determining what standards are already and place, but also where there is room for flexibility.

In order to gain a broader view of how press photographs are organized in other institutions, I examined a finding aid produced by Sara L. Manco, "Finding Wolff: Intellectually Arranging the Werner Wolff Fonds at the Ryerson Image Centre," 2012.48 Both the AGO and RIC serve the public in an educational capacity, and therefore have similar needs in terms of public access. Manco's finding aid offers an archival perspective breaking the fonds into series and subseries, including descriptions of each series as outlined by the Canadian Standard Rules for Archival Description (RAD). Similar to this project, Manco's finding aid required extensive intellectual organization, arranging and describing of over 1300 files, producing a written document that explained how the fonds was organized, providing information about the photographer and his career, and finally how the objects were housed. The finding aids reviewed for this thesis all held similar intentions in terms of creating easy public access to the material, while using different rules and conventions necessary for their unique collections. The next section of this thesis will explain the application of the research conducted in these two literature surveys. It will include an outline of the physical housing strategy, and finish with a detailed description of the creation of the finding aid. In order to understand the process of re-housing and creating a finding aid for the Schostal agency collection at the AGO, a description of how the collection was originally organized, as well as its wider contextual history, will demonstrate where this project began, and the direction that followed.

Description of the Schostal Agency Collection at the AGO Through correspondence with the Deutsches Historisches Museum (DHM), two sources written specifically about the Schostal Agency were obtained: Milena Grief's article "Agentur Schostal: Mit den Fotos Kehrt die Erinnerung zurück., published in Rundbrief Fotografie 9, no. 2 on June 2002.49 As well as a brief mention of the founders of the Schostal Agency, Robert and Walter Schostal, in Timm Starl's book Lexikon zur Fotografie in Österreich 1839 bis 1945, published by the University of Michigan in 2005. 50 All historical information in this section is drawn from these two articles unless otherwise noted. Robert Schostal was born in Vienna in 1906. There, he learned about photography in his post-secondary studies.51 His interest was most likely influenced by his family, a family that was well immersed in the growing field. Robert's aunt, Regine Mattersdorf, owned the company Magazin Metropol in Vienna.52 From her shop, which was located in the vicinity of St. Michael's Square (Michaelerplatz, Vienna), she sold postcards and photographs of well-known singers and actors to fans, collectors, and magazines. Robert's father, Oscar Schostal, financed the company.53 When his aunt could no longer handle the high demand of orders, she suggested that Robert Schostal and her son take charge of the distribution of photographs. In 1925, "Vienna Photo Kurier" was launched. Robert's father, Oscar Schostal, continued to manage the financing, and Mattersdorf continued to assist by helping them create relationships with many of the Austrian photo studios.54 Robert soon became the sole owner of the company, and by the late

1920s he founded the Schostal Agency. His brother Walter Schostal later joined him. They set up their head office at Starhemberggasse 26, in the fourth district of Vienna.55 It was at this time, in the late 1920s, that the Schostal Press Agency became the exclusive Austrian distributor of photographs for the Keystone Press Agency (based in New York). They were given a fixed monthly fee to distribute Keystone photos in Paris, London, and Berlin. It was this fixed income that allowed the brothers to keep their business afloat, and by 1933 they were able to expand their base. Walter and his wife moved to Paris and set up a branch office there. Soon after, they established branches in Berlin, Milan, and Stockholm.56 The Schostal Agency thrived from 1934 to 1938, employing up to ten people in its Vienna headquarters, and boasting an inventory of over one million photographs depicting events and daily life both locally and globally. They supplied several European magazines such as Moderne Welt, Die Buehne, Wiener Salon Blatt, and Wiener Magazine, and distributed photographs in a wide range of topics such as world events, fashion and glamour.57 A particular focus on advertising and fashion photography can be seen in the Schostal collection at the AGO, including photographs by well-known studios such as Becker and Maass (active in Berlin 1942 1945), and photographers such as Trude Fleischmann (1895 - 1990), Madame d'Ora (Dora Kallmus) (1881 - 1963), and Yva, aka Else Neuländer-Simon (1900-1942).58 In March 1938 German troops invaded Austria. That month Robert Schostal attempted to flee the country and join his brother in Paris, leaving behind the Schostal Agency's archive of photographs. He was arrested out of a train in Klagenfurt after an unknown employee had reported him. Thanks to the negotiations made with Studio Madame d'Ora, Robert was released,

and the studio paid for a visa for him and his mother to come to France. Soon after, he traveled to the United States. After Robert fled the country, Walter Schostal asked all of the agency's customers outside of Germany and Austria to transfer any outstanding invoices to Paris instead of Vienna. After France's declaration of war in 1939, the Paris branch had to close. In the late summer of 1941 Walter Schostal along with his wife and children managed to immigrate to America, reuniting with the entire Schostal family in New York.59 In June of 1938, the Vienna branch was handed over to an "Aryan" director named Friedrich Gondosch.60 Gondosch had been living in Vienna since 1935 working as an engineer.61 He appears to have also worked as a photographer, as some of the photographs in the Schostal collection are credited to him. After he became the head of the Schostal Agency, the National Socialist Party used him as a contact for producing and distributing propaganda press photographs for the Nazi party. The agency was re-named Wien-Bild with the addition of "P.P.P. Fotos für Presse und Propaganda: vormais Agentur Schostal"62 (Photographs for Press and Propaganda: formally Schostal Agency). In the post-war period, the agency did not produce many images; the last few photographs were produced in 1948, the year the operation closed. In New York, the Schostal brothers founded a new picture agency called Shostal Inc., and later Shostal Associates. Around 1947 Robert attempted to recover the photos with the assistance of a lawyer in Vienna. The photographs were hidden in Vienna in an unknown location. Unfortunately they did not succeed

in reclaiming their photographs. Walter died in 1975 in New York, and 28 years later, Robert died on July 3, 2003 in Charlottesville, Virginia.63 In 1992 approximately 130,000 photographs from the Schostal agency were discovered by a Swiss art dealer in the basement of an apartment in the ninth district of Vienna. In 1995 the German Historical Museum bought 40,000 photos to build their contemporary collection on the history of Berlin. The Hamburg Museum of Arts and Crafts bought 350 fashion photographs. The Austrian publisher Christian Brandstätter now owns the majority of the prints from IMAGNO picture agency.64 A portion of this collection was anonymously donated to the AGO in 2008, comprised of 5,066 gelatin silver prints, 58 information sheets and 34 photograph envelopes dating 1927 to 1945. There are three press agencies that contributed to this collection: The Associated Press, Atlantic Photo, and Keystone Press. At the time of donation, the donor identified 48 photographers.65 Through a visual examination of the collection 407 contributors have been identified. Some of the photographers that the agency directly worked with are: Becker & Maass, a studio from Berlin that was active between 1902 and 1945: photographer's Dainko, Anton Doliwa (1905-1954), Karel Hajek (1900-1978), Alois Sedlar, Wilhelm Sturm (1915-1980), and Eva Tropper.66 The next section of this paper will discuss the methodological approaches taken to intellectually and physically organize this collection.

Organization and Housing Strategy When the Schostal collection was anonymously donated to the AGO in 2008, the donor provided the following information on an excel spreadsheet: an identification number given by the donor labeled on the front and back of each sleeve which helped to identify the two prints it contained, a descriptive title based on the prints subject matter, medium, dates, condition, some of the photographer's names, agency's name and some brief notes for certain prints. The contents of each box and its location were not easily identifiable, as each print had not yet been labeled with its AGO accession number. These accession numbers had already been generated upon acquisition but the work had not been started to physically assign these numbers to the prints, and input them on the AGO's database: The Museum System (TMS). Therefore, the location of the prints were not traceable on any document accept the excel spreadsheets provided by the donor which were not accessible to researchers. The creation of a finding aid and physical rehousing project for this collection was a necessary project and will benefit future users of this collection. (A) Identification: In the initial organization of the collection created by the donor, the only way to look up a specific photograph on the research database was to input the descriptive title and reference the ID number given by the donor. The issue with this method is some of the titles were identical, and some of the ID numbers were repeated throughout the collection. The method that was in place would require an inconvenient number of steps on the part of the researcher in order to locate the prints they were looking for. Therefore, a tremendous aspect of the physical process associated with this project was in identifying each print and matching it with its corresponding AGO accession number. After meeting with Olga Zotova, Collections Database Co-ordinator at

21     

the AGO, a time efficient method was developed to identify each print based on its descriptive title, and searching for its TMS record. This involved the following steps: 1. First, it was necessary to input the descriptive title of each photograph onto the TMS search system in order to locate each record: 2. Next, the alternative number given by the donor, which had been input on TMS needed to be verified with the original numbers provided on the donors spreadsheet; and finally 3. Each print in the collection needed to be physically located to make sure the information was correct. This was one of the most time-consuming parts of this project, but one that has incredibly improved the ability for researchers to quickly locate the prints in this collection. In conjunction with the identification process, object packages were created in TMS. An object package is a term used in TMS referring to a list of objects created by the user. This list identified the contents of each box in the order given by the donor. These packages were submitted to Olga Zotova, Collections Database Co-ordinator at the AGO. This allowed her to update the temporary ID numbers currently on TMS. After the prints had been identified, they could now be separated into an individual sleeve, inscribe in its AGO accession number on the physical print itself in pencil, and insert a standard AGO accession label. (B) Physical Arrangement: When the Schostal collection arrived at the AGO, it was arranged by the donor, either by agency, photographer, or theme. The collection included works that can be attributed to three other press agencies from this time period: Atlantic Photo, Associated Press, and Keystone Press. This order was not consistent with the AGO's established organization system: arrangement by maker. Taking into consideration that the creators of this collection are no longer alive, the agency is no longer running, and that it was no longer possible to discern something of an

22     

original order, an imposed order was determined to be the best way to make the material accessible. After visually assessing the collection, several sources were primarily consulted to determine the best method of organizing the collection. Sara Manco's thesis "Finding Wolff: Intellectually Arranging the Werner Wolff Fonds at the Ryerson Image Centre," (2012) applied the Canadian Standard of Rules for Archival Description (RAD).67 Cassie Lomore's thesis "Finding Oceania: Organizing a Collection of Oceanic Photographs and Albums at the Art Gallery of Ontario,"68 (Ryerson, 2012) also stressed the importance of applying Canadian standard Rules for Archival Description, but to make sure the end results in a user-friendly document. Lomore organized her finding aid either by thematic groupings or a single maker. Rebecca Streiman's thesis "The British Press Agencies Collections at the AGO" (2008), was the most similar to Schostal collection, dealing with the arrangement and description of European press photographs.69 While taking into account archival standards to determine what information should be included in the finding aid, Steiman's method of organizing the collection by maker was adapted to suit the specific needs of the Schostal collection. This resulted in the physical arrangement first by agency and then by photographer. If there were no maker, it would be arranged by date. This is consistent with the way the AGO currently organizes their photography collection. See below for breakdown of original arrangement: 1. Agencies: Schostal Agency Archive, Associated Press, Atlantic, Keystone 2. Studio(s): Becker and Maass

3. Photographer(s): Dainko, Doliwa, Hajek, Sedlar, Tropper, and General Photographers 4. Subject Matter: General Photographers, Fashion, Series boxes, Nudes, World Leaders, and Sample box As demonstrated in the box list above, the original arrangement of the prints in the collection was not consistent, making it difficult for users to quickly reference material. The collection is now arranged alphabetically by maker: Associated Press, Atlantic, Keystone, Schostal. There is also an array of various other press agencies that make up a small percentage; the collection is arranged first by agency, and then arranged alphabetically within the boxes by photographer. If the photographer is unknown it is arranged by date. Object packages on TMS were created in order to document the original order that the collection arrived at the AGO. Other object packages were created to document the new order and also create the ability to print off box lists for each box, in the new order by maker. See below for new organization method, arranged alphabetically in forty archival boxes, first by agency, and then by photographer or studio: Boxes 1 - 3: Associated Press (332 gelatin silver prints) Boxes 4 - 23: Atlantic Photo, Photographers (2638 gelatin silver prints, 50 information sheets) Box 24: Keystone (92 gelatin silver prints, 1 information sheet) Boxes 25 - 27: Schostal, Becker and Maass (315 gelatin silver prints) Boxes 28 - 40: Schostal, Photographers (1,678 gelatin silver prints, 7 information sheets) Box 40: Schostal, Miscellaneous Agencies (11 gelatin silver prints) This new arrangement allows researchers to quickly access material related to a specific agency, studio or photographer. It also accounts for the 58 information sheets that were originally housed in the same sleeves but given no form of identification.

24     

Creation of the Finding Aid After careful consideration of various collections management practices, an appropriate structure for the finding aid was created. The finding aid provides researchers with the following advantage: location of photographs organized by maker and then date; lists to locate both general and specific subject matter; historical and contextual information. Also, each box contains a box list in the order of its organization that includes a descriptive title of each photograph. This allows researchers to locate specific subject matter, while also making it easier to keep organized for future users. The finding aid includes the following seven sections. The first three are standard, administrative components providing an overview of the collection. 1. Descriptive Summary: Includes a basic description of the overall collection including dates, accession number, creator, description, and language of the collection material. 2. Administrative Information: This includes access and contact information of other institutions with parts of the collection. 3.

6. Summary Box List: The summary box list offers a breakdown of all of the photographers, dates, and subject details for the collection as a whole. 7. Bibliography

One of the issues encountered in this process of organizing this collection was the discovery of 58 information sheets and 34 photograph envelopes that were grouped with a series of photographs. The information on these sheets offered a detailed description of what the photographer was capturing at a particular event. These sheets, made with non-archival material often with adhesive, were stored in the same sleeve as the first photograph in the given series. The initial proposal was to separate these information sheets and put them in their own box. The finding aid as well as The Museum System (TMS) could be used to link these sheets to their original photographs. After discussing the issue with Olga Zotova, Collections Database Coordinator at the AGO, and Sophie Hackett, Associate Curator, Photography at the AGO, new plans was decided upon where the information sheets would be separated and placed into their own archival sleeve, but remain with the photographs in the series. This would also be noted in the finding aid, as well as linked in TMS. This method proved to be the best as it creates a faster method for researchers to gather information about the photographs from this series without having to examine two separate boxes. Object packages containing the order in which they were received are available in TMS at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Another major component of this project was describing the subject matter contained in each box. This process began upon the initial inventory of the collection, where a general assessment of basic subject matter was determined. The information uncovered in the initial inventory allowed the ability to create a list of general subject terms for each print, using the

26     

Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus as an authority. This vocabulary was chosen because of its common use and compatibility with TMS, used at the AGO. The original intention was to use the information on the back of each print to gather information about the subject matter of each photograph. However, the text on each photograph is for the most part in German and would require a great deal of time and effort to translate, something that is beyond the scope of this thesis project. Instead, a visual assessment of the photograph along with the descriptive information that was already given by the donor allowed the creation of general groupings that will greatly improve a researcher's ability to quickly access certain subject matter. These terms have been entered into the subject terms field in each photograph's TMS record.

27     

Conclusion The Schostal Press Agency collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario is one that is full of diversity, character, and mystery to be explored. This finding aid is simply a starting point, with an organizational structure meant to create efficient access to the collection and the information researchers seek. The re-housing of each photograph into its own sleeve, in a straightforward and clear systematic order by maker, makes each print easy to both access and handle. The goal is to encourage intellectual study of the Schostal agency. The overall intention of this finding aid is to serve future researchers in gaining knowledge about an agency whose place in the history of photography still has many questions to be answered. Future projects could include the translation of text on the reverse side of each print, resulting in a more detailed description of the subject matter in each box. Also, the WWII period and Aryanization of the Schostal agency could lead to an interesting investigation of the Nazi press and propaganda. Without a doubt, the time and effort put into organizing this collection will prove to be a useful tool for future researchers. A copy of this finding aid will be kept with the collection as well as be available online through the AGO's web site in the section dedicated to the Photography collection.

Scope and Content The Schostal Agency collection is comprised of 5,066 gelatin silver prints, 58 information sheets and 34 photograph envelopes dating 1927­1945. Other agencies that contributed to this collection are: Associated Press, Atlantic Photo, and Keystone Press agency. There are over 400 Atlantic photographers and 31 Schostal Agency photographers identified by the information on the reverse of each print. Finally, a group of 11 miscellaneous agencies completes this diverse collection. The biography section of this finding aid lists the 31 Schostal photographers and studios and 14 press agencies and companies that also supplied photographs to the agency. Arrangement: The collection is organized alphabetically by maker: first by agency, then arranged within the agency boxes by individual photographers or studios. For photographs for which an attribution to an individual photographer or studio could not be made, they were arranged by date. Each photograph is housed in a sleeve with a label that includes its AGO accession number, maker, title, and barcode. There are also 58 information sheets and 34 photograph envelopes that indicate a series number. The photographs connected to each series are arranged with their corresponding information sheets and/or photograph envelopes: Keystone with 1 information sheet, Atlantic with 50 information sheets and 29 photograph envelopes, and Schostal with 7 information sheets and 5 photograph envelopes. Description: In the original arrangement, many of these photographs were organized in boxes by subject matter: historical figures, nudes, and fashion. Object packages have been created in the AGO's collections management system, The Museum System (TMS) to preserve a record of the order in which the photographs were found when they arrived at the AGO. Subject keyword terms have been assigned to each photograph, using the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus. These have also been input into each photograph's TMS record. A list of subject terms pertinent to each box is listed at the end of each box list.

History of the Schostal Agency Robert Schostal was born in Vienna in 1906. There, he learned about photography in his post-secondary studies. His interest was most likely influenced by his family, a family that was well immersed in the growing field. Robert's aunt, Regine Mattersdorf, owned the company Magazin Metropol in Vienna. From her shop, which was located in the vicinity of St. Michael's Square (Michaelerplatz, Vienna), she sold postcards and photographs of well-known singers and actors to fans, collectors, and magazines. Robert's father, Oscar Schostal, financed the company. When his aunt could no longer handle the high demand of orders, she suggested that Robert Schostal and her son take charge of the distribution of photographs. In 1925, "Vienna Photo Kurier" was launched. Robert's father, Oscar Schostal, continued to manage the financing, and Mattersdorf continued to assist by helping them create relationships with many of the Austrian photo studios. Robert soon became the sole owner of the company, and by the late 1920s he founded the Schostal Agency. His brother Walter Schostal later joined him. They set up their head office at Starhemberggasse 26, in the fourth district of Vienna. It was at this time, in the late 1920s, that the Schostal Press Agency became the exclusive Austrian distributor of photographs for the Keystone Press Agency (based in New York). They were given a fixed monthly fee to distribute Keystone photos in Paris, London, and Berlin. It was this fixed income that allowed the brothers to keep their business afloat, and by 1933 were able to expand their base. Walter and his wife moved to Paris and set up a branch office there. Soon after, they established branches in Berlin, Milan, and Stockholm. The Schostal Agency thrived from 1934 to 1938, employing up to ten people in its Vienna headquarters, and boasting an inventory of over one million photographs depicting events and daily life both locally and globally. They supplied several European magazines such as Moderne Welt, Die Buehne, Wiener Salon Blatt, and Wiener Magazine, and distributed photographs in a wide range of topics such as world events, fashion and glamour. A particular focus on advertising and fashion photography can be seen in the Schostal collection at the AGO, including photographs by well-known studios such as Becker and Maass (active in Berlin 1942 - 1945), and photographers such as Trude Fleischmann (1895 - 1990), Madame d'Ora (Dora Kallmus) (1881 - 1963), and Yva, aka Else Neuländer-Simon (1900-1942). In March 1938 German troops invaded Austria. That month Robert Schostal attempted to flee the country and join his brother in Paris, leaving behind the Schostal Agency's archive of photographs. He was arrested out of a train in Klagenfurt after an unknown employee had reported him. Thanks to the negotiations made with Studio Madame d'Ora, Robert was released, and the studio paid for a visa for him and his mother to come to France. Soon after, he traveled to the United States. After Robert fled the country, Walter Schostal asked all of the agency's customers outside of Germany and Austria to transfer any outstanding invoices to Paris instead of Vienna. Apparently no one at the head office in Vienna noticed. After France's declaration of war in 1939, the Paris branch had to close. In the late summer of 1941 Walter Schostal along with his wife and children managed to immigrate to America, reuniting with the entire Schostal family in New York. In June of 1938, the Vienna branch was handed over to an "Aryan" director named Friedrich Gondosch. Gondosch had been living in Vienna since 1935 working as an engineer. He appears to have also worked as a photographer as some of the photographs in the Schostal collection are credited to him. After he became the head of the Schostal Agency, the National    44  

  

Socialist Party used him as a contact for producing and distributing propaganda press photographs for the Nazi party. The agency was re-named Wien-Bild with the addition of "P.P.P. Fotos für Presse und Propaganda: vormais Agentur Schostal" (Photographs for Press and Propaganda: formally Schostal Agency). In the post-war period, the agency did not produce many images; last few photographs were produced in 1948, the year the operation closed. In New York, the Schostal brothers founded a new picture agency called Shostal Inc., and later Shostal Associates. Around 1947 Robert attempted to recover the photos with the assistance of a lawyer in Vienna. The photographs were hidden in Vienna in an unknown location. Unfortunately they did not succeed in reclaiming their photographs. Walter died in 1975 in New York, and 28 years later, Robert died on July 3, 2003 in Charlottesville, Virginia. In 1992 approximately 130,000 photographs from the Schostal agency were discovered by a Swiss art dealer in the basement of an apartment in the ninth district of Vienna. In 1995 the German Historical Museum bought 40,000 photos to build their contemporary collection on the history of Berlin. The Hamburg Museum of Arts and Crafts bought 350 fashion photographs. The Austrian publisher Christian Brandstätter now owns the majority of the prints from IMAGNO picture agency. A portion of this collection was anonymously donated to the AGO in 2008, comprised of 5,066 gelatin silver prints, 58 information sheets and 34 photograph envelopes dating 1927 to 1944. There are three press agencies that contributed to this collection: The Associated Press, Atlantic Photo, and Keystone Press. At the time of donation, the donor identified 48 photographers. Through my examination of the collection I have been able to identify 407 contributors overall. Some of the photographers that the agency directly worked with are: Becker & Maass, a studio from Berlin that was active between 1902 and 1945: photographer's Dainko, Anton Doliwa (1905-1954), Karel Hajek (1900-1978), Alois Sedlar, Wilhelm Sturm (19151980), and Eva Tropper. The next section of this paper will discuss the methodological approaches taken to intellectually and physically organize this collection.

Historical Sketches and Biographical Information The historical sketches and biographical information in this section list the agencies and photographers that contributed to this collection. The photographers highlighted are ones that were credited by the Schostal Agency, identified by the information on the reverse of each print. There are over four hundred photographers that were credited by the Atlantic Photo. In most cases, so little is known about these photographers that they were not included in the biography section. This list of little-known makers can be found in alphabetical order in the box list for Atlantic Photo (on pages 18-32). Numerous sources were used to compile these biographies and can be referenced in the bibliography. Each contributor was assigned a constituent record in the AGO's TMS database, and each constituent ID number is listed to the right of their name. PRESS AGENCIES A.B. Text & Bilder (Constituent ID: 17834) German, est. 20th century A.G Daimler Puch (Constituent ID: 17835) Austrian, 1864 - 1940s Also known as "Steyr-Daimler Puch," a manufacturing company based in Steyr, Austria. Founded in 1864, it was originally known as Josef und Franz Werndl. Their products included transportation vehicles and weapons. In 1924 the company changed its name to Steyr-Werke AG, and in 1934 merged with Austro-Daimler-Puch and formed Steyr-Daimler Puch. During World War II, the company was one of the first to suggest the use of slave labour from concentration camps. This was approved and prisoners were brought for facility construction, and manufacturing labour. Other German companies such as Mercedes-Benz and MAN did the same. Between 1987 and 2001 parts of the company were sold and continue to operate under different ownership and new names. Associated Press (Constituent ID: 6369) American, 1846 Established in New York in 1846 by an organization of newspaper publishers led by Moses Yale Beach, the Associated Press is the world's largest 24-hour news agency. In 1931 it expanded internationally: the Associated Press GmbH in Berlin and Associated Press Ltd. in London. Over the years the agency has continued to change with the times, incorporating new technology such as online social media platforms and new communication devices such as the iPhone, targeting a new generation of readers, maintaining a reputation of high standard.

Atlantic Photo (Constituent ID: 6683) German, 1919 Atlantic Photo was founded in 1919 Berlin by the German photographer Heinrich Sanden (b. 1877). Central Press Photos (Constituent ID: 7012) British, est. 20th century CTK (Constituent ID: 7239) Czech, est. 1918 This news agency was founded on October 18, 1918. From 1920 to 1930 the CTK signed contracts with the world's largest agencies: Reuter, Havas and Wolff. It also participated in the organization of the first European news agency (Agences Alliées). In 1925 they formed a radio broadcast studio in the CTK building. In September 1930, the agency moved into a new building in Prague. After the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in March 1939, the agency was split in two, one remaining independent and the other occupied by the Nazis during WWII from 1939 to 1945. In 1942, the agency's editor Zdenk Schmoranz along with other editors was executed. During the liberation of Czechoslovakia in May 1945, a fire broke out in the CTK building, burning down their archives. From 1948 to 1989 the agency was under the control of the Communist dictatorship and became an instrument of political propaganda for the ruling party. After 1989 the agency separated from the state and formed a public institution with no specific owner, subject to the control of the CTK council, whose seven members are elected by the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Parliament. Globe Photos (Constituent ID: 6453) American, est. 20th century This international agency was based in New York City. Keystone (Constituent ID: 4239) American, 1886 - 1978 Founded by Benneville Lloyd Singley in 1886 Southern Pennsylvania. This press agency was formed shortly after Singley photographed the flood damage in Meadville, selling the prints. It expanded to open offices in the United States, Canada, and London. The company became known for press photography, as well as their stereographs and lanternslides geared to educational purposes. The company's records and inventory of negatives was acquired by The California Museum of Photography in 1978 and is now known as the Keystone-Mast Collection. Mercedes-Benz (Constituent ID: 7210) German, 20th century Nova-Press (Constituent ID: 6392) est. 20th century P.K. Bild (Constituent ID: 17836) German, 20th century    47  

  

Schostal (Constituent ID: 7173) Austrian, 1928 to 1948 (See History of the Schostal Agency section on pages 5 - 6 for full biography) Sport & General Press Agency (Constituent ID: 7398) British, est. 20th century Located on Fleet Street in London, many of this press agency's archives were destroyed by a fire in Gough Square in a 1941 German bombing raid. Sport-Press Foto (Constituent ID: 6940) German, est. 20th century Underwood & Underwood (Constituent ID: 7931) American, 1880 - 1940s Founded in 1880 in Ottawa, Kansas by brothers Elmer and Bert Underwood. Business quickly expanded, opening up branches in Canada and England. The brothers began with door to door sales of stereographs, and soon became the exclusive agency for three prominent stereographic publishers. In 1891 they opened up a headquarters in New York City and the agency began to make their own stereographs. In 1896 they began selling news photos to newspapers and magazines and by 1904 established a sales agency. The company produced between 30,000 and 40,000 stereographic views. In 1920 stereograph production was discontinued, and the agency sold its rights and stock to the Keystone View Company. Little else is known about the company, and it closed down in the 1940s. PHOTOGRAPHERS Becker and Maass (Constituent ID: 7778) German, 1902­1945 Founded in by Heinrich Maass in Berlin in 1902. Becker and Maass was a prolific twentieth century fashion and portrait studio.

Doliwa, Anton (Constituent ID: 17829) Austrian, 1905 - 1954? Born in Austria 1905, Doliwa worked in press photography, mainly as a sports photographer. After the Nazi take-over of Austria in 1938, he continued to work in the field under regime change. Fleischmann, Trude (Constituent ID: 16292) Austrian, 1895 - 1990 Trude Fleishmann was born in Vienna in 1885. She studied painting in Paris at the age of eighteen, but soon returned to Vienna to become a photographer's apprentice. In 1920 she opened her own portrait studio where she photographed local socialites such as writers, painters, and musicians. In 1939, escaping the Holocaust, Fleishmann fled the country to the United States. She became a portrait photographer in New York, and in 1960 she settled in Lugano, Switzerland for the remainder of her days. Gase (Constituent ID: 17806) 20th century Gondosch, Friedrich (Constituent ID: 17832) Austrian, 20th century Since 1935 Gondosch had been working as an engineer in Austria. After the Naziinvasion of Austria in 1938, Gondosch made close relations with Nazi officials of the Reichspressekammer. This allowed him to take possession of the Schostal press agency shortly after the invasion. The Nazi party sought to "aryanize" the press agency and Gondosch allowed them to use it for propaganda. The agency stopped running around the late 1940s and the Schostal archive was hidden in a basement. No information regarding what happened to Gondosch is known.

Arthur Benda, a professional photographer, came with her to Vienna to become the studio manager. Inspired by art photography, Kallmus developed a new style of portraiture through carefully styled drapery and lighting, to emphasize her sitter's personality. The Studio Madame d'Ora was a financial success, photographing designs for the emerging medium of illustrated magazines as early as 1910. Her studio was one of the first in Vienna to be run by a woman She employed other notable female photographers such as Trude Fleishmann. Branches expanded in Paris, France, but after the German occupation she was forced to flee. Fortunately she was able to reclaim her business after World War II. Matei, L.

Yva (Else Neuländer-Simon) (Constituent ID: 17823) German, 1900-1942? Else Neulander-Simon studied photography at the Lette-Verein school for women in Berlin. She established her own studio, "Yva," in 1925, serving illustrated magazines and newspapers. Her photography included portraits, nudes, advertising, and fashion and would often create a montage by using multiple exposures. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, her Jewish heritage made it difficult to work. She married Alfred Simon in 1934 who took over the management of her studio. In 1936 she was forced to "aryanize" her studio, transferring ownership to a friend named Charlotte Weidler. Her friends encouraged her to the leave the country, but she was forced to work as an x-ray technician in a Jewish hospital before she and her husband were deported around 1940 to 1941 to a concentration camp where Yva died around 1942.
