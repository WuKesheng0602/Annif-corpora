Private Collection & Public Exhibition: The Art Gallery of Ontario's Responding to Photography Anne Kavanagh Master of Arts, 2014 Photographic Preservation and Collections Management Ryerson University This paper is a detailed description and analysis of the Art Gallery of Ontario's 1984 exhibition Responding to Photography: Selected Works from Private Toronto Collections. One of the first original photography exhibitions organized by the gallery and Maia-Mari Sutnik, the 156 works were drawn entirely from private Toronto collections. The exhibition would come to shape the collecting policy of the photography collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario and set it apart from other institutions across Canada. The selected works represented a generalist collecting philosophy (influenced by Sam Wagstaff) that included photographs by anonymous makers and those made for purposes other than art. Through an analysis of the institution's historical relationship with photography as well as the context in which the show was developed, this paper proposes that Sutnik's exhibition is a significant historic marker and indicative of the status of photography in Toronto during the 1980s, a time of increased international prominence for the medium.

Chapter 1. Introduction
The City of Toronto currently maintains an excellent international reputation for its support of the photographic medium. Exhibitions of photography are held year round at multiple institutions including the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), the Ryerson Image Centre (RIC) and the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art (MOCCA). Commercial dealers also present engaging exhibitions, with the work of dealers Stephen Bulger, Jane Corkin, Daniel Faria, Georgia Scherman, Olga Korper, and Donald O'Born being particularly significant. Ryerson University, OCAD University, and others are graduating classes of accomplished photographers, and the RIC also seeks to promote scholarship of the medium through research fellowships and symposia. The CONTACT photography festival held annually in May, the Aimia | AGO Photography Prize (formerly the Grange Prize), and the Scotiabank Photography Award have driven financial and institutional support of the medium, and photographers and collectors have expressed excitement at what the future holds for photography in Toronto.1 Historically, however, Toronto has not been a very conducive place for the production, collection and display of photography. The Art Gallery of Ontario in particular, has had a tenuous historical relationship with photography as an art form. Despite mounting exhibitions of the medium as early as 1917, the AGO2 resisted the establishment of a photography department until 2000.3 Although the AGO currently houses one of the largest and strongest collections of photography in Canada with close to 60,000 works, it is only since 2000 that the department has experienced unprecedented growth. The collection was begun in the 1970s under the guidance

of Maia-Mari Sutnik, who worked from the 1960s onward to increase recognition for photography at the gallery. Without the pioneering work of Sutnik, the AGO would not have the high-calibre photography collection it has today. As the largest art institution in Toronto, the AGO's history reflects more broadly the lack of institutional support for photography, not just in Toronto, but also in other parts of Canada before the 1990s. In 1984, Sutnik, then Co-ordinator of Photographic Resources at the Art Gallery of Ontario, organized the exhibition Responding to Photography: Selected Works from Private Toronto Collections. Although the gallery had hosted travelling exhibitions of photography for many years, this was one of the first exhibitions to be organized by the gallery. Sutnik was primarily interested in displaying the wide variety of works that had been collected locally and sought out a number of private individuals who collected photographs in a variety of genres, media and from different periods. The idea of an exhibition consisting solely of privately owned works was not unique at that time; other media had been featured in comparable shows before Responding to Photography. Indeed, exhibiting work borrowed from private collectors has been a standard practice in art institutions for decades as a way of exhibiting works not normally available to the public, although this has not always been advertised to viewers. Lenders are often receptive to exhibiting their work as a way of increasing its value, and, as noted in the press release, "Private collectors often find their audience restricted to friends and colleagues; thus they are eager to share what they have appreciated."4 Responding to Photography is significant as marking one of the first exhibitions of its type for photography in Toronto. It also reveals Sutnik's strategy for developing the collection, as she was working without an established collection or an acquisitions budget at the time. By connecting with (and flattering) various photography collectors in Toronto, Sutnik

hoped to establish a relationship with the lenders that could lead to future donations and displays of works that would otherwise be unavailable to her.5 The exhibition's primary thesis suggested equal treatment of works both by photographers belonging to the traditional canon of master photographers and those who did not, or were anonymous, as well as of works from a wide variety of nations. An exhibition containing anonymous photographs had never been held at the AGO before and it encouraged audiences to look at photography in an entirely new way. The exhibition was representative of Sutnik's own collecting philosophy, influenced by her mentor and personal hero, Sam Wagstaff. A significant collector of photography, Wagstaff was noted as a "generalist" who collected works by both known and unknown photographers. Explaining his collecting philosophy, Wagstaff said: I'm a collector of extraordinary photography, whether by `names' or not. I'm interested in the world revealed in a photograph and what lies behind and beyond that world, both in the mind of the photographer and in the unconscious surrealism that is probably photography's most characteristic quality.6 The public exposure of Wagstaff's collection through a circulating exhibition, Photographs from the Collection of Samuel J. Wagstaff,7 and accompanying catalogue, A Book of Photographs from the Collection of Sam Wagstaff, published in 1978, had a remarkable impact on the photographic community in North America, including Toronto; Sutnik had been responsible for bringing it to the AGO in 1981. Wagstaff affirmed that works of all types made by a variety of photographers were worthy of collecting, regardless of whether they had a place in the canon of "master" photographic works. At that time, the standard source listing these master photographers was Beaumont

Newhall's The History of Photography: From 1839 to the Present, originally published in 1937, with the fifth edition published in 1982.8 Sutnik found Wagstaff's collection exhilarating and his philosophy liberating. She notes, "I think with Sam I came to the realization that photography is a form of expression that goes beyond... the self-proclaimed artist; that it's in the hands of everybody."9 Setting out to discover what was in the community, she indeed found that there were collectors of every type of subject matter and photographer, from the iconic to the obscure. By selecting and displaying an eclectic collection in a significant public art gallery, Sutnik was giving institutional approval to photography and legitimating the eclectic tastes of the collectors. In addition, she hoped to inspire others to find photography worthy of collecting.
What can Responding to Photography tell us about the status and treatment of photography in Toronto around the time of the exhibition? Furthermore, how did Toronto and the AGO specifically "respond" to photography? The exhibition occurred at a time of growing recognition for the

photographic medium indicated by rising prices for photographs on the art market, the establishment of photographic curricula at colleges and universities, and curatorial departments dedicated to photography in art museums. Responding to Photography can therefore suggest answers to these questions. In this exhibition, Sutnik worked to demonstrate how collectors of photography were responding to the medium, while the history of the exhibition and its aftermath indicate how the AGO, and audiences in Toronto, responded. The exhibition had a significant impact on the photographic community and enhanced the reputations of the AGO and Sutnik in the eyes of photographers, dealers and collectors. Today, when photography is generating great excitement in Toronto audiences, it is important to recall how the medium was slow to be accepted as a legitimate art form by art institutions and how Sutnik's work to "keep

Chapter 2. Literature Review
Responding to Photography: Selected Works from Private Toronto Collections is not specifically addressed in academic literature, as research on photography in Toronto and scholarship on AGO photography exhibitions have largely been neglected. However, the issues of public exhibitions and private collections of photography have been taken up separately by a number of scholars. As this review will indicate, texts on public exhibitions of private collections are rare. Included in this review are sources that inspired Sutnik, as well as her photographic catalogues and literature relating to the appreciation of photography in Canada.

Photography and the Museum The collecting and exhibiting of photography in an art museum environment have been debated since the medium's inception, and Toronto's resistance to photography provides an illustration of this. While early critics ruled that photography did not belong in the museum at all because it was not Fine Art, later academic texts evaluated the effect that photography has had on the discursive space of the museum. AndrÃ© Malraux theorized that photography would eliminate the need for the museum in his text, The Museum Without Walls, translated in 1967,11 responding to Walter Benjamin's suggestion that the mechanical reproduction of works of art would eliminate the aura of the original, allowing the photograph to stand in its place.12 Following Benjamin and Malraux, Douglas Crimp suggested in the essay "Appropriating Appropriation," that because photography points to a world beyond the museum and rigid definitions of art, its inclusion in the museum rejects the autonomy of art and the discourse of the

museum is subject to ruin.13 This is not a phenomenon unique to photography, as Crimp suggests that heterogeneous work such as Robert Rauschenberg's silkscreens and hybridpaintings had a similar destabilizing effect on the museum space.14 Several of Crimp's essays, written between 1980 and 1987, were originally published in October magazine where he worked as an editor, and which was a significant journal for theorists to write about the photographic medium. Also published in October in 1982, was Christopher Phillips's essay, "The Judgment Seat of Photography," where he argued that the revolutionizing effect that photography was predicted to have on the museum had failed to happen. He wrote, "[p]hotography, the medium believed by Benjamin to have effectively overthrown the `judgment seat' of traditional art has in turn been subjected to the transfiguring gaze of art's institutional guardian: the museum."15 In the same year, Rosalind Krauss, co-founder of October, discussed the different discourses of the Timothy O'Sullivan photograph Tufa Domes, Pyramid Lake, Nevada and its lithographic reproduction in her essay, "Photography's Discursive Spaces: Landscape/View."16 Using the O'Sullivan works and the oeuvre of EugÃ¨ne Atget, Krauss examined the expansive discourses of photography and the photographic archive, and the inherent problem in removing context by placing photographs on the wall of a museum. These works have been useful in providing background for photography's place in the museum. However, the question of whether photography should be exhibited in the museum has

been settled for some time, and photography shows are a constant and accepted practice in major institutions around the world today. A previously neglected topic of interest, the history of photography exhibitions has become increasingly popular in the last several decades, the subject of several texts such as, Public Photographic Spaces: Exhibitions of Propaganda, from Pressa to the Family of Man, 1928-55 by Jorge Ribalta17 and Olivier Lugon's discussion of modern photography exhibitions in the essay, "Modern Exhibitions of Photography," in 2009.18 The Power of Display: A History of Exhibition Installations at the Museum of Modern Art in New York by Mary Anne Staniszewski discusses the work of photographic curator Edward Steichen in a broader discussion of the art of installation.19 These texts, which focus on the history of photographic exhibitions, offer a useful background for, but do not mention Responding to Photography specifically; as a contemporary exhibition held in Toronto, it lies outside their scope.

Texts on Collecting Fine Art & Photography Theories regarding the collection of fine art have been advanced by a number of scholars, most notably Susan A. Pearce. Pearce has written and edited a number of works related to collecting, most significantly Museums, Objects and Collections: A Cultural Study20 and Interpreting Objects and Collections.21 Pearce has been honoured for her work in two volumes of essays edited by Sandra Dudley, Narrating Objects, Collecting Stories: Essays in Honour of Professor Susan M. Pearce and

The Thing About Museums: Objects and Experience, Representation and Contestation: Essays in Honour of Professor Susan M. Pearce, published in 2012. Both texts contain a number of essays related to collecting, two of which are particularly relevant to this thesis, as they discuss the public exhibition of private collections. The first, an essay by Alexandra Bounia, "Public Displays of Private Collections: Presenting the Collection of Eleni Strathatos to the Museum Visitor" 22 is largely confined to the development of Strathatos's collection of non-photographic objects and its ultimate relocation to an institution. More significant to this thesis is Caroline Bergeron's essay, "Material Object and Immaterial Collector: Is There Room For the Collector-Donor Discourse in the Museal Space?"23 in which the author utilizes the theories of collecting and giving advanced in separate works by Jean Baudrillard and Marcel Mauss24 to examine the relationship between a "collectordonor" and a "museum-recipient." Focusing on the 2007 Montreal Museum of Fine Art exhibition, All for Art! Our Great Private Collectors Share their Works, Bergeron suggests that the relationship between the museum and collector was not properly represented in the exhibition, because there was no information on the greater collection where each work came from and therefore the personal vision of the collector was obscured. This was left to the accompanying

Symbolic value is assigned by subject in relation to another subject, usually a giver and receiver. Marcel Mauss writes about gifts in his book, The Gift, trans. Ian Gunnison (New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1967) and suggests that a gift exchange creates a bond between giver and receiver, one that requires reciprocation by the recipient. Thus the process is always open-ended and the transaction can never be completed.

publication to explain. She concludes that, "The presence of the collector-donor is often obscured in museums or restricted to highly defined zones."25 Several authors have attempted to outline the history of collecting photographs, a challenging subject, as many collectors never publicize their collections. Dealer Harry Lunn wrote an essay for Aperture entitled, "Hunter-Gatherers in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," in which he sourced the origin of photography collecting in England to Chauncy Hare Townsend.26 Collecting is further examined in introductory essays by AndrÃ© and Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se Jammes, who wrote about their own experiences of building a photography collection,27 and by John Pultz who discussed "Collectors of Photography," to introduce an exhibition of the Paul F. Walter collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City (MoMA).28 Institutional collecting has been addressed by Anne McCauley in the exhibition catalogue for The Museum & The Photograph: Collecting Photographs at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1853-190029 and by Christopher Phillips in his above-mentioned essay, "The Judgment Seat of Photography," where he analyzed the history of the photography department at MoMA.30 A number of texts offer practical advice to collectors of photography on the skills required before entering the market.

excerpts from a previously unpublished interview with Sam Wagstaff.31 Similarly, Laura Noble wrote The Art of Collecting Photography to advise potential collectors,32 and Robert A. Weinstein and Larry Booth wrote Collection, Use and Care of Historical Photographs to advise collectors of historic and vintage photographs.33 In the essay, "Photography and the Private Collector," John Szarkowski names attributes that the potential collector should possess. Significantly, Szarkowski insists the collector consider all photographs equally because, "...if the homely charm and blatant pathos of a family album escape the would-be collector, then the intelligence of Walker Evans and the hedonism of Edward Weston will also, for these are all equally photographs."34 Szarkowski goes further and validates images by all makers and for all purposes in his book, The Photographer's Eye (1966), by offering a visual vocabulary through which one can qualify the success of any photograph.35 This democratic view is acknowledged by Sutnik as a source of inspiration for her approach to collecting the medium which is displayed in the exhibition Responding to Photography.

Photography in Canada Geoffrey James, author of the introductory essay in Responding to Photography, had guestedited a special issue of artscanada in 1974, subtitled "An Inquiry Into the Aesthetics of Photography." In his earlier essay, entitled "Responding to Photographs: A Canadian Portfolio," James lamented that photography's history had been neglected, perhaps because it is so ubiquitous:

"[l]ike most medieval memorial brasses that line the floors of English cathedrals, photography has for most of its life been walked upon by people whose gaze is fixed firmly on higher things."36 He hoped to promote the work of Canadian photographers through a portfolio of contemporary work. James, at that time a journalist who was beginning to take photographs and would later become a professional photographer, argued for the medium's importance, writing, "...photography's claim to attention stands on one unassailable fact: that it is the most pervasive, influential and overlooked picture-making process in the world today."37 James's interest in the field coincided with the growing recognition for photography throughout North America. Also in this issue, Peter C. Bunnell, the McAlpin Professor of the History of Photography and Modern Art Emeritus at Princeton University,38 narrated a brief history of the establishment of the photography collection at the National Gallery of Canada under James Borcoman in his essay, "The National Gallery Photographic Collection: A Vital Resource."39 In 2011, Carol Payne and Andrea Kunard co-edited The Cultural Work of Photography in Canada,40 a series of essays about photography's role in aiding the development of a Canadian identity. Of particular value to this thesis is the afterword, "Writing Photography in Canada: A Historiography," which narrates a history of texts on Canadian photographic history.41 The authors acknowledged Ralph Greenhill, a photographer represented in Sutnik's exhibition, for

Here, Claudia Beck, Patrick Close, and Millie McKibbon discussed the market for photography from various perspectives: the dealer, the history of artist-run centres, and the current status of photography collections in public galleries throughout Canada, respectively. These texts offer an immediate context for Responding to Photography and suggest both the problems facing, and solutions for, photography in Canada.44 In 2014, Dr. Thierry Gervais, Head of Research at the Ryerson Image Centre (RIC), coordinated the symposium "Collecting and Curating Photographs: Between Private and Public Collections," at Ryerson University, which featured curators and private collectors discussing their collections. Peter Higdon, Collections Curator at the RIC, presented the paper, "The Shifting Identity of a Collection," on the history of the RIC collection. Higdon, like Sutnik, has also been working over the decades to build an institutional photography collection. The panel discussion "Toronto Collectors in Conversation" presented highlights of three variously focused private collections built in the city belonging to Steven Evans, Harry and Ann Malcolmson, and Dr. Kenneth Montague.45

Texts by Maia-Mari Sutnik and Her Sources of Inspiration To provide a framework for this thesis and to understand the development of Sutnik's thoughts on photography throughout her career, I consulted her catalogue essays written for exhibitions of E. Haanel Cassidy, John Gutmann, Michel Lambeth, Charles Macnamara and M.O. Hammond, Arnaud Maggs, and Josef Sudek, as well as the exhibition of photographic objects, Pop Photographica.46 Additionally, this thesis considers the catalogue for "An Exhibition of Photographs from the Collection of Sam Wagstaff," which Sutnik acknowledges as inspiration for Responding to Photography.47 Most significantly, she later wrote an essay in 1989 for MUSE magazine entitled, "Collecting Photographed Images: The Dilemma of Intent."48 Articulating her personal collecting philosophy, Sutnik suggested that because the intent behind making a photograph is often unknowable, its interpretation should be flexible-- the focus should be on the quality of the image itself. She concluded by summing up what it means to collect as a "generalist;" that is, one who accepts all intended uses of photography: The unlimited production of images of every subject imaginable allows us to collect a world of complexity that initiates challenging dilemmas that give compelling arguments as well as shape to the ambitions and goals of photographers. 49 While the text offers an excellent foundation for considering Responding to Photography, Sutnik did not address this exhibition specifically as she treated the collecting of photography more broadly.

Chapter 3. The History of Photography at the Art Gallery of Ontario
Photography exhibitions were held at the Art Gallery of Ontario as early as 1917,50 but the photography collection did not begin until the 1970s, as stated earlier. While there were exhibitions of amateur work such as the annual salons of the Toronto Camera Club, they were most often organized by outside parties and held infrequently until the 1960s, a pattern seen elsewhere in art institutions across North America. Early criticism of the gallery's lack of support for the medium is advanced in a review from 1935 published in the Toronto Telegram which stated: "Perhaps the city is not yet able to accept the fact that modern art is photography and not the atavistic drawing and painting of many of its so-called `modern painters.'"51 Maia-Mari Sutnik joined the AGO in the late 1960s as an employee of the education department. Part of this department's remit involved instruction in the history of art, which at that time was delivered using 35 mm slides. Typically, an institution would create "study sets" of slides featuring works from its collection that would be sold for educational purposes, although at this time the AGO did not have a slide sales program. In 1974, Sutnik was appointed head of Photographic Services and given a six-month study leave to visit other art institutions and examine their procedures for the documentation of their collections. Sutnik realized the cost efficiencies to be gained by the AGO in establishing the photographic services department; previously, outside photographers had been brought in to photograph the collection. She established a studio in the gallery and hired a staff photographer, Eberhart Otto.52 With an increased number of slides featuring the collection, as well as the acquisition of slides from other institutions for instruction, the Photographic Services department was renamed the Photographic

Resources department around 1983, and Sutnik was named its coordinator. From this position, Sutnik was now able to grow the photography collection. The first photograph had been accessioned into the collection in 1925: an ambrotype after an engraving of author Charlotte BrontÃ« held in the library.53 While a few other photographs were accessioned into the collection through the library and other departments, it wasn't until 1974 that acquisitions for a photography collection truly began. That year, Sutnik was granted permission to begin collecting photographs when the large acquisition of Henry Moore sculptures arrived at the gallery, including a number of photographic portraits of the artist. It was with the encouragement of Alan Wilkinson, the Moore curator, that Sutnik began to build the photography collection, though slowly and with great patience. However, because there was neither an acquisition committee nor a budget for photography, Sutnik needed to go through the appropriate collection committee for each purchase, such as the Canadian Art department or the Contemporary Art department. As time passed and the acquisitions budget at the gallery gradually shrank, this became less and less of a possibility, and it would be largely through generous donations that the collection was able to grow any further. The number of annual acquisitions to the photograph collection is indicated in Table 1.

Fortunately, the procedure for coordinating photography exhibitions was simpler in the 1980s than it is today, as Sutnik worked directly with the Chief Curator, Roald Nasgaard, to have exhibitions approved and designed. Nonetheless, while the number of photography exhibitions increased, a collecting policy was still a long way off. Speaking at the 1979 symposium Canadian Perspectives: A National Conference on Canadian Photography, curator Millie McKibbon lamented the AGO's continuing lack of support for the medium despite Sutnik's work: [Sutnik] has devoted a great deal of energy toward the recognition of photography as an art form and it is unfortunate that the AGO with its resources have not been more innovative and established a policy of collecting. I say this knowing that in the regions outside Ottawa, the AGO has the largest staff, the largest and newest facility and the

  

17  

largest budget and with those advantages, it could be establishing a precedent for photography.54 From 1994, Sutnik continued to work on the collection despite holding other administrative positions within the gallery, until the year 2000 when the AGO finally announced that it would officially create a curatorial department of Photography and Sutnik would be named its curator. In 2006, an assistant curator was hired to aid Sutnik and the nascent department. The succession of directors at the AGO and their various dispositions toward photography have steered the gallery's position on photography over the course of Sutnik's career. William J. Withrow, director from 1961-1990, was not supportive of the medium despite the fact that this period saw the greatest international growth in its popularity, with the boom of the photography market and increase in educational programming throughout North America. Referring to Withrow, Geoffrey James said, "[Photography]...was just a problem for him."55 Photographer Robert Burley who worked in the audiovisual department at the AGO during the 1970s, recalls a board meeting where this lack of support for the medium was commented on and the gallery's perspective explained: I can remember working on a board meeting where someone got up and asked why the AGO was not collecting photography. And that was really a burning question. Not only in Toronto but... on a national and international level. Why were major museums not actively collecting photography and supporting the work of young photographers? I clearly remember the response by... one of the members of the board. He simply said, we just don't feel as if it's in our mandate. We collect art. He didn't say photography was not art but that was the suggestion.56 In 1990, Glenn Lowry became director of the gallery. He was the first director whom Sutnik credits as supporting photography. Unfortunately, Lowry soon moved on to the prestigious position as Director of MoMA, New York and was replaced by Maxwell Anderson in 1995.

Anderson's tenure was also brief, and before long he left for the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1998. He was succeeded by Matthew Teitelbaum under whose directorship the department was officially founded. Sutnik notes that under his influence, "photography is on firm footing."57 The frequent turnover in directors during the 1990s likely had a stalling effect on the establishment of a department. Teitelbaum notes that there were attempts to start a department prior to his tenure but maintains that community support was lacking: We as an institution took a while to identify the support in the community that could help sustain it. There were attempts to build a department of photography before we finally set one up in 2000... there was not evident support in the community to make that happen.58 As the AGO is the largest art institution in Toronto, its position would appear to indicate that the art establishment in the city was not interested in photography until relatively recently. However, there was increasing support for photography in the broader community prior to Responding to Photography, which ensured its enthusiastic reception at the AGO. Having traced the institution's relationship with photography in this chapter, I will now discuss the state of photography in Toronto around the time of Responding to Photography to deepen an understanding of just how significant the exhibition and Sutnik's vision truly were in Toronto at that time.

Chapter 4. Photography in Toronto in the 1980s
For if photography was invented in 1839, it was only discovered in the 1960s and 1970s-- photography that is, as an essence, photography itself. -- Douglas Crimp59 Photography was growing in popularity in Toronto from the late 1960s, so that by the time Responding to Photography opened in 1984, there was a supportive photographic community present in the city. Robert Burley has described the 1970s and 1980s as period of intense photographic activity: "There was a lot of excitement, a lot of energy, a lot of individuals who were really actively kind of pushing the idea of photography as an art form... Maia was one of those people."60 It was in the late 1960s that the history of photography first became a topic of instruction in colleges and universities and a component of practical photography programs in North America. Commercial and artistic instruction in photography took place at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Ryerson University), York University, and the Ontario Centre for Art (now Ontario Centre for Art and Design). Donald Dickinson, who had studied with Beaumont Newhall and Nathan Lyons and was a printer for Minor White, crafted the first photography curriculum at Ryerson in the 1960s and began its slide library for instruction. Students were provided with excellent programs, taught by recognized instructors such as photographer Dickinson, academic Marta Braun, and curator Don Snyder, and graduated with strong foundational skills to both practice and appreciate the medium. The Ryerson teaching collection of photographs began in 1968 with the acquisition of two prints by W. Eugene Smith. In its early years, the collection was placed on racks at the back

of the photography equipment cage in the Image Arts department, but by 1971 it had been moved to its own room with a locked door,61 and Peter Higdon became the Collections Curator. Ryerson instructor Phil Bergerson founded the highly popular Kodak Lecture Series in 1975, through which significant photographers such as Sally Mann, Nathan Lyons and Bernd and Hilla Becher would come to Ryerson to present talks. Ryerson students, Gary Hall (later the founding director of Gallery TPW) and Robert Burley (now a well-known photographer) worked at the lectures, taking tickets and operating audio-visual equipment.62 Bergerson, with assistance from his student Hall, was also responsible for organizing the 1979 symposium, Canadian Perspectives: A National Conference on Canadian Photography, mentioned above. This was the second symposium concerning photography in Canada, following Eyes of Time, which was coordinated by the National Photographic Collection with Heritage Canada in 1978 and drew over 200 hundred participants.63 The Art Gallery of York University has also been noted for its significant programming under curator Michael Greenwood at this time, which featured the work of students and professionals. Upon graduation, students who hoped to succeed as artists through their photography were faced with the harsh reality that few institutions in Toronto were collecting contemporary work. Out of a strong need for community, these former students banded together to form a number of artist-run centres, a popular concept at the time where artists took control of how

their work was made, presented and sold. 64 One of these, A Space, was founded in 1971 to promote contemporary art in Toronto,65 while two of the most significant for the advocacy of photography were the Toronto Photographers Workshop (Gallery TPW), founded in 1977 and Gallery 44 founded in 1979. The original members of each centre represented the graduates from the major photography programs in the city, with TPW consisting primarily of former Ryerson students and Gallery 44, mainly former OCA students, although they were not intended to be exclusive.66 Largely due to the work of Michael Mitchell, TPW began as a collective, where photographers could share equipment and hold critiques, just as they had done as students at Ryerson.67 In 1980, programming became a major focus for the collective when they negotiated a rent-free gallery space at the Harbourfront Centre and were able to pay featured artists. Using the skills he had garnered while working under Bergerson for Canadian Perspectives, Gary Hall became involved in the planning and operation of the gallery.68 For payment, TPW followed the minimum fee schedules as laid out by the Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des artistes canadiens (CARFAC).69 Gallery 44 also began running exhibitions that same year.70 It was due to the excellent work of these pioneering photographers that photography stabilized as a recognized artistic medium. Artists such as Suzy Lake found the city welcoming and supportive

of her photographic work when she arrived here in 1978 from Montreal and joined Gallery TPW.71 As an indication of the significance of these centres to photographers, the two artist-run centres have remained operational, with relative success, despite the financial hardships that have closed commercial galleries. New publications provided a place to write about photography and to publicize photography events. These included Document: A Newsletter about Photography (1969-74), published by the Baldwin Street Gallery, Image Nation (1970-82), Impressions (1970-83), Photo CommuniquÃ© (1978-1988), published by Gail Fisher-Taylor, and Views, A Quarterly Journal of Contemporary Canadian Photographic Art (1984-91), published by TPW.72 Many more were published across the country, although none lasted for more than a few years due to wavering interest and funding. Commercial galleries provided another vehicle for the promotion of photography: A Moment in Time, DÃ©jÃ  Vue, The Baldwin Street Gallery of Photography (started as The Women's Photo Co-Op), and Yarlow/Salzmann galvanized the photographic community, holding many significant exhibitions. Representing commercial interests, there would of course be an aspect of promotion in the activities of these galleries who saw value in the success of the burgeoning photography market. They did however, provide other places to view and purchase exciting photographic works at this time, often showing photography on an equal footing with other media. Yarlow/Salzman, in particular was described as "the most interesting photography gallery."73 Narrating her struggles to promote the medium in Toronto, Loretta Yarlow described holding a Lee Friedlander show in 1977 and not being able to find guests for a dinner in his honour, nor many buyers for his prints. However, she noted the support of young Toronto

photographers, many from Ryerson, who purchased works through installments.74 Unfortunately, commercial art dealing is subject to the ebb and flow of the larger financial market, and many of these early galleries were forced to close in times of economic recession. One survivor from the early years, the Corkin Gallery (founded in 1978 as the Jane Corkin Gallery), represents both photography and other media. Toronto was not unique in its resistance to the medium and many art institutions across the country were without photography departments in 1979.75 Andrea Kunard and Carol Payne suggest that this is because, "[a]t that time, it was felt that there were not enough funds to create any kind of comprehensive collection in regional galleries, and that such collecting practices should be left to federal museums."76 Photography was beginning to flourish on the national level with the establishment of the photographic collection at the National Gallery of Canada in 1967 under James Borcoman. Under arrangement by officials of the Treasury Board, the NGC was mandated to focus on collecting international historic works, to complement collections at the National Archives (now Library and Archives Canada) of historic and vernacular Canadian work and the National Film Board's Still Photography Division (SPD) of contemporary Canadian work.77 The SPD, in addition to collecting, produced and distributed work through an extensive exhibition and publication program under the guidance of Lorraine Monk and later, Martha Langford. Several of its travelling exhibitions, such as The Many Worlds of Lutz Dille and Canada: Spring and Autumn, Winter and Summer Â­ A Selection from `A Year of the Land, visited the AGO during the 1970s. In 1985, the SPD collection was renamed the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography, a stand-alone institution, affiliated with the National Gallery of Canada and

The Photographic Historical Society of Canada had been founded in 197478 to promote the study and discussion of historic Canadian work.79 Photography was also being acknowledged as a legitimate artistic medium in federal policy: in 1980, the Federal Cultural Review Policy Committee met in Ottawa where Robert Burley and a delegation from Gallery TPW went to promote the interests of photographers.80 The result, the ApplebaumHÃ©bert Report, contained 101 recommendations to improve the administration of arts funding across all media, including recommendations to halt the NFB's production of films and to create a new gallery for contemporary Canadian art, although most were not adopted.81 The report noted that Canadian photography and film, along with Native art and the applied arts, were often neglected in major institutions and proposed that new collections be founded focusing on these media.82 In the 1970s, the success of photography in the international art market led to increased collecting in Toronto. However, Toronto collectors of the day offer conflicting perspectives on how easy it was to build a collection from Toronto. Numerous collectors have suggested that Toronto remains to this day provincial and inward looking,83 making it difficult to purchase specific genres or types of work, while others have praised the city's resources. This perspective is often based on the material being collected; for example, Steven Evans has found it difficult to

Wilson has had success in building his collection of stereoscopic views through local antique shows.85 While Harry and Anne Malcolmson have attributed the high quality works in their collection to their ability to travel internationally,86 Patricia Regan, widow of Dr. Arthur Rubinoff asserts that almost of all her late husband's collection of masterworks was acquired in Toronto.87 Describing the burgeoning photographic activity at that time, author Margaret E. Haller wrote: "Probably one of the fields relatively unmined to date is that of photography in Canada...'88 By the early 1980s, photography was beginning to receive the support that many believed it deserved. Through the creation, curation and collection of photography, the city was experiencing a peak of interest in the medium. The time was finally ripe for Sutnik to propose a comprehensive photographic exhibition for Toronto.

Chapter 5. Description of Responding to Photography
Although Sutnik began organizing Responding to Photography in 1983, the idea for the exhibition was one she had been considering for many years. Referring to the exhibition as a "research project," she notes that she set out with no preconceived notions of what to exhibit. Ultimately, she wanted to explore how collectors in Toronto were "responding" to the medium and present an entry point to photography as well as an introduction to both Canadian and international photographers for an uninitiated audience. The process began through relationships with photography dealers Jane Corkin and Loretta Yarlow who, after gaining consent from their clients, provided her with contact information and descriptions of local collections. However, these initial inquiries led her to collections representing similar types of work by the same group of artists, something Sutnik had hoped to avoid. It was at this point that she acknowledges the assistance of Michael Mitchell, a photographer and collector, who suggested she look to other photographers in the city who would likely have their own collections and could introduce her to new and varied collectors. Sutnik also credits Michael Greenwood for sharing some of the contacts he had established for his earlier exhibition, Master Photographs from Private Toronto Collections held at the Art Gallery of York University in 1979,89 which also featured photographs from private collections in Toronto in order to illustrate the traditional canon of photography. She further acknowledges Av Isaacs, who was showing photographs by Michel Lambeth and other contemporary Canadian photographers as early as the 1960s.90 As Sutnik viewed more collections, she grew increasingly excited by the variety of material being collected. While several collectors would focus on the traditional masterworks, others would collect the work of student photographers; while one collector focused on

stereographs, another would buy solely contemporary art prints. Even more intriguing were the collections with unique foci, such as the collector who bought only photographs of bicycles.91 These discoveries allowed Sutnik to illustrate a variety of types of works, rather than one particular genre and contributed to the distinctive nature of her exhibition. Sutnik was awarded a McLean Foundation92 grant to produce the catalogue. Aware of Geoffrey James's writings on photography, and particularly his essay "Responding to Photographs" for the special issue of artscanada in 1979, Sutnik wrote to James asking him to write an introductory essay for her catalogue.93 As early as 1971, James had been teaching the history of photography at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in Montreal and was known for his administration work at the Canada Council for the Arts.94 The resulting essay for Responding to Photography focused on the wide variety of images presented in the exhibition, from the commercial to the vernacular, all commanding equal attention simply through their presence on the walls of the gallery. This consistency is a quality James finds unique to the photographic medium, partly due to its mechanical production, but largely because of how we have been trained to appreciate photographs. Referring to Lazlo Moholy-Nagy, John Szarkowski, EugÃ¨ne Atget, and Roland Barthes, James suggested that these figures worked to open our minds to the photographic medium, to appreciate it in ever-evolving ways. For this reason, James refers to the output of all photographers as, "the republic of images."95

The main text of the catalogue, written by Sutnik, is devoted to "Notes to the Exhibition," which outlines her organization of the material. Also included are colour reproductions of seventy-five of the 158 works featured in the exhibition. As Head of Photographic Resources, Sutnik could ensure that her publication featured the best quality reproductions and would work as a resource for future researchers. Steven Evans, an employee of the AGO, Tess Taconis, wife of Magnum photographer Kryn Taconis, and David Harris, recently returned from graduate studies, undertook the research. The "Notes" narrate a basic history of photography through five issues "integral to the whole of the photographic tradition."96 Following a teleological model inspired by Beaumont Newhall, Sutnik offered a visual anthology of the traditional Eurocentric history of the medium--with the addition of Canadian photographers. While the inclusion of Canadian content was not original, (Ralph Greenhill did the same in 1965 with his text Early Photography in Canada) it represented the importance that Sutnik placed on Canadian photography.97 Additionally, Sutnik wanted to present visual groupings of works that would not normally be paired, as Sam Wagstaff had done, as curator for his earlier exhibition and catalogue.98 For example, in figure 1, under the heading "Exploration and Topography," the chalk lines marking a baseball field in a Meyerowitz print can be compared to the lines of ore in an infrared photograph by the Ontario Remote Sensing Commission through their juxtaposition.99

After the war, writing became mainly focused on curatorial interests. In her inclusion of Canadian and vernacular and commercial work, Sutnik's writing in this catalogue combines the holistic perspective of the archivist with curatorial interests. 98 Sutnik, interview. 99 These photographs were paired in the catalogue on facing pages.

A collecting philosophy based on the uses for photography was established here by Sutnik and would be adopted as the official mandate for the department in the early 2000s.100 The catalogue was very well received and remains a significant text for Canadian photography scholars. In 1985, it was awarded first prize in the category of "Catalogue Over 32 Pages" by the Ontario Association of Art Galleries,101 and the cover (fig. 3) was nominated for an award at the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada exhibition, "The Best of the 80's."102 The final selection of 158 works, ranging in date from 1945 to 1984, produced by 130 artists, and representative of 23 different photographic media, was installed in the Margaret Eaton Gallery. The photographs were arranged using the same five framing devices outlined in the "Notes to the Exhibition:" Instantaneous Images; Exploration and Topography; Private and Public Pictures; Documentary and Social Function; and Form and Beyond. These were traditional categories suggested in history of photography texts such as Newhall's, however Sutnik's arrangement was not chronological and scattered works from disparate time periods and genres across the groups. While the photographs were displayed in a traditional linear sequence, every so often something would disrupt the standard rhythm--a stacked grouping of works, or multiple works contained within a single frame. Specific display techniques were necessary for the Michael Snow piece, Eco, (fig. 4) which required illumination from above to light the box structure. Sutnik was not interested in replicating the displays of the individual collectors, but wanted the photographs themselves to be the focus.103 Works belonging to the same lender were

scattered throughout the exhibition and paired with photographs from collections based on different collecting philosophies. The exhibition served to represent Sutnik's own philosophy of the medium, rather than the individual interests of each collector. The exhibition was held from October 13th to December 2nd, 1984, with an opening reception on October 16, where William J. Withrow, Maia-Mari Sutnik, and Michael Greenwood offered remarks (fig. 4). To complement the exhibition, David Harris gave a talk on photography collecting in Jackman Hall.104 Press coverage of the exhibition was both broad and targeted at specific audiences. Sutnik wrote an article for the in-house publication, The Gallery, which appeared on the front page of the October 1984 issue.

contemporary work, and work by lesser-known and anonymous photographers were on show thanks to "alert and perceptive collectors."105 Advertisements in the Toronto Star, City Dweller, the Globe and Mail and a television spot on CBLFT served to publicize the event to the general public. To attract an audience of photography enthusiasts, a six-page spread was published in the 1984 fall edition of Photo CommuniquÃ©, featuring reproductions of several photographs in the exhibition.106 In a review of the exhibition, Steven Jack, a dealer and lender, noted that the response to the exhibition was positive and indicated what was lacking in Toronto: The response to this show has been enthusiastic. Unfortunately, exhibitions such as this are too few. There is little opportunity to see great photography in Toronto on a regular basis and it is probably time that this void be seriously addressed... That there is such significant activity in private collecting as evidenced in Responding to Photography would seem to strongly argue that we are in need of a vigorous facility in which photographic arts have appropriate prominence.107 Sutnik was pleased with the positive response to her exhibition, which appeared to satisfy a need in the viewing public. Anyone interested in photography in Toronto would have wanted to see the exhibition, recalls Peter Higdon, "because it was so hard to see anything."108 Michael Mitchell referred to the "great energy" of the show and believed that contemporary photographers in the city felt the support provided by an exhibition that was so overt in its devotion to the medium.109 Responding to Photography was the most significant exhibition of Sutnik's career for embodying her own philosophy of the medium. It has had a profound impact on her work at the gallery, by both demonstrating her curatorial abilities and introducing her to an eager photographic public.

Chapter 6. Analysis of the Exhibition
Although the exhibition followed the work of Sam Wagstaff and other exhibitions of privately owned works, Responding to Photography was a first for Toronto. It represented the medium, now deemed worthy of exhibiting by the biggest art institution in Toronto, presented in a non-traditional way, which created a high profile for photography that was new to the city. A comparison of the photographers featured in the exhibition with those in Photographs from the Collection of Sam Wagstaff (presented at the AGO in 1981) and Michael Greenwood's Master Photographs from Private Toronto Collections (1977) will lead to a better understanding of how Sutnik's approach differed. Greenwood set out with a more narrow focus, selecting works from the traditional canon of photographic masterworks, which were intended as art prints. Sutnik's was a more ambitious project, as she strove to display the wide variety of works found locally, created for a variety of uses, as we have seen. As two exhibitions drawn from private Toronto collections within ten years of each other, Sutnik's could easily have featured many of the same works selected by Greenwood for his exhibition. However, despite the involvement of many of the same lenders, only fifteen works appeared in both shows. First, I examined the works according to nationality to determine the number of Canadian photographers in all three exhibitions and whether Sutnik was unique in presenting Canadian material [figures 5 through 7, pg. 38]. Significantly, Wagstaff's exhibition featured no Canadian work. Twenty-nine percent of the photographers in Responding to Photography were Canadian, while in Master Photographs they represented only three percent. Next, in order to assess how far Sutnik strayed from the traditional canon, I divided the photographers into four major categories: (i) artists who were at that time considered part of the traditional canon of

  

34  

photography, according to Beaumont Newhall's History of Photography110; (ii) photographers of all nationalities producing work, within ten years of the exhibition; (iii) Canadian photographers with work produced before 1974111; and (iv) anonymous and lesser known photographers [figures 8 through 10, pg. 39]. Of the 130 photographers featured in Responding to Photography, thirty-six percent were canonical, twenty percent were contemporary, twelve percent were early Canadian, and thirtytwo percent non-canonical photographers. In the Wagstaff exhibition, canonical photographers made up forty-six percent, contemporary photographers only eleven percent and non-canonical photographers forty-three percent, while Master Photographs featured eighty-seven percent canonical photographers, three percent contemporary, two percent early Canadian and eight percent non-canonical photographers. As the first two exhibitions feature comparable numbers of non-canonical photographers, it is clear that Wagstaff influenced Sutnik in her conception of Responding to Photography. Master Photographs from Private Toronto Collections stands alone. Although it also served to indicate the rich quality of material collected in Toronto, by focusing on masterworks, Greenwood presented a retread of the canon of photography set out by Newhall with only slight deviation. While the Art Gallery of York University was noted as an exciting site for photographic exhibitions, its location far north of the city-centre limited the number of viewers to the exhibition, and Sutnik's is the better remembered of the two.112 When compared with these others, Sutnik's exhibition was clearly designed to effectively present her vision of photography in Canada.

The exhibition can be further analyzed according to the visual relationships that Sutnik suggested (again following Wagstaff's example) through wall arrangements of the photographs and their juxtaposition in the catalogue. Because the installation was unique and reflected the eccentricities Sutnik was presenting in the photographic medium, the success of the visual pairings should be commented upon. Sutnik specifically pointed out pairings in the catalogue, and these pages can be compared with a pairing in A Book of Photographs from the Collection of Sam Wagstaff. The Sutnik pairing, figure 11, connected a Lewis Baltz industrial faÃ§ade on one page with an interior of the Chateau Frontenac for the Canadian Pacific Railway and an Eaton's Window Display on the facing page. In his example, figure 12, Wagstaff paired two nineteenth century works in order to highlight the voyeurism present in both a Lewis Carroll portrait of a young girl and a photograph of a hippopotamus in the zoo. Both curators recognized themes and elements in images to create stimulating pairings but because Wagstaff's exhibition preceded Sutnik's, its innovation and shock value appeared greater to an uninitiated audience. While Wagstaff's compares and contrasts works by known and unknown makers, his collection mainly contains high-quality work, due to Wagstaff's independence and wealth.113 Sutnik's comparisons are more diverse in both quality and collectability, due to the limitations of the collections with which she worked, and ultimately produce a more intriguing catalogue. A significant factor that marks the superiority of Sutnik's catalogue and comparisons is the colour reproductions, as opposed to the monochromatic Wagstaff reproductions, which allows her to juxtapose colour and black and white images.

                                                                                                                
Wagstaff was born into a wealthy New York City family and inherited the fortune he used to build his collection. When he sold his collection to the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1984, the price was reported as around $5 million.

In enabling the gallery to establish relationships with the lenders to the exhibition, the show had reasonable success. Of the forty-one lenders to the exhibition, thirteen have since donated works to the AGO. These lenders, listed in Table 2, have donated 691 photographs and eighty-three works to other departments. However, of the photographs selected by Sutnik for her exhibition, only four have since been donated, despite the owners' promise of several more. This may indicate Sutnik's suggestion that due to her selection, the photographs have become more valuable to the collectors. Sutnik has suggested other reasons: a number of lenders have since stopped collecting photographs, either shifting their focus to different media or having lost interest in collecting; a number have moved away from Toronto; and several have passed away. She does hope that more from this initial selection and other works from the lenders will be donated in the future. 114 Table 2: Donations to the AGO's Photography Collection by Lenders to Responding to Photography Collection Mr. & Mrs. Morton H.

A significant factor impacting the number of donations to the AGO is surely the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, through which a donor can be granted a tax receipt for the whole "fair-market value of a photograph."115 This incentive to giving is unique to Canada and is something that Burley and Higdon have suggested as significant for the growth of photographic collections in Canada. Higdon noted that at the Ryerson Image Centre, "once collectors found out that we could take works for Cultural Property, we began to be offered a lot of material."116

Chapter 7. Conclusion
In preparation for Responding to Photography, Maia-Mari Sutnik discovered a trove of local collectors who held photography in high regard and who proved that a photographic community existed in Toronto in the 1980s. The responses the exhibition received further indicated a common discontent with the photography department at the AGO, but optimism about what the exhibition, and by extension Sutnik's work, could mean for its future. The relationships established with collectors through the exhibition and the heightened profile of the AGO as a place to view engaging photographs, were not enough to gain the support of the director to establish a photography department in 1984. While Sutnik and many others in the city, such as Peter Higdon at the RIC, and gallerists such as Loretta Yarlow had responded to the medium and engaged with it fully, a full commitment to photography on the part of the AGO, the largest art institution in Toronto, was stalled due to the conservative nature of the institution which lagged behind other major art institutions in both Canada and the world in collecting photography. The true pioneers of the period were the photographers themselves, who, by banding together to create educational programming and artist-run centres, built structures for the support of the medium in Toronto. Expanding on the ideas proposed by Responding to Photography, Sutnik organized the exhibition "Selected Gifts from the Collection" in 1988. While four years earlier there had not been a large enough collection from which to organize an exhibition, this show gave evidence of its steady growth, mostly through donations of both works and funds. Since that time, the collection has experienced tremendous growth through consistent donations between 2000 and 2008 by one anonymous donor and by the acquisition of the Harry and Ann Malcolmson collection in 2014.

Truly, the photography collection would not exist as it is today without the early work of Maia-Mari Sutnik. David Harris states that Sutnik's importance to the photography collection, initiated with Responding to Photography, has been fundamental: The reason photography is at the AGO, in my opinion, is solely because of Maia. Her energy, her perseverance, her good spirits, her unquenchable enthusiasm for photography that kept it as a presence there, on the backburner, very low, but always there.117 Despite the great support for photography in the city today, Sutnik does not think she would be able to restage a similarly successful exhibition because photographic collecting has changed. She explained, "... I'm sure we could do that again. I still think that there are people that are interested in collecting in a very diverse way... I think the point's been made though...It would be potpourri and I'm afraid it might just fail as a potpourri unless you got the right petals together to mix."118 In 2000, Jessica Bradley, Curator of Contemporary Art organized the photographic exhibition The Bigger Picture at the AGO, which was also made up of privately collected works in the city. Its focus, however, was contemporary, large-scale photographs by artists such as Thomas Struth, Andreas Gursky, Sophie Calle, Michael Snow, and Cindy Sherman. In recent decades, photography had become a primary form of expression for contemporary artists. The Bigger Picture could be seen as a coda to Responding to Photography and an indication that collecting activity remained high in Toronto. The "generalist" collecting strategy initiated by Sam Wagstaff would also gain popularity in the years following Responding to Photography. Photo-materialists such as Geoffrey Batchen have argued for the significance of photographic-objects,119 a view shared by Sutnik and featured in the collection and exhibition Pop Photographica: Photography's Objects in Everyday Life, guest curated by

Paul Getty Museum, and the International Centre of Photography.121 A detailed explanation of the generalist way of thinking can be found in Ian Jeffrey's Revisions: An Alternative History of Photography, published in 2000 for an exhibition of the same name. Jeffrey argues for the significance of photographs produced for scientific purposes such as X-ray and celestial photographs, as well as wire photographs, and other works he views as neglected.122 As the acceptance for the entirety of the photographic medium is still growing, it should be remembered that this concept was championed at the AGO at an early stage, leading to the establishment of a distinctive collecting policy that takes in illustrations of photographs created for a variety of purposes, and by photographers outside of the traditional canon. The support of director Matthew Teitelbaum and the highly regarded work of Associate Curator Sophie Hackett have encouraged even further the development and reputation of the photography department, which now stands as one of the biggest and best in the country. Through this study of Responding to Photography and its context, a small part of the history of photography in Toronto has been told. Each interview subject suggested further avenues of research that were out of the scope of this particular work. A more thorough examination of photography in Toronto and in Canada as a whole has yet to be undertaken and remains a fruitful subject for further research.
