ABSTRACT
THE PRESENCE OF PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASES SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTIVATED PHAGOCYTIC RECEPTOR COMPLEXES FROM HUMAN U937 Marwan G. Abid Althagafi Master of Science, Molecular Science, Ryerson University 2014

The innate immune system is the first shield against foreign attack inside the human body, and it is usually carried out with phagocytosis. An essential macrophage cell surface protein is the Fc receptor which contributes to the engulfment of unknown antigens. One of the important members of Fc receptors is the gamma receptor that binds to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) ligand. Another key receptor in this study is the CD36 receptor, which plays a crucial role in the progression of atherosclerosis, the hardening of artieries, with its ligand oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL). In this report, protein tyrosine kinase enzymes have been detected in the involvement of receptor complexes with human U937 macrophages, specifically PTK2 and PTK2b genes. Protein tyrosine kinases were known to promote cell migration as a main player in intracellular signal transduction cascades in relation to extracellular stimuli. Cell surface proteins are essential for the immunization of various diseases; yet, the molecular machinery of surface receptors remains unclear. This research primarily examined the dynamic nature of protein tyrosine kinases in an ongoing investigation of macrophage cell surface receptors, particularly the role of Fc  and CD36 receptors with their ligands IgG and oxLDL coated beads in phagocytosis. Our report demonstrates a novel role of PTK2 and PTK2b functions in relation to U937 CD36-mediated phagocytosis. The Phagocytic efficiency of U937 macrophages was analyzed using laser scanning confocal microscope after silencing the cells with siRNA followed by quantitative counting of phagocytosis. The PF drug FAK inhibitor was also introduced to compare the phagocytic efficiency of siRNA cells.    III

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Focal Adhesion Kinases 1.1.1. Background
In atherosclerosis (accumulation of lipids in the arterial intima) few studies have associated protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) with cardiovascular disease. Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that are related to the protein kinase family and play an important role in various cellular functions (cell adhesion, signaling, etc). PTKs are found at the focal contacts that originate around the cell periphery of intracellular spaces (Sleg et al., 1999). PTKs have four gene isoforms with only two genes known to have a full-length structure including: PTK2 (or FAK) and PTK2b (or Pyk2). Recent review studies that have provided structural information about FAK and Pyk2 offer important insights into the function and molecular pathways of regulation; however, the key structural question as to how lipids bind to FAK domains (FERM domain) and the mechanism(s) involved remain unresolved (Hall and Schaller, 2011). To date, the known associations between protein kinases and Fc (fragment crystallizable) gamma receptor (receptor for immunoglobulin G) (Jankowski et al., 2008) and/or CD36 (receptor for lipid particles) receptor involves phagocytosis processes in immune cells such as macrophages (unpublished data). However, the machinery of FAK and Pyk2 activation remains unclear. In 1992 Focal Adhesion Kinases (FAKs) were first identified as a substrate for the v-Src oncogene as a result of oncogene transformation in fibroblasts associated with cancer (e.g., breast carcinoma) and/or cancer metastatic spread in the human body (Schaller et al., 1992; Weiner et al., 1993). FAKs are found in the majority of cell types and tissues from mammalian species to lower eukaryotic organisms, and FAKs are regulated by extracellular stimuli (for example integrin signaling)    1     

(Schaller et al., 1992; Hanks et al., 1992; Palmer et al., 1999; Fox et al., 1999). The presence of FAKs is implicated in various physiological disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer progression and metastasis, and FAK have an important role during embryonic development (Vadali et al., 2007; Golubovskaya et al., 2009; Hall and Schaller, 2011). FAK is responsible for the communication between cells by regulation of cell attachment to focal adhesion sites leading to the initiation of traction force for cell migration (Schaller, 2010; Zheng et al., 2009). The assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions have a strong relationship to FAK activation and deactivation in various extra-intra cellular functions as seen in cancer metastasis (Schaller, 2010; Zheng et al., 2009). It has been suggested that FAK localization plays an important role in major structural changes seen in various studies on live cells (Cai et al., 2008; Papusheva et al., 2009). Thus, FAK is a core regulator of diverse cellular tasks regarding: cell signaling, survival, cycle, gene transcription, proliferation, migration, cytoskeleton remodeling, and microtubule formation (Schaller, 2010; Hall and Schaller, 2011). Focal adhesions originate at the peripheral part of the intracellular space and near the intracellular matrix-integrin junctions that link together extracellular signaling and cytoskeletal proteins at the time of cell migration, spreading and adhesion (Ridley and Hall, 1992; Parsons, 2003; Taylor et al., 2001; Richardson et al., 1997). FAK is phosphorylated to regulate cell migration and adhesion in response to haptotactic, chemotactic and durotactic stimuli (Schaller, 2010; Zheng et al., 2009). Extracellular matrix stimuli and growth factors (such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor) are responsible for the activation of FAKs, causing rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Parsons, 2003). FAK has been implicated with respect to the regulation of Rho-family GTPases; thus, was linked to focal contact defects and microtubule polarization disruption via the loss of FAK expression (Ren et al., 2000). Regarding cell motility, Rho-family GTPases act as on/off switch within cells which controls actin cytoskeletal structure formation and dissociation (Ren et al., 2000).    2     

Pyk2 activation, Pyk2 being the other known isoform of FAKs, requires increased cytosolic calcium concentrations and was seen to localize less frequently to focal adhesions in various types of cells (Avraham et al., 2000). It has been suggested that Pyk2 participate in the signaling cascades for recruiting macrophages (Watson et al., 2001). The absence of Pyk2 showed impaired development of Bcells demonstrating the importance of protein kinases in various cell signaling events in relation to cellular stimuli (Guinamard et al., 2000). In addition unclear participation of Pyk2 with janus family kinases and Pyk2 activation through raised levels of calcium remains under investigation (Avraham et al., 2000; Benbernou et al., 2000).

1.1.2. Structure
FAK is located on chromosome 8 in the band 24, with a size of 125 kDa (Fiedorek and Kay, 1995; Agochiya et al., 1999). FAK consists of three main domains that are arranged linearly. At the band 4.1 in the N-terminus, FAK contains the FERM domain (erythrocyte band 4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) followed by the kinase domain. At the C-terminus, the FERM and the kinase domains are separated by an uncategorized three proline-rich region (PRR) and the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain in the lateral C- terminal side (Girault et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2002; Hall and Schaller, 2011; Arold et al., 2002; Lietha et al., 2007). The structural features of the FERM, kinase and FAT domains are linked by flexible regions containing low-specificity motifs that allow connection with ligands (Arold, 2011). Interestingly, Pyk2 is 46% identical to FAK and 65% similar at the protein level, with the same structural characteristics and domain organization as FAK (Hall and Schaller, 2011) (Fig. 1). Pyk2 is located on chromosome 8 in the band 21, with a size of 116 kDa (Herzog et al., 1996; Inazawa et al., 1996).

   3     

1.1.3. Domains 1.1.3.1. FERM Domain
In early studies, FAK had been suggested to localize in the nucleus, yet, the role of the FERM domain has been the one that rests in the nucleus assessed more recently by (Lim et al., 2008). Pyk2 shares a similar FERM domain structure with 40% FAK related structure (Lev et al., 1999). Within the FERM domain, there are F1, F2 and F3 subdomains (Fig. 1). F1 subdomain consists of a five-strand  sheet topped by an -helix, and are found to play a role in structural modifications triggering interactions with other proteins (Ceccarelli et al., 2006). F2 structure is entirely -helical with an acyl-CoA-binding protein related core, and it was suggested to participate in the autoinhibition conformation (Ceccarelli et al., 2006). Additionally, F2 subdomain conveys a significant function in FAK regulation processes, and is located on the top part of the F2 domain. Also, the F2 domain consists of KAKTLRK motif that is essential for FAK activation via FERM recruitment after the incitation of cell adhesion and growth factors stimulation (Fig. 1) (Cai et al., 2008; Papusheva et al., 2009; Chen and Chen, 2006; Dunty et al., 2004). Moreover, F2 is important for interactions with other cytoplasmic/membrane located ligands (Lim et al., 2008). The KAKTLRK motif is a key binding site for phosphatidylinositol (such as PIP2), and with the help of bisphosphorylated MET (receptor tyrosine kinase), ultimately leads to FAK activation (Chen and Chen, 2006).

Figure 1. Focal adhesion kinases predicted protein domains site. (Obtained from Hall and Schaller, 2011). In Figure 1, the kinase domain is localized between the N-C terminal, focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain is localized in the C-terminal, and the FERM (F1: Ezirn, F2: Radixin, F3: Moesin) domain is localized in the Nterminal. In the gray box the KAKTLRK sequence is located within the F2 domain top side. The blue indicated bands represent polyproline type II helical structure (PxxP motifs) (Hall and Schaller, 2011). The F3 subdomain with its  sandwich topped by the C-terminal -helix encompasses the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain containing a phospholipid-binding site and other domains such as an EVH1 (Ena/VASP homology) domain and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (DiNitto and Lambright, 2006). In reports on cancer cells, p53 is known to interact with FAK directly in vitro and in vivo with FAK acting as a scaffold for p53 (Golubovskaya et al., 2008; Lim et al., 2008). In the case of Pyk2, a similar FERM domain shares a 12-15% sequence identity between FAK and other FAK family FERM domains (Girault et al., 1999). The autophosphorylation of Tyr397 is enhanced by a FERM/Kinase interaction, as well as the Src family kinases (SFKs) localization at focal contacts, growth factor receptor bound protein-7 Grb7, p85 (subunit of PI3K), p129 RasGAP, phospholipase C (PLC), Shc adaptor protein (Fig. 3), and the suppressor of cytokine (SOCS) (Parsons, 2003; Schlaepfer et al., 2004; Hanks et al., 2003; Schaller, 2001). The FERM and kinase domain have a linker positioned in the center between both domains and contains the Tyr397 (SH2 site) and PxxP motif (SH3 site),    5     

an essential binding site for SFKs (Fig. 1) (Thomas et al., 1998). On the other hand, the binding of SFKs is achieved by Pyk2 phosphorylation sites, similar to those in FAK, with Tyr402 (SH2 site) (Avraham et al., 2000). The FERM domain seems to regulate interactions of FAK with tyrosine kinases like ETK, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, the plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and ezrin (Fig. 3) (Sieg et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2001; Poullet et al., 2001).

1.1.3.2. Kinase Domain.
In FAK, The N-terminal site of the kinase domain contains a single -helix and a five-stranded  sheet. However, the kinase domain C-terminal lobe is mainly an -helix, considering the kinase domain has a bi-lobed structure (Lietha et al., 2007). At the kinase domain, Pyk2 have 60% similarities with FAK in proline-rich regions positions, and the exact same tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr402, Tyr579, Tyr580 and Tyr881) to those of FAK phosphorylation sites (Tyr397, Tyr576, Tyr577 and Tyr925) (Hayashi et al., 2002). The kinase domain has three possible identified conditions: Firstly a completely activated kinase domain conformation with full phosphorylation of the stimulated loop attached to a nonhydrolysable ATP analog; secondly, an inactive conformation of the kinase domain with an unphosphorylated stimulated loop and thirdly, the autoinhibition conformation of the kinase domain with an unphosphorylated loop attached to the FERM domain (Lietha et al., 2007; Nowakowski et al., 2002). It is known that the phosphorylation of the kinase domain can be deactivated by a FIP200 (FAK family interacting protein) and through FIP200 interaction with the kinase and the FERM domains FAK is deactivated (Abbi et al.,    6     

2002). However, the deactivation pathway of FAK via FIP200 is still unclear (Abbi et al., 2002).

The FAK kinase domain C-terminal -helix is located in the same site in the inactive and active conformations leading to the conclusion that the Cterminal -helix is not a regulatory mode for FAK in the case of C-helix dislocation. The unphosphorylated kinase contains a disulfide bond between Cys456 and Cys459 in the N-terminal lobe. However, Pyk2 has a similar kinase domain with the exceptions being (1) the lack of a cysteine disulfide bond (Han et al., 2009) and (2) Pyk2 has Cys459 and Cys463 residues (Nowakowski et al., 2002).

1.1.3.3. FAT Domain
The focal adhesion targeting domain (FAT) has different binding partners that could change the scaffolding function of protein tyrosine kinases leading to activation of FAT or vise versa. The SH2 and SH3 domains are constituents of growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2) (Schlaepfer et al., 1994) (Fig. 3). To allow Grb2 binding to the FAT domain, SFKs (e.g., Src and Fyn) phosphorylation of Tyr925 located in the FAK loop enables the Grb2 SH2 domain binding (Schlaepfer et al., 1994; Arold et al., 2002). Also, Pyk2 has a similar binding process to that of the SH2 domain which involves the phosphorylation of Tyr402 and Tyr881 by binding of Grb2 and Src (Avraham et al., 2000). The Grb2 binding site exists in the initial -helix of the FAT domain and allows for conformational changes and phosphorylation of the FAT domain as a result of the growth factor receptor binding (Schlaepfer et al., 1994). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and RAS signaling pathways could be initiated by FAK, Grb2 interaction (promoted by integrin receptors) and paxillin dislocation from the FAT binding site allows for FAK to move and    7     

perform other activation functions (Schlaepfer et al., 1994). Also, Pyk2 allows for binding of paxillin at the FAT C-terminal domain (Hayashi et al., 2002). Phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr925 stimulates the recruitment of Grb2 and the dynamin complex in addition to regulating RAS/MAPK cascades. Through FAK release from focal contacts, the dislocation of paxillin from the FAT domain could also enhance FAK localization in other sites to manage other functions (Katz et al., 2003). Thus, the FAT complex with FAK is needed for microtubules stripping from focal contacts (Ezratty et al., 2005). The FAT domain is suggested to localize Pyk2 when FAK is detached by the facilitation of integrins (e.g., 1 integrin), which shows a different binding role of Pyk2 and FAK (Klingbeil et al., 2001). On one hand, the FAT domain binds to the integrin-associated protein talin distinctively while on the other hand Pyk2 binds to gesolin (integrin-associated protein) (Zheng et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2003). Thus, Pyk2 can be stimulated by integrins through SFKs activation (Sieg et al., 1998; Lakkakorpi et al., 2003).

1.1.4. Gene Isoforms and Function
Focal adhesion kinases, known as FAKs or the gene name protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) and closely related protein tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (also known as protein tyrosine kinase 2b (PTK2b)), are non-receptor tyrosine kinases that possess distinct properties in addition to sharing functional and structural features (Hanks et al., 1992; Hall et al., 2011). There are four known isoforms for FAK but only the complete structures for PTK2 and PTK2b have been identified. FAK and Pyk2 have a closely similar sequence but Pyk2 upregulation is more limited compared to FAK (Lev et al., 1995; Avraham et al., 1995). The expression of Pyk2 is increased in brain cells and decreased in lung, kidney, liver and spleen cells (Avraham et al., 1995; Lev et al., 1995; Sasaki et al., 1995).

   8     

Protein tyrosine kinases play a vital role in the accumulation of signaling complexes, as scaffolding proteins and in transmitting cellular signals via subsequent downstream phosphorylation cascades (Sieg 1999; Sieg et al., 2000; Hall and Schaller, 2011). The stimulation of cytokine and growth factor receptors prompt FAK activation as well as integrin signaling (Sieg et al., 2000; Dunty et al., 2004; Hall and Schaller, 2011). The pathway of Pyk2 activation by calcium is unclear (Avraham et al., 2000). Similarly, Pyk2 is stimulated by cytokines and growth factors, under amplified cytosolic calcium concentrations in response to ligands like platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or vasopressin (activates PLC), leading to stimulation of Pyk2. Thus, PTKs are affected by extracellular stimuli (Lev et al., 1995). FAK deficient mice showed impaired ventricular septation, heart chambers and aortic arch formation, while the development of the nervous system in Xenopus laevis was also impaired with FAK deficiency (Doherty et al., 2010; Hakim et al., 2007; Forrest et al., 2009; DiMichele et al., 2009). FAK deficiency also caused defects in cellular proliferation, survival and migration, cardiomyocytes migration (Ward et al., 2007), differentiation of osteogenic cells (Wei et al., 2009), and nephron tubulogenesis in kidney (Guinamard et al., 2000). On the other hand, pyk2-/- exhibit significantly different roles. In mouse pyk2-/- knockouts were observed with normal fertility with no malformation, yet, the animals had observed defects in the immune system (low B cells) and humoral immune response. Furthermore, defective macrophages and osteoclasts in mice pyk2-/- knockouts have been observed (Guinamard et al., 2000). Yu et al. (2005) found that mice are more susceptible to obesity and insulin resistance when lacking pyk2. In vivo studies on macrophage cells with pyk2-/- mice have defects with cell motility and polarization as well as decreased diffusion of overall inflammatory stimuli (Okigaki et al., 2003).

1.1.5. Activation and Signaling
The Rho GTPases family is a major stimulator for actin cytoskeleton polymerization, spreading and cell adhesion (Ridley, 2011). The downstream signaling of Rho GTPases is achieved in the presence of FAK, vinculin and paxillin (focal adhesion proteins) (Fig. 3), with known members of the integrin family (1, 3) localized at focal contacts (Ridley, 2011). The knockdown of 1 and/or 3 integrin impaired the focal adhesion assembly and cell spreading on the ligand fibronectin (Costa et al., 2013). Phosphorylation of FAK occurs at various locations and, unlike other kinases (active when phosphorylated at the kinase domain), kinase activation can only account for a small portion of overall FAK functions (Schaller et al., 1994; Calalb et al., 1995; Arold et al., 2001). A major autophosphorylation site located at Tyr397 and found between the kinase and FERM domains has a significant scaffolding role for the SH2 domain in relation to SFKs stimulation (Fig. 2). The interactions between the SH2 and SH3 domains, PRI motifs and p- Tyr397 are mainly activated by SFKs (Arold et al., 2001; Schaller et al., 1994). In the case of Pyk2, a major phosphorylation site includes Tyr402 and Tyr881 which have similar SH2 and SH3 domain activation pathways (Avraham et al., 2000).

Figure 2. Focal adhesion kinase SH2 and SH3 binding site. (Obtained from Hall and Schaller, 2011).   

  10     

In figure 2, the position of proline-rich sites allows binding of SH2 and SH3 mediated scaffolding interactions with FAK. The yellow hexagons represent SH2 and the red hexagons represent SH3 activation factors which are recruited by SH2 and SH3 mediated binding. The phosphorylation of serine sites occurs in Ser722 via PP1 phosphatase and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (Bianchi et al., 2005). Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is responsible for Ser732 phosphorylation (Xie and Tsai, 2004; Park et al., 2009). In addition, Ser722 and Ser732 affect FAK catalytic activity by an undetermined pathway (Bianchi et al., 2005). Thus, there is a significant association of FAK serine phosphorylation in vivo, yet, the molecular machinery remains an open debate (Hall and Schaller, 2011). FAK signaling and function in relation to cancer cell survival and motility have been succinctly reviewed (Zhao and Guan, 2009; Hanks et al., 2003). FAK phosphorylation sites were stimulated by SFKs, such as tyrosines 577, 576, 861, and 925 (Fig. 3); however, Pyk2 has identical FAK phosphorylation sites at the tyrosines 402, 579, 580, 881, and they were activated by SFKs (Calalb et al., 1995; Avraham et al., 2000). Both Tyr576 and Tyr577 are located in the kinase domain, noticeably in the activation site (Bianchi et al., 2005). FAK-related nonkinase (FRNK) is located in the C-terminal in the noncatalytic domain of FAK and acts as a blocker for FAK by dislocating FAK from focal contacts and FRNK considered to be naturally occurring dominant-negative mutants (Richardson and Parsons, 1996; Gilmore and Romer, 1996). Accordingly, FRNK contains a proline-rich region at the C-terminal and also the FAT domain, and it is missing the FERM and kinase domains. As an important function, FRNK acts as a challenger to the focal adhesion site by pushing and suppressing away FAK binding seen in neonatal hearts (DiMichele et al., 2009; Gilmore and Romer, 1996). In the matter of the biological function and physiological regulation, it seems that FRNK has been extensively used to   11     

experimentally test for the role of FAK, and such a regulator was seen in heart growth. In addition, Pyk2 have similar FRNK mutants (DiMichele et al., 2009; Xiong et al., 1998). In FAK, the processing of the SH3 domain-containing protein into a complex is accomplished by the scaffolding of proline-rich regions. By this mechanism, Src binding is granted via the activation of scaffolding protein partners like GRAF, GTPase activating proteins, ASAP1, Hef1 and p130cas, and PSGAP (Fig. 3) (Guan, 2010). In a recent study by Guan (2010), SH3 was extensively reviewed in regards to FAK function in downstream signaling and SH3 domain rests on proline-rich sites of FAK.

Figure 3. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) domain schematic. (Obtained from Mitra et al., 2005).    In figure 3, the focal contacts show the integrins bound to cytoskeletal proteins like paxillin and talin recruiting FAK. The FERM domain allows interactions of FAK with the ETK, ezrin, the PDGF receptor and the EGF receptor. FAK contains three proline-rich regions (PRR), which bind to SH3   12     

domain-containing proteins such as the GTPase regulator associated with FAK (GRAF), p130Cas and the Arf-GTPase-activating protein ASAP1. The FAT domain links FAK to the activation of Rho GTPases by binding to p190 RhoGEF. There are several phosphorylation sites in FAK (e,g,, Tyr397, 407, 576, 577, 861 and 925), and for Pyk2 (e.g., Tyr402, 579, 580, 881). Tyr397 phosphorylation creates an SH2 binding site for p120 RasGAP, the GRB7 receptor, the Shc adaptor protein, PLC, and p85 (a subunit of PI3K). Also, FAK Tyr925 and Ty397 phosphorylation as well as Tyr881 and Tyr402 phosphorylation for Pyk2 forms a binding site for Grb2 and Src respectively. For a maximal FAK catalytical activity phosphorylation of Tyr576 and Tyr577 in the kinase domain is required (Fig. 3) (Mitra et al., 2005).

1.2. Atherosclerosis and Innate Immune Response
Although much research has been conducted to date, cardiovascular diseases are still the most common cause of heart disease in Western countries and becoming notable in underdeveloped countries (Alvarez-Llamas et al., 2008). A main player in the development of atherosclerosis disease is the immune system - specifically the innate immune response. In addition, the innate immune response can be the salvation of such a disease as well (Lundberg and Hansson, 2010). The four main members of known lipoproteins synthesized in the liver are chylomicrons, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (vLDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and these lipoproteins carry either dietary or endogenous lipids (Witztum and Steinberg, 1995). Chylomicrons are the first member of the lipoproteins that transport dietary lipids absorbed from the intestine to the liver. LDL (a phospholipid protein complex) carries cholesterol and triglycerides from the liver to peripheral tissues through the blood stream. A sufficient amount of plasma LDL can accumulate in the blood vessel arterial intima exposed to surface LDL receptor to be internalized by the immune cells (Witztum and Steinberg, 1995). The atherogenic effect is a form of chronic inflammation caused by interactions with monocytes differentiated to macrophages, T cells, atrial wall receptors and lipoproteins such as LDLs. This inflammation can eventually lead to plaque formation. Plaque is mainly described as a buildup of lipids and immune compartments such as macrophages, mast cells and T cells, together with fibrous connective tissue containing collagen (Hansson et al., 2006). The formation of plaque causes blockage of the arterial circulation and under high pressure may rupture and cause significant complications such as strokes and myocardial infarction (Navab et al., 1996; Epstein and Ross, 1999; Steinberg and Witztum, 1999). Plaque formation may also cause a narrowing of the lumen "stenosis" due to ischemic effects and to the neighboring tissue and necrotic cells   14     

surrounding the affected lesion (Hansson et al., 2006). In addition, rupturing of the plaque recruits coagulation factors and activates thrombosis. The thrombogenic cocktail (humoral coagulation and platelet aggregation) may give rise to thrombus formation leading to further complications such as myocardial and/or brain infarction (Hansson and Hermansson, 2011).

1.3. Oxidized Low Density Lipoproteins
Low-density lipoprotein has a hydrophilic complex of lipids and proteins, mostly apolipoprotien B100 (apoB100), along with a hydrophobic center holding cholesterol esters and triglycerides, with an LDL size of ~20-25 nm (Fig. 4) (BadimÃ³n et al., 2009). Once LDL interacts with extracellular matrix components, lipoprotein modification starts by oxidation, nitration, glycation, and alkylation (Yamada et al., 1998, Zingg et al., 2000). Some of the LDL can escape across the subendothelial space through blood vessels where LDL is chemically modified by an oxidation reaction mediated by nitric oxide, myeloperoxide, free radicals and lipoxygenase (Leeuwenburgh et al., 1997; Hazen, 1997). In other cases, proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes can also modify LDL thereby generating various forms of modified LDL (Oorni et al., 2000). This modification prevents LDL from being identified by LDL receptors which in turn attracts Class B scavenger CD36 to engulf oxidized LDL (oxLDL) via CD36-expressing macrophages (Yamada et al., 1998; Glass and Witztum, 2001). OxLDL receptors can fall into one of the following classes: CD36, SR-AI and SRAII, and LOX-1 or CXCL16. Other receptors such as the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP-1) found in monocytes, platelets and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), have been shown to internalize LDL aggregates but not the native aggregates (Endemann et al., 1993; Ramprasad et al., 1995; Sawamura et al., 1997; Llorente-cortes et al., 2000). At the site of a lesion, vascular inflammation can be caused by oxLDL damage to the vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (Wiesner et al., 2010; Maskrey et al., 2011). The kinase activity of p21 (activated   15     

kinase 1) has been shown to relate to the penetrability of LDL via the endothelial wall and is thought to be mediated by Ser/Thr kinase Akt and protein kinase G (Orr et al., 2007; Fryer et al., 2006).

Figure 4. Low-density lipoprotein structure. (Obtained from BadimÃ³n et al., 2009). Boullier et al. (2001) conducted an experiment between oxLDL phospholipids, the protein portion (apoB) and oxLDL itself, to observe the competition of those components with the CD36 binding site. Interestingly, high affinity binding was observed between the oxLDL phospholipids and apoB protein to the CD36 binding site compared to intact oxLDL (Boullier et al., 2001). oxLDL phospholipids and apoB protein could inhibit intact oxLDL binding to CD36 receptor by up to 80% (Terpstra et al., 1998). A main cause for the development of atherosclerotic plaque is the formation of foam cells and fatty streaks stimulated by oxLDL positive chemotactic activity for monocytes differentiated to macrophages (Matsuura et al., 2008). More importantly,   16     

insufficient uptake of trapped oxLDL in the presence of foam cells can lead to apoptosis that causes the release of cytokines in addition to untreated oxLDL (Glass and Witztum, 2001). The emission of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at lesion sites triggers additional oxidation of LDL and the release of cytokines stimulates T-cells such as Th1 and Th2 resulting in increased inflammation of the affected area (Hansson, 1997; Zingg et al., 2000; Glass and Witztum, 2001). A notable reduction of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) occurs in the presence of accumulated modified or native LDL due to stimulation of NO synthetase; however, NO degradation forms superoxide anions (O2-) radicals. This process can lead to the formation of cytotoxic peroxynitrite radicals through imbalanced NO/redox and O2- formation that inhibits NO under the influence of protein nitrosylation (Pritchard et al., 1995; Liao et al., 1995; Vidal et al., 1998; Schmidt and Alp, 2007). The release of ROS can be associated with endothelial stress and dysfunction leading to the progression of the disease.

  17     

1.4. Macrophage Scavenger CD36 receptor 1.4.1. Role in Atherosclerosis
To better understand the role of macrophages, researchers found a significant involvement of scavenger receptors, in regards to oxLDL removal and in mediating the cellular effect of oxidized lipoproteins. In addition, scavenger receptor function and gene expression in terms of their detailed regulatory mechanisms is still in intense debate. However, atherosclerosis dysregulatory mechanisms might be critically affected by the formation of foam cells. The knowledge of scavenger receptor function and gene expression could resolve and/or reduce the progression of atherosclerosis disease (Zingg et al., 2000). Scavenger receptors have a multitude of functions due to their nonspecific binding of ligands. According to Yamada (1998), scavenger receptor genes can be divided into six classes as follows: (1) Class A encompasses MARCO and SRAI/II; (2) Class B involves SR-B1/CLA-1 (ligand for HDL) and CD36 (Fig. 5); (3) Class C in dSR-CI; (4) Class D involves CD68/Macrosialin; (5) Class E consists of LOX-1; (6) Class F includes SREC and other receptors such as SRPSOX, FEEL-1 and FEEL-2 found with macrophages and non-macrophges cells as well (Yamada et al., 1998; Platt et al., 1998; Krieger, 1997). In earlier reports, foam cell formation and lipid accumulation were mainly mediated by oxLDL receptors CD36 and SR-AI/II; however, CD68 and MARCO are less commonly involved in this role (Yoshida et al., 1998; Podrez et al., 2000). The expression of CD36, SR-AI/II and SR-BI receptors are elevated at the site of the atherogenic effect and the receptors expressed for smooth muscles cells (SMCs) are LOX-1 and CD36 (Kataoka et al., 1999; Nakata et al., 1999; Gough et al., 1999; Ricciarelli et al., 2000). The oxLDL and acetylated LDL (acLDL) uptake is stimulated by lack ofdd SR-AI/II receptors with a 30% and 80% decrease respectively, and thus, the oxLDL clearance is suggested by other   18     

scavenger receptors (Lougheed et al., 1997). Serum triacylglycerol, cholesterol and free fatty acids (non-esteried) have been shown to be elevated by a lacking of the CD36 receptor (Febbraio et al., 1999). The expression of scavenger receptors (triggered by modified lipoprotein) are initiated mainly in macrophages, kupffer cells (in the liver) and dendritic cells as specialized phagocytes. On the other hand, non-specialized phagocytes are known to be endothelial cells, neuronal cells, keratinocytes and aortic smooth muscle cells (Zingg et al., 2000).

1.4.2. Structure of CD36
The structure of CD36 is related to the class B scavenger receptor and was initially known as platelet glycoprotein III b/IV. It contains 472 amino acids and is 88 kDa and highly N-glycosylated. It falls in the band 11.2 of chromosome 7 with quite short sequences and has an extracellular domain with cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. In other words, CD36 is highly hydrophilic with two hydrophobic domains in the plasma membrane and two cysteine residue sites for palmitoylation in each tail (Tao et al., 1996; Xiao Hua Yu, 2013). The CD36 receptor has a high attraction to oxLDL, binding between the amino acids 155 and 183 and other reported binding sites (amino acids 28-93 and/or 120-155) (Xiao Hua Yu 2013; Handberg et al., 2012). Studies have shown that some alleles of CD36 can be a risk factor for the initiation of atherosclerosis (591T allele) or can reduce the incidence of such a disease (573A allele) (Rac et al., 2012).

1.4.3. Signaling of CD36
In a study involving rats, CD36 showed a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid palmitate via thioester association to cysteine residues (Gao et al., 2012). However, alteration with the 14-carbon saturated fatty acid myristate seems to palmitate proteins at the cytoplasmic portion and not at the membrane site. In monocytes, increased CD36 expression is linked to palmitate via de novo ceramide production (Gao et al., 2012). Additionally, palmitoylated proteins are also   19     

engaged with the Src family nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, the -subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and the G protein linked receptors (Sefton and Buss, 1987; Schlesinger et al., 1994; Milligan et al., 1995). Thus, attachment of palmitate to proteins could help in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions and in protein-membrane interactions (Tao et al., 1996). The highly elevated CD36 monocyte expression can be inhibited by atorvastatin treatment for patients who have developed with acute coronary disease (Piechota et al., 2012). The accumulation of macrophages (CD36) in the atrial intima exposed to fluid phase oxLDL is thought to activate FAK (Park et al., 2009). In a recent report, non-diabetic healthy individuals showed plasma CD36 associated with fatty liver, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis markers (Handberg et al., 2012). In vivo studies involving mice have provided cases where atherosclerotic lesions with elevated aortic sinus due to foam cells were initiated by CD36 or SR-A lacking in apoE-/- mice, even with noticeable peritoneal macrophage reduction (Moore et al., 2005). However, decreased CD36 expression in apoE-/- mice can be maintained with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in walnut and antioxidants (Nergiz-Unal et al., 2013). In other cases, postprandial hyperlipidemia can be reduced by anti-CD36 activity to avoid progression to atherosclerosis (Geloen et al., 2012). To reduce further damage to the arterial wall due to apoptotic formation in relation to oxLDL accumulation, antioxidants such as resveratrol and vitamins C and E have been suggested (Sugawa et al., 1997; Draczynska-Lusiak et al., 1998). Various reports on clinical trials associate atherosclerosis progression with CD36deficient patients (Yuasa-Kawase et al., 2012) and thus more investigations are needed to determine the role of CD36/oxLDL. In human platelets, integrins like IIb3 and 61 and tetraspanin CD9 are known to associate with macrophage CD36 (Thorne et al., 2000; Miao et al., 2001).   20     

Upregulation of CD36 involved with modified LDLs and peroxisome proliferator activated the receptor- (PPAR-) ligand (Okazaki et al., 2008; Chiurchiu et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011; Granados-Principal et al., 2012). Depending on different cell type expression, signaling of CD36 seems to recruit different kinases (Prieto et al., 1994). In particular, participation of focal adhesion kinases and Rho GEFs, which signals CD36 to perform degradation, active migration internalization and binding regulation (Prieto et al., 1994). CD36 can be reduced considerably with treatment by tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) and interferon  combined (Chu et al., 2013). FAK activates actin polymerization and is thought to have an impact on macrophage aggregation and foam cell formation in the arterial intima (Park et al., 2009). In other studies, cytoskeleton formation was stimulated by CD36 signaling to activate the phosphorylation cascade in order to polymerize actin via the scaffolding protein paxillin, FAK, Pyk2, Fyn and p130Cas (Stuart et al., 2007; Park et al., 2009) (Fig. 1). In earlier studies, upon exposure to oxLDL in the presence of CD36 in atrial intima, phosphorylation in the Vav family members of guanine nucleotide exchange factor is stimulated, and in the case with Vav deletion, then observed decline of foam cell formation and oxLDL uptake (Rahaman et al., 2006; Prieto et al., 1994). Additionally, lower CD36 expression can be achieved by inhibition of the c-Jun/activator protein (AP-1) using kaempferol inhibitor (Li et al., 2013). According to Bochem et al. (2013) an essential protein ABCA1 (a member of ABC gene transporters superfamily) influences the reduction of foam cell formation in atherosclerosis since ABCA1 is a main HDL lipoprotein. Absence of proatherogenic lipoproteins can play a role since the lack of ABCA1 in mice along with SR-BI showed low levels of foam cell buildup and decreased cholesterol levels with no sign of atherogenic effect (Zhao et al., 2011). The involvement of CD36 in C32 melanoma cells is linked to tetraspanin CD51 and integrins like 31 and 61 (Thorne et al., 2000; Miao et al., 2001).   21     

Febbraio et al. (2000) found that CD36 apo E-null mice decreased the calculated surface area of aorta lesion by more than 76%, and apo E-double null mice presented lower levels in weight gain, cholesterol and triacylglycerol (Su et al., 2005). Studies on different species of rodents and rats were unsatisfactory regarding inhibited SR-BI (Demetz et al., 2012). The study by Demetz et al. (2012) implied that atherosclerotic rats treated with silencing RNA targeted to SR-BI resulted in a reduction in atherosclerotic lesions compared to control rodents. Activation of FAK can be established through CD36 stimulation of free radical release via NADPH oxidase in the presence of oxLDL due to the down-regulation of SHP-1 (Park et al., 2009). Phospholipase C (PLC) is stimulated via tyrosine kinase phosphorylation because of its presence on the platelet lipid portion along with CD36; however, little evidence exists for a straight linkage concerning CD36 and PLC (Gousset et al., 2004). Another protein tyrosine kinase family like Lyn, Fyn and Yes might contribute in CD36 signaling activated by ligand binding in platelet (Huang et al., 1991). Other known CD36 up regulators found with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and macrophage colony stimulating factor, and IL-4 are thought to activate 12/15-lipoxigenase expression and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) (Yesner et al., 1996; Li et al., 2009; Hashizume and Mihara, 2012; Zhao et al., 2012). The SR-BI expression can be stimulated by the transcriptional factor PPAR in a PPAR/LXR-dependent pathway via a resveratrol (Res) supplement (Yang et al., 2011). The engulfment of oxLDL can be enhanced by the elevated expression of CD36 via PPAR combined with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) pathway (Rahaman et al., 2006). The down regulation of PPAR can be triggered by mulberry leaf polyphenol extract (MLPE) leading to macrophage SR-A reduction (Yang et al., 2011). Thus, Res and MLPE can play a role in the regulation of oxLDL uptake through up and down CD36 expression. Decreased   22     

CD36 expression seen in THP-1 magrophages might be linked to the stimulation of TGF-1,2 that triggers mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinases) and in turn deactivates PPAR- (Han et al., 2000). In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, phospholipase D (PLD) activation has been linked to the bacteria by their macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, regulated partially by CD36, and negative straight connection of PLD with CD36 (Kusner et al., 1996). Increased production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in platelets and monocytes was seen in cases were activation of TNF- occurred due to the stimulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) when monoclonal antibodies were cross-linked with CD36 (Aiken et al., 1990; Lipsky et al., 1997). OxLDL-coated surfaces were thought to influence macrophages releasing triple times the amount of H2O2 compared to uncoated oxLDL particles (Maxeiner et al., 1998).

1.5. The Fc Gamma Receptor
The immune system is stimulated by foreign antigens and is carried out by the innate and the adaptive immune divisions. Fc receptors adopt antibodies that are generated by innate immune cells and these cells are directed by an adaptive immune system that shows a tight connection between both parts of the immune system (Cheeseman, 2006). The Fc gamma receptor (FcR) is usually activated by its ligand immunoglobulin G (IgG) coating foreign particles through binding to the fragment crystal (Fc) region of IgG in a process known as phagocytosis (Jankowski et al., 2008; Cheeseman, 2006). The FcR family is comprised of three main classes: (1) FcRI and FcRIII (activators); (2) FcRII (inhibitor) and (3) low affinity FcR subclasses such as FcRIIA, FcRIIB, FcRIIC, FcRIIIA, and FcRIIIB (Fig 5) (Van Lent et al., 2001; Takai, 2002). Jankowski (2008) successfully captured activated Fc- receptors directly from the surface of live cells using the IgG ligand. Human FcRs are leukocytic surface glycoproteins with different affinities for IgG (Jankowski et al., 2008). The novel technique to isolate FcRs and their immune complexes is known as live-cell affinity receptor chromatography (LARC). Following the isolation of FcRs using mass spectrometry, protein peptides scores were correlated to proteins and captured from receptor complexes (Jankowski et al., 2008). FcRs are incorporated in the phagocytosis of antigens coated with IgG, cytokine generation, removal of immune complexes and other immune tasks (Ravetch and Bolland, 2001). Following IgG ligand binding, FcRs are activated and phosphorylated at the tyrosine based stimulation motifs. Activation of FcRs promotes phosphorylation and recruits proteins like Syk and Src family kinases, protein kinase C (PKC), Rho-family GTPases, diacylglycerol (DAG), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)trisphosphate (PIP3) (Araki, 1996; Botelho et al., 2000; Larsen et al., 2002; Swanson   24     

and Hoppe, 2004; Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2006). Activation of the actin cytoskeleton is also implied with FcR binding to ligands and elements to the actin cytoskeleton remodeling are poorly illustrated (Kodama et al., 2004; Marshall et al., 2001). In human macrophages, FAK phosphorylation was suggested to link with Fc receptor- mediated phagocytosis (Greenberg et al., 1994). Upon Fc receptor activation, SFKs are phosphorylated on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). ITAM motifs are suggested to phosphorylate two tyrosines which on the other hand stimulate Syk family kinases via the binding to two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains in Src and Syk (Underhill and Goodridge, 2007). ITAMs are also involved with FcRIIA and FcRIIIB (Hogarth, 2002). In humans FcRIIIB expressed in neutrophils is anchored with glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI). In murine, FcRIIA is connected with a single polypeptide ITAM (Hogarth, 2002). Thus, at the genetic level human and murine ITAM motifs show a dissimilar relation to Fc receptors (Hogarth, 2002). In earlier studies the formation of phagosome vacuoles was activated through the initiation of phosphorylation cascades that controls actin polymerization, membrane remodeling, ROS generation and other processes (Aderem and Underhill, 1999; Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002). In vitro studies show that ITAM motif-related FcRs are also connected to the ROS released from neutrophils during activation (Underhill and Goodridge, 2007; Tsuboi et al., 2008). The stimulation of calciumdependent Pyk2 seems to depend on ITAMs through the regulation of the cytokine receptor Jak-Signal transducer and the activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) pathway with interferon (Ivashkiv, 2009; Dhodapkar et al., 2007). A recent study shows a strong relation of CD36 with FcR when activated (Heit et al., 2013). Using an immunoprecipitation technique, Heit et al (2013) found that upon CD36 activation, Tetraspanins (CD9 and CD81) and integrins (1 and 2) were involved and known to interact with ITAM motifs in relation to FcR intercellular portion. In addition, Src and Syk activation was reported when CD36 was coupled to ITAMs leading to the internalization of CD36-related ligands (Heit et al., 2013).   25     

In mice macrophages FcRIIA related ITAM activation had demonstrated a role in autoimmune diseases (such as arthritis) (Tsuboi et al., 2008). In contrast, in vivo FcRIIIB showed no sign of toxicity other than a build-up in the affected tissue (Tsuboi et al., 2008). A report in murine macrophages observed no elevation of p125Fak phosphorylation in a phagocytic FcR-dependent manner (Pan et al., 1999). Phagocytosis in human neutrophils was observed with the stimulation of kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK1 or MAP2K1) cross-linked with FcR (Karimi and Lennartz, 1998; Mansfield et al., 2000). Other proteins like phospholipase D (PLD) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) are stimulated during FcRmediated phagocytosis in human macrophages and were thought to increase phagocytosis signals connected to the regulation of leukotrienes generation (Lennartz et al., 1997; Kusner et al., 1999; Mancuso et al., 2001). The Rac member of Rho-family GTPase and members of the Vav family of nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are part of the immune complexes that show involvement with Fc receptors (Cox et al., 1997; Massol et al., 1998; Castellano et al., 2000; Garcia-Garcia and Rosales, 2002). Rac is thought to be a major cytoskeletal shape-remodeling player (Patel et al., 2002). It has been concluded that members of Vav also play an activation sequence scenario in FcR. The Vav dominant negative mutant studies showed impaired macrophage engulfment of IgG-coated particles at the time of phagocytosis (Patel et al., 2002). In Zhang et al. (2010) the main focus was on applying different IgG densities on coated particles. Low IgG-density coated particles were less efficiently engulfed by phagocytic cells with reduced concentrations of 3 phosphoinositides (3PI) and insignificant concentrations of PKC being observed. On the other hand, high IgGdensity coated particles showed increased levels of FcR presenting, suggesting a role of PIP3-drived 3PI in phagocytosis (Zhang et al., 2010). The stimulation of PKC and

  26     

PLC proteins is by PI3K activation that plays a role in phagocytosis initiation (Larsen et al., 2000; Melendez et al., 1999; Greenberg and Grinstein, 2002). Lee et al. (2007) found a relation of adaptor molecule Crk and a dedicator of cytokinesis (Dock180) to phagocytosis when knockdown with silencing RNA occurred. The Crk silenced protein altered the engulfment of IgG-coated particles in RAW264.7 macrophages cells (Lee et al., 2007). Giodini et al. (2009) conducted an experiment with a non-typical phagocytic 293T cell line and demonstrated that, in the cross-presentation of FcRIIA, a remarkable influence on the phagocytic efficiency of IgG-coated partials occurred. Thus, Fc receptors are a key player in phagocytosis and in internalization of particles.

2. RATIONAL AND CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS
Proteomic studies have been dedicated to plasma biomarkers advances. Key efforts have focused towards this purpose, while currently other proteomic methodologies still represent a minor proportion of the existing atherosclerosis studies. One of the more recent methods to identify protein receptor complexes has been used by Marshall's group which involves liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LCÂ­MS/MS) to quantify the isolated proteins by their peptide fragments ionized in an electrospray ionization (ESI) mode (Jankowski et al., 2008). An assumption of this study is that if focal adhesion kinases (FAKs) or protein tyrosine kinases were involved in cell immune response communication processes, then FAKs are more likely to be identified in relation to receptor complexes by mass spectrometry. Silencing RNA, confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence techniques were introduced to FAKs in order to confirm the LARC data obtained by LC-MS/MS, as well as to study FAKs regulatory role in IgG and oxLDL mediated phagocytosis. A quantitative analysis of phagocytosis and FAKs localization after siRNA knockdown will also strengthen the hypothesis of FAKs association with phagocytosis. Knowledge about the complex links between ligand binding, FAK interaction and localization will provide an understanding in regards to FAK role in current immune diseases.

  28     

3. GENERAL OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to determine the presence of protein tyrosine kinases specifically associated with the activated phagocytic receptor complexes in human U937 macrophages.

3.1. Study Goals
   The goals of this study were as Follows: 1. Confirm protein tyrosine kinases presence in U937 cells detected by Mass Spectrometry. 2. Compare and calculate the phagocytosis efficiency of IgG and oxLDL coated beads assays in U937-treated siRNA (PTK2 & PTK2b) cells. 3. Inhibit PTKs (FAKs) using pharmacological inhibitors. 4. Confirm the knockdown and show the localization of PTK2 (FAK) and PTK2b (Pyk2) in U937 cells by Immunostaining and confirm the presence of PTK2 and PTK2b by Western Blotting (Appendix. B).

  29     

4. MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1. Cell Culture
Macrophage human U937 cells purchased from American Type culture Collections (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), were incubated with RPMI 1640 medium with Lglutamine (Mediatech, Manassas, VA, USA) at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

4.2. Pharmacological inhibitors
PF 573228 (FAKs inhibitor) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The PF drug inhibitor was used to compare the phagocytic inhibition with PTK2 and PTK2b silencing RNA knockdown experiments.

4.3. Antibodies
Monoclonal anti-FAK (clone 4.47) and polyclonal anti-Pyk2 were purchased from Upstate-Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA, USA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Cu2+oxidized human lipoprotein antibody was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA, USA). Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin was purchased from Invitrogen.

4.4. Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein Preparation
Human plasma (EDTA-treated) was ultracentrifuged in a TLA110 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 100 000 rpm at 4Â°C for 1 hour, to extract the low-density lipoprotein band using KBr to achieve a density of 1.30 g/ml and layered with NaCl 1.006 g/ml. The band was collected in a dialysis cassette "slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette" (Thermo   30     

Scientific, USA), and was dialyzed extensively overnight in PBS including 0.5 mM EDTA. LDL was then oxidized with 5 ÂµM CuSO4 in 37Â°C for 18 hours in dark. The oxidation of LDL was terminated with a fresh PBS containing 40 ÂµM butylated hydroxytoluene and 0.3 mM EDTA. The termination of oxidation was carried out for ~6 h at 4Â°C in dark. After termination, oxLDL was dialyzed extensively at 4Â°C in dark for 24 h. The oxLDL was then collected in eppendorf tubes and stored at 4Â°C in dark (Shen et al., 2008).

4.5. Silencing RNA
Silencing RNA cy3-tagged for PTK2 and PTK2b was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The knockdown of PTK2 and PTK2b with siRNA was established to evaluate the phagocytic efficiency of macrophage cells against coated microbeads and to compare with PF drug inhibitor experiments.

4.6. SEQUEST Association of Proteins Specific for Fc and CD36 Ligands
Marshall's lab identified protein receptor complexes in relation to U937 macrophages via the LARC protocol using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) (unpublished data). The LARC protocol was performed by Dr. John G. Marshall using sucrose gradient to isolate the beads after U937 cells were French pressed and using a step gradient of NaCl to isolate the complex, and digest the proteins in the NaCl fractions with trypsin before injecting to the MS. The proteins ionized and recorded by full MS were followed by matching the protein peptide sequences via SEQUEST algorithm to a non-redundant library of protein peptides. On the side, beads were incubated with growth media or crude cell lysates, and were used as a control to compare with proteins associated with LARC. To avoid false positive results, controls were injected alongside LARC samples to account for non-specific binding of proteins to naked beads incubated with crude lysate and/or growth culture medium. Following the identification of LARC proteins, silencing RNA, drug inhibitors assays and immunofluorescence staining were visualized via the confocal microscopy to quantify phagocytosis efficiency, and were applied to verify and confirm the functional role of proteins directly associated with U937 macrophages receptor mediated phagocytosis.

  32     

4.7. Silencing RNA transfection assay
U937 cells were cultured in a 75 cm2 culture flask for 72 hours to reach a confluency of 60-80%, cells were then centrifuged for 4 min at 3500 rpm, and fresh RPMI media enriched with 10% FBS was added. Cover slips (2.5cm) were placed in 6-well culture plate, followed by adding 3-6 drops of the 60-80% confluent cells in wells containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to differentiate the cells (Georgetown, ON) with a final concentration of 100 nM/well. The PMA treated cells were incubated in 37Â°C (5% CO2) for 72 hours. After 72 hours of incubation, cells treated with PMA were washed three times with fresh media. Cells were then transfected with siRNA (short interfering doublestranded RNA) (look for sequence above), using the transfection reagent XtremeGENE (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The controls used for the transfection experiment were scrambled siRNA to serve as a negative control. Non-treated cells served as a positive control. The scrambled siRNA was used as a control and was mixed with the X-tremeGENE reagent. Both siRNA and the transfection reagent were diluted with serum free (SF) RPMI media prior to mixing. Similarly, the siRNAs for PTKs were diluted with SF media before mixing with SF diluted X-tremeGENE solution. The master mix of the X-tremeGENE solution containing siRNA for each condition was incubated for 20 min. The master mix was then added to the cells and incubated for 72 hours.

  33     

4.8. Coated-beads Assay 4.8.1. Ligand Coated-beads Preparation
Polystyrene micro-beads were purchased from Bangs Laboratories Inc. (Fisher, IN, USA), and were used to prepare IgG and oxLDL coated-beads. The microbeads stock contains 10% (v/v) suspension ~2.185-E10/ml and a size of 2 Âµm. From the beads stock, 1.5 Âµl was added to 500 Âµl phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) containing 3 Âµl of 1 mg/ml IgG stock, and 4 Âµl of oxLDL stock against 1.5 Âµl of beads/well in 500 Âµl PBS. Both of the prepared ligands were incubated for 30 min in a Ferris-wheel. After incubating for 30 min, ligand coated-beads were centrifuged (micro-centrifuge) at 12 000-14 000 rpm and washed four times to clear nonattached ligands. A final volume of 100 Âµl PBS was added to the pelleted coated-beads.

4.8.2. Coated-beads Internalization Assay
Following cell transfection a IgG coated-beads internalization assay was performed in a media condition consisting of RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS. The oxLDL coated-beads internalization assay was performed in three different conditions as follows: (1) RPMI with 10% FBS; (2), serum free RPMI and (3) HEPES buffer. Both the IgG and oxLDL beads internalization assays were incubated with cover slips for 2 hours.

After the cells were transfected with the siRNA for 72 hours, fresh medium was added to the wells. The prepared IgG and oxLDL beads were dispersed to the wells and incubated for 2 hours at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. Washing of the cover slips was followed with ice-cold PBS terminating phagocytosis beads internalization assay. Cells were then fixed by appling 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min in a rocker shaker. The fixation process was terminated by adding 5% glycine   34     

prepared in PBS for 5 min and washed three times. Cover slips were incubated with blocking solution containing 1% donkey serum and 5% skim milk prepared in PBS for 30 min. After blocking, cover slips containing IgG coated-beads were labeled with cy5-conjugated donkey anti-human antibody (1:10 000) for 30 min incubated in the dark. For cover slips containing oxLDL coated-beads, primary rabbit anti-Cu2+ human lipoprotein antibody (1:25) was incubated for 30-45 min. Following cover slips incubation with the primary antibody, secondary cy5conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:10 000) was added for 30 min in the dark. Thereafter, cover slips for both treatments were washed five times with PBS and mounted with Dako medium (Dako, Carpentaria, CA, USA). The laser confocal microscope was used for imaging of the prepared slides.

4.9. Immunofluorescence Assay
The staining for permeablized cells was performed in order to verify the localization of FAK and Pyk2 knockdown by siRNA experiments. The antibodies for FAK (monoclonal) and Pyk2 (polyclonal) were used for cell staining to a new set of 6-well plates containing siRNA U937 cells seeded on coverslips with only HEPES buffer treated with oxLDL beads for 2 hours. The siRNA treatments were as follows: scrambled control; scrambled with only secondary antibody control; treatment control; PTK2 siRNA and PTK2b siRNA. As mentioned above, siRNA treated U937 cells on cover slips were incubated with oxLDL beads for 2 hours followed by ice-cold washing and fixing for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and termination of fixing with 5% glycine for 5 min. Blocking solution was added for 30 min with either 1% donkey or 1% goat serum depending on the different antibody clones and suitable secondary Cy5-conjugated (donkey antimouse or goat anti-rabbit) antibody. Cells then underwent permeabilization with the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The primary antibody for FAK and Pyk2 was then added to the cover slips in a dilution of 1.5:25 for 1 hour. The secondary antibody was added in 1:5000 dilution for 1 hour. As mentioned above for one of the   35      no siRNA

controls, the secondary antibody was added without the primary antibody. Cover slips were then washed three times and a final staining step was performed by adding phalloidin green color for 45 min to 1 hour. Cover slips were then mounted to microscopic slides for imaging by laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta).

4.10.

Microscopic Imaging

Images of the microscopic slides prepared for cells binding to IgG or oxLDL beads and cells immunostaining of FAK and Pyk2 were captured by a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta scanning confocal microscope containing Ar 488-nm, He/Ne 543-nm and He/Ne 633nm lasers. The images were reviewed using Zeiss LSM Image Browser and the Image J program to count the number of beads for single cells and the intensity of protein localization. The total number of beads was subtracted from the outside number of beads giving the number of engulfed beads per cell using Microsoft (MS) ExcelÂ®. The number of engulfed beads were divided by the total number of beads to determine phagocytic efficiency for an average of a 100-cell count per treatment. Average cell intensity values for protein localization in negative treatments were compared with protein localization in knockdown treatments. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine phagocytic efficiency and protein localization intensity for U937-treated cells.

4.11.

Western Blotting

U937 cells were seeded into a 75 cm2 flask treated with 100 nM PMA in RPMI media enriched with 10 % FBS for 72 hours. The cells were washed three times with PBS and scraped. The scraped cells were then collected and added to 400 ÂµL 2 Ã sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) tricine sample buffer and warmed to 65Â°C for 10 min. The protein concentration was assessed by the Dumbroff Dotblot protein assay. The SDS tricine samples were then centrifuged for 10-30 sec to pellet DNA before loading the samples. Samples were then loaded to the   36     

wells of 9% SDS-PAGE with a total protein concentration of 30 mg per well and left for 1:30 hours in 125 V. Colored ladder PiNK plus Prestained Protein (FroggaBio, ON, Canada) was loaded as a control. The gel protein bands were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PVDF) (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The PVDF membrane was then blocked with 5% skim milk, 0.1 % Tween and either 1% goat or donkey serum in PBS for 30 min. The antibodies for FAK and Pyk2 were then added in 1:100 and 1:1000 concentrations respectively. Next, peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody were added at a 1:10 000 concentration. The enhanced chemiluminescece (ECL) solution containing 0.125 mM luminol, 0.1 M Tris/HCl pH 8.8, 7.7 mM H2O2 and 2 mM 4-iodopheylboronic acid was used to enhance protein bands. Images for protein bands were taken by BIORAD ChemiDoc XRS.

4.12.

Pharmacological Inhibitor Assay

Human U937 cells were added in 6-well containing coved slips (2.5cm) treated with 100 nM PMA in growth media for 72 hours. Cover slips were washed three times with PBS and fresh media was added. PF 573228 FAKs drug inhibitor stock was resuspended in DMSO and added to the wells for 1 hour with concentrations ranging from 0.1-10 ÂµM and a final concentration of DMSO containing PF of <0.1% per well. OxLDL or IgG coated beads were then added for 2 hours directly after drug treatment. Cover slips were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Fixation was the terminated with 5% glycine for 5 min and blocking with 1% donkey serum plus 5% skim milk powder in PBS for 30 min. For oxLDL, primary rabbit anti-oxLDL antibody (1:25) was added for 30-45 min. Beads were then stained with either secondary cy5-conjugated donkey anti-human or donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:10 000) for 30 min in the dark. Cover slips were washed five times with PBS and mounted with Dako medium.

5. RESULTS
5.1. Mass Spectrometry Protein Tyrosine Kinases Detection
The LARC experiment was performed for capturing proteins attached to the ligands IgG and oxLDL mediated phagocytosis in U937 macrophages by Dr. John G. Marshall (unpublished data). The proteins detected by LARC were manually reviewed in order to choose the most suspected proteins involved in phagocytosis. Protein tyrosine kinases were among other kinases in the MS list of detected proteins with considerable numbers of peptide scores in correlation to the parent proteins matched by the SEQUEST library database adopted from mass spectrometry. Specific gene isoforms for PTKs including PTK2 and PTK2b were chosen from the list of tyrosine kinases to be further investigated by independent analytical methods as mentioned above. The LARC protocol was used to identify the proteins interacting with the Fc and CD36 receptor complexes in U937 macrophages. The presence of PTKs in ligand receptor complexes was first suggested by the mass spectrometric data in correlation to PTKs peptide fragments (Table. 1) (Appendix. A). The calculated number of peptide scores for PTK2 and PTK2b are shown in Table 1 with different treatments and controls. The treatments used in Table 1 were as follows: (1) LARC-IgG; (2) LARC-IgG-control; (3) LARC-IgG-Media-beads; (4) LARC-oxLDL; (5) LARCoxLDL-control; (6) LARC-oxLDL-Media-beads; (7), LARC-AntiCD36-IgA; (8) LARC-AntiCD36-IgA-control and (9) LARC-Uncoated-beads-Extract. The LARCIgG and LARC-oxLDL in Table 1 represents the peptide scores of PTK2 and PTK2b identified by the mass spectrometry reverse phase column in which IgG or oxLDL beads were incubated with live U937 cells. The controls for LARC-IgG and LARCoxLDL were accomplished by incubating each of the IgG and oxLDL beads with crude homogenates from U937 cells and, in most of the cases, the controls show lower PTKs peptide scores indicating a unique detection of PTKs and thus   38     

eliminating false positive results (Table 1). The LARC-IgG-Media-beads and LARCoxLDL-Media-beads columns represent PTKs peptide scores derived from the media used to incubate IgG or oxLDL beads with U937 cells. The column with LARCUncoated-beads-Extract represents peptide scores when naked-beads were mixed with crude homogenates of cells. The LARC-AntiCD36-IgA shows the relationship between PTKs and the CD36 receptor when IgA coated-beads were incubated with live U937 cells. However, lower protein hits was seen in the LARC-AntiCD36-IgAcontrol. Thereafter, protein tyrosine kinases were selected depending on the highest scores of LARC IgG and oxLDL in live cells, as mentioned above, in comparison to their controls. Table 1. The protein tyrosine kinases peptide scores from mass spectrometry.

5.2. Phagocytosis Efficiency Assays in silenced RNA U937 cells
In order to determine whether PTKs are truly involved in phagocytosis, the cells were treated with either an siRNA directed at PTKs or a scrambled siRNA. Beads internalized by cells were then counted.

5.2.1. Beads Internalization in RPMI (10%FBS) Media 5.2.1.1. IgG Coated-beads
The IgG coated microspheres were incubated for 2 hours with PMA treated U937 cells after siRNA knockdown. An initial manual count of 150 cells per treatment for scrambled control, no treatment, PTK2 siRNA, PTK2b siRNA, and an extra treatment of both PTK2 and PTK2b silenced U937 in one well (see Fig. 6). The Experiment was replicated three times (Appendix. D-F).

U937 Cells were seeded to a 6-well plate and treated with PMA (100 nM) for 72 hours. SiRNAs were added for scrambled control, PTK2, PTK2b and both (PTK2 & 2B) treatments for 72 hours. Non-treated cells were left as a positive control. Human IgG-coated beads were then incubated with siRNA-treated and non-treated U937 cells for 2 hours. Cells were then fixed, blocked, tagged with Cy5-cojugated donkey anti-human IgG antibody and then mounted to microscopic slides to be imaged using confocal microscopy. The LSM images of cells were processed and counted using the Image J program. The total number of beads was subtracted from the outside (Cy5 tagged) beads in order to get the total number of engulfed beads per cells, using Excel software. The average phagocytosis efficiency was then calculated by the total number of beads and divided by the number of engulfed beads per cell. The following treatments were counted for 150 cells per treatment and the experiment was replicated in three independent days. Table 2 shows the average number of IgG beads internalized in U937 cells.

5.4. U937 Immunostaining and Western Blotting
PMA treated U937 cells were permeablized and treated with antibodies against FAK (PTK2) and Pyk2 (PTK2b). The staining of the cells was performed in order to visually identify the localization of PTK2 and PTK2b and to determine the intensity of the proteins in silenced RNA cells (Fig. 16). A one-way ANOVA was used to compare the overall Cy5 (blue channel) intensity for the negative treatments and Cy5 intensity for the PTK2 and PTK2b siRNA treatments (Appendix. U & W). A regression analysis was also performed to identify the relation of Cy5 intensity against Cy3 (red channel) intensity in order to report variations in knockdown treatments against protein localization intensity for PTK2 and PTK2b (Appendix. V & X). Western blots were performed in order to identify the presence of PTK2 and PTK2b in bands ~125 KDa and ~116 KDa, respectively. Similar to immunostaining antibodies, monoclonal anti-Fak (1:100) and polyclonal anti-Pyk2 (1:1000) antibodies were used on SDS-PAGE containing differentiated cell lysate samples (Fig. 15).

6. DISCUSSION
6.1. Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometric Significance
Over the last decade proteomic studies have been evolving and have provided data resulting in more complicated hypothesis and theories of protein existence and interpretation in human body. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is considered to be one of the more sensitive techniques that can detect attomolar amounts by their Mass to Charge (m/z) ratio. Proteomic studies were introduced to LC-MS and have shown great promise since MS can ionize and detect down to three peptides from the parent protein by quadrupole mass analyzer with electrospray ionization to form a fragment ion spectra (Aebersold and Goodlett, 2001). This study was solely dependent on the initial interpretations of protein receptor complexes successfully captured by live cell affinity receptor chromatography (LARC) protocol and analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Protein tyrosine kinases were one of many protein kinases that were detected by LARC via MS in U937-mediated phagocytosis. The peptide scores relevant to PTKs were associated to their abundance in immune complexes. LARC control treatments for non-specific interaction provided by the media or uncoated beads extracts assessed the presence of PTK2 and PTK2b in relation to ligand mediated phagocytosis. The controls for non-specific protein binding, such as naked beads incubated with crude homogenate, had a lower peptide scores for PTKs compared to LARC (such as LARC-oxLDL) samples and are thus mandatory to avoid or reduce any false positive results accounted for PTKs (Table 1). We were able to successfully confirm the validity and specificity of mass spectrometric PTK interpretations via independent analytical proteomics techniques. Thus, protein tyrosine kinases can significantly influence the phagocytic functions of immune U937 macrophages cells; therefore, mass spectrometry is considered to be a reliable method for detecting proteins and their correlated peptides among the wide scale of proteomic techniques.   58     

6.2. Role of Protein Tyrosine Kinases in U937 Phagocytosis
   The phagocytosis efficiency experiments indicated by siRNA transfection, immunostaining and pharmacological inhibitors assays were implemented to confirm the presence of protein tyrosine kinases and to support LARC-mass spectrometric interpretations.

6.2.1. IgG-beads Association with PTKs in Phagocytosis
The Fc gamma receptor (FcR) is triggered by immunoglobulin G (IgG) ligand covering antigen particles via binding to the Fc portion of IgG, a process referred to as phagocytosis (Jankowski et al., 2008; Cheeseman, 2006). Our results on PTK2, PTK2b, and both (PTK2 & PTK2b) siRNA knockdown in relation to the Fc gamma receptor and its ligand IgG did not show any significant effect on phagocytosis efficiency of U937 macrophages (p >0.05) (Appendix. D-E). The IgG-coated beads were only incubated with U937 in one media condition of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS for 2 hours (Fig. 5). Greenberg et al. (1994) suggested that in human macrophages FAK phosphorylation was thought to connect with FcRs-mediated phagocytosis. However, in a later study by Pan et al. (1999) FcR-mediated phagocytosis showed no increase of p125Fak phosphorylation in mice macrophages. The activation of Pyk2 via the cytokine receptor Jak-STAT mechanism in the presence of interferon appears to be dependent on ITAMs stimulation (Ivashkiv, 2009; Dhodapkar et al., 2007). Different subgroups of FcRs such as FcRIIA exhibited a function in autoimmune diseases when activated by ITAMs and others like FcRIIIB demonstrated some accumulation in the affected tissue with no toxic effect in in vivo mice macrophages reports (Tsuboi et al., 2008). Our mass spectrometric data (Table 1) showed lower PTK2 and PTK2b peptides scores with the FcR/IgG complex than with the CD36/oxLDL complex. Thus, PTK2 and PTK2B could have a different role in cellular functions rather than in FcRs-induced phagocytosis in U937 macrophages.   59     

6.2.2. OxLDL-beads Association with PTKs in Phagocytosis
The mass spectrometric data demonstrated a strong involvement of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK2 and PTK2b) with the CD36 scavenger receptor, specifically, in the presence of oxLDL coated particles, which was an objective of this study. The mechanism for triggering the CD36 receptor is usually activated by oxLDL-coated antigens and, in the absence of CD36 receptor, a notable increase of serum cholesterol and other free fatty acids (Febbraio et al., 1999). Other studies show that in the absence of macrophage SR-AI/II, an 80% reduction of acetylated LDL clearance, in contrast to a 30% reduction of oxLDL uptake by this receptor indicating a different scavenger receptor (such as CD36) is likely to be responsible for oxLDL uptake (Lougheed et al., 1997). Clinical trials indicated an association of atherogenic development and progression in CD36 depleted patients (Yuasa-Kawase et al., 2012). Thus, investigations are needed for the CD36 receptor and its ligand partner oxLDL in atherosclerosis diseases. In our study, human U937 cells were incubated with oxLDL beads in three media conditions including: RPMI enriched with 10%FBS, RPMI serum free, and HEPES buffer, to observe and manage the best possible phagocytic inhibition. The initial observation for cellular phagocytic capability was with 10% FBS media incubated with either IgG or oxLDL coated beads for 2 hours. We found that with IgG beads, challenged macrophages where the siRNA was knockdown using siRNA directed at PTK2, PTK2b, and both siRNA had no significant reduction in phagocytosis efficiency (Appendix. G-I). In contrast, a significant phagocytic efficiency effect was seen in U937 challenged with oxLDL beads in media condition including RPMI 10%FBS (F=8.51, p <0.05), RPMI serum free (F=34.38, p <0.0001), and HEPES buffer (F=101.67, p <0.0001) in all PTKs siRNA conditions. Thus, PTK2 and PTK2b both play a role in phagocytosis in human U937 cells-treated oxLDL-coated beads.

  60     

In recent studies the stimulation of FAK has been correlated with ROS production through NADPH oxidase by down regulation of oxidative SHP-1 in a CD36/oxLDL dependent manner (Park et al., 2009). FAK activation is also connected to CD36 build up in the atrial intima in the presence of oxLDL in the fluid phase (Park et al., 2009). Another way of FAK phosphorylation is suggested by Src family kinases (such as Lyn) at the time of CD36 signaling and with src homology 2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) inhibition (Silverstein et al., 2010). FAK can also bind directly to Lyn (Mlinaric-Rascan and Yamamoto, 2001), and CD36 at the C-terminal making strong binding connection with FAK recognized by peptide affinity chromatography (Thorne et al., 2006). continuous activation of FAK is caused by a cocktail effect of free radicals and SHP-2 inactivation when oxLDL is present leading to an unbalanced or loss of actin regulation of cellular functions (Silverstein and Febbraio, 2010). The main players in actin polymerization through known scaffolding proteins includes paxillin, FAK, Pyk2, Fyn and p130Cas, and they were suggested to be activated by CD36 signaling cascades (Stuart et al., 2007; Park et al., 2009). Thus, PTK2 and PTK2b can play a role in phagocytosis induced by oxLDL particles as mentioned in this study involving human U937 and other murine macrophage studies.

6.2.3. Immuno fluorescence/blotting and siRNA Knockdown Confirmation
The immunofluorescent staining of U937 cells and western blotting assays successfully confirmed the localization of PTK2 and PTK2b when introduced to oxLDL beads (Fig. 14 & 15). The permeablized cytosolic staining of the cells and intensity quantification provided the ability of this system to calculate the abundance of PTKs silenced or non-silenced with RNA (Appendix. U-X). Overall localization of PTK2 and PTK2b is clearly concentrated in the peripheral part of the cytosol indicating its presence at the focal contacts and near actin site (see image). Our report shows a significant effect of siRNA on PTK2 (F=26.46, p <0.0001) and PTK2b (F=44.98, p <0.0001) localization against negative treatments with ANOVA analysis (Appendix. U & W). A regression test was performed with Cy5 intensity against Cy3 intensity for silenced PTK2 (F=103.38, p <0.0001) and silenced PTK2b (F=74.88, p <0.0001) (Fig. 17) (Appendix. V & X). A successful western blotting was carried out to confirm the protein bands for PTK2 or FAK (125 kDa) and PTK2b or Pyk2 (116 kDa) (Fig. 15), using PMAtreated U937 cell lysate.

6.2.4. Pharmacological inhibitors Confirmation
This study utilized a diverse experimental procedure by using the known nonspecific FAK drug inhibitor PF 573228 to further confirm the role of PTKs in phagocytosis and to validate drug inhibition techniques. We used IgG-coated beads in U937 cells (10% FBS media) treated with PF 573228 in different concentrations. Our results using this procedure showed no sign of phagocytic efficiency effect of IgG-coated beads internalization (Appendix. S & T). However, the other scenario performed with oxLDL beads (HEPES buffer) and treated with PF drug including concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 ÂµM, and only 5 ÂµM and 10 ÂµM concentrations significantly impaired phagocytosis beads internalization (F=11.56, p <0.0001) (Appendix. P-R). Recent studies have showed no significant effect of PF 573228 treatment with 1 ÂµM concentration on either oxLDL or IgG coated beads for U937 phagocytosis (unpublished data). Other studies found that by using the PF 573228 FAK drug   63     

inhibitor, human platelet cytosolic calcium levels were inhibited and indirectly inhibited FAK. Furthermore, FAK phosphorylation was directly blocked using 1 ÂµM of PF concentration leading to PAK and Akt inhibition (Jones et al., 2009). Lafrenaye and Fuss (2010) observed that PF-treated oligodendrocytes (PF=100 nM) blocked FAK autophosphorylation with no sign of cell survival defects. However, our results of macrophages U937-treated PF FAK inhibitor showed an effect of phagocytosis efficiency using 5 and 10 ÂµM drug concentrations with oxLDL-coated beads (Fig. 13).

6.3. New information of Focal Adhesion Kinases Functions

The initial data for PTK2 and PTK2b isoforms obtained from the mass spectrometry provided a correlation of the suggested tyrosine kinases in the process of phagocytosis of oxLDL beads. At the molecular level our results showed that protein tyrosine kinases are released from macrophage U937 cells. In the literature different human macrophage cell lines demonstrated FAK or Pyk2 signaling in the CD36 receptor in relation to phagocytosis (Greenberg et al., 1994; Febbraio et al., 1999; Watson et al., 2001; Guinamard et al., 2000; Park et al., 2009). Nevertheless, our findings reveal a novel association of PTK2 and PTK2b secreted from human macrophage U937 cells. The preliminary results of PTKs connection with receptor complexes by mass spectrometry were confirmed by independant analytical methods. Thus the results from this study support the hypothesis of PTKs function and signaling in phagocytosis as well as in the atherosclerosis progression. As a result, the presence of protein tyrosine kinases in human macrophages could provide a clear understanding of the cellular adhesion and focal contact mechanisms in relation to phagocytosis of oxLDL beads and the CD36 signaling pathway. However, an investigation on PTK uncharacterized domains dynamic activation processes could support our findings.

  64     

7. CONCLUSION
Despite the current advances in FAKs structural, signaling and therapeutics development, the full interpretation of FAKs structure remains under investigation. Indeed, other FAK isoforms are also not fully recognized from a structural point of view. Our findings revealed a puzzling function of FAKs where they play a role in macrophage phagocytosis in human immune cells. The overall confirmation tests for PTK2 and PTK2b were performed in various cell stress conditions including siRNA PTKs knockdown, PTKs immunofluorescence localization and drug inhibition analysis. This report demonstrates possible ways of quantifying the effect of IgG beads and oxLDL beads in phagocytosis at the time of PTK2 and PTK2b inhibition and successful reduction of phagocytosis efficiency of the U937 cell line under different treatment conditions. Protein tyrosine kinases including PTK2 and PTK2b were inactivated by short interfering RNA plus known drug inhibitors with viable overall cell functions. The inactivation of PTK2 and PTK2b successfully decreased the ability of U937 cells to engulf oxLDL-coated beads in relation to CD36 receptor macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. Our novel interpretations of PTK2 and PTK2b knockdown inhibition of oxLDL beads uptake by their CD36 receptor could undermine PTKs insignificant role in activated FcR and their ligand IgG. This novel insight obtained as a result of this study could reveal some of the important answers in FAKs biological functions in the human body, especially in regards to the innate immune response found with atherosclerosis disease. Yet, FAKs structural solutions and knowledge of FAK other isoforms could facilitate the current dilemma of their explicit functions in vivo and in vitro under the molecular level in relation to phagocytosis of oxLDL in atherosclerosis.

  65     

8. FUTURE OBJECTIVES
Future studies on the presence of PTK2 and PTK2b in receptor complexes can be tested with dominant negative mutants to further confirm the results obtained by this study. Furthermore, structural knowledge of the uncharacterized proline-rich sites for FAK could provide our study more confidence of domains signaling role and in lipids binding to FAK FERM domain. Finally, the identification of other FAK isoforms with their fulllength structure could demonstrate how the protein kinase family functions and their involvement in phagocytosis.
