ABSTRACT

Evaluation of Laboratory Methods for the Analysis of Microcystins

Rehana Shabnam Master of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University 2013

Finding low cost, rapid tests to monitor microcystins in water is paramount to protect environmental and public health worldwide. Bioassays like Protein Phosphatase Inhibition Assay (PPIA) and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) have many advantages over liquid chromatography­tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Analytical cost per sample was found to be $136 by ELISA and $365 by LC-MS/MS. An agreement of 76% was found between ELISA and LC-MS/MS results from 2010 to 2012 (n=854) on the basis of Method Detection Limits (MDLs). Among samples with LC-MS/MS results >1.5µg/L, ELISA missed 3 samples in 2010, 1 in 2011 and none in 2012.

Correlation between PP2A and ELISA was strong (R2=0.8155, p=0.8054, n=27) in surface water samples but non-existent in drinking water (R2=0.0366, p=0.0665, n=38). PP2A was found useful for monitoring non-coloured surface water but not for drinking water. A 2-tier test system is proposed: tier-1 ELISA and tier-2 PP2A for surface water samples.

Introduction

Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, pose an emerging issue due to their potential impacts on drinking water and recreational waters. Climate change and high nutrient loading have favoured the ecological niche of cyanobacteria which have been blooming worldwide with alarming frequency and increasing bloom size.

Cyanobacteria produce a variety of toxins including the neurotoxins; anatoxin-a, saxitoxins, and the hepatotoxins which are microcystins and nodularin. Microcystins are the most commonly detected cyanotoxins of major health concern in Ontario's surface and drinking water. There are over 90 variants of microcystins (Welker et al., 2004), many of them are toxic but most of them are not well studied. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is the only variant regulated under the Ontario Safe Drinking Water Act, 2002 (SDWA) while the rest of the 90+ variants are ignored. The Ontario drinking water standard for microcystin-LR is set at1.5g/L (1.5ppb).

Until 2010, the only test method licensed by the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) for analysing microcystins in drinking water was liquid chromatography (electrospray ionization) ­ tandem mass spectrometry [LC(ESI)-MS/MS]. By 2009, bioassay such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was started at MOE as an analytical method for microcystins in surface water. In order to support the SDWA, on August, 2010 the regulation O. Reg. 248/03 (MOE, 2010a) was amended to allow using ELISA to screen drinking water, particularly treated drinking water. Raw drinking water samples and surface water samples are still being analysed by LC-MS/MS at MOE because they do not fall under drinking water regulations. Consequently, the full benefit of ELISA has not yet been availed for surface and source water samples analysis.

ELISA cannot quantify individual variants in a water sample. Instead, it measures all variants that cross-react with the antibodies. Since ELISA is capable of measuring total microcystins inclusive of multiple variants, the Ontario Drinking-Water Quality Standards Regulation (O. Reg. 169/03) should be changed again from focusing solely on microcystin-LR to total microcystins (MOE, 2002). This change will also alleviate the regulatory reliance on the LCMS/MS method.

1

CHAPTER ONE There remains one big obstacle to change the regulatory focus from a single variant to multiple variants; LC-MS/MS results do not always correlate with ELISA results. This is because LCMS/MS could only detect the 4 to 5 (-LR, -YR, -RR, -LA) variants for which pure chemical standards are commercially available while ELISA antibodies cross-reacts with numerous variants and can measures total microcystins. Consequently, ELISA often produces higher positive results compared to LC-MS/MS. Regulatory authorities need to be convinced that ELISA result is reliable even when it disagrees with LC-MS/MS result. This research provides evidence to support the premise. A convincing approach to address any disagreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS would be to introduce a third analytical method as an adjudicator.

Protein phosphates inhibition assay (PPIA) measures the bioactivity or toxicity of microcystins but not the structural component like ELISA does. By definition, all toxic variants of microcystins are detectable by PPIA. However, PPIA has its own limitations. It is not specific to microcystins; other non-microcystins protein phosphatase inhibitors are detectable too. A logical algorithm is hereby proposed: screen water samples with PPIA as a tier-1 test followed by ELISA as a tier-2 test on only PPIA positive samples. This 2 tier test algorithm would confirm whether the toxicity present in the sample is due to microcystins. In this manner, the current O. Reg. 169/03 (MOE, 2002) is supported.

ELISA and PPIA in combination can give a clearer picture in term of stoichiometry and toxicity. The combined assays can be conducted on multiple samples using the same equipment and in the same duration. ELISA and PPIA have numerous advantages over LC-MS/MS in terms of lower cost, higher throughput, faster turnaround time, and commercially available kits. More importantly, these assays empower laboratories which lack LC-MS/MS facility in the private sector or municipal level to participate in the surveillance of cyanobacterial threat to public and environmental health.

This thesis covers three aspects (1) scrutinize the agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS results (2010 to 2012) in the Ministry of the environment (MOE) data base (2) compare the costs between ELISA and LC-MS/MS at MOE (3) perform PPIA and ELISA, and determine the correlation between the two. 2

CHAPTER ONE 1.1 Hypothesis and Research Objectives

Microcystins are analysed at Ministry of the environment (MOE) by ELISA and LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS results do not always agree with ELISA results. LC-MS/MS could only detect the 4 to 5 variants for which pure chemical standards are commercially available. Many times water samples found positive by ELISA are negative by conventional LC-MS/MS. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis: ELISA detects numerous variants of microcystins while LC-MS/MS detection is limited to few commercially available standards. Hence, ELISA produces more true positive results than LC-MS/MS.

The research objectives are as follows:

Objective 1: Analyse the discrepancy between ELISA and LC-MS/MS results from ministry of the environment (MOE) database over the period of three years (2010 to 2012).

Objective 2: Find a reliable, low cost and faster method (PPIA) for the analysis of microcystins to adjudicate the discrepancy between ELISA and LC-MS/MS results.

If this hypothesis proves to be correct and biochemical assays like ELISA and PPIA prove to be reliable methods for the analysis of microcystins, this thesis will provide the directions for more meaningful regulations and the logistic for sustainable monitoring program for drinking and surface water at the Ministry of the Environment (MOE).

Literature Review
Cyanobacteria and Cyanotoxins

Cyanobacteria are essential part of the ecosystem, and are natural inhabitants of aquatic systems. Their history is at least 3.5 billion years old (Altermann et al., 2006) and they are responsible for consequential evolution of the Earth's lithosphere (Fischer, 1965; Altermann et al., 2006).

Cyanobacteria have a simple structure at the subcellular level. They lack nucleus, a characteristics feature defining them, along with bacteria, as prokaryotes (Fogg et al., 1973). The cyanobacteria also possess a photosynthetic apparatus enabling them to perform photosynthesis, but they lack chloroplasts, which differentiate them from algae and higher plants (Chorus & Bartman, 1999b). Their size is usually microscopic. However, when conditions are ideal, they reproduce rapidly and undergo a phenomenon known as "bloom" (clumps of cyanobacteria visible to the naked eye).

Blooms are symptoms of eutrophication and are evidence of the deterioration of water resources. They could be the result of effluent discharge, poor land and catchment management, and often of poor water allocation practices in rivers (Michael D Burch, 2009). Increased frequency and size of these blooms worldwide in fresh water are considered as an emerging threat to natural water reservoirs and drinking water supplies (Kaushik at el., 2012).

Cyanobacteria produce a wide range of toxins which includes microcystins/nodularins, anatoxins, cylindrospermopsin, and saxitoxins (Frank, 2002), causing hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity and dermatoxicity, respectively (Carmichael et al., 1992). The details of these cyanotoxins with their health effects are summarized in the Table 1.

Microcystins has been found to be the most significant potential source of human injury worldwide. Therefore, the main study focus has been on microcystins. In southern Manitoba, microcystin-LR level of 0.1-0.6 µg/L was found at 44% of the sites (Jones et al., 1998).

Potential irritant; affects any exposed tissue

Anatoxin-a, which is a neurotoxin, is another important cyanotoxins. They are not as common as microcystins. As a result, they are considered to be less of a concern for Canadian recreational waters (Agriculture Canada, 2012). However, they are always analysed along with microcystins in water samples submitted to the Ministry of the Environment (MOE). Anatoxin-a is considered more lethal than microcystins. It can cause death within minutes depending upon the amount of toxin an individual is exposed to (Wonnacott & Gallagher, 2006). There are no official guidelines available from Ontario or WHO (World Health Organization) or US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) for this toxin.

Although human health impacts are of prime importance, another concern is the mortalities of aquatic and wild life caused by cyanobacteria. Mortality events, such as death of shellfish, fish, birds and mammals, have enormous impacts on local communities. For example, in 1987, a

5

CHAPTER TWO phytoplankton bloom was linked to the mortality of 250,000 Atlantic salmon valued at over $500,000 (Ecohab, 2005).

Studies have also shown the negative impacts of cyanotoxins on plants. Microcystins can be taken up by plant seedlings; (Abe et al., 1996) inhibiting the plant development, root growth and photosynthesis (Pflugmacher et al., 2006). Necrotic lesions on the leaves were also observed due to microcystin-induced stress (Pflugmacher et al., 2006).

On the other hand cyanobacteria have remarkable beneficial effects. They contribute significantly to global ecology by producing oxygen and fixing nitrogen. Cyanobacteria have chlorophyll a and photosystems I and II that allow them to perform oxygenic photosynthesis (Howells, 2008). Fossil records show that cyanobacteria played a primary role in the oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere (Fischer, 1965; Altermann et al., 2006). However, increased N and P loading can contribute to an increased occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in water. As the bloom subsides, the dead and decaying algae can reduce the oxygen levels in the water, causing stress or death of aquatic life.

Cyanobacteria are one of the main participants in nitrogen fixation in the ocean (Fong et al., 2008). This ability of cyanobacteria to fix nitrogen has made it a very important agricultural asset. They are used as nitrogen fertilizer in the cultivation of rice and beans (Bold, 1985).

Cyanobacteria have gained a lot of attention because of their potential application for the treatment of HIV. An extract of Arthrospiraplatensis inhibits the HIV-1 replication in human (Ayehunie et al., 1998).

The production of food supplements containing cyanobacteria is a growing industry worldwide (Saker et al., 2007). Cyanobacteria are rich sources of proteins, lipids and vitamins (Howe, 1997).

6

CHAPTER TWO Cyanobacteria are considered as good candidate for mass production of biofuel for the future (Skulberg et al., 1995).

2.2

Environmental Factors Effecting Cyanobacteria

Cyanobacteria can form dense water blooms in the mesotrophic, eutrophic and hypertrophic water. The critical factors required for cyanobacterial growth are: stable water column, warm temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, high pH and ample sunlight (Zuerwell, 2000; Haider et al., 2003). Cyanobacteria blooms are more likely to occur in places where the water body is warm (Kong & Gao, 2005), shallow (Havens et al., 1998), eutrophied (Vézie et al., 2002), or slow moving.

Small vacuoles in the cyanobacteria allow them to regulate their buoyancy (Falcnor, 2005). Buoyancy enables them to migrate up and down the water column and to utilize nutrients confined to the sediments below (Falcnor, 2005). Cyanobacteria can multiply intensively in the form of blooms in still and stratified surface water (Falcnor, 2005). Buoyancy can be interfered by high water flows and high turbulence. When the wind stops, cyanobacteria may suddenly become over buoyant and form surface scum. Scum often forms overnight and may drift downwind towards the shores, where cyanobacteria may release toxins during decay (WHO, 1998). Hence, at the end of the warm season, cell lyses leads to increase toxicity in the water body.

2.3

Anatoxin-a

Anatoxin-a (Fig.1) is a low molecular weight neurotoxic alkaloid (MW = 165) produced by species belonging to the genera Anabaena, Oscillatoria, Aphanizomenon and

Cylindrospermopsins species of cyanobacteria (Devlin et al., 1977; Skulberg et al., 1992; Chorus & Bartram, 1999; Falconer, 2005). This toxin is not very common but there are well recorded incidents of poisoning, usually fatal, of wild and domestic animals. Initially it was referred to VFDF (very fast death factor) and was associated with blooms of cyanobacteria in North America and in Europe (Wonnacott & Gallagher, 2006).

7

CHAPTER TWO Anatoxin-a inhibits the cholinesterase with a mechanism similar to that of the organophosphorus insecticides (Van Apeldoorn et al., 2007). It is a potent neuromuscular blocking agent that binds to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This blockage cause persistent stimulation resulting in secondary block of further electrical transmission across the synapse. These events can lead to muscular paralysis (Van Apeldoorn et al., 2007). However, brain and retinal cholinesterase activities remain normal even in lethally poisoned animals (Briand et al., 2003).

FIGURE 1. STRUCTURE OF ANATOXIN-A (CHORUS & BARTAM, 1999)
.

In case of respiratory muscles, it can lead to death by asphyxiation within minutes to a few hours depending on the animal species and the amount of toxin exposed to (Carmichael, 2001; Van Apeldoorn, 2007; Falconer, 1999). Symptoms of anatoxin-a toxicity includes progression of muscle fasciculation, decreased movement, cyanosis, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmia and death (Carmichael, 2001; Fawell et al., 1999).

The LD50 (lethal dose resulting in 50 per cent deaths) of anatoxin-a is 20 µg kg/ body weight (mouse) (Chorus & Bartram, 1999a; Carmichael et al., 1990). The half-life for anatoxin-a breakdown was found to be approximately 14 days at pH 8 or pH 10, under normal day and night conditions (Smith & Sutton, 1993; Chorus & Bartram, 1999a).

2.3.1 TDI (Tolerable Daily Intake) of Anatoxin-a NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effects Level) of 98 µg/kg body weight per day of anatoxin-a was derived from a 28-day study in mice by Fawell et al., (1999). Van et al., (2007) calculated a

CHAPTER TWO TDI of l.0µg/kg body weight by using an uncertainty factor of 1000 (100 for intra- and interspecies variation and 10 for limitations in the database).
.

2.3.2

Regulations

No official guidelines are available from Ontario, WHO and US EPA. However, Fawell et al., (1999) suggested a guideline limit of 1.0 µg/L of anatoxin-a for drinking water. 2.3.3 Detection Methods of Anatoxin-a Methods for the detection of anatoxin-a are as follow: 2.3.3.1 Biological Assays The mouse bioassay can be used to determine the minimum amount of toxin required to kill a mouse. When used to screen a sample, this method gives the total potential toxicity of the sample within few hours and makes it possible to distinguish hepatotoxins from neurotoxins (Carmichael, 1992). The lethal dose of the sample is compared to the lethal doses of known amount of toxins.

The disadvantages are: it is not sensitive enough to detect toxins at the microgram level (Harda et al., 1996), and it does not identify the specific toxic agent (Lambert et al., 1994a). This method had been obsolete due to lack of reliability and ethical implications (Fischer et al., 2001).

2.3.3.2 Chromatographic Techniques Anatoxin-a can be analysed by Gas Chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometer (MS). Alternatively, it can be analysed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) using Ultra violet (UV) detector or Fluorescence (FL) detector or coupled to MS. Commercial standards are now readily available from Abraxis LLC for anatoxin-a (Abraxis, 2013a).

Although the Ontario Safe Drinking Water Act 2002 (SDWA, 2002) does not stipulate any guideline for anatoxin-a, MOE proactively analyse for this toxin in routine water samples submitted for microcystins analysis. For this purpose LaSB use method # E3450 ­ Liquid Chromatography(Electrospray Ionization) Tandem Mass Spectrometry [LC (ESI)-MS/MS] or LC-MS/MS in short. Anatoxin-a and microcystins are detected simultaneously by LC-MS/MS. Method detection limit (MDL) of anatoxin-a by LC-MS/MS is 0.02 µg/L (MOE, 2010a). 9

CHAPTER TWO 2.3.3.3 ELISA Originally Anatoxin-a was detected in maize by ELISA with an LOD (Limit of Detection) of 1µg/kg (Young et al., 2001). A receptor radioligand-binding assay was also used in the past to determine anatoxin-a in water with LOD close to 1.0 µg/L (Araoz et al., 2005).

In April 2013, Abraxis (manufacturer) launched a commercial ELISA kit for the detection of anatoxin-a in water matrices. The detection limit is approximately 2.3ng/ml. The test is based on the affinity of anatoxin-a for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (Fig.2). Anatoxin-a competes with the biotinylated alpha-bungarotoxin for the acetylcholine binding sites of nAChRs which were coated on the microtiter plate. A streptavidin-horse reddish peroxidase (HRP) solution is added, if anatoxin-a is absent or low in concentration, the unbound nAChRs will be accessible to alpha-bungarotoxin (Abraxis, 2013a).

The amount of biotinylated alpha-bungarotoxin bound to the remaining nAChRs is tagged by addition of streptavidin-HRP. Addition of chromogenic substrate produces a color reaction. The color intensity is measured by a spectrophotometer at 405nm. Since this a competitive reaction, the intensity of the blue color is inversely proportional to the concentration of anatoxin-a present 10

CHAPTER TWO in the sample. The concentration of anatoxin-a is calculated by interpolating the absorbance of the sample on a standard curve (Abraxis, 2013a). Detection of anatoxin-a is by this simple and economical method performed in microtiter plate could potentially reduce the LC-MS/MS workload.

2.4

Microcystins

Microcystins are the most commonly found cyanobacterial toxins in the drinking and surface water. It is produced by cyanobacterial species belonging to the genera Microcystis, Anabaena, Anabaenopsis, Oscillatgoria, Hapalosiphon and Nostoc species of cyanobacteria (Chorus & Bartram, 1999a; Janse et al., 2005). It is associated with hepatotoxicity (Chorus & Bartram, 1999a) and is a known tumor premotor (Falconer et al., 1991).

2.4.1 Structure and Properties of Microcystins Microcystins comprises a group of cyclic heptapeptide characterized by a unique amino acid ADDA (3-amino-9-methoxy-2, 6, 8- trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4, 6-dienoic acid) which is present in > 80% of known toxin variants (Fischer et al., 2001) (Fig.3). Variation of amino acids (Fig.3) at positions 2 and 4 (X and Z) provides the basis for microcystins nomenclature (Campos et al., 2010). The range of molecular weight of microcystins is from 800 to 1100 Daltons (Gurbuz et al., 2009). Eighty structural variants of microcystins have been characterized out of 90+ variants (Welker et al., 2004). Some researchers used the term congeners to refer to the various chemical structures of microcystins. The term variant should be used because these are products of biological variations. The term congener should be reserved for chemical variations.

FIGURE 3. STRUCTURE OF MICROCYSTINS, WITH X AND Z REPRESENTING TWO AMINO ACID VARIABLES (SILVA-STENICO, 2009)

11

CHAPTER TWO Microcystins is a potent inhibitors of the serine/threonine protein phosphatases type1 (PP1) and type 2 (PP2) enzymes (Honkanen et al., 1990; MacKintosh et al., 1990).

Among the numerous variant of microcystins, microcystin-LR was the first to be chemically identified. Most of the research work is conducted using this variant and most of the worldwide incidents are associated with its frequent occurrence. However, the -LA, -RR and -YR variants of microcystins have similar toxicological effects (EPA, 2009b). The molecular weight and positions of amino acids in the variants are given in Table 2.

2.4.2 Health Effects Microcystins are primarily a hepatotoxic (Chorus & Bartman, 1999a). It inhibits protein phosphatases type 1 (PP1) and type 2A (PP2A) enzymes (Falconer, 1991; Falconer et al., 1992; Sekijima et al., 1999; Mackintosh et al., 1990). The metabolism of a cell relies on the function of numerous enzymes and proteins. These enzymes/proteins are normally in a resting state. Usually, phosphorylation is required to convert the enzyme/proteins from its resting state to its active state. Phosphorylation of protein and enzymes are achieved by protein kinases at the expense of adenosine triphosphate. After the enzyme has performed its necessary functions, the phosphate radical is removed by protein phosphatase type 1 or 2 in order to return the active enzyme into its original resting state (Fig.4). If the phosphate radical is not removed, the enzyme will remain active and the cell will enter a hyperactive state. The toxicity of microcystins is due to its covalent binding to phosphatases thereby inhibiting the dephosphorylation reaction. Consequently, microcystins can cause hyper phosphorylation of proteins, irreversible reorganization of cellular microfilaments and destruction of the liver cells (Rapala et a.l, 2002)

12

CHAPTER TWO which can lead to blood accumulation in the liver and eventually can be fatal for the animal (Falconer et al., 1999).

Acute exposure to cyanotoxins may cause mild symptoms; headache, vomiting, stomach cramp and skin rash (Chorus & Bartman, 1999c). Exposure could be from many sources such as drinking water, surface water, contaminated food or food supplements (Dittmann et al., 2006). In Brazil, 52 patients died after hemodialysis from microcystins contaminated water (Jochimsen et al., 1998).

FIGURE 4. INTRACELLULAR PHOSPHORYLATION REACTION (REPRODUCED WITH PERMISSION FROM DR. CHING LO, MOE

Chronic exposures of microcystins have affected birds, amphibians, fish wild and domestic mammals from mild to fatal outcomes (Codd et al., 2005). Consumption of water containing more than 106/mL of cyanobacterial cells had caused animal deaths (Carmichael, 1992, 1997). Microcystins can also enter the aquatic food chain by accumulating in the tissues (Lance et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2008). Therefore microcystins, which may not be toxic for fish, can accumulate in fish to the level that may lead to microcystins toxicity if consumed by human beings (Lindner et al., 2004). 13

CHAPTER TWO 2.4.3 Stability of Microcystins Microcystins is found in the bacterial cells in bound and free forms (Carmichael, 1992). The death of cyanobacteria releases both forms of the toxin into the water (Health Canada, 2013). It is water soluble. Microcystins is very persistent in the environment (Ressom, 1994) and difficult to degrade or remove. Its cyclic structure renders its chemical stability (Campas et al., 2007). It can persist up to 2 to 3 months in water and 5 to 6 months in dried form (Ressom et al., 1994). It degrades slowly in water at temperature higher than 40ºC at pH <1 or >9 (Harada et al., 1996). Microcystin-LR and nodularin can reach a half-life of 4 to 18 days in water (Edwards et al., 2008).

The removal of microcystins in nature is due to the following known processes. The bacterial Genus Sphingomonas have the capability of degrading microcystins (Harda et al., 2004). Microcystins present in the cooler and dark areas of surface water can persist from months to years in the absence of these bacteria (Rapala et al., 2005, Jones et al., 1995). Another bacterium, Spirodela intermedia have also shown the ability to uptake microcystin-RR, confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography ­ photodiode array (HPLC-PDA) analysis (Ferreira et al., 2009). Pflugmacher et al., (2001) also found the uptake of microcystin-LR by reed plants.

Microcystins cannot be destroyed by boiling (Health Canada, 2013). Ontario, Ministry of Environment recommends the best solution is prevention or discontinue the use of the contaminated water until the bloom is abated.

2.5

Guidelines for Microcystin-LR

The guidelines for the microcystin-LR in drinking water were introduced in 1998 by WHO and in 2002 by Ontario Ministry of the Environment and had not been changed since. At that time, the only sufficient information available was for microcystin-LR only. Hence, guidelines are based only on one variant (microcystin-LR) out of 90 (Welker et al., 2004). The details of the Ontario and WHO drinking water guidelines are given below:

14

CHAPTER TWO 2.5.1 Ontario Drinking Water Guidelines Maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) of microcystin-LR under Ontario, Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), 2002 - O. Reg. 169/03 in drinking water is 1.5µg/L (MOE, 2002). This MAC is based on the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of microcystin-LR. The calculation of TDI and MAC is as follow:

a.

TDI (Tolerable Daily Intake)

Microcystins has been placed in Group IIIB (Inadequate data in humans, limited evidence in experimental animals). Hence, the TDI calculations are based on LOAEL (Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level) or NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level) from chronic and sub chronic studies, divided by an uncertainty factor to derive tolerable daily intake (TDI) (Health Canada, 2008).

The TDI derived for microcystin-LR is as follow:

where: NOAEL = No Observed Adverse Effects Level of 40 µg/kg bw (body weight) per day is derived from 13 week mouse study with liver changes at the Water Research Centre, the United Kingdom (Fawell et al., 1994). UF = 1000 is the uncertainty factor (×10 for intraspecies variation, ×10 for interspecies variation and ×10 for the less-than-lifetime study).

b.

MAC (Maximum Acceptable Concentration) for microcystin-LR

The maximum acceptable concentration of 1.5µg/L is calculated from TDI is as follow:

15

CHAPTER TWO

TDI = 0.04 µg/kg bw per day, as derived above bw = 70 kg bw is the average body weight of an adult P = 0.80 is the proportion of total intake considered to be ingested in drinking water L = 1.5 L/d is the average daily consumption of drinking water for an adult

The MAC of 1.5µg/L for microcystins is derived on the basis of daily consumption of microcystin-LR over a full year of a study. This calculated MAC for microcystin-LR is believed to be protective against exposure to the other microcystins variants too (Health Canada, 2008).

2.5.2 World Health Organization (WHO) Provisional Drinking Water Guidelines Maximum Acceptable Concentration (MAC) of microcystin-LR in drinking water is 1.0 µg/L. This guideline value is provisional, as it covers only one variant i.e. microcystin-LR.

The TDI of 0.04 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day (µg/kg/d) calculated by WHO is also based on the same 13-week study of mice by Fawell et al., (1994) which were used by Health Ontario, Canada to calculate the TDI. Hence, the calculated TDI is the same by both. However, MAC calculation varies (WHO, 1998).

The maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) was calculated as:

TDI = the Tolerable daily intake of 0.04 µg/kg bw per day, as derived by health Canada

16

CHAPTER TWO bw = the average body weight of an adults; 60 kg (132lb) P = the proportion of total intake considered to be ingested in drinking water used 0.80 or 80% L = the average daily consumption of drinking water for an adult is 2.0 L/d

Guideline value was supported by a 44-days study on pigs, exposed to an extract from M. aeruginosa containing microcystin-LR (WHO, 1998). The risk level and guideline of microcystins by WHO is summarised in the Table 3.

2.5.3 Drinking Water Guidelines from Other Countries Most of the countries (e.g. Czech Republic, France, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Brazil and Spain, USA) have adopted directly the WHO provisional guidelines. Some countries have adopted the same animal studies as by the WHO and modified it based upon their local requirements. For example, Canada has MAC of 1.5µg/L for microcystin-LR in the drinking water and Australia has MAC for total microcystins of 1.3g/L as toxicity equivalents of microcystin-LR. Brazil set the most comprehensive mandatory standards that include the MAC of 1.0g/L for microcystins, 3.0g/L for saxitoxins (equivalents) and 15g/L for cylindrospermopsin (Michael D Burch, 2009).

2.6

Cyanobacteria an Emerging Contaminant of Concern

Canada has almost two million lakes (biodivcanada, 2011) of 891,163 sq km area (Env Canada, 2011) which are third most renewable freshwater resources of the world (Env Canada, 2010). In 40th national conference of "Canadian Association on Water Quality" (CAWQ) held on Feb 17

CHAPTER TWO 12th, 2012, cyanotoxins were identified as the emerging contaminant of concern and a potential threat for fresh water resources. Monitoring microcystin over such large areas is impractical with the current expensive and time consuming method of LC-MS/MS.

Provincially, the province of Quebec is notably affected. In summer, 2011, due to cyanotoxicity, drinking water advisories for public water systems were posted many times by the Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks on their website. Quebec residents were unable to use the municipal water for drinking, bathing or washing purposes. In another incident of Quebec West Island, almost 130,000 people were affected and had no water for the whole summer of 2011 (Bruemmer René, 2011).

FIGURE 5. LAKE ERIE (SOURCE: NASA, 2011)

FIGURE 6. HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM, LAKE TAIHU, CHINA (GOOGLE IMAGES, 2007)

18

CHAPTER TWO In the summer of 2011, Lake Erie have seen the largest bloom in decades. The bloom was 22 Km wide (See photo of satellite view- Fig.5).

Internationally, since 1990, blue green algal invasion in Lake Taihu (see satellite photo) the third largest lake of China is causing drinking water crises every summer (Yang Chen, 2003) (Fig.6). In May, 2007, almost two million people were without drinking water for a week due to massive blooms of cyanobacteria in Lake Taihu (Qin et al., 2010).

In view of the global demand for the monitoring of drinking water safety, there is clear research need to prove that ELISA is an effective and efficient method for the detection of microcystins.

Conditions that contributed to the emergence of toxic cyanobacterial bloom as a reoccurring threat include global warming and population explosion. Rise in global temperature created an ecological niche in favour of cyanobacteria over other algae (Parel & Huisman, 2008). Increase in human populations has led to more nutrients loading to the surface water bodies worldwide.

2.7

Response to Reported Blue-Green Algae Events and Microcystins Analysis

Historically, cyanobacterial blooms had been considered a lower risk priority with little environmental consequences. However, due to the widespread of algal blooms over the last few decades and its increased health and environmental risk, now cyanobacteria are identified as one of the emerging contaminant of concern for aquatic systems (CAWQ Symposium, 2012). Algal bloom incidents have been categorized by the Ministry's Operations Division District Office in priority of "known or anticipated human health impacts", or "known or anticipated environmental impairment" in Ontario. Under this consideration, any cyanobacterial bloom could be potentially toxic and water bodies should be monitored minimum once per week during the peak season of late May to early October (MOE, 2003). The province's response algorithm to cyanobacterial bloom impinging drinking water supply is summarized in the following flow chart (Fig.7). Under O. Reg. 170/03 water samples are collected by a regulated drinking water system (DWS) and sent to a licensed laboratory for 19

CHAPTER TWO ELISA testing. ELISA results for total microcystins equal to or greater than 1.5µg/L is considered a provisional exceedance. The licensed ELISA laboratory notifies the MOE and also sends the sample to the Laboratory Services Branch (LaSB) of MOE for the confirmation of microcystin-LR by LC-MS/MS. The results from LC-MS/MS will either confirm or retract the provisional result provided by the ELISA laboratory (MOE, 2010b) Microcystins-LR results that exceeds (1.5µg/) the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standard (ODWQS) under O. Reg. 169/03, are reported to the Ministry of the Environment - Spills Action Centre (MOE-SAC) by the Laboratory Services Branch (LaSB) (Sec.18 DWA) (MOE, 2012). Spills Action Centre (SAC) leads the later process; completes the associated Adverse Water Quality Incident (AWQI) number; notify the district Drinking Water (DW) supervisor and AWQI coordinator.

District supervisor/staff contacts the owner/operator of the DWS of concern, the Local Health Unit (OH) and other stakeholders (Conservation Authority, Operation Division (OD), Standards Development Branch, First Nations, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), Municipalities) to coordinates all other activities until termination of the incident (MOE, 2012).

Sciences & Standards Division (ESSD) of the MOE is also informed to help in providing technical and scientific information (i.e. sampling protocol, presence/absence testing, reporting results), which supports the local Health unit's decision on whether to notify the public, and what measures should be made to safeguard human health. In the MOE, the Drinking Water Management Division (DWMD), specifically the Safe Drinking Water Branch (SDWB), is responsible for any incident related to drinking water-related facilities (MOE, 2012).

All involved groups are responsible for mutual communication on the steps which have been taken (e.g. dissemination of reports coordinated by District office), as well as keeping track of events on the Integrated Divisional System (IDS) (MOE, 2012).

CHAPTER TWO 2.8 Regulatory Overview of ELISA and LC-MS/MS

Microcystins was being analysed in the surface and drinking water (raw and treated) by only LCMS/MS from 2002 to 2009 at Ontario, MOE. On Dec 2009, Ontario Regulation (O. Reg.) 248/03 was amended to allow the use of ELISA for drinking water testing (TW). If the result by ELISA shows a potential exceedance (1.5µg/L total microcystins) of Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standard (ODWQS), as listed in O. Reg. 169/03, then the sample must be analyzed by a licensed method for the confirmation and quantitation of the individual variants, specifically MicrocystinLR. Currently, liquid chromatography  tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS] is the only approved method for the quantitative analysis of microcystin-LR and the Laboratory Services Branch (LaSB) is the only licensed laboratory to perform it (MOE, 2010a). Laboratories are required to use methods listed in the Protocol of Accepted Drinking Water Testing Methods as amended from time to time (MOE, 2010c).

ELISA: LaSB Method # E3469 (O. Reg. 248/03) is an approved screening method for the detection of total microcystins (free and intracellular) in drinking water (MOE, 2010a). The type of immunoassay employed in this method is indirect competitive ELISA (See Section 5.2). The concentrations of the samples are determined by interpolation using the standard curve constructed with each run (MOE, 2010a).

LC-MS/MS: LaSB Method # E3450 (O. Reg. 248/03) is an approved method for the quantitative analysis of microcystins variants and Anatoxin-a. The details of the sample preparation and procedure of LC-MS/MS is available in Appendix I (MOE, 2010a).

The above regulatory overview provides the following prospective which is relevant to the focus of this research. Firstly, ELISA and LC-MS/MS are the only two approved methods which are therefore the subjects of scrutiny in this study. Secondly, t he regulation was amended for using ELISA to test drinking water, particularly treated drinking water. Raw drinking water source and surface water samples are still being analysed by LC-CMS/MS at MOE because they do not fall under drinking water regulations. Consequently, the full benefit of ELISA has not yet been realized for surface and source water samples analysis. This is the second subject of this research. Finally, the current SDWA standard is based on a single toxin variant; but over 90 22

CHAPTER TWO microcystins variants exist. To address the inadequacy of the current SDWA is the third subject in this study.

2.9

Microcystins Analysis

Microcystins can be analysed by multiple methods qualitatively or qualitatively. The selection of the method depends on the purpose of the testing. For example, PCR is an excellent technique to identify the toxin of cyanobacteria, ELISA measures total microcystins while PPIA measures total potential toxicity of microcystins (Fischer et al., 2001) and with HPLC, individual microcystins can be separated and recognized on the basis of their retention time (Harada et al., 1996). The advantages and disadvantages of the most common techniques for the analysis of microcystins are summarized in the Table 4.

This study is focused on ELISA and LC-MS/MS because only these two methods are approved for the detection of microcystins in drinking water samples in Ontario. These two techniques (ELISA and LC-MS/MS) will be compared. A third technique, PPIA, will be investigated due to its capability of measuring toxicity directly, an advantageous feature absent from ELISA and LC-MS/MS.

2.9.1 Liquid Chromatography ­ (Electrospray Ionization) Tandem Mass Spectrometry [LC(ESI) MS/MS.

LC(ESI)-MS/MS is an analytical chemistry technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of tandem mass spectrometry (Li et al., 2006). Gramicidin S is used as the internal standard (MOE, 2010a). Microcystin-LR, -RR, -LA, -YR and anatoxin-a are determined quantitatively by multi-point calibration. This method enables simultaneous separation, identification and quantification of microcystins variants in a mixture (Bruno et al., 2006).

However, identification of variants are limited due to overlapping molecular weights, retention time and availability of few commercial reference standards (-LR, -RR, -LA, -YR) (Hotto, 2007; Fisher et al., 2001). It is very time consuming and expensive (Fisher et al., 2001). Consequently, it cannot measure all 90+ microcystins variants that might be present in the water. The detailed procedure of LC-MS/MS is available in Appendix I.

26

CHAPTER TWO 2.9.1.1 Matrix and Matrix Interference In environmental analytical chemistry, the type of sample obtained from different environments contains different constitutes. For example, surface water, untreated source water and treated drinking water have entirely different chemical constituents; the first one may be rich in biomass, the second one has no chlorine but third one is filtered and chlorinated. These three types of water would be considered as three different matrices in which the analyte (microcystins) is sought after.

Matrix interference refers to the components of sample other than the target analyte that interfere with the test result such that reliable data cannot be generated. Examples of matrix interference include samples with extreme pH, chemical constituents that react with target analyte, and sludgy samples or samples over-saturated with biomass. Since the exact component which causes unreliable results is usually undetermined, such undesirable effects on the result due to a particular matrix are generally referred to as matrix effect.

Microcystins are analysed by liquid chromatography (LC)-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer at the LaSB of MOE. Method#3450 is an approved method for the analysis of microcystin-LR by MOE. A variety of matrices can affect the analysis of LC-MS/MS. Chemical interferences, that are not resolved by chromatography or the unit mass resolution of the tandem quadrupoles, may be present in some samples. These samples may require additional selectivity via additional sample clean-up and/or higher resolution MS/MS or MS/MS/MS, high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) or Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS). The sample preparation method is restricted to water samples. Applicability of the method to samples with very high organic content, such as effluents and water containing high concentrations of humic materials, is unknown.

Algal toxin stability is possibly matrix dependent. The presence of microbes, humic material and residual chlorine may contribute to compound losses (MOE SOP#3450-2012).

27

CHAPTER TWO 2.9.2 ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a biochemical technique that involves antibodies and enzyme for the detection of microcystins in a sample. Most commonly used techniques are based on two principles: direct competitive ELISA and indirect competitive ELISA.

Direct competitive ELISA is based on the principle that microcystin-LR in the sample compete with microcystin-LR-peroxidase for the limited number of binding sites of anti-microcystins antibody attached to the microtiter plate. The strength of the colour development is inversely proportional to the concentration of microcystins (Carmichael & An, 1999). In an indirect competitive ELISA, microcystins present in sample and a monoclonal antibody against microcystin-LR compete for the binding sites on a microcystin-LR-Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) coated plate. A secondary antibody conjugate (HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG) is added and finally addition of substrate produces color. The intensity of the color is inversely proportional to the concentration of the microcystins present in the sample (Carmichael & An, 1999). The results by immunoassays are compared to a standard curve with the known concentrations. Microcystin-LR is used as a calibrating agent and the amount of microcystins can be reported as microcystins-LR equivalents (Harda et al., 1999).

Specificity refers to the ability of an individual antibody or enzyme to react with only one antigen or substrate, respectively (Mayer, 2010). Antibody specificity measures the degree to which the antibody differentiates between different antigens. Cross-reactivity measures the extent to which different antigens appear similar to the antibody (Frank SA, 2002). Sensitivity is the ability to recognize and bind to antigen. In practical terms, the sensitivity of an ELISA is described by the method detection limit (MDL).

Antibodies used in ELISA can be polyclonal (Fischer et al., 2001; An & Carmichael et al., 1994; McDermott et al., 1995) or monoclonal (Zech et al., 2001) produced against microcystin-LR. Finding a reliable method to detect multiple variants of microcystins in a single sample has always been a challenge. Current anti-ADDA technology can detect multiple variants of microcystins with acceptable sensitivity. ADDA (3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-1028

CHAPTER TWO phenyldeca-4,6-dienoic acid) component of microcystins is present in > 80% of known toxic variants of microcystins (Metcalf et al., 2001) and nodularins. Polyclonal antibodies as compare to monoclonal antibodies react with more microcystins variants and nodularin (Metcalf et al., 2001). Polyclonal-ADDA-ELISA slightly overestimates the total microcystins due to recognition of the free ADDA moiety (Metcalfl et al., 2001) which is non-toxic but could possibly be present in occasional environmental samples.

ADDA moiety can be detected by monoclonal-ADDA-ELISA (Zech et al., 2001). However, the cross reactivity of monoclonal antibodies with variants other than -LR is weaker or absent, compare to the polyclonal antibody to ADDA. Monoclonal-ADDA-ELISA might underestimate the sum of microcystins congeners of microcystins (Abraxis, 2008).

Polyclonal-ADDA-ELISA kit by Abraxis is used at MOE to capture as many variants as possible in order to access the magnitude of potential health risk. This kit is based on the indirect competitive ELISA principle. A brief summary of cross reactivity of ELISA antibodies with variants by Abraxis (manufacturer) versus few other researches has been summarized the Table 5.

The antibodies against microcystins are detected by the enzyme labelled (Horse redish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase or fluorescence labeled) to them. Enzyme produce colored signal which are measured with spectrophotometer. The most commonly used enzyme in ELISA is horse reddish Peroxidase (HRP) because of its smaller size which reduce steric hindrance of the antibody moleclue (Azevedo et al., 2003). Peroxidase is also economical, rapid and a more stable enzyme than the other enzymes.

2.9.3 Protein Phosphatase Inhibition Assay (PPIA) Phosphatase inhibition activity of microcystins can be detected in water samples directly using an enzyme protein phosphatase 2A and a substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate in a colorimetric phosphatase inhibition assay (MacKintosh et al., 1990). Sample is incubated with protein phosphatase enzymes 1A or 2A. Microcystins present in the sample binds to the protein phosphatase. Dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (substrate) by protein phosphatase 30

CHAPTER TWO to p-nitrophenol at high pH produces a yellow color which is measured with spectrophotometer (405nm absorbance). The strength of this color is inversely proportional to the concentration of microcystins present in the sample (Carmichael & An, 1999). Although assays have been developed for both PP1 and PP2A, the reaction of microcystins with PP1 is around 50 times less sensitive than with PP2A (McElhiney & Lawton, 2005) and so is not as popularly used.

The limitations of PPIA are, it is not specific to microcystins, other non-microcystins protein phosphatase inhibitors are detectable too, (Albay et al., 2003) such as okadeic acid and not all the microcystins variants react with protein phosphatase enzymes to a similar extent (Sangolkar et al., 2006).

An advantage of PPIA over ELISA is its ability to detect bioactivity of microcystins, rather than limited recognition of a structural component (Carmichael & An, 1999). The affinity of microcystins for protein phosphatases is particularly high, such that very low levels of toxin are detectable (Sim & Mudge, 1993).

2.10 Comparison of ELISA, LC-MS/MS and PPIA LC-MS/MS, ELISA and PPIA have their own advantages and limitations for the detection of microcystins. Hence, no single technique is sufficient in providing both a precise measurement of toxicity and an accurate profile of the microcystins variants (McElhiney & Lawton, 2005). ELISA can detect total microcystins, PPIA measures the toxicity and LC-MS/MS can identify four individual variants (-LR, -YR, -RR and -LA). A literature review on the historic development and comparisons of these three analytical methods are summarized below.

McDermott et al, (1995) generated antibodies against microcystin-LR and designed an ELISA. They reported an agreement between ELISA and HPLC results.

Ward et al, (1997) reported that colorimetric protein phosphatase inhibition assay can underestimate microcystins at concentration lower than 0.8ng/mg dry wt. They found a good correlation with R2> 0.93 and p< 0.0001 between PPIA and HPLC, and recommended PPIA as a suitable method for screening the microcystins. 31

CHAPTER TWO Rivasseau et al, (1999) compared the results of microcystins from a commercially available ELISA kit (unnamed) with the results obtained from solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography (n=8, r2=0.989. The detection limit was 0.1 to 0.15µg/L in ground water and surface water. The kit proved to be capable of displaying reproducibility and accuracy in analyzing environmental water samples for the detection of microcystins. Cross reactivity among some microcystins variants was observed.

Carmichael & An (1999) reported that ELISA and PPIA are less quantitative than the physicochemical assays but they are just as sensitive, more rapid and useful in the screening of environmental samples. He suggested that ELISA technique can be used successfully for routine screening of water for microcystins contamination (Msagati et al., 2006; Metcalf et al., 2002).

Tsutsumi et al, (2000) compared sandwich type of ELISA with the direct ELISA. Sandwich ELISA was found to be more sensitive with a detection limit of 2 to 100 pg/mL (ng/L or ppt) and also showed a good cross reactivity towards -RR and -YR variants of microcystins.

Lawrence & James et al, (2001) compared microcystins results by ELISA, PPIA and LC-MS/MS in more than 100 blue-green algae products in the form of pills, capsules, and powders. The samples were extracted with 75% methanol in water and centrifuged to remove solids before analysis. The results obtained by ELISA and PPIA agreed well with LC-MS/MS over a concentration range of about 0.5-35g/g. However, research paper does not explain the selection criteria of certain analytical technique for a chosen sample because not all the samples were tested by three methods. Research paper is also not clear about the performance of agreement calculation among three methods.

Zeck, Anne et al, (2001) developed a direct competitive ELISA with a monoclonal antibody (clone (MC10E7). Microcystin-LR spiked samples in the concentration range between 0.01 and 0.1g/L were measured and a mean recovery of 99.9±16.4% was achieved. The detection limit for microcystin-LR was 6ng/L (ppt). Antibodies used in this assay were also tested for its robustness against interference from humic acids, pH, salt content, surfactants or organic

32

CHAPTER TWO solvents. The antibodies were found to be very stable. The assay was found to be extraordinary sensitive and highly selective for microcystin-LR analysis in drinking and surface water samples.

Metcalf et al, (2001) developed a PPIA to overcome the specificity problem of PPIA inhibition to not only microcystins and nodularins but also other inhibitors such as okadiac acid, calyculin A and tautomycin. They combined the immunoassay based detection of the toxins with a colorimetric protein phosphatase inhibition system in a single assay, designated the colorimetric immuno-protein phosphatase inhibition assay (CIPPIA). Samples were incubated with anti-LR antibodies which will neutralize any microcystins if present. Subsequent addition of protein phosphatase will produce an enzyme reaction because the antibodies protected the enzyme from the inhibition by microcystins. CIPPIA was quantifiable by calculating a protective index based on the colorimetric enzyme reaction relative to controls using microcystin-LR standard, immune serum and pre-immune serum. The protective index values distinguished seven purified microcystins variants (microcystin-LR, -D-Asp3-RR, -LA, -LF, -LY, -LW, and -YR) and nodularin from okadaic acid, calyculin A, and tautomycin. CIPPIA showed a good correlation (R2=0.94, P<0.00001) with high-performance liquid chromatography.

Fischer et al., (2001) raised antibodies to ADDA and developed an indirect competitive ELISA. The MDL of the assay was 0.02-0.07 ng/mL (µg/L) for drinking water and surface water. ELISA was found to be more sensitive (5-folds) than PPIA for the detection of microcystins in the surface water. He recommended that ADDA-based ELISA is a powerful tool to detect the numerous variants of microcystins and nodularins at the levels below the WHO guidelines (1.0µg/L) for drinking water without any sample preparation.

Heresztyn and Nicolson et al., (2001) developed a colorimetric phosphatase inhibition assay using protein phosphatase enzyme type 2 subunit A (PP2A) and p-nitro phenyl phosphate as substrate for the detection of microcystins. The assay was comparable with radiolabelled substrate phosphatase inhibition assay with working range of 0.2­1µg/L. The assay was robust and was not affected by matrix interference.

33

CHAPTER TWO oua cha et al., (2002) compared colorimetric and fluorometric protein phosphatase inhibition assay for the detection of cyanobacterial peptide hepatotoxins in drinking water. The colorimetric assay was equally sensitive to fluorometric method with the detection limit range of 0.25 to 0.1µg/L. Colorimetric PPIA method does not provide detailed information on the chemical identity of the inhibitors present in the water samples. However, it was found to be an easy and economical screening tool to detect the toxic microcystins variants to reduce the number of water samples that may require further analyses by other more expensive and elaborate method.

Rapala et al., (2002) compared colorimetric PPIA, a commercial ELISA test and HPLC methods for the detection of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins; microcystins (MCYST) and nodularin. Concentrations of microcystins variants detected by ELISA were lower than the other methods (PPIA & HPLC). However, it was found that ELISA can accurately detect the presence or absence of total microcystins and PPIA can accurately detect the toxicity.

Michael & Greogry (2002) compared PPIA and ELISA. The similarity Index (SI) of 86% was found between PPIA and ELISA (Table 6).

Metcalf et al., (2003) found the mean recovery efficiency of ELISA was between 99% and 101% for the evaluation of microcystins in the water. False positive results were produced in the ample

34

CHAPTER TWO spiked with sodium chloride. The findings are critical for the analysis of microcystins in the brackish water.

Mathys & Surholt (2004) compared HPLC and ELISA. Microcystins was analysed by using a commercially available ELISA kit (EnviroGardTM, Germany). They made some modifications to the ELISA protocol by modifying incubation time and temperature. The modified ELISA results agreed very closely to the sum of variants of microcystin -YR, -RR, and -RR tested by HPLC.

Hawkins et al., (2005) analysed cyanobacterial cells by microscopy and microcystins by mouse bioassay, ELISA, PCR, PPIA, HPLC and LC-MS/MS. The performance of each method was measured on the basis of microcystins detection limit, cost, level of analyst training required, selectivity for microcystins, and turnaround time. ELISA was ranked first due to its advantages. PPIA and ELISA together were found to be the methods of choices to detect toxic microcystins accurately. PCR was found to be highly sensitive and not costly either, but its use was recommended in a combined assay format. HPLC and microscopy were ranked in the mid-range. Microscopy was cheaper but not recommended due to false results. LC-MS/MS was found to be very expensive. The mouse assay was excluded due to its sensitivity, which was below the WHO drinking water guideline (1.0µg/L).

Hilborn et al, (2005) used a commercial ELISA (EnviroLogix, Inc., Portland, ME, USA) to analyse microcystins in human serum and compared the results with LC-MS/MS. The spearman correlation was calculated between the two methods. A good correlation (Spearman r = 0.96, p < 0.0001) was found. ELISA was concluded as a reliable and affordable assay to screen microcystins in human sera.

Pyo et al, (2005) developed a competitive enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on monoclonal antibodies against microcystins -LR. The ELISA was highly sensitive and suitable for the trace analysis of microcystins in water. The linear response between monoclonal antibodies with different concentrations of microcystin-LR was established between 30 and 1600pg/mL (ng/L or ppt). 35

CHAPTER TWO Sheng et al, (2006) generated polyclonal antibodies by immunization of MC-LR-BSA (microcystin-LR conjugated to bovine serum albumin) for a direct competitive ELISA to detect microcystins in water. The assay showed a good cross-reactivity with microcystin-variants (-LR, -RR, -YR, -LF, -LW) and nodularin. The detection limit for microcystin-LR was 0.12µg/L. The recovery of microcystins from spiked samples by ELISA was 90 to 110%.

Bruno et al, (2006) used LC-MS/MS to measure the recovery of four microcystins-variants (-LR, -YR, -LA, -RR) in food supplements and compared the recovery of total microcystins by ELISA. In a t-test, significant difference was observed between ELISA and LC-MS/MS (t = 0.00215, p<0.05) in pills but not in capsules (t = 0.247202, p<0.05). They speculated that the underestimation of microcystins by ELISA was possibly due its different sensitivities for some toxic variants.

Sangolkar et al, (2006) in their review suggested that bioassays like ELISA and PPIA provide enough information regarding presence or absence of toxin. Hence, they can be used to screen microcystins in the water. Samples positive by these methods can be further analysed for qualitatively and quantitatively for the variants by HPLC coupled to photodiode array (PDA) detector or MS.

Tillmans et al, (2007) reported that ELISA and HPLC produced similar results for microcystinLR standards. However, concentration of microcystins detected by ELISA was found to be four times higher than HPLC in environmental samples. The difference may depend on number of variants in situ and number of microcystins that can be identified by HPLC.

Ikehara et al, (2008) expressed a catalytic subunit A of the recombinant protein phosphatase (rPP2A) in a baculovirus system. The rPP2A enzyme was then used in a microplate PPIA. This version of PPIA using a recombinant enzyme subunit is referred to as PP2A. They reported that PP2A was able to detect microcystins concentrations from 0.005 to 5ng/mL (ppt) in fresh water. Pre-treatment of water samples was not necessary. This microplate assay was more sensitive than ELISA. Hence, rPP2A based PPIA was found to be an excellent tool for detecting and quantifying the toxicity in water. 36

CHAPTER TWO Geis-Asteggiante et al, (2011) used multiple samples extraction methods of fish for the analysis of microcystins and nodularins. The samples were analysed by ELISA and LC-MS/MS. The comparison indicated that ELISA was unable to distinguish between microcystins variants but correctly assessed the presence or absence of microcystins and nodularin-R in the fish tissues.

Sassolas, Audrey, et al, (2011) developed a colorimetric phosphatase inhibition assay for the detection of microcystin-LR. He tested microcystins with a molecularly engineered PP1 and a commercial PP2As (Millipore, ZEU Immunotec). To overcome the instability problem of protein phosphatase enzymes, both PP2A and PP1 were entrapped on agarose gel. Results based on PP2A from ZEU Immunotec immobilised showed the best performances with a detection limit of 0.17µg/L and PP1 (molecularly engineered) showed a detection limit of 0.28µg/L. These results demonstrated that both assays can detect concentration of microcystin-LR lower than the maximum than the WHO guideline (1.0µg/L).

Pírez, Macarena et al, (2013) used a commercial ELISA (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA, USA) for the detection of microcystins to establish a sustainable monitoring program for recreational water. The ELISA was able to detect 1000-fold higher microcystins than the WHO limit (20µg/L for moderate risk) for recreational water. ELISA results demonstrated that cyanobacterial cell counts and chlorophyll-a (parameters for indirect estimation of toxicity) were poor indicators that can be highly misleading. ELISA proved to be more economical, rapid and reliable for the monitoring of microcystins in the water.

The entire literature review is summarized in Table 7, which showed two dominant groups; Group 1 in which ELISA overestimates microcystins and Group 2 where ELISA detects accurately. The reason for Group 1 could be the presence of more microcystins variants which other techniques (HPLC and LC-MS/MS) cannot detect due to limited standards. Group 2, could represent study sample that contained mainly those microcystin variants which are detectable by LC-MS/MS. Thus, literature review leads to a clear conclusion that sensitivity of ELISA is equal to or greater than LC-MS/MS for the detection of total microcystin concentration.

Although ELISA reports total microcystins, it does not provide toxicity information. The current MOE drinking water guideline of 1.5g/L is based on the toxicity of the microcystin-LR variant. At similar concentrations, toxicity due to other variant or mixture of variants would be different 39

CHAPTER TWO from that of microcystin-LR. Hence, a toxicity assay is desirable. Five articles (Fischer et al., 2001; Sim & Mudge, 1993; Sassolas, Audrey et al., 2011; oua cha et al., 2002; Heresztyn &

Nicolson, 2001) agreed that colorimetric PPIA can detect the total toxicity of microcystins without any matrix interference (Heresztyn & Nicolson, 2001). This was further confirmed by six more studies (Ward, Clive et al., 1997; Rapala et al., 2002; Robillot & Hennion, 2004; Sangolkar et al., 2006) that found good agreements between PPIA and HPLC, and PPIA and LCMS/MS (Lawrence & James, 2001). However, PPIA is not specific to microcystins. It can also detect other non-microcystins, protein phosphatase inhibitors such as okadeic acid and calyculin A (Albay et al., 2003; Lin et al., 1994; Metcalf et al., 2000).

In summary, literature review very clearly indicates that use of ELISA and PPIA together can provide enough information to protect the public from microcystins toxicity (Mountfort et al., 2005; Carmichael & An, 1999, Rapala et al., 2002; Lawrence & James, 2001; Ikehara et al., 2008) and more meaningful regulations for drinking water can be established based on these two assays.

Agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS

Microcystins are analyzed at Laboratory Services Branch (LaSB) of Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) by ELISA and LC-MS/MS. The data was retrieved through Laboratory information system (LIMS) of MOE from 210 to 2012. This chapter will cover in detail the material, method, agreement calculation between ELSIA and LC-MS/MS results, summary and discussion. The details of agreement calculations are as follow: 3.1 Material and Method

Microcystins test results by both methods (ELISA and LC-MS/MS) were collected from MOE data base (2010 to 2012).The microcystins test results will be organized in two separate and distinct categories from each year for good reasons. The two categories are: drinking water (WD) and surface water (WS). One of the reasons for doing so is because drinking water testing falls under the regulations governed by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) 2002. On the contrary, surface water usually represents recreational water from beaches or rivers; the testing of these samples is not regulated under any legislation. Another reason is that the Method Detection Limit (MDL) depends on matrix effect. Raw or drinking water, before or after water treatment plant processing respectively, is relatively clear from matrix effect. Consequently MDLs are achievable by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS methods. On the contrary, WS usually contain debris and impurities that may exert matrix effect to various extents. In the case of ELISA this matrix effect could be eliminated by clarifying the water samples simply by centrifugation. This is not the case with LC-MS/MS method, where values of microcystins has to be raised sometimes by 50-fold in order to disregard the noise.

Once, the data organized into two types of matrices (WS, WD) from each year, microcystins values by both methods will be compared and sorted depending upon the MDL (ELISA 0.15 µg/L , LC- MS/MS 0.05 µg/L ) of each and will be placed in 4 Tables: (1) samples positive by both methods (ELISA and LC- MS/MS) (2) samples positive by ELISA and negative by LCMS/MS (3) samples negative by ELISA and positive by LC-MS/MS (4) samples negative by both methods (ELISA and LC- MS/MS). The results higher than MDL will be highlighted in red color and lower or equal to MDL in green color.

2010 Agreement Calculation between ELISA and LC-MS/MS

Microcystins samples tested by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS in 2010 are sorted on matrix type in two groups; WS and WD. These two groups are discussed individually and then summarized collectively in one table for the agreement calculation of whole year (2010). The details of the agreement calculations are as follow: 3.2.1 2010 Surface Water (WS) Results ­ Agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS In 2010, ELISA and LC-MS/MS test results were available on 77 surface water samples. These 77 samples are sorted in Table 9 to 11 and Table A1 according to agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS results. Where there was disagreement, due diligence was given to consider the results in terms of (1) test reliability and (2) impact on environmental and public health.

42

CHAPTER THREE 3.2.1.1 ELISA Positive and LC-MS/MS Negative Samples Table 9 depicts five samples which were found positive by ELISA and negative by LC-MS/MS. The normal MDL of LC-MS/MS is 0.05µg/L in the absence of matrix interference, which was the case in counter #1 to #3. In these three cases, the quantities of microcystins detected by ELISA are well below Ontario Drinking Water Guidelines (1.5µg/L) therefore imparting no health threat. It is possible that ELISA were detecting variants other than those four analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

Counter #5 describes a sample with noticeable matrix interference. In this case, the MDL of the LC-MS/MS has to be raised 40-fold from 0.05 to 2.0µg/L in order to disregard the background noise. As a result, the 2.8µg/L microcystins detected by ELISA had escaped by LC-MS/MS detection. Since this quantity exceeds the Ontario Drinking Water Guidelines, this surface water poses a health threat especially to wild life.

Counter #4 describes a scenario similar to but less severe than Counter #5. In this case, the matrix interference prompted a 10-fold MDL elevation and subsequent non-detect for variants by LC-MS/MS. The 0.41µg/L quantity detected by ELISA poses an acceptable health risk. Counter #4 could be viewed as a continuum between Counter #1 to #5.

Samples in Table 9 are excellent candidates if available for PPIA analysis in order to assess potential toxicity.

43

CHAPTER THREE 3.2.1.2 ELISA Negative and LC-MS/MS Positive Samples Table 10 represents the samples found positive by LC-MS/MS and negative by ELISA. Values from counters #1 to #7, #10, #11 are less than WHO threshold (1.0µg/L) by both methods. LCMS/MS in counter #8, #9 #12, and #13 have values higher or equal to SDWA threshold but negative by ELISA. These four samples pose a significant threat to wild animals and environment. However, it is very strange that in counter #9 all values by LC-MS/MS are identical and MDL by LC-MS/MS had been raised 5-folds which make the results of this sample questionable.

At first glance on the Table 10, one common element can be observed that -LA variant of microcystins is positive by LC-MS/MS for all the samples. Perhaps the antibodies from Abraxis (2009b) kit are not specific against -LA but this phenomenon is no longer observed in the following years (2011-2012).

3.2.1.3 Samples Positive by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS Table 11 exhibits a good agreement between LC-MS/MS and ELISA samples from counter #1 to #16. However, all ELISA values are slightly higher than LC-MS/MS. This trend suggests the 44

CHAPTER THREE hypothesis that ELISA can detect more variants of microcystins than LC-MS/MS. This hypothesis can be tested using PPIA to assess toxicity and potential health concerns.

The value of only one sample in counter #17 is above WHO threshold (1.0µg/L) by LC-MS/MS and below by ELISA. But the values of two variants (-YR and -RR) by LC-MS/MS in this sample have identical results and also the MDL is 5-folds higher than normal MDL (0.05µg/L) which represents the high matrix interference. Hence, the reliability of the LC-MS/MS results is questionable in this case and this particular sample can be considered invalid and can be excluded from this data set.

Values in counter #18 to #21 are close to SDWA (1.5µg/L) threshold by ELISA but below by LC-MS/MS. Possibly the higher values of ELISA are due to its sensitivity towards multiple

45

CHAPTER THREE variant of microcystins. These three samples can also be further tested by PPIA if available to assess any potential environmental threat.

Scattered chart (Fig.8) was plotted from the data set provided in Table 11 in order to better understand the correlation between ELISA and LC-MS/MS results. ELISA values were represented on in y-axis while LC-MS/MS were in x-axis. A trend line was drawn and also the R2 was calculated. The results from the scattered chart suggest a significant correlation between ELISA and LC-MS/MS of surface water from 2012 as shown by linear regression (R2=0.8489). Two values in counter #19 and #20 were outliers. Both values are higher than SDWA threshold but are in agreement by both methods.

3.2.1.4 Samples Negative by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS Overall, there is a good agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS negative results represented in Appendix A-Table A1. However, in counter #2 to # 5, #19 and #20 MDL of LC-MS/MS had been elevated due to the matrix interference. In the case of counter # 5 the MDL was raised up to 2.5µg/L which is higher than the Ontario Safe Drinking Water Guidelines (1.5µg/L). This is an example when the usefulness of LC-MS/MS to measure health impact is hampered by matrix 46

CHAPTER THREE interference. Such matrix interference is entirely absent in ELISA judging by the results in Table A1 (Appendix A).

3.2.2 2010 WS Agreement Calculation The agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS can be divided in two groups. The first group includes all samples with an agreement between ESLIA and LC-MS/MS. The agreement (Table 11+Table A1) calculated for surface water samples in 2010 is 77% which comprised of 59/77 samples as shown in Table 12.

2010 WS Test Results ELISA Tested

LC-MS/MS Tested Positive Negative 21 5 Positive 13 38 Negative 34 43 Agreement = 77%

Total 26 51 77

Five samples (counter #17 to #21) in Table 11 from the agreement group were found to have some discrepancy. In four samples (counter #18 to #21) out of these five, ELISA exhibits values equal or above WHO (1.0µg/L) guidelines and LC-MS/MS values well below. Perhaps the higher value of ELISA is due to it is cross reactivity with more variants of microcystins. These four samples can be further analyzed by PPIA to find out any potential toxicity. The fifth sample in counter #17 (Table 11) has the opposite scenario where cumulative value of all variants by LC-MS/MS is 2.25µg/L and ELISA value for the same sample is only 0.5µg/L. The MDL of LC-MS/MS in this case is very high and values of two variants are also identical. Probably the LC-MS/MS values needed to be adjusted due to high matrix interference. The results from this sample are not reliable.

The second group comprised of surface water samples from 2010 with an agreement between ESLIA and LC-MS/MS. The disagreement of 23% (Table 9+Table 10) consists of eighteen samples. Thirteen samples have values below the Ontario Drinking Water guidelines thus pose no threat to health and environment. However, rest of the five samples can be toxic as four (counter #8, #9, #12, #13) out of these five samples in Table 10 have values higher than SDWA

47

CHAPTER THREE threshold (1.5µg/L) by LC-MS/MS but they are negative by ELISA. Perhaps the matrix interference or low specificity of antibodies from Abraxis kit towards the four variants (-LR, -YR, -RR, -LA) of microcystins. In the case of counter # 9 (Table 10) the identical values of two variants by LC-MS/MS show matrix interference. Hence the results from this counter are questionable.

The fifth sample (counter #5) in Table 9 has ELISA value 2.8µg/L and is negative by LCMS/MS. The identical values of all four variants by LC-MS/MS and high MDL (2.0 µg/L) in this sample represents high matrix interference. Therefore the test result of this sample is unreliable and can be excluded from disagreement group. 3.2.3 2010 Drinking Water (WD) Results ­ Agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS In 2010, there were 148 samples drinking water sample requested for ELISA and LC-MS/MS. These samples are divided into four Tables (13 to 15 and A2) according to the agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS results.

3.2.3.1 ELISA Positive and LC-MS/MS Negative Samples Table 13 represents seven samples that are positive by ELISA and negative by LC-MS-MS. All these seven samples (counter #1 to #7) are below the Ontario Drinking Water Guidelines (1.5µg/L) therefore pose no health threat.

However, the value in counter #7 is above the WHO threshold of 1.0µg/L by ELISA and negative by LC-MS/MS. This sample if available can be further analysed by PPIA for the toxicity to avoid any harmful health impact. Sample in counter # 7 represents a potential threat that escaped LC-MS/MS detection but positive by ELISA.

CHAPTER THREE The value of 0.15µg/L means that the detected values of ELISA lies between 0.05µg/L to 0.15µg/L and all the values within this range were rounded up to the significant number of 0.15µg/L. Counter #9, #10, #11 represent truly non-detect by ELISA when the signal were below 0.05µg/L.

Second the cumulative values of four variants (-LR,-YR, -RR, -LA) by LC-MS/MS (assuming 0.05µg/L is equal to zero µg/L) in all samples (counter#1 to #8) are slightly higher than ELISA but they are still well below the SDWA threshold (1.5µg/L).

In summary, all 11 samples in Table 14 pose no health threat even when ELISA was negative.

3.2.3.3 Samples Positive by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS Table 15 illustrates a good agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS from Counter #1 to counter #25. However, in all these twenty five samples ELISA shows quite higher values than LC-MS/MS. Perhaps antibodies from Abraxis kit are able to react with multiple variants of microcystins therefore ELISA is producing higher results than LC-MS/MS.

In the cases of counter #23 to #25 the values by ELISA are close or higher than Ontario Drinking Water Guidelines (1.5µg/L) but this concern is not reflected by the low values of LC-MS/MS. All samples in this Table if available will be further investigated by PPIA to exclude any possible toxicity threat.

3.2.4 2010 WD Agreement Calculation Table 16 summarize all 148 drinking water samples tested in 2010. The agreement of 88% (Table 15+Table A2) between ELISA and LC-MS/MS comprised of 130 samples (25+105). Among these 130 samples, only three samples (counter #23 to #25 in Table 15) exhibit noticeable difference between values by ELISA and LC-MS/MS. ELISA values in these 3 cases were close to or above the WHO threshold (1.0µg/L) whereas LC-MS/MS showed low, nonthreatening values.

CHAPTER THREE The disagreement of 12% (Table 13+Table 14) consists of eighteen samples (7+11). The values of microcystins in the seventeen samples are below the threshold (1.5µg/L) of SDWA. Hence, they are considered to be safe drinking water in Ontario. Only one sample (counter #7 in Table 13) from this group had high values by ELISA and escaped detection by LC-MS/MS. The cross reactivity of antibodies with numerous variants of microcystins could explain why ELISA is a better detection method. All samples with higher ELISA values than LC-MS/MS or samples positive by ELISA and negative by LC-MS/MS will be considered for toxicity estimation by PPIA.

3.2.5 2010 WS and WD Agreement Calculation Table 17 includes all drinking water and surface water samples from 2010. A good agreement of 84% between ELISA and LC-MS/MS supports the reliability of ELISA for microcystins analysis in water samples. Total water samples tested in 2010 were 225.

Total 58 167 225

The agreement (Table 11+Table A1+Table 15+Table A2) part of 84% comprised of 189 samples. ELISA values in 7 samples (counter #18 to #21-Table 11, counter#23 to #25-Table 15) were found equal to or above the WHO threshold while LC-MS/MS values were not. Only one sample (counter # 17-Table 11) was above SDWA by LC-MS/MS but below SDWA by ELISA. However, the reliability of the LC-MS/MS results in this case is questionable because (1) its MDL is very high and (2) two variants exhibited identical values. These two observations occurred frequently in samples with high matrix interference rendering the LC-MS/MS results unreliable.

The 16% of disagreement (Table 9+Table 10+Table 13+Table 14) consist of 36 samples. Six samples from this group are in strong disagreement. Three samples (counter #8, #12, and #13 in 53

CHAPTER THREE Table 10) out of these six were above SDWA threshold by LC-MS/MS and non-detect by ELISA. The value of fourth sample (counter # 9-Table 10) was also higher than SDWA threshold and non-detect by ELISA. However, in this case values of all four variants (-LR, -YR, -RR, -LA) have identical values by LCM-MS/MS, hence not a reliable test result. The fifth and sixth samples from disagreement group (counter #5-Table 9, counter #7-Table 13) had ELISA results higher than WHO limit (1.0µg/L) while LC-MS/MS missed it. ELISA missed only three samples out of 225 samples in 2010 where it was unable to detect microcystins in the water. These 3 surface water samples were toxic by SDWA and pose a health threat to wild life. Failure of ELISA to detect microcystins in these 3 cases remained unexplained. This phenomenon will be searched for in the following years to see if it occurs repeatedly.

3.3

2011 Agreement Calculation between ELISA and LC-MS/MS

Microcystins samples tested by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS in 2011 are sorted on matrix type in two groups; WS and WD. These two groups are discussed individually and then summarized collectively in one table for the agreement calculation of whole year (2011). The details of the agreement calculations are as follow 3.3.1 2011 Surface Water (WS) Results ­ Agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS In 2011, the number of surface water samples tested for microcystins by ELISA and LC-MS/MS were 103. All samples are organized in Table 18 to 20 and Table A3 based on the agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS values.

3.3.1.1 ELISA Positive and LC-MS/MS Negative Samples Table 18 represents the surface water samples that were positive by ELISA and negative by LCMS/MS in 2011. Matrix interference is observed in counter #1, #4, #6 and #7 where values of all microcystins variants by LC-MS/MS are identical and MDL had been raised.

Values in counter #1 to #5 are below the SDWA threshold (1.5µg/L) by both methods therefore they pose no threat to the environment.

However, in all these counters (#1 to #5) ELISA exhibits slightly higher values than LC-MS/MS. ELISA values in counter #6 and #7 are above Ontario drinking water guidelines and below by LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS results of these two counters are unreliable because matrix interference caused the MDL in counter #6 and #7 to be raised 10- and 50-folds, respectively. PPIA will be performed on all these seven samples if available will be further investigated for toxicity analysis.

55

CHAPTER THREE Values in counter #1 to #4 and counter #6 to #8 are well below the SDWA threshold (1.5µg/L) by both test methods. Hence they are considered no threat to wildlife or environment. Only one sample (counter #5) has value above the Ontario Drinking Water Guidelines by LC-MS/MS but non-detect by ELISA. This sample could potentially pose a borderline threat to wildlife and environment.

3.3.1.3 Samples Positive by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS When samples in Table 20 are sorted by ELISA positivity in ascending order, they appear to fall into three groups. The first group comprises counter #1 to #22; exhibits a good agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS.

The second group is represented by three samples (counter #23, #24, #25) where the quantities of microcystins detected by ELISA are somewhat less than the sum of the LC-MS/MS variants. But both samples are still in agreement as they are positive by both methods. Counter #23 is unique; ELISA found 0.55µg/L of microcystins which were not detected by LC-MS/MS. Surprisingly, this sample contained 3000µg/L of Anatoxin-a. Matrix interference in this sample imposed a 10fold elevation of MDL to 0.5µg/L.

The third group consists of counter #26 to #33 where ELISA results are 4 to 5-folds higher than LC-MS/MS. The trend in this group supports the hypothesis that ELISA can detect more variants of microcystins than LC-MS/MS. These samples if available will be further verified by using PPIA to assess the toxicity and potential health concerns.

Scattered plot between ELISA and total LC-MS/MS was performed on the data in Table 20. Three samples (counter #21, #22, #25) found to be outliers. Although, the values of these outliers were in reasonable agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS buthese higher values diminished the correlation in the scatted plot. Hence, these three data points removed from the data set. A strong correlation was found by linear regression with a value of R2=0.8875 (Fig.10). 57

CHAPTER THREE The disagreement (Table 18+Table 19) of 15% is composed of 15 (8+7) samples. Twelve samples had values below WHO by both methods. Thus they are safe for the environment. However, in 2 samples (counter #6, #7 in Table 18) values were above SDWA by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS and in third sample (counter 5 in Table19) value of microcystins were equal to SDWA by LC-MS/MS and non-detect by ELISA. These three samples pose threat to wild animals and environment. 2011 Drinking Water (WD) Results ­ Agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS

3.3.3

Drinking water samples tested for microcystins in 2011 are organized in Table 22 to 24 and A4 according to the agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS test results.

3.3.3.1 ELISA Positive and LC-MS/MS Negative Samples Table 22 summarize drinking water samples from year 2011, which were positive by ELISA and negative by LC-MS/MS.

Values in counter #1 to #20 are below the Ontario Drinking Water Guideline. Hence these samples pose no health threat. However, one value in counter #21 is above SDWA threshold by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS. This sample will be analysed if available by PPIA to find out any potential toxicity by microcystins.

3.3.3.2 ELISA Negative and LC-MS/MS Positive Samples Table 23 represents the drinking water samples found positive by LC-MS/MS and negative by ELISA in 2011.

Upon close examination of the Table 23, two observations can be made. First, all values by LCMS/MS are below SDWA threshold (1.5µg/L) therefore posing no health threat. Second, ELISA values from counter #1 to #18 are not "non-detect" but rather the small quantities were rounded to the MDL of 0.15µg/L. By this rationale, 18 samples (counter #1 to #18) are in agreement and five samples (counter #19 to #23) truly disagree. Fortunately, all five LC-MS/MS values (counter #19 to counter #23) were much lower than Ontario Drinking Water Guidelines (1.5µg/L) by both methods. Therefore they pose no significant health threat either.

The second group comprised of samples (counter #36 to #42 and #44) where ELISA values are close to or above the SDWA threshold (1.5µg/L) and below by LC-MS/MS. These eight samples will be investigated by PPIA if available for microcystins toxicity.

At a glance, a conclusion can be made from the values given in Table 24 that ELISA produce higher positive results of microcystins than LC-MS/MS, which was also observed in the data set from 2010. This reproducible observation supports our hypothesis that probably antibodies used in ELISA have the ability to cross react with multiple variants of microcystins, hence ELSIA produce higher positive results as compare to LC-MS/MS.

The scattered plot between ELISA and LC-MS/MS values in Table 24 represents an acceptable correlation (R2=0.7024) ((Fig.11).

The agreement (Table 24+Table A4) calculated between both methods is 74% which is comprised of 128 (45+83) drinking water samples. Among these 128 samples, values of eight samples (counter #36 to #42, #45 in Table 24) were above WHO threshold by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS.

The disagreement (Table 22+Table 23) of 26% consists of 44 (21+23) samples. Value of one sample (counter #21-Table 22) out of 44 was above SDWA threshold by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS. In total, nine drinking water samples from 2011 posed potential health threats that deserve further toxicity assessment.

2012 Agreement Calculation between ELISA and LC-MS/MS

Microcystins samples tested by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS in 2012 are sorted on the base of matrix type into two groups; WS and WD. These two groups are discussed individually and then summarized collectively in one table for the agreement calculation of whole year (2012). The details of the agreement calculations are as follow: 3.4.1 2012 Surface Water (WS) Results ­ Agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS The surface water samples tested in 2012 are organized in Table 27 to 29 and A5 according to the agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS values.

The first category includes the samples with values (counter#1 to #20) lower than the WHO threshold by both methods. Hence they pose no health or environmental threat. The positive ELISA values in these samples (counter #1 to #20) ranged from 0.2 to 0.85µg/L while LCMS/MS were negative. Similar phenomena have been observed in previous data from 2010 and 2011.

The second category consists of four samples (counter #21 to #24) where values are above the WHO guideline (1.0µg/L) by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS. In three samples (counter #22, #23, #24) two to three variants have identical values by LC-MS/MS. Also, the MDL had been raised to 1.6 to 2.4-folds in order to compensate for matrix interferences. Therefore, the test results in these three counters are not reliable. The fourth sample (counter #21) of this category is 66

CHAPTER THREE negative by LC-MS/MS and value by ELISA is above the WHO threshold. Since the values of all four samples (#21 to #24) are above the WHO threshold, they could be toxic.

3.4.1.2 ELISA Negative and LC-MS/MS Positive Samples Surface water samples that were tested negative by ELISA and positive by LC-MS/MS in 2012 are sorted in Table 28.

The values in the counter #1 to #15 are positive by LC-MS/MS and non-detect by ELISA or close to the MDL (0.15µg/L). This Table (28) is a good example to illustrate the limitations and failure of a sophisticated method like LC-MS/MS to produce useful results. The values of fifteen out of sixteen samples had been manipulated to overcome the effect of matrix interference. In doing so, identical results had been arbitrarily produced regardless of "true" variant concentrations which are not measureable in these cases. Hence LC-MS/MS cannot be relied upon as a method for precise results to detect microcystins in many cases of surface water. In contrast, ELISA technique is not affected by matrix interference and is therefore the method of choice for microcystins analysis.

CHAPTER THREE The sample in counter #16 is negative for microcystins by both methods. However, this sample is positive for antoxin-a (1.0µg/L).

3.4.1.3 Samples Positive by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS The data in Table 29 was sorted into four groups. The first group includes the samples (counter #1 to #21) with an agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS. This group represent samples where ELISA values are always higher than LC-MS/MS. However, both methods produced the same toxicity evaluation with respect to the threshold values of drinking water guidelines. The second group consists of ten samples (counter #22 to #31) with values above the WHO threshold (1.0µg/L) by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS.

The first and second group (ELISA values higher than LC-MS/MS) will be analysed by PPIA for toxicity assessment.

The third group comprises of six samples (counter #32 to #37) where the values by both methods are in agreement. However, LC-MS/MS values are insignificantly (0.60- to 0.83-folds) higher than ELISA. The identical values for different variants of microcystins by LC-MS/MS in counter #33, # 34 and #37 represent high matrix interference, hence untrustworthy results.

The fourth group contains two samples (counter #38, #39) with values above the SDWA threshold (1.5µg/L) by LC-MS/MS and below by ELISA. These samples could be a potential threat to health or environment but identical values of different variants of microcystins by LCMS/MS make the results of these counters unreliable.

3.4.2 2012 WS Agreement Calculation Table 30 summarizes the 134 surface water samples tested in 2012. The agreement (Table 29+Table 30) of 70% comprised of (55+39) 94 samples. Twelve samples among 94 have some discrepancy between ELISA and LC-MS/MS values. Ten samples (counter #22 to #31 in Table 29) have values above WHO threshold by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS. Two samples are with values above WHO limit by LC-MS/MS and below by ELISA but at the same times these two samples shows unreliable LC-MS/MS results due to high matrix interference. Hence these two samples cannot be considered as LC-MS/MS positive samples.

The disagreement (Table 27+Table 28) of 30% includes (16+24) 40 samples. The values of twenty one samples are below the WHO threshold by both methods. Eighteen samples have unreliable results due to high matrix interference. There is one sample which is truly in disagreement with (Counter #21-Table 27) a value above WHO threshold by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS. 3.4.3 2012 Drinking Water (WD) Results ­ Agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS The drinking water samples tested in 2012 are organized in Table 34 to 52 according to the agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS values.

3.4.3.1 ELISA Positive and LC-MS/MS Negative Samples Table 31 represents drinking water samples positive by ELISA and negative by LC-MS/MS form year 2012. ELISA values are higher than LC-MS/MS in counter #1 to #50 but are below WHO threshold by both methods, thus no potential health threat. Values in counter #51 to #61 are above WHO threshold by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS. These samples could be toxic and if available, they will be investigated further for toxicity with PPIA.

CHAPTER THREE ELISA values in counter #1 to #5 are not truly non-detect; instead the low values are rounded up to 0.15µg/L which is the MDL of ELISA. The value of 0.15 means the ELISA value lies between 0.05µg/L to 0.15µg/L. By this rationale, there are no substantial differences between the values by both methods. The only sample with real disagreement is counter #6 where ELISA value is non-detect but it is positive by LC-MS/MS. However, the values of microcystins in counter #1 to #6 by both methods are below SDWA threshold (1.5µg/L). Hence these six samples pose no health threat.

3.4.3.3 Samples Positive by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS Drinking water samples in Table 33 were tested positive by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS in 2012. Three groups are evident from table 36. The first group includes 19 samples (counter #1 to #19) where values by both methods are in good agreement. Second group consist of one sample (counter #20) with value equal to WHO threshold by LC-MS/MS and approximately so by ELISA. The difference in values between both methods is only 0.1µg/L which is negligible.

The third group consists of 19 samples (counter #21 to #39) with values equal or above WHO threshold by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS. The samples from this group if available will be analysed by PPIA for toxicity.

CHAPTER THREE Total 854 water samples tested by ELISA and LC-MS/MS from 2010 to 2012 at MOE. The agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS is 76% and composed of 652 (202+450) samples while the disagreement of 24% consists of 202 (85+117) samples.

The purpose of agreement calculation was to analyse the differences between ELISA and LCMS/MS values. The agreement calculation is based on MDL (ELISA 0.15µg/L, LC-MS/MS 0.05µg/L) and not the WHO (1.0µg/L) and SDWA (1.5µg/L) guidelines. Although some samples from agreement group were positive by both methods (based on MDL), at the same time they were safe by one method and toxic (values above WHO or SDWA threshold) by the other. Within the disagreement group, some samples were safe or toxic (values higher or lower than WHO or SDWA) by both methods even they were in disagreement.

Values of 757 (89%) samples among 854 from agreement and disagreement groups collectively were below the threshold of WHO (1.0µg/L) and SDWA (1.5µg/L) by both methods. Hence these samples pose no threat to health and environment.

The rest of the 97 (11%) samples had discrepancy between ELISA and LC-MS/MS test results: 72 samples had values above WHO threshold by ELISA and below by LC-MS/MS and 23 samples had values below WHO threshold by ELISA and above by LMCS.

Out of these 72 (8%) samples, 13 (2%) will be discounted from our final discussion because the results by LC-MS/MS for theses samples are not reliable. The rest of the 59(6%) samples from this group can be toxic and will be considered for the PPIA for further investigation.

Regarding the aforementioned 23 (3%) samples, 19 (2%) will be disregarded due to their unreliable LC-MS/MS results. In total, 4 (0.47%) samples had values above SDWA threshold (1.0µg/L) by LC-MS/MS and below by ELISA. These 4 samples with reliable LC-MS/MS results can be a threat to wildlife and environment. The values of 2 samples were above the 0.02µg/L for antitoxins by LC-MS/MS and below by ELISA.

Discussion

Microcystins data from 2010 to 2012 indicates that 22% (186) of samples exhibited ELISA values higher than LC-MS/MS but still below WHO guidelines, while in 8% (59) of the cases, values of ELISA were above the WHO guidelines but below by LC-MS/MS. Thus, in a significant portion of 30% cases, ELISA values were higher than LC-MS/MS, which supports the hypothesis of this research that ELISA detects total microcystins.

Only 4 cases of LC-MS/MS positives out of 853, ELISA failed to detect microcystins; 3 from 2010 and 1 from 2011 but this pattern did not exist in 2012. Perhaps over a period of time, the manufacturer has improved the quality of their ELISA kit, or perhaps the ELISA operators have improved proficiency and performance. Perhaps both are true. In any case, the latest performance data in 2012 show that ELISA did not miss any true positive sample. The summary of discrepant results between ELISA and LC-MS/MS is available in Fig.16.

The analysis of microcystins data also reveals that 59 (41WD+18WS) (7%) results were above the WHO threshold (1µg/L) by ELISA but these samples were negative by LC-MS/MS. Clearly

CHAPTER THREE relying on LC-MS/MS results can put public health, wild animals and environment in danger. To avoid the toxic exposure of microcystins, all water samples (WS or WD) should be analysed with ELISA first. These results are also a push towards the change of O. Reg. 169/03 from only -LR to total microcystins.

Matrix interference has considerable impact on the LC-MS/MS results (Table C1 and C2AppendixC). LC-MS/MS in 90 samples (11%) out of 854 (microcystins test results of samples from 2010 to 2012) have failed to produce reliable results. Matrix interference effect is more evident in surface water samples {75 (9%)} as compared to drinking water {15 samples (2%)}. LC-MS/MS cannot claim that any of these results are correct due to the lack of availability of matrix reference material. The long tedious 3 to 4 days of sample preparation could not help LCMS/MS to produce the reliable results. On the contrary, ELISA produced consistent results without any matrix interference within a day.

Microcystins were being analysed by LC-MS/MS from 2002 to 2009 at MOE in surface and drinking water samples (raw and treated water). From 2010, after the introduction of ELISA technique, treated and raw water samples are being screened by ELISA and positive samples by ELISA are confirmed by LC-MS/MS while surface water are analysed by LC-MS/MS only. A summary of agreement calculation for each matrix type(WS & WD) and for each year is available in Fig.17

The data analysis from 2010 to 2012 demonstrates that when it comes to the surface water samples, LC-MS/MS cannot be relied upon as a technique of choice due to high effects of matrix interferences whereas ELISA results were reliable (Carmichael & An, 1999; Zeck et al., 2001; Metcalf et al., 2001; Fischer et al., 2001; Sheng et al., 2006) Hence, it is suggested that ELISA should be used for the analysis of microcystins in all samples including drinking water and especially surface water samples because this method is the fit-for­purpose (method is suitable for the intended purpose) (Carmichael & An, 1999; Pírez, Macarena et al., 2013; Sangolkar et al., 2006). Perhaps, the samples should be only tested by LC-MS/MS when a concentration of certain variant of microcystins is required.

Table 38 represents all samples (WS and WD) tested positive by either ELISA or LC-MS/MS or by both. The values of anatoxin-a in 7 samples are (counter #1 to #7) in agreement for anatoxin-a between ELISA and LC-MS/MS.

Values in 3 counters #8 to #9 for anatoxin-a were non-detect by ELISA and positive by LC-MS/MS. However, values of anatoxin-a in counter #8 and #9 are well below the WHO threshold. Hence, they pose no health effect. Whereas, 1 sample (counter#9) is truly positive with the value of anatoxin-a is higher than SDWA and it is non-detect by ELISA. This sample poses a health threat.

All ELISA tests at Ministry of the Environment (MOE) are performed by using Abraxis kit. The antibodies in this kit are only specific against ADDA moiety of microcystins structure not against 84

CHAPTER THREE anatoxin-a. Hence, if only ELISA (Abraxis kit) is used for the detection of anatoxin-a in the future, there are very good chances that ELISA can miss the anatoxin-a. But to solve this problem, Abraxis (manufacturer) recently (April 2013) developed an anatoxin-a kit based receptor binding (Van Apeldoorn et al., 2007). The principle and method in detail is available online at http://goo.gl/Bu1t7A.

Cost Comparison and Workload Contribution between ELISA and LCMS/MS

ELISA and LC-MS/MS results were collected from Laboratory Services Branch of MOE. Workload division and cost comparison calculation between ELISA and LC-MS/MS was performed from 2010 to 2012. This chapter will analyse the workload and the cost effectiveness of ELISA versus LCMS/MS for the analysis of microcystins at MOE. The details are as follow:

4.1

Material and Method

Data received from MOE data base for the analysis of microcystins from 2010 to 212 was sorted on the basis of detection method. Data was sorted and categorized into three groups; (1) samples tested by ELISA only, (2) samples tested by LC-MS/MS only and (3) samples tested by both. The details of sorted data are available in Appendix E (Table E1 to Table E18). 4.1.1 Workload Calculation

Data was further sorted on the basis of matrix type for each year. The workload calculations were performed in two different ways. Firstly, workload was calculated on the yearly basis (Table D1 to D9 in Appendix D) and also collectively compiled for three years (2010 to 2012) in Table D10. Secondly, the data was also sorted on the basis of individual matrix type (WS or WD) over the period of three years (2010 to 2012) (Table 42, Table 43). The workload calculation was performed by using the following table:

CHAPTER FOUR 4.1.2 Cost Comparison

Cost of LC-MS/MS and ELISA were estimated based on operations at the Laboratory Services Branch (LaSB) of MOE.

The LC-MS/MS method required multiple equipment for sample preparation and analysis e.g. lyophilizer, bottle rotators, centrifuge, membrane filtration apparatus and LC-MS/MS system. The estimated cost for LC-MS/MS equipment is $300,000 assuming a 10-years life time. Thus, the average cost is $30,000 per year. The reagents and maintenance of $10,000 per year was added to the equipment cost ($30,000+$10,000=$40,000). Microcystins analysis by LC-MS/MS is performed by four employees at LaSB lab including two senior scientists, 1 full time technician and one full time co-op student. However, two scientists also perform other analysis too. Hence, salaries of two scientists were assumed equal to one full time junior scientist salary. The total salaries are approximately $200,000 for one year. Therefore, the estimated cost for LC-MS/MS analysis is about $240,000 per year. An average cost of $365 per sample is calculated based on the cost per year divided by the average number of samples per year (657).

Estimated cost of ELISA equipment is $30,000 assuming a 10-years life span. Average cost per year would be $3,000. One kit suffices the analysis of 36 samples and the cost per kit is $320. ELISA cost to analyse 657 samples per year is 36x657=18kits=18x$320=$5,760. ELISA consumables such as pipette tips and plastic vials are approximately $500 per year; $5,760+$500=$6,260. Therefore, the material cost alone is $6,260/657=$9.50 per sample. Annual salary of one fulltime employee is approximately $80,000 to perform the ELISA. Thus, the total estimated cost per year is $6,260+$80,000=$89,260. An average cost of $136 per sample by ELISA is arrived at by dividing the total cost per year by the number of samples tested per year (657).

The cost calculations are rough approximations. These calculations exclude amortization, building, hydro and overhead. Cost of $300,000 for LC-MS/MS and $30,000 for ELISA were already budgeted as capital expenditure and was paid in cash to avoid any interest. The useful life of equipment was determined to be 10 years and straight line depreciation method was used to come up with the yearly cost. The details are tabulated in Table 40.

Results and Discussions

Ontario Regulation O. Reg. 248/03 was amended in 2010 to allow the use of ELISA for water (WD) testing (MOE, 2010a). Over a period of three years (2010 to 2012) total 1970 test results of surface water and drinking water were generated by a combination of ELISA and LC-MS/MS methods (Table 41).

Among these 1970 samples, 1538 were drinking water (raw and treated) samples. ELISA shared 63% of the workload for drinking water samples from 2010 to 2012. Clearly, clients prefer ELISA over LC-MS/MS by a majority. This preference is illustrated in Table 42.

As mentioned earlier, the regulation was amended only for the screening of drinking water. Most of raw water and surface water samples are still being analysed by LC-CMS/MS at MOE. Hence, ELISA contribution is not evident in the surface water samples as it is in drinking water samples. ELISA shared a workload of 25% (Table 43) of surface water samples and 63% (Table 42) of drinking water samples for the detection of microcystins from 2010 to 2012.

Collectively (WS and WD), ELISA shared a workload of 54% from 2010 to 2012 as represented in Table D10 (Appendix D) and saved huge amount of money and time. Graphical presentation of workload contribution of ELISA and LC-MS/MS from 2010 to 2012 for each matrix type is presented in Fig. F1 to F7 (Appendix F) and Fig.18.

CHAPTER FOUR 4.3 Summary

The approximate cost of analysing microcystins per samples by LC-MS/MS is 2.7 times higher than ELISA. The cost per year for 657 (average number of samples per year at MOE) samples will be $89,260 if water samples are tested by only ELISA and $240,000 if they are tested by only LCMS/MS. This is approximately a saving of $150,740 per year. By this rationale, ELISA would have saved $452,220 over the period of three years (2010 to 2012).

Further reduction in the LC-MS/MS work load could be achieved in the future by substituting the testing of both type of water samples (WD & WS) by ELISA and also educating the clients regarding the fitness of ELISA for the client's purpose.

Experimentation

This research is comprised of two types of experiments ­ ELISA and PP2A. First, ELISA was performed on the water samples to determine the concentration of total microcystins. Later on, PP2A will be performed on selected samples for toxicity analysis. The results obtained from PP2A and ELISA will be sorted on the matrix (WS, WD) type. A correlation between ELISA and PP2A results will be plotted for each matrix (WS & WD). The sample preparation and the details of these both methods are as follow:

5.1

Sample Source and Preparation

The surface and drinking water samples from 2010 to 2012 were collected through the LaSB of MOE under the "Drinking water surveillance program" (DWSP) and MOE "Field Operation Division" for the routine analysis of total microcystins. The samples were stored at -20ºC at Laboratory Services Branch, Etobicoke.

The samples selected for study were positive either by LC-MS/MS method or ELISA, or they were positive by both. These samples were frozen and thawed twice to perform the ELISA and PP2A. In total, 31 surface water samples (Table 44) and 44 drinking water samples were selected (Table 46).

To analyse exotoxin and endotoxin components of heptapeptide microcystin, some kind of cell disruption method is required. Hence, samples were freeze thaw twice (Rapala et al. 2002) to lyse the cell and release intracellular microcystins prior to PPIA and ELISA.

5.2

ELISA

"Microcystins-ADDA ELISA (Microtiter Plate)" Product No. 520011 manufactured by Abraxis was employed to detect total microcystins in the selected samples. This ELISA kit is based on the principle of indirect competitive ELISA. Microcystins and nodularins in water samples can be detected by this quantitative, sensitive, and variant-independent assay. The detection limit of this ELISA is 0.10g/L (ppb).

92

CHAPTER FIVE 5.2.1 Material

This Abraxis kit includes: one microtiter plate (12 X 8 strips) coated with an analog of microcystins conjugated to a protein, one control (0.75 ± 0.185 ppb), eight standards of microcystin-LR at various concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 µg/L), one sample diluent, one antibody solution, one anti-sheep-HRP (horse radish peroxidase) conjugate solution, one wash Solution (5X), one substrate (color) solution (TMB) and one stop solution. Additional materials not supplied by manufacturer, includes one micro-pipettes with disposable plastic tips (20-200L), one multi-channel pipette (50-300L), deionized or distilled water, paper towel, timer, parafilm and microtiter plate reader (wavelength 450 nm).

5.2.2

Principle of ELISA

The test is based on indirect competitive ELISA (Fig.19).. Microcystins/nodularins, if present in the sample, are allowed to bind to anti-microcystins/nodularins antibodies so that the binding sites on the antibodies become preoccupied. After that, the mixture is added to a microtiter plate, which has been coated with a microcystins-protein analogue. This protein analogue is presumed to be biotinylated microcystin-LR. f

This assumption is based on the popular protein immobilization technology of using biotin to derivatize the target protein (microcystins) followed by capturing the derivatized proteins by 93

CHAPTER FIVE avidin/streptavidin. Avidin/streptavidin is previously immobilized on the plate. Avidin/streptavidin binds strongly to polystyrene microtiter plate. Biotin and avidin/streptavidin constitute a strong, covalent binding pair thereby immobilizing the biotinylated protein. Furthermore the streptavidin arm ensures the derivatized proteins are displayed and accessible to the antibodies. Anti-microcystins antibodies with binding sites not yet occupied can now bind to the protein analogue immobilized on the coated plate. A secondary antibody conjugate (Anti-sheep IgG-HRP) is added. Finally, addition of a chromogenic substrate solution produces a color reaction. The intensity of the color is inversely proportional to the concentration of microcystins present in the sample i.e. darker color indicates lower microcystins concentration; lighter color indicates higher.

5.2.3

Method

Abraxis ELISA ADDA kit is routinely used at MOE for the detection of total microcystins. The MOE method code is MCYST-3469. The same product (kit) from the manufacturer was used from 2010 to the present time, and is also used in this research.

Detailed description of the method can be found in the Appendix G and is also available online at http://www.abraxiskits.com/uploads/products/docfiles/279_Microcystins%20ADDA%20ES.pdf The indirect competitive ELISA was performed as per manufacturer instruction (Fig.20). Briefly, 125µl of the standard solutions, control or samples were dispensed into designated wells of a blank plate in duplicates or triplicates. Prior to the experiment, the well positions of each sample or standard were assigned in a plate map by designed. Equal volume of 125µL of antibody solution was added to the wells and the plate was incubated for 30 minutes. Note: all incubations of the plates were at room temperature on a shaker with a lid covering the plate. After incubation, 100µl of solution from each well of the blank plates was transferred to the microcystins analogue-coated plate and incubated for 90 minutes. The plate was washed three times with 1X washing buffer. After washing, 100µL of enzyme conjugate solution was added to the wells and the plate was incubated for 30 minutes. The plate was washed again three times with 1X washing buffer. Substrate solution (100µL) was added and the plate was incubated for 30 minutes. Finally, 50µL of stop solution was added and the absorbance was measured in a plate reader (SPECTRAmaxPlus384) at 450nm.

CHAPTER FIVE A calibration curve is constructed after capturing the absorbance by using commercial software (SoftMaxPro). The program allows plate map design. The operator exports the absorbance values in text format, which is imported to excel work sheet. After recording the measured absorbance, or optical density (OD), of each well, the average OD of each set of calibrators or samples is calculated. Then using the average OD, percentage of Baseline zero (%B0) is calculated. %B0 is the parameter which indicates the amount of microcystins in each well, relative to the negative control (NC) wells. The following formula is used to calculate the %B0

% B0 

(average OD of calibrator or sample) * (100) average OD of Negative Control

The Baseline zero (%B0) (y-axis) is graphed versus microcystin concentration (x-axis) using a semilog plot. The "solver" function in MS excel is used to calculate the s quares of differences between actual and calculated curves used by Solver function. Solver function also minimize the "sum of squares of the differences" between Ypred (normalized ELISA response= OD as %of negative control OD) and Y. If the difference is more than 31 the experiment run is rejected (Figure 21).

CHAPTER FIVE 5.3 PP2A

Protein phosphatase inhibition assay (PPIA) is based on the measurement of protein phosphates enzyme inhibition activity by microcystins. There are many types of protein phosphates such as Type PP1, PP2, PP4, PP5, PP6 and PP7. PP2 have two subtypes called PP2A and PP2B. Two of these enzymes commonly used in PPIA are PP1 and PP2A. The enzyme used in this kit {Microcystins/Nodularins PP2A-Product No. 520032 by Abraxis (manufacturer)} is protein phosphates subtype 2A. Hence, the assay was named by the manufacturer as PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A). The term "PP2A" will be used instead of PPIA henceforth. The MDL of PP2A (Abraxis) is 1.0µg/L.

5.3.1

PP2A Principle

Inhibition activity of phosphatase enzyme 2A (PP2A) by microcystins/nodularins is measured (Fig.22). Sample is incubated with protein phosphatase enzymes (PP2) at 37ºC.

FIGURE 22. PRINCIPLE OF PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE INHIBITION ASSAY

Microcystin, if present in the sample, binds to protein phosphatase enzyme. A substrate is added which is hydrolysed by PP2 enzyme and produces a color. The absorbance of the color is measured at 405nm with a plate reader. Inhibition activity of the PP2A enzyme is proportional to the amount of microcystins present in the sample. The concentration of the toxin in the sample can be calculated using a standard curve.

CHAPTER FIVE 5.3.2 Material

Materials provided in the kit includes: one 96-well microtiter plate (Fig.23), four vials of phosphatase, four standards of microcystin-LR at various concentrations 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.50 µg/L, one vial of chromogenic Substrate, one vial of Phosphatase Dilution Buffer and one vial of Stop Solution. Additional materials required for the experiment but not included in the kit were Micro-pipettes with disposable plastic tips (10-200 and 200-1000L), Multi-channel pipette (50-250L), Microtiter Plate Reader (wave length 405 nm), Timer, Parafilm, Distilled or Deionized water, Vortex Mixer and incubator at 37 +/- 2 °C.

Briefly, 50µL of each microcystins standard or sample were dispensed into designated wells of a microtiter plate in duplicates. Phosphatase solution (70µL) was added to the each well followed by addition of 90µL of chromogenic substrate. The solution was gently mixed on a shaker for 30 seconds. Adhesive film was applied and plate was incubated for 50 min at 36ºC. Finally, after adding a stop solution absorbance of samples and standards were measured at 405nm in a plate reader (SPECTRAmaxPlus384). Flow diagram of PP2A procedure is summarized in Fig.24.

Results of ELISA and PP2A

The ELISA procedure is already established and used in routine at MOE. The newly available PP2A was performed first time. Initial results indicated there is room for improvement. Therefore, assay optimization experiments were performed as follow.

5.4.1

Protein Phosphatase Inhibition Assay Optimization

PP2A was optimized by investigating various incubation times at 36oC. The results are shown in the Fig.26, which is a plot of absorbance (of para-nitro-phenol phosphate) versus concentration (of microcystin-LR). The manufacturer's recommended 30min incubation produced a shallow curve which makes the assay not very sensitive (red line). Optimal incubation period of 55 minutes was chosen because the slope (green line) is most distinct. Furthermore, absorbance higher than 2.5 OD units is generally less accurate due to the limitation of the spectrophotometer optical systems. Our optimized method dramatically improved the signal-to-noise differential resulting in more accurate quantitation. The differential at 55min is 2.29 OD units while the differential at 30min is only 1.38 OD units.

Assays Performed on Water Samples

ELISA and PP2A were performed in parallel on selected samples from 2010 to 2012 (Table 44, 46). Samples were freeze thaw twice before testing.

101

CHAPTER FIVE Reproducibility of microcystins ELISA results was examined by comparing results from these runs to the historic results recorded in MOE data base {laboratory information management system (LIMS)}. After 1-2 years of storage at -16ºC, reproducibility is such that surface water samples exhibited an average of 57% (Table 44) of its historic value while drinking water was 54% (Table 46).

In these parallel runs, the average ELISA results were 16 times higher than PP2A for the surface water samples (Fig.28).

5.4.2.1 Surface Water Results Microcystins were analysed by PP2A and ELISA in 31 selected surface water samples. Samples in counter #1 to #8 were ideal to test the hypothesis of this research. These samples were negative by LC-MS/MS and positive by ELISA in LIMS. PP2A was performed to adjudicate the discrepancy between LC-MS/MS and ELISA results. Samples were frozen from a long period of time; hence ELISA was performed on the same samples once again to find the present (2013) concentration of microcystins in case samples integrity after storage is in question. Comparing the results between ELISA-LIMS and ELISA-2013 there was a 50 to 60% drop in microcystins after 1-2 years of storage (Table 44).

PP2A results were compared with ELISA-2013 and LC-MS/MS-LIMS. PP2A results support ELISA2013 even after lower recovery of microcystins due to storage. All these eight samples negative by LC-MS/MS and positive by ELISA were also positive by PP2A. Therefore, the PP2A results validated the hypothesis of this research that ELISA detects numerous variants of microcystins, hence produces more true positive results than LC-MS/MS.

There were not enough ideal (LC-MS/MS negative, ELISA positive) samples to test the hypothesis, hence, few more samples were included in the research (counter #9 to #31). Twenty six samples (counter #1 to #26) out of these 31 were previously analysed by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS. Hence, results were available in the LIMS. However, 5 samples in counter #27 to #31 were only analysed by ELISA, therefore no results by LC-MS/MS in LIMS. The percentage calculation in the following paragraphs will exclude the last 5 samples (counter #27 to #31). However, scattered plot performed between ELISA and PP2A includes all samples from Table 44 (n=31). 102

CHAPTER FIVE

Results from Table 43 can be divided into four categories. The first category (Counter #1 to #16) describes samples where LC-MS/MS results were either negative or less than the ELISA values in LIMS. Results from ELISA-2013 analysis for the same samples exhibited a lower recovery of microcystins as compare to ELISA-LIMS. Nevertheless, PP2A results are close to ELISA-2013 results. Hence, PP2A results in this category support the ELISA-2013 results.

The second category (Counter #17 to #18) describes a scenario where LC-MS/MS results from LIMS were higher than ELISA. However, ELISA-2013 results are higher than LC-MS/MS. PP2A results support these ELISA-2013 values. Therefore, there is no difference between first and second category.

The third category includes the samples (counter #19 to #21) with LC-MS/MS results lower than ELISA in LIMS. Results by PP2A are significantly higher than ELISA-2013. Perhaps, PP2A inhibitors other than microcystins are present. Especially in the case of counter #21, PP2A results are very much higher than ELISA.

The fourth category comprised of samples where LC-MS/MS results are lower than ELISA in LIMS. PP2A results are very much lower than ELIS-2013. Probably, antibodies in ELISA are identifying the free non-toxic ADDA moiety of microcystins in the samples, hence producing significantly higher results than PP2A.

A linear regression plot was performed between PP2A and ELISA-2013 results to further analyse the correlation between them (Figure. 28). PP2A results were plotted in x-axis and ELISA in y-axis. Four samples (counter #11, #21 #23 #30) in Table 44 had exceptionally high values by both methods.

Although the values between ELISA-2013 and PP2A were in reasonable agreement, these four high values were increasing the weight of the correlation in the scatter plot up to R 2=0.8735 and slope=0.8577(n=31). These four values were outliers and removed from the scatter plot, a strong 104

Fig.28 plots the data in a perfect square with line of idealism at 45º angle. The scatter data points falls more to the left side of the line of idealism, indicating the ELISA values are higher than the corresponding PP2A values. This means ELISA is more sensitive than PP2A.

The surface water results of PP2A presented above were very encouraging for the purpose of measuring the toxicity of microcystins. However, PP2A was found to be unsuitable for colored surface water samples e.g. surface sample # C203886-0001 (Table 46) has very high value of PP2A than ELISA-2013. The assay measures the absorbance of the color. Therefore, the color of a sample

A scattered plot between ELISA-2013 and PP2A (Fig.30) was performed. Six values from ELISA2013 and four values from PP2A results were found to be outliers. Hence, six samples (36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44) were excluded from analysis. Scattered plot shows an insignificant correlation between ELISA-2013 and PP2A (n=38, R2=0.0366, slope=0.1199, p=0.0665).

CHAPTER FIVE Fig.30 plots the data in a perfect square with a line of idealism at a 45º angle. Most of the scatters data points fall to the right side of the line of idealism, indicating that PP2A values are very much higher than the corresponding ELISA values.

Experiments were designed to investigate this lack of correlation and the source of error for the higher PP2A results. PP2A will be positive whenever the PP2 enzyme is inhibited. A significant correlation observed for surface water versus the lack of correlation in drinking water indicates a matrix effect. As per manufacturer, any oxidizing agent or Na2S2O3 could be inhibitory. All drinking water sample collected for microcystins analysis at MOE have chlorine at various concentrations. These water samples are also analysed for analytes other than microcystins. To preserve the analytes from oxidation, the chlorine is neutralized by Na2S2O3. Approximately 30 drops of Na2S2O3 at stock concentration of 25% (W/V) is added to one liter of water sample so that the final concentration is 0.0375% (W/V).

To confirm whether chlorine or Na2S2O3 is inhibiting the protein phosphatase enzyme activity, experiment was performed using deionized distilled water (DDW), distilled water (DW), tap water and tap water with 0.001% of Na2S2O3 (25%W/V). Na2S2O3 was used to neutralize the chlorine. The results clearly indicated that tap water supresses the enzyme activity from 2.5 OD units (DDW and DW) down to approximately 1.6 OD units (Fig.31). This implies chlorinated water inhibited the protein phosphates enzyme to some extent. If this were true, neutralizing the chlorine with sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3) should return the enzyme activity to normal. This was not the case in Fig.31. The inhibitory effect of Na2S2O3 was more prominent than chlorine in DDW.

CHAPTER FIVE Hence, one clear conclusion can be made that in presence of Na2S2O3 in any concentration in water will inhibit the protein phosphatase enzyme (Fig.34). Hence, PP2A results for drinking water results cannot be relied upon.

However, in case of three samples (counter #42 to #44) in Table 47, PP2A was able to detect accurately microcystins. These four samples were quality control samples. Probably samples does not contain any chlorine and sodium thiosulphate, hence PP2A produced results which are comparable with ELISA-2013. .

5.4.3

Summary

The significant findings on studying PP2A and ELISA in parallel are as follows. PP2A was found to have an MDL range from of 0.25µg/L to 2.5µg/L. Negative samples by LCMS/MS and positive by ELISA were found to be positive by PP2A too. PP2A results support ELISA results. Hence, the hypothesis that ELISA produces more true positive results than LC-MS/MS because it can detect more variants than LC-MS/MS was found to be true. An acceptable correlation was found between PP2A and ELISA results based on the high R2 (0.8155) value in surface water samples. PP2A was found to be a reliable method for the detection of microcystins and can be considered as a tier-2 test. However, PP2A is confounded when the surface water samples is colored, especially yellow to brown color. In such cases PP2A results will be unreliable.

The results of PP2A were erroneously higher than ELISA in drinking water samples due to chlorine inhibition of PP2 enzyme. Neutralization of chlorine with sodium thiosulfate did not solve the problem because neutralizer itself is inhibitory to the enzyme.

Hence, it can be concluded that ELISA does not produce false positive results. PP2A is a good probe for none colored surface water but ineffective for the detection of microcystins in treated drinking water samples.

Discussion

Increased eutrophication of water bodies has elevated the health risks associated with cyanobacteria worldwide. This situation increases the demand to find faster, reliable and economical methods for monitoring microcystins. From 2010 to 2012, the average number of samples collected per year is 657 at MOE. The total cost per sample by ELISA is $136 and $365 by LC-MS/MS. If all the samples would have been analysed by ELISA, the cost per year would be $89,260 versus $240,000 by LCMS/MS alone. The kit cost per sample for PPIA is $16 and $10 for ELISA. If ELISA is used as a tier1 test followed by PPIA as a tier-2 test, PPIA would theoretically cost $16 x 657 = $13,664. In practice, the tier-2 test would need to be run every week, requiring 36 strip wells of a microtiter plate. Over the 26 weeks of warm season, the number of strips required would be 26 x 36 wells = 936 wells = 117 strips (8-wells per strips) = 117/12 kits (12 strips per kit) = 9 kits = $5,400 per year. Hence, the 2-tier test system would cost $5,400+$89,260=$94,660 per year which is still 2.5 times less than LCMS/MS. More importantly, this 2-tier test system could potentially replace LC-MS/MS if the regulation is changed to monitor total microcystins and disregard microcystin-LR as the sole indicator. This would mean approximately annual savings of $145,340.

Other than economic impact, the major advantage of these bioassays over LC-MS/MS is their turnaround time. To monitor our water resources and to prevent the public from harmful impacts of microcystins in real time, a rapid method is desirable. PP2A can be performed within one and half hour, ELISA in three hours but LC-MS/MS usually needs one week.

In a day, 36 samples can be included in one PP2A run or one ELISA run. On the other hand LCMS/MS is limited to 20-26 samples per week. The workload capacity, cost and turnaround time of ELISA or PP2A is obviously advantageous. Therefore, ELISA and PP2A are the methods of choice for analysing microcystins in the water.

ELISA is already an established method for the detection of microcystins in drinking water samples (EPA USA, 2010b; Geis-Asteggiante Lucía et al., 2011; Pírez, Macarena et al., 2013). ELISA results as compare to HPLC were (on an average 2.5 times) higher in a study by Tillmans et al, (2007) and 7.4 times higher in a study by Conti et al, (2006). This study found ELISA was 2.5 times higher than LC-MS/MS from 2010 to 2012 in 30% (215) of samples out of 854 samples. In these three years, 113

CHAPTER SIX ELISA missed only 4 samples out of 854 samples (0.5%). Over the three years, ELISA consistently showed slightly higher results or more positive results compare to LC-MS/MS. This general trend was observed by numerous workers cited in Table 7, Group 1 and Group 2. The most logical explanation for this trend is that ELISA cross react with multiple variants of microcystins, some of which escaped LC-MS/MS detection. LC-MS/MS is limited to detect only 4 to 5 variants of microcystins, hence the reason for lower results. The one study in Group 3 is out of line with this general trend; this study was performed on food supplement pills and the reason for the lower ELISA results was probably due to poor or inadequate sample extraction from the pills. The present research on 854 samples over three years is the largest and most comprehensive sample size ever reported, based on which a more reliable trend of ELISA versus LC-MS/MS is deemed more credible.

PP2A detects the bioactive toxicity of microcystins (Carmichael & An., 1999). PP2A is sensitive to the toxic microcystins variants. However, the toxic potency differs among variants. Furthermore, the toxicity of the majority of variants is unknown. ELISA detects the total microcystins or structural component of microcystins. Part of this research was designed to evaluate which assay, PP2A or ELISA, will be the more suitable tier-1 assay. Surface water samples testing showed that ELISA results were 17% higher than PP2A. Since PP2A is less sensitive than ELISA, PP2A cannot serve as a tier-1 assay.

Chlorine was found to be inhibitory of protein phosphatase enzyme in treated drinking water samples. Most of the studies found calyculin A and okadaic acid are the inhibitor of protein phosphatase enzyme (Lin et al., 1994; Metcalf et al., 2000). No literature was found on chlorine inhibition of protein phosphatase enzyme. The reason is that these studies were conducted either on spiked samples or laboratory grown cyanobacteria or on surface water samples but not on drinking water samples. Since the aforementioned samples did not contain chlorine, it is not surprising that the inhibitory effect of chlorine on the protein phosphatase enzyme has not yet been reported in the literature.

LC-MS/MS could analyse only four variants (-LR, -RR, -LA, -YR) until 2102. Since 2013, the MOE laboratory has expanded its capability to identify eight more variants (microcystins -LY, -WR, -HtyR, -HilR, -LW, -LF, desmethylmicrocystins-LR, desmethylmicrocystins-RR) due to the recent availability of commercial standards. Agreement (chapter-3) and cost (chapter-4) calculation 114

CHAPTER SIX performed in this study includes the data from 2010 to 2012. In future studies, the agreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS could improve with the capability of measuring twelve variants rather than four. However, the advantage of measuring twelve variants for monitoring purposes remains obscure. In contrast, the advantages of ELISA are clear. Furthermore, measuring eight additional variants incurs higher cost for LC-MS/MS. Therefore, the argument that ELISA is more fit-for-purpose than LC-MS/MS remains valid irrespective of how many additional variants LC-MS/MS may able to detect.

Anatoxin-a is rarely found in the water samples examined. Over the period of three years, anatoxin-a was detectable by LC-MS/MS in only 19 samples (19/854 = 2.2%). Among these 19 samples, 9 were excluded due to their unreliable LC-MS/MS results caused by matrix interference. Among the remaining 10 samples (1.2%), only one sample (2.0µg/L) exceeded the proposed guideline of 1.0µg/L (Fawell et al., 1999). Surprisingly, no microcystins was detected by ELISA in this one sample. Unfortunately, this sample from 2010 was not saved for this research. Thus, the disagreement between ELISA and LC-MS/MS results could not be resolved by further testing. Since a receptor binding assay for anatoxin-a (Abraix) is now commercially available, the need for LC-MS/MS for monitoring this toxin is diminished.

For the first time anatoxin-a kit has become commercially available since April 2013. The timing did not allow for the study of this kit within the scope of this research. Nevertheless, investigation of this kit, which is a receptor binding assay, is highly recommended based on the following rationale. First, this kit might provide economical alternative to LC-MS/MS if and when anatoxin-a becomes regulated by SDWA. Second, this data base indicated that the rate of occurrence of anatoxin-a is rare (1.2%) over three years. Based on a very small sample size of n=10, no correlation was observed between the concentration of microcystins and anatoxin-a. It would appear that microcystins is not a good predictor of anatoxin-a. Hence, an assay specific to anatoxin-a would be appropriate.

Little is known about the effect of chlorination and boiling on the inactivation of anatoxin-a. Whether anatoxin-a should be regulated, is a complex question beyond the scope of this research.

Conclusion

The alarming increase in the frequency and magnitude of cyanobacterial bloom worldwide impose a demand for laboratory analytical methods to monitor the threat to environmental and public health (chapter 2). The traditional LC-MS/MS method is unable to meet this rising demand due to its cost, and cumbersome procedure. The first objective of this thesis is to find solutions to this analytical challenge. To accomplish this objective, a thorough comparison between ELISA and LC-MS/MS were undertaken from the point of view of cost effectiveness as well as reliability. This comparative study leads to the conclusion that ELISA supersedes LC-MS/MS in cost effectiveness, workload throughput, turn-around time, ease of operation, lack of matrix interference and reliability of results. Based on this conclusion it follows that ELISA, not LC-MS/MS should be the first line of defence against blue green algae bloom events. This hypothesis was proposed by the Ryerson research team to initiate the amendment of O. Reg. 248/03, which came into effect in December 2009. The amendment allowed municipal and private laboratory to contribute to the province wide monitoring of drinking water samples while circumventing the requirement for LC-MS/MS capabilities. This was a milestone in the advancement of environmental science and policy hand in hand. By reviewing and analysing a much a larger sample size from 2010 to 2012, this thesis allows the earlier hypothesis of Ryerson research team to mature into a sound theory that ELISA is the tier-1 method of choice based on the criteria of fit-for-purpose (chapter 3) and cost-efficiency (chapter 4). Since 2013, the MOE has increased the LC-MS/MS capability to measure twelve variants. However, the conclusion of this thesis remains unchanged because ELISA supports the SDWA requirement cost-effectively.

The second objective of this thesis is to find a suitable tier-2 test to complement ELISA (chapter 5). The motivation for this exercise was two-fold. Firstly, when ELISA and LC-MS/MS results disagree, a third test is required to adjudicate the discrepancy. Secondly, if this third test is fit-for-purpose, then it could potentially replace LC-MS/MS as a tier-2 test candidate. To achieve the second objective, PP2A was chosen, optimized and the assay attributes were characterized. Despite its limitations and shortcomings, PP2A was found to be a suitable tier-2 candidate over LC-MS/MS for surface water.

In summary, this thesis proposed a 2-tier test system: tier-1 ELISA and tier-2 PP2A for surface water samples only. The surface water samples are not regulated under SDWA. Hence, replacing of LCMS/MS with 2-tier test system would be easier than for drinking water samples. This work flow 116

CHAPTER SEVEN would be most cost effective and cost efficient. PP2A is not recommended for the detection of microcystins in drinking water due to matrix interference of chlorine and sodium thiosulphate. The question of anatoxin-a could be addressed by the newly available receptor binding bioassay as a potential replacement for LC-MS/MS.

The Ryerson team had a successful track record in influencing the amendment of O. Reg. 248/03 in 2009 to accommodate ELISA, to empower private and municipal sectors, and to revive the original spirit of the law. This study provides further momentum of technological advancement conducive to additional amendment of the regulations to better protect public and environment health from the threat of cyanobacteria toxins. To this end, the 2-tier test system proposed in this thesis creates a paradigm towards the amendment of O. Reg. 248/03 to accept PP2A which will propel the amendment of O. Reg. 169/03, specifically regarding the reversion of drinking water standards from 1.5µg/L of microcystin-LR back to 1.5µg/L total microcystins.

Recommendation

Future PP2A experiments are required with addition of different concentrations of chlorine to deionized distilled water to proof that chlorine is inhibitory to protein phosphatase enzyme. This experiment would determine conclusively whether PP2A has a place for testing drinking water samples.

On May 12, 2003, the Ontario Environmental Registry published a Policy Decision statement as cited below. Registry Number: PA 03E0001 Ministry Reference Number: 2003011501 Title: Proposal to Establish an Ontario Drinking Water Standard for Cyanobacterial Toxins (Microcystin LR) Policy Statement: The Ministry has adopted the Canadian Drinking Water Guideline (CDWG) for cyanobacterial toxins of 0.0015 mg microcystin per litre as an Ontario Drinking Water Standard (ODWS), as part of the Ontario Drinking-Water Quality Standards Regulation (O. Reg. 169/03) under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 2002. http://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEBExternal/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MTk3MTU=&statusId=MTk3MTU=&language=en

In view of the above, it is clear that the spirit of the law did not specify microcystin-LR or any specific variants but rather microcystins in total. For some reason, when translated into O. Reg. 169/03, the letter of the law became microcystin-LR. Perhaps the regulation was written based on science and technology available at the time, namely LC-MS/MS, which quantifies individual variants. Today, bioassays such as ELISA and PP2A are shedding new light in toxin detection and toxicity measurement. Bioassays have numerous advantages over LC-MS/MS including qualitative (screening test) and quantitative (concentration) detection, low cost, high throughput, fast turnaround time, and commercially available kits. In 2008, the Ryerson team has transferred the ELISA technology to private and municipal laboratories without LC-MS/MS capability to enable them to monitor microcystins in drinking water and surface water locally. Vision of the Ryerson team came to pass in 2009 when O. Reg. 248/03 was amended to empower ELISA to detect microcystins as first response to algal bloom events. This was the first milestone of revising the letter of the law back to 118

CHAPTER EIGHT the spirit of the law. Despite this preliminary success, the final goal is not reached yet due to two questions. First, when ELISA is positive and LC-MS/MS is negative, the possibility of a false positive ELISA result must be ruled out in order to avoid issuing drinking water advisory or beach closure prematurely. Second, surface waters are still analysed by the costly LC-MS/MS because they fall outside the drinking water regulation and because of the potential threat of anatoxin-a.

PP2A provides a pragmatic answer to the first question. When PP2A is positive on a water sample which exhibits ELISA positive and LC-MS/MS negative results, the probability of a false positive ELISA is low because the PP2A results indicate the sample is toxic. One could argue that the toxicity might be due to non-specific inhibitors, in which case one would have to assume the variants detected by the ELISA is non-toxic; a highly unlikely possibility. Therefore, PP2A addresses the first question adequately concerning surface water samples. With respect to drinking water samples, untreated raw water samples can be analysed by PP2A as well. The dilemma that chlorine treated drinking water cannot be analysed by PP2A is not as disconcerting as it seems. No significant level of microcystins was ever detected in treated drinking water ever since the monitoring of microcystins began in 2003. Hence, the failure of PP2A to test chlorinated water may be a non-issue in practice. If and when the issue arise, one can fall back on the LC-MS/MS method for support.

Changing the test from LC-MS/MS to PP2A would not only save tens of thousands of dollars but also empower private and municipal sectors to completely fulfill the spirit of the law without LC-MS/MS capability. The second part of the question is concerned with the potential threat of anatoxin-a. This study showed that the potential threat of anatoxin-a is remote (<2%). Furthermore, the commercial receptor binding assay kit might proof to be a suitable replacement for LC-MS/MS.

In summary, it is recommended that ELISA should be the tier-1 test and PP2A tier-2 test to replace the LC-MS/MS for all surface water samples matrices without exception. These recommendations are summarized in a flow chart (Fig.35).

Drinking water samples are regulated by SDWA. Under O. Reg. 248/03, ELISA is the tier-1 test and LC-MS/MS is the tier-2 test to confirm ELISA positive samples. PP2A cannot be used in drinking

119

CHAPTER EIGHT water samples due to matrix interference. Hence, the current strategy of ELISA as tier-1 and LCMS/MS as tier-2 is suitable.

Western blot is another method with the potential to adjudicate discrepant results between ELISA and LC-MS/MS. In a first step, the protein of interest (microcystin) is separated on the basis of their size from a mixture of protein. This separation is achieved by SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE). In the second step, separated proteins are transferred from the gel onto a nylon membrane by electrophoresis. Third step is blocking the unoccupied binding sites on the membrane. In fourth and fifth step, membrane is incubated with anti-microcystin primary antibodies followed by a second incubation with an appropriate anti-sheep IgG secondary antibody-enzyme conjugate respectively. Finally, the sixth step is the addition of substrate (TM ) which produces color bands on the membrane. These bands are identified according to their location on the membrane by comparing to molecular weight standards. Microcystins are very difficult to detect due to their smaller molecular 120

CHAPTER EIGHT weight (1 KD) by using western blot technique. So far no literature is available on a successful western blot for microcystins.

Recovery of microcystins was 50 to 60% after storage of samples from 1-2 years at -16ºC. Hence, to extend the shelf-life of samples, storage at -80ºC or below is recommended.

APPENDIX G APPENDIX G - ELISA PROCÉDURE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF MICROCYSTINS (ABRAXIS, PRODUCT NO. 520011) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Congener- Independent Determination of microcystins and nodularins in water samples. ` A. General Description The Abraxis microcystins-ADDA ELISA is an immunoassay for the quantitative and sensitive congener independent* detection of microcystins and nodularins in water samples. No additional sample preparation is required prior to analysis. If necessary, positive samples can be confirmed by HPLC, protein phosphatase assay, or other conventional methods.

B. Test Principle The test is an indirect competitive ELISA for the congener-independent detection of microcystins and nodularins. It is based on the recognition of microcystins, nodularins, and their congeners by specific antibodies. Toxin, when present in a sample and a microcystins-protein analogue immobilized on the plate competes for the binding sites of the antimicrocystins/Nodularins antibodies in solution. The plate is then washed and a second antibodyHRP label is added. After a second washing step and addition of the substrate solution, a color signal is generated. The intensity of the blue color is inversely proportional to the concentration of microcystins present in the sample. The color reaction is stopped after a specified time and the color is evaluated using an ELISA reader. The concentrations of the samples are determined by interpolation using the standard curve constructed with each run.

Materials 1. Microtiter plate (12 X 8 strips) coated with an analog of microcystins conjugated to a protein. 2. Standards (6) and Control (1): 0, 0.15, 0.40, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 ppb; Control at 0.75 ± 0.185 ppb 3. Sample Diluent (for dilution of samples above the range of the curve) 4. Antibody Solution 5. Anti-Sheep-HRP Conjugate Solution

Paper towels or equivalent absorbent material 13. Timer 14. Tape or parafilm 15. Microtiter plate reader (wavelength 450 nm) 16. Microtiter plate washer (optional)

C. Sample Collection and Handling Collect water samples in glass containers and test within 24 hours. If the samples must be held for longer periods (up to 5 days), it should be stored in refrigerator. For storage periods greater than 5 days, samples should be stored frozen. If total microcystins concentration (free and cell bound) is required, an appropriate cell lysing procedure (freeze and thaw, sonication, quick LyseTM, etc.) must be performed prior to analysis.

D. Working Scheme The microtiter plate consists of 12 strips of 8 wells, which can be used individually for the test. The standards must be run with each test.

APPENDIX G E. Assay Procedure 1. Add 125L of the standard solutions, control, or samples into the wells of the test strips of blank plate according to the working scheme given. Analysis in duplicate or triplicate is recommended. 2. Add 125L of the antibody solution to the individual wells of blank plate successively using a multi-channel pipette or a stepping pipette. Cover the wells with parafilm or tape and mix the contents by moving the strip holder in a circular motion on the bench top for 30 seconds. Incubate on a shaker for 30 minutes at room temperature. 3. Transfer 100L of each pre-incubated standard and control, or sample from blank plate to the appropriate wells of the microcystins coated microtiter plate. Incubate the microtiter plate for 90 minutes at room temperature on a shaker. 4. Remove the covering and decant the contents of the wells into a sink. Wash the strips three times using the 1X wash buffer solution. Use at least a volume of 250 µL of wash buffer for each well and each washing step. Remaining buffer in the wells should be removed by patting the plate dry on a stack of paper towels. 5. Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate solution to the individual wells successively using a multichannel pipette or a stepping pipette. Cover the wells with Para film or tape and mix the contents by moving the strip holder in a circular motion on the bench top for 30 seconds. Be careful not to spill the contents. Incubate the strips for 30 minutes at room temperature. 6. Remove the covering and decant the contents of the wells into a sink. Wash the strips three times using the 1X wash buffer solution. Please use at least a volume of 250 µL of wash buffer for each well and each washing step. Remaining buffer in the wells should be removed by patting the plate dry on a stack of paper towels. 7. Add 100 µL of substrate (color) solution to the individual wells successively using a multichannel pipette or a stepping pipette. Cover the wells with parafilm or tape and mix the contents by moving the strip holder in a circular motion on the benchtop for 30 seconds. Be careful not to spill the contents. Incubate the strips for 20-30 minutes at room temperature. Protect the strips from sunlight. 8. Add 50 µL of stop solution to the wells in the same sequence as for the substrate (color) solution using a multi-channel pipette or a stepping pipette. 180

APPENDIX G 9. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate ELISA photometer within 15 minutes after the addition of the stopping solution.

F. Evaluation The evaluation of the ELISA can be performed using commercial ELISA evaluation programs such as 4-Parameter (preferred) or Log it/Log. For a manual evaluation, calculate the mean absorbance value for each of the standards. Calculate the %B/B0 for each standard by dividing the mean absorbance value for each standard by the Zero Standard (Standard 0) mean absorbance. Construct a standard curve by plotting the %B/B0 for each standard on the vertical linear (y) axis versus the corresponding microcystins concentration on the horizontal logarithmic (x) axis on graph paper. %B/B0 for the control and samples will then yield levels in ppb of microcystins by interpolation using the standard curve.

Results can also be determined using a spreadsheet macro available from Abraxis upon request. The concentrations of the samples are determined using the standard curve run with each test. Samples showing a lower concentration of microcystins than standard 1 (0.15 ppb) should be reported as containing < 0.15 ppb of microcystins. Samples showing a higher concentration than standard 5 (5.0 ppb) must be diluted to obtain accurate results. The concentration of the positive control provided should be 0.75 ± 0.185 ppb.

The detection limit for this assay, based on MC-LR, is 0.10 ppb (µg/L). Coefficients of variation (CVs) for standards: <10%; for samples: <15%. WEB: www.abraxiskits.com

APPENDIX H APPENDIX H ­ PP2A PROCEDURE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF MICROCYSTINS (ABRAXIS, PRODUCT NO. 520032)

Microcystins/nodularins PP2A is the test for the detection of microcystins and nodularins
in water.

A. General Description Microcystins/nodularins PP2A Kit is an enzymatic test for the detection of microcystins and nodularins in water. A simple and rapid method that allows to quantify whether the toxin concentration is over the maximum allowed levels (1.0 µg/L, OMS 1998).

B. Test Principle Microcystins/nodularins PP2A Kit is based on the phosphatase activity inhibition by microcystins. Under normal conditions the phosphatase is able to hydrolyse a specific substrate that can be detected at 405 nm. Samples containing microcystins will inhibit the enzyme activity proportionally to the amount of toxin contained in the sample. The concentration of the toxin in the sample can be calculated using a standard curve.

C. Calculations and Graphic Representation of Results 1. Obtain a standard curve by plotting standards absorbance at 405 nm in the y axis and concentration of microcystin-LR in a logarithmic x axis. Draw a standard curve. An example of standard curve is shown below:

FIG. H1. STANDARD CURVE FOR PP2A

183

APPENDIX H 2. The concentration of microcystins in the sample is calculated by interpolating the calibration curve or using the following equation: y = a Lnx + b x = EXP (y-b/a) Where "x" value is concentration of microcystin-LR equivalents in the sample and the "y" the absorbance at 405 nm.

D. Sample Preparation Drinking water (water treated in drinking water stations). Sample preparation is not required.

1. Water from reservoirs, rivers, etc The content of dissolved microcystins, intracellular microcystins and total microcystins can be determined by following the scheme in Fig H2.

FIG.H2. SCHEME PROCEDURE FOR WATER SAMPLES FROM RESERVOIRS, RIVERS, ETC.

1.1

Dissolved microcystins: Sample preparation is not required. Following the procedure described in Fig.H2, dissolved microcystins content will be determined.

1.2

Intracellular microcystins: a. Take 200 mL of sample and filer in vacuum through a 0.8 µg/L nylon membrane (i.e. Whatman Nylon Membrane Filters, ref.: 7408-004). Reserve the filtrate for further determination of total microcystins. 184

APPENDIX H b. Take the membrane with the residue and place in a glass flask. The membrane can be cut into pieces to improve the extraction step. c. Add 10 mL of 80% MeOH in water with 0.1% TFA and 0.1% Tween 20. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle stirring and in absence of light. d. Centrifuge at 4000 g for 5 min. e. Take the supernatant and dilute it 20 times (dilution 1/20) with distilled water. At this point, the sample is ready to continue the assay as is shown in Section C. This way, the content of Intracellular microcystins is determined. If the concentration of MC-LR equivalents exceeds 2.5µg/L, the assay should be performed with on a range of supernatant dilutions of 1/20, 1/200, 1/2000,

1.3

Total microcystins:

Use the filtrate and perform the assay described in Fig H2. Total microcystins contained in the sample are calculated by adding the concentration of microcystins found in the filtrate plus the intra cellular microcystins.

NOTE: Presence of thiosulphate (or strong oxidizing reagents) may interfere in the assay, therefore collecting samples in bottles with this chemical or adding it to the simple prior to testing should be avoided.
