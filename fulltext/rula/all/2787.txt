DETECTION AND ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF IMMOBILIZED QUATERNARY AMMONIUM ANTIMICROBIAL MONOLAYERS ON POROUS AND NON-POROUS SURFACES PhD, Lukasz Porosa, Environmental and Applied Science, Ryerson University, 2014 ABSTRACT This research describes the development of novel, environmentally-friendly, nonreleasing contact-active thin film coatings by immobilizing the quaternary ammonium (QA) antimicrobial group on a multitude of surfaces. Various chemical anchors based on organosilanes (i.e. textiles, silica, oxide surfaces), organosulfur comprising of thiol (noble metals), organophosphorus comprising of phosphonate and phosphonic acid (i.e. stainless steel (SS), titanium (Ti)), and catechol (Ti, SS) monolayers are employed to attach the QA antimicrobial onto metal surfaces, while benzophenone photoactive crosslinkers containing QA groups are used to coat plastic surfaces (C-H surfaces, i.e. polyethylene (PE), silicone (Si), polyvinylchloride (PVC)). Surfaces treated with covalently attached antimicrobial coatings function by killing microbes on contact, preventing surface attachment, colonization and contamination without releasing the chemical into the environment. The advantages of this method of delivery of the antimicrobial include a lower cost of application, decreased antimicrobial resistance, lower toxicity and increased environmental safety. Samples prepared by an overnight immersion in an ethanolic solution of phosphorus containing quats followed by an overnight cure at 100oC showed the highest antimicrobial reduction versus electrospray application and no curing. Short chain phosphonic acid quats and the organosilane quat were inactive on titanium. Antimicrobial activity of long chain
iii

phosphonate quats prepared by dip coating and annealing on metal surfaces (Ti, SS, Al) was tested by growth enumeration in the dry state utilizing methods developed in the Wolfaardt lab. All samples showed a 100% reduction (106 cells) of viable Salmonella, Arthrobacter, S.aureus and P.aeroguinosa after 2 hrs of contact time and maintained their activity over 24 hrs versus the uncoated controls. To demonstrate the phosphonate quats were truly immobilized, Ti samples from the first trial were washed in distilled H2O, dried, and re-innoculated with 106 Anthrobacter colonies. No visible colonies of Anthrobacter remained after 2 hrs of contact time with the Ti surfaces indicating a contact killing mechanism at play.

CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION 1.0 RATIONALE FOR ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES Common surfaces that are frequently touched are inhabited by a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi which can persist on these "touch surfaces" anywhere from a couple of hours up to six months (Table 1.1).1 If pathogenic bacteria persist in healthcare and food preparation facilities, patients and workers can readily develop and spread nosocomial infections from touch surfaces such as door handles, pens, telephones, health care workers uniforms (HCWU's), stethoscopes, IV poles, faucets, food and food preparation surfaces (Table 1.2).2,3 The healthcare and food industry are facing an ever growing microbial contamination problem. Contamination of medical devices, healthcare products, H2O purification systems, food packaging and food storage are becoming a serious threat both in terms of cost and safety.4 To date, infection control counter measures which rely on personal hygiene, hand washing, masks and the use of disinfectants on hospital equipment to prevent the spread of infections have been largely unsuccessful. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nosocomial or hospital-acquired infection (HAI's) are becoming a national economic burden resulting in prolonged hospitalization and can lead to serious complications and even death.5 For example, hospital-acquired infection (HAI's) from contact with pathogenic microorganisms affect approximately 2 million people and result in more than 100,000 deaths each year in the US.6 Such unintended infections require 10-20 d. of additional patient hospitalization, costing the already strained US health-care system between ~$25,000-$30,000 per infection and billions of dollars per year.6 Another route for bacteria to infect patients is through hospital invasive support
1

equipment such as intravascular lines and implanted medical devices such as artificial prosthetics, cardiovascular implants and urinary catheters.6,7 Implant associated infections (IAI's) occur in more than 1 million patients and cost an estimated $3 billion in the US per year to treat.4 For example, approximately 10-50% of patients with implanted catheters run the risk of developing urinary tract infections (UTI's) translating to an average of $200,000 per infection in additional healthcare costs. The rise in the frequency and severity of (HAI's) and (IAI's) can be attributed to decreased antibiotic efficacy against drug-resistant strains of pathogens found in surface biofilms.3 Table 1.1: Measured persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces.8 Type of Bacterium

Surface biofilms are complex communities of bacteria that offer protection from environmental hazards (eg. biocides). Biofilm formation involves three phases beginning with the initial reversible adhesion of bacteria though polysaccarides and adhesion proteins on the bacterial membrane (phase I). After 2-3 hrs under appropriate conditions, bacteria irreversibly attach to a surface (phase II). Once formed (usually after 24 hrs) the bacterial biofilms secrete a protective peptidoglycan matrix (biofilm) capable of withstanding 1000 Ã the antibiotic dose of non adherent bacteria (Figure 1.1).10 As a result, once the infection occurs, it becomes difficult to
3

treat and strategies that prevent bacterial contamination or destroy adsorbed microorganisms that lead to biofilm formation are actively sought.10

Figure 1.1: Representation of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation (Used with permission from Ref.10). Consumer demand for odor and contamination free hygienic textile products has grown remarkably. Estimates of antimicrobial textile production worldwide were 100,000 tonnes in 2000.11 With an estimated growth of 15% per year in Western Europe, antimicrobial textiles are one of the fastest growing sectors in this industry.11 In addition, managers in the health care/food industries as well as medical device makers are actively seeking to introduce antimicrobial coatings as part of an infection control strategy combined with hygiene and disinfection protocols. In this regard, introducing antimicrobial surfaces that prevent biofilm formation could help reduce the spread of pathogenic bacterial infections from surfaces and implants to patients and healthcare workers, thereby closing the "nosocomial infection loop" (See Figure 1.2).8,9

1.1 Examples and Preparation of Antimicrobial Surfaces

In order to prevent the formation of biofilms, strategies utilizing antimicrobial surfaces have been employed to make surfaces inhospitable to bacteria.12,13 Small molecule monolayers or polymer thin films either "grafted to" or "grown from" a surface have been widely used to prepare antimicrobial surfaces and clothing. Figure 1.3 shows examples of the different approaches that have been used to prepare antimicrobial surfaces or objects. These prior art monolayers or polymer coatings include, for example, non-biofouling coatings which are passive strategies that rely on preventing bacterial adhesion with hydrophobic or zwitterionic thin films, but do not kill the approaching bacteria. A second class of antibacterial thin films kills microbes on contact either by releasing a biocidal agent or immobilizing a biocidal agent. A third class of
5

antibacterial thin films utilize a combination strategy of including a non-biofouling and biocidal component into the coating (see Section 1.3).12,13

Figure 1.3: Example of various types of antimicrobial surfaces prepared in the literature (Used with permission.12,13 Active releasing antimicrobial coatings based on the leaching of biocides are typically prepared by impregnating biocides in a polymer matrix coating. In this way, the leachable biocide is gradually released from the coating and kills adhered microorganisms via interaction with the cell depending on the biocide mode of action.14,15 The most popular leachable biocide is silver ion (Ag+).16,17 Quaternary ammonium compounds, although used in leaching type systems, are largely immobilized onto surfaces as small molecules or polymers that provide contact killing without leaching. The advantages of the non-leaching immobilized approach include longer antimicrobial efficacy, less chance for the development of resistant bacteria and overall is more environmentally friendly.3,18,19

6

Quaternary ammonium biocides can be immobilized onto various surfaces either as small molecule monolayers with various anchors (Figure 1.4) or as polymers.20,21 Grafting of larger molecules onto surfaces such as polymers can be accomplished in one of three ways; (A) physisorption of a polymer to a surface (grafting to approach); (B) chemisorption via reaction of anchors in the polymer with complementary functional groups at the substrate surface (grafting to approach); (C) growth of polymer brushes via surface-initiated polymerization techniques such as Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) (grafting from approach) (Figure 1.5). Grafting from approaches use ATRP polymerization initiators such as 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BIBB) directly bound to a surface or immobilized through an anchor (Figure 1.6).22 Photochemical linkers have also been used to bind antimicrobials onto textiles and polymers.23-26

immobilized QA antimicrobials on porous (polyhydroxylated surfaces) and non-porous (metal and plastic) surfaces. 1.2 1st Generation Antimicrobial Coatings: Literature Examples of Contact Active QA Antimicrobial Surfaces 1.2.1 Polyhydroxylated Surfaces (Textiles, Silica, Glass) Akin to the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin by Alexander Fleming, who noticed after a month long vacation that a petri dish contaminated by a fungus killed the growing bacteria, the first contact active antimicrobial surface coating was also discovered by accident. The first report describing a surface bound antimicrobial capable of killing microorganisms on contact was published in 1972 by Isquith et al., who prepared antimicrobial glass and cotton samples with octadecyldimethyl (3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)-ammonium chloride (ODDMAC or Si-QAC) (see Figure 1.7, Compound 3).35 The publication was based on Abbott's research at Dow Corning on silicone and silane based compounds for the control of algae.36 When measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of silane quaternary ammonium compounds in solution, Abbott unexpectedly found that he was getting extremely low values (cfu  0).36 He attributed his observations of false positives to the adsorption of the active compounds on to the wall of his equipment.36 As a result, (3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)dimethylalkyl ammonium chlorides with alkyl chains from 6 to 22 carbons produced the highest algae reductions and were quickly patented by DOW Corning (Figure 1.7, Compounds 1-11).37

After years of extensive toxicological testing, Dow Corning's antimicrobial quaternary ammonium agent 3, sold as an antimicrobial finish for textiles, was approved by the EPA in 1977 and received the Industrial Research and Development award as the best new commercialized product that year.3 SiQAC (Figure 1.7, Compound 3), is commercially prepared from 3chloropropyl trimethoxysilane (excess ~1.2 eq.) and N,N-dimethyloctadecylamine, and available as a 40-72% methanolic solution from the following companies: Aegis (AEM 5772), Piedmont (Ztrex72), Flexipel (Q-1000), and Dow Corning (Q9-6346), (Figure 1.7, Compound 3).45 In the original publication, Si-QAC (72%) was typically applied as a 0.1 wt % solution in H2O on cleaned glass or cotton followed by annealing at 70Â°C for 30 min in order to form strong Si-O-Si bonds with free Â­OH groups on oxide surfaces, e.g glass, ceramics, cellulose, silica. However, for industrial applications the compound was limited by the ready polymerization of neighbouring silanols in H2O and precipitation of the product upon long term storage (Figure 1.8). In aqueous environments, alkoxy silanes are rapidly hydrolyzed under neutral conditions leading to condensation of neighbouring silanols, resulting in the undesired precipitation or gelling of the product (Figure 1.9). For large scale applications, methanol-based products are undesirable due to their toxicity, flammability and the highly regulated nature of methanol.46

In 1995, Dr. Gary Allred and Dr. Lanny Liebeskind patented the Si-QAC as a 5% active stabilized product in H2O.47 The researchers from Emory University added a proprietary stabilizer that gave the organosilane an alternative to polymerization in H2O and resulted in a stabilized product. Currently the safer and more environmentally friendly Si-QAC is
14

commercially available from Pureshield as a H2O soluble solution of the active quat at 5 wt % and sold under different brand names such as AM 500, SiShield 500, BioProtect 500, or Microbe Guard in several countries. The product is currently used commercially as an antimicrobial finish on textiles such as cotton, nylon, polyester and wool.11,20 In the original publication, Isquith claimed that immobilized Si-QAC on different substrates such as siliceous surfaces, natural fibers, man-made fibers, metals and others had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.38 However, the publication only demonstrated antimicrobial activity of Si-QAC on glass against F. faecalis (gram-positive) and on cotton cloth against E. coli (gram-negative). The silane modified surfaces killed > 95% of the F. facealis visible colonies after 30 min measured with the Dow Corning Corporate Test Method 0923 (CTM-0923, See Section 1.6.1.1.1).38 The antibacterial treatment of Si-QAC and related organosilanes onto polyhydroxy surfaces such as textile fabrics, glass and silica nanoparticles (NP's) are well studied in the literature. Table 1.3 summarizes the historical account of various antimicrobial organosilane treated surfaces described in the literature starting from the original publication by Isquith in 1972 until 2013. Examples include different textiles surfaces: polyester fabrics (Entry ii), cotton polyester (Entry vi), microfibrillated cellulose (Entry xi), cotton gauze (Entry xiv), cotton textile (Entry xv) as well as glass (Entries i-ii, iv, xiii, xvii), titanium (Entry xii) and silica NP's (Entry xvi). These treated materials were shown to be antimicrobicidal after treatment with the antimicrobial trialkoxysilane 1. Other surfaces normally inert to silanization such as silicone rubber and metal oxides were also coated with 1 but required prior surface pre-treatment: sanding (Ti, Entry ix) and plasma treatment (silicone, Entries vii and x) necessary to activate them towards silanization. Similarly, organosilane antimicrobials based on the release of Ag+
15

(Entries xiii and xv) and polymeric QAC's (Entries xv and xvi) were developed after the original silane QAC 3. However the application of the antimicrobial varies in each study as well as the type of bacteria tested and the testing methods.

1.2.2 Metal Oxides Basic metal oxide surfaces (e.g. Ti, SS) typically contain far fewer surface functional groups (-OH) than are necessary for grafting monolayers and often require surface pretreatment, also know as passivation, in order to increase surface Â­OH groups compared to the acidic metal oxide surface representative of silica. Passivation is typically achieved by either chemical means64,
65

(dipping in Pirhana solution, sanding, or heating over 130oC in air) or physical

methods (electrochemical grafting, plasma deposition).66 A simpler way to functionalize metal oxide surfaces without the use of expensive and surface altering plasma pre-treatment involves the direct formation of phosphonates and catechol monolayers on metal oxide surfaces. Phosphonate monolayers have been shown to be advantageous over self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiols and silanes in terms of durability, long-term stability and surface coverage, especially on Ti and SS.67-69 Thiol-based SAM's lack substrate specificity (mainly reserved for Au surfaces) and long-term stability needed for biomedical applications, (i.e. implants).70 Over time, thiols become oxidized to sulfonates, which lack affinity for Au and become displaced from the surface.71 In comparison to silane based SAM's on metal oxide surfaces, phosphonate based SAM's are advantageous because they resist hydrolysis under physiological conditions and higher surface coverage can be obtained without a harsh acid surface pretreatment (to increase OH content).72 The problem with silanization on the native oxide of titanium is the presence of only 15% surface hydroxyl groups (XPS data).69 Silanization consumes surface OH sites and a lack of a neighbouring OH group can promote the cross-linking of nearby silanes to siloxanes. Siloxanes are known to be hydrolytically unstable and are easily hydrolyzed under physiological
17

conditions.69 Once a phosphonic acid molecule coordinates to a metal, proton transfers between the coordinated phosphonate and the metal surface can take place which can create new Â­OH groups accessible for further monolayer formation and result in bidentate or tridentate coordination (Figure 1.10).69

For example, the hydrolytic stability of silane to phosphonate based SAM's was directly compared with the incorporation of a fluorescent dansyl tag.73 The silane-dansyl molecule was assembled on Ti either by (i) attaching the silane linker aminopropyl(triethoxy)silane (APTES) on Ti followed by coupling with a maleimido reagent and capped with the fluorescent tag or (ii) attachment to Ti with preformed (3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-6-N-maleimidohexanamide followed by capping with the dansyl tag (Figure 1.11, (ii)). The phosphonic acid-dansyl reporter was prepared from Ti immobilized 11-hydroxyundecylphosphonic acid followed by coupling with the maleimido reagent and capped with the dansyl cysteine (Figure 1.11, (iii)).73 Both surface

loadings and shear strengths of each monolayer were found to be durable enough for biomedical device surface coating. However, as expected, the Si-O-M bonds in the silane based film were completely hydrolyzed after 7 d. in pH 7 buffer, while the phosphonate film remained intact (Figure 1.11).73

Similar to the formation of silane monolayers on polyhydroxy surfaces, phosphonic acid monolayer formation on metal oxides requires a thermal curing step to drive off H2O resulting in a strong M-O-P bond.74 Both bidentate and tridentate phosphonate coordination modes to metal oxides are possible and depend on the metal surface and the temperature of the annealing step (Figure 1.12). For example, surface coverage of the phosphonate monolayer was enhanced 5-fold by depositing the monolayer with six cycles of spray/heat/rinse versus just one cycle (Figure 1.13 A vs. B). Six cycles of deposited phosphonate films were found to be very durable and resisted desorption by solvent rinsing or by a mechanical peeling test with tape (compared by IR peak intensities, Figure 1.13 B).72

Examples of active surfaces include contact killing monolayers employing immobilized quaternary ammonium salts (Figure 1.14, 19-21, 23, 24), and the antibiotics daptomycin and vanomycin (Figure 1.14, 25, 28). Active surface coatings releasing biocidal NO and Ag+ ions have been patented (Figure 1.14, 20, 22).74 Passive strategies were described employing hydrophobic perfluorinated bisphosphonates on stainless steel, silicon, and titanium oxide surfaces for anticorrosion applications.74

Another example describes an antimicrobial stainless steel (SS) surface with immobilized QAC's via plasma activation. To prepare the surface, an ethylenediamine low pressure plasma was used to functionalize the SS surface with primary amines. Quats were formed by reacting the plasma-deposited amines with hexyl bromide to generate secondary and tertiary C16 amines which were later quaternized with MeI (Figure 1.15). These QAC modified SS surfaces showed excellent bactericidal properties by killing more than 98% and 99.9% of K.pneumoniae and S.aureus respectively.66

Another linker strategy for immobilizing polymer thin films either by "graft to" or "graft from" methods onto a variety of metal oxide surfaces was introduced by the Messersmith group. Inspired by mussel adhesive proteins which contain the catechol group, the Messersmith group functionalized various polymers with this anchor and used it to create both passive and active antimicrobial surfaces for the purposes of biofilm prevention and control.88 Since the introduction of the catechol as a versatile linker, other groups created antibacterial metal surfaces by immobilizing polyethylene (PE) based polymers with microbe repelling capabilities (compound 28), and various biocidal moieties such as antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides and quaternary QAS polymers via catechol groups (Figure 1.16, compounds 18-33).

1.2.3 Plastic Surfaces Common plastic or polymers surfaces widely used in the medical and food industries as medical devices and food packaging materials respectively (Tables 1.4, 1.5) are also very susceptible to biofilm colonization.95,96 Unlike polyhydroxy and metal oxide surfaces, plastic surfaces with functional C-H bonds such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene or COR bonds in the case of polyesters are inert to direct silanization using the anchor chemistries previously described for -OH bearing surfaces / metal oxides, and thus require a different strategy to immobilize an antimicrobial group. The literature contains a limited number of examples of covalently immobilized antimicrobials as a finishing coating on plastics, however many examples are prevalent where the antimicrobial is introduced as an additive or polymerized into the plastic during the manufacturing process. Antimicrobials incorporated into plastics where the active species migrates to the surface during the polymerization process are termed "self-finishing" coatings.18

1.2.3.1 "QAC's as Additives" Wynne prepared polyurethane-QAC antimicrobial coatings by blending a long chain quat with oxyethylene groups into polyurethane.98 By increasing the length of the hydrophobic alkyl chain to octyl and decreasing the length of the oxyethylene groups from n = 4 to n = 2, allowed for increased migration of the QAC to the surface of the polyurethane resin (measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) resulting in a 7-log reduction of S. aureus and E. coli (Figure 1.17).98 Furthermore, the antimicrobial plastics with the highest surface concentration (n = 8, m = 2) maintained their activity after immersion in H2O for 7 d., demonstrating they were truly surface bound. HPLC and antimicrobial analysis of the H2O phase further confirmed that the plastic sample was non-leaching and contact killing. This suggests that the QAC additives are initially mobile and able to surface-concentrate in the uncured polyurethane but become "locked" in place once the resin has cured. Thus, diffusion of the antimicrobial agents out of the film is prevented despite the inherent H2O solubility of the quat.98 The Foucher group successfully incorporated SiQAc into polypropylene (PP) during the injection molding process at 5wt % and obtained significant reduction in biofilm growth, the treated surface stained blue with bromophenol blue indicating prescence of the antimicrobial at the surface.99

1.2.3.2 Thermoset Antimicrobial Coatings: Cross Linked Networks Non-leaching antimicrobial-QAC thermoset plastic coatings are prepared by crosslinking the antimicrobial agent with polymerizable functional groups such as siloxanes, polyurethanes, epoxides and acrylates into polymerizable networks (Figure 1.18). Clarkson first prepared SiQAC-(SE) plastics by incorporating the antimicrobial agent, SiQAC, into silicone elastomer (SE) polymers via crosslinking with the hydroxy groups present in the poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer. The coating was toxic to the algae, Amphora

coffeaeformis for up to 20 weeks, but lost activity after 23 weeks in sea H2O. The toxicity of the SiQAC-SE surfaces was attributed to a slow leaching of residual uncrosslinked SiQAC from the coating. Once all excess uncrosslinked SiQAC was removed by boiling solvent Soxlet extraction, the polymer lost its anti-algal activity.100 Structures of crosslinked siloxanes,101 polyurethanes102, epoxides103 and acrylates crosslinked by UV light104 with the antimicrobial QAC as part of the polymer are shown in Figure 1.18. For example, the polyurethane QAC 35 prepared by a covalently bonded hydroxyl terminated QAC bearing a long perfluorinated tail with a

polyisocyanate cross linker showed a 5 log reduction of S. aureus and E. coli at low concentrations (0.5 wt %, 0.007 mmol/g) with ISO 22196 and JIS Z 2801 protocols.102

1.2.3.3 "Grafting Onto" and "Grafting From" Plastic Surfaces Covalently attached biocides such as QAS onto plastics can be achieved by involving either (i) plasma activation in order to functionalize the C-H surface with reactive groups such as OH or NH2 onto which biocidal polymers can be grafted to or from (ii) or UV light activation of functional groups known to directly react with inert C-H groups present on the polymer backbone such as benzophenones, vinyls, propargyls. In 2002, Gotenboss described the 1st antimicrobial QA plastic surfaces on an OH terminated silicone rubber after plasma treatement with SiQAC. In 2003, a patent described the plasma activation of polypropylene to either (A)

31

generate radicals from which QAC monomers were "grafted from" or (B) introduce functional groups onto which QAC polymers were "grafted to" (Figure 1.19).52

Figure 1.19: Bactericidal QAS polymers and small molecules prepared by plasma treated polypropylene (A) "grafting from" and (B) "grafting to" (Adapted from Ref.32).

An alternative way to effectively attach polymeric or monomeric antimicrobials to plastics surfaces is with photochemically active groups such as the benzophenone cross-linker. When irradiated with UV light (345-365 nm), the benzophenone group abstracts a hydrogen atom from a polymer (C-H) surface, forming a strong C-C bond (Figure 1.20).24 This linker has recently been used to attach thin polymer films to metal oxide and polyhydroxy surfaces via a phosphonic acid or silane group (Figure 1.20, 42, 45). Other examples include "grafting to" of antimicrobial QAC molecules and polymers with benzophenone groups to plastic surfaces with C-H groups under UV light (Figure 1.21, 43, 44, 46, 47). Dhende was first to covalently attach a quaternized polyethyleneimine (PEI) polymer onto various plastic surfaces25 (Figure 1.21, Table
32

1.6, compound 43) while the Foucher group experienced success with a benzophenone terminated C18 quat on PVC and silicone grade medical tubing105 (Figure 1.21, Table 1.6, compound 44). The coating was visualized with bromophenol blue and found to be stable up to 3 rinse cycles after destaining with anionic detergents and restaining. Lastly, Yang et al., used benzophenone as a surface initiator and grew polymers from PP surfaces that were later either quaternized or first quaternized and crosslinked (Figures 1.21 and 1.22, Table 1.6, Compound 47).106 With the unquaternized surfaces, a surface charge density of ~3.50 mol cm-2 was enough to kill both E. coli and S. aureus cells after 5 min. However, once the polymers were cross-linked, the surface lost its antimicrobial activity which was attributed to the loss of mobility of the immobilized polymeric cations.106

1.3 2nd Generation Antimicrobial Coatings: Literature Examples of Dual Action Antimicrobial Surfaces Since the advent and popularity of contact active QAC antimicrobials, current research has shifted towards combining both passive and active antimicrobial coating strategies on a single surface, giving rise to 2nd generation antimicrobials.109 These surfaces were designed to improve on the drawbacks of the 1st generation coatings which provide only one level of protection, either a microbe killing or microbe repelling role. 2nd generation coatings provide dual protection against invading bacteria by combining contact-killing with repelling capabilities so dead bacteria are swept or released from the surface after being killed.109 In theory, these ideal surface coatings are difficult and costly to prepare, with few literature examples (mainly on Au surfaces) known. One example of a dual killing surface with contact killing and biocide releasing (killing) capabilities was prepared by growing cationic chains from Au surfaces followed by impregnation with Ag+ ions (Figure 1.23).109 One apparent problem with solely killing surfaces is the build up and attachment of dead cells or debris that can deactivate the surface if not reactivated by a cleaning step. One solution to this problem was realized with a polymeric coating on Au surfaces that can be hydrolyzed from the quaternary ammonium (killing) to the zwitterionic form (repelling) reversibly (Figure 1.24).110 However, this surface required a manual hydrolysis similar to a cleaning step, otherwise the surface won't automatically switch after a build up of cells is sensed (Figure 1.24). The Foucher group is also interested in biocidal and self-cleaning surface coatings. Synthesis of an azo-benzene QAC with inherent self-cleaning capabilities switching from the cis and trans configuration under UV light is currently under study.99

36

The 3rd generation of antimicrobial coatings is foreseen to be capable of responding to stimuli so the surface can switch from a killing to a repelling one and vice-versa when necessary and target pathogenic bacteria exclusively. No literature reports of such stimuli responsive "switchable," "smart," futuristic surfaces are yet available.

1.4 Kill Mechanisms of QAC The kill mechanism of QAC's in solution or immobilized onto a surface is dependent on a host of factors that influence the compound's antimicrobial activity. Some of the factors include: (i) solution testing vs. surface testing, (ii) concentration/surface coverage, (iii) size (molecular weight), (iv) structural backbone, (v) type of counter ion, (vi) number of positive charges, and (vii) hydrophobicity of n-alkyl chains in the backbone of the QAC molecule or polymer.13,97,111,112 The bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is commonly targeted by different types of cationic QAC's that eventually result in cell death and is discussed below along with the

38

structural factors influencing QAC's antimicrobial activity both in solution and on hard surfaces.13 1.4.1 Mechanism of Killing in Solution In solution, long chain monocationic QAC's such as those employed commercially as disinfectants (Figure 1.25) destroy the bacterial cell wall and or cytoplasmic membranes by a two step process (Figure 1.26).113,114 First, the positively charged QAC's are inititally attracted to the negatively charged bacterial cell after which the QAC's diffuse and firmly bind to the inner cytoplasmic membrane. QAC's form ion-pairs with the head groups of acidic-phospholipids namely phosphatidylethanolamine (70% membrane composition) and in the process displace the Mg2+ and Ca2+ cations used to stabilize the lipid bilayer (Figure 1.26 b).76 Membrane function is further disrupted by the hydrophobic portion of the molecule by denaturing structural membrane proteins and inserting itself into the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 1.26 c,d). With the QAC concentration approaching the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the membrane begins to lose vital physiological functions such as osmoregularity and begins to leak K+ ions and protons.76 Eventually, physiologically relevant membrane protein function is inhibited and the cell loses the ability to respire, transport solutes, and resynthesize the cell wall.113 At high concentrations, the disinfectants form micelluar aggregates that completely solubilize membrane phospholipids and proteins causing leakage of the intracellular material, cell lysis and eventually cell death (Figure 1.26 e, f).113,115

For example, Iannou et al., found that the adherence of alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (ADBAC, Figure 1.25) (a blend of C12, C14 and C16 alkyl homologues) and didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC, Figure 1.25) to S. aureus cells occurred through slightly different mechanisms.117 ADBAC formed single monolayer coverage around the S. aureus outer membrane, while the DDAC formed a double layer. Both disinfectants eventually caused cell leakage and a total release of the intracellular K+ and 260 nm-absorbing proteins. Autolysis concentrations were similar regardless of the monolayers formed at 9 ug/mL (for both disinfectants), along with the depletion of approximately 30% of the internal K+ pool.117 The authors attributed the lethality of ADBAC and DDAC to the autolysis of S. aureus, however, it was concluded that mechanical lysis also seemed to be involved because cell autolytic enzymes became inhibited at the disinfectant concentrations employed (Table 1.7).117 Table 1.7: MIC values for ADBAC and DDAC against increasing S. aureus concentrations after 48 hrs of incubation in TSA medium.117 Biocide MIC (Âµg/mL) for inoculum test conc. (CFU/mL) Biocide ADBAC DDAC 105 0.6 0.4 106 0.6 0.4 107 0.7 0.4 108 1.0 0.6 109 1.8 1.6

In another example, electron microscopy was used to study the interaction and effects of QAC's on the S. aureus membrane. The micrographs (Figure 1.27) clearly showed the different stages of insertion of the QAC into S. aureus strain ATCC 25923. On the right, the arrows indicate tiny holes showing nodule formation (ND), indicating the beginning of cellular material leaking out of the cell. Cell deformity and cell leakage (CL) was also evident. Interestingly, after performing elemental analysis on QAS treated and untreated cells, the authors were unable to
41

detect the QAC chlorine counterion after it was taken up by the cells. It was theorized that the chlorine was pumped out of the cell on its own or together with the QAC from the cell prior to cell lysis.114 Another possibility could be that upon binding to the membrane, the chlorine counterion was diplaced from the QAC forming MgCl2 with structural cations within the microbial membrane.

Figure 1.27: Scanning electron micrographs of S. aureus strain ATCC 25923 indicating the effect didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) had on cell morphology, (a) control S. aureus cells containing no DDAC displayed normal spherical shapes, (b) cells treated with 20 g/L DDAC for 10 min. The arrows indicated where cell leakage (CL) and nodule formation (ND) was observed when the S. aureus cells were incubated with DDAC. (Used with permission from Ref .114).

The antimicrobial activity of the disinfectants discussed thus far are dependent on the length of the hydrophobic chain which follows a parabolic trend of MIC values (Figure 1.28). This phenomenon is called the ``cut-off effect'' where QAC's with C12 - C14 alkyl chain lengths show the highest activity against gram-positive bacteria and yeast, while those with longer alkyl chains (C14 - C16) show the highest activity against gram-negative bacteria. Compounds with short alkyl chains (n < 4) or very long alkyl chains (n > 18) showed the lowest activity.113 QAC's
42

with the highest antimicrobial activity and lowest MIC values are observed when the total alkyl chain length is (n > 10). In solution, QAC's with the optimum alkyl chain length (n > 10), exist as dimers because the attractive forces of neighbouring hydrophobic tails overcome the repulsive positive charges of neighbouring cations and thus show the highest kill activity. Dimeric-QAC's interact and solubilize bacterial membranes more freely in comparison to the monomeric QAC's. As a result the most effective QAC disinfectants are sold as a mixture of different chain lengths in order to ensure broad spectrum activity against different types of bacteria.116

When QAC disinfectants are used at concentrations above bacterial MIC's, developing resistance is unlikely, however, when bacteria are exposed to sub-MIC concentrations various resistant genes are acquired.119,120 In fact, gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli121 and P. aeruginosa122 have acquired QAC efflux pumps capable of removing quats out of the cell. P.aeroguinosa also contain enzymes capable of metabolizing QAC's as a source of carbon and nitrogen, therefore, the MIC's are much higher (upto 10 Ã) for this bacterium (Table 1.8). Further adaptive resistance to QAC's exists in bacteria capable of forming a biofilm, where the biofilm secreted lipopolysacharide layer can protect the bacteria from coming into contact with the
43

biocide. Single strain bacterial biofilms resistant to QAC's studied include those of P.aeroguinosa and Salmonella Enterica Serovar Enteritidis ATCC 4931.123 Lastly, grampositive bacterial membranes are less resistant to QAC's due to the loosely packed peptidoglycan outer layer allowing easier access to their inner cytoplasmic membrane and typically show lower MIC values (Table 1.8, S. aureus). Meanwhile, gram-negative bacterial membranes are inherently more resistant because a QAC must first cross the outer membrane with a bilayer phospholipid structure before it can gain access to the inner cytoplasmic membrane.

When dealing with polymeric QAC's in solution, factors such as polymer size, type of counter ion, the length of the hydrophobic backbone and location of the positive charge along the backbone all have an affect on the antimicrobial activity. Typically, polymeric biocides are designed with the QAC's spread throughout the backbone as repeat units and such polymer
44

systems show a dependence on molecular weight where a 1.4 - 9.4 Ã 104 Da range shows maximum activity. Polymers exceeding the cut-off range are inactive because they are too large to adhere to or enter the bacterial cytoplasm.97 QAC-polymers with loosely bound counter anions foster increased antimicrobial activity because the weaker ion pair readily dissociates from the quat, which leads to ion-pair formation with the negatively charged bacterial membrane. On the other hand, strong ion-pair counterion associations with the polymer show decreased antimicrobial activity because the tightly held counter ion will prevent the polymeric quats from associating with the bacteria.124 The spacer length or alkyl chain length refers to the length of the carbon chain that composes the polymer backbone. The length of this chain has been investigated to see if it affects the antimicrobial activity of the polymer. Results have generally shown that longer alkyl chains result in higher antimicrobial activity. There are two primary explanations for this effect. Firstly, longer chains have more active sites available for adsorption with the bacteria cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane. Secondly, longer chains aggregate differently than shorter chains, which again may provide a better means for adsorption.124 Lastly, with polymeric QAC's, changing the hydrophobic portions can have a drastic effect on the efficacy of the antimicrobial in solution. Tiller's group synthesized a C12 mono quaternary oxazoline polymer with a terminal hydrophobic end group with either 10 or 16 hydrocarbons in length.125 Only the hexadecyl polymer demonstrated antimicrobial activity, while the shorter decyl chain prevented the polymer from refolding into the right orientation necessary to lyse the bacterial membrane (Figure 1.29).125

1.5. Mechanism of Immobilized Contact Active QAC Some authors suggest that surfaces immobilized with QAC compounds kill microbes on contact by disruption of the microbial membranes based on observations with structurally different polycationic polymers. Two contact killing hypotheses were proposed and are based on
46

disruption of the microbial membranes either by (i) physical means, e.g. membrane penetration/disruption or (ii) electrostatic/ionic interactions with oppositely charged bacterial phospholipids and the polycationic molecules/polymers. Both mechanisms are described below. 1.5.1 Polymeric Spacer Effect The first contact killing hypothesis was proposed in 2001 by Klibanov et al., after showing that long chain cationic polymers of poly(4-vinyl-N-hexyl)pyridinium bromide "grafted-from" or N-alkyl PEI adsorbed onto glass slides were highly antimicrobial (Figure 1.30).126-128 Glass surfaces modified with large cationic polymers ranging from 25 kD to 750 kD resulted in instant killing, meanwhile the shorter chain polymers (2 kD) were inactive towards airborne S. aureus cells sprayed onto these surfaces (Section 1.6.1.2.3 (a)). Similarly, glass slides immobilized with these antimicrobial polymers were capable of reducing both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by a factor of 109 cells after immersing these surfaces into bacterial solutions according to live/dead staining. Since bacterial cell walls typically range from 16 to 80 nm, the surface grafted cationic polymer coatings needed to be long and flexible enough to be able to penetrate the cell wall and disrupt the negatively charged inner bacterial membranes, e.g. a polymeric spacer of 50 nm would be required to destroy the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane which are ~ 46 nm thick (Figure 1.31).126

1.5.2 Phospholipid Sponge Effect

A second membrane disrupting, contact-killing mechanism was proposed after observations that the short chain Si-QAC 3 and other shorter polymer brushes grown from surfaces (less than 10 nm) were also highly antimicrobial. Instead of being long enough to penetrate the cell wall, these surface immobilized shorter chain polycationic antimicrobials were hypothesized to disrupt membranes via ion-exchange between the polycationic biocides and structurally important mobile cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) within the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 1.32).130 Based on observations with short chain polycationic polymers `grafted onto' glass slides via silane linkers, surfaces with a charge density of QA cations (1012 1016 N+ positive charges per cm2) were required for killing after 10 min contact time depending on the type of bacterium. Approximately ~ 1 Ã 1010 QA or 0.015 pmol N+ was calculated to be necessary to kill one bacterium, thus a surface with 3.2 Ã 1014 N+ / cm2 would roughly kill ~ 0.3 Ã 105 bacteria/cm2. In all cases, surfaces grafted with more charges/cm2 of short chain QAC's caused faster release of counterions and resulted in higher and faster killing.42,131 In addition, Tiller proposed that highly charged surfaces without polymeric spacers need a certain degree of hydrophobicity around the quat in order to effectively kill microbes on contact. Based on observations with quaternized N-butyl or N-dodecyl-N,N-

dimethyldeoxyammonium cellulose polymer surfaces prepared from tosyl cellulose, polymers with only 50% of the tosyl groups (hydrophobic residues) substituted with the non-biocidal short chain (N-butyl-quat) were found to be biocidal whereas polymers with the same amount of N+ charges but with a low degree of substitution of the biocidal longer chain (N-dodecyl-quat) were

49

not biocidal. However, tosyl celluloses fully quaternized with the C12 tail were highly biocidal while the same polymers substituted with the C4 chain had no antimicrobial activity.132, 133 To further prove that a contact active mechanism was involved, the C12 fully substituted cellulose coatings were deactivated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 1g/L, 1 min) and an oppositely charged phospholipid (liposomes with 10% phosphatidylglycerol). As expected, antimicrobial activity against S. aureus was lost as these anionic molecules completely blocked the cationic sites on the antimicrobial surface, preventing the removal of bacterial phospholipids. In contrast, the same coating but with a polyethyloxazoline spacer (~100 polymeric units) between the C12 quat and the cellulose backbone was unaffected by the same oppositely charged deactivating treatment and killed all S. aureus cell in support of the polymeric spacer mechanism. The authors proposed that in the phospholipid sponge mechanism, the H2Oinsoluble bacterial phospholipids are removed from the bacterial membrane and transverse through small holes in the bacterial cell-wall as micelles in order to reach the oppositely charged antimicrobial coating (Figure 1.32). A hydrophobic portion surrounding the positive charge may be required to further stabilize the newly formed ion-pair, utilizing van der Waals interactions with the hydrophobic tail of the removed lipids.

(Used with permission from Ref.13,133). 1.6 Antimicrobial Testing A variety of methods are available for testing non-leaching (immobilized) antimicrobial products or surfaces based on either (i) growth enumeration of recovered bacterial colonies or (ii) cell viability enumeration after coming into contact with the active surface. With growth based methods, each method was tailored to a specific type of surface (textiles, metals, plastics) and differ in the way the bacterial inoculum is applied. Some methods require immersion of a test substrate with innoculum, while others apply the innoclum directly via (i) aerosol spraying and/ or (ii) placing a drop of inoculum and allowing it to dry on the surface prior to enumeration. Cell viability enumeration is typically based on fluorescence staining combined with real time
51

microscopy or assayed with various molecular biology techniques. Both growth and cell viability enumeration methods are discussed below along with their drawbacks and limitations. 1.6.1 Growth Based Enumeration 1.6.1.1 Immersion Inoculation 1.6.1.1.1 ASTM E2149-10 Originally developed by Isquith et al., the Dow Corning Corporate Test Method 0923 (CTM-0923)35 became known as the ASTM E2149-01,18 the standard test method for determining the antimicrobial activity of immobilized antimicrobial agents under dynamic contact and was later superseded by ASTM E2149-10.134Active surfaces are tested by immersion with inoculum following shaking and removal of samples at different times. Cells are serially diluted and colonies are enumerated on agar plates (Figure 1.33).

52

could clearly distinguish between a contact killing surface and a biocide releasing one.63 The growth based enumeration test method assumes that an overall reduction of living cells (CFU's, colony forming units) is due to contact killing without taking into account that some of the killing could be due to slow leaching of the immobilized antimicrobial over time.63 Since the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum lethal concentrations (MLC) of Si-QAC in solution are very low, it is possible to observe bacterial kill from surface leaching of the active over time. For example, White et al., reported a very low MIC for gram-positive bacteria (MIC = 10 ug/mL, S. aureus) and a much higher concentration for gram-negative bacteria (MIC = 100 Âµg/mL, E. coli) and (MIC = 1000 Âµg/mL, A. niger).27 Le Song also reported a similar result (MLC = 84 Âµg/mL, E. coli). negligible (see Table 1.9).24 Table 1.9: Antibacterial activity of compound 3 in solution.24 Test medium Deionized H2O Artificial sea H2O Compound 3 3 MLC (Âµg/mL) < 84 8000

1.6.1.2 Direct Inoculation 1.6.1.2.1 Zone of Inhibition In the agar diffusion test, or the Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion method, the zone of inhibition is often used to determine if an antimicrobial surface releases biocides or if it kills on contact.13 An agar plate with a visible zone of dead bacteria around the antimicrobial surface is attributed to the release of the active biocide that exceeds the MIC, meanwhile an uncolonized surface with no such zone is typically considered to kill on contact (Figure 1.34). The size of the
53

zone depends on factors such as the diffusion kinetics through the nutrient media and the original concentration of the active chemical present. With this test, however, it is difficult to prove if the immobilized surface is truly contact killing solely by the absence of a zone of inhibition. For example, monolayers of immobilized biocides typically contain a very small amount of the active molecule and thus the absence of a zone of inhibition could be mistaken for a nonreleasing surface when in fact the concentration of the antimicrobial agent is above the MIC.13 On the other hand, interferences such as charged proteins and other growth media nutrients that can deactivate cationic immobilized antimicrobials on the test surface would raise the MIC and result in a smaller or no zone in an eluting surface.13

1.6.1.2.2 Textiles The AATCC 100-2004 test method or the "padding test" is very similar to the Dow suspension test except only textile samples are tested and no shaking takes place. Circular texile samples are inoculated, incubated and colonies are counted after serial dilutions (Figure 1.35).18

Simple in design, the drawback of this method is reproducibility in the delivery of the inoculum which makes it difficult to compare to non-aerosol methods.18 Also the aerosol method does not distinguish
55

between contact killing or release killing from the surface.63 A literature example described by Klibanov shows the results of the aerosol method of a glass slide with covalently attached cationic antimicrobial PVP polymer (Figure 1.37).127

(Used with permission from Ref.127) (b) Industrial Standard Test Methods A variety of standard test methods designed to quantitatively test microbial inhibition via direct innoculation on solid surfaces include the (i) JIS Z 2801, the Japanese standard, developed in 2006 and superseded by (ii) ISO 22196, the international standard method. Other similar standard methods for hard surfaces include (iii) EN ISO 846, plastics-evaluation of the action of microorganisms, (iv) ASTM G21-90, standard practice for determining resistance of synthetic polymeric materials to fungi, and (v) ASTM G22-76, standard practice for determining resistance of synthetic polymeric materials to bacteria.18,95 As with the immersion inoculation method, the test microorganism is cultured, usually by growth in a liquid culture medium. The suspension of test microorganism is standardized by
57

dilution in a nutritive broth (this affords microorganisms the potential to grow during the test).95 Control and test surfaces are inoculated with microorganisms in triplicate, and then the microbial inoculum is covered with a thin, sterile film. Covering the inoculum spreads it, prevents it from evaporating, and ensures close contact with the antimicrobial surface. Microbial concentrations are determined at "time zero" by elution followed by dilution and plating. A control is run to verify that the neutralization/elution method effectively neutralizes the antimicrobial agent in the antimicrobial surface being tested.95 Inoculated covered control and antimicrobial test surfaces are allowed to incubate undisturbed in a humid environment for 24 hrs.95 After incubation, microbial concentrations on surfaces are determined. The reduction of microorganisms relative to initial concentrations and the control surface is then calculated (Figure 1.38). The drawback of the ISO 22196 method is that it is not representative of the actual antimicrobial surface contamination scenario. Typically upon landing, microbial contaminants dry very quickly on surfaces, whereas with this method, the use of a cover slip keeps the contact between bacteria and the surface in a wet state typically overnight. In reality, bacteria rarely spend that long of an interaction with the surface in the wet state.135 As well, cells adhered to the cover slip are not typically taken into account, inflating log reduction values (LRV's).136 This method has recently been modified by the Wolfaardt lab, by forgoing the glass cover slip and allowing the inoculum to dry on the surface prior to analysis and by the Green lab, by using a polypropylene spacer in between the substrate surface and the coverslip in order to distinguish release killing vs. contact killing (discussed below).63

Once dried, the surface is shaken with saline to remove unbound cells followed by serial dilution and enumeration on agar as with the other methods (Figure 1.39).137

(d) Green's Lab Modification (SLSDSS) of ISO 22196 Recently Green et al., reported an improved microbiological test method that differentiates between contact killing and release killing from immobilized antimicrobial surfaces. The new method, known as the semi-quantitative surface-separated liveÂ­dead staining (SSLDS) technique, is a modification of the traditional live-dead staining technique based on fluorescence microscopy.63 By utilizing 50 mm polystyrene spacers between the treated surface and a control surface, the method can distinguish three outcomes: (A) live or dead cells on the control surface, (B) live or dead cells on the treated surface, (C) live or dead cells leaching (Figure 1.40). Thus in the first outcome (A) the immobilized agent is ineffective and no bacteria are killed (cells stained green), (B) the treated surface agent if firmly immobilized and only kills bacteria at the treated surface (cells are stained red) while cells on the coverslip survive (stain green) (C) the antimicrobial leaches from the treated surface via the spacer and kill cells throughout, all cells are stained red or dead (Figure 1.40).63
60

Figure 1.40: A schematic diagram of the symmertric SSLDS method depicting three distinct antimicrobial agent states: (A) no kill, all cells are stained live (green), (B) on cell that come into contact with immobilized antimicrobial are killed (bottom), (C) all cells are killed because of antimicrobial leaching.63

The Green lab modified their SSLDS method further by incorporating an asymmetric direct inoculation design in comparison to their standard symmetric design. The difference between the two designs being in the asymmetric design with both treated active glass surfaces are separated by a spacer, meanwhile the symmetric design uses an untreated control glass (coverslip) on top and an active treated slide with the immobilized antimicrobial agent on the bottom (Figure 1.41). In this way, false positives resulting from non-adherent cells or interaction of the fluorescent dyes with the antimicrobial substrate found in the symmetric SSLDS are minimized. For example, if the bacterial strains fail to adhere to the active surface and after being killed detach to the coverslip, then false conclusions can be drawn that the surface was eluting.136

(A) symmetric design, (B) asymmetric design.136 1.6.2 Cell Viability Enumeration Cell viability on the surface can be quantified with fluorescence based on live dead staining combined with real time microscopy or assayed with various molecular biology techniques that measure (i) cellular ATP with bioluminescence, or (ii) CO2 respiration with flow cells or with (iii) redox active indicator dye (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) (XTT) measured spectrophotometrically (Figure 1.42).

Microscopy techniques can be employed as tools to test antimicrobial activity on a surface. The Foucher group in collaboration with the Wolfaardt group tested QAC immobilized PP surfaces for bacterial growth. SEM microscopy showed considerable bacterial colonization on the control (left) and virtually no growth on the treated surface indicative of a contact killing surface (Figure 1.43).138

Other groups captured the disruption of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membranes with SEM images after incubation with QAC-silica nanoparticles. Both the untreated and non quat treated nanoparticles (NP) showed normal cell morphology, meanwhile the QAS treated NP's showed cell lysis and cell death. (Figure 1.44).

1.7.1 Menschutkin Quaternization Reaction Discovered in 1890 by Nicoli Menschutkin, the quaternization or quat formation reaction is widely used industrially for the synthesis of antimicrobials, phase transfer catalysis, pesticides, ionic liquids and natural products.139 A typical quaternization reaction involves the reaction between two neutral molecules, a tertiary amine with an alkylhalide or sulfonate. Upon nucleophilic attack, the amine substitutes the alkylhalide or sulfonate leaving group in an SN2 fashion producing a positively charged quaternary amine with four bonds and a negatively charged counter ion, thus forming an ion pair. In accordance with an SN2 mechanism, the reaction is accelerated by more nucleophilic amines, increased leaving group ability, increased pressure and elevated temperature (Figure 1.45).140 Polar solvents also speed up the reaction by stabilizing the charged transition state (Table 1.10).141 With alkyltosyl or mesylates the reaction
64

is favored at lower temperatures and polar protic solvents in order to avoid the competing elimination reaction.142

In accordance with the aims of this thesis, the synthesis of quaternary ammonium antimicrobials for surface immobilization will be conducted through the Menshutkin quaternization reaction. Typically, the reaction goes to completion by employing refluxing temperatures in polar solvents from which QAS products crystallize or can be precipitated with the addition of Et2O or hexanes. Selected literature quaternization examples showing reaction conditions used to prepare surface bound antimicrobials are presented in Table 1.11.

The most direct method for the preparation of N-alkyl secondary or tertiary amines is alkylation of a primary amine with an alkylhalide (or sulfonate) known as the "Hoffman alkylation."145 Although the method seems simple at first glance, it lacks control due to the possibility of overalkylation (Figure 1.46).145,146 When starting with unactivated primary amines the higher substituted N-alkyl amine products formed can react with the alkyl halide giving a mixture of primary, secondary, tertiary and QAS that are impossible to separate. In practice, completion only to the secondary amine stage can be achieved by using a large excess (10-100 Ã) of the primary amine (Figure 1.46). However the drawbacks are the price of the starting amine used in excess and the extra purification steps required (normally distillation) to
67

remove the excess amine. The cost of the starting amine limit the scope of the reaction because only inexpensive simple primary amines such as methyl and benzyl amines could realistically be used.145 Recent developments showed that by adding a small amount of an additive (silica147, CsOH148) one can selectively stop the N-alkylation reaction at the secondary or tertiary amine without QAS formation. Stopping at the tertiary amine is also possible with microwave (ÂµW) radiation under aqueous conditions (NaOH/H2O149,150 or NaHCO3/H2O151). Additionally, with activated substrates such as allylhalide or CH3I, a primary amine can be driven to the quaternary amine as the sole product with the addition of a base (Figure 1.46, further discussion below).

Alternative reducing agents include the borohydrides, NaBH4,153 NaCNBH4,156 and zinc reagents, ZnCl2/NaBH4/DCM157 and

Zn/AcOH/H2O.158 The advantage of the EC reductive methylation over amine methylations with MeI is that the reaction halts at the tertiary amine without producing quaternary ammonium salt because tertiary amines are inert to further imine formation with formaldehyde. However, the intermediate imine formed in the reaction can sometimes isomerize, and upon hydrolysis, yield the carbonyl derivative of the starting amine plus methylamine.152,159 As a result of by-product formation, the EC reaction can give poor yields and can be difficult to purify if mixtures of mono- and dimethylated products are formed. An alternative synthetic strategy to N,N-dimethyl tertiary amines can be considered.

Figure 1.48: Mechanism of the Eschweiler-Clarke N,N-methylation. Combination of the Menshutkin quaternization with demethylation is another route towards N,N-dimethyl tertiary amines which avoids epimerization like the EC reaction. For
69

example the reaction has to be performed sequentially when the demethylating nucleophilc hydride is LAH.159 The first step performed in MeOH/bicarbonate gives N,N,N-trimethylalkyl amines which are isolated and demethylated in THF/LAH (Figure 1.47). A one-pot synthesis of N,N-dimethylalkyl amines is achieved by tandem quaternization/demethylation when NaBH4 was used as the nucleophile.160 A onepot procedure involved quaternization of either primary, secondary or tertiary amines with MeI in a polar aprotic solvent (DMF, DMSO, ACN) utilizing a sterically hindered organic base143 of greater basicity than the starting amine such as 2,6 lutidine (pKa ~ 6.77), tri-n-butylamine (pKa ~ 10.89), 1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine or PMP (pKa ~ 11.2), to mop up the HI formed in the reaction. This sequence is followed by demethylation with the addition of NaBH4 to the reaction without isolation of the trimethylalkylquaternary ammonium salt.160 Alternatively, alcohols can be used as starting materials to prepare halo and N,N-dimethylamine functional groups either directly with the Appel reaction (CBr4/PPh3)161 or indirectly by substitution of an activated alcohol either by mesylation (MsCl/NMe3HCl, LiBr)162, or silylation (TMSCl/LiBr)163 (Figure 1.49).

1.7.3 Stability of Quaternary Ammonium Groups Quaternary ammonium salts undergo dequaternization or dealkylation (debenzylation, deallylation, demethylation, dealkylation) by various nucleophiles in an SN2 fashion producing tertiary amines and transalkylated by-products bound to the nucleophile. By varying the nucleophile and the alkyl leaving groups the substitution can be selective, giving the desired tertiary amine or can occur randomly, providing a mixture of products (Table 1.12).164 Selective dequaternization of QAS is an effective method used to prepare tertiary amines having different alkyl substituents.146,165 Selective dequaternization is only possible when one of the alkyl groups is a better leaving group compared to the other three groups on the quaternary nitrogen. Two examples demonstrate the utility of this discriminating method for the preferential dealkylation. In the first approach, heating a QAC bearing a 2-hydroxyethyl group with hydroxide ion allows for its preferential and clean cleavage. This is because upon heating, only the 2-hydroxyethyl group leaves as ethylene oxide whereas other alkyl groups remain untouched by hydroxide (Table 1.12, Entry i).146 In the second approach, a QAC attached through a benzyl group to a solid support resin (Merrifield resin) and bearing three different substituents can be preferentially removed from the resin by selective debenzylation over demethylation. This is possible because the alkyl leaving group ability from QAS increases with resonance stabilization and the loss of a benzyl group and allyl group is preferred over the loss of a methyl group which itself is favored over the loss of longer alkyl groups (Table 1.12, Entry iii).165 Other nucleophiles capable of selective QAC demethylation to the desired tertiary amines include the hydrides; LAH,159 NaBH4 (HMPA, DMSO, sulfone)160, LiBH(Et3)3,159 LiBH(S-Bu)3,159 and also Na/NH3,166 OH(CH2)2NH2,167 LiI,167 PhS-Na+,168 CH3(CH2)2S-Li+,169 and piperidine170 (Table 1.12, Entry iii).

Otherwise, when a non-selective nucleophile such as OH- is reacted with a QAC possesing benzyl and methyl substitutents, a mixture of products is possible (Table 1.12, Entry ii). For example, heating benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide gives a mixture of benzyldimethyl amine and MeOH (35%) resulting from an SN2 attack on one of the methyl groups, while attack on the benzyl carbon results in benzyl alcohol and Et3N (65%). Elimination products (alkenes and tertiary amines) are not possible in this case because this substrate lacks hydrogens necessary for elimination to take place. Of course E2 elimination, favoured by sterically hindered bases can occur only on QAC substrates with -hydrogens and the leaving group in the trans configuration.172 On the otherhand, the E1 mechanism is possible only on QAC substrates with sterically hindered  and -carbons atoms.172 Lastly, depending on the nature of the alkyl halide and the basicity of the amine, competing side reactions may take place in favor of the Menschutkin reaction. For example when an electron withdrawing group (eg. ethyl ester) is located two carbons away from the halide atom, the elimination reaction dominates and the thermodynamically favoured ethyl acrylate is formed as the sole product over the quat (Figure 1.50 a). Similarly the prescence of acidic functional groups with a lower pKa than the amine result in protonation of the nucleophilic amine instead of the SN2 quaternization (Figure 1.50 b). In order to prepare such carboxylic acid quats, the tertiary amine are quaternized with propriolactone followed by acidic work up (Figure 1.50 c).173

1.7.4 Detection of QAC in Solution and on Surfaces A variety of titration methods employing organic dyes were developed to quantify the amount of quaternary ammonium salts widely employed as antimicrobials in consumer products and pesticides in waste H2O.174,175 The most popular methods employ bromophenol blue and dichlorofluorescein as dyes capable of binding to the quaternary ammonium through an ion pair interaction. Biphasic titrations employed bromphenol blue (Figure 1.51, 1.53) whereas

dichlorofluorescein was used in a monophasic titration to determine QAS directly (Figure 1.52).176 The biphasic titration176 involves an ion pair complex formation between the active ingredient quaternary ammonium cation and the indicator bromophenol blue anion which is readily soluble in DCM (blue bottom organic phase, Figure 1.53 b). Upon addition of [BPh4]-Na+ the bromophenol blue anion was displaced from the complex and migrated up into the top aqueous layer turning the organic bottom layer clear at the end point of the titration (Figure 1.53, c).

The amount of QAS in the test sample employing the titration methods mentioned above is calculated using the following equation: % QUAT = (Vtit Ã Ntit Ã MQAS) / WtQAS. where Vtit is the volume of titrant, STPB added to the test solution to reach the end-point (in mL), Ntit is the normality of titrant (in mol/L), MQAS is the equivalent molecular weight of the QAS, WtQAS is the gross weight of the QAS (in grams). The bromophenol blue dye has also been used to directly visualize quaternary ammonium compounds coated on fabric surfaces (porous surfaces). This H2O soluble anionic dye complexes
77

surface bound quaternary ammonium compounds forming an ion pair which stains the surface a blue colour.2 However, the bromophenol blue dye once complexed to the fabric stains the surface, potentially damaging the test material for future use. The same dyes may be utilized to indirectly detect the prescence of surface bound quats on non-porous surfaces such as glass, and plastic. A simple alternative to bromophenol blue for the detection of QAC surface coverage and coating uniformity is fluorescent detection. Thus, treated surfaces would glow fluorescent under exposure to a low power UV lamp, identifying areas of poor adhesion as well as missed areas during application. Additionally, it can also act as a unique product identifier and security feature for treated surfaces when added in trace amounts to functional antimicrobial solutions. Previously in the Foucher group, dansyl tags with organosilane,177 phosphonate,177 benzophenone105 and vinyl138 linkers were synthesized (Figure 1.54).

Mineral acids used to completely dealkylate phosphonate esters include both HCl and HBr, which are added in excess (10-100 Ã) and typically require long refluxing conditions (12-24 hrs) especially with the less reactive HCl. Under ÂµW radiation the reaction times are shortened to 30 min with a stoichiometric amount of HCl.178,179 Selected literature examples of the dealkylation of phosphonate esters with mineral acids is shown in Table 1.13 and the mechanism of this transformation is shown in Figure 1.56. Since the formation of the carbocation intermediate is the rate determining step, the more stable iPr carbocations and more reactive Brions generally give shorter reaction times (Table 1.13).

Figure 1.56: Mechanism of the didealkylation of phosphonate diesters in mineral acids. On the other hand, dealkylation of phosphonate esters with TMSX (X = Cl-, Br-, I-) occurs via a different mechanism whereby the halide ion acts as both the leaving group and the nucleophile in the reaction (Figure 1.57).182-184 In the first step of the mechanism the acidic phosphoryl sp3 oxygen reversibly attacks the electrophilic silicon of the silylhalide forming a charged phosphonium intermediate while displacing the halide. Irreversible substitution with the nucleophilic halide only occurs with the attack on the phosphonate alkyl group producing one equivalent of an alkyl halide and a mixed trimethylsilylated ester. With TMSI bearing the more nucleophilic iodide ion, the reaction proceeds at a faster rate than TMSBr and occurs predictably
81

the slowest with TMSCl due to the weakly nucleophilic chloride (typically d. at refluxing temperatures). Another cycle of the mechanism produces dealkylated bis(trimethylsilyl) phosphonate which at this point can be distilled or hydrolysed with H2O or lower alcohols to the free phosphonic acid.184 Aqueous hydrolysis always leads to the free phosphonic acids while the use of higher chain alcohols (decanol and above) can result in a mixture of products depending if the nucleophilic attack site is either silicon or phosphorus (Figure 1.58).

Similarly, nucleophilic displacement of alkyl groups from phosphonate esters goes to completion with lithium trialkylborohydrides via a SN2 meachanism (Table 1.14, Figure 1.59).185 The advantages of using silicone and boron reagents include milder reaction conditions (RT) and greater function group sensitivity. Additionally, these reagents are compatible with aryl phosphonate esters, carboxylic ester, ethers, halo alkyl, alkyne and alkene functional groups.186,

1.8.2 Synthesis of Phosphonic Acids The synthesis of -monophosphonic acid QAC's with hydrophobic tails typically from 12 to 18 carbons long are known in the literature. Two syntheses describe the preparation of a C18 monophosphonic acid QAC (Figure 1.60), one starting with the bromophosphonate (Route a) while the other with the bromoQAC (Route b), and both are obtained from an Abruzov reaction. Quaternary ammonium phosphonate compounds prepared by Route b were patented in 1955 for use as synthetic detergents.190,191 In the reported synthesis, the final product could only be isolated as Na salt of the phosphobetaine after hydrolysis of the phosphonate ester with HCl followed by treatment with NaHCO3 (Figure 1.60, a). Route b was used by Germanaud who
85

isolated the quats as betaines after purification on an anion exchange resin (Figure 1.60,b).192 The products synthesized by this method were not spectroscopically characterized in the patents and were used as is, while Germanaud's purification is costly and doesn't isolate the product as a phosphonic acid.192 The free phosphonic acid with a C18 was never reported (Figure 1.60, d), however the preparation of the C12 analog by method c starting from 3-bromophosphonic acid is known.193 Purification called for extraction of the H2O soluble C12 betaine into CHCl3, and no mention of emulsions was reported.193

1.9 RESEARCH GOALS

The initial aims of this research were to prepare the EPA approved Dow antimicrobial (3(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride)37 or (SiQAC, 3) and to improve on the original synthesis by altering the reaction parameters and by employing ÂµW heating. The primary research goals were to synthesize cost-effective and commercialy viable QAC antimicrobials capable of adhering to surfaces other than porous ones (i.e. Ti, SS, plastics) for use in the health care and food handling facilities to help curb the spread of nonsomical infection spread by direct contact with "touch surfaces" colonized by pathogenic bacteria. These new antimicrobials are expected to (i) possess broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, (ii) maintain activity / stability on the treated surface over extended periods of time (months) and (iii) kill microbes on contact without leaching of the chemical into the environment (prevent development of bacterial resistance). It was hypothesized that the replacement of the trimethoxysilane (SiOMe3) anchor present in Dow's commercial antimicrobial with a phosphonate (PO3R2), phosphonic acid (PO3H2), catechol or thiol end group would dramatically improve adhesion to non-porous surfaces, specifically metals, while retaining the broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of the quaternary ammonium compound. Therefore, a variety of novel and synthetically unknown compounds were targeted comprising of either a mono- (34-37), bis-(42, 47, 96, 126, 141), tris(161, 168) or tetra-multidentate phosphonic acids (146, 179, 183), catechol (190) or thiol (194 and 199) end group connected to a long chain quaternary ammonium group. Additionally, the synthesis of a new photoactive benzophenone-silane QAC 206 for coating onto non-porous surfaces, specifically plastic surfaces (C-H surfaces, i.e. polyethylene, silicones) is described.
87

Following synthesis, antimicrobial properties in solution and of monophosphonates 26 and 34A on metal surfaces (SS, Ti, Al) as well as their detection with dansyl QAC fluorophores and or bromophenol blue was investigated. 2.0 - RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1 Synthesis 2.1.1 Alkoxysilane-Functional Quaternary Ammonium Cations (SiQAC) The Dow antimicrobial (SiQAC, 3), synthesized according to published procedures37 suffers from poor purity and a lower than anticipated level of the active antimicrobial in the concentrate formula (< 72 wt %). Commercially, compound 3 is prepared from 3-chloropropyl trimethoxysilane 1 (excess ~1.2 eq.) and N,N-dimethyloctadecylamine 2 (Scheme 2.1) as a concentrate in methanol by the following companies: Aegis (AEM 5772); Piedmont (Ztrex72); Flexipel (Q-1000), and Dow Corning (Q9-6346).45 Industrially, the final concentrate is used "as is" without a purification step to remove any unreacted starting materials, and as a result, a varying amount of active quat is often produced (Table 2.1, Entry i). The composition of the concentrate on average ranges from ~ 72 wt % for the the active quat 3, ~ 15 wt % of unreacted 1, 1-5 wt % of 2, and ~ 13 wt % MeOH (Table 2.1, Entry i).

88

any spectral (NMR) characterization data for the product. Klaus observed complete conversion of starting materials to 3 only after 3 to 4 d. in MeOH without reporting any spectral data (Table 2, Entry ii).194 Similarly, Chisholm performed the reaction under solventless conditions at 110Â°C for 48 hrs in a sealed tube and directly prepared a 50 wt % MeOH solution without initial characterization (Table 2.1, Entry iii).195 In a recent patent, Ludwig reacted 1 with a variety of commercially available products containing alkyl amine mixtures with varying carbon chain lengths (C10, C12, C14, C16, C18 in different ratios) under neat conditions and reported a 100% conversion at 90Â°C after 48 hrs with a commercial starting material consisting mostly of 2 (Table 2.1, Entry iv).45 Instead of NMR, completion of the reaction was determined by diluting aliquots of the reaction mixture first in propylene glycol (1:1, 2 g total) followed by H2O (1000 mL of pH 3, 500 ppm final dilution) at different time intervals and titrating for the Cl- ion content (CHEMetrics, Inc., Calverton, Va).45 Lastly, Huang reported the synthesis of 3 using ÂµW radiation in a 89% yield at 150Â°C for 1.5 hrs in MeOH (Table 2.1, Entry v).196 Table 2.1: Literature/patent procedures describing the preparation of SiQAC 3.

Due to the added costs and difficulties associated with distillation197 and column chromagraphy necessary to purifying the final product, driving the reaction to completion employing solventless conditions and or ÂµW heating would (i) save on energy costs, (ii) avoid the shipment of the concentrate with flammable organic solvents and (iii) reduce the environmental impact of the toxic unreacted impurities (1, 2) in the concentrate and (iv) potentially require less stabilizer. Microwave (ÂµW) heating was investigated in the synthesis of 3 according to Scheme 2.1 in order to improve the yield (72 %, commercially) by altering the reaction time, temperature and solvent choice. Results from both sealed tube (ST) and ÂµW reactions employing solvent and neat conditions are summarized in Table 2.2. Complete conversion to 3 employing a 1:1 or a 1:0.95 ratio of 1:2 was never observed even after 48 hrs reflux in MeOH (Table 2.2, Entry v) or 72 hrs at 110oC under neat conditions (Table 2.2, Entry iii). These results clearly contrast those reported by Ludwig (Table 2.1, Entry ii), where complete conversion was observed at 90oC after 3 d. Monitoring the reaction by 1H NMR is advantageous over the titration method for free Clcontent used by Ludwig and clearly shows that the reaction never achieves completion. At best, a 76-80% yield is obtained only after prolongued heating times (> 48 hrs). Additional ÂµW reactions (4 mmol scale) were attempted in hopes of obtaining a further conversion to quat 3 by employing higher temperatures and shorter reaction times. Performing the reaction neat in the ÂµW (Table 2.2, Entry vi) resulted in only a 10% conversion after 45 min at 150oC whereas under similar reaction conditions, but with MeOH, the reaction reached 58% conversion (Table 2.2, Entry vii). These results support those obtained by Huang who observed an 89% conversion after 90 min at 150oC in MeOH under ÂµW heating (Table 2.1, Entry v).196 Another ÂµW experiment employing the higher boiling iPrOH instead of MeOH, at 165oC for 60
90

min (Table 2.2, Entry xiii), also failed to drive the quaternization to completion with product conversion reaching only 64%. Table 2.2: 1H NMR (CDCl3) monitoring of the formation of 3.

Progress of the formation of 3 was monitored with 1H NMR (CDCl3) by observing the disappearance of the overlapping dimethylamino and amino Â­CH2 protons [-CH2-N(CH3)2] at ~ 2.2 ppm from the limiting starting amine 2 and the appearance of two new upfield resonance at ~ 3.5 ppm [-CH2-N+ (CH3)2] and ~ 3.3 ppm [(-N+-(CH3)2] resulting from the quaternized product (Figure 2.1).101 Percent conversion was calculated from 1H NMR (CDCl3) integrations of the N,N-dimethyl peaks from the limiting starting amine 2 and the quat dimethyl peak in the product 3 according to the following formula: % Conversion = (x/6)/((x/6) + (y/8))

91

where y = the disappearance of the (-N(CH3)2) SM. 2 peak ~ 2.3 ppm, and x = the formation of [(-N+-(CH3)2] PRD. 3 peak at ~ 3.3 ppm (See, Figure 2.1 A and B, Appendix 1.2, Figure A18, A19). For example, % conversion (2.48/6)/[(2.48/6) + (2.97/8)] = 53% (Table 2.2, Entry ii).

Another option to save on energy during manufacturing is replacing the cheap but unreactive 1 with more reactive silanes (Figure 2.2). Employing other trimethoxysilanes like the bromo or iodo derivative would significantly speed up the Menshutkin reaction, however due to their high costs (> 100 Ã more expensive) versus the chloro derivative, this option is commercially unrealistic (Figure 2.2).

2.1.2 Organophosphorus Functional Quaternary Ammonium Cations QAC Antimicrobials (PQAC) 2.1.2.1 -Monophosphonic Acids QAC Antimicrobials (-MPQAC) A series of Â­monophosphonic acid QAC's (Â­MPQAC) derivatives 34-37 for binding onto Ti, SS and Al were prepared in three steps (Scheme 2.2). First, the Abruzov reaction between trialkyl phosphites (4, 5A-B) and dibromoalkanes 6-16 or haloalkanes 18-19 produced the phosphonate esters 12-19 in 50-93 % yield (Tables 2.3, Entries i-xix). Compounds 12-14 were quaternized with various tertiary amines 2-24 by the Menshutkin reaction to produced QAC phosphonate esters 26-32, while compounds 12-13 were alkylated with HNMe2 and NaN3 to give precursors 32 and 33 for use in Section 2.1.3.2, Method 3. Didealkylation of 26-30 with either HX (X = Cl or Br) or TMSBr afforded the desired antimicrobial phosphonic acid derivatives 3437. All three steps were optimized with ÂµW heating which resulted in shorter reaction times at higher temperatures and improved yields (Tables 2.3 - 2.5, Scheme 2.2).

Short chain n-bromoalkylphosphonates are commercially available although rather expensive (~ $101.50/5 mL, for compound 12 (S-A, 95%)). As mentioned above, their preparation is achieved through the classic Abruzov reaction and involves heating the two reactants (4, 5A-B) with 6, 7 or 8) neat under conventional heating (at reflux) or under ÂµW radiation followed by distillation to isolate the target products 12-17. Table 2.3 summarizes the optimization experiments to obtain products 12-17 and details the major by-products that codistilled together with attempted purification.

Unless indicated, the crude reaction composition was checked by 1H and 31P NMR (CDCl3) after the time indicated. D = distilled product, RC = recrystallized product. By-product (A) is a result of dialkylation, by-product (B) is a result of intramolecular alkylation.

Compounds 12-16 were formed in ~70 % yield on average, with the rest of the mass corresponding to phosphorus by-products identified by 1H and
31

P NMR (CDCl3) including the

higher boiling 5- and 6-membered cyclized oxaphospholanes (Table 2.3, by-product A) as well as the corresponding bisphosphonates (Table 2.3, by-product B). The thermodynamically

favourable cyclic 5- and 6-membered by-products (Table 2.3, Entries i-x) were a likely result of intramolecular attack by oxygen of the phosphoryl group of the electrophilic C3 and C4 carbon atoms, respectively. The driving force is likely to be the energy gain in the formation of 5- and 6membered rings (Figure 2.3).198

Most of the lower boiling by-products which include ethyl or isopropyl bromides, and triethyl or triisopropyl phosphates were removed by distillation from the mixture while traces of the corresponding bisphosphonates (by-product B) co-distilled with the product (Table 2.3, Entries i, ii, vi, viii). With compound 14, a new 31P NMR (CDCl3) resonance was observed at 24 ppm and was attributed to the cyclic by-product, A, due to intramolecular cyclization. Compound 14 was also difficult to separate with distillation as it codistilled with the by-product upon purification. Both by-products (A and B) were readily removed in the subsequent Menschutkin reaction either by an aqueous extraction of the short chain phosphonate QAC's 28-29 or after precipitation of the longer chain phosphonates QAC's 26-27. Compounds 15-17 were prepared as precursors for dialkyl vinylphosphonates (Section 2.1.2.6). Compound 15 was used directly after distillation without characterization by NMR. Compounds 18 and 19 (Table 2.3, Entries xvi, xvii, xviii) were prepared in high yield employing an excess of P(OEt)3 (3 eq.), (Section 2.1.2.3, Method 3). A crystal structure of compound 19 was obtained after distillation to remove excess P(OEt)3 and re-crystallization from EtOAc (Section 2.6.1).
99

Preparation of compound 20 was attempted under ÂµW heating followed by distillation which resulted in thermal decomposition of the reactants and products that led to the formation of multiple peaks observed by
31

P NMR. Another attempt to prepare compound 20 was

performed under reflux conditions with purification on column chromatography. After 24 hrs of reflux, the 31P NMR spectrum (CDCl3) of the crude reaction mixture revealed mainly unreacted P(OEt)3, likely as a result of steric hindrance. Chromatography on a short pad of silica eluted mostly P(OEt)3 which was subsequently converted to HP(OEt)2 on the column (Table 2.3, Entries xx and xxi). The second step involving the Meshchutkin reaction was optimized (Table 2.4, Compounds 12-14). With the bromo leaving group, the Menshutkin reaction was more rapid compared to the chloro derivative (48-72 hrs, reflux, compound 3, Figure 1.45). Employing a sealed screw cap glass vial in refluxing ACN, the reaction was complete in 3-4 hrs (Table 2.4, Entries ii, iv, ix) while under ÂµW heating at 150oC the reaction was complete in 2-10 min (Table 2.4, Entries iii, v, vi, vii, viii). Compound 28 was prepared from NMe3HCl by neutralizing the amine in ethanol/NaOH followed by the Abruzov reaction with 13 directly in the ÂµW without filtering off NaCl. Compound 29 was reacted for 10 min to ensure complete conversion of the weaker nucleophilic pyridine and then dealkylated directly in the same vial with either TMSBr/ACN or HBr/H2O (Table 2.4). ACN was the preferred solvent for the quaternization by enhancing the rate and in most cases the products solidified directly from the reaction mixture or with the addition of Et2O. Compounds 32 and 38 were prepared by nucleophilic substitution of 14 by NHMe2 and 12 by NaN3 for use in Section 2.1.3.2, Method 3.

Didealkylation of compound 26-29 was first explored with TMSBr and then optimized with HCl and HBr (Table 2.5, Entries i-xi). With anhydrous TMSBr the reaction was performed in DCM overnight and complete conversion was observed, however in situ generation of the reagent from TMSCl/NaI in ACN failed to give the dealkylated product (Table 2.5, Entry ii). This can be attributed to poor solubility of quat 26 in ACN vs DCM. Next, the phosphonate quats were successfully dealkylated in H2O with a two fold excess of HCl or HBr. Since the formation of the carbocation intermediate is the rate determining step in the mineral acid didealkylation of phosphonate esters (see Figure 1.53), the more stable iPr carbocations and the more reactive Br- ions proceeded faster compared to Et esters (Table 2.5, Entry iv vs Entry v and Entry vi vs Entry vii) and HBr was faster than HCl (Table 2.5, Entry iv vs Entry vi and Entry v vs Entry vii). ÂµW heating was also optimized with compounds 27 and 28 with complete conversion observed within 6-10 min at 140-150oC (Table 2.5, Entries ix and xi).

The long chain C18 phosphonic acid quat, 34, previously only isolated as the Na salt of the phosphobetaine or as an internal salt after purification on an expensive anion exchange resin (see Figure 1.57) was successfully recrystallized from EtOAc:EtOH and X-ray quality crystals were obtained (Figure 2.4, and Figure 2.40).

104

(solventless) or ÂµW heating (ACN). Trialkylbromophosphonates (where alkyl = Me, Et, iPr) may be used interchangeably in this reaction, however 13 was used instead of 12 due to easier cleavage with HBr during the last step of the synthesis. Any trace amounts of unreacted starting materials in the crude sample of 39 had no effect on the quaternization reaction with MeI (1.2 eq.), resulting in quantitative conversion to 40. These by-products may be purified at any stage in the preparation of 41 (Scheme 2.3). The last dealkylation step to obtain 41 proved to be a challenge due to insolubility of the bisphosphonic acid product.

Initially the reaction was attempted with ÂµW heating, however it was difficult to monitor due to solidification of the product in the NMR tube (D2O). Other deuturated solvents such as
105

CDCl3 or DMSO also failed to show any

31

P signals of the crude reaction mixture. After

evaporation of the crude product to an orange paste, the residue was treated with DCM/TMSBr at RT overnight in an attempt to isolate a crystalline compound after TMS ester hydrolysis. Once again, after extensive solubility analysis, the residue remained practically insoluble in every solvent including the NMR solvents mentioned above. Compound 41 is insoluble in H2O due the presence of two phosphonic acid groups and the hydrophobic C18 tail and the quat contributes to its insolubility in most polar solvents.

aminoethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine scaffold based on Yoshimura's work with a tridodecyl quaternized star-shaped precursor 44 (Scheme 2.5).199 Precursor 44 was prepared by a modified procedure starting with paraformaldehyde instead of formalin and heated in ACN, employing anhydrous HCl and NaOEt instead of HCl(aq) and NaOH to obtain the free base amine (see Experimental, Section 5.3.3). Attempted synthesis of 45 by quaternizing with 0.33 eq. bromooctadecane followed by 0.66 eq. of 13 or vice-versa failed to give the desired quaternized product peak (31P NMR  ~ 29 ppm, Scheme 2.5, Figure 2.6). Instead, an unidentified upfield peak from the starting material 13 was observed (31P NMR  ~ 30 ppm, Figure 2.6), in a 1:1 ratio with unreacted 13 (Figure 2.6). Since the reaction was performed without filtering off NaCl after
107

44 was freebased with NaOEt prior to adding 13, any excess base could have reacted with 13. No further experimentation was attempted with this scaffold.

Four methods were identified in the literature for the preparation of halo or N,N-dimethyl substituted methylene bisphosphonate precursors for the Menshutkin reaction. Surprisingly, none of these have been used to make QAC's (Figure 2.8). The following starting materials can be used to prepared alkylated methylene bisphosphonates: (i) aldehydes, (ii) monophosphonates, (iii) dialkylvinylphosphonate (iv) methylene bisphosphonates. Each of the four methods are individually discussed in the following sections.

Method 1: Onepot Bis Addition of Dialkylphosphites to Aldehydes The most cost effective reaction to prepare the -CH bisphosphonate scaffold involves the one pot addition reaction of 1 eq. of HP(OEt)2 to an aldehyde followed by mesylation of the in situ formed -hydroxyl phosphonate and subsequent substitution by another equivalent of
110

nucleophilic diethylphosphite (Scheme 2.6). The only drawback here is the extra step required to prepare the commercially unavailable aldehydes.

Using Method 1, bisphosphonic quat 50 was targeted from the phthalimide protected aldehyde 48 after hydrazine deprotection of 49 followed by N,N-methylation and quaternization (Scheme 2.6). However, the first reaction in the sequence failed to give the desired product (31P NMR ~ 24 ppm) by the one-pot method. Instead, the one pot reaction was performed

sequentially isolating each intermediate according to Scheme 2.7.

Scheme 2.7: Attempted stepwise preparation of 49.

Synthesis of the bisphosphonate 49 from 52 was unsuccessful, leading to a mixture of products (31P NMR, CDCl3). All base/solvent combinations including K2CO3/EtOH, Cs2CO3/ACN, Cs2CO3/ACN, pyridine/TOL also failed to give the desired
31

P resonance at  ~

23-24 ppm, with unidentified peaks at 17.7 ppm and 0.7 ppm always observed. A closer investigation of the literature revealed that the phthalimide protecting group is incompatible with Method 1, leading instead to heterocyclic products.200 Deprotonation of the newly formed bisphosphonate by the one pot reaction creates a nucleophilic carbanion that undergoes an intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction between the formed imide and the -functionalized phosphonate (Figure 2.9).

Synthesis of QAC aldehyde 56 was first attempted by quaternizing the commercially available acetal 65 with 2. The desired product was obtained along with an unidentified inseparable impurity by 1H NMR (CDCl3) after numerous attempts at recrystallization. No further reaction with this compound was pursued. The second way to obtain 56 is the oxidation of the quat alcohols 66 or 67 prepared in high yield (98%) and purity (Figure 2.10, Section 2.6.1, see crystal structure). Compounds 66 and 67 remain to be oxidized with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) as shown in Scheme 2.10. Preparation of the chloro and bromo aldehydes precursors 54 and 55 was attempted by employing refluxing HCl or TFA/DCM with loss of the volatile product aldehydes upon distillation (Scheme 2.10). Additionally, a potential problem with Method 1 is the possibility of the unwanted substitution of the halo group with nucleophilic HP(OEt)2. Instead, Methods 2-4 were explored in order to prepare -CH-BPQA's.

Method 2: Michael Addition to Diethylvinylphosphonate THP protected bisphosphonate intermediate 71 and 72 are known literature compounds prepared by Method 2 (see Experimental, Section 5.4.2). However numerous attempts to obtain these compounds via the Michael addition of the Grignard to 68 failed to give the desired product according to Table 2.6. In all cases, the reaction did not proceed (Table 2.6, Entries i and ii) or resulted in a mixture of products by 31P NMR (CDCl3) after EtOAc extraction (Table 2.6, Entry iii). The failure of Method 2 can be attributed to an incomplete conversion of the alkyl halide to the Grignard nucleophile or its decomposition after it was prepared. A variety of ways to prepare the Grignard reagent were investigated. First, overnight sonication of Mg metal in Et2O was tested, however, the next day incomplete consumption of the metal remained (Table 2.6, Entry i). Activation of Mg by refluxing for 2 hrs followed by stirring at RT ON resulted in consumption of Mg and a cloudy solution was obtained (Table 2.6, Entry ii). In another trial, Mg was stirred at RT ON before adding it to 68 (Table 2.6, Entry iii). In all cases, no Michael addition products were detected by 31P NMR (CDCl3).

Precursors for the Michael addition were prepared by literature procedures (see Experimental, Section 5.4.2). Compound 68 was prepared from the commercially available tetraethyl methyl bisphosphonate 73 and purified by distillation according to Scheme 2.11, while 74 was protected with tetrahydropyran and purified by column chromatography (Scheme 2.12). After performing the THP protection numerous times it was found that the reaction was complete after 1hr without added catalyst.

Method 3: C-P Formation Method 3 was attempted in order to prepare the amine protected 49 and 77-78 according to Table 2.7. Compound 77 was only successfully prepared on a small scale (< 1 g) when LDA was made in situ from n-BuLi/diisopropylamine (Table 2.7, Entry iii) in ~ 60% yield and purified by column chromatography. Unfortunately LDA failed to deprotonate the phthalimide protected monophosphonate 19 at -78 oC due to solubility issues (Table 2.7, Entry iv). When the same reaction was performed at -10oC, a mixture of two unknown products by 31P NMR (CDCl3) were observed at  = 31.43 ppm (30%) and  = -13.13 ppm (70%) respectively, but not the desired bisphosphonate 49 (expected ~ 24 ppm) (Table 2.7, Entry v). Lastly the N,N-dimethyl phosphonate 32 also could not be deprotonated due to insolubility in THF (Table 2.7, Entry vi). For large scale preparation of 77, Method 4 was investigated and is discussed below.

Precursors 18 and 19 were prepared by the Abruzov reaction in one step while 32 was prepared in two steps utilizing the Abruzov reaction followed by alkylation with dimethylamine (see Table 2.3, Section 2.1.2.1). A pure sample of 32, a new compound, was isolated by column chromatography (note: compound turns dark on storage at RT).

Method 4: Direct Alkylation In contrast to Methods 1-3, all of the starting materials used in Method 4 are commercially available and were employed to prepare the bisphosphonate QAC 93 on a large scale after a lengthy optimization of the first alkylation step according to Scheme 2.13.

Scheme 2.13: Preparation of bisphosphonates by direct alkylation. The direct alkylation of 72 or 79 to 85-96 was explored with different alkyl halides employing different solvents and bases (Table 2.8). Reaction progress was monitored by
120
31

P

NMR (CDCl3) by observing the consumption of 72 OEt ( = 19.27 ppm), and 79 OiPr ( = 18.06 ppm, Table 2.8). In all cases, the alkylation was incomplete and resulted in a mixture containing the desired product along with unreacted starting material, often requiring a difficult column chromatography purification (Table 2.8, Entries xiv, xv, xvi). The choice of alkylhalide proved to be the most critical step in the reaction. Alkylation with the bromopropyl QAC (Table 2.8, Entry xviii) that could directly lead to the desired product in one step, failed to react (31P NMR) while the N,N-dimethyl 84 intermediate, also failed to alkylate. Next, dihalo precursors of various chain lengths C3-C6 were employed (Table 2.8, 7 (C3), 8 (C4), 80 (C6)) resulting in low yields. When NaH/DMSO (Table 2.8, Entries iii, xviii, xix, xxii) was employed with the dihalo compounds, higher yields were obtained versus THF while the n-BuLi/THF reaction resulted in a complicated mixture of products (Table 2.8, Entry iv). When an excess of NaH in DMSO was used, compound 88 was unexpectedly dialkylated due to an intramolecular reaction (Scheme 2.14, Table 2.8, Entry xvii, Figure 2.11). As a result, a protective group strategy employing compound 10 was used as the alkyl halide to prepare 93 on a large scale (Figure 2.12). Compound 95, a known compound, was previously synthesized in the literature by Method 4 with NaH/THF in low yield (30%). As a result both NaH/THF and NaH/DMSO combinations were tested in an attempt to improve the yield. Even though the NaH/DMSO conditions were higher yielding (Table 2.8, Entry xxvi), it was difficult to remove the solvent fully during extraction or distillation. Instead, when THF was dried (4Â°A MS) ON (Table 2.8, Entry xxiii) a 60% yield was obtained and the unreacted starting material 79 was carried throughout a lengthy deprotection/mesylation/substitution procedure to convert the alcohol to either a bromo 87 or N,N-dimethyl group 96 (Scheme 2.16).

Scheme 2.16: Attempted preparation of trisphosphonic acid 101 via alkylation of 96.201

Halo QAC's 83 (bromo) and 102 (chloro) were synthesized by the Menschutkin reaction as precursors for alkylation of 79 in order to directly obtain the target bisphosphonate QAC 93 in one step with Method 4 (Scheme 2.17 and Scheme 2.13). Alkylation with bromo precursor 83 resulted in only a 24 % conversion by NMR spectroscopy (1H,
31

P, CDCl3) (Table 2.8, Entry

xviii). Purifying the product from the quat mixture was never attempted. The less reactive chloro precursor was made and characterized by NMR spectroscopy (1H,
31

P, CDCl3, Figure 2.14) but

never employed in the alkylation reaction with 79 due the low product conversion with the bromo precursor.

2.1.2.4 Bisphosphonates via the 3-Component Reaction A 3-component reaction was used to prepare precursor 105 in 75% yield (Experimental, Section 5.5.0) according to known procedures and quaternized with bromooctadecane (Scheme 2.18).202 No useful NMR data was obtained for compound 106 due to difficulties with purification. It remains doubtful whether 105, a weak and hindered nucleophile due to the presence of two electron withdrawing phosphonate ester groups could be quaternized.

2.1.2.5 -Aminobisphosphonic acids QAC Antimicrobials (-ABPQA) -Aminobisphosphonic acid QAC's were synthesized either directly via the three component Kabachnik-Fields reactions between formaldehyde, a primary amine and dialkyl phosphite (Scheme 2.19) or sequentially by isolating the imine intermediate (Scheme 2.20). The synthesis required a three step process starting with the Kabachnik-Fields reaction to generate novel bifunctional molecules with the -bisphosphonates anchored at one end and either a N,Ndimethylamino 113 or halo 114-117, 120 end group required for the quaternization reaction. The third and final step required didealkylation of the QAC bisphosphonate 121 to the free phosphonic acid 126 (Scheme 2.21). Initially N1,N1-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine 108 seemed like the most logical choice of starting material for the Kabachnik-Fields reaction in order to obtain compound 113. Compound 108 is an inexpensive commercially available liquid and required no additional steps to free the primary amine as was the case with the halo precursors 109, 110 and sold as the HCl and HBr salts, respectively.

132

all cases, the expected -bisphosphonate 113 product peak at  ~ 26-24 ppm (31P NMR, CDCl3) was observed while monitoring the reaction, however it was incorrectly assigned as compound 113. After minimal mass was recovered in the organic layer after extraction, the reaction was directly purified by column chromatography and the peak at ~ 26 ppm was attributed to compound 124 after a further 1H NMR (CDCl3) analysis (Figure 2.15).

Based on the Kabachnik-Fields mechanism (Figure 2.16), the basic N,N-dimethylamine appears to play a catalytic role in driving the Abramov addition of dialkylphosphite to C=O bond forming -hydroxy phosphonate (Route B) over the Pudovik addition of dialkylphosphite to the imine (Figure 2.16, Route A). In fact, the literature preparation of 124 requires a catalytic amount of base (see Section 2.1.2.7). In contrast, when starting materials without a basic group such as the halo or OH derivatives were used, the Kabachnik-Fields reaction mechanism is favoured (Figure 2.16, Route A) and the bisphosphonates, 114-117 were obtained when 2 eq. of the dialkylphosphite was employed.

Figure 2.16: Possible mechanistic routes involved in the Kabachnik-Fields reaction.203 Next, the halo starting materials 107A and 107B (Scheme 2.19) were investigated in the Kabachnik-Fields reaction. As mentioned earlier, both the bromo 107A and chloro 107B sold as the HCl and HBr salts respectively, required an extra step to free base the amine salt prior to addition of formaldehyde and dialkylphosphonate. When Et3N or NaOH (1 eq.) were stirred with 107A for 20 min prior to the addition of formaldehyde and dialkylphosphonate in the same pot, the desired bisphosphonate was never observed (Table 2.9, Entries viii and ix). Instead of the desired bisphosphonate product with a 31P NMR (D2O) peak at ~ 24 ppm, a major downfield 31P
136

NMR peak at  ~ 8 ppm was observed with complete consumption of HPO(OMe)2 (31P,  = 14.7 ppm). In order for the reaction to proceed, 109 and 110 required a tedious extraction from 6N NaOH or KOH with isolation of the separated free bases as yellow oils that had to be used directly otherwise self-polymerization took place (Table 2.9, Entries x-xiv). No solvent was added during the extraction because when DCM, CHCl3, or EtOAc were employed for the free based halo derivatives, which prefered the aqueous phase over the organic phase (~ 5% extraction efficiency by weight). As a result, the oily extracts of the free based compounds were contaminated with ~ 40% H2O (1H NMR), resulting in only ~ 50% overall extraction yield starting from the amine salts (Table 2.9, Entries xx-xiv, note low product yields, 21-53%). Lastly, Et3N/ACN was employed in order to deprotonate the starting materials in situ without the need to extract and thus improve the yield, however the resulting triethylamine salt failed to precipitate from the solution and could not be removed prior to the Kabachnik-Fields reaction. Due to problems with starting materials 108-110 in the Kabachnik-Fields reaction described above, the reaction was screened with the amino alcohol 111 used in the literature to make 117 in refluxing THF (Experimental, Section 5.6.0). Under reflux conditions, the aminoalcohol 111 (Table 2.9, Entries xv and xvi, THF) or the triazine 122 (Table 2.9, Entry xv, ACN) worked well in the Kabachnik-Fields reaction with solid paraformaldehyde, resulting in yields over 70% by 31P NMR (CDCl3). Similarly, ÂµW heating under neat conditions gave a 74% yield when reaction parameters were optimized to 5 min at 130oC (Table 2.9, Entry xxviii). This is the first ÂµW synthesis of 117, while synthesis of -bisphosphonates with only alkyl chains (starting with 3-aminopropanol), has been previously reported with the Kabachnik-Fields reaction under ÂµW heating (60 min, 100oC).204,205 After success under solventless conditions in the ÂµW, a sealed tube experiment was thus perfomed with the alcohol starting material under
137

neat conditions for 30 min at 110oC which resulted in a 85% yield after column chromatography (Table 2.9, Entry xix). With the successful preparation of 117, the conversion to either a bromo, iodo (Experimental, Section 5.6.0) or NMe2 (Table 2.9, Entries vi and vii) required two extra steps, activation via mesyl or TsCl followed by the SN2 reaction. All sulfonyl chloride reactions resulted in higher yields and faster conversion times when the catalyst NMe3HCl162 was employed (30 min vs 24 hrs for non-catalyzed reaction). When the amine starting materials 108 or 111 were reacted solely with formaldehyde without addition of HP(OEt)2, the corresponding imines were formed respectively. However at RT, the imine compounds were in equilibrium with the trimer compounds 122 and 123 as observed by 1H NMR (CDCl3, Scheme 2.20).206 Trimer 123 was purified by an aqueous wash and subjected to quaternization with bromooctadecane. However, purification of the final product failed to give clean samples for characterization by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 2.17). Instead, compound 121 was prepared from 115 and quaternized with bromooctadecane. Compound 115 was prepared via a longer route by activating the alcohol 111 via the mesyl 118 or tosyl 119 group refluxing in excess HNMe2 (Scheme 2.19, Step 1-2). Pure 121 was finally obtained after column chromatography eluting with EtOH(NaBrsat):ACN (1:3) (Figure 2.18).

Figure 2.18: 1H NMR (CDCl3) spectrum of -ABPQA 121. Dealkylation of ester 121 to the desired -bisphosphonic acid 126 was unsuccessful with both HBr and TMSBr (Scheme 2.21, Figure 2.19, a and b) and resulted in a mixture of products by
31

P NMR (D2O). The TMSBr reaction seemed promising at first by

31

P NMR with a major

peak at ~ 10 ppm attributed to the TMS ester (Figure 2.19, b). However, after hydrolysis with H2O and evaporation of volatiles, the product was insoluble in both D2O and CDCl3. After treatment of 126 with 1 eq. of NaOH to make the sodium salt, decomposition was observed with three unidentified 31P NMR (D2O) signals at  ~ 21, 16 and 6.5 ppm resulting in an inseparable mixture of products (Figure 2.19, c). According to Guerrero, instead of the phosphonic acid, phosphonate esters may also bind to metal oxide surfaces with the loss of an ethyl group.207

Synthesis of tetraphosphonate 127 was attempted from -bisphosphonate 113 after deprotonation with a strong base (LDA or NaH) and substitution with ClP(OEt)2 (Scheme 2.22). Monitoring the reaction with LDA as base at -10Â°C after 10 min by
31

P NMR spectroscopy

(CDCl3) showed no product 127 formation (Figure 2.20 a). Employing the same conditions as above but allowing the reaction to stir for 60 min at RT and extracting into EtOAc recovered mainly unreacted SM 113. Switching to NaH made no difference and no reaction took place (Figure 2.20 c). Allowing the deprotonation to occur at -78Â°C with LDA prior to the addition of ClP(OEt)2 seemed promising with consumption of 113 by 31P NMR spectroscopy (Figure 2.20 e), however after extraction into EtOAc and column chromatography of the reaction mixture no product corresponding to 127 was eluted.

2.1.2.6 -Aminobisphosphonic Acids QAC Antimicrobials (-ABPQA) Inspired by Matveeva's work208 on the H2O based synthesis of -aminobisphosphonates, the reaction was explored with various bi-functional amines in order to prepare precursor halo or dimethylamino substituted -aminobisphosphonates necessary for quaternization (Scheme 2.23, Table 2.10). Similarly to -aminobisphosphonates (Section 2.1.2.5), the most direct way to prepare N,N-dimethyl or halo -aminobisphosphonates is the addition of vinyl phosphonate to amines 108-110. The reaction progress was monitored by NMR (31P, D2O) and reaction
143

completeness was ascertained with the consumption of dialkylphosphite 129 ( = 19.97 to 23.71 ppm) and 130 ( = 18.10 ppm to 20.85 ppm, Table 2.10).

* excess NaOH used (1.2 eq.), ** excess 129-130 was used. n/a: multiple peaks were observed and none of which corresponded to the product. In most cases the addition to amines 108-110 and the quat amine 128 resulted in a mixture containing the product with unreacted starting material (Table 2.10, Entries i-ix) or in the case of the halo amines with a mixture of mono- and bis--aminophosphonates identified by
31

P NMR (Figure 2.21 and Table 2.10, Entries iv, v, vii, viii). The added base used (Table 2.10,

Entries iv-viii) to freebase the amine salts 107A, 107B hindered the bis Michael addition to vinylphosphonate. Even when the based/amine salt was added in a 0.9/1 ratio, the reaction still resulted in an inseparable mixture of mono and bisphosphonates along with unreacted SM in the following ratios: (Figure 2.21 and Table 2.10, Entry v (1.0:0.12:0.32), Entry vii (1.0:0.65:0.43), Entry viii (0.66:1.0:0.34). Surprisingly, the quat amine 128 having no basic functionalities gave a low yield of product 140 with considerable unreacted starting material (~1:1 ratio) and was left unpurified (Figure 2.21 and Table 2.10, Entry ix). As a result bis -aminobisphosphonates were
146

successfully prepared by employing a longer indirect method that involving 3-amino-1-propanol 111. When the reaction was performed with 111 and either dimethyl- or diethylvinylphosphonate (Table 2.10, Entries x-xii) a clean reaction was observed with complete consumption of the starting material. Excess vinylphosphonate was removed by column chromatography to give pure 135 or 136 (Figure 2.21 and Table 2.10, Entries x-xii). Further functional group transformations were necessary to activate the alcohol 111 into a better leaving group through mesylation followed by substitution with excess dimethylamine and quaternization to give 140 (Scheme 2.23). The mesyl chloride 137 intermediate decomposed over time at RT and was reacted directly (Figure 2.22). Finally, quaternization with bromooctadecane gave quat 140 that was isolated after column chromatography along with 10% of impurities (27.6 and 26.8 ppm by
31

P NMR, CDCl3), (Figure 2.23, Experimental, Section

5.7.0). No dealkylation of 140 to the phosphonic acid 141 was attempted at this time.

The commercially available starting material vinyl phosphonates 129-130 were quite expensive to purchase (~ $213/5mL, 95% for R1 = Et, S-A) and as a result, all of the optimization reactions were performed on a very small scale (~ 1 mmol). Preparation of 130 was attempted from 15 and KOH in EtOH following literature procedures (Section 2.1.2.1).209 However, the major product was difficult to purify by distillation from unreacted 15 and the byproduct, diethyl (2-hydroxyethyl)phosphonate, resulting from the competing elimination reaction (Figure 2.24).

Preparation of tetraphosphonates starting from -aminobisphosphonate 141 according to (Scheme 2.24) was also targeted but abandoned. It was difficult to isolate the THP protected 145 intermediate even after employing an excess of p-TosOH catalyst. As a result no further reactions leading to 146 were possible.

Scheme 2.24: Attempted synthetic route to tetraphosphonate QAC 146 from -amino bisphosphonate 141.

The amine QAC precusor 144 utilized in the Michael addition was prepared via the Menshutkin reaction from amine protected alkylhalides 147-151 and N,N-dimethylocteadecyl amine in good yields. However, only the CBz 156 and PHT 152 protecting groups were successfully deprotected to the free quat amine 144 with H2/PdC and excess hydrazine hydrate respectively (Scheme 2.25). There is only one literature report describing the preparation of 144 from the amide 153 after basic hydrolysis. However in our hands, extraction of 144 into CHCl3 upon purification was problematic and led to to inseparable emulsions and low product recovery. Figure 2.25 shows the 1H NMR spectrum (D2O) of 144 prepared from hydrazine cleavage of 152.

2.1.2.7 Tridentate Phosphonic Acid QAC Antimicrobials (TPQA) Synthesis of novel multidentate tris--hydroxy phosphonic acid, tris--hydroxy phosphonic acid and or tris--hydroxy phosphonic acid QAC was explored with the inexpensive and commercially available polyhydroxy 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol (tris) scaffold. Prior to installing the phosphonate group from the hydroxyl groups, the primary amine from tris was BOC protected as 157 and used to prepare tris--hydroxy phosphonic acid (Scheme 2.26), tris--hydroxy phosphonic acid (Scheme 2.27 a) and tris--hydroxy phosphonic acid QAC (Scheme 2.28). Meanwhile, the tris-N,N-dimethylacrylamide 163 was also tried in an attempt to prepare tris--hydroxy phosphonic acid but was unsuccessful (Scheme 2.27 b). First, in the preparation of tris--hydroxy phosphonic acid 161, the hydroxyl groups from tris-BOC were subjected to nucleophilic substitution with mesylphosphonate 158 according to the first step in Scheme 2.26. Unfortunately, the first step failed and none of the three nucleophilic OH's substituted the mesylphosphonate 158 with the following solvent/base combinations: NaH/DMF, KOt-Bu/DMF, KOt-Bu/t-BuOH. It is possible that steric hindrance along with the prescence of multiple nucleophiles and insolubility of tris-BOC in t-BuOH played a negative role on the reaction outcome.

Scheme 2.26: Proposed synthesis of tris--hydroxyphosphonate QAC 161.

Next, tris--hydroxyphosphonate QAC's 162 and 164 were targeted via the oxa-Michael addition of the three hydroxy groups from both tris-BOC 157 and tris N,N-dimethylacrylamide 163 onto dimethylvinyl phosphonate according to Scheme 2.27. As was the case with tri-hydroxyphosphonate QAC, both starting materials were inert in this reaction and no addition products were observed by TLC and NMR (31P, 1H, D2O). Once again insolubility and steric factors were likely the result of the failed addition reaction. In order to increase solubility and decrease the steric strain of the three hydroxyl groups in close proximity to each other the
155

synthesis of tri--hydroxyphosphonate QAC was explored in DMF and a longer carbon spacer (C3) was used between the phosphonate and oxygen atoms.

The conversion of BOC protected trivinyl derivative 165 and tris-BOC 157 to tri-hydroxyphosphonate was attempted according to Scheme 2.28. However, like the case with the preparation of tri--hydroxyphosphonate and tri--hydroxyphosphonate QAC's, the first step of the reaction also failed to add the desired phosphonate groups onto these starting materials. As a result, no further reactions with these starting materials was pursued.

BOC protection of the commercially available tris 171 followed by recrystallization from EtOAc gave precursor 157 in good yield (Scheme 2.30). A neutral BOC deprotection procedure that could be applied to any of the envisioned tris-BOC phosphonate intermediates 159, 162, 166 was identified using boiling H2O that was successfully used in deprotecting 157 to the free amine (Scheme 2.30). According to Wang et al., at elevated temperatures H2O plays the role of a dual acid/base catalyst resulting in the free neutral amine whereas the BOC group breaks down to the easily removable by products, t-BuOH and CO2 (Figure 2.26).210

Lastly, precursor 163, a new compound was prepared from the commercially available tris acrylamine 173, and was synthesized via the rapid Michael addition with dimethyl amine (5 min by TLC) according to Scheme 2.31.

2.1.2.8 Amine Scaffolds for Tetra Phosphonic Acid QAC Antimicrobials Synthesis of tetradentate -amino phosphonate QAC 179 and 183 were targeted via the Michael addition of two free primary amines onto 129 after selective BOC protection of commercially available triamine building blocks 174 and 180 according to Schemes 2.32 and 2.33. Compound 177 decomposed upon BOC deprotection, meanwhile compound 181 was insoluble in H2O. Since the Phospha-Micheal reaction requires H2O to work, the addition of 50% EtOH to dissolve the starting material hampered the reaction and only SM was recovered after 72 hrs at RT by 31P NMR. No further reactions were carried out with these polyamine scaffolds.

2.2 Catechol QAC Research efforts have also focused on trying to design new types of quats from amino acids (AA) with functional linkers for attachment onto metal oxide surfaces. Since AA's are readily available in bulk at low cost and very biodegradable, QAC's based on AA's and their derivatives were envisioned as cheaper and more environmentally friendly source of antimicrobials in addition to the phosphonate QAC's. The target AA-QAC was anticipated from the dopamine amino acid analogue (L-DOPA) for binding to Ti and SS according to Scheme 2.34. Dopamine derivative 184 was the target starting material, but after problems with N,Ndimethylation of the primary amine resulting in only the tetrahydroisoquinolinone product 185 due to intramolecular cyclization (Scheme 2.34)211, it was decided to start from the commercially available OH derivative 187 and convert it to an alkyl halide 188 via the Appel reaction (Scheme 2.35). Thus, the bromo derivative 188 was quaternized with bromooctadecane but failed to crystallize as pure 189 and was analyzed as a mixture by NMR spectroscopy (1H,
31

(CDCl3), Figure 2.27). No attempt at this time was made at removing the benzyl ethers groups to the target surface active catechol QAC 190.

2.3 Organosulfur Based QAC The thiol group represents another functional group suitable for anchoring antimicrobials onto metals. Replacement of the methoxysilane (SiOMe3) of the commercially available Dow silane antimicrobial with a thiol (S-H) group anchors this QAC to select metal surfaces. The thiol quat forms self-assembled monolayers specifically on Au, Ag, Cu and other suitable metal surfaces while retaining the antimicrobial activity of the quaternary ammonium compound. The possible synthetic routes identified in the literature for the preparation of the thiolQAC largely involve commercially unavailable starting precursors (Scheme 2.36, Route iii) or require multiple preparative steps (Scheme 2.36, Route ia, ii). All of the routes feature a common nucleophilic substitution reaction between an alkylhalide (R-X) and a nitrogen nucleophile. Due to commercial availability of 3-chloropropyl thioacetate 191 and the disulfide 197 routes ib and iv were chosen to prepare the target thiol QAC's 194 and 199. In the thioacetate route, 3-chloropropylthioacetate was quaternized with 2 in high yield (90%) followed by cleavage with KOH/MeOH to give 194 in a 83% yield (Scheme 2.36, Route ia, Figure 2.28). Numerous attempts at obtaining a crystal structure of 194 were unsuccessful.

164

Figure 2.28: 1H NMR (CDCl3) spectra of organosulfur QAC 192 (upper) and 199 (lower). Alternatively, the C2 thiol quat 199 was prepared from the commercially available disulfide. Deprotonation of 197 with NaOMe in EtOH and the subsequent filtering of NaCl yields the free base which was then quaternized in situ with 2 eq. bromooctadecane to 198 in a 80% yield. Cleavage of the disulfide bond was attempted with HCl/Zn and NaBH4/EtOH, but the final product could not be spectroscopically characterized due to difficulties with purification and reformation of the disulfide in open air. The use of triphenyl phosphine to cleave the disulfide 198 was planned, but not pursued at this time (Scheme 2.36, Route iv).

Previous literature describing the first thiol QAC's SAM failed to prepare a stable coating. An ethanolic solution of the thiol was coated onto Au. However, no surface antimicrobial data was reported, only MIC's in solution were reported.118,215 Further work with thiol SAM's was discontinued with greater effort focused on the preparation of organophosphonate QAC's (Section 2.1.2.1-2.1.2.6). 2.4 Benzophenone QAC (Plastic Coating) Based on previous work in our lab on benzophenone QAC 205105, the reaction conditions were optimized under ÂµW heating by shortening the reaction time to 2 min at 150oC compared to 24 hrs reflux (Scheme 2.37). Dansyl benzophenone 214 was also synthesized for fluorescence testing onto plastics. In addition a novel benzophenone QAC with a silane linker 206 was synthesized and tested on polypropylene and nylon (Section 2.6.2.1). Post quaternization, compound 206 showed the characteristic upfield 1H resonances ( = 3.47 ppm, CDCl3) due to the two methyl groups on the quaternary amine and the characteristic silane resonance ( = 3.59 ppm) due to the silane methyl groups Â­SiOMe3 (Figure 2.29).

2.5 Dansyl QAC 2.5.1 Fluorescent Antimicrobial Coating Detection Fluorescence detection of antimicrobial QAC is advantageous over traditional dye based methods (i.e. bromophenol blue) because it allows for easy detection of the Si-QAC once applied by simply irradiating the treated surface with a UV lamp without destructive or permanent binding type testing. Accordingly, three fluorescent dansyl QAC derivatives were synthesized from previously developed procedures in our lab and used in product testing onto different surfaces (see Section 2.7.2).105,177 The compounds, dansylphosphonate 211-212 (metals), dansylsilane 213 (non-porous surfaces), dansyl benzophenone 216 (plastic surfaces) previously synthesized in our lab were prepared on a larger scale via the Menschutkin reaction between dansyl dimethyl obtained from dansyl chloride (Scheme 2.38) and the appropriate alkyl halide (Scheme 2.39). New dansyl derivatives reported herein were prepared in the same fashion and include dansyl isopropyl phosphonate 212, dansyl thioacetate 214 and dansyl -bisphosphonate 215 (Scheme 2.39). All dansyl compounds 211-216, 217 and 219 comprising of a dansyl group and a quaternary amine salt, represent a novel class of H2O soluble fluorescent reporters.

Didealkylation of dansyl QAC diethyl and diisopropyl phosphonate esters 211 and 212 respectively was accomplished in the absence of previous literature describing the dealkylation of such compounds. Herein are presented optimized dealkylation conditions with the appropriate reagents according to Table 2.11. Both TMSBr in DCM (Table 2.11, Entry i) and HX (aq) reagents (Table 2.11, Entries iv-viii) were successful at generating the free phosphonic acid in quantitative yield while leaving the quat group intact. However, in situ generation of TMSBr from TMSCl/LiBr was incompatible with these compounds due to poor solubility of the quat group in ACN (Table 2.11, Entry ii). Of the mineral acids employed under both (ST) (Table 2.11, Entries iv-v and vii-viii) and ÂµW heating (Table 2.11, Entry vi), it was necessary to use aqueous HBr as anhydrous HBr (20% in EtOH) tested intitially with these compounds was significantly slower at cleaving the phosphonate ethyl ester and never reached completion even after prolonged heating (Table 2.11, Entry iii). In aqueous HBr (Table 2.11, Entry iv), the reaction was complete after 2 hrs whereas after 24 hrs of heating in ethanolic HBr (Table 2.11, Entry iii) the reaction was only 71% completed. HBr (aq) (Table 2.11, Entries iv and vii) as expected resulted in faster dealkylation compared to HCl (Table 2.11, Entries vi-vii) and the iPr leaving group (Table 2.11, Entries vii and viii) also resulted in faster dealkylation versus the Et group (Table 2.11, Entries iv and v). Both the HBr and the iPr leaving groups produced more stable intermediates during the course of the reaction and these are supported by the observations in Table 2.11. Compound 217 is the first example of a fluorescent dansyl QA phosphonic acid compound connected through a quaternary ammonium group with excellent solubility in aqueous solution (Figure 2.30).

The thioacetate protected dansyl derivative 214 for binding onto noble metals was also successfully prepared from 208 and the commercially available 3-chloropropylthioacetate. NMR analysis (1H, 13C, CDCl3) spectrum for 214 revealed characteristic hydrogen (1H,  = 2.28 ppm) and carbon resonances (13C,  = 195.80 and  = 30.77 ppm) typical for the thioacetate group. Dansyl acrylamide, 219, was prepared in an analogous fashion to compounds 209-214 by the Menshutkin reaction except by employing the dansyl bromo precusor 210 instead of dansyl

dimethyl 208 and quaternized with the commercially available N,N-dimethylacrylamide derivative 218 (Scheme 2.40). Compound 219 was characterized by (1H, 13C) NMR spectroscopy and showed typical proton resonances corresponding to the acrylamide protons at   6.38 and 6.20 ppm. The 13C NMR spectrum revealed the expected ketone carbon resonance at   166.5 ppm and two new resonances   130.3 and 126.1 ppm due to the vinyl carbons (Figure 2.31). Compound 219 may find use as a solid fluorescent marker additive during the injection molding of plastics.

2.5.2 CO2 Detection-Dansyl Amidine Synthesis of amidine containing dansyl fluorophore 222 was achieved from dansyl amine 221 which was synthesized via the Menschutkin reaction similarly to dansyl QAC's 209-214 described above (Scheme 2.41). The amidine group in 222 was attached according to a procedure from Jessup et al., by employing EtOH instead of THF.216 In a typical amidine synthesis, the condensation of a primary amine with N,N-dimethylacetamide dimethyl acetal yields a mixture of acetamidine and imidate ester depending on the temperature, solvent, and structure of the primary amine. It was possible to suppress the formation of the imidate ester by performing the reaction in the presence of excess dimethyl amine, yielding acetamidine as the exclusive product. The synthesized primary amine 221 (obtained from hydrazine deprotection of 220) was used to
177

prepare amidine 222 in good yield after high vacuum purification. NMR analysis (1H,

CDCl3) spectrum for 222 revealed characteristic amidine hydrogen (1H,  = 2.47,  = 1.83 ppm) and carbon resonances (13C,  = 174.11,  = 50.29 and  = 22.05 ppm, Figure 2.32). In the prescence of CO2, fluorophore 222 underwent a reversible phase change to 223 that could act as a fluorescence reporter for bacterial respiration. It was thought the reversible phase change to 223 would cause fluorescence quenching that would be directly proportional to the rate of CO2 produced by bacterial biofilms. However, no such change was observed with UV-light after 60 min of CO2 bubbling at RT. A H2O soluble fluorophore capable of reporting biofilm CO2 production remains a challenge at this point.

2.5.3 Unsuccessful Dansyl Reactions Attempted deprotection of dansyl thiolacetate 214 to the free thiol 224 with KOH was unsuccessful and the reaction turned from a light yellow to green and finally to a deep purple colour after stirring at RT for 60 min (Figure 2.33). 1H NMR (D2O) analysis of the crude mixture showed a complicated spectrum due to decomposition of the free thiol and disulfide formation. No further attempts to make the free thiol derivative were carried out.

Figure 2.33: Attempted deprotection of dansyl thioacetate 218 to dansyl thiol 212. In addition to thiol fluorophore QAC 224, a dithiocarbamate (DTC) anchored QAC was also targeted as an improved anchor for binding onto metals such as Au, Ag and Cu. The DTC N-C-S2 group forms a resonance structure that allows bidentate coordination to noble metals versus only monodentate coordination for thiol groups. Thus the DTC binding group forms a stronger and more stable monolayer on Au versus the thiol anchor. To the best of my knowledge, no QAC's dithiocarbamate exist in the literature. The synthesis of fluorophore 225 was attempted via the dropwise addition of CS2 to a stirred solution of 221 in methanolic KOH. A precipitate was observed after a few minutes and spectroscopically characterized (Experimental, Section 5.13). From the NMR evidence it was inconclusive whether 225 exists as the bis salt or the internal salt (Figure 2.34, Scheme 2.42).

181

Additionally characterization of 225 by HRMS spectrometry (ESI-TOF) accounted for a mass of (m/z: 469.1760, C21H33N4O2S3) indicative of the internal salt (Figure 2.35).

Lastly, the synthesis of bis -amino phosphonate fluorophore 226 was undertaken from the amine quat 221 (Scheme 2.43), however the reaction resulted in a mixture of unreacted starting material, the monophosphonate, and the desired product in a (0.51:0.71:1.0) ratio by 31P NMR spectroscopy (CDCl3) after 3 d. Purification of the crude reaction mixture of quats was unsuccessful by column chromatography (Figure 2.36).

2.5.3 Fluorescence Properties of Dansyl QAC As expected, all dansyl QAC derivatives analyzed in MeOH exhibited similar fluorescence emission (emission = 525 nm) and absorption spectra (absorption = 340 nm) characteristic of the green-yellow dansyl tag (emission = 525 nm, absorption = 360 nm). Only compound 216 exhibited a different major absorption wavelength at ~300 nm due to the benzophenone group (Figure 2.37). However, in aqeous environments at low pH (0.1 N HCl) fluorescence quenching of the dansyl fluorophore 213 was observed due to protonation of the aromatic N,N-dimethylamine (Figure 2.38). At pH 7 (phosphate buffer) no deviation from the characteristic dansyl fluorescence spectra occured, only as slight decrease in intensity was observed at the same concentration versus analysis in MeOH. At high pH (0.1 N NaOH) absorption was shifted to ~ 310 nm which produced a lower intensity emission at 325 nm when excited at 340 nm (Figure 2.39). Noticable fluorescence quenching was also observed with derivative 220 likely due to  stacking interactions of the phthalimide group and the aromatic amine from the dansyl group (Figure 2.39).

2.6 Characterization and Properties 2.6.1 X-ray Crystallography Four novel crystal structures of 34, 19, 66 and 220 were obtained during the course of this research and are depicted in Figures 2.24, 2.25, 2.26, 2.27. The phosphonic acid quat 34 was re-crystallized using a 80% EtOH/EtOAc mixture, resulting in the isolation of long crystals growing vertically from the solution, representative of the long C18 chain (Figure 2.40). A hydrogen donor and acceptor group found at the end of both 34 and 66 was necessary in the formation of X-ray quality crystals of these long chain molecules (Figure 2.41). Structures with C18 tails are difficult to crystallize and are rare in the literature. In addition to 34, a crystal structure of the C18 QAC intermediate 66 was obtained with a hydroxyl terminal end group instead of a phosphonic acid (Figure 2.42). This compound was recrystallized from ACN by slow evaporation of the solvent at RT, resulting in the isolation of fine, white, prismatic crystals. Compound 66 had been previously reported in the literature, but a crystal structure of this long chain QAC was unknown. Crystals of both 34 and 66 exhibited average carbon-nitrogen bond lengths typical for an ammonium salt (1.499 Ã).217 From the data obtained (see supplementary information) the bond lengths for N(1)-C(23), N(1)-C(22), N(1)-C(4), and N(1)-C(3) were 1.486(8) Ã, 1.505(7) Ã, 1.522(8) Ã, and 1.523(8) Ã respectively. These bond lengths agree with the above mentioned C-NQAC average bond lengths and along with other characterization data (Section 6.0, Appendix 1.1) support the identity of 34 and 66.

Figure 2.43: X-ray crystal structure of 19. Two intermediate compounds 19 and 220 containing phthalimide protecting groups were crystallized and X-ray structures were obtained. The diethylphosphonate intermediate, 19, was
192

crystallized from EtOAc at -20oC, forming square, clear crystals (Figure 2.43). The dansyl phthalimide QAC intermediate 220 was crystallized inside an NMR tube from D2O at RT, forming star shaped, clear crystals. From the crystal structure, a close interaction of the phthalimide group near the dansyl group can be observed (Figure 2.44). This interaction supports the fluorescence quenching data for this compound due to - stacking of the two aromatic rings. The bond lengths and bond angles for all of these compounds are provided (Section 6.0, Appendix 1.1).

2.6.2 Antimicrobial Detection / Coating Procedures

Both non-fluorescent and fluorescent dansyl quats were attached to porous (cotton, SiO2) and non-porous (metals, plastics) by dip coating a given surface in the appropriate compound according to Figure 2.45. The dansyl QAC compounds were visualized under UV light while non-fluorescent QAC's were visualized with bromophenol blue. Coating procedures with examples on plastics and metals are described below.

2.6.2.1 Plastic Surfaces Grafting of non-fluorescent benzophenone compounds 205 and 3 + 205 onto polypropylene (PP) and silicone was performed as follows: plastic samples were cut into rectangles (3.5 Ã 2.5 cm), rinsed with H2O and MeOH and air dried prior to their use. The clean substrates were dipped into a 0.01% (w/v) solution of 214 and irradiated with UV (5 min) and any unbound material was rinsed from the substrates using H2O prior to visualization with bromophenol blue (Figure 2.46). Both PP and silicone surfaces stained a deep blue colour indicating the presence of quats on these plastic surfaces, while the controls remained unstained (Figure 2.47). Dansyl fluorescent compounds were successfully visualized without the bromophenol blue dye. Medical grade silicone tubing coated with 214, silica NP's treated with 211, PP coated with 214, and SS coated with 217 all fluoresced green, indicating their prescence on these surfaces when imaged under UV light (Figure 2.48).

2.6.2.3 Metal Surfaces Preparation of self-assembled monolayers of compound 211 on cotton and silica NP's were prepared by dip coating the samples in 0.01% (w/v) H2O or MeOH solution of 211 ON or until the solvent evaporated, followed by heating (100 oC, 24 hrs) and drying (Figure 2.49). Note a faster procedure was developed by placing the vials into an oven (100 oC) and letting the solvent evaporate (~ 30-60 min) followed by a rinsing step (MeOH) and a short oven cure (100
o

C, 1 hr). Samples prepared in both ways were found to possess the same antimicrobial activity

while uncured samples were inactive.

2.6.3 Antimicrobial Activity

2.6.3.1 Solution Killing: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration's (MIC's) Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) experiments were performed according to standard procedures218 with both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains: S. aureus, Listeria, Salmonella, and E. coli. Solutions of long chain QAC antimicrobials (0.01g/mL or 1%) were dissolved in H2O, inoculated with the test organism and serially diluted from 10-1-10-3, representing a dilution range from (0.01g/mL to 0.00001g/mL), followed by plate counts to determine the MIC values (Figure 2.50). Samples 1-3 were prepared with (1%) solutions of the C18 phosphonic acid QAC 34A obtained from hydrolysis of the phosphonate ester 26 or 27. Sample 1 is compound 34A obtained by TMSBr dealkylation of the ethyl ester (Et, TMSBr), sample 2 is the sodium salt 34B (Na salt) which is freely soluble in H2O and sample 3 is compound 34A obtained by HCl dealkylation of the iPr ester 27 (i-Pr, HCl). Sample 4 which was initially a (1%) solution of 34A used for ON dip coating experiments with Ti metal, is the residual liquid (unknown concentration) after the metal coupon was removed for antimicrobial analysis. Samples 1-3 prepared with 1% starting solutions of 34A exhibited similar MIC values but demonstrated 100 Ã higher efficacy with Listeria and Salmonella and 10 Ã higher efficacy against E. coli compared to the silane QAC 3 (sample 5 and 6) (Figure 2.50). All compounds were inhibitory towards the gram-positive S.aureus bacterium, susceptible to QAC compounds in solution (Figure 2.34). The phosphonate ester 26 (1% in H2O) was also tested for inhibition

201

against S. aureus and was found to be highly inhibitory even at 100 Âµg/mL concentrations (Table 2.12). As expected, sample 4, the retested aqueous phase containing residual 34A performed poorly with Listeria, Salmonella, and E. coli and no inhibition was observed at the starting concentration. This can be explained by the fact the phosphonic acid molecules in solution formed monolayers on the surface to Ti metal thereby decreasing the concentration 10-100 fold. So in fact the starting concentration was closer to a 0.001 Â­ 0.0001 g/mL which after further dilution was no longer inhibitory (Figure 2.50). A stock solution (1%) of the silane quat 3 prepared from the 5% stabilized solution in H2O (SiQAC 3 (stabilized)) or prepared from the 72% concentrate in MeOH and diluted to 1% in H2O (SiQAC 3 (no stabilizer)) worked extremely well (Figure 2.50). All bacterial strains tested with these samples were inhibited at concentrations up 100 Âµg/mL which is in close agreement agreement with literature MIC values (84 Âµg/mL).61

Solutions of QAC samples were prepared in H2O starting at 1mg/mL or 1% and diluted up 103.

2.6.3.2 Contact Killing on Hard Surfaces Antimicrobial activity of phosphonate QAC coatings and the silane QAC 3 for comparison purposes were prepared on metal surfaces (Ti, SS, Al) and tested by growth enumeration in the dry state testing method developed in the Wolfaardt lab against various strains of bacteria. Intially, 1% solutions of compound 34A were electrosprayed in triplicate onto (Ti, SS, Al) and cured overnight at 120oC. However, no significant bacterial reduction was observed and the electrosprayed metal coupons were indistinguishable to the unsprayed controls (results not shown). Ti samples prepared by an overnight immersion in an aqueous or ethanolic solution of compound 34A followed by an overnight cure at 100oC showed promising results versus uncured samples. Ti samples were coated with compound 34A obtained by either TMSBr dealkylation of the ethyl ester (Et, TMSBr) or of the iPr ester by the HCl method (iPr, HCl). In both cases the 31P NMR spectrum were identical, however, 34A prepared by the TMSBr method was only slightly soluble in H2O and was tested in ethanol, while 34A prepared by the HCl method was tested in H2O at 10 mg/mL. S. aureus and Salmonella inoculated antimicrobial Ti surfaces were sampled after 3 hrs of drying and showed 99-100% reduction in viable bacteria versus the controls and uncured surfaces (Figure 2.51).

205

Blue rectangles = control untreated Ti, Red rectangles = compound 34A coated Ti ( obtained from dealkylation of the iPr ester with HCl), Green = compound 34A coated Ti (obtained from dealkylation of the ethyl ester with TMSBr)

After success with compound 34A on Ti, other organophosphorus QAC's including the ester 26, trimethylammnoium 35, pyridinium 36 as well as the silane quat SiQAC 3 on Ti were evaluated against a strain of P.aeroguinosa (PAO1) known for its robust survival on dry surfaces. Only compounds 26 and 34A showed a significant reduction of bacterial colonies after 4 hrs of sampling while the shorter chain phosphonic acid QAC's 35, 36 and the silane QAC 3 were indistinguishable from control samples (results not shown). As a result, no further sampling was performed on these surfaces. Instead the active compounds 26 and 34A were used to coat other metals SS, Al along with Ti and these surfaces were tested with other bacterial strains. Contact killing was observed immediately with compounds 26 and 34A on all surfaces tested (Ti, SS, Al). After 2 hrs these antimicrobial coatings had killed all of the cells initially dried on each surface (106 bacterial cells, Table 2.13 for Arthrobacter, Table 2.14 for PAO1).
206

Control samples without such coatings showed some bacterial reduction but only after extended periods of time. Typically, 24 hrs were required to reduce the bacterial surface population from 106 cells to 105-103 depending on the surface of the controls (Table 2.13). Aluminum control surfaces showed the largest reduction of PAO1 by a factor of 103 after 24 hrs while their survival was highest on SS with 105 cells remaining after 24 hrs. Such reductions are typical over time on surfaces with limited nutrients necessary for bacterial survival and reproduction. From these observations, the phospholipid sponge mechanism is believed to be responsible for the rapid contact killing with the longer chain QAC's. These monolayer forming organophosphorus antimicrobials required both a quat and a long hydrophobic tail to effectively remove bacterial phospholipids when in close proximity to the cells whereas QAC's without a long hydrophobic chain such as 35 and 36 were completely inactive even though they contained the same number of ammonium (N+) charges on the surface.

Surfaces treated with compound 34A (Table 2.13, Entries i-iii) were further tested to determine if antimicrobial activity was retained. Samples stored in saline for 24 hrs from the first antimicrobial trial were removed, dried, washed in distilled H2O, dried, re-innoculated and then retested. All samples from the second trial showed similar Anthrobacter colony reductions (106 to 0) indicating the molecule was truly immobilized (Table 2.15). The effectiveness of the antimicrobial Ti treated with 34A to withstand Anthrobacter colonization was also demonsrated on agar. The control samples were fully colonized by the bacterium, while the antimicrobial treated Ti sample, effectively killed Anthrobacter on contact and no colonies were observed around the metal coupons (Figure 2.52).

The amount of bacteria intitially dried on the metal surfaces tested was determined by serial dilutions and agar plate counts until a countable amount of colonies was observed. For example after six dilutions of the original stock of bacteria applied to Ti and SS, 58 colonies were counted at the beginning of sampling (T = 0) which corresponds to a concentration of ~ 106 cells (Table 2.16, 2.17).

3.0 CONCLUSION Water soluble quats with anchors specific for forming monolayers onto porous (([C18H37NH-(CH2)3-NMe2-R+][Cl-] (3; anchor = -Si(OMe)3) and non-porous metal oxide (Ti, SS, Al) (([C18H37-NH-(CH2)3-NMe2-R+][Cl-] (26; anchor = -PO(OEt)2, 34; -PO(OH)2) and plastic surfaces (silicones, PP) (([C18H37-NH-(CH2)4-NMe2-R+][Br-] (205; anchor = -benzophenone), ([benzophenone-NH-(CH2)3-NMe2-R+][X-] (206; R = -Si(OMe)3, X- = Cl-) were synthesized by the Menschutkin reaction and used to prepare antimicrobial coating on these surfaces. New compounds were successfully characterized by NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 29Si, and 31P where required), HRMS spectroscopy and in a few instances by X-ray crystallography (34, 66, 19, 220). Improvements in the synthesis of the organosilane chloride 3, QA antimicrobial by the

approved

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) was performed both under solventless (72 hrs, 100oC, 80%) and solvent (MeOH, 48 hrs, 76%) conditions in a sealed tube (ST), as well as with ÂµW radiation in MeOH (45 min, 150oC, 58%). In all cases, the reaction never reached full conversion even after prolonged heating. Various monodentate organophosphorus phosphonates and phosphonic acid QAC's 3437 with short and long chains were successfully synthesized and used to prepare antimicrobial surfaces on Ti, SS and Al. The didealkylation of phosphoate QAC's was explored for the first time under ÂµW heating and proved to be extremely effective and rapid with the following reagents; TMSBr (ACN, 10 min, 60Â°C) , HCl (3 M, 30 min, 150Â°C) or HBr (3 N, 10 min, 150Â°C). Three bisphosphonate QAC's 93, 121 and 140 were also prepared but their dealkylation to the corresponding phosphonic acids 96, 126, 141 was unsuccessful using either HBr or
211

TMSBr due to insolubility of the formed products in H2O and organic solvents. Other multidentate phosphonic acid quats were targeted (161, 168, 179, 183) but their synthesis was unsuccessful based on the synthetic schemes attempted. Novel thiol and catechol QAC's 194 and 189 were synthesized, both of which require further testing on metal surfaces. Various new quaternary ammonium dansyl containing compounds with both alkoxysilane 213, phosphonate 211-212, 217, thiolacetate 214, acrylamide 219, were similarly prepared and evaluated as potential fluorescent probes in antimicrobial coatings. Physical attachment of dansyl silane 213 to SiO2 nanoparticles (NP's) and cotton surfaces after immersion in solutions containing the fluorescent dye was verified by exposure to UV light and by complexation with bromophenol blue that rendered the surfaces visibly blue in colour. Plastic surfaces (PP, silicon medical tubing) were UV cured with dansyl benzophenone 216 and resulted in the physical attachment of the dye visualized by UV light. Dansyl phosphonic acid, 217, was attached to a stainless steel surface by exposure to an aqueous solution containing this dye, followed by a thermal cure (100Â°C, ON) resulting in the formation of a self-assembled fluorescent monolayer. Synthesis of a C18 benzophenone QAC 205 was improved with ÂµW heating by lowering the reaction time to 2 min vs. an ON reflux in ACN. A new benzophenone QAC with a silane linker 206 was made and successfully visualized with bromophenol blue on PP and silicone surfaces with bromophenol blue. Antimicrobial activity of 205 and 206 on plastic surfaces remains to be tested. A dansyl amidine probe 222 prepared from dansyl amine 221 was expected to find use in the detection of microbial respiration CO2, however, no change in fluorescence was observed after exposure to CO2. Presence of non-fluorescent antimicrobial QAC coatings on surfaces was successfully detected using the bromophenol blue test. Antimicrobial activity was tested in solution by MIC
212

determinations and in the solid state (metal surfaces only, Ti, SS, Al) by growth enumeration in the dry state. SiQAC 3 was found to be the most biocidal in solution with an MIC of ~ 100 Âµg/g which is in close agreement to the literature value of 80 Âµg/g. Compounds 26 and 34 on the other hand were more biocidal on metal oxide surfaces and were capable of reducing initial concentrations of Salmonella, Arthrobacter, S. aureus and P. aeroguinosa by a factor of 106 (100%) after a contact time of 2 hrs and maintained their activity after 24 hrs. Re-testing the same active antimicrobial Ti surfaces after 3 weeks with another challenge of bacteria was performed and was also successful. Identical reductions in Arthrobacter colonies after a contact time of 2 hrs were observed 106 cells  0 cells (100%). These antimicrobial surfaces are believed to kill bacteria on contact because their MIC's are higher in solution compared to compound 3 and the monolayer concentrations of 26 and 34 are too small to effectively kill 106 cells if these surfaces released the antimicrobial upon testing.

4.0 FUTURE WORK Another possibility to improving the commercial synthesis of the Dow antimicrobial (SiQAC, 3) which utilizes the unreactive chlorosilane 1 (see Section 2.1.1), would entail the addition of a catalytic or stoichiometric amount of NaI or LiBr for a onepot Finkelstein / Menschutkin reaction. This would lead the the in situ formation of the more reactive iodo or bromosilane and would allow for shorter reaction times and complete conversion to the quat, previously impossible with the chlorosilane (Scheme 4.1 A). Alternatively the

Finkelstein/Menschutkin reaction could be performed sequentially with isolation of the iodosilane and the quaternization with dimethyloctadecylamine (Scheme 4.1 B).

The next generation of QA antimicrobials would be capable of binding to every possible surface (eg. both porous and non-porous: metal and plastic surfaces). Synthesis of a universal surface antimicrobial with multiple functional anchors is attractive with the commercially available polymer (Scheme 4.5). Different anchor groups including: silane, phosphonate, catechol and benzophenone groups could potentially be quaternized onto the polymer backbone. Dual cleavage of the catechol, and phosphonate groups may be achieved with BBr3 if desired. Alternatively, a series of diallyl monomers with different anchors can be co-polymerized to create multifunctional polymer coatings (Scheme 4.6).

VIS and fluorescence measurements were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Spectrophotometer (Lambda 20) at the Ryerson University Analytical Centre (RUAC). High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded by direct analysis in real time by DART-TOF or by electrospray time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) at the Advanced Instrumentation for Molecular Structure (AIMS) laboratory at the University of Toronto. X-ray crystal structure analysis was performed with a Bruker-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer at the University of Toronto X-ray facilities. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Silica gel 60 aluminum backed plates and visualized with a UV lamp or staining with (KMnO4 or ninhydrin). Melting points were measured using a Fischer Scientific melting point apparatus. All prepared intermediates and compounds were stored in glass vials at RT while the dansyl derivatives were stored in the dark at RT. 5.2 General Procedures Method 5.2.1 Sealed Tube Reactions The appropriate reactants were placed, along with a magnetic stirring bar, into a 20 mL glass scintillation vial and sealed with a screw cap. The reaction mixture was heated using an oil or sand bath at the indicated time and temperature. The reaction was transferred to a round bottom flask, and volatiles removed on a rotary evaporator and the crude material purified either by distillation, Dry Column Vacuum Chromatography (DCVC) on silica gel or crystallization as indicated. In the case of dansyl derivatives, Et2O was added directly to the reaction mixture followed by decanting (repeat Et2O wash Ã 2) and drying under high vaccum.

N1,N1-bis(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-N2,N2-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine (44):199 This compound was made by a modification of the literature procedure199 by employing

paraformaldehyde and anydrous HCl. ACN (200 mL) was added to a 500 mL RBF containing tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (7.3115 g, 50 mmol) and paraformaldehyde (10 g, 333 mmol, 6.66 eq.) followed by formic acid (17 mL, 295 mmol, 5.9 eq.) at RT, and the mixture was refluxed for 3 hrs. The mixture was then cooled to RT, placed on ice and anydrous HCl (2 N in EtOH/IPA, 100 mL) was added, and a white precipitate was isolated. The residual solid was diluted with MeOH (200 mL), filtered through a Buchner funnel and washed twice with MeOH (2 Ã 100 mL) to give tris (N,N-dimethyl-2-aminoethyl)amine hydrochloride as a yellow/white solid (12 g, 70%). Next, tris (N,N-dimethyl-2-aminoethyl)- amine hydrochloride (2.0 g, 6.89 mmol) was added slowly to 50 mL of an ethanolic solution containing NaOEt (1.4g, 20.67 mmol), and stirred at RT for 1 hr. The mixture was filtered through Celite, evaporated in vacuo, CHCl3 was added to the residue, and the solution was filtered to remove more of the inorganic precipitate (NaCl). The evaporation of the solvent on a Schlenk line gave the title compound as a brown liquid. Yield: 65% (7.49 g); 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ): 3.28-3.19 (m, 6H, H3), 2.98-2.85 (m, 6H, H2), 2.81 (s, 18H, H1) ppm.
