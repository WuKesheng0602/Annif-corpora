R2 report (Study of the North American MARC records marketplace, R2 Consulting)

"Cataloguers have an almost unstoppable urge to improve, tweak, customize and "localize" national-level records; redundant work is still widespread"
}

Connie McGuire, Vicki Dillon (Univ. Michigan)

"Corrections [to records] are not made when the errors do not affect access"

}

Quality issues: accuracy, completeness Compatibility issues: display of diacritics Access issues: Do the records add access value to the resources described? Workload issues: how much editing/updating will be required? How will it be accomplished and who will do it?

From: http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/marc_batch/index.htm "Libraries can currently import the Legislative Library's MARC records individually using the Z39.50 protocol for importing bibliographic records."  (http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/z3950.htm ) "The batch MARC records batch service expands this current record-by-record service, enabling libraries to import MARC records directly into their own integrated library systems. These records include permanent links to the publications stored in the Legislative Library's electronic publications collection." "The MARC records available for import are based on the current issues of the British Columbia Government Monthly Checklist found at the Legislative Library's online catalogue site."
