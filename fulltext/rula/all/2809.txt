ABSTRACT  

   INVOLVING  PRIVATE  SECTOR  DEVELOPERS:  BUILDING  AFFORDABLE  RENTAL   HOUSING  IN  THE  CITY  OF  TORONTO   Andrew  Cohrs  (Masters  of  Planning  in  Urban  Development,  Ryerson  University,  2014)   This  research  makes  the  argument  for  increasing  private  sector  participation  in   affordable  housing  development  in  the  City  of  Toronto.  It  explores  the  demand  for   affordable  rental  housing  in  Toronto,  examines  the  national,  provincial  and  municipal   legislative  situation  affecting  Toronto  and  demonstrates  the  potential  for  the   municipality  of  Toronto  to  update  and  implement  policies  to  produce  more  affordable   housing  with  private  sector  developers.  Policies  used  across  Canada  and  the  United   States  to  encourage  or  require  affordable  housing  contributions  from  private  sector   developers  are  explored  and  case  studies  of  Vancouver,  Montreal  and  San  Francisco   highlight  how  municipalities  facing  similar  housing  pressures  have  attempted  to   address  their  situations.  Interviews  with  key  stakeholders  contributed  Toronto-specific   ideas  regarding  private  sector  involvement  in  the  construction  of  affordable  rental   housing  as  well  as  the  accompanying  policies  that  have  potential  in  Toronto.  Actions   and  policies  are  recommended  for  the  consideration  of  the  Toronto  municipal   government.

INTRODUCTION  

Toronto  is  currently  suffering  from  a  shortage  of  affordable  housing  options.  Specifically,   the  decline  of  affordable  rental  housing  construction  and  availability  coupled  with  rising   land  values  is  a  result  of  a  systemic  problem  in  the  way  the  municipality  and  private  sector   are  able  to  provide  a  full  range  of  housing  options  to  its  residents.  As  the  City  of  Toronto   states:   Tackling  the  lack  of  affordable  housing  is  a  city-wide  issue.  Households  living   in  unaffordable  or  unsuitable  housing  are  found  in  every  corner  and   neighbourhood  of  Toronto.  One  in  five  Toronto  residents  live  in  housing  they   cannot  afford,  that  is  too  small  for  their  needs,  or  that  requires  significant   repair.  (2013)      Federal,  provincial  and  municipal  policies  all  play  a  part  in  the  regulation  of  the  Canadian   housing  system.  As  well,  the  development  process  plays  a  key  role,  which,  in  Toronto,  is   currently  struggling  to  encourage  private  sector  developers  to  be  involved  in  the   construction  of  affordable  rental  housing.  While  increased  upper-level  government  support   and  funding  is  required,  it  is  also  important  for  municipal  policy  to  involve  private  sector,   for-profit  developers  to  contribute  to  producing  a  diverse  and  economically  accessible   housing  stock  in  Toronto.      Affordable  housing  in  cities  is  essential.  There  is  a  demonstrated  need  for  housing  that  is   affordable  to  all  residents  and  levels  of  income.  In  "Fixing  Canada's  Housing  Crunch"   (2013),  the  Federation  of  Canadian  Municipalities  lists  compelling  data.  One  in  four   Canadians  spend  over  30%  of  their  income  on  housing  and  while  average  home  prices  have   risen  67%,  household  income  in  the  same  period  only  rose  13%  (FCM  2013).  "The  high  cost   of  housing  is  Canadians'  most  urgent  financial  issue,  and  the  single  biggest  risk  to  our   national  economy"  (FCM  2013).  Another  important  consideration  is  that  while  one  third  of   Canadians  are  renters,  only  10%  of  new  construction  has  been  purpose-built  rental  (FCM   2013).  However,  as  noted  below,  many  renters  in  Toronto  obtain  shelter  through  non- purpose  built  rental  properties,  such  as  condominiums  or  basement  suites.

The  benefits  of  affordable  housing  are  numerous.  There  are  both  financial  and  social  costs   to  not  having  an  affordable  housing  stock.  The  cost  of  homelessness  is  frequently  cited  as  a   major  reason  to  invest  in  housing.  A  2001  report  suggested  that,  annually,  it  cost  $30,000   to  $40,000  per  homeless  person,  to  offer  shelter  based  housing  services  (BC  Ministry  of   Social  Development  and  Economic  Security  2007,  4).  That  number  continues  to  be  cited   frequently  across  North  America  (Laird  2007,  87).  However,  it  only  costs  $13,000  -  $18,000   annually  per  person  to  cover  supportive  and  transitional  housing  costs  (Lewchuk  2013).   Essentially,  it  requires  less  government  dollars  to  address  housing  shortages  than  it  does  to   support  homeless  shelters.  Investing  in  housing  also  has  a  multiplier  effect  that  stimulates   the  economy.  Every  dollar  invested  in  housing  results  in  $1.40  of  benefits  to  the  Canadian   economy  (Lewchuck  2013  and  Department  of  Finance  2010).        The  social  benefits  of  affordable  housing,  such  as  improved  health  and  crime  reduction,  are   also  important  to  note.    "In  general,  research  supports  the  view  that  ...  stable  housing   bring[s]  substantial  social  benefits.  Because  of  these  extensive  social  benefits  -  what   economists  call  positive  externalities  -  government  assistance  and  subsidies  for  the   housing  industry  are  well  justified"  (National  Association  of  Realtors  2012,  2).  In  February   2014,  the  FCM  released  a  statement  asserting,  "The  national  housing  crunch  and  traffic   gridlock  are  holding  our  cities  back".      While  developers  are  running  a  business  and  seek  to  make  a  profit  on  their  projects,  there   is  much  room  for  the  business  and  development  communities  to  take  an  active  roll  with   affordable  housing.  But  why  should  private  developers  care?  The  answer  is  simple,  and   speaks  to  the  fact  that  they  have  typically  stayed  away  from  affordable  housing  Â­  they  don't   need  to.  However,  it  is  in  their  interest  to  get  involved  in  projects  that  can  create  returns  as   predictably  and  as  quickly  as  possible.  Affordable  housing  construction  can  provide  just   that.  The  relationship  between  developer,  municipality  and  a  not-for-profit  housing   provider  is  interdependent,  and  if  done  correctly,  can  produce  results  that  each  party   desires.  Ideally,  developers  can  access  capital  and  a  quicker,  cheaper  development  process   if  they  are  partnered  with  a  not-for-profit  (reduced  development  charges  or  fast  track   approvals,  for  example).  Not-for  profit  organizations  need  developers'  expertise  and         2

efficiency  in  constructing  buildings.  Finally,  if  municipal  policies  and  taxes  are  favourable  to   this  idea,  municipalities  can  then  gain  the  desired  housing  stock.

THE  CASE  FOR  PRIVATE  SECTOR  PARTICIPATION  IN  AFFORDABLE   RENTAL  HOUSING  
From  the  outset,  renters,  as  well  as  purpose-built  rental  housing  providers,  are   disadvantaged.  Canadian  federal  policy  has,  since  its  involvement  with  housing,  been   focused  on  homeownership  and  the  country's  housing  system  "almost  exclusively,  relies  on   the  market  mechanism"  (Hulchanski  2002,  5).  Data  from  the  2011  National  Household   Survey  shows  that  69%,  or  9.2  of  13.3  million  households  in  Canada,  owned  their  dwelling   (Statistics  Canada  2011).  Ontario  has  slightly  higher  rates  of  ownership  which  were   reported  to  be  over  71%  (Ministry  of  Finance,  2009)  As  the  majority  of  Canadians  are   homeowners,  they  have  more  power  and  are  able  to  voice  opinions  to  governments   through,  for  example,  strong  lobby  groups  and  sympathetic  ministers  (Hulchanski  2003,  8).   That  said,  the  benefits  to  homeownership,  in  terms  of  long-term  family  financial  stability   and  place  making  (i.e.  community  involvement,  pride  in  one's  dwelling),  among  other   assets,  should  be  acknowledged.  Owners  vote,  renters  do  not.  In  "The  Homevoter   Hypothesisis",  Fischel  (2005)  corroborates  this  idea  by  stating  that  "nearly  every  study  has   shown  that  renters  participate  in  local  affairs  in  disproportionally  low  numbers  compared   to  homeowners"  (80).  In  Toronto,  this  rings  true:   Toronto  tenants  have  had  limited  municipal  voting  rights  since  at  least  1850,   but  they  didn't  get  full  rights  -  equal  to  those  of  homeowners  -  until  1972.  And   they  still  don't  exercise  their  voting  rights  as  often  as  homeowners  do...  in   municipal  elections,  homeowners  vote  in  twice  the  numbers  that  renters  do.   There's  a  political  adage  that  "a  homeowner's  vote  is  worth  two  of  a  tenant,"   said  Jack  Layton.  (Gillespie  2001)      However,  this  does  not  take  away  from  the  need  to  provide  rental  housing  that  is   affordable.  While  owning  a  home  has  been  shown  to  be  linked  to  positive  neighbourhood   development  and  long-term  household  economics  (National  Association  of  Realtors  2012,   2),  there  is  still  much  value  in  providing  affordable  rental  housing.  Rental  housing  is   essential  for  providing  residents  with  the  ability  and  flexibility  to  have  adequate  shelter,   according  to  their  needs  and  ability.

The  rental  sector  plays  a  critically  important  role  in  Canada's  housing  system.   Reflecting  transitions  in  life,  many  tenants  are  young,  creating  new  tenant   households  when  they  leave  the  family  home.  Others  are  older,  seeking   apartment  living  when  they  no  longer  need  or  want  to  maintain  larger  family   homes.  Similarly,  immigrant  households,  a  critical  component  of  labour   market  supply,  initially  rent  before  they  transition  to  ownership.  (FCM  2012,   6)   For  many  low-income  households,  homeownership  is  simply  out  of  the  question,  at  least  in   the  short-term.  While  conditions  have  changed  since  the  report,  the  1999  Mayor's   Homelessness  Taskforce  Report  "Taking  Responsibility  for  Homelessness:  An  Action  Plan   for  Toronto"  stated  that  "affordable  rental  housing  is  a  cornerstone  in  building  stability  and   quality  of  life"  and  that  "affordable  rental  housing  and  preserving  existing  low-cost  rental   housing  are  the  key  to  preventing  and  reducing  homelessness"  (Task  Force  1999,  125  &   135).      In  Canada,  the  capital  gains  tax,  introduced  in  1972,  provides  a  compelling  example  of   homeowner  bias.  The  tax  levies  charges  on  the  financial  gain  from  the  sale  of  property,   among  other  categories  (i.e.  the  value  increase),  however,  owner  occupied  homes  were  and   continue  to  be  exempt,  forgoing  a  massive  revenue  source  for  the  federal  government.  The   tax  is  regressive  and  discriminatory  due  to  the  individuals  (renters)  not  able  to  benefit   from  the  deduction.  However,  it  does  incentivize  homeownership.  RRSP  (registered   retirement  savings  plan)  policies,  through  the  Home  Buyers'  Plan,  also  provide  another   benefit  to  homeowners  and  not  renters.  In  1992,  in  response  to  pressure  on  the   government  to  address  a  construction  slump  the  federal  government  introduced  the  Home   Buyers  Plan.  The  Finance  Minister,  Don  Mazankowski,  admitted  that  the  Home  Buyers'  Plan   "responds  to  requests  from  industry  groups,  provincial  governments  and  individuals"  and   that  it  "will  support  strong  growth  in  the  housing  sector  this  year."  (Hulchanski  2003,  23).   The  same  budget  cut  social  housing  and  terminated  the  co-op  housing  program.  By  the  next   budget,  all  social  housing  supply  programs  were  terminated  (Hulachanski  2003,  23).  These   examples  demonstrate  the  privilege  given  to  homeownership,  the  focus  of  federal  policy  as   well  as  the  type  of  political  sway  that  can  occur.

We  are  the  inheritors  of  a  nasty  and  pervasive  property  bias  in  our  society   with  roots  that  run  deep,  just  as  other  strong  biases  of  gender,  race,  and   nationality  still  do  in  spite  of  our  efforts  to  outlaw  them.  Our  institutions  and   practices  continue  to  embody  and  perpetuate  the  property  bias,  particularly   in  the  tax  system--in  the  subsidies  given  to  owners  but  denied  to  renters  and   in  many  of  the  property  tax  laws  that  deny  that  renters  are  stakeholders  in   their  communities.  The  celebration  of  homeownership  ...  stigmatizes  those   who  don't,  can't,  or  won't  buy  property.  What  is  needed,  it  seems,  is  a  civil   rights  movement  for  renters.  (Krueckeberg  1999,  26)      While  homeownership,  and  affordable  homeownership  for  that  matter,  are  very  important   pieces  to  the  overall  affordability  issue,  affordable  rentership  is  just  as  critical  (City  of   Vancouver  2012b).  Canadian  housing  policy  systematically  favours  homeownership,  for   both  good  reasons  as  well  as  political  reasons  tied  to  the  strong  voting  power  of   homeowners  Â­  two  thirds  of  Canadians  (Hulchanski  2003,  5).  Continuing,  The  Ontario   Ministry  of  Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing  (2011),  Carter  (2013)  and  the  City  of  Vancouver   (2012b)  identify  a  "Housing  Continuum"  that  illustrates  the  different  roles  for  a  spectrum   of  housing  types.  The  continuum  identifies  "market  affordable  rental"  and  "market   affordable  ownership"  as  having  government  "incentives  to  build  or  purchase"  provided  in   order  to  encourage  this  type  of  housing.  This  illustrates  the  space  within  which  this   research  focuses  and  helps  to  represent  where  affordable  homeownership  has  received   more  favourable  policy  and  funding,  as  described  above.                                          6

As  a  result  of  the  pervasive  bias  to  homeownership  in  public  policy,  the  built  form  in   Toronto  has  left  gaps  in  the  housing  continuum.  In  attempts  to  address  affordability  issues,   private,  for-profit  developers  are  being  increasingly  solicited  to  incorporate  affordable   housing  in  their  developments,  especially  in  major  urban  centres  like  Toronto.  They  have   the  expertise  and  efficiency  to  construct  housing.    There  is  a  demonstrated  need  for  private   sector  developers  to  get  involved  as  over  95%  of  Canadian  households  obtain  their   accommodation  from  the  private  market  and  Canada  is  home  to  the  second  smallest  social   housing  sector  in  all  Western  nations  (Hulchanski  2003,  3).  Given  this  situation,  the  market   (i.e.  private  developers)  need  to  be  more  engaged  in  this  process.  However,  as  private   sector  developers  disclosed  during  interviews  for  this  research,  barriers  exist  that  make   participating  in  affordable,  purpose  built  rental  housing,  even  market  rental,  for  that   matter,  not  economically  viable.  Compounded  by  the  government's  decision  to  not  make   affordable  housing  a  priority,  municipalities  have  been  lobbying  upper-level  governments   or  considering  implementing  policy  changes  themselves,  that  allow  cities  to  take  advantage   of  the  benefits  associated  with  private  sector-development  (Affordable  Housing  Committee   2009,  36).  Some  of  this  is  already  occurring.  The  Federation  of  Canadian  Municipalities,   through  their  campaign  "Fixing  Canada's  Housing  Crunch"  has  had  181  municipalities  sign   a  resolution  asking  the  federal  government  to  develop  a  "new  Long-Term  Federal  Plan  to   Fix  Canada's  Housing  Crunch"  which  includes  acknowledging  that  "housing  costs...are   undermining  Canadians'  personal  financial  security...[that]  those  who  cannot  afford  to   purchase  a  home  rely  on  the  short  supply  of  rental  units...and  coordinated  action  is   required  to  prevent  housing  issues  from  being  offloaded  onto  local  governments"  (FCM   2013).   It  is  the  intention  of  this  research  paper  to  suggest  the  ways  in  which  this  type  of   participation  and  interaction  can  be  coordinated.  On  a  city-wide  scale,  a  cooperative   relationship  needs  to  be  fostered  Â­  private  and  public  sectors  Â­  together,  with  separate   goals  (service  &  profit),  to  address  affordable  housing  shortages.

RESEARCH  QUESTION  
This  research  is  timely  and  poignant.  Planners,  developers  and  city  officials  should  evaluate   the  potential  of  strategies  that  involve  private  sector  developers  in  order  to  help  address   the  continuing  disparity  between  the  need  for,  and  availability  of  affordable  rental  housing   in  the  City  of  Toronto.  The  main  question  of  this  research  is:  How  can  the  City  of  Toronto   encourage  private  sector  participation  in  order  to  construct  more  affordable  rental   housing?  What  tools  and  strategies  (financial,  policy  or  otherwise)  can  be  employed  to   promote,  encourage,  incentivize  or  require  affordable  rental  housing  construction?  In  the   absence  of  adequate  upper-level  government  policy  and  funding,  what  can  be  done  at  the   local  level?  Both  government  and  private  sector  roles  and  responsibilities  will  be  discussed.   The  research  will  focus  on  what  financial  tools,  programs  or  strategies  can  help  or  be   provided  to  developers  in  order  to  incorporate  affordable  housing  into  their  developments.   How  can  development  barriers  to  for-profit  developers  be  addressed?  What  are  the   partnerships,  policies  or  regulations  that  contribute  to  the  creation  of  affordable  rental   housing  development?  What  policies  or  tools,  such  as  inclusionary  zoning,  have  been   successful  in  addressing  affordable  housing  needs?  This  research  is  about  starting  a   dialogue  to  foster  cooperation  and  recommend  policies  and  strategies  that  make  the   development  process  more  effective  at  creating  affordable  housing  while  keeping  on  an  eye   on  the  economic  impact  of  policy  decisions.      At  the  core,  housing  is  a  major  concern  and  focus  of  planning.  In  contentious  urban  spaces,   where  land  use  continues  to  become  controversial  and  intensive,  having  a  diverse  housing   stock  that  is  accessible  to  people  of  all  levels  of  income  is  paramount.  However,  it  can  prove   to  be  a  very  difficult  task.  The  provision,  availability  and  creation  of  affordable  rental   housing  should  therefore  be  of  concern  to  planners  interested  in  contributing  to  the   positive  development  and  redevelopment  of  urban  centres  Â­  whether  it  be  through  further   regulation,  deregulation  or  the  introduction  of  incentives.  Similarly,  as  Toronto  grows,   there  is  less  available  new  land  for  developments,  and  planners  and  developers,  alike,  must   therefore  give  specific  consideration  to  the  ability  of  urban  centres  to  house  all  citizens,   regardless  of  life  stage  or  socio-economic  status.  Where,  how  and  in  what  situation  people         9

METHODOLOGY  
This  research  describes  and  explains  the  potential  role  of  public  policy  in  encouraging,   incentivizing  or  requiring  the  private  sector,  for-profit  developers  to  contribute  to   affordable  rental  housing  shortages  in  Toronto.  It  also  explains  the  importance  of   affordable  rental  housing  as  part  of  a  complete  housing  system.  Incentives,  whether   policies  or  financial  tools,  that  promote  increased  affordable  housing  production  are   reviewed  and  assessed.    A  mixed-method  approach  is  used  to  answer  this  main  research   question  and  to  address  accompanying  sub-themes.  This  means  that  both  qualitative  and   quantitative  measures  are  employed.  Quantitative  data  will  be  used  to  illustrate,  support  or   provide  a  counter-argument  to  qualitative  statements  and  research  and  vice  versa.   Qualitative  and  quantitative  research  complement  each  other  and  therefore,  stronger,  more   compelling  results  can  be  achieved.  A  combination  of  sources  is  incorporated:  a  targeted   literature  review,  data  collection,  case  studies,  interviews  with  private  developers  and   urban  planners  and  policy  review  provides  and  informs  the  research.      To  set  the  context  of  the  study,  the  research  design  first  involves  the  review  of  existing   academic  literature  about  affordable  housing  and  includes  themes  ranging  from  the  history   of  federal  policy  and  eventual  entrenchment  to  the  current  legislative  context  to  Toronto- specific  development  issues.  This  background  provides  the  theoretical  basis  of  the  research   and  provides  needed  context  concerning  federal,  provincial  and  municipal  strategies  and   funding.  Current  publications  offering  analysis  on  Toronto's  development  process,  data  and   issues  provide  the  place-specific  context  that  the  research  requires.  This  review  identifies   concepts,  background,  current  trends,  and  potential  avenues  to  incentivize  private  sector   participation  in  affordable  rental  housing  production.        From  an  understanding  of  both  the  affordable  housing  background  and  Toronto   development  particularities,  a  set  of  alternative  policies  and  strategies  are  identified.  An   exploration  of  these  potential  tools  explains  how  they  function,  how  they  are  implemented   and  the  way  in  which  they  are  targeted  towards  private  sector  participation  in  building   affordable  rental  housing.           11

   To  illustrate  prospective  tools,  case  studies  from  Vancouver,  Montreal  and  the  San   Francisco  will  demonstrate  real-world,  empirical  examples  of  policies.  While  the  location  of   this  research  focuses  on  the  City  of  Toronto,  case  studies  in  other  similarly  sized  and   situated  urban  centres,  will  contextualize  potential  strategies.  The  research  attempts  to   identify  municipal  development  policies  and  tools  that  can  encourage  affordable  rental   housing  to  provide  examples  of  planning  practice  and  "on  the  ground"  practicalities.  These   case  studies  are  used  to  make  evidence-based  decisions  to  understand  and  suggest   practical  and  applicable  potential  strategies.        This  is  where  most  research  on  this  topic  stops.  As  part  of  this  research  design,  interviews   are  conducted  to  garner  public  and  private  sector  opinions  about  the  provision  of   affordable  rental  housing  in  Toronto.    The  interviews  involve  private-sector  developers,   not-for-profit  housing  providers  and  the  Affordable  Housing  Office  at  the  City  of  Toronto.   This  diverse  participant  group  adds  a  more  complete  and  practical  understanding  of  the   research  due  to  the  diversity  of  participants'  occupation  and  viewpoints.  Interviews   provide  insight  to  the  particularities  of  development  in  Toronto  and  shed  light  on  the   potential  tools  that  could  be  introduced  and  successfully  implemented.  Interviews,  coupled   with  analysis,  will  assess  the  ability  to  implement  potential  strategies  and  tools.  This  will   include  an  assessment  of  the  City  of  Toronto's  Housing  Opportunities  Toronto:  An   Affordable  Housing  Action  Plan  2010-2020,  adopted  in  2009.  As  such,  a  dialogue  will  begin   in  hope  of  finding  appropriate  strategies  for  both  the  satisfaction  of  developers  and  the   increase  of  affordable  rental  housing.      Lastly,  a  synthesis  of  research  will  provide  an  analysis  that  identifies  potential  actions  and   policies  that  can  be  employed  to  get  private  sector  developers  to  generate  more  affordable   rental  housing.  Tools  will  be  judged  according  to  the  context  of  the  Canadian  national   affordable  housing  system,  Toronto's  particular  urban  setting,  and  demonstrated   applicability  from  case  studies  in  conjunction  with  both  public  and  private  sector   interviews.              12

AFFORDABLE  HOUSING  BACKGROUND:  UNDERSTANDING  THE  NEED   FOR  MORE  PRIVATE  SECTOR  INVOLVEMENT  
Housing,  let  alone  the  provision  of  affordable  housing  in  one  of  the  most  contentious,  dense   and  growing  regions  of  Canada,  is  a  multifaceted  and  complicated  issue.  Not  only  are   housing  markets  ingrained  in  wider  economic  environments  at  national  and  international   levels,  but  also  it  is  very  responsive  to  local  context  (Mah  2009,  1).  As  a  result,  Mah  (2009)   suggests  that  the  provision  of  affordable  housing  is  particularly  difficult  to  address  given  its   proven  "resistan[ce]  to  policy  responses"  (Mah  2009,  1).  Therefore,  an  examination  of  the   Canadian  housing  system  as  well  as  the  specific  Toronto  policy  framework  is  needed  when   trying  to  understand  shortages  in  affordable  rental  housing.      The  landscape  of  housing  funding  has  changed  over  the  course  of  the  last  50  years  in   Canada.  Post-World  War  II  policy  saw  large  federal  investment  in  large-scale  social  housing   projects  (Kolsteren  2012,  10).    Later,  "a  hodge-podge  of  initiatives  came  and  went  in  the   1950s,  1960s  and  1970s"  (Falvo  2007,  7),  which  culminated  in  disinvestment  and   retrenchment  from  senior  levels  of  government  (Kolsteren  2012,  11).  Deemed  as  failures   by  the  1960s,  the  large-scale  investments  and  projects  soon  gave  way  to  a  change  in  the   National  Housing  Act  in  1973,  which  sought  to  promote  the  production  of  housing  through   a  variety  of  non-profit  organizations  and  co-operatives  (Kolsteren  2012,  11).  This  marked   the  shift  towards  private  and  non-governmental  provision  of  affordable  housing,  which   continued  in  this  direction  to  the  present  day.  However,  inconsistent  levels  of  federal  and   provincial  funding  and  shifting  responsibility  continue  to  exist.        The  1980s  and  1990s  saw  continued  government  retrenchment  and,  as  a  result,   contributed  to  the  decrease  in  both  public  and  private  rental  housing  development  (Mah   2009,  5).  Specifically,  in  1993,  the  federal  government  withdrew  from  funding  social   housing  completely,  while  Ontario  downloaded  the  responsibility  of  affordable  housing  to   municipalities  "without  corresponding  funds"  (Mah  2009,  5).  This  resulted  in  next  to  no   new  non-profit  housing  being  built  in  the  later  part  of  the  1990s  (Hulchanski  2002,  12).  Of   note  as  well,  is  the  fact  that  under  the  Social  Housing  and  Reform  Act  of  2000,  jurisdiction         14

for  affordable  housing  was  handed  down  to  municipalities  in  Ontario,  embodying  the  shift   from  federal  to  municipal  responsibility  (Kolsteren  2012,  13).  This  era  strongly  contributed   to  the  current  housing  situation  in  Toronto  by  decreasing  funding  and  affecting  the  ability   of  non-profit  and  public  housing  providers  to  finance  affordable  housing  and  maintain  the   existing  housing  stock.      While  the  federal  government  committed  to  a  housing  strategy  in  2001  (Falvo  2007,  11),   the  funding  has  been  described  as  "meagre"  (Hulchanski  2002,  iii),  pointing  out  that   affordable  housing  can  no  longer  be  viewed  as  being  solely  provided  and  funded  by  the   public  sector.  While,  as  Klosteren  (2012,  v)  points  out,  senior  government  funding  is  a  key   element  in  the  production  of  affordable  housing,  the  bottom  line  is  that  the  City  of  Toronto   will  need  to  garner  private  sector  participation  while  also  advocating  for  further  upper   level  government  subsidies.      The  Toronto  Community  Housing  Corporation  (TCHC)  is  the  agency  responsible  for   publicly  provided  affordable  or  social  housing  in  Toronto.  It  provides  homes  for  nearly  60,   000  households  (Toronto  Housing  Corporation  2013)  while  another  91,  232  are  on  waiting   lists  as  of  January  2014  (Housing  Connections  2014).  TCHC  provides  a  diversity  of   residents  with  a  variety  of  housing  assistance,  ranging  from  fully  subsidized  units,  to  rent- geared-to  income  units  and  affordable  (below  market  rate)  units.  TCHC  is  funded  by  federal   transfers,  provincial  contributions,  regional  pooling,  reserve  fund  withdrawals  and   municipal  taxes  (Kolsteren  2012,  16).  However,  since  senior-level  government  funding  has   dwindled  and  has  become  inconsistent,  the  City  needs  to  look  elsewhere  to  produce   affordable  housing,  at  least  in  part,  to  lessen  the  burden  on  TCHC.  TCHC  simply  does  not   have  enough  funding  to  create  the  needed  amount  of  housing,  let  alone  maintain  their   existing  housing  stock.  Government  policy  needs  to  take  steps  to  give  them  breathing  room.   This  can  be  done  through  encouraging  affordable  rental  construction  from  the  private   sector.  Partnerships,  land  and  available  funding  must  be  used  to  leverage  further  housing   opportunities  outside  of  strictly  public  provision.  The  1999  Mayor's  Homelessness   Taskforce  Report  advocated  that  more  public  investment  in  affordable  housing  was   essential  to  attaining  increased  private  sector  participation  stating  ""the  need  for  public         15

investment  in  low-cost  housing  could  not  be  clearer"  (Task  Force  1999,  14).  Essentially,   government  subsidies,  be  it  in  the  provision  of  land,  tax  easement,  financing  or  cash,  are   necessary  to  make  the  cost  of  affordable  housing  feasible  for  private  sector  development.      Recently,  the  Canadian  and  Ontario  governments  have  adopted  the  Canada-Ontario   Affordable  Housing  Program  (AHP),  which  has  marked  some  areas  of  optimistic   improvement.  Since  2010,  developers  have  expressed  positive  experiences  with  the   program,  especially  with  the  "turnkey  approach"  (Black  2012,  22)  which  provides  grants   and  other  financing  to  partner  a  developer  with  an  NGO,  where  the  developer  constructs   the  building,  assumes  the  risks  and  acquires  a  reasonable  profit  before  handing  the   building  over  to  the  NGO  who  will  maintain  the  affordability.  However,  federal  funding  to   social  housing,  as  demonstrated  by  Chart  1,  has  been  steadily  decreasing  and  is  set  to   eventually  remove  all  federal  dollars  to  social  housing,  again  demonstrating  the  reluctance   of  upper  level  governments  to  support  affordable  housing.      Figure  3:  Declining  Federal  Social  Housing  Funding  to  Ontario  (Ministry  of  Municipal   Affairs  and  Housing  2014)

to  understand  is  that  these  policies  are  not  prescriptive  and  their  implementation  is  "fluid   and  contextual"  (Klosteren  2012,  16).  This  means  that  while  they  provide  the  legislative   backing  for  affordable  housing  production,  there  is  nothing  that  ensures  that  such   development  happens  to  the  extent  that  it  is  needed.  Herein  lies  the  issue.  The  municipality   cannot  address  the  problem  alone,  nor  is  there  a  legislative  framework  or  upper-level   government  funding  to  have  the  private  sector  contribute  at  the  level  needed.

TORONTO  DEVELOPMENT  ISSUES  
As  this  section  demonstrates,  much  development  in  Toronto  is  yet  to  match  up  with  the   needs  of  many  Torontonians.  The  mis-match  points  to  systematic  problems  with  how   Toronto  provides  a  full-range  of  housing.  In  1999,  the  Mayor's  Homelessness  Taskforce   Report  pointed  to  several  issues  Toronto  was  facing  in  terms  of  affordable  housing.  These   issues  have  remained  pervasive.  The  report  pointed  to  the  rising  portion  of  renters  that   faced  affordability  issues,  increasing  numbers  of  low-income  households  as  well  as  the  gap   between  supply  and  demand  of  affordable  rental  housing  (135).  The  report,  now  15  years   old,  also  pointed  out  that  the  number  of  households  that  are  paying  more  than  a   "reasonable  proportion  of  their  income  [is]...large  and  increasing"  (138).  The  demand  for   affordable  housing  has  continued  to  rise.  In  2006,  598,  120  households,  or  33.4%  of  all   Toronto  households,  spent  more  than  30%  of  their  income  on  shelter  (Ministry  of  Finance   2009).    Compounding  this  issue  is  that  there  has  been  a  proportional  loss  of  affordable   units  (FCM  2012,  8).  Since  purpose-built  rental  construction  over  the  past  15  years  has   only  accounted  for  10%  of  all  housing  starts  (mentioned  above),  this  low  supply  has  placed   upward  pressure  on  rents,  pushing  many  units  beyond  what  can  be  deemed  affordable   (FCM  2012,  7).  There  are  a  number  of  factors  that  have  played  a  part  in  the  lack  of  rental   production.  Rent  regulations,  taxation  on  rental  investment  income  and,  most  of  all,  the   increased  costs  of  new  construction  in  cities  means  that  income  from  rental  investments  do   not  provide  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  (FCM  2012,  7).  Condominium  development  is  also   very  lucrative.  "This  disincentive  to  invest  in  rentals  is  in  large  part  attributable  to  the   impact  of  condominium  development,  which  sets  the  price  for  multi-residential  land"  (FCM   2012,  7).  Rent  regulation  can  also  be  attributed  as  a  factor  to  increased  condominium   development.        The  current  affordable  housing  context  in  Toronto  suggests  that  affordable  housing  is  a   problem  that  continues  to  grow  worse.  Since  2009,  21  urban  centres  in  Canada,  including   Toronto,  have  seen  a  trend  in  decreasing  vacancy  rates.  Toronto's  2014  vacancy  rate  for  all   rental  units  is  projected  to  be  1.8%  (CMHC  2013d,  4).  It  was  3.2%  in  2006  (CMHC  2006,   14).  Similarly,  the  waiting  list  for  TCHC  and  other  affordable  housing  providers  (such  as  the         19

DEVELOPMENT  AND  THE  TORONTO  MARKET  

Toronto  is  faced  with  a  set  of  challenges  when  attempting  to  boost  its  affordable  rental   housing  stock.  Development  and  construction  costs,  the  cost  of  land  and  the  length  of  time   associated  with  getting  projects  off  the  ground  can  be  extremely  high.  As  a  result,  the  cost   of  land  and  construction  in  the  city  can  be  prohibitive  to  creating  affordable  housing   (Wellesley  Institute  2005,  3).  Market  demand  and  prices  are  also  high  and  are  either   remaining  constant,  or  rising    (CMHC  2013)  because  the  cost  of  land  is  capitalized  in  sale  or   renting  price.      CMHC  reports  that  the  average  2-bedroom  apartment  rent  is  about  $1,  200  per  month  or   $1,000  for  a  1-bedroom  (CMHC  2013).    As  calculated  by  the  Wellesley  Institute  (2005),  to   afford  such  a  rent,  a  household  would  need  to  have  an  income  of  over  $  40,000,  when  in   2005,  they  calculated  that  to  afford  a  rent  of  $1,060  per  month,  an  income  of  $42,400   would  be  needed  (3).    The  same  report  put  the  number  of  households  with  an  income  of   less  that  $40,000  at  382,000  or  over  40%  of  the  City  of  Toronto,  a  number  that  had   continued  to  increased  since  1991  (Wellesley  2005,  3).  The  development  of  affordable   housing  in  Toronto  has  also  suffered  since  the  1990s.  Since  federal  disentanglement  and   the  subsequent  provincial  downloading  to  municipalities,  development  of  new  affordable   units  stalled.  Between  1995  and  2005,  less  than  half  of  the  city's  44  wards  had  any  new   affordable  units  constructed  (Wellesley  Institute  2005,  3).  Where  over  2,000  units  were   created  each  year  between  1990  and  1994,  the  later  part  of  the  decade  only  saw  a  total  of         20

1,435  units  added  (Wellesley  Institute  2005,  3).  When  the  number  of  people  requiring   affordable  homes  is  increasing  and  the  number  of  new  units  being  constructed  is   decreasing,  there  is  a  serious  disconnect  between  market  realities,  public  policy  and   funding.        For  many,  homeownership,  even  through  affordable  homeownership  programs,  can  be  out   of  the  question.  While  affordable  homeownership  programs  assist  with  boosting  down   payments  or  second  mortgages,  a  prospective  participant  in  the  program  still  needs  a   significant  amount  of  cash  to  start.    Options  for  Homes,  a  Toronto  based  affordable   homeownership  builder  and  provider,  typically  requires  around  a  5%  down  payment  (with   Options  covering  the  rest  of  a  20%  down  payment  to  avoid  paying  mortgage  insurance)   (Options  for  Homes  2014).  That  means  that  for  a  $150,000  condo,  the  buyer  would  still   need  to  come  up  with  $7,500  as  a  down  payment.  As  a  result,  "rental  demand  is  growing  in   the  GTA...half  this  demand  is  for  units  that  rent  at  below-market  levels"  (Task  Force  1999,   139).  There  is  a  clear  need  for  an  increase  in  affordable  rental  units.      The  private  sector  is  not  able  to  meet  the  low-income  housing  needs  without  some  form  of   government  subsidy  (FCM  2012,  3).  While  in  recent  years  there  has  been  an  increase  in   affordable  housing  construction,  the  "patchwork  of  funding  and  programs  at  the  federal,   provincial  and  municipal  levels  has  failed  to  deliver  the  numbers  of  new  affordable  homes   that  are  desperately  needed"  (Wellesley  Institute  2005,  3).  As  a  result  of  the  legislative   framework  and  senior-level  government  funding  shortages,  the  City  of  Toronto  has   attempted  to  leverage  land  use  and  planning  tools  to  address  affordable  housing  shortages.   Most  have  come  from  Section  37  of  the  Planning  Act  as  well  as  the  Large  Sites  Policy  of  the   Toronto  Official  Plan.  The  Large  Sites  Policy  is  yet  to  produce  any  affordable  housing,   however,  the  Hines  and  Tridel  East  Bayside  development  is  set  to  sell  20%  of  their  units   (between  70  and  75  units)  to  the  City  of  Toronto  as  affordable  units  (Moosebraaten  2013).   This  would  be  the  first  use  of  the  policy.  Because  of  the  size  requirement,  it  would  not  apply   to  most  developments  in  Toronto.  Both  of  these  policies  are,  inclusionary  housing  policies   in  the  sense  that  they  can  require  the  provision  of  affordable  housing  as  a  condition  to   development  approval.  The  strength  of  these  tools,  however,  must  be  considered.             21

   Section  37  is  an  ambiguously  worded  policy  in  the  Planning  Act  that  states  that  for   developments  seeking  an  increase  to  allowable  height  and  density  according  to  the   municipality's  zoning,  they  must  provide  "community  improvement  facilities,  services  or   matters"  (Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing  1990,  37)  in  return.  Essentially,  that  is  to  say,  a   developer  must  secure  community  benefits  for  the  neighbourhood  where  the  development   is  located.  The  policy  also  allows  "cash  in  lieu"  payments  to  the  local  municipality  that   would  be  put  towards  community  improvement  facilities,  services  or  matters.  The  Large   Sites  Policy  has  a  cash  in  lieu  option  is  as  well  (City  of  Toronto  2010,  3.2.1.9).  The  overall   effectiveness  of  these  policies  at  producing  affordable  housing  has  been  largely  criticized   (Mah  2009,  9).  Community  benefits  are  negotiated  by  ward  councillors  and  developers  on   an  ad  hoc  basis  and  the  type  of  benefits  that  are  obtained  vary  according  to  the  priorities  of   local  councillors  (Mah  2009,  9).  Since  affordable  housing  is  just  one  of  the  community   benefits  that  can  be  agreed  upon,  it  is  not  provided  with  every  development.  Often,  other   benefits  like  parks  or  contributions  to  the  art  and  culture  are  more  accepted  by  local   neighbourhoods  compared  to  affordable  housing  because  housing  is  seen  as  "benefitting  a   limited  range  of  residents"  (Klosteren  2012,  19)  while  parks,  community  and  recreation   centres  or  public  art  are  seen  as  benefitting  the  whole  community.  NIMBY  attitudes  can   also  present  negative  perceptions  of  affordable  housing.  Cash  in  lieu  has  also  been   highlighted  as  a  loop-hole  for  developers,  who  would  rather  pay  for  their  density  bonus,   than  deal  with  providing  community  benefits  (Mah  2009,  9).  Consequently,  Mah  (2009)   contends  that  Section  37  and  the  Large  Sites  policy  "are  not  effective  tools  at  generating   affordable  housing"  (Mah  2009,  9),  citing  that  since  1983,  only  18.9  percent  of  Section  37   agreements  involved  affordable  housing  (Mah  2009,  9).  From  this,  a  reasonable  conclusion   is  that  Toronto  must  develop  or  adjust  policy  tools  to  create  enough  affordable  housing  for   its  population.      There  are  significant  affordability  issues  spread  throughout  the  Greater  Toronto  Area,  none   more  severe  than  in  the  City  of  Toronto  (City  of  Toronto  2013).  Section  37  agreements  are   concentrated  in  Toronto  because  that  is  where  the  development  market  generates   additional  density  rezoning.  The  growth  of  non-governmental  organizations  involvement  in         22

affordable  rental  housing  provision  was,  not  only  in  response  to  a  lack  of  private  sector   development  of  rental  units,  but  up  until  2000,  has  also  "compensated  for  the  virtual   disappearance  of  private-sector  rental  construction"  (Task  Force  1999,  144).  In  Toronto,  it   is  clear  that  a  policy  change  to  further  incentivize  or  require  the  involvement  of  the  private   sector  is  needed  to  reflect  the  need  and  demand  for  affordable  rental  housing.  

CONDOS  AS  RENTAL  PROPERTIES  
An  important  part  of  Toronto's  housing  rental  stock  are  condominiums.  Condominium   development  has  dominated  the  Toronto  multi-unit  scene  for  the  past  four  decades,  in  part   due  to  intensification  policies  and  as  response  to  rent  review  legislation.  For  this  research   to  be  useful,  the  role  the  condominium  market  and  subsequent  condominium  rentals  that   occur  as  a  result,  must  be  acknowledged.  As  a  response  to  market  conditions  and  low   interest  rates,  condominium  construction  has  played  a  large  role  in  the  decline  of  purpose   built  private  rental  buildings,  which,  has  therefore  constrained  the  supply  of  rental   housing.  The  housing  market  in  Toronto  has  also  resulted  in  condominiums  as  investment   properties,  leading  many  units  to  be  rented  out,  either  individually,  or  by  a  professional   rental  management  company  (Urbanation  2014).  In  2013,  a  total  of  19,689  condo  units   were  rented  through  the  Multiple  Listings  Service  (MLS)(Urbanation  2014),  which  does  not   include  listing  services,  such  as  "Craigslist".  As  a  result,  condominiums  now  account  for   about  20%  of  all  rental  apartment  supply  in  Toronto  (Urbanation  2014).  "The  increase  in   investor  involvement  in  recent  years  and  strong  demand  among  renters  has  made  rentals   the  fastest  growing  segment  of  the  Toronto  condo  market." (Urbanation  2014).      However,  the  average  monthly  rental  price  for  condominium  rentals  was  $1,829   (Urbanation  2014),  which  suggests  that  most  rental  condo  units  are  being  rented  for  well   above  the  market  average  for  all  rental  units  ($1,  200  per  month  for  2  bedroom  [CMHC   2013a]).  Therefore,  the  rental  condominium  market  is  not  directly  serving  the  city's   residents  for  whom  housing  affordability  is  an  issue.  However,  the  increase  in  the  supply  of   units  must  be  considered  as  having  a  positive  impact.  The  portion  of  households  that   obtain  housing  from  the  condominium  market,  let  alone  the  market  it  self,  must  be  taken   into  consideration  when  debating  policies  that  are  aimed  at  increasing  housing         23

affordability.  This  is  because  policy-makers  could  choose  to  consider  subsidizing  or   incentivizing  condominium  investors  to  provide  affordable  units  or  loosen  development   restrictions  to  bring  down  costs,  which  could  lead  to  increased  affordability.

ALTERNATIVE  POLICIES  &  STRATEGIES  
This  section  explores  existing  policies  that  provide  alternatives  or  additions  to  current   policies  in  Toronto  that  may  incentivize  or  require  increased  private  sector  participation  in   building  affordable  housing,  including  affordable  rental  housing.  Policies  will  be  explained   and  the  way  in  which  the  policies  engage  the  private  sector  will  be  described.      Policies  that  can  engage  private  sector  developers  in  the  construction  of  affordable  rental   housing  can  be  divided  into  two  categories:  "carrots"  or  "sticks".  "Carrot"  policies  refer  to   the  idea  of  incentivizing,  or  providing  some  sort  of  attractive  reason  (i.e.  a  tax  break  or  an   expedited  development  approval)  to  a  developer  to  decide  to  become  involved  with,  in  this   case,  affordable  rental  housing.  "Stick"  polices  refer  to  the  implementation  of  a  policy  that   requires,  or  forces,  (i.e.  inclusionary  zoning  or  a  mandatory  financial  contribution)  a   developer  to  provide  something,  in  this  case,  affordable  rental  housing.  The  following  is  a   list  of  policies  that  have  been  used  across  North  America,  in  one  way  or  another,  to  attempt   to  create  affordable  housing.  

  
  

POTENTIAL  POLICIES  
"STICKS"  

Housing  Trust  Fund   An  affordable  housing  trust  fund  is  one  way  of  requiring  private  sector  developers  to   contribute  to  affordable  housing.    An  affordable  housing  trust  fund  works  by  collecting   mandatory  contributions  from  all  developments  of  a  pre-determined  type  (a  percentage  of   uplift  value,  for  example  could  be  used).    Funds  would  be  dedicated  to  the  provision  of   affordable  housing,  as  opposed  to  being  shared  among  other  community  benefits.   Administered  by  a  housing  department  such  as  the  Toronto  Affordable  Housing  Office,  the   housing  fund  would  then  be  able  to  "offer  a  blend  of  grants  and  loans  and  support  housing   initiatives  from  new  construction  to  capital  repairs  and  energy  upgrades."  (Shapcott   2014a).  While  developers  would  play  an  indirect  role  in  providing  affordable  housing,  the   trust  fund  would  be  in  a  position  to  provide  the  financing  or  subsidy  that  would  incentivize   private  sector  developers  to  get  directly  involved  (by  applying  for  the  funds  or  land  made         25

available  by  the  increased  funding).  The  housing  trust  fund  would  be  able  to  stipulate  what   type  of  developments  qualify  for  funding  and  be  able  to  control  what  is  constructed.  In  this   way,  a  housing  fund  would  be  able  to  ensure  purpose-built  rental  buildings  were  built.      Another  benefit  of  creating  an  affordable  housing  trust  fund  is  that  it  would  be  able  to   administer  a  community  land  trust,  which  would  secure  public  land  or  purchase  available   land  from  the  contributions  to  the  fund.  A  community  land  bank  could  therefore  offer   attractive  long-term  land  leases  for  affordable  housing  development  (Shapcott  2014a).   However,  this  type  of  arrangement  would  need  to  be  carefully  managed  and  monitored  to   avoid  negative  outcomes.        Exactions  Fees   Exaction  fees  are  taxes  on  new  commercial,  retail  or  industrial  projects  within  a  certain   municipality  or  ward,  that  could  be  directed  to  a  specific  fund  for,  as  an  example,  the   creation  of  affordable  housing.  Exactions  can  be  called  "conditions"  or  "impact  fees"  and   can  be  delivered  in  various  ways,  either  monetarily  or  physically  (University  of  Florida  Law   2014,  1).  They  can  be  in  the  form  of  "infrastructure  building,  cash  payments  to  the  local   government,  dedications  of  land  for  public  uses,  conditions  on  future  land  use,  restrictions   on  alienation,  or  other  restrictions  or  burdens  on  the  permit  applicant"  (University  of   Florida  Law  2014,  1).      Exaction  fees  would  be  another  way  to  fund  an  affordable  housing  trust  fund  but  in  this   case,  developments  of  all  kinds  would  be  contributing.  As  well,  depending  on  how  the   exaction  fee  policy  is  designed,  it  could  be  collected  on  ward-by-ward  basis  and  fund   affordable  housing  in  each  individual  ward.  This  would  enable  municipalities  and  ensure   developers  and  businesses  that  contributions  would  go  to  the  immediate  areas  of  their   projects.  However,  this  has  the  potential  to  facilitate  uneven  provision  of  affordable   housing  throughout  a  municipality  since  the  areas  with  the  most  development  and   business  activity  would  receive  funding.        The  best  known  type  of  exaction  fees  are  called  Linkage  Fees,  which  seek  to  `link'  the         26

effects  of  non-housing  development  to  local  housing  options.  Linkage  fees  look  to  "offset   the  adverse  impact  of  major  new  commercial  and  other  job-generating  developments  on   the  local  housing  conditions  "  (Sherlowski  1999,  2).  What  is  of  interest  is  that  linkage  fees   look  to  have  private  businesses,  aside  from  residential  developers,  who,  "as  various  reports   have  shown...directly  and  indirectly  create  many  new  low-paying  jobs"  (Sherlowski  1999,   2),  contribute  to  the  process  of  funding  and  constructing  a  full  range  of  housing  since  the   same  developments  "attract  new  households  often  unable  to  find  affordable  housing"   (Sherlowski  1999,  2).      Inclusionary  Zoning   Inclusionary  zoning  requires  a  certain  percentage,  typically  between  10%  and  30%,  of   units  in  a  given  development  to  be  created  as  affordable  units,  either  for  rent  or  purchase.   Affordability  needs  to  be  guaranteed  for  certain  length  of  time,  typically  around  20  years.   There  are  a  variety  of  inclusionary  policies  that  could  require  the  units  to  be  on-site,  allow   them  to  be  off-site  or  allow  cash  in  lieu  contributions.  Most  inclusionary  zoning  policies  are   mandatory,  however,  there  are  voluntary  inclusionary  zoning  models  as  well  (Mah  2009,   36).  Other  inclusionary  policies  can  include  conditional  requirements  according  to  funding.   For  example,  Chicago's  inclusionary  policy  is  10%  of  units  for  private  developments,  but   increases  to  20%  when  the  city  provides  any  financial  assistance  (Wellesley  Institute  2010,   3).      Inclusionary  zoning  is  an  increase  in  regulation  and  therefore  has  several  champions,   detractors,  successes  and  failures.  The  success  of  inclusionary  zoning  policies  can  depend   on  various  municipal  situations,  such  as  hot  or  cold  housing  markets,  political  will  and   community  engagement  (Mah  2009,  46).      "CARROTS"  

Many  incentives  that  can  attract  private  sector  developers  to  building  affordable  rental   housing  come  in  the  form  of  reducing  either  hard  or  soft  costs  of  development.  Overall,   "carrots"  seek  to  make  developments  more  `efficient'  by  reducing  `inefficiencies'  in  the   development  process.  That  is  to  say,  things  that  are  cost-prohibitive,  or  costly  in  time         27

contribute  to  making  projects  more  expensive  and  therefore  more  inefficient.  "Carrots"   attempt  to  reduce  that  burden  to  an  appropriate  threshold  that,  in  turn,  increases  the   feasibility  for  private  sectors  developers  when  assessing  whether  or  not  a  project  is  a  good   investment.  Private  sector  developers  generally  prefer  these  policies.        Reducing  Soft  Costs   Streamlining  the  development  process   The  municipal  approval  process  can  be  time  consuming,  leaving  developers  to  wait  for   months,  even  over  a  year  in  some  cases,  to  have  developments  approved.  Streamlining   environmental  assessments,  planning  and  pre-development  processes  can  be  a  significant   cost  saving  measure  for  a  developer  as  it  not  only  reduces  costs  but  also  reduces  the  risk  of   increased  capital  costs  that  result  from  interest  rate  increases  that  occur  during  long   approval  wait  times  (Black  2012,  30).      Reduce  or  remove  Development  Charges   Development  charges  are  fees  that  are  paid  by  developers  to  the  municipality,  which  are   meant  to  contribute  to  the  cost  of  needed  infrastructure  improvements  that  come  as  a   result  of  adding  more  density  to  an  area.  Development  charges  for  a  two-bedroom   apartment  unit,  in  2014,  are  $15,265  while  a  detached  home  is  charged  $24,298  (City  of   Toronto  2014a,  1).  Reducing  or  waiving  development  charges  has  the  potential  to   significantly  impact  a  private  sector  developer's  ability  to  make  financial  sense  of  building   affordable  housing.  In  Ontario,  Education  Development  Charges  and  GO  Transit   Development  charges  are  also  levied  and  are  additional  charges  to  the  standard   development  charge.      Waiving  fees   Aside  from  development  charges,  other  fees  contribute  to  increased  construction  costs.     Planning  review  fees,  building  permits,  engineering  and  servicing,  property  tax,  Hydro  or   Utilities  Fees,  Parkland  Dedication,  Tarion  Enrolment  Fee,  CMHC  Mortgage  Insurance,   Section  37  contributions,  Harmonized  Sales  Tax  and  Land  Transfer  Tax  are  all  possible         28

additional  fees  that  developers  may  encounter  during  the  development  and  construction  of   a  property  in  Ontario  (Altus  Group  2013,  19).  Together,  but  not  including  Development   Charges,  these  fees  can  cost  well  over  $50,000  per  unit  in  the  City  of  Toronto  (Altus  Group   2013,  24).  Considering  waiving,  or  discounting  these  fees  or  taxes  can  help  bring  costs   down  as  well,  and  can  be  considered  an  incentive  to  developers  when  reduced  or  removed.        Provide  loan  guarantees   Loan  guarantees  are  when,  in  this  case,  a  municipality  provides  backing  to  a  developer's   loan  that  is  financing  the  construction  of  a  building.  Essentially,  the  municipality  is   providing  assurance  to  the  lender  that  if  the  developer  defaults  on  the  loan,  the   municipality  will  pay.  In  this  way,  loan  guarantees  are  able  to  reduce  the  cost  of  borrowing   by  allowing  lower  interest  rates,  which  reduces  overall  expenditure  requirements  for   constructing  a  building  (Black  2012,  31).        Tax  incentives   Tax  based  incentives  are  tax  deductions,  credits  or  refunds  received  for  contributing  to  a   public  priority  or  issue,  such  as  affordable  rental  housing.  In  Canada  and  the  United  States,   most  public  funding  for  affordable  or  social  housing  comes  in  the  form  of  tax  or  grant   measures  (Black  2012,  31).  Currently  however,  Canadian  federal  and  provincial  programs   are  all  grant-based  (Black  2012,  31).  Another  type  of  tax  related  policy  incentive  is  reduced   or  forgone  property  tax,  which  reduces  on  going  operating  expenses  (Black,  31).      Reducing  Hard  Costs   Update  Building/Construction  Regulation     Changing  building  and  construction  requirements  can  also  affect  affordability.  Minimum   unit  size,  building  materials  or  parking  requirements,  for  example  can  impact  overall  cost   of  construction.  Building  regulation  currently  does  not  allow  for  any  buildings  over  four   stories  to  use  wood  frame  construction,  due  to  older  safety  concerns.  However,  new   methods  and  materials  are  safely  allowing  buildings  of  five  or  six  stories  to  be  constructed   with  wood  framing  (Black  2012,  30).  Wood  frame  construction  offers  as  much  as  40%  cost         29

savings  than  concrete  construction  (Black  2012,  30)  and  as  such  would  reduce  cost  of   construction,  making  it  more  feasible  for  private  sector  developers  to  become  involved.     The  Ontario  government  announced  plans  in  March  2014  to  amendment  the  Ontario   Building  Code  to  allow  for  wood  frame  construction  of  up  to  6  stories  (Landau  2014).      Access  to  land   Cost  of  land,  especially  in  urban  centres  like  Toronto,  can  be  a  significant  barrier  to  private   sector  development.  Being  able  to  reduce  the  expenditure  required  to  acquire  land  can  be  a   huge  incentive  for  developers  to  build  affordable  housing.  There  are  few  ways  to  do  this.   Providing  public  land  at  no  cost  is  the  best  way,  however,  in  Toronto,  the  sale  of  public  land   is  expected  to  generate  revenue  for  municipal  coffers  (Black  2012,  29)  or  to  be  conveyed  to   not-for  profit  groups.  However,  there  are  ways  to  provide  land  at  a  below  market  price  that   would  otherwise  be  inaccessible  for  not-for  profit  entities.  While  risky,  a  proactive   municipality  could  purchase  land  in  gentrifying  neighborhoods.  As  well,  building  above   public  facilities,  such  as  community  centers  or  schools  has  been  suggested  in  Toronto   (Oleson  2014).  Long-term  land  leases  have  also  been  shown  to  reduce  upfront  costs  (Black   2012,  29).  Conversely,  from  an  upper-level  government  perspective,  changing  subsidy   levels  to  reflect  higher  land  costs  in  urban  centres  would  also  increase  the  accessibility  of   land  (Black  2012,  29).  It  should  be  noted  that  given  the  strength  of  the  Toronto  housing   market,  caution  should  be  taken  when  providing  developers  with  subsidized  land.  
  

Density  Bonusing   Overall,  Canada  has  a  reputation  of  procuring  private  sector  participation  through  density   bonusing:  agreements  that  provide  additional  residential  development  rights  in  exchange   for  the  provision  of  affordable  units  (among  other  community  amenities  or  public  goods)   or  in-lieu  payments  (Scherlowski  1999,  10).  Density  bonuses  can  be  for  a  suite  of   community  benefits  (like  Section  37)  or  have  one  municipal  interest  as  the  beneficiary.   Incremental  Bonusing,  which  has  been  used  in  the  United  States,  is  a  type  of  density   bonus  that  increases  up  to  a  certain  maximum  as  the  developer  increases  the  amount  of   affordable  units  above  the  original  requirement  (Scherlowski  1999,  11).  Another  type,  used   in  New  York,  called  Incentive  Zoning,  refers  to  a  density  bonus  awarded  to  developers         30

who  voluntarily  contribute  affordable  units,  through  the  transfer  of  development  rights   from  historical  buildings  within  a  certain  zone  (Scherlowski  1999,  62).        Land  Value  Capture  (TIFs  and  TIEGs)   Another  way  of  raising  capital  to  subsidize  affordable  housing  construction  is  through  the   use  of  establishing  "Tax  Increment  Financing"  Zones  or  "TIFs".  Extensively  used  in  Latin   America  and  the  United  States,  TIFs  allow  for  municipalities  to  capture  the  increase  in  land   values  of  a  pre-determined  area  in  order  to  finance  capital  expenditures  towards  public   infrastructure  or  other  public  goods  (Amborski  2013).  This  type  of  revenue  may  pose   challenges  to  implement  in  Canada,  since  property  is  seen  as  a  investment,  however,  the   rationale  is  that  since  value  increases  can  be  associated  with  public  improvement,  that  the   public  should  recoup  some  of  the  benefit  (through  the  increase  of  land  values),  not  just   landowners.  However,  TIFs  take  longer  to  come  full  circle,  economically.        TIFs  would  generate  participation  from  private  sector  developers  in  the  same  way  as  a   housing  trust  fund.  Through  the  accumulation  of  revenue  as  a  result  of  a  TIF  zone,  funds   would  be  made  available  to  qualifying  affordable  housing  developments.  A  rental   component  could  exist  as  part  of  the  criteria  for  evaluating  project  applications.  TIFs  are   used  in  the  United  States  as  a  community  building  tool,  and  affordable  housing  is  one  of  the   permitted  investments.    However,  TIFs  have  not  been  applied  in  Toronto.        Tax  Increment  Equivalent  Grants  (TIEGs)  are  used  by  the  development  sector  to  cover   the  costs  of  redevelopment  and  rehabilitation  of  brownfields.  They  have  been  referred  to  as   "Rehabilitation  and  Redevelopment  Grants"  and  are  similar  to  TIFs  as  they  provide   "financial  assistance  equal  to  all  or  a  portion  of  the  municipal  property  tax  increase   (increment)  following  the  completion  of  a  project  which  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the   assessed  value  of  a  property"  (Ministry  of  Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing  2012).  TIEGs  have   been  used  in  Toronto  and  represent  an  established  way  to  decrease  expenditures  on  land   costs.  They  are  only  applicable  to  brownfields.

CASE  STUDIES  
The  following  case  studies  identify  similar  municipalities  and  their  development  policies   that  encourage  affordable  housing  in  order  to  evaluate  the  potential  for  new  policies  to  be   successful  in  Toronto.  The  municipalities  of  Vancouver,  Montreal  and  San  Francisco  will  be   evaluated.  All  of  these  cities  are  facing  upward  pressure  on  their  housing  market  and  are   experiencing  affordability  issues.  As  a  result,  these  cities  have  introduced  different  types  of   policies  that  seek  to  address  affordability  concerns  and  to  create  more  affordable  units.   Policies  are  aimed  at  a  mix  of  affordable  rental  and  ownership  units.    

Vancouver  
The  City  of  Vancouver  provides  a  good  comparison  to  the  City  of  Toronto  due  to  several   similarities.  Vancouver  is  described  as  the  "tightest  rental  market"  in  Canada,  having  a   vacancy  rate  of  0.9%  (City  of  Vancouver  2014),  a  vacancy  rate  lower  than  in  Toronto.  More   than  half  of  the  city's  residents  rent,  placing  further  strain  on  the  lack  of  affordable  and   moderately  priced  rental  options  available  in  the  city  (City  of  Vancouver  2014).  Vancouver,   and  its  current  mayor,  Gregor  Robertson,  however,  have  made  affordable  housing  a  clear   priority  (Klostenran  2012,  28),  that  targets  the  supply  of  rental  housing,  both  market  and   affordable,  through  a  suite  of  policies.      The  Province  of  British  Columbia  did  not,  as  Ontario  did,  download  the  responsibility  of   social  housing  to  municipalities.  However,  Vancouver  has  a  mandatory  20%  inclusionary   zoning  policy  (Klostenran  2012,  26  and  Mah  2009,  31).  As  well,  Vancouver,  overall,  has   more  inclusive  policies  and  programs  such  as  Development  Cost  Levels  and  Community   Amenity  Contributions  that  also  contribute  to  affordable  housing  creation  (Klostenran   2012,  26  and  Mah  2009,  31).  Vancouver's  20%  policy  functioned  with  the  existing  federal   and  provincial  funding,  prior  to  the  federal  withdrawal  (Klostenran  2012,  28).  The  city  has   since  responded  by  adjusting  the  policy  with  moderate  success,  in  part  due  to  the  addition   of  a  successful  payments-in-lieu  program,  which  deals  directly  with  affordable  housing,  not   just  community  benefits,  in  which  land  designated  as  affordable  housing  is  converted  to   market  rentals  (Mah  2009,  30).  In  all  of  these  cases,  the  funding  has  been  able  to  be  used  to   secure  affordable  housing  elsewhere  in  the  neighborhood  or  adjacent  neighborhood  (Mah         32

2009,  30).  However,  the  lack  of  federal  dollars  limits  the  city's  powers  to  provide  affordable   housing.  It  should  be  noted  that  there  is  no  Ontario  Municipal  Board-like  appeal  process,   which  can  make  developers  more  interested  in  successful  negotiations  with  the  city  (Mah   2009,  27).        An  inclusionary  zoning  policy  is  not  the  only  municipal  policy  that  attempts  to  increase  the   supply  of  affordable  housing  in  Vancouver.  As  mentioned  above,  the  city  has  designated   land  for  affordable  housing  development  as  well,  which,  while  similar  to  the  "Housing  First"   policy  in  Toronto,  makes  explicit  designations  for  affordable  housing,  in  conjunction  with   the  adapted  in-lieu  policy  that  facilitates  the  funding  of  such  sites.  In  October  of  2012,  the   city  approved  an  "Interim  Rezoning  Policy  for  Affordable  Housing"  which  is  "aimed  at   encouraging  innovation  and  enabling  real  examples  of  affordable  housing  choices  on  major   streets  related  to  transit"  (City  of  Vancouver,  2013,  1).  This  temporary  rezoning  facilitates   the  approval  of  20  development  proposals  that  are  between  three  and  six  stories,  on   avenues  or  arterial  streets,  have  a  "strong  level  of  affordability"  and  are  100%  rental  units,   or  ownership  available  at  20%  below  market  rate  (Vancouver  2014).  After  the  first  20   qualifying  projects,  city  council  will  review  the  program  and  consider  extending  the  limit.      Vancouver  has  also  targeted  the  rental  housing  supply  directly.  With  the  idea  that  purpose- built  rental  becomes  more  affordable  over  time,  the  city  has  engaged  in  policies  that   accelerate  and  encourage  purpose  built  rental  housing  (City  of  Vancouver  2012a,  7).  Again,   the  city  has  identified  a  need  stating  that  "With  a  growing  population,  limited  increases  in   income  and  limited  new  supply  of  purpose-built  rental  housing  in  recent  decades,  the  need   for  suitable  housing  choices  for  low  and  moderate  income  households  has  grown   significantly"  (City  of  Vancouver  2014).  As  part  of  the  10-year  Housing  and  Homelessnees   Strategic  Plan,  an  array  of  both  short-term  and  long-term  policies  works  in  unison  to   address  housing  affordability  and  rental  availability.        To  begin,  the  "Rental  100:  Secured  Market  Rental  Housing  Policy"  seeks  to  encourage  the   construction  of  purpose  built  rental  buildings  by  reducing  parking  requirements,  waiving   Development  Cost  Levies  (DCLs)  (similar  to  Development  Charges),  slightly  accelerated         33

application  processing  (rezoning  and  development  permit  applications  processes  occur   simultaneously)  and  relaxing  unit  size  requirements  for  developments  that  are  100%   rental  housing  for  at  least  60  years  or  the  life  of  the  building,  which  ever  is  greater  (City  of   Vancouver  2014).  Affordability  can  then  be  achieved  through  "location,  reduced  parking,   modest  size,  limited  on-site  common  amenities,  level  of  finishing  and  other  design   considerations"  (City  of  Vancouver  2012b,  3),  however,  there  are  no  explicit  requirements   for  affordability.        The  "Short  Term  Incentives  for  Rental  Housing"  or  STIR  is  a  policy  that  provided  incentives   to  purpose  built  rental  housing  for  a  fixed  short  amount  of  time.  It  ran  for  two  and  a  half   years  ending  in  2011  (City  of  Vancouver  2014).  It  offered  similar  incentives  as  the  "Rental   100"  now  offers  as  well  as  a  few  others.  On  top  of  reducing  parking  requirements,  waiving   DCLs  and  relaxing  unit  size  requirements,  the  STIR  program  allowed  for  further  density   bonusing,  expedited  approval  process  and  rental  property  tax  assessment  (on  stratas  that   have  a  housing  agreement  limiting  it  to  rental,  essentially  reducing  property  tax).  A  total  of   1,651  units  were  produced  through  this  policy.  This  represented  a  significant  increase  of   privately  initiated  market  rentals  from  80  units  a  year  to  550  units  a  year  (City  of   Vancouver  2012a,  21).  However,  while  affordability  was  not  a  direct  requirement  of  the   program,  STIR  increased  the  overall  supply  of  rental  housing  and  provided  units  for   moderate  incomes  and  households  whom  are  financially  unable  to  pursue  affordable   homeownership  (City  of  Vancouver  2012a,  29).      These  policies  have  enabled  the  private  sector  to  build  and  increase  the  supply  of  secure   market  rental  housing  and  provide  housing  that  is  affordable  to  moderate  income   households.  Affordability  is  considered  in  all  policies.  However,  the  city  found  that  it  was   unable  to  directly  target  those  in  core  housing  need  through  incentive  based  programs   such  as  "Rental  100"  and  STIR  due  to  the  subsidies  required  to  make  it  financially  viable  for   developers  (City  of  Vancouver  2010,  3).      Key  lessons  from  Vancouver  are  numerous.  Vancouver  utilizes  a  diverse  array  of  policies,   both  regulatory  and  incentive  based,  long  and  short  term,  that  are  able  to  target  key         34

priorities,  like  supply  of  rental  units.  The  city  demonstrated  success  in  increasing  rental   unit  construction  through  short-term  policies  as  well  as  with  the  interim  bylaw,  which   capped  the  amount  of  applications.  The  City  has  also  chosen  to  target  affordability  and   rental  supply  together  as  well  as  separately  and  have  specifically  identified  and  qualified   the  importance  of  both  issues.  The  success  of  introducing  a  mandatory  zoning  bylaw  is  also   laudable.  As  well,  the  City's  Strategic  10-year  plan  sets  aggressive  targets  for  social  and   rental  housing  (City  of  Vancouver  2012b,  2).  However,  all  policies  in  Vancouver  must  be   understood  as  part  of  a  political  and  legislative  atmosphere  that  is  more  supportive  than   Toronto's  development  process,  including  the  OMB,  different  development  and  community   contribution  structures  and  provincial  support.  When  discussing  "deeper  levels  of   affordability,  such  as  housing  for  core-need",  the  City  suggested  that  in  doing  so,  it  would   be  "using  its  limited  tools  to  address  a  responsibility  traditionally  addressed  by  the   Province"  and  went  on  to  state  that  "a  collaborative  government  approach  with  funding   and  programs  from  senior  levels  of  government  is  needed  to  achieve  housing  at  below   market  rents"  (City  of  Vancouver  2010,  3).  

Montreal  
Montreal  has  been  forced  to  take  a  different  approach  in  the  provision  of  affordable   housing.  A  city  that,  like  Toronto,  amalgamated  municipalities  has  now  deamalgamated  and   given  local  land-use  control  to  the  separate  19  boroughs.  As  a  result,  affordable  and  social   housing  programs,  policies  and  funding  are  administered  at  the  city-wide  level,  but  must  be   put  into  practice  through  the  boroughs,  which  have  control  of  over  local  planning  and   development  approval  (Wellesley  Institute  2009,  1).  Like  Vancouver,  the  province  has   much  more  involvement  in  housing  affairs,  funding  and  does  a  better  job  of  having  a   diverse  set  of  funding  options  and  partnerships  (Thibert  2007,  28).  The  Province  of  Quebec   and  the  City  of  Montreal  have  a  variety  of  government  (provincial  and  municipal)  agencies,   initiatives,  programs,  private  sector  and  non-profit  groups  who  provide  different  housing   solutions  and  programs  (Klosteren  2012,  30).  As  a  result,  cross-provincial  or  municipal   comparisons  are  challenging,  but  importantly,  "the  diversity  of  players  creates  a  level  of   resiliency  and  adaptability,  with  government,  non-profit,  and  private  sector  organizations   able  to  involve  themselves  at  different  junctures"  (Klosteren  2012,  31).         35

   Regardless,  Montreal  demonstrates  a  noteworthy  analysis  and  comparison.  Like  both   Toronto  and  Vancouver,  the  city  was  in  need  of  a  response  to  "a  number  of  pressures:  the   rising  house  prices  in  the  city  together  with  the  growing  demand  for  affordable  housing,   the  depleting  supply  of  city-owned  land  for  affordable  housing,  and  the  uncertain  future   availability  of  social  housing  funding"  and  thus  "prompted  a  search  for  ways  of  involving   private  sector  in  providing  affordable  housing,  and  of  securing  sites  for  social  housing  on   privately-owned  lands"  (Wellesley  Institute  2009,  1).  Introduced  in  2005,  the  city  has  an   overall  30%  affordable  housing  policy  for  all  residential  construction  over  200  units  (Mah   2009,  36  and  Wellesley  Institute  2009,  1).  However,  because  Quebec  law  does  not  permit   mandatory  inclusionary  zoning,  it  is  a  voluntary  policy  (Mah  2009,  36)  and  acts  as  a  part  of   negotiations  for  density  bonusing.  The  policy  focuses  on  large  projects,  but  does  not   exclude  smaller  ones  (Mah  2009,  41).  What  is  interesting  is  the  fact  that  developments  can,   essentially,  be  compelled  to  provide  affordable  housing  through  referenda.  In  Sud-Ouest,   local  political  will  and  active  resident  groups  have  been  able  to  make  the  30%  policy  a  near   requirement  by  petitioning  against  developments  through  opposing  proposed  by-laws  that   would  be  providing  density  bonuses  (Mah  2009,  40).  Development  continues  in  the   borough  because  developers  are  still  making  a  profit  (Mah  2009,  45).    Another  notable   feature  of  this  inclusionary  policy  is  the  split  of  the  30%  requirement.    15%  of  this  housing   must  be  "social  housing"  while  the  remaining  15%  can  be  affordable  rental  or  ownership   units.   Montreal's  strategy  clearly  has  been  successful  in  meeting  its  own  goals.  The   number  of  units,  and  particularly  their  percentage  of  the  total  housing   production  on  these  sites,  is  impressive.  (Wellesley  Institute  2009,  8)      While  the  local  context  provides  particularities  that  complicate  comparison  with  other   cities,  and  it  is  therefore  important  to  note  that  Montreal  has  a  history  of  much  higher   rentership  and  a  large  supply  of  rental  housing  (Klosteren  2012,  29).  Like  Vancouver,   strong  political  will  has  also  proven  effective  (Mah  2009,  46).  Mayoral  support  has  been   crucial  (Wellesley  Institute  2009,  1).  Likewise,  an  explicit  commitment  in  the  City  of   Montreal's  2004  Official  Plan  is  that  30%  of  all  new  units  be  created  affordable  (Wellesley         36

Institute  2009,  1),  making  policy  implementation  easier.  Continuing,  the  success  of  the   policy  is  largely  dependent  on  borough  governments,  who,  as  part  of  negotiations  for   increased  density,  are  able  to  use  their  "regulatory  and  planning  tools  to  support  affordable   housing"  which  include  "regulatory  concessions,  promoting  or  allowing  lower-cost  types  of   units,  and  using  cost-saving  standards  or  other  measures"  (Wellesley  Institute  2009,  4)  and   could  possibly  offer  expedited  approvals,  as  one  borough  does  (Wellesley  Institute  2009,   4).  In  this  way,  it  is  interesting  the  way  in  which  a  voluntary  requirement  is  enforced  using   incentive-based  planning  tools.  As  well,  the  split  of  the  requirement  (15%  social  housing  /   15%  affordable  housing)  helps  to  address  low-income  household  affordability  issues,   beyond  what  Vancouver's  inclusionary  policy  has  been  able  to  target.    

San  Francisco  
San  Francisco  provides  another  dimension  to  municipal  policy  seeking  to  encourage   private  sector  participation  in  affordable  housing  construction.  The  city  is  facing   tremendous  upward  real  estate  pressure,  limited  development  potential  and  increasingly   difficult  access  to  secure  affordable  rental  or  ownership  with  average  2-bedroom  rental   rates  approaching  $4,500  per  month  (Seifel  2014,  6).  As  a  result,  the  city  has  had  to   implement  a  number  of  policies  and  programs  that  attempt  to  provide  affordable  housing   options  for  all  of  its  residents.  This  has  led  to  the  introduction  of  an  inclusionary  zoning   policy,  a  housing  trust  fund,  an  affordable  housing  trust  fund,  condominium  conversion   fees,  development  agreement  affordable  housing  fees  and  establishing  the  Office  of   Community  Investment  and  Infrastructure  (OCII),  which  implements  tax  increment   financing  (TIFs)  (Seifel  2014,  18).      First,  San  Francisco's  inclusionary  zoning  policy  applies  to  all  residential  developments   over  10  units  and  requires  developers  to  pay  an  Affordable  Housing  Fee  or  apply  to   construct  affordable  units  on-  or  off-site  in  lieu  of  paying  the  fee  (San  Francisco  Mayor's   Office  of  Housing  2014).  If  units  are  constructed  on-site,  the  requirement  is  between  12- 15%  of  total  units,  depending  on  size  and  location  of  the  development.  However,  if  the  units   are  provided  off-site,  the  requirement  increases  to  20%  (Seifel  2012,  2).  In  this  way,  the

U.S.  Low  Income  Housing  Tax  Credit  (LIHTC)  
It  is  also  important  to  note  a  federal  program  in  the  United  States  that  encourages  private   developers  to  develop  affordable  housing  across  the  country.  Since  1986,  the  United  States   has  provided  a  sizable  driver  of  private  sector  development  of  affordable  housing,  called   the  Low  Income  Housing  Tax  Credit  (LIHTC)  program,  which  allows  developers  to   accumulate  tax  credits  that  can  be  sold  to  investors  to  lower  development  costs  (Polton   2005,  41).  Developments,  either  new  construction  or  rehabilitation,  can  qualify  for  the   LIHTC  program  in  two  ways.  First,  developments  must  have  at  least  20%  of  units  be   occupied  by  households  who  have  incomes  below  50%  of  the  "area  median  gross  income"   (AMGI)  (Freedman  &  Owens  2011,  117).  Second,  developments  can  qualify  if  40%  of  units   are  occupied  by  households  who  have  a  combined  income  below  60%  of  the  AMGI   (Freedman  &  Owens  2011,  117).  In  both  cases,  the  development  must  cap  annual  rents  for   the  affordable  units  at  30%  of  the  "income  limit  defined  for  the  area"  for  at  least  30  years.  If   these  requirements  are  met,  the  project  can  access  a  10-year  stream  of  tax  credits.   However,  the  size  of  the  credit  is  dependent  on  the  percentage  of  units  in  the  development   that  are  affordable  and  as  a  result,  90%  of  units  created  under  under  the  program  qualify   as  affordable  (Freedman  &  Owens  2011,  117).        An  interesting  stipulation  of  the  program  is  how  the  LIHTC  encourages  development  to   specific  areas.  If  development  occurs  in  Qualified  Census  Tracts  (QCTs  Â­  low-income  areas)   or  Difficult  Development  Areas  (DDAs  Â­  areas  with  high  construction,  utility  or  land  costs),   the  project  is  able  to  get  30%  increase  in  credits  (Freedman  &  Owens  2011,  117).  The  ways   in  which  the  QCTs  have  been  identified,  through  the  use  of  AMGI  and  metropolitan  area   definitions  has  evolved  to  include  more  areas  since  the  programs  introduction.  This   provides  a  noteworthy  technique  to  encourage  growth  in  particular  areas  in  cities.      The  program  is  administered  on  a  state  basis,  with  each  state  allocated  a  fixed  amount  of   tax  credit  value.  Between  1987  and  2007,  the  LIHTC  program  has  subsidized  over  31,000   developments,  which  include  over  1.8  million  units  and  accounts  for  over  5%  of  all  renter   occupied  housing  stock  in  the  United  States  (Freedman  &  Owens  2011,  116).  Research  has         39

demonstrated  that  the  LIHTC  has  been  successful  in  creating  affordable  units  in  urban   centres,  however,  it  has  largely  directed  development  to  low-income  neighborhoods,  which   can  be  seen  as  a  `catch-22':  a  barrier  for  low-income  residents'  access  to  better  jobs,  schools   and  quality  of  life  but  conversely  bringing  development  to  particularly  strained  areas.   (Freedman  &  Owens  2011,  116).

PUBLIC  AND  PRIVATE  SECTOR  ASSESMENT  
Interviews  were  conducted  to  garner  public  and  private  sector  opinions  about  the   provision  of  affordable  rental  housing  in  Toronto.    The  interviews,  which  involved  private- sector  developers,  not-for-profit  housing  providers  and  a  member  of  the  Affordable   Housing  Office  at  the  City  of  Toronto  provide  a  practical  understanding  of  the   particularities  of  development  in  Toronto  and  shed  light  on  the  potential  tools  that  could  be   introduced  and  successfully  implemented.  Interviews,  coupled  with  analysis  of  current   municipal  policies  and  plans,  such  as  the  City's  Affordable  Housing  Action  Plan,  will  assess   the  ability  to  implement  potential  strategies  and  tools.    

Private  Sector  
During  private,  confidential  meetings,  private  sector  developers,  as  well  as  representatives   of  a  not-for  profit  affordable  housing  provider  expressed  a  number  of  important  ideas  and   sentiments  about  affordable  housing  policy  and  construction  in  Toronto.  All  interview   participants  made  mention  of  the  impact  that  federal  and  provincial  policy  has  had  and   continues  to  have  on  the  city's  ability  to  provide  affordable  housing  and  acknowledged  the   need  for  increased  funding  and  prioritization  from  upper  levels  of  government.  "Housing  is   not  a  priority  for  any  level  of  government"  one  interviewee  stated.  There  was  also  a  general   sense  from  several  participants  about  a  strained  relationship  between  the  municipality  and   the  private  sector.  Developers  expressed  a  desire  for  transparent,  accountable  and  flexible   planning  and  development  process.  However,  one  participant,  stating  that  the  municipal   government  was  "not  holding  their  end  of  the  bargain",  expressed  the  feeling  that  the   municipality  was  unable  to  deliver  on  their  existing  promises  and  scope  of  housing  affairs.   As  a  result,  the  participant  struggled  to  believe  that  the  municipal  government  would  be   able  to  effectively  implement  any  new  types  of  affordable  housing  policy  solutions.      Developers  agreed  that  housing  issues  need  to  be  viewed  as  an  economic  process,   considering  all  pieces  of  the  puzzle  as  efficiencies  or  inefficiencies.  That  is  to  say,  evaluating   all  parts  of  how  buildings  are  constructed  by  categorizing  each  item  as  either  lowering  or   raising  the  cost  of  construction.  Some  factors,  such  as  regulation,  that  increase  the  cost,  can   be  altered  to  provide  more  efficiency,  thus  a  lower  cost  of  construction  and  lower  price  to         41

consumer.    Similarly,  developers  stated  that  all  additional  costs,  or  inefficiencies,  such  as   development  charges,  are  passed  on  to  the  consumer  (if  the  market  allows).  As  a  result,   developers  viewed  increased  regulation  as  making  it  more  costly  to  build  overall.  This  led   to  participants  considering  strong  regulation  requiring  affordable  housing  construction  as   not  being  able  to  be  introduced  and  implemented  (pass  council  and  appeals)  in  Toronto.  As   result,  inclusionary  zoning  was  not  considered  possible  in  Toronto.  Not-for  profit   representatives,  who  agreed  with  inclusionary  zoning  in  theory,  did  not  think  it  was   possible  to  implement  in  Toronto,  echoed  this  sentiment.  In  the  eyes  of  developers,   increasing  overall  housing  supply  is  the  best  way  to  address  the  high  cost  of  housing  in   Toronto.  One  developer  stated,  "supply  is  the  biggest  thing  for  affordability",  again,   suggesting  that  with  more  requirements  and  costs  levied  on  homebuilders,  affordability   will  not  be  addressed.        Perceptions  of  the  barriers  to  private  sector  affordable  rental  construction  were  largely   tied  to  the  inefficient  development  process  (cost  and  time),  absence  of  enough  consistent,   long  term  funding  and  the  lack  of  municipal  flexibility  or  ability  to  allow  creative  solutions.   Definitions  of  "affordability"  it  was  argued  should  be  tied  not  only  to  monthly  rent  or  cost   of  a  home  but  also  to  the  access  to  quality  of  life  improvements.  For  example,  the  ability  to   live  someplace  that  allows  a  household  to  not  feel  the  need  for  a  second  vehicle  or  vehicle   at  all  impacts  overall  affordability  greatly.  As  well,  affordability  issues  were  challenged  by   the  dynamics  of  Toronto's  condominium  market,  given  the  added  difficulty  of   understanding  the  rental  market  as  not  only  being  represented  by  purpose  built  rental   units.        However,  all  participants  agreed  on  the  importance  of  affordable  housing  (rental  and   ownership),  the  increasingly  problematic  nature  of  provision  in  Toronto  and  the  ability  for   the  private  sector  to  be  suitably  incentivized  to  participate.  Tax  incentives  were  attractive   to  developers,  with  one  mentioning  the  success  and  structure  of  the  American  LIHTC   program.  As  well,  any  way  to  decrease  the  inefficiency  of  the  development  process  was  well   received.  Fast  tracked  applications,  reduced  development  charges,  waiving  other  fees  and

other  similar  adjustments  were  regarded  as  helpful  in  closing  the  financial  feasibility  gap   that  exists  for  private  developers  and  affordable  housing  construction.        Creativity  was  seen  as  a  necessity  when  considering  the  development  context  of  Toronto.   Participants  all  mentioned  the  need  for  creative  solutions,  be  it  building  affordable  housing   above  an  elementary  school  or  flexible  policy  regarding  the  transfer  of  air  rights.  As  well,   developers  expressed  interest  in  a  collaborative  process  with  the  municipality  for  finding   solutions  to  affordable  rental  housing.  Similarly,  the  importance  of  partnerships  between   developers  and  not-for  profit  providers,  especially  with  purpose  built  rental,  was   articulated.    

Public  
The  City  of  Toronto  and  the  Affordable  Housing  Office  (AHO)  have  identified  the  lack  of   affordable  rental  housing  as  a  pressing  issue.  In  2008,  the  City  of  Toronto  carried  out  public   consultations  in  order  to  strengthen  the  2007  Housing  Opportunities  Toronto  Framework   document.  From  that,  the  city  was  able  to  develop  a  10-year  affordable  housing  action  plan   entitled  the  "Housing  Opportunities  Toronto:  An  Affordable  Housing  Action  Plan  2010- 2020".  The  plan  acknowledges  both  the  importance  of  affordable  rental  housing  as  well  as   the  particular  need  in  Toronto.  It  seeks  to  be  a  "road  map  to  steer  the  work  and  investment   decisions  of  the  City  of  Toronto  in  partnership  with  federal  and  provincial  housing  sectors   over  the  next  decade"  (Affordable  Housing  Committee  2009,  6).  Among  eight  strategic   themes,  the  most  important  within  the  context  of  this  research,  is  to  "create  new  affordable   rental  homes".  In  this  section,  the  city  lays  out  the  ways  in  which  it  will  attempt  to  add   more  affordable  units  each  year.  The  plan  points  to  land  costs  as  a  major  hindrance  for   affordable  housing  construction  and  points  to  the  city's  "Housing  First"  policy  for  publicly   owned  land.  As  well,  the  section  points  to  the  need  for  innovative  and  creative  solutions  to   housing  creation.  This  suggests  that  the  city  is  prepared  to  consider  new  ideas  for   providing  affordable  housing  on  public  land,  such  as  building  above  schools.  The  document   refers  to  the  revitalization  of  TCHC  sites,  such  as  Regent  Park  or  Lawrence  Heights  as  well   as  the  West  Don  Lands,  suggesting  that  these  types  of  partnerships,  with  affordable   housing  as  a  key  feature,  shall  be  pursued  and  welcomed.  As  well,  the  plan  identifies  the         43

need  to  provide  affordable  housing  that  is  "truly  affordable"  and  beyond  "just  below   market  rents"  (Affordable  Housing  Committee  2009,  33)  recognizing  the  need  of  affordable   housing  to  be  built  for  low-income  households,  not  just  for  moderate-income  ones.   Developers,  as  well,  mentioned  successful,  ongoing  participation  with  such  revitalization   projects.  It  seemed  as  though  the  developers  were  eager  to  participate  in  these  types  of   affordable  housing  initiatives.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  few  additional  new   affordable  units  are  being  created  as  part  of  ongoing  revitalization,  where  the  focus  has   been  on  replacing  aging  buildings  (TCHC  2014).        Notable  "City  Actions"  from  the  Action  Plan  that  refer  to  the  idea  of  involving  private  sector   developers  in  the  provision  of  affordable  rental  housing  contribute  to  an  understanding  of   the  municipality's  preparedness  and  openness  to  incentivizing  or  requiring  affordable   housing.    Actions  include  allocating  funds  from  development  charges  to  affordable  housing   initiatives,  reviewing  the  "Housing  Incentives  (Municipal  Capital  Facilities)  Bylaw"  (yet  to   be  released)  in  order  to  extend  further  incentives  to  create  affordable  housing  in  mixed-use   developments  and  condominiums  and  "encouraging  the  provision  of  affordable  housing   opportunities  through  the  panning  approvals  process"  (Affordable  Housing  Committee   2009,  34),  i.e.  Section  37.  As  well,  prioritization  for  affordable  housing  funding  will  be  made   to  proposals  that  secure  affordability  of  units  for  more  than  20  years  and  proposals  that   include  partner  non-profit  or  non-profit  cooperative  housing  providers  (Affordable   Housing  Committee  2009,  34).  From  this,  it  can  be  surmised  that  private  developers  who   can  propose  long-term  affordable  units,  in  conjunction  with  a  non-profit  housing  provider   have  the  potential  to  close  the  feasibility  gap  for  private  developments.  However,  the  ability   for  these  actions  to  be  successful  should  be  questioned.  The  lack  of  policy  directly  engaging   the  private  sector  may  not  be  enough  to  convince  private  developers  that  constructing   affordable  housing  is  a  good  business  decision.    Similarly,  actions  explicitly  directed  at   creating  rental  housing  are  absent.      The  Affordable  Housing  Office  attempts  to  use  "what  we  have  right  now"  to  get  affordable   units  constructed.  Therefore,  leveraging  Section  37  negotiations  as  well  as  pursuing   productive  public-private  partnerships  is  the  AHO's  primary  way  of  engaging  private  sector         44

developers  in  the  construction  of  affordable  housing.  An  employee  at  the  AHO  discussed   the  importance  of  upper-level  government  funding  by  describing  how,  when  available  and   coupled  with  the  City's  "incentive  package"  (Development  Charges  waived,  tax  relief  on   affordable  units,  etc.),  many  private  developers  are  interested  in  building  affordable   housing.  However,  without  the  upper-level  government  funding,  projects  are  not  feasible,   as  the  incentives  alone  do  not  provide  enough  of  a  financial  break.  In  addition,  while  the   AHO  acknowledged  the  power  of  inclusionary  zoning,  it  was  described  as  legislatively   impossible  in  Ontario  at  the  moment  and  their  focus  was  therefore  on  using  the  current   framework.  However,  notions  of  developers'  feelings  towards  regulation  (additional  costs   are  passed  down  to  consumer)  were  challenged  by  the  AHO,  as  an  interviewee  stated  that   developers  will  "always  build  to  the  market...so  introducing  new  regulations  would  mean   developers  would  only  change  the  way  they  value  land  and  adjust  accordingly".  That  is  to   say,  the  market  would  simply  need  to  "catch-up"  after  the  introduction  of  something  like   inclusionary  zoning.  According  to  the  AHO,  the  City  of  Toronto  has  requested  inclusionary   powers  from  the  Province  that  would  allow  such  a  policy  to  be  introduced.        The  Federation  of  Canadian  Municipalities  has  proposed  three  initiatives  for  the  federal   government  to  address  affordable  housing  in  Canadian  cities.  They  suggest  a  "Building   Canada  Rental  Development  Direct  Lending  Program"  to  stimulate  investment  in  new   market  rental  units,  with  the  intention  of  increasing  overall  supply  of  rental  units  in  an   effort  to  bring  down  market  rates.  As  well,  the  Federation  recommends  a  "Rental  Housing   Protection  Tax  Credit"  to  preserve  existing  low-rent  properties  from  demolition  and   condominium  conversions  and  an  "Eco-Energy  Rental  Housing  Tax  Credit"  to  improve   quality,  value  and  environmental  impacts  of  such  housing.  Still  lacking  is  the  push  for   strong  incentives  for  affordable  rental  housing.      The  2014  federal  budget  has  "has  failed  to  allocate  a  single  new  dollar  for  critical  housing   investments  Â­  despite  the  overwhelming  national  need  and  a  growing  chorus  of  experts   pointing  to  the  severe  impact  of  the  long-term  erosion  of  existing  federal  housing   investments."  (Shapcott  2014b).  There  is  a  downward  trend  for  federal  housing  funding.   CMHC  has  reported  that  its  primary  national  program  will  be  reduced  by  almost  half  from         45

CONCLUSION  &  RECOMMENDATIONS  
From  a  municipal  perspective,  there  are  a  variety  of  actions  that  should  continue  to  be   pursued  or  begin  to  be  undertaken.  Beyond  simply  listing  potential  policies  that  the  City  of   Toronto  should  implement,  an  understanding  of  the  actions  and  process  needed  to  achieve   more  affordable  rental  housing  is  necessary.  How  can  the  City  of  Toronto  make  affordable   rental  housing  construction  attractive  to  private  sector  developers?  In  Toronto,  since  many   land  use  policy  and  agreements  are  struck  by  politicians,  such  a  task  can  prove  difficult.   Section  37,  for  example  is  negotiated  between  a  developer  and  the  ward  councillor.  The   importance  of  political  will  and  mayoral  support  for  housing  issues  cannot  be  understated.   As  a  result,  planners  do  not  have  the  power,  or  final  say,  to  always  ensure  that  certain   concerns  (such  as  affordable  rental  housing)  are  being  met.  This  does  demonstrate  the   importance  of  planners'  role  as  advisors  and  researchers.  Similarly,  there  is  a  need,  as   articulated  by  the  AHO,  to  develop  policy  that  is  strong  both  in  its  approach  and   implementation.  A  good  policy  is  both  well  intentioned  in  its  concept  as  well  as  its  ability  to   deliver  intended  results.  With  these  ideas  in  mind,  the  following  provides  actions  and   policies  for  the  municipality  of  Toronto  to  consider  pursuing  to  boost  private  sector   developers  in  constructing  affordable  rental  housing.    

Engage,  Educate  &  Consult  
An  important  component  of  this  recommendation  is  engagement.  Planners  need  to  engage   and  educate  local  politicians  with  whom  development  negotiations  and  approvals  flow   through.  Better  understandings  of  issues,  no  doubt,  result  in  stronger  and  more  effective   decisions  (during  Section  37  negotiations,  for  example).  Enhanced  communication  between   all  levels  of  government  would  also  improve  the  potential  for  coordinated  strategies  and   mutual  understanding  around  issues  and  needs.  All  interview  participants  identified  the   lack  or  inconsistency  of  upper-level  government  funding  as  a  challenge  to  building   affordable  housing.        All  interview  participants  also  voiced  a  desire  in  developing  and  being  part  of  creative  and   innovative  solutions  to  address  affordable  housing  shortages.  In  order  for  these  types  of   ideas  to  be  developed,  inclusive  consultations  and  discussion  between  all  stakeholders  are         47

needed.  Private  sector  developers  also  voiced  an  interest  in  participating  in  consultations   with  the  municipality  regarding  affordable  housing  policy  development.  While  this   currently  takes  place,  developers  expressed  a  desire  to  have  more  meaningful  inclusion  in   this  process.    

Strengthen  Partnerships  
As  identified  by  reviewed  literature  and  reports,  case  studies  and  interviews,  public-private   partnerships  are  essential  for  housing  development.  However,  several  interview   participants  expressed  feelings  counter  to  positive  partnership  development.  Developers   shared  feelings  of  animosity,  distrust  or  perceived  laziness  towards  the  municipal   government  as  a  whole.  Similarly,  public  representatives  dismissed  developer  claims  about   the  act  of  passing  on  costs  associated  to  increased  regulation.  However,  for  affordable   housing  to  be  built,  strong,  mutually  beneficial  partnerships  need  to  be  developed,   maintained  and  modeled.  As  the  above  section  prescribes,  inclusive,  transparent   engagement  and  consultation  can  contribute  to  enhancing  private-public  partnerships.      It  is  essential  to  maximize  the  use  of  existing  policies,  tools  and  what  upper-level   government  funding  is  available  to  encourage  affordable  housing  development,  and  as  a   result,  planners  must  seek  to  proactively  establish  relationships  with  developers,  not-for   profit  housing  providers  and  politicians.  A  positive  local  example  of  such  partnerships   would  be  the  model  being  pursued  by  TCHC  through  the  redevelopment  of  old  public   housing  projects  such  as  Regent  Park  and  Lawrence  Heights  with  a  variety  of  developers   such  as  The  Daniels  Corporation  and  Context  Development.  The  Regent  Park  Revitalization,   led  by  The  Daniels  Corporation,  a  private  sector  development  firm,  will  not  only  be   replacing  existing  rent-geared  to  income  units  located  on  publically  owned  land,  but   constructing  at  least  200  additional  affordable  housing  either  in  or  within  close  proximity   to  Regent  Park,  in  addition  to  new  market  units  (TCHC  2014).

Update  Policy  
Reassess  Incentive  Package   As  described  by  the  AHO,  the  Toronto  municipal  government  currently  offers  an  incentive   package  that  aims  at  reducing  the  soft  costs  of  development  (including  waiving   Development  Charges).  However,  the  incentives  alone  are  unable  to  provide  enough   financial  motivation  for  private  sector  developers  to  be  interested  in  building  affordable   housing.  Steps  should  be  taken  to  increase  the  attractiveness  of  this  incentive  package.   Financial  breaks  associated  with  the  reduction  of  both  the  hard  and  soft  costs  of   construction  should  be  considered.  Both  the  `Rental  100'  and  Short  Term  Incentives  for   Rental  Housing  programs  from  Vancouver  were  able  to  successfully  attract  private  sector   developers  to  build  affordable  rental  units.  Likewise,  the  municipality  of  Toronto  could   elect  to  offer  very  attractive  incentive  package  for  a  short  period  of  time  or  to  a  certain   maximum  of  developments  in  order  to  maintain  a  determined  fiscal  balance.     Redesign  Section  37   Section  37  is  a  problematic  tool  for  developing  affordable  housing.  Mah  (2009)  suggests   that  Section  37  and  the  Large  Sites  policy  "are  not  effective  tools  at  generating  affordable   housing"  (Mah  2009,  9),  contending  that  up  until  2009,  only  18.9%  of  Section  37   agreements  involved  affordable  housing  (Mah  2009,  9).  The  AHO  referred  to  Section  37  as   being  a  primary  tool  of  involving  private  sector  developers  in  the  construction  of  affordable   housing,  however  since  many  types  of  community  contributions  are  also  available  as  part   of  Section  37,  affordable  housing  can  be  easily  overlooked.  The  municipality  must  adjust   the  policy  to  properly  account  for  this  problem,  whether  it  is  through  changing  the   negotiation  process,  by  involving  planners  more  directly  or  by  adjusting  the  parameters  of   the  policy  to  include  affordable  housing  requirements.     Secondary  Plans  &  The  New  Development  Permit  System  (DPS)   Secondary  Plans  have  the  potential  to  play  a  significant  role  in  planning  for  affordable   housing.  Secondary  Plans  are  created  with  community  input  to  shape  growth  and  stimulate   investment  or  certain  types  of  redevelopment  in  a  given  area  (City  of  Toronto  2010,  5-9).     As  identified  by  a  representative  of  the  AHO,  secondary  plans  present  a  promising  way  to         49

implement  local  affordable  housing  requirements  or  incentives.  Similarly,  Community   Improvement  Plans  can  also  be  another  way  to  implement  affordable  housing  policies  at  a   neighbourhood  scale.  Community  Improvement  Plans  can  leverage  financial  incentives   such  as  loans,  grants  or  tax  assistance  for  site  remediation,  waiving  development  charges,   development  permit  application  fees  or  refunding  the  park  dedication  fee  (City  of  Toronto   2010,  5-10).  Both  types  of  plans  can  also  contribute  to  streamlining  development   applications.        The  New  Development  Permit  System  (DPS)  also  presents  another  potential  tool  for   implementing  policies  geared  at  encouraging  affordable  housing  construction  in  certain   areas.  The  DPS  is  proposing  to  create  area-based  plans  that  will  "ensure  that  development   is  in  keeping  with  the  local  needs  expressed  through  the  community's  planned  vision  and   objectives.  The  result  will  be  a  more  comprehensive  planning  process  in  which  outcomes   are  predictable  and  align  with  the  expectations  of  the  community"  (City  of  Toronto  2014b,   1).  The  development  of  this  new  system  should  be  closely  followed  and  given  consideration   as  a  potential  way  for  the  municipality  to  implement  further  requirements  or  incentives  for   affordable  housing.    

Introduce  Policies  
While  current  policies  exist  that  have  the  ability  to  be  further  utilized  for  encouraging   private  sector  participation  in  constructing  affordable  housing,  this  research  has   demonstrated  that  with  the  introduction  of  new  policies,  the  City  of  Toronto  has  the   potential  to  implement  policies  that  can  contribute  to  building  needed  affordable  housing.   New  policies  could  also  deal  with  affordable  housing  directly  and  separately  from  other   community  contributions,  as  Section  37  does.  Developing  a  suite  of  policies,  by  adding   additional  policies,  would  also  contribute  to  creating  a  more  resilient  affordable  housing   investment  system.  Vancouver,  Montreal  and  San  Francisco  all  rely  on  a  wider  set  of  tools   for  creating  new  affordable  housing,  particularly  rental  housing.  As  well,  many   recommended  policies  and  tools  (both  existing  and  recommended),  require  a  strong   development  market  since  they  only  affect  new  construction  (Section  37  or  exaction  fees,

for  example).  If  conditions  change,  there  needs  to  be  policies  that  continue  to  support  the   goal  of  providing  affordable  housing.        While  a  mandatory  inclusionary  zoning  policy  would  not  be  legislatively  possible  at  this   time,  several  other  tools  are.  The  benefits  of  establishing  a  Trust  Fund  should  be  given   serious  consideration.  While  a  strong,  transparent  administrative  system  would  be   essential,  a  trust  fund  would  provide  "greater  certainty  in  financing  and  would  allow   housing  developers  to  make  long  term  housing  plans"  (Shapcott  2014a).  Private  sector   developers  have  identified  the  current  inability  to  provide  long-term  assurance  of  funding   as  a  significant  barrier  to  participating  in  the  construction  of  affordable  housing  (Black   2012,  21).  As  well,  this  fund  would  be  able  to  solely  finance  affordable  housing,  as  oppose   to  share  funding  between  a  set  of  municipal  issues.        Both  TIFs  and  Linkage  Fees  also  provide  further  opportunities  to  engage  private  sector   developers.  TIFs  have  been  used  throughout  the  United  States  as  a  community-building   tool.  San  Francisco  has  successfully  implemented  both  tools  in  order  to  fund  affordable   housing  exclusively.  However,  TIFs  and  Linkage  Fees  have  yet  to  be  implemented  in   Toronto  and  would  require  additional  unfamiliar  administrative  processes.  Regardless,  the   ability  to  leverage  all  types  of  new  development  that  improve  neighbourhoods  (commercial   development,  for  example)  to  contribute  funding  to  affordable  housing  construction  should   be  given  consideration.      Lastly,  the  municipality  should  continue  to  lobby  both  provincial  and  federal  governments   for  long-term  commitments  to  funding  affordable  housing.  Tax  incentives  were  identified   by  private  sector  developers  as  compelling  financial  incentives  to  build  affordable  housing.   However,  tax  incentives  for  rental  construction  through  the  CMHC's    Multi  Unit  Rental   Building  program  in  the  1970s  were  "condemned  not  only  because  it  was  an  inefficient   subsidy  to  private  rental  housing,  but  also  because  the  government  had  little  control  over   its  fiscal  cost"  (Steele  2006,  31)  and  contributed  to  the  shift  from  built  private  sector  rental   to  condominiums.  This  would  need  to  taken  into  consideration  when  designing  tax   incentives.         51

Final  Considerations  
While  all  existing  and  recommended  policies  seek  to  encourage  private  sector  construction   of  affordable  housing,  the  municipality  should  commit  to  prioritizing  affordable  rental   housing.  As  this  research  paper  demonstrates,  there  is  an  increasing  need  for  affordable   rental  housing  in  Toronto  and  the  municipality  has  yet  to  implement  sufficient  policies  that   focus  on  this  type  of  affordable  housing.  As  mentioned  above,  no  single  policy  should  be   viewed  as  a  complete  response  to  addressing  housing  shortages.  Thibert  (2007)  points  out   that  "if  we  accept  the  proposition  that  complex  tasks  require  sophisticated  solutions,  then   innovative  planning  and  design  schemes  are  more  likely  to  be  devised  under  flexible  policy   frameworks"  (43)  suggesting  that  municipal  policies  will  need  to  be  both  flexible  and   sophisticated  in  order  to  effectively  address  an  issue  like  affordable  housing.  A  variety  of   policies  would  be  most  effective.  In  this  way,  short-term  programs,  as  used  in  Vancouver,   should  be  considered  as  not  only  a  way  to  test  policies  (through  pilot  programs)  but  also  as   a  way  to  jump-start  private  sector  developers'  interest  in  constructing  affordable  housing.        This  research  has  made  the  argument  for  increasing  private  sector  participation  in   affordable  housing  development  in  the  City  of  Toronto.  By  exploring  the  need  for  affordable   housing,  the  importance  of  providing  affordable  housing  was  understood.  After  examining   the  national,  provincial  and  municipal  legislative  situation  affecting  Toronto,  an   understanding  of  the  federal  and  provincial  government  retrenchment  from  social  housing   funding  demonstrated  a  need  for  municipalities  to  implement  new  policies  and  leverage   planning  tools  to  produce  more  affordable  housing.  As  well,  an  explanation  of  Toronto   specific  policies  provided  an  understanding  of  existing  legislative  context  in  the  city.  A   description  of  Toronto's  rental  housing  situation  and  development  context  highlighted  the   place-specific  challenges  of  affordable  rental  construction.  Next,  a  curated  assortment  of   policies  used  across  Canada  and  the  United  States  to  encourage  or  require  affordable   housing  contributions  from  private  sector  developers  were  explored.  Case  studies  of   Vancouver,  Montreal  and  San  Francisco  highlighted  how  municipalities  facing  similar   housing  pressures  have  attempted  to  address  their  situations.  Interviews  with  key  actors   have  contributed  Toronto-specific  ideas  and  opinions  about  private  sector  involvement  in         52
