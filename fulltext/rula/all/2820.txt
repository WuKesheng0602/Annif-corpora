ABSTRACT
Hydrophilic Modification of Polypropylene Membranes and Films by Catalytic Ozonation Hong Bin Gu Doctor of Philosophy Department of Chemical Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, 2014 Commercial polypropylene microfiltration membranes (PPMM) and biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films were ozonated in aqueous and gaseous media, respectively, followed by graft polymerization of acryl amide (AAm), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to improve their surface hydrophilicity. The efficiency of ozonation conducted in the gaseous and aqueous phases was compared, the gaseous phase ozonation was found slightly more effective in generating peroxide groups, while the aqueous phase ozonation was found more effective in grafting polymerization. Scavengers were added to the aqueous phase ozonation, results indicated that both the radical groups and the molecule ozone contributed to the peroxide generation. The free radical groups contributed maximum 25% and 32% for ozonation of PPMM and BOPP, respectively, and the molecule ozone contributed the percentage remaining. Results also showed that the concentration of peroxides generated on the surfaces of PPMM or BOPP increased with the applied ozone dose and ozonation time in both phases. Copper sulfate hydrate (CuSO4· 5H2O) and ferric chloride hydrate (FeCl3· 6H2O) were added in the aqueous phase ozonation as homogenous catalysts, results showed that the peroxide generation rate of PPMM and BOPP was improved comparing to that of ozonation without catalyst. The peroxide generation of PPMM showed 17% increase by adding copper catalyst, and 16% increase in peroxide generation was observed in ferric catalyzed ozonation of BOPP. The mechanism of the aqueous phase ozonation was investigated, along with that of catalytic ozonation. An enhanced radical process was found for catalytic ozonation in this study. The hydrophilicity of PPMM and BOPP was improved by graft polymerization of

AAm, HEMA and PEG initiated by the peroxides. The aqueous phase ozonation was found more effective in grafting. A washing test was conducted using distilled water blending with 10% isopropyl alcohol. When the ozonated membranes and films were washed and compared to the non-washed ones, it was found that the gaseous phase ozonated PPMM or BOPP lost more peroxides than their aqueous phase counterpart after washing. The washing tests showed that the aqueous phase ozonation could induce a better graft polymerization, because part of the tested peroxides from the gaseous ozonation was washed away in the cleaning and grafting process. The improved hydrophilicity of PPMM was indicated by the contact angle reduction from 129°to 91°for AAm grafting; from 126°to 74°for HEMA grafting; and from 126°to 88°for PEG grafting; Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) measurements showed additional peaks of functional groups, such as amine (N-H) and amide (­N-C=O) functional groups from the grafted AAm (CH2=CH-CO-NH2); and the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images confirmed amorphicity changes of the graft polymerization. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) diffractogram revealed the crystallinity changes of ozonated and grafted PPMM. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to test the filtration performance of virgin and grafted membranes, the filtration tests demonstrated the improvement in anti-fouling effect of the modified PPMM; and the SEM images of the fouled and washed membranes revealed the pore blockage and recovering on the surface. The hydrophilicity of the grafted BOPP was also improved, indicated by the contact angle reduction of AAm grafted film from 80°to 56° . The FTIR showed additional peaks of N-H and ­N-C=O functional groups of grafted AAm. SEM images indicated amorphicity changes of the graft polymerization. The film modified by the aqueous phase ozonation showed its advantages of better graft polymerization, hydrophilicity, and protein adsorption. The results of this study positively impacted the industrial using of PPMM to elongate its duration time of filtration, and improved the applications of BOPP in biomedical areas.

Chapter 1 Introduction
Many membranes and plastic films are polymers. They are widely used in filtration, or in biomedical fields, for drug release, blood and protein packaging materials, artificial organs, medical devices [Xu et al., 2003]. They are chemically nonreactive, easy to process, and have good mechanical and thermal properties; however, their surfaces are usually hydrophobic, and non-bondable or non-compatible. Without treatment, the hydrophobic surface cause anti-coagulation [Dasgupta, 1990] and filtration fouling, which limit their applications in many areas. Membrane filtration is a separation process and has been used extensively in various applications such as wastewater treatment, chemical industry, pharmaceutical industry, etc. However, the filtration flux decline caused by membrane fouling constitutes a major obstacle to the wide-scale applications (Escobar et al., 2005). Research results indicated that increasing membrane surface hydrophilicity could effectively inhibit membrane fouling (Belfer et al., 1998; Boutevin et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2008; Escobar et al., 2005; Gullinkala et al., 2008). To extend the lifetime of the membranes, modifying surfaces of the membranes to increase their hydrophilicity is thus very important. In this research, polypropylene microfiltration membrane (PPMM), a widely used commercial membrane, was selected for surface modification by ozonation and graft polymerization. On the other hand, biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film is cheap, chemically nonreactive, mechanically strong and heat resistant. However, their surfaces are usually hydrophobic and weak-bondable, which limit their applications, such as in printing and lamination of packaging, and in biomedical applications [Dasgupta, S., 1990]. Hydrophobic surfaces cause anticoagulation, adhesion and coating when they come into contact with biomedical materials (Murakami et al., 2003). BOPP film is usually pretreated before used in further processing. Polypropylene films required some type of surface modification prior to commercial uses. In packaging applications, corona or flame treatments are widely used to improve the bondability. In biomedical applications, grafting polymerization is used to improve the hydrophilicity.

Various techniques can be used to increase the polymeric surface hydrophilicity. There are plasma treatment, irradiation with gamma-rays, corona discharge, ion beam treatment, and UV radiation (Hua et al., 2008), etc. Compared to those techniques, ozonation is inexpensive and easy to carry out. Moreover, ozonation modifies surfaces uniformly even with complicated shapes (Yuan et al., 2002). It can be conducted in either gaseous phase or aqueous phase. In fact, aqueous ozonation facilitates the rapid decomposition of molecular In addition,

ozone to form free radicals, which are stronger oxidants than ozone itself.

aqueous ozonation enables the easy addition of catalysts and additives to enhance the ozonation efficiency. When polymers are exposed to ozone, active peroxide groups can be introduced onto the surface. These active peroxide groups are capable of initiating graft polymerization of vinyl monomers with hydrophilic groups. The hydrophilicity of the polymer surfaces thus can be improved (Gu et al., 2009). In my MSc thesis (Gu, 2008), the ozonation of BOPP was reported. Further study of grafting polymerization and protein adsorption were to explore in this research. Hydrophlicity of surfaces depends on the amount of hydrophilic monomers grafted on the surfaces, which in turn depends on the amount of peroxides generated. Information of polymeric membranes modified by ozonation in the gaseous phase and liquid phase was found in literature; reports of ozonation in the presence of catalysts to modify polyethylene films were found recently, which were published by our research group members. However the catalytic ozonation of polypropylene membrane and film for their surface modification, and the mechanism of homogeneous catalytic ozonation of polymer surfaces has not been reported. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to enhance surface hydrophilicity of polypropylene membranes and films by homogeneous catalytic ozonation, and to explore the mechanisms of the conducted ozonation. In Chapter 2, the literature survey is conducted. In Chapter 3, experimental methodology is described, including materials, experiment setup, procedure, and analytical methods. Chapter 4 is the results and discussion regarding dosage study of ozonation applied to PP membranes and films; washing tests; scavenger tests; pH tests; homogeneous catalyst

tests of Cu2+, Fe3+, and the mechanism study of Cu2+ catalyst; grafting tests; flux tests of filtration using modified PPMM, and protein absorption tests for modified BOPP. In Chapter 5, the conclusions of this study are presented.

Chapter 2 Literature Study
2.1 Membranes, films and their modifications
In this section, membranes, films, and their applications and modifications are discussed, the fouling of membranes are also introduced.

2.1.1 Membrane classification Membranes are used extensively in water/wastewater treatment, separations in the food, dairy, paper, textile, chemical purification, biotechnology industries, medical field, and drug release and delivery. The modern era of membrane technologies for water purification was launched in the late 1950s with the development of asymmetric cellulose acetate (CA) membranes for reverse osmosis (RO). The materials that followed CA and its derivatives (i.e., cellulose diacetate and cellulose triacetate) are polyamide (PA), polysulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and polyolefin. Thin film composite (TFC) membranes may be made from a variety of polymers consisting of several different materials for the substrate, the thin film, and other functional layers. Polymeric membrane materials now dominate the commercial product market (Escobar et al., 2005). Membranes are classified according different pore size and applications, as shown in Table 2.1.

In water purification, microfiltration (MF) membranes remove particulates and control turbidity; ultrafiltration (UF) membranes can provide protection from pathogenic microorganisms (including protozoans, bacteria, and viruses) and partially remove natural dissolved organic matter (NOM); nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes remove divalent cations (water softening) and can effectively remove natural organic matter (NOM) (Escobar et al., 2005).

2.1.2 Filtration resistance Fouling resistance includes: Rm = membrane resistance

Ra = adsorption, biofouling Rpb = pore plugging Rc = cake layer

As shown in Figure 2.1, Ra and Rpb are irreversible foulings.

Fig 2.1 Schematic of membrane fouling (http://www.lenntech.com/membrane-fouling.htm, Oct, 2008).

2.1.3 Membrane Fouling The flux decline caused by concentration polarization, and membrane fouling by natural organic matter, proteins and other biomolecules or organic pieces adsorption in the feed stream, is a large challenge. It constitutes a major obstacle to the wide-scale application

5

in these industries. While inorganic scaling of membranes by calcium salts can be controlled by adjusting the pH and adding anti-scalants, natural organic matter is ubiquitous in all water supplies and has been implicated as a major contributor to fouling during filtration of natural water. Concentration polarization and membrane fouling not only decrease membrane permeability, but also shorten membrane life due to the aggressive chemicals necessary for cleaning. When cleaning becomes ineffective, the membranes must be replaced. Concentration polarization decreases the driving force of water flow across the membrane due to a local increase in foulant concentration. The effect is completely reversible, and can be reduced by modifying the flow over the membrane. Membrane fouling itself can occur in two ways: cake formation and adsorption of foulants. Cake fouling is generally reversible by water flushing or backwashing. However, fouling due to the adsorption of foulants is essentially irreversible and can only be treated to a certain extent by aggressive chemical cleaning. Foulant adsorption can occur both on the membrane surface and in the pores. Since hydrophobic adsorption of foulants on membrane surfaces plays a key role in membrane fouling, hydrophilic modification of polymeric membrane surface can be one of the fouling mitigation methods. Many investigations have demonstrated that increasing membrane surface hydrophilicity could effectively inhibit membrane fouling (Hua et al., 2008). Biotic biofouling caused by an active biofilm and abiotic fouling associated with NOM of a microbial origin. The role of microbial processes in the production of foulants is also important. Biofouling is inherently more complicated than other membrane fouling phenomena. Microorganisms can grow, multiply, and relocate. In general, biofouling of membranes will lead to a change in biomolecular structure selectively decreasing the permeate flux with time, especially in the filtration of protein, platelet, or cell-containing solutions. It is believed that the increase of hydrophilic moieties on a hydrophobic material surface can effectively reduce its membrane fouling as a consequence of hydrophobic interactions between the biomolecules and the hydrophobic surface (Chang et al., 2008). Therefore, an ideal anti-fouling membrane should possess the excellent mechanical bulk properties, and the anti-fouling characteristics of a hydrophilic surface on the membrane surface and pores.

2.1.4 Modifications to Improve Membrane Anti-fouling Various methods including blending, coating, adsorbing, chemical-grafting can be used to modify the surface condition. Plasma and radiation-induced grafting have been developed to modify membrane surfaces using hydrophilic modifiers. Ozone appears as a relatively cheap reagent. Ozone is a very active oxidant, and can be easily generated by using a high voltage electric device and using air or pure oxygen as raw materials. Ozonation is widely investigated in polymeric film surface treatment and modification, membrane fouling improvement (Yuan et al., 2002). Although there are not as many articles as other methods reported, such as ultraviolent (UV) and plasma methods utilized in membrane anti-fouling modification, ozonation and induced graft polymerization have their advantages to improve the surface properties of polymer membranes. Ozonation and the subsequent graft polymerization occur not only on the surface comparing to plasma or UV treatment to the membrane, but also occur to the pore sites. This will help to improve the pore anti-fouling. The content of graft polymerization which is strictly controlled can change the pore size to turn the macro-filtration to micro-filtration.

2.1.5 Polymeric films and modifications Polymer films include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyester (PET), etc. In the last few decades synthetic polymers have replaced several materials, such as metals, and have extended their application to many innovative processes. This is due to their superior physical and chemical characteristics such as high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance and chemical inert nature. They are also relatively inexpensive and easy to process. At the same time some of these properties impose a limitation on applications in several new and high technology areas. Thus it is required that their surface properties be modified to suit a particular application without affecting their bulk properties (Sharma et al., 2002). Surface modification is quite often used to create surfaces with properties considerably different from that of the bulk of the polymeric materials. Since the polymer surfaces are non-reactive, and surface modification involves chemical alteration of the surface layer, it requires the generation of high-energy species such as radicals, ions, and
7

molecules to promote a surface reaction. This is achieved by techniques such as flame, plasma, UV, laser, X- ray and  -ray, electron beam, ion beam, and corona treatment (Sharma
et al., 2002). Ozonation and induced graft polymerization also applies to improve the surface

properties of polymeric films.

2.2 Ozonation and Surface Modification
In this section, the peroxide generation by ozonation, peroxide decomposition to radicals and the grafting polymerization induced by the radicals are discussed.

2.2.1 Ozone reactions with polymers The reactions of ozone onto polymers lead to numerous chemical modification. Ozone leads rapidly to formation of oxygenated functions and a chemical reaction occurred at the surface of the polymer as well as in the depth of a material. The main functions appearing during treatment are unsaturated compounds, such as ketones, acids, esters, hydroxyl groups, peroxides and hydroperoxides (Robin, 2004). Surface ozonation is applied in polymer research areas because it has the advantage of uniformly introducing peroxides on the polymer surface even with complicated shapes and offers an easy to handle and relatively inexpensive technique. When polymers exposed to ozone, peroxides are mainly formed in addition to the carbonyl and carboxyl groups. The carbonyl and carboxyl groups themselves are hydrophilic; furthermore, the generated peroxides are capable of initiating polymerization of vinyl monomers, and coupling or immobilizing amide and amino groups, resulting in polymer graft and immobilization onto the ozonated polymeric materials. The reactivity of the peroxidized materials depends on the following factors: peroxide thermal decomposition kinetics, the nature of the generated radicals, the accessibility of peroxides sites, different monomers and monomers diffusion; the degree of polymerization and the length of the chain (Robin, 2004).

This complicated scheme shows that the species R· , HO· , and HOO·are responsible

8

for the further abstraction of hydrogen from a neighboring chain of polyolefin, but also and mainly to the -scissions, leading to alcohol functions. Moreover, the radicals obtained can react with oxygen giving hydroperoxides. On the other hand, intramolecular rearrangement produces different species leading to esters and ketones (Kulik et al., 1995).

2.2.2 Peroxide generation and decomposition on polymer surface Three typical methods are involved in peroxide generation (ozonization, UV irradiation, and plasma treatment). The generated peroxides can decompose to radicals thus induce the graft polymerization. The polymer peroxides formed are decomposed either thermally or using a reducing agent in aqueous solution. Both decomposition methods are commonly used for the initiation of graft polymerization of water-soluble monomers. An important factor governing the initiation of graft polymerization is the accessibility of monomer solution to the polymer peroxides, which must be distributed on the outermost surface and into the bulk phase of the treated polymer substrate (Kulik et al., 1995). To examine the peroxide accessibility, the peroxide density is determined by two methods: iodide and peroxidase methods (Dasgupta, 1990). Plasma treatment seems to generate most of the peroxides in the surface layer of film, while UV irradiation and ozonation will generate peroxides in the subsurface region of film. Peroxide generation depended on both the nature of polymer substrate and the method of polymer oxidation

2.2.2.1 Redox Decomposition of Peroxide The peroxide can decompose with Mohr's salt (FeSO4· (NH4)2SO4· 6H2O) at concentrations ranging of 10-6M, Fe+2 reacts with ROOH (peroxide) to become Fe+3 and ROOH break to RO·and · OH radicals. Under these experimental conditions ferrous ions at a concentration less than 10-6M did not cause any measurable decrease in the peroxide density. A small reduction of peroxide density was observed when the Mohr's salt concentration was in the range from 10-6-10-5M (Kulik et al., 1995).

9

2.2.2.2 Thermal Decomposition of Peroxide The peroxide can also break into radicals by thermal decomposition. Heating the polymer samples led to more prominent decomposition of peroxides than the redox reaction with ferrous ions at 25oC, as is obvious from the comparison. The extent of thermal decomposition of peroxide at 65oC depended on both the nature of polymer substrate and the method of peroxide detection. Raising the decomposition temperature to 85oC led to enhancement of peroxide decomposition. Since the thermal decomposition of peroxide did not obey a simple first-order reaction, it may be assumed that several types of peroxides are formed on and in the polymer substrates (Kulik et al., 1995).

Where Per is the total peroxide density at time t; Pero is the total initial peroxide density; Perom is the initial density of the most decomposable peroxide with the decomposition rate constant of km. Perol/ Pero and k l calculated according to experimental results. kl is practically independent of polymer substrate, peroxide generation method, and peroxide assay, while Perol/ Pero seems to be dependent on all these factors (Kulik et al., 1995).

2.2.3 Graft polymerization The surfaces of ozone-pretreated polymeric membranes or films were subjected to
10

further modification. The grafting of monomers with a vinyl function groups to ozonated polyolefin and other materials can increase surface hydrophilicity. There are several routes one may follow to achieve this goal, and the grafting steps may be carried out under various ambient conditions. The monomers may be used in the vapor phase, liquid phase, in pure or solution, possibly with dry substrates, and the medium may be either organic, aqueous, or a mixture of the two [Dasgupta, 1990]. The grafting reaction was initiated by heat or the addition of FeCl2· 2H2O to discompose the peroxide into the radicals O·and · OH, which induce the polymerization. Different monomers or oligmers can be used, such as poly ethylene glycol (PEG), acrylic acid (AAc), acrylicamide (AAm), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), sodium salt of styrene sulfonic acid (NaSS), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA), N,N(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and 3-dimethyl

(methacryloyl ethyl)- ammonium propanesulfonate (DMAPS) (Kulik et al., 1995).

2.3 Ozone Properties
In this section, ozone properties, ozone dissolved in water and affected by pH were discussed.

(http://www.ozoneapplications.com/info/ozone_properties.htm, Oct, 2010) 2.3.2 Decomposition of ozone in water and pH effect 2.3.2.1 Effect of hydroxide ions OH­ on ozone decomposition Ozone is a very strong oxidant (E0 = 2.07 V), which is second in this regard only to the hydroxyl radical (E0 =2.80 V) and substantially exceeds chlorine (E0 =1.36 V). Ozone reacts with water to give oxygen. The rate of this reaction noticeably grows as pH is raised, which is due to the catalyzing effect of hydroxide ions OH­. The mechanism includes a chain of successive reactions yielding H2O2, O3 ­, · OH and HO2·radicals (Beltran, 2004). The radical products initiate chain decomposition of ozone. The disinfecting and oxidizing efficiency of ozone in water depends on its concentration, which is determined by the rate of its decomposition. The kinetics of ozone decomposition in water and the effect of various factors on the rate of this process were investigated by lots of researchers. However, the results obtained are rather contradictory. For example, different orders of the reaction of ozone decomposition in water, including first (Teramoto et al., 1981), first-and-a-half (Sotelo et al., 1987; Ku et al., 1996), and second (Gurol et al., 1982), and markedly different rate constants have been reported. The decomposition of ozone is catalyzed by OH­ ions and occurs by the scheme (Ershov et al., 2008).

The reaction of O3 with OH­ leads to the loss of additional two molecules of ozone and regeneration of the OH­ ion. The chain process of ozone decomposition occurs as a result of reactions involving · OH and HO2· radicals. The chain is terminated by their recombination. A second-order reaction of ozone decomposition in water was observed in the pH range 6.0­9.5. The study was carried out in the presence of 0.1­1.0 M of a borate or phosphate as a buffering additive, rather than in pure water. The values of the constants, measured at the same pH values as those in the present study, strongly depended on the additive used and its content in solution and differed by one to two orders of magnitude. All these circumstances indicated that the additives are involved in the ozone decomposition (Ershov et al., 2008). The decomposition of ozone becomes faster as temperature rises. The second-order reaction of ozone decomposition in water at pH 4.7 depends on temperature in the Arrhenius coordinates. In the temperature range 9­37° C, this dependence is described by the equation (Ershov et al., 2008).

k (T) = k19 exp {76.0[(T ­ 292)/292 RT]}

(2-10)

Where k19 is the rate constant at a temperature of 19° C, and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol­1 K­1). The activation energy of ozone decomposition was 76.0 ±8.3 kJ mol­1 In spectrophotometric analysis of cell reactor, at 20oC, pH 3, 7 and 9 adjusted with H2SO4, and NaOH, kinetics of ozone decomposition depends on pH (Beltran, 2004):

pH 3: - r O3 = k c(O3)a 3 / 2 pH 7: - r O3 = k c(O3)a
3 / 2~1

(2-11) (2-12)
14

pH 9: - r O3 = k c(O3)a

(2-13)

Where - r O3 is the ozone decomposition rate, k is the constant of decomposition, c(O3)a is the ozone concentration in water.
The

order of ozone decomposition reaction rate changed from 3/2 to 1 when pH

changed from 3 to 9 in the above equations, but it does not mean that the decomposition rate decreased when the pH increased. As Beltran (1995) reported, the reaction constant increased with pH dramatically (the rate constant of the ozone decomposition reaction was found to be 8.3 × 10-5 sec-1 at pH 2, the rate constant was 2.1 sec-1 at pH 12). While the c(O3)a did not drop as much as rate constant increased, c(O3)a was 9.96 × 10-6 M at pH 2, and c(O3)a was 2.23 × 10-6 M at pH 12, as shown in Figure 2.4 of Section 2.3.2.2. Thus the ozone decomposition rate increased with pH increased. As shown in Table 2.5, the reported reaction orders of ozone decay by different researchers were listed.

2.3.2.2 Equations in ozone decomposition In a small bubble columns or mechanically agitated semi-continuous tanks where a gas mixture (O2-O3) is continuously fed into a volume of buffered water of a given pH, set the gas and water phases are perfectly mixed, according to the hypothesis of perfect mixing, a molar balance of ozone in the water leads to the following equation (Beltran F., 2004):

dc(O3 ) a  GO3 dt

(2-14)

Where c(O3)a is the ozone concentration in water, GO3 is the generation rate term of ozone, which varies depending on the kinetic regime of ozone absorption. According to Beltran (2004), this equation can be described as:

dc(O3 ) a  k L a[c* (O3 ) a  c(O3 ) a ]  k1c(O3 ) a dt

(2-15)

Where kLa and k1 are the volumetric mass-transfer coefficient through the water phase and the rate constant of the ozone reaction, respectively, c*(O3)a is the ozone solubility, also is the interface concentration. Figure 2.2 shows a typical profile of the concentration of ozone with time for an absorption experiment in a semi-batch well-agitated tank, the concentration of dissolved ozone increases with time until it reaches a stationary value, at this time,

Fig 2.3 Variation of the apparent pseudo first-order rate constant of ozone decomposition in buffered distilled water with pH (Sotelo et al., 1987)

17

pH is one of the main factors that influence the decomposition of ozone in water. As a general rule, for pH<7 this variable has a slight effect on the ozone decomposition, but at higher pH, the rate increases significantly. Figure 2.3 shows the variation of the apparent rate constant of the decomposition of ozone with pH in a study where first-order kinetics was considered. Figure 2.4 shows an ozone concentration through a film layer. From experiments on ozone decomposition in water carried out at pH 2 and pH 7, the rate constant of the ozone decomposition reaction was found to be 8.3 × 10-5 sec-1 and 4.8 × 10-4 sec-1, respectively. When pH is higher, the rate constant is higher, such as at pH 12, the rate constant is 2.1 sec-1 (Beltran, F., 1995), for a direct reaction between ozone and the hydroxyl ion in organic -free water. It can be found from Figure 2.4 that the ozone concentration is lower in water when the pH is higher, the results for the case of low mass transfer (kL = 2× 10-5 sec-1). Beltran F. in 1995 also determined the reaction and the diffusion times for the ozone decomposition reaction from data on the rate constants at different pH values and the mass-transfer coefficient, In Figure 2.5 the reaction time of the ozone decomposition is plotted at different pH showing the zone where the kinetic regime is slow or fast. It is deduced that at a pH lower than 12, the ozone decomposition reaction will not interfere with the direct ozone reactions of fast or instantaneous kinetic regime. On the contrary, at a pH higher than 12, the ozone decomposition reaction will be the only way ozone disappears when the ozone direct reactions of compounds present in water.

2.4 Mass Transfer of Ozone
Mass transfer of ozone from gas to water in the presence and absence of chemical reactions, and determination of the mass transfer coefficient are discussed in this section.

2.4.1 Mass transfer of ozone in two phases 2.4.1.1 Equilibrium concentration for ozone As shown in Figure 2.6, when the controlling resistance is in the liquid phase, the over-all mass transfer coefficient KLa is general used

m = kga (cg-cgi) = kLa (cLi-cL) = KLa (c*L-cL)

(2-18)

where: m-mass transfer rate of ozone and c*L is the liquid concentration in equilibrium with the bulk gas concentration.

According to Fick's Law

where  L is the film thickness, the characteristic of film theory. For dilute non-reacting solutions, Henry's Law is used to describe the linear equilibrium distribution of a compound between the bulk liquid and gas phases

Hc =

Hc = dimentionless Henry's Law constant. cg and cgi are concentration of gas component in gas mixture, cL, cLi are concentration of gas component in liquid.

mr = E · kLa (c*L-cL)

(2-23)

2.4.1.3 Determination of mass transfer coefficients of continuous-flow model According to Figure 2.7, the general mass balance for aqueous phase at nonsteady state, considering convection, mass transfer and reaction (e.g. ozone dacay), can be written (Gottschalk et al., 2000, p96):

VL

dcL *  QL (cLo  cL )  k LaVL (cL  cL )  rLVL dt

(2-24)

The integrated form of the equation without reaction (rL = 0) is (Gottschalk et al., 2000):

ln[1-

cL  cLo ] = -K2 ·t cL  cLo

(2-25)

where K2 = = .

QL + kLa , cLo = ozone concentration at t = 0, and cL = ozone concentration at t VL

For the liquid phase (continuous - flow):

kLa =

QL (cL  cLo )  rLVL VL c* L  cL

(2-26)

When diffusion, convection, and chemical reaction proceed simultaneously, based on gas absorption theory, the microscopic mass-transfer equation of A applied in liquid phase, the mass transfer is described as Equation (2-27),

D T 2 c A = U  c A +

c A t

(2-27)

22

With chemical reaction

D T 2 c A + r A = U  c A +

c A t

(2-28)

This is the case of ozonation reaction (Beltran F., 2004).

Fig 2.7 A gas-liquid reacting system (Gottschalk et al., 2000)

2.4.2 Determination of the gas­liquid dispersion parameters (d32, G, a and US) L´ opez et al. (2007) investigated gas-liquid dispersion with the images treatment (fast photo taking in short interval). It was found that when a gas is dispersed in a liquid, the bubble shape was not rigorously spherical but always slightly ellipsoidal. Yet, the phenomenon never appeared to be very remarkable. The diameter of the equivalent disc (di) of each individual bubble was estimated assuming a spherical shape. Finally, the Sauter diameter (d32) was calculated from Eq. (2-29) for each experimental condition. The gas hold-up (G) was obtained using Eq. (2-30) by measuring the still liquid (hL) and the gas­liquid dispersion (hG) heights. From these results, Eq. (2-31) was used to calculate the interfacial area (a). The linear rising velocity of an individual bubble (Us) was determined according to Eq. (2-32), where D was the distance covered by the bubble between two
23

successive video pictures (timages). Assuming a perfectly quiescent liquid phase, this velocity is also the slip velocity (US) of the bubble. This procedure of images acquisition and treatment was repeated for each gas flow rate (L´ opez et al., 2007).

2.4.3. Simultaneous determination of mass transfer parameters (kLa, kC and m) An experiment of ozone dissolution in pure water typically led to the concentration profiles at the gas outlet and in the liquid phase shown in Figure 2.8, where the unsteady state and the steady state periods have been separated. Once the steady state has been reached, [O3]G,out which is the unsteady ozone out concentration, takes the particular value [O3]
G,out

which is the steady ozone out concentration; and [O3]L which is the actual ozone concentration in water, takes the particular value [O3]L which is the steady ozone concentration in water . The equilibrium concentration [O3]*L of dissolved ozone, always higher than the actual concentration [O3]L, is also reported in Figure 2.8. Once the steady state has been reached, the mass balance for ozone dissolution in the gas phase of the reactor reduces to Eq. (2-33) where G is the volume gas flow rate and VL is the liquid volume

(L´ opez et al., 2007). Accounting that the gas hold-up was very low in the experimental
conditions investigated here­ the liquid and total reactor volumes have been considered as equal. This equation was used to determine the kinetic constant (kC).
24

The mass balance for ozone dissolution in the liquid phase is presented in Eq. (2-34). Its integration over the unsteady state period provided the expression of the volumic ozone transfer coefficient (kLa), which is presented in Eq. (2-35). Moreover, the solution for the steady state period allows writing of the solubility parameter (S) according to Eq. (2-36) where an average concentration for the gas phase was used. Considering that the gas phase behaves like in a plug flow reactor, this average value corresponds to Eq. (2-37) (L´ opez et al., 2007).

2.5 Ozonation Kinetics and Scavengers
In this section, ozone reaction in pure water or aqueous phase, and ozone reaction with polyethylene were discussed.

2.5.1 Standard potentials The standard potentials of water and ozone in pH<7 solutions are shown in Fig 2.9. The conversion of the new radical into a stable product completes the chain breaking process. However, this radical, by taking part in another reaction, may also provide a new chain path.

Fig 2.9 Standard potentials of ozone in acidic solution (Taube H. et al., 1940)

26

2.5.2 Reaction kinetics of ozone in pure water In water, ozone may react directly with substances, or it may decompose to form secondary oxidants such as · OH radicals, which then themselves immediately react with substances, as shown in Figure 2.10. These different pathways of reactions lead to different oxidation products, and they are controlled by different types of kinetics. Therefore, their relative importance must be known when the oxidation effects of ozone and the rate of ozone consumption are to be predicted or generalized. Early observations of the lifetime of aqueous ozone indicated that the decomposition of the ozone becomes accelerated by increasing the pH (as discussed in Section 2.3.2). In addition, the decomposition of ozone at a given pH is often accelerated by a radical-type chain reaction which in non-pure solutions can be initiated, promoted, or inhibited by various materials, as shown in Figure 2.11. Because of the interaction of multiple pathways, the empirical kinetic laws describing the rate of ozone depletion deduced by different authors disagree even with respect to the kinetic orders of the reactions. Therefore a research program was started to separate the kinetics of the successive individual reaction steps and to investigate their interdependency. In a preliminary study the decomposition of ozone was analyzed in pure water and in aqueous solutions in which radical-type chain reactions were inhibited by · OH radical scavengers such as bicarbonate. Because · OH and · O2 were the assumed intermediates, then the reactions of these species with ozone were studied by producing them independently using pulse radiolyses. As shown in Figure 2.11, it was noticed that those organic materials which are known to convert · OH radicals into HO2·always accelerate the decomposition of ozone unless an ample amount of other radical scavengers is present (Hoigne et al., 1985).

2.5.2.1 Initiation step The reaction between OH- ions and ozone leads to the formation of one superoxide anion (· O2-) and one hydroperoxyl radical (HO2· ) which are in an acid-base equilibrium (pK = 4.8). For this initiation a rate constant was determined for free radical formation of 2 × 70 M-l s-l whereby the factor 2 is due to the fact that two radicals are produced per reaction. A comparable rate constant was found by Forni et al. 1982 when measurements were made in the high pH range. In addition, substance M may react with ozone and thereby either
27

consume the ozone by a direct reaction or produce an ozonide ion radical by an electron transfer.

Fig 2.10 Reactions of aqueous ozone in "Pure Water" (Hoigne et al., 1985)

Fig 2.11 Reactions of aqueous ozone in the presence of materials M which react with O· , or which interact with · OH radicals by scavenging and/or converting · OH into HO2· (Hoigne et al., 1985).

2.5.2.2 Propagation step Upon protonation · O, decomposes into · OH radicals. These now react with substance
28

M. Typical rate constants for reactions of · OH with organic materials are in the range 108-1010 M-l s-l. · OH even reacts with HCO3- and CO32- with a rate constant of 2 × l03 M-l s-l and 4 × l08 M-1 s-l, respectively. Some functional groups present in organic molecules M are known to react with · OH to form an organic radical which adds O2 and then eliminates HO2· /· O2- in a base-catalyzed reaction. The rate constant with which the · O2- formed reacts with additional ozone is very high when compared with that of its (slow) reactions with other materials possibly present in ozonation. Therefore, the conversions of the less ozone selective · OH radical into the highly selective HO2·promote the chain reaction.

2.5.2.3 Termination step Many other organic and inorganic substrates react with · OH radicals to form such secondary radicals which do not predominantly produce HO2· /· O2-. The scavengers-the chemical groups (such as t-butyl alcohol, carbonate ion) which are capable of capturing free radicals from other chemical groups, generally terminate the chain reaction, as shown in Figure 2.12.

Fig 2.12 Scavengers to capture the · OH radicals (Hoigne et al., 1985)

29

2.5.3 Other hypothesis of ozonation in the aqueous phase Figure 2.13 showed the scheme of reactions of aqueous ozone. Ozone decomposed in the aqueous phase generated radicals OH and O2-; and reacted with substrate M to form Moxid. Generated radicals reacted with substrate M' to form M'oxid, or were captured by scavengers.

Fig 2.13 Scheme of reactions of aqueous ozone. M, materials that consume ozone and become oxidized to Moxid (and H2O2); I, materials that initiate the decomposition of ozone to primary radicals; S, free radical scavenger; M', materials that react with OH and form secondary radicals R·and become finally oxidized to M'oxid (Staehelln et al., 1982)

Figure 2.14 showed the half-lives of ozone vs. concentration of carbonate for different pH values decreased with the higher pH value.

30

Figure 2.15 showed relative concentration of ozone vs. time for different [O3]o at high scavenger concentration: there were not much differences of [O3]/ [O3]o at 0.3 M [O3]o to 12 M [O3]o (Staehelln et al., 1982).

2-

] = 10 mM; [PO4 3 ]total = 50 mM; pH 10.0

31

Even the orders of reaction reported in the literature for "pure water" were different. This result is not surprising since in earlier studies the rate of the decomposition in "pure water" was accelerated by undefined chain reactions subsequent to OH- attack. The rate constant kO3,OH- is small when compared with the rate constants quoted for other reactions of O3. This measured value is still different from the rate constant of the primary OH- attack on O3 molecules because it must be assumed that more than one O3 molecule is destroyed per primary initiation step. To get an estimation of the overall stoichiometry of the O3 + OHreaction (when all OH·radicals are scavenged before reacting with O,) the following reaction sequences can be considered:

Hypothesis I (extended for dissociation of HO2- and electron-transfer mechanism) (Staehelln J. et al., 1982)

HO2·

H+ + · O2-

pK = 4.8

(2-38)

O3 + · O2 -

· O3 - + O2

(2-39)

· O3- + H2O

OH·+ OH- + O 2

(2-40)

O3 + OH-

· HO2- + O2

(2-41)

H2O2

HO2- + H+

pK, = 11.6

(2-42)

Hypothesis II (Staehelln J. et al., 1982)

O3 + HO2-

OH·+ · O- + O2

(2-43)

The occurrence of · O2 - as an intermediate (hypotheses I and II) is supported by qualitative chemical detections based on the reduction of tetranitromethane. For this experimental system the stoichiometric yield of OH·radical formation was found to be 0.55
32

±0.08. It is close to 0.67 as predicted by hypotheses I and II. Because the observed overall reaction has been found to be first order in O3 concentration, the sequences of reactions formulated by hypotheses I and II must both be assumed to be rate limited only by the initiation step. Likewise, · O2- and · HO2- can only exist as short-lived intermediates in the pH ranges here considered (Staehelln et al., 1982).

2.5.4 Mechanism about peroxide generation of ozonation on polyethylene Razumovskii et al., 1971 did the investigation of gaseous ozonation on polyethylene powders. The reaction mechanism was suggested as follows: Initial step:

O3 + PH

k1

· OH + POO·

(2-44)

Propagation step:

PH + POO· k2

P· +POOH

(2-45)

O2 + P· O3 + POOH

k3 k4

POO· O2 +· OH + POO·

(2-46) (2-47)

Termination step:

POO·

k5

Inactive (carbonyl and carboxyl groups)

(2-48)

Combine equation 2.30 to 2.34, the following expression was obtained (Kefeli A.A., et al., 1971):

[POOH] =

k1k 2 [ PH ]2 [O3 ] (1  e t ) k5

(2-49)

33

Where  = k 4 [O3 ]{1 

k 2 [ PH ] } k5

One of our researching group member did the catalytic ozonation to polyethylene film (Mastan et al., 2013), it was found that [POOH] on polyethylene film surface also had a exponential relationship with ozonation time.

2.6 Kinetics of Membrane Flux Decline
This section approaches to identify and mathematically describe fouling kinetics, including effects of pore blockage and cake formation; and focus on mitigation fouling by modification of the microstructure of membrane surfaces.

2.6.1 Gas and liquid fouling model Naturally dissolved and colloidal organic matter (NOM), acting alone or in concert with inorganic ions and colloids, is considered a major contributor to membrane fouling in water treatment applications, including microfiltration, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. NOM is a heterogeneous mixture of complex organic materials including humic substances, hydrophilic acids, proteins, lipids, carboxylic acids, amino acids, and hydrocarbons (Kilduff et al., 2005). Flux decline caused by organic macromolecules, (acting alone or in concert with inorganic species, including inorganic colloids), may result from concentration polarization; from pore blockage by solute adsorbed on the membrane surface or within pores; and from the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface, which presents a resistance to flow in addition to the membrane itself.

The molar trans-membrane flux for liquid

Ni=

K i Di (C F ,i -C P ,i ) tM

(2-50)

34

Where D i is the diffusivity of solute in the membrane and the product KiDi is the permeate PMi, C F ,i and C P ,i are the pressure on the feed and permeate surface of the membrane (Max S. et al., 2003).

The separation factor is defined as

a* i, j =

y P ,i y P , j x R ,i y R , j

(2-51)

where y is the mole fraction in the permeate leaving the membrane and x the mole fraction in the retention on the feed side of the membrane (Max S. et al., 2003), i, j are the components in the liquid.

2.6.2 Dead-end filtration fouling model For dead-end filtration under constant applied pressure, rate laws, which are corresponding to pore blockage, pore constriction, and cake formation, can be written by assuming that the number of pores, the pore diameter, or the mass of a cake layer formed at the membrane surface, respectively; and change in proportion to the convective transport of mass to the membrane surface. Various fouling models are obtained for each fouling mode, which can all be formulated as a single equation as shown by (Kilduff et al., 2005):

d 2t dt n = kf ( ) 2 dw dw

(2-52)

where t is time (s), w is the mass filtered (kg), kf is a fouling coefficient with units that depend on the value of n (e.g., s kg-2, for n=0) and n is a dimensionless filtration constant that reflects the mode of fouling: (i) cake formation corresponds to n=0; (ii) complete pore blocking corresponds to n=2; and, (iii) standard blocking (pore constriction) corresponds to n=1.5.

35

2.6.3 Combined pore blockage and cake filtration fouling model Ho and Zydney (2000) developed a model for dead-end filtration (UF and MF) of proteins that combines pore blockage and cake filtration modes of fouling. In this model, total flow through the membrane at any time during filtration, Q (kg s-1), is the sum of flow through open pores (through which the resistance is Rm) and through partially blocked pores on which a cake has formed, offering additional resistance to flow. In the absence of significant cross-flow, the combined pore blockage-cake filtration model is written (Kilduff et al., 2005):

Q = Q o [exp (-

 b PC f
Rm

t) +

 b PC f Rm t )) ] × (1 ­ exp (Rm  R c Rm

(2-53)

where b is the pore blockage parameter (m2 kg-1 solute); note that bulk or feed concentration, Cf, is in weight fraction units. The resistance from cake formation, Rc, which increases as a function of time in proportion to the rate that NOM mass accumulates on the membrane surface, is obtained from:

Rm  Rc = Rm  Rc , 0

1

2 c PC f ( Rm  Rc.o ) 2

t

(2-54)

where c (Pa m4 s kg-2) is the cake formation parameter and Rc,o is the initial resistance of the deposit (i.e., a leakage flow). Extensions to systems having significant cross flow were developed by Kilduff et al. (2002). This model is applicable when the resistance caused by concentration polarization is small, i.e., when salt rejection is negligible. The first term in Equation (2.43) is equivalent to the classical pore blockage model. This term dominates when t is small (t<<Rm/PCf) and the magnitude of the second term becomes negligible. At long time, (t>>Rm/PCf) the second term dominates and the volumetric flux is governed by the classic cake filtration model.
36

2.7 Approaches to Mitigate Fouling
A very important aspect of mitigate fouling is selecting a membrane material that minimizes attractive interactions between foulants and the membrane surface, e. g., hydrophilic modification of membranes.

2.7.1 Surface modification Heterogeneous graft polymerization of specific functionalities or polymer layers has been employed as a route to tailor polymeric membrane surfaces for many different applications. In contrast to surface modification techniques such as alcohol wetting and surfactant adsorption, graft polymerization can modify membrane surface properties permanently. Applications have included filling membrane pores to improve selectivity of pervaporation membranes (Kai et al., 2000; Yamaguchi et al., 2001); attaching moieties to provide ion-exchange properties (Michel et al., 1998; Saito & Yamashita, 1998; Kim & Saito, 2000); and introducing affinity ligands for protein separations (Kiyohara et al., 1997). Considerable attention has been directed at using graft polymerization to increase the wettability of membrane surfaces as a route to reduce fouling. A variety of hydrophilic monomers have been grafted to membrane surfaces to increase their hydrophilicity and reduce their potential to foul during filtration. Graft polymerization requires the generation of active ionic or radical sites on the membrane surface.

2.7.2 Chemical schematic of graft polymerization As shown in Figure 2.16, polypropylene reacted with ozone and peroxide was generated on the backbone molecules. The peroxide decomposed when heated and created carbon radicals. These radicals initiated monomers with vinyl groups to graft onto the backbone by breaking the double bond; radicals transferred to the monomer carbon when the double bond broke, and the chain reaction continued to propagate; graft polymerization occurred till the radicals terminated.

37

Fig 2.16 Radical graft polymerization

2.7.3 Degree of grafting and grafting efficiency The hydrophilcility of modified membrane surfaces depends on monomer type, monomer concentration and active points of the substrates, all these factors govern the amount of polymer grafted to the surface. The degree of grafting achieved for a given ozonation dosage or UV lamp wavelength and energy dosage will depend on both the sensitivity of the base polymer, and intrinsic properties of the monomers employed. Proposed mechanism of UV-assisted graft polymerization of poly (aryl sulfone) membranes showing trunk polymer cleavage, formation of reactive radical sites, and chain growth (Yamagishi et al., 1995). The grafting degree was calculated according to the following equation:

Grafting degree (wt. %) =

wa  wb × 100 wb

(2-55)

where wb and wa are the weight of a membrane before and after surface modification, respectively (Yu et al., 2007).

38

2.7.4 Effect of grafting on surface roughness and permeability Surface roughness may influence fouling, when the relative scale of the roughness and the size of solution components are similar, the fouling gets more (Xua et al., 2005). Graft polymerization has been shown to reduce membrane permeability (increase membrane resistance). For example, a reduction in permeability is explained by pores blocked by grafted poly (vinyl pyrolidinone) (PVP) chains, and possibly some homopolymer deposition in pores. Controlling the graft degree and graft length is very important to obtain the desired hydrophilicity and avoid significantly affecting the permeation (Xua et al., 2005).

2.8 Permeate Flux
For a clean membrane, the method is based on the following relationship:

Jw =

P  0 Rh

(2-56)

where Jw is the volumetric water flux, Rh is the hydraulic resistance of the membrane, and 0 is the viscosity of the permeate. However, for a fouled membrane, an additional resistance Rf will be present, when passing (clean) water through the membrane:

Jw =

P 0 ( Rh  R f )

(2-57)

Thus, the values of Rf can be determined, under specific (and similar) conditions for all the solutes in nonmodified and modified membranes, if Rh is previously determined (when the membrane is clean), and this enables a comparison of the tendency of each solute to foul the membranes.

Permeate flux decline (%) = (1 -

J ) ×100 J0

(2-58)

39

where J0 is the initial permeate flux taken at filtration time of 30 min and J is the permeate flux at filtration time t (Xua et al., 2005).

2.9 Other Researchers' Work of Membrane Anti-fouling and Modification
Works conducted by researchers previously on membrane fouling reduction and polymer surface modification were discussed as follows.

2.9.1 Hydrophilic modification of polypropylene microfiltration membranes by ozone-induced graft polymerization Hydrophilic modification of polypropylene microfiltration membranes was performed with introduction of peroxide onto the membrane surface by gaseous ozone treatment followed by graft polymerization with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), as shown in Figure 2.17. The HEMA grafting made the surface of the PP membrane hydrophilic and less adsorption to bovine serum albumin (BSA) proteins, and the results suggested that the protein fouling layer was reversible (means the fouling layer can be removed by washing or back flushing) because of the hydrophilic nature of the modified membrane (Wang et al., 1999). Filtration of BSA proteins was conducted, the BSA solution has a concentration of 2000 mg/l and a pH 7.0 in 0.1 phosphate buffer was circulated through the membrane module. The permeate flux was measured using a balance (Wang et al., 1999).

Fig 2.17 Schematic illustration of ozone-induced graft polymerization (Wang et al., 1999).

40

Figure 2.18 showed the different initial flux of BSA solution through the modified and unmodified polypropylene membrane.

Fig 2.18 Fluxes for virgin and modified membranes during cross-flow MF of BSA solution (Wang et al., 1999)

As shown in Figure 2.19, the flux recovery efficiency that is closely associated with the reversibility of membrane fouling layers increased markedly with increasing the ozone treatment time by up to five minutes. The grafted membrane obtained with five minutes ozone treatment gave the highest flux recovery of approximately 95%. However, the one minute ozonation had no effect on an improvement of flux recovery, which suggested that only part of the membrane surfaces and pores were modified during short time ozonation. It appears that membrane fouling might be caused by the accumulation of protein aggregates at the membrane surface regardless of the membranes used but could be reversed more easily for the grafted membranes with an appropriate time of ozonation. In summary, the protein fouling layer became reversible with grafting, being removed easily just by water flushing. This can be attributed to the more hydrophilic nature of the modified membrane surfaces. Also, the steric hindrance resulting from the poly-HEMA chains grafted may play a role in preventing the direct interaction between membrane surfaces and proteins (Wang et al., 1999).
41

Fig 2.19 flux recovery efficiencies with water flushing at the end of operation (Wang et al., 1999)

2.9.2 Membrane fouling reduction by back-pulsing and surface modification As shown in Figure 2.20, a combined method of back-pulsing and membrane surface modification was employed for the reduction of membrane fouling. A novel photo induced grafting method was used to render polypropylene (PP) membranes hydrophilic with neutral or positively or negatively charged surfaces by grafting monomers of poly(ethylene glycol 200) monomethacrylate (PEG200MA), dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA), or acrylic acid (AA), respectively. Both unmodified and modified PP membranes, as well as commercial cellulose acetate (CA) membranes, were evaluated in a cross-flow microfiltration system with and without back-pulsing in the presence of Escherichia coli bacterial suspensions. The permeate volume with back-pulsing is highest for the neutral, hydrophilically modified PP membrane and for the commercial CA membrane, approximately 2.6 times that of the unmodified PP membrane without back pulsing (Ma et al.,
2000).

The base membranes used in the experiments are commercial porous disk PP microfiltration membranes with 47mm diameter, 110 µm thickness, 40% porosity, and 0.22µm nominal pore diameter and CA microfiltration membranes with 47mm diameter, 120
42

µm

thickness, and 0.22 µm nominal pore diameter.

Fig 2.20 Permeate volume vs. filtration time for crossflow filtration of 0.14 g/l E. coli: backpulsing results for PP membranes modified with weight gains of 4.4 wt.% PEG200MA graft, 4.3 wt.% AA graft, and 3.7 wt.% DMAEMA graft, respectively; unmodified PP membranes with and without backpulsing, respectively; PP membrane

modified with weight gain of 5.8 wt.% PEG200MA and without backpulsing; commercial CA membranes with and without backpulsing, respectively. Backpulsing experiments were performed at a backward transmembrane pressure of 3.0 psi for 0.2 s after every 4 s of forward filtration at a transmembrane pressure of 5.0 psi (Ma et al., 2000).

2.9.3 Polyolefins reacted with O3 in aqueous phase Dasgupta and his group (1990) investigated surface modification of polyolefins using ozone in aqueous phase for hydrophilicity and bondability. The polyolefin powder was dispersed in water becoming to pulp. The relationship between ozone uptake (percent) and the intrinsic viscosity of the polyolefin was studied. It was found that when the uptake increased, the intrinsic viscosity decreased; which meant that the molecular weight decreased and polymer chain scission had occurred. Figures 2.21 and 2.22 show the results. On the other hand, carbonyl content (percent) increased. Figures 2.23 and 2.24 show the results. The carbonyl and carboxyl contents generated with the ozone uptake were also
43

studied, and were found to have increased with the ozone uptake percent. The rate equation for the well-stirred batch reactor model may be expressed as:

dX = k (1-E') [O] dt

(2-59)

where X = ozone uptake, g O3 consumed / g pulp; t = time, min; k = rate constant, liter gas / g pulp min; E' = efficiency, g O3 consumed / g O3 in feed; and [O] = concentration of ozone in feed gas, g O3 / L gas at reaction temperature. Thus (1-E) [O] is the concentration of ozone in the gas leaving the reactor, which in the case of a well-stirred reactor model, is assumed to be equal to the concentration of ozone in the gas phase throughout the reactor [Dasgupta, 1990].

The rate constant was calculated from experimental data using the equation:

k=

X t (1  E ' )[O ]

(2-60)

2.9.4 BOPP reacted with O3 in gaseous and aqueous phases Figure 2.25 presents the results of the peroxide concentration generated. The results show that the peroxide content per area increased from 0.025mmol/m2 to 0.148 mmol/m2 when the treatment time increased from 0.5 hrs to 4.0 hrs in aqueous solution, and increased from 0.044mmol/m2 to 0.168mmol/m2 when the treatment time increased from 1.0 hr to 3.5 hrs in the gas phase. Peroxide content was generated slower in aqueous solution than in the gaseous phase after 2 hrs ozonation (Gu, 2008).

2.9.5 List of other membrane anti-fouling modification As shown in Table 2.6, different methods and monomers had been used to modify the hydrophilicity of polymeric membranes and improve the anti-fouling. Ozonation is one of the methods, while the aqueous phase ozonation had not been found to be used.

3.1 Materials
3.1.1 Selected polymer membranes and films  Commercial circular polypropylene membrane (PPMM) of 90 mm and 47 mm diameter with 0.22 µm pore size (M02WP04700) and commercial polypropylene membrane sheet of 25.4 cm x 3 m and 0.22 µ m pore size (M02WP00010) were purchased from GE Water & Process Technologies (Oakville, Ontario, Canada).  Biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film, 20 µm, T523-3 was purchased from AET film Co. Ltd.

The PPMMs and BOPPs are made from pure polypropylene polymers, which are highly hydrophobic without coating or co-extrusion layer. In this research, round polypropylene membrane pieces were used directly. The polypropylene membrane sheet was cut into 6.5 cm x 10 cm pieces for ozonation, graft polymerization, and filtration test. BOPP film was cut into 3.81 cm (1.5 in) x 25.4 cm (10 in) strips for ozonation and graft polymerization.

3.1.2 Other materials  Acrylic amide (AAm) 99.5% was used for graft polymerization, and was purchased from VWR Canlab (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).

3.2 Experiment Setup
3.2.1 Experiment setup for membrane and film ozonation Figure 3.1 is a picture of the ozone generation and reaction system, and Figure 3.2 shows a schematic diagram of the ozonation reactor setup used in this research. As shown in Figure 3.2, the oxygen cylinder provides oxygen to the ozone generator through the pressure control meter. The ozone is then generated and fed to the diffuser and reactor vessel through the adjustable valve and flow rate control meter. A three-way valve transports the ozone gas mixture to the analyzer, which measures the ozone concentration. The consumed ozone gas mixture is transported to the exhaust catalyst pipes, and decomposed ozone is released to the environment by the exhaust fan.

3.3.2 The ozonation procedure  Compressed oxygen gas was fed to the ozone generator (PCI-WEDECO Environmental Technologies, Model GL-1); flow was controlled by the flow meter and pressure gauge;  Cooling water was used to remove the heat from the generator;

54



Ozone was generated at a controlled rate to ensure that it was a certain percentage of the oxygen gas mixture (rate was controlled by adjusting the output power knob) in the generator and was released in three ways: to the reactor (flow rate and pressure were measured and controlled), to the exhaust catalyst pipes to be released, and then to the ozone gas analyzer (PCI-WEDECO Environmental Technologies OZONE MONITOR);



Controlled ozone and oxygen gas mixture was fed to the reactor through the diffuser (ceramic, 2-5-µ porous hole size, 7.5-inch diameter), through which it was uniformly diffused in the aqueous phase or gas phase in the reactor.



Pretreated, precisely cut, specific samples of PPMM/BOPP were fixed in the reactor prior to the start of the reaction. Samples reacted with ozone at set concentrations and set reaction times, as shown in Table 3.2.



Samples were hung on the frame inside the reactor, and selected polymer membranes or films were ozonated at room temperature (22-23 oC) with ozone gas mixture in the aqueous (reactor filled with distilled water) or gaseous phase to gain enough peroxides and maintain mechanical strength;



When the target ozonation time finished, turn off the O3 generator, and lead in the O2 to purge the reaction system until the ozone detector shows the ozone concentration to 0.



Samples were taken out when the reaction was finished. Samples were then vacuum dried at room temperature;



Used the standard iodide metric method to analyze the generated peroxide concentration; used the Fourtier Transform Infrared (FTIR) to test the functional groups; used Gonoimeter to test the contact angle of the ozonated membranes/films;



Investigated the effects of the applied dose and reaction time. Ozone concentration in ozone and oxygen gas mixture can be from 0.1 wt% to 3.5 wt%; ozonation time can be 15 minutes to 1.5 hours, depending on the peroxide concentration needed and the remaining mechanical strength of the substrates;



Added catalysts such as Cu2+ and Fe3+ in the aqueous phase, and investigated the ozonation under catalytic conditions;
55

3.3.3 The graft procedure Dried samples were used for graft polymerization to investigate the radical reaction of graft polymerization after ozonation. The equipment was as shown in Table 3.1.  Graft polymerization was performed after ozonation by soaking the ozone pretreated membranes under specific conditions (different temperature and reaction time) in different monomer solutions, which had been purged of oxygen by N2 gas. Different graft polymerizations were studied and compared;  Monomers used were polyethylene glycol (PEG), Acrylamide (AAm),

2-Hydroxyethyl Methacrylate (HEMA). These monomers/oligomers, which have hydrophilic functional groups, can improve the hydrophilicity when grafted to the membranes.  Graft polymerization was stopped by adding cold distilled water to the reactors; samples were put through the washing procedure;   Washed grafted samples were dried under vacuum and kept at room temperature; The changes in hydrophilicity of the modified membranes were tested by the contact angle.  The functional groups grafted onto the membranes were tested by the FTIR instrument;  The changes in the amorphousity of the surface and pores were checked by the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).

3.3.4 The filtration test and protein adsorption procedure  Dried BOPP samples were employed in the BSA protein adsorption test. The method was modified by the author of this thesis from Hu et al. (2008) and Wang et al. (1999). Protein solutions comprised 2000 mg/L BSA in a phosphate-buffer solution (pH 6.9). After the samples were soaked in BSA solution for 16 hours at 50oC, samples were dried under vacuum and sent to do the SEM test;  Dried PP membrane samples were set up in the filtration test device after being pre-wetted;

56



Filtration and fouling tests were conducted by using BSA protein solution in the dead-end membrane filtration device (easy to fix the membrane and get filtration data).



The flux of BSA solution permeating through the virgin and modified membranes was tested, and the fouling differences were compared; (i) The flux testing system is shown in Figure 3.4. It comprises a water/solution tank, pumps, membrane holder, permeate flow line, reject flow line, and return flow loop. This device is designed for testing microfiltration membranes. Applied pressure is 1-50 psig, and flux of permeate is 0.1-3.0 L/min. (ii) The process was conducted according the design of the author, who referred to the report of Chen and Belfort (1999). The trans-membrane pressure was kept constant at 3-10 psig, and the reverse DW washing pressure was 20 psig for the dead-end device. The permeation data were collected at fixed time intervals and the permeate solution was automatically weighed to determine the trans-membrane flux. Protein solutions comprised 1000 mg/L BSA in a phosphate-buffer solution (pH 6.9).



After the filtration test, the membrane samples were cut in half. One half of the sample was washed on surface using DW, and the other half kept in original fouling condition. Both were dried under vacuum, and then sent to do SEM test.

3.4 Experimental Implementation
3.4.1 Ozonation without catalysis Ozonation of PP substrates, in distilled water and in gaseous phase, and in different doses, different pH value, with or without scavengers, and the ozonation aging test, are designed in the following sections.

3.4.1.1 Ozonation in aqueous phase Pretreatment: Used the round PP membranes directly; the BOPP strips were cut from films and washed with distilled water (soaked in distilled water for half an hour, and then dried at room temperature). 10 L distilled water was placed in the reactor. Pretreated samples were fixed to the stainless steel frame to prevent them from sticking to or overlapping one another, and then put into the aqueous reactor; polypropylene membranes and films reacted with ozone according to the ozonation procedure. After ozonation, the samples were taken out according to the desired reaction times: 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 75 min, 90 min, and 105 min. The water was removed with clear tissue paper and samples were vacuum dried at room temperature (22-23 oC) for 1.5 to 2 hours. Dried samples were sent for analysis and further treatment. The ozone doses applied were all set at 3.0 wt% in both aqueous and gaseous phase ozonation, according to the results of our preliminary tests.

3.4.1.2 Ozonation in gaseous phase For the gaseous phase ozonation, the procedure was analogous to the aqueous phase's ozonation, except that there was no water inside the reactor.

3.4.1.3 Investigation of the ozone dose Ozone dose of 1.0 wt %, 2.0 wt%, and 3.0 wt% in oxygen mixture was applied to PPMM ozonation, respectively. The generated peroxide concentrations were analyzed, and the samples reacted with ozone in the aqueous and gaseous phases at the same O3 applied
58

dose and for the same treatment time were compared. It was determined which ozone dose and methods would be used for subsequent graft polymerization. The investigation of the reaction conditions was as follows: 1. Both in the aqueous phase and the gaseous phase, treatment time was set at 0.5 hours, and different applied ozone doses, from 1.0 wt% to 3.0 wt% were studied to determine which dose would result in the highest peroxide content. The results were compared. 2. The O3 concentration was set at 3.0 %wt, and different reaction times, from 15 min to 1.75 h, were used to determine which reaction time yielded the highest peroxide content (and maintained the highest mechanical strength of the BOPP films).

3.4.1.4 The study of the effects of varying pH value in aqueous phase reactions In aqueous phase reactions, O3 concentration was set at 3.0 %wt and treatment time at 0.5 h, and pH value was varied from 3.0 to 10.0, which was adjusted by using 1.0 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M NaOH, and the results were studied.

3.4.1.5 Scavenger study In the aqueous phase, both molecular ozone and free radicals were present. In order to make clear whether both contributed to the generation of peroxide and which one made the main contribution, a radical scavenger test was conducted to find the answers to these questions. Radical scavengers are chemicals which consume the radicals generated during the reaction. The scavenger sodium carbonate was added to the distilled water to eliminate the free radicals.

3.4.1.6 Washing test A washing test was done in order to identify the peroxide content and graft polymerization difference between the gaseous phase ozonation and the aqueous phase ozonation. 10% (v/v) IPA (without IPA, the PPMM surface will hardly get wet in DW) in distilled water was employed to wash the gaseous ozonated PPMM and the aqueous ozonated PPMM. After 15 minutes respectively, the peroxide concentration was analyzed and
59

compared to the non-washed ozonated PPMM. This test also was conducted on the BOPP films.

3.4.1.7 Aging study To study the stability of the peroxide content generated on the films, the aging test was performed for BOPP treated with ozone in the aqueous phase. For each experimental run, the reaction time was one hour and the applied ozone dose was controlled at 3.0 wt%. The films were examined for their peroxide concentration immediately after ozonation, after 3 days, after two weeks, and after 4 weeks.

3.4.2 Catalytic ozonation 3.4.2.1 Fe3+ ion used as the catalyst FeCl3·6H2O was weighed precisely and added to 10 L DW in the reactor and stirred till it dissolved completely; the pH value was then measured; O3 gas was added to the reactor for 1 minute of pretreatment; the samples were placed in the reactor, and the ozonation was started. The concentration of Fe3+ ions was set at different amounts (g/L) for different experiments, and the ozonation time was fixed at 30 minutes. The amount of peroxide generated was measured and compared.

3.4.2.2 Cu2+ ion used as the catalyst CuSO4·5H2O was weighed precisely and added to 10 L DW in the reactor and stirred till it dissolved completely; the pH value was then measured; O3 gas was added to the reactor for 1 minute of pretreatment; the samples were placed in the reactor and the ozonation was started. The concentration of Cu2+ ions was set at different amounts (g/L) for the different experiments and the ozonation time was fixed at 30 minutes; the amount of peroxide generated was measured and compared; the concentration of Cu2+ ions was set at 0.1 g/L (0.7868 mmol/L) and ozonation time was set at from 15 minutes to 60 minutes; the amount of peroxide generated was measured and compared.

60

3.4.3 Investigative tests of the mechanism on catalyst Cu2+ 3.4.3.1 Cu2+ catalytic ozonation applied at a low temperature A low temperature Cu2+ catalytic ozonation was conducted for 15- and 30-minute periods, respectively. The PPMM was ozonated using the same O3 dose as in Section 3.4.2.2; the temperature was set at 0 oC instead of room temperature. The generated peroxide was tested.

3.4.3.2 Scavenger tests in Cu2+ catalytic ozonation Scavengers of 3.0 g/L Na2CO3 or 0.1 mol/L t-butanol was added to the Cu2+ catalytic ozonation (1.574mmol/L), respectively, 3.0wt% ozone concentration and ozonation time from 15 minutes to 45 minutes were set up and tested. Similar tests were done at 0oC.

3.4.3.3 The effect of the anion SO42- on DW ozonation The effect of the anion SO42- was investigated in aqueous phase ozonation. Concentration of SO42- (Na2SO4 applied as a provider of SO42-) was from 5 x 10-4 mol/L to 5 x 10-2 mol/L, which simulated the applied SO42- concentration range in ozonation with the catalyst CuSO45H2O.

3.4.3.4 Investigation of dissolved ozone in DW undergoing Cu2+ catalytic ozonation In order to investigate the dissolved ozone concentration, an indigo test of potassium indigo trisulfonate was employed. The dissolved ozone concentration was tested in the copper catalytic ozonation both at room temperature and at 0 oC.

3.4.3.5 Hydroxyl radical capture by Nitrobenzene (NB) applied to ozonation with or without Cu2+ catalyst A method of special radical capture is applied to demonstrate which radical was generated in the catalytic ozonation. Nitrobenzene is a good chemical for capturing the hydroxyl radicals. The author referred to Feng et al. (2011) "Experimental Determination of Hydroxyl Radical Reactivity in Supercritical Water Using Pulse Radiolysis, " and applied 25 ml NB (99% purity) to 75 ml ozonation solution at different ozonation times to capture the
61

hydroxyl radicals by forcefully shaking the flasks for 5 minutes. NB and water were separated after the capture procedure, and the samples of reacted NB were removed and tested using UV-Vis at the single wavelength of 410 nm.

3.4.4 Graft polymerization of the specific film under selected conditions 3.4.4.1 AAm graft polymerization of the specific film After the ozone dose tests, the ozonation concentration for graft polymerization was chosen at 3.0 wt%, and the ozonation time was 15 minutes. After ozonation and degassing, the PP membranes were immersed in 50 ml 20% AAm in IPA. The solutions containing the membranes were degassed again by nitrogen purge. Thereafter, they were heated to 80 ° C for 20 hours in an incubator shaker at a speed of 120 rpm. After adding cold distilled water to the flask, the PPMM in the flasks underwent the following steps: a) the PPMM was immersed in cold distilled water in the flask for 1.5 hours with the distilled water being changed twice, b) the flasks with PPMM and changed DW were placed inside in 60 oC incubator shaker for half an hour at a shaking speed 80 rpm, c) the DW was poured out and the flasks were filled with acetone and then put in a 50 oC incubator shaker at a speed of 50 rpm for half an hour, d) the acetone was removed and distilled water was added and the flasks were kept at room temperature for 8 hours, and e) PPMM samples were dried at room temperature under vacuum. The author referred to Tu et al. (2005) for the reaction and cleaning methods, but these were modified by author. Dried samples were taken to examination by means of FTIR contact angle and scanning electronic microscope.

3.4.4.2 PEG graft polymerization of the specific film The ozonation dose was chosen at 3 wt% and the ozonation time was 15 minutes. After ozonation and degassing, the PPMM membranes were immersed in 50 ml 20% PEG solutions; PEG200, PEG600, and PEG 3350 were used for the different experiments. The solutions containing the membranes were degassed again by nitrogen purge, then heated to 60 ° C for 20 hours in an incubator shaker at a speed of 120 rpm. After adding cold distilled water to the flasks, the PPMM membranes in the flasks underwent the cleaning procedure.
62

Dried samples were taken to examine by means of FTIR, contact angle, and scanning electronic microscope.

3.4.4.3 HEMA graft polymerization of specific film The ozonation dose was chosen at 3 wt% and the ozonation time was 15 minutes. After ozonation and degassing, the PPMM membranes were immersed in flasks containing 50 ml 20% HEMA solutions. The solutions containing the membranes were degassed again by nitrogen purge, then they were heated to 55 ° C for 20 h in an incubator shaker at a speed of 120 rpm. After adding cold distilled water to the flasks, the PPMM membranes underwent the cleaning procedure. Dried samples were taken to examine by means of FTIR, contact angle, and scanning electronic microscope.

3.4.5 Dead-end filtration test The membranes were examined for anti-fouling properties before and after surface modification. The filtration flow rate and fouling tests were conducted by a filtration setup as shown in Fig 2.4a. With a bypass loop, the pressure and flow rate can be adjusted. The container and pipe loop were designed by the author and built by the Chemical Engineering Department workshop of Ryerson University. The membrane holder (Canlab stainless steel pressure filter holder, 47 mm, 200 ml) and pumps were purchased. 1000mg/L BSA solution (buffered by phosphate at pH 6.9) was employed in the filtration test. Pressure was set at 10 psig for each filtration. The modified and virgin membranes were put through filtration till the permeate weight dropped down to less than 2 g per 5 seconds; then the fouled membranes were reversed and 600 ml DW water was used to back flush the fouled membranes. The back flush pressure was set at 20 psig. Next, the back flushed membrane was reversed, and a second filtration test was conducted using the fresh BSA solution. The weight of the filtration permeate was recorded every 5 seconds by an Ohaus AV2101 auto balance (Ohaus Corporation, NJ, USA), which was connected to a computer recording system. The recorded data were transferred to Excel and underwent calculations, and charts of the flow rate versus time were made to compare the BSA filtration of the virgin and modified PPMM.

3.5 Analytical Methods
The following analytical methods were used in this research: 3.5.1 Standard metric iodide method To analyze peroxide, solutions were prepared using the ratio of 50 ml isopropanol : 2 ml glacial acetic acid + 2 ml saturated KI. 50 ml of solution was added to the samples (pieces of 0.22  x 47 mm round membranes or pieces of films with the dimensions 1.5 in x 10 in). The mixture was heated almost to boiling (83-84 oC) for 5-7 min, and then titrated with 0.001N standard sodium thiosulfate solution until the yellow color disappeared. The consumption of 0.001 N standard sodium thiosulfate was recorded, and the peroxide content was calculated (Tu et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2003). The principal of this test is that peroxide/hydroperoxide reacts with sodium iodide to produce iodine in an acidic environment, and iodine can be precisely titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate solution. Detailed calculations can be found in Appendix I.

3.5.2 FTIR method FTIR (Perkin Elmer Spectrum One, V3.01 instrument) was used to examine functional groups on the surface of polymer films (Fujimoto et al., 1993; Wang et al., 2000). The wavelength scanned was 450 nm-4000 nm.  For Polyolefin, the peaks for C=O are at 1710 to 1750 cm-1; and the peaks for C-O-C are at 1080 to 1110 cm-1.  The peak at 1668 cm­1 is a characteristic frequency of the C-N amide group, and the peak at 3347 cm­1 is the characteristic frequency of N-H.    C-H stretching and vibration are from 2850 to 3300 cm-1. The O-H peak is at 3290 cm-1 [carboxyl] and 3550 cm-1 [hydroxyl]. Other functional group peak values are shown in Appendix V.

3.5.3 Contact angle method The contact angle of the film surface was measured to quantify the change in its hydrophilicity. The film samples were placed on a goniometer (Model 100-00-115, Rame Hart, NJ, USA), a sessile drop of super-pure water was placed on the film sample, and then the static angle was measured (Fujimoto et al., 1993; Yong et al., 2005). Figure 3.5 and Figure 3.6 are photos of the goniometer.

3.5.4 SEM method Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of the virgin, oxidized, and grafted film samples were taken with a JSM-35 microscope (JEOL, Japan) at 15-20 kV. Samples were pre-coated with gold at 0.2 Torr before the SEM analysis (Gatenholm et al., 1996). Samples were observed under 30 to 5000 times magnification.

3.5.5 X-ray diffraction (XRD) method X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the membranes was used to test the crystallinity, and measured by a Rigaku Geigerflex machine (Rigaku MSC, TX, USA) with the tube voltage at 40 kV and the tube current at 45 mA. As amorphous areas are damaged by ozone treatment, rearrangement of associated chains can occur, leading to an increase in the crystallinity/amorphousity ratios (Tu et al., 2006). Also, as exposure ensues, the polymer chains may decrease in length and their mobility increases, once again encouraging the formation of more ordered crystalline regions. Generally, the increase in crystal structure is the main factor in the stiffer and more brittle character of these materials (Kokatnur et al., 1941); and the reverse holds true for the increase in amorphousity. These results should be taken into consideration in studying the mechanical properties of the treated membranes and films (Michael et al., 2004).

3.5.6 UV-Vis spectrometry method The ozone solution and catalytic ozonation solution were tested in a 1 cm3 cuvette placed in the UV-Vis spectrometer (Ultraspec 50, Bichrom Ltd., Cambridge, England). The testing wavelength was fixed at a particular nm or scan from 200 nm to 750 nm. The
66

absorption index, or chart, was recorded. The UV-Vis method is used to test the concentration of ozone or nitrobenzene in solution.

3.5.7 Indigo method The method is to pipet 3.0 ml of prepared indigo reagent II into a 10 ml volumetric flask and dilute to 10 ml. Prepare a volumetric flask for each sample and the blank. Pipet 1.0 ml ozone solution into the flask and shake immediately; determine the absorbance of the blank and the samples at 600 nm UV using a 1-cm cuvette (Markee et al., 2009; Appendix IV). This method is used to test O3 molecular concentration in water.

Chapter 4 Results and Discussion
The most important results presented in this work were obtained from ozone treatment of selected membranes and films in an aqueous medium. The results from ozone gas mixture treatment were obtained for comparison. PPMM and BOPP were used as the substrates to investigate the effects of operating parameters, graft polymerization on surface hydrophilicity enhancement and filtration tests. Through oxidization by ozone of membrane/film surfaces, peroxide groups were generated on the surfaces. Those peroxides provided active species which initiate graft polymerization with vinyl functional group monomers. Consequently, hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amine groups were brought to the surfaces of the polymers. Thereafter, hydrophilicity was improved. Membranes with improved hydrophilicity can increase the anti-fouling of organic and protein materials. Generally, a decrease in tensile strength results from chain scission, and cross-linking reactions as a result of ozone exposure that causes molecular chains to be stiffened. Also, the increase in crystal structure is the factor that causes the stiffer, more brittle character of the films. Different monomers were applied to ozonated PP membranes and films. The grafting polymerizations were studied. The analysis that followed revealed the changes. The modified membranes were used for filtration, and the improvement in anti-fouling ability was determined after the modifications.

4.1 Polypropylene Membrane (PPMM) Ozonation
Polypropylene microfiltration membranes are highly hydrophobic, and the contact angle of PPMM is 120-130o. This hydrophobic property leads to fouling caused by the easy absorption of organic materials, thus PPMM is extremely limited in its applications. The following experiments focused on aqueous ozonation and graft polymerization to effectively improve the hydrophilicity and anti-fouling properties.
68

4.1.1 Ozonation of PPMM in aqueous and gaseous phases In this part of the experiment, PP membranes were ozonated in distilled water and in a gaseous mixture, respectively, to compare the efficiency of ozonation in different reaction media. Ozonation was conducted at 3.0 wt%, 10 L/min gas flow rate, pressure of 103.4 kPa (15 psig), and temperature of 22-23oC. Figure 4.1 shows the results. The peroxide generation increased with ozonation time regardless of whether the ozonation was conducted in the aqueous or the gaseous phase. When the same ozone dose was applied, the detected peroxide concentration of the aqueous phase ozonation was a little lower than that of the gaseous phase ozonation. The relationship of peroxide generation with ozonation time in aqueous phase or in gaseous phase will be discussed in the Section 4.6.

4.1.2 Washing test To explore why aqueous ozonation produced less peroxides, the ozonated membranes were washed to find changes in peroxide concentration. As shown in Figure 4.2, the PPMM membrane that was ozonated in the gaseous phase was washed immediately after degassing using distilled water plus Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) (9:1 in volume, 10% IPA mixed in, to increase the wettability) and compared to the non-washed PPMM membrane that was ozonated in the gaseous phase as well. It was found that PPMM had a much lower peroxide concentration after washing than the non-washed PPMM. The hypothesis used to explain this phenomenon is that when ozone came into contact with the PPMM, peroxide was generated on the backbone molecules. At the same time, chain scission occurred in some polymer molecules, and the oxidized small molecules generated by the chain scission with hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl hydrophillic groups, and peroxide moiety, dissolved in or were removed by the distilled water + IPA. Thus, the peroxide concentration detected was decreased by washing the gaseous ozonated membrane.

It was found that the peroxide concentration of the washed PPMM was very close to that of the non-washed PPMM. This indicated that there were not many oxidized small molecules remaining on the surface after the aqueous ozonation.

The above tests explain the reason in the following graft tests that the detected peroxide concentration of the PPMM that underwent gaseous phase ozonation was higher, but the AAm graft polymerization was lower than its aqueous counterpart.

Mechanism schematic is as shown in Figure 4.4, when the peroxide group was generated on the backbones of large molecules, they remained on the membranes and initiated the graft polymerization.

As shown in Figure 4.5, when the peroxide group was generated on smaller scission molecules, it was washed away by water, monomer solution, or by the cleaning procedure:

4.1.3 Pre-wet test PP membrane is highly hydrophobic. The surface cannot be wetted by distilled water; it can be well wetted when pre-soaked in isopropanol alcohol (IPA) for 15 seconds and then soaked in distilled water for 5 minutes. In this test, dry and pre-wetted membranes were employed in the aqueous phase ozonation at the same dose and time period, and the amounts of peroxide generated were compared as shown in Figure 4.5. It was found during the first 45 minutes that the dry membranes had a little lower peroxide concentration than the pre-wetted ones, but the difference was small. After 45 minutes, the peroxide concentrations of the dry membranes were higher than those of the pre-wetted ones. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the pre-wetted samples had a higher probability of the surface making contact with the
72

oxide groups (·OH, dissolved O3) in water when the reaction started. After some time during which oxidation occurred, the surface hydrophilicity of the dry samples improved, and both the hydroxyl radicals and the dissolved ozone were able to make contact with the surface of the PPMM samples; and thus the reaction speed increased.

Because the difference in peroxide concentrations was small for the ozonation time of 15-45 minutes (which was used for graft polymerization) and the removal of the IPA that was present in the pre-wetting membrane cannot be assured to be 100%, in order to avoid introducing impurities into the ozonation phase, only the dry membranes were used in the subsequent tests.

4.1.4 Ozone dose test Different ozone doses were used in the aqueous phase to compare the peroxide concentration generated. The results are shown in Figure 4.7. Results indicated that as long as

73

the ozonation time multiplied the ozone concentration were equal, the peroxide concentrations came out almost the same. Based on these results, the 3.0 wt% ozone was arbitrarily selected for the ozonation in all of this research.

4.1.5 Scavenger test It is well known that ozone self-decomposes in water to form hydroxyl radical (Beltran, 2000; Gottschalk, 2000; Hewes et al., 1971). In the aqueous phase, both molecular ozone and free radicals are present. In order to find whether both of them contributed to the generation of peroxide, radical scavenger tests were conducted. Radical scavengers are chemicals that capture the radicals generated during the reaction (Bruice et al., 2004; Murakami et al., 2005). The results of the scavenger test are shown in Figure 4.8. 3g/L sodium carbonate was added to the distilled water to eliminate the free radicals. It was demonstrated that both the hydroxyl radicals and the ozone molecules contributed to the oxidation. The free radicals were responsible for 10-25% (The peroxide concentration was

74

reduced from 1.401 to 1.067 mmol/m2, or 24%, at 90 min of ozonation; and to 12.30% after 15 min of ozonation.) of the contribution to the peroxide generation, and the percentage of free radicals increased with ozonation time.

4.1.6 pH test It is known that aqueous ozonation reactions are affected by pH level. The effect of pH on ozonation to organic solute (dissolved in waste water) and ozone decay have been broadly investigated by other researchers at different pH ranges, the results came out different in reaction order by different researcher (Table 2.5 in Section 2.3.2 showed the reported reaction orders for the decay rate of ozone). It is necessary to investigate the pH effect on the ozonation of membranes and films (not dissolved in water) to find the reaction trend. In this research the pH range for PPMM ozonation was 3.0 to 10.0, as adjusted by 1M H2SO4 and
75

1M NaOH. As shown in Figure 4.9, the peroxide concentration varies with pH. In general peroxide generation slightly decreased with pH. Then different ozonation times were used with pH of 2.3 and 10.0. It was demonstrated in Figure 4.10 that at a lower pH environment, there was a higher peroxide content generated. Conducting ozonation at different pH levels yielded information about reaction mechanisms. For example, as shown in Section 2.3.2, Beltran et al. found that the rate of ozone decomposition reaction noticeably grew as pH was raised, which was due to the catalyzing effect of the hydroxide ions ­ OH­. The mechanism includes a chain of successive reactions yielding H2O2, O3 ­, · OH and HO2 ·radicals (Beltran, 2004). Even though the dissolved ozone concentration decreased in the higher pH environment, the generated radicals have a higher reaction activity, thus benefit the oxidation of the organic contents in the waste water. This mechanism is correct for the ozonation of dissolved organic substrates. However, the results in our research showed different trend that in regard to the peroxide generation of the membrane or film ozonation. The three oxidants in aqueous ozonation: the gaseous ozone in bubbles absorbed on the membranes and film surfaces, the dissolved molecular ozone and the free radicals from ozone decomposition in water, all contribute to the peroxide generation. However, in this study, it seems that the gaseous ozone and the dissolved molecular ozone contributed more in peroxide generation than the free radicals. Since ozone is only slightly soluble in water, the resistances to mass transfer of ozone in gaseous phase and interface are insignificant, the main resistance is in the aqueous phase. All three oxidants have to be transferred to the surfaces of membranes and films first and then they can generate peroxides. Although the radicals are stronger oxidants than the gaseous ozone and dissolved molecular ozone, their existed time, when generated from the ozone decomposition, is very short-less than 10 s (Gottschalk et al., 2000), and most of them was eliminated on the way to migrate to the membrane or film surface, only the radicals in contact with the membranes or films did the oxidation. While the molecular ozone in water can migrate to the reactive surface, and the gaseous ozone is absorbed on the surface, they have much longer life time. The slightly slow down of the peroxide generaton with pH was the overall effect of the decreased dissolved molecular ozone concentration and the increased formation of radicals from the decomposition of molecular ozone.

4.1.7 Homogeneous catalyst test ­ Cu2+ According to our group member's (Mastan E., et al., 2013) research, Cu2+ can accelerate peroxide generation on polyethylene films undergoing ozonation. The catalytic reaction applied to PPMM was investigated in this study at the 0.5 hour ozonation time and 3.0 wt% ozone gas mixture in the aqueous phase with Cu2+ ion of 0.3934 mmol/L, 0.7868 mmol/L, 1.5737 mmol/L, and 3.1473 mmol/L of CuSO4·5H2O, respectively. The concentration of generated peroxide was investigated, as shown in Figure 4.11. It was found that the 0.7868 mmol/L concentration of Cu2+ ion resulted in the highest increase in peroxide generation, and the lower (0.3934 mmol/L) and the higher concentrations (1.5737 mmol/L or 3.1473 mmol/L) of Cu2+ ion contributed positively to the peroxide generation, but the effectiveness was lower. When 1.5737 mmol/L Cu2+ (CuSO4·5H2O) were added to distilled water, and PPMM was ozonated for different time periods at 3.0 wt% ozone concentration in the aqueous phase, the results indicated that catalytic ozonation using Cu2+ increased the peroxide generation by 17.14%. Figure 4.12 shows the results (peroxide 0.5083 mmol/m2 vs 0.4340 mmol/m2 at 15 minutes). These results indicated that the concentration of Cu2+ ion could accelerate the peroxide generation for PPMM; and the concentration of Cu2+ ion that resulted in the best catalytic results was determined. Further investigation was conducted, as discussed in Section 4.18 to find the mechanism. As shown in Figure 4.12, the Cu2+ catalytic ozonation in the aqueous phase resulted in a higher concentration of peroxide than that conducted in the DW ozonation; and there was a higher peroxide generation than in the gaseous phase ozonation in the 15 and 30 minute reactions. pH value changed slightly when different concentrate of CuSO4·5H2O was added into the water. In our experiments, the pH value changed from 4.65 to 4.20 when Cu2+ concentrate changed from 0.3934 mmol/L to 3.1473 mmol/L. Therefore the pH value was not a significant factor that affected this experiment.

79

4.1.8 Investigative tests of the mechanism in homogeneous catalyst Cu2+ The author did not find any literature that indicated the mechanism in the use of Cu2+ catalyst in ozonation. The mechanism was investigated in this research, and an enhanced radical production process was indicated. 4.1.8.1 Application of scavengers to the Cu2+ catalytic ozonation Tests using the scavenger Na2CO3 in Cu2+ catalytic ozonation in the aqueous phase were conducted, 1.5737 mmol/L Cu2+ (CuSO4·5H2O) was added to distilled water, and 3.0 g/L Na2CO3 (Wu et al., 2000) was used as scavenger. The PPMM was ozonated using an ozone dose of 3.0 wt%, 10.0L/min gas flow rate for 30 minutes in the 10 L reactor. The concentration of peroxide generated is shown in Figure 4.13. It was indicated that after the scavenger was added, the peroxide generation was dropped to almost the same level no matter there was a catalyst or not. This phenomenon strongly supported our conclusion that the Cu2+ catalyzed ozonation by increasing the concentration of radicals.

A different scavenger, 0.1 mol/L t-Butanol, was also added to the Cu2+ catalytic ozonation. As shown in Figure 4.14, at 30 and 45 minutes, peroxide generation also dropped to almost the same level as that observed when Na2CO3 was used in the aqueous phase ozonation. It was confirmed by using an alternative scavenger that Cu2+ catalyzed ozonation of PPMM by increasing radical concentration.

Scavenger tests were also conducted on Cu2+ catalytic ozonation at 0 oC. In Section 2.3.2, Equation (2-10) indicated the decomposition of ozone becomes faster as temperature rises (Ershov et al., 2008). It is necessary to test if the catalytic mechanism were the same at different temperature. The same doses of ozone, catalyst, and scavenger as used in the above tests were applied, and the temperature was decreased to 0 oC. The concentration of peroxide generated is shown in Figure 4.15. It was indicated that Cu2+ catalytic ozonation again increased the peroxide generation, and the scavengers reduced the peroxide generated at 0 oC. Comparison of Figure 4.14 with Figure 4.15 also indicates that at lower temperature,

81

peroxides generated were less than that at higher temperature.

4.1.8.2 The effect of anion SO42- on the Cu2+ catalytic ozonation It was shown in Figure 4.11 that a peak concentration of Cu2+ catalyst was present in catalytic ozonation. Theoretically, when the concentration of Cu2+ catalyst increases, the peroxide concentration should continue to rise or stabilize. The reason the peroxide concentration dropped after reaching a certain level was not known, therefore, the following tests were conducted to find the answer. It is possible that the anions caused the peroxide generation to decline.

The effect of the anion SO42- (concentration from 5 x 10-4 mol/L to 5 x 10-2 mol/L, which simulated the applied SO42- concentration range in the catalyst CuSO45H2O) was investigated in aqueous phase ozonation, as shown in Figure 4.16. It was demonstrated that the higher the concentration of SO42- (Na2SO4 applied as a provider of anion SO42-), the less peroxide was generated at the same ozone dose. The explanation is hypothesized by the author to be that the anion SO42- reacted with the generated hydroxyl radicals in the same way as PO43- and CO32- did (Beltran, 2004), and thus its reactivity to generate peroxide was reduced. In Section 4.1.5, Figure 4.8 indicated that the free radicals contributed more to the peroxide generation at the longer ozonation time, the fact that the 45 minutes ozonation curve had a larger drop when the concentration of SO42- increased is in agreement with the results of Figure 4.8. The mechanism will be discussed in Section 4.6.3.1.

catalytic ozonation, different

concentrations of Na2SO4 were added for 15 and 30 minute periods to 3.0 wt% O3 and 0.7868 mmol/L Cu2+ catalytic ozonation, as shown in Figure 4.17. The peroxide generation decreased when the anion SO42- concentration increased; therefore, the negative effect of anion SO42- on the Cu2+ catalytic ozonation was confirmed.

4.1.8.3 Cu2+ catalytic ozonation at a lower temperature (0oC) In Section 2.3.2, Equation (2-10) indicated that the decomposition of ozone becomes faster as temperature rises (Beltran, 2004). A persuasive conclusion should be the outcome of tests conducted in more than one set of conditions. A low temperature Cu2+ catalytic ozonation was thus conducted at 0oC for 15- and 30-minute periods, respectively, and the investigative results are shown in Figure 4.18. The PPMM was ozonated using the same O3 dose as in Section 4.1.7; however, the temperature was set at 0oC instead of room temperature. The results indicate that Cu2+ catalytic ozonation increased the peroxide generation by
84

28.95% (from 0.2610 to 0.3391 mmol/m2 for 0.7868 mmol/L Cu2+ and 30 minutes aqueous ozonation). The concentrations of 0.3933 mmol/L, 0.7868 mmol/L, 1.574 mmol/L, and 3.933 mmol/L Cu2+ added to distilled water were also investigated. It was found that 0.7868 mmol/L of Cu2+ ion was still the optimal concentration at 0oC. As shown in Figure 4.19, Cu2+ catalytic ozonation was compared with the same ozone dose at room temperature and at 0oC, it was found that although the higher peroxide concentration was generated at higher temperature (it was indicated that the catalytic ozonation was a heat adsorption reaction as well), the two curves had the similar trend with different Cu2+ catalysis concentration, and 0.7868 mmol/L of Cu2+ ion was the optimal catalyst concentration at both temperature.

4.1.8.4 Investigation of dissolved ozone concentration in distilled water undergoing Cu2+ catalytic ozonation The increase in the amount of radicals generated by Cu2+ catalysis was demonstrated in Sections 4.1.8.1 and 4.1.8.3. How about the dissolved molecular ozone? Is the dissolved molecular ozone concentration changed by the Cu2+ catalysis? In order to investigate the dissolved ozone concentration, a standard indigo method (APHA, Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater) was employed. When potassium indigo trisulfonate reacted with ozone, the ozone attacked the central C-C bond, and the extent of the bleaching was based on the molecular absorption coefficient of ozone (Sonntag, et al., 2012). The method is to pipet 3.0 ml of prepared indigo reagent II (diluted potassium indigo trisulfonate) into a 10 ml volumetric flask and dilute to 10 ml. Prepare a volumetric flask for each sample and the blank. Pipet 1.0 ml ozone solution into the flask and shake immediately; determine the absorbance of the blank and the samples at 600 nm UV using a 1-cm cuvette (Markee et al., 2009; Appendix IV). The concentration of

86

dissolved ozone in the aqueous ozonation and in the copper catalytic ozonation was measured, as shown in Table 4.1. The results demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the concentration of dissolved ozone in the non-catalyzed aqueous ozonation and the catalytic ozonation, and that the ozone concentration was not the factor that caused the difference in the amount of peroxide generated in the distilled water ozonation and the catalytic ozonation.

In accordance with J. Carell Morris' 1988 study, the solubility c*(O3)a of ozone versus temperature (T) is characterized by the following equation, when the temperature decreased, the ozone solubility increased:

log10 c* (O3 ) a  0.25  0.013T

(4-1)

Thus the dissolved ozone concentration should be higher at 0oC than at room temperature, as is demonstrated in Table 4.2. The copper catalytic ozonation at room temperature and at 0oC was conducted and the results showed that the concentration of ozone in water was higher at 0oC than at room temperature. While peroxide generation was much lower at 0oC than at room temperature, the higher ozone concentration led to the lower peroxide generation at 0oC. The explanation is that peroxide generation is a heat absorption reaction, and the temperature effect was more significant than that of dissolved ozone concentration. It was also reported by Dasgupta et al. (1990) that peroxide generation was higher at 60oC than at room temperature during polypropylene slurry ozonation. The higher the temperature is, the faster the reaction.

The ozone solution (at 25min and 35 min ozonation time, respectively) at 0oC was scanned by UV from wavelength 200 nm to 320 nm. The results showed that the dissolved ozone concentration had no change with or without Cu2+ catalysis. As shown in Figures 4.20 and 4.21 of the UV scan charts, both ozone peaks with or without copper catalyst, which occurred at 258 nm, were the same. The peaks from 200 nm to 250 nm varied considerably, and this indicated that the intermediates in the aqueous phase ozonation with or without copper catalyst were different.

4.1.8.5 Hydroxyl radical capture by Nitrobenzene applied to ozonation with or without Cu2+ catalyst In Section 4.1.8.1, the scavengers' effect on ozonation with/without Cu2+ catalyst was investigated, and the radicals were found to be the factor in the catalytic ozonation that increased the peroxide generation. Generally, hydroxyl radicals were assumed to be those generated as intermediates for ozone reaction with organic chemicals in waste water (Beltran, 2004). A method of special radical capture is necessary to further confirm the existence of the radicals for ozonation of PPMM. Nitrobenzene (NB) is a chemical for capturing the hydroxyl radicals. The author referred to Feng et al. 2011's "Experimental Determination of Hydroxyl Radical Reactivity in Supercritical Water Using Pulse Radiolysis," and applied 25 ml NB (99% purity) to 75 ml ozonation solution at different ozonation times to capture the hydroxyl radicals by forcefully shaking the flasks for 5 minutes. NB and water were separated after the capture procedure, and the samples of reacted NB were removed and tested using UV-Vis at the single wavelength of 410 nm. The addition of hydroxyl radicals to nitrobenzene forms the

89

easily detected radical Nitrohydroxycyclohexadienyl ­ OHC6H5NO2. It is detectable because of the increase in the absorbance of the product (NB itself has a light brown color, so the UV-Vis absorption was not zero at 0 min ozonation). The chemical reaction is shown in Equation (4.2) (Feng et al., 2011).

ozonation solution and was captured by the nitrobenzene, because the absorption increased as compared to that of the blank liquid. Comparison of Figure 4.22 and 4.23 shows that catalytic ozonation did generated more hydroxyl radicals.

4.1.9 Homogeneous catalyst test using Fe3+ Another metal ion, Fe3+ (ferric sulfate), also can be used as a homogeneous catalyst and can accelerate the peroxide generation on polyethylene film (Pastel et al., 2009). What would the result be if Fe3+ was applied to PPMM? In these experiments, Fe3+ catalyst was applied to PPMM, as shown in Figure 4.24. Specifically, 0.0616 mmol/L, 0.3696 mmol/L, 0.6160 mmol/L, and 3.6959 mmol/L of Fe3+ were added to the aqueous phase ozonation at 3.0 wt% O3 for 30 minutes. It was found that both 0.3696 mmol/L and 0.6160 mmol/L of Fe3+ made satisfatory contribution to the peroxide generation. 3.6959 mmol/L Fe3+ accelerated the peroxide generation rate, but the increase was smaller than that of 0.3696 & 0.6160 mmol/L. The high concentration of Fe3+ (3.6959 mmol/L) had a decreasing effect on the peroxide generation rate due to the high concentration of SO42- anions. pH value was measured from 3.8 to 2.2 when Fe3+ concentrate varied from 0.0616 mmol/L to 3.6959 mmol/L. From economic point of view, 0.3696 mmol/L of Fe3+ should be selected for practical application.

4.2 Polypropylene Film Ozonation
Biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film makes excellent packaging and medical materials. However, it is highly hydrophobic. The hydrophobic property, when it is not modified, limits its use in packaging applications that have low bonding strength to laminate with other films, and in medical applications. There are many methods that are applied to improve its hydrophilicity, and ozonation is one method that has been studied in this research. The surface area of BOPP is much smaller than that of PPMM because there are no pores, it needs to be explored whether the effect of ozonation is the same or not. The peroxide concentration of BOPP ozonation was detected much less than that of PPMM, but there are many similar characteristics shared by BOPP and PPMM, which will be discussed in the following sections.

4.2.1 Ozonation of BOPP in the aqueous and gaseous phases Referring to my M.A.Sc thesis (Gu, H., 2008), BOPP films were ozonated in the
92

aqueous (distilled water) and in the gaseous phase, respectively, to compare the efficiency of ozonation in different reaction media. The ozonation conditions were as follows: ozone concentration 3.0 wt%, gas flow rate 10.0 L/min, pressure 103.4 kPa (15 psig), room temperature 22oC. Figure 4.25 shows the results. Peroxide generation increased with ozonation time regardless of whether the ozonation was conducted in the aqueous or the gaseous phase. When the same ozone dose was applied, the detected peroxide concentration generated by aqueous phase ozonation was a little lower than that generated by gaseous phase ozonation.

4.2.2 Washing test A washing test was applied to the ozonated BOPP films immediately after degasing. To wash the BOPP that had been ozonated in the gaseous phase and the aqueous phase, 10% (v/v) IPA (used to increase the wetting of the BOPP in DW) in distilled water was employed for 15 minutes respectively. The peroxide concentration was analyzed and compared with that of the BOPP that had not undergone the washing test. It was found that the peroxide concentration of the BOPP that undergone the gaseous phase ozonation decreased to a lower level after washing than that of its aqueous counterpart which had been treated with the same ozone dose and for the same treatment time, as shown in Figure 4.26 and 4.27. This outcome was the same as for the ozonated PPMM. Ozonation broke the polypropylene chains and generated small oxidized molecules with peroxide moieties. However, the small oxidized molecules with peroxide moieties made no contribution to the graft polymerization and dissolved or were removed either by the distilled water in the aqueous phase ozonation or in the AAm IPA solution during the graft polymerization, or they were removed during the cleaning procedure. The results of this test supported the supposition that the aqueous phase ozonation could initiate more AAm graft polymerization than the gaseous phase ozonation, because the peroxide on the large polymer molecules was retained on the membranes and was effective in grafting monomers, even though the detected peroxide concentration was lower.

4.2.3 Peroxide aging test of BOPP To study the peroxide stability on the BOPP film, ozonated BOPP films were tested after 1 day, 3 days, 14 days, and 28 days using the iodometric method, and the results are shown in Figure 4.28. The peroxide concentration decreased slowly from 0-3 days; it maintained 95.7% activity after three days, and still kept about 60% activity after 4 weeks. The results indicate that active points were fairly stable for graft polymerization.

4.2.4 Scavenger test A radical scavenger test was conducted on the aqueous phase ozonation applied to BOPP film. The results of the tests are shown in Figure 4.29. To eliminate the free radicals, 3.0 g/L sodium carbonate was added to the distilled water. It was found that the generated peroxide concentration was much lower when the scavenger was added. The results indicate that the maximum contribution to the peroxide generation made by the free radicals in this test was 24% (0.0952 mmol/m2 vs. 0.0726 mmol/m2 at 30 min ozonation).

4.2.5 pH test Ozonation of BOPP film at different pH levels was investigated using the same ozone dose (3.0 wt%) and reaction time (30 minutes), and the peroxide concentration was found to decrease when pH value increased, as shown in Figure 4.30. The reaction kinetics is the combination of reactions with gas ozone, dissolved molecular ozone and radicals, and was affected by their concentration, diffusion and life time as discussed previously in Section 4.1.6 for pH test of PPMM ozonation.

The mechanism is discussed in Section 4.6.3.2.

4.3 Graft Polymerization
Although peroxides have been generated, their accessibility to monomers still needs to be evaluated. Therefore, graft polymerization was conducted in the following sections; the results were induced by aqueous and gaseous phase ozonation and compared. The samples were employed a cleaning procedure after graft polymerization with DW and acetone in the incubator shaker, the homopolymers were removed.

4.3.1 Graft polymerization and FTIR analysis Graft polymerization of different monomers induced by peroxides was investigated, dried samples were analyzed by FTIR, and the results were compared.

4.3.1.1 Acrylic amide (AAm) grafted to PPMM and FTIR analysis Ozonated membranes were dried and degassed under vacuum for 2 hours, then immersed in the N2 purged and degassed 20% AAm IPA solution (Yuan et al., 2003), the graft polymerization was conducted at 80oC and 120 rpm in a water bath for 20 hours (different
99

grafting time was tested, 20 hours was found a suitable time to obtain more graft polymerization instead of homo-polymerization). The washed and dried samples were sent for FTIR analysis. The functional groups on the film surfaces were then characterized by FTIR. Figures 4.32 and 4.33 show the FTIR spectra of the virgin and grafted membranes ozonated in aqueous and gaseous phases, and Figure 4.34 shows the comparison of the FTIR spectra after aqueous and gaseous ozonation and AAm grafting. After the AAm graft polymerization, a strong peak appeared at 1668 cm­1, and a weak, wide peak appeared at 3200-3400 cm­1. The peak at 1668 cm­1 is the characteristic frequency of the C-N amide group, and the peak at 3347 cm­1 is the characteristic frequency of N-H (Wu et al., 2000; Yong et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2003). According to Figure 4.34, it is evident that the characteristic peaks were larger for A15 + AAm (A15 = 15 minutes of aqueous phase ozonation, AAm = acrylic amide graft) than for G15 + AAm (G15 = 15 minutes of gaseous phase ozonation), which indicated that the degree of AAm grafting was greater for the membrane samples ozonated in aqueous phase than their counterparts ozonated in gaseous phase at the same ozone dose. The results shown in Figure 4.32 and 4.33 also demonstrate that the peroxides generated by ozonation were accessible to AAm monomers. 1-PPMM virgin

Fig 4.35 Chemical reaction schematic of AAm graft onto PPMM

The graft chemical reaction schematic in Figure 4.35 shows that the peroxide on PPMM backbone molecules decomposed to R·, or ROO· radicals (Razumovskii et al., 1971) (R- alkyl) when heated, the radicals induced the radical polymerization when they came into contact with the vinyl part of the AAm monomers; the double bond was broken by the radicals and further chain reaction occurred, and thus propagating the reaction. The reaction terminated when the radicals hit other radicals R·, ROO· or HO·, and the radicals combined.

4.3.1.2 Polyethylene glycol (PEG) grafted to PPMM and FTIR analysis Another monomer was also used to test the accessibility of peroxide sites. Ozonated and dried membranes were immersed in the N2 purged and degassed 20% PEG200, PEG600, and PEG 3350 solution, respectively, where the numbers represented molecular weight of PEG; graft polymerization was conducted at 55oC and 120 rpm in a water bath shaker, and the membranes were left for 20 hours. The washed and dried samples were sent for FTIR analysis, where the functional groups on the film surfaces were characterized. Figure 4.36 shows the FTIR spectra. A strong peak appeared at 1706 cm­1 (C=O group), and a weak, wide peak appeared at 3200 cm­1 (O-H group) (Davidson et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2005) after graft polymerization using PEG. Figure 4.36, with the characteristic peaks, which were larger

102

and deeper for the samples grafted by PEG200, showed that the monomer PEG200 was able to access the active points of the ozonated membranes easily; PEG600 was less able, and PEG3350 was the least able. These results indicate that the larger the monomer size of the PEG, the harder it was for it to access the reactive points. The mechanism of PEG graft polymerization was different from AAm graft polymerization, the hydroxyl groups of PEG could react with the generated carbonyl and carboxyl groups.

4.3.1.3 AAm grafedt to BOPP and FTIR analysis The same reaction conditions as Section 4.3.1.1 were used, and ozonated PPMM was replaced by BOPP. The washed and dried samples were sent for FTIR analysis. The functional groups on the film surfaces were then characterized. The FTIR results of polypropylene films ozonated by different ozonation time were reported by Gu (2008) in

the master thesis. Figure 4.37 shows the FTIR spectra of the ozonated and AAm grafted BOPP in the aqueous phase with different ozonation times; Figure 4.38 shows the FTIR spectra comparison of the films for which AAm graft polymerization was induced by aqueous and gaseous phases' ozonation. A strong peak appeared at 1706 cm­1 (C=O group) and a weak, wide peak appeared at 3200-3400 cm­1 (O-H group) after grafting with AAm. From Figure 4.37, the characteristic peaks, which became larger and deeper as ozonation time increased, showed that the grafting of the monomer AAm to the film was greater when there was a longer ozonation time, which resulted in the existence of more active points on the film for the AAm to graft to.

4.3.2 Graft degree Graft degree is the weight change ratio after the graft polymerization, which is a percentage of the increased weight after graft polymerization (Equation 2.41). Therefore, the graft degree indicates the amount of monomer/oligomer grafting.

4.3.2.1 Graft degree of PPMM The weights of the virgin and grafted membranes were determined, and the graft degree was calculated as shown in Table 4.3. The results show that the average graft degree
105

(two replicas for each test) was from 2.55% to 3.75% of these monomers' grafting induced by the ozonation (3.0 wt% ozone and 15- minute ozonation time). The AAm had slightly higher graft degree than the PEG had.

4.3.2.2 Graft degree of BOPP The weights of the virgin and graft BOPP films were checked, and the graft degree were calculated as shown in Table 4.4. The results showed that the average graft degree (two sample replicas did for each test) was from 2.33% to 3.26% of the monomer AAm graft induced by the ozonation (3.00 wt% ozone and 18- and 45-minute ozonation times). This demonstrated a correlation between the graft degree and the ozonation time.

4.3.3 Contact angle test Contact angle measurement is the method to measure the surface tension. When the contact angle is low, the hydrophilicity of substrate is high.

4.3.3.1 Contact angle of the AAm grafted PPMM As shown in Table 4.5, both the aqueous and gaseous phases' ozonation decreased the contact angle of PPMM, AAm graft polymerization enhanced this trend, the maximum decrease of the contact angle reduced from 126.9o to 92.2o by 20 minutes aqueous phase's ozonation plus AAm graft polymerization. The tested result of contact angle by the gaseous phase's ozonation was larger than that by the aqueous phase ozonation at the same ozone dose, and the contact angle of AAm grafted PPMM by the aqueous phase's ozonation was smaller than that by the gaseous phase's ozonation. The data indicated that hydrophilicity improved more by the aqueous ozonation and AAm graft polymerization, the aqueous phase
106

ozonation was more effective.

The data indicated t hat hydrophilicity improved more by the aqueous ozonation and HEMA graft polymerization, the aqueous phase's ozonation is more effective.

4.3.4 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis English physicists Sir W.H. Bragg and his son Sir W.L. Bragg developed a relationship in 1913 to explain why the cleavage faces of crystals appear to reflect X-ray beams at certain angles of incidence (theta, ). Bragg's Law shows that n  =2dsin. The variable d is the distance between atomic layers in a crystal, and the variable lambda  is the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam; n is an integer (a whole number of wavelengths  for the pathway). This observation is an example of X-ray wave interference, commonly known as X-ray diffraction (Nuffield, 1966). The broad feature in the 14­30°2 region remains for all the samples, XRD peaks of

polypropylene appear at 5 values in 2 region 14.25­28.75° . Results of diffractogram peaks' counts, as shown in Figure 4.39, indicated that ozonation decreased the surface crystallinity of PPMM and increased the amorphicity, and crystalline decreased with ozonation time (the higher counts represented the high crystallinity). This phenomenon is very similar to the results of Michael et al. (2004) for the polyester fabrics. Results of diffractogram peaks' counts, as shown in Figure 4.3 9, Figure 4.40, and Figure 4.41 indicate that ozonation decreased the crystalline, while AAm graft increased the crystalline. AAm grafted membranes by the aqueous phase ozonation had the largest crystalline increase (Graft degree of A15+AAm was 3.75%, the peak count was about 3600 correlated to the large XRD peak of grafted PPMM). Unlike small molecules, such as metal or methane, which is either totally crystalline or totally amorphous, polymer molecules are often only partially crystalline due to their sizes, having crystalline regions dispersed within the amorphous material. The small crystalline regions have a precise alignment. These crystals can be regularly shaped as thin platelets, and form multilayer structure, or form spherulites. Any chain disorder or misalignment will result in an amorphous region (Callister, 2006). The ozonation inserted oxygen atoms into chain molecules or broke the chains on the surfaces, disordered the chain, thus decreased the crystalline. AAm itself can be totally crystallized. When grafted onto the surfaces, AAm made the molecule chains of polymer easy to crystallize, therefore increased the crystalline. The brought in different atoms by ozonation or graft polymerization changed some molecules' status, thus shifted the peak a little.

4.4 Protein Adsorption and Filtration Flux Test
Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma, USA) was used as a model protein to evaluate the protein fouling characteristics of virgin and grafted membranes. The membranes were soaked in IPA for 1 min for pre-wetting and washed with 500 ml of distilled water for 5 minutes, then fixed to the flux test device, as shown in Figure 3.5. A BSA solution with a concentration of 1000 mg/L, and pH adjusted to 6.9 with a 0.1M phosphate buffer, was used for the filtration test (Hu et al., 2008; Wang et al., 1999). The initial pumping pressure of the solution was set at 10 psig and adjusted to maintain this pressure, and the filtration of 900-1000 ml of solution was run till the permeate flow declined to a very low number. The DW back flush (back flush applied to move the cake layer and absorption fouling) pressure was set at 20 psig and maintained at this pressure, and the amount of DW used was 600 ml. The solution permeate weights of the membranes were recorded every 5 seconds. The recorded weights of the modified membranes were calculated along with flow rate and plotted against time, then compared to that of the virgin membrane. The results were
111

presented in the following paragraphs.

4.4.1 AAm grafted PPMM As described in Section 3.4.4.1, the dead-end filtration test was applied to the AAm grafted PPMM, and the permeate flow rate versus time (shown in Figure 4.42) was compared to that of virgin PPMM. It was found that the aqueous phase ozonation and AAm grafting resulted in the PPMM having a higher permeate flow rate, and the permeate flow rate of this modified membrane kept higher comparing to the gaseous counterpart and virgin PPMM during the BSA filtration test. A18 = 18 minutes of aqueous phase ozonation; G18 = 18 minutes of gaseous phase ozonation; AAm = AAm graft polymerization. The back flush was implemented by reversing the fouled membranes and using DW to flush the membrane with 600 ml of permeate and double the pressure (20 psig) of the BSA filtration. The cleaned membranes were then used in the second filtration test using BSA solution. The chart of permeate versus time is shown in Figure 4.43. The aqueous phase ozonated and AAm grafted membrane was found to have the best recovery of permeate flow rate, a 84% (1.47 ml/s ÷ 1.75 ml/s) permeate flow rate was recovered after the back flush; while the gaseous phase ozonated and AAm grafted membrane was found to have the permeate flow rate recovery of 82% (1.27 ml/s ÷ 1.54 ml/s); the virgin membrane was found to have the least permeate flow rate recovery of 52% (0.58 ml/s ÷ 1.1 ml/s). These results indicated that the aqueous phase ozonated and AAm grafted membrane had the least absorption fouling-the improved hydrophilicity repelled the BSA absorption, and it was found easier for this modified membrane to clean by back flush, thus it had a longer life time and a better anti-fouling property. The explanation for the phenomenon, which the membrane with higher permeate flow rate had a faster flow rate dropping, is that the cake layer piled up faster when more solution was filtered by the membrane.

4.4.2 PEG grafted PPMM Different PEG grafted PPMM were used to test filtration through the dead-end filtration device, as shown in Figure 4.44. The PEG200 and PEG600 modified membranes had the best permeate flow rates, and the PEG3350 modified PPMM also had a better permeate flow rate than the virgin PPMM, which indicate that the PEG grafting improved the anti-fouling property of PPMM. It was found from Figure 4.44 that the PEG200 grafted PPMM had the biggest permeate flow rate -around 3.0 ml/s, while the PEG3350 modified PPMM had the least improvement, which indicated that the PEG200 modified PPMM had the best anti-fouling property to BSA solution. The reason is that the PEG200 modified PPMM had a lower contact angle, as shown in Table 4.7 at Section 4.3.3.3, thus its hydrophilicity was improved more. Another reason could be that PEG 3350 has a larger molecular size than PEG200 and PEG600, and was easier to block the pores, or reduced the pore size, when it grafted onto the PPMM surface or inside the pores. The flow rate of virgin PPMM was a little different from that showed in Section 4.4.1, because the BSA is a protein, the molecule size and filtration condition can vary a little. The comparison of filtration in the same section was conducted using the same BSA solution, while BSA solution was freshly made in different sections.

4.4.3 HEMA grafted PPMM HEMA grafted PPMM were used to test filtration through the dead-end filtration device, as shown in Figure 4.45. HEMA grafted membranes had a higher permeate flow rate than virgin PPMM, which indicate the HEMA grafting improved the anti-fouling property of PPMM.

4.4.4 Catalytic grafted PPMM PPMM with AAm geafted after ozonation either in the presence of 0. 05 g/L (0.7868 mmol/L) Cu2+catalyst or 0.1 g/L (1.574 mmol/L) Fe3+ catalyst was used for filtration through the dead-end filtration device, and compared with virgin PPMM. As shown in Figure 4.46, PPMM with AAm grafted had a higher permeate flow rate than virgin PPMM. It is confirmed experimentally in this study that modification of PPMM by ozonation and grafting monomers, such as AAm, PEG, and HEMA, did improve the hydrophilicity of PPMM surfaces, thus the anti-fouling property was improved. Furthermore, the PEG200 grafted PPMM showed the largest permeate flow rate, which indicated that it had the best hydrophilicity improvement. Catalyzed ozonation helped the AAm grafting polymerization, and got a larger permeate flow rate of BSA solution than the non-catalyzed counterpart.

4.4.5 Formula of filtration flux and fouling In filtration tests, the flux formula for pore blockage and cake layer combination fouling, refer to Equation 2.53, in which the relationship of flow rate (g/s) and filtration time (s) is represented by the following equation (Kilduff et al., 2005):

Q = Q o [exp (-

 b PC f
Rm

t) +

 b PC f Rm t )) ] × (1 ­ exp (Rm  R c Rm

where Q is the permeate flow rate, and other parameters were defined in Section 2.6.3

Therefore,

Q = Qo [

The permeate flow rate with time is a complex exponential relationship. The k1, k2, k3 can be calculated out from Figures 4.4.2 to 4.4.6 by using a certain computer program, this project will be left for further study.

4.5 SEM Images
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is an instrument used to observe surface morphology and get images of a larger magnification by electron scanning of the surface.

4.5.1 SEM images of AAm grafted PPMM The surface morphology of the PPMM before and after AAm graft polymerization
117

was observed using SEM. Figure 4.47 shows the SEM images of virgin, ozonated, and AAm-grafted PP membranes at 5000x magnification. It can be observed that ozonation changed the morphology of the membranes. In Figures 4.47d and 4.47e, one can see AAm grafted on the surface and in the pores of the PPMM, which modified its hydrophilicity. The AAm-grafted PPMM by aqueous phase ozonation had clearer pores and less blocking in the images than that grafted by gaseous phase ozonation.

4.5.2 SEM images of the BSA filtration test for PPMM grafted by AAm The surface morphology of PPMM before and after AAm graft polymerization and the protein (BSA) filtration test was observed using SEM. Figure 4.48 shows the SEM images of virgin, gaseous and aqueous phase ozonated, and AAm-grafted PP membranes at 300x magnification. As shown in Figures 4.48a, 4.48b, and 4.48c, BSA fouled the surfaces of virgin, G18 + AAm, and A18 + AAm PP microfiltration membranes. Figures 4.48d, 4.48e, and 4.48f show washed* BSA fouled virgin, G18 + AAm, and A18 + AAm PP microfiltration

membranes. The cake layer fouling was removed and the pores can be seen clearly after the fouled AAm grafted membranes have been washed (Figures 4.38e and 4.38f), while the pores of the unmodified membranes were barely visible after the same treatment (Figure 4.48d). These images indicate that AAm grafting improved the anti-fouling property of the membranes, and the aqueous phase ozonation followed by AAm grafting improved it the most. *Wash method: the membranes were soaked in DW and the surfaces were abraded 3 times using a clean, wetted napkin.

4.5.3 SEM images of BOPP after AAm graft polymerization The surface morphology of BOPP before and after AAm graft polymerization was observed using the SEM. Figure 4.49 shows the SEM images of virgin, ozonated, and AAm-grafted PP film at 5000x magnification. It was observed in Figures 4.49b and 4.49c

119

(two different areas of the same sample) that the AAm graft covered the entire surface of the BOPP film after 45 minutes of the aqueous phase ozonation induced reaction; while in Figures 4.49d and 4.49e (two different areas of the same sample), only points of the AAm graft were observed on the BOPP film after 45 minutes of the gaseous phase ozonation induced reaction. The greater covering of AAm graft polymers indicates that the reaction induced by the aqueous phase ozonation was more effective than that of the gaseous phase counterpart. The images show that radical graft polymerization occurred on the active points and propagated to an irregular shaped mass (images 4.49d and 4.49e), and grew to a layer that completely covered the film surface when the amounts of active points available and reaction time were sufficient (Figures 4.49b and 4.49c).

4.5.4 SEM images of the BSA adsorption test on BOPP The surface morphology of the protein (BSA) adsorption test on BOPP before and after AAm graft polymerization was observed with SEM. Figure 4.50 shows the SEM images of virgin, gaseous and aqueous phase ozonated, and AAm-grafted BOPP films at 5000x

magnification. As shown in Images a, b, and c of Figure 4.50, BSA adsorbed on the surface of all of the BOPP films ­ virgin, G45 + AAm, and A45 + AAm. It was observed that the AAm grafted films had the least adsorption of protein, indicating that the higher the hydrophilicity of the membrane, the less adsorptive it is. The AAm graft polymerization induced by ozonation improved the hydrophilicity and reduced the protein adsorption property.

The surface morphology of the protein (BSA) adsorption test of BOPP before and after the AAm or PEG grafting was observed using SEM. Figure 4.51 shows the SEM images at 30x magnification. As shown in Images a, b, c, and d of Figure 4.51, BSA adsorbed on the surfaces of AAm, PEG200, PEG600 and PEG3350 grafted BOPP. It was further observed that the PEG3350 grafted film had the least adsorption of protein on the surface.

From results of the filtration of PPMM membrane modified by PEG grafting, as shown in Figure 4.44, the BSA permeate rate of PEG200, PEG600 and PEG3350 grafted membranes was improved compared to that of the virgin membrane. The PEG200 grafted PPMM had the largest permeate flow rate, which indicated that the PEG200 had the best access to graft on membrane surface and pores. The filtration result is different from that of absorption, while PEG3350 grafted PPMM showed a less protein absorbed on the surface. It is possible that the size of PEG3350 hindered its grafting into the membrane surfaces and pores, therefore, the PPMM grafted with PEG3350 does not have the hydrophilicity as good as that grafted with PEG200. Although the grafting of PEG3350 was not as good as PEG200
121

on the PPMM surface, the larger size of molecule could exclude more absorption of protein.

4.6 Discussion of the Mechanism and Reaction Models
The mechanism and reaction models of ozonation, ozonation with scavengers, catalytic ozonation, graft polymerization, filtration flux and fouling are discussed in the following sections.

4.6.1 Kinetics of ozonation of membrane and film surfaces The ozonation process in aqueous phase consists of direct and indirect reactions which can occur at the same time. An oxidation model of compound M can be described as the sum of the two reaction pathways as follows (Gottschalk et al., 2000):

-

dc( M ) = [kD c(O3) + kR c(OH· )]C(M) dt

(4-6)

122

where M: model compound kD: reaction rate constant for the direct reaction kR: reaction rate constant for the indirect reaction

Fig 4.52 Schematic of ozone reacting with PPMM in the aqueous phase

i) The peroxide generation equation. As shown in Figure 4.52, in this research ozone reacts with PPMM/BOPP in the aqueous phase in three ways: 1. Gaseous ozone in gas bubbles ­ c(O3)g; 2. Dissolved ozone ­ c(O3)a; 3. OH·radicals generated in water ­ c(OH· ). c(O3)g is held constant by controlling the gas feed (assuming the gas bubbles hit and leave the surfaces of PPMM at a constant rate). c(O3)a and c(OH· ) are related to ozone dissolving and decomposition.

For RH + O3

ROOH in the aqueous phase reaction in this research, it was

assumed that the gaseous ozone, dissolved ozone, and generated OH·all contributed to the peroxide generation. The ozonation of polypropylene membrane and films can be described as:

dc( Per ) dc( M ) =()= c(M) [kg c(O3)g + ka c(O3)a + kR c(OH· )] dt dt

(4-7)

123

where c(Per) is the concentration of generated peroxide; kg, ka, and kR are the reaction constants of gas ozone, molecular ozone in water, and hydroxyl radicals, respectively;  is a constant; and c(M) is the reactive molecule concentration of the PPMM & BOPP surface, which is related to the material of the sample pieces. ii) Ozone concentration in a non reaction gas-liquid system. Henry's Law is stated as:

xA 

PA H

where x : moles solute ­ A/mole solution
A

P : partial pressure of A
A

H: Henry's Law Constant

Interpreting this formula for gaseous ozone dissolved (ozone solubility) in water gives,

c*(O3)a =

P(O3 ) g H

(4-8)

Assume ozone is an ideal gas, and according to the Ideal Gas Law:

P(O3)g  R T c (O3 ) g

(4-9)

Combination of Equation (4-8) and (4-9) gives,

c*(O3)a =

RT c(O3 ) g H

(4-10)

where R is the Ideal Gas Constant, T is the temperature in K.

iii) Ozone concentration in a gas-liquid system with reaction. Refer to Equation

124

(2-16) in Section 2.3.2 "Decomposition of ozone in water and pH effect", when the ozone gas mixture (O2 and O3) is continuously fed into the reactor, assume the gas and water phases are perfectly mixed, according to the hypothesis of perfect mixing, a molar balance of ozone in the water leads to the following equation (Beltran, 2004):

dc(O3 ) a  k L a [c * (O3 ) a  c(O3 ) a ]  k1c(O3 ) a dt

(4-11)

where kLa and k1 are the volumetric mass-transfer coefficient through the water phase and the rate constant of the ozone reaction (in pure water, the reaction is decomposition), respectively, c*(O3)a is the ozone solubility, also is the interface concentration. In a well-agitated tank, the concentration of dissolved ozone increases with time until it reaches a stationary value, at this time,

dc(O3 ) a  0 , thus dt

k L a [c* (O3 ) a  c(O3 ) a ]  k1c(O3 ) a  0

Therefore

c(O3 ) a 

k L a c * (O3 ) a (k L a  k1 )

(4-12)

Combination of Equation (4-10) with Equation (4-12) gives,

c(O3 ) a 

k L a RT c(O3 ) g = c(O3)g H (k L a  k1 )

(4-13)

 =

k L a RT is constant when the ozone gas is fed in continuously at constant H ( k L a  k1 )

temperature.

125

iv) Hydroxyl radical concentration in the aqueous solution. As shown in Equations (2-6)­(2-9) (Beltran, 2004) and Equations (2-38)­(2-42) (Staehelln et al., 1982), the principal reactions of O3 in water to generate hydroxyl radicals are as follows:

O3 + OHHO2- + O3 ·O2- + O3 ·O3- + H2O

HO2- + O2 ·O2- + OH·+ O2 ·O3 - + O2 HO- + OH·+ O2

To sum up the principal reactions, OH·was generated by the following reaction

3 O3 + H2O

k

OH

2 OH·+ 4O2

while OH· was consumed by the following paths

OH·+ R-H OH·+ S ks

kd

R·+ H2O inactive molecules

where R-H is the substrate used to generate peroxide, and S is the scavenger or radical terminator, kd is the reactive constant of direct reaction, ks is the reactive constant of hydroxyl radicals with scavenger or terminator. R·will react continually with ozone, oxygen and the polymer molecules to obtain oxygen and hydrogen, and reconstruct to peroxide.

The generated and eliminated OH·were in equilibrium:

kd c(OH· ) c(M) + ks c(OH· ) c(S) =

2 kOH c(O3)a 3

c(OH· )=

2kOH c(O3)a 3[k d c( M )  k s c( S )]

126

The scavenger in the system is negligible:

c(OH· )

2kOH c(O3)a 3k d c( M )

(4-14)

The combination of Equations (4-13) and (4-14) gives,

c(OH· )=

2kOH  C(O3)g 3k d c( M )

(4-15)

Combination of Equations (4-7), (4-13), and (4-15), and the oxidation kinetics can be described as:

dc( M ) = -c(M) [kg c(O3)g + ka c(O3)a + kR c(OH· )] dt
2kOH  C(O3)g ] 3k d c( M )

= -c(M)[kg c(O3)g + ka  C(O3)g + kR

=-[(kg + ka  + kR

2kOH )] c(O3)g c(M) 3k d

(4-16)

For PPMM ozonation when there is excess ozone with constantly feeding in:

dc( M ) = - k M c(M) dt

(4-17)

where k M = (kg+ka + kR

2kOH ) c(O3)g 3k d

Integration of Equation (4-17) yields,

127

c( M ) = exp(- k M t ) c( M o )

where c(Mo) is the active molecular concentration of polymer at beginning

c(M) = c(Mo)exp(- k M t )

(4-18)

Combination of Equations (4-7), (4-17), and (4-18) gives the ozonation model as:

dc( Per ) dc( M ) = [] = k M c(M) =  k M c(Mo)exp(- k M t ) dt dt

Integration of the above equation gives,



c ( per )

0

dc( Per )   [k M c( M o ) exp( k M t )] dt
0

t

c(Per) = c(Mo)[1-exp(-kMt)]

(4-19)

This is the mathematical model of the aqueous phase ozonation of PPMM, which is an exponential relationship between the peroxide concentration and ozonation time. Comparing this equation to Equation 2.49 that was proposed by Razumovskii & Kefeli from their investigation of the mechanism of gaseous ozonation of polyethylene powder in 1971, they are in agreement, only the constant kM and  are different. Figure 4.1 showed a relationship of PPMM in the aqueous phase ozonation of c(Per)=2.7548(1-exp(-0.0081t)), thus c(Mo) =2.7548, kM=0.0081; Figure 4.25 showed a relationship of BOPP in the aqueous phase ozonation of c(Per)=0.2462(1-exp(-0.02035t)), thus c(Mo) =0.2462, kM =0.02035.

v) In the gaseous phase ozonation,

(4-20)

When ozone is in excess

dc( M ) , = - kg c(O3)g c(M) = - k M c(M) dt

(4-21)

where k M = kg c(O3)g

,

Integration of Equation (4-21) gives

This is the mathematical model of the gaseous phase ozonation, which also represents the relationship of the peroxide concentration with ozonation time, as shown in Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.25. Figure 4.1 showed a relationship of PPMM in the gaseous phase ozonation of c(Per)=5.369(1-exp(-0.0041t)), thus 'c(Mo)=5.369, kM'=0.0041; Figure 4.25 showed a relationship of BOPP in the aqueous phase ozonation of c(Per)=0.2800(1-exp(-0.01738t)), thus 'c(Mo) =0.2800, kM'=0.01738.

4.6.2 Scavengers and the mechanism Scavenger is a material that captures the free radicals. Carbonates usually acted as a scavenger (Beltran, 2004), due to the following reactions:

129

HCO 3



+ HO·

kc1  8.5  106 M 1s 1

CO3-· + H2O

(4-24)

CO 3

2

+ HO·

kc 2  3.9  108 M 1s 1

CO 3  · + OH 

(4-25)

In this study, freshly made distilled water (DW) was used, the pH was tested and maintained at 5.4, and DW was purged by the oxygen and ozone gas mixture for a certain time before the sample's ozonation started. This method removed carbon dioxide dissolved in DW, which acted as scavenger:

CO2 + H2O

H2CO 3

HCO 3



+ H+

+ 2H+

(4-26)

Tert-Butanol is another material acted as scavenger:

(4-27)

Polypropylene (RH) reacts with ozone and with the scavenger as shown in Figure 4.53. Ozone reacts with RH, creating ROOH, R· , and OH· . ROOH broke into R·and OH· when heated, and induced radical polymerization. OH·can react with RH to create R· , or can be eliminated by a scavenger.

130

Fig 4.53 The two types of reactions of ozone in aqueous solution. RH (PP) reacts with O3 and OH·yielding, respectively, ROOH and the radicals R· . Si (scavenger) captures OH·radicals yielding the byproduct  (Beltran, 2004)

Scavengers captured all the radicals generated in the ozonation solution; therefore, the ozonation model of polypropylene membrane and films (Equation 4-7) becomes:

dc( Per ) dc( M ) = "[] = " c(M) [kg c(O3)g + ka c(O3)a ] dt dt

(4-28)

Combination of Equations (4-13) and (4-28) gives,

dc( M ) =-c(M) [kg c(O3)g + kac(O3)g] dt
=-(kg+ka ) c(O3)g c(M)

(4-29)

Define k M = -(kg+ka ) c(O3)g

"

dc( M ) " =- k M c(M) dt

(4-30)

Integration of Equation (4-30) yields,

131

c(M) = c(Mo)exp(- k M t )

"

(4-31)

Combination of Equations (4-28), (4-30) and (4-31), and integration gives,

c(Per) = "c(Mo) [1-exp(-k "M t) ]

(4-32)

This is the mathematical model of the aqueous phase ozonation with scavenger. Figure 4.8 showed a relationship of PPMM in the aqueous phase ozonation with scavenger Na2CO3 of c(Per)=1.2922(1-exp(-0.0189t)), thus "c(Mo)=1.2922, kM"=0.0189; Figure 4.25 showed a relationship of BOPP in the aqueous phase ozonation with scavenger Na2CO3 of c(Per)=0.2569(1-exp(-0.0140t)), thus "c(Mo) =0.2569, kM"=0.0140.

4.6.3 The catalytic pathways 4.6.3.1 The Cu2+ catalyst mechanism Since there was no information about the mechanism of copper (II) catalyzed ozonation found in the literature, special tests were designed and conducted, and are discussed in Section 4.18.1 to Section 4.18.5 of this thesis, in which the author investigates the mechanism of copper (II) catalyzed ozonation from two perspectives: how the catalysis worked and why there was an optimum concentration of copper (II) cation. The test results demonstrated the Cu2+ boosted production of radicals and an optimal Cu2+ concentration present. It was also concluded that excess anion SO42- would have negatively affected the reaction. Based on our experimental results, two possible catalytic ozonation pathways are proposed. Pathway I: Cu (II) cation reacted with ozone to generate the intermediates CuOH2+·, HO·, and HO2·radicals (Hill, 1948), and these radicals accelerated the peroxide generation on the PP surface, as shown in Equations (4-33), (4-34), and (4-35). The radical generation was demonstrated in Section 4.1.8.5. Figure 4.54 shows the schematic that the radicals generated by Cu2+ catalyzed ozonation reacted with polypropylene and formed peroxide.

CuOH2+·+ HO2·

(4-35)

Since the enhanced radicals were demonstrated to be the pathway of catalytic ozonation, the catalytic ozonation of polypropylene membrane and films can be described as:

dc( Per ) dc( M ) =()= c(M) [kg c(O3)g + ka c(O3)a + kR' c(OH· )] dt dt

(4-36)

where kR' is a constant that all radicals contribute to the peroxide generation. The final equation can be derived as:

c(Per) = c(Mo)[1-exp(-kMct)]

(4-37)

where kMc = (kg+ka + kR'

2kOH ) c(O3)g 3k d

Fig 4.54 Peroxide generation accelerated by hydroxyl radicals

133

Pathway II: The Cu (II) cation combined with oxygen to create the third body CuO2+ and oxygen radical O2· ; CuO2+ reacted with ozone to generate two other oxygen radicals. The mechanism is assumed to be similar to that in Pathway I, as discussed in next section, Section 4.6.3.2. These radicals accelerated the peroxide generation on the polypropylene surfaces, as shown in Figure 4.55.

While the hydroxyl radicals in Cu2+ catalytic ozonation could have been affected by anions such as PO43- and CO32- (Beltran F., 2004), SO42- is assumed to have the following function: HO·+ SO42-  OH- + SO4·-

(4-38)

- SO4· could not help the peroxide creation; thus, SO42- had a negative effect on the ozonation.

The tests in Figures 4.16 and 4.17 demonstrate this phenomenon. The Cu2+ catalytic ozonation had an optimal concentration; Figure 4.11, Figure 4.18 and Figure 4.19 indicate that this optimum concentration of Cu2+ was 0.787 mmol/L. At 20oC ozone solubility is 12.86 mg/L (Table 2.3) in water. The actual concentration, obtained by the standard indigo analysis as shown in Table 4.1, was a little lower, at 9-10 mg/L at 22oC, and the number of ozone molecules of 9.12 mg/L is 1.144 × 1020 (corresponding to the Avogadro constant, mole molecule number is 6.022 × 2023); while the number of Cu2+ ions at 0.787mmol/L is 4.74 × 1020, which is also the number of SO42- ions. The best catalytic results were achieved at this ratio (by the decomposition of ozone to · OH radicals) in which the number of Cu2+ ions was almost 4 times that of ozone molecules. When the CuSO4· 5H2O concentration was increased, the increased Cu2+ could not help generate more peroxide, while the increased SO42- consumed the generated · OH radicals. On the other hand, when the CuSO4·5H2O concentration was decreased, the concentration of Cu2+ was not sufficient. Therefore, the optimum concentration of Cu2+ catalyst was shown at 0.787mmol/L. In Section 4.1.9, the concentration 0.6160 mmol/L of Fe3+ was demonstrated to have the best catalytic results; the number of Fe3+ ions per liter is 3.71 × 1020, which is in the same grade of molecule number of dissolved ozone (assume the saturated ozone concentration has
134

no significant difference between Fe3+ catalyzed solution and Cu2+ catalyzed solution). The number of Fe3+ ions was almost 3.2 times that of ozone molecules, and the best catalytic results were achieved by decomposing ozone to ·OH radicals.

4.6.3.2. Fe(III) catalyst The following reaction mechanisms are proposed pathways for ferric catalyzed ozonation.

Pathway I: The Fe3+ cation constitutes the essential third body FeO3+, the reaction rate being determined by the appropriate collision frequency, in accordance with Calderbank et al., 1976. Ozone decomposition is observed to have a low activation energy in Reaction (4-40), and O3 reacts much more rapidly than O2 does. The activation energy of this reactivation reaction is greater than that of Reaction (4-40). Reactions (4-39) and (4-40) give a total reaction as shown in Equation (4-41), in which a Fe(III) cation reacts with two O3, generating three O2·radicals, which accelerate the peroxide generation on the PP surface, as shown in Figure 4.55.

(4-39)

(4-40) (4-41)

Fig 4.55 Peroxide generation accelerated by oxygen radicals

135

Pathway II: Fe(III) cations reacted with ozone to generate intermediate FeOH3+, HO· radicals and HO2·radicals. The mechanism was similar to that of Pathway II in Equations (4-33), (4-34), and (4-35) in Section 4.6.3.1, in which these radicals accelerated the peroxide generation on PP surface, as shown in Figure 4.54.

136

Chapter 5 Conclusions
The following are the conclusions of this work: a) The results of ozonation of both polypropylene microfiltration membranes (PPMM) and commercial biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films, show that the concentration of peroxides generated on the membrane and film surfaces increased with the applied ozone dose and ozonation time in both the aqueous and gaseous phases. b) Free radicals in the aqueous ozonion were found to contribute about 20-30% to the peroxide generation, the major contribution to peroxide generation coming from the molecule ozone. c) Heavy metal ions as catalysts were investigated in this research. Copper sulfate hydrate (CuSO4· 5H2O) was added as a homogeneous catalyst in the aqueous phase ozonation, and the peroxide generation rate of PPMM was improved by 17%. Fe (III) (FeCl3· 6H2O) also was found to have a positive effect on the peroxide generation. d) Although the generated peroxide concentration of the gaseous phase ozonation was found to be a little higher than that of the aqueous phase counterpart on the substrates, the aqueous phase ozonation generated more monomer-accessible peroxide for subsequent graft polymerization. Different monomers applied to the ozonated membranes and films ­ AAm, HEMA, and PEG ­ were all shown to be accessible to the peroxide active sites, and graft polymerization of all these monomers occurred on the substrates, which was proved by FTIR spectrometry, the contact angle test, and SEM images. e) Hydrophilicity of polypropylene membranes and films was improved by graft polymerization of Acryl amide (AAm), Hydroxyethyl Methacrylate (HEMA), and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG). The hydrophilicity of PPMM was improved by graft polymerization of AAm, HEMA, and PEG initiated by the peroxides, as indicated by the contact angle reduction from 129° to 91° of grafted AAm; from 126° to 74° of grafted HEMA; and from 126°to 88°of grafted PEG. The contact angle of AAm grafted BOPP film

137

was reduced from 80°to 56° . Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometry confirmed the success of the above monomers; and the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images indicated changes in the amorphousity of the graft polymerization. The XRD diffractogram revealed the crystal changes of ozonated and grafted PPMM. f) The filtration test results demonstrated the improvement of the anti-fouling effect of the modified PPMM by using bovine serum albumin (BSA). The SEM images of the fouled and washed membranes revealed the cake layer fouling and pore blockage, and the recovery of the surface. g) The mechanisms of the aqueous and gaseous phase ozonation applied to polypropylene membranes and films were discussed. Based on the experimental results, an exponential order of peroxide generation versus time was obtained. The mechanism of the aqueous phase ozonation with scavengers added was discussed as well. Scavengers captured the radicals which generated in the aqueous phase, thus decreasing the peroxide generation speed. h) The mechanism of the aqueous phase ozonation (employed to PPMM and BOPP) with catalysts Cu2+ and Fe3+ was discussed. A third body (CuOH2+ or FeO3+) was postulated to cause intermediate and accelerated OH, HO2 or O2 radical generation, and thus increase the peroxide generation speed. Special tests were designed and executed to investigate the catalytic mechanism of copper (II) in ozonation. The radical pathway was found in the copper (II) catalyzed ozonation, and the reason for an optimal copper concentration was found. In general, by the use of homogeneous catalysts, this study further developed the aqueous ozonation into a practical and effective solution to the problem of hydrophobic surfaces of polypropylene (PP) membranes and films. This study also verified experimentally that the PP membranes and films modified in this study had improved hydrophilicity. Moreover, detailed analysis of the reaction mechanisms provided important insights of the polymer surfaces which will contribute significantly to the research of the oxidative modification of polymer surfaces. The results of this study will positively impact the industrial using of PPMM to elongate its duration time of filtration, and improve the applications of BOPP in biomedical areas.

Appendix I Calculation of titration

The hydrogen peroxide reaction with iodide in acidic medium: H2O2 (aq) + 2I- (aq) + 2H+ (aq) I2 (aq) + 2 H2O (l)

The created I2 (aq) can be investigated by the titration of a standard S2O32- (aq) solution [APHA, 1992, Iodometric Method I, pp 4-38] We assume the R-OOH has the same function as the H2O2 in this reaction, according to this formula, the consumption is:

As an example, calculate the peroxide content of HDPE reacting with ozone at 3.7%wt, 1.0 h in aqueous medium: Samples: 3 strips of 1.5" x10" HDPE film Area: 2 (sides) x 3 (strips) x (1.5 inch x 25.4 mm) x (10 inch x25.4 mm) = 58064.4 mm2 = 0.0580644 m2 0.001N standard Na2S2O32- (aq) solution titration consumption: 3.6 ml Consumption normality of S2O32-: 3.6 ml x 0.001 N = 0.0036 R-OOH normality = normality of S2O32- = 0.0036 Where Normality = molality x n (where n = the number of protons exchanged in a reaction) n = 2 in this reaction R-OOH mmol: 0.0036 ÷2 = 0.0018 R-OOH (peroxide) density: 0.0018 mmol ÷0.0580644 m2 = 0.031 mmol / m2
