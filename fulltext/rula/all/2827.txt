ABSTRACT

Acoustic impedance maps of cells can be used to gain insight into its microstructures and physiological state. Information about the cell's microstructures can be acquired from the acoustic impedance map fluctuations. The maps can also help identify the dominant scattering source in cells. Furthermore, the cell's physiological state can be inferred from the average acoustic impedance values as many physiological changes in the cell are linked to the alteration in the mechanical properties. A method called acoustic impedance imaging has been used to measure the impedance of biological tissues. We used an acoustic microscope attached to a transducer with a center frequency of 375MHz to acquire acoustic impedance images of breast cancer cells. The generated images suggest that the nucleus has an acoustic impedance similar to the surrounding cytoplasm. Fluorescence and confocal microscopy were used to correlate acoustic impedance images with the cell microstructure (the nucleus). Simulation results demonstrate the system's capability in detecting cell microstructures close to the substrate. The average acoustic impedance were used to differentiate between single-live, clustered-live and clustered-fixed cancer cells with a measured values of 1.60±0.01 MRayl, 1.61±0.02 MRayl and 1.55±0.02 MRayl respectively.

1.1 MOTIVATION

INTRODUCTION

Ultrasound became a well-accepted imaging modality in the early 1970s when the first gray-scale ultrasound image with nonlinear compression dynamic range was presented [1]. The compression reduced the dynamic range of an image, which made it possible to visualize more information about tissue structures. Later, significant progress was made to understand ultrasound interaction with tissues in more detail, which allowed for the development of new ultrasound imaging techniques. Ultrasound has several advantages over its competing imaging modalities--magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray computed tomography (CT). The three main advantages of ultrasound imaging are its ability to image tissues in real time, relative low cost and lack of harmful radiation [2]. Conventional ultrasound images are based on the analysis of the reflectivity of the tissue as a function of depth. Frequency analysis of the scattered signal is not currently used clinically. Careful analysis of the backscattered frequency spectrum has been utilized in laboratories to extract more information about tissue microstructures and physiological changes [3-7]. Three-dimensional acoustic impedance maps can be used to acquire the backscattered frequency spectrum. The main objective of this thesis is to use acoustic impedance imaging method to measure the acoustic impedance of cancer cells, and correlate them to microstructures in the cell.

1.2

DIAGNOSTIC ULTRASOUND
Ultrasound is a mechanical wave with a frequency higher than 20 kHz. It propagates

through media by the compression and rarefaction of particles. Any variations in the density or compressibility of the medium can create distortion in the ultrasound waves. The scattered
1

ultrasound waves can be detected to attain information about tissues. For example in liver steatosis, a condition where the lipid level in liver cells increases, a change in effective density occurs due to fat deposits in liver cells. This can be detected ultrasonically, through an increase in the backscattered signal [8]. Cirrhosis can also be detected ultrasonically [9]. Cirrhosis is the loss of liver function due to the replacement of liver tissue by connective tissue. Connective tissue has different mechanical properties, which enable distinction between a normal and a diseased liver. In the kidney, ultrasound can detect inflammatory, vascular and infiltration problems [10]. Another use of ultrasound is the diagnosis of breast cancer through detecting changes of mechanical properties due to abnormal growth [11, 12]. Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the world among women [12]. The sensitivity and specificity of sonography, a method used to detect breast cancer, in detecting malignancy are 50% and 91.8%, respectively [12]. In most cases, a biopsy is needed to confirm sonography and to differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumors [13, 14]. Biopsies are expensive, invasive, and time consuming. In addition, a limited volume of the suspected lesion is sampled, and therefore even if there is a tumor present, the biopsy might be negative. Time domain and frequency domain analysis of the backscattered signals from a biological sample gives information about the microstructures of the sample and its physiological state [13, 15]. Cancer tissues might have different microstructures and physiological processes relative to normal tissues. A careful analysis of the time and frequency content in the backscattered signals has the potential to better utilize ultrasound for the diagnosis of cancer and possibly decrease the use of biopsy in detecting breast cancer. However, the origins of the frequency content of the backscattered signal, and how it changes
2

between malignant and normal cells, are not fully understood. This is due to the existence of many factors which contribute to the backscattered signal.

1.3

THE PHYSICS OF ULTRASOUND SCATTERING
The interaction of ultrasound with a medium is characterized by attenuation.

Attenuation is the loss of ultrasound wave intensity as it propagates through a medium. This occurs due to the conversion of mechanical energy into thermal energy (ultrasound absorption) and scattering of the wave (ultrasound scattering). Scattering is the redirection of ultrasound wave in a range of directions different than the incident wave due to localized non-uniformities in the medium [16]. As ultrasound waves propagate through a medium, changes in the mechanical properties of the medium causes the ultrasound waves to scatter. The scattered ultrasound signal is measured by the differential scattering cross-section ( ( ) [16]:

(

(

where

are spherical coordinates angles,

is the time averaged scattered power,

is the

solid angle and is the time average incident intensity. The differential scattering cross-section has a unit of cm2/sr (area/solid angle), which represents the likelihood of ultrasound waves to scatter at specific angle. The differential scattering cross-section is a function of the ultrasound wavelength and changes in the medium mechanical properties. The scattered ultrasound signal is related to the ratio of the scatterer size to incident ultrasound wavelength; these two parameters are typically combined into one parameter called ka--the product of wavenumber

3

(

) and scatterer size ( ). Changes in the mechanical properties can be accounted for

through a parameter called acoustic impedance. Acoustic impedance ( ) is defined as the amount of pressure generated due to the vibration of the molecules as shown below: ( ( is the spatial position and

(

(

where

is the pressure,

is the particle velocity,

is the

frequency. The unit used for acoustic impedance is Rayleigh (Rayl) which is equal to kg/s.m2. Equation 1.2 refers to the specific acoustic impedance which depends on both frequency and spatial position. This dependence is due to the phase difference between the pressure and particle velocity created in viscous medium through friction loss. Assuming a plane incident wave in an inviscous fluid medium equation 1.2 simplifies into:  where , and (

are the density, speed of sound and bulk modulus elasticity of the medium.

Equation 1.3 is referred to as the characteristic acoustic impedance which is constant for a specific homogeneous medium and does not depend on the frequency and spatial position [16]. In this thesis the acoustic impedance refers to the characteristic acoustic impedance. In order to calculate the theoretical differential scattering cross-section for a given sample (Equation 1.1), the Helmholtz wave equation is solved for the appropriate scattering geometry and boundary conditions [17]. Two extreme cases have been derived which are >>1 and <<1. The first case occurs when the scatterer source size is significantly larger >>1) [16]. In this case, both the shape and size of the scatterer do not
4

than the wavelength (

contribute to the scattered signal, instead only changes in the mechanical properties can be used to predict the scattered signals. This typically makes it possible to treat the scattering surface as a planar surface. In this case the strength of the scattered signal can be represented by [16]: ( ( where ( (

respectively are the acoustic impedance of the first and second materials,

respectively

are the incident angle and the transmitted angle to the line normal to the surface as shown in figure 1.1. Figure 1.1 Schematic of incident ultrasound wave approaching an interface of two different materials.

The second case, called Rayleigh scattering, happens when the scatterer size is significantly smaller than the wavelength ( <<1). In this case, the shape of the scatterer

source does not contribute to the scattered signal. The Rayleigh scattering equation is [16]:

and density of scatterer and background,

respectively.  is the average number density of the scatterer. A portion of the scattered signal is due to changes in the compressibility between the scatterer and the background, and is not angle dependent (Equation 1.5). This is referred to as the monopole term, which in the case of a spherical scatterer causes the scatterer source to oscillate equally in all directions. In contrast, the scattered signal due to changes in the density between the scatterer and the background are angle dependent (Equation 1.5). This is referred to as the dipole term, which causes the scatterer source to oscillate parallel to the propagating wave [16]. The rest of the cases are in between the two extremes mentioned above, when the scatterer size is comparable to the wavenumber. In these cases, ultrasound scattering becomes more complex. The differential scattering cross-section for radiating pressure scattered from a single uniform spherical or cylindrical scatterer source has been derived by Faran in 1951. The solutions are functions of scatterer size, wavenumber, Poission's ratio, and density and compressibility of the scatterer source and the surrounding background [18]. The Poission's ratio ( ) is related to the speed of sound of transverse and longitudinal waves:

(

where

and

are the longitudinal and transverse speeds of sound in a specific medium.

Liquid and gas media do not support transverse waves due to the weak interaction between their particles. Biological soft tissues are mainly composed of water which does not support
6

transvers waves (

approaches 0); this causes the Poission's ratio to approach 0.5 (Equation

1.6). Biological soft tissues are complex due to the presence of scatterers with different shapes and mechanical properties. The Faran equation assumes single scattering source with a known shape (spherical or cylindrical). The wave equation for heterogeneous scattering medium is a better representation of wave propagation for biological soft tissues, but it requires knowledge of the mechanical properties of the tissues.

1.4

THE SCATTERED PRESSURE FROM HETEROGENEOUS MEDIUM
In biological tissues, both the density and compressibility fluctuates spatially throughout

the tissue. The wave equation for a heterogeneous medium accounts for these fluctuations. Several assumptions have been made to simplify the solution of the wave equation for a heterogeneous medium. First, the transducer focal depth is significantly larger than the transmitted wavelength. Second, the incident pressure wave at the focal point, where the scattering cross section is calculated, is planar. Third, the medium is a weak scattering source-- in other words, there are small fluctuations in the density and the compressibility of tissues (also known as the Born approximation) [10]. Assuming weak scattering, the scattered wave has an amplitude much smaller in magnitude compared to the incident wave and therefore multiple scattering is ignored. Finally, it is assumed that the scattering sources are randomly distributed. Organized scatterers can lead to constructive or destructive interferences, which can increase or decreased the backscattered signal at a specific frequency. These assumptions simplify solving the wave equation for the differential scattering cross-section ( heterogeneous medium to: ) of a

coefficient for the scattering medium, and

is the change between two positions in the

medium. Equation 1.7 was derived to help in understanding the interaction of ultrasound waves with biological tissues (since biological tissues are a heterogeneous medium with fluctuations in the acoustic impedance). However, the difficulty in measuring   and (

(the two parameters can be combined through the spatial fluctuation of the acoustic impedance map) of tissues made it challenging to solve for the backscattered signal. An approach, called the reference phantom technique, has been used to analyze the frequency content of the backscattered signals experimentally to acquire information about the interaction of ultrasound wave with biological tissues.

1.5

THE REFERENCE PHANTOM TECHNIQUE
The reference phantom technique is a method developed by Lin Xin Yao et. al. in 1990

to calculate the backscatter coefficient (BSC), which is the differential scattering cross-section for ( (Equation 1.1) per unit volume [19]. Using this technique, different instruments

generating the same ultrasound frequencies should give the same BSC if they are used to image the same sample. The reference phantom technique makes it possible to analyze the frequency content of backscattered signals in real time at clinical settings [20]. This method was confirmed experimentally by comparing the calculated BSC from different ultrasound instruments [21]. In this method, the following equation has been used to calculate the BSC:

attenuation coefficient.

where is the speed of sound and is the time the signal is

being mapped for. The subscripts s and r denote for the sample and reference respectively. The reference phantom method uses a reference phantom with a known power spectrum, attenuation and BSC to calculate the BSC of a sample using the same experimental setup. The BSC has been used in analyzing the frequency contents for a scattered signal, independent of the instrumentation used to acquire the signal. This is important since quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques take into account the frequency dependence of the BSC to infer tissue structure.

1.6

QUANTITATIVE ULTRASOUND
Many QUS parameters have been used to characterize tissues. Two QUS parameters

that have been used frequently to characterize tissue, calculated from the BSC are: the effective scatterer size and the acoustic concentration [13]. The effective scatterer size is related to the volume of the scatterer source. The acoustic concentration is related to the concentration of the scatterers and the impedance mismatch between the scatterer and the background as shown in the equation below:

(

)

(

where

impedance of the scattering source and

parameters are calculated by computing the smallest mean-square error (argmin) to fit the measured BSC to an estimated BSC, as shown in the equation below:

is the volume of the scatterer source. The estimated BSC is calculated theoretically either by using a well known model (e.g. Faran) or by multiplying the Rayleigh scattering equation with a correction factor. The correction factor is called a form factor which is calculated by taking the square of the three dimensional Fourier transform of the assumed scatterer shape [13]. The form factor approach has been used due to its simplicity--it requires less parameters and it can be used to account for any scatterer shape. One of the form factors that is widely used to characterize biological tissues is the Gaussian form factor. This form factor assumes that the impedance mismatch between the scatterer and background occurs gradually [22]. The Gaussian form factor is shown below: ( (

is the effective diameter which is related to the correlation distance ( ), the minimum spatial separation between two scatterers to receive two independent signals, through . The use of these theoretical models in calculating QUS parameters has helped in differentiating between different biological tissues clinical ultrasound images were unable to detect.

1.7

ADVANTAGES OF QUS
QUS parameters can be used to characterize tissues. This is achievable since the

parameters derived represent changes in scatterer source number, size, shape, compressibility, and density of the medium [18]. It has been hypothesized that QUS parameters can be used to detect changes in biological structures that cannot be detected by a conventional ultrasound, with greater sensitivity to smaller changes [23]. Previous studies showed the advantages of using QUS parameters in characterizing tissues microstructures such as ocular, myocardial, liver, and kidney tissues [19, 24-27]. Ocular cancer can be recognized as an increase in effective scatterer size [28]. Myocardial infarction can be detected as an increase in the BSC [29]. Solid tumor in liver is related to a decrease in the BSC [19, 30]. Tissue characterization of the kidney demonstrates the possibility in differentiating normal kidney vs. renal cell carcinoma vs. oncocytoma, based on the BSC [10, 31]. QUS has also been used to monitor high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatments [6], detect cancerous lymph nodes [23], and identify various forms of cell death [32, 33]. Clinical ultrasound machines use frequency ranges between 1-15MHz, which gives a penetration depth of 5-15cm [16]. Frequency analysis of ultrasound backscattered signal can be

11

used to find a correlation between tissue structures and scatterer source e.g. the nephron and the glomerulus [10]. As the frequency of ultrasound increases, the resolution also increases which enables resolving smaller scatterers. At frequency around 25MHz, it is hypothesized that the QUS techniques can resolve-scatterers at the cellular level [4]. Using this frequency scientists were able to differentiate between different cancer tissues [3, 5]. Results demonstrate a clear difference in both the effective scatterer size and acoustic concentration between rats' mammary fibroadenomas and mouse carcinomas [3, 5]. In contrast, ultrasound quantification to differentiate between mouse carcinoma vs. sarcoma was not achieved using both effective scatterer size and acoustic concentration parameters [4]. Nonetheless, the optical images of the two cancers revealed a clear difference. To improve the capability of QUS parameters to differentiate between diseased tissues, better denotation of the measured effective scatterer source and acoustic concentration are required. This can be achieved by improving our understanding of the shape and properties of scatterers at the cellular level.

1.8

IDENTIFYING THE DOMINANT SCATTERER SOURCE USING HIGH FREQUENCY ULTRASOUND
Tissue scatterer source identification can help in describing tissues' morphology,

therefore improving ultrasound diagnostic capabilities and treatment monitoring. Many research studies have been done to determine the scatterer source in tissues. It is hypothesized that the nucleus is the main scatterer in biological structures [33-35]. One experiment which supports this was done by comparing the integrated BSC of human epithelial kidney cells with the multinucleated human epithelial kidney cell [34]. The results revealed no difference in the BSC between the normal and the multinucleated epithelial kidney cells. Since the cell size is

12

different but the nucleus size being the same between normal and multinucleated cells, the similar in BSC was hypothesized to be due to similar scatterer source (the nucleus). Another study done by Oelze and Zachary hypothesizes that the whole cell acts as the major scattering source [4]. This was done by comparing the size of carcinoma cells to the measured effective scatterer size of carcinoma tissue and carcinoma cell pellet. The results revealed no statistical difference between all three sizes. The hypothesized conclusion was the cell is the main scattering source. A clear understanding of the scatterer source in biological tissues is still unclear, due to the lack of knowledge about spatial maps of acoustic impedance of biological tissues. In a study done by Mamou el. al. [13, 36] they presented a method which can be used to determine the scatterer source in tissues from the 3D acoustic impedance map (3DZM). In this method, the solution of the wave equation from a heterogeneous medium (Equation 1.7) is used to calculate the BSC using 3DZM. The calculated BSC is compared to the measured BSC from the same heterogeneous medium (tissue) [13, 36]. The 3DZM is obtained by taking a tissue and slice it into thin sections. The sliced sections are stained using haematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) imaged using optical microscopy. A transformation, rotation, and stretching is applied to each slice to align the images into a 3D histological volume. The 3DZM is created by assigning an impedance values to the optical 3D histological volume. The impedance map values are obtained from look-up tables of acoustic impedance values. This method was unable to identify the scatterer source. In the study, it was stated that more accurate impedance values were required to be used for wider range of scatterers and that the variation within a single scatterer had to be accounted for [13, 36].

IMPORTANCE OF MEASURING THE ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE OF BIOLOGICAL STRUCTURES
One of the advantages of measuring the acoustic impedance of biological structures is

to help in identifying the scattering source. In addition, acoustic impedance values have been used to obtain information about the cell physiology and its environment [15, 37, 38]. Acoustic impedance values are sensitive to changes in density, speed of sound or elastic properties (Equation 1.3). Many physiological changes in the cell, such as cell division, cell motility, cell adhesion, gene expression, signal transduction and apoptosis, have been linked to alteration in the elastic properties of the membrane and the intracellular fluid [38-41]. For example, detected changes in the elastic properties of red blood cells have been correlated to the maturation of specific parasites [42]. In addition, changes in the elastic properties of the arterial have been associated with diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart failure, and renal failure [4346]. Beside elasticity, speeds of sound have been used to differentiate between blood as its going through coagulation and retraction [47], evaluate enzymes activities and differentiating between gastritis, ulcer and cancer in the stomach [7]. The importance of measuring the acoustic impedance arises due to its direct correlation to biological structures, dynamics and thermodynamics of biological molecules [7]. Many techniques have been developed to measure the mechanical properties of biological structures. The elasticity of biological structures is related to the resistivity of its structures to deform. To measure elasticity, an external force is applied to deform the biological structures. The ratio of the applied force to the deformation is used to measure elasticity. The external force is created mechanically, or through applying electric or magnetic fields. The applied force can deform portion of the cell, the whole cell or population of cells [40]. Some of
14

these techniques are: atomic force microscopy [48], magnetic tweezers [49], optical tweezers [50], micropipette aspiration [51], shear-flow methods [52], and stretching devices [53]. All the techniques mentioned above require applying stress on the biological structures in order to measure its mechanical properties. Measuring the mechanical properties of biological structures using acoustic microscopy has been desired due to the minimal stress it applies on the sample, the relative high resolution and speed [54]. Measuring the mechanical properties of biological structures using acoustic microscopy can be done by analyzing the timedomain or the frequency-domain of the backscattered signal [38, 54]. Using the time-domain signal, a method called pulse-echo can be used to measure both the density and speed of sound. Speed of sound is measured by comparing the time shift from the sample and the reference with a known speed of sound [38, 55]. Density is measured from the calculated speed of sound and using the amplitude of the reflected signal (Equation 1.3). Using the frequencydomain signal, measuring the density and speed of sound can be obtained by using phase analysis or interpolation of the voltage vs. frequency plot [43, 54, 56]. Both methods use the voltage vs. frequency plot to measure the mechanical properties of the sample. In addition, acoustic impedance can be measured directly using acoustic microscopy [55, 57].

1.10 ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE IMAGING METHOD
Recently, a method to measure the acoustic impedance in tissues using acoustic microscopy has been developed by Hozumi et. al. (2005). This method, namely acoustic impedance imaging method (AIIM), assumes the scatterer source is significantly larger than the ultrasound wavelength and the incident ultrasound beam is normal to the sample. The reflection coefficient due to an impedance mismatch is shown in equation 1.4. AIIM uses a
15

reference material with known acoustic impedance to calculate the acoustic impedance of an unknown sample [57]. The setup of AIIM goes in the following order: transducer, coupling fluid, slide, and the mounted sample, which is different from acoustic microscopy imaging for which the sample is place on top of the slide (figure 1.2). The transducer is focused on the slidesample boundary. There are two properties of the slide that must be taken into consideration to successfully image the sample using AIIM. First, the slide must have a low impedance mismatch relative to the coupling fluid (<4MRayl) so that the transmitted signal through the slide-coupling fluid boundary will be maximized [57]. Second, the slide has to be thin in order to reduce the attenuation of the signal through the slide itself. The acoustic images acquired using acoustic microscopy have a different setup compared to the setup used in the AIIM. The setup of acoustic microscopy imaging goes in the following order: transducer, coupling fluid, the sample and slide. There are two advantages of AIIM over the acoustic microscopy imaging. First, it improves the lateral resolution by focusing the ultrasound wave to a smaller focal spot as it propagates through the slide. Second, the sample, by virtue of being mounted on the slide, will always have a controlled planar boundary. Consequently, the incident ultrasound is always perpendicular to the slide-sample interface which allows the calculation of acoustic impedance. This point is important in case of imaging cells, since the morphology of cells cannot be controlled. Although the wave propagation through the slide increases the lateral resolution, the signal also gets attenuated as it propagates through the slide. This results in a lower signal-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, a calibration needs to be applied in order to account for the shear wave created in the solid slide

16

and the finite angle of the transducer as it enters the coupling fluid-slide-sample boundaries [58].

1.11 CALIBRATION FOR AIIM
The measured acoustic impedance of the sample using equation 1.4 is different than the actual acoustic impedance of the sample. The relationship between the measured and actual acoustic impedance is shown below [59]: ( ( ( ( where is the measured acoustic impedance of the sample using equation 1.4,

The results of AIIM are 2D image representing the acoustic impedance map of the sample at the slide interface. This map can be correlated to the sample morphology by using optical microscopy, histological staining or fluorescence microscopy.

1.12 FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY
Fluorescence microscopy is similar to conventional optic microscopy [61]. Fluorescence microscopy uses high intensity lasers with a narrow bandwidth that excite a desired molecule within a sample. Optical microscopy uses much lower intensity with wider bandwidth (all visible wavelengths). The main purpose of fluorescence microscopy is to increase the signal from the

19

sample while decreasing background noise [61]. The principle of fluorescence microscopy is applied by illuminating the specimen with a specific wavelength of light. The light is absorbed by the specimen and reemitted at a longer wavelength. This change in wavelength allows the detection of specific characteristics within the specimen. The molecules that absorb and emit light are called fluorophores. Fluorophores are unique molecules that contain conjugated double bonds [61]. Naturally, they are rare to be found in biological structures and in this case the biological structure will be considered autofluorescent. All other cases require introducing external fluorophores which bind directly or indirectly to biological structures. Well-known examples of fluorophores which bind directly to biological structures are Hoechst and CellTracker Orange. Hoechst is a molecule which binds to the minor groove of the DNA [62]. This molecule is used to stain the nucleus. CellTracker Orange is composed of CMTMR (5-(and-6)-(((4-chloromethyl) benzoyl) amino) tetramethylrhodamine which reacts to the thiols group in the presence of a protein called esterase (present inside cells) which binds the CellTracker Orange molecule to the thiols group. The thiols group mainly exists in glutathione S-transferase which is a protein common in the cytoplasm. Therefore, CellTracker Orange is used to stain the cytoplasm. Fluorophores which bind indirectly to biological structures require introducing an external protein molecule. This protein has two binding sites: one site binds directly to the desired target molecule inside the cell or extracellular matrix, and the second site binds to the fluorophore molecule.

20

If the specimen contains molecules such as fluorophores, the absorbed light is reemitted with lower energy. The absorbed energy is directly related to the frequency of the illuminated light. As fluorophores absorb light their electrons jump from a ground electronic state to an excited state. The absorbed light can cause an electron to jump from one orbital to an orbital further away from the nucleus. The excited state has more energy which causes alterations in the vibrational and rotational state of the fluorophores. The excited state of the fluorophores reemits light almost instantaneously with different wavelengths--the reemitted light has lower energy. The emitted light is separated from the illuminated light based on the difference in wavelength. The challenging part in fluorescence microscopy is finding the proper fluorophores to bind to the desired target. An advanced type of fluorescence microscopy is called confocal microscopy which allows higher resolution and contrast. Thick sample with fluorophores above and below the focal point can be problematic when imaged using fluorescence microscopy. This is due to the light radiated from the fluorophores in focus and out of focus that will be detected by the lens. The illumination of the out of focus fluorophores causes the images to be blurred [63, 64]. Unlike fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy uses a pinhole to block the light illuminated by out of focus fluorophores to obtain sharper images [63, 64]. The pinhole reduces the thickness of the optical sectioning to 0.5-1.5µm vs. >50 µm for a conventional fluorescence microscopy [64]. Thinner optical sections grant the reconstruction of 3D images by changing the depth of focus. In addition, confocal is used to obtain images with higher contrast and resolution than a conventional fluorescence microscopy.

1.13 HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS
The main objective of this study is to use ultra-high frequency AIIM to calculate the acoustic impedance map of cancer cells. This can be used as an input for the 3DZM maps to identify the main scatterer source and help in understanding the mechanical properties of an individual cancer cell and its physiological state. The hypothesis of this study is that AIIM can be used to measure the acoustic impedance of microstructures in cancer cells. The specific aims are to a) develop the AIIM methodology to measure the acoustic impedance b) validate the AIIM method with materials of known acoustic impedance and c) to combine the AIIM measurements with fluorescence measurements to identify the target microstructures. To accomplish the above, a solid layer had to be identified that was thin (<100µm) so the reflected signal will not be attenuated and that had a low acoustic impedance (<4MRayl) to increase the transmitted signal through the coupling fluid and the solid layer boundary. Moreover, the material should allow the cell to attach firmly to it.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

CELL PREPARATION
The cell line used in this experiment was MCF-7. MCF-7 is an invasive breast duct

carcinoma cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified incubator maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were maintained in the exponential growth phase, and passaged using trypsin dissociation when the flasks were 80-90% confluent. 24 hours prior to the experiment, the old media was aspirated leaving the cells which have been attached to the T25 flask. The cells were washed and aspirated with 1ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 1ml of trypsin was added to the cells. The cells were incubated. After three minutes, the flask was examined under a microscope to verify that the cells were in suspension. If the cells were not suspended, the flask was gently shaken physically. 4ml of media was added to the flask then transferred into a 15ml tube. The tube was centrifuged at 150g for 3min at room temperature. The media was removed and 6ml of new media was added to the cells and mixed. 1ml of cells containing media (approximately 300 000 cells) was added to 9ml of growth media. The 10ml mixture was transported into a culture system made of two parallel polystyrene thin membranes (NUNC Opticell, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and left in the incubator. 2 hours prior to the experiment, 10µl of 10mM of Celltracker Orange (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 10ml of media replaced the old media in the Opticell. The Opticell was incubated for 30 minutes. After, the media was removed and the Opticell was washed with

23

10ml of PBS. 10ml of media and 200µl of Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were added to the Opticell and incubated for 30 minutes.

IMAGING

2.2.1 ACOUSTIC AND FLUORESCENCE IMAGES
A custom built scanning acoustic microscope (SASAM, Kibero GmbH, Saarbrucken, Germany), based on an IX81 microscope body (Olympus, Central Valley, PA), capable of both acoustic and fluorescent imaging was used in these experiments. Acoustic imaging was completed using transducer with a center frequency of 375MHz, a bandwidth of 150MHz, and an aperture angle of 60°. The axial resolution ( using the equations below [65]:  ( where  is the average wavelength, is the speed of sound and ) and lateral resolution ( ) are calculated

(

transducer. The axial and lateral resolutions of the transducer in water were calculated to be 5.1µm and 3.6µm respectively. Fluorescent microscopy images were taken with a monochrome CCD camera with a resolution of 1392 x 1040 pixels (Lumenera, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The entire microscope, including the sample, is kept in a climate controlled chamber at 36.0±0.2 oC. The setup is shown in figure 2.1. The coupling fluid used was water. Media was used as the background in order to image cells and its acoustic impedance was measured using AIIM. Equation 2.2 was used to calculate the amplitude of the incident signal ( ( (

The ultrasound backscatter radiofrequency signals were obtained by scanning the transducer in the x-y plane with step size of 1µm and a field of view ranging from 40µm-100µm depending on the cell size. The apparent acoustic impedance images were obtained by calculating of each

radiofrequency signal. Green and ultraviolet light were used to image the Hoechst and Celltracker Orange stains respectively. 20 single cells and 10 clustered cells were imaged using both acoustic and fluorescence microscopy.

On the right is a schematic of the acoustic microscopy setup. Transducer used had center frequency of 375MHz, the coupling fluid used was water, sample used was MCF-7 cell, the culture system used was Opticells and background used was media (DMEM and 10% FBS).

2.2.2 FIXING CELLS
After imaging the cells using the acoustic microscopy, the media in the Opticell was replaced with 10ml of 10% formalin and left at room temperature for 15 minutes. After 10ml of PBS was added to the Opticell to replace the formalin. An additional 7 acoustic impedance and fluorescence images of clustered cells were acquired. The clustered-fixed cells were compared to the clustered-live and single-live cells.

2.2.3 ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE CALIBRATION
A calibration is applied to find the acoustic impedance of the sample ( ) after

accounting for both the shear waves created in the polystyrene and the finite angle of the transducer. This was done by substituting to solve for : from equation 2.2 in equation 2.3 and rearrange it

the equation above was used to determine the correlation between the apparent and true acoustic impedance. To test this calibration, the acoustic impedance of water was measured using air as a reference. This was done by applying AIIM to image 50µm x 50µm in dimensions with 2µm step

27

size at 10 different positions. The same method was used to measure the acoustic impedance of the media and the PBS, since they were the backgrounds in case of imaging live and fixed cells, respectively. The speed of sound of the backgrounds was needed to apply the calibration. The speed of sound of media and PBS were calculated by dividing the acoustic impedance over the density. The densities of the backgrounds were measured by taking the ratio of the mass over the volume--using electronic balance (Scientech, Boulder, CO) and 5ml pipette (Fisher Scientific Company, Ottawa, Ontario).

2.2.4 IMAGE ANALYSIS 2.2.4.1 SIZE COMPARISON
Acoustic impedance and fluorescent images of the cytoplasm and nucleus (stained with Celltracker Orange and Hoechst, respectively) were superimposed for each single cell. A trace line was selected at a location within the image for which the difference between the cell size compared to the nucleus size (assessed through the fluorescent staining) was the largest. The trace lines were normalized so the minimum and maximum values, of the intensity in case of fluorescence microscopy and acoustic impedance values in cause of acoustic microscopy, were equal to 0 and 1. A size was obtained for each trace line by subtracting the first and last location when the normalized amplitude was 0.5 as show in figure 2.2. The size ratio of the trace line of fluorescence images labeled by Celltracker Orange stain over acoustic impedance images, and the trace line of fluorescence images labeled by Hoechst stain over acoustic impedance images were acquired. These calculations were done for all 20 single-live cells.

The distance between the intersections of the blue line and the black line (trace line) is acquired (red lines). The difference between the two x-axis readings is used to calculate the size.

2.2.4.2 ACQUIRING AVERAGE ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE OF CELLS
The cells were segmented from the background using threshold and erosion. Thresholds were applied to all acoustic impedance images, to eliminate the background impedance. The thresholds were 1.575MRayl and 1.520MRayl in case of media and PBS as backgrounds, respectively. The threshold values were acquired from the average value of the first minima from the smoothed histogram of the acoustic impedance images. Smoothing was performed using a moving average filter of size 0.005MRayl. Next, the acoustic impedance images were eroded with two different disk shaped matrix of size 3µm and 7µm in diameter which are approximately one and two times the lateral resolution of the transducer in polystyrene. Erosion is a morphological image processing technique which removes pixels from the object

29

boundaries (cell boundaries in this experiment). The number of the removed pixels at the boundaries depends on the size of the erosion with a larger erosion size removing more pixels at the boundaries. The purpose of erosion is to reduce the effect of the point spread function of the transducer on the measured acoustic impedance values. The non-eliminated pixels were averaged for each image and the standard deviation was calculated. The mean of the average acoustic impedance and standard deviation were calculated for the three different groups (single-live, clustered-live and clustered-fixed cells). The means were compared using a multiple comparison test to examine which comparisons are statistically different.

2.3

CONFOCAL IMAGES
A Zeiss LSM 700 confocal laser scanning microscope (Oberkochen, Germeny) with 40x

oil lens was used to obtain 3D images of MCF-7 cells. Hoechst and CellTracker Orange stains were used to image the nucleus and cytoplasm respectively. The axial step size was 0.33µm. The depth of the nucleus from the polystyrene layer was measured by subtracting the depth of the image were the CellTracker Orange stain first appear with the depth of the image were the Hoechst stain appeared (indicating the cell nucleus) with a diameter of at least 4µm (the approximate wavelength of the ultrasound waves in water). 16 cells were imaged confocally to obtain a perspective about the depth of the nucleus from the substrate.

2.4

SIMULATIONS
To better understand the effect of the distance of microstructures from the substrate to

the measured acoustic impedance, simulations were performed (COMSOL MultiPhysics, Stockholm, Sweden). The software uses the Helmholtz wave equation to solve for the scattered pressure. Three different material domains were used in the finite element software to
30

simulate the polystyrene substrate, the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the MCF-7 cells. Four simulations were run. The speed of sound and density of the materials used in these simulations are presented in table 2.1. Table 2.1 parameters represent postulated ranges of acoustic impedances of the nucleus (1.6-1.8MRayl) and cytoplasm (1.5-1.7MRayl) [13, 38, 54, 56]. The thickness of the middle layer varied between 0.1-4.0 µm and had a maximum element size of 0.05µm. The first and third layer had a thickness of 20.0µm and a maximum element size of 0.2µm. The width of all the layers was 5.0µm. The equation of incident pressure used was:

RESULTS

The acoustic impedance values of different cells were obtained using AIIM. The fluorescence confocal images were used to assess the morphology of a cell and to calculate the distance between the nucleus and the polystyrene substrate. The simulations were run to determine the effect of the distance between the nucleus and the polystyrene substrate on the measured 2D acoustic impedance images.

3.1

ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE IMAGING
A representative radiofrequency signal collected from the middle of a cell and from a

location within the media (background) are presented in figure 3.1. There are three distinct time intervals in the reflected radiofrequency signal. First, the time signal recorded in the interval between 1.390µs-1.405µs is due to the acoustic impedance mismatch between the polystyrene and the sample (cells) or background. Second, the signal recorded in the time interval between 1.405µs-1.415µs is due to the acoustic impedance mismatch with in the sample or background. Third, the signal recorded in the time interval between 1.420µs-1.440µs is potentially due to the leaky Rayleigh waves created at the coupling fluid and the polystyrene boundary [66]. After the acoustic impedance images were acquired from the radiofrequency signals and a calibration was needed to account for effects such as the shear waves created in the polystyrene. Acoustic impedance calibration plots are shown in figure 3.2 in case of air, media and PBS used as the reference. The densities used in the calibration were measured to be 0.99±0.01g/cm3 and 1.04±0.01g/cm3 for media and PBS at 36oC. AIIM accuracy was tested by measuring the acoustic impedance of water. The measured acoustic impedance of water was

33

1.5129±0.0009 MRayl. The next step was to measure the average acoustic impedance of the backgrounds used in the experiments: media and PBS. The results are presented in table 3.1. 2D acoustic impedance maps of cells were acquired using AIIM after applying the correction presented in figure 3.2. The results of three acoustic impedance images are presented in figure 3.3 adjacent to fluorescence microscopy images of the same cells with stained nucleus (blue) and cytoplasm (red), and line traces of the normalized acoustic impedance images (black), fluorescence images labeled by Hoechst (blue) and fluorescence images labeled by CellTracker Orange (red). The acoustic impedance and fluorescence images of live and fixed cells are shown in figure 3.4.

IMAGE ANALYSIS

3.2.1 SIZE COMPARISON
To compare the morphology of the acoustic impedance images with the fluorescence images, trace lines were used. Sizes of structures derived from the normalized trace line of acoustic impedance images, and fluorescence images labeled by Hoechst and CellTracker Orange for 20 single cells were calculated. The average size ratio of fluorescence images labeled by CellTracker Orange to acoustic impedance images was 1.02±0.08. The average size ratio of fluorescence images labeled by Hoechst over acoustic impedance images was 0.63±0.11.

3.2.2 ACQUIRING THE AVERAGE ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE OF CELLS
Threshold and erosion operations were applied to segment the 37 corrected acoustic impedance images cells from the background. 20 of the images were images of single-live cells, 10 were of clustered-live cells, and 7 were of clustered-fixed cells. The histograms of a live and a fixed corrected acoustic impedance images before and after applying the threshold are

40

presented in figure 3.6. The image analysis processes of threshold and erosion for a single-live cell, clustered-live cells, and clustered-fixed cells are presented in figure 3.5. The average acoustic impedance and standard deviation of the segmented cells, after applying the threshold, and 3µm and 7µm in diameter erosion disks, are presented in table 3.3 for all three groups. The average acoustic impedance values of these three different groups were compared using multiple comparison tests. The results are shown in figure 3.7. In both cases, using 3µm and 7µm erosion disks, all three groups have average acoustic impedance values that are significantly different.

3.3

CONFOCAL IMAGES
The 3D morphology of MCF-7 cells was obtained using confocal microscopy. 16 fixed

cells were imaged with both the Hoechst and CellTracker Orange stains. The average depth of the nucleus from the substrate was calculated by comparing the Hoechst and CellTracker Orange stains. Cross-sectional images of two cells are presented in figure 3.8. The average distance between the nucleus and the polystyrene substrate was measured to be 0.60±1.40µm.

Figure 3.8 Cross-sectional image of fixed MCF-7 cells using confocal microscopy. The distance from the top of the cytoplasm (red, stained with Celltracker Orange), to the top of the nucleus (blue, stained with Hoechst) are 1µm and 0.66µm respectively.

3.4

SIMULATIONS
COMSOL simulations were performed to understand the capability of a 375MHz

transducer to differentiate between two consecutive impedance mismatches at a distance less
41

than the wavelength. The results are presented in figure 3.9. In the case of an impedance mismatch of 0.3MRayl (solutions 1 and 2), two boundaries with a distance less than 1.5µm will have an impact on the measured acoustic impedance. As the acoustic impedance mismatch decreases to 0.1MRayl (solutions 3 and 4), two boundaries with a distance less than 0.7µm will have an impact on the measured acoustic impedance.

CHAPTER 4:
4.1 DISCUSSION

DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

Multiple features can be extracted by comparing the radiofrequency signal reflected from the cancerous cell and the media (figure 3.1). First, the amplitude of the reflected signal from the cancerous cell is less than the amplitude of the reflected signal from the media, as can be seen from figure 3.1 at approximate time interval of 1.390µs-1.405µs. This is due to the acoustic impedance mismatch between the polystyrene and the cancerous cell being less than the acoustic impedance mismatch between the polystyrene and the media. Second, by comparing the time interval of 1.405µs-1.415µs in figure 3.1, the amplitude of the reflected signal from the cell is higher than the amplitude of the reflected signal from the media. This time interval is correlated to the acoustic impedance mismatch within the media (black) and the cell (red). In case of the media, the amplitude of the reflected signal in this time interval is similar to noise (time interval 1.380µs-1.390µs). Therefore the acoustic impedance mismatch within the media itself is too small to generate a detectable signal. In contrast, the amplitude of the reflected signal at this time interval in case of a cancer cell is detectable (above the noise floor). This is because of the acoustic impedance mismatch within the heterogeneous single cancer cell. Third, the amplitude of the reflected signal at the time interval of 1.420µs-1.440µs in figure 3.1 is similar between the media and the cell. The signal at this time interval is due to the leaky Rayleigh waves reflected from the coupling fluid (water) and the polystyrene boundary. Leaky Rayleigh waves are the reemission of Rayleigh waves created at the polystyrene surface [66]. Since the setup at this boundary is exactly the same in case of media and cell, the reflected signal has the same amplitude. Finally, it is notable that the

43

radiofrequency signal indicates a change in the focal point in case of acoustic impedance imaging vs. acoustic microscopy imaging. In the case of acoustic microscopy imaging, the reflected signal peaks at around 1.460µs, while in case of acoustic impedance imaging the signal peaks at around 1.400µs. The change in the peak of the reflected signal is due to the higher speed of sound in the polystyrene compared to the coupling fluid and the refocusing which occurs as the ultrasound waves enter the polystyrene layer (this is due to the acoustic impedance mismatch between coupling fluid and polystyrene). The setup of this experiment requires the ultrasound waves to propagate through the polystyrene layer before they reach the sample. A calibration was applied to account for the finite angle of the transducer as the ultrasound waves enter the polystyrene layer as well as for the shear waves created in the polystyrene layer. The relation before applying the calibration (apparent acoustic impedance) and after applying the calibration (true acoustic impedance) is demonstrated in figure 3.2. The apparent acoustic impedance and the true acoustic impedance are equal at the acoustic impedance of the reference ( ). In the case of media (red), PBS

(blue), or air (black) as a reference, the apparent and true acoustic impedance coincide at 1.55MRayl, 1.50MRayl, or 0.0004MRayl, respectively. In addition, extrapolating the three curves in figure 3.2 intersect at the apparent acoustic impedance of 2.46MRayl. This intersection occurs at the acoustic impedance of the polystyrene, which can be interpreted as absence in the reflected signal. At this acoustic impedance the reference does not play a factor in the measured acoustic impedance.

44

The results of the AIIM experiment suggest that the nucleus is unlikely to be a strong scattering source in cancer cells. Acoustic impedance images were unable to detect the presence of the nucleus (figure 3.3), suggesting that the nucleus has an acoustic impedance similar to the surrounding cytoplasm. Moreover, the average size ratio of the cytoplasm over the acoustic impedance images was approximately 1 (1.02±0.08). On the other hand, the average size ratio of the nucleus over the acoustic impedance images was < 1 (0.63±0.11). This contradicts the hypothesis of the nucleus being the major scattering source [33-35]. However, using AIIM to attain 2D images and identifying exactly which cellular component is being imaged is challenging, as the distances between the microstructures and substrate are not known. Identifying the exact scattering source is challenging because AIIM is a 2D technique focused on slide-sample interface, while the ultrasound waves may not be able to access the cellular component at various depths. Also, it is not known how close to the substrate a structure has to be for the AIIM to measure an acoustic impedance value related to the microstructure rather than the cytoplasm. To measure the distance between the nucleus and the polystyrene substrate, confocal microscopy was used. Figure 3.4 shows that fixing a cell preserves its gross architecture, which is in agreement with previous research [67, 68]. Confocal images revealed the distance of the nucleus to the substrate is 0.60±1.40µm. COMSOL simulations were performed to better understand the effect of this distance on the measured acoustic impedance values. The results in figure 3.9 suggest that if the acoustic impedance mismatch between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is 0.3MRayl or 0.1MRayl, then the nucleus at depths from the substrate ranges between 0.1-1.5µm or 0.1-0.7µm, respectively, would have an impact on AIIM. It can be
45

inferred, as the acoustic impedance mismatch between the nucleus and the cytoplasm decreases, it is less likely to detect the nucleus in acoustic impedance images. Since the nucleus was not detected in the acoustic impedance images, the acoustic impedance mismatch between the nucleus and the cytoplasm has to be less than 0.1MRayl (figure 3.9). An exact value of the acoustic impedance of the nucleus was not obtained. The COMSOL simulations setup resembles the effect of thin-film interference, except that the incident wave is pulsed and not continuous. Thin-film interference occurs when two consecutive boundaries with acoustic impedance mismatches are separated by a distance approximately equal to the wavelength of the ultrasound wave, or integer multiples of the wavelength (for small integer values, depending on the attenuation of the wave within the film). In this case the wave reflected at the first boundary interferes with the wave reflected at the second boundary. This interference can be constructive, destructive or in-between, depending on the distance between the two consecutive boundaries. The first constructive or destructive interference occurs at 1/4 of the wavelength, because the wave reflected from the second boundary travels the distance twice compared to the wave reflected from the first boundary, which creates a phase shift of /2. Constructive interference occurs in case of one phase shift upon reflection at the first or second boundary. Destructive interference occurs in case of no phase shift or two phase shifts at the first and second boundaries. Phase shift occurs when the wave travels from a material of lower acoustic impedance to a material of higher acoustic impedance, which results into a shift of /2. In simulations 1 and 2 (red and blue lines in figure 3.9) the first constructive interference is noted at thickness of approximately 1µm which is approximately 1/4 the wavelength of ultrasound wave in the coupling fluid. Also, it is a
46

constructive interference as there is one phase shift at the cytoplasm to nucleus boundary. In simulations 3 and 4 (green and black lines in figure 3.9) the interference between the two reflected waves was also noted, but it faded quicker because the acoustic impedance mismatch in the second boundary is three times lower than in the simulations 1 and 2. In addition, the relation between the calculated acoustic impedance values from the simulations and the thickness of the middle layer in simulations 3 and 4 initially increases, in contrast to simulations 1 and 2 which initially decreases. This is because there is no phase shift upon reflection in the radiofrequency signals of simulations 3 and 4. Finally, it can be observed from figure 3.9 that the results are not directly related to the speed of sound and the density parameters. Instead it is directly related to the final product of the speed of sound and the density (acoustic impedance). This is inferred from the similarity in the results of simulations 1 & 2, and 3 & 4. Using AIIM, we were able to measure the average acoustic impedance of cancerous cells. AIIM accuracy was verified by measuring the average acoustic impedance of water, which compared to the literature, had a percent error of 0.19%. The average acoustic impedance for single-live cancer cells was calculated to be 1.60±0.01MRayl, which is higher than 1.56±0.01MRayl for MCF-7, previously obtained using time-resolved acoustic microscopy [55]. Other cancer cells have been reported to have varying acoustic impedances [38, 54, 56]. The measured standard deviation of single-live cells (0.0142MRayl) is approximately 16 times higher than water (0.0009MRayl). This increase is due to the impedance variation within a single cell as shown in figure 3.3 and figure 3.1 at the time interval of 1.405 µs-1.415 µs. In addition, the average acoustic impedance and standard deviation results for clustered-live cells and clustered-fixed cells are presented in table 3.2.
47

Two observations have been noted in this study. First, a significant increase in the average acoustic impedance of clustered vs. single live cells as shown in figure 3.7. A reasonable explanation is clustered cells support more cell to cell communications (e.g. gap junctions), which allows various molecules and ions to pass in-between cells [69]. The molecules and ions act as a signal for gene and protein expression which can lead to changes in the cell physiology. The second observation is the significant decrease in the average acoustic impedance of fixed clustered cells vs. live clustered cells using a 3µm and 7µm erosion disk as shown in figure 3.7. Previous experiments report an increase in density and decrease in speed of sound in fixed cells [70-72]. In conclusion, AIIM was able to differentiate between single-live cells, clustered-live cells and clustered-fixed cells by comparing the average acoustic impedance values. The image analysis operations used in the experiments can have an impact on the measured average acoustic impedance values. The effect of using different erosion disks on the average acoustic impedance values is demonstrated in figure 3.7 and table 3.2 by using two different erosion disks of 3µm and 7µm. The results showed using larger erosion disk (7µm) led to a decrease in the average acoustic impedance values of all single-live cell, clustered-live cells, and clustered-fixed cells. This suggests that the edges have a higher average acoustic impedance values than the rest of the cell(s) (figure 3.3). The increase in the average acoustic impedance values at the edges could be due to significant physiological changes inside the cell or an effect created from the interaction of ultrasound waves with the edges. Moreover, the threshold operation can also play a factor on the final measured average acoustic impedance values. Although the effect of different threshold values on the average acoustic impedance was not tested in this thesis, different methods to acquire the threshold values will have an
48

impact on it. Two different backgrounds were used in the experiment. The different backgrounds used in these experiments should not affect the measured average acoustic impedance values due to the fact that a correction was applied to account for each specific background (PBS and media). This study provides support for the finding that the whole cell acts as one scattering source as opposed to the nucleus being the dominant scatterer source [33-35]. There are several possible reasons for this discrepancy. First, the assumptions used in this experiment are different than the assumptions used in calculating BSC, which has been used to predict the scatterer source. These assumptions required for the analysis of the experimental data are: the boundary between the polystyrene substrate and the sample is semi-infinite and MCF-7 cells have inviscous properties. Secondly, the frequency, cell line and background used in these experiments are different than in the previous studies. The frequency used can have an impact on the results as changing frequencies can affect its sensitivity to differently sized scatterers. Cell line is also a factor as other cancer cells have been reported to have varying acoustic impedances [38, 54, 56]. Finally, the background that a scattering source is positioned within will have an impact on determining the dominant scattering source. This was done by comparing the backscattered signal of cells in suspension and in pellets [73]. The spectral data suggested that the nucleus is the dominant scatterer source in case of pellets while the whole cell is the dominant scatterer source in case of suspension. This study was unable to measure the acoustic impedance of identifiable microstructures in cancer cells (e.g. nucleus). This is likely due to the distance between the

49

nucleus and the substrate. This distance made it impossible to acquire a reflected signal due to the acoustic impedance mismatch between the substrate and the nucleus. A way to improve this study is to segment each acoustic impedance images into two different compartments. One compartment correlates to the position of the nucleus and the other to the position of the cytoplasm, both acquired from the fluorescence image. In this work, the AIIM was used to measure the 2D acoustic impedance map of MCF-7 cells attached to the polystyrene substrate. The use of AIIM for measuring the acoustic impedance of biological microstructures has been previously described in a conference paper by Hozumi et. al. [57]. Other methods have been used to measure the acoustic impedance of biological structures [38, 55, 58, 74]. The two main advantages of AIIM are: it does not apply physical stress to the biological structures and it can be used to acquire 2D acoustic impedance maps. Two applications can be acquired from the spatial acoustic impedance maps. First, the average acoustic impedance values can be used to acquire information about the physiological state of cancer cells. Second, the acoustic impedance fluctuations can be used to predict the backscattered signal in tissues composed of cancer cells. Such measurements are used in the 3DZM method (by comparing the backscattered signal to the theoretical backscattered signal) to identify the major scattering source in biological structures (anatomical structures). Understanding the acoustic impedance variations within cells has the potential to improved ultrasound techniques that can be used to detect anatomical and physiological changes. This can lead to increase in the use of ultrasound to diagnose certain medical conditions, as well as to monitor patient response to treatments.

CONCLUSION
This work measures, for the first time, the acoustic impedance images of cancer cells

using AIIM. The morphology of acoustic impedance images can be used to better understand the mechanical properties of cell microstructures and relate it to the scatterer source in cancer tissues. This can lead to more accurate QUS parameters and a better correlation of these parameters to tissue microstructures. The acoustic impedance images in this study were compared to fluorescent and confocal images with the cell nucleus and cytoplasm stained. The results show that acoustic impedance images were unable to detect the presence of the nucleus. In addition to detecting anatomical changes through evaluating the scattering source, acoustic impedance images can be used to evaluate physiological changes through measuring average acoustic impedance values. In this study three different groups of cells (single-live cells, clustered-live cells, and clustered-fixed cells) were differentiated by measuring the average acoustic impedance values.

4.3

FUTURE WORK
AIIM can be used to acquire an accurate 3DZM of soft tissues. This can be done by

slicing the tissues into thin slices and then taking an image of them using AIIM. Then the acoustic impedance images are combined to obtain a 3DZM. The 3DZM acquired using AIIM can calculate acoustic impedance variation within the sample and accounts for wider ranges of change that the preceding 3DZM lacked. This can improve 3DZM by using it to acquire form factors and scatterer sources of specific tissues.

51

Dissimilar tissues can have various scattering sources and can scatter an ultrasound wave differently at different frequencies. Therefore, more cell types and tissues with extracellular structures need to be imaged at different frequencies using AIIM. For a cell types to be imaged using AIIM, it has to adhere to the substrate and has to have a size larger than the lateral resolution of the transducer. Regarding the frequency used in AIIM, the higher the frequency the better spatial resolution of the measurement and the more accurate the semiinfinite boundary assumption is (equation 2.4). However, higher frequencies have higher attenuation and therefore thinner substrate is required for the measurement to have an adequate signal-to-noise. AIIM has been used to measure the acoustic impedance of cancer cells at the substratesample interface. However, the method cannot detect the acoustic impedance of microstructures away from the substrate. Increasing the pulse length, can create a phenomenon similar to the thin film interference in optics, thereby potentially increasing the sensitivity of the measurement of such structures. This can make it possible to measure the acoustic impedance of the nucleus. Confocal and acoustic microscopy systems built together will make it possible to obtain both acoustic and confocal images of the same cell. The system can be used to acquire the distance between the nucleus and the substrate of a specific cell without fixing it. This can be used to acquire the acoustic impedance of the nucleus. In addition, the fluorescent images can be replaced with higher contrast confocal images. In the experiments presented in this work,

52

the presence of the background between the sample and the fluorescence microscopy caused the images to have low contrast.
