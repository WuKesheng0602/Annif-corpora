TORONTO'S APARTMENT TOWER RENEWAL INITIATIVE:   INFUSING VALUE INTO SURPLUS LANDS FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT     Frederick Thibeault, 2014  Master of Planning  in  Urban Development  Ryerson University   

ABSTRACT
Toronto is home to over 1,189 apartment towers built between 1945 and 1984, following LeCorbusier's  "tower in the park" model. Today, many apartment towers communities are fraught with issues that  demand immediate and focused attention. Several towers are now approaching 50 years of age, and are  beginning to show signs of decay, neglect, and decline, presenting concerns surrounding their physical  condition, environmental impacts, and access to essential amenities within close proximity. The former  Mayor of Toronto David Miller responded by initiating a study to identify solutions to growing concerns,  and financing strategies to achieve it. Notwithstanding these issues, tower neighbourhoods have access  to an exorbitant amounts of surplus lands that could accommodate infill activities, and spur investments  in these neighbourhoods. The goal of this paper is to assess if surplus lands can be leveraged as the  primary funding source to finance the goals and objectives of Toronto's tower renewal initiative.   Key words: tower renewal, innersuburbs, neighbourhood revitalization, financing strategies

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
This major research paper came together through the support, guidance, and advice of many.  Accordingly, I would like to give thanks the following people for their help in shaping this report.   To Chris Phibbs of PQR Solutions (and former mayor of Toronto planning advisor under David Miller's  administration), which was crucial in spurring the idea to pursue this topic. Her support in providing a  number of resources and insights on the initiatives were of great assistance.   To Professor Ronald Keeble, which provided significant insight on development industry standards,  development limitation, and political implications surrounding new development proposals. This insight  helped shape the final development scenarios that were the centrepiece to this report.  To my second reader, Professor David Amborski, which assisted greatly in formulating and  understanding the current financing strategies proposed by Toronto, as well as understanding the  several tools the City has at its disposal to secure investments. His expertise in municipal finances was of  great assistance in understanding opportunities and limitations to capital support programs.  Finally, I am very grateful to my advisor Professor Steven Webber, for his advice, motivation and  encouragement during the many phases of this research endeavour. His enthusiasm for the project, and  expertise in the field of urban investment, land valuations, and development proformas gave me the  drive to approach the project in a number of ways. His wealth of knowledge allows me to learn a great  deal in the process, making the experience that much more gratifying.

INTRODUCTION

Toronto is home to over 1,189 apartment towers built between 1945 and 1984 to the modernist era  standards of the "tower in the park" envisioned by LeCorbusier in the early 20th century. These towers  house over one million of Toronto's current population, encompassing over 30 per cent of the city's  total housing stock and the vast majority of the city's purposebuilt rental stock. Altogether, they are an  indispensable housing resource for the city.  Notwithstanding their prominence in Toronto's housing stock, apartment tower neighbourhoods of this  form have been fraught with significant issues that demand immediate and focused attention, especially  considering they are some of the most impoverished areas of Toronto. A number of these communities  are now approaching 50 years of age, and have begun to show signs of decay, neglect, and decline.  Given their autodependent design, these communities are victim to poor levels of servicing, a lack of  programmed community services, and lack nearby commercial amenities that serve its residents within  a walkable distance ­ which is especially problematic since most of their residents cannot afford an  automobile. These neighbourhoods are perceived as less desirable to live in as they do not meet the  diverse array of needs of Toronto's residents, consequently receiving little investment from both the  public and private sectors. This housing stock is considered the most ecologically unsustainable form of  housing, emitting enormous quantities of CO2 gases in the atmosphere yearly, contributing to the city's  smog issues and taxing the overall power infrastructure supply.   In response to growing concerns surrounding the physical condition, environmental impacts, and lack of  amenities within these apartment neighbourhoods, the former Mayor of Toronto, David Miller, initiated  a 2008 study with E.R.A. Architects to underline key issues and explore potential solutions to address  concerns (E.R.A. Architects, 2010). The result encompassed a comprehensive apartment tower renewal  strategy that sought to enhance the preexisting apartment tower housing stock by 1) creating a cleaner  and greener city; 2) creating stronger and more complete communities; 3) increasing social and cultural  benefits to residents; and 4) enhancing local economic activity within these neighbourhoods. 

1   

The goals and objectives of the plan are, without question, very well grounded in the current needs of  apartment tower communities, and are therefore not up for debate in this report. However, the major  limitation to achieving the goals and objective of the plan is financing the major capital investments  needed for these tower neighbourhoods. Current investments are conducted on an "as needed basis",  where most investments are made to meet basic liveability standards (City of Toronto, 2011). Simply  put, these towers are privately owned by corporations that may not have the sufficient capital resources  to invest large sums of money into their towers and/or lack the incentive to make the necessary  investments. Accordingly, achieving the objectives of the plan are reliant on the implementation of a  feasible financing model.   Acknowledging this issue, Toronto staff worked in partnership with Morrison Park Advisors to develop a  financing model with a lowinterest and secured source of funding that is financially viable for building  owners and the City, the latter being the main contributor to lending the capital required for  improvements (City of Toronto, 2011). Strictly speaking, the current model is predicated on improving  the overall sustainability of apartment towers. Unfortunately the current focus does not address the  other objectives set out in the plan.   An inventory of the existing apartment tower stock in Toronto revealed that on average individual  apartment tower lots had an average area of 1 hectare. Approximately 90% of this land is considered  underdeveloped ­ clustered nodes providing even larger lot sizes by combining contiguous parcels of  land (E.R.A. Architects; University of Toronto, 2008). Not only can this surplus space be repurposed for  infill opportunities that introduce additional housing and community amenities, they are also a  significant capital holding that apartment tower owners can sell for capital gains. These funds can be  reinvested into their towers, and improve liveability for residents.  Developable land in Toronto is arguably the best form of currency to individuals seeking to invest in the  City, and add to their development pipeline for immediate and future capital growth. In the context of  Toronto, the areas that are most rich with "shovel ready lands" are located in the innersuburb tower  neighbourhoods. This constitutes a significant opportunity for attracting investments to areas of 

2   

marginal investment and meeting the objectives of the tower renewal initiative by addressing, in part,  current financing barriers.  This will reduce the reliance on city assisted funding for apartment tower  renewal projects aimed at increased sustainability.  The goal of this research paper is to assess if surplus land resources available to apartment tower  owners can be leveraged as the primary development funding source to introduce the array of uses that  the City of Toronto recommends for tower neighbourhoods, and create a development model (i.e.  proforma) that relies on this source of funding to pay for the envisioned goals and objectives of the  tower renewal initiative.   To accomplish this, a literature and policy review was undertaken to assess where the apartment  renewal movement currently stands; the importance of introducing commercial uses within residential  neighbourhoods; and the current provincial and city legislative planning framework that enables this  form of development (asofright) as well as the key changes that would be required. Following this  contextual analysis, site visits were conducted across the innersuburbs of Toronto to gain on the  ground information of 10 apartment tower clusters. The information gathered was used to develop  potential development scenarios. The final phase of the research entailed the creation of a development  model with a low and high buildout scenario that is transferrable to other apartment clusters within the  city. This will assist the city in assessing development potential for tower clusters, and kickstart the  discussion for future investments. Over time, more accurate figures can be added to identify potential  underlying issues that this research paper was not able to identify.   Ultimately, this tool can be used to create a more informed discussion on how the City of Toronto and  its many tower owners can begin to implement the goals and objectives of the Tower Renewal initiative.

METHODOLOGY

The project's methodology consisted of three phases: a literature and policy review component (Phase  I); a site reconnaissance component (Phase II); and a development scenario component (Phase III). The  below sections explain the process that was followed to complete each phase.  

2.1

CONCEPTS:

The following concepts will be used throughout the report, and represent baseline definitions:  Anchor business: defined as an operation that: 1) has a recognizable brand to individuals inside and  outside of the community; 2) has the greatest footprint in a node; 3) contributes the most to the  commercial rents within the node; 4) has a wider offering of products for consumers; and, 5) can  support other smaller commercial units through spillover effects, whereby attracting consumers to the  area and housing employees (this is dependent on the type of establishments, where in some instances  larger businesses can push out small ones due to their competitive pricing).   Assessment value: Defined as the dollar value assigned to a property, reviewed on a yearly basis, to  measure the applicable property taxes. The value is determined by the Municipal Property Assessment  Corporation (MPAC) using comparable sales and onsite inspections to determine the value of the  property asset. Generally, the value of the assessment is lower than the appraised fair market value.  This information was be drawn from the City of Toronto registry.  Complete communities: the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe defines complete  communities as: "meet[ing] people's needs for daily living throughout an entire lifetime by providing  convenient access to an appropriate mix of jobs, local services, a full range of housing, and community infrastructureincluding affordablehousing, schools, recreation and open space for their residents.  Convenient access to public transportation and options for safe, nonmotorized travel is also provided."  (Ministry of Infrastructure, 2012, p. 47) 

4   

Developable area: Defined as the ground surface within an identified apartment site or cluster that has  no major built structure(s) of significance (e.g. apartment towers), and that can be repurposed infill  activities. This area can include both landscaped (e.g. grass) and hardscaped surfaces (e.g. parking).  Development model: Speaks to the strategy utilized for capitalizing on existing land holdings and built  features, the development proforma, scenarios for buildout, and funding strategies (capital sources).   Development proforma: Defined as a method to calculate future financial results of a proposed change  to a development property, and to emphasize whether a development is economically feasible or sound,  and whether it meets the financial expectations from investors and other interested parties.  Infill Initiatives: Any form of development which occurs within the underutilized space within a site. In  this context, it is defined by the development of open space between apartment buildings within an  apartment cluster; the spaces between individual buildings; or redeveloping the podium of a tower.  Large conglomerate businesses: Defined as an establishment which employs between 50500+  employees, which is owned and operated by corporations which are not local to the community, and  have a lesser impacts on local economies.  Small independent businesses: Defined as an establishment which employs between 150 employees,  which are owned and operated independently by individuals with ties to the local neighbourhood,  municipality, or region. Typically does not include retail chains.   Areas of Marginal Investment: Defined in the context of this study as a geographic area within the city  which is less desirable to residents and commercial operators to locate due to a lack of existing  amenities and services, reducing overall residential and commercial realestate values. As a causal  effect, little investment is made within these areas due to their low returns.  Tower Podium: Defined as the ground floors of an apartment tower that extends beyond the foot print  (i.e. floor plate) of the tower itself. Typically house ancillary nonresidential uses that serve the  immediate and surrounding community. 

5   

2.2

LITERATURE AND POLICY REVIEW ­ PHASE I

The first phase of the research comprised of a literature review of the "tower in the park" built form; the  apartment tower renewal initiative in Toronto; and the importance of small businesses; a policy review  of the existing regional and city of Toronto planning framework of apartment tower uses; and a review  of the recommended funding strategy for funding apartment tower renewal. Sources used to inform  these sections included journal articles from planning and economic development journals; planning  legislation and policies; planning reports; and key informant interviews. 

2.3

SITE RECONNAISSANCE RESEARCH DESIGN ­ PHASE II:

The second phase of the research involved the collection of primary site data. Information gathered  consisted of existing land holdings, amenities, and development potential. The findings of these  assessments served as the starting point for creating a development proforma for individual tower  projects, and identify different development and funding scenarios for full buildout. 

Site Selection and Property Mapping
A sample population of 10 apartment tower clusters were selected to assess their development  potential for ground floor podium projects and general infill opportunities. The following criteria were  used to select tower properties within Toronto's boundary:  I. The site must be within the inner suburbs of Toronto, which include the former city of  Etobicoke, North York, York, and Scarborough.  II. The site is designated "Apartment Neighbourhood" under the current city of Toronto Official  Plan, and area zoned "Residential Apartment" in the consolidated zoning bylaw 05692013.  III. IV. V. The site is adjacent to a road classified as a collector road, minor arterial, or major arterial.  The cluster is at least 1 hectare in size.  A minimum of 5 sites must consist of apartment towers that do not currently have commercial  and/or community services and amenities. 

6   

VI.

All Toronto Tower Renewal pilot projects (Kipling; Parkview; Markham; Shaughnessy) located  within the innersuburbs were selected. 

VII.

A maximum of four sites selected can have an existing ground floor commercial and/or  community amenity podium. 

Selected properties were mapped within the context of the City using GIS software. AutoCAD data was  also extracted to draft detailed contextual plans of the immediate neighbourhood and used to render  detailed site plans to assess infill potential on site (City of Toronto, 2012). 

Site Visits and Amenity Inventory
For each site visit, property and tower structure attributes were inventoried and listed in a tabular  format, to facilitate comparison between different tower properties or clusters.  The following elements  were sought and listed during each site visit:  Inventory of built structures on site  I. Apartment tower(s) ­ Number of  towers on a site; residential floors;  approximation of number of units  per floor (counting balconies)  II. III. IV. V. VI. Podium(s)  Community amenities  Commercial uses  Presence of a grocery store  Parking pads/structures    III. Inventory of uses within a 250m of site  I. II. Commercial uses  Community amenities, services, and  infrastructure  Transit availability (bus or subway  access) 

Site Specific Valuations:
To improve the accuracy of the development proforma, data pertaining to all observed tower's revenue  generation and operation expenses were estimated (using the below methodology). Estimations were  then used to evaluate the residual land values of the conveyed property created by severances, the  7   

remaining tower properties, and leases for commercial units within the podium of existing towers. The  subsections that follow explain the different variable sets used to inform the development scenarios.  VARIABLE SET A ­ PARCEL SIZE AND SITE COVERAGE ESTIMATIONS:  Using digital sources, land coverage information was accumulated to assess the existing built form of the  selected tower case studies, and infill potential. Total lot sizes allow for the estimation of the asset's  value as a whole, and residual land value (without the apartment structure).   Variables:  1. Municipal Address  2. Site size (ha)  3. Building Footprint    Methodology:  I. City of Toronto (2012) parcel boundary data was extracted from Ryerson's MADAR library  resources ­ relevant layers from boundary data files included the following:  a. PROPERTY_LINE_PDM: Denotes parcel boundaries based on ownership and municipal  addresses  b. BUILDING_LINE_PDM: Denotes existing building footprint as of 2012  c. MUNICIPAL_NUMBER_PDM: Denotes the municipal address of individual parcels  II. Parking podiums were not included in the existing parcel boundary data extracted, requiring  that they be derived from City of Toronto 2012 Orthoimagery (aerial photography)  a. Using a combination of extracted City of Toronto (2012) parcel boundary CAD drawings  and City of Toronto (2012) Orthoimagery, datasets were imported into ArcGIS. Parking  podiums were drawn using orthoimages as a base. Newly drawn parking podiums were  imported into AutoCAD for further analysis.  III. Site coverage was estimated using the "area" tool in AutoCAD software. The following variables  were extracted using hectares as a primary unit:  a. Site area (ha) ­ PROPERTY_LINE_PDM as source data  8    4. Parking Coverage  5. Residual Land (ha + %)  6. Buildable lot size (ha) 

b. Building footprint (ha) ­ BUILDING_LINE_PDM as source data  c. Parking podiums (ha) ­ Orthoimagery as source data  IV. The surplus land was measured in hectares and ratios of the total area that was not developed  were calculated.    V. Total buildable area was calculated on a perparcel basis. Potential site conveyances were  proposed and estimated for two scenarios. These conveyances were used to estimate the total  capital that can be gained through the sale of conveyed lands ­ further discussed in  "Assessment of Infill Potential & Development Proforma".  VARIABLE SET B ­ TOWER REVENUE GENERATION POTENTIAL:  To estimate the total asset value and residual land value of individual tower lots, total yearly revenue  per tower was calculated. Variables used to estimate total revenues were compiled using a number of  sources and data collection methods, including: tower owner websites; rental broker websites; and  photographs taken during onsite visits.    Variables:  1. 2. 3. 4. Tower owner(s)  Number of residential floors  Total number of units per floor  Number of 1, 2, and 3 bedroom  units per floor  5. Unit sizes (per square foot)  6. Monthly rate per unit type  7. Monthly revenues per tower  8. Annual revenues per tower 

Methodology:  I. Tower owners were found using websources, searching the tower's municipal address ­ they  were subsequently crossreferenced using MPAC data.  II. III. During site visits, the number of residential floors per tower were counted and recorded.  Number of units per floor were estimated by counting the number of balconies, and applying  the ratios shown in Figure 1 (% of Totals). Ratios were calculated by Kesik & Saleff (2009, pp. A 4) in the Tower Renewal Guidelines.

VARIABLE SET C ­ TOWER SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL COSTS:  To estimate the total asset value and residual land value of the individual tower lots, total operation  costs were needed. Given the high number of apartment sites surveyed, individual operational costs,  building maintenance costs, and mortgage repayment fees were not collected.           

10   

Variables:  1. Building utility costs (hydro & water)   using comparable tower GFAs  3. MPAC assessed property value (City of  Toronto Registry Office)  Methodology:  I. Building utility costs were estimated using the Ministry of Natural Resources Canada, Office of  Energy Efficiency's Screening Tool for New Building Design (http://www.screeningtool.ca). The  same tool was used by Kesik, T., & Saleff, I. (2009, p. 137) in the "Tower Renewal Guidelines" to  set a baseline estimation of utility costs for different tower archetypes. Estimations were made  for towers ranging from 15,000 m2 to 65,000 m2 at 5,000 m2 intervals.  II. III. Mortgage repayment fees were assumed to be $0.00 per annum.  Building maintenance costs were calculated at 40.00% of yearly revenues. This represents an  estimation that was regarded as acceptable from the Toronto Community Housing Corporation's  (2014) viewpoint. This ratio includes works related to building upkeep (e.g. cleaning) and  structural and mechanical maintenance (e.g. window replacement, boiler repairs).  IV. Property tax rates for multiresidential was taken from the City of Toronto website. 2013 rates  are 1.91% of the assessed value of the property. To value yearly property taxation, the tax rate  was applied to 2014 MPAC assessed property values for each tower (drawn from the City of  Toronto Registry Services desk). The calculation is as follows:       V.   These values combined comprise the total operational costs for an apartment tower.        1.91%     2.

Assessment of Infill Potential & Development Proforma:
Once site characteristics and valuations were collected and documented, using CAD software, buildable  areas were approximated for future infill development and tower podium construction. Values for the  buildable lot areas were calculated in phase III of the study. Using Metropia's (2014) residual land  valuation methodology, land valuations were calculated for the newly created infill lots. These results  were also used to estimate uplift values for potential section 37 contributions.

DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO CREATION ­ PHASE III:

The final phase of the research consisted of incorporating data gathered during phase II into two  development proformas. A high and low buildout scenario was created. Two clusters were selected  based on their identified infill potential determined in phase II of the methodology.  The purpose of this phase sought to assess how buildable areas of tower clusters could be used to  finance tower renewal objectives. This could be achieved through the land sales or through joint  partnerships with the public sector (e.g. introduction of community amenities) or the private sector (e.g.  introduction of additional housing stock or commercial amenities) to develop the surplus developable  lands or to introduce  ground floor podium uses in the existing tower structures.  These proformas can be used as a financing template for other apartment tower clusters across the city,  and potentially other municipalities within the Greater Golden Horseshoe that have high concentrations  of apartment tower neighbourhoods as identified in the Ontario Ministry of Infrastructure Tower  Renewal Initiative (2010).  The following are the build out scenarios with associated uses that were reviewed:  LOW BUILDOUT  1. New tower podium with:  a. Residential (market/rental)  b. Commercial Retail Units  c.

LITERATURE REVIEW
TOWERS IN THE PARK

During the early 20th century when the pioneers of planning were discussing the Garden City movement  and its numerous variations, Le Corbusier, a Swiss architect, went against the prevalent model of  creating lowdensity suburbs at the peripheries of cities on open green lots.  Instead he proposed an  alternate vision. In his Ville Radieuse, Le Corbusier preferred a development form that remained in the  existing city, and proposed substituting "the congested, interlayered city" built form with soaring towers  separated by wide roadways and large expanses of green space. These residential towers were to be  spaced 400 meters atop of subway stations to be accompanied by a major highway radiating from a  central location at the core of the neighbourhood unit.   Ultimately, the result would be an orderly planned neighbourhood unit, which had a less dense built  form (albeit higher concentrations of residential units) with increased breathing room, ridding itself  from the city of old' chaos. (Sewell, 1993). 

3.1.1 Why Towers in the Park?
Le Corbusier's model garnered significant support for the achievable results his scheme would provide.  His "tower in the park" idea would be able to achieve densities well above 400 units per hectare by  constructing 45 meter towers that would only cover approximately 12% of the total lot area, leaving the  remainder of the space for accessible park uses. Underground parking was also strongly pursued to  reduce the amount of surficial parking space. The country was brought to the city. (Sewell, 1993)  It was well accepted at the time for its focus on abundant open green space, its reliance on pedestrian  walkways to move residents from place to place, a rejection of traditional forms of housing, maintaining  the idea of separation of uses (which at the time was perceived as bestpractice), and a shunning of grid  street patterns in favour of looping discontinuous roads (again, consistent with the views at the time,  and resembled the Garden City scheme).  16   

As the model gained prominence in urban built forms, the perceived advantages to the model began to  display negative repercussions. To name a few: single use neighbourhoods where not as successful as  once perceived; discontinuous roads provided limited accessibility to community amenities (if they  existed) as well as access to other areas in the city; large expanses of green space were overwhelming,  and in fact reduced the relation these towers had to the street; walking was possible but not enjoyable;  the subway transit that was meant to serve the neighbourhood never materialized.  Once a preferred form of housing of both planners and private developers, the tower in the park  scheme began to lose popularity by the 1970's, as citizen groups began to mobilize against this  modernist view of planning and development, leading to its eventual abandonment. 

3.1.2 Current Challenges
Although Le Corbusier's initial vision had promise in creating a functional and complete community for  its future residents, the end product that the city is left with today is not reflective of what was once  envisioned, and has led to significant challenges for the residents of these neighbourhoods. 

Under-Serviced Communities
Apartment tower neighbourhoods today have a built form geared toward automobile usage and single  use zoning standards. Accordingly, these neighbourhoods are disconnected from many community and  commercial amenities that their residents typically rely upon on a daily basis. Having population  densities comparable to the downtown core of the city, these neighbourhoods lack active main streets,  services, shops, employment, and public spaces for communal gathering. In many instances, they are  located in service and food deserts. Residents are faced with either the option to drive (if available), wait  for bus services, or walk in some of the least walkable and disconnected areas of the city.   Even the once revered open spaces envisioned in the "tower in the park" scheme are deteriorating,  fragmented from the neighbourhood, and in most instances inaccessible and unsafe for pedestrians. As  such, the provision of communal space is now lost, short of these areas being revitalized. (E.R.A.  Architects; University of Toronto, 2008)  17   

The demographic makeup of these communities has also evolved over time, as they have become areas  of ethnic and cultural diversity, and typified as reception hubs for newcomers because these are some  of the most affordable areas in the city. The single use organization of these communities, and the lack  of infrastructure make it significantly difficult for residents to access services, and to encourage  entrepreneurship and investment directly within the neighbourhood. (E.R.A. Architects; University of  Toronto, 2008) 

Aging and Inefficient Buildings
These structures were designed during a time of cheap energy when environmental sustainability was  not a primary concern. Today's building science principles that seek to increase overall efficiencies were  not part of their design, making them the highest consumers of energy and emitters of greenhouse  gases in the city. To further aggravate the issue, tower building envelopes are aging, many of which  surpassing their anticipated life cycle (windows especially). A lack of renewal funds from owners has led  to a long list of deferred maintenance (E.R.A. Architects; University of Toronto, 2008). This not only  impacts the environment, but also operational expenses as sudden increases would challenge building  owners due to their limited ability to increase rents to compensate for the additional costs.

A Polarized City
As David Hulchanski (2007) pointed out in his Three Cities study (represented in Figure 5), the spatial  income polarization of Toronto's neighbourhoods, since the 1960s a significant shift in pockets of wealth  and poverty has occurred in the formerly middle income city. Although Toronto's apartment towers are  spatially distributed across the city, the majority of the stock is located in a third city represented by  areas that are significantly challenged by increased levels of poverty and inadequate services such as  transit, social and community services (E.R.A. Architects; University of Toronto, 2008).  
Figure 5: Three Cities ­ Average individual income from all sources

  Poverty in Toronto is predominantly located in the modernist tower developments of the past that are  areas of little investment and regeneration. Figure 6 is a representation of the distribution of apartment  tower neighbourhoods throughout Toronto that are clusters requiring a high level of social needs.      19   

Figure 6: Distribution of Apartment Tower Neighbourhoods throughout Toronto (Stewart, 2014)

 

A Neglected Resource
Candidly spoken, apartment neighbourhoods are not providing the quality of life that was once  intended, and have instead fallen in disrepair and face numerous challenges.  Notwithstanding this grim reality, they are collectively one of Toronto's greatest asset, moreover, one of  Toronto's largest land asset. The "parks" that surround these towers have been repurposed for surface  parking spaces, have abandoned their pools, are home to numerous dumpsters, and are segregated by  countless meters of chain link fences (E.R.A. Architects; University of Toronto, 2008). They are not  meeting their intended purpose.  Nevertheless, there is the opportunity to breathe new life in these grassy/muddy surfaces with  amenities that can positively bolster these neighbourhoods to better serve the residents they house.

3.2

THE APARTMENT TOWER RENEWAL INITIATIVE

In response to growing concerns surrounding the aging tower building stock within the city the former  Mayor of Toronto, David Miller, initiated in 2008 a Toronto based assessment to underline key problems  and identify potential solutions to improving Toronto's apartment tower resources. With the assistance  of E.R.A. Architects, an assessment of tower stock was conducted, which reviewed the tower building  stock's lifecycles, environmental impacts, social contributions, prevalence in the rental market, and their  underbuilt morphology that can be leveraged as potential opportunities to create complete  communities and intensify through infill activities (E.R.A. Architects, 2010). Following implementation of  the Tower Renewal initiative, the City initiated in 2008 five pilot projects across the City to estimate the  benefits of the initiative and garner more City Council support (shown in Figure 7 below).  
Figure 7: City of Toronto Tower Renewal Pilot Sites

21   

These projects are ongoing, and have survived the new administration elected in 2010. The primary  challenge in moving the Tower Renewal initiative forward, which was identified in the Tower Renewal  Implementation Handbook (2011), and persists to this day, is the implementation of a viable financing  strategy that is acceptable to the city's administration and tower owners. This issue is especially  problematic considering the loss of the initiative's champion, former mayor David Miller, and a current  administration with different objectives. Today, the Tower Renewal staff continues to work on the  initiated pilot sites, awaiting further direction in finalizing its funding model to begin rolling out the  initiative (City of Toronto, 2011).  Between 2008 and 2010, Toronto staff has worked closely with Morrison Park Advisors to develop a  model with a lowinterest and secured source of funding that is viable for the City, building owners, and  investors (City of Toronto, 2011). The recommended approach consisted of establishing a Tower  Renewal Corporation, which would comprise of an arm's length city agency, that would manage  financing arrangements with building owners through longterm contracts, and would be responsible for  ensuring improvements are implemented in a fashion that meets the expectations of the building  guidelines developed by the City  (Mayor's Tower Renewal: Opportunities Book) over the life of the  project. Funds allocated by the Corporation would be secured through a propertylien arrangement ­  further information on this topic is found in Section 4.2 Financing Options Reviewed for Apartment  Renewal (Morrison Park Advisors, 2010; Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2006).  The comprehensive set of goals apartment tower renewal strategy to enhance the preexisting  apartment tower housing stock encompass 1) the creation of a cleaner and greener tower stock; 2)  creation of stronger communities; 3) increasing the social and cultural benefits to residents; and 4)  enhancing local economic activity within apartment neighbourhood communities. 

3.2.1 Major Benefits and Opportunities of the Tower Renewal Initiative
The apartment tower renewal initiative focuses strongly on preserving and enhancing a building  typology of the modernist era that collectively houses approximately one million of the Greater Toronto  region's population, as an alternative to costly and disruptive removal and redevelopment initiatives  22   

(McClelland, Stewart, & Ord, 2011). Both the City of Toronto (2011) and E.R.A. Architects (2010)  identified major opportunities for tower renewal, three of which have been selected for this discussion.   The first consists of leveraging the existing tower's structural fabric ­ having a long and renewable life cycle ­ and increasing the efficiency of buildings through targeted green technology enhancements, thus  lowering total carbon footprints and associated operational costs. On a per square metre average, slab  apartment towers consume 20% more energy than any other type of housing (E.R.A. Architects;  University of Toronto, 2008). Estimates have shown that retrofitting towers Citywide could reduce the  greenhouse gas output by over 700,000 tonnes CO2 per year, and reduce the per building consumption  of electricity by 50%, natural gas by more than 50%, water by 20%, and improve waste diversion by over  30% (E.R.A. Architects; University of Toronto, 2008). The current funding model is predicated on these  cost savings as a means to payback the invested capital improvements to a tower's efficiency.  Secondly, individual lots measure on average 1 hectare in size, and on average 90 percent of apartment  tower sites are underdeveloped ­ clustered nodes provide even larger lot sizes. This surplus space can  be repurposed for infill opportunities (Kesik & Saleff, 2009). Surplus lands provide a form of equity that  can be sold or transferred for infill developments purposes, while the sale proceeds could be used to  fund tower specific initiatives and improvements. Infill potential provides the opportunity to introduce  new commercial and/or social amenities on site and new housing options (tenure and form). This would  generate direct benefit to existing and future residents of apartment tower neighbourhoods. The  municipality would also benefit  from infill, in that they will be meeting the intent of the Growth Plan of  creating complete communities; introducing new market and purposebuilt rental units (potentially at  affordable rates by leveraging section 37 contributions); adding revenue generators to the city's tax  base; and increasing employment opportunities for residents.    Lastly, existing residential densities within apartment neighbourhoods can range between 150 to 350  people per hectare and in some instances reach up to 500 persons per hectare, already exceeding the 50  persons and jobs per hectare called for by the Growth Plan. This population density increases the  feasibility of introducing new higher order transit lines and creating transit oriented mixeduse nodes. 

23   

Across the Greater Toronto Area and Hamilton over 14% of apartment towers are located in existing  growth nodes, and 55% are located along major arterial roads, both locations where the plan calls for  increased intensification and the creation of mixeduse environments and complete communities (Kesik  & Saleff, 2009; Ministry of Infrastructure, 2012; McClelland, Stewart, & Ord, 2011).  Altogether, reenvisioning tower neighbourhoods within the city as areas of potential growth and  investment allows a municipality to meet a number of provincial and local planning initiatives that are  difficult to implement, often due to a lack of available lands. 

3.2.2 Current Focus of the Tower Renewal Financing Model
Morrison Park Advisors' primary mandate was to develop a financing strategy predicated on funding  building improvements aimed at operational efficiencies and resource consumption, by reallocating  funds accrued through operational costsavings in repaying retrofit investments secured by a Tower  Renewal Corporation. This model is comparable to a number of European tower renewal projects that  relied on operational savings to payback initial investments and fund additional projects aimed at  increasing total amenity spaces and introducing commercial uses within apartment clusters.  The primary limitation of Morrison Park Advisor's recommended funding model is the fine balancing act  required to repay the initial investments made towards increased building efficiencies, and funding the  other goals and objectives of the initiative. This limitation stems from the comparative cost of energy in  North America and Europe, the latter being significantly higher. Due to the low utility costs charged to  Toronto residents, the savings acquired through increased efficiencies are marginally sufficient to fund  tower efficiency capital investments, leaving little to no residual revenues that can be invested in  improving the social and economic fabric of tower neighbourhoods.   One could argue that once capital investment financing has been amortized, the savings from  efficiencies can then be reinvested to fund other tower renewal objectives. However, there are  significant limitations to this approach. 

24   

Amortization periods for tower specific efficiency improvements can range between 3 years for marginal  system improvements to over 20 years for more comprehensive improvements to the structure. Figure  8 lists a number of potential enhancements that can be made to a typical 20 storey apartment tower  archetype, as calculated by Kesik & Saleff (2009) in their Tower Renewal Guideline document.  Repayment of these investments are highly reliant on fluctuating energy prices and efficiencies, and  cannot risk adding additional strain on existing financing plans. Altogether, it may take a number of  years before new investments can be funded through building efficiencies.

25   

Although the current financing strategy does not directly identify means of financing other tower  initiatives, the City of Toronto Tower Renewal Implementation Handbook (2011) presents a longterm  phased enrolment system, the Sustainable Towers Engaging People (STEP) program, which seeks to  meet the intent of enhancing the social realm. The STEP program is: "designed to incrementally build  the capacity of property owner to undertake substantial Tower Renewal projects, and outline the  various types of support available to owners by the City and by other Tower Renewal partners" (City of  Toronto, 2011, p. 17). Nevertheless, the program does not sufficiently address how these projects are to  be funded beyond improved efficiencies, and this presents another key limitation to the current  program framework.  Relying on savings from increased efficiencies to fund the introduction of new community and  commercial amenities assumes that building owners will opt to invest in improvements that may not  provide a direct benefit to their assets. Ultimately, this may not materialize, as owners may instead  prefer to apply these accumulated funds to ongoing and future tower or site specific improvements.  Strictly speaking, in the Toronto context, the current focus of the model is most suitable in achieving the  goal of creating a cleaner and greener city by improving the overall sustainability of existing apartment  stocks within the City, and less so in community buildings. Additional attention must be allocated to a  financing model that permits the development of community based services and amenities concurrently  with building retrofits, and expedite the process of refurbishing Toronto's apartment tower stock.   Leveraging land holding as a capital asset should be given more attention, as it could open the door for  infill opportunities that create complete communities.

3.3

IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL AMENITIES IN APARTMENT TOWER CLUSTERS

Urban commercial amenities play a large role in defining the identity of communities within the City of  Toronto. They contribute to creating dynamic destinations consisting of mixed uses, distinct built forms,  active street life, and diverse demographic composition. Commercial use within an urban environment  contributes to the economic health of the local community by catering to residents as well as drawing  visitors within the area to walk, shop, and explore the many merchants that provide a variety of services  and goods.   A common factor seen in many established commercial activity nodes serving the immediate community  are the independent owners and operators as opposed to large commercial conglomerates. The  availability of underutilized lands in apartment tower clusters within the inner suburbs of Toronto  provides a new area that can accommodate the creation of new commercial nodes that cater specifically  to the residents.  The Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the enacted apartment tower renewal initiative  seek the creation of complete communities (see section 2.1). The city of Toronto in its planning  framework enables and encourages the development of these nodes across its jurisdiction through:  I. the provision of permissive zoning for mixed use operations, including residential, commercial,  and employment uses;  II. enacting Avenues and MidRise Buildings Studies Plans across a number of urban avenues that  aim to enhance the groundfloor experience of major throughways as well as integrate  seamless multimodal transportation connections that promote alternative modes of  transportation;   III. establishing distinct and strict urban design policies aimed to enhancing the built environment  as well as the pedestrian realm; and,  IV. encouraging active transportation as a means of moving around the City   (City of Toronto, 2010)   27   

Although the policy framework is in place to encourage the development of commercial activity nodes  within the core urban areas within the City, a significant challenge remains in attracting, establishing,  and maintaining viable and diverse commercial and retail uses within the innerring suburbs of Toronto,  more specifically apartment tower clusters (Grant & Perrot, 2009). Private investment incentives in  revitalizing these areas are lacking, and planning legislation has yet to be fully implemented to  accommodate the introduction of commercial uses in apartment tower clusters.   The focus of the following subsections will explore how infill opportunities within apartment tower  neighbourhoods constitute an opportunity to establish new commercial nodes within the City of  Toronto and fill the gap in providing amenities within a proximate distance to local residents. The social  and economic benefits of smallretail establishment in contrast to their conglomerate and chain  counterparts and how the two can coexist in a synergetic relationship will also be discussed. 

3.3.1 The Small Businesses Advantage
Small businesses contribute both to the social fabric of communities and the overall definition of  community character, in turn creating the perception of place or "insideness", to which Relph defined as  a "degree of attachment or involvement that one has in a particular place" (Alexander & Shaw, 2012, p.  31). Some of the earliest contributions to the discussion of this intrinsic value comes from Jane Jacobs  (1961), who championed the importance of local businesses as being integral to street life, creating  community, enhancing the perception of safety (eyes on the street), and enhancing neighbourhood  character. In her thesis dissertation, Menzies (2008) observed that small B.C. businesses had far greater  levels of involvement within their communities; contributions included donation of goods and services;  financial contributions; sponsorships for sport teams; promotion of nonprofit organizations; and  employee services. Simply put, the presence of commercial activities help meet the Tower Renewal  Initiative of bolstering the economic health of tower neighbourhoods  Small businesses are significant contributors to the local and regional economy and comprise of a total  of 94% of the total market share of businesses within Ontario, making them a significant force  (Alexander & Shaw, 2012; Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses, 2010). Mom and pop stores  28   

and independent businesses have the ability to strengthen local economies and strengthen  neighbourhood fabric (LiveWorkLearnPlay, 2010).   Small businesses are also more diverse in their offerings comparatively to larger conglomerates,  providing goods and services that are more specialized and that cater to specific segments of the  population, whether socially, economically, or ethnically (Alexander & Shaw, 2012). Florida (2002),  Goodno (2005), Sutton (2010), and Qadeer (1997) all speak to the importance of establishing  heterogeneous business types and targeted consumers to attract a greater mix of social and ethnic  backgrounds within the population inhabiting or visiting the area.   Local economic impacts can be measured by three components: their direct, indirect, and induced  impacts on a wider economy (Alexander & Shaw, 2012). Direct impacts constitute spending which is  required for a business to operate, whereas indirect impacts address external economic effects. Induced  impact is defined as a multiplier effect where business owners and employees spend money in other  local businesses, thus reinvesting in their own communities (Alexander & Shaw, 2012; Wang & Rainer  vom, 2007). The Maine Economic Centre for Economic Policy (2011) and the Institute for Local Self  Reliance (2003) collected data from local small retail businesses and larger conglomerate and found  local businesses can generate approximately 76% larger returns to the local economy as opposed to  large retail conglomerates.   Small businesses are uses that can be easily accommodated within the space available on the ground  floor of apartment buildings, newly built podium spaces, and infill commercial developments, providing  an array of amenities and services that cater directly to the residents. 

3.3.2

The Role of Larger Commercial Conglomerates (National Chains)

Contrary to the popular perception of larger commercial conglomerates being a detriment to smaller  retail operations, the former can in fact provide direct benefits to the community and to their smaller  business counterparts if they are integrated intelligently.   

29   

As discussed, smaller retailers are recognized as having the role of contributing to the creation of a  unique character within a community, and catering specifically to the commercial needs and culture of  the local neighbourhood, whereas larger conglomerates provide lower prices, larger selections,  recognized brands, and consistent quality across multiple locations (LiveWorkLearnPlay, 2010).  Accordingly, it is possible that both large and small retailer can coexist in the same environment, and  benefit from one another's specific offerings.  Artz (2012) and Hicks (2012) undertook a set of American based studies that reviewed the impact of big box retailers on small local businesses ­ more specifically WalMart ­ in the immediate and long term (15  years). Both studies concluded that bigbox retailers have both positive and negative impacts on local  businesses in the short and long term. The availability of lower cost general merchandise made it  difficult for small general store retailers to compete, whereas smaller retailers that specialized in a  certain type of good or in food services either felt no impact from the presence of a bigbox retailer, or  benefitted from its presence as trip frequencies to Walmart increased. Lastly, Hicks (2012) observed that  American consumers frequenting WalMart and competing bigbox store, especially in the lowincome  strata, save up to $18 billion a year, where money can be spent or reinvested in other activities,  potentially other local commercial stores.  The key takeaway to note is that larger commercial operation can act as the commercial anchor  (destination) of a commercial node within a community, attracting a wider array and number of  consumers to an area (anchor use defined on page 4).   Another consideration is the capital pool national chains have at their disposal for investing in new  outlets.  This provides a greater level of reassurance to investors building in apartment tower  neighbourhoods, as opposed to relying solely on smaller commercial operators, which have little  available capital at their disposal and where success is less reassured. Development regulations, such as  Section 37, can also be leveraged to provide additional benefits to the community in the upzoning of  apartment tower lands (further discussed in section 4.1  Planning Framework).

CITY OF TORONTO CONTEXT: MOVING THE INITIATIVE FORWARD
PLANNING FRAMEWORK

Unlike European apartment neighbourhoods that were originally planned with retail, cafés, markets,  kiosks, and public services, their Toronto counterparts suffer from a lack of services and amenities that  contribute to the creation of complete communities (E.R.A. Architects; University of Toronto, 2008). Due  to the prohibitive nature of zoning programs that originated from the 1960s, when a significant portion  of the stock was developed, many serve as bedroom communities that are autodependent and  disconnected from the commercial and public amenities that should be serving them. Notwithstanding  past trends, current legislation at both the provincial and local (Toronto) level is moving towards the  successful European model of apartment development (E.R.A. Architects, 2010). 

4.1.1

Provincial Policy Framework

The Tower Renewal initiative is linked to a number of provincial policies, including the Big Move ­  Metrolinx's Transportation Plan, Ontario's Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Go Green Action Plan, and  the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (hereafter referred to as the "Growth Plan"). These  plans seek to: connect residents to higherorder transit corridors; introduce services and amenities to  impoverished areas; reduce overall carbon emissions; and creating a more compact, complete, and  efficient form of development respectively (McClelland, Stewart, & Ord, 2011).  Tower neighbourhoods present an  opportunity to meet the goals of the Growth Plan (2005), whereby  presenting intensification opportunities through infill introduces a wider array of market and purpose  built rental properties,  community based social and commercial amenities. The existing built tower  structures, regarded as a highly resilient with renewable lifecycles, and availability of undeveloped  lands within tower neighbourhood can be leveraged as highly developable citywide activity hubs for the  establishment of complete and sustainable communities. 

31   

A wider array of housing types and tenures for current and future residents that seek to adapt their  living environment with their current lifestyle needs can be achieved through infill initiatives. Types of  new housing can include market housing, coops, rent to own, family sized housing units, multi generational housing, and senior housing (E.R.A. Architects; University of Toronto, 2008).  Metrolinx's transit plan and the Transit City Plan for Toronto are two initiatives that enable tower  neighbourhoods to be catalysts for future growth and investment within the inner suburbs of Toronto.  The existing residential densities of tower neighbourhood provide the necessary ridership levels to  support the development and operation of higherorder forms of transit; in addition, the benefits of  existing built form of larger rightsofway also facilitate the introduction of dedicated lane transit  systems.  These value added benefits would increase the desirability of tower neighbourhoods,  increase land  values, and in turn attract greater attention from private investors.  (E.R.A. Architects; University of  Toronto, 2008; Hulchanski, 2007) 

4.1.2

City of Toronto Policy Framework

Official Plan Policies:
Toronto's 2010 consolidated Official Plan provides direction in Section 4.2  Apartment Neighbourhoods  on future development growth standards for the City's established neighbourhood apartment tower  stock, which aligns with the directives of the Growth Plan's proposal for increased densities, and the  Tower Renewal initiative's proposal for introducing additional amenities and services.  The plan stresses  that approximately half of available dwelling units in Toronto are accounted for in this designation, and  these areas require a significant infusion of investment and improved amenities and services.  The plan states in Section 4.2, that "built up apartment neighbourhoods are stable areas of the City  where significant growth is generally not anticipated", but there are "opportunities for additional  townhouses or apartments on underutilized sites and this Plan sets out criteria to evaluate these 

32   

situations" (City of Toronto, 2010, pp. 45). These evaluating principles are set out in Section 4.2.2 &  Section 4.2.3 ­ Development Criteria in Apartment Neighbourhoods, which read: 
4.2.2  Development in Apartment Neighbourhoods will contribute to the quality of life by:  a) b) f)  g)  4.2.3  locating and massing new buildings to provide a transition between areas of different  development intensity and scale  locating and massing new buildings so as to adequately limit shadow impacts  providing indoor and outdoor amenity spaces  providing ground floor uses that enhance the safety, amenity and animation of adjacent  streets and open spaces 

Significant growth is generally not intended within developed Apartment Neighbourhoods. However,  compatible infill development may be permitted on a site containing an existing apartment that has  sufficient underutilized space to accommodate on or more new buildings while providing good quality of  life for both new and existing residents. Infill development that may be permitted on a site containing an  existing apartment building will:  b)  provide existing residents with access to the community benefits where additional height  and/or density is permitted and community benefits are provided pursuant to Section 5.1.1  (height and/or density incentives) of this Plan 

(City of Toronto, 2010, pp. 46)  Reviewing the Official Plan policies, it is apparent that future infill development within apartment  neighbourhoods is contingent on ensuring that all building activities benefit existing residents by  providing new amenities and services.  Infill should be sympathetic to the onsite and surrounding built  form where the intensity and scale of the development transitions between high and low density forms  of development ­ namely single family dwelling to high density towers.   In addition to development standards, the Plan also allows, through the passing of zoning bylaw  amendments, granting height and/or density increases for inkind or cashinlieu contributions for  community benefits, which are outlined in Section 5.1.1 ­ Height and/or density incentives, which reads: 
5.1.1  Height and/or density incentives: City can pass a zoning bylaw to grant a height and/or density  increase for a particular project that is greater that is greater than the zoning bylaw would permit in  return for community benefits such as: additional parkland, nonprofit arts, cultural, community or  child care facilities, public art, conservation of heritage buildings, transit improvements and purpose  built rental housing. 

(City of Toronto, 2010, pp. 51)  33   

Hypothetically, if private investment for infill activities is attracted to apartment tower renewal sites  located in innerring suburbs an opportunity presents itself to capture a portion of uplift values gained  through Section 37 contributions, and redirect those funds to fund the introduction of public services  and amenities to tower neighbourhoods. Allowing infill development could create direct and tangible  benefits for a community.  Section 37 contributions could be secured on an adhoc basis as infill development occurs. Alternatively,  the creation of area specific policies for specific apartment tower neighbourhood designations or  Secondary Plans could be implemented to better manage the contributions, ensure that the community  needs are mapped and assessed at an early stage prior to development, and provide greater  transparency to the community of the benefits they are to (or should) receive. This would equally grant  a greater degree of power to the City to acquire contributions, as is explained in Section 5.1.1.5, which  reads:  
1.1.1.5 Despite Policies 3 and 4, Section 37 may be used, irrespective of the size of the project or the  increase in height and/or density: c) where Secondary Plan or area specific policies in this Plan  contain Section 37 provisions that prevail. 

(City of Toronto, 2010, pp. 53)  Section 5.1.1.6 of the Official Plan outlines capital facility that are acceptable Section 37 contributions ­  most prevalent to tower projects are listed below ­ which reads as follows: 
1.1.1.6 Section 37 community benefits are capital facilities and/or cash contributions toward specific  capital facilities, above and beyond those that would otherwise be provided under the provisions of  the Planning Act or the Development Charges Act or other statute, including: 

  b)  c)  c)  e)  g)  i)  fully furnished and equipped nonprofit child care facilities, including startup funding;  public art;  other nonprofit arts, cultural, community or institutional facilities;  parkland, and/or park improvements  streetscape improvements on the public boulevard not abutting the site  purpose built housing with midrange or affordable rents, land for affordable housing, or,  at the discretion of the owner, cashinlieu of affordable rental units or land 

34   

j) 

local improvements to transit facilities including rapid and surface transit and pedestrian  connections to transit facilities 

m)  other local improvements identified through Community Improvement Plans, Secondary  Plan, Avenue Studies... community service and facility strategies, or other  implementation plans or studies. 

(City of Toronto, 2010, pp. 53)  A key takeaway from Toronto current Section 37 implementation guidelines is the ability to rely on infill  development to strengthening apartment neighbourhoods, through cash or inkind contributions and  the introduction of services. It implies that there is added value in implementing secondary plans or  special policy areas to better manage contributions to ensure a positive and direct impact on the subject  tower neighbourhoods while also meeting the overall goals of the initiative, provincial, and local plans.  Caution needs to be given to the degree and intensity of Section 37 contributions being made by private  investors to ensure it does not become a dissuading factor. A balance must be achieved.    

City of Toronto Zoning By-law 569-2013: Residential Apartment Commercial
During the development of Toronto's consolidated zoning bylaw 5692013, city staff worked closely  with the Centre for Urban Growth and Renewal (CUG+R) and United Way Toronto to develop a more  permissive zoning category for existing apartment tower neighbourhoods ­ currently zoned Residential  Apartment (RA) ­ that would permit asofright commercial and service based uses. The newly created  Residential Apartment Commercial (RAC) zone seeks to: "support asofright lowimpact mixed uses  within Apartment Neighbourhoods, such uses as small shops, farmers markets, smallscale institutions,  and community services, which are common in many traditional Toronto neighbourhoods yet have been  prohibited in most Apartment Neighbourhoods to date..." (E.R.A. Architects, 2012; City of Toronto,  2010). Refer to Appendix A: `RA' & `RAC' AsofRight Uses (ZB 5692013), for a complete list of all asof right uses.  A review of existing zoning maps for RA zone classifications indicates there are currently no sites within  the city that are zoned RAC, as seen in Figure 9.  As a result implementation will require zoning bylaw  amendments. Implementation of the RAC zone is slated to begin in spring of 2014, where a series of 

35   

public meetings are to be held to hear what the vertical neighbourhoods of Toronto foresee and desire  for their communities (Stewart, 2014). 
Figure 9: City of Toronto Residential Apartment Zone (City of Toronto, 2010)

 

Stewart (2014) points out that the implementation of the RAC zone in Toronto is an initial and key step  in meeting the Tower Renewal initiatives. It is the impetus to kickstart the program by allowing a greater  mix of uses that will close the existing service provision and commercial amenity gap that are currently  prohibited in the current RA zone. To display the potential benefits infill may bring, E.R.A. Architect will  assist the City of Toronto in its implementation of the RAC zone by displaying conceptual demonstration  projects during the community stakeholder meetings.  Notwithstanding the progress being made, there is a limitation to the RAC zone in the City of Toronto  zoning bylaw 5692013. Under Section 15.20.20.100 Conditions, heavy restrictions are placed on the  allowable floor space for an ancillary building committed to community services and commercial uses on  a site zoned RAC. This could deter investors and developers due to the lack of development flexibility  

36   

Greater coverage and densities could be reached ­ and in turn greater profit margins ­ if the lot were to  be severed, and rezoned to a more permissive zone classification. Considering the great infill potential  within these sites, lands severed for redevelopment under Section 51(24) of the Planning Act, could be  rezoned to medium density residential zones (RT & RM), or single or mixed use commercial zones (CL,  CR), maximizing the level of services provided.  Redevelopment of these sites can become increasingly complex as uses are introduced and new lots are  created. As such, these development proposals should be revised as a whole (Consent, OPA, ZBA, Site  Plan) to ensure the project fits into the surrounding context and that the new activities on site function  in synergy.  

Additional Planning Tools to Secure Needs
In meeting the Tower Renewal initiatives, private investors need to be present and actively involved.   Ultimately, they will seek a specific project return that is viable and meets their investment objectives.  In tandem to this, the City of Toronto recognizes that many apartment neighbourhood clusters require  significant investments to introduce community based amenities and services, and tower owners  recognize that their structures require significant investments in increasing utility efficiencies. All three  stakeholders have a specific `want and need' if they are to move forward with development activities.  Therefore it is crucial that all interests be placed on the table during discussions to ensure that the  process can be negotiated with ease, that desires are transparent, and that agreements are secured to  ensure implementation. Figure 10 summarizes tools available in the Planning Act in securing City  identified needs for the community in question.

FINANCING OPTIONS REVIEWED FOR APARTMENT RENEWAL

Renewing apartment structures for increased efficiencies alone is a capital heavy endeavour that  requires between $25,000$45,000 per unit that is likely to cost several million dollars per building  (E.R.A. Architects, 2010; Morrison Park Advisors, 2010). Considering approximately 67% of the  apartment tower stock in Toronto is privately owned (85% in the GTHA) an attractive financing strategy  with an acceptable rate of return must be integrated to encourage private investments. Given the  current Provincial financial climate, financing projects through provincial grants and subsidies is  unrealistic. As a result, the City has directed its financing strategy to rely predominantly on the City's  ability to assist owners in financing projects through its borrowing powers, and its ability to place liens  on properties. (Morrison Park Advisors, 2010). 

4.2.1 Owner Financing Options
The capital tower apartment owners have at their disposal is typically tied up as equity. Freeing up this  resource would require a new or additional mortgage or an unsecured form of financing.  If owners want  to invest their own capital or equity, an acceptable rate of return is applied as a benchmark, where  anything below is rejected.   The limited ability for building owners to raise rents ­ as imposed by the Residential Tenancies Act and  rates contingent on the market conditions of apartment tower neighbourhoods in Toronto ­ also  restricts their ability to raise substantial capital funds to reinvest into their apartment tower (Morrison  Park Advisors, 2010). Relying on tower owners to undertake unassisted capital heavy expenditures may  result in no action being taken.  Accordingly, owners may be more open to investing in such improvements if they acquired a significant  infusion of capital to reduce the overall payback period of the investment to a range more palatable to  their investment needs. 

39   

4.2.2 Government Based Financing
Municipalities wishing to participate in the tower renewal program already understand the longterm  benefits it will bring; however, preexisting operational and capital budget obligations limit borrowing  capacities. As such, the city of Toronto does not have the capacity to finance apartment tower renewal  projects within its jurisdiction, where a commitment of well over $2 billion dollars would be required for  improved building efficiencies alone, without taking the costs of improved community services and  amenities into account (Morrison Park Advisors, 2010).   Direct government financing, however, has the capacity to fund projects without placing too much  burden on owners and the city. The funding required for building improvements could be reached over  the life of the apartment renewal project by borrowing money from capital markets ­ namely those in  the United States which see Canadian municipal holdings as very desirable given their high yields and  excellent credit ratings, especially those with maturities of 30 and 40 years (Hanniman, 2013). However,  concerns that the city undertaking borrowing options would be fully liable for the additional debt  burden, without any forms of security to assure repayment from owners could inflate the interest rates  of the loan due to the risk of defaulted payments by tower owners.  Given that borrowing is the most viable means of securing funds for the apartment tower renewal  initiative, additional securities must be implemented to make financing more resilient and robust, while  ensuring the city does not undertake expenditures with unnecessary risk on their financial health.  

4.2.3 Municipal Forms of Security
Lenders typically prefer secured forms of loans, such as mortgages, as they provide greater reassurance  and powers to recoup some or all of their invested capital by seizing and selling the owner's asset(s) if a  default occurs.   If the City is to assist tower owners in providing direct financing at a lower interest rate, greater  investment security will be required if lenders are to provide the necessary funds at the appropriate 

40   

interest rate, and more reassurance and flexibility to the owners will need to be provided if owners are  to participate (Morrison Park Advisors, 2010).  

Property based obligations
Property taxes are the most significant and secure source of revenue for municipalities. Revenues are  secured through a "property lien" status, permitted under Ontario Regulation 594/06 (Ministry of  Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2006).  This ensures that when tax payments are defaulted, the amount  is linked to the property itself (Kitchen, 2002).   With a minor amendment to the permissions set out in O. Reg. 594/06, an opportunity is created to  utilize property liens to secure tower renewal investments made by the City. By providing property liens  to any capital investment made by the city for Tower Renewal purposes provides a method for the city  to enforce repayment. In the event of a defaulted payment, the investment could be recuperated with  far greater ease, bolstering security. This approach is more acceptable to tower owners comparatively to  unsecured financing and taking on a second mortgage, as the risk of losing their asset due to defaulted  payments is greatly reduced and payment flexibility is improved. 

4.2.4

Morrison Park Advisors' Recommended Approach: Credit-Enhanced Capital Pool

Morrison Park Advisors (2010) recommended that the city create a creditenhanced capital pool that  would be funded primarily through the issuance of bonds from the capital markets and secured through  an extension of the existing O.Reg. 594/06.  In order to enhance the credit ratings of the bonds issued from the capital market that are to be infused  into the capital pool, the City would need to "overcollateralize" the funds by providing a temporary  contribution of 3%10% of the total expected cost of the projects, which would have a far lesser impact  on the City's budget in comparison to full financing. Contributions to the fund can also be incrementally  added over the timeline of the project or program, reducing the overall impact to the City's budget  (Morrison Park Advisors, 2010).    

41   

4.2.5

City of Toronto Hi-RIS Program:

In waiting for the creation of the City of Toronto Renewal Corporation and the associated amendment to  O. Reg. 594/06, Toronto established the HighRise Retrofit Improvement Support Program (HiRIS), a  three year pilot program established in July of 2013, to assist multiresidential property owners fund  tower specific improvements for energy and water efficiency, and conservation improvements.  Altogether, city Council has approved a $10 million funding envelop (capital bank) to help finance  improvement, aimed to capturing a target of 10 buildings (City of Toronto, 2014).  The program was made possible through an amendment to provincial regulation regarding local  improvement charges to allow for municipalities to advance funding to participating property owners to  cover the initial improvement costs, and be repaid over a predetermined amortization period of the  load through a property lien agreement, plus the cost of borrowing and administration services from the  City. The term can range between 5 to 10 years terms, which reflect the useful life of the improvement  (City of Toronto, 2014). The financing arrangement are summarized in Figure 11 below.  Ultimately the program is a mirror image of the program Morrison Park Advisors is proposing, where the  sole difference is that it is managed by Tower Renewal staff.

4.3

MEETING THE APARTMENT TOWER GOALS:

The availability of underdeveloped lands within inner suburb tower neighbourhoods presents a distinct  redevelopment opportunity for developers and investors. An influx in privatesector investments could  enhance these neighbourhoods greatly as envisioned in the initiative.     The current financing model recommended by Morrison Park Advisors, and the application of the  current HiRIS program have been specifically designed to meet the objective of increasing building  sustainability, and less so the other initiatives proposed by the tower renewal initiative. Presently, the  implementation of the financing model is at a standstill, presenting an opportunity to undertake a  second review of additional financing strategies to fund the other plan objectives.   A strategy that deserves attention by Morrison Park and Advisors and the Tower Renewal department of  the City, consists of leveraging the available underutilized land assets through conveyances to the public  and private market, as an additional source of revenue to fund tower specific renovations, and reducing  the overall payback period of loans. Recall that on average, these modernist towers sit on lots averaging  one hectare in size (2.47 acres) with an average site coverage of 11%, providing a significant amount of  land for infill (E.R.A. Architects, 2010). The benefits of this are twofold, as the amount to finance from  the building owner's perspective is reduced, in turn reducing strains on the, albeit proposed, Tower  Renewal Corporation capital pool that relies on market bonds.  With the newly introduced Residential Apartment Zone (RAC) ­ ZBL 05692013 ­ that allows for  commercial uses and public services within apartment tower sites, the stage is set for the inclusion of  mixeduse activities within Toronto's innersuburbs.   Conveyance of lands for infill activities provides the opportunity to introduce a mix of market housing,  subsidised housing, and additional rental units for different lifestages on the tower site. With the  potential for new infill projects, land value capture tools such as Section 37 contributions could be used  to secure added revenues derived from the amendment to the new RAC zone, and direct funds to  introducing major social/amenity projects in or near the apartment neighbourhood.  43

SITE RECONNAISSANCE FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS

A total of 10 clusters were preselected prior to site visits and are shown below in Figure 12. As  mentioned in the methodology section, the clusters were spatially distributed across the inner suburbs  of Toronto, whereby one cluster in each former municipality was identified, save for Toronto proper. Of  the 10 clusters, Alton Tower was omitted as it consisted of a condominium cluster, and was no longer an  apartment site eligible for the Tower Renewal initiative. Appendix B presents all collected information  for each cluster.

From the clusters that were observed, several had community and commercial amenities on site, and an  even greater instance where these same services were provided within a 250 metre walking distance  from the site. Figure 13 below provides a summary of amenities that were identified during site visits  and further sitebysite research. A more detailed view is provided in Appendix B of the present report.

Non Residential Uses onsite

 

Non Residential Uses offsite

          

The presence of these uses does not preclude the fact that additional community and/or commercial  amenities, or an expansion, could not be supported and welcomed in the community. In fact, given the  findings of current urban tower challenges, there is a great need of additional social assistance.  Secondly, there is also opportunity to introduce commercial uses that better cater to the residents in  45   

1.

closer and more accessible distances. Both of these assertions are supported by the initial community  consultations that the Miller administration undertook in assessing community needs (Phibbes, 2014).  The following observations were made of the current availability of amenities: 

Social/Community Amenities:
I. The quality of onsite community centres and daycares structures appeared to be in disrepair,  warranting significant investment in retrofits, renovations, or replacement  a. uses in community centres were predominantly for child services, such as day and  summer camps  II. Community centres found within close proximity to the site offered a greater variety of  community based services (e.g. daycares, community space, ESL programs) and recreational  amenities, and appeared in better physical conditions.  III. In almost all instances, an elementary or secondary school site was located within a 250 metre  distance of the cluster and  provided programmed and maintained open space  IV. Exterior open spaces were present in vast quantities on all sites, however, further observations  showed that they were:  a. inaccessible to other towers and from the street and were fenced  b. significant pooling of water rendered the open space unusable for play  c. open spaces were rarely programed, and if they were, a central play structure was the  only programmed amenity, and pools appeared condemned and unmaintained  d. a lack of pathways connecting the open spaces to the tower and surrounding  destinations (such as commercial clusters or bus stops)  e. There were many instances where spaces were perceived as unsafe, as there was little  visibility from the street  f. Overall, the open spaces were underutilized and served more as a grassed landscaped  area. The reduction in this form of space would, arguably, be of little loss to the  community. Observations affirmed the findings of the research surround apartment  tower challenges.  46   

V.

There was an abundant amount of parking located on site ­ almost all sites provided  underground parking, and all sites had access to surface parking pads. The surface parking pads  were underutilized, and were not full.  

Commercial Amenities:
I. A total of 4 apartment tower sites included an ancillary convenience commercial use located  within the ground floor of the tower, housed within the shell of a former residential unit.  II. The Elm Ridge cluster provided an array of commercial uses within a ground floor podium of 145  Marlee Avenue. The commercial space was purpose built, and resembles a single story strip  commercial plaza ­ refer to section 5.2.1  III. In all instances, selected tower clusters were located near a major commercial mall, commercial  strip plazas, or a combination of both. They offered a range of area specific amenities, such as  ethnic food restaurants or grocery stores.   IV. All apartment clusters had a national chain grocery store (e.g. No Frills, Sobeys, Metro, Food  Mart, Target, and Food Basics) located within a 250 meter walking distance to the site .  Although a number of community and commercial amenities were available within a very reasonable  walking distance from the clusters, the pedestrian experience travelling to these spaces were less than  favourable as access was a considerable issue. These clusters are in autodominant areas where little  investments have been made to enhance pedestrian safety, experience, and connectivity.   Introducing new community and commercial amenities onsite provides the opportunity for nondrivers  to access their daily needs in a safe, proximate, and accessible area. Moreover, given the above average  densities, community and commercial activities will have a user base on site that can more than sustain  their operations.

5.1.2 Land Value Assessment
To enhance the accuracy of the development proforma, data pertaining to all observed tower's revenue  generation and operation expenses were estimated (as per the methodology outlined in Section 2.3, in  the Site Specific Valuations: subsection). A total of 35 tower structures were reviewed to evaluate their  respective residual land values, and whether that value was substantial enough to fund tower specific  improvements.  The results are summarized in Figure 14 to Figure 17 found between pages 52 to 53, and supported by  the key findings below. For an expansive view of all the collected and analysed statistics, refer to  Appendix C: Net Operating Income & Land Residual Cost Analysis.  

Findings:
I. Average lot sizes of all 35 towers were approximately 1.489 hectares in size (3.679 acres), of  which the built structures on site covered a mere 10.08% of the lands. An average 1.339  hectares (3.308 acres) of underutilized land per lot was available for infill.   a. Note: the above total includes existing parking pads and internal laneways. If tower  owners do not wish to reconfigure their lots to maximize surplus lands, using E.R.A.  Architects' (2008) estimate of 30% total lot coverage would be a more conservative  estimation. The applied ratio is dependent on the level of revitalization desired.  II. Based on Colliers International Cap Rate Report (2013), multiresidential unit buildings in City of  Toronto have a capitalization rate of 3.75% (low) to 4.75% (high). Lower capitalization rates  equate to higher sale values for the asset being sold. Altogether, the stronger and safer the  market is, the lower capitalization rates. Comparatively to the Greater Toronto Area, which  Colliers International apartment market trends report (2014) provided a cap rate of 5.05%, a  30 bps to 130 bps (bps = base points) differential.   a. Between 2004 and 2013, the cap rates for apartment structures within the GTA have  dropped from 7.25% to 5.05%, whereas in city of Toronto, they have remained relatively  stable. This indicated that the value of multiresidential highrise apartments are  48   

increasing in value within the GTA (Toronto specific values were not available for  review).  III. Net operating income calculations of all 35 observed towers have shown that:  a. Average yearly gross revenues are estimated at $3.34 M, or $144.54 a square metre;  i. Note if commercial uses were present, their contributions to the tower's overall  revenue stream were not calculated, and were assumed to be at the same rate  as residential units. 145 Marlee Avenue was removed from the averages as is  was identified as an outlier, given it had a sizable purpose built ground floor  commercial podium.  b. Utility costs are estimated to be on average $459,000 a year, or $16.07 a square metre;  c. Yearly maintenance costs were estimated at 40% of total yearly revenues, and  constituted the highest operating costs, averaging $1.34 M per building, or $57.82 per  square metre.  d. Average yearly tax rates are valued at 1.91%, which equated to an average expenditure  of $429,724, or $16.26 per square metre; and,  e.  The average Net Operational Income of a building was estimated at $1.11 M, or $54.33  per square foot.  IV. In comparing the capitalized value of the observed site to MPAC's property assessment, it was  discovered that:  a. When using a lower capitalization rate of 3.75%, save for the Elm Ridge cluster, every  tower cluster had a negative average land residual value. Furthermore, only 6 tower  sites had a residual value above $0.00.  A stronger market equates to lower land value,  as the structure is a more desirable investment.  b. When using a higher capitalization rate of 4.75%, five of the nine observed clusters had  a negative average land residual value. Furthermore, a total of 16 sites had a residual  land value greater than $0.00. A weaker market equates to higher land value, as the  structure is slightly less desirable as an investment. 

49   

Notwithstanding what capitalization rate is applied to assess the residual value of surplus tower  lands, there is a great deal of value that can be extracted from surplus underutilized lands.  When applying a low capitalization rate to apartment structures, the value of residual land  become negative, asserting that the value on site is in fact the apartment tower. Rezoning  would be required to extract a viable capital value to surplus lands by increasing permitted  densities and offering a wider range of uses. The inverse is true when applying a higher cap rate  to apartment structures, giving land greater value, opening the possibility to sell conveyed lots  asis for a profit, which can be later rezoned for infill activities. Whatever uplift value is applied  to assessing the residual land values, the uplift from amending the asofright zoning to a more  intensive and permissive zone are identical. 

Lessons Learned
From the findings, two key takeaways were identified from the study, and transferred to the  development proforma phase of this study.  First and foremost, the residual land values of tower sites are either nonexistent or marginal ­  depending on the cap rate applied in assessing their values ­ and will continue to decline as cap rates  continue to drop for multiresidential apartments in the GTA, while acknowledging the fact that lower  capitalization rates suggest higher market value for tower apartments. In either scenario, rezoning for  higher density will be required if a portion of the property is to be severed and be sold on the public or  private market.   Secondly, building maintenance costs is unquestionably the highest operational expenditure to an  apartment building owner. If a building owner were to properly upkeep their tower through appropriate  maintenance schedules, this will be capitalized in their building's overall value when MPAC assesses the  structure. Following maintenance schedules also ensure that building utility efficiencies will be held to a  higher standard, further reducing their total operational costs. If an owner opted to expend additional  revenues to further increase efficiencies in their building above the norm savings in utility costs would  be capitalized in the building's overall value, as the total NOI of the building would increase. There is an  50   

undeniable advantage for an owner to invest in the efficiency of their tower, and it is accepted that  there is an appetite from tower owners to invest in efficiency improvements aimed at reducing overall  utility costs if a proper return is present. This was asserted in the context of Toronto when Pine's (2014)  tower renewal team conducted interviews with tower owners, and by the Institute for Building  Efficiencies in their 2010 and 2013 surveys aimed towards residential building owners.    In instances where owners continually defer scheduled maintenance on their buildings, this shortfall in  management will be capitalized in the buildings overall value as MPAC reassesses the property, and  utility rates continue to rise due to reduced efficiencies. Differing maintenance on apartment structure  is to the detriment of the owner, as it ultimately affects their bottomline.   If rezoned, surplus lands have the potential to fund tower specific improvements aimed at reducing  utility costs, and funding ongoing or deferred building maintenance.

DEVELOPMENT PRECEDENT CASE STUDIES

Two development precedent case studies were selected based on their consistency with the goals and  objective of the Tower Renewal Initiative and their level of intensity in site alterations. These precedents  will be used to inform low and high buildout concepts and associated development proforma scenarios  assessing their feasibility. They include:  I. The Elm Ridge cluster, which was selected for its existing commercial podium that houses a  number of uses. As such, the low buildout scenario consists of an atgrade podium with  commercial and community services that are available to the immediate community.   II. The Parkview cluster, which was selected on the premise that it represents a fullbuild out  concept that was prescribed in the Tower Renewal Initiative. It achieves this by introducing new  market and rental housing, ground floor commercial uses, and the construction of a new  community centre. Accordingly, the high buildout scenario consists of a full community  revitalization, with significant levels of infill activities taking place.  Two apartment clusters identified in the study that could benefit and accommodate infill activities were  selected, and are explored in detail in section 6.0  Proposed Development Scenarios of the 

present report, which include the Kipling (Etobicoke) cluster and the Jane & Finch (North York) cluster.

Low Build-Out: Nubury Properties Ltd @ 145 Marlee Avenue
Figure 19: 145 Marlee Street ­ Nubury Properties Ltd.

Located at 145 Marlee Avenue in the former  municipality of York, this apartment structure has  the added advantage of a commercial podium at  grade that provides an array of commercial  amenities and services to nearby residents (see  Figure 19).   The tower has an approximate total of 324  residential apartment rental units, and sits atop a  1,447m2 commercial plaza with a total of seven  commercial retail units ­ uses include a  convenience store, hair salon, dental office, medical  clinic, drycleaners, and a Sobeys grocery store. A  secondary podium to the building houses 715 m2  community centre/child care centre that houses a  recreational space, fitness room, and indoor pool.

Notable Takeaways
Given the podium's architecture, it is assumed that  it was constructed after the tower. A missed  opportunity for this would have been to include  additional market or rental units on the second  floor of the podium. Adding commercial uses within  the property also provides the opportunity for an  additional revenue stream to owners. Lastly,  podiums take very little additional lands, leaving  space for future infill activities.  55

High Build-Out: Emerald City Condominiums @ Parkway Forest Drive
Figure 20: Parkway Forest Drive Community

On September 15, 2008, the Ontario Municipal  Board approved an Official Plan Amendment (no.  579) and Zoning Bylaw Amendment (8652008) to  permit the revitalization of lands in the Parkway  Forest Community, located south of Sheppard  Avenue East and east of Don Mills Road. This  included 110 Parkway Forest drive, a tower renewal  pilot site of the Tower Renewal Office.  The subject development blocks are designated as  "mixeduse area" under the current Toronto Official  Plan, and zoned "residential multiple (6)" under the  consolidated zoning bylaw. The current approved  zoning allows for a total of 3,753 residential units  (within structure ranging 7 to 36 storeys in height)  with commercial component (solely in Block A),  consisting of 2,200 new dwelling units, 1,221

existing rental apartment units, and the demolition and replacement of 332 rental units ­ a new  amendment to the zoning is seeking an additional 600 units to be distributed among the proposed new  development blocks. Commercial uses are permitted in block `A' of the development, along Don Mills  road, which permits retail stores, personal service shops, business and professional offices, professional  medical offices, restaurants, financial institutions, drycleaning and laundry collecting establishments.  In rendering the approval, the OMB appended within the implementing zoning bylaw five holding  symbols (`H') to the lands with provisions for their removal as well as a number of Section 37  contributions for the added density within the sites (see Figure 21 for detailed breakdown). Most  notable of these contributions included the construction of a new community centre/child care facility, 

56   

outdoor swimming pools, the replacement of demolished rental units with a portion to remain  affordable, and $1,000,000 provision to the city to support subsidies aimed at affordable rental rates.  (City of Toronto, 2008) 

Notable Takeaways from Development Proposal
This project clearly demonstrates the development potential of apartment neighbourhoods within the  innersuburbs of Toronto. If development potential exists on site, the private sector will see the  opportunity to invest, and the city can in turn draw significant contributions from development  activities. In this particular instance, the developer was able to secure between 2,200 ­ 2,800 new  market units and introduce up to 2,143 m2 of saleable/leasable commercial floor space. From the city's  perspective, they were able to secure the revitalization of 332 purpose built rental units, a new  community centre/child care centre, community pools, and subsidies using by tools provided in the  Planning Act (City of Toronto, 2014). Lastly, from the existing owner's perspective, they were able to  secure significant proceeds from the sale of their surplus lands (formerly used as parking pads), and  have a sizable contribution towards their overall mortgage payments,  towards reinvesting in their  tower to improve utility efficiencies, or addressing items on their deferred maintenance list.  Through a partnership between the City, apartment owners, and private developers, this development  achieved the Tower Renewal Initiative's objective and goals of increasing efficiencies, providing  community uses, provision of commercial activities, increased employment opportunities, and increased  investment in the neighbourhood.  Although not all innersuburban apartment neighbourhoods have the locational advantage of Parkway  Forest Community ­ adjacent to two major arterial, the Sheppard subway line, and Fairview Mall ­ a key  lesson is that development is feasible on these sites, and that securing city and community interests  with the tools made available through the Planning Act is paramount. This also makes a compelling case  to introducing higherorder transit spines across these neighbourhoods (as were proposed by Miller's  Transit Plan (2008) to bolster the neighbourhood's desirability, spurring privatesector investments.      57

PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS

Low and high buildout scenarios were developed using two different types of structure construction,  namely concrete slab apartment/condominiums and timber frame midrise buildings  for their varying  construction costs per square metre ­ values were draw from the Altus Group (2014) Construction Cost  Guide.  LOW BUILDOUT  1. New tower podium with:  a. Residential (market/rental)  b. Commercial Retail Units  c. Commercial Grocery Store  d. Community Centre  HIGH BUILD OUT  New market and or rental housing (mid rise development)  New commercial retail units  Mixeduse (midrise development)  Community Centre amenities 

1. 2. 3. 4.

Development Scenario Assessment Guidelines/Rules:
The ability to increase surplus land values within apartment tower sites is highly contingent on the  potential sale of market residential units that generate the most revenues. Residential rental units and  commercial leasable space do add value, but are difficult to predict. Accordingly, the feasibility of the  proposed infill projects will be predominantly focused on market housing sales. As there were no  comparable land sales within the study area for residential condominiums, a range of values were  assessed to determine the sensitivity of the land values versus the per square foot sale of market  residential space, ranging between $300 per square feet (netzero value) to $600 per square feet  (downtown prime rates).  Based on the saleable range of market housing, a development proposal is acceptable if the final  residual land value of the severed parcel is equal or greater to one million dollars (this is a sizeable  amount that can fund a number of tower specific improvements ­ see Figure 8). Scenarios with lower  values will be deemed unfeasible, as proceeds are not sufficient to funding tower improvements.  Lastly, timber frame construction cannot exceed 6 storeys in height ­ in the high buildout scenario with  timber frame construction presented in section 6.2, heights were reduced to 6 storeys in height ­ this  assumes that timber frame will be approved in the next Ontario Building Code amendment.  59

LOW BUILD-OUT DEVELOPMENT MODEL ­ 2667-2677 KIPLING AVENUE, ETOBICOKE

Using the Kipling Cluster case study, a low buildout concept was developed to estimate the total uplift  in land values, and the degree to which a moderate levels of infill could be introduced on site. As a  design rule for this model, it was determined that the infill that is to take place must be connected to an  existing tower structure ­ namely 26672677 Kipling Avenue in this scenario. Refer to Appendix B3:   Kipling for additional details on the cluster's existing form and revenue generating capabilities.  

6.1.1 Development Process:
The following development process was developed to recognize the tower owner and purchaser's  interests while ensuring that the three objectives of the Tower Renewal initiative for a single cluster are  implemented (community, commercial, environmental efficiency):   1. Sever land holdings that are aimed at accommodating proposed infill activities ­ in this scenario, a  0.3971 hectare lot as shown in Figure 23. Provide the following conditions of approval to the  application ­ permitted under Section 53(12) of the Planning Act:  1.1. Severed site must be rezoned to either RAC, CR, or RM  CAVEAT: If the site has asofright permissions to accommodate proposed infill, ensure that  conditions be placed on the application for consent and (if applicable) application for minor  variance to the ineffect zoning bylaw to secure community benefits.   2. Rezone to Residential Apartment Commercial (RAC), and:  2.1. Seek relief from:  2.1.1.Section 15.20.20.100(1) to permit a greater GFA for commercial uses  2.1.2.Section 15.20.20.100(4) to permit a greater GFA for a community centre  2.1.3.If relief to the RAC zone are not possible, rezone entire site to Commercial Residential (CR)  or Residential Multiple (RM), with necessary exceptions, to permit desired uses  2.2. Secure community benefits through Section 37 of the Planning Act: 

60   

2.2.1.Cashinlieu contribution to the enhancement and/or construction of a new purposebuilt  community space. An inkind contribution is preferable if uplift values are significant  enough to fund the construction and outfitting of a new space.  2.2.2.Secure between 10%20% of all new residential units introduced on site as purpose built  rental units, which can be retained by the developer or conveyed to another property  management company or notforprofit at the cost of construction.   3. Sell severed lands to a private developer   4. Use proceeds to fund tower specific enhancements. To ensure funds accrued through the sale of the  lands are spent in portion on tower revitalization, two options should be explored ­ their legality  would need to be assessed:   4.1. A holding symbol be placed on the severed lot (`H'), under section 36(1) of the Planning Act  requiring that tower works must be initiated prior to the construction of any new structures on  site ­ the purchaser can in turn put a condition of sale that protects their interests from the  selling party if they were to default on their commitment.  4.2. The Committee of Adjustment place a condition of approval on the proposed severance,  requiring that a minimum capital contribution be allocated towards the revitalization of the  tower ­ this value should not exceed the total net sale value of the property.  CAVEAT: If the Tower Renewal Corporation exists at this time, they should be the primary point  of contact in negotiating the final revitalization sum, and be the recipient of the allocated funds  aimed at revitalizing the tower.  The above process will need to be supported by a negotiation process between all parties involved to  ensure benefits to the community are maximized. Given that the profit margin for the developer is  strongly dependant on the number of new units proposed on site, a balancing act must be achieved  between what is profitable to the investor, beneficial to the community and tower owner, and what  constitutes `good planning'. In addition to a negotiation process, a formal secondary plan for the area  should also be developed by planning staff to manage the rate and type of growth occurring in the  community and identify gaps in service provisions that need fulfilling.  61   

6.1.2 Proposed Concept Plan:
This model has been adapted from the low buildout case study of 145 Marlee Avenue, summarized in  section 5.2.1, found at page 55 of the present report, as an archetype to follow.   A 0.3971 ha parcel of land, which will house new residential and commercial uses, will be severed from  both 26672677 Kipling Avenue, and consolidated into a single parcel.   The low build out proposal for this site introduces new market and rental residential units, at grade  commercial units, and a new community centre. As shown in Figure 23 and Figure 24, the new  residential and commercial uses will be integrated into a newly proposed 4 storey podium, to be  constructed at the base of 2667 Kipling Avenue, a 23 storey slab apartment tower; whereas, the  community centre (proposed to be built at a later time once the necessary funds are accrued through  Section 37 contributions), will be built within a second podium addition to 2667 Kipling Avenue.  The intensity of this proposed infill project is considered minimal, as the increase in density and height,  and total lot coverage within the severed parcel will be minimal, and consistent when comparing to the  surrounding area. Moreover, this proposal leaves room for future infill activities if demand rises.

6.1.3 Land Value and Development Costs
Between the two construction standards observed, concrete slab and timber frame, the following  observations were made:  I. Referring to Figure 26 and Figure 27, concrete slab construction for the proposed residential  component is profitable if market sales per square foot is $575 to $600. Any value below $500  per square feet, the proposed severed parcel is valued below $0. Given that the Kipling cluster is  in an area of marginal investment, a saleable rate of $575$600 may be too high a rate to charge  new potential residents, making the development unfeasible.  II. Referring to Figure 28 and Figure 29, timber frame construction for the proposed residential  component is profitable if market sales per square foot is$450 to $600. Any value below $350  per square feet, the proposed severed parcel is valued below $0. A saleable rate of $450 is more  acceptable for the area in which the parcel is located, making timber construction far more  viable for this development scenario.  The figure below summarizes the potential residual land values and uplift values that can be extracted  from the both the Concrete and Timber frame construction options. A ratio has also been provided as to  how much the Section 37 contribution would fund the new proposed community centre for this project.

6.1.4 Meeting the Apartment Tower Initiatives Checklist
If concrete slab construction for the residential units is pursued, developers need to reduce their  acceptable profit margin of 15% of total profits, or the city should convey special provisions that would  reduce its fees associated with the development to increase land values.  Alternatively, if timber frame construction is pursued, the developer could retain their full 15% of profit,  and require no conveyances from the city. Additional conveyances could be given to accelerate the  introduction of a community centre. 

Additions to the Community
I. II. New market residential units within the community;  New rental units have been introduced on site, totaling 323m2 which equates to approximately  5 new residential units of 70 m2;  III. Leasable commercial space has been made available, equating to approximately 7 new  commercial retail units of 50 m2;  IV. V. Introduction of a new grocery store for the immediate and surrounding community;  Through uplifted land values, cashinlieu contributions can be pooled for the construction of a  new community centre within a new podium of the structure ­ if community space is  immediately required, a more cost effective solution can be implemented in the interim;  VI. At a saleable rate of $450 per square foot with a timber frame construction, the land sale  proceeds are approximated at $1,129,921 for 0.3971 ha ­ the rate per hectare is estimated at  $2,845,432 and additional land sales can be further reinvested into tower revitalization.

HIGH BUILD-OUT DEVELOPMENT MODEL ­ 10 SAN ROMANOWAY, NORTH YORK

Using the Jane and Finch cluster case study, a high buildout concept was developed that introduced a  number of new uses on the tower site 10 San Romanoway, which currently houses a 33 storey  apartment structure and ancillary community centre. Refer to Appendix B6:  additional details on the cluster.  Jane & Finch for 

6.2.1 Development Process:
The following development process was developed using the same principles as the lowbuild out  scenario outlined in Section 6.1:   1. Sever land holdings that are aimed at accommodating proposed infill activities ­ in this scenario, a  1.388 hectare lot as shown in Figure 30. Provide the following conditions of approval to the  application ­ permitted under Section 53(12) of the Planning Act:  CAVEAT: If the site has asofright permissions to accommodate proposed infill, ensure that  conditions be placed on the application for consent and (if applicable) application for minor  variance to the ineffect zoning bylaw to secure community benefits.   2. Rezone severed site to Commercial Residential (CR) and/or Residential Multiple (RM), and secure  community benefits through Section 37 of the Planning Act:  2.1. Construction of community space in the groundfloor podium of a newly constructed  residential building, with approximately 600 m2 of community amenity space;  2.2. Cashinlieu contribution for the enhancement of the public realm, prioritizing the residential  cluster where the development is taking place, or in the immediate community.   2.3. Secure between 10%20% of all new residential units introduced on site as purpose built rental  units which can be retained by the developer or conveyed to another property management  company at the cost of construction.   3. Sell severed lands to a private developer  

68   

4. Use proceeds to fund tower specific enhancements. To ensure funds accrued through the sale of the  lands are spent in portion on tower revitalization, two options should be explored ­ their legality  would need to be reviewed:   4.1. A holding symbol be placed on the severed lot (`H'), under section 36(1) of the Planning Act  requiring that tower works must be initiated prior to the construction of any new structures on  site ­ the buying party can in turn put a condition of sale that protects their interests from the  selling party if they were to default on their commitment.  4.2. The Committee of Adjustment place a condition of approval on the proposed severance,  requiring that a minimum capital contribution be allocated towards the revitalization of the  tower ­ this value should not exceed the total net sale value of the property.  CAVEAT: If the Tower Renewal Corporation exists at this time, they should be the primary point  of contact in negotiating the final revitalization sum, and should be the recipient of the  allocated funds aimed at revitalizing the tower.  The above process will need to be supported by a negotiation process between all parties involved to  ensure benefits to the community are maximized. The profit margin for the developer in this scenario is  far greater than the low buildout scenario, however it remains strongly dependant on the number of  new units proposed on site and the per square foot market rate at which they are sold.  When developing larger parcels of this size, the creation of a secondary plan for the area is strongly  recommended to ensure that the contributions are properly and effectively expended within the  community. Community based consultation derived from the secondary planning process will inform  what investments they find are most desired in their neighbourhood.

6.2.2 Proposed Concept Plan
This model has been adapted from the high buildout case study of Emerald City, summarized in section  5.2.2, found at page 56 of the present report.  A 1.388 parcel of land, which will house new residential and commercial uses, will be severed from 10  Romanoway Drive. The high buildout proposal for this site introduces new market and rental residential  units, at grade commercial units, and a new community amenity space. As shown in Figure 31 and Figure  32, the new residential and commercial uses will be integrated into a three 79 structure, and 3  townhouse blocks, divided among 6 development block (AF). Commercial uses will be housed within  the ground floors of the structures located in Blocks D, E, and F. The community amenity space is  located within the ground floor of Block D.  As a midrise built form, which is recommended in the Toronto Official Plan (2010), the intensity of this  proposed infill project is at its highest. This proposal will be the first of its kind in the neighbourhood,  and should activate the street frontage to make it more conducive to walking. This provides a building  archetype that can be replicated along Jane Street and Finch Avenue, both having a significant inventory  of underutilized land at the streets edge that is viable for infill activities and street activation.

6.2.3 Land Value and Development Costs
Between the two constructionstandards observed the following observations were made:  I. Referring to Figure 34 and Figure 35, concrete slab construction for the proposed residential  component is profitable if market rates per square foot is $450 to $600. Any sale value below  $450 per square foot produces a parcel valued below $0. Given that the Jane and Finch is in an  area of marginal investment, a saleable rate of $600 is too high. A $450 rate may be feasible  within the area, especially if transitional housing for seniors is needed or marketable in the area.  A detailed market analysis of the area is needed to assert the former.  II. Referring to Figure 36 and Figure 37, timber frame construction for the proposed residential  component is profitable if market rates per square foot are is $300 to $600. Any value below  $300 per square feet, the proposed severed parcel is valued below $0. A saleable rate of $325 is  more than acceptable for the area in which the parcel is located, making timber construction far  more viable in this development scenario.  The figure below summarizes the potential residual land values and uplift values that can be extracted  from the both the concrete and timber frame construction options. In all four options, Section 37  contributions are large enough to fund the proposed community centre.

6.2.4 Meeting the Apartment Tower Initiatives Checklist
Both concrete slab and timber framing construction can be pursued with high profitability for both the  developer and the existing tower owners. Notwithstanding the former, the timber frame construction  standard would be more conducive to the existing market rates in this neighbourhood. Section 37  contributions for timber frame construction are higher than concrete slab construction as the profit  margin for the developer is greater and this saving would be passed through to new residents. As  marketability in the subject area increases, and as acceptable square foot sale values increase, the  viability for concrete slab construction would also increase. 

Additions to the Community
I. New market residential units within the community at affordable rates, opening the opportunity  to provide startup housing (young families) or transitional housing for seniors looking to  downsize;  II. New rental units have been introduced on site, totaling 4,148 m2 which equates to  approximately 60 new residential units of 70 m2;  III. Leasable commercial space has been made available, equating to approximately 22 new  commercial retail units of 100+ m2;  IV. V. Through uplifted land values, a  600 m2 community amenity space can be constructed;  Additional cashinlieu contributions can be either pooled for other major investments within  the community, or for onsite investments for additional community amenities, which may  include, but are not limited to, community gardens, a market square, programming open spaces,  introduction of recreational spaces, or transit improvements;  VI. At a saleable rate of $325 per square foot with a timber frame construction, the land sale  proceeds are approximated at $4,872,449 for 1.388 ha.

6.3

DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO LIMITATIONS

The reader should be made aware that the development scenarios presented in the preceding sections  are not without their limitations. Given that there are gaps in information ­ specified below ­ the  accuracy of the findings are not without some margin of error. Moreover, assumptions are made about  the approvability of the proposal, the current appetite from both the City of Toronto Staff and Ward  Councillors and the residential communities as a whole for this type of development. Accordingly, in  reviewing these development scenario proformas, please acknowledge the following:   I. Site specific land valuations are speculative, and are based entirely on development potential.  As there was a lack of resources in comparable land sales and development precedents within  innersuburban neighbourhoods available for review, the results of the proformas cannot be  assertively guaranteed without direct market assessments.   II. Continuing under the same limitations as discussed above, without actual data speaking to past  land sales and development precedents, a residential saleable floor area that takes into account  actual market rates could not be applied with full certainty; thus the application of a range of  values. Market values should therefore be assessed on a cluster by cluster basis.  III. The same conclusion needs be given to commercial market rates as well, where location specific  information should be accrued as opposed to the aggregated date collected from Colliers  International's (2013) Retail Report for the GTA.   IV. Specific to the timber frame build out scenario, the an amendment has yet to be approved to  the Ontario Building Code to allow for the construction of timber frame housing above three  storeys in height, to a maximum of six storeys. The scenarios that use this construction model  should be used as references as to the potential cost savings of timber structure once (if)  approved in the future.  V. Based on initial conversations with Chris Phibbs (2014), councillors of wards that are rich with  apartment tower sites are still reluctant to accommodate increased density. Therefore the 

76   

approvability of these projects will be highly contingent on achieving buyin from the  community to pressure their councillors to support these projects.  The advantages and disadvantages of concrete built structure versus timber frame structures are not up  for debate in the scope of this study. Nevertheless, the following distinctions should be made and  understood.  Concrete buildings have a longer lifespan ­ as seen by the resilient tower stock ­ and are far `easier' to  maintain compared to timber frame construction (Ditmars, 2013). However this resiliency comes at a  cost of higher construction costs, which must be offset by higher per square foot sale values and smaller  unit sizes. In areas of marginal investment in the innersuburbs, the demand and marketability of new  condominiums and their associated costs may not be supported by current market trends, making them  unfeasible.  Alternatively, timber frame construction is far more economical than concrete, albeit having a shorter  life cycle. This alternative is more conducive for areas of marginal investment that do not have the  demand nor market to support concrete build values. This is not to say that they are any less liveable  than concrete buildings, just that they are valued at a lesser rate, which is natural.  Overall, the decision whether to select concrete or timber frame construction is dependent on the  acceptable market residential rates per square foot that can be charged to future consumers.

CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS

The private development market is in constant search of developable lands to add to their portfolio and  future development pipeline, often forcing them to find innovative yet complicated solutions to  assembling lands within Toronto.  This inflates land values that are ultimately passed through to the  future purchasers and creates affordability issues.  That being said, tower neighbourhoods in Toronto have at their disposal a significant supply of surplus  lands in a city that has a significant shortage of land resources. This land surplus can and should be  leveraged for future infill activities that provides additional affordable housing and achieves the goals of  the tower renewal initiatives.  Notwithstanding the availability of this prime resource, the asofright development potential of the  lands is limited by current planning regulations that remove any monetary values that could be drawn  from the sale of lands to the benefit of the existing tower owner.  As a result this reduces its  development potential from the private industry's perspective.  To infuse values into surplus lands, planning regulations must be amended to allow for a wider array of  uses and high development densities. In using one of the two development models created in this  report, land sale values can be infused into surplus tower lands to: finance tower revitalization; allow  private developers to generate profits through market sales; and allow the municipality to draw inkind  or cashinlieu contributions from upzoning activities that can be used to finance community amenities.  The following are contributions that should be drawn from infill activities:   I. Tower improvements ­ financed through the sale of lands, and residual investment needs  backed by the future Tower Renewal Corporation's capital pool and financing plan  II. New Residential Market Units ­ built by private developers, and sold on the private market  (primary profit generator) 

78   

III.

New Residential Rental Units ­ 1015% of total new residential unit GFA can be sold at cost  to another residential property management company as a condition of approval.  Affordability should be built into the units where feasible. 

IV.

Commercial amenities ­ Developed concurrently with residential uses along the ground floor  podium 

V.

Community amenities ­ Developed concurrently with residential uses, or developed once  sufficient section 37 cashinlieu contributions are collected through other development  activities 

In addition to utilizing the development models created in the present report, the following  recommendations should also be considered by the City of Toronto in the implementation and full roll out of the tower renewal initiative. 

Growth Management Recommendations:
I. Staff should develop a city wide plan to identify areas of primary interest for apartment tower  infill activities.  This should guide the long term implementation of the initiative across the city,  targeting and prioritizing clusters requiring immediate attention and investment   a. Within this plan, detailed information pertaining to residential and commercial market  conditions should be evaluated on a ward based format at a minimum, or by Toronto's  140 neighbourhood boundary classifications  II. The city should develop a secondary plan for the neighbourhood prior to undertaking any high  buildout scenario for a cluster to ensure:  a. a community consultation process be undertaken, allowing the opportunity to identify  neighbourhood needs and wants, as well as garner increased buyin and support by  clearly outlining how the community will benefit from development  b. orderly and phased development within a cluster, and provide more formulaic  guidelines as to the desired density for the proposed development 

79   

c. community amenities desired by the residents of the neighbourhood are itemized and  prioritized, and secured in the final buildout of an identified tower cluster  d. that commercial amenity types conducive to resident needs are identified and  suggested within the overall development  e. pricing of desired community amenities to be funded through section 37 contributions is  estimated and planned beforehand, ensuring cashinlieu contributions are earmarked  and potential inkind contributions are valuated before negotiations commence  f. creation of neighbourhood specific programs that assist existing and new residents in  taking advantage of newly constructed commercial retail units to start and manage their  own business, and/or provide new employment opportunities  III. The City should consult with the Toronto Community Housing Corporation prior to and during  the development of future plans for tower renewal to assess:  a. if they require new affordable rental units, which can be provided at the cost of  construction during infill activities and secured through Section 37 contributions.  b. if specific tower renewal projects should be prioritized in the city wide phasing as they  may align with TCHC projects, providing opportunities for cost savings or jointventure  partnerships 

Arm's Length Tower Renewal Agency Mandate Recommendations:
I. The City of Toronto should move forward with its plan to introduce the Tower Renewal  Corporation, whereby in addition to their responsibilities defined in the City of Toronto  Implementation Plan (2011), they should :  a. be the first point of contact to tower owners seeking to undertake infill activities within  a podium space, or undergo the process of severing and selling a parcel of land  b. assist in developing secondary plans for apartment neighbourhoods  c. be a commenting agency in the review of future development applications within  apartment tower neighbourhoods, and assist Planning staff in maintaining orderly and  phased infill activities   80   

d. be the institution responsible for negotiating and securing a portion of sale proceeds  that will be directed towards tower specific improvements  e. assist in reviewing tower efficiencies with building owners, and recommending options  to increase overall sustainability  II. The Tower Renewal Corporation should be, in some capacity, associated or partnered with the  Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC), as both should align their goals and objectives  as the tower renewal initiative moves forward 

Infill Construction and Revitalization Recommendations:
I. The final determination of which construction standard to pursue for an infill project should  be based on what market rates are most appropriate for the area in question. If concrete  construction is deemed to be financially feasible for an infill project, where a sizeable and  acceptable return can be extracted from the sale of land, that option should be given  priority over timber frame construction.  II. Timber frame construction should be exclusively used in areas where acceptable market  rates are not sufficient to accommodate concrete construction at the time of the proposal,  as developer profit margins are too low.  The tower owners and dwellers of Toronto hold a lucrative trump card that can assist them in  strengthening their neighbourhoods by spurring new investment. It is time that the city provide the  tower owners and their residents the playing field to play the hand that they were dealt, and reap the  rewards.
