SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF FERROCENYL STANNANES AND POLYFERROCENYL STANNANES Jonathan Ward Masters of Science, Molecular Science, Ryerson University 2013 Abstract A novel polymer polybis(dimethyl stannyl)ferrocene was synthesized through both metal catalyzed intermolecular dehydrogenative condensation and ring-opening polymerization. This polymer was the first evidence of a dibridged polyferrocenyl stannane, and was found to be of low to moderate molecular weight by gel permation chromatography and 1H NMR spectroscopy. This polymer displayed extensive electronic communication observed previously synthesized monobridged ferrocenyl stannane polymers. The first tristanna-bridged [3.3]ferrocenophane was discovered through an amine coupling of a tin amine, and 1,1'bis(dimethyl stannyl) ferrocene. The [3.3]ferrocenophane displayed a strong interaction between connected ferrocenes despite the large distance, (8.49 Å) between Fe centers. Finally, a new and improved synthesis of 1,1,2,2tetramethyldistanna-[2]ferrocenophane was found. This metal catalyzed intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling employs Pd2(dba)3 as a catalyst and yields 90% product. All products were characterized where possible 1H, 13C, and 119Sn NMR and UV-Visible spectrocopy, as well as through cyclic voltammetry and DFT modeling.

1.0 Introduction
Polymers are everywhere and are connected to every facet of our modern world. From commodity plastics and rubbers to speciality elastomers and films for use in corrective optics, electronics and engineered materials, polymers are highly visible in everyday life. Within the modern study of polymers, the inorganic and organometallic polymer subset continues to be the basis of important research due to their unusual structural, optical, thermal, and electronic properties. The field of inorganic polymers is so prevalent in materials chemistry today that more than one thousand* review articles and at least one book1 have been published on this topic. These polymers have been prepared through a variety of polymerization methods, some of which will be described in the following sections.

1.1 Polystannanes
Tin, as far as we know, is the only metal that has the ability to form covalently bonded oligo- and polymeric structures. The unique structural features and unusual electronic properties of polystannanes distinguish them from other Group 14 polymers. There have been at least 2 review articles in the past 12 years on the topic of polystannanes,2,3 however due to their relative lack of stability, there has been considerably less recent research into these systems compared to other more stable inorganic polymeric systems. Polystannanes were likely first discovered in the mid-19th century and have been synthesized via a variety of routes throughout the last 150 years.3 The modern era of polystannanes began in the 1980s with the discovery by Zou et al.4 of the Wurtz coupling of

dichlorostannanes. Polystannanes have also been successfully prepared by the groups of Price,5 Okano,6,7 Tilley,8-11 Sita,12 Caseri,13-16 and Foucher.17 The methods used by these groups will be discussed in detail in Section 1.1.1.

1.1.1 Synthesis
There are three major routes to the preparation of polystannanes (Figure 1.1); Wurtz coupling, electrochemical coupling, and dehydrogenative coupling. In most of these methods, there is often an impurity of 5- and 6-membered cyclic oligomers formed. These impurities are readily identified through
119

Sn NMR spectroscopy as the polymer will, in most cases, have a

lower field signal than the corresponding cyclic oligomers.

Figure 1.1: Three reaction routes for the synthesis of polystannanes from dichlorostannanes a) Wurtz coupling, b) electrochemical coupling c) reduction of dichlorostannane to form tin dihydrides followed by dehydrogenative coupling. The preparation of suitable tin-containing monomers for polymerization by either Wurtz or electrochemical coupling (tin dichlorides) or dehydrogenative coupling (tin dihydrides) is well established (Figure 1.1). There are several known syntheses for the preparation of tin chlorides


[Bu2Sn]n shows a 119Sn NMR peak at -190 ppm whereas the cyclic (Bu2Sn)5 species shows a 119Sn NMR signal at 202 ppm.

including the controlled thermal redistribution of R4Sn (R = alkyl, aryl) and SnCl4. These reactions are carried out in the absence of solvent and at relatively low temperatures (<120°C) to form monochlorides (R3SnCl), or at higher temperatures (>120°C) where the formation of dichlorides (R2SnCl2) becomes more prevalent. These tin dichlorides can then be used for polymerization by Wurtz or electrochemical coupling or further reacted with reducing agents, such as LiAlH4, to form mono- or di- tin hydrides, (R3SnH or R2SnH2), the latter of which can be used as a monomer for dehydrogenative polymerization. Tin dialkyl and diaryl dibromides have also been prepared using Br2 as a brominating agent with R4Sn. Tin dibromides can then be reduced to form tin dihydrides suitable for polymerization.18 Wurtz coupling is a reductive process by which a radical is formed from a halogenated species, which goes on to react with a second halogenated species through a method of radical chain growth. Originally carried out in the presence of molten sodium, Zou et al.4 modified the Wurtz coupling of dichlorostannanes to employ considerably less harsh conditions. The reaction that Zou performed using toluene as the solvent is carried out first via dispersion of Na metal at reflux with the help of 15-crown-5. The reaction is then brought down to a temperature of 60°C and the tin dichloride monomer slowly added in additional toluene over several hours. The method was further improved by Price et al.5 who showed that shorter reaction times are a key factor in increasing the size and lowering the dispersity of the polymers formed as well as reducing the percent impurity of cyclic oligomers. An optimal reaction period of 4 h was found to yield the highest molecular weight polystannanes* with the lowest amount of cyclic oligomers formed (Table 1.1). Wurtz type coupling has also been used to produce co-polymers containing both silicon and tin within the backbone.19,20

Ratio of high molecular weight polymer to cyclic oligomers at 1000 Da Wurtz coupling of polystannanes was also carried out by Caseri et al.13 in a solution of

liquid ammonia at -78° C. Wurtz coupling was achieved by a one (all monomer added in one aliquot) or two (monomer separated into two aliquots and added in steps) step methods. Using these processes, Caseri was able to prepare both polymers and copolymers of butyl and phenyl tin systems, with molecular weights  1×104 Da and PDIs of between 2.2 and 3.8.* A more recently discovered route to the preparation of polystannanes was via electrolysis. This was accomplished by Okano et al.6 in 1998 who electrochemically reduced R2SnCl2 (R = n-Bu, n-Oct) to form the associated polymers. This was achieved in a one compartment cell fitted with a syringe port, a Pt anode and an Ag cathode with tetra-nbutylammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte in 1,2-dimethoxyethane. Molecular weights of the polydi(n-butyl)stannanes, ([(n-Bu)2Sn]n), were found to be between 6×1031.2×104 Da with PDIs ranging from 1.3-2.6 respectively, depending on the current efficiency. These reactions were also performed with RSnCl3 (R = Me, n-Bu, n-Oct, Ph) that showed the formation of ladder polystannanes.7 These polymers were of the chemical formula [RSnClx]n where x is between 0 and 2. Polystannanes formed this way were not fully characterized,

however they display a UV-visible spectra tailing well into the visible range (850 nm) with no identifiable peak, indicative of an amorphous network. Dehydrogenative coupling is the more common method for the synthesis of polystannanes. This involves building Sn-Sn -bonds by the elimination of hydrogen gas. First demonstrated by Tilley et al.,8 dehydrogenative coupling was successfully achieved using neat (n-Bu)2SnH2 or Ph2SnH2 dihydrides with a zirconocene based catalyst, [Zr(5-C5H5)(5C5Me5)(Si(SiMe3)3)Me], in the absence of light. After 5 h, the resulting polymer was precipitated in dry methanol yielding a linear polystannane.

Figure 1.2: Tilley's catalysts evaluated for the dehydrogentative coupling of (n-Bu)2SnH2. 1(a,b,d), 2(a,b,c), 3(a,b,c) under various test conditions. Tilley9 used a defined protocol of adding the neat tin monomer to catalyst (2 mol %) under nitrogen and screened a series of zirconocene based catalysts (Figure 1.2) over different reaction times. These catalysts include various derivatives used in a prior study,9 as well as a cationic catalyst, and a catalyst loading with a small amount of solvent. The best polymerization result from this screening was with ansa-2-zirconocene (Figure 1.2, 1d) with Mw = 6.7×104 Da after 11 h. This catalyst showed a high degree of depolymerisation after 24 h. Tilley was also able to polymerize a series of diaryl tin dihydrides to produce polymers of varying structures and molecular weights (Table 1.2).10

The zirconocene system (a d0 metal) was further studied mechanistically using a hafnium metallocene analogue due to the inability of the zirconocene system to trap intermediate species.11 This system showed an -H elimination, forming a free stannylene. This was immediately followed by insertion of the stannylene between the SnH bond.

Figure 1.3: Dehydrogenative coupling reactions by a) Tilley9 and b) Caseri14,15 to synthesize [R2Sn]n. Sita12 and Caseri14,15 were also able to synthesis polystannanes through a dehydrogenative coupling reaction involving secondary tin hydrides and rhodium catalysts, CORhI(PPh3)3H and ClRh1(PPh3)3 (Figure 1.3). Sita, using the same reaction protocol as Tilley was able to make highly branched systems that contained cyclic oligomers within the reaction mixture. Caresi was able to demonstrate good molecular weight control by adding the dialkyl tin monomer drop wise to the Wilkinson's catalyst in DCM, driving the reaction to completion without the production of cyclic oligomers and forming high molecular weight linear [(nBu)2Sn]n. The polymer was then isolated from solution by cooling the DCM reaction solution. Caseri,16 using the same conditions, prepared a series of dialkylstannyl hydrides (Et, n-Pr, n-Bu, n-Pe, n-Hex, n-Oct, n-Dod) that readily formed poly(dialkyl)stannanes using Wilkinson's catalyst. These polymers had Mw  104 Da and PDIs ranging from 1.5-2.7. There has been some evidence in the literature indicating that dehydrogenative coupling occurs with other catalytic systems including platinum complexes,21,22 Group 4 metallocenes, Group 6 carbonyl complexes,23,24 and lanthanide species.25 The majority of these systems produced only dimers or small oligomers. The notable exception to this is the platinum complex 6

[(2-P,N)-Ph2PC2H4NMe2]PtMe2 from Schubert et al.21,22 Using

119

Sn NMR spectroscopy they

were able to demonstrate that they could synthesize [(n-Bu)2Sn]n with no cyclic oligomers. However, no further research of this system was completed beyond the initial NMR studies. Foucher et al.17 demonstrated the catalyst free thermally driven dehydrogenative coupling of (n-Bu)2SnH2 to form [(n-Bu)2Sn]n. These solvent and catalyst free reactions were carried out under reduced pressure for a period of 6 h. Modest molecular weights (1.8×104 Da) and broad polydispersities (PDI = 6.9) were observed through GPC. There was a significant fraction (20%) of low molecular weight cyclic oligomers also formed.

1.1.2 Properties
Polystannanes are covalently bonded main group metal polymers with interesting properties. Optically, poly(dialkyl)stannanes range from yellow to orange semi-solids. The max of [(n-Bu)2Sn]n is at 382 nm with the max values of 360-400 nm for other alkyl polymers ranging from Et to n-Dod substituents. Oligostannanes of diethyl tin ([Et2Sn]2-6), show a trend towards redshifting from 232 nm to 325 nm (UV to visible) as the chains become increasingly longer.26 Similarly, [Ph2Sn]n (low Mw in THF*) is slightly redshifted (max = 402 nm) compared to dialkyl species.9 The addition of different aryl substituents was able to further decrease the band gap of these polystannanes and redshift the max of these materials from red to green.10 These polymers show max values of 432-506 nm as seen in Table 1.2.

All compounds have the structure [R2Sn] where R = the substituent. b Extintion coefficents where not reported for these polymers c Insoluble therefore the max of film was reported instead. The electronics of polystannanes have been modelled via Sandorfy HMO27 and LDF28 level calculations. When the calculated band gap energies of polystannanes are compared to those of polysilanes (PSi = 3.89 eV) and polygermanes (PGe = 3.31 eV), polystannanes are considerably lower (PSn = 2.80 eV) based on an all `trans-planar' (TP) geometry.* Calculations using a `gauche-helix' (GH) geometry** lead to larger band gaps following the same trend as the TP geometry (PSi = 5.94 eV, PGe = 5.13 eV, PSn = 4.65 eV). A correlation between the length of the system and the band gap was observed showing a rapid increase slowing towards a horizontal asymptote following a Lineweaver-Burk plot.29 In these calculations, the molecular orbitals that were associated with the HOVB (Highest Occupied Valence Band) and the LUCB (Lowest Unoccupied Conduction Band) were found.

**

Trans-planar geometry is a zigzag confirmation with a Sn-Sn-Sn-Sn torsion angle equal to zero. Gauche-helix geometry is a coil confirmation with a Sn-Sn-Sn-Sn torsion angle larger than zero.

The HOVB structurally exhibits a p characteristic between 5px orbitals of neighbouring tins. The LUCB shows * characteristic of the 5py and 5s orbitals. Bond lengths and angles of polystannanes are heavily dependent on the nature of the side chain substituent. Sn-Sn bond lengths are generally longer with larger substituents, such as (Me3Si)2HC or t-Bu. Larger substituents also distort the tetrahedral nature of the Sn center by increasing bond angles. The changes in bond lengths and bond angles directly correlates to observable and electronic properties such as UV-Vis (band gap), IR/Raman (resonance), NMR chemical shifts, as well as the Sn-Sn coupling in the

studied with model compounds by Dräger et al.30 who explored the electronic and structural properties of tin dimers, trimers, and tetramers. Generally, band gaps were found to decrease with longer Sn-Sn bonds and larger Sn-Sn-Sn angles resulting in a red-shifting of the UV-Vis spectra.

Sn NMR signals are closely related to the nature and type of substituents at the tin

center. Methyl systems display a larger shielding than n-butyl, while t-butyl substituents result in even greater deshielding. Dräger also found that the experimental 119Sn NMR Sn-Sn 1J coupling also correlated to bond length while the 2J coupling correlated to bond angle.30 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of [(n-Bu)2Sn]n show a phase change between crystalline and liquid-crystalline (LC) mesophase structures at approximately* -25°C and the reverse at 0°C. Alkyl polymers with side chains shorter than n-butyl showed only one phase transition. Alkyl polymers with longer side chains showed two reversible phase transitions (see Table 1.3).16 Upon further examination of these polymers through microscopy and X-ray

diffraction, it was observed that all polymers were birefringent below the first transition. Polystannanes bearing Et, n-Pr, n-Bu, and n-Pe substituents showed no change in birefringence up to 100°C.* In contrast, n-Hex and n-Dod polymers showed a decrease in the birefringence above the first transition with n-Oct showing no birefringence** above the first transition. Finally, polystannanes with n-Hex, n-Dod and n-Oct substituents lost all birefringence above the second transition.

1.1.3 Stability
Polystannanes show a remarkable thermal stability up to 200°C. However, polystannanes display inherent light and moisture sensitivity. All known polystannanes suffer from stability issues and therefore must be handled in an inert atmosphere void of light. This makes the synthesis, characterization and processing of polystannanes challenging and reduces their value as materials. Polystannanes have been shown to be air sensitive.6 However, when polystannanes are exposed to pure O2, there is no observed depolymerisation. This indicates that the stability issues are due to moisture and not O2.19 The usual method for the evaluation of the stability of polystannanes is to follow the degradation of the UV-Vis max signal. When exposed to small amounts of moisture (water) the UV-Vis signal decreases rapidly over time. This decomposition is accelerated by the addition of a wet solvent. The light sensitivity of polystannanes has been well studied using both NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopies. It was established that solid state polystannanes are considerably more stable

11

than dissolved polymers and solvents has a great overall effect on the stability of polystannanes. When dissolved in aromatic or aliphatic solvents such as benzene, toluene or short chain alkenes, stability was very poor, with THF showing only slightly higher stability. When polystannanes are dissolved in chlorinated solvents or solvents such as styrene, a higher stability is observed. The stability of polystannanes can be increased by the addition of radical scavengers or dyes. 32 The 119Sn NMR chemical shifts for the breakdown products after light exposure range in from +150 to -200 ppm and have not fully been identified. However, the breakdown to smaller molecular mass 5- and 6-membered cyclic oligomers was observed with little to no further degradation noted. The likely mechanism of degradation is an unzipping of the chains and not random chain cleavage.

1.2 Ferrocenophanes

Figure 1.4: The basic structure of from left to right [1]ferrocenophane, [2]ferrocenophane and [1.1]ferrocenophane Metallocenophanes are macrocyclic structures that contain at least one, and possibly multiple, metallocenes within their cyclic structure. Ferrocenophanes (Figure 1.4) are of particular interest due to the oxidative and light stability of the ferrocene unit. [1]ferrocenophanes (and to a lesser extent [2]- and [3]ferrocenophanes) have been used as monomers for ROP to form polyferrocenylenes (see Section 1.3). Ferrocenophanes where the cyclopentadiene rings of one ferrocene are attached via a bridging unit (also known as ansaferrocenes) are named [n]ferrocenophanes where n denotes the size of the bridging chain.

12

When multiple ferrocenes are involved, a decimal is placed between the lengths of each bridging unit. Therefore a [1.1]ferrocenophane has two ferrocenes that are attached via two bridges with a length of one atom.

Figure 1.5: Examples of the four routes to [n]ferrocenophanes The synthesis of [1]ferrocenophanes is generally carried out through a salt elimination between Fe(5-C5H4Li)2·TMEDA (1,1'dilithioferrocene·N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) and a dichloride (ECl2) related to the desired bridging unit (Route 1). This was first described by Osborne, who in 197533 synthesized diphenylsilyl-[1]ferrocenophane. Previous to this, several other larger [n]ferrocenophanes had been prepared via three different methods (Figure 1.5). The routes of preparation of [n]ferrocenophanes include building the [n]ferrocenophane from a reaction between a linked bi-cyclopentadiene dianion and FeCl2 (Route 2); ring-closing the cyclophane with substituted ferrocenes (Route 3); and finally ring expansion of an existing

13

[n]ferrocenophane (Route 4).34 These four routes (Figure 1.5) are the main methods of synthesis of many of the ferrocenophanes known today.

Figure 1.6: Diagram of the ring strain of ferrocenophanes. The salt elimination method (Route 1) used by Osborne has been used to prepare [1]ferrocenophanes of Group 13 (B, Al, Ga),35,36 14 ( Si, Ge, Sn)33,37,38 or 15 (P, As)37,39 as well as Group 4 (Ti, Zi, and Hf).40 These [1]ferrocenophanes have considerable ring strain ( between in Figure 1.5) which makes them prime candidates for ring-opening polymerizations. [2]ferrocenophanes that contain mixed Group 14 elements (Ge-C and Sn-C bridged) were synthesized via a similar salt elimination of dilithiated methyl ferrocene (5-C5H4CH2Li)Fe(5C5H4Li) with either dialkyl germanium or tin dichlorides. The tetramethylgermyl[2]ferrocenophane was also prepared through a reaction between Fe(5-C5H4Li)2 and 1,2dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetramethyldigermane. Other [2]ferrocenophanes can be prepared via the formation of the ferrocene with the bridge already in place (Route 2), eg. ethylene bridged [2]ferrocenophane; or through a ring closing reaction of a 1,1'-substituted ferrocene, like in the case of 1,1,2,2-tetramethylstannyl-[2]ferrocenophane (see Section 1.4). Several

[n]ferrocenophanes where n is greater than two have been isolated including elements in Group 13, 14,41 15 and 16,42 usually through expansion reactions (Route 4 in Figure 1.5).

Figure 1.7: Reaction to prepare a [5.5] ferrocenophane. Larger homogeneous* [n.m]ferrocenophanes have been of interest to organometallic chemists, however there has been relatively little synthetic, commercial, or industrial use of these materials. [1.1]ferrocenophanes containing Group 12 (Hg),43 13 (B, Ga, In),44-46 14 (C, Si, Sn)4750

or 15 (P, As)51,52 have been synthesized through a variety of different methods. The majority

of these products have been isolated as a by-product from the synthesis of [1]ferrocenophanes or from the ROP of [1]ferrocenophanes to form polyferrocenylenes, and the yields of these products are typically low. A few larger [2.2]ferrocenophanes containing mainly first row elements have also been synthesized,53 however there has been little research into their material properties. Jurkschat et al. prepared a [5.5]ferrocenophane through a Grignard reaction of two 1 ,1'disubstituted ferrocenes (Figure 1.7).54,55

1.3 Polyferrocenylenes
Considerable research effort has been focused on the synthesis of inorganic polymers with specific tunable properties that may be useful in optic and electronic technologies. One such polymeric system under consideration is polymers that contain ferrocene, both as a substituent or as a part of the backbone of the polymer. There has been several review articles published on the

topic of polyferrocenes.56-58 A very brief history of the synthesis of ferrocene-containing polymers and their some of their key properties will be discussed in this section.

1.3.1 Synthesis
Since its discovery in the middle of the 20th century, ferrocene has been utilized in a variety of chemical and biochemical sensing systems. This is largely due to its interesting optoelectric properties, its excellent structural stability, and unique bonding structure. Within a few years of ferrocene's discovery, polymers containing ferrocene as a pendant group were prepared by Arimoto and Haven.59 These polymers were synthesized through both radical and acid catalyzed polymerization of vinylferrocene. Homopolymers and copolymers with methyl methacrylate, styrene and 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene were also synthesized forming ferrocene containing materials with various physical properties. Polymers containing ferrocene and optionally another bridging group within the backbone of the polymer, or polyferrocenylenes, have been largely synthesized through two methods; condensation or ring-opening polymerization (ROP). Of these two routes, condensation is a more established method, but often leads to low molecular weight polymers or oligomers. By contrast, ROP of [1]ferrocenophanes affords high molecular weight polymers as well as demonstrating a living nature, offering greater control over the polymers synthesized. For the most part, ROP of [1]ferrocenophanes is the preferred method of synthesis of high molecular weight ferrocene-based polymers.

The first macromolecular structures with ferrocene as part of the backbone were prepared by Korshak61 through radical recombination.* Later, Neuse described the radical recombination reaction of t-butyl hydrogen peroxide with ferrocene at high temperatures to form insoluble homopolymers of ferrocene (polyferrocenylene).62 Around the same time, low molecular weight a poly(mercuri)-ferrocenylene was prepared though the reaction of 1.1'-

dichloromercuriferrocene with either ethanolic sodium iodide or aqueous sodium thiosulfate.63 Poly(mercuri)ferrocenylene was further reacted in molten ferrocene to form low molecular weight (Mn = 3.5×103 Da) polyferrocenylene. Neuse reacted equal parts Fe(5-C5H4Li)2·TMEDA and Fe(5-C5H4I)2 and was able to prepare a slightly larger (Mn = 6.2×103 Da) polyferrocenylene [Fe(5-C5H4)2]n.64 These materials were not, however, well characterized. Polyferrocenylene was also prepared by Yamamoto et al.65 via a condensation of ferrocenyl dihalides in the presence of Mg to form mainly insoluble oligomers with an Mn  3×103 Da.** When Nishihara et al.66 reacted [Na][(5-C5H4(n-Hex))] with iodide and n-BuLi, the bicyclopentadiene dianion, [Na]2 [(C5H3(n-Hex))2], was formed. The product was further reacted with FeCl2·THF2 to form [(5C5H4(n-Hex))2Fe]n of Mn = 5×103 Da and a PDI of 1.2.*** Rausch et al.67 performed an Ullman coupling reaction to synthesize oligoferrocenylene in the melt through a copper catalyzed reaction. Ullman coupling of Fe(5-C5H4I)2 catalyzed by copper was later used by Foucher et al.68 to prepare modest molecular weight polyferrocenylene of Mw = 5.2×103 (PDI = 3.1). Ullman coupling to produce soluble polyferrocenylenes was also carried out using Fe(5C5H3(Me)I)2 (Mw = 2.0-3.4×103 Da, PDI = 1.21-1.35) and as well as the Fe(5-C5H3(SiMe3)I)2 (Mw = 3.6-8.6×103 Da, PDI = 1.60-3.01).

18

Condensation reactions to form oligomeric and low to medium molecular weight polymeric species that contain both ferrocene and a spacer molecule in the backbone have been also been carried out. Rosenberg was able to prepare polyferrocenylsilanes (both dimethyl and diphenyl) of low molecular weights (methyl Mw = 1×103 Da and phenyl Mw = 7×103 Da) through a condensation of Fe(5-C5H4Li)2·TMEDA with dihalosilanes.58 Foucher et al.60 using the Karstedt's catalyst was able to synthesis oligomeric [Fe(5-C5H4)2SiMe2]n through a dihydrosilylation of Fe(5-C5H4SiMe2H)2 in DCM (Figure 1.8). When this reaction was carried out in DMF the reaction formed a polyferrocenyl disiloxane through an oxygen insertion, forming polymers of molecular weight of 1×105 Da and a PDI of 1.12.69 A similar oxygen insertion was earlier performed by Nakazawa et al.70 using the iron based catalyst (5C5H5)(CO)2Fe(Me) to produce the same polyferrocenyl disiloxane.*

Well characterized polyferrocenyl disiloxanes where formed through a reaction between a 1,1'-bis-silylamide ferrocene and a disilanol by Pittman et al.71,72 to form polymers [Fe(5C5H4)2SiMe2-O-R-O-SiMe2]n where R is SiMe2, SiPh2, (SiMe2)Ph(SiMe2), and (SiMe2)PhPh(SiMe2). These polymers were found to have molecular weights ranging from 7×103 to

5.1×104 Da with PDI's in the range of 2.01 to 2.72. Condensation reactions have been carried out as well to form an azo-bridged polyferrocene. This was performed through a high pressure reaction with Fe(5-C5H4Li)2·TMEDA and N2O gas. The resulting polymer had a molecular weight of 8.7×104 Da and a PDI of 6.69. Rauchfuss et al.,73 through a novel ring-opening abstraction, was able to synthesize a disufide bridged polyferrocene utilizing a Lewis base, (n-Bu)3P, initiated polymerization of a trithia-[3]ferrocenophane. The resulting disulfide polymer was insoluble and difficult to characterize. The issue of solubility was resolved by the substitution of one of the cyclopentadiene rings with an n-butyl group allowing for processing and characterization. The isolated soluble polymer had a molecular weight ranging from 7×103-1.5×105 Da. These polymers were yellow orange oils and showed thermal stability up to 230°C.

Figure 1.10: ROP of Group 14 [1]- and [2]ferrocenophanes. As noted previously the preferred method of synthesis of ferrocene polymers is via ringopening polymerization. This was first carried out by Manners et al.74 who reported the synthesis of polydimethyl-silylferrocene through a thermal ROP of Fe(5-C5H4)2SiMe2. The thermal ROP reaction was performed at 150°C resulting in polymers that had a Mw of 5.2×105 Da and a PDI of  1.5. In addition to the methyl substituted polymer, the phenyl analogue was also synthesised 20

through a similar route. The thermal ROP of Fe(5-C5H4)2SiPh2 was performed at 210°C. The polymeric material formed from this reaction was insoluble and therefore not fully characterized. There have been several experimental conditions used to prepare polyferrocenylsilanes through ROP. These include the use of transition metal catalysts,75,76 anionic initiators,77 and finally initiation through the use of UV radiation.78-81 Both anionic and UV initiated polymerizations were found to be living polymerizations. A considerable amount of control over the molecular weights and polydispersities of this class of polymer has been achieved. ROP has been successfully expended to the preparation a variety single bridged ferrocene based polymers. These include Group 13 (B,82 Al,83 Ga83,84), 14 (Si,74 Ge,85,86 Sn*), 15 (P86), and 16 (S,73,87 Se87). Polyferrocenyl-silanes have been synthesized with a variety of substituents including carbon based substitutents (alkyl,86,88 alkyne,80 and aryl groups88) chlorides,89 and ferrocene.90 Finally there have been several polymetallocenes prepared via ROP with different metals including ruthienium83 and vanadium.91 The living ROP methods of synthesis of [Fe(5-C5H4)SiMe2]n have been used to produce block copolymers. These copolymers include polystyrene, polydimethylsiloxane, and polyferrocenyl silanes of differing functionality. Additionally, the preparation of di-, tri- and even penta- block copolymers can be accessed through these methods. These polymeric materials have shown great potential in nanomaterial and preceramics, due to their optoelectric properties and ability to self-assemble.57

and Pt catalysts. The resulting polyferrocenyl bis(dimethylgermane) had molecular weights of 2×104-5×105Da, and PDI's ranging from 1.7-2.6.

1.3.2 Properties
One of the more interesting properties of polyferrocenylenes is their electrochemical behaviour. First described for biferrocene, cyclic voltammetry presented two defined redox waves (1E1/2 = 0.31V and 2E1/2 = 0.64V relative to ferrocene). This is due to strong Fe-Fe interactions between connecting ferrocenes. Tri- and quater-ferrocenes presented one redox event separated by approximately E1/2  0.2V for every Fe center contained in the molecule. Oligomeric dimethylsilyl bridged ferrocene* species showed similar cyclic voltammetry to that of the unbridged oligoferrocenes with the presence of multiple peaks based on the length of the oligomers. All oligomeric systems with an odd number of iron centers showed only two redox waves (1-3E1/2  0.22V), the lowest of them being broader and having a larger integration. These uneven redox waves are due to two separate undefined oxidations within the first redox event. The systems with an even number of ferrocenes (other than the dimer) showed three redox waves (1-2E1/2  0.15V,
1-3

E1/2  0.22V) however the integration of the central event decreased with

an increase in the size of oligomers. A study carried out by Pannell et al.95 using ferrocene dimers separated by a small dimethylsilane chain (n = 0,1,2,3,6) as model compounds showed a decrease in the E1/2 with an increase in the chain length of the spacer between adjacent ferrocenes. In these model systems interactions between ferrocenes with three spacers showed little peak resolution while six spacers were completely insulating.

*

Oligomeric species, although they do not show the exact same properties as polymeric materials are good model compounds for electrochemical interactions.

The cyclic voltammetry of bridged polyferrocenyldialkylsilanes displayed two redox waves with E1/2 values ranging from 0.21-0.29V indicating significant interaction between the Fe centers. When ferrocene based oligomers are bridged with an insulating methylene carbon, there is a notable decrease in the interaction between the Fe centers resulting in a smaller E1/2 (0.1V). The insertion of an ethylene group between adjacent ferrocenes reduces the Fe-Fe interaction to 0V,86 however if the ethylene group is replaced with a vinyl group then the system regains its conductivity with a E = 0.25V. Similarly, GeMe2 bridged polyferrocenes showed a slightly decreased ability to communicate with adjacent Fe centers (E = 0.20V) while a PPh bridge decreased interactions even further (E = 0.19V). This is likely due to the increased distance between the Fe centers. When GaR was introduced into the backbone, it showed a similar insulating effect to that of a single C bridge displaying two undefined oxidation events and one broad reduction event.

24

The thermal properties of polyferrocenylenes are largely dependent on the composition of the bridge. Smaller substituents on the bridge allow for a tighter packing space and less free volume within the molecular structure of the polymer. As a result, the Tg (glass transition temperature) of polyferrocenylenes decrease with length of the linear side chain (Me>Et>n-Bu>n-Hex).88 However the insertion of ferrocene within the polymer backbone raises the Tg significantly. For example [Fe 5-C5H4)2Si(n-Bu)2]n has a Tg = 3°C, while the Tg for [(n-Bu)2Sn]n is found at -40°C.* In general, symmetrically bridged polyferrocenylenes have lower glass transition temperatures than unsymmetrical ones. This can be seen through

polyferrocenylsilylchlorides (Si(Cl)Me or SiCl2) which have glass transition temperatures of 29°C (SiCl2) and 59°C (Si(Cl)Me) respectively.89 The optical nature of polymers that include metallocenes in the backbone is primarily based on the type of metallocene involved. This is due to the nature of the metallocene electronic structure. As a result, polyferrocenylenes are yellow to red in color. Polyferrocenylsilanes with dialkyl chains show a slight increase in their max as chain length increases (430-450 nm).88 These polydi(alkyl)ferrocenylsilanes are yellow in color with the exception of [Fe(5C5H4)2Si(n-Hex)2]n which is amber. Silylchloride bridged polyferrocenylenes are orange in color, as are the germanium and vinyl bridge polyferrocenylenes,89 while phosphorus-bridged polymers are red in color.

*

The Tg of n-Hex polysilane (Tg = -52.5°C) is much lower than that of the ferrocene analogue (T g  26°C) as well.

The tuneable refractive indices (RI) of these polymers and optical dispersion of these materials show promise in optics and optical electronics. Refractive indices were measured with a spectroscopic ellipsometer at 589 nm, as well as several different wavelengths to determine optical dispersion. Polyferrocenylsilanes, [Fe(5-C5H4)2Si(R)R']n, have a range of RIs from 1.599 (R = Me, R' = CH2CH2CF3) to 1.696 (R = Me, R' = thienyl). For [Fe(5-C5H4)GeMe2]n, the RI was found to be slightly higher (1.689) than its silyl analogue (1.678). Polyferrocenyl stannanes were also measured and will be discussed in Section 1.5.2. Polyferrocenylphosphines,

26

[Fe(5C5H4)2PR]n and phosphine sulfides and phosphine selenides [Fe(5-C5H4)2P(E*)R]n show refractive indices larger any known Group 14 polyferrocenylenes ranging from 1.669-1.737 for phosphines and 1.668-1.747 for phosphine sulfides and selenides. Using the experimental refractive indices seen in Table 1.7, the molar refractions (Rm) for the backbone of each polymer can be calculated. The molar refraction is a measure of the effect that one portion of a molecular has on the refractive index of the bulk material and is directly proportional to the change in refractive index. To calculate the molar refraction eqn. 1 is used where n is the refractive index, Vm is the molar volume and Ri is the molar refraction for different parts of the molecule (ie. the backbone of the polymer, or the substituents).

Since the molar refraction of a given substance is equal to the sum of the molar refractions of individual parts (Eqn. 1) then the molar refraction of the backbone repeat units of the polymer can be calculated. The series of molar refractions for the polyferrocenylenes is Si (57.2) < Ge (58.9) < P (63.2).** The molar refractions can be used to calculate hypothetical refractive indices for polymers that have not yet been synthesized allowing for molecular tailoring to produce desired optical properties.96 Materials that possess high refractive indices can already be produced through conjugation of organic polymers, and through suspension of metal atoms throughout polymeric materials. However, the importance of polyferrocenylenes in this regard is their ability to retain a low amount of optical dispersion with higher refractive indices. This is not true for either

conjugated organics or the suspension of metal atoms. This is based on the calculation of Abbe's number* which is inversely proportional to the optical dispersion.97

1.4 Ferrocenyl stannanes

Figure 1.12: Methods of preparation of ferrocenyl stannanes. Almost immediately after the discovery of ferrocene in 1951, ferrocenyl silanes98,99 were reported, and within a decade the first example of ferrocenyl germanes.100 Beyond a few US patents,101,102 another decade passed before the synthesis of ferrocenyl stannanes was carried out. Dodo et al.103 were able to produce a series (Et, n-Pr, n-Bu) of (5-C5H4SnR2H)2Fe through the reaction of Fe(5-C5H4Li)2·TMEDA with trialkylstannyl halides. Ferrocenyl stannanes have also been prepared by first substituting the cyclopentadiene anion with Me3SnNEt2 (Figure 1.12). The resulting C5H4(SnMe3)2 reacted with n-BuLi to remove one trimethylstannyl group and resulting in the formation of the lithium salt [Li][C5H4SnMe3]. The salt was then added to FeCl2 to form the disubstituted tin ferrocene through a salt elimination of LiCl.104

Dinh et al.105 prepared the first chlorostannyl ferrocene in the literature. Both Fe(5C5H4SnR2H)2 and Fe(5-C5H4SnR2Cl)2 (R = alkyl) were prepared via an exchange reaction with Fe(5-C5H4SnHgCl)2 with R2SnS. The monosubstituted ferrocenyl stannanes have been synthesized through the same method. Dinh was also able to synthesis the phenyl analogue through the same route.

Figure 1.13: Routes to various 1,1'bis(chlorostannyl)ferrocenes and 1,1'bis(stannyl)ferrocenes. Herberhold and Wrackmeyer were able to synthesize the Fe(5-C5H4SnMe2Cl)2 through a redistribution reaction between Fe(5-C5H4SnMe3)2 and two equivalents of Me2SnCl2 at 140°C. This route was an improvement over the Dinh method as there was no use of mercury as either a reagent or a by-product; however this was only performed with methyltins. Herberhold and Wrackmeyer were also the first to prepare the corresponding ferrocenyl tin hydride through a reduction of the Fe(5-C5H4SnMe2Cl)2.41 This involved reacting Fe(5-C5H4SnMe2Cl)2 with

29

LiAlH4 at 0°C under inert atmosphere. Further studies of the reactivity of the Fe(5-C5H4SnMe3)2 system lead to production of a series of disubstituted mono-, di- and tri-chlorides, as well as the corresponding hydrides (Figure 1.13).106 A variety of interesting structural ferrocenyl stannanes have produced through the systems described. Lenze et al. was able to prepare a series of multi-substituted methylstannylferrocenes through reactions with mono- and dilithioferrocene as well as through the initial formation of substituted cyclopentadiene rings that were then further reacted with FeCl2 to form the corresponding ferrocene analogue.107 Wu et al.108 employed a mercury exchange with alkyl tin to form a 6-coodinate tin involving two ferrocenes, two chlorines and two aryl imines. Using (5-C5H4SnCl3)Fe(5-C5H5) synthesized through a modified method Herberhold and Wrackmeyer used to prepare Fe(5-C5H4SnCl3)2;106 Dehnen et al. carried out a reaction with dry Na2S to form a sulfur stannylferrocene cage.109

Figure 1.14: Synthesis of monolithio- or monoiodoferrocene. In general the primary use of ferrocenyl stannanes is for the synthesis of monolithioferrocene and monoiodoferrocene. This can be achieved via a synthesis of (5C5H4Sn(n-Bu)3)2Fe by Dodo's method. The substituted ferrocene is then reacted with one

30

equivalent of n-BuLi producing a monolithiated (tri(n-butyl)stannyl)ferrocene. This product can either be reacted with another suitable halide to produce an unsymmetrical ferrocene110 or quenched with MeOH to form (5-C5H4Sn(n-Bu)3)Fe(5-C5H5) ferrocene,111 which then can be reacted with a further equivalent of n-BuLi to form (5-C5H4Li)Fe(5-C5H5), or the stannyl group can be exchanged via a reaction with I2 to form (5-C5H4I)Fe(5-C5H5) and (n-Bu)3SnI Figure 1.14).112,113 The unsymmetrical ferrocene species have been used to form interesting small molecules,114 or undergone further manipulation to form polymers.115 Seyferth et al.50 was the first to synthesis a homogenous bridged stannyl[n]ferrocenophane in a very small yield ( 3%). During a failed attempt to prepare Fe(5C5H4)2Sn(n-Bu)2, Seyferth was able to isolate, along with considerable polymeric material, the corresponding [1.1]ferrocenophane. Manners later discovered the route to stannyl-

[1]ferrocenophanes involves the use of sterically bulky substituents.38,116 They synthesized both the Fe(5-C5H4)2Sn(t-Bu)2 and the (5-C5H4)2SnMes2 through a reaction of Fe(5-C5H4Li)2 with R2SnCl2 (R = t-Bu and Mes). The preparation of [2]- and [3]ferrocenophanes with di- or tristanna bridging units was carried out by Herberhold and Wrackmeyer (Figure 1.15).41 They were able to perform an intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of Fe(5-C5H4SnMe2H)2 in the presence of R2Sn(NEt2)2 when R = Et, i-Pr, and n-Bu to prepare 1,1',2,2'-tetramethyldistanna[2]ferrocenophane Fe(5-C5H4)2(SnMe2)2. When the same reaction was carried out with Me2Sn(NEt2)2 a deamination coupling reaction occurred to form

1,1',2,2',3,3'hexamethyltristanna-[3]ferrocenophane Fe(5-C5H4)2(SnMe2)3 in a 43% yield.41

31

Fe(5-C5H4)2(SnMe2)2 have been reacted with a series of Group 15 (P)117 and 16 (O, S, Se, Te)118 reactants allowing for insertion between the Sn-Sn bond to form heterogeneous 1,3distanna-[3]ferrocenophanes. Pt metal complexes were also shown to insert between the Sn-Sn bond of a Fe(5-C5H4)2(SnMe2)2.119 When elemental S, Se, or Te were reacted Fe(5C5H4)2(SnMe2)3 the central Sn was replaced with the corresponding chalcogen. When reacted with I2, the central Sn of the [3]ferrocenophane was removed as Me2SnI2 to from Fe(5C5H4SnMe2I)2.120

Figure 1.15: Preparation of stanna-[n]ferrocenophanes. There has been some reports of the insertion of metal carbonyl groups into the Sn-C bond of [1]ferrocenophanes. When the insertion is performed with iron, Fe(CO)4 inserts to form the corresponding [2]ferrocenophane. However when Co2(CO)8 is reacted with di(t-butyl)stannyl[1]ferrocenophane, a ketone bridged biferrocene is formed with SnMe2Co(CO)4 attached to the free cyclopentadiene ring of each ferrocene.121

1.5 Polyferrocenyl stannanes
Currently there are only a few known polyferrocenyl stannanes38,116,122 present in the literature, as well as one polyruthenocenyl stannane123 and one polytroticenyl stannane*.124 Due to limited methods of preparation and the small sampling of stannyl-[1]ferrocenophanes requiring sterically large substituents, the study of polyferrocenylstannanes has been limited. Attempts to synthesize less sterically bulky stannyl-[1]ferrocenophanes leads instead largely to the production of [1.1]ferrocenophanes and polymer.

1.5.1 Synthesis
In 1996 Manners et al.38,116 was able to ring open [1]ferrocenophanes Fe(5-C5H4)2SnR2 where R was either t-butyl or mesityl, to form high molecular weight polyferrocenylstannanes. When [Fe(5-C5H4)2Sn(t-Bu)2]n was left in ambient temperatures for several days ROP spontaneously occurred to form [Fe(5-C5H4)2Sn(t-Bu)2]n, that was found to have a bimodal distribution of molecular weights at 2.3×105 Da and 1.5×104 Da with PDIs of 1.8 and 3.0 respectively. Thermal ROP of the t-butyl [1]ferrocenophane at 150°C produced polymer with a Mw of 1.5×105 Da and a PDI of 1.6 (Figure 1.16). When Fe(5-C5H4)2Sn(t-Bu)2 was dissolved in toluene, non-catalyzed ROP occurred in only 6 h. The resulting high molecular weight polymer had an Mw of 9.0×106 Da and a PDI of 1.6. After 1 h, a low conversion (20%) with a molecular weight of 6.3×105 Da (PDI of 1.3) providing evidence that the polymerization is chain growth in nature. In the presence of chlorinated solvents such as CHCl3, lower molecular weight polymer (Mw = 1×104 Da, PDI = 2.2), as well as the [1.1]ferrocenophane [Fe(5-C5H4)2Sn(t-Bu)2]2 formed within 6 h.

Figure 1.16: Synthesis of [1]ferrocenyl stannanes and ROP to form polyferrocenylstannane. When M = Fe R = (t-Bu), Mes, and PiPP, when M = Ru R = Mes. Compared to the Fe(5-C5H4)2Sn(t-Bu)2, the mesityl substituted monomer showed a reduced ability to undergo ROP. Mesityl monomers required heating for 6 h at 180°C (compared to 30 min at 150°C for the t-butyl monomer) before polymerization was completed. Completely stable when solvent free in ambient temperatures, these tin [1]ferrocenophanes took up to 30 d in solvents to ring open. Polymers formed via thermal ROP had molecular weight of around 1.5×105 Da with the largest polymers synthesized in solution (C6D6) at ambient temperatures for 15 d with molecular weight of 1.35×106 Da, PDI of 1.3 and a conversion of 50%. Attempts to synthesize less sterically bulky tin containing [1]ferrocenophanes was less successful and produced only low to moderate molecular weight oligomeric species as well as cyclic [1.1]ferrocenophanes. These materials had molecular weights of Mw = 1.4×103 Da. The only reported polydispersity index was that of the [Fe(5-C5H4)2Sn(t-Bu)2]n86 with a PDI of 2.3. The ROP of stannyl-[1]ferrocenophane to form polyferrocenylstannanes was initially believed to proceed through a radical mechanism, however there is no evidence for radicals* within ambient temperature reactions.125 Furthermore, the addition of neutral nucleophiles dramatically increased the rate of reaction. When reacted with excess pyridine (0.1M in C6H6), the Fe(5-C5H4)2SnMes2 polymerization reached 95% conversion in 24 h compared to the

control <3% conversion in 24 h at ambient temperatures. Due to the fact that pyridine did not add to the polymer, it was rationalized that the mechanism involved an attack of the Sn-C bond of one monomer by another. Similar results were discovered with the addition of a cationic species such as ROTf (R = H or (n-Bu)3Sn). 126 Pannell et al.122 was also able to prepare and ring open the bulky Fe(5-C5H4)2SnPiPP2 via a similar method. Thermal ROP was performed at 180°C for 2h to form polymeric material which, after precipitation in hexanes, was insoluble in organic solvents.*

R = Me, Et; R' = Me, n-Bu, t-Bu Muller et al.127 in an attempt to synthesis [1.1]ferrocenophanes with alternating bridges of silicon and tin, was able to prepare oligomers of up to 10 repeating units of linear alternating ferrocenyl silanes and ferrocenyl stannanes [(5-C5H4)Fe(5-C5H4)-(SiR2)-(5-C5H4)Fe(5-C5H4)(SnR'2)-]** (R = Me and Et, R' = Me, n-Bu, and t-Bu) as well as cyclic species of alternating ferrocenyl silanes and ferrocenyl stannanes of up to 11 repeating units. This was accomplished

first by preparing a ferrocenyl silane dimer with two brominated cyclopentadiene rings, which was further reacted with n-BuLi, and finally with R'2SnCl2 (see Figure 1.17) to form linear and cyclic oligomeric species. Molecular weights of these oligomers ranged from 2.1-2.9×103 Da with PDI's around 1.4 with two exceptions. Both oligomers (Me and Et silane) containing (nBu)2Sn showed larger molecular weights of 6.3×103 (Me) and 5.9×103 (Et) Da with PDI's of 2.52 and 2.26 respectively.

Other polymetallocenyl stannanes have been synthesised. The first was a thermal ROP of (dimesityl)stannyl-[1]ruthenocenophane to form a polyruthenocene dimesitylstannane, [Ru(5C5H4)2Sn(Mes)2]n.123 Through DSC, the thermal ROP of Ru(5-C5H4)2Sn(Mes)2 commences at 181°C. When ROP was carried out at 200°C for 4.5 h a yield of 45% of the polymer was obtained, with a molecular weight of 6.2×105 Da and a PDI of 2.28. Recently, an oligomeric troticenylstannane was synthesized through a thermal ROP (onset of polymerization occurred at 233°C, DSC) of di-t-butylstanna-[1]troticenophane at 240°C.124 When n-BuLi was added to the same monomer in THF, polytroticenylstannane was formed through an anionic initiated ROP. Polymers recovered had a molecular weight of 1.7×103 Da for the thermal ROP and 1.4×104 Da for the anionic ROP with PDI's of 1.4 and 1.9 respectively (Figure 1.18).

1.5.2 Properties
Polyferrocenyl stannanes display interesting optical, electronic, thermal, and structural properties. They are for the most part air and light stable which is typical of tetra alkyl or aryl tin compounds (R4Sn where R = alkyl or aryl). Thermally, polyferrocenyl stannanes show diverse properties that can be related to the rigidity of the tin bridge.* The [Fe(5-C5H4)2Sn(t-Bu)2]n prepared by Manners had a Tg of 124°C and a thermal decomposition at 210°C breaking down to a red/gold ceramic. This thermal stability is much lower than that of polyferrocenylsilanes,128 in contrast to the much more rigid [Fe(5-C5H4)2SnMes2]n which showed a glass transition at 208°C with thermal decomposition beginning at 320°C forming a gold ceramic. With a Tg of 221°C and thermal decomposition occurring at 270°C, the [Ru(5-C5H4)2SnMes2]n had similar thermal properties to its ferrocenyl analogue. The [Fe(5-C5H4)2SnPiPP2]n also shows a thermal decomposition between 300°C and 400°C, although no glass transition was reported. Metallocene based polymers have optical properties determined by the metallocene within their structure. Ferrocene based polymers are usually yellow to red in color. The polyferrocenyl stannanes are no exception, with the max of the t-butyl and mesityl polymer 452 nm (with a shoulder at 340 nm) and 445 nm respectively. The ruthenocenyl stannanes polymer synthesised formed a white powder, while the troticene polymer was green in color. Refractive indexes for polymers synthesized by Manners et al. have been studied extensively.96,97 The ferrocenyl stannane based polymers show refractive indexes of 1.64 (t-Bu) and 1.66 (Mes) measured at 589 nm. From the refractive index, the molar refraction of the

backbone was calculated to be 63.2* cm3·mol-1 which was larger those that of Si and Ge. A theoretical calculation can be performed using the molar refraction values to predict the refractive index of unknown polyferrocenylstannanes substituted by methyl or napthyl at 1.73 (methyl) and 1.80 (napthyl). These values were higher than those measured for polyferrocenylsilanes, polyferrocenylgermanes, and polyferrocenylphosphines. The RI of the [Ru(5-C5H4)2SnMes2]n was found to be 1.66, the same as the [Fe(5-C5H4)2SnMes2]n. The optical dispersion of these polymers was also calculated. The optical dispersion of polyferrocenyl stannanes was larger than that of polyruthenocenyl stannanes but still lower than organic and metal dispersed polymer of the same refractive indices.** Table 1.8: Electronic properties of ferrocenyl stannanes.

1.6 Research objectives
The wide scale preparation of novel tin bridged ferrocene based polymers has to date met limited success due to the small number of monomers available for polymerization. The main objectives of this research to address this issue by synthesizing tin polymers by the synthesis of ferrocene based polymers via dehydrogenative of reactive monomers which avoids the need to prepare a large number of [1]ferrocenophanes. A further goal is to identify find a simple method of producing stannyl-[2]ferrocenophanes, as monomers for ROP. Finally the ROP of stannyl[2]ferrocenophanes to prepare dibridged polyferrocenyl distannanes will be investigated.

2.0 Polymerisation of Novel Polyferrocenyl Dimethyl Stannyl Polymers
2.1 Introduction:
Since its discovery, ferrocene has been used in the modification of molecular structure. This is due, in part, to its structural stability and interesting optoelectric properties. The first examples of oligo- and low molecular weight polyferrocenyl silanes, [Fe(5-C5H4)2SiR2]n were prepared through the condensation of Fe(5-C5H4Li)2 with chlorosilanes.58 The first well characterized high molecular weight polyferrocenylene was prepared in 1992 by Rauchfuss et al.73 who was able to ring open, by a novel ring abstraction, trithia[3]ferrocenophane through the use of a Lewis base, (n-Bu)3P, initiated reaction to form polyferrocenylene persulfide. In that same year Manners et al. synthesized high molecular weight [Fe(5-C5H4)2SiMe2]n through a thermal ring opening polymerization of a strained Fe(5C5H4)2SiMe2.74 Manners et al. were also able to perform ROP of these monomers to form [Fe(5C5H4)2SiR2]n using transition metal catalysts,75,76 anionic initiators,77 and UV radiation.78-81 Since then, the synthesis, production, and characterization of different polyferrocenes have been of great interest to materials science. Ferrocene polymers that include bridging elements containing Groups 13-1683-87 have been synthesized through ROP of the corresponding [1]ferrocenophanes in high molecular weights and low PDI's. Ferrocene based polymers containing a Group 14 element have been extensively studied. The Manners group has developed a large variety of these polyferrocenylenes containing C, Si, and Ge by ROP methods.85,86,92-94 Previous work in the Foucher group60,69 has described the preparation of [Fe(5-C5H4)2SiMe2]n through a desilylative coupling in DCM as well as a unique 40

polyferrocenyl disiloxane through the oxygen insertion reaction in DMF of Fe(5-C5H4SiMe2H)2 using Karstedt's catalyst. Similar reactions to produce polyferrocenyl disiloxanes were also carried out by Nakazawa et al.70 using an iron based catalyst ((5-C5H5)(CO2)FeMe). Mochida et al.94 was able to synthesize the only known dibridged ferrocene based polymer containing a later Group 14 element. A dibridged ferrocenyl germane polymer was prepared via a ROP of 1,1,2,2tetramethyldigermyl-[2]ferrocenophane using both Pt(acac)2 and Pd2(dba)3 as transition metal catalysts. There are four examples of polyferrocenyl stannanes in the literature to date. Due to the nature of tin, bulky R groups must be used to stabilize stannyl [1]ferrocenophanes, which undergo thermal ROP. Manners was able to synthesize lower molecular weight n-Bu polymers through a condensation reaction of Fe(5-C5H4Li)2 and (n-Bu)2SnCl2;86 whereas the t-butyl and mesityl polymers were prepared through the thermal38,116 and nucleophilic126 ROP* of the t-Bu and Mes stannyl-[1]ferrocenophane. Pannell122 also successfully synthesized and thermally ringopened the diisoproylphenyl stannyl [1]ferrocenophane. Manners123 was also able to ROP a tinbridged [1]ruthenocenophane thermally to form the only known polyruthenocenylstannane.

2.2 Results and discussion
2.2.1 Synthesis of monomers
The preparation of monomers for condensation polymerization was carried out through a similar method to that reported by Herberhold and Wrackmeyer.41 Firstly, (5-

C5H4Li)2Fe·TMEDA was prepared through a lithiation of ferrocene in the presence of TMEDA.

*

The n-butyl polymer was attempt to synthesize the n-butyl [1]-ferrocenophane.

41

The Fe(5-C5H4Li)2·TMEDA was separated as an orange powder and stored under inert atmosphere conditions at room temperature.

Figure 2.1: Synthesis of 3a from 1a via reactions a) Me2SnCl2 at 140°C in static vacuum for 3 h and b) LiAlH4 in Et2O at 0°C in inert atmosphere for 5 h. The preparation of Fe(5-C5H4SnMe3)2, 1a was carried out via a salt elimination reaction between the Fe(5-C5H4Li)2·TMEDA and Me3SnCl. The resulting orange oil was moisture, light, and thermally stable up to 200°C. By-products of this reaction include a small amount monosubstituted trimethylstannyl ferrocene (5-10%) as well as unreacted ferrocene (1-2%). Byproducts were in vacuo at 180°C and purified product was recovered in a 95% yield. Through a redistribution reaction involving Me2SnCl2 and 1a carried out at 140°C, forming Fe(5C5H4SnMe2Cl)2, 2a (Figure 2.1) and Me3SnCl. Compound 2a (dark orange-green oil), was not fully purified, however it was placed in vacuo to remove some of the Me3SnCl by-product and its purity monitored by 119Sn NMR spectroscopy. Compound 2a was immediately reduced with excess* LiAlH4, yielding the dihydride Fe(5-C5H4SnMe2H)2 3a, recovered as a dark orange oil in 82% yield. The mono-substituted dimethylstannyl ferrocene, 3a' was sometimes present as a by-product, however this was removed in vacuo at 90°C. 3a is stable under N2 in ambient temperatures and in light for a few weeks. When left for an extended period of time under inert

excess LiAlH4 allowed any remaining Me3SnCl to be reduced to Me3SnH. Me3SnH is more volatile than its chlorinated counterpart and therefore can be removed completely in vacuo with little effort.

42

conditions, spontaneous dehydrogenative coupling occurs to form oligomeric di-bridged ferrocenyl stannane 4 (Figure 2.2). An attempt was made to synthesize Fe(5-C5H4Sn(n-Bu)2H)2, 3b through two different routes. Firstly, through a salt elimination reaction, 1b was prepared in a 85% yield and purified at 230°C in vacuo. When a redistribution reaction was performed on compound 1b, the result was a mixture of chlorinated species of Fe(5-C5H4Sn(n-Bu)2Cl)2 (2b), Fe(5-C5H4Sn(nBu)Cl2)2, and Fe(5-C5H4SnCl3)2. The redistribution of 1b did not proceed in the same fashion as 1a due to the difference in boiling points of Me and n-Bu tin chlorides. Me3SnCl boils at a lower temperature than Me2SnCl2; whereas the boiling point of (n-Bu)3SnCl is higher than (nBu)2SnCl2. In the redistribution of 1a, the reaction is driven forward by the removal of Me3SnCl; however in the redistribution of 1b, (n-Bu)3SnCl remain in the reaction and is allowed to react further. Attempts to purify 2b were unsuccessful, due to its reactivity with silica, and the ability for 2b to undergo redistribution at temperatures needed for distillation. A second unsuccessful route to the synthesis of 3b, was to first synthesize di(n-butyl)(diethylamine)tin chloride, ((n-Bu)2SnClNEt2) through a salt elimination of lithium diethylamide (LiNEt2) with one equivalent to (n-Bu)2SnCl2. Due to the nature of Sn-N bonds the resulting compound was impure and reactive in moisture, on silica, or when heated in vacuo. When the reaction with Fe(5-C5H4Li)2·TMEDA was carried out, a viscous oil was recovered displaying the presence of at least 3 distinct, inseparable species. No further efforts to obtain this species were attempted.

43

2.2.2 Condensation polymerization
Attempts to polymerize 3a were initially carried out thermally at 120°C and 150°C. Observations by
119

Sn-NMR spectroscopy revealed that both the 1,1,2,2-tetramethyldistanna-

[2]ferrocenophane 5a, as well as polymer 4 were formed via a thermally driven dehydrogenative coupling reaction. Unfortunately, up to 50% of the reaction mixture was found to be an insoluble solid, which is likely cross-linked polyferrocenyl stannane.

Figure 2.2: Metal catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling to form 4. Polymerization of 3a via a Pt catalyzed condensation was performed in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) at room temperature in inert atmosphere (Figure 1.8). By 1H NMR spectroscopy the resulting polymer was determined to be the polyferrocenyl

bis(dimethyl)stannane, 4. This was a surprising result based on earlier research that was carried out by this group involving Fe(5-C5H4SiMe2H)2. When the reaction to Figure 1.8 was performed on Fe(5-C5H4SiMe2H)2 at 90°C in inert atmosphere, oxygen insertion to form a Si-OSi bond was observed lead to the formation of [Fe(5-C5H4SiMe2)2O]n.69 The oxygen source was attributed to the Pt catalyzed reduction of DMF to form NMe3 and subsequent release of oxygen. When a condensation reaction using Fe(5-C5H4SiMe2H)2 with the Karstedt's catalyst was

44

carried out in DCM, a desilylative reaction to form the mono-bridged polymer [Fe(5C5H4)2SiMe2]n occurred. When dehydrogenative coupling was performed on 3a in the absence of light, the reaction did not proceed at the same rate. Additionally, only the synthesis of smaller oligomeric species were detected by GPC. When the polymerization of 3a was carried out in DMF at higher temperatures (> 40°C) or highly concentrated (> 20% w/w)* 40% of the product recovered was insoluble polymer. This was at first surprising given the fact that the monomer was heated to 90°C in vacuo and showed no dehydrogenative coupling through this process. The insoluble solid is likely associated with a cross-linked polyferrocenyl stannane, however there is little definitive evidence based on the lack of solubility of this compound. The cross-linked polymers likely form due to a lowering of the stability of the Sn-Me bond because of coordination of DMF to the Sn center of 3a.

Figure 2.3: Coordination of DMF to a Sn center change the shape form tetrahedral to trigonal bypyrimidal. Evidence in the literature125 suggests that amides are good coordinating agents with organo tin compounds. The coordination of N to Sn causes Sn-C bonds to expand due to the larger amount of electron density on the Sn center, decreasing the already low stability of these bonds. The Sn center will shift from tetrahedral to trigonal bypyramidal geometry (Figure 2.3). When heat is added to NSn-C systems, C-Sn bonds become more susceptible to breaking and

Concentration of reactions is measured in w/w due to the ease of weighing solvent in the inert atmosphere system.

45

thus a site for crosslinking is formed. This hyper coordination is also a possible reason why this reaction occurs at such low temperatures. In this instance, the coordination of DMF to the Sn center of 3a causes elongation of the Sn-H bond, destabilizing it, and making it more reactive to coupling reactions. Condensation polymerization of 3a in the presense of Karstedt's catalyst was performed in DMF over a period of 3 d. After the reaction was quenched with MeOH, analysis of the crude material by 119Sn NMR spectroscopy displayed only the shifts for compounds 4 and 5a.

Figure 2.4: Dehydrogenative coupling reaction mechanism for 3a to form 4. Dehydrogenative coupling of 3a was also performed for several days in C6H6, using a [Pt] catalyst. Using C6H6 as a solvent required higher temperatures and longer reaction times to drive the reaction forward (70°C, 3 d). The longer reaction time as well as the higher temperature of reaction is most likely due to the inability of C6H6 to coordinate to the Sn center.

46

A proposed mechanism for the dehydrogenative coupling of 3a to form 4 follows a similar pathway as the proposed mechanism for the dehydrogenative coupling of (5C5H4SiMe2H)2Fe by Foucher et al.60 The reaction begins (Figure 2.4) with an oxidative addition of Pt(0) into the Sn-H bond to form a Pt(II) complex. Unlike the analogous reaction with the SiH (Figure 1.8), there is no preference for insertion into the Sn-C bond. Instead, a second oxidative addition occurs as the Pt(II) complex inserts into a second unit of 3a to form a Pt(IV) complex. Finally there is a reductive elimination to reform Pt(0) and create a Sn-Sn bond with concomitant the release H2(g) as a by-product.

2.2.3 Ring-opening polymerization
The synthesis of 5a as a polymerizable monomer for the ring-opening polymerization was attempted through the same method originally used by as Herberhold and Wrackmeyer.41 Attempts to prepare 5a in this way resulted in the formation of a previously unreported larger ferrocenophane, as well as minimal amount of the desired product (5%). An improved method utilizing Pd2(dba)3 to facilitate the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of 3a to form 5a was discovered and all monomer was prepared via this new method. The novel reaction to synthesize 5a and the characterization and structural determination of the novel ferrocenophane will be discussed in detail in Section 3.0. An attempt was made to synthesize polyferrocenyl distannanes through a metal catalyzed ROP of 5a. This was carried out based on previous work by Mochida et al. who performed the ROP of 1,1,2,2-tetramethyldigermyl-[2]ferrocenophane.94 Several metal catalysts where employed, and these reactions where monitored by 119Sn NMR spectroscopy.

47

All ROPs were carried out in C6H6 with Pt(acac)2, Pd2(dba)3, and Pd(PPh3)4 catalysts at low concentrations. Reaction temperatures varied from RT to 60°C. All reactions proceeded slowly, with a trace of oligomeric material evident in analysis by
119

Sn NMR spectroscopy and

were not further purified. The only reaction that showed any substantial polymer formation was when the Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst was utilized. The Pd(PPh3)4 catalyzed reaction was carried out at 60°C for 3 d in the dark. The resulting polymer was precipitated from minimal amount of THF into MeOH. Two
119

Sn NMR

signals where detected at -11.63 ppm and at 104.72 ppm, the latter of which is now identified as the chemical shift for the distanna bridged polymer 4. The resonance detected at -11.63 has not been identified, however this could be an end group, or a Pd inserted complex of compound 5a that is not soluble in MeOH.

2.2.4 Characterization by 1H, 13C, and 119Sn NMR
All compounds were identified by
119

Sn NMR spectroscopy and in almost all cases
13

contained only one unique Sn environment. Compounds 1a, 3a, 4, 5a were studied by 1H, and
119

C

Sn NMR spectroscopy. After redistribution reaction of 1a with Me2SnCl2 compound 2a
119

was confirmed by

Sn NMR spectroscopy. Compound 5a was identified as a by-product in
119

several dehydrogenative coupling reactions by its distinct

Sn NMR signal at -43 ppm.

Compound 4 was prepared in two different solvents (DMF and C6H6), extensive NMR evaluations were only carried out on polymer prepared in DMF. Compounds 1a and 3a were readily identifed by their 119Sn NMR shifts at -5.6 and -101.3 ppm respectively. With the addition of chlorine to the Sn center, the
119

Sn chemical resonances

moved down field to 126.8 ppm, similar to values reported by Herberhold.106 Both 1a and 3a

48

were shifted down field from their mono-substituted analogues, with

119

Sn NMR shifts at -4.86

and -101.91 ppm respectively. 1H NMR spectra for 1a and 3a displayed two cyclopentadiene protons that were split into pseudo triplets ranging between 3.9-4.6 ppm. The methyl protons of 1a are present as a singlet at 0.28 ppm (CDCl3) with one set of Sn satellites (1JSn-H = 54.3 Hz). With the introduction of a hydride, the methyl chemical shift was split into a doublet (2J = 2.3 Hz) and two sets of satellites (1JSn-H = 59.0 Hz). The tin hydride chemical shift was split into a septet at 5.47 ppm (2J = 2.3 Hz).

Figure 2.5: 1H NMR (C6D6) spectra for compound 4. The 1H NMR (Figure 2.5) spectra of polymer 4 displayed broad shifts associated with two cyclopentadiene proton environments at 4.35 and 4.15 ppm, and one methyl environment of 49

0.60 ppm integrating for approximately 4, 4, 12 protons respectively. The methyl shift at 0.60 ppm has one set of broad satellites (1JSn-H = 236.6 Hz). Also visible in the 1H NMR spectra were broad end groups with chemical shifts of 4.27 and 4.08 ppm for the cyclopentadiene region, and 1.24 for the methyl shift respectively. Based on the integration of the spectra, the structure was believed to be the dibridged polymer 4 instead of the mono-bridged analogue. Due to the apparent instability of this material, obtaining providing a clean 1H NMR has been a challenge.

Figure 2.6: 119Sn NMR spectrum of polymer 4 that contains the main polymer peak (-104.4 ppm) the 119Sn/117Sn coupling pattern (-89.7 ppm and -119.1 ppm) and the end group (-101.1 ppm). The crude 119Sn NMR (Figure 2.6) spectra confirmed the presence of compound 5a as the by-product of condensation polymerization. Compound 5a is present in most reactions where 3a 50

is a reactant. The
119

119

Sn NMR shift of 5a is easily identified at -43 ppm with a large set of

Sn/117Sn satellites (1J = 5261.5 Hz). When the sample is purified through precipitation in

anhydrous MeOH, three chemical shifts are visible. A large shift at -104.4 ppm was identified as polymer 4 and displayed one set of 119Sn/117Sn satellites (1J = 4381.2 Hz). The coupling constant is within reason for that of a 119Sn/117Sn 1J coupling constant between adjacent tins. This is hard evidence for a Sn-Sn bond within the structure of the polymer. Present in the precipitated polymer 4 was a small shift at -5.70 ppm (Appendix 1.5). The nature of this chemical environment is still unknown, however it must either be associated with polymer 4 (in the form of a stannoxane end group or impurity) or a separate polymer (possibly the mono-bridged ferrocenyl dimethyl stannane). Other than the main
119

Sn chemical shift for compound 4, only a

small end group resonance at -101.10 and a chemical shift for 5a at -43 ppm was observed. Polymer 4 was also characterized by 13C NMR spectroscopy. Three broad chemical shifts were detected for the main chain of the polymer, as well as two smaller end group chemical shifts. These chemical shifts were identified as the cyclopentadiene shifts at 74.62, 71.23 and 69.32 (for the ipso-C) ppm and a methyl shift at -8.68 ppm. There was no observed
119

Sn/13C

coupling, however that was not surprising due to the broad nature of the chemical shifts and the low natural abundance of
13

C and

119

Sn or

117

Sn isotopes. The two small resonances that were

associated with end groups were observed at 74.82 and 71.41 ppm, slightly down field from main chain polymer peaks. The presence of end group resonances in the NMR spectra (1H,
13

C,

119

Sn), of 4 more

accurately describe a low molecular weight polymer. When the methyl end group was integrated by 1H NMR spectroscopy and compared to the main methyl polymer, the end group shift is

51

approximately 12.9% of the signal intensity of the main chain polymer. This suggests that there are approximately 8 (SnMe2)2 bridges in the backbone of this polymer, with a Mn  4300 Da.

2.2.5 Molecular weight determination by GPC

Figure 2.7: The GPC chromatogram for polymer 4 prepared in THF. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), along with 1H NMR spectroscopy, was used to determine the molecular weight of polymer 4 prepared by dehydrogenative coupling of 3a. For these largely oligomeric species the use of GPC was found to be problematic for the determination of molecular weights. A high concentration of polymer (>10 mg/mL) was needed to obtain a small amount of signal, and the RI detector had an extremely low response for the polymeric signal. However, from the right angle light scattering (RALS) and the intrinsic viscosity (DP) the size of compound 4 estimated (from the reaction of 3a in C6H6) was approximately at 5 × 104 Da. A large response in the RI was visible later in the chromatograph, 52

and is most likely due to the presence of oligomeric species in the sample even after precipitation in anhydrous methanol. When polymer 4 was prepared in the absence of light in DMF (Figure 2.8), the GPC chromatograph displayed no evidence of high molecular weight polymer. The resulting GPC chromatograph displayed three distinct peaks at about 20 min retention time. These peaks were most likely oligomeric species based on the large retention times. Accurate an molecular weight calculation could not be performed due to a lack of light scattering of oligomeric species.

53

2.2.6 Electrochemistry
Electrochemical studies were used to probe the electronic nature of 4. Through cyclic voltammetry, the conductive nature of these materials can be understood fully. The relative communication between the iron centers is generally reduced when the distance between them is increased (Section 1.3.2).

Figure 2.9: Cyclic voltammetry of compound 4 at various scan rates. For compound 4, there were two identifiable redox waves present in the CV (Figure 2.9) with 1E1/2 and 2E1/2 of -0.16V and 0.02V respectively (E1/2 = 0.18V). When this is compared with known monobridged polyferrocenyl stannanes (Table 2.1) a loss of interaction was observed. Pannell's model ferrocenyl silane dimers95 also display a loss of communication with expansion of the bridge from 1 to 2 units. Pannell's dimers showed a 27% of communication

54

between ferrocenes (E1/2 = 0.15 V for monobridged and 0.11 V for dibridged ferrocenyl silane dimers) when switching between the mono and dibridged dimers. The degree of electronic communication between known monobridged polyferrocenyl stannanes and polymer 4 is comparable. Table 2.1: Cyclic voltammetry of [Fe(5-C5H4)2E]n. Bridge Structure (E) (n-Bu)2Sn (t-Bu)2Sn (Mes)2Sn Me2SnMe2Sn

2

E1/2 (V) 0.18 0.24 0.14 0.16

E1/2 (V) 0.24 0.24 0.21 0.18

This loss of interaction can be attributed to several different factors. Firstly, redox waves are broad in the CV, obfuscating the signal which will affect the measurement of the E1/2 locations. Secondly, the loss of interaction between iron centers may be associated with a loss of through space interaction.* Finally, when smaller, less bulky substituents are attached to Sn, a loss of interaction between Fe centers is often observed. Although not a direct correlation, the monobridged ferrocenyl silane polymers show a voltage drop of  28% (E1/2 for [Fe(5C5H4)2SiMe2]n is 0.21 V vs E1/2 of 0.29 V for [Fe(5-C5H4)2Si(n-Bu)2]n) n-butyl is exchanged with a methyl substituent.86 This, in combination with the first two effects, explains why the loss of signal is as large as in the case of Pannell's model ferrocenyl silane dimers.

*

The loss of through space interaction has cited behind the loss of communication between Fe centers of other bridged polyferrocenylenes.

2.2.7 UV-Visible spectroscopy and DFT studies

Figure 2.10: UV-Visible spectra in C6H6 for 4 and the TD-DFT calculated spectra for 4a and 4b. The UV-Visible spectrum of compound 4 was carried out in C6H6. The max of this polymer was found to be 452 nm ( = 115.98 L·mol-1·cm-1) similar to other polyferrocenylenes which generally have a max  450 nm. A series of UV-Visible spectra were collected for oligomers of 4 that were prepared in absence of light in DMF. After 100 spectra were collected at 30 s intervals (Figure 2.10), no degradation of the max absorbance was observed. It was later determined by GPC that the sample used was largely oligomeric, rather than polymeric in nature and therefore could theoretically possess higher light stability. Polymer 4 displays a certain degree of light stability as it can be processed under atmospheric conditions with limited degradation. However, if left under atmospheric conditions for extended periods, polymer 4 degraded into an insoluble material. 56

To better understand the electronic structure of compound 4, Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies were carried out on the dimeric and trimeric model system of this polymer, 4a and 4b respectively. The computational software Gaussian 09 revision C01 was utilized for these DFT studies, which were performed using the Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) method and the SDD* basis set. The effectiveness of this method/basis set was determined, along with several other method/basis sets, in a calculation of a basic ferrocene unit. LSDA/SDD was found to be the best at approximating the systems in the lowest amount of calculation time. When the molecular orbitals of 4a were calculated, the nature of the electronic transition was apparent (Figure 2.11). The HOMO of 4a shows a bonding orbital that communicates between the two bridging Sn atoms. As well, there is electron density within the d(z2) system of both ferrocene moieties. This is also true of 4b (Figure 2.12), where the -conjugation is clearly present within both bridges of the molecule. The electronic structure of the LUMO orbitals shows conjugation through the  system of the ipso C on both ferrocenes for 4a and the central ferrocene in 4b as well as empty anti-bonding orbitals of the connected Sn. The HOMO-LUMO energy gap was calculated for both the 4a, and 4b and was found to be 2.86 eV and 2.81 eV respectively. The TD-DFT was performed on 4a to estimate the UV-Visible spectrum. A calculated max at 422 nm is 0.18 eV (7%) higher in energy than the experimental value. Polymers typically generally have a lower gap energy than oligomeric or model systems.

2.3 Conclusion
The first dibridged tin containing polyferrocenylene, [Fe(5-C5H4SnMe2)2]n, 4 was synthesized through a metal catalyzed polymerization of 3a. Polymer 4 was successfully prepared through a condensation reaction in both DMF and C6H6 using the Karstedt's catalyst. Evidence for polymer 4 was also detected in the ROP of 5a using Pd(PPh3)4. Strong evidence that 4 is a low to moderate molecular weight polymer was confirmed by the integration of the proton resonances in the 1H NMR spectra in addition to presence of is characteristic of a Sn-Sn bond. Cyclic voltammetry was also used to explore the electronic interaction between two adjacent Fe centers where a significant interaction was observed between adjacent Fe centers despite an increased Fe-Fe distance. TD-DFT was used in combination with UV-Visible spectroscopy of polymer 4 to further delve into the nature of the electronic interaction of these distannyl ferrocene polymers. In these studies, electron density was located in a  bond between the distannane bridge of a model system at the HOMO energy level.

3.0 Synthesis and Spectral Electrochemical Properties of a Symmetrical Tristanna-Bridged [3.3]Ferrocenophane
3.1 Introduction
[n.n]Ferrocenophanes are macrocyclic organometallic ring systems that contain two ferrocene moieties linked to each other through their cyclopentadienyl rings. Several examples of symmetrical [1.1]ferrocenophanes containing Group 12 (Hg),43 13 (B, Ga, In),44-46 14 (C, Si, Sn)47-50 or 15 (P, As)51,52 linking moieties have been described since the late 1960s. Very recently, several new [1.1]ferrocenophanes containing Al, Ga, or Si bridging elements containing intramolecularly coordinating ligands have been synthesised by the Müller group.129 Larger symmetrical macrocyclic [1.1]ferrocenophanes were also reported by Manners et al. for species with either five or six alternating linked ferrocenes and dimethylsilyl groups.130 Such [n.n]ferrocenes with one or two heteroatom spacer atom(s) usually display strong electronic communication between the ferrocenyl centers as evidenced by cyclic voltammetry, with sequential, well separated, multi-step oxidation potentials as a result of the intimate structural connectivity of the metal centers. The first tin-containing [1.1]ferrocenophane (6a, R = n-Bu) was reported by Seyferth50 who isolated, in very low yield (3%), a crystalline product in the attempted preparation of the strained di-n-butylstanna[1]ferrocenophane (7a, R = n-Bu). The groups of Manners116 and Pannell122 successfully prepared and polymerized examples of ring-strained

stanna[1]ferrocenophanes (7b-d) in to polyferrocenylstannanes (8b-d). Also isolated from the solution polymerizations of monomers (7b, 7c) were tin-containing [1.1]ferrocenophanes (6b, 6c) in modest yields (20-30%). Concurrently, Herberhold and co-workers41 described the

60

synthesis of the closely related [2]- and [3]ferrocenophanes with tetramethyldistannanediyl 5a and hexamethyltristannyl 9a bridges via the reductive coupling reactions of 1,1'bis(dimethylstannyl)ferrocene 3a with dialkylstannyldiamines (10a = (n-Bu)2Sn(NEt2)2, 10b = Me2Sn(NEt2)2). A more sterically hindered distanna[2]ferrocenophane 5b was recently prepared by Braunschweig via salt elimination of dilithioferrocene·tmed a (tmeda = N, N, N', N'tetramethylethylenediamine) with the bulky dichlorodistannane, t-Bu4Sn2Cl2, in good yield.131

Figure 3.1: previously made ferrocenyl stannanes and stannyl ferrocenophanes. There have been a few examples of larger [n.n]ferrocenophanes in the literature54,55,132 including a tin-containing [5.5]ferrocenophane with two (Me2SiCH2)2SnMe2 bridges isolated by Jurkschat and coworkers54 in a 60% yield. We report herein, the isolation, in modest yield, the first example of a symmetrical tin-containing [3.3]ferrocenophane, its characterization by NMR spectroscopy and identification by mass spectrometry, and detail the electronic properties investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.

3.2 Results and discussion
Our interest in Group 14 metallocenes has been focused on the preparation of oligo- and polymetallocenes with at least two bridging atoms between ferrocene units. In particular, dehydrogenative coupling reactions of suitable Group 14 hydrides such as 3a, and metalcatalyzed ring-opening polymerization of novel monomers like the [2]ferrocenophane 5a, have been targeted. Following procedures outlined by Herberhold and Wrackmeyer,41 we readily prepared 3a in comparable yields and purity. Room temperature dehydrogenative coupling of 3a to yield 5a was then attempted with a few Group 9 and 10 metal catalysts. These results are listed in Table 1. Table 3.1.

Of the three catalyst examined, an efficient intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of 3a to form 5a was only observed with catalytic amounts of Pd2(dba)3

(tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)). This proceeded with an isolated product yield of 90%. By contrast, compound 5a previously synthesized by Herberhold et al.,41 used a stoichiometric quantity of 10a at higher dilution resulting in only a 52% yield.

Figure 3.2: (i) Et2O ([3a], [10a] = 0.1 M,), 0º C 1hr, reflux 3hr, hexanes/silica col. (82% yield of 11), (ii) Et2O ([3a], [10a] 0.02 M) 0ºC 1hr , reflux 2hr, 3:2 DCM/hexanes/silica col. (52% yield of 5a). Under an inert atmosphere, the reaction of 3a (Scheme 1) with a stoichiometric equivalent of 10a in Et2O solution was initially carried out at 0ºC, followed by heating this mixture to reflux temperature (3 hr) to ensure ring-closing, to give 5a. When this process was performed by Herberhold, purification by a silica gel column using a DCM/hexanes (3:2) in an inert atmosphere (N2(g)) resulted in a 52% recovery of 5a. In our hands, the reactants were used independently at both the same and at a higher concentration (5 ×) than Herberhold and TLC 63

performed using an identical DCM/hexanes mixture. Unfortunately, this resulted in a considerable "streaking" being observed on the TLC plate. Conversely, development in neat hexanes (also under N2(g)) yielded two distinct spots by TLC. The crude sample was purified by silica gel chromatography eluting with neat hexanes, with two distinct fractions being collected. This accounted for approximately 87% of the product mass (11 and 9a); the remainder of the reaction material remained on the column and could not be recovered.

Figure 3.3. 1H NMR (C6D6) of compound 11 with inset of Cp region. Surprisingly, analysis by NMR (119Sn; C6D6) confirmed the smaller second fraction (5% of the recovered materials) was 5a displaying a resonance at -43 ppm. By contrast, the first fraction, recovered as a bright, orange oil (stable for short periods in air), was isolated in an 82% yield. Initial attempts to carry out the NMR analysis of both the 1st and 2nd fractions in CDCl3 64

resulted in broad, unresolved resonances in the Cp and n-butyl regions, indicative of immediate decomposition in this solvent. When the NMR (1H, Figure 1) of the first fraction was analysed in C6D6, a highly symmetrically substituted [n.n]ferrocenphane, with a detectable trace of another 1,1'-ferrocene or ferrocenophane containing compound (<1% by 1H NMR) along with ferrocene, were revealed. Both trace contaminants were subsequently removed via column

chromatography; however attempts to crystallize compound 11 were unsuccessful.

3.2.1 Sn NMR and NMR simulation
The
119

Sn NMR (C6D6; Figure 3.4) spectrum of this first fraction proved less

straightforward with the two largest resonances assigned to the (SnMe2) substituent at -100.4 and the (Sn(n-Bu)2) group at -211.8 ppm respectively, with a chemical shift difference () of  112 ppm. Multiple isotopic couplings were also identified at each resonance cluster. A simulation of the
117

Sn and

119

Sn NMR spectra was then conducted to elucidate whether the symmetrical

ferrocenophane contained one (9b) or two (11) ferrocene units and to accurately predict the expected 117Sn/119Sn isotopic coupling patterns.  (


)

(2)

At present, there are no readily available NMR modelling tools to accurately predict
117

Sn/119Sn coupling patterns, particularly for compounds that possess multiple Sn-Sn bonds.
117

The data generated from our in-house

Sn and

119

Sn NMR simulator (see appendix S5 for

program data) for the signal intensities is within reasonable agreement with the patterns of coupling observed experimentally, although direct integration of these peak intensities is obviously not possible. This is due to a few factors, including the nature of
117

Sn [1H] or

119

Sn

[1H] experiments where small intensity deviations are likely due to the low intensity of Sn-Sn 65

couplings based on natural abundance. The system was calculated based on equation (2) were PPattern is the total probability of each pattern occurring, I is equal the number of identical systems, PSn is the probability that a tin atom will be one of the NMR active nuclei and X and Y are the number of bridging tins and the number of ferrocenes in the structure respectively. Equation 2 is based a matrix derived from the structure of the [3.3]ferrocenophane as seen in Figure 3.4.

Figure 3.4: The design of the matrices used in 119Sn modeling program. In the simulated and experimental
119

Sn spectrum (Figure 2a, b) of 11, the two largest

calculated intensities were experimentally fixed at -100.5 (SnMe2) and at -211.8 (Sn(n-Bu)2) ppm respectively. Calculated resonance satellites were located based on experimental coupling constants. Using a statistical model (eqn 2),
117

Sn/119Sn and

119

Sn/119Sn satellite intensities were

calculated with intensities above 1% of the largest signal, identifying 12 (2 singlets and 5 doublet) resonances, which was two less than observed experimentally. There were several additional predicted peaks of low calculated intensities that are not observed. It should be noted, that while both compounds (9b and 11) would be expected to have the same coupling patterns on a statistical basis, chemical shifts for the different tin environments should be distinct. The two smaller resonances at -90.8 and -221.2 ppm (  = 130.4 ppm) were tentatively assigned as 9b based on the assignment of the 66
119

Sn resonances by

Herberhold for the hexamethyltristannane bridged [3]ferrocenophane, 9a, (-102.5, -249.3 ppm;   = 146.7 ppm).41 Similar results were also found in the simulation of the compound 11.

3.2.2 Electrochemistry
Further evidence for the [3.3]ferrocenophane structure of 11 was sought by employing cyclic voltammetry. An important metric of the communication between bridged ferrocenes is the degree to which they respond to oxidation/reduction as independent (insulated, single wave) or dependent (delocalized, two or more waves) metallocenes. The difference in the E for

Figure 3.7: Structure of compound 12a-d, 13, 14, and 15. This effect is smaller when compared to non-bridged polymetallocenes or metallocenes linked by conjugated vinyl or acetylene spacers that are assumed to communicate exclusively along a  orbital backbone. Ferrocene units bridged by a later Group 14 (Si, Ge, Sn) dialkyl or diaryl unit are believed to communicate both through the -bonded bridge and through direct Fe···Fe interactions.130 Model ferrocenes and polyferrocenes bridged by two or more spacers show substantially less interaction between metal centers, with ethylene bridges being essentially fully insulating.86 Previous work by Pannell, who prepared a series of bisferrocenes with mono-, 69

di-, tri-, and hexa(dimethylsilane) bridges (12a-d), reported a lower level of communication between metal centers as the bridge length increased (Table 2).95 Beyond three bridging (dimethysilylene) units, only a single reversible wave is observed by cyclic voltammetry.

[1.1]Ferrocenophanes (6b, 6c) show a similar degree of electronic communication (E  0.25V) compared to singly bridged bisferrocenes. In the case of the [3.3]ferrocenophane 11, cyclic voltammetry (Figure 3) in MeCN reveals two oxidation/reduction events at 1E1/2 of 0.01V, and
2

E1/2 of 0.23V. The E of 0.22V for 11 indicates a considerable degree of communication

between ferrocene units and is within the same range as known tin-containing [1.1]ferrocenophanes (6a-c)116,133 and mono-tin-bridged ferrocenyl polymers (8a-c, 8e)86,116,133 or the fully -conjugated [3.3]bisferrocene 14.134,135 The partial oxidation of 11 likely leads to a Class II mixed valence compound according to the Robin-Day classification.136 In the case of 11, this would suggest that electronic communication between ferrocene units is facilitated through both the  conjugation of the ferrocene ring system and the  conjugation of the stannyl bridge.

3.2.3 DFT modelling and UV-Vis spectroscopy

Figure 3.8: Molecular Orbital Diagrams of the HOMO Orbital of compound 11 (left) and the SOMO Orbital of its radical monocation (right). 70

Computational modeling was performed on compounds 11 and 9b as well as several other similar structured compounds (5a, 12a-d, 13). Gaussian 9 was used for DFT and TD-DFT calculations and confirmed by zero point energy calculations. The LSDA method with the SDD basis set was used to calculate and optimize electronic and bonding structures. The electronics of 11 (Figure 4a) was then compared to its experimental max value. The calculations from TD-DFT describe two minor energy transitions (HOMO/LUMO+1, HOMO-1/LUMO+1) and one major energy transition (HOMO-2/LUMO). The Fe···Fe distance of known ferrocenyl silanes, stannanes, and ferrocenophanes were calculated and compared to those of calculated 11 and 9b. The HOMO-2/LUMO gap energy experimentally established by UV-Vis spectroscopy for compound 11 was 2.72eV (calculated for max = 455.1 nm in Et2O). The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy gap for 11 was found to be 2.93eV using LSDA/SDD (7% difference from experimental). Calculated energies are often larger than actual values, which agree with similar calculations Gao et al.137 performed with Pt compounds. TD-DFT was used to simulate UV-Visible spectra and was compared to experimental spectra (Figure 3.8). The simulated spectra for compound 11 was in a higher agreement with the experimental spectra than the simulated for 9b. DFT calculations were also performed on a singularly oxidized species of 11 (Figure 4b). Communication is predicted between the ferrocene centers along the tin bridge in the SOMO and lower energy orbitals (Figure 4). These conduction orbitals were approximately 1eV lower than the SOMO which was centered on one of the ferrocene units, consistent with the experimental electrochemistry undertaken in solution.

3.2.4 Mass spectrometry
DART-TOF* mass spectrometry was also performed on compound 11. The DART mass spectrum shown in Figure 5 was obtained at 300ºC and provides direct evidence for the presence of compound 11 with a cluster of peaks centered at m/z 1428.9, which corresponds to a protonated molecular cation of formula [C44H76Fe2Sn6+H]. The peak within the cluster found at 1433.86 was calculated at m/z 1433.8621. Several other peaks are observed in the DART-MS spectrum and indicate that [3.3]ferrocenophane is both thermally labile and reactive under the conditions of the DART ionization. The DART ionization process produces singly-charged ions via gas-phase proton transfer and is akin to the classical mechanism of chemical ionization

(CI).138 The analyte molecule must first be vaporized in the heated DART stream and so the ionization efficiency is related directly to the volatility of the analyte species. Higher molecular weight products will therefore generally require higher temperatures to promote efficient ionization; however, in the case of reactive or thermally labile compounds, the higher temperature may also contribute to extensive degradation. In addition to the parent ion species [M+H]+, several of the most abundant peaks in the DART-MS spectrum have been identified which support the assignment of compound 11. These include: loss of ­Bu2Sn (m/z 1196.8), loss of ­Me2SnSnBu2 (m/z 1044.8), scission of compound 11 into two halves* ( m/z 713.9) and other assignable ferrocenophanes that include oxygen atoms in their structures (Table 3). When the sample was left in the heated DART stream for an extended period of time (e.g. 10-20s), the intensity of the peak at m/z 1428.9 decreased and a strong peak was observed centered at m/z 498.9. This likely corresponds to the known oxygen containing [3]ferrocenophane 15 (Figure 3.7). To provide further certainty towards the identity of 11, DART-TOF mass spectra were measured at several temperatures (100º-300ºC) and the results are listed in Appendix S3. Unsurprisingly, the signal for the protonated 11 is not observed at low temperatures (100ºC), however, decomposition products of 11 as well as new species that include oxygen were detected. As the temperature was further increased from 200ºC to 300ºC, a distinguishable protonated molecular species appeared (m/z 1428.9), as well as peaks associated with larger fragmentation products including the loss of a single Sn(n-Bu2) unit at m/z 1196.8 and a new peak at m/z 1212.8 that corresponds to the addition of oxygen to this latter species.

Compound 11 is divided into two halves differing only by either a proton or an electron.

73

Figure 3.10: DART-TOF MS spectrum of 11 at 300ºC. Due to the structural symmetry of the products 11 and 9b, the possibility for dimerization of 9b to form 11 during the ionization process was also considered. In this case the protonated molecule [M+H]+ of 9b was expected at m/z 714.9 but was found to be absent from the DARTMS spectrum. Rather, the peak observed at m/z 713.9 is a decomposition product of the [M+H]+ ion of 11. DART-TOF-MS was also performed at different skimmer potentials ranging from 20V-80V with a constant temperature of 200ºC (Table 2). Application of a higher skimmer voltage in the interface region of the mass spectrometer effectively increases the energy of collisions and prevents dimerization. As the skimmer potential was raised, the peaks at m/z 1428.9, as well as peaks larger than m/z 713.9 were found in relatively higher abundance. At a

74

skimmer potential of 80V, the m/z 1428.9 was still detected and provides good evidence that this is not a dimer of 9b, but is in fact the molecular charged species derived from 11.

3.3 Conclusion
A new higher yielding catalytic route to the previously known distanna-bridged [2]ferrocenophane, 5a, was identified. Species of this type will be used for future polymerization investigations in the preparation of polyferrocenes with two tin bridges. The first tristannabridged [3.3]ferrocenophane 11 was also synthesised in good yield through a reaction of 1,1'bis(dimethylstannyl)ferrocene 3 and di-n-butylbis(diethylamino)stannane 10a. An in-house Sn NMR simulation program was used effectively to model the complex Sn NMR spectrum of compound 11 and was found to be in good agreement with the experimental values. MS characterization provides strong evidence to support the assignment of [3.3]ferrocenophane 11. Finally, characterization of the electrical properties of 11 revealed exceptionally strong communication between ferrocene centers through the tristannana-bridge that is within the same magnitude as a single tin-bridged [1.1]ferrocenophane compound, which was also supported by DFT modelling.

H NMR (400 MHz), 13C NMR (100.6 MHz) and

119

Sn NMR (79.5 MHz) spectra were

recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with a BBFO 5-mm direct probe. A 1H pulse width of 30° was used, acquiring a spectral window of 8223 Hz (20 ppm) using a relaxation delay of 1s, acquisition time 3.98s, 32k points (16 scans). The 1H 90° pulse width was 10.4 µs. A 13C pulse width of 30° was used, acquiring a spectral window of 24038 Hz (239 ppm) using a relaxation delay of 2s, acquisition time 1.36s, 32k points (4096 scans). The 13C 90º pulse width was 8.7 µs. A 119Sn pulse width of 30º was used, 8.75 µs, acquiring a spectral window of 100000 Hz (670 ppm) using a relaxation delay of 1s, acquisition time 0.33s, 32k points (15360 scans) with inverse gated proton decoupling. 117Sn NMR (249.29 MHz) spectra were recorded on an Agilent DD2 700 MHz NMR spectrometer. For 117Sn NMR, a pulse width of 30° was used, 4.03 µs, acquiring a spectral window of 62500 Hz (250.7 ppm) using 256k points with inverse 77

11. As well, this simulator was used with values given for 2,2-dibutyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyltristannanediyl-[3]-ferrocenophane 9b as a method of control. Integration for these peaks were calculated by first building a matrix of matrices representing all possible permutations of isotopes. Each smaller matrix was then assigned a probability (intensity) and spectra. All identical coupling patterns were summed and normalized to the largest singlet. Chemical shift assignments were estimated from the chemical shift difference of the two largest resonances, with smaller coupling resonances centered on each peak. Several peaks generated by the

simulation are not observed in the actual spectra as they integrate for less than 0.2% strength of the largest signal and are below the signal to noise cut-off.

4.1.4 Cyclic voltammetry
Experiments were performed under inert atmosphere conditions (N2(g)) through the use of Schlenk conditions. Prior to analysis, samples were degassed for 5 min. Samples of compound 4 and 11 for electrochemistry were prepared at 1×10-5 M in DCM and MeCN respectively. [N(nBu)4][BF4] was used as a supporting electrode in  0.1 M concentration. Electrochemisty for compound 4 and 11 were performed on a MetroOhm FRA2 AUTOLAB type II and type III

respectively, Potentiostat/Galvanostat with a glassy carbon working electrode, Pt counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl Reference Electrode between 0.1-1.0V potentials.

4.1.5 Density functional theory calculations
Gaussian 9 Inc. revC1 was used for all Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time Dependent (TD-DFT) calculations using the LSDA method with the SDD basis set to determine electronic and bonding structures for 4a, 4b, 9a, and 11. Zero point energy (ZPE) calculations found no imaginary frequencies and therefore confirmed that all structures where in a local minimum (see Appendix 5).

4.1.6 UV-Visible spectroscopy
UV-Vis was carried out on a Perkin Elymer Lambda 20 UV-VIS Spectrophotometer. Original samples were collected in the range of 300-800 nm with consecutive data runs collected at 30 s intervals for 100 spectra. All samples were prepared in C6H6 at a concentration  10-3 M.

4.1.7 Gel permeation chromatography
Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) was performed on a Visocotek GPCmax VE2001 with a TDA302 triple detector system. Chromatograph was collected at 1.0 mL/min using a (need info) column. Sample was prepared at 10mg/mL in dry THF. DMF oligomers were run with the UV absorbing agent benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid.

4.1.8 Mass spectrometry
Time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses were performed using a JMS-T1000LC mass spectrometer (JEOL Inc., Peabody, MA) equipped with a Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) ionization source (DART-SVP, Ionsense Inc., Saugus, MA). The DART source was operated

79

with He gas and the temperature was adjusted in the range 100-400C. Isotopic distributions for the observed ionic species were calculated using the Mass Center utility (JEOL) and were in good agreement with the measured mass spectra.

4.2 Preparation of 1,1'-bis(trimethyl stannyl) ferrocene 1a
Exactly 5.71 g (17.7 mmol) of (5-C5H4Li)Fe·TMEDA was added to a 500 mL Schlenk flask in an N2(g) atmosphere. To this flask 150 mL of dry hexanes was added. 7.01 g (35.2mmol) of Me3SnCl was added to a separate 50 mL Schlenk flask, which was then diluted with 50 mL of dry hexanes. Both flasks where cooled to 0°C under N2(g). The Me3SnCl solution was added slowly to the Fe(5-C5H4Li) ·TMEDA solution. The reaction was allowed to stir for 12 h under an inert environment. LiCl was filtered off, and the resulting oil purified at 130°C in vacuoo to remove TMEDA and byproducts. The NMR (1H, 119Sn) chemical shifts were similar to reported values.106 Yield 81%, 7.34 g (dark red oil). 1H-NMR (400.130 MHz, CDCl3, ): 4.272 (m, 4H, Cp), 4.033 (m, 4H, Cp), 0.277 (s, 2JMe-Sn = 54.3 Hz, 18H, CH3) ppm. 119Sn-NMR (149.211 MHz, CDCl3, ): -5.56 ppm.

4.3 Preparation of 1,1'-bis(dimethyl stannyl) ferrocene 3a
Exactly 7.22 g (14.1 mmol) of 1a was added to a 250 mL Schlenk flask, followed by 6.20 g (28.2 mmol) of Me2SnCl2. The reaction was placed under static vacuum then heated to 140°C. After 3 h the flask was allowed to cool to room temperature and dynamic vacuum was applied to remove Me3SnCl. The intermediate, 2a, was reacted further without purification and identified only by
119

Sn NMR spectroscopy ( = 126.8 ppm, CDCl3), in good agreement with reported

literature values.106

80

Approximately 150 mL of Et2O was added to the previous reaction mixture. 58 mL (58 mmol) of LiAlH4 (1 M in Et2O) was added to a separate 1000 mL Schlenk flask and diluted with an additional 50 mL of Et2O. Both flasks where then cooled to 0°C, and the solution of 2a was added drop wise to the LiAlH4 solution over a period of 1h. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 5 h the reaction was quenched with degassed water. The product was extracted with Et2O, and dried over MgSO4 and finally the Et2O removed in vacuo. The resulting oil was distilled at 90°C (1×10-3 mmHg) and stored under N2(g) at -33°C.

In an inert atmosphere, 2.65 g (5.5 mmol) of 1b was added to a Schlenk flask. This was followed by 3.32 g (10.9 mmol) of (n-Bu)2SnCl2. The reaction was placed under static vacuum and heated to 150°C. The reaction was allowed to stir for 2 d. The reaction was monitored by
119

Sn NMR spectroscopy and found to be impure. Purification through distillation was

unsuccessful as a result no further analysis of these products was carried out.

In an inert atmosphere, 2.0 g (6.2 mmol) of (5-C5H4Li)2Fe·TMEDA along with 200 mL of dry hexane was added to a Schlenk flask. In a separate Schlenk flask, 4.22 g (12.3 mmol) of (n-Bu)2Sn(NEt2)Cl was dissolved in 50 mL of dry hexanes. The (n-Bu)2Sn(NEt2)Cl solution was added to the slurry of (5-C5H4Li)2Fe·TMEDA and allowed to stir at RT overnight. The reaction mixture was filtered to remove LiCl, and solvent removed in vacuoo. The crude product mixture was a sticky dark orange oil. All attempts to purify through distillation and column chromatography were unsuccessful.

To this solution 94 mg of a 2% solution of Karstedt's catalyst in xylenes (0.0049 mmol of active catalyst) was added. The reaction was stirred under dynamic nitrogen at ambient room temperature for 3 h. After the 3 h, 1 mL of MeOH was added to quench the reaction. Solvent was then removed under high vacuum.

5.0 Conclusion
A novel polymer polybis(dimethyl stannyl)ferrocene, 4, was synthesized through a dehydrogenative coupling condensation polymerization. The crude polymer was not fully purified, however it was characterized by 1H,
13

C and

119

Sn NMR spectroscopy, as well as

through cyclic voltammetry, gel permation chromatography and UV-Visible spectrocopy. Additionally, model systems where studied through DFT calculations. This polymer is the first evidence of a dibridged polyferrocenyl distannane. The polymer was found to be of low to moderate molecular weight and maintained a degree of electronic communication that is similar to known monobridged polyferrocenyl stannanes. The presence of an intramolecularly coupled [2]ferrocenophane was also discovered as a byproduct of this polymerization. The first tristanna-bridged [3.3]ferrocenophane, 11, was discovered through an amine coupling of a tin amine 10a, and 1,1'-bis(dimethyl stannyl) ferrocene 3a. This [3.3]ferrocenophane was fully characterized through 1H,
13

C and

119

Sn NMR and UV-Visible

spectroscopies, mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry. The [3.3]ferrocenophane was found to maintain strong interation between connected ferrocenes despite the large distance between Fe centers of the connected ferrocenes. Finally, a new and much improved synthesis of 1,1,2,2-tetramethyldistannanediyl[2]ferrocenophane, 5a, was found. This metal catalyzed intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling employed Pd2(dba)3 as a catalyst with a yield of 90%. This was a significant improvement on work previously carried out by Herberhold and Wrackmeyer.41
