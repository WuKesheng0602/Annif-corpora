The  Image  Community   This  knowledge  community  is  brought  together  around  a  common  shared  interest  in  the   role  of  The  Image.  The  community  interacts  through  an  innovative,  annual  face-to-face   conference,  as  well  as  year-round  virtual  relationships  in  a  weblog,  peer  reviewed   journal  and  book  imprint  ±  exploring  the  affordances  of  the  new  digital  media.              

Conference  
Members  of  The  Image  Community  meet  at  The  International  Conference  on  the  Image,   held  annually  in  different  locations  around  the  world.  The  2010  conference  was  held  at   the  University  of  California,  Los  Angles,  USA  and  in  2011  the  conference  will  be  held  at   the  Kursaal  Congress  Palace,  San  Sebastian,  Spain.      Online  presentations  can  be  viewed  on  YouTube.     

Publishing  
The   Image   Community   enables   members   to   publish   through   three   media.   First   by   participating   in   The   Image   Conference,   community   members   can   enter   a   world   of   journal   publication   unlike   the   traditional   academic   publishing   forums   ±   a   result   of   the   responsive,   non-hierarchical   and   constructive   nature   of   the   peer   review   process.   The   International   Journal   of   the   Image   provides   a   framework   for   double-blind   peer   review,   enabling  authors  to  publish  into  an  academic  journal  of  the  highest  standard.      The   second   publication   medium   is   through   the   book   series   The   Image,   publishing   cutting  edge  books  in  print  and  electronic  formats.  Publication  proposal  and  manuscript   submissions  are  welcome.      The  third  major  publishing  medium  is  our  news  blog,  constantly  publishing  short  news   updates  from  The  Image  Community,  as  well  as  major  developments  in  the  various   disciplines  of  the  image.  You  can  also  join  this  conversation  at  Facebook  and  Twitter  or   subscribe  to  our  email  Newsletter.
