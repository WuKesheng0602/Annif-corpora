ABSTRACT  
Farming  algae  for  chemicals,  pigments,  neutraceutical  and  even  fuel  is  not  a  novel  idea.  What  is  new   however   is   recent   volatility   in   energy   prices   coupled   with   heightened   global   sensitivity   to   food   prices  -  partly  instigated  by  the  massive  proliferation  of  food-based  biofuels  ­  that  has  brought  algal   biofuels   to   the   forefront   of   energy   research   and   commercial   activity.   Algal   biofuels   offer   great   promise   in   providing   a   sustainably-sourced,   carbon-neutral   option   that   can   meet   a   significant   portion,  if  not  all,  of  the  global  transportation  fuel  needs  in  the  coming  decades.  For  a  sector  such  as   aviation,  which  has  no  other  short-term  practical  alternative  to  fossil  fuel  liquid  fuels,  algal  jetfuel   offers   a   massive   opportunity   that   if   captured,   can   provide   fuel  cost   and   supply   stability   as   well   as   a   critical   avenue   to   actively   manage   its   growing   GHG   footprint.   However,   being   a   nascent   technology,   the   fuel   pathway   innovation   will   rely   on   heavy   and   continuous   investment   to   accelerate   its   development.   This   study   assesses   whether   a   carbon   price   framework   can   enhance   the   commercialization   potential   of   algal   jetfuel   by   way   of   mobilizing   investment   into   the   technology,   and  if  not,  what  requisite  improvements  in  technology  and  policy  accommodations  need  to  be  made   in  order  to  allow  algal  jetfuel  to  be  competitively  produced.

1.  INTRODUCTION  
   1.1  GLOBAL  TRANSPORTATION  AND  BIOFUELS  
   The  world  population  is  set  to  rise  to  10  billion  people  by  2050  (UN,  2010).  World  energy  consumption  in  the   transportation  sector  is  set  to  rise  by  an  average  of  1.1%  per  year.  Petroleum  and  other  liquid  fuels  are  the   most  important  component  of  transportation  sector  energy  and  will  account  for  the  largest  share  ­  63%  -  of   the  total  growth  in  world  consumption  of  petroleum  and  other  liquid  fuels  from  2010  to  2040  (EIA,  2013).   While  volatile  crude  oil  prices  in  the  last  few  decades  have  brought  matters  of  energy  security  into  focus,   more  recently  a  growing  acceptance  of  climate  change  related  impacts  triggered  by  ceaseless  CO2  emissions   has  also  impinged  on  the  urgency  to  address  sustainable  alternatives  to  conventional  transportation  fuels.      Unlike   the   electricity   market   where   multiple   low   carbon   intensive   technologies   such   as   nuclear   and   hydroelectric   power   exist,   carbon   neutral   production   systems   in   the   transportation   sector   are   far   less   developed   (Schenk   et   al,   2008).   While   some   advancement   in   battery   technology   has   allowed   for   limited   utilization  of  electricity,  it  is  widely  accepted  that  the  vast  majority  of  transportation  vehicles  will  continue  to   depend   on   liquid   fuels   well   into   the   near   future   (Fairley,   2011).   In   this   regard,   biofuels   provide   a   vital   substitute.        Biofuel   production   has   undergone   massive   proliferation   in   the   last   decade   surging   up   from   16   billion   liters   in   2000  to  100  billion  liters  produced  in  2010.  This  feat  has  been  largely  achieved  by  production  capacities  in   the   US,   the   EU   and   Brazil   where   significant   infrastructure   to   cultivate,   process   and   refine   feedstock   (raw   materials)   exist   (IEA,   2011).   According   to   the   2011   International   Energy   Association   (IEA)   Biofuels   Technology   Roadmap,   "conventional  biofuel  technologies   include  well-established   processes   that   are   already   producing   biofuels   on   a   commercial   scale.   These   biofuels   commonly   referred   to   as   first-generation,   include   sugar-   and   starch-based   ethanol,   oil-crop   based   biodiesel   and   straight   vegetable   oil,   as   well   as   biogas   derived   through   anaerobic   digestion.   Typical   feedstocks   used   in   these   processes   include   sugarcane   and   sugar   beet,   starch-bearing   grains   like   corn   and   wheat,   oil   crops   like   rape   (canola),   soybean   and   oil   palm,   and   in   some   cases   animal   fats   and   used   cooking   oils"   (IEA,   2011,   pg.   8).   However,   the   massive   proliferation   of   1st   generation   biofuels   has   not   come   without   significant   social   costs   and   controversy.   The   rush   to   develop   biofuels   has   diverted   a   substantial   amount   of   agricultural   resources   from   food   production   towards   biorefineries.   In   the   US,   one   third   of   the   92   million   acres   of   corn   cultivated   per   year   is   allocated   towards   ethanol  production.  Similar  large-scale  diversions  in  major  food  producing  countries  have  instigated  some  of   the   highest   spikes   in   food   prices   in   the   last   twenty   years   (Graham-Rowe,   2011).   Numerous   high   profile

scientific   studies   also   indicate   that   prolific   cultivation   of   food-based   feedstock   for   energy   production   may   have  yet  unrealized  indirect  climate  change  impacts  as  the  profitability  of  energy  crops  prompt  many  farmers   to  shift  away  from  commodity  food  crops  to  fuel  crops,  eliciting  a  ripple  effect  whereby  compensatory  food   production   is   extended   to   forested   areas   and   non-conventional   agricultural   lands.   In   Malaysia   and   Indonesia,   heightened   biofuel   consumption   and   favorable   government   policies   have   indirectly   triggered   extensive   deforestation   to   accommodate   palm   oil   production   (Graham-Rowe,   2011).   Full   lifecycle   analyses   of   conventional   1st   generation   biofuels   also   report   minimal   GHG   savings   and   in   some   cases,   even   greater   GHG   emissions  when  compared  to  fossil  fuel  equivalents  (Fairley,  2011).                 

1.2  ALGAE  BIOFUELS  AS  A  SOLUTION  
   Whilst  recent  notable  spikes  in  food  prices  and  devastating  indirect  effect  of  1st  generation  biofuels  ushered   public  scrutiny  and  slowed  the  development  of  newer  biofuel  technologies,  disasters   in  Japan  and  the  Gulf  of   Mexico  as  well  as  price  volatility  and  geopolitical  instability  in  oil  producing  regions  have  reemphasized  the   role   of   biofuels   in   the   global   energy   mix.   The   IEA   reports   that   the   expansion   of   biofuel   consumption   from   2%   to  27%  of  global  transportation  fuels  by  2050  could  displace  enough  petroleum  to  avoid  2.1  gigatons  of  CO2  ­   about   as   much   as   the   net   CO2   absorbed   by   the   ocean   every   year   (Fairley,   2011).   Favorable   government   policies,   environmental   legislations   and   emission   standards   in   the   biggest   biofuel   markets   serve   as   good   indicators  of  biofuel  development  in  the  years  to  come.  The  European  Commission  with  its  Renewable  Energy   Directive   (RED)   mandates   10%   of   its   transportation   fuels   to   be   derived   from   biofuels   but   specifically   bars   import   of   fuels   produced   through   unsustainable   practices.   Similarly,   the   US   Energy   Independence   and   Security  Act  (EISA)  and  its  Renewable  Fuel  Standard  (RFS)  derivative  mandates  consumption  of  at  least  36   billion   gallons   of   renewable   fuel   by   2022   while   capping   the   production   of   1st   generation   fuels   (mostly   corn   bioethanol)   at   15   billion   gallons   (Ng,   2010).   Additionally,   to   incentivize   innovation   in   newer   biofuel   technologies,   the   EISA   calls   for   at   least   21   billion   gallons   of   the   36   billion   gallons   to   come   from   advanced   biofuels  (Preiss,  2010).  Algae  biofuels  are  an  advanced  technology  candidate.        Algae   are   microscopic   photosynthetic   organisms   that   fix   sunlight   and   CO2   into   oils,   carbohydrates,   proteins   and   biomass   (Schenk   et   al,   2008).   Unlike   higher   plants,   algae   have   extremely   efficient   photosynthetic   light   harvesting  components  and  a  high  solar  conversion  efficiency  (amount  of  sunlight  converted  to  biomass)  of   1-8%   compared   to   1%   in   terrestrial   crops.   Algae   convert   captured   biological   inputs   into   oils   that   can   be   transformed   to   biodiesel   or   jetfuel   using   standard   transesterification   or   hydrocracking   techniques   respectively   (Packer,   2009).      Commercial   algae   cultivation   for   fuel   is   considered   incredibly   promising   and   pose  a  number  of  advantages  over  1st  generation  feedstock.

1.3  ADVANTAGES  OF  ALGAL  FEEDTSOCK  
   Significantly  Higher  Productivity     Algae  can  capture  95%  of  exposed  light  and  covert  up  to  1-8%  of  the  solar  energy  to  biomass,  compared  to   1%  in  most  terrestrial  crops.  Algae  productivity,  depending  on  the  oil  content  (20-80%),  can  range  between   15-300   times   the   productivity   of   1st   generation   feedstocks   like   corn   and   soybean   on   a   per   hectare   per   year   basis  (Packer,  2009);  it  is  estimated  that  between  2-6%  of  the  total  US  cropping  area  would  be  sufficient  to   produce  enough  algal  oil  to  entirely  satisfy  its  transportation  fuel  needs  (Preiss,  2010).      Requires  Negligible  Land  Use  Requirements   Algae  cultivation  is  not  dependent  on  traditional  agricultural  land  input  and  can  occur  in  marginal  land  across   diverse  climatic  conditions  including  desserts.  Future  commercial  algal  farming  for  fuel  will  not  compete  with   food  crops  and  in  fact,  the  significantly  large  productivity  will  allow  better  utilization  of  remaining  arable  land   (Graham-Rowe,  2011).      Provides  High  CO2  Sequestration   CO2  is  a  growth-limiting  factor  for  algae  and  as  a  result  the  organism  has  developed  efficient  mechanisms  to   selectively  capture  CO2  into  its  biomass.    Large  algae  farms  can  act  as  carbon  sequestration  units  where  flue   gases  carrying  emissions  from  carbon  intensive  industries  can  be  fed  directly  into  algae  growing  vessels  for   sequestration.   Algae   have   a   high   tolerance   for   NOx   and   mercury   content   typical   of   flue   gases.   Although   SOx   concentrations  above  400ppm  can  negatively  affect  the  culture  pH  (Packer,  2009),  the  sulfur  content  can  be   managed   through   pollution   control   mechanism   in   industrial   installments.   Pond   Biofuels,   based   in   Toronto,   has   built   the   world's   first   pilot   facility   that   uses   large   algae   reactors   to   sequester   emissions   from   a   neighboring  cement  factory.  Pond  Biofuel's  reactors  can  sequester  up  to  two  tons  of  CO2  for  every  ton  of  algal   biomass  grown  (Pond  Biofuel,  2011),  a  figure  corroborated  by  reports  noting  one  hectare  of  algae  ponds  have   the  potential  capacity  to  sequester  one  ton  of  CO2  (Schenk  et  al,  2008).  To  add  further  perspective,  based  on   conservative  estimates,  two  billion  tons  of  CO2  can  be  sequestered  by  growing  algae  in  the  space  equivalent  to   the  entire  land  allocated  to  soybean  crop  (63.3  million  acres)  in  the  US  (Knoshaug,  2011).      Cultivation  is  Flexible  with  Water  Quality   Unlike   plant   based   feedstocks,   algae   cultivation   does   not   rely   solely   on   freshwater   and   can   be   undertaken   using  alternative  sources  such  as  seawater  and  wastewater  from  water  treatment  plants.  In  fact,  marine  algae   strains   are   able   to   absorb   vital   nutrients   such   as   nitrogen   and   phosphorus   from   both   seawater   and   wastewater  (Schenk  et  al,  2008).

2.  ALGAL  BIOFUELS  AND  AVIATION  
   The  aviation  industry,  much  like  the  ground  transportation  sector,  is  integral  to  the  global  economy.  In  2010   the  aviation  sector  fostered  56.6  million  jobs  globally  and  generated  $2.2  trillion  in  economic  activity  which   constituted   3.5%   of   the   global   GDP.   Aviation-enabled   trade   of   time   sensitive   goods   provides   a   lifeline   for   a   number   of   developing   countries   exporting   perishable   items   such   as   food   and   flowers   as   major   tradable   commodities.  It  is  estimated  that  about  1.5  million  livelihoods  in  Africa  rely  on  such  direct  aviation  enabled   trade  with  the  UK  alone  (ATAG,  2012).          However,  the  aviation  sector  also  currently  accounts  for  2%  of  global  GHG  emissions  (ATAG,  2009)  and  5%  of   total  anthropological  climate  forcing  (Dallara,  2011).  The  industry  anticipates  continuous  sector  growth  at  an   average  rate  of  5%  over  the  coming  decades  to  be  driven  largely  by  rising  demand  for  air  transport  in  Asia   Pacific.  But  despite  great  strides  in  fuel  efficiency  and  engineering  innovations  expected  in  the  same  period,   aviation's   GHG   footprint   is   set   to   grow   to   3%   (ATAG,   2009)   of   all   global   emissions   by   2050   (Dallara,   2011).   It   is   likely   that   the   jump   in   aviation's   relative   contribution   to   global   CO2   emissions   will   accompany   a   period   characterized   by   heightened   sensitivity   to   climate   change   that   will   inevitably   reinforce   public   and   political   pressure   on   the   sector   to   drastically   mitigate   its   GHG   footprint.   In   terms   of   strategy,   this   presents   aviation   with   the   daunting   task   of   creating   a   sustainable   air   transport   system   that   not   only   poses   minimal   environmental   impacts,   but   one   that   also   satisfies   the   transportation   needs   of   a   globally   connected   society   while   providing   adequate   returns   on   investment   to   attract   (and   retain)   investors,   employees   and   a   supporting  value  chain  (Bonnefoy,  2011).          Aviation  is  vested  in  biofuels  for  three  major  reasons.  Unlike  ground  transportation  where  prospects  for  wide   scale  electrification  exist,  the  aviation  sector  does  not  have  access  to  any  feasible  or  cost  effective  alternative   to   conventional   petroleum   jetfuel,   and   is   therefore   likely   to   depend   on   liquid   fuels   for   some   time   (ATAG,   2011).   Biofuels   provide   a   practical   sustainable   option.   Secondly,   fuel   is   the   single   largest   source   of   expenditure   for   airlines   comprising   about   30%   of   all   its   operating   costs,   which   combined   with   supply   side   constraints   (only   5%   of   world   oil   production   earmarked   for   jet   fuel   production)   makes   the   industry   very   vulnerable   to   volatility   in   price,   supply   and   quality   of   Petroleum   Jetfuel   (PJF)   (IATA   Fuel   Report,   2012).   Moreover,  the  sector  expects  that  the  forthcoming  crude  oil  supply  crunch  and  shift  in  climate  change  policy   in  major  markets  will  greatly  raise  the  price  of  jetfuel.  Biofuels  in  this  sense  will  provide  means  to  regionalize   fuel  production  and  stabilize  supply.  Lastly,  biofuels  are  a  practical  and  crucial  component  of  aviation's  GHG   mitigation   strategy.   As   Figure   1   illustrates,   biofuels   are   the   only   instrument   amongst   a   handful   of   potential   strategies  that  can  impart  the  level  of  emission  mitigation  that  is  requisite  to  meeting  target  the  International   Air  Transportation  Association  ­  a  trade  association  representing  240  members  constituting  84%  of  all  global   air  traffic  -  has  set  for  itself  (ATAG,  2012).

Figure  1  ­  Mapping  Out  Aviation's  GHG  Commitments  (Source:  ATAG  2012).      Currently   these   limiting   factors   have   only   a   marginal   effect   on   the   aviation's   operations   but   in   anticipation   of   significant   market   pressures   and   political   scrutiny,   the   industry   is   aggressively   implementing   forward- looking   economic   measures   to   preemptively   foster   an   aviation   biofuel   industry.   Although   sustainable   bioderived  jetfuels  are  not  yet  cost  effective,  the  aviation  sector  expects  with  aggressive  investment  in  R&D   and   scale   up   of   infrastructure,   significant   economies   of   scale   will   be   reached   within   the   near   future   (ATAG   2011).        Biofuels   derived   from   algal   feedstock   are   one   subset   of   advanced   biofuels   that   show   promise   in   addressing   aviation  needs.  According  to  Paul  Steele,  the  Executive  Director  of  Air  Transport  Action  Group  (the  only  global   organization  representing  all  part  of  the  commercial  air  transport  sector),  "Algae  has  been  identified  as  one  of   the  most  promising  alternatives  so  we  are  eager  to  see  how  it  performs"  (ATAG  Press  Release,  2009).  Algal   Jetfuel  (AJF)  R&D  is  currently  being  spearheaded  by  aviation  funded  activities.

3.  THE  RESEARCH  QUESTION  
   The  biofuel  types  most  in  demand  are  high-quality  diesel  and  jetfuel  since  few  functional  fuel  analogues  for   them  exist.  Currently  the  cultivation  of  algal  biomass  and  extraction  of   its  oil  ­  the  feedstock  for  both  end-use   fuel  types  -  is  very  expensive;  excluding  the  costs  for  biofuel  refining,  production  cost  estimates  for  raw  algae   oil  can  vary  between  $0.75/l  to  more  than  $5/l  creating  an  unlikely  commercialization  scenario  for  at  least   another  10-12  years.  In  the  absence  of  commercial-scale  algal  fuel  operations,  the  optimization,  modeling  and   scale-up  strategies  for  an  algal  jetfuel  production  pathway  remains  uncertain  and  requires  continuous  basic   R&D   efforts   and   investment   (IEA   2011)   to   alleviate   the   pressures   of   high   cost.   Additionally,   AJF's   commercialization  potential  depends  largely  on  its  market  price  relative  to  PJF  which  at  present  is  not  only   very  cheap  to  produce  but  also  does  not  capture  the  inherent  lifecycle  environmental  costs  associated  with  its   use,  a  benefit  that  is  imparted  by  AJF  but  not  captured  or  captured  to  a  very  limited  extent  in  its  market  price   under   currently   policy   environments.   This   forms   the   basis   of   my   research   question:   Can   the   commercialization   scenario   for   AJF   become   more   attractive   under   a   policy   framework   where   carbon   emissions   from   jetfuel   combustion   are   priced   at   relatively   significant   levels?   To   explore   this   question   the   emissions   profile   of   AJF   is   incorporated   into   the   financial   valuation   of   a   hypothetical   AJF   value   chain   to   elucidate   the   impact   a   potential   carbon   price   will   have   on   the   profitability   of   AJF   production.   Because   new   innovations  rely  heavily  on  attracting  private  capital  through  the  promise  of  a  return-on-investment  to  push   product   development,   the   commercialization   of   AJF   will   depend   on   the   profitability   it   can   offer   to   its   producers  and  investors.

4.  THEORETICAL  FRAMEWORK  
   The  use  of  algae  as  an  energy  bearing  crop  for  the  production  of  biofuels  is  not  a  novel  idea.  It  was  first   proposed  by  the  Aquatic  Species  Program  funded  by  the  US  Department  of  Energy  (US  DoE)  in  the  1980s   (Knoshaug  2011)  but  the  program's  findings  resurfaced  and  sparked  a  genesis  of  interest  due  to  recent   volatility  in  crude  oil  prices,  environmental  concerns  and  spiking  food  prices.  Algae  can  be  cultivated  in   freshwater,  saline  or  wastewater  and  requires  little  or  none  of  the  agricultural  inputs  required  by   conventional  biofuel  crops  (Carriquiry  et  al,  2011).  Algae  is  actively  being  investigated  as  a  model  fuel   producing  organism  for  its  voracious  appetite  for  CO2  and  ability  to  transform  multiple  waste  streams  to  high   quality  cellular  constituents  that  can  then  be  processed  into  biodiesel,  bioethanol  or  AJF.  Prompted  by  the   EISA  and  an  advanced  biofuel  mandate,  the  US  has  become  a  hotbed  for  algal  biofuel  research;  as  of  2008   seven  prominent  US  government  laboratories,  thirty  US  universities,  and  around  sixty  biofuel  companies  have   been  conducting  research  in  this  arena,  complimented  by  intense  regional  efforts  in  Australia,  Europe,  the   Middle  East,  and  New  Zealand  (Carriquiry  et  al,  2011).        Notwithstanding  the  proliferation  of  applied  algal  fuel  research,  by  and  large  a  major  roadblock  for  full-proof   economic  analysis  of  algae  cultivation  for  fuel  is  the  lack  of  available  or  verifiable  information  on  performance   due  to  proprietary  technologies  under  development  or  simply  the  absence  of  any  such  commercial  scale   facility  (Richardson  et  al,  2012).  Most  data  quoted  in  the  literature  stem  from  lab  and  pilot  scale   investigations,  many  of  which  adopt  process  assumptions  from  current  cultivation  operations  serving  the   food  and  nutraceuticals  markets  to  simulate  performance  data  for  algal  fuel  cultivation  (O'Connell  &  Haritos,   2010).  Naturally  these  assessments  are  limited  in  the  extent  to  which  they  can  emulate  the  true  performance   and  variable  risks  inherent  to  AJF  production.  Risks  in  this  context  include  (but  are  not  limited  to)  i)   production  risk  (growth  medium  health,  quantity  of  biomass,  oil  content  and  co-product  yields),  ii)  input   prices  (CO2,  labor,  nutrients,  water,  electricity,  construction,  and  maintenance),  iii)  output  prices  (algal  oil  and   coproduct  prices),  iv)  resource  availability  (water,  CO2,  and  land),  and  v)  climate  and  location  (days  of   operation,  net  evaporation,  and  temperature)  (Richardson  et  al,  2012).  The  commercialization  and  mass   adoption  of  AJF  can  be  seen  as  a  multistage  pathway  through  which  the  fuel  technology  innovation  must   traverse  in  order  to  enter  the  fuel  market  as  a  mature  and  profitable  venture  (Vertes  et  al,  2010).  From  an   investor  perspective,  the  multi-stage  risks  coupled  with  the  absence  of  any  commercial  scale  projects  and   incomplete  accessibility  to  proprietary  data  (from  private  entities  pursuing  pilot  tests)  that  could  otherwise   shed  light  on  the  potential  performance  of  real  life  fuel  operations  results  in  an  incomplete  financial  profile  of   AJF  as  a  current  business  opportunity,  which  in  turn  discourages  a  pipeline  of  further  investment  that  is  vital   to  AJF's  continuing  maturity  (Vertes  et  al,  2010).          As  discussed,  aviation's  primary  motivations  for  embracing  AJF  is  to  attain  fuel  cost  stability,  enhance  fuel   supply  security,  and  to  use  AJF  as  a  GHG  management  tool  to  mitigate  rising  sector  emissions  anticipated  to

grow  from  2%  to  3%  of  all  global  GHG  emissions  by  2050  (ATAG  2011).  Aviation's  commitment  to  emissions   targets  is  largely  pushed  by  its  anticipation  of  inevitable  shifts  in  emission  policy  that  will  likely    instigate   elevated  carbon  prices  and  heighten  public  pressure  to  operate  `better'.    This  study  attempts  to  explore  the   central  question,  can  AJF  under  its  nascent  technological  state  become  financially  feasible  and  profitable  to   produce  under  a  hypothetical  carbon  price  framework?  And  if  not,  what  technological  improvements  and   policy  conditions  are  requisite  to  positing  AJF  in  a  cost  competitive  level  with  PJF?  These  questions  are   explored  through  the  impacts  of  perturbing  external  factors  on  the  profitability  of  a  conceptual  AJF  value   chain.  In  theory  (Figure  2),  a  carbon  price  that  penalizes  CO2  equivalent  emissions  offers  low  carbon  intensity   options  like  AJF  a  boost  in  economic  competitiveness;  from  aviation's  perspective,  a  carbon  price  will   incentivize  aviation  to  shift  its  consumption  from  PJF  to  AJF  in  an  attempt  to  save  higher  fuel  costs  incurred   from  emission  penalties.  From  the  AJF  producer's  perspective,  a  carbon  price  will  create  a  demand  for  the   product  and  hence  aid  in  generating  larger  revenue.  Because  aviation  is  heavily  committed  to  seeing  the   successful  deployment  of  AJF  (amongst  other  advanced  biofuel  technologies)  both  in  terms  of  financial   investment  and  policy  engagement/development,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  it  can  be  safely  assumed  that   a  hypothetical  AJF  value  chain  is  a  direct  extension  of  aviation's  role  in  the  arena  i.e.  aviation  invests  in  the   AJF  value  chain  making  the  industrial  sector  an  AJF  producer.

This  study  borrows  data  from  major  technoeconomic  studies  to  build  estimations  for  production  costs  but   also  moves  beyond  process  and  directly  associated  economic  parameters  (typical  of  technoeconomic  studies)   by  including  influence  of  external  policy  measures  to  determine  the  combination  of  conditions  requisite  to  the

feasible  operation  of  a  hypothetical  commercial  scale  AJF  value  chain  (Richardson  et  al,  2012).  The  research   presented  here  rests  on  simplified  assumptions,  foregoing  a  comprehensive  representation  of  the  biofuel   landscape  in  favor  of  an  easy  to  understand  depiction  of  the  biofuel  value  chain  to  accommodate  the  scope  of   the  study.  This  approach  is  justified  by  the  fact  that  at  this  early  stage  in  AJF  innovation,  more  investment  may   be  placed  into  understanding  basic  attributes  of  the  algal  biomass  production  systems  than  the  entire  value   chain  itself;  as  will  become  evident,  there  is  less  value  in  inventing  a  novel  supply  chain  if  the  underlying   harvesting  or  conversion  mechanisms  are  yet  to  be  identified  and/or  optimized.  The  economics  of  pre- commercial  investment  and  rollout  phases,  to  development  and  implementation  will  be  critical  as  AJF   research  matures  and  upstream  stages  are  optimized  (O'Connell  &  Haritos,  2010).  Subsequently,  the   recommendations  made  here  can  guide  activities  undertaken  by  research  organizations,  industrial  sectors  or   governments  in  their  effort  to  chart  a  roadmap  for  AJF  commercialization.     

4.1  ALGAL  OIL  PRODUCTION  SCHEME  
  
The  following  section  briefly  articulates  a  typical  algal  oil  production  process  to  transform  raw  cultivated   algae  to  the  final  AJF.  As  it  stands  now,  a  typical  algal  oil  production  process  amalgamates  multiple  stages  and   technologies  that  are  not  exclusive  to  its  production;  the  preliminary  algal  oil  production  stage  borrows   process  techniques  from  commercial  scale  wastewater  or  fish  feed  manufacturing  operations  where  algae   cultivation  serves  in  non-fuel  producing  markets.  Consequently,  as  proven  by  pilot  and  demonstration   projects,  this  conventional  multi-stage  regime  has  multiple  points  of  inefficiency  but  will  improve  drastically   as  newer  process  technologies  are  developed  to  optimize  algal  oil  productivity  specific  to  fuel  derivatives.   Having  said  that,  it  is  worthwhile  to  appreciate  the  algal  oil  production  process  as  it  is  likely  to  exist  in  the   short  term.          4.1.1.  Strain  Selection   The  first  step  demands  identifying  and  culturing  the  optimal  algal  strain  with  attributes  most  suited  to  the   growth  medium  and  system  conditions  used  in  the  production  scheme.  Ideally  the  right  strain  has  a   combination  of  high  oil  content,  high  growth  rate  and  allows  easy  harvest  and  extraction  of  oil.  Algae  can   grow  in  freshwater,  seawater  or  wastewater  mediums  and  so  depending  on  the  growth  medium  the  specific   algae  strain  with  adequate  tolerance  for  the  growth  conditions  is  selected  i.e.  if  seawater  is  to  be  used  as  the   growth  medium,  salt  tolerant  marine  species  are  most  suitable  (Greenwell  2011).  There  is  a  trade  off  between   growth  rate  and  oil  content;  algae  cells  direct  metabolic  activity  to  growth  and  division  in  times  when   sunlight,  CO2  and  nutrients  (mainly  Nitrogen  and  Phosphorus)  are  plentiful  and  only  switch  gears  to  energy   storage  in  form  of  oil  and  carbohydrate  production  when  growth  sustaining  conditions  don't  exist.  The   cultivation  stage  often  emulates  starvation  conditions  and  so  sacrifices  growth  to  maximize  lipid  content

prior  to  harvest  (Greenwell  2011).    The  type  of  oil  produced  is  also  an  important  consideration  for  the  type  of   fuel  derivative  as  the  chemical  characteristic  of  the  oil  dictates  the  stability  and  performance  of  the  end-use   product.  For  example  in  terms  of  meeting  international  fuel  standards  (Greenwell  2011)  such  as  those  set  by   American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials  (Schenk  et  al  2008),  the  oxidative  stability,  flash  point  and  freeze   point  are  critical  criteria  for  the  type  of  extracted  algal  oil  that  be  can  used  for  aviation  fuels.     

4.1.2.  Cultivation  
   Strains  selection  and  master  batch  culture  is  followed  by  inoculation  of  the  growth  medium  and  cultivation  in   open  raceway-style  ponds  that  are  only  0.2-0.3m  deep  and  vary   in  areal  dimensions  between  0.5-1  hectare   (Greenwell  2011).  Ponds  are  usually  built  in  areas  with  high  solar  incidence,  paddle  mixed,  and  depending  on   intensity   of   operation,   have   delivery   systems   attached   that   pump   CO2   directly   into   the   ponds   (Greenwell   2011)  to  supplement  nutrient  requirement.  Open  ponds  are  simple  and  cheap  to  build  thus  have  become  the   dominant  method  of  algae  cultivation  for  neutraceutical,  animal  feed  and  fuel  production  (Schenk  et  al  2008).        Conversely,   open   ponds   by   virtue   of   being   open   systems   suffer   from   multiple   inefficiencies   that   result   in   suboptimal   biomass   productivity   and   a   large   water   footprint   (Greenwell   2011).   Open   ponds   lose   water   continuously  through  evaporation  and  thus  require  continuous  replenishment  to  avoid  dilapidating  effect  of   rising  growth  medium  salinity  (Packer  2009).  Open  ponds  are  susceptible  to  seasonal  variations  in  weather   and   temperature   and   therefore   make   consistent   levels   of   cultivation   difficult.   More   importantly,   invasion   and   displacement   by   foreign   bacteria,   fungi,   plants   and   other   algal   species   can   also   impact   culture   integrity.   Resilient   algal   strains   can   offer   some   relief   but   must   be   used   at   a   price   as   more   competitive   algal   species   allocate  metabolic  activity  to  resiliency  rather  than  growth  (Knoshaug  2011).       

4.1.3.  Harvest  
   Algae   cultures   typically   are   very   dilute   cellular   concentrates   which   necessitate   dewatering   prior   to   downstream  processing.  The  main  dewatering  techniques  employed  are  Dry  Air  Flocculation  (DAF)  followed   by   centrifugation   or   filtration.   DAF   uses   floc   (inorganic   chemical   or   polyectrolytes)   to   aggregate   algal   suspensions   into   large   clumps   that   can   be   skimmed   off   the   surface   or   collected   after   sedimentation.   Centrifugation  subjects  algal  suspension  to  large  gravitation  fields  that  separates  water  from  biomass  with  up   to  95%  efficiency  (Greenwell  2011).        DAF   is   a   common   technique   adopted   from   water   treatment   plants   where   floc   agent   contamination   of   collected   biomass   and   high   throughput   time   (too   time   consuming   for   the   amount   of   biomass   processed)   is   typical.   Centrifugation   is   considered   to   be   inapplicable   as   a   primary   harvesting   technique   in   commercial

cultivation  despite  its  high  efficiency  because  of  its  high-energy  input  requirement  -  up  to  3000  kWh/ton  of   algal  biomass  (Schenk  et  al  2008).  Although,  filtration  provides  some  relief  from  this  energy  burden,  fast  build   up  of  biomass  eventually  demands  high-power  consumption  (Greenwell  2011).  Additionally,  the  very  dilute   nature   of   algae   culture   itself   limits   how   much   algae   biomass   can   be   concentrated   per   unit   volume   of   water   as   concentrations  above  15%  gives  the  algae  suspension  `non-Newtonian'  characteristics  making  the  liquid  very   difficult  to  pump  to  downstream  processing  steps  (Greenwell  2011).         

4.1.4.  Oil  Extraction  and  Recovery  
   The  algal  oil  production  process  culminates  in  the  extraction  and  recovery  of  algal  oil  that  becomes  feedstock   for  downstream  refining  into  various  transportation  fuels.  Extraction  begins  most  commonly  via  mechanical   crushing  of  concentrated  cell  preparations  followed  by  hexane  treatment  (hexane  is  an  organic  solvent  that   solubilizes   algal   oils)   that   withdraws   the   oil   from   the   disrupted   cellular   mixture.   However   mechanical   disruption   has   not   been   validated   as   the   best   method   to   prime   concentrated   cell   preparations   for   rapid   extraction   of   specific   cellular   targets   (Greenwell   2011).   Similarly,   chemical   reagents   are   not   suitable   in   commercial   settings   due   to   the   risk   of   contaminating   the   chemical   integrity   of   desired   products   and   the   consequent  difficulty  of  purifying  extracted  oil  pool  (Greenwell  2011).         

4.1.5.  Refining  
   Unlike   the   most   popular   biofuel   ethanol,   renewable   bio-derived   jetfuel   can   be  produced   from   any   source   of   vegetable   oils   which   typically   comprise   a   mixture   of   saturated   and  unsaturated   fatty   acid   esters.   The   composition  of  the  mixture  has  major  implications  for  the  properties  of  the  final  jetfuel  including  its  oxidative   stability   and   cold   weather   properties.   In   order   to   ensure  compatibility   with   existing   engine   technologies,   it   is   important  to  refine  the  properties  of  these  biofuels  (Vertes  et  al,  2010)  to  fit  exact  standards  of  the  end-use   fuel.          Once  extracted  the  algal  oil  is  transported  to  refineries  that  have  the  infrastructural  capacity  to  convert  algal   oil  to  AJF  via  a  standard  refining  technique  perfected  in  crude  oil  processing  called  hydroprocessing  (Pearlson   et  al,  2013).  The  algal  oil  is  cleaned  to  remove  impurities  prior  to  hydrogen  gas  treatment  which  converts  the   oxygen   containing   compound   in   the   oils   (olefins)   to   paraffins;   removal   of   the   oil's   natural   oxygen   content   raises  the  heat  of  combustion  of  the  fuel  and  increases  it's  thermal  and  oxidative  stability  (Boeing,  2009).  The   deoxygenated   effluent  is   cooled   and   sent   to   an   isomerization  unit   (Pearlson   et   al,   2013)   where   long-chain   hydrocarbons  are  broken  to  short  chained  products  including  jetfuel  range  hydrocarbons  (Boeing,  2009).  The   isomerized  hydrocarbon  products  are  then  cooled  again  before  being  sent  to  a  separation  tower  where  mixed   paraffin  gases,  carbon  dioxide,  and  excess  hydrogen  is  separated  from  the  liquid  products  and  recycled  into  

  

11  

  
the   hydrotreator.   The   liquid   products   are  separated   into   liquefied   petroleum   gases,   naphtha,  jetfuel,   and   diesel  streams,  and  sent  to  product  storage  tank  farms  (Pearlson  et  al,  2013).  Hydroprocessed  esters  and  fatty   acids  are  referred  to  as  Hydroprocessed  Esters  and  Fatty  Acids  (HEFA)  fuels  (Pearlson  et  al,  2013).      Jetfuel   made   from   renewable   HEFA   feedstock   is   referred   to   Synthetic   Paraffinic   Kerosenes   or   Bio-SPKs   (Boeing,  2009)  to  differentiate  them  from  Jet  A/Jet  A-1,  Jet  Propulsion  fuel  type  8  (JP-8),  or  Jet  Propulsion  fuel   type   5   (JP-5)   used   by   commercial   aviation,   the   U.S.   Air   Force,   and   the   U.S.   Navy   respectively   (ANL,   2012).   The   main  advantages  of  HEFA  fuels  are  their  high  cetane  values,  low  aromatic  and   negligible  sulfur  content  which   greatly  heighten  HEFA's  operational  performance  and  negate  SOx  emissions  (the  prime  constituent  of  smog).   Additionally,  HEFA  fuels  are  `drop-in'  quality,  meaning  they  are  synthetic  equivalents  of  petroleum  products   and   compatible   with   existing   production,   storage,   distribution,   and   combustion   equipment   (Pearlson   et   al,   2013).        Currently  some  Bio-SPKs  are  blended  with  PJF  in  varying  quantities  to  compensate  for  their  generally  lower   energy   density   and   limited   existing   biofuel   production   capacity.   Most   Bio-SPKs   must   undergo   much   more   extensive   and   rigorous   validation   process   to   ensure   that   the   fuel   performs   under   the   operational   stress   of   high   altitude   flight   (Vertes   et   al,   2010).      As   of   July   2011,   ASTM   approved   a   blend   of   up   to   50%   HEFA   fuels   (with  PJF)  for  further  investigation  which  can  potentially  allow  Bio-SPKs  produced  from  algal  oil  to  be  used   widely  in  the  future.  This  follows  a  similar  approval  in  2009  that  enabled  the  blending  of  up  to  50%  of  fuels   produced   from   another   conversion   technology   Fisher-Tropsch   (FT)   with   conventional   jetfuel.   Efforts   are   ongoing  to  approve  additional  fuel  conversion  pathways  (ANL,  2012).     

4.2  AJF  VALUE  CHAIN  
  
Figure  3a  and  Figure  3b  illustrates  the  major  elements  of  an  ethanol  and  AJF  value  chain  respectively;  the   value  chains  generally  encompass  farms,  storage  facilities,  biorefineries,  blending  facilities,  retail  outlets,  and   end-consumers  (Awudu  &  Zhang,  2012)  creating  a  network  of  value  generating  stages  through  which  raw   biomass  is  transformed  to  a  variety  of  marketable  products  (O'Connell  &  Haritos,  2010).  Biofuels  and   Biorefineries  operate  at  the  intersection  of  a  range  of  industries  such  as  forestry,  agriculture  and  waste;  they   engage  actors  in  transport  and  infrastructure,  and  leverage  a  range  of  policy  regimes  at  local,  national  and   transnational  levels.  Due  to  the  broadness  of  the  underlying  stakeholder  network,  a  bewildering  array  of   complex  interactions  inevitably  arises  between  producers,  intermediaries  and  consumers  (O'Connell  &   Haritos,  2010).  However  unlike  the  biodiesel  or  ethanol  value  chains,  the  aviation  sector  has  a  relatively   streamlined  post  -refinery  distribution  system  with  much  fewer  supply  points  and  aircrafts  compared  to  the   thousands  of  supply  points  and  millions  of  vehicles  in  the  road  sector.  For  example,  there  are  161,768  retail   petrol  stations  in  the  United  States  alone  compared  to  only  1,679  airports  that  handle  more  than  95%  of  the  

  

12  

  
world's  passengers  (SAFUG,  2010).  Typically  major  airports  are  supplied  via  one  or  two  fuel  pipelines  directly   from  the  refinery.  Use  of  the  fuel  supply  infrastructure  requires  approval  from  infrastructure  owners  and   agreement  with  airline  operators  using  the  facilities.  Part  of  the  economics  of  Bio-SPKs  is  driven  by  access  to   the  existing  pipeline  infrastructure  (CSIRO,  2011).    Unlike  other  alternative  jetfuels  refined  from  non- conventional  crude  like  shale  oil,  Hydroprocessed  Esters  of  Fatty  Acids  (HEFA)  fuels  such  as  AJF  provide   practical  appeal  by  virtue  of  meeting  or  exceeding  internationally  recognized  jetfuel  specifications  and  can  be   `dropped-into'  existing  aircraft  engine  fuel  systems,  distribution  methods,  and  storage  facilities  without   significant  infrastructure  upgrades  (SAFUG,  2010).  The  2011  ASTM  D7566  approval  of  a  50:50  blend  of  HEFA   aviation  fuel  batches  has  been  a  major  step  forward  in  achieving  AJF  mass  adoption  (CSIRO,  2011).

4.3  CARBON  TAX     
The  concept  of  a  carbon  tax  originated  from  principles  of  welfare  economics  first  proposed  in  1912  by  A.C.   Pigou  who  postulated  that  the  most  cost  effective  way  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  pollution  is  through  a  system   of  tradable  quotas  (emissions  trading)  or  taxation  of  pollution  intensive  goods  (Knight  et  al,  2011).  In  this   sense  a  carbon  tax  is  a  Pigouvian  measure  aimed  at  correcting  the  market  failure  created  by  goods  and   services  being  priced  at  a  level  that  does  not  reflect  their  true  costs  imposed  on  society  i.e.  the  price  of   petroleum  products  do  not  capture  the  environmental  cost  imposed  on  society  in  terms  of  their  climate   change  impact,  pollution,  habitat  destruction,  health  costs  etc.  A  carbon  tax  levied  on  a  product  or  service   captures  it's  negative  externalities  into  the  market  transaction  thereby  creating  a  more  accurate  cost   benchmark  (Sodero,  2011).      Carbon  tax  is  often  used  as  a  policy  instrument  through  which  environmental  standards  are  enforced.   According  to  Porter's  hypothesis,  a  carbon  tax  can  impose  responsible  and  efficient  use  of  resources  as  well  as   spur  emissions-reducing  innovations  that  can  in  turn  cut  production  costs  and  boost  enterprise   competitiveness  (Knight  et  al,  2011);  in  some  notable  cases  a  carbon  tax  has  proved  to  be  effective  in   accelerating  innovation  in  Renewable  Energy  Technologies  (RETs)  and  has  facilitated  their  market  adoption   by  leveling  the  cost  gap  with  fossil  fuel  energy  technologies  (Knight  et  al,  2011).  However  the  wider   effectiveness  of  carbon  tax  as  a  mitigation  tool  is  contentious  due  to  the  mixed  results  noted  by  early-

  

14  

  
adopters  like  Norway,  Sweden  and  Finland.  The  overall  ineptitude  of  Norway  and  Finland's  carbon  tax  is   attributed  in  part  to  its  narrow  policy  base  which  provides  numerous  exemptions  to  regional  emission   intensive  industries  so  as  to  circumvent  the  feared  GDP  impact  of  lower  output  brought  on  by  penalizing   carbon.  Alternatively,  Sweden's  carbon  tax  is  deemed  effective  in  the  district-heating  sector  but  has  had  ``no   discernible  effects''  in  the  transport  sector  due  to  the  relatively  small  contribution  of  the  carbon  tax  to  the   overall  transportation  fuel  costs  (Sodero,  2011).        Having  said  that  the  true  impacts  of  a  carbon  tax  policy  that  targets  all  sectors  of  a  transportation  industry  is   yet  to  be  seen.  This  study  considers  the  carbon  tax  framework  implemented  by  British  Colombia  (BC)  as  the   basis  for  the  carbon  tax  level  employed  in  the  subsequent  economic  analysis.    BC's  carbon  tax  is  unique  in  that   it  applies  both  a  relatively  high  carbon  tax  and  targets  the  entire  transportation  sector  including  aviation   (traditionally  left  out  of  emissions  policies)  (Sodero,  2011).      The  formulation  and  implementation  of  BC's  carbon  tax  was  triggered  primarily  by  two  phenomena.  The  first   is  the  acute  public  concern  centered  on  climate  change  impacts  experienced  in  BC  over  the  last  50-100  years.   During  this  time  B.C.  has  lost  roughly  50%  of  its  snow  covering  while  its  total  annual  precipitation  has   increased  by  about  20%.  The  increasingly  erratic  weather  patterns  are  understood  to  be  consistent  with  the   Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  findings  (BC,  2008).    Concurrently,  warmer  winters  also   contributed  to  the  mountain  pine  beetle  epidemic  that  has  so  far  decimated  more  than  13  million  hectares  of   pristine  pine  forest  -  an  area  equivalent  to  four  times  the  size  of  Vancouver  Island.  The  beetle's  numbers   have  historically  been  controlled  by  cold  winters  but  warmer  weather  is  now  directly  linked  to  their   devastating  spread  (BC,  2008).        Climate  change  and  pine  beetles  moved  to  the  foreground  of  political  and  public  dialogue  in  BC  particularly   between  2001  and  2006  (Sodero,  2011).  In  September  2006,  the  Republican  Governor  of  California   Arnold  Schwarzenegger  approved  the  Global  Warming  Solutions  Act  committing  California  to  achieve  1990   greenhouse  gas  emission  levels  by  2020,  and  to  this  end  permitted  the  use  of  both  market-based  mechanisms   and  regulation.  The  Act  received  accolades  for  its  pioneering  foresight,  prompting  then  BC  Premier  Campbell   to  coordinate  a  period  of  collaboration  between  California  and  BC  on  climate  change  measures  (Sodero,   2011).  In  November  2007,  BC's  Greenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Targets  Act  entrenched  in  law  its  commitment  to   reduce  GHG  emissions  by  33%  by  2020,  and  by  80%  by  2050  compared  to  2007  levels.  The  carbon  tax  is  one   of  few  instruments  to  be  used  to  reach  this  end  (BC,  2008).          BC's  carbon  tax  is  applied  and  collected  in  essentially  the  same  way  that  motor  fuel  taxes  have  been  collected   at  the  point  of  production  or  distribution,  which  minimizes  the  governments'  cost  of  administration  to   government  and  the  compliance  cost  to  those  collecting  the  tax  on  government's  behalf  (BC  Ministry  of   Finance,  2013).  The  tax  rate  started  low  in  2007  and  increased  gradually  by  $5  every  year,  reaching  a  final  

  

15  

  
price  of  $30  per  ton  of  CO2  equivalent  (tCO2e)  emissions  by  2012;  starting  low  gave  consumers  time  to  make   adjustments  from  decisions  made  prior  to  the  announcement  of  the  tax  (BC,  2008).  The  tax  has  the  broadest   possible  base;  all  emissions  from  fossil  fuel  combustion  in  B.C.  noted  in  Environment  Canada's  National   Inventory  Report  is  taxed  with  no  exemptions  made  except  those  required  for  efficient  administration  and   eventual  integration  with  other  climate  action  policies  planned  for  the  future  (BC,  2008).    Unlike  major   Scandinavian  countries,  BC's  carbon  tax  is  used  as  an  emission  reduction  tool  and  not  a  revenue  generation   tool  (Sodero,  2011).  The  tax  mitigates  fears  of  any  negative  impacts  on  economic  activity  and  competitive   advantage  of  businesses  (Lin  &  Li,  2011)  by  functioning  under  a  revenue  neutral  framework  where  all  carbon   tax  revenue  is  recycled  through  corporate  and  individual  income  tax  reductions.  The  BC  government  is  legally   bound  to  present  an  annual  plan  to  the  legislature  demonstrating  how  all  of  the  carbon  tax  revenue  has  been   returned  to  taxpayers  through  tax  reductions  (BC,  2008).        The  carbon  tax  is  a  key  element  in  BC's  emissions  reductions  strategy  but  is  not  expected  to  meet  to  meet  the   targets  alone.  In  time  the  tax  framework  will  be  integrated  with  collaborative  programs  with  Quebec  and   California.  To  avoid  unfairness  and  what  can  effectively  become  double  taxation,  the  carbon  tax  and   complementary  measures  such  as  the  "cap  and  trade"  system  will  be  assimilated  as  these  other  measures  are   designed  and  implemented  (BC,  2008).  BC's  carbon  tax  is  North  America's  first  broad  based  revenue  neutral   carbon  tax  (BC,  2012).  In  time  the  carbon  tax  is  expected  to  send  a  price  signal  that  will  elicit  a  powerful   market  response  across  the  entire  economy  and  result  in  reduced  emissions  (BC,  2008).        Although  its  has  been  5  years  since  the  tax  was  implemented,  at  this  moment  there  are  several  factors  that   prevent  a  definitive  assessment  of  the  tax's  efficacy,  a  major  reason  being  that  emissions  data  is  only  available   up  to  2010  covering  only  three  full  years  of  carbon  tax  implementation;  emission  levels  during  the  period   were  also  substantially  affected  by  economic  slowdown  brought  on  by  the  global  economic  recession,  the   manifestations  of  which  cannot  be  distinguished  from  emissions  reductions  triggered  solely  by  the  tax.   Additionally,  the  gradual  rise  in  the  carbon  tax  traded  some  emissions  reduction  effectiveness  in  the  short   term  for  a  smoother  transition  to  higher  rates  over  time  with  the  intention  that  mitigation  effectiveness   would  increase  as  rates  increased,  and  as  stakeholders  had  time  to  adjust  their  habits  in  response  to  the   carbon  tax  (BC,  2012).     

4.4  COMMERCIALIZATION  OF  INNOVATION    
  
To  produce  AJF  at  commercial  levels  and  an  economically  feasible  cost,  massive  investment  is  required  in   algal  feedstock  Research  and  Development  (R&D  (and  associated  conversion  technology)  and  downstream   biofuel  value  chain  (O'Connell  &  Haritos,  2010).  Literature  suggests  that  powering  commercialization  of  new   energy  technologies  through  mobilization  of  large  investments  is  difficult  as  incumbent  energy  suppliers  and  

  

16  

  
often  adopters  of  RETs  -  utilities,  oil  and  gas  companies,  pipeline  companies  -  have  already  employed  capital- intensive  assets  to  produce  and  distribute  energy  derived  from  fossil  fuels  and  uranium  (nuclear  power).  The   strategic  focus  of  these  entities  is  to  maximize  the  return  on  their  embedded  capital  as  large  investments   require  large  returns;  incumbent  energy  technologies  provide  relatively  low  risk  returns  on  investment  due   to  tried  and  tested  technology  and  a  long  history  of  familiarity  (Walsh,  2012).          Risk,  as  defined  by  the  uncertainty  of  a  profitable  outcome,  is  a  critical  component  of  investment  decisions.   Risks  can  be  a  manifestation  of  various  characteristics  innate  to  the  innovation  in  question  and  its  contextual   market  conditions.  Sources  of  technological  risks  for  AJF  are  (but  not  limited  to)  i)  production  risk  (growth   medium/system  health,  quantity  of  biomass,  oil  content  and  co-product  yields)  ii)  input  prices  (CO2,   labor,  nutrients,  water,  electricity,  construction,  and  maintenance)  iii)  output  prices  (algal  oil  and  co-product   prices)  iv)  resource  availability  (water,  CO2,  and  land)  v)  and  climate  and  location  (days  of  operation,   net  evaporation,  and  temperature)  (Richardson  et  al,  2012).          Investors  also  face  technology  independent  risks  when  investing  in  new  technologies.  The  "adoption  hurdle",   presented  by  the  uncertainty  of  whether  a  new  technology  will  be  adopted  by  end-use  markets,  impedes  the   ability  of  investors  to  predict  with  confidence  the  return  on  their  investment,  leading  them  to  under-invest  in   new  ideas  and  instead  deploy  capital  into  to  less  risky  projects  where  profitability  is  more  predictable  (Knight   et  al,  2011).  The  second  hurdle  is  the  "spillover  hurdle".  Even  if  markets  adopt  the  new  technology,   developers  and  investors  may  not  be  fully  compensated  due  to  positive  externalities  derived  from  R&D   investment  in  that  new  idea.  "The  spill-over  effects  of  this  investment  are  captured  by  competitors  who   indirectly  benefit  by  replicating  the  intellectual  property  and  take  advantage  of  new  technological  know-how.   The  presence  of  this  incentive  asymmetry  creates  a  second  barrier  to  private  investment  in  new  technology"   (Knight  et  al,  2011,  pg.  7).        The  commercialization  environment  for  an  innovation  can  be  defined  by  prevalent  technology-push  or   demand-pull  drivers  (Walsh,  2012).  Technology-push  occurs  when  an  emerging  technology  induces  a  market   demand,  as  opposed  to  a  demand-pull  scenario  where  the  market  calls  for  an  innovative  product  to  satisfy  a   market  need.  "In  other  words,  demand-pull  drives  innovation  to  seek  to  solve  a  market  problem  that  cannot   be  solved  with  existing  technology  whereas  technology-push  results  in  the  adoption  of  an  innovation  because   the  technical  capabilities  of  that  innovation  establish  a  demand  in  the  market,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  an   initial  demand  existed  "(Walsh,  2012,  pg.  34).  In  this  sense,  despite  the  disincentive  for  investments  in   renewable  solutions,  investors  are  drawn  by  the  market-pull  conditions  created  by  the  lack  of  short-term   renewable  alternatives  to  PJF.  AJF  has  the  potential  to  meet  all  of  aviation's  criteria  for  a  sustainable   alternative  but  being  a  nascent  technology  it  embodies  many  risks  that  disallows  straightforward  projections   about  the  profitability  of  any  potential  investments  made  in  developing  or  commercializing  it.  Hence  

  

17  

  
evaluating  AJF  on  its  merits,  potential  profitability  and  risks  becomes  an  essential  exercise  to  determine   whether  the  technology  can  bear  fruit  for  investors.        This  study  culminates  in  an  economic  assessment  of  AJF  from  a  project  valuation  perspective  that  includes   the  inclusion  of  carbon  reduction  valuation.  The  financial  feasibility  of  a  hypothetical  AJF  value  chain   depends  on  its  Capital  Expenses  (CAPEX),  Operating  Expenses  (OPEX),  and  expected  annual  cash  flows  over   its  operational  life.  In  addition,  the  valuation  model  takes  into  account  risk  in  form  of  the  Weighted  Average   Cost  of  Capital  (WACC)  characteristic  of  the  aviation  industry  (Richardson  et  al,  2012).  Details  of  the  valuation   model  used  and  its  entailing  assumptions  are  covered  in  the  following  methodology  section.

5.  METHODOLOGY  
  

5.1  NET  PRESENT  VALUE  (NPV)  
   Investigating  the  commercializing  potential  of  AJF  technology  is  essentially  an  exercise  in  evaluating  the   profitability  of  an  investment  in  a  hypothetical  AJF  value  chain.  To  do  this,  this  study  supposes  a  simple   scenario  ­  the  aviation  industry  is  a  single  entity  that  financially  commits  to  a  linear  AJF  value  chain  and   investor  expectation  of  some  return  on  the  investment.  The  investor  operates  the  algal  plant,  produces  oil,   and  oversees  its  transformation  and  distribution  in  the  jetfuel  market.  The  net  revenue  generated  from  sale  of   AJF  returns  to  the  investor  as  profit.  Not  only  must  the  AJF  technology  achieve  a  surplus  from  operations  to   cover  its  operation  expenses,  but  it  must  also  provide  a  surplus  to  meet  the  investment's  expected  return.  The   approach  follows  the  simplified  conceptual  framework  used  by  Shiho  et  al  (Shiho  et  al,  2012).  In  order  to   estimate  the  expected  profitability  of  this  venture,  or  lack  thereof,  a  Net  Present  Value  (NPV)  analysis  is  used.   NPV  sums  the  newly  added  capital  value  of  an  investment  generated  through  business  operations,  and  when   this  value  becomes  positive,  investors  receive  positive  indication  that  their  capital  commitment  might  entail   promising  prospects  (Shiho  et  al,  2012).      NPV  derives  from  the  concept  of  Discounted  Cash  Flow  (DCF),  a  fundamental  valuation  methodology  broadly   employed  by  investment  bankers,  corporate  officers,  university  professors  and  investors.  It  rests  on  the   notion  of  time  value  of  money,  which  in  simple  terms  describes  the  future  uncertainty  of  investments  made  in   the  present  time  i.e.  time  value  of  money  captures  the  value  of  future  transactions  that  result  from  a  capital   investment  made  in  the  present,  describing  potential  monetary  transactions  in  present  day  terms.  In  this  way,   the  value  of  an  investment  can  be  estimated  from  the  Present  Value  (PV)  of  its  projected  Cash  Flows  (CF),  or   the  revenues  and  costs  generated  over  the  lifetime  of  the  business  venture  as  a  result  of  the  investment.   Future  CFs  discounted  in  today's  terms  are  called  DCFs  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009).    The  value  of  a  target   investment  described  by  it's  projected  DCFs  is  considered  to  be  the  investment's  intrinsic  value  as  opposed  to   its  market  value,  which  is  the  value  ascribed  by  the  market  at  a  given  point  in  time.  In  practical  terms  DCFs   serve  as  an  important  analogue  to  market-based  valuation  techniques  which  are  often  subject  to  external   market  forces  that  can  distort  the  true  valuation  of  the  target  investment  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009).  DCFs   are  informed  by  assumptions  and  judgments  immediate  to  the  target  investment  like  expected  financial   performance  including  sales  growth  rates,  profit  margins  and  capital  expenditures  requirements  (Rosenbaum   &  Pearl,  2009).      Conventionally  to  calculate  DCFs,  the  lifetime  Free  Cash  Flows  (FCFs)  are  first  determined.  FCFs  are  the  cash   generated  by  a  project  after  all  OPEX,  associated  taxes,  CAPEX  and  working  capital  are  committed,  but  prior  

  

19  

  
to  making  any  interest  payments  (due  from  institutional  debt)  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009).  FCF  is  a  practical   measure  of  a  venture's  projected  financial  performance  because  it  factors  out  tax  ramifications  and   depreciation  of  capital  assets.  But  FCF  calculation  warrants  a  deeper  study  of  market  conditions  and  regional   tax  codes  which  in  addition  to  being  outside  the  scope  of  this  study,  is  also  difficult  to  conduct  in  the  absence   of  any  commercial  scale  AJF  operations  that  could  provide  cash  flow  benchmarks  to  inform  the  financial   assumptions  of  the  hypothetical  AJF  value  chain.  Instead,  this  study  derives  the  DCFs  from  the  project's   Earnings  Before  Interest,  Taxes,  Depreciation  and  Amortization  (EBITDA)  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009)  to   separate  the  final  NPV  from  consideration  for  any  jurisdiction-specific  treatment  of  corporate  activity.       

5.2  EBITDA  Formula  
   i)  The  EBITDA  formula  (Sun  et  al,  2011)  used  is:   EBITDA  =  Revenue  (from  sale  of  AJF)  +  Revenue  (monetized  emissions  benefit  from  AJF)  ­  Cost  of  Production   of  AJF     *  Cost  of  Production  includes  CAPEX  factors  (cost  of  land,  equipment,  facilities,  and  indirect  expenditures)  and   OPEX  factors  (labor,  maintenance  cost,  raw  material  cost,  and  utility  cost)      Each  yearly  EBITDA  is  discounted  to  PV  to  derive  yearly  DCF  over  the  entire  valuation  period.  Total  EBITDA   is  calculated  from  all  years  in  the  valuation  period.      ii)  The  formula  for  PV  (Fabozzi,  2009)  is:     PV  =  (CF)/[(1+i)N]        Here  `i'  is  the  Discount  Factor  (DF).  The  DF  is  the  numerical  representation  of  the  risk  facing  the  investment's   projected  returns  (Fabozzi,  2009).  Profitability  may  vary  for  companies  within  a  given  sector  depending  on  a   multitude  of  factors  including  management,  brand,  customer  base,  operational  focus,  product  mix,   sales/marketing  strategy,  scale,  and  technology.  A  venture's  growth  profile  can  vary  significantly  from  that  of   its  sector  peers  and  so  different  companies,  industries  and  investment  scenarios  can  be  characterized  by   different  DFs  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009).  The  DF  used  in  aviation's  case  is  called  the  Weighted  Average  Cost   of  Capital  (WACC).  Airlines  can  be  described  by  varying  costs  of  capital  due  to  differences  in  operational   challenges,  profitability,  risk  profiles  and  tax  ramifications.  The  WACC  employed  in  this  study  is  an  aviation   industry-wide  estimation  derived  from  the  `sum  of  its  parts'  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009)  and  quoted  by  the   IATA  in  its  financial  forecast  (IATA  Financial  Forecast,  2012).  The  WACC  is  subject  to  the  capital  structure   embodied  by  the  investor  entity  i.e.  the  capital  contributed  by  its  debt  providers  (institutional  lenders)  and   equity  providers  (shareholders).  The  Aviation  industry  has  a  WACC  of  7%  (IATA  Financial  Forecast,  2012)   meaning  that  every  year,  the  sector  must  contribute  a  minimum  of  at  least  7%  of  its  earnings  to  meet  

  

20  

  
commitments  to  its  debt  providers  and  equity  holders.  Hence  7%  represents  the  benchmark  for  success  for   an  investment  made  by  the  aviation  industry  regardless  of  the  subject  of  investment  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,   2009).        The  second  element  needed  to  convert  a  future  CF  into  a  DCF  is  the  valuation  period  captured  by  `N'   representing  every  year  in  the  valuation  period.  It  is  vital  to  project  CFs  to  a  point  in  the  future  where  the   investment's  financial  performance  reaches  a  steady  state  signified  by  predictable  and  repeated  CFs.  For   mature  industries,  five  years  is  often  sufficient  to  allow  a  company  to  reach  its  steady  state.  However  for   businesses  in  sectors  with  long-term  contracted  revenue  streams  such  as  in  natural  resources,  satellite   communications,  or  utilities,  and  early  stage  innovations  like  the  algal  biofuel  pathway,  which  does  not  yet   have  a  clear  roadmap  to  commercialization,  it  is  more  appropriate  to  consider  a  longer-term  valuation  period   of  ten  years  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009).  Additionally,  ten  years  is  also  approximately  the  amount  of  time  the   IEA  estimates  algal  biofuels  technologies  will  take  to  evolve  from  pilot  and  demonstration  scale  projects  to   large-scale  commercial  farms  (IEA  2011).        The  last  two  elements  requisite  of  an  NPV  analysis  is  the  Upfront  Capital  Cost  (UCC)  and  the  Terminal  Value   (TV).  The  UCC  refers  to  the  capital  investment  made  to  put  `steel  in  the  ground'  or  to  buy,  build  and  develop   the  infrastructure  assets  (such  as  ponds,  pipelines,  buildings  etc.)  before  algal  cultivation  can  even  begin.  This   is  a  negative  CF  that  occurs  in  year  0  (Shiho  et  al,  2012;  Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009).  Because  it  is  also   infeasible  to  extrapolate  an  investment's  future  CFs  indefinitely,  a  TV  is  used  to  capture  the  value  of  the   investment  beyond  the  projection  period.  The  TV  is  critical  because  it  typically  accounts  for  a  substantial   portion  of  the  value  generated  by  an  investment  -  sometimes  as  much  as  75%  or  more.  TV  is  calculated  from   the  venture's  EBITDA  in  the  final  year  of  the  projection  period  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009).      iii)  The  formula  for  TV  (Fabozzi,  2009)  is:   TV  =  (10th  EBITDA)/DF       

5.2.1  EBITDA  Inputs     
The  following  sections  articulate  the  assumptions  and  justifications  used  to  determine  the  Cost  of  Production   (COP)  of  the  algal  oil,  the  Cost  of  Refining  (COR)  the  algal  oil  into  AJF,  the  revenue  stream  generated  from  the   sale  of  AJF,  and  finally  the  revenue  stream  generated  from  the  emissions  benefit  of  using  low  carbon  intensity   AJF.      i)  Cost  of  Production  (COP)   In  the  absence  of  large-scale  algal  biofuel  operations,  most  cost  estimations  for  per  unit  algal  oil  are  based  to   some  extent  on  productivity  and  financial  performance  of  non-fuel  specific  algal  cultivation  for  specialty  

  

21  

  
chemicals  such  as  betacarotene  and  other  non-oil  products.  These  facilities  are  not  optimized  for  oil   production  and  therefore  produce  relatively  little  feedstock  at  high  cost.  The  most  widely  recognized  cost   performance  model  of  a  hypothetical  commercial  algal  oil  production  facility  comes  from  a  seminal  report   authored  by  Benemann  and  Oswald  in  1996  (compiled  for  the  National  Energy  Technology  Laboratory   (NREL))  which  covers  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  research,  technologies,  commercial  applications,   and  economics  of  open  pond  algal  biomass  production  for  biodiesel  production.  Funded  by  the  US  DoE's   Aquatic  Species  Program,  Benemann  and  Oswald's  report  is  one  of  most  cited  references  on  cost  estimations   for  algae  cultivation  for  carbon  sequestration  and  has  become  the  cornerstone  for  a  lot  of  recent  cutting  edge   technoeconomic  modeling  (Sun  et  al,  2011).    Having  said  that,  there  is  also  a  wide  range  of  cost  estimations   reported  for  the  per  unit  cost  of  algal  oil  with  some  extremes  varying  by  up  to  two  orders  of   magnitude.    Table  1,  compiled  by  US  DoE's  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  (EERE),   highlights  the  multitude  of  assumptions  used  in  modeling  algal  oil  costs  (in  $/gallon)  using  open  ponds  and   photobioreactors  (alternative  novel  cultivation  technologies  that  are  much  newer  than  open  pond  cultivation   and  perform  even  less  competitively)  (Sun  et  al,  2011).       

   Table  1  -  US  DoE  EERE  evaluation  of  algae  technology.  Current  or  baseline  scenario  refers  to  the   estimated  productivity  and  oil  yield  in  2008  (Source:  Sun  et  al,  2011).      The  wide  disparity  in  reported  COP  naturally  makes  any  baseline  cost  assumptions  for  the  present  analysis   very  difficult.  To  overcome  this,  a  comprehensive  baseline  harmonization  study  published  by  the  Argonne   National  Laboratory  (ANL),  a  prominent  research  institution  at  the  forefront  of  algal  biofuel  research  and   modeling,  is  used  for  cost  estimations.  ANL  designed  the  study  with  the  goal  to  harmonize  existing  disparate   methodologies  for  COP  estimations  into  a  unified  model  that  is  consistent  and  verifiable.  ANL  normalized  the   differences  between  the  three  dominant  types  of  feasibility  studies  commonly  undertaken  in  the  algal  biofuel   arena  ­  Technoeconomic  Assessment  (TEA),  Lifecycle  Assessment  (LCA)  and  Resource  Allocation  (RA).  TEA,  

  

22  

  
LCA  and  RA  study  the  major  determinants  of  sustainable  algal  cultivation  for  fuel;  TEAs  elucidate  the   economic  performance  of  algal  production  regime  by  employing  a  particular  layout  of  technology  and  is   strongly  influenced  by  CAPEX  and  OPEX;  the  LCA  approach  is  concerned  primarily  with  operating  variables   such  as  yields,  material,  energy  or  emissions  input/output  inventories  which,  in  contrast  to  TEA,  scale  with   level  of  operations  (Argonne  National  Laboratory,  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratory,  National   Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,  2012);  the  RA  models  algae  productivity  and  the  associated  water  footprint   (ANL  et  al,  2012).        Prior  to  harmonization  the  TEA,  LCA  and  RA  models  differed  in  a  number  of  critical  parameters  including  the   oil  content  of  the  algal  strain,  the  productivity  (g/m2/day)  of  open  pond  system  and  facility  scales,  all  of  which   naturally  resulted  in  different  algal  oil  yields.  For  example,  the  LCA  assumed  a  farm  with  4700  hectare  (ha)  of   ponds,  RA  assumed  405  ha,  while  TEA  was  based  on  1955  ha  of  ponds.  In  contrast  the  harmonized  model  was   created  around  groupings  of  10  RA-based  405  ha  unit  farms  totaling  4050  hectares  of  total  pond  area  (4850   ha  total  facility  footprint,  including  all  processing  operations)  producing  a  maximum  of  39.31Million  Liter  per   Year  (MLY)  of  algal  oil.  Each  individual  pond  was  assumed  to  be  cultivating  algae  with  25%  oil  content,   producing  oil  at  a  density  of  920  kg/m3  and  have  a  productivity  of  25  g/m2/day  (ANL  et  al,  2012).  Site   selection  for  the  4850  ha  facility  was  guided  by  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratory's  (PNNL)  Biomass   Assessment  Tool  that  identified  suitable  land  areas  within  the  conterminous  United  States.  The  vast  majority   of  the  farm's  water  footprint  was  associated  with  making  up  for  evaporative  losses  from  the  ponds  with  a   small  amount  of  water  lost  with  sludge  from  the  Anaerobic  Digester  (AD)  (ANL  et  al,  2012).  Makeup  water   came  from  freshwater  resources;  5%  of  the  mean  annual  flow  for  each  underlying  watershed  was  drawn  for   algae  ponds  -  a  number  based  on  the  amount  of  water  that  the  US  Environmental  Protection  Agency  allows   power  plants  to  withdraw.  The  study  conceded  that  future  work  will  have  to  include  the  possibilities  of  using   saltwater  and  wastewater  as  growth  mediums  to  address  freshwater  scarcity  (ANL  et  al,  2012).      The  harmonization  study  considers  total  production  18.9  Billion  Liters  per  Year  (BLY)  coming  from  multiple   39.31  MLY  facilities  to  calculate  the  final  per  unit  algal  oil  COP.  The  18.9  BLY  quota  is  derived  from  the   minimum  volume  of  algal  biofuels  required  to  meet  the  36-billion-gallons-by-2022  EISA  mandate  for   advanced  biofuels.  However  the  final  COP  quoted  cannot  be  imported  directly  as  a  cost  input  for  the  NPV   calculation  for  two  reasons.  Firstly,  the  harmonization  model  assumes  that  all  algal  oil  produced  is  feedstock   for  the  production  of  biodiesel  for  road  transportation  only  and  not  aviation  fuel.  Secondly,  the  final  COP   value  is  a  result  of  producing  the  full  18.9  BLY,  offering  significant  scale  for  a  relatively  low  final  COP  (ANL  et   al,  2012).    The  first  limitation  is  circumvented  by  considering  the  COP  for  the  algal  oil  and  not  the  final  end- use  product  (biodiesel)  since  raw  algal  oil  is  feedstock  for  both  biodiesel  and  AJF.  The  second  limitation  is   overcome  by  the  fact  that  although  it  is  assumed  that  all  the  algal  oil  required  to  meet  the  18.9  BLY  EISA   quota  is  produced,  only  one  39.31  MLY  facility  is  used  as  the  subject  of  the  NPV  valuation  i.e.  sufficient   numbers  of  investors  own  enough  facilities  to  produce  all  18.9  BLY,  the  aviation  industry  is  one  such  investor  

  

23  

  
committing  to  one  39.31  MLY  facility.  In  this  way,  it  will  be  valid  to  the  use  the  harmonized  algal  oil  COP  for   the  NPV  calculation.        The  algal  oil  COP  is  $2.25/l.  This  is  the  manufacturing  price  for  algal  oil  accounting  for  the  CAPEX  and  OPEX,   and  not  the  Minimum  Selling  Price  (MSP)  that  normally  includes  a  markup  of  a  10%  profit  (ANL  et  al,  2012).     The  COP  is  used  instead  of  the  MSP  to  avoid  speculation  of  what  the  profit  margin  of  the  final  product  will  be.   The  COP  represents  the  lowest  NPV  that  can  be  expected  from  producing  algal  oil  at  a  facility;  a  MSP  at   whatever  level  will  only  increase  the  NPV  valuation.          The  final  figure  extracted  from  the  harmonization  study  is  the  UCC.  The  total  upfront  investment  required  for   every  39.31  MLY  facility  inclusive  of  CAPEX  and  OPEX  is    $947.30  million.  As  indicated,  this  is  a  negative  CF   item  that  occurs  at  the  time  of  construction  in  year  0  to  allow  algal  oil  to  be  produced  from  year  1  (ANL  et  al,   2012).        iii)  Cost  of  Refining  (COR)   COR  represents  the  costs  incurred  to  convert  the  raw  algal  oil  feedstock  to  AJF  using  hydroprocessing.    The   costs  for  hydroprocessing  is  derived  from  a  MIT  modeling  study  that  assessed  the  per  unit  cost  of  Biologically   derived  Synthetic  Paraffinic  Kerosenes  (Bio-SPKs)  derived  from  soybeans,  a  HEFA  analogue  that  can  simulate   the  cost  performance  expected  from  algal  oil  refining.  Vegetable  oils  including  algal  oil  contain  relatively   short-chained  hydrocarbons  that  can  be  readily  broken  to  shorter  diesel  range  molecules.  As  Figure  4  shows,   since  jetfuel  hydrocarbons  are  smaller,  refiners  can  choose  to  produce  more  jetfuel  by  breaking  the  diesel   chains  down  to  the  jet  range,  allowing  the  flexibility  to  vary  production  to  match  the  market  demands  for   diesel  or  jetfuel.  MIT's  model  refined  HEFA  Jetfuel  Price    (JFP)  under  two  scenarios  (i)  maximum  distillate   (diesel)  production,  and  (ii)  maximum  jet  production  (Pearlson  et  al,  2013).  In  reality,  because  longer  diesel   range  products  have  higher  market  value  compared  to  jetfuel  derivatives,  refiners  tend  to  always  produce   some  diesel  range  product  even  under  the  maximum  jet  fuel  production  scenario  (Pearlson  et  al,  2013).

   Figure  4  -  Typical  Distillation  Ranges  (Degrees  C)  and  Carbon-Number  Ranges  for  Fuels  (Source:  RAND,   2009).   For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  ideal  maximum  jetfuel  scenario  is  chosen  in  conjunction  with  the  most   optimal  CAPEX  and  OPEX  parameters  for  a  new  HEFA  refining  facility.  The  model  biorefinery  is  a  378  MLY   facility  (largest  facility  option  to  allow  for  economies  of  scale)  built  on  brownfields  (discarded  industrial  land   or  deactivated  refineries  with  already  built  infrastructure),  and  uses  hydrogen  bought  from  a  third  party  (to   spare  CAPEX  from  building  hydrogen  generating  infrastructure).  The  final  COR  is  $0.34/liter  (Pearlson  et  al,   2013).   The  summation  of  COP  and  COR,  total  of  $2.59/l,  is  the  cost  incurred  by  the  producer  (investor)  to  cultivate,   harvest,  extract  and  refine  the  algae  biomass  into  AJF  and$2.59/l  is  the  value  that  is  used  to  calculate  the  total   cost  of  producing  at  steady  rate  of  39.31  MLY  for  the  ten-year  valuation  period.            iv)  Revenue  from  AJF     The  main  source  of  revenue  and  positive  CF  is  the  revenue  generated  from  the  sale  of  the  refined  end  product   AJF.    AJF  is  a  drop-in  fuel  that  is  fully  substitutable  with  conventional  PJF  and  can  therefore  be  expected  to   fetch  the  full  price  of  its  fossil  fuel  counterpart  (Boeing,  2009).    As  of  February  2013,  the  average  Jetfuel  Price   (JFP)  for  2013  reported  by  the  IATA  was  $132.80/barrel  (IATA,  Feb  2013)  translating  to  $0.84/l.  It  is   assumed  that  all  39.31  million  liters  produced  at  a  steady  rate  each  year  for  the  ten-year  valuation  period  is   sold  at  $0.84/l.

v)  Revenue  from  Emission  Benefit     Since  AJF  is  posited  as  a  sustainable  alternative  to  PJF,  its  proponents  seek  at  a  minimum  to  ensure  that  the   overall  AJF  value  chain  leads  to  carbon  neutrality  (CO2e)  compared  to  PJF  (Grierson  &  Strezov,  2012)).  This   study  is  premised  on  the  assumption  that  AJF  in  providing  significant  CO2e  savings,  can  also  provide   monetary  savings  if  AJF  is  produced  and  consumed  in  a  jurisdiction  where  a  carbon  tax  is  applicable.  Because   PJF  combustion  releases  far  more  lifecycle  CO2  for  every  unit  of  energy  extracted  from  it,  a  carbon  tax  will   signal  a  monetary  incentive  for  aviation  to  opt  for  AJF  instead  of  PJF  to  avoid  the  emission  penalty.  For  the   purpose  of  a  NPV  analysis,  the  emissions  savings  is  treated  as  a  positive  cash  flow.            The  LCA  data  for  AJF  is  leveraged  to  establish  its  lifecycle  emissions  balance.  LCA  is  a  tool  within  the   broad  discipline  of  lifecycle  management,  an  approach  commonly  used  as  a  means  to  benchmark  and   compare  designs,  processes  and  systems,  with  a  view  to  continuous  improvement  around  set  criterion.  Based   on  standardized  methods  published  by  the  International  Standards  Organization,  it  can  provide  valuable   insight  into  the  aggregate  efficiency  and  impact  of  discrete  energy  and  material  flows  that  are  relevant  to   processing  and  manufacture  of  a  product  across  its  various  lifecycle  stages  (Grierson  &  Strezov,  2012)).  While   TEAs  primarily  address  the  economic  feasibility  of  the  process  overall,  LCAs  depending  on  the  input/outputs   may  or  may  not  be  used  to  describe  the  environmental  impacts  of  a  product  or  process;  LCA  is  based  on   relevant  assumptions  of  productivity,  as  well  as  material  and  energy  flows  (Grierson  &  Strezov,  2012)).          A  LCA  of  aviation  fuel  using  CO2  equivalent  (CO2e)  flows  is  called  a  Well-To-Wake  (WTWa)  assessment.  As   illustrated  in  Figure  5,  a  WTWa  encompasses  two  stages.  In  the  first  step,  the  Well-to-Pump  (WTP)  emissions   of  CO2,  methane  (CH4),  and  Nitrous  Oxide  (N2O)  associated  with  delivering  1  Mega  Joule  (MJ)  of  energy  to  the   fuel  tank  of  an  aircraft  is  measured.  Included  in  WTP  accounting  are  emissions  associated  with  obtaining  the   raw  fuel  (extracting  crude  oil  or  cultivating  and  harvesting  biomass),  transporting  it,  processing  the  raw   fuel  to  jetfuel,  and  delivering  the  jetfuel  to  aircraft  fuel  tanks.  Estimated  emissions  of  CH4  and  N2O  are   converted  to  CO2  equivalents  using  their  relative  global-warming  potential  (RAND,  2009).  In  the  second  stage,   the  Pump-To-Wheel  or  in  the  case  of  aviation  Pump-To-Wake  (PTWa),  accounts  for  the  amount  of  CO2   released  during  the  combustion  of  1  MJ  equivalent  of  fuel  in  the  aircraft  turbine  engines.  Calculating  CO2   combustion  emissions  is  straightforward  and  depends  only  on  the  chemical  composition  of  the  fuel  (chemical   integrity  of  jetfuel  is  highly  standardized),  allowing  easy  estimation  of  how  much  more  or  less  CO2e  emission   is  released  with  the  production  and  consumption  of  1  MJ  of  the  AJF  as  compared  to  PJF  (RAND,  2009).

   Figure  5  -  WTP,  PTW,  WTW  Definitions  for  Algae  Biofuel  (Source:  ANL,  Dec  2011).      LCAs  identify  environmental  risks  or  `hotspots'  within  a  products'  lifecycle  to  guide  benchmarking  and   communication  of  performance  parameters  more  credibly  by  virtue  of  offering  a  common  verifiable   methodology  by  which  footprints  of  different  products,  systems  or  processes  can  be  effectively  compared  to   their  relevant  alternatives  (Grierson  &  Strezov,  2012)).  Having  said  that,  LCA  models  can  also  vary  widely  in   their  underlying  assumptions  and  boundary  conditions  which  creates  discrepancies  in  the  overall  balance  for   the  metric  being  measured.  The  production  of  algal  biofuels  present  further  complications  for  LCA   benchmarking  due  to  the  multitude  of  possible  production  schematics  and  process  options  (ANL,  Dec  2011)   currently  being  employed.  Adequately  assessing  the  energy  and  emission  flows  of  the  algal  oil  production   stage  is  difficult  in  the  absence  of  commercial  operations  making  lab  scale  data  the  only  source  to  extrapolate   the  environmental  impact  of  industrial  scale  production  of  AJF.  Algal  cultivation,  harvest  and  process   technologies  for  fuel  derivatives  are  mostly  immature  leaving  most  studies  presenting  only  a  prospective  LCA,   even  more  so  for  a  hypothetical  facility  (Grierson  &  Strezov,  2012)).  And  even  amongst  these  studies,  the  LCA   models  vary  in  their  considerations  for  emission  flows  associated  with  building  infrastructure   (manufacturing  and  transport  of  concrete,  pipes,  equipment  etc.)  and/or  recycling  of  growth  nutrients  for   algal  cultivation.  The  task  of  capturing  all  energy  or  emission  flows  across  all  material  supply  chains  is   naturally  daunting,  therefore  necessitating  boundary  conditions  under  which  the  energy  or  emission   transactions  can  be  counted.  Due  to  the  current  lack  of  an  universal  methodology  for  emissions  accounting,   models  built  in  isolation  inadvertently  differ  in  overall  emission  balance.            The  need  for  an  universal  LCA  framework  to  quantify  the  environmental  impact  of  advanced  biofuels  has   given  rise  to  one  specific  model  that  has  been  valorized  by  both  the  aviation  industry  and  academia  as  the   standard  for  transportation  fuels  and  vehicle  systems.  The  Greenhouse  Gases,  Regulated  Emissions  and   Energy  use  in  Transportation  (GREET)  is  employed  to  elucidate  the  lifecycle  balance  of  PJF  and  AJF  in  this   study.

Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation (GREET)   GREET  is  a  publicly  available  LCA  tool  to  consistently  examine  lifecycle  energy  and  emissions  flows  in  over  85   vehicle  systems  (including  gasoline,  diesel,  plug-in  hybrid,  battery-powered,  fuel-cell  vehicles  etc.)  and  fuel   systems  (including  gasoline,  diesel,  hydrogen,  natural  gas-based  fuels,  electricity,  etc.).  GREET  measures   emissions  impact  by  recording  CO2,  CH4,  and  N2O  transactions  as  well  as  common  criteria  pollutant  emissions   (VOC,  CO,  NOx,  SOx,  PM2.5,  and  PM10).  It  was  designed  in  partnership  with  prominent  government  research   institutions  like  the  NREL  and  PNNL,  US  DoE  and  US  EPA,  industry  stakeholders  (energy  companies,  biofuels   producers,  technology  developers,  vehicle  manufacturers)  and  NGOs  (ARGONNE  APRIL  2011).  The  tool  has   been  instrumental  in  developing  key  federal  renewable  energy  policies  such  as  US  EPA's  Renewable  Fuels   Standard  2  (RFS  2),  California  Air  Resources  Board's  Low  Carbon  Fuel  Standard  (CARB  LCFS),  and  is  regularly   cited  in  congressional  testimonies  and  reports  encompassing  GHG  impact  of  transportation.  In  each  of  these   cases,  GREET  was  used  to  weigh  biofuel  technology  options,  improve  process  energy  efficiencies  to  achieve   low  carbon  footprint  and  steer  educated  public  debate  around  biofuel  technologies  and  policies  (ARGONNE   APRIL  2011).        GREET  addresses  the  major  challenge  faced  by  other  LCA  methodologies  by  bringing  together  multiple   process  scenarios  differing  in  species  selection,  cultivation,  intermediate  constituents,  conversion  processes   as  well  as  end-use  fuels  and  markets.  GREET  effectively  harmonizes  data  collection,  boundary  definition   and/or  assessment  methods  that  otherwise  vary  due  to  the  lack  of  an  universal  methodology  (Grierson  &   Strezov,  2012)).            The  GREET  platform  applied  to  AJF  consists  of  two  interconnected  excel  sheets.    The  Algal  Process   Description  (APD)  defines  the  overall  boundary  for  the  production  process  pathway  (Figure  6)  and  describes   the  intermediate  technologies  used  for  cultivation,  harvest  and  extraction  as  well  as  their  performance   efficiencies.  As  Figure  7  illustrates,  the  default  production  schematic  uses  open  cultivation,  DAF  and   centrifuge  to  harvest  and  dewater  biomass  respectively,  followed  by  mechanical  grinding  and  solvent   (hexane)  treatment  to  extract  the  desired  algal  oil.  APD  also  accounts  for  direct  energy  inputs  (and  associated   emissions)  required  by  the  core  technologies,  the  peripheral  equipment  such  as  the  pumps  and  blowers   delivering  CO2  to  the  ponds,  and  the  main  power  source  for  the  facility.  The  overall  emissions  balance  of  the   production  pathway  and  the  facility  is  intimately  tied  to  the  nutrient  balance  and  the  fate  of  the  Lipid   Extracted  Algae  (LEA)  biomass.  The  default  APD  pathway  passes  the  LEA  into  an  Anaerobic  Digester  (AD)   that  produces  biogas  to  generate  electricity  downstream  for  the  facility,  while  combustion  CO2  is  recycles   back  into  the  cultivation  ponds  to  feed  new  biomass.  Concurrently,  AD  residue  containing  vital  nitrogen  and   phosphorus  nutrients  are  also  passed  into  the  cultivation  ponds  to  drive  the  growth  of  newer  batches  of  algae.   Recycling  of  nutrients  and  generating  electricity  on-site  mitigates  the  emission  footprint  of  the  algal  oil   production  facility  as  less  power  is  drawn  from  the  grid  (which  may  or  may  not  be  produced  from  carbon  

  

28  

  
intensive  fossil  fuels)  and  less  energy  is  expensed  to  manufacture  growth  limiting  nutrients  from  fossil  fuel   derived  fertilizer  (ANL,  Dec  2011).

Once  all  process  assumptions  are  plugged  in,  the  emission  balance  calculated  by  APD  is  exported  into  the   main  GREET  platform  which  models  the  emission  balance  for  transport  of  the  algal  oil,  and  refining  of  the   feedstock  to  AJF  and  it's  distribution  (ANL,  2012).  The  aviation  module  in  GREET  consists  of  detailed   characterization  of  WTP,  PTWa  and  WTWa  pathways.  The  aviation  module  integrates  jetfuel  production   processes  from  various  feedstock  sources  into  a  single  spreadsheet.  For  jetfuel  derived  from  fossil  fuels  and   biomass  feedstock  other  than  algae,  the  upstream  processes  --petroleum  recovery  and  transportation  for  PJF,   coal  mining  or  natural  gas  recovery,  processing  for  FT  jetfuel  or  biologically  derived  oil  production  from  plant   or  algal  feedstocks  --  are  in  their  original  respective  spreadsheets  within  GREET.  The  different  aircraft   classes,  their  operational  characteristics,  and  the  properties  of  conventional  and  alternative  jetfuels  are   incorporated  into  the  `Jetfuel  PTWa'  sheet.  The  overall  LCA  results  recording  energy  use  and  emissions   results  for  various  blends  of  PJF  (with  other  jetfuel  sources)  are  reported  in  the  third  `Jetfuel  WTWa'   spreadsheet.  Since  2011,  ASTM  approved  HEFA  jetfuels  derived  from  vegetable  oils  in  a  50:50  blend  with  PJF,   a  standard  that  is  followed  in  this  study  (ANL,  2012).        Figure  8  shows  the  contribution  of  WTP  and  PTWa  stages  to  CO2  equivalent  emissions  per  MJ  of  alternative   jetfuel  sources  including  unconventional  fossil  fuel  sources  like  oil  sands  and  shale  oil.  Naturally  the  WTP   stage  for  all  bio-derived  jetfuel  pathways  appears  on  the  negative  side  of  the  GHG  emissions  scale  owing  to   the  atmospheric  CO2  absorbed  by  photosynthesis  during  the  biomass  growth  phase.  However,  the  CO2   sequestered  during  biomass  growth  is  negated  by  emissions  released  during  biomass  farming,  collection,   fertilizer  application  and  hydrogen  production  needed  for  fuel  upgrading.  The  carbon  sequestered  in  the   biomass  is  transferred  to  the  fuel  after  the  conversion  step  and  returns  to  the  atmosphere  with  the  exhaust   stream  during  fuel  combustion  in  the  aircraft  engine  (ANL,  2012).    The  AJF  WTWa  lifecycle  emission  balance   is  25  gCO2e/MJ  while  crude  oil  derived  PJF  WTWa  emission  balance  is  significantly  higher  at  87.5  gCO2e/MJ   (ANL,  2012)  because  of  its  dominating  PTW  emissions  of  73.2  gCO2/MJ  (RAND,  2009).   It  is  important  to  note  that  in  order  to  manage  the  complexity  of  a  comprehensive  LCA  and  limit  it's  scope  and   establish  verifiable  results,  infrastructure-related  activities  are  not  included  in  the  GREET  boundary   assumptions  (ANL,  2012).

   5.2.2  Monetizing  LCA  Emission  Using  BC'S  Carbon  Tax     
Upon  determining  the  appropriate  LCA  data,  the  final  input  for  NPV  analysis  is  derived  from  converting  the   GREET  value  into  a  revenue  item.  BC's  carbon  tax  is  employed  to  emulate  a  real  life  policy  based  carbon  price.   The  carbon  tax  rate  is  currently  at  its  highest  rate  of  $30/tCO2e.  This  is  the  emission  penalty  that  the  aviation   industry  will  incur  through  consumption  of  jetfuel.    As  mentioned,  because  of  the  potentially  lower  lifecycle   emissions  posed  by  AJF  in  contrast  to  PJF,  there  is  a  real  financial  incentive  for  the  aviation  industry  to   embrace  to  AJF  in  order  to  save  costs.  The  monetized  algal  emission  benefit  is  the  difference  between  PJF   emission  and  AJF  emission  times  the  carbon  tax.       

5.3  NPV  CALCULATION     
The  NPV  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  all  DCFs  over  ten  years  including  the  TV  and  UCC  (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009).          i)  In  other  words  NPV  =  Sum  of  DCFs  (in  ten  years)  +  UCC  +  TV   NPV  can  be  a  positive,  negative  or  neutral  value  depending  on  the  economic  potential  or  profitability  of  the   investment  venture.  A  positive  NPV  indicates  that  the  investment  assessed  can  be  expected  to  provide  a  

  

31  

  
financial  return  that  not  only  covers  the  liabilities  (to  lenders  and  equity  holders)  but  provides  a  surplus;  the   magnitude  of  the  positive  NPV  is  proportional  to  the  level  of  profitability.  Similarly,  a  negative  NPV  indicates   that  any  investment  made  in  the  project  may  not  only  be  lost,  but  will  likely  incur  further  losses  if  any  capital   injected  to  keep  the  project  running.  Lastly,  a  neutral  or  zero  NPV  value  indicates  that  the  investment   opportunity  does  not  provide  any  positive  or  negative  incentive  for  the  investors  to  commit  financially   (Rosenbaum  &  Pearl,  2009).  Although  the  magnitude  of  the  negative  NPV  indicates  the  extent  to  which  the   project  will  lose  money,  realistically  investors  are  unlikely  to  financially  commit  to  any  opportunity  that  has  a   NPV  equal  or  lower  than  zero.

6.  DISCUSSSION       
6.1  BASELINE  ASSESSMENT     
The  NPV  analysis  is  undertaken  by  first  determining  net  revenue  generated  per  year,  subtracting  all  costs   from  net  revenues,  and  finally  calculating  the  total  DCF  accounting  for  UCC  and  TV.    There  are  two  key   assumptions  associated  with  the  hypothetical  AJF  production  facility  in  question,  namely  that  the  facility   reaches  peak  operational  capacity  (maximum  oil  production)  by  year  1  and,  the  facility  generates  the  same   algal  oil  output  year  after  year  i.e.  the  only  difference  in  the  net  DCF  generated  year  on  year  is  caused  by  the   DF.  This  simplified  deterministic  model  is  reflective  of  other  valuation  studies  of  hypothetical  algal  oil   production  facilities  (Shiho  et  al,  2012).  In  reality  production  capacity  both  in  the  amount  of  algal  oil   produced  and  the  refining  capacity  needed  to  accommodate  the  volume  of  algal  oil  produced  is  likely  to  be   ramped  up  gradually  within  1-3  years  (Shiho  et  al,  2012).  Additionally,  the  algal  oil  production  capacity  is   likely  to  be  subject  to  operational  (maintenance,  effect  of  weather,  contamination  etc.)  and  market   perturbations  (production  level  will  follow  demand)  which  will  result  in  inconsistent  yearly  DCFs.          Under  the  baseline  conditions  (Table  1A)  built  on  the  current  state  of  algal  biofuel  technology  the  NPV   analysis  results  in  a  value  of  -2350.30  (Table  1B)  implying  that  not  only  will  investment  made  in  the  baseline   AJF  production  value  chain  be  lost,  the  investor  is  likely  to  lose  a  further  $2,350.30  million-  the  initial   investment  over  the  lifetime  of  the  project.  The  primary  reason  for  this  is  that  under  the  baseline  scenario  i)   the  COP  for  AJF  is  high  at  $2.59/l  compared  to  the  much  lower  PJF  COP  at  $0.84/l  giving    rise  to  negative   revenue  streams  throughout  the  ten  years,  and  ii)  the  very  negative  TV  at  -$940.57  million  and  UCC  of  - $947.30  million.  TV  and  UCC  are  each  about  40%  of  the  NPV  value  which  signifies  their  dominance  in  the  final   NPV.     Due  to  the  negative  NPV  value,  under  baseline  technology  state  and  policy  condition,  it  can  be  safely  deduced   that  the  current  AJF  regime  and  low  PJF  price  does  not  allow  for  profitable  operation  of  AJF  production.  In   order  to  investigate  the  influence  of  the  key  EBITDA  elements,  a  sensitivity  analysis  is  undertaken  to   determine  the  conditions  under  which  AJF  can  be  produced  economically.

Jetfuel  Price  ($/l)  

  

One  of  the  primary  motivations  for  the  aviation  industry  to  divert  its  dependency  from  PJF  is  due  to  high  price   volatility  of  PJF.  PJF  is  sold  at  a  price  premium  to  crude  oil  prices.  In  2012  the  aviation  industry  paid  about   $200  billion  in  fuel  bills  -  almost  30%  of  total  operating  costs  paid  by  the  industry  every  year  (IATA,  2012).   Sustainable  non-fossil  jetfuel  produced  from  readily  available  biomass  on  the  other  hand  offer  the  industry   much  needed  reprieve  in  terms  of  supply  and  price  security.  As  crude  oil  prices  rise,  biofuels  become   increasingly  attractive  as  a  tool  to  manage  rising  operating  costs.  Similarly  it  is  widely  accepted  that  rising  oil   prices  also  create  a  demand  stimulus  which  translate  into  positive  financial  performance  for  alternative   energy  companies  (Henriques  &  Sadorsky,  2008).    Oil  prices  have  continually  increased  in  recent  years,   quadrupling  from  2000  to  2010  and  will  continue  to  rise  posing  a  direct  threat  to  JFP  (Taylor  et  al,  2013).        The  baseline  scenario  uses  2013  JFP  to  establish  the  profitability  of  AJF  produced  from  a  hypothetical  algal  oil   facility.  Given  the  augmenting  effect  of  rising  oil  prices  on  the  economic  feasibility  of  competing  RETs,  it   becomes  a  necessary  exercise  to  forecast  the  profitability  of  such  a  facility  as  affected  by  changing  JFP  (Table   2B).  Graph  1  illustrates  the  positive  correlation  between  NPV  and  JFP  as  rising  JFP  directly  augments  the   revenue  streams  from  the  sale  of  the  product.  The  line  curve  intersects  with  the  NPV  axis  at  $3.20/l   representing  the  Discounted  Breakeven  Price  (DBP).  This  mirrors  the  argument  posited  by  Galagher's  2011   study  which  highlighted  the  huge  returns  possible  for  algal  biofuel  producers  if  real  crude  oil  prices  were  to   rise  significantly  higher  than  $100  per  barrel  or  $0.84/liter  (Galagher,  2011).  Under  rising  oil  prices,  the  algal  

  

35  

  
oil  COP  is  increasing  insensitive  to  loss  of  government  subsidies  and  increases  in  CAPEX  and/or  OPEX  as  high   profit  margins  from  sale  of  AJF  compensates  for  any  other  externally  mediated  CF  perturbations  (Galagher,   2011).        An  important  point  to  note  is  that  a  JFP  increase  from  baseline  to  $1/l  and  $1.50/l  shows  a  negligible  impact   on  NPV,  in  contrast  to  doubling  of  JFP  from  $1.50/l  to  $3/l  and  onwards.  But  $3/l  also  translates  to  $381.44   per  barrel.  Considering  that  IEA  and  the  US  EIA  forecasts  indicate  a  rising  trend  for  oil  prices  with  broad   consensus  on  a  future  oil  price  in  the  range  of  US$100  between  2015  and  2020,  increasing  to  US$160  per   barrel  by  2050  (CSIRO,  2011),  $381.44/l  maybe  be  considered  an  unrealistic  price  instigator  for  the   commercialization  of  AJF.  Nevertheless,  such  extrapolation  does  offer  insight  into  the  expected  performance   of  AJF  technology  and  hints  at  producers  to  focus  on  non-market  factors  such  as  those  inherent  to  the  core   algal  oil  technology  to  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  AJF  in  the  near  term.

CO2  Tax  ($/tCO2e)  

  

The  carbon  tax  adds  a  premium  to  the  cost  of  both  AJF  and  PJF  but  because  PJF  imposes  a  significantly  larger   lifecycle  CO2  footprint,  airline  operators  using  PJF  will  incur  a  larger  emission  penalty.  AJF  offers  a  lifecycle   emission  benefit  of  62.5  gCO2e/MJ  fuel  consumed,  which  depending  on  the  level  of  carbon  tax  applied,  can   offer  producers  and  consumers  a  substantial  financial  reprieve.  Therefore  a  rising  carbon  tax  level  is  expected   to  make  investment  prospects  for  alternative  energy  technologies  such  as  AJF  more  attractive  as  higher   profitable  returns  can  be  expected  from  growing  market  adoption.  This  expectation  is  validated  by  the   positive  correlation  between  carbon  tax  levels  and  NPV  shown  in  Graph  2.  The  initial  rise  of  carbon  tax  levels   from  $30/tCO2e  to  $200/tCO2e  has  a  minimal  impact  on  NPV  and  in  fact  keeps  NPV  in  the  negative.  In   contrast,  when  the  carbon  tax  doubles  from  $400/tCO2e  to  $800/  tCO2e,  the  NPV  value  also  doubles   approximately  from  -1575.07  to  -736.98  (Table  3B).  The  DBP  ­  where  NPV  is  0  -  is  about  $1150/  tCO2e;  when   carbon  tax  is  at  any  level  above  this  point,  revenues  generated  from  AJF  emissions  benefit  greatly   compensates  for  the  very  high  AJF  COP.        It  is  important  to  note  here  that,  as  with  the  JFP  scenario,  extrapolation  of  carbon  tax  to  extreme  levels  of   $2000/  tCO2e  may  not  be  practical  because  of  the  uncertainty  with  which  the  industry  will  respond  to  the   heightened  tax  and  how  demand  for  aviation  will  shift.  Higher  carbon  prices  may  lower  the  demand  for  air   travel  as  airlines  eventually  pass  on  the  extra  costs  to  passengers;  lower  price  scenarios  such  as  the  $US  50/

tCO2e  level  set  by  the  European  Unions  Emission  Trading  Scheme  (EU  ETS)  have  shown  minimal  impact  on   both  demand  and  emissions  in  modeling  scenarios.  The  industry  is  usually  able  to  absorb  higher  carbon   prices  after  the  initial  period  of  shock  where  profitability  suffers  from  the  implementation  of  the  tax.    As   observed  in  2008  when  crude  oil  prices  doubled,  airlines  tried  to  grapple  with  higher  fuel  prices  by  absorbing   rising  costs,  leading  to  bankruptcies  of  almost  twenty  smaller  airlines  while  the  larger  players  announced   reductions  in  their  capacity  and  mergers.  After  a  few  years  the  industry  redounded  as  airlines  shed  capacity   and  consolidated  to  be  able  to  charge  higher  fares  (Bonnefoy,  2011).  Higher  carbon  taxes  are  expected  to   elicit  similar  responses.  But  even  the  models  used  to  arrive  at  this  conclusion  only  assume  a  carbon  tax  of   $200/  tCO2e  to  be  the  maximum  tax  level  that  can  be  practically  applied  without  instigating  the  detrimental   economic  effects  of  making  energy  too  expensive  for  economic  activity  (Bonnefoy,  2011).  Similarly  Timilsina   et  al  concluded  that  on  a  global  basis  a  carbon  tax  of  $100-$150  in  absence  of  other  subsidies  is  the  highest   tax  level  that  can  push  market  penetration  of  biofuels  without  causing  a  significant  loss  in  economic  output   (Timilsina  et  al,  2011).                The  carbon  tax  versus  NPV  trend  suggests  that  unless  carbon  tax  is  at  an  unrealistically  high  level,  it  will  not   impact  the  economic  feasibility  of  the  investment  in  any  positive  way,  that  is  to  say  carbon  tax  alone,  although   can  be  a  source  of  revenue,  cannot  make  AJF  profitable  to  produce.  Therefore  economically  feasible   production  of  AJF  will  once  again  have  to  rest  on  vast  improvements  in  elements  of  the  core  technology  and   not  on  external  policy  conditions  to  push  market  adoption.

   Individual  trend  lines  for  carbon  tax  levels  and  JFP  versus  NPV  shown  previously  in  Graph  1  and  2,  indicate   that  these  factors  alone  will  not  bring  about  a  positive  impact  on  the  economic  feasibility  of  AJF  unless   applied  at  unrealistically  high  levels.  However  since  both  carbon  tax  and  JFP  factor  into  the  NPV  calculation  as   revenue  items,  the  combined  effect  of  rising  JFP  variation  in  the  presence  of  rising  carbon  tax  levels  can  be   investigated  with  the  justification  being  that,  both  policy  conditions  and  crude  oil  prices  can  shift   simultaneously  albeit  not  necessarily  to  the  same  degree.        The  baseline  assessment  shows  that  JFP  at  $0.84/l  and  carbon  tax  at  $30/tCO2e,  the  DBP  occurs  at  about   $1160/tCO2e.  (Graph  3)  However  if  JFP  rises  to  $1/l,  the  DBP  shifts  slightly  to  $1100/tCO2e;  at  $1.50/l   breakeven  occurs  at  $900/tCO2e;  and  finally  when  JFP  is  $3/l  ($476.28  per  barrel)  the  DBP  falls  to   $300/tCO2e.  This  overall  trend  of  falling  DBP  is  expected  as  rising  JFP  contributes  a  larger  revenue  stream   into  the  NPV  calculation  and  because  the  total  amount  of  AJF  production  capacity  is  static  year  after  year,  the   NPV  depends  less  on  the  revenue  contribution  of  AJF  emission  benefit.  Effectively  this  means  that  under   rising  JFP,  investors  will  rely  less  on  external  policy  conditions  to  inspire  investment  in  AJF  production.

The  yield  of  algal  oil  from  a  production  facility  is  a  function  of  two  variables  -  the  %  by  weight  cellular  content   of  oil  (characteristic  of  the  algal  strain  cultivated)  and  pond  productivity  which  captures  the  mass  of  algal  oil   produced  per  unit  area  of  pond  per  day.    Since  a  higher  yield  of  algal  oil  allows  economies  of  scale  by   distributing  the  CAPEX  and  OPEX  over  large  volume  of  end  product  ultimately  pushing  down  COP,  higher   yield  is  an  obvious  objective  for  any  algal  oil  production  facility  looking  at  a  higher  profit  margin.  However  as   discussed,  the  actual  degree  to  which  a  particular  production  scheme  impacts  economies  of  scale  is  unclear  in   the  absence  of  any  fuel  specific  commercial  algal  cultivation.  In  2008,  an  audit  of  twelve  different  sources  of   algal  oil  COP  reflected  a  50-fold  difference  in  the  range  of  estimations  reported.  The  disparity  arose  mainly   from  differences  in  algae  growth  assumptions,  different  cultivation  systems,  and  baseline  economic   investment  terms  (Sun  et  al,  2011).  Sustaining  algal  oil  yield  in  an  outdoor  environment  is  very  difficult  and   yet  oil  yield  exhibits  tremendous  influence  over  LCA  and  TEA  results  particularly  at  baseline  oil  content  and   productivity  levels;  small  changes  at  lower  oil  content  and  productivity  levels  lead  to  large  shifts  in  price,   energy  consumption,  and  emissions  (ANL  et  al,  2012).        The  three  growth  scenarios  picked  for  this  part  of  the  assessment  represents  both  conventional  performance   as  well  as  short  and  long-term  strain  improvements  (selection  of  algal  strains  with  higher  oil  content)  and   optimized  pond  configuration  (providing  higher  productivity).  The  simulations  were  adopted  from  Davis  et  al   (Davis  et  al,  2011),  a  seminal  study  that  formed  the  foundation  of  the  NREL  harmonization  exercise.    The   growth  scenarios  are  positioned  from  low  or  baseline  growth  (data  point  1  ­  25%  oil  content  and  13.2   g/m2/day  productivity)  simulated  in  most  economic  assessments  of  algal  biofuels,  medium  growth  (data   point  2  ­  50%  oil  content  and  40  g/m2/day)  scenario  representing  yield  improvements  consequent  of   optimization  in  the  short  term,  and  high  growth  scenario  (data  point  3  ­  60%  oil  content  and  60  g/m2/day)   signifying  the  theoretical  maximum  achievable  yield  possible  in  the  long  term  based  on  current  technology   trajectory  (Table  5B).    As  evident  from  the  Graph  4,  there  is  a  negative  relationship  between  algal  oil  yield  and   NPV  ­  the  better  the  growth  scenario  the  more  negative  the  NPV.  In  this  case,  AJF  is  not  economically  feasible   to  produce  regardless  of  the  algal  oil  yield  suggesting  that,  holding  all  other  factors  constant,  no   improvements  in  the  biological  and  operational  parameters  will  lead  to  profitable  outcomes  for  the   investment  being  contemplated.  At  first  look  this  is  counter  intuitive  as  increasing  algal  yield  should  capture   economies  of  scale,  reduce  COP  and  thus  lead  to  more  profitable  production  of  AJF  (Shiho  et  al,  2012).  To  a   certain  extent  this  is  indeed  the  case  looking  at  the  growth  scenarios  concerned,  the  COP  of  AJF  does  go  down   from  $2.59/l,  to  $1.45/l  and  finally  to  $1.24/l  in  the  medium  and  high  growth  scenarios  respectively.   However,  because  even  the  lowest  AJF  COP  is  still  higher  than  baseline  JFP  of  $0.84/l,  AJF  production  under   the  present  scenario  conditions  will  incur  loses  regardless  of  the  algal  oil  yield,  in  fact  the  losses  will  stack  up   higher  at  higher  yields  because  more  biomass  will  be  sold  at  a  loss.          Algal  biomass  cultivation  is  inherently  different  from  cultivation  of  1st  generation  feedstock.  Algal  oil  COP   does  not  appear  to  exhibit  a  strong  correlation  with  production  volume  due  to  the  dilute  nature  of  the  algal  

  

42  

  
suspension.  This  makes  it  difficult  to  capture  economies  of  scale  simply  by  ramping  up  cultivation  capacity.  As   cultivation  volume  increases  so  does  the  need  for  capital  investment  in  adjacent  processing  capacity   inadvertently  preventing  dilution  of  CAPEX  and  impeding  economies  of  scale  (Sun  et  al,  2011).  The  total   system  throughput  for  a  39.31  MLY  algal  oil  production  facility,  due  to  the  high  dilution  factor,  is  significantly   higher  than  39.31  MLY  of  raw  algal  suspension;  the  baseline  facility  flow  rate  is  higher  than  the  largest   wastewater  treatment  plants  in  the  US.  Therefore,  pursuing  economies  of  scale  through  volume  capacity   exclusively  may  only  serve  a  limited  advantage  in  reducing  COP  at  commercial  scale  operations  (this  could   change  as  underlying  processing  sub-technologies  are  tailored  specifically  to  algal  fuel  derivatives  (Davis  et  al,   2011).        Additionally,  algal  oil  content  also  impacts  COP  more  strongly  than  productivity  does.  In  open  ponds,  when  oil   content  is  either  doubled  or  halved,  the  associated  net  cost  impact  is  twice  as  that  elicited  by  a  similar   adjustment  in  productivity.  This  is  because  increasing  the  productivity  merely  shrinks  the  size  of  the  growth   system  required  relative  to  the  amount  of  algal  biomass  being  grown,  whereas  an  increase  in  oil  content   actually  altogether  decreases  the  amount  of  algal  biomass  throughput  that  must  be  processed  to  attain  oil   production  targets,  thereby  instigating  reduction  in  all  downstream  processing  costs    (Davis  et  al,  2011).          Finally,  the  cost  improvement  from  baseline  to  medium  growth  scenario  is  substantially  larger  than  the  cost   improvement  from  the  medium  to  high  growth  scenario.  This  reflects  likely  realistic  outcomes  as  medium   growth  parameters  are  practically  achievable,  while  the  high  growth  parameters  by  virtue  of  being  the   theoretical  maximum  will  be  much  more  difficult  to  reach  (Sun  et  al,  2011).  It  is  important  to  note  that  the   high  growth  scenario  in  this  case  merely  represents  the  maximum  oil  content  and  productivity  achievable   within  the  context  of  the  baseline  configuration  and  it's  associated  assumptions.  Thus,  while  the  contingent   COPs  may  hint  at  future  cost  ranges,  it  does  not  mean  that  they  are  the  absolute  lowest  COPs  attainable.  It  is   possible  that  numerous  yet  unforeseen  process  options  and  technological  advancements  in  the  future  will   push  down  COP  further  (Davis  et  al,  2011).

   Attempting  to  commercialize  AJF  under  the  baseline  JFP  is  futile  as  even  the  lowest  possible  COP  leads  to  a   very  negative  NPV.  This  brings  to  question  how  the  commercialization  scenario  for  AJF  changes  under   increasing  JFP,  a  trend  that  is  inevitable  as  upward  shifts  in  crude  oil  prices  are  prompted  by  shrinking  supply.     However  when  enhanced  growth  scenarios  are  assessed  under  shifting  JFP  as  in  Graph  5,  all  growth  scenarios   now  present  at  least  some  positive  return-on-investment  potential.  The  trend  lines  grow  increasingly  steeper   as  oil  content  and  productivity  rise;  for  any  JFP,  the  corresponding  NPV  is  highest  for  high  growth  scenario,   followed  by  medium  growth  and  baseline  growth  scenario.  The  high  growth  scenario,  presenting  the   theoretical  maximum  algal  oil  yield,  captures  large  economies  of  scale  and  becomes  profitable  at  any  JFP   above  the  DBP  of  $1.30/liter.  Similarly,  the  medium  growth  scenario  becomes  profitable  at  any  JFP  above   $1.40/liter  and  low  growth  scenario  above  $3/liter;  the  difference  in  DBP  between  medium  and  low  growth   scenario  is  significant  because  COP  falls  from  $2.59/liter  to  $1.45/liter  -  a  cost  improvement  of  44%  -   triggered  by  a  corresponding  jump  in  oil  content  and  productivity  from  25%  to  50%  and  13.2  g/m2/day  to  40

This  margin  is  much  lower  for  the  jump  between  medium  and  high  growth  scenario   due  to  the  lower  boost  in  yield  performance,  jumping  from  50%  oil  content  and  40  g/m2day,  to  60%  oil   content  and  60  g/m2day  which  corresponds  to  a  cost  reduction  from  $1.45/liter  to  $0.90/liter  (cost   improvement  of  38%).

CO2  Tax  ($/tCO2e)  

  

   The  revenue  generated  from  carbon  tax  mediated  emission  benefit  is  small  and  therefore  exudes  minor   influence  on  the  overall  NPV  relative  to  the  primary  revenue  stream  generated  from  the  sale  of  AJF.  As   evident  from  Graph  2,  carbon  tax  has  minimal  impact  on  NPV  unless  the  tax  rate  is  unrealistically  high.   However  as  the  algal  biofuel  technology  develops  manifesting  in  higher  yield,  it  is  worthwhile  to  know  how  a   changing  carbon  tax  regime  can  impact  the  commercialization  potential  of  AJF.

   Graph  6  illustrates  the  relationship  between  growth  scenario  and  carbon  tax  levels  versus  NPV  levels,  which   resemble  the  relationship,  illustrated  in  Graph  5.  This  is  because  at  low  algal  oil  yield,  the  monetized  emission   benefit  as  a  proportion  of  total  revenue,  is  larger  than  the  proportion  under  equivalent  carbon  tax  levels  at   higher  growth  scenarios  i.e.  for  the  same  carbon  tax  level,  more  revenue  comes  from  the  sale  of  AJF  at  higher   yields  than  revenue  from  emissions  benefit.  For  example,  below  $140/tCO2e,  NPV  for  the  low  growth  scenario   is  higher  for  every  carbon  tax  level  than  corresponding  NPVs  under  medium  and  high  growth  scenarios.   Above    $200/tCO2e,  the  carbon  tax  is  high  enough  making  the  emissions  benefit  sufficient  to  garner  a  growing   proportion  of  the  net  revenue,  eventually  generating  a  high  net  positive  revenue  stream  for  a  positive  NPV  (at   least  under  high  growth  scenario).        The  greater  the  volume  of  AJF  produced,  the  greater  the  emissions  avoided  through  the  displacement  of  PJF.   Following  from  this  it  is  obvious  that  at  low  algal  oil  yield,  carbon  tax  will  be  required  at  much  higher  levels   than  at  medium  and  high  growth  scenarios  to  elicit  a  positive  NPV.  This  is  indeed  the  case.  The  low  growth   scenario  has  a  DBP  of  $1150/tCO2e  compared  to  $300/tCO2e  and  $200/tCO2e  under  medium  and  high  growth   scenarios  respectively  indicating  that,  when  all  other  factors  are  constant,  a  carbon  tax  regime  can  perhaps   enhance  the  commercialization  potential  of  AJF  only  if  drastic  technology  advancements  can  push  oil  content   and  productivity  levels  to  the  medium  growth  scenario,  a  possibility  that  is  attainable  in  the  short  term   through  heavy  investment  and  focus  on  R&D.

7.  RECOMMENDATIONS  
   The  world  is  facing  converging  challenges  in  maintaining  energy  security  and  managing  the  threat  of  runaway   GHG  emissions.  Biofuels  offer  promise  as  a  response  to  both  of  these  critical  issues.  Biofuel  research  activity   peaked  during  the  oil  crises  of  the  1970s  and  has  until  the  last  decade  or  so  fluctuated  with  the  oil  price.   Recent  crude  oil  price  volatility  and  heightened  awareness  of  climate  change  related  impacts  has  ushered  a   renaissance  of  interest  in  sustainable  fuels.  Traditional  food-based  biofuels  have  seen  incredible  growth  in   the  last  decade  pushed  largely  by  sustainability  and  energy  security  policy  goals.  But  developed  in  a  narrow   window  of  time  and  opportunity,  the  propagation  for  1st  generation  biofuels  have  come  at  substantial   environmental  and  social  costs.  Yet  the  strong  imperative  to  deliver  effective  energy  solutions  still  exist  and   call  for  integrated  R&D  and  policy  formulations  across  all  the  diverse  sectors  constituting  a  biofuel  value   chain  is  more  urgent  than  ever  before  (O'Connell  &  Haritos,  2010).  The  aviation  industry  is  at  the  forefront  of   this  call,  recognizing  that  advanced  non-food  based  biofuels  provide  a  means  to  generate  low  resource   intensive  and  regionally  produced  jetfuel  that  can  stabilize  price  volatility  and  reach  emissions  targets,  both   of  which  are  vital  for  the  industry's  continuing  growth  in  the  coming  decades.        AJF  has  the  potential  to  meet  all  or  a  significant  portion  of  the  fuel  needs  in  the  sector  by  virtue  of  high  algal   productivity,  substantially  lower  demand  for  agricultural  inputs  compared  to  1st  generation  biofuel  pathways,   and  an  ability  to  assimilate  multiple  waste  streams  as  part  of  the  algal  growth  cycle.  But  in  order  to  offer  real   reprieve  to  aviation,  AJF  has  to  be  produced  at  a  large  enough  scale,  offer  substantial  emissions  benefit  (at  the   minimum  to  make  AJF  carbon  neutral),  and  at  a  price  that  is  competitive  with  PJF.  AJF  is  still  far  from   achieving  commercial  competency  in  any  of  these  areas.     As  demonstrated  in  this  study,  an  investment  made  today  in  a  hypothetical  AJF  value  chain,  under  baseline  or   current  state  of  technology,  will  not  yield  a  profitable  outcome  which  is  the  only  outcome  that  can  valorize   the  investment  decision.  This  study  investigates  the  impact  of  factors  inherent  to  a  conventional  algal  oil   production  schematic  and  the  influence  of  external  factors  like  JFP  and  carbon  tax  on  the  profitability  of  AJF   production.  JFP  and  carbon  tax  in  isolation  can  bring  about  the  desired  positive  NPV  albeit  to  various  degrees,   but  only  at  levels  that  are  unrealistically  high.    In  the  case  of  enhancing  algal  oil  yield  in  isolation,  even  the   theoretical  maximum  algal  yield  cannot  generate  an  AJF  COP  lower  than  the  current  baseline  JFP.  This   indicates  that  any  improvement  in  the  core  technology  parameters  can  be  justified  only  under  a  JFP  that  is   higher  than  the  lowest  theoretical  AJF  COP  possible;  a  carbon  tax  will  contribute  marginal  revenue  thereby   making  the  overall  investment  scenario  more  attractive.  The  sensitivity  analysis  further  reveals  the  affect  of   interacting  factors  on  the  overall  economic  feasibility  and  commercialization  potential  of  AJF.  Particularly   interesting  here  is  the  combined  impact  of  elevating  carbon  tax  levels  and  enhanced  growth  scenarios  versus   NPV,  as  well  as  elevating  JFP  and  enhanced  growth  scenarios  versus  NPV.  These  two  combinatorial  forecasts   provide  valuable  insights  into  the  technological  (including  the  technoeconomic  and  lifecycle  performance  of  

  

49  

  
AJF  production)  and  policy  context  requisite  to  the  profitable  operation  of  an  AJF  value  chain.  The  following   sections  elaborate  on  the  most  effective  strategies,  derivative  of  the  NPV  analysis,  aiming  to  highlight   opportunities  and  ultimately  guide  R&D  scientists,  technology  developers,  industry  stakeholders  and  policy   makers.  The  following  section  outlines  two  sets  of  recommendations  in  technological,  and  policy.       

7.1.CORE  TECHNOLOGY       
7.1.1  Raise  CAPEX  Efficiency  
   Algae  oil  production  systems  are  a  complex  composite  of  sub-  technologies  in  production,  harvesting,   extraction,  drying  systems  etc.  Optimal  integration  and  utilization  of  process  steps  is  essential  to   operating  easier,  better,  and  lower  cost  systems  (Singh  &  Gu,  2010).  One  of  the  most  efficient   applications  of  capital  in  the  production  pathway  comes  from  `squeezing'  as  much  product  out  of  a   system  as  possible  to  achieve  economies  of  scale.  Because  feedstock  price  can  often  account  for  up  to   40%  of  final  COP  of  advanced  biofuels,  and  (in  the  context  of  this  study)  the  excess  refinery  capacity   downstream  (300  MLY  capacity  accommodating  only  39.31  MLY  algal  oil),  the  prime  target  to  apply   CAPEX  and  OPEX  efficiency  measures  is  at  the  algal  oil  production  process.    However,  unlike  1st   generation  biofuels,  the  production  capacity  in  algae  farms  cannot  be  ramped  up  simply  by  cultivating   more  algae  per  unit  of  pond  (Singh  &  Gu,  2010).  The  profitability  of  small  farms  is  naturally  quite  low   due  to  the  high  UCC  relative  to  the  low  oil  yield;  profitability  can  rise  rapidly  with  increased  size  but   soon  stabilizes  suggesting  the  poor  scalability  of  currently  implemented  harvest  and  process   technologies  (Stephens  et  al,  2010)  -  a  case  particularly  true  of  farms  smaller  than  200  ha  (Singh  &  Gu,   2010).  This  is  because  algae  grow  at  highly  dilute  concentrations  and  simply  growing  more  algae   requires  an  equivalent  ramp  up  in  processing  capacity  which  inadvertently  prevents  the  `dilution'  of   CAPEX.        The  primary  instigator  of  AJF  commercialization  will  come  from  cultivating  `fatter'  and  `faster'  algal   strains.  Advanced  genetic  manipulation  techniques  that  enable  selective  `fine-tuning'  of  the  DNA  of   potential  high-yield  strains  can  optimize  the  delivery  of  desired  oil  types  (Schenk  et  al  2008).  Algae   biofuel  producers  have  to  identify  high-oil  algal  species  that  can  generate  bio-crude  for  drop-in  fuels  in   the  quantities  and  price  points  needed.  Most  algal  strains  used  today  have  only  25%  oil  content  (used  in   baseline  scenario)  but  targeted  R&D  can  facilitate  leaps  in  oil  yield  in  the  short  term,  engineering   common  algal  strains  to  constitute  50%  oil  (medium  growth  scenario),  and  eventually  even  higher   composition  at  the  theoretical  maximum  level  of  60%  (high  growth  scenario)  in  the  long  term  (Davis  et   al,  2011).  Algal  oil  producers  using  fatter  algae  with  60%  oil  content  can  benefit  substantially  from  the   significant  CAPEX  and  OPEX  reductions  compared  to  using  species  with  baseline  performance  (Singh  &  

  

50  

  
Gu,  2010).  Advances  in  biotechnology  can  also  simplify  or  cut  short  process  steps  all  together.  For   example,  Origin  Oil  combines  harvest  and  extraction  steps  by  engineering  algal  cells  as  mini-refineries  in   a  process  referred  to  as  `milking  the  algae'  whereby  the  algae  excretes  hydrocarbon  fuels  directly  into   the  growth  medium  (Singh  &  Gu,  2010).  Arizona  State  University  took  this  approach  a  step  further  by   creating  a  blue­green  algae  that  directly  excretes  a  type  of  kerosene  jetfuel  into  the  growth  medium   thereby  bypassing  the  harvest,  extraction  and  refining  systems  all  together  (Singh  &  Gu,  2010).   Additionally,  due  to  the  differences  in  the  biochemical  pathways  in  multi-cellular  terrestrial  plants  and   unicellular  algae  with  respect  to  quality  and  quantity  of  the  oil  synthesized  during  nutrient  deprivation   (Packer  2009),  a  database  mapping  the  chemical  composition  of  oils  associated  with  various  algal  strains   along  with  the  requisite  process  conditions  (such  as  factors  influencing  the  interaction  and  extraction  of   oil  using  solvents)  can  become  a  critical  asset  to  algal  biotechnologists  (Greenwell  2011).        Enhanced  economic  performance  can  also  be  attained  from  better  process  design  and  modeling  tailored   specifically  to  algal  cultivation  for  fuel  derivatives.  Current  near-term  cost  estimates  for  harvest  and   extraction  technologies  are  borrowed  largely  from  technologies  applied  in  the  wastewater  treatment.   Newer  harvesting  technologies  like  electrocoagulation  adopted  from  agricultural  practices  used  instead   of  conventional  flocculants,  can  provide  a  50%  capital  cost  reduction  compared  to  the  baseline   configuration.  But  by  and  large,  novel  process  technologies  are  yet  to  be  developed  and  implemented.  In   their  absence,  it  is  useful  to  understand  the  cost-cutting  potential  of  generic  measures  to  identify   realistic  improvements  that  can  translate  to  overall  economic  benefits  for  algal  oil  production  in  the   short-term  (ANL  et  al,  2012).        Like  most  RETs,  algal  oil  COP  is  largely  driven  by  CAPEX  rather  than  OPEX  (Sun  et  al,  2011),  a  fact  that  is   particularly  true  at  the  low  baseline  productivity  of  13.2  g/m2/day  (ANL  et  al,  2012).  As  Figure  9  shows,   amongst  the  various  CAPEX  contributors,  the  pond  liner  is  substantial,  comprising  up  to  60%  of  the  total   installed  CAPEX  while  providing  very  limited  utilization  at  baseline  performance.  When  productivity   increases  the  relative  cost  contributions  of  pond  liners  and  fixed  operating  cost  will  dilute  relative  to   other  cost  allocations.  But  this  requires  optimal  algal  strain  development  (ANL  et  al,  2012).  Until  R&D   advancements  allows  for  this,  pond  liner  cost  can  be  reduced  through  fundamental  redesign  of  pond   systems  or  relaxing  land  grading  and  excavation  requirements  for  building  algal  farms;  in  combination   these  two  activities  can  potentially  reduce  CAPEX  by  up  to  30%.      Alternatively  liners  can  be  removed   altogether.  Liners  are  traditionally  used  to  reduce  leakage  (both  water  consumption  and  contamination   issue)  and  manage  high  circulation  costs  characteristic  of  unlined  ponds.  However  liners  are  not  a   technical  requirement  for  pond  operability  if  the  host  soil  characteristics  are  satisfactory  (for  example  in   term  of  adequate  soil  compaction,  clay  composition  and  infiltration  of  worm  holes);  removing  liners  may   limit  algal  farms  to  certain  topographical  profiles,  but  the  option  may  still  be  worth  pursuing  for   candidate  areas  given  that  removing  liners  can  cut  CAPEX  by  45-55%  (ANL  et  al,  2012).

Although  it  is  beyond  the  immediate  reach  of  this  study,  it  is  worth  noting  that  there  is  a  2nd  popular,   albeit  even  more  nascent,  cultivation  technology  currently  being  explored  in  laboratory  and  pilot   settings.  The  modular  technology  called  Photobioreactors  (PBRs)  comprises  a  light  permeable  artificially   illuminated  algal  culture  reactor,  a  gas  exchange  system  that  feeds  CO2  and  removes  photosynthetic  O2   (toxic  to  algae),  and  a  harvesting  system  that  concentrates  the  algae  for  downstream  processing   (Knoshaug  2011).    In  contrast  to  open  ponds,  PBRs,  being  closed  systems,  negate  issues  of  evaporation   and  contamination  by  broader  species  of  algae,  as  well  as  allowing  integration  of  real-time  control  over   ambient  conditions  and  biological  inputs  (Knoshaug  2011)  that  ultimately  manifests  in  substantially   larger  biomass  yields  per  unit  volume  of  water  than  open  pond  cultivation.        Having  said  that,  currently  the  very  high  PBR  material  and  energy  input  costs  (to  cool  the  naturally   illuminated  systems  and  moderate  culture  condition  in  real  time)  are  a  major  impediment  to  taking   advantage  of  the  CAPEX  efficiency  benefits  that  could  otherwise  be  experienced  from  the  easily  scalable   modular  technology  (Knoshaug  2011).  But  as  R&D  continues,  as  it  is  in  open  pond  cultivation,  efficient   reactor  designs  (that  can  maximize  light  penetration  and  mixing  by  sheltering  algal  cells  from  photo- degradation  brought  about  by  over  exposure)  will  facilitate  higher  photosynthetic  activity  (Schenk  et  al   2008)  and  consequently  larger  productivity.  Additionally,  hybrid  systems  incorporating  characteristics   of  both  open  and  closed  systems  are  also  being  investigated.    Under  such  schemes,  algae  "are  grown   continuously  in  PBRs  under  nutrient  sufficient  conditions  and  then  a  portion  is  transferred  to  nutrient   limited  open  ponds  to  induce  oil  production.  Enough  nutrients  are  transferred  with  the  inoculum  for  the   culture  to  grow  for  1  day,  and  after  3  days  when  lipid  production  has  peaked,  open  ponds  are  harvested,   cleaned  and  re-inoculated"  (Schenk  et  al  2008,  pg.  22).    

   7.1.2  Raise  OPEX  Efficiency    
OPEX  factors  play  a  relatively  minor  role  in  influencing  the  economics  of  AJF  production  in  contrast  to  the   dominating  role  of  CAPEX  factors  in  establishing  the  final  COP.  The  NREL  harmonization  study  notes  the  low   sensitivity  of  a  handful  of  operational  parameters  that  marginally  impact  total  OPEX  (but  not  the  overall   project  cost),  highlighting  opportunities  to  further  lower  fixed  operating  costs  which  constitute  roughly  60%   of  the  baseline  OPEX  (ANL  et  al,  2012).  As  Figure  9  illustrates,  the  main  non-technology  determinant  of   operational  efficiency  is  the  number  of  operational  days  per  year  the  algal  oil  production  facility  is  expected   to  be  functional.  In  the  baseline  scenario,  the  facility  operates  330  days/year  after  accommodating  pond   crashes  and  other  maintenance  `down  time'.  If  the  factor  is  decreased  to  250  days/year  -  as  can  occur  due  to   pond  freezes,  increased  pond  crashed  and  re-inoculation,  etc.  -  the  loss  in  production  yield  raises  price   substantially  i.e.  when  algal  oil  is  used  as  feedstock  for  biodiesel  instead  of  jetfuel,  a  250  days/year   operational  schedule  adds  up  to  $1.40/l  to  the  biodiesel  COP.  This  reiterates  the  importance  of  a  robust  algal

strain,  building  the  facility  where  freezing  and  culture  contamination  is  minimal  (ANL  et  al,  2012).        Nutrient  cycle  is  another  crucial  operational  factor.  From  a  cost  standpoint,  an  AD  utilizes  spent  biomass  to   recycle  nutrient  in  addition  to  generating  methane  gas  for  onsite  power  generation  via  a  Combined  Heat-and- Power  process.  The  nutrient  cost  is  considerable  but  not  as  highly  impactful  on  the  overall  OPEX  as  evident  by   its  mediocre  cost  sensitivity  to  change  in  nutrient  recycle  rates  (ANL  et  al,  2012).        It  is  worth  noting  here  that  despite  freshwater  being  the  baseline  growth  medium,  OPEX  shows  low   sensitivity  to  water  consumption  as  varying  evaporative  water  losses  in  orders  of  magnitude  corresponds  to   only  trivial  cost  impacts.  Furthermore  the  cost  impact  observed  the  consequence  of  merely  adding  a  water   blowdown  stream  -  to  manage  increasing  salinity  in  growth  ponds  due  to  evaporation  ­  which  leads  to  loss  of   algal  biomass  that  could  otherwise  be  processed  downstream.        While  assumptions  on  water  recycling  and  evaporation  rate  do  not  appear  to  show  a  notable  cost  sensitivity,   it  is  important  to  iterate  the  underlying  assumption  that  freshwater  does  incur  a  cost  beyond  the  capital  and   power  expenses  for  pumping  it  from  underground  reservoirs.  However  in  the  event  that  the  regional  water   demand  rose  or  algal  farms  have  to  purchase  water  from  a  utility,  the  cost  impact  would  be  noticeably  higher   ­  by  as  much  as  $0.26/l  of  freshwater  according  to  one  estimate  (Davis  et  al,  2011).  The  baseline  scenario   assumes  the  algal  oil  facility  is  built  in  a  geographical  location  with  enough  groundwater  resources    to  supply   both  the  domestic  demands  of  the  region  and  the  algal  farm  while  preserving  the  reservoir  though  natural   replenishment.  Of  course  the  use  of  freshwater  does  bring  to  light  the  obvious  sustainability  concerns  of   industrial  scale  consumption  and  the  entailing  restriction  placed  on  potential  algal  cultivation  farms  by   regional  variability  in  consumption  patterns,  weather  and  water  availability  (ANL  et  al,  2012).    Even  if  large   variations  in  the  water  balance  parameters  show  low-cost  sensitivity,  the  impact  of  industrial  extraction  on   local  water  resources  will  be  much  more  dramatic  and  raise  the  issue  of  sustainability  (Davis  et  al,  2011).  The   NREL  concedes  that  future  studies  will  need  to  investigate  the  feasibility  of  algal  cultivation  using  seawater  or   brackish  water  to  limit  the  sustainability  impact  (ANL  et  al,  2012).

7.1.3  Raise  Life  Cycle  Performance  
   One  of  the  primary  objectives  of  this  study  is  to  investigate  the  commercialization  potential  of  AJF  from  a  LCA   perspective  and  explore  whether  a  carbon  price  framework  can  motivate  investors  to  commit  capital  in  the   AJF  value  chain  that  is  not  currently  profitable  to  invest  in.  Not  surprisingly  there  is  a  correlation  between   rising  carbon  tax  levels  and  attractiveness  of  investment  in  AJF  but  the  desired  commercialization  effect  is   elicited  only  at  tax  levels  greater  than  $1160/tCO2e.  Researchers  and  producers  can  augment  the   commercialization  potential  of  AJF  at  more  practical  carbon  tax  levels  by  targeting  lower  life  cycle  emissions   profiles  so  as  to  maximize  the  emissions  benefit  of  AJF  over  PJF.          The  LCA  of  AJF  constitutes  two  stages,  the  WTP  stage  encompassing  the  emission  transactions  during  the  AJF   production,  and  the  PTWa  stage  capturing  the  emissions  released  during  combustion  of  the  fuel  in  the  aircraft.   The  WTP  stage  is  the  carbon  negative  stage  as  the  algae  sequesters  atmospheric  CO2  during  its  growth  phase.   Although  subsequent  processing  steps  require  energy  and  nutrient  consumption  that  discount  some  of  the   captured  carbon  credits,  GREET  analysis  indicates  that  the  sequestration  stage  is  generally  strong  enough  to   maintain  a  net  WTP  emissions  negative  balance.  Conversely  the  PTWa  stage  is  net  carbon  positive  releasing   the  CO2  sequestered  in  the  algal  oil  back  into  the  atmosphere.  This  combustion  stage  is  penalized  by  a  carbon   tax;  technical  improvements  in  engine  manufacturing  and  advanced  aircraft  designs  can  mitigate  the   emissions  profile  of  the  fuel  consumed  to  a  certain  extent  but  the  large  proportion  of  emissions  reduction  can

be  expected  from  improvements  in  the  WTP  stage  specifically  in  the  algal  oil  production  regime.          WTP  Stage   Similar  to  enhancing  capital  efficiency,  developing  optimal  algal  strains  can  aid  in  AJF  emission  reduction.  A   low  resource  intensive  strain  will  relieve  the  emissions  load  of  nutrient  manufacture  and  operational  loads  of   transport;  in  fact  once  strains  capable  of  converting  waste  and  recycled  streams  directly  into  excreted  fuels   are  developed,  lifecycle  emissions  will  fall  dramatically.  But  until  R&D  can  facilitate  this  transition,  there  are  a   number  of  areas  researchers  and  producers  can  aim  for  in  the  short-term.          The  NREL  harmonization  study  proposes  a  number  of  system  configurations  to  minimize  the  loss  of  carbon   sequestered  during  the  algal  growth  phase.    The  first  is  to  lower  the  paddlewheel  power  consumption;  pond   mixing  to  maintain  algal  suspension  accounts  for  much  for  the  operational  power  requirements  of  the  algal   oil  production  facility,  which  depending  on  the  source  of  electricity  generation  can  entail  an  emissions   footprint.  As  with  much  of  the  process  schematic,  the  paddlewheel  design  and  performance  data  is  borrowed   from  non-fuel  related  commercial  algal  operations  that  does  not  prioritize  emissions  as  an  important   performance  criterion.  The  baseline  harmonized  model  assumes  a  power  consumption  of  45  KWh/ha/day   but  newer  alternative  pond-paddle  configurations  combined  with  optimized  paddle  designs  can  potentially   reduce  consumption  by  up  to  84%  (ANL  et  al,  2012).  Secondly  more  robust  standards  and  technology   utilization  can  reduce  methane  leakage  from  AD  by  ten  fold  if  standards  common  to  the  natural  gas  industry   are  embraced.  Methane,  the  main  constitute  of  biogas,  has  very  high  global  warming  potential  and   exacerbates  the  carbon  cost  of  AJF.  The  baseline  model  assumes  fugitive  emissions  of  2%  instead  of  targeting   leakage  below  0.2%  (as  in  the  natural  gas  industry).    One  avenue  to  ameliorate  process  design  to  reflect   better  performance  is  through  replacement  of  the  AD  with  Catalytic  Hydrothermal  Gasification  (CHG),  a   catalytic  wet  process  that  converts  the  carbon  and  nitrogen  in  organic  materials  to  methane  and  ammonia.    A   CHG  unit  "is  compact,  fast  and  hermetic,  while  AD  requires  large  volume  and  long  residence  times.    It  is   plausible  that  this  technology  will  lower  fugitive  emissions  rate  to  0.2%  while  offering  a  90%  recovery  rate   for  both  nitrogen  and  phosphorus"  (ANL  et  al,  2012,  pg.  54).  Lastly,  the  baseline  scenario  assumed  that  the   net  CO2  given  off  by  the  CHP  process  (powers  facility  by  combusting  natural  gas  produced  from  AD)  is  cycled   back  to  the  growth  ponds  to  supplement  carbon  content  in  the  growth  medium.  However  because  the  CHP   flue  gas  comprises  very  low  CO2  concentration  at  high  temperatures,  a  large  amount  of  energy  is  required  to   spar  sufficient  volumes  of  flue  gas  into  the  growth  ponds  as  well  as  to  overcome  the  dilapidating  effect  the   elevated  flue  gas  temperature  has  on  blower  efficiency  (ANL  et  al,  2012).    Alternatively,  the  flue  gas  can  be   discarded  all  together  but  unless  equivalent  emissions  savings  are  generated  in  other  areas  of  the  production   regime,  the  option  will  have  negative  consequences  on  lifecycle  emissions  balance  (ANL  et  al,  2012).      It  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  under  the  baseline  algal  oil  production  regime,  there  is  an  inadvertent  

  

55  

  
tradeoff  between  the  lifecycle  and  technoeconomic  performance  due  to  counteracting  forces  prevalent  during   the  winter  season.  Algal  productivity  is  poor  (3-6  g/m2/day)  during  the  colder  months  when  solar  incidence   is  low  which  pushes  up  COP  of  algal  oil  and  consequently  the  per  unit  seasonal  GHG  emissions;  in  the  case  of   algal  biodiesel,  the  winter  GHG  per  unit  fuel  can  exceed  lifecycle  emission  from  petroleum  diesel.  To  reach  a   more  acceptable  lifecycle  performance  necessitates  the  facility  be  shut  down  during  low  productivity  months.   However  modeling  for  a  winter  shut  down  scenario  highlights  opposing  pressures  to  keep  the  facility  running   as  long  as  the  ponds  do  not  freeze.  This  is  because  the  variable  operating  cost,  by  definition  the  only  costs   which  vary  throughout  the  production  cycle,  represents  a  relatively  small  fraction  of  the  final  COP  -  roughly   11%.  The  small  saving  does  not  outweigh  the  cost  of  idling  expensive  capital  assets  and  the  revenue  lost  from   absence  of  product  sales  during  this  time.  A  possible  remedy  to  this  conundrum  can  be  attained  from   continuing  focused  R&D.  Even  a  modest  increase  from  baseline  oil  fraction  from  25%  to  30%  by  weight  can   improve  system  stability  substantially  and  alleviate  counteracting  LCA  and  TEA  pressures.  Alternatively,   facilities  can  switch  production  modes  towards  co-products  during  anticipated  periods  of  low  productivity  to   facilitate  sequestration  of  carbon  into  a  wider  portfolio  of  products.  Additionally,  the  LCA  and   technoeconomic  performance  may  become  easier  to  consolidate  if  and  when  a  carbon  price  integrates   emissions  cost  into  the  TEA    (ANL  et  al,  2012).     

7.1.4  Generate  Coproducts  
   Co-products  from  AJF  production  will  play  a  critical  role  in  its  commercialization  because  of  the  diverse   portfolio  of  intermediate  coproducts  possible.    Algal  biomass  like  other  plant  biomass  is  a  complex  mixture  of   cellulose,  hemicellulose,  starch,  lignin  as  well  as  lipids  and  proteins  but  the  complex  mixture  can  be  separated   into  distinct  high  value  product  streams  by  removing  inhibitors  and  contaminants  that  interfere  with   downstream  processing,  (O'Connell  &  Haritos,  2010).  Coproducts  can  provide  additional  revenue  sources  as   well  as  mitigate  emissions  by  directing  the  sequestered  carbon  in  the  algal  biomass  to  other  non-combustible   carbonaceous  compounds  i.e.  distribution  across  diverse  product  platforms  displaces  compounds  that  would   otherwise  be  manufactured  from  fossil  fuel  or  virgin  materials.  Algal  oil  processing  gives  rise  to  a  number  of   valuable  commodities  such  as  nutraceuticals,  pharmaceuticals,  cosmetics,  and  animal  feed  along  with  a  slew   of  low  value  intermediates  (Taylor  et  al,  2013).  Many  of  these  coproducts  can  be  sold  in  existing  markets.  For   example  lignin  derived  as  a  byproduct  of  2nd  generation  feedstock  processing  is  used  as  a  dispersant,  filler   and  dust  binder  for  road  materials  (Taylor  et  al,  2013).      It  is  a  common  practice  in  current  commercial  non-fuel  algal  operations  to  sell  the  Lipid  Extracted  Algae   (LEA)  to  animal/fish  feed  markets  (feed  prices  can  be  as  high  as  $350/ton)  instead  of  passing  the  residual   biomass  into  an  AD  for  biogas.  This  may  not  be  a  straightforward  option  for  algal  cultivation  for  fuel  for  a   number  of  reasons.  Redirecting  LEA  from  AD  incurs  an  obvious  loss  in  carbon  credits  and  unless  equal  

  

56  

  
savings  are  captured  somewhere  else  in  the  process,  the  overall  LCA  balance  will  be  affected.  Secondly,  the   wide  price  range  of  animal/fish  feed  will  make  it  difficult  to  project  the  revenue  stream  expected  from  the   sale  of  the  coproducts  and  therefore  despite  the  lucrative  feed  market,  the  potential  returns  may  not  be   obvious.  Lastly,  tweaking  process  steps  to  generate  animal/fish  feed  along  with  algal  oil  will  place  process   limitations  upstream  in  the  algal  oil  production  pathway.  For  example,  the  use  of  alum  or  other  inorganic   flocculants  during  the  dewatering  stage  opens  scope  for  flocculant  contamination  of  the  final  dewatered  LEA   biomass.  The  present  baseline  algal  oil  production  schematic  uses  chitosan  as  a  flocculant  for  its   biodegradability  under  anaerobic  digestion.  Chitosan  might  relieve  toxicity  concerns  if  animal/fish  feed  were   to  be  produced  but  using  it  will  require  extensive  validation  from  feeding  trials  before  feed  market  adoption   can  occur  (ANL  et  al,  2012).  Furthermore  in  order  to  avoid  contamination  from  solvent  aided  extraction,  algal   biomass  will  have  to  undergo  mechanical  grinding  and  gravity  assisted  separation  to  produce  pure  byproduct   stream  (Taylor  et  al,  2013).  A  possible  production  schematic  can  include  a  natural  gas  heated  drum  dryer   instead  of  an  AD  to  dry  the  LEA  material  prior  to  shipment  to  feed  market  but  once  again,  removing  the  AD   will  negatively  affect  the  lifecycle  emission  balance  by  preclusion  of  nutrient  recycling,  onsite  energy   production,  emissions  from  methane  leakage  and  low  dryer  efficiency  (ANL  et  al,  2012).        A  critical  benefit  imparted  by  coproducts  that  is  often  overlooked  in  TEA  literature  stems  from  the  fact  that   unlike  sectors  like  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  where  composition  of  matter  patents  are  premium  drivers  of   a  company's  valuation  or  profitability,  biofuel  producers  are  unable  to  capitalize  on  any  patentable  product   due  to  strict  and  uniform  end-use  standards  that  all  fuel  products  must  meet.  Instead  industrial-scale  biofuel   manufacturing  companies  rely  on  novel  processes  that  can  efficiently  convert  accessible  feedstock  into  fuels.   "These  companies  compete  on  price,  and  thus  on  incremental  innovation,  manufacturing  learning  curves,  cost   of  goods  sold  and  logistic  networks  including  robust  supply  chains  of  primary  raw  materials.  The  competition   for  marketing  such  commodity  chemicals  is  severe,  as  it  includes  not  only  biofuels  manufactured  in  countries   with  operational  cost  advantages  but  also  conventional  combustion  engine  fuels  manufactured  by   conventional  petrochemical  companies.  Moreover,  the  threat  of  product  substitutes  faced  by  biofuel   manufacturing  companies  can  expected  to  be  exacerbated  in  the  future  by  emerging  modes  of  transportation   motoring,  such  as  electric  engines  or  hydrogen  fuel  cells"  (Vertes  et  al,  2010,  pg.  541).    But  if  and  when  a  new   line  of  coproducts  and  biochemical  intermediates  are  established,  it  will  allow  biofuel  producers  to  make   proprietary  claims  as  innovations  in  the  fuel  space  that  can  be  successfully  leveraged  as  valuable  intellectual   property  in  the  biomaterial  arena.  Novel  molecules  will  enable  new  start-up  biofuel  companies  to  operate   around  a  business  proposition  and  an  operational  structure  created  for  it,  providing  a  nascent  company  with   the  ability  to  attract  an  adequate  amount  of  investment  (Vertes  et  al,  2010).      With  the  possibility  of  a  multiple  process  options  targeting  a  number  of  possible  coproducts,  comes   inadvertently  the  question  of  what  the  ideal  configuration  of  an  algal  biorefinery  should  be.  Should  it  be  a   product-based  or  energy-oriented  biorefinery?  Or  should  it  be  a  hybrid  capable  of  both?  Algal  feedstock  can  

  

57  

  
be  refined  in  most  of  integrated  biorefinery  designs  that  are  operating  today  (or  on  the  drawing  board),   hosting  sufficient  process  flexibility  to  switch  production  modes  between  algal  oils,  carbohydrates  or  proteins.   For  now  the  pursuit  to  commercialize  AJF  seems  to  be  more  focused  on  the  less  developed  dimension  of  the   AJF  production  pathway  -  identification  of  better  algal  species  and  COP  reduction  from  higher  oil  yields.  Algal   fuels  are  currently  an  order  of  magnitude  costlier  than  other  biofuel  production  pathways  (Singh  &  Gu,  2010).   The  market  sustainability  of  targeted  co-products  must  be  considered  in  the  context  of  their  envisioned   commercial  production  volume.  At  the  vast  production  quantities  associated  with  the  fuel  market,  it  may  not   be  easy  to  find  a  value-added  coproduct  with  comparable  scale  initially  but,  in  the  near-term  at  the  level  of  a   39.31  MLY  production  facility,  co-products  could  drive  the  economic  feasibility  of  AJF  (Davis  et  al,  2011).     

7.1.5  Further  Considerations  
   Producing  AJF  is  only  one  stage  of  the  process  to  creating  sustainable  jetfuel  that  can  compete  with  PJF  on  an   economic  basis.  Refineries,  where  downstream  processing  of  raw  algal  oil  takes  place,  are  naturally  the   gateway  for  the  AJF  value  chain  as  they  stand  between  raw  feedstock  and  readily  usable  end-use  product.   Refiners  rely  heavily  on  economies  of  scale  and  unless  a  large  enough  refining  capacity  exist  to  handle  the   volume  of  algal  feedstock  produced,  AJF  is  unlikely  to  reach  markets  at  a  competitive  price.    Therefore  it  is   essential  that  adequate  refining  capacity  follow  the  scale  up  of  advanced  biofuel  feedstock.  However  the   drawback  of  building  excess  refining  capacity  is  that  sufficiently  cheaply-cultivated  biomass  must  be  available   in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  plant  to  justify  building  the  large  plants  and  minimize  costs  and  emissions   associated  with  feedstock  transport  (O'Connell  &  Haritos,  2010).  Refinery  locational  decision  are  made  within   the  wider  context  of  strategic,  tactical  and  operational  decision  making  process,  integrating  considerations   for  AJF  production  technologies,  long-term  demand-supply  contracts,  medium-term  sourcing  and  logistics,   and  short-term  market  feedback.  The  cost-effective  downsizing  of  technology  to  match  smaller  AJF  value   chains  is  an  important  R&D  goal  in  this  area  (Awudu  &  Zhang,  2012).        While  sufficient  integrated  biorefinery  capacity  is  built,  in  the  short-term  algal  oil  feedstock  is  likely  to  be   transported  from  production  facilities  to  existing  conventional  petroleum  refineries  that  are  retrofitted  with   bio-feedstock  processing  infrastructure  (CSIRO,  2011).  Once  online,  newer  integrated  biorefineries  will   eliminate  need  to  stockpile  and  allow  for  greater  flexibility  and  risk-reduction  around  feedstock  supply.   Although  refineries  for  competing  biofuel  pathways  like  Fischer-Tropps  (standard  technique  to  convert  any   solid  feedstock  to  biofuels)  are  already  available,  HEFA  facilities  that  are  required  to  be  built  up  from  a  zero   base  will  also  be  built  in  the  least  amount  of  time  due  to  their  low  capital  intensity  (CSIRO  Data  Modeling,   2011).  On  the  other  hand,  mixed  feedstocks  also  pose  challenges  for  any  single  conversion  process  due  to  the   variable  chemical  composition  and  contaminants  characteristic  of  different  bio-feedstock.  Moreover,  a   versatile  biorefinery  will  also  have  to  juggle  multiple  harvest  and  delivery  schedules  making  the  refining

activity  concomitantly  more  complex  as  more  diverse  biomass  sources  are  accommodated  (Awudu  &  Zhang,   2012).       

7.2  POLICY  RECOMMENDATIONS  
   There  is  resurgence  in  interest  in  new  generations  of  biofuel  technology  underpinned  by  public  and  private   sector  R&D  activity  and  policy  interest  in  enhancing  the  market  penetration  of  biofuels.  Notwithstanding  this,   the  biofuel  regulatory  landscape  remains  dynamic  (Vertes  et  al,  2010).  Governmental  programs  such  as   emissions  legislation,  subsidies  or  tax  incentives  affect  investment  decisions  between  different  technologies,   support  at  specific  stages  of  an  innovation's  lifecycle,  and  indicators  of  financial  success  (Vertes  et  al,  2010).     Government  policy  can  play  an  important  role  in  creating  market  demand  for  RETs  like  AJF  aligning  it  with  a   RET  development  roadmap.  A  rapidly  growing  demand  plays  two  key  roles  in  stimulating  innovation.  First,  it   accelerates  private  sector  investment  in  innovation  and  instigates  rapid  diffusion  of  new  technologies.   Second,  and  perhaps  more  subtly,  growing  demand  provides  an  important  opportunity  for   immediate  feedback  from  the  market,  whereby  innovations  are  "more  directly  responsive  to  real  market   needs  and  less  likely  to  fall  prey  to  the  isolation  of  the  ivory  tower"  (Newell,  2010,  pg.  258).        RET  innovations  respond  rapidly  to  changing  energy  prices  and  government  regulation  as  illustrated  by   patent  data.  One  study  noted  that  more  than  half  of  the  full  effect  of  an  energy  price  rise  on  RET  patent   applications  was  experienced  after  just  5  years  (Popp,  2002).  This  time  frame  takes  into  account  the  quality   of  knowledge  available  to  private  actors  as  well  as  public  incentives  for  RET  research  (Newell,   2010).  However,  commercialization  of  innovation  in  highly  regulated  sectors  like  aviation  often  takes  a  very   long    time.  "In  order  to  bridge  the  "valley  of  death",  the  gap  between  discoveries  in  the  lab  and  the  large-scale   deployment  of  commercial  products  based  on  an  invention,  governments  can  help  establish  niche  markets   that  reduce  barriers  and  enable  cost  reduction  and  improved  performance  through  learning  by  doing,   learning  by  using,  economies  of  scale,  and  network  externalities"  (Azar  &  Sanden,  2011,  pg.  137).      The  following  sections  elaborate  on  some  of  the  key  actions  that  should  be  considered  in  designing  a  policy   path  for  the  commercialization  of  AJF.     

7.2.1  Compliment  Carbon  Tax  with  Other  Policy  Measures  

   A  carbon  tax  is  commonly  implemented  with  the  hope  of  achieving  two  main  objectives  ­  to  mitigate  the   source  of  carbon,  and  trigger  the  development  and  adoption  of  low  emission  technologies.  A  carbon  price   specifically  guides  the  uptake  of  the  most  cost-effective  low  emission  technologies  by  sending  a  consistent   financial  signal  to  consumers  in  combination  with  a  demand-driven,  profit-based  incentive  for  the  

  

59  

  
private  sector  to  invest  in  continuous  innovation  (Newell,  2010).  From  a  policy  perspective  a  carbon  tax  is   essential  to  stimulate  the  mass  adoption  of  biofuels  above  its  current  share  in  the  global  energy  mix  of  only   around  2%  on  an  energy  equivalent  basis)  (Timilsina  et  al,  2011).    However  from  an  investor's  perspective  a   carbon  tax  (at  any  practical  level)  alone  cannot  promote  AJF  commercialization  unless  parallel  policy   instruments  are  put  in  place  to  complement  the  effects  of  the  carbon  tax.  Without  any  new  emission  policy   initiative,  biofuels  can  be  expected  to  account  for  only  5.5%  of  total  liquid  fuels  used  globally  by  2020  -  about   twice  the  current  share.  If  a  carbon  tax  of  $25/tCO2e  is  implemented  in  isolation,  the  global  market  share  of   biofuels  will  rise  to  5.6%;  a  relatively  high  carbon  tax  rate  of  $100/tCO2e  will  increase  this  to  only    6.1%   (Timilsina  et  al,  2011).    When  a  carbon  tax  regime  is  aligned  with  a  mechanism  that  directly  targets  biofuel   producers  and  consumers  using  subsidies,  market  penetration  of  biofuels  increases  substantially.   For  instance,  a  25%  subsidy  applied  in  association  with  a  $25/tCO2e  will  increase  global  biofuel   penetration  to  more  than  8.5%  by  2020  while  a  50%  subsidy  will  carve  out  more  than  15%  of  global  market   share  for  biofuels.  Moreover,  biofuel  market  penetration  is  more  sensitive  to  subsidy  levels  than  carbon  tax   levels.  For  example,  a  US$10/tCO2e  carbon  tax  with  a  25%  subsidy  will  increase  global  biofuel  penetration  to   8.6%  but  if  the  carbon  tax  rate  is  raised  to  $25/tCO2e  with  the  same  level  of  subsidy,  the  global  penetration   of  biofuels  increases  to  only  8.8%  (Timilsina  et  al,  2011).  However  aligning  a  subsidy  with  a  carbon  tax  can  be   difficult  without  disclosing  the  source  of  revenue  used  to  fund  the  subsidies.  Admittedly  a  subsidy  funded   from  the  carbon  tax  revenue  will  be  hard  to  justify  because  it  will  penalize  producers  and  consumers  of   conventional  carbon  intensive  fuels  while  unfairly  favoring  cleaner  technologies  (Timilsina  et  al,  2011).    In   the  case  of  B.C.'s  carbon  tax  framework,  the  province  has  designed  its  carbon  tax  as  a  revenue  neutral   instrument,  meaning  that  all  revenues  collected  from  the  tax  is  eventually  returned  to  citizens  and   corporations  through  means  of  income  tax  credits  (BC,  2012).        Opponents  of  the  carbon  tax  claim  that  it  raises  prices  of  products  and  is  an  impediment  on  the   competiveness  of  energy  intensive  industries  which  ultimately  impacts  economic  growth  negatively  (Lin  &  Li,   2011).  It  is  argued  that  although  a  carbon  tax  may  increase  the  relative  output  of  the  biofuel  sector   in  comparison  to  outputs  of  most  other  sectors,  the  increase  in  output  will  be  insignificant  compared  to  the   decrease  in  outputs  from  other  sectors;  a  $25/tCO2e  carbon  tax  will  increase  output  of  the  biofuel  sector  by   $2.2  billion  by  2020  but  also  impose  a  cost  of  $1173  billion  worth  of  outputs  from  the  other  sectors  (Timilsina   et  al,  2011).  Moreover,  a  carbon  tax  is  a  also  controversial  because  its  intended  impacts  remain  hotly  debated   across  many  jurisdiction  that  have  implemented  the  measure;  the  wide-ranging  reports  of  carbon  tax  impacts   arise  from  different  carbon  tax  rates,  varying  extent  of  tax  exemption,  as  well  as  how  carbon  tax  revenue  was   spent.  In  order  to  limit  the  impact  on  economic  competitiveness,  Sweden,  Norway,  Netherlands  and  Denmark   provide  tax  exemptions  for  their  prized  manufacturing  and  energy  intensive  industries.  In  Norway,  the  rapid   growth  of  CO2  emissions  in  the  domestic  oil  drilling  and  natural  exploitation  sectors  is  compounded  with  the   limited  substitutability  of  remaining  fossil  fuel  uses  with  renewable  energy  sources  (hydropower,  the  main   source  of  renewable  energy  has  already  reached  the  peak),  ultimately  negating  most  of  the  mitigation  effects

of  the  carbon  tax.  Denmark  and  Netherlands  show  that  recycling  carbon  tax  revenue  to  enterprises  for   environmental  purposes  can  compensate  for  the  costs  imposed  by  tax  exemption  to  some  degree.  In  China,   carbon  tax  exemption  schemes  indicate  that  in  the  scenario  with  no  tax  exemption  or  tax  revenue   redistribution,  a  carbon  tax  may  have  a  greatly  negative  impact  on  GDP  as  well  as  the  energy  intensive   industries  (Lin  &  Li,  2011).  Mixed  results  arising  from  varying  contextual  settings  and  absence  of  any   comprehensive  empirical  analysis  (Lin  &  Li,  2011)  makes  it  very  difficult  to  elucidate  the  effectiveness  of  a   carbon  tax  (Knight  et  al,  2011).  B.C.  concedes  that  since  the  carbon  tax  was  only  established  in  2007  and   reached  final  tax  level  set  in  2012,  it  is  still  too  early  to  fully  distinguish  the  impact  of  the  measure  from  other   influential  factors  in  the  economy  such  as  2008's  economic  downturn  which  lowered  emissions  and  skewed   the  mitigation  impact  of  the  carbon  tax  in  isolation  (B.C.,  2012).        Having  said  that,  with  regards  to  stimulating  a  novel  technology  like  AJF,  emissions  policy  can  be  designed  to   recognize  the  three  primary  affects  emissions  policy  can  have  on  innovation  "(i)  an  abatement  cost  effect,   reflecting  the  extent  to  which  innovation  reduces  the  costs  of  pollution  control;  (ii)  an  imitation  effect,  which   weakens  innovation  incentives  owing  to  imperfect  appropriability;  and  (iii)  an  emissions  payment  effect,   which  can  weaken  incentives  if  innovation  reduces  firms'  payments  for  residual  emissions.  The  relative   strength  of  the  effects  vary  across  policy  instruments  and  particular  applications,  with  no  instrument  clearly   dominating  in  all  applications"  (Newell,  2010,  pg.  259).  The  literature  also  suggests  that  carbon  tax  should  be   complemented  by  non-price  fiscal  instruments  to  reduce  barriers  to  private  investment  and  in  particular  aid   innovators  in  overcoming  early-stage  market  failures  (Knight  et  al,  2011).  A  carbon  price  is  technology   agnostic  and  tends  to  favor  later  stage  technologies  which  have  already  reached  commercial  scale.  For  early   stage  technologies  however,  alternative  fiscal  support  through  technology-specific  feed-in  tariffs,  direct   investment,  tax  exemptions,  accelerated  depreciation  rates  and  renewable  energy  standards,  can  reduce   CAPEX  and  guarantee  an  end  market  for  the  innovation.  Without  these  measures,  RET  innovations  may   struggle  to  compete  with  more  established  RETs  (Knight  et  al,  2011).  

   7.2.2  Focus  on  R&D  Policy     
One  of  the  conclusions  reached  repeatedly  in  this  study  is  the  importance  of  drastically  improving  algal  oil   content  and  productivity  to  generate  AJF  at  a  COP  that  will  allow  market  adoption.  Selecting  and  cultivating   algal  strains  designed  through  advanced  biotechnological  tools  for  optimal  oil  production  can  offer  higher   yields.  Current  methods  do  not  provide  the  scientific  sophistication  needed  to  grow  the  engineered  algal   strain  outside  lab  settings  but  it  is  not  hard  to  imagine  that  through  continuous  focused  R&D  such  limitations   will  eventually  be  overcome.    In  fact,  since  the  beginning  of  aviation  biofuel  testing  culminating  in  the  ASTM   approval  of  HEFA  feedstock  in  2011,  the  prices  for  a  variety  of  biofuel  pathways  including  algae  have   already  dropped  significantly  (ATAG,  2009).  The  key  parameter  to  propel  AJF  into  a  mainstream  aviation  use   is  time  ­  when  can  AJF  reach  this  stage?  Since  focused  R&D  requires  both  time  and  capital  investment,  

  

61  

  
funding  such  activity  becomes  a  question  of  creating  the  right  environment  to  mobilize  the  financial   commitment  requisite  to  triggering  innovation.  The  concept  of  induced  innovation  recognizes  that  R&D  is  a   profit-focused  exercise  motivated  by  the  prices  that  innovations  can  attract  (Newell,  2010).    Governments   have  a  big  role  to  play  in  creating  the  context  conducive  to  breakthroughs  by  setting  policy  directives  that   leverage  regional  natural  resources  and  social-political  objectives.  If  conditions  exist  but  the  technologies  to   complement  this  advantage  are  immature,  governments  can  subsidize  R&D  activity  into  certain  technologies   directly  (Knight  et  al,  2011).  Direct  government  support  can  fill  the  gap  traditionally  left  by   underinvestment  by  the  private  sector  due  to  the  limited  profit  potential  of  basic  and  applied  R&D.  Unlike   private  enterprise;  governments  are  in  a  position  to  consider  social  returns  when  making  investment   decisions.  Government  support  of  basic  R&D  is  particularly  important,  as  long-term  payoffs,  greater   uncertainty,  and  the  lack  of  a  finished  product  at  the  end  all  make  it  difficult  for  private  firms  to  appropriate   the  returns  of  basic  R&D  (Newell,  2010).        Governments  should  also  recognize  that  environmental  and  technology  policies  work  best  in  tandem  because   while  R&D  policy  can  help  facilitate  the  creation  of  innovative  RETs,  it  leaves  little  incentive  for  their  market   adoption.  Supporting  mechanisms  for  emissions  control  such  as  a  carbon  tax  can  encourage  adoption   innovations  branching  from  publicly  funded  R&D.  In  isolation,  R&D  policy  or  carbon  tax  may  not  provide  the   welfare  generated  from  their  combined  implementation;  a  carbon  tax  will  only  achieve  95%  of  the  welfare   gains  of  the  combined  policy,  while  a  policy  using  only  the  optimal  R&D  subsidy  will  attain  just  11%  of  the   welfare  gains  of  the  combined  policy  (Newell,  2010).        Investors  generally  regard  government  supported  R&D  programs  well  and  rank  them  equally  as  subsidies  for   manufacturing  facilities  or  capital  grants  for  SMEs  or  communities  (Burer  &  Wustenhagen,  2009).  The  same   anecdotal  evidence  also  suggests  that  investors  seem  to  have  very  little  faith  in  dedicated  policy  measures   that  directly  support  RET  through  short-lived  subsidies.  Investors  seem  much  more  sensitive  to  the  technical   feasibility  or  the  proven  performance  record  of  a  technology  and  thus  prefer  support  for  R&D  programs  and   demonstration  projects  (Masini  &  Menichetti,  2013).     

7.2.3  Implement  Agnostic  Support  Mechanisms  
   Biofuels  are  only  one  set  of  RETs  and  within  biofuels;  there  are  many  kind  of  biofuel  technology  pathways   encompassing  a  variety  of  feedstocks,  conversion  processes  and  stakeholders.  Currently,  the  ground   transportation  sector  is  the  primary  consumer  of  biofuels,  its  growing  appetite  for  biodiesel  and  bioethanol   accounting  in  large  part  for  the  huge  proliferation  of  biofuel  production  and  consumption  in  the  last  decade.   The  mass  adoption  of  biofuels  in  this  sector  has  been  prompted  by  targeted  government  policies  that  have   created  efficient  value  chains  from  feedstock  cultivation,  refining  and  distribution  via  regulatory  and  financial

subsidies.  But  as  biofuel  consumption  permeates  into  other  end-use  markets  such  as  aviation  creating   competing  pressures  on  the  limited  biomass  feedstock  currently  available,  policy  makers  have  to  evaluate  the   effectiveness  of  existing  support  mechanisms  to  ensure  equitable  access  to  feedstock  so  as  to  not   disadvantage  the  growth  of  newer  biofuel  markets.  This  brings  into  focus  the  importance  of  technology   agnostic  climate  change  related  policies,  typically  referring  to  legislation  that  promote  low  carbon   technologies  without  specifying  particular  attributes  of  the  technologies  to  be  supported  (Azar  &  Sanden,   2011).  Policy  makers  usually  support  a  variety  of  emerging  technologies  in  order  to  avoid  pitfalls  or  risks   inherent  to  any  one  technology;  making  special  concessions  for  any  one  subset  or  sub-technology  pathways   creates  asymmetrical  market  incentives  which  can  eventually  impede  the  development  of  better  but  more   immature  innovations.        But  "governments  often  struggle  with  the  idea  of  `technology  neutrality'.  The  EU   commission  often  expresses  support  for  `technology-neutral'  policies,  but  once  rhetoric  translates  into  action,   technology-specific  policies  are  (often)  implemented.  For  instance,  EU  has  not  only  issued  a  directive  to   promote  the  use  of  biofuels  but  also  provides  special  support  systems  for  wood-based  biofuels.  The   policymakers  understand  that  grain-based  ethanol  is  currently  more  cost-effective"  (Azar  &  Sanden,  2011,  pg.   138).    However  this  approach  must  be  balanced  with  the  need  to  push  forward  the  next  generation  novel   biofuel  conversion  pathways  (Azar  &  Sanden,  2011).       

7.2.4  Subsidize  Refiners  
   Aviation,  despite  being  a  global  industry,  is  only  one  small  portion  of  the  global  transportation  network.  Road   transportation  dominates  this  sector  consuming  71%  of  all  transportation  fuel  leaving  only  11%  for  by   aviation  (CSIRO,  2011).  In  terms  of  refinery  output,  since  2001  production  of  jetfuel  has  fluctuated  between   6-6.3%  of  all  petroleum  derivatives  produced  (Nygren  et  al,  2009).  Due  to  the  chemical  composition  of  crude   oil  and  jetfuel  hydrocarbon  chains  being  shorter  than  diesel  range  hydrocarbons,  refiners  have  a  natural   ability  to  produce  both  derivatives,  switching  production  modes  to  reflect  market  demand  for  diesel  or  jetfuel.   But  generally,  refiners  have  a  stronger  incentive  to  produce  more  road  transportation  fuel  than  jetfuel  due  to   the  higher  operating  costs  incurred  and  lower  revenues  received  from  jetfuel  production.  The  additional  cost   arises  from  hydrogen  production  (from  natural  gas)  and  revenues  foregone  due  to  generating  lower   quantities  of  higher-value  diesel  fuel  (Pearlson  et  al,  2013).  This  is  true  for  refiners  producing  biofuels  as  well   as  conventional  refineries  that  have  upgraded  their  capacity  to  process  vegetable  oils  (ATAG,  2009).  But   policy  measures  generally  provide  subsidies  for  road  biofuel  producers  ­  the  US  Volumetric  Ethanol  Excise   Tax  Credit  provides  $0.13/l  to  ethanol  producers  and  the  American  Jobs  Creation  Act  offers  biodiesel   producers  $0.26/l    (Sorda  et  al,  2010)  -  while  no  current  direct  incentives  exist  to  sway  more  production  to   bioderived  jetfuels  (PARTNER,  2013).  Given  that  vegetable  oils  can  be  converted  to  road  biodiesel  via  a  tried- and-tested  process  called  transesterification  at  a  cost  of  up  to  $0.15-$0.20/l  less  than  the  COP  of  bioderived   jetfuel  (CSIRO,  2011),    refiners  who  choose  to  produce  the  latter  suffer  a  strategic  disadvantage  (Vertes  et  al,  

  

63  

  
2010)  i.e.  a  typical  refinery  processing  AJF  will  incur  higher  COR  and  have  less  money  to  acquire  scarcely   available  feedstock.          In  the  long-term  competition  between  the  road  sector  and  aviation  industry  will  ease  due  to  the  gradual   electrification  of  road  transportation,  ramp  up  of  feedstock  production  and  certification  of  multiple   conversion  technologies.  But  unless  short  term  policy  measures  recognize  the  disparity  in  access  to  scarce   biomass  feedstock,  ongoing  excise  arrangements  and  relative  cost  of  feedstock  refining  technologies  between   road  and  aviation  fuels,  development  of  newer  technologies  like  AJF  will  be  impeded.       

7.2.5  Implement  National  Mandates  
   National  targets  play  an  important  role  in  setting  the  direction  and  aspirations  of  climate  change  related   policies.  They  can  either  be  mandatory  -  supported  by  legislative  penalties  and  incentives  -  or  merely   aspirational.  Although  targets  do  not  directly  offer  certainty,  they  ensure  private  investors  of  a  sizable  future   biofuel  market.  In  the  absence  of  aviation  fuel  blending  targets  (mandate  requiring  all  jetfuel  to  have  a   minimum  biofuel  content),  bio-SPKs  must  compete  with  PJF  in  the  extremely  price  sensitive  fuel  market   where  COP  tends  to  price  Bio-SPKs  out  of  the  market  (Knight  et  al,  2011).  National  targets  have  been  key  in   establishing  markets  for  1st  generation  biofuels.  For  example,  the  EU  RED  continues  to  stimulate  demand  for   biofuels  by  stipulating  national  targets  for  member  nations,  defining  biofuel  use  obligations,  and  defining  a   regulatory  framework  by  which  incentives  are  linked  to  the  environmental  performance  of  individual  fuels,   aiming  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  biofuels  consumed  in  the  EU  (Vertes  et  al,  2010).  In  Brazil,  the  largest   producer  of  bioethanol  in  the  world,  the  government  mandates  a  20­25%  blend  of  ethanol  with  gasoline,  sets   lower  taxes  on  ethanol  storage,  and  protects  the  domestic  producers  with  a  20%  duty  on  imports.  Equivalent   support  for  alternative  engine  technologies  has  resulted  in  83%  of  all  cars  sold  in  Brazil  to  be  flex-fuel  vehicle   capable  of  running  on  100%  bioethanol  (Sorda  et  al,  2010).        In  order  to  make  AJF  equally  attractive,  long-term  stable  policy  regimes  built  on  sound  legal  foundations  (like   feed-in-tariff  programs  prevalent  in  other  RET  sectors)  are  essential  to  attracting  the  serious  private  sector   investment  needed  for  it's  continuing  development  (ATAG,  2009).  As  with  R&D  and  emissions  policy,  it  is   important  that  decision  makers  implement  measures  in  a  staged  fashion  to  ensure  that  newer  technologies   do  not  arise  prematurely  before  previous  policy  measures  have  created  conditions  for  its  success.  For   example,  in  the  case  of  coal  powered  electricity  generation,  introducing  a  carbon  tax  in  the  absence  of  earlier   stage  policies  poses  the  risk  that  carbon  price  inflation  will  be  borne  fully  by  electricity  consumers  because  of   a  lack  of  viable  energy  alternatives.  The  strategic  staging  of  related  policies  can  ensure  that  a  constant   pipeline  of  new  clean  energy  technologies  will  emerge  to  compete  well  with  coal-fired  electricity,  pushed  to   even  greater  success  once  a  carbon  price  arrives  (Knight  et  al,  2011).  The  duration  of  implementation  of  

  

64  

  
policy  instrument  in  questions  is  also  an  important  consideration,  as  well-targeted  policy  meant  to  inspire   innovative  solutions  should  ideally  aim  to  be  temporary;  its  should  be  reduced  and/or  removed  once   solutions  diffuse  into  the  market  in  order  to  avoid  dependency  on  policy  incentives  (Knight  et  al,  2011).    

   7.2.6  Implement  Emission  Standards     
Unlike  road  transportation  fuels,  aviation  fuels  are  typically  precluded  from  key  renewable  energy  policies.  In   the  US,  the  EISA  mandates  the  consumption  of  at  least  32  billion  gallons  of  biofuels  by  2022  without   specifying  any  expectation  for  the  aviation  sector.  The  RFS  does  offer  producers  tradable  credits  based  on  the   renewable  content  should  they  produce  Bio-SPKs,  but  for  reasons  discussed,  without  mandating  aviation   specific  targets  most  feedstock  acquisition  and  biofuel  production  will  fulfill  the  demands  of  the  incumbent   industry.  The  EU's  Emissions  Trading  Scheme  (ETS)  recently  attempted  to  include  aviation  under  its  umbrella,   charging  airlines  flying  into  EU  airspace  a  carbon  tax  based  on  jurisdictional  emissions.  Airlines  are  eligible   for  exemption  from  this  tax  if  aircrafts  operate  using  biofuels  that  are  catalogued  by  the  EU  and  that  align   with  its  RED  criteria  for  sustainability.  But  the  aviation  component  of  the  EU  ETS  is  currently  inactive   following  multiple  complaints  and  high-profile  trade  threats  made  by  affected  parties  (Economist,  2012).  The   contentious  policy  measure  highlights  two  major  barriers  in  including  aviation  in  climate  change  related   policies.  Firstly  aviation,  being  a  cross-boundary  operation,  faces  significant  compliance  hurdles  as  airline   operators  are  required  to  conform  to  multiple  regulatory  standards  that  carry  varying  stipulations  for  the   eligibility  of  biofuels  for  incentives  or  mandates.  Secondly,    biofuel  directives  are  often  tied  to  their  emissions   profile  but  the  lack  of  a  universal  framework  disallows  universal  verification  emissions  performance  and   enforcement  of  emissions  standards.  Both  the  EU  RED  and  US  RFS  differ  in  the  methodologies  applied.  Under   such  a  scenario  "a  biofuel  producer  must  decide  if  its  bio-jetfuel  should  be  certified  for  sustainability   according  to  the  regulations  of  the  country  of  production,  departure,  or  arrival.  If  a  biofuel  producer  in  Brazil   exports  bio-jetfuel  to  the  US  where  it  is  delivered  to  an  airline  for  a  flight  to  the  EU,  Brazilian  legislation  is   applicable  to  the  production,  US  RFS  is  applicable  if  the  importer  wants  to  obtain  tradable  certificates   (Renewable  Identification  Numbers  ­  RINs)  and  finally  the  EU  RED  requirements  have  to  be  met  if  the  airline   applies  for  exemption  from  the  EU  ETS...Moreover,  biomass  and  biofuel  producers  will  be  led  to  sell   preferentially  into  those  countries  which  offer  the  highest  incentives  making  it  difficult  for  other  countries   to  acquire  the  limited  supplies  of  bio-jetfuel"  (IATA,  2012,  pg.  16).  In  order  to  avoid  costly  multiple   certifications  and  stimulate  global  uptake  of  Bio-SPKs  including  AJF,  cross-border  regulations  and   related  biofuel  accounting  schemes  have  to  be  harmonized.      A  globally  harmonized  sustainability  criteria  for  biofuels  will  need  to  be  built  on  universal  methodologies   capable  of  cataloguing  and  classifying  biofuels  derived  from  feedstock  grown  under  diverse  natural  and   process  conditions,  in  addition  to  elucidating  lifecycle  emissions  associated  with  land-use  change.    Although  

  

65  

  
understanding  the  magnitude  of  carbon  released  during  land-use  changes  remains  a  topic  of  much  debate,   sufficient  information  is  available  to  warrant  a  precautionary  approach  before  any  biofuel  produced  from   carbon  rich  inputs  is  produced  (Malaysian  biofuel  producers  are  notorious  for  clear  cutting  rainforests  to   cultivate  palm).  Studies  indicate  that  the  potential  magnitude  of  carbon  released  from  consumption  of   feedstocks  like  palm  oil  is  sufficiently  large  to  negate  any  emissions  credits.  In  contrast,  algae  derived  biofuels   perform  substantially  better  especially  if  cultivated  in  non-arable  or  decrepit  land  which  elicits  negligible   land-use  change  emissions  (RAND,  2009).  An  emissions  policy  framework  built  from  mutual  recognition  of   sustainability  certifications  between  different  jurisdictions  is  therefore  strongly  likely  to  favor  AJF  (IATA,   2012).        An  additional  consideration  for  policy  makers  to  explore  in  the  short  term  to  vitalize  AJF  while  a  robust   international  emissions  framework  is  devised  is  an  Ultralow-Sulfur  specification  (ULS)  for  aviation  fuel.   Advanced  biofuels  made  from  vegetable  oils  contain  zero  traces  of  sulfur,  an  attribute  that  translates  into   negligible  SOx  emissions  during  combustion.  An  ULS  specification  will  align  aviation  with  specification   existing  for  highway  diesel  fuel  which  will  indirectly  impart  benefits  upstream  in  the  supply  chain  by   potentially  improving  refinery  scheduling  and  operations,  and  encourage  multiuse  pipeline  operations.  An   ULS  jetfuel  specification  will  ease  the  introduction  of  HEFA  fuels  into  the  commercial  liquid  transportation   fuel  infrastructure  (along  with  crude  oil  derivatives)  as  HEFA  fuels  pose  similar  infrastructural  compatibility   concerns  such  as  lubricity,  effect  on  seals  due  to  low  sulfur,  and  reduced  aromatic  content.  Given  the  human- health  impact  of  particulate  matter  (PM)  and  gaseous  PM  precursors  arising  from  fuel  combustion  during   takeoff,  landing,  and  ground  operations,  ULS  jet  fuel  will  virtually  eliminate  primary  and  secondary  PM   generated  by  aviation  emissions.  Unlike  new  aircraft  and  engine  technologies  that  take  some  time  to  diffuse   into  and  airline  fleet,  the  air-quality  benefits  of  sulfur  elimination  will  be  realized  as  soon  as  ULS  jetfuel  is   introduced    (RAND,  2009).  An  ULS  specification  can  be  easily  implemented  and  enforced  in  the  industry   because  the  process  of  removing  sulfur  from  fuel  derivatives  is  well  understood  and  is  widely  practiced  by   refiners  wherever  ULS  diesel  standards  exist.  Having  said  that,  prior  to  implementation  of  an  ULS   specification,  consideration  will  have  to  given  to  the  adverse  consequences  of  higher  fuel  cost  associated  with   ULS  jetfuel,  an  increase  (of  about  1%)  in  the  fuel  volume  purchased  and  consumed,  a  reduction  (of  about  1%)   in  the  aircraft  range  with  full  fuel  tanks,  an  increase  (of  about  2%)  in  life-cycle  GHG  emissions,  and  the   elimination  of  sulfur  aerosols  which  have  a  short-term  climate  cooling  effect  (RAND,  2009).

   7.2.7  Model  Technology  Policy  Around  Investor  Interests  
   When  designing  technology-centered  policies  aiming  to  guide  the  development  of  new  low  carbon   innovations,  policy  makers  can  take  a  technology-push  or  market-pull  approach.  Technology-push  policies   such  as  government-funded  R&D  programs  aim  to  increase  the  amount  of  technology  `supply'  whereas   market-pull  policies  such  as  public  procurement  of  production  tax  credits  target  demand  creation  for  new   technologies,  providing  producers  and  consumers  economic  incentives  to  apply  them.  There  is  much   deliberation  amongst  climate  policy  scientists  and  modelers  about  the  optimal  approach  to  reach  long-term   emissions  mitigation  targets,  with  proponents  of  technology  push  arguing  for  the  need  to  allow  breakthrough   innovation  to  gain  visibility  to  consumers,  in  contrast  to  market-pull  instruments  that  aim  to  ensure  a  market   for  new  technologies  is  created  prior  to  their  introduction  (Burer  &  Wustenhagen,  2009).  Often  governments   compromise  and  pursue  a  mixture  of  both  policy  approaches.      The  more  practical  challenge  for  policy  makers  lies  in  designing  optimal  programs  to  push  new  technologies   from  research  laboratories  to  market  through  the  `technology  valley  of  death'  ­the  middle  phase  of  the   commercialization  pathway  where  successful  prototypes  of  the  technology  are  developed  but  cannot   progress  further  due  to  insufficient  revenues  funneled  into  continuing  development  (Burer  &  Wustenhagen,   2009).    Fortunately,  experience  shows  that  this  is  an  area  where  private  equity  investors  like  Venture   Capitalists  (VCs)  focus  their  commitments.  Private  investment  in  the  renewable  energy  sector  has  recently   surpassed  $100  billion  per  year,  the  largest  contributions  being  in  wind  farms  or  biofuel  projects.  Early  stage   investors  have  historically  played  a  crucial  role  in  RET  development  and  so  the  stage  of  the   commercialization  pathway  where  they  are  most  active  in,  as  well  as  the  associated  market  conditions,   naturally  become  good  benchmarks  to  guide  technology  policy  (Burer  &  Wustenhagen,  2009).      In  order  to  create  an  environment  conducive  to  investment,  policy  should  accompany  support  mechanisms   that  attract  investor  interest  for  biofuel  projects.  Renewable  energy  projects  are  typically  characterized  by   high  UCC;  large  `front-loaded'  capital  investment  is  requisite  to  realizing  the  eventual  benefits  of  generating   renewable  energy  at  relatively  low  OPEX.  Bank  financing  is  the  primary  source  of  funding  for  such  capital   intensive  projects  but  traditionally  securing  backing  from  debt  providers  has  been  the  main  hurdle  for   renewable  energy  developers  due  to  technological,  operational  and  project-related  risks  elaborated  earlier   (Knight  et  al,  2011).  Project  finance  lenders  are  traditionally  conservative  and  tend  to  favor  low-risk  projects   (even  if  prospect  for  high  returns  exist)  involving  tried-and-tested  technologies  that  can  provide  returns  on   investment  irrespective  of  the  policy  climate  (Vertes  et  al,  2010).  In  the  last  decade,  banks  have  become   increasingly  unwilling  to  lend  to  1st  generation  biofuel  projects  in  response  to  the  inefficient  bioconversion   process  technologies  that  have  come  to  dominate  the  industry  and  concerns  surrounding  the  long-term   sustainability  of  the  primary  feedstock.  Although  advanced  feedstock  and  newer  process  pathways  alleviate

partly,  or  all  of,  the  concerns  associated  with  outdated  1st  generation  pathways,  lenders  remain  cautious.  This   perpetuates  a  paradoxical  problem  -  financiers  are  unwilling  to  lend  capital  for  new  infrastructure  until  an   adequate  and  robust  value  chain  is  secured  but  producers  find  it  very  difficult  to  commit  resources  until  they   are  assured  that  the  infrastructure  to  process  and  deliver  their  product  to  market  exists  (Vertes  et  al,  2010).   Governments  can  interject  to  break  this  chicken-and-egg  problem  by  legislating  specific  incentive  structures   for  early  stage  R&D  activities,  creating  publicly  funded  VC  funds,  and  partnering  with  private  financiers  to   share  risks  in  funding  demonstrations  projects  for  technology  validation.    Policy  makers  can  also  encourage   formation  of  technology  clusters.  For  AJF  producers  the  business  model  represented  by  supply  chains  in  the   US  corn-belt  is  a  good  model.  Smaller  projects  targeting  smaller  markets  should  be  optimally  located  near   customers  and  local  sources  of  primary  raw  materials,  while  larger  projects  should  leverage  not  only  their   size  advantage  by  being  located  in  areas  of  highest  biomass  concentrations  (synonymous  to  the  US  Corn  Belt   for  corn  ethanol  production)  "but  also  their  ability  to  absorb  larger  due  diligence  and  transaction  costs.  While   these  latter  costs  will  decrease  as  lenders  become  more  experienced  with  managing  clean  technology  or   biofuel  project  opportunities,  the  combination  of  various  projects  with  different  risk  profiles  may  generate  a   portfolio  effect  that  ultimately  decreases  the  overall  risk"  (Vertes  et  al,  2010,  pg.  533).     

7.2.8  Assimilate  Considerations  for  Investor  Psychology  in  Investment  Policy    
   Another  strategy  to  develop  informed  technology  policies  that  can  motivate  investment  in  AJF  is  to  examine   factors  that  impact  investor  perception  of  RETs  and  how  in  turn  that  perception  translates  to  investment   behaviors.  Investors  look  upon  RET  investments  favorably  as  an  option  to  diversify  their  investment  portfolio   and  decrease  their  overall  portfolio  risk.  A  recent  stream  of  research  studying  RET  cost  contributions  relative   to  risk  contributions  to  a  portfolio  of  energy  generating  resources  (including  fossil  fuel  sources),  indicated   that  adding  RETs  decreased  the  overall  portfolio  cost  and  risk,  even  though  the  stand-alone  generating  costs   of  each  RET  was  higher  (Masini  &  Menichetti,  2013).  This  is  because  by  investing  in  a  range  of  RETs  investors   can  curtail  the  risk  associated  with  sudden  changes  in  exogenous  factors  (raw  materials  price  and  supply,   regulatory  framework  or  shift  in  consumer  preferences)  that  may  affect  the  viability  of  any  one  RET.  Having   said  that,  despite  relying  on  the  role  of  private  finance  to  accelerate  RET  deployment,  RET  policy  literature   seldom  incorporates  investor  perspective.  Policy  makers  generally  take  a  very  rational  approach  in   assimilating  the  technology  performance,  economics  and  market  adoption  efficiency  with  the  underlying   assumptions  for  private  investor  behaviors.  "Yet,  there  is  increasing  evidence  that  a  purely  rational  economic   evaluation  of  the  investment  alternatives  does  not  suffice  to  explain  how  investors  deploy  capital  or  how   agents  choose  among  competing  energy  technologies.  An  emerging  stream  of  literature  suggests  that  broader   social  and  psychological  considerations  must  be  included  in  the  analysis  of  energy  systems"  (Masini  &   Menichetti,  2013,  pg.  511).  RET  investors  are  likely  to  use  three  primary  sources  of  information  to  make   investment  decisions,  with  their  decisions  varying  with  the  extent  of  their  sensitivity  to  the  source  of  

  

68  

  
information:  i)  they  observe  the  behavior  of  their  peers  (well  known  investors  in  the  same  industry),  ii)  they   consider  the  opinion  of  external  consultants  who  specialize  in  the  RET  industry,  and  iii)  they  use  factual   information  originating  either  from  technical  reports  or  from  due  diligence  conducted  in-house.  Following   from  these  guidelines,  it  seems  that  the  perceived  technological  feasibility  (or  lack  thereof)  of  a  RET  project  is   one  of  the  most  significant  barriers  to  RET  investment  which  highlights  the  critical  importance  of  technology   validation  projects  early  on  (Masini  &  Menichetti,  2013).        Secondly  and  more  importantly,  the  economic  viability  of  most  RET  projects  is  often  dependent  on  the  level  of   confidence  investors  have  in  the  effectiveness  of  incentive  mechanisms  (Masini  &  Menichetti,  2013).  Public   policies  most  often  are  built  on  uncertain  grounds  because  they  are  subject  to  political  ideology  and  public   sentiment.  This  uncertainty  have  been  identified  as  a  powerful  deterrent  in  securing  private-sector   investment  as  highlighted  by  the  investment  downturns  following  changing  regulation  in  Denmark,  in   Germany  and  the  US  (Masini  &  Menichetti,  2013).  Given  the  usual  time  lag  between  initial  discovery  and   profitable  market  penetration,  it  is  critical  that  private  investors  feel  confident  of  sufficient  demand  existing   for  their  innovation  once  it  reaches  the  market.  An  example  of  a  consistent  and  stable  regulatory  framework   that  has  been  able  to  mobilize  substantial  private  capital  is  the  feed-in-tariff  system  that  is  very  popular  in   Europe  where  it  has  allowed  for  large  profitable  corporate  operations  within  the  wind  and  solar  energy   sector.  Investors  respond  well  to  feed-in-tariffs  because  they  are  encouraged  by  its  long  track  record  as  a   stable  policy  instrument  especially  in  Germany  (Burer  &  Wustenhagen,  2009).  However,  although  policy   makers  and  industry  are  in  general  consensus  that  an  economy  wide  carbon  tax  with  increasingly  stringent   emissions  targets  set  through  several  decades  (Newell,  2010)  is  a  good  policy  direction,  early  stage  investors   are  not  univocally  positive  due  to  the  lock-in  affect  of  long-term  policy  incentives.  Investor  behavior  with   regards  to  RET  policy  is  one  that  can  be  best  described  as  policy  averse,  meaning  that  investor  decisions  are   evaluated  without  any  regards  or  assumptions  for  policy  incentives.  Qualitative  studies  suggest  that  investors   generally  avoid  long-term  commitments  in  projects  based  solely  on  projected  tax  credits  or  subsidies.   Investors  prefer  instead  short-term  3-5  year  subsidies  to  aid  in  the  initial  technology  push  after  which  the   credits  should  expire  to  allow  projects  to  stand  independent  of  government  support.  As  far  as  emission   policies  are  concerned,  cross-border  investors  express  concern  about  the  multitude  of  regulatory  frameworks   and  mixed  standards  that  exist  across  jurisdictions  (Burer  &  Wustenhagen,  2009).        Investor  sentiments  can  also  reflect  the  underlying  regional  socio-economic  and  cultural  paradigms  which   can  turn  inform  investor  skepticism  or  optimism  about  the  success  of  RETs.  For  example,  large  corporations   in  Europe  tend  to  rank  climate  change  as  a  key  driver  of  the  clean  energy  industry  whereas  American   investors  rank  energy  security  and  competitive  advantage  (followed  by  climate  change  policy)  as  key  drivers.   Moreover,  U.S.-based  investors  also  tend  to  be  more  skeptical  in  general  about  clean  energy  support  schemes   as  a  way  of  increasing  investment  in  the  clean  energy  sector  and  are  likely  to  refer  to  market  signals  such  as   high  oil  prices  as  the  key  driver  for  their  investment  (Burer  &  Wustenhagen,  2009).  Public  perception  of  

  

69  

  
climate  change  and  the  extent  to  which  it  is  captured  in  policy  can  also  motivate  investor  behaviors;  highly   eco-sophisticated  populations  largely  prompt  developed  economies,  such  as  those  represented  by  the   Organization  of  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD),  to  pursue  environmental  oriented  policies.   Countries  like  Germany,  Denmark,  Ireland  and  Belgium,  having  access  to  relatively  large  physical  resources  of   wind,  solar,  biofuel,  or  geothermal,  have  fostered  RET  industries  in  response  to  the  perceived  need  to  reduce   the  import  of  carbon  heavy  coal,  oil  and  natural  gas.  Other  countries  like  Iceland,  Norway,  New  Zealand  and   Austria  have  historically  relied  on  geothermal  and  large-scale  hydropower  and  so  are  natural  inclined   towards  RETs.  These  countries  exhibit  an  innovation  nirvana  where  efforts  to  commercialize  (and   sequentially  innovate)  RETs  are  met  by  "wide-spread  acceptance  and  demand,  limiting  the  economic  risk  and   allowing  for  commercialization  through  the  use  of  venture  capital,  equity  investments,  or  through  the   acquisition  of  other  innovation  by  larger  incumbent  energy  firms"  (Walsh,  2012,  pg.  38).  Other  countries  like   Canada,  Finland,  Norway  and  Switzerland,  which  have  access  to  low  cost  domestic  electricity  supply   generated  from  large-scale  hydro  and/or  nuclear  stations  generally  exhibit  higher  sensitivity  to  fluctuating   renewable  energy  demand,  create  economic  risk  for  RET  providers  and  trigger  a  more  discontinuous   innovation  process.  Consequently,  these  jurisdictions  deploy  more  cautious  commercialization  strategies   involving  joint  ventures  or  strategic  alliances  with  large  incumbent  energy  firms  instead  of  equity   investments  (Walsh,  2012).  In  addition  to  eco-sophistication,  the  overall  economic  wellbeing  of  the  region   where  RET  investment  and  adoption  is  in  question  is  also  important  as  in  the  long  term,  increases  in  real  GDP   per  capita  and  CO2  emissions  per  capita  are  found  to  be  major  drivers  behind  per  capita  renewable  energy   consumption.  "Higher  income  individuals  are  more  likely  to  have  their  basic  needs  and  wants  met  and  be   concerned  with  environmental  issues  and  have  the  money  to  invest  in  and  purchase  of  renewable  energy.   Higher  income  countries  are  also  more  likely  to  have  access  to  or  the  development  of  new  technologies  that   are  important  to  the  increased  production  and  use  of  renewable  energy"  (Sadorsky,  2009,  461).    In  such   social  context  a  1%  increase  in  real  GDP  per  person  can  potentially  increase  per  capital  renewable  energy   consumption  by  8.44%.  Similarly  a  1%  increase  in  CO2  emissions  per  person  can  potentially  increase   per  capita  renewable  energy  consumption  by  5.23%  (Sadorsky,  2009).      Taking  into  consideration  the  behavioral  context  (economic  conditions,  state  of  technology  and  historical   trends)  of  private  investors  can  be  useful  in  determining  the  efficiency  of  policy  making  decisions  across   different  socio-economic  environment  which  can  in  turn  inform  the  best  line  of  strategies  to  deploy  AJF.  For   example,  developing  economies  such  as  India  and  China  might  appeal  as  potential  jurisdictions  for  algal   technology  investment  but  because  these  regions  have  traditionally  exhibited  harsh  realities  for  RET   developers,  policy  frameworks  borrowed  from  regions  with  high  level  of  eco-sophistication  and  demand  for   renewable  energy  products  might  not  be  realistic  unless  the  technology  is  so  disruptive  that  its  potential   return  outweighs  the  commercial  risk.  Rather,  the  framework  applied  in  India  or  China  should  be  one  that   encourages  collaborative  strategies  between  government,  utilities  and  private  investors.  This  way  private   investors  "will  save  time  and  resources  with  a  greater  choice  of  successfully  diffusing  their  innovation  into  

  

70  

  
the  market.  Investors  will  benefit  from  reducing  their  risk  of  investment  through  a  better  understanding  of   the  RET  environment  they  are  investing  in.  Concurrently  policy  makers  will  also  be  able  to  judge  what   policies  best  motivate  adoption  of  RET  within  their  jurisdiction"  (Walsh,  2012,  pg.  40).       

7.2.9  Create  Cross-Disciplinary  and  Cross-Regional  Partnerships  
   Over  the  next  decade  global  air  traffic  ridership  is  expected  to  rise  by  180%  followed  by  a  140%  growth  in   CO2  emissions  -  the  lower  emissions  growth  rate  is  mediated  by  a  baseline  technology  improvement  of  1%   per  year.  However  determining  the  expected  passenger  growth  rate  is  not  straightforward  due  to  the   uncertainty  of  how  aviation  and  its  passengers  will  treat  any  cost  impacts  of  technological  improvements  or   policy  shifts.  For  example,  if  advanced  engine  design  allows  for  greater  fuel  efficiency,  the  resulting  cost   savings  may  eventually  be  passed  on  to  passengers  in  form  of  cheaper  ticket  prices,  which  will  raise  ridership,   airline  operations  and  inevitably  negate  any  emissions  mitigation  effects  of  the  fuel  efficiency  measure.   Because  of  this  uncertainty,  aviation  is  choosing  redundancy  in  its  approach  and  support  for  both  demand   and  supply-side  measures  that  can  allow  the  industry  to  maintain  both  forecasted  growth  rate  and  fulfill  its   emissions  targets.  Simulation  studies  hint  that  supply-side  mechanisms,  such  as  biofuel  use,  provide   significantly  more  room  for  growth  than  demand  management  strategies,  such  as  short-haul  transport  or   price  on  carbon,  while  imposing  comparable  levels  of  emissions  (Bonnefoy,  2011).  Demand  management   schemes  become  effective  only  if  aggressive  measures  are  implemented.  In  fact  a  $200/tCO2e  price  will  offer   only  a  mere  8%  emission  reduction  compared  to  the  baseline  scenario.  Similarly,  mitigating  aviation   emissions  by  20%  will  call  for  diversion  of  up  to  60%  of  all  short-haul  flights  to  other  transport  modes.  In   contrast  the  use  of  biofuels  offers  one  of  the  more  practical  means  by  which  policy  measures  and  industry   effort  can  have  a  measurable  impact  (Bonnefoy,  2011).            The  promise  of  advanced  biofuel  technologies  like  AJF  is  still  far  from  being  met.  There  is  a  big  role  for   government  to  play  in  strongly  supporting  lab-scale  and  pilot  scale  R&D  necessary  to  translate  scientific   innovations  to  commercial  scale  feasibility.  It  is  possible  that  a  commercially  viable  AJF  technology  pathway   will  emerge  from  research  activity  facilitated  solely  by  the  private  sector  but  the  very  limited  return  on   investment  associated  with  early  stage  R&D  will  make  this  unlikely.  There  is  considerable  room  for   development  before  aviation  biofuels  become  economically  viable  but  given  the  immediacy  with  which   aviation  has  to  start  transitioning  to  a  de-carbonization,  stakeholders  need  to  act  now  to  form  the  networks   and  put  in  place  actions  to  ease  the  transition  when  restrictive  policies  are  eventually  enacted    (ATAG,  2009).        In  the  last  decade  biofuel  production  has  been  driven  by  major  biofuel  producing  regions.  The  key   instruments  fostering  production  and  increasing  consumption  have  been  mandatory  blending  targets,  tax   exemptions  and  subsidies.  Governments  have  intervened  in  1st  generation  biofuel  value  chain  by  supporting  

  

71  

  
intermediate  inputs  (feedstock  crops),  subsidizing  value-adding  factors  (labor,  capital,  and  land)  and  granting   incentives  that  target  end-products  in  addition  to  enforcing  import  tariffs  that  protect  national  industries   from  external  competition  (Sorda  et  al,  2010).  Brazil  has  very  successfully  applied  these  strategies  to  leverage   its  natural  resources  to  establish  a  local  biofuel  industry  that  thrives  on  its  strong  stable  supply  chain  and  low   COP;  relatively  cheap  sugarcane  feedstock,  high  land  productivity  coupled  with  almost  no  needs  for  irrigation,   use  of  biomass  residue  for  co-generation  (mills  are  able  to  satisfy  almost  all  of  their  energy)  and  several  years   of  governmental  support  mobilized  large  investment  in  R&D  and  technology  developments  that  have  been   critical  elements  of  Brazils  energy  independence  (Sorda  et  al,  2010).      Having  said  that  producers  and  consumers  need  to  inevitably  move  away  from  1st  generation  fuels  to  newer   fuel  technologies  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability.  For  aviation  this  is  a  critical  requirement  seeing  that  the   sector  is  very  likely  to  be  married  to  liquid  fuel  technologies  for  the  coming  decades.  But  there  are  lessons  to   be  drawn  from  policy  conditions  and  industrial  cooperation  that  have  been  characteristic  of  the  last  decade  of   biofuel  proliferation.  Similar  to  the  stakeholder  partnerships  in  the  incumbent  biofuel  industry  (that  largely   addresses  the  needs  of  road  transportation  industry),  the  aviation  industry,  government,  AJF  producers,   agricultural  sectors  and  academia  should  come  together  to  combine  expertise  and  analyze  the  opportunities   for  regional  AJF  production  including  the  optimal  feedstock  cultivation  techniques  and  infrastructure   requirements  (ATAG,  2009).  Immediate  industry  stakeholders  like  airlines,  airports,  aircraft,  engine   manufacturers  and  fuel  refiners  can  partner  with  academic  institutions  and  agricultural  companies  to   transfer  knowledge  an  expertise  to  the  facilitate  development  of  advanced  feedstocks.  Extending  the   collaboration  to  local,  regional  and  national  government  agencies,  aviation  regulators  as  well  as   environmental  and  sustainable  development  NGOs  can  further  cement  the  stability  of  the  value  chain  while   also  educating  public  perception  so  that  the  controversies  encompassing  1st  generation  biofuels  do  not   impede  the  development  of  advanced  biofuels  (ATAG,  2009).        Policy  makers  need  to  level  the  playing  field  between  road  the  transportation  sector  and  aviation  so  that   refiners  are  not  unfairly  motivated  to  produce  road  fuels  over  aviation  fuel.    For  example  under  the  current   EU  RED,  10%  of  all  energy  in  the  road  transport  sector  must  be  derived  from  renewable  sources  by  2020  and   unless  provisions  for  bioderived  jetfuel  are  introduced,  RED  may  cause  a  shift  of  all  available   sustainable  biomass  to  road  transportation  biofuels  (SAFUG,  2010).  Over  the  long-term,  the  most  profitable   use  of  limited  biomass  resources  will  be  to  provide  liquid  fuels  for  transport  services  as  competing  uses  will   catered  for  by  increasingly  affordable  solar  and  wind  energy.  Within  the  liquid  fuel  market  the  relative   competitiveness  and  lower  carbon  intensity  of  electricity  will  likely  push  rail  and  urban  short  haul  transport   towards  greater  electrification,  leaving  long  haul  transport  and  aviation  as  the  main  users  of  Bio-SPKs  (CSIRO,   2011).  In  the  short-term,  since  only  about  6%  of  global  refiner  output  is  allocated  to  jetfuel,  and  aviation  does   not  have  any  immediate  practical  alternatives  to  liquid  fuel,  policy  should  recognize  that  unless  prioritized,   the  emerging  aviation  biofuel  market  may  collapse  before  having  a  chance  to  develop  (SAFUG,  2010).

   The  key  focus  of  aviation  and  the  investment  community  should  be  to  build  a  case  for  sourcing   investment  funding  and  coordinating  investments  along  the  value  chain.  Actions  that  directly  target   components  upstream  of  the  supply  chain  will  be  of  most  value.  Some  other  priorities  are  resource   assessment  including  proximity  to  refining  infrastructure,  biomass  production  trials,  and  refining  technology   development  (CSIRO,  2011);  initiating  a  number  of  large-scale  infrastructure  projects  will  be  critical  in   sparking  confidence  in  industry  and  government.  Currently  Germany  is  building  at  least  one  large-scale  HEFA   refinery  aiming  to  encourage  industrial  activity  that  will  guard  against  a  dependency  on  imports,  utilize  the   domestic  engineering  capacity  investment  and  remove  barriers  in  the  supply  chain  in  the  process  (IATA,   2012).    Aviation  and  government  can  also  play  an  important  role  in  supporting  off-take  agreements  -  an   agreement  between  a  producer  and  a  buyer  of  a  resource  to  purchase/sell  portions  of  the  producer's  future   production  -  with  refiners  for  volumes  of  Bio-SPKs;  off-take  agreements  are  typically  negotiated  prior  to  the   construction  of  a  facility  and  offer  confidence  in  the  presence  of  a  future  market  once  the  facility  generates   fuel.  "Discussions  with  industry  have  revealed  a  desire  for  supply  contracts  with  durations  of  a  minimum  of   10  years.  The  contracts  and  off-take  agreements  are  vital  for  producers  to  gain  financing  from  capital   investors"  (IATA,  2012).  Off-take  agreements  will  in  turn  support  refiners  in  developing  supply  relationships   with  biomass  producers  (CSIRO,  2011)  and  aid  in  overcoming  the  `chicken  and  egg'  problem.    For  example,  in   the  US,  the  Defense  Logistics  Agency  (DLA)  which  purchases  fuels  for  the  Army,  Navy,  and  Air  Force,  is   currently  certifying  its  aircrafts  for  bioderived  fuels  and  financially  committing  to  large  orders  (IATA,  2012).   DLA  is  bridging  the  gap  between  certification  and  commercial  scale  production  by  supporting  a  variety  of   demonstration  programs  and  initiatives  through  partnerships  with  other  government  organizations  and   industry.  These  efforts  are  helping  promote  a  competitive  industry  while  potentially  providing  the  military  a   supplier  base  capable  of  producing  operational  volumes  of  sustainable  fuel  to  meet  future  goals  (IATA,   2012).    These  efforts  are  complemented  by  renewal  and  expansion  of  the  RFS  to  include  aviation  biofuels   (IATA,  2012)  thereby  offering  producers  and  importers  financial  credit  equal  to  the  renewable  content  for   advanced  aviation  biofuels.  In  Europe,  an  example  of  a  prominent  partnership  is  the  Aviation  Initiative  for   Renewable  Energy  in  Germany  (AIREG)  which  targets  cost  reduction  in  securing  feedstock  and  fuel   production  by  pushing  for  long-term  agricultural  financing  arrangements  with  producers  of  energy  crops   including  algae  cultivators.  Moreover,  loan  guarantees  made  available  by  the  German  development  bank  KfW   and  a  national  bio  refining  strategy  are  being  implemented  to  ensure  the  currently  pending  transition  from   pilot  plants  to  industrial  production  .The  biorefinery  strategy  also  provides  investment  grants  for   biorefineries  that  are  accompanied  by  price  guarantees  for  biofuel  producers  (IATA,  2012).          In  the  short  term,  governments  should  champion  R&D  activity  in  a  few  key  areas.  Firstly,  applied  R&D   through  international  commercial  and  scientific  partnerships  should  focus  on  bringing  to  fruition  solutions   for  low  yield  and  high  cost  attributes  of  current  algal  cultivation  regimens  (CSIRO,  2011).  Although  not   exclusive  to  algae  derived  fuels,  simulations  hint  that  a  20%  reduction  in  sustainable  biomass  COP  can

potentially  accelerate  establishment  of  a  bioderived  jetfuel  industry  in  around  five  years  (Graham  et  al.,  2011)   (CSIRO,  2011).  Secondly,  international  scientific  cooperation  will  need  to  address  the  need  for  a  robust   sustainability  standard  that  provides  a  consistent  and  equitable  process  for  airlines,  passengers,  and   governments  to  assess  biofuels  for  certification  centered  on  sustainability  criterion;  a  comprehensive   sustainability  criteria  that  ensures  that  a  source  of  aviation  biofuel  does  not  displace  food  crops  or  elicit   deforestation,  has  minimal  environmental  impacts,  and  a  net  positive  socioeconomic  impact  on  a  region,  will   distinguish  advanced  biofuels  and  particularly  AJF  from  competing  sources,  thereby  encouraging  market   uptake.  In  the  event  that  a  cross-national  carbon  pricing  framework  is  established,  a  comprehensive   sustainability  criteria  will  also  make  low  emissions  intensive  biofuels  like  AJF  more  cost  competitive  and   hence  more  profitable  to  produce  (SAFUG,  2010).  A  harmonized  standard  will  also  provide  for  uniform   enforcement  across  jurisdictions  unlike  now  where  a  patchwork  of  standards  elicit  mixed  incentives  and   inhibit  the  development  of  a  commercially  viable  AJF  market.  As  of  now,  the  Roundtable  for  Sustainable   Biofuels  (RSB)  -  an  international  multi-stakeholder  initiative  that  has  developed  a  third-party  certification   system  for  biomaterials  production  and  processing  along  environmental,  social  and  economic  criteria  -  is   the  best  candidate  for  an  effective  harmonized  system.

9.  CONCLUSION  
   According  to  one  assessment,  the  period  between  2007  and  2008  witnessed  a  400%  rise  in  investment  in   algal  biofuels  which  according  to  the  investigators  is  not  surprising  given  the  potential  projects  to  yield  an   lnternal  Rate  of  Return  (the  DF  at  which  the  NPV  is  zero  i.e.  the  higher  the  IRR,  the  better  the  investment   prospect)  of  15%  and  the  future  potential  for  investors  to  attain  higher  returns  as  biotechnology  and  process   improvements  are  made  (Stephens  et  al,  2010).  But  if  this  figure  is  reflective  of  investor  attitude  in  the  sector,   then  the  obvious  question  is  why  have  economically  viable  microalgal  biofuel  production  systems  not  yet   manifested.  There  are  two  possible  explanation  for  this;  first,  existing  pilot  and  demonstration  plants  are   mostly  smaller  than  5  ha,  well  below  the  size  threshold  for  economic  viability,  and  second,  "insufficient  time   has  passed  for  the  industry  to  evolve  from  recent  capital  injection  through  to  large-scale  commercial   production.  Thus,  the  most  appropriate  and  cost-effective  mix  of  technologies  are  yet  to  be  successfully   integrated  and  optimized,  and  even  realistic,  viable  enterprises  are  still  in  the  commercial  development  phase"   (Stephens  et  al,  2010,  pg.  127).      The  timely  commercialization  of  AJF  will  depend  on  the  intersection  of  efforts  undertaken  by  multiple   stakeholders  from  biofuel  producers,  refiners,  distributors  to  players  further  down  the  value  chain  from   airplane  manufacturers,  engine  manufacturers,  airport  owner(s),  airplane  operators,  government,  and  even   the  community,  both  in  the  near  vicinity  of  the  airport  and  the  algal  farms  (Kivits  et  al,  2010).  To  create  a   practical  roadmap  to  bring  AJF  to  the  fuel  market  at  competitive  prices,  technological  prowess  will  have  be   complemented  by  legislative  confidence  in  the  technology  that  aid  in  leveling  the  playing  field  between   advanced  biofuels  and  more  traditional  biofuel  that  have  dominated  both  feedstock  acquisition  and  market   share.  The  transition  to  sustainable  aviation  will  be  influenced  by  two  external  intermingling  factors  (i)  the   perceived  need  to  change  the  aviation  industry  towards  a  more  sustainable  aviation  paradigm  (henceforth,   the  perceived  need),  and  (ii)  technological  innovation.  Here  technological  innovation  is  not  just  a  push  from   advancements  in  AJF  but  also  societal  attitudes  that  dictate  which  innovations  should  be  retained  or   discarded  (Kivits  et  al,  2010).  The  current  trajectory  of  technological  change,  characterized  by  a  cautious   industry  and  semi-concerned  public,  is  one  where  investments  are  hedged  through  development  activity  in   multiple  technologies.  Although  this  is  not  necessarily  a  bad  thing,  it  does  mean  that  it  is  more  likely  that   significant  financial  resources  will  be  misallocated  to  pursuing  technologies  that  might  not  become   commercially  feasible  (Kivits  et  al,  2010).        A  primary  focus  for  AJF  investigators  and  producers  in  the  coming  decade  will  be  in  the  feedstock  production   side  investigating  the  optimization  of  not  only  the  algal  strains  but  also  process  technologies.  For  example   although  expensive  now,  advanced  PBRs  offer  reprieve  from  the  low  productivity,  susceptibility  to   contamination,  and  sub-optimal  controls  of  open  ponds;  through  continuous  development  PBRs  are  likely  to   become  dominant  cultivation  technology  (even  in  hybrid  system)  for  industrial  scale  fuel  operations  

  

75  

  
(Knoshaug  2011).    Furthermore,  use  of  sophisticated  PBR  systems  will  also  allow  integration  of  other  RETs  as   components  that  can  enhance  the  energy  return  on  energy  input  performance  of  the  cultivation  step  and   downstream  process  steps.  For  example,  future  algal  oil  production  can  be  undertaken  by  integrating  PBRs   with  Concentrated  Solar  Power  (CSP)  systems  that  can  deliver  electricity  to  supplement  PBR  requirements.   Currently  CSP  systems  can  have  CAPEX  and  OPEX  that  is  twice  that  of  conventional  PBRs  but  again  both   technologies  are  to  experience  significant  cost  improvement  in  the  coming  years  (Taylor  et  al,  2013).   Additionally,  biotechnological  advancement  that  allow  tailored  algal  strain  to  be  used  as  contextual  fuel   production  solution  will  allow  both  the  leverage  of  regional  resources  and  the  potential  integration  of   multiple  markets  that  can  provide  substantial  overall  financial  benefits.    For  example,  if  algal  cultivation   occurs  near  the  coastline,  the  source  of  water  to  cultivate  algae  can  also  be  self-supplied  by  connecting  with   water  desalination  plants.  Additionally,  the  desalination  plant  would  offer  the  flexibility  of  algal  strain   selection  ­  producers  can  select  freshwater  or  saline  tolerant  strains.  Much  of  the  water  in  the  whole  process   can  be  recycled,  and  the  excess  water  generated  by  the  desalination  plant  can,  in  principle,  be  sold  to  local   residential  authorities  (Taylor  et  al,  2013).        A  second  critical  area  of  investigation  for  the  coming  years  will  be  in  emission  science.  A  WTWa  analysis   usually  captures  the  impact  of  non-CO2  emissions  to  a  limited  degree.  But  climate-relevant  aviation  emissions   profile  has  a  number  of  non-CO2  constituents  including  NOx,  sulfur  compounds  and  un-combusted   hydrocarbons  that  can  interact  with  chemically  active  GHGs  ozone  (O3)  and  methane  (CH4)  (Krammer  et  al,   2013).  The  combustion  CO2  emissions  SOX  emissions  during  cruise  tend  to  cool  the  climate,  while  NOX  and  PM   emissions  are  generally  predicted  to  warm  the  climate  in  terms  of  globally  averaged  surface  temperature   (RAND,  2009).  CO2  emissions  are  released  proportionally  to  the  fuel  combusted  unlike  NOx  which  is   dependent  on  engine  settings  and  flight  altitude.  More  recent  investigations  have  come  to  include  PM  and   cloud-related  phenomena  such  as  linear  contrails  and  aircraft-induced  cirrus  that  affect  the  Earth­ atmosphere  radiation  balance.  To  add  further  complexity  an  aircrafts  emission  profile  is  also  impacted  by  the   interaction  between  the  type  of  combustion  technology  and  emissions  location,  and  local  atmospheric   composition  (Krammer  et  al,  2013).  Depending  on  where  within  the  upper  atmosphere  it  is  emitted,  water   vapor  can  be  an  important  GHG  (especially  when  emitted  in  the  stratosphere,  where  approximately  20%  to   40%  of  aircraft  emissions  are  deposited).  In  contrast,  water-vapor  emissions  at  the  ground  and  in  the   troposphere  have  a  minor  impact  as  a  GHG  because  of  the  naturally  large  abundance  of  water  in  the   hydrological  cycle.  This  is  a  very  interesting  phenomenon  as  it  implies  if  a  fuel  results  in  significant  increases   in  water-vapor  emissions  when  used  in  aviation,  it  might  be  advantageous  from  a  global  climate-change   perspective  to  use  that  fuel  in  ground  transportation  (RAND,  2009).      As  discussed  in  this  study,  presently  the  uncertainties  associated  with  the  treatment  of  fuel  production  and   in-flight  GHG  emissions  allow  for  a  broad  range  of  emission  estimates  and  impacts  for  sustainable  jetfuels.  To   better  prepare  commercial  aviation  for  potential  regulation  of  GHG  emissions,  a  standard  methodology  for  

  

76  

  
estimating  lifecycle  GHG-emission  inventories  and  impacts  is  required.  Such  a  methodology  should  include   standards  for  accounting  for  key  inputs,  setting  system  boundaries,  allocating  emissions  among  alternative   fuel  products  and  co-products,  all  combustion  emissions,  and  the  effects  of  land-use  change  (RAND,  2009).  As   part  of  the  certification  process  the  US  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  US  Air  Force,  NASA,  and  some   international  organizations  are  currently  funding  research  to  measure  the  emissions  from  burning  alternative   jetfuels.  Continuing  emission  measurements  are  essential  to  assess  accurately  the  impact  of  alternative-fuel   combustion  on  both  air  quality  and  climate  change  (RAND,  2009).      In  addition  to  meeting  operational  requirements  and  environmental  commitments,  it  is  critical  for  aviation  to   establish  a  universal  and  comprehensive  methodology  to  evaluate  the  climate  change  impact  of  AJF  for  two   important  reasons.  The  first  stems  from  the  fact  that  in  the  next  decade,  large  amounts  of  alcohol-based  fuels   and  heavy  fuels  derived  from  oil  sands  and  shale  will  likely  enter  the  world  oil  market.  The  EIA  estimates  that   heightened  supply  of  unconventional  crude  will  cut  costs  by  $5  to  $13  per  barrel.    A  flood  of  cheaper  fuels  will   make  it  even  more  difficult  for  advanced  biofuels  to  compete  on  a  price  basis  (RAND,  2009)  unless  policy   measures  are  put  in  place  that  will  set  emission  standards  and  penalties  for  surpassing  them.  Unconventional   crude  is  abundant  across  many  parts  of  the  world  but  is  also  very  expensive  to  extract  and  refine  as  well   releases  as  much  as  30%  emissions  per  unit  of  energy  compared  to  conventional  crude.  Applying  a  price  on   carbon  will  level  the  playing  field  and  enforce  a  market-mediated  transition  to  cleaner  aviation  fuels  like  AJF.        Secondly  building  consensus  around  a  verifiable  framework  to  quantify  the  non-CO2  climate  change  impact  of   aviation  fuels  will  impart  the  ability  for  aviation  to  chart  its  actual  performance  along  emissions  standards   and  anticipate  mitigation  strategies  accordingly  even  if  some  carbon  pricing  frameworks  are  implemented  in   the  short  term.  Krammer  et  al  (2013)  show  that  in  a  scenario  where  EU  ETS  applied  to  aviation  and  maximum   levels  of  biofuel  is  consumed,  the  long  term  CO2  and  non-CO2  climate  change  impact  start  to  diverge;  CO2   impact  levels  off  during  2020  to  2040,  but  non-CO2  impact  continues  to  grow  over  this  time  period.  The  net   result  is  that  aviation's  aggregate  global  warming  potential  continues  to  rise  between  2020  and  2050   indicating  the  absence  of  a  `climate-neutral'  growth  period  past  2020.  In  other  words,  unless  advanced   biofuels  are  designed  to  lower  absolute  emissions  and  their  aggregate  global  warming  potential,  aviation's   efforts  at  meeting  both  its  growth  projections  and  environmental  standards  will  be  very  difficult  once  policy   measures  catch  up  to  the  most  updated  science  (Krammer  et  al,  2013).
