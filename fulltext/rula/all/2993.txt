ABSTRACT

Transformation as a Type: Seeking a Flexible Housing Typology for the 21st Century M.Arch. 2013 | Master's of Architecture| Ryerson University Aamna Zaheer

Rapid social and technological change have largely influenced the way in which individuals and families inhabit their dwellings, the domestic realm. leading to new functional and formal lifestyle demands within

"The current information society is more closely linked to time than space. Its networks produce systems that are discontinuous in space but continuous in time...the most consistent systems are those capable of distributing their activities homogeneously in time, thus avoiding the concrete use." (Guallart, 2004, p.25) generation of another parallel space...specifically for one

In a time where change and transformation are omnipresent and highly influential, how can we design habitats that respond directly to the changing social order, by transforming into the appropriate space which supports the changing occupants, activities, and functions of a home? This thesis proposes a flexible housing typology, which has the changes over time.

"it is important above all to create an environment that does not prescribe people's way of life, but in which they can develop creatively and design their individual ways of living together."
Jan Krebs (source: Basics: Design & Living, 2007) TOPIC: Housing typology: the single family house as a `type' OPINION: The single-family house is morphologically stagnant in time and irresponsive to the changing socio-cultural and lifestyle advances of contemporary society. The typology should be reconsidered, and formally and functionally redefined in a manner which responds to the changing family, social and cultural lifestyle requirements of contemporary society. As a type, the single-family house type should have the inherent capacity to be `flexible' as a strategy to respond to changing conditions. DESIGN RESPONSE: A flexible housing typology for the 21st century, which adapts to the changing socio-cultural and lifestyle requirements of the occupants over time. THESIS STATEMENT: This thesis proposes a new housing typology for the 21st century, through an investigation of past models and their response to the changing cultural dynamics of society. By exploring contemporary lifestyle requirements, it will examine housing as a durable commodity redefined and capable of transformation, which has the capacity to adapt to the changing family, social and cultural conditions of contemporary society. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 1. What are the conditions of 21st century housing that demand a reconsideration of the single-family house type to be more flexible and transformable? 2. Can transformation become a new typology on its own? 3. Can architects design habitats that respond directly and immediately to the changing culture of contemporary society, by transforming spaces contained within dwellings so that these spaces may support the changing needs of occupants, and concomitant activities within the dwelling and the required functions of a home in the 21st century?

1.2 Typology in Architecture
Types have been discussed in architectural discourse by architecture. The first architectural typology developed out

numerous architectural practitioners and theoreticians who have sought to identify and define typology in relation to of the discussion on the rationalist enlightenment philosophy. According to Anthony Vidler, the architects of that time Essai sur l'architecture (1753, as cited in Güney, 2007), abbéfound in the origins of shelter the first dwelling type. In his Marc-Antoine Laugier indicates that such an understanding can be found in the model of the primitive hut. According to

of typology proposed a natural basis for architecture, which

Laugier, the primitive hut embodied rationalized elements and standards. Four trees depict the first types of columns, and boughs bend over to form the roof within a triangular the branches connecting column capitals represent beams,

form, which reflects the pediment (Figure 1.0). In this manner of architecture, and hence the principle and measure of all architecture as well. and

the primitive hut became the exemplar of all possible forms

Similar to Laugier's rationalist stance, French archaeologist architecture as an imitation of nature. His theory of type is metaphorical and is recognized by his description of "Type" theoretician Quatremére de Quincy

symbolized

in Encyclopedie Methodique of 1825. According to de Quincy,

type originates from the Greek word "typos", which expresses what one means by model, matrix, mold, and figure in relief the image of a thing to copy or imitate completely than the idea of an element which ought itself to serve as a rule for the or in bas relief. He suggests that the word type "presents less

model." (de Quincy, 1825, as cited in Vidler, 1998, p.618). De Quincy distinguishes between the notion of type and model, as it is, and type as an object after which each artist can conceive works of art with no resemblance between one and the model, while the type is more or less a vague idea, like a nucleus about which variations of forms, to which the object modified by circumstance.

and defines the model as an object that should be repeated the other. He further elaborates that all is precise and given in is susceptible, are collected in time (de Quincy, 1825, as cited

in Vidler, 1998). In this manner, he defines type as a process De Quincy's metaphorical theory of type was the first

theory introduced into modern architectural discourse. It is primarily based on three concepts: origin, transformation the origin of all architecture, de Quincy's origin refers to the and invention. Unlike the primitive hut, which posited as

understanding of type as "the general form, structure, or character distinguishing a particular type, group, or class of beings or objects" (Güney, 2007, p.6). Such a classification was aimed towards creating a practical understanding of type by

applying it to the context of use, need and custom, which refers directly to the Enlightenment idea of charactère. The notion of type as a symbol of function by virtue of a building's charactère the expressive function of a building to communicate with people and "different buildings should, by their arrangement, was first introduced into architectural theory by Germain Boffrand.

L. Durand also explored Laugier's principles, albeit through

a slightly different lens than that of de Quincy. Influenced by contemporary advancements in natural sciences, particularly those of taxonomy and descriptive geometry, Durand employed scientific methods of taxonomy for the study of building forms. He enumerated a number of inventories of building elements including pilasters, walls, foundations, etc., tout genre (1801), a kind of "typological atlas of architecture" (Kruft, 1994, as cited in Güney, 2007, p.8).

the mass-production process, and type became standardized (Vidler, 1976). Within the process of mass-production, type required repetition and hence became regarded as prototype. According to Gregotti (1985, as cited in Güney, 2007, p.9), "a production-oriented model becomes anti-specific and universally applicable and scientifically based."

Raphael Moneo presents three major themes in order to summarize the characteristics of the notion of type at the beginning of the twentieth century. These include functional determinism, the rejection of precedents in favour of pure Functionalism rejected the past as a source for knowledge, stating that context was the most important influence within

The design broke new conceptual ground as it established the notion of a new architectural type. In his article "The Production of Types", Anthony Vidler (1977) denotes type as a proposed source of unity in architecture, as an alternative to architectural programme. According to Vidler, typology provides a basis for the generation of new species of not only described by types, it is also produced through them. changes in socio-cultural activities and interactions often these activities. As time moves forward, society adapts new their lives, in a manner that best accommodates the change. typologies and models by which to operate and conduct

Although society advances and evolves, the precedents remain

stuck in time, anchored by the socio-cultural attributes of their epoch. The design process is a way of unifying the elements of a typology into a specific state that characterizes the single previously existent precedents.

The dimensions of the room are established by the size of the furniture within it, with little circulation around the periphery. The result is a long narrow room which is difficult to use for any other function, with or without the specified furniture in it.

Why do we need a new, flexible housing typology for the 21st century, and what are the considerations for such a contemporary typology?

How can architects design a new housing typology which responds to the growing population in urban areas in the developed world? Toronto has a population density of approximately 4,151

2.3 Changing Family Structures and Lifestyle Dynamics
The single family detached house in an ex-urban or suburban

setting became a symbol of homeownership throughout

the 1950s following the Second World War. The majority of post-war homes within North America were built as discrete houses for individual families. According to Malvina Reynolds' popular folk song of 1962, these houses were uniform "little boxes made of "ticky-tacky", conceived not necessarily due to a lack of imagination, but rather as a reflection of a and the impetus of the home building industry. The traditional

post war epoch of the industrial and consumer society. Since that time rapid changes within contemporary society have led to new functional and formal lifestyle demands. A new approach is to design time-based architecture, which is able to cope with such changes over time (TBA, 2007).

How can architects design effective living arrangements for contemporary family systems, in order to maximize social interaction as well as build cohesive communities within the current period of the digital age?

The word "flexible" implies very specific connotations, which often suggest a potential for movement or change. Flexibility is frequently associated with progress, and so in its literal reading "flexibility provides a convenient and immediate fix to that common architectural need to be allied to the `progressive' dominated by a list of seminal, one-off experiments that not surprising that flexibility in architecture is historically include buildings with parts that actually move, or buildings

history of modern architecture. In modern times three key

drivers influenced the development of flexible housing. The first influence came about in the 1920s as a result of the need for European social housing programmes to provide mass housing. Due to the shift in space standards, coupled with new constrained by the new minimum standards of the dwelling. methods of construction, architects were prompted to develop designs that allowed flexible usage so that users were not

a technological context based on the `Henry Ford syndrome,'

which asks `Why can't we mass-produce houses...in the same methods of production are associated to some extent with the

This relationship between flexibility and prefabrication is generally based on the idea that prefabricated components can potentially be organized in an infinite the dwelling is an inherent aspect of prefabrication.

Therefore, the ability to customise "the short-term demands of the market in terms of providing immediate client satisfaction override any consideration of how the customer might use their `product' over the longer term" (Schneider et al. 2007, p.27). Therefore, technique on its own cannot lead to inherent flexibility as it must be linked to the actual use of the house as well. iii) Participation and User Choice Beginning in the 1960s ideas pertaining to the involvement on part of the users within housing design surfaced in several

publications. It was argued that user involvement in the

design and adaptation of housing was often overlooked in

mass-produced homes; hence treating occupants as standard who believed that occupants must be given a choice within

consumers. In the late 1960s, flexibility was considered the design and personalisation of their dwellings. Hence, empowerment and participation.

Within the context of a computerized society, some contemporary examples of flexible housing tend to resolve of a viable living space to the limit of abstracting the notion of flexible space (Mostaedi, 2006).

centres remained unavailable. This continuous demand for housing, along with the popularization of the automobile, led to the eventual development of the suburbs, where land was

As more and more companies are introducing "green" and "sustainable" products, architects should propose

According to Kauffman and Remik the following smart design elements are excellent ways to ensure that a space is created

In a time where change and transformation are omnipresent and highly influential, how can architects design a new housing typology, which can respond to change through its ability to formally transform, in order to meet the demands of the changing dynamics of society? Can transformation become a new typology on its own? Can we design habitats that respond directly to the changing culture of society, by transforming into the appropriate space which support the changing occupants, activities, and functions of a home? The following questions were addressed within the design of this project:

It is important to consider certain implications of the contemporary city. The basic implication of a transformable to the other, as family needs and circumstances evolve and within the original (un-transformable/fixed) dwelling.

transformable housing typology that this thesis seeks to propose, in order to situate it within the built fabric of the house is that it eliminates the need to move from one house produce new requirements that are not fulfilled architecturally

This idea obligates the occupant within the same location, neighbourhood/community for a longer period of time than

typically experienced. Hence it is not the most appropriate option for individuals, and in some cases families, who are socio-economic factors that demand an itinerant lifestyle. On constantly switching their place of residence due to personal choice (i.e. travelling, etc.), unstable job markets, or other the opposite end of the spectrum however, there is a significant bonds and community connections/relationships, as well as an attachment to their place and dwelling of residence for long problems related to the unchanging nature of typical housing, to transform their residence to suit their changing needs. periods of time.

DESIGN 2: Moveable Activity Modules Iteration 01
Since modularity in the previous iteration did not afford a high degree of flexibility within the interior spaces, the next iteration sought to one that was not defined by rooms but rather by activity spaces. Hence the moveable activity activity areas allowing for the flexible generation develop a more flexible interior environment; modules were proposed (Refer to Section 5.0 for details). These modules act as partitions between of activity spaces, rather than prescribing a fixed room for each activity. While the modules have stuck through to the current design proposal, the problem with the initial iterations was a fixed space. Hence, the only way to accommodate across the lifetime of a family was to incorporate the moveable modules in the basement as well, allowing for more bedrooms to be added.
