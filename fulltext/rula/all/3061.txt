Abstract  
   STANDARDIZED  MEASURE  FOR     PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL  4,5-BISPHOSPHATE  BY  MASS  SPECTROMETRY  
   Jaspreet  Jawanda,  Ryerson  University,  2013,  Masters  of  Science  in  Molecular  Science            Phosphoinositides   (PIs)   play   a   fundamental   role   in   many   physiological   processes  

such   as   cell   surface   signal   transduction,   membrane   trafficking,   cytoskeleton   regulation,   nuclear  events  and  permeability  and  transport  functions  of  membranes.  Levels  of  PIs  vary   under   different   physiological   conditions   thus   PI   profiling   may   be   an   important   step   in   elucidation   of   importance   in   the   progression   towards   many   diseases.   Previous   methods   for   PI  analysis  have  several  disadvantages  in  time-constraints,  use  of  radioactive  samples  and   inconsistent   results   due   to   lack   of   sensitivity.   Mass   spectrometry   has   previously   been   utilized   to   quantify   low   abundance   peptides,   metabolites   and   lipids.   Here   we   propose   a   novel   approach   for   PI   quantitation   based   on   inositol   head   cleavage   coupled   to   high- performance   liquid-mass   spectrometry   (HPLC-MS)   to   overcome   these   issues.   First,   we   highlight  the  extraction  and  deacylation  of  PIs  from  S.  Ceravisiae,  followed  by  purification   via   reverse   phase   chromatography   with   a   Sep-Pak.   Next,   using   commercially   purchased   PI(4,5)P2  standards,     we  created  a  tune  file    which  provide  the  correct  conditions  sensitive   enough   to   identify   prolific   ion   peaks   to   be   utilized   in   characterization   of   biological   samples.   Using   the   standard   tune   file,   we   successfully   identified   and   quantitated   the   PI(4,5)P2   in   cells   lacking   INP51   which   have      2-4   fold   increase   in   PI(4,5)P2   and   comparing   them   to   the   wild  type  cells.  The  methods  described  may  form  a  basis  for  further  optimization  of  mass   spectral  based  quantitation  of  PIs.        ii

Chapter  1:  Introduction  
Advances   in   separation   technology   and   particularly   in   mass   spectrometry   have   revolutionized   the   analysis   and   quantification   of   cellular   and   tissue   lipids.   Due   to   the   collective  effort  of  the  scientific  community,  this  has  led  to  continual  growth  in  expanding   the   field   of   studying   lipids   thus,   giving   birth   to   many   databases   such   as   lipid   maps   proteome  database  (LMPD),  lipid  library,  and  lipid  bank  (Table  1.1).

Lipidome   Just  as  the  genome  is  the  complete  gene  profile  within  an  organism,  the  lipidome  is   the   complete   lipid   profile   within   a   cell.   Lipids   are   a   major   constituent   of   a   cell   and   serve   an   important   function   as   energy   reservoirs,   vital   secondary   messengers   (generated   by   a   variety   of   intracellular   enzymes)   and   formulation   of   a   cellular   membrane   (Wenk,   2005).   Lipids  are  tightly  regulated  molecules  within  cells  thus  collapse  of  the  regulatory  measures   can   have   profound   changes   within   cells.   The   effects   of   this   include   detrimental   diseases   such   as   diabetes,   obesity,   cancer   and   many   neurodegenerative   disorders   including   schizophrenia,  Alzheimer's  disease,  Parkinson's  disease,  and  Niemann-Pick  disease  (Cutler   et  al.,  2004;  Pentchev  et  al.,  1985;  Sturley  at  al.,  2004;  Wenk,  2005).   As   lipids   serve   multiple   unique   functions   within   cells,   logically,   numerous   types   exist.   Based   on   their   hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity   profiles,   lipids   can   be   classified   into   eight   different   categories:   fatty   acids,   glycerolipids,   glycerophospholipids,   sphingolipids,   sterol  lipids,  prenol  lipids,  saccharolipids,  and  polyketides  (Fahy   et   al.,  2005).  These  lipids     vary   in   molecular   composition   and   relate   by   their   solubility   in   nonpolar   organic   solvents   such   as   ether,   chloroform,   acetone   and   benzene   and   generally   their   insolubility   in   water.     The  inositol  containing  glycerophospholipids  known  as  phosphoinositides  (PI),  which  can   be  deacylated  to  form  glycerated  phosphoinositols    will  be  the  main  focus  of  this  project.     Phospholipids   Underneath   the   umbrella   of   the   lipidome,   exists   a   major   class   of   lipids   known   as   phospholipids.   Phospholipids   are   amphipathic   molecules   meaning   they   contain   both   hydrophobic   and   hydrophilic   ends.   Due   to   hydrophobic   interactions,   phospholipids   arrange  into  a  lipid  bilayer  where  the  hydrophobic  ends  are  oriented  towards  the  middle  of  

2  

the  layer    (Fig  1.1).  This  is  important  as  it  provides  a  thin  barrier  around  cells  keeping  ions,   proteins  and  any  water-soluble  molecules  from  diffusing  through  the  hydrophobic  portion   of  the  lipid  bilayer.     Phospholipids  make  up  the  largest  portion  (60%)  of  the  lipid  mass  of  the  eukaryotic   cell  membrane    (Han  et  al.,  2005).  Hence,  alterations  in  phospholipid  composition  may  lead   to   profound   changes   within   the   cell.   Phospholipids   are   important   constituents   in   cellular   membrane   formation,   cellular   signaling   and   trafficking,   intercellular   adhesion   and   cytoskeleton   support,   in   addition   to   acting   as   cellular   mediators   (Pulfer   at   al.,   2003).   Currently,   there   are   over   100   individual   molecular   species   of   phospholipids   that   can   be   distinguished  using  analytical  techniques  (Peterson  and  Cummings,  2006).   Phospholipids   are   categorized   into   multiple   classes   based   on   their   chemical   structures  with  a  nomenclature  system  based  on  the  nature  of  their  polar  head  groups  at   the   sn-3   position   (Fig   1.3)   (Fahy   et   al.,   2005;   Han   et   al.,   2005).   There   are   five   general   classes   of   phospholipids:   phosphatidylserine,   phosphatidylcholine,  

phosphatidylethanolamine,  phosphatidylsphingomyelin  and  phosphatidylinositol  (PtdIns).     The   special   characteristics   of   the   different   classes   of   phospholipids   depend   upon   the   element   attached   at   the   head   i.e.,   serine,   choline,   ethanolamine   or   inositol.   PIs   have   an   attached  myo-inositol  headgroup.  The  names  and  head  groups  attached  are  summarized  in   Fig  1.2.

A   phospholipid   consists   of   a   polar   head   group,   connected   by   a   glycerol   to   two   fatty   acid   tails.   The   polar   head   group   is   hydrophilic   while   the   fatty   acid   chains   are   hydrophobic,   repelling   water.   A   lipid   bilayer   is   formed   in   water   when   the   hydrophobic   tails   line   up   against   one   another,   forming   a   membrane   of   hydrophilic  heads  on  both  sides  facing  the  water  (Adapted  from:  Nelson,  2008).                                                       Fig   1.2:   Characterization   of   phospholipids.      Phospholipids   are   characterized   by   the   structural   element   attached   to   the   head   group   of   the   general   phospholipid   structure   which   consists   of   four   components:   fatty   acids,   a   platform   to   which   fatty   acids   are   attached;   glycerol   backbone,   a   phosphate   and   an   alcohol   attached   to   the   phosphate   (Adapted   from   Berg,  2010).   4  

Phosphatidylinositol  (PtdIns)  and  Phosphoinositides  (PIs)   The   role   of   membrane   PIs   has   extended   well   beyond   intracellular   signaling   pathways   and   now   includes   the   modulation   of   cytoskeleton   organization,   apoptosis,   and   membrane  trafficking  (Payrastre,  2001;  Corvera,  1999;  Cremona,  2001).    These  molecules   are  also  known  to  play  a  significant  role  in  the  nucleus  (Corvera,  1999).     Family   of   the   PIs   contains   the   non-phosphorylated   precursor   PtdIns   and   seven   phosphorylated   derivatives   with   different   phosphorylation   patterns   on   the   myo-inositol   ring   phosphorylated   by   specific   kinases:   phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate   (PtdIns3P),   phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate   (PtdsIns4P),   phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate  

(PtdsIns5P),   phosphatidylinositol-3-4-bisphosphate   (PtdIns(3,4)P2),   phosphatidylinositol- 3-5-bisphosphate   (PtdIns(3,5)P2),      phosphatidylinositol-4-5-bisphosphate   (PtdIns(4,5)P2),   and  phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3)  (Fig  1.3).     PI's  are  responsive  to  cellular  signals  and  metabolic  interconversions  can  generate   any   of   the   other   family   members   via   various   kinase   and   phosphatase   enzyme   processes   (Fig   1.4).   Specifically   in   mammals,   there   are   47   genes   encoding   19   phosphoinositide   kinases   and   28   phosphoinositide   phosphatases,   responsible   for   the   18   different   interconversion   reactions   known   to   date   (Sasaki   et  al.,   2009).   Understanding   the   distinct   and  overlapping  functions  of  these  phosphoinositides  is  important  to  gain  insight  into  both   normal  function  and  human  diseases.                             5  

                                                                                                                  Fig   1.3:   A)   Precursor   and   B)   derivatives   of   phosphoinositides.   A)   Structurally,   PIs  contain  a  polar  inositol  head  group  with  at  least  one  phosphate  group  on  the  sn-1  and   sn-2   position   of   a   glycerol   backbone   linked   to   a   fatty   acid   chain.   The   myo-inositol   head   group   contains   five   free   hydroxyl   groups   but   only   three   of   them   (D-3,   D-4,   and   D-5)   can   have   sequential   and   reversible   phosphorylation   by   specific   kinases.   B)   Scehmatic   representation   of   the   seven   derivatives   of   phosphoinositides.   Phosphoinositol   can   be   phosphorylated  to  form  seven  derivatives  (Adapted  from  Sasaki  et  al.,  2009).        6

Representation   of   the   metabolic   interconversions   that   generate   seven   phosphophoinositides.   These   can   be   interconverted   between   each   other   with   the   help   of   different   kinases   and   phosphatases.   The   dashed   reactions  are  yet  to  be  documented  (Adapted  from  Sasaki  et  al.,  2009).          Although   PI's   are   known   to   play   a   fundamental   role   in   many   cellular   physiological   processes   such   as   signal   transduction   at   the   cell   surface,   acquisition   of   cellular   polarity,   cytoskeletal   dynamics,   regulation   of   cellular   adhesion,   motility   and   cytokinesis,   they   represent  less  then  1%  of  lipids  in  resting  mammalian  cells  (Di  Paolo  et  al.,  2006;  Krauss  et   al.,  2007;  Odorizzi  et  al.,  2000;  Martin,  1998)  (Fig  1.5).                                               7  

                                                   Fig   1.5:   Cellular   location   of   phoshoinositides   within   the   cell.   The   schematic   figure   shows   the   subcellular   distribution   of   phosphoinositide   species.   PtdIns(4,5)2   is   primarily   localized   and   concentrated   in   cytosolic   membranes,   possibly   in   raft-like   domains.   PtdIns(4,5)2  is  also  a  key  regulator  in  aspects  of  gene  expression  (Kutateladze,  2010).        Phosphoinositide   signaling   occurs   through   binding   of   specific   domains   found   on   cytosolic   proteins   or   cytosolic   domains   of   membrane   proteins   (Lemmon,   2003;   Balla,   2005).  Proteins  interact  with  PI's  in  clusters  of  basic  residues  within  unstructured  regions   (profilin)   or   folded   modules   (PH   domain)   (Hurley,   2001).   Most   PIs   have   distinct   conserved   PI-binding  domains,  which  may  have  overlapping  specificities  such  as  the  PH,  GRAM,  ENTH,   PHD,  and  PX  (Rusten,  2006;  Lemmon,  2003;  Downes   et  al.,  2005;  Balla,  2005;  Stenmark   at   al.,   2002)   (Table   1.2).   The   presence   of   these   domains   allows   the   recruitment   of   host   proteins   to   specific   regions   within   the   cell   via   interactions   with   PIs   and   act   as   allosteric   activators  or  inhibitors  for  protein-protein  interactions  and  enzyme  activity  (Cullen   et  al.,   2001;  Hurley  and  Meyer,  2001).

Phosphoinisitde   binding   modules   and   their   reported   phosphoinisitde   binding   preferences   (Adapted   from   Di   Paolo   and   De   Camilli,   2006).        PtdIns(4,5)P2   Of   the   seven   PI   species,  this   study   focused   on   PtdIns(4,5)P2  (Fig   1.6).      PtdIns(4,5)P2,   has   been   shown   to   be   localized   within   the   plasma   membrane   and   nucleus   in   high   concentrations   (Aikawa   and   Martin,   2003).   Additionally,   it's   involved   in   endocytosis   and   cytoskeletal  dynamics  by  binding  to  proteins  with  PH  and  ENTH  domains  (Raucher   et  al.,   2000).     9  

                                                   Fig   1.6:   Structure   and   roles   of   PtdIns(4,5)P2.   PtdIns(4,5)P2    is  important  in  many  cellular   processes   such   as   cell   survival,   gating   of   ion   channels   and   transporter,   vesicle   trafficking   and  actin  cytoskeleton  remodeling  (Adapted  from  Krauss  and  Haucke,  2007).          PtdIns(4,5)P2   is   predominantly   synthesized   by   type   I   phosphatidylinositol   4- phosphate  5-kinases  using  PtdIns(4)P  as  a  precursor  (Fig  1.7).  As  a  signaling  molecule,  via   the  catalytic  action  of  phosphoinositide  phospholipase  C  (PLC),  PtdIns(4,5)P2  is  hydrolyzed   into   two   secondary   messengers:   inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate   (Ins(1,4,5)P3)   and   diacylglycerol   (DAG)   (Delage   et   al.,   2013).   Additionally,   PI(4,5)P2   can   be   further   phosphorylated  by  class    I  PI  3-kinase  to  form  PtdIns(3,4,5)P3     that  activates  downstream   signaling   components   important   in   cell   survival   and   growth   (Delage   et   al.,   2013).   Both   PI(4)P  and  PI(5)P  are  precursors  for  PI(4,5)P2.     PtdIns(4,5)P2  mediated  signaling  events  are  initiated  by  specific  PI  kinases  and  are   terminated  in  part  by  a  family  of  PI  5-phosphatases  (5-Pases).  PI  5-Pases  regulate  cellular   levels  of  PtdIns(4,5)P2  by  removing  the  phosphate  at  the  D5  position  of  the  inositol  head   group  (Majerus  et  al.,  1999).  Several  mammalian  5-Pases  have  been  identified  thus  far  with   various   substrate   specificities   for   PtdIns(4,5)P2,   PtdIns(3,4,5)P3   ,and   soluble   inositol   10  

phosphates   (Stefan   et   al.,   2002).   Four   PI   5-Pases   are   present   in   the   yeast   Saccharomyces   cerevisiae.   Three   enzymes,   Sjl1p,   Sjl2p,   and   Sjl3p   (also   named   Inp51p,   Inp52p,   and   Inp53p),  contain  a  Sac1-like  domain  and  a  5-Pase  domain  (Stefan  et  al.,  2002).  Consistent   with  these  in  vitro  activities,  deletion  of  SJL1  leads  to  an  increase  in  cellular  PtdIns(4,5)P2   levels  whereas  double  deletion  of  SJL2  and  SJL3  causes  an  increase  in  PtdIns(3,5)P2  levels   in  vivo  (Stefan  et  al.,  2002).

The  metabolic  pathway  is  represented  showing  the  interconversion  of  the   different   phosphoinsitides.   Lipid   kinases   phosphorylate   the   inositol   ring   at   specific   positions  to  form  more  highly  phosphorylated  forms  such  as  PtdIns(4,5)P2,  while  the  lipid   phosphatases   dephosphorylate   the   inositol   ring.   Question   marks   indicate   speculative   pathways  for  which  no  enzyme  has  been  identified  (Skwarek  and  Boulianne,  2009).                 11  

PI  Quantitation      Alterations   in   PI's   levels   can   significantly   impact   cellular   behaviour.   In   humans,   inappropriate   changes   may   manifest   as   diseases   such   as   Alzheimer's,   atherosclerosis,   diabetes,   obesity,   and   even   cancer   (Skwarek   and   Boulianne,   2009).   Thus,   the   ability   to   quantitate  and  quantify  the  levels  of  PI's  within  biological  samples  may  lead  to  progression   in  identifying  important  biomarkers  for  such  diseases.  Investigating  lipid  species  that  are   localized   within   distinct   parts   of   the   cell   can   provide   insight   into   areas   such   as   antibody   production,   protein/enzyme   interactions,   drug/inhibitor   interactions,   specific   metabolite   pathways   and   finally   differentiating   between   healthy   vs.   disease   state   cells   (Harkewicz   and   Dennis,  2011;  Rusten  and  Stenmark,  2006).     Despite  technological  advancements,  the  quantitation  of  PIs  has  been  at  a  stalemate.   Previously,   PIs  analysis   has   involved   a)   metabolic   labeling   with   3H-inositol   or   organic   32P   followed  by  head  group  hydrolysis  and  chromatographic  separation  of  PIs,  b)  transfection   with   fluorescent   proteins   such   as   Green   Fluorescent   protein   (GFP)   followed   by   fluorescence   for   affector   proteins   of   PIs,   and   c)   direct   labeling   of   fixed   cells   with   recombinant   PIs   binding   domains   or   antibodies   directed   against   specific   PIs   (Rusten   and   Stenmark,   2006;   Kiefer   et   al.,   2010;   Wakelam   and   Clark,   2011).      These   techniques   are   thought   to   be   disadvantageous,   as   they   present   time-constraints,   utilize   radioactive   samples   and   provide   overall   inconsistent   results   due   to   lack   of   sensitivity   thus,   not   providing   the   exact   relative   content   of   PIs   in   a   cellular   extract.   Although   there   is   clear   evidence   of   the   importance   of   PIs,   there   has   been   limited   improvement   and   progress   in   determining   the   cellular   amounts   and   distinguishing   individual   species   (structural   differences)   of   these   complex   phospholipids.   A   fundamental   reason   for   this   is   the   low  

12  

concentration   of   PI's   relative   to   other   phospholipids   in   the   cell   coupled   with   loss   occurring   during  extraction  due  to  binding  of  the  highly  charged  head  groups  to  surfaces  frequently   used  in  lipid  extraction  and  separation  (protein  bound  during  extraction  process).     With   the   progress   in   studying   lipids,   the   application   of   mass   spectroscopy   may   resolve   some   of   the   issues   highlighted   above.   Mass   spectrometry   has   previously   been   utilized   to   quantify   low   abundance   peptides,   metabolites   and   lipids   (Wenk,   2005).   Previously,   it   has   also   been   able   to   distinguish   between   the   various   phospholipids   in   biological  samples.  This  may  enable  complete  profiling  of  all  phospholipids,  both  major  and   minor,  from  a  single  sample  within  a  single  analytical  run    (Kiefer  et  al.,  2010).     Mass  Spectrometry  of  PI's   Mass   spectrometry   (MS)   is   a   powerful   analytical   tool   that   can   be   used   for   the   quantitative   (concentration)   and   qualitative   (structural)   analysis   of   phospholipids   including   glycerophospholipids   and   sphingomyelin   (Ho   et   al.,   2003).   Here,   molecules   of   interest   are   first   introduced   into   the   ionization   source   where   they   pass   through   a   high   voltage  of  approximately  5  kV  forming  either  a  negative  or  positive  charge.  Depending  on   the   target   mass   to   charge   ratio   (mass   of   the   ion   on   the   atomic   scale   divided   by   the   number   of   charges   that   the   ion   carries;   m/z),   the   ions   arrive   at   different   parts   of   the   detector,     finally  the  computer  system  assembles  a  mass  spectrum  showing  the  relative  abundance  of   the  signals.  A  MS  typically  consists  of  four  components:  an  inlet  for  sample  injection,  the  ion   source,  the  mass  analyzer  and  an  ion  detector  (Fig  1.8).    However,  samples  injected  into  the   MS  need  to  be  entirely  pure  and  clean  in  order  to  eliminate  false  positives  or  background   noise   that   might   otherwise   alter   the   results.   Hence,   there   are   various   separation   and   purification  steps  taken  prior  to  injection  into  the  source  head  (Fig  1.9).

Ion  source  produces  gaseous  ions  from  the   substances   being   studied.   Analyzer   resolves   the   ions   into   their   characteristic   mass   components  according  to  their  mass-to-charge  ratio.  Detector  system  detects  the  ions  and   records  the  resolved  ionic  species.  Finally,  the  computer  produces  a  chromatogram  of  the   results  (Adapted  from  Harkewicz,  2011).                                                    Fig  1.9:  Extraction  and  recovery  of  phosphoinisitides.     The  above  procedure  provides  a   very   high   extraction   recovery   from   a   variety   of   biological   matrices   and   enable   chromatographic  resolution  of  most  deacylated  phosphoinositdes.        14  

Lipid  Sample  Preparation  Techniques   Analysis   of   PIs   through   MS   has   been   very   difficult   due   to   the   large   variety   of   PIs   present.  This  is  due  to  the  complex  nature  of  these  molecules  that  are  also  closely  similar  in   composition   and   mass   isomers.   There   have   been   two   fundamental   approaches   in   quantitation   and   differentiation   of   these   isomers   by   MS.   The   first   method   employs   direct   infusion  (also  known  as  the  shot  gun  approach)  of  a  biological  sample  into  the  MS  (Milne  et   al.,   2005;   Pulfer   and   Murphy,   2003;   Wenk   et   al.,   2003;   Postle   et   al.,   2007;   Ejsing   et   al.,   2006).  This  results  in  comprehensive  profiling  of  all  intact  PIs  in  the  test  sample.  Although   less   time-consuming,   this   approach   results   in   extremely   complex   spectra   due   to   the   plethora   of   closely   related   lipids   that   only   vary   by   their   lipid   moieties.   Consequently,   till   date,  only  lipids  in  platelets  have  been  identified  using  this  approach  since  platelets  exhibit   a  far  lower  level  of  complexity  for  their  PI's  (Pettitt,  2006;  Wakelam  and  Clark,  2011).  An   alternative  to  direct  infusion  involves  the  analysis   of  the  head  group  following  the  cleavage   from   the   lipid   moiety   and   separation   of   the   inositol   head   groups   by   HPLC   (Kiefer   et   al.,   2010)  (Fig  1.10).     Deacylation  of  Lipids   With   deacylation,   much   of   the   complexity   in   analysis   using   the   shotgun   approach   can  be  eliminated  thus  providing  a  more  suitable  approach  if  the  focus  lies  on  the  changes   of  phosphorylation  pattern  of  the  head  group  within  cells.    The  head  group  analysis  method   involves   the   deacylation   of   the   lipids   by   cleaving   the   lipid   chains   producing   glycerated   inositol  head  groups  (Fig  1.10).  The  reaction  is  an  O-N-transacylation  with  N-methyl  fatty   acid  amides  being  formed  using  methylamine  (Clarke  and  Dawson,  1981).

The   above   representation   shows   a   structure   of   a   phosphoinositide   and   the  deacylation  steps,  which  results  in  the  cleavage  of  the  lipid  moiety.  Methylamine  acts  as   a   nucleophile   breaking   the   acyl   bond   and   releasing   the   fatty   acid   chain.   The   reaction   is   primarily   an   O-N-transacylation   with   N-methyl   fatty   acid   amides   being   formed   with   an   alcohol.      Lipid  Extraction   Liquid-liquid  extraction  (LLE)   Extraction   of   PI's   for   analysis   requires   cell   lysis   and   separation   from   other   biomolecules   that   might   interfere   with   the   chromatography   steps.   Extraction   of   PIs   has   been   performed   by   two   different   methods:   a)   solid-phase   extraction   (SPE)   or   b)   liquid- liquid  extraction  (LLE).  Given  the  diversity  of  phospholipids,  there  has  to  be  a  number  of   extraction  steps  in  order  to  purify  the  lipids  of  interest.   Quantitative   isolation   of   lipids   from   non-lipid   contaminants   must   be   accomplished   before  analysis  is  attempted.    This  is  where  the  use  of  appropriate  solvent  systems  is  vital   for   the   extraction   of   lipids   from   a   biological   milieu.   LLE   consists   of   placing   the   biological   extracts  into  two  immiscible  liquids,  which  will  ultimately  form  two  separate  phases.  The

Bligh  and  Dyer  method  is  one  of  the  most  common  extraction  procedure  used  for  lipids  as   it   provides   optimum   yield   of   representative   lipids   (Fig   1.11).      This   method   consists   of   a   solvent   system   of   methanol,   water   and   chloroform.   This   produces   a   biphasic   system   containing   the   chloroform   layer   that   contains   the   lipids   and   the   MeOH   and   water   layer   containing  the  additional  cellular  extract  (Folch,  1957;  Bligh,  1959).      

   Fig   1.11:   Bligh   and   Dyer   Method.   Lipids   are   extracted   by   the   Bligh   and   Dyer   method.   The   biological   cell   extract   is   diluted   with   water   and   chloroform   to   achieve   a   biphasic  system  (chloroform/methanol/water).  The  upper  methanol-water  layer  contains   the   non-lipids   such   as   salts   and   sugars   whereas   the   chloroform   contains   the   lipids.      Cell   debris  and  protein  are  pelleted  at  the  bottom  of  the  tube.        Deacylated   lipids   producing   highly   polar   head   groups   can   be   extracted   using   a   similar   LLE   method.   In   this   system,   the   inositol   head   groups   are   extracted   through   the   aqueous  layer.     Solid  Phase  Extraction  (SPE)   An   alternative   separation   method   of   phospholipids,   SPE   consists   of   a   solid   phase   and   a   liquid   phase   which   allows   the   separation   of   phospholipids   based   on   their   chemical   properties  (Fig  1.12).           17  

                           Fig   1.12:   General   elution   protocol   for   reverse   phase   chromatography   on   Sep-Pak   cartridges  C18.   The   bonded   phase   is   solvated   and   then   the   sample   is   loaded.   The   cartridge   is  washed  with  water  to  elute  the  unwanted  components.  Progressively  stronger  solvents   can  be  used  to  elute  components  of  interest  (Waters  Sep  Pak  manual).           The  solid  phase  utilizes  a  cartridge  consisting  of  an  adsorbent  support  material  like   silica  whereas  the  liquid  phase  consists  of  various  concentrations  of  organic  solvents  that   are   used   to   elute   out   the   phospholipids   from   the   column,   based   on   their   chemical   or   structural  properties  (methanol,  chloroform  or  hexane).  This  method  is  usually  best  used   for   further   purification   of   small   sample   sizes   as   too   large   of   a   sample   can   saturate   the   column   entirely,   hence   reducing   the   recovery   of   the   phospholipid   of   interest.   Once   the   lipids  are  extracted  they  can  be  further  separated  to  obtain  the  phospholipid  of  choice.        Thin  Layer  Chromatography  (TLC)             The  term  thin  layer  chromatography  is  used  to  describe  a  technique  in  which  mixtures  of   different   compounds   are   separated   into   individual   substances   using   a   stationary   phase   consisting   of   C18   silica   bound   to   an   aluminum   plate   and   a   mobile   phase   that   is   drawn   by   capillary   action.      In   the   field   of   lipids,   TLC   is   classically   used   for   routine   separations,   18  

identification   of   the   individual   lipids   and   their   quantitative   determinations   (Fuchs   et   al.,   2011).      Lipid  Separation   Lipids   can   be   separated   based   on   their   physical   and   chemical   properties   using   chromatography,  a  method  commonly  used  to  separate  mixtures  based  on  various  factors   such   as   polarity   and   molecular   mass   (similar   principle   used   in   SPE).   Chromatography   consists   of   a   stationary   and   a   mobile   phase.   A   variety   of   chromatographic   methods   such   as   gas   chromatography   (GC),   thin   layer   chromatography   (TLC))   and   high-pressure   liquid   chromatography  (HPLC)  can  be  used  for  the  separation  of  phospholipids.  However,  HPLC   using   reverse   phase   chromatography   is   considered   the   most   efficient   chromatography   method   to   separate   deacylated   and   non-deacylated   PIs   (Peterson   and   Cummings,   2006).     Reverse   phase   chromatography   is   a   method   that   uses   a   hydrophobic   stationary   phase,   which  is  produced  by  the  alkyl  chains  covalently  bonded  to  the  solid  support  (3-5  m  silica   beads)  (Fig  1.13).  Separation  in  reverse  phase  chromatography  occurs  due  to  the  different   binding   properties   of   the   solutes   present   in   the   sample,   as   a   result   of   their   differences   in   polarity.   The   use   of   a   polar   mobile   phase   allows   the   deacylated   glycerated   inositol   head   groups   to   be   separated   from   the   non-polar   molecules   and   eluted   out   quickly   from   the   column  finally,  forming  a  mass  spectrum.                       19  

                                                         Fig   1.13:   Reverse   phase   chromatography.  Reverse  phase  chromatography  consists  of  a   hydrophobic  stationary  phase  with  a  polar  mobile  phase  allowing  sufficient  separation  of   hydrophilic  molecules.  The  hydrophilic  molecules  elute  out  quicker.  The  stationary  phase   consists   of   C18   ligands,   which   are   highly   hydrophobic.   This   allows   a   strong   interaction   between   non-polar   molecules   allowing   polar   molecules   to   pass   through   the   column   and   produce   a   mass   spectrum   (Adapted   from   Peterson,   2006).   This   is   used   a   means   of   separating  the  polar  heads  from  hydrophobic  tails.                                      Fig  1.14:  Mass  Spectrum  showing  retention  time  of  deacylated  PI  standards  focusing   on   parent   peaks   of   specific   PIs   (PtdIns:   333mz,   PtdInsP:   413mz,   PtdInsP2:   493,   PtdInsP3:   573m/z).   Stationary   phase   consist   of   a   C18   column.   Mobile   A:   H2O(+5mM   dimethylhexylamine   (DMHA),   solvent   B:   acetonitrile   (+5mM   DMHA).   Gradient:   0.1%B   to   50%B  in  25  min.  (extracted  image  from  Kiefer   et   al.,  2010).  More  OH  groups  the  molecule   contains,  the  more  polar  it  is,  thus  the  faster  it  eluted  out  from  the  column  as  distinguished   in  this  image.  DMHA  is  used  as  an  ion-pairing  buffer.     20  

There  are  two  types  of  column  solute  elution  systems  that  can  be  used  in  HPLC:  a)   isocratic  flow  and  b)  gradient  elution.  Isocratic  elution  is  a  separation  method,  where  the   mobile   phase   composition   remains   constant   throughout   the   experiment.   The   gradient   elution  method  involves  a  change  in  composition  of  the  mobile  phase  during  the  separation   of  different  molecules.  Due  to  the  various  classes  of  PIs,  choice  of  mobile  phase  is  critical  in   order  to  help  elute  the  derivatives  at  different  times.    Hence,  a  gradient  elution  is  preferred   over   an   isocratic   flow.   The   mobile   phase   varies   depending   on   the   polarity   of   the   analyte.   The   mobile   phase   of   a   gradient   flow   solvent   can   begin   with   a   high   polarity   (water   90%:   MeOH   10%),   and   gradually   decrease   in   polarity   eluting   out   the   less   polar   molecules   molecules,   as   seen   in   Fig   1.14.   Retention   time   (time   it   takes   molecule   to   elute   from   column   and   reach   mass   detector)   will   vary   for   the   various   deacylated   PIs   due   to   the   number   of   OH   groups   present   on   the   inositol   head.   Once   eluted   from   the   column,   the   deacylated   PtdIns   are  subjected  to  MS  where  a  chromatogram  is  produced  by  the  computer.        Lipid  Detection     Ion  Source:  Electrospray  Ionization  (ESI)   Once  the  lipids  are  separated,  they  are  subjected  to  MS  through  the  ion  source  head.   There   are   numerous   types   of   ionization   methods   used   such   as   electron   ionization   (EI),   fast   atom   bombardment   (FAB),   matrix-assisted   laser   desorption   ionization   (MALDI),   and   electrospray  ionization  (ESI)  (El-Aneed  et  al.,  2009).     Developed  in  1989  by  John  Fenn,  ESI  transforms  analytes  in  solution  into  ions  in  the   gas   phase   (Fenn   et   al.,   1989;   Bruins,   1991).      ESI   has   been   especially   important   for   mass   analysis  of  polar  compounds  such  as  biological  polymers  (for  example,  proteins,  peptides,  

21  

glycoproteins,   and   nucleotides),   pharmaceuticals   and   their   metabolites;   and   industrial   polymers   (for   example,   polyethylene   glycols)   (Ho   et  al.,   2003).   Essentially   ESI   is   ideal   for   analysis   of   PIs   due   to   its   superior   sensitivity,   and   with   abilities   to   detect   analytes   at   very   low  concentrations.  (Zhu  et  al.,  2010).   The  solvent  carrying  the  analyte  is  eluted  through  the  column,  to  the  source  head,   passing   through   a   narrow   orifice,   creating   a   spray   to   which   a   high   voltage   (3-5Kv)   is   applied   (Fig   1.15).   This   process   creates   a   fine   mist   of   droplets   that   are   charged   at   their   surface.   As   the   solvent   evaporates,   the   electrical   charge   density   reaches   a   critical   point   where   the   droplets   divide   into   smaller   droplets   due   to   the   electrostatic   repulsion   being   greater   than   the   surface   tension   (Ho   et   al.,   2003;   Bruins,   1991).   After   this   process   is   repeated   numerous   times,   the   highly   charged   ions   are   injected   into   the   gas   phase   by   electrostatic   repulsion.   Depending   on   the   molecule   of   interest,   the   ESI   probe   can   be   used   either   in   the   positive   or   negative   polarity   mode.   Negative   ions   have   lost   a   proton   and   positive   ions   have   gained   a   proton.   Some   of   the   factors   that   impact   the   quality   of   electrospray  are  droplet  size,  liquid  surface  tension,  surface  charge,  ion  solvation  strength   and  finally  solvent  volatility.

   Fig   1.15:   Electrospray   Ionization.   A   soft   ionization   technique   used   to   determine   the  weights  of  proteins,  peptides  and  biological  macromolecules.  The  molecules  are  being   ionized   into   smaller   droplets   where   they   are   further   desolvated   into   smaller   droplets.   These   can   be   passed   through   mass   analyzer   to   the   detector   where   the   samples   can   be   analyzed  (FinniganTM    LTQTM  Getting  started  manual).        Additionally,  the  type  of  solvent  used  can  have  a  profound  impact  on  the  quality  of   electrospray.   Solutions   compatible   with   the   MS   are   organic/aqueous   solvents   (methanol,   acetonitrile   (AcN),   isopropyl   alcohol),   volatile   acids   (acetic   acid,   formic   acid)   and   bases   (ammonium   acetate,   ammonium   formate)   (FinniganTM      LTQTM   Getting   started   manual).     The  ions  then  pass  through  the  ion  transfer  capillary  where  they  are  further  detected  based   on  their  m/z  ratio.                23  

Mass  Analyzer:    Linear  Ion  Trap   Once  the  molecules  of  interest  are  ionized,  they  are  further  analyzed  based  on  their   m/z   by   a   mass   analyzer.   The   linear   ion   trap   quadrupole   mass   filter   manipulates   direct   current   and   radio   frequency   potentials   in   order   to   select   and   filter   for   the   masses   of   interest   (Fig   1.16).      This   was   first   described   in   1950   by   Paul   Wolfgang   (El-Aneed   et   al.,   2009).                              Fig   1.16:   Operation   of   a   quadrupole   mass   analyzer.   The   ion   (M+)   travels   from   the   source,  through  the  four  metal  rods  arranged  parallel  to  each  other  and  finally  reaching  the   detector  (Adapted  from  El-Aneed  et  al.,  2009).        The   quadrupole   mass   analyzer   consists   of   four   rods   placed   parallel   to   each   other.   Ions  are  separated  based  on  their  trajectories  in  the  oscillating  electric  fields  (Banerjee  and   Mazumdar,   2011).      Only   ions   carrying   a   specific   m/z   will   reach   the   detector   after   they   pass   down   the   length   of   the   quadrupoles.   The   direct   current   (DC)   and   radio   frequency   (RF)   voltages   can   be   set   so   that   the   amplitudes   of   oscillation   for   the   desired   m/z   ration   are   stable   with   the   ions   travelling   along   the   z-axis,   reaching   the   detector.   Ions   carrying   unstable   trajectories   will   collide   and   fall   off   the   rods   not   allowing   them   to   reach   the   detector.   Some   of   the   major   advantages   of   using   a   quadrupole   mass   analyzer   are   the   low   cost,  small  size,  and  the  ease  of  maintenance  (Banerjee  and  Mazumdar,  2011).

To   obtain   a   substantial   amount   of   structural   information   about   a   specific   analyte,   tandem   MS/MS   can   be   used   where   parent   ions   produced   by   the   ion   source   are   further   fragmented  by  collision  with  helium  (buffer  gas)  in  the  mass  analyzer  resulting  in  product   ions   (also   known   as   collision-induced   dissociation;   CID;   Jennings,   1968).   This   requires   multiple  mass  analyzers  to  be  connected  in  a  series  (Fig  1.17).    

   Fig   1.17:   Representation   of   Tandem   Mass   Spectrometry   (MS/MS).   Simplest   form   of   fragmentation   in   mass   spectrometry   is   the   ionization   of   the   parent   ion   to   form   product   ions.   To   obtain   more   detail   information   of   the   analyte   of   interest   would   be   to   combine   two   mass   spectrometers.   The   first   mass   spectrometer   is   used   to   select   a   single       (parent)  ion  that  is  a  characteristic  of  a  given  analyte  in  a  mixture.  The  mass-selected  ions   pass   through   a   region   where   they   are   activated   that   causes   them   to   fall   apart   to   produce   fragment   (product)   ions.   This   is   done   by   colliding   the   ions   with   a   neutral   gas   such   as   helium,   process   known   as   collision   induced   dissociation   (CID).   The   second   mass   spectrometer   is   used   to   separate   the   fragment   ions   according   to   mass.   The   resulting   MSMS   spectrum   consists   only   of   product   ions   from   the   selected   precursor   or   previous   product   ions.  (Adapted  from  Banerjee  and  Mazumdar,  2011).        The   first   analyzer   is   responsible   for   the   isolation   of   the   ions,   while   the   second   analyzer  (collision  cell)  is  responsible  for  ion  fragmentation,  and  finally  the  third  separates   fragmented   ions   based   on   their   m/z   values.   This   technique   enables   the   user   to   obtain   a   considerable   amount   of   structural   information   about   the   unknown   molecule   (Banerjee,   2011).            

25  

Computational  Analysis  of  MS  data      Following  the  mass  analysis,  a  mass  spectrum  output  yields  a  spectrum  containing  

the   fragment   ion   peaks   (Fig   1.18).   Peaks   represent   the   ions   that   are   formed   in   the   mass   spectrometer;  the  most  intense  of  which  is  known  as  the  base  peak.    Using  the  base  peak  as   100%   abundance,   the   relative   abundance   of   other   ions   is   shown.   Once   a   mixture   of   phospholipids   is   subjected   to   the   mass   spectrometer   from   a   biological   sample,   it   generates   spectra  with  hundreds  to  thousands  of  peaks  associated  with  the  molecular  ions  present  in   the   sample.   In   lipid   extracts,   these   peaks   represent   ions   from   phospholipids,   buffer   ions   and  contaminants.  Hence,  it  is  vital  to  ensure  precise  purification  and  separation  steps  are   completed  prior  to  injection  in  order  to  limit  the  contaminant  peaks.    PIs  as  well  as  other   lipids   can   be   identified   through   their   m/z   values,   or   through   their   CID   fragments   providing   a  fingerprint  for  the  PIs.  Peaks  can  be  further  confirmed  by  using  lipid  databases  such  as   Lipid   Library,   Lipid   Bank,   Lipidat,   and   Lipid   Maps   to   name   a   few,   as   seen   in   Table   1.2.   A   comprehensive   classification   system   for   lipids   provides   an   overview   of   these   lipid   molecules   and   their   structures.   The   goal   of   these   lipid   databases   is   to   characterize   lipids   and   to   identify   new   ones,   to   quantitate   level   changes   of   lipids   within   cellular   metabolism   and  to  establish  dynamic  lipid  networks.                  Fig   1.18:   Chromatogram   of   a   glycerated   PI.   Graphical   representation   of   the   relative   abundance  of  ions  intensity  versus  the  m/z  ratios     26  

   Quantitation  of  PIs   Once  the  structures  of  PIs  have  been  identified,  it  is  critical  to  quantitate  the  levels   of  PIs  present  within  a  normal  cell  versus  a  disease  state  cell.  Initially,  it  is  best  to  start  off   with   an   internal   standard,   which   acts   as   a   control   for   extraction   efficiency   in   order   to   compensate  for  losses  during  sample  preparation,  low  abundance  PI  species  of  interest  and   variable  detection  sensitivity  of  the  MS.  The  structure  of  an  ideal  internal  standard  should   resemble  the  analyte  by  its  physiochemical  properties,  and  in  some  practices,  it  is  best  to   synthesize   an   internal   standard   by   incorporating   stable   isotopes   on   the   molecules   of   interest   (Ho   et   al.,   2003).   Currently,   there   are   a   limited   number   of   internal   standards   available.   Another   factor   that   is   important   to   consider   is   that   biological   samples   give   off   significantly   lower   ionization   signals   compared   to   pure   standard   solutions   with   the   same   concentrations   (Ho   et   al.,   2003).   This   could   be   due   to   the   high   concentrations   of   non- volatile  materials  from  biological  samples  present  in  the  sample  subjected  to  the  MS  with   the   analyte.   Thus,   extensive   purification   processes   are   required,   where   HPLC   is   an   ideal   method  to  separate  the  non-volatile  compounds  from  the  analyte.     Once   the   sample   is   prepared,   the   conditions   of   analysis   on   MS   need   to   be   optimized   in   order   to   quantitate   the   deacylated   PtdIns(4,5)P2.   Once   optimal   settings   are   found,   concentrations   of   the   biological   samples   subjected   into   the   MS   need   to   considered.      Very   high  concentrations  show  ion  suppression  effects.   It   has   been   shown   that   molecules   with   higher   mass   will   suppress   the   signal   of   smaller   molecules   and   that   more   polar   analytes   are   more   susceptible   to   suppression   (Annesley,   2003).   Serial   dilutions   (or   using   smaller  

27  

injection  volumes)  are  made  to  ensure  that  the  response  lies  on  the  linear  part  of  the  graph   (Fig  1.19).  If  this  is  not  the  case,  the  response  may  be  saturated  or  suppressed.                          Fig  1.19:  Range  to  achieve  optimum  results.   Anywhere  below  or  above  the  dotted  lines,   the  intensity  may  be  either  too  low  or  too  high  causing  either  too  low  of  a  signal  or  broad   peaks  and  over  saturation.        S.  cerevisiae  as  a  model  organism   Saccharomyces  cerevisae   (fungus,   yeast,   eukaryote)   is   an   ideal   model   organism   for   the   study   of   PI's   due   to   extensive   research   on   lipids.   Importantly,   yeast   functions   and   regulatory   mechanisms   appear   co-related   in   humans.   The   lipid   profiling   in   S.  cerevisiae   has   been  extensively  researched  with  a  plethora  of  mutant  strains  that  affect  PI  concentration,   such   as   Fig4   (30-50%   decrease   in   PtdIns(3,5)P2,      and   Fab1   (necessary   for   synthesis   of   PI(3,5)P2)  (Botelho  et  al.,  2008).      Clinical  Studies  of  PIs   Optimizing   MS   conditions   to   quantitate   and   differentiate   between   different   PIs   isomers   is   of   extreme   importance   since   PIs   have   been   implicated   in   almost   all   aspects   of   cell   physiology   (Di   Paolo   and   De   Camillo,   2006).   This   research   may   lead   to   therapeutic

targets  to  treat  diseases  epidemic  to  the  world  (Pendaries,  2003;  Nicot  and  Laporte,  2008).   Metabolism  of  PIs  is  highly  controlled.  The  strict  regulation  present  within  cellular  signals   allows   the   PI's   to   proceed   with   the   normal   functions   within   the   cells.   Any   disruption   or   alterations  in  this  signaling  mechanism  can  lead  to  detrimental  diseases.  The  discovery  and   the  functional  characterization  of  PI's  (Dove  et  al.,  1997;Rameh  et  al.,  1997),  PtdIns-binding   proteins   (Lemmon,   2003;Balla,   2005),   and   PI-metabolizing   enzymes   (Majerus   et   al.,   1999;Odorizzi   et   al.,  2000;  Roth,  2004)  have  dramatically  advanced  the  field  of  lipidomics   due   to   the   large   role   they   play   in   regular   and   irregular   cellular   processes   such   as   cell   survival,   apoptosis,   phagocytosis,   cancer,   diabetes,   cardiovascular   and   neurodegenerative   diseases  (Forrest  et  al.,  2013;  Ghigo  et  al.,  2012;  Bothmer  and  Jolles,  1994).     Objectives        Previous  studies  (Wakelam  and  Clarke,  2011)  have  shown  the  chromatographic  resolution   of  PIs  at  their  native  structures.  However,  due  to  the  complexity  of  these  lipids,  there  are  a   number  of  issues  that  complicate  PI  analysis  by  MS  including  the  very  low  concentration  of   the  PIs  relative  to  other  phospholipids,  most  are  protein  bound  making  the  extraction   process  more  difficult,  and  due  to  their  highly  polar  head  groups,  product  recovery  is   limited.  Due  to  these  reasons,  it  has  become  very  difficult  to  measure  the  levels  of  PIs  using   traditional  quantitation  methods.  We  hypothesize,  that  the  procedure  described  below  will   provide  high  recovery  of  PtdIns(4,5)P2,  and  when  coupled  with  MSMS-ESI,  we  will  be  able   to  quantify  PtdIns(4,5)P2  from  both  wild  type  and  INP51mutant  S.  cerevisae  yeast  cells.   This  technique  could  be  useful  to  help  analyze  cellular  processes  with  more  detail  and   target  diseases  such  as  cancer,  obesity,  and  other  neurodegenerative  diseases.     The  goal  is  to  progress  towards  development  of  a  method  to  quantitate  PIs  through  MS.  

29

Be  able  to  use  the  Tune  file  (which  is  a  file  containing  the  optimum  MS   settings  to  check  for  the  sensitivity  and  detection  levels  of  deacylated   PI(4,5)P2)  from  the  standard  against  the  biological  sample   i. Presence  of  the  parent  ion  peak  in  selected  ion  monitoring  (SIM)   mode   c. Run  the  Biological  sample  with  different  dilutions  and  observe  if  the  peak   intensity  increases/decreases  depending  on  the  different  dilutions  (SIM)   d. Compare  wild  type  Gro(4,5)2  levels  to  the  mutant  INP51  yells.  Mutant  cells  in   this  case  are  thought  to  have  2-4  times  more  PtdIns(4,5)P2  compared  to  the   wild  type.

Chapter  2:  Materials  and  Methods  
Sample  Preparation   Yeast  Cell  Growth     S.cerevisiae   SEY   6210   yeast   cells   were   grown   in   a   yeast-peptone   media   (YP)   overnight  to  an  OD600  of  0.6.  The  tubes  were  centrifuged  (107,  2,  500  rpm,  10  min)  to  pellet.   Once   the   supernatant   was   discarded,   1mL   of   1x   yeast   nitrogen   base   (YNB)   was   re- suspended   with   the   pellet.   The   tubes   were   spun   at   2,500   rpm   for   10   min,   supernatant   discarded,  and  the  pellet  was  re-suspended  in  500  L  of  selective  drop-out  (SD)  media.     Yeast  cell  homogenization  and  PI  extraction  using  Bligh  and  Dyer  method   107  yeast  cells  were  centrifuged  at  220Ãg,  for  3  min  to  pellet  cells.  The  supernatant   was   discarded   and   the   cells   were   resuspended   in   1   mL   ice   cold   0.25M   methanolic   HCl.   The   sample   was   transferred   to   a   2   mL   glass   homogenizer   and   fully   homogenized.   The   sample   was   transferred   to   a   15   mL   polypropylene   tube.   The   remaining   sample   in   the   homogenizer   was   rinsed   out   with   2   mL   0.25M   methanolic   HCl/chloroform   (1:1)   and   repeated   with   3   mL   chloroform.   The   sample   was   vortexed   for   30   sec,   followed   by   sonication   in   an   ice-cold   bath   for  10  minutes.  The  sample  was  split  into  two  layers  via  the  addition  of  1.5  mL  split  phase   buffer   (0.25M   HCl,   2mM   EDTA,   5mM   tetrabutykammonium   hydrogen   sulphate   (TBAHS)   and   0.9%   NaCl).   The   sample   was   vortexed   for   30   seconds,   sonicated   in   an   ice   bath   for   5   minutes   and   incubated   on   ice   for   an   additional   10   minutes.   The   sample   was   neutralized   by   centrifugation   at   250xg   for   5   min   and   transferred   to   a   tube   containing   1.5   mL   100   mM   EDTA  pH  6  and  1.5  mL  TBAHS.     The   samples   were   re-extracted   by   addition   of   4   mL   synthetic   lower   phase   buffer.  

31  

The   synthetic   lower   phase   buffer   was   prepared   by   addition   of   150   l   water,   2   mL   methanolic  0.25  M  HCl,  4  mL  chloroform  and  1.5  mL  0.25  M  HCl,  2  mM  sodium  EDTA,  5  mM   tetrabutylammonium   hydrogen   sulphate,   and   0.9%   NaCl.   The   layers   were   allowed   to   separate   and   4   mL   of   the   lower   phase   was   utilized   in   the   experiment.   The   yeast   sample   combined  with  synthetic  lower  phase  was  vortexed,  sonicated  in  an  ice-cooled  bath  for  5   minutes  and  incubated  on  ice  for  5  minutes.  Following  centrifugation  at  250xg  for  5  min,   the  lower  phase  was  combined  with  the  original  lower  phase,  vortexed  and  centrifugated  at   250xg   for   5   min.   The   upper   phase   was   discarded   and   lower   phase   transferred   to   a   clean   tube   and   dried   in   a   speedvac   evaporator.   After   drying,   the   tube   was   rinsed   with   500   L   chloroform/methanol/water  (5:5:1)  and  dried  in  a  speedvac  evaporator.     Deacylation  of  PIs   While   spinning,   the   deacylation   reagent   was   prepared   (deacylation   reagent   consisted  of  4.6  mL  methanol  (MeOH),  2.6  mL  methylamine  (40%  stock),  1.6  mL  distilled   water  (ddH20),  and  1.1  mL  1-butanol).  The  supernatant  was  aspirated,  and  the  pellet  was   re-suspended   in   50   L   of   ice-cold   ddH20.   This   was   transferred   to   new   eppendorf   tubes   and   1000  L  of  deacylation  reagent  was  added  and  the  tubes  were  sonicated.  The  tubes  were   incubated  at  room  temperature  for  30  min,  sonicated  and  incubated  in  a  water  bath  at  53Â°C   for  50  min.  Once  the  deacylation  step  was  completed,  the  tubes  were  vortexed  to  remove   any  material  sticking  to  the  walls  and  speed  vac  dried  over  night.     Extraction  of  deacylated  PIs   Once   the   tubes   were   dried   down,   500   L   of   ddH20   was   added   and   the   tubes   were   sonicated  to  dispersion.  Tubes  were  incubated  at  room  temperature  for  30  min  and  speed   vac   dried   again.   Once   the   samples   were   dried   down,   300   L   of   ddH20   was   added   and   32  

sonicated   to   dispersion.   Extraction   reagent   was   made   as   follows:   4   mL   1-butanol,   800   L   ethyl   ether   and   200   L   of   formic   acid   ethyl   ester   (ethyl   formate).   For   the   extraction   process,  300  L  of  extraction  reagent  was  added  and  the  tubes  were  vortexed  for  30  sec.   The  tubes  were  spun  at  maximum  speed  at  room  temperature.  This  formed  a  biphasic  layer   where  the  aqueous  layer  is  at  the  bottom  containing  the  deacylated  inositol  head  groups.   The   bottom   layer   is   pipetted   out   to   a   new   tube.   The   extraction   process   is   repeated   once   again  added  300  L  of  the  extraction  reagent.  Once  the  entire  aqueous  layer  is  transferred   to   a   new   tube,   discard   the   remaining   upper   layer.   The   new   tube   containing   the   aqueous   layer  is  dried  down  in  a  speed  vac  and  re-suspended  in  60  L  of  HPLC  H20.  The  sample  is   vortexed  and  frozen  at  -20Â°C  until  analyzed  by  MS.     Confirmation  of  cellular  lipid  extracts  with  Thin  Layer  Chromatography  (TLC)   Aluminum-backed   silica   gel   TLC   plates   (silica   gel   60F254   )   purchased   from   Sigma,   were  used  for  the  standard  TLC  separation  of  lipid  samples.  Before  loading,  the  extracted   lipid   standards   were   spotted   on   the   TLC   plates,   approximately   20   mL   of   the   running   solvent   to   a   standard   glass   TLC   tank   was   added.      The   tank   was   sealed   allowing   the   atmosphere   inside   the   tank   to   equilibrate   for   at   least   30   min.   The   running   solvent   was   chloroform/methanol/4   M   NH4OH   (54:42:12,   v/v).   At   least   1.0   cm   of   space   was   left   between   each   sample   position.   The   dried   lipid   extracts   (before   deacylation)   were   re- suspended   in   150-200   L   chloroform:   methanol   (2:1).   The   samples   were   loaded   in   their   pre-determined  positions  along  a  line  drawn  with  a  pencil  1.5  cm  to  2  cm  above  the  bottom   of  the  plate.  Once  the  spots  were  fully  loaded,  the  plate  was  positioned  in  the  glass  tank,  the   tank   was   covered   and   the   solvent   was   allowed   to   run   up   the   TLC   for   a   few   min   until   the   solvent  front  was  within  2.5  cm  of  the  top  of  the  plate.  After  the  plate  dried,  it  was  placed  in

a   jar   containing   iodine   crystals.   The   iodine   vapourized   caused   colour   changes   on   the   TLC   plate,   which   signify   particular   molecular   groups   in   the   extracts   such   as   inositol   head   groups,  phosphate  groups  and  glycerol  groups.     Chromatography   Reverse-Phase  Chromatography  using  the  Sep-Pak  cartridge     In   order   to   perform   reverse   phase   chromatography   with   the   Sep-Pak   column,   a   gradient  of  strong  to  weak  polar  solvent  was  used.  This  chromatography  method  uses  less   solvents  and  reagents;  there  is  minimal  sample  transfer,  no  cross-contamination,  and  less   exposure   to   toxic   agents,   which   can   eliminate   isomerization   of   deacylated   PIs.   The   Sep-Pak   contains   non-polar   packing   silica   material.   First,   the   bonded   silica   phase   was   solvated   with   70%  methanol  (MeOH)+  an  ion  pairing  reagent  (0.1%NH4OH),  not  allowing  the  cartridge  to   dry   out.   The   wild   type/mutant   deacylated   PI   biological   samples   were   dissolved   in   a   strongly  polar  solvent.  The  deacylated  PIs  were  dissolved  in  70%MeOH+0.1%NH4OH.  The   column   was   washed   with   water   and   eluted   with   acetonitrile   (AcN)   and   then   methanol   (MeOH).  The  most  tightly  bound  components  were  eluted  with  a  more  progressively  non- polar   solvent   such   as   isopropanol   (IPA),   while   the   polar   molecules   of   interest   eluted   out   first.   Once,   the   PIs   were   eluted   in   fractions,   the   cartridges   were   discarded.   Each   of   the   sample   fractions   were   collected   vials   were   collected   and   run   through   the   MS   to   finally   identify   the   fractions   of   interest.   In   this   method,   the   sample   is   purified   from   any   other   contaminants.

HPLC  Analysis  of  deaclyated  PIs   Two   chromatography   methods   were   tested   using   reverse   phase   chromatography.   Samples   were   loaded   onto   a   2   L   loop   at   a   flow   rate   of   10   L/min.   Before   injecting,   the   samples  were  thawed.  A  standard  curve  was  run  in  order  to  test  for  sensitivity  and  aid  in   the   quantitation   of   PIs   in   biological   samples.   Standard   curve   was   obtained   with   the   Gro(4,5)P2   (catalogue   number:   P-4500)   ordered   from   Echelon   Biosciences.   The   range   for   the  standard  curve  consisted  of  the  following  contents:  0  pmol,  1  pmol,  5  pmol,  10  pmol,  15   pmol,   20   pmol,   30   pmol,   and   40   pmol   per   2   L.   The   dried   biological   samples   were   re- suspended  in  70%  MeOH  +  0.1%  NH4OH  and  further  diluted  in  100%  H20  +  0.1%  NH4OH.   The  biological  samples  were  diluted  1:1000,  1:100  and  1:10  so  they  did  not  over  saturate   the   columns   and   cause   any   clogs   within   the   ionization   needle   head.   Deacylated   PIs   were   analyzed  under  negative  polarity.  The  15  cm  column  used  consisted  of  the  following  inner   diameter:   320.1   m   and   outer   diameter:   431.1   m.   For   reverse   phase   chromatography,   the   column  was  packed  with  5  m  C18  silica  beads.  Ligands  that  are  grafted  on  the  silica  beads   were  linear  hydrocarbon  chains  (n-alkyl  groups).  This  allowed  the  stationary  phase  to  be   highly  hydrophobic.  In  this  method,  HPLC  allowed  molecules  to  be  eluted  at  different  times   dependent  on  their  molecular  structures,  hence  decreasing  the  chances  of  ion  suppression.     Two   methods   consisting   of   various   stationary   and   mobile   phases   were   utilized   for   the   detection  system  of  PIs.  Elution  Method  1  (M1)  consisted  of  a  mobile  phase  A  of  50%  IPA   and   50%   MeOH   +   0.1%NH4OH,   whereas,   mobile   phase   B   consisted   of   H20   +   0.1%NH4OH.     Elution   method   2   (M2)   consisted   of   Mobile   phase   A   of   water   containing   5mM   N,N   dimethylhexylamine      (DMHA)   and   4mM   glacial   acetic   acid   and   mobile   phase   B   of   acetonitrile  or  methanol  with  5mM  DMHA  and  4mM  glacial  acetic  acid.

      Cleaning  the  column   In   order   to   clean   the   C18   column   for   any   impurities   and   contamination,   5%   formic   acid   (FA)   was   injected   through   the   column   to   elute   out   any   non-polar   bound   molecules.   Isocratic   flow   consisting   of   70%   MeOH   was   run   for   30   min   until   all   peaks   present   from   the   samples   disappeared   in   negative   polarity.      All   syringes   and   loops   are   cleaned   with   70%   MeOH  or  5%  formic  acid  (FA)  before  injection  of  any  samples.

Chapter  3:  Results  
PIs   regulate   major   aspects   of   cellular   behavior   such   as   trafficking,   phagocytosis,   apoptosis  and  cell  survival.  Comparing  the  lipidome  of  healthy  versus  diseased  states  can   provide   information   helpful   in   correlating   the   role   of   lipids   in   various   diseases,   such   as   cancer,  atherosclerosis,  and  chronic  inflammation.    With  the  measurement  of  PtdIns(4,5)P2   using   mass   spectrometry,   it   can   provide   insight   into   such   areas   as   drug/inhibitor   interactions.  Methodology  based  on  deacylation  of  PIs  and  subjecting  these  to  HPLC-MS  can   be   used   to   quantitate   PtdIns(4,5)P2   in   both   wild   type   and   mutant   cell   types.   Various   optimization  steps  were  used  to  achieve  optimum  results  for  the  detection  of  PtdIns(4,5)P2.   Both   mobile   phases   were   changed   in   order   to   achieve   high   resolution,   enhance   separation,   decrease  carry  over  and  peak  tailing  and  increase  sensitivity.  This  work  represents  the  first   step  to  quantitate  PIP2  and  other  PIs.        Confirmation  of  the  presence  of  extracted  and  deacylated  products  by  TLC        TLC  was  used  as  a  confirmation  step  to  ensure  there  was  something  in  the  extracted   and  deacylated  samples.  This  allowed  us  to  verify  if  we  extracted   amphipathic  lipids  in  one   phase   versus   head   groups   in   another   phase,   also   a   way   to   test   the   efficiency   of   the   extraction   and   deacylation   protocol.   A   screening   mechanism   was   set   in   place   in   order   to   visualize  and  detect  any  product  formed  from  the  extraction  and  deacylation  steps  of  the   Bligh   and   Dyer   and   methylamine   deacylation   methods.   This   allowed   the   detection   of   specific   molecular   species   present   on   phospholipids.      The   detection   system   consisted   of   iodine  vapor,  which  has  been  previously  used  for  the  general  visualization  of  phospholipids

in   yeast   cell   extracts.   The   running   solvent   system   consisted   of   MeOH:   chloroform:   4M   (NH4)OH   (54:42:12)   (fig   3.1)(Berrie   and   Lurisci,   2007).   We   were   able   to   confirm   the   certainty   of   the   molecular   identity   of   the   extracts   spotted   on   the   stationary   phase   based   on   their   molecular   composition   and   polarity.   Standard,   biological   samples   after   deacylation   and   biological   samples   before   deacylation   were   spotted.   The   separation   of   the   samples   are   depended  on  the   hydrophobicity of the compounds. Since silica gel plates are polar, less polar compounds samples (full intact lipids) will migrate faster than the more polar (after deacylation, glycerated PIs), which was retained in the plate. These plated were then stained with iodine vapor detecting the presence of either inositol, phosphate and glycerol groups which appeared after 2 and 5 minutes. Both Gro(4,5)P2 standard and biological deacylated PIs were spotted and the results state that since these samples are very polar, its presence was closer to the line of origin. Finally, biological samples before deacylation were run and its presence was detected closer to the solvent front line stating the less polar property of these intact lipids compared to the glycerated PI head groups. Due to the presence of potential phospholipid groups present, TLC confirmed the high efficiency of extracted lipids and deacylated PI groups thus, comparing the molecular results to the Gro(4,5)P2 standard to confirm its presence or absence.

   Fig  B         Fig  3.1.  The  iodine  vapor  detection  mechanism  consists  of  exposing  the  TLC  plates  to   iodine   vapor.  First  TLC  plate  has  been  exposed  to  iodine  vapor  for  120  seconds  whereas   Fig   B   plate   has   been   exposed   to   iodine   vapor   for   480   seconds,   because   some   functional   groups  require  more  time  to  be  stained.  The  running  solvent  used  was  MeOH:  chloroform:   4M   (NH4)OH,   v/v   (54:42:12).   The   deacylated   (lane   1)   and   non-decylated   (lane   2)   lipid   extracts  were  dissolved  in  of  70%  MeOH.  Plate  1,  lane  1  appeared  to  have  a  white  blot  near   the   point   of   application,   row   lane2   consisted   of   a   light   brown   streak   whereas   row   3   consisted   of   a   medium   brown   blot.   Plate   2,   lane   1   consisted   of   a   very   pale   yellow   spot,   lane   2   consisted   of   a   pale   to   medium   yellow   streak   and   lane   3   consisted   of   a   medium   brown- yellow   streak   and   a   brown   blot   near   the   top.   The   following   represents   colors   for   specific   characteristic   functional   groups   in   the   molecule:   glycerol   is   medium   yellow,   glycerol   phosphate   is   medium   yellow,   inositol   is   medium   brown   with   a   pale   white   center   surrounded  by  a  brown  ring  (Larose,  1961).  This  shows  the  efficiency  of  the  extraction  and   deacylation  protocol.        Recovery  of  PI(4,5)P2  from  the  Sep  Pak      Due   to   the   very   low   levels   of   PtdIns(4,5)P2   present   within   cells,   the   extraction   steps  

need   to   be   sufficient   to   provide   optimum   product   recovery.   To   confirm   recovery   of   Gro(4,5)P2   from   the   solid-phase   extraction   method,   eluents   to   recover   majority   of   Gro(4,5)P2  and  the  amount  of  Gro(4,5)P2  recovered  was  measured.     39  

   Solvent  system  for  the  recovery  of  Gro(4,5)P2  using  the  Sep  Pak  reverse  phase  column      Sep   Pak   cartridge   is   a   convenient   and   reproducible   solid-phase   extraction   device  

used  in  the  final  extraction  process  to  purify  a  sample  before  it  is  injected  into  the  MS  as   indicated   by   the   manufacturers,   Waters.      The   cartridges   consisted   of   a   few   factors   that   makes   it   a   convenient   choice   for   extraction   of   the   polar   Gro(4,5)P2:      low   cost,   faster   protocol  compared  to  LLE,    less  sample  handling,  reduced  harm  to  labile  samples  and  most   importantly  greater  percentage  of  product  recovery,  in  comparison  to  other  methods  such   as  TLC,    dry-column  method  and  the  Sochlet  extraction  method.        Various  solvent  systems  were  used  to  elute  the  internal  standard.  They  ranged  from  

lower  to  higher  polarity  (AcN,  isopropanol,  isopropanol  +  5%  formic  acid  and  finally  water.   Initially,  a  stock  of  100  M  Gro(4,5)P2  was  diluted  1:1000  and  1:00  to  obtain  parent  peak  of   493  m/z.  Eluents'  that  provided  peaks  well  above  the  back  ground  noise  (E3)  consisted  of   AcN   and   water.   The   final   wash   step   with   water   over   saturated   the   column,   which   lead   to   peak  trailing  as  seen  fig  3.2.

Fig  3.2:  Recovery  analysis  of  Gro(4,5)P2  using  the  solid  phase  extraction  procedure.   Various  eluents  were  tested  in  order  to  extract  Gro(4,5)P2  from  the  reverse  phase  Sep  Pak   cartridge.  Most  polar  solvents  such  as  AcN  and  water  recovered  Gro(4,5)P2  from  the   cartridge.        Measuring  recovered  Gro(4,5)P2  from  the  solid  phase  extraction  method   Now,   that   we   know   which   solvent   system   provided   the   most   recovery   from   the   cartridge,  next  step  is  to  measure  how  much  of  Gro(4,5)P2  are  we  loosing  through  the  solid   phase  extraction  system.  Both  the  wash  with  water  and  AcN  steps  were  combined  together.   Dilutions  consisting  of  1:100  and  1:10  were  analyzed,  both  from  before  and  after  the  solid   phase  extraction  system.  There  seems  to  be  a  90.8%  recovery  of  Gro(4,5)P2  after  eluting  it   through  the  sep  pak  cartridge  as  shown  in  Fig  3.3.

In  order  to  measure  levels  of  PI(4,5)P2,  methylamine  was  used  to  deacylate  the  lipid,   detaching   the   lipid   chain,   thus   forming   Gro(4,5)P2.   This   chemical   reaction   is   important   because  the  structural  analysis  of  the  full  structure  of  PIs  lead  to  a  highly  complex  picture,   due   to   the   varying   lipid   tails   attached   to   the   inositol   head   groups   through   the   glycerol   backbone.   Though   these   specialized   lipids   comprise   less   then   1%   of   the   cellular   lipid

Selected  Ion  Monitoring  of  Gro(4,5)P2   Mass   spectrometry   is   also   a   micro   analytical   technique   used   for   the   qualitative   assessment   of   a   specific   analyte.   It   can   be   used   to   selectively   determine   the   elemental   composition   and   some   aspects   of   the   molecular   structure   of   a   molecule.   MS   was   used   to   confirm  the  molar  mass  of  Gro(4,5)P2,  which  is  the  parent  molecule  in  mass  spectrometry   as  seen  in  fig  3.4.  To  start,  the  MS  must  be  tuned  in  order  to  ensure  correct  identification  of   the  ion  mass  to  charge  ratio  and  provide  optimum  settings  in  order  to  detect  the  specific   parent   ion   (Fig   A.1).

In  negative  ion  mode,  [M-H]-  is  typically  formed  by  the  abstraction  of  a  proton  by   the  OH-  present  on  the  Gro(4,5)P2  molecule,  thus  forming  negative  ions.  Here,  ion  peak  is   the  most  intense  due  to  the  optimization  of  this  peak  through  tuning  of  the  MS.        43

Product-ion   mass   spectrum   of   Gro(4,5)P2   was   used   to   obtain   the   structure   information.  Selected  ion  monitoring  (SIM)  was  achieved  in  figure  3.5.  This  is  a  single  stage   technique  in  which  a  single  ion  is  monitored.    Ions  of  interest  (493m/z)  are  stored  within   the  mass  analyzer  where  they  are  then  scanned  to  form  a  mass  spectrum.

Selected  Reaction  Monitoring        A   unique   feature   of   MS   is   its   capacity   to   produce   and   detect   fragments   of   the   molecule   that   correspond   to   discrete   groups   of   atoms   of   different   elements   that   reveal   structural  features.  The  main  fragmentation  profile  of  493m/z  was  achieved  using  negative   scan   mode   by   direct   infusion   and   selecting   for   the   parent   peak.   Selected   reaction   monitoring   (SRM),   is   a   two   stage   monitoring   system,   which   was   used   to   confirm   the   identity  of  Gro(4,5)P2.  Both  the  parent  ions  and  product  ions  were  monitored.  The  parent   ion  (493  m/z)  and  then  was  fragmented  to  form  product  ions.    Peak  consisting  of  a  m/z  of

The  parent  ion  is  filtered  (493  m/z)  and  fragmented  to  produce  product  ions  of   m/z  of  177,  241,  321,  339,  395,  401,  and  475.  This  helps  reveal  structural  features  of   Gro(4,5)P2.  Y  axis  represents  the  relative  abundance/intensity  of  the    ion  peak.  X  axis   represents  the  mass  mass-to-charge  ratio  (m/z)  of  the  ion.        Methods  of  Detection      Various   conditions   were   tested   to   identify   and   obtain   the   most   intense   and   prominent   peaks   to   develop   a   standard   curve   and   then   run   biological   samples.   The   diluted   biological   samples   consisting   of   the   deacylated   head   groups   were   compared   to   the   standard   curve   in   order   to   quantitate   the   amount   of   lipid   of   interest   present   in   both   the   wild   type   and   mutant   yeast   cell   types.   Two   elution   methods   provided   optimized   results,   however  elution  method  1  gave  a  very  high  backpressure  (+300  bars)  at  a  very  low  flow  ~3   L/min.  Due  to  this,  the  peaks  were  broad  and  reaching  baseline  after  each  injection  was  

45  

time  consuming.  M2  provided  optimized  results  at  a  flow  rate  of  ~15  L/min,  pressure  at   200bars,  and  after  intense  peak  height,  the  baseline  was  reached  within  5  minutes.     Negative   ion   LC-MS   spectra   were   recorded   after   optimization   settings;   under   ion   charge   control   conditions   at   a   scan   speed   of   200,000m/z/s.   Spectra   was   recorded   in   a   range  of  100-600  m/z.  Ammonium  hydroxide  was  used  as  a  ionization  buffer.  The  standard   curve  was  run  to  obtain  two  orders  of  magnitude.  The  limit  of  detection  for  the  standard   curve   was   to   the   point   of   over   saturation   and   peak   broadening.   After   the   standard   curve   is   run,  several  blank  samples  were  run  until  no  carry-over  was  noted.    A  2  L  loop  was  used   to  inject  the  samples  in  the  MS.  Blanks  were  run  initially  to  obtain  a  stable  base  line.  Pica   mole   amounts   were   detected   using   the   ESI-MS.   A   100   M   stock   was   used   of   Gro(4,5)P2.   Blanks   were   run   after   the   standard   curve   series   to   stabilize   baseline.   Once   the   baseline   stabilized,  1:100  or/and  1:10  dilution  of  the  biological  sample  was  injected  providing  peaks   within  range  of  the  standard  curve  and  well  above  the  blank  injections.  Elution  method  1   and   elution   method   2   consisted   of   the   similar   stationary   phase,   which   was   C18   silica   bound   beads.   Results  of  Elution  Method  1   Mobile   phase   A   consisted   of   50%   IPA   and   50%   MeOH   +   0.1%NH4OH,   whereas,   mobile   phase   B   consisted   of   H20   +   0.1%NH4OH.   Both   SIM   and   SRM   were   run   as   seen   in   figure  3.4  and  3.55,  respectively.     A  standard  curve  using  SIM  was  obtained  having  a  range  of  0,  1,  5,  10,  15,  20,  30,  40   pmole   content   within   a   2   L   loop.   In   fig   3.7,   three   blanks   were   run   after   the   74   min   period.   Interestingly,  carry  over  was  significantly  reduced  compared  to  previous  methods  using  i.e.   mobile   phase   consisting   of   70%   AcN,   and   all   were   blanks   are   consistent   in   intensity   of  

46  

approximately  9.11E+03.    After  establishing  a  standard  curve  with  the  standard  Gro(4,5)P2   purchased   from   Echelon   Biosciences,      yeast   biological   samples   were   then   run   with   varying   dilutions  of  1:100  and  1:10.  There  seemed  to  be  a  nearby  to  3-fold  increase  in  the  intensity   relative  to  the  wild  type  of  the  1:10  dilution  of  the  deacylated  wild  type  phosphoinositdes   in  the  biological  sample.

The  increasing  intensity  of   the  parent  ion  peaks  (493  m/z)  is  correlated  with  the  increasing  content  of  Gro(4,5)P2  per   L.  A  signal  was  present  and  was  within  the  standard  curve  range.           We  also  established  a  standard  curve  using  the  fragment  of  395  derivative  by  SRM.

   Fig  3.8:  SRM  analysis  of  Gro(4,  5)P2  using  elution  method  one.    SRM  was  obtained  using   the  product  ion  of  395  m/z.  The  biological  peak  at  395  m/z    did  not  appear  over  a  number   of  dilutions  after  the  120  min  mark  period.  The  biological  wild  type  signal  seems  to  be   concealed  with  the  background  noise.  The  mobile  phase  consisted  of  the  following;  50%   mobile  phase  A  and  50%  mobile  phase  B.  Used  elution  method  One.      48

Fig  3.9:  Using  elution  method  2,  SIM  of  Gro(4,5)P2  using  method  2.  Pmole  amounts   were  injected;  blank,  1pmol,  5,  10,  15,  20.  Blanks  were  injected  again  to  obtain  a  stable   baseline.  Biological  wild  type  and  mutant  was  diluted  1:100  and  1:10.  The  mutant  provided   a  2  fold  increase  in  comparison  to  the  wild  type.       49  

   The  standard  curve  of  the  standard  Gro(4,5)P2  without  the  blank  provided  a  linear   relationship  between  the  intensity  and  the  content  of  Gro(4,5)P2.  The  r  value  consisted  of   0.9912,  stating  that  there  was  a  strong  correlation  between  both  the  intensity  and  the   content  of  Gro(4,5)P2  injected  in  the  2  L  loop  (fig  3.10).

Chapter  4:  Discussion:    
   PIs  play  a  fundamental  role  in  diverse  functions  within  the  cell.  They  are  known  to   play   a   role   in   cell   survival   and   differentiation,   opening   of   ion   channels,   calcium   mobilization,   serve   as   precursors   of   intracellular   signaling   cascades   and   as   ligands   for   membrane   associated   proteins   that   are   involved   in   trafficking   and   cytoskeletal   dynamics   (Wenk   et   al.,   2003;   Wakelam   and   Clark).   The   changes   in   different   levels   of   PIs,   is   the   hallmark   of   various   mutants.   There   are   various   efforts   to   explore   abnormal   lipid   metabolism   in   human   diseases,   such   as   insulin-resistant   diabetes,   Alzheimer's   disease,   schizophrenia,   cancer,   atherosclerosis,   and   infectious   diseases   through   lipidomics   approach  (Kim   et  al.,  2010).  With  the  focus  on  phosphoinositide,  lipidomics  can  contribute   to   drug   development   for   pharmaceutical   therapy   of   phosphoinositide   related   diseases.   Advances  in  separation  and  quantitation  technology  have  changed  the  analysis  of  biological   samples,  intensely.    Previous  attempts  at  quantitation  of  PIs  have  focused  on  utilizing  [3H]- inositol   or   [32P]   inorganic   P2  radiolabelling   of   cell   cultures,   followed   by   lysis,   extraction,   deacylation  and  resolution  using  TLC  or  HPLC.  The  radioisotopes  are  then  quantified  by  a   liquid   scintillation   counter.   This   approach   is   disadvantageous   as   it   is   laborious   since   it   required   a   permit   to   be   used,   time-consuming   and   utilizes   radioactivity,   which   requires   special  handling  care.  Labeling  occurs  only  during  turnover,  thus  newly  synthesized  PIs  are   labeled  but  the  preexisting  PIs  are  not;  thus  unaccounted  for  in  the  quantitation.  Additional   assays   have   been   developed   based   on   enzymatic   activity   and   interaction   domains,   which   also   lack   sensitivity.   Recently   a   shift   towards   MS,   which   has   previously   been   utilized   to   quantify  low  abundance  peptides,  metabolites  and  lipids  is  occurring.      53  

Due   to   the   over   complexity   of   PIs,   different   methods   are   employed   for   the   separation   and   analysis   of   different   classes.   Since   the   importance   lies   on   the   phosphorylation  pattern  on  the  inositol  head  group  to  different  PIs,  the  fatty  acid  chain  was   deacylated  in  order  to  simplify  MS  analysis.    PIs  were  extracted  by  using  the  Bligh  and  Dyer   method,   where   a   biphasic   phase   is   formed.   One   phase   contained   polar   deacylated   molecules   whereas   the   other   phase   nonpolar   un-deacylated   lipids   and   fatty   acids.   The   advantage   of   using   the   Bligh   and   Dyer   method   over   the   Folch   method,   which   is   another   common   phospholipid   extraction   method,   is   the   reduction   in   the   solvent/sample   ratio.   Bligh  and  Dyer  uses  one  part  sample  to  three  parts  solvent  whereas,  Folch  method  employs   a   ratio   of   one   part   sample   to   twenty   parts   solvent   (Iverson   et  al.,   2001).   Despite   this,   the   Bligh  and  Dyer  method  is  thought  to  yield  recovery  of  almost  95%  of  total  lipids  (Bligh  and   Dyer,   1959).      Even   though   his   method   has   been   long   used   in   the   extraction   of   phospholipids,   many   have   used   modified   versions   of   these   methods   for   the   extraction   of   PIs   and   reduce   product   loss.   Pettit   et   al.,   used   a   method   which   is   thought   to   recover   approximately   90%   of   PIs   (Pettitt,   2010).   This   procedure   is   believed   to   provide   high   extraction  recovery  of  all  PIs  from  biological  samples,  thus  identifying  the  lipid  structures   by  CID  of  the  MS  peaks.  To  confirm  the  presence  of  phospholipids  in  the  cellular  extract,  a   TLC  was  run  to  identify  the  chemical  composition  of  the  extract  such  as  certain  molecular   groups   common   to   phospholipids.      There   are   many   advantages   to   using   TLC   for   lipid   analysis.  TLC  is  convenient,  simple,  inexpensive,  consumes  smaller  amounts  of  solvent  than   HPLC,  enables  the  analysis  of  several  samples  in  parallel,  and  it  is  easy  to  visualize  by  stains   or  dyes  such  as  iodine  vapour  to  specifically  characterize  certain  functional  groups  (Fuchs   et  al.,  2011).  Referring  to  Figure  3.1,  deacylated  PIs  blot  is  closer  to  the  line  of  origin  versus  

54  

PIs   extracted   with   the   Bligh   and   Dyer   method   before   deacylation   thus,   confirming   the   difference  in  polarity  of  the  two.    This  step  is  important  because  it  confirms  the  presence  of   extracted  phospholipids  and  deacylated  species  of  PIs  within  the  recovered  samples  from   yeast  cells.  Then  the  contents  of  the  biological  sample  were  run  through  a  Sep  pak  cartridge   in   order   to   eliminate   contaminants   that   might   other   wise   co-found   in   HPLC-MS   analysis.   The   cartridge   did   not   seem   to   have   significant   loss   of   Gro(4,5)P2   as   seen   in   figure   3.3   because  the  recovery  rate  was  approximately  91%.  This  step  is  vital  because  without  the   use  of  this  cartridge,  it  can  clog  the  column  leading  to  new  ion  suppression  (A.2).          The   quantitation   of   Gro(4,5)P2   was   made   by   constructing   a   standard   curve   using   commercial  Gro(4,5)P2  with  SIM  analysis  (Fig  3.7).  The  quantification  of  the  concentration   of   an   analyte   with   MS   analysis   employs   a   correlation   between   the   content   and   the   ion   intensity   of   the   analyte,   which   shows   a   linear   dynamic   range   as   seen   in   fig.      Different   amounts   of   Gro(4,5)P2   were   spiked   to   reach   contents   from   0.5   pmol/L      to   10   pmol/L   before  the  presence  of  over  saturation  and  peak  broadening.  This  enabled  us  to  test  for  the   sensitivity   of   the   MS   which   allowed   us   to   detect   down   to   0.5   pmole/L   amounts   of   Gro(4,5)P2.      Overall,   the   construction   of   the   standard   curve   validates   that   the   linear   dynamic   range   of   quantification   is   present   in   the   SIM   scan   mode   (Fig   3.10).   Hence,   validating   the   accuracy   and   sensitivity   of   MS   for   measurement   of   specific   analytes.   Other   deacylated  PIs  can  also  be  using  in  order  to  measure  their  concentration  within  both  wild   type   and   mutant   cell   types.   Accordingly,   results   can   be   validated   by   the   accuracy   of   the   two-step   quantification   procedure   utilizing   the   combination   of   both   full   MS   scan   and   MS/MS   scans.   Hence,   when   using   the   SRM   mode   for   the   quantification   of   the   biological  

55  

derived   Gro(4,5)P2,  it   can   become   problematic   due   to   reasons,   such   as   the   non-successful   chemical  deacylation  reactions  and    low  recovery  of  deacylated  PIs.     Another   confirmation   step   to   compare   the   chemical   composition   of   the   standard   Gro(4,5)P2  and  the  biological  Gro(4,5)P2  is  to  run  a    gradient,  analyzing  the  retention  time   for   both   samples.   Both   the   standard   (Fig   3.11)   and   the   biological   derived   Gro(4,5)P2   (fig   3.12)   eluted   out   at   similar   time   points;   the   standard   eluted   out   at   1.9   min   whereas   the   biological  derived  Gro(4,5)P2  eluted   out  at  2.9  min.  Thus,  stating  that   the   polarity   of   two   is   similar.   The   slight   difference   could   be   due   to   the   presence   of   other   head   groups   in   biological  derived  samples.  These  results  are  similar  to  that  of  Kiefer   at  al.,  because  most   polar  deacylated  species  elute  with  a  solvent  containing  high  polarity.        Two  types  of  yeast  cells  were  compared,  wild  type  SEY  6210  and  INP51  mutants  (fig  

3.9).   The   wild   type   have   steady-stated   levels   of   PtdIns(4,5)P2   that   can   change   upon   stimulation   or      disruption   of   genes   thus,   in   order   to   account   for   changes   in   the   level   of   these,   it   is   vital   to   compare   it   to   cells   with   a   few   fold   increase   or   decrease   in   levels   of   PtdIns(4,5)P2.     Inositol   polyphosphate   5-phosphatase   (5-ptase)   enzyme   comprise   a   family   of   critical   proteins   that   remove   the   5-position   phosphate   from   either   soluble   or   lipid   inositol   polyphosphates,   or   both.   The   yeast   genome   sequence   has   similar   open   reading   frames   to   mammalian   inositol   signaling   genes.   One   reading   frame   of   importance   is   YIL002C,   designated   here   as   INP51,   is   known   to   be   highly   similar   to   5-ptases   (Stolz,   1998).   The   gene   INP51   encodes   a   108-kDa   protein   which   has   intrinsic   PtdIns(4,5)P2   5-ptase   activity   (Stolz,   1998).   Any   loss   or   gain   of   function   of   INP51   demonstrates   that   5-ptase   activity   is   required   for   proper   PtdIns(4,5)P2   maintenance   (Stolz,   1998).We   used   S.   cerevisiae  cells  lacking  inp51  mutants,  which  have  a  2-4  increase  in  levels  of  PtdIns(4,5)P2  

56  

and   Ins(1,4,5)P3.   This   gene   is   critical   for   PtdIns(4,5)P2   homeostasis   and   cold   tolerant   growth.  Cells  over  expressing  inp51exhibit  a  35%  decrease  in  levels  of  PtdIns(4,5)P2.  Thus,   proper  function  of   INP51  is  required  for  proper   in   vivo  maintenance  of  this  PI  (Stolz   et   al.,   1998).      Both   wild   type   and   mutant   PtdIns(4,5)P2   levels   were   compared   by   injecting   dilutions   of   1:100   and   1:10   of   deacylated   lipid   extracts.   There   seems   to   be   a   strong   difference  between  1:10  wild  type  and  1:10  mutant  Gro(4,5)P2  within  the  cells  consisting  of   a   2.08   fold   in   INP51   mutant   cells   in   comparison   to   the   wild   type   S.   cerevisiae   cells.   The   dilutions  consisting  of  1:100  seemed  to  not  have  a  correlation  with  the  1:10  dilution,  which   could  be  due  to  the  very  small  concentration  of  PI(4,5)P2  present  within  the  cells.  Hence,   the   results   vary   when   trying   to   measure   this   deacylated   phospholipid   at   such   low   concentrations.   This could be because the cellular lipidome is a very complicated system, potentially comprised of hundreds of thousands of individual lipid molecular species (Yang  and   Han,   2012).    PIs   are   known   to   be   less   abundant   lipids   in   cells;   therefore   the   analysis   of   these   PIs   is   limited   and   the   replication   of   these   results   varies   depending   on   sample   treatment.  Cautious  must  be  taken  during  each  step,  as  product  loss  is  very  common  during   the   extraction   and   deacylation   steps.      Also,   the   ion   intensity   of   an   analyte   measured   with   MS   could   be   easily   affected   by   other   minor   alterations   in   the   conditions   of   analyte   ionization   and   instrumentation   and   therefore   quantification   results   may   vary   or   may   be   irreproducible   at   a   fixed   concentration   of   an   analyte   (Yang   and   Han,   2012).   Due   to   this,   measurement   of   Gro(4,5)P2   with   MS   can   be   compared   to   another   standard   that   has   a   similar   structure   to   Gro(4,5)P2   such   as   Gro(3,4)P2.   This   analyte   can   then   be   analyzed   simultaneously   with   Gro(4,5)P2   to   ensure   there   is   a   similar   ratio   of   loss   of   product   over   various  runs.  This  will  allow  us  to  analyze  accordingly  and  distinguish  loss  of  PI's  in  cells.

Chapter  5:  Conclusions  and  Future  Work  
In  conclusion  for  the  first  time,  the  methodology  described  in  this  paper,  allows  for  a   rapid,   sensitive   and   comprehensive   analysis   of   PI(4,5)P2   in   yeast   cells   which   is   a   great   benefit   in   the   study   of   these   molecules   in   their   many   roles.   A   standard   purchased   from   Echelon   Biosciences   was   used   to   generate   a   standard   curve   and   to   compare   the   measurement  of  biological  PI(4,5)P2  in  yeast  cells.  For  the  biological  samples,  using  ESI-MS,   the  detection  limit  of  Gro(4,5)P2  seemed  to  be  1  pmol  in  wild  type  cells,  relevant  to  other   studies   where   the   detection   limit   of   common   PIs   is   between   1-10pmol.   Several   solvent   mixtures   and   addition   of   modifiers   were   tested.   Replacing   AcN   by   MeOH   enabled   the   optimum   quantitation   of   PI(4,5)P2   in   yeast   cells.   Replacing   elution   method   1   by   elution   method  2,  and  decreasing  column  size  from  15  cm  to  approximately  10cm,  allowed  lower   back   pressure   for   the   analysis   of   PI(4,5)P2.   To   test   the   applicability   of   our   method   to   biological  samples,  we  analyzed  mutant  type  yeast  cell  extracts  that  are  known  to  produce   2-4   fold   increased   amount   of   PI(4,5)P2   compared   to   the   wild   type   due   to   its   INP51   gene   deletion   genotype.   Our   method   clearly   succeeded   in   reproducing   the   increased   amounts   of   PI(4,5)P2  in  mutant  yeast  cell  types.    Three  replicates  of  both  wild  type  and  mutant  were   run   independently,   in   order   to   validate   empirical   data   and   limit   error.   The   mutant   biological   Gro(4,5)P2   levels   were   on   average   3.9   fold   higher   then   that   of   the   wild   type.     However,   while   relative   changes   in   PI(4,5)P2   were   possible   to   detect,   quantitation   of   the   absolute  content  of  PI(4,5)P2  was  not  reproducible  as  seen  in  A3.  This  could  be  due  to  the   loss  of  PI(4,5)P2  from  the  several  extraction  and  deacylation  steps,  employed.  The  method   presented   here   was   successfully   applied   to   s.   cerevisiae   in   terms   of   approximate  

58  

measurement  of  PI(4,5)P2.  The  extraction  procedure  of  all  PIs  remains  a  major  concern  due   to  poor  recovery  rates,  which  decrease  with  increasing  phosphorylation.       PIs  are  an  important  class  of  cellular  components  and  play  diverse  roles  in  human   physiology.   Even   though,   they   are   very   important,   there   has   been   limited   progress   upon   analyzing   these   lipids   in   detail,   both   in   wild   type   mutant   cell   types.   MS   is   a   powerful   technique  which  allowed  the  measurement  of  Gro(4,5)P2  for  both  mutant  and  INP51  wild   type   yeast   cells.   Even   though   MS   has   the   ability   to   detect   Gro(4,5)P2,   there   are   still   a   few   key   problems   in   PI   analysis   such   as,   extraction,   stability   and   recovery   while   at   the   same   time  being  able  to  measure  the  different  levels  of  PIs  present  within  the  cell.  There  has  to   be  specific  modifications  reached  during  the  extraction  and  recovery  process,  particularly   on   PIs   in   order   to   have   a   better   understanding   of   what   their   function   is   within   cells   and   how   they   may   affect   other   molecular   models.   For   future   work,   enzymatic   biological   reaction   can   be   used   to   catalyze   the   formation   of   Ins(1,4,5)3   and   DAG   from   PI(4,5)P2.   Here,   Ins(1,4,5)3  can  be  used  for  analysis  purposes.  Another  way  to  account  for  loss  of  PIs  is  to   use   the   precursor   PtdIns   for   measurement   of   PI(4,5)P2,   since   levels   of   PtdIns   should   not   change  within  wild  type  and  INP51  mutant  yeast  cell  types.  Over  various  runs,  the  ratio  of   PtdIns  versus  the  ion  of  interest  can  be  accounted  for  to  quantitate  the  loss  of  the  specific   deacylated   PI.         With   the   advent   of   MS   technology,   if   the   measurement   of   PIs   can   be   achieved  with  optimum  recovery,  lipidomics  have  the  key  to  cure  to  many  disorders  such   as   abnormal   lipid   metabolism   in   human   diseases,   such   as   diabetes,   Alzheimer's   disease,   schizophrenia,  and  cancer  to  name  a  few.
