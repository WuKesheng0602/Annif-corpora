Introduction    
In   an   age   where   many   city   centres   struggle   to   attract   innovation,   kick   start   economies   and   retain   talented   residents,   Downtown   Toronto   finds   itself   in   the   enviable   position   of   having   to   manage   a   seemingly   limitless   stream   of   investment,   growth  and  new  prospective  residents.  This  is  a  problem  that  all  central  cities  would   be   eager   to   have:   A   rapidly   swelling   population,   subsequent   office   development   in   key   sectors,   and   a   diverse   and   cosmopolitan   range   of   entertainment   and   cultural   amenities  to  match.  However,  as  public  investment  and  policy  development  always   struggle   to   keep   pace   with   internationally   driven   investment,   a   growing   chorus   of   stakeholders  are  beginning  to  question  whether  the  City  of  Toronto  has  the  capacity   to  accommodate  this  growth  while  maintaining  a  high  quality  of  life  for  its  residents.      It  is  important  to  note  that  the  robust  economic  climate  and  remarkable  street-level   vitality   that   Downtown   currently   enjoys   are   being   driven   by   population   growth   (TD   Economics,   2012).      According   to   the   2011   Living   in   Downtown   and   the   Centres   Survey   (City   of   Toronto,   2012)   the   vast   majority   (77.5%)   of   new   residents   in   the   area  reside  in  buildings  5  or  more  storeys,  a  figure  that  is  likely  to  be  considerably   higher   now.   In   order   for   high-density   urban   living   to   work   for   people   and   be   considered   a   viable   and   sustainable   alternative   that   endures   development   trends   and   market   booms,   the   new   residents   of   vertical   communities   must   perceive   themselves  to  be  enjoying  a  high  quality  of  life.  If  residents'  needs  are  not  being  met,   we  risk  a  return  to  low-density  suburban  housing  preferences  and  the  costly  land- use  mistakes  of  the  past.    

Purpose  of  Study  
The   incredible   scale   and   pace   of   development   -   unfolding   along   a   relatively   short   period   of   time   -   sets   the   backdrop   for   this   discussion.      This   paper   focuses   on   Downtown   Toronto,   which   has   seen   growth   on   a   scale   that   demands   attention.   Between  2006  and  2011,  Downtown  areas  like  Concord  CityPlace  -  which  a  decade   ago   was   abandoned   railway   lands   -   saw   a   434   per   cent   rise   in   those   five   years,   according  to  Statistics  Canada  (Bascaramurty,  2012).  I  explore  key  elements  around      1  

high   quality   of   life   for   residents   of   vertical   communities   in   the   context   of   rapid   growth,   and   discuss   a   range   of   ideas   to   sustain   the   desirability   of   living   in   urban   centres   from   an   urban   planning   perspective.   Building   on   ideas   from   Short   (2012)   this   discussion   paper   asks   if   and   how   tall,   high-density   residential   developments   might  strengthen  the  character  and  dynamism  of  the  Downtown.        Analysis   presented   here   will   focus   on   key   issues   around   this   growth   by   considering   the  impacts  of  height  and  density  on  quality  of  life  from  three  lenses,  including:     1. Priorities   of   people   living   in   high-density   residential   developments   with   a   focus  on  challenges  relating  to  small  living  spaces.   2. The   public   realm,   the   importance   of   walkability,   and   ways   to   measure   the   performance  of  existing  conditions  from  a  people-centred  perspective.   3. The  ability  of  the  planning  framework  to  manage  height  and  density  and  the   potential  of  an  alternative  approach  to  improve  quality  of  life  outcomes.

For   central   cities   generally   and   Downtown   Toronto   especially,   the   costs   of   high- density   living   falling   out   of   favour   volatile   with   notoriously   markets   housing  

would   be   grave.   Given   scale   of   high   density   development

and   National   Household   Survey   data   showing   that   over   three   quarters   of   the   Downtown  population  is  living  in  buildings  three  storeys  or  higher,  it  becomes  clear   that  satisfaction  with  this  new  lifestyle  is  not  only  important,  but  is  in  fact  pivotal  to   the  sustainability  of  Downtown  Toronto.

Methodology  
Generally,  the  discussion  presented  here  considers  a  wide  range  of  topics  on  three   different   scales   ­   life   inside   the   building,   life   around   the   building   and   the   broader   planning   framework.   This   approach   was   chosen   as   it   allows   for   an   understanding   of   height   and   density   and   quality   of   life   from   three   distinctly   different   scales.   The   intent   is   to   begin   at   the   individual   scale   and   `zoom   out'   in   each   section.   The   wide   range  of  topics  strives  for  a  breadth  of  discussion  across  these  different  scales.  

Conceptual  Framework:  Quality  of  Life    
One  of  the  most  important  roles  of  urban  planners  is  to  be  effective  communicators.     This   means   acknowledging   that   planning   has   had   historical   tendencies   toward   overly   technocratic,  process-oriented  ways  of  knowing,  and  should  instead  strive  to  engage   all  communities  in  the  discourse  of  how  their  cities  and  lives  are  affected  (Fainstein,   2000;  Innes,  1995).    In  the  context  of  urban  planning  in  Canada,  facilitating  accessible   communication   around   complex   issues   is   considered   part   of   the   planner's   responsibility  to  the  public  interest  (Canadian  Institute  of  Planners  Code  of  Practice,   2010,   Section   1).      As   engaging   increasingly   diverse   publics   in   planning   processes   becomes   ever   more   important,   planners   are   striving   to   use   consistent   and   easily   understood   language   that   frames   complicated   issues   in   a   way   that   is   meaningful   to   the  average  person.    It  can  be  argued  that  the  term  `quality  of  life'  is  an  attempt  at  this.      This   frame   is   particularly   salient   currently,   as   messaging   coming   from   the   City   of   Toronto   has   recently   emphasized   the   term   in   its   communications.   `Quality   of   life'   is   pervasive  in  language  used  by  City  Planning  Division  documents  and  media  releases,   but   also   appears   frequently   on   the   City   of   Toronto   website,   and   is   a   featured   subheading  in  The  City  of  Toronto  Strategic  Actions  2013-2018  plan.     Chief   Planner   Jennifer   Keesmaat   recently   citied   quality   of   life   impacts   as   a   main   consideration   in   the   division's   non-support   of   a   high   profile   Frank   Gehry   designed   mega-development   in   the   King-Spadina   area   of   the   Downtown   (Hume,   2013).      This   choice  of  words  signals  that  the  term  carries  meaning  beyond  semantics  or  branding.           3  

Despite   its   frequency   of   use   by   the   City   of   Toronto,   this   term   is   never   clearly   defined.     Recent   literature   suggests   that   consistently   used   language   like   `quality   of   life'   and   `livability'   are   employed   according   to   what   rationale   is   in   vogue   for   planners   at   the   time.      Searle   and   Fillion   (2011)   emphasize   the   idea   that   language   changes   with   circumstances.      They   point   out   that   ways   of   framing   the   issue   of   residential   intensification   have   shifted   from   fiscal   responsibility   in   times   of   tight   municipal   budgets   (e.g.   higher   density   is   cheaper   to   provide)   toward   quality  of  life   benefits   such   as   health   and   less   car   reliance   (p.1429).   On   the   other   hand,   quality   of   life   is   also   used   as  a  catch-all  term  to  describe  quantitative  measures  of  city  livability  such  as  water,   power,   transit   and   a   host   of   other   infrastructure   capacities.      Such   a   quantitative   approach   is   employed   by   the   popular   Mercer   City   Livability   Index,   The   Martin   Prospertity   Institute's   Livability   Index   and   many   others,   all   of   which   employ   exhaustive  and  disparate  sets  of  indicators  to  define  quality  of  life  (Okulicz-Kozaryn,   2013).      Given   that   quality   of   life   is   used   as   a   framing   device   to   tell   a   story   about   complex   planning  issues,  a  question  arises:  Is  quality  of  life  a  set  of  quantitative  metrics  or  is  it   purely   a   conceptual   idea   about   how   well   different   aspects   of   city   perform   for   their   residents?  Literature  on  quality  of  life  and  the  city  suggests  a  balance:  Shumi's  (2013)   discussion  synthesizes  existing  literature  to  suggest  that  quality  of  life  is:  "Objective   conditions   together   with   subjective   perceptions...[and   is]   generally   agreed   to   be   multidimensional   having   subjective   and   objective   attributes"   (p.6).      It   is   this   definition  of  quality  of  life  that  I  will  use  in  this  discussion,  bearing  in  mind  that  the   use   of   the   term   is   intended   to   tell   a   complex   story   in   a   manner   that   is   easily   understood.   In   sum,   quality   of   life   is   a   useful   lens   to   consider   challenges   around   density  and  its  outcomes  for  citizens.    

Quality  of  Life:  Focus  Areas  
   Quality   of   life   should   not   be   considered   a   definitive   of   scientific   measure   for   the   simple   reason   that   selection   of   indicators   can   be   arbitrary.      However,   in   order   to

give  meaning  to  the  term,  planners  must  rationalize  what  areas  they  choose  to  focus   on  and  why  they  are  important  to  people.      This  work  uses  qualitative  and  quantitative  data  from  the  Living  in  the  Downtown   and   the   Centres   Survey   (City   of   Toronto,   2012),   as   well   as   the   Condominium   Consultation  (SWERHUN,  2013)   undertaken   by   the   City   of   Toronto   to   support   the   5-year  Official  Plan  review.    These  datasets  are  used  as  a  way  to  identify  key  issues   important   to   quality   of   life   as   they   give   us   a   window   as   to   what   Downtown   life   means   to   its   residents.   The   focus   areas   selected   for   the   analysis   are   based   on   the   highest   priority   issues   and   top-ranked   responses.      The   primary   advantage   to   the   data  employed  here  is  that  it  captures  the  lived  experiences  of  residents  and  their   priorities  (many  of  them  qualitative),  as  opposed  to  expert  and  data-driven  livability   indices,  bearing  in  mind  that  "after  all,  what  matters  is  what  we  perceive,  not  what  is   out   there"(Okulicz-Kozaryn,   p.433-37).   Addressing   this   aspect   is   important,   considering  the  challenges  of  supporting  the  idea  that  living  in  vertical  communities   is  (or  can  be)  a  viable  choice  that  works  for  people.

Definitions  

   Tall  Buildings:   The   Official   Plan   (2006)   Policy   3.1.3   states   that   buildings   whose   height   is   greater   than   the   width   of   the   road   allowance   are   considered   tall   buildings.   This   paper   focuses   on   areas   where   building   heights   are   many   times   greater   than   road   allowances,  but  it  is  important  to  recognize  that  Downtown  is  home  to  many  stable   lower-scale  neighourhoods  where  very  little  change  is  anticipated.

Context  
Policy  Overview    
All   urban   growth   and   transformation   in   Canada   is   shaped   by   provincial   priorities,   but  in  the  case  of  the  GTA,  provincial  policy  aimed  to  limit  sprawl  has  had  dramatic   impacts   for   urban   planning.   The   Provincial   Policy   Statement   sets   out   objectives   that   growth   should   be   managed   in   order   to   promote   efficient   use   of   land   through   intensification   and   redevelopment   of   built-up   areas   (Policy   1.1.3.3).   In   directing   growth   to   specified   urban   centres   ­   including   Downtown   Toronto   in   its   entirety   -   the  Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  (2006)  has  helped  to  guide  urban   intensification  on  a  massive  scale  for  growth  areas.    The  Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater   Golden   Horseshoe   dictates   that   40   percent   of   new   development   in   single-tier   municipalities   must   occur   in   already   built-up   areas   by   2015,   with   Downtown   7  

  

Toronto  compelled  to  meet  density  targets  of  400  people  by  2031.  According  to  MPP   Glen  Murray's  office,  Downtown  Toronto  sat  at  708  people  and  jobs  per  hectare  in   2012  (Bencharif,  2012).    

Demand  and  Development  
It   is   important   to   note   that   while   provincial   policies   shape   urban   growth,   they   are   only  part  of  the  story.  While  provincial  policy  acts  as  a  guide,  consumer  demand  and

demographic   shifts   are   the   main   drivers   of   an   enduring   trend   toward   higher   density   residential   development   in   the   Downtown  and  Growth  Centres   in   the   GTA.      The   market   response   to   this   new   demand   illustrates   a   clear   break   from   traditional   low-density  

suburban   housing   preferences.   In   Downtown   Toronto,   single   family   housing   construction   fell   by   9%   between   2005   and   2010(Collins-Williams,   2013),   while   high-rise  projects  now  represent  the  majority  of  new  residential  developments.    In   the  period  between  2006-2011,  population  growth  in  the  Downtown  surpassed  that   of   the   surrounding   suburbs   for   the   first   time   in   decades   (City   of   Toronto,   2012).   Most  remarkably,  The  GTA  is  expected  to  grow  by  50%  by  2031,  giving  Toronto  and   its  Downtown  one  of  the  fastest  global  population  growth  rates  (Toronto  Board  of   Trade,  2012).      This   remarkable   scenario   is   attributed   to   the   `condo   boom'   of   the   early   21st   century,   which  has  been  felt  on  a  national  scale,  with  the  central  cities  of  Toronto,  Montreal   and  Vancouver  seeing  a  30%  increase  in  the  share  of  condominiums  to  total  housing   development   in   the   period   from   1981   to   2006   (Statistics   Canada,   in   Rosen   and   Walks,   2013,   p.164).      What   makes   Toronto   a   special   case   is   that   it   has   no   North      8

American   analogue.      Between   2007   and   2012   the   City   of   Toronto's   share   of   the   Greater   Toronto   Area's   total   housing   completions   jumped   from   28.2%   to   40.4%   (City  of  Toronto,  2013).  The  Downtown  has  been  cited  as  having  the  highest  rate  of   high-rise  condo  development  on  the  continent  (Perkins,  2014),  with  approvals  three   times   higher   than   New   York   City   and   seven   times   more   than   Chicago   (Francis,   2012).        Of   course,   the   influx   of   new   residents   alone   cannot   explain   the   story   of   the   resurgence   of   Downtown   living.   Concerns   that   global   capital   driven   property   speculation   and   `assignments'   (original   buyers   selling   units   before   they   are   completed)  are  artificially  inflating  prices  have  been  the  subject  of  sustained  media   scrutiny,   but   have   proven   elusive   to   study   given   the   lack   of   quantifiable   data   and   an   unwillingness  on  the  part  of  the  development  community  to  share  their  information   on  the  subject  (Urbanation,  2012).    While  this  discussion  does  address  this  issue,  the   emphasis   will   be   on   the   tangible   impacts   current   growth   patterns   hold   for   Downtown  residents.      This   resurgence   of   interest   in   city   life   can   be   framed   as   an   intersection   between   shifting   social   geographies   together   with   changing   priorities   toward   the   physical   and   spatial   geographies   of   the   city.      Literature   and   available   data   increasingly   suggest   that   we   are   seeing   value   shifts   that   prioritize   a   lifestyle   that   includes   walking  to  work  and  daily  necessities,  convenient  access  to  transit/less  car  reliance,   and   a   comprehensive   array   of   cultural   and   entertainment   amenities   (Rosen   and   Walks).          For  proponents  of  residential  intensification,  this  is  strong  ground.  People  willing  to   live,   work   and   establish   communities   in   dense   urban   areas   represents   demonstrated   advantages   to   public   health   (people   are   walking   more),   sustainable   land   consumption,   the   environment   and   energy   (less   cars,   less   space   to   heat   and   light)   and   service   provision   (infrastructure   needs   can   be   supplied   easier   and   less   expensively)  (in  Gee,  2012  and  Chakrabarti,  2013).      9  

     However,   order   to   meet   the   lifestyle   priorities   of   these   new   residents,   there   is   the   underlying   assumption   that   downtowns   have   the   capacity   to   provide   in   terms   of   both  community  services  (or  soft  infrastructure)  hard  infrastructure  such  as  transit,   roadways   and   hydro.   As   economic   and   cultural   dynamism   shifts   back   to   central   cities,   municipalities   and   policymakers   are   faced   with   the   challenge   of   laying   the   groundwork   to   meet   the   expectations   of   a   skyrocketing   population   while   making   growth  sustainable.            Downtown   has   been   so   successful,   in   fact,   that   the   City   itself   recognizes   that   the   pace  of  development  is  occurring  on  a  scale  that  was  not  anticipated  (Bascaramurty,   2012).  There  is  a  palpable  anxiety  around  the  magnitude  of  development  as  a  result,   as   a   growing   body   of   media   articles   and   residents   groups   begin   to   ask   different   angles  of  the  question:  How  much  density  is  too  much?  

Context  -  Transit  Framework  
The  politically  charged  nature  of  the  debate  and  the  complexity  of  the  transit  issue   make   for   an   uneasy   fit   into   a   discussion   such   as   this   that   touches   on   a   breadth   of   issues.    As  such,  the  TTC  requires  a  discussion  of  its  own  to  adequately  unpack  and   properly  assess.        However,   in   terms   of   quality   of   life,   it   must   be   noted   that   transit   is   considered   to   be   an   issue   of   primary   importance.      Access   to   transit   was   the   second   most   popular   reason  for  residents  locating  Downtown,  according  to  the  Living  in  Downtown  and   the   Centres   Survey   (2012).   The   apparent   inability   of   any   level   of   government   and   their   agencies,   boards   and   commissions   to   make   headway   on   Downtown   gridlock   will   most   certainly   create   more   urgency   around   the   issue.   A   recent   TTC   report   projects  Downtown  ridership  to  increase  by  over  50%  by  2031  (236,000  trips  in  the   morning  peak,  from  155,000  now)  with  employment  projected  to  grow  28  per  cent   in  the  same  timeframe  (Kalinowski,  2012).  The  idea  of  a  Downtown  `relief  line'  as  a   potential   solution   is   nearly   a   century   old,   but   is   made   more   urgent   by   mounting   10  

  

crowd   congestion   issues   along   the   Yonge   subway   line,   and   a   newly   redeveloped   Union   Station   projected   to   reach   capacity   within   a   generation   according   to   some   (Ibid.).   With   the   council   approval   to   fund   a   subway   extension   to   Scarborough,   funding   and   political   entanglements   make   transit   relief   for   the   Downtown   seem   distant.      Surface  streetcar  routes  within  the  Downtown  paint  a  similarly  dire  situation.  With   the   TTC   adding   new   streetcar   routes   along   the   Harbourfront   without   adding   new   cars  to  the  fleet  in  2000,  a  long  overdue  higher  capacity  streetcar  fleet  is  slated  to   bolster   key   routes   by   late   summer   2014.   Apart   form   increased   capacity   of   cars,   there  is  no  fleet  plan  to  increase  surface  service  levels  on  streetcar  routes  (Munro,   2014).   As   transit   commentator   Steve   Munro   notes,   streetcar   service   has   increased   only   10%   between   1998   and   2014,   indicative   of   a   widening   disconnect   between   infrastructure  and  growth  rates  (Ibid).

   It   is   difficult   for   quantitative-focused   livability   indexes   to   properly   capture   what   life   is   like   for   residents   of   a   given   residential   development.   Even   subjective   conceptions   of   life   in   tall   buildings   are   coloured   with   sophisticated   lifestyle   marketing   and   the   cosmopolitan  images  that  are  unlikely  representations  of  the  practical  concerns  and   values  of  everyday  people.        In   order   to   draw   out   what   matters   to   residents,   we   can   look   to   the   City   of   Toronto's   Living   in   Downtown   and   the   Centres   Survey   (2012),   which   indicates   the   following   key   findings   around   satisfaction,   housing   priorities   and   quality   of   life   according   to   residents:      · · 47%  of  Downtown  residents  plan  to  move  in  the  next  five  years   The   top   reason   given   for   planning   to   move   was   to   seek   a   larger   unit   with   more  rooms.   ·    The  first  finding  is  very  significant  as  a  potential  indicator  of  satisfaction  with  high- density   living.      That   almost   half   of   respondents   (47%)   indicated   that   they   anticipated   moving   in   the   next   5   years   signals   that   current   living   conditions   are   unsatisfactory   in   the   short   term.      The   reasons   given   for   wanting   to   move   is   instructive  to  planners  and  policymakers:

   Given   these   results,   we   can   make   a   number   of   inferences.      First,   Downtown   residents  like  where  they  live.  Downtown  was  ranked  8.2  out  of  10  on  average  for   neighbourhood  satisfaction  (City  of  Toronto,  2013),  and  the  vast  majority  of  survey   respondents  want  to  stay  in  their  current  area.    However  the  most  common  reason   given  for  moving  is  a  lack  of  space.    Interestingly,  as  section  ii  of  the  above  tells  us,   nearly   60%   expect   their   next   residence   to   be   within   a   high-density   condominium,   apartment  or  townhouse.          This  data  presents  a  challenging  scenario:  almost  half  of  respondents  want  to  move   because  their  unit  is  too  small  to  suit  their  short  term  needs,   yet   they  want  to  stay   Downtown  and  they  anticipate  living  in  a  similar  high-density  housing  type  as  they   do  currently.  

Quality  of  Life  Indicator:  Small  Unit  Sizes  
   As   small   unit   sizes   are   the   main   reason   for   almost   half   of   survey   respondents   wanting   to   move,   it   demonstrates   that   perceptions   of   small   living   spaces   are   a   main   determinant  of  the  quality  of  life  of  residents.    The  following  two  sections  focus  on   high-density   condominium   developments,   as   they   represent   disproportionately   large  shares  of  the  housing  stock  in  the  Downtown.        Addressing   the   issue   of   smaller   unit   sizes   comprehensively   would   require   scope   beyond  that  of  this  discussion.  The  following  sections  look  to  two  pertinent  planning   issues   directly   related   to   the   perceived   lack   of   living   space.   These   sections   were   selected   for   several   reasons.   First,   they   relate   to   recently   released   datasets   that   quantify   the   priorities   of   people   living   downtown,   which   is   consistent   with   the   methodological   approach   taken   here   ­   which   is,   that   perceptions   are   what   really   13  

  

matter  in  terms  of  quality  of  life.    Second,  the  following  two  sections  are  recurring   issues   in   the   media   and   political   circles   and   have   a   time-sensitive   aspect   that   suggests  a  critical  discussion  around  them  is  timely.        It  is  important  to  note  that  the  following  sections  are  pieces  of  a  larger  story  ­  they   are  not  intended  to  be  comprehensive.  It  must  be  mentioned  that  market  dynamics   shaping   development   patterns   downtown   are   a   central   determinant   of   ever- shrinking   floor   areas.   As   investment   properties,   smaller   units   are   especially   desirable  as  their  carrying  costs  (condo  fees  and  property  taxes)  are  lower  as  they   are   calculated   per   square   foot.      To   developers,   units   on   the   smaller   side   of   the   spectrum   represent   the   `sweet   spot'   that   are   easiest   to   sell   in   presale   stages,   thus   increasing   the   likelihood   of   securing   financing   for   the   development   (Perkins,   2014).   This,   combined   with   `assignments'   (flipping   before   units   are   completed)   and   questions   around   design   and   demographics,   illustrates   that   a   broad   range   of   planning  and  market  considerations  are  driving  the  trend  toward  smaller  units.     

Section  1.A:    Small  Unit  Sizes  and  Common  Spaces  
   The  turn  of  the  century  has  seen  fundamental  shifts  in  how  people  are  choosing  to   live.      Downtown   Toronto   has   been   on   the   vanguard   of   these   shifts,   with   preferences   for   high-density   urban   life   making   remarkable   gains   over   larger,   lower   density   housing  options  on  the  urban  periphery.    Even  within  the  housing  typologies  of  high   density   living   ­   often   in   tall   buildings   -   the   shape   of   dwellings   within   vertical   communities  is  shifting.

Already  small  unit  sizes  throughout  the  GTA  are  shrinking  especially  fast  in  the  most   intensified   areas.   Over   the   last   10   years,   the   average   unit   size   of   new   residential   units  in  the  Downtown  has  shrunk  by  8  percent.  It  is  also  increasingly  common  for   new  developments  to  offer  `micro'  units  in  the  390  sq.  ft.  range,  a  trend  that  some   developers  insist  is  not  pushing  the  boundaries  of  livability  (Perkins,  2014).      The  results  of  the  Living  in  the  Downtown  and  the  Centres  Survey  (2012)  seem  to   contradict  this  claim,  given  that  47%  of  residents  intend  to  move  within  the  next  5   years,  with  the  main  reason  for  moving  being  to  find  a  larger  unit.  In  the  context  of   this,   the   challenge   facing   planners   is   multifaceted.   Can   small   living   spaces   in   Downtown's   high-density   developments   be   augmented   by   strategies   to   provide   common   spaces   outside   of   personal   homes?   Perhaps   more   importantly,   will   innovative   approaches   to   common   spaces   offer   sufficient   quality   of   life   benefits   to   convince  current  residents  to  stay  in  their  current  units?   Common  spaces  as  a  solution  to  small  living  spaces      A   common   line   of   thinking   from   a   real   estate   and   marketing   perspective   suggests   that   a   cosmopolitan   social   and   consumer   life   around   buildings   offsets   small   living   spaces   inside   buildings.   The  
Zoning By-Law Chapter 15 Residential Apartment   15.10.40.50  Decks,  Platforms  and  Amenities   (1)   Amenity  Space  for  an  Apartment  Building      In  the  RA  zone,  an  apartment  building  with  20  or   more  dwelling  units  must  provide  amenity  space  at   a  minimum  rate  of  4.0  square  metres  for  each   dwelling  unit,  of  which:      (A)   at  least  2.0  metres  for  each  dwelling  unit  is   indoor  amenity  space;   (B)   at  least  40.0  square  metres  is  outdoor   amenity  space  in  a  location  adjoining  or   directly  accessible  to  the  indoor  amenity   space;  and   (C)   no  more  than  25%  of  the  outdoor  component   may  be  a  green  roof.  
  

suggestion   that   small   units   force   people   outside   of   their   private   spaces   and   therefore   invigorate   public   life   is   matched   by   marketing   strategies   that   portray   the   modern   urban   dweller   as   too   social,   work-oriented   and/or   wealthy   to   desire   or   require   additional   space   (Langolis,   2012,   p.108).  Architects  take  a  more  fulsome  

  

  

approach,  suggesting  that  the  smaller  unit  sizes  associated  with  high-density  living   ought  to  be  harmoniously  coordinated  with  open  spaces  and  natural  landscapes  in   order  to  work  for  their  inhabitants  (Gyarmati,  2008).        15  

The   urban   planning   perspective   adds   to   this   by   ensuring   that   indoor   as   well   as   outdoor  common  space1  for  the  exclusive  use  of  residents  is  also  present.  The  policy   framework   in   Toronto   has   led   planners   representing   the   City   and   subsequent   Ontario   Municipal   Board   decisions   to   interpret   indoor   amenity   spaces   as   way   to   compensate  for  smaller  unit  sizes  in  high-density  residential  buildings  (Brant  Park   Inc.  v.  City  of  Toronto,  2013).  This  also  may  have  been  the  intent  of  City  of  Toronto   Zoning  By-law  569-2013  (see  right),  which  requires  private  indoor  amenity  space  to   provide   recreation   and   socialization   space   for   residents   without   placing   undue   burden   on   public   amenities.   The   Official   Plan   also   confirms   the   need   for   amenity   spaces  in  more  general  terms.        Although  required  by  the  ZBL,  the  idea  that  amenity  spaces  are  part  of  the  solution   to  small  units  is  not  explicit  in  policy.  This  de  facto  position  of  the  City  was  put  to  the   test  in  the  OMB  decision  Brant  Park  Inc.  v  City  of  Toronto.  The  developer  made  the   case   to   the   board   that   the   proposed   11   storey,   243   unit   residential   development   reduce  the  indoor  amenity  space  from  the  486  sq  m  required  by  the  ZBL  to  98  sq  m,   stating   that   residents   understand   that   relying   more   on   surrounding   outdoor   activities   and   services   was   part   of   the   "lifestyle   expectation"   (Ibid,   p.4,   s.14).   In   a   significant   decision,   the   board   ruled   in   favour   of   the   City,   stating   that   parks,   community  facilities  and  surrounding  outdoor  amenities  (bars  and  restaurants)  are   not   an   appropriate   substitute   for   indoor   amenity   space   (Ibid).   Although   it   is   not   explicitly   articulated   in   policy,   it   is   clear   that   both   the   City   and   the   OMB   consider   indoor   amenity   spaces   to   be   important   to   the   quality   of   life   for   those   living   in   vertical  communities.      While   the   literature   on   the   importance   of   common   spaces   often   does   not   refer   to   condo  amenities  specifically,  they  do  fit  under  a  body  of  work  that  considers  `third   spaces'.   A   `third   place'   is   somewhere   that   one   can   relax   and   have   the   opportunity   to                                                                                                                   
1  This  refers  to  amenity  spaces,  which  are  typically  associated  with  condominium  residential  

developments.    Outdoor  amenities  are  privately  owned  and  publically  accessible,  whereas  indoor   amenities  are  for  exclusive  use  of  residents.    Indoor  amenity  spaces  include:  game  rooms,  gyms,  party

socialize   in   without   judgement,   used   as   a   kind   of   retreat   or   counterpoint   from   the   `first'  and  `second'  places  of  home  and  work  (Oldenburg  and  Brissett,  1982).  While   usually   used   in   reference   to   the   public   realm,   it   is   also   recognized   that   there   are   many   privately   owned   third   spaces,   which   could   include   cafés,   bookstores   and   condo  amenity  spaces  (though  these  would  only  be  accessible  to  building  residents).   The   research   on   third   spaces   emphasizes   the   importance   of   these   places   for   socialization   and   community   interaction.   Living   environments   lacking   access   to   these  third  spaces  are  likely  to  produce  lower  quality  of  life  "as  a  consequence  of  the   increasing   narrowness   of   people's   spheres   of   involvement   with   others"   (Ibid,   p.282).   Interestingly,   almost   all   of   the   literature   on   third   spaces   focuses   only   on   social   and   environmental   elements   contributing   to   sense   of   place,   quality   of   experience   and   assigning   personalized   meaning   to   the   experience   (Laing   and   Royle,   2013).  The  literature  does  not  explicitly  state  that  third  spaces  play  a  functional  role   in   terms   of   providing   additional   living   space   ­   this   connection   is   implied   and   qualitative  at  best.      Getting   back   to   the   idea   that   quality   of   life   is   about   the   perceptions   of   people;   we   now   turn   to   what   residents   think   of   amenity   spaces   as   a   solution   to   small   units.   At   a   recent   City   of   Toronto   public   meeting   that   considered   the   impact   of   growth   and   change  in  the  King-Spadina  area  of  Downtown  Toronto,  a  participant  expressed  that   in-building   amenities   are   important   as   third   spaces   away   from   offices   and   relatively   small  units  (King-Spadina  Built  Form  Study,  November  25th,  2013).  This  sentiment   finds   further   ground   in   a   City   of   Toronto   initiated   public   consultation   with   Downtown   condominium   residents,   where   the   majority   of   attendees   agreed   that   amenity  spaces  were  important  to  preserve  as  they  were  seen  as  additional  usable   spaces   that   represented   one   of   the   few   ways   to   strengthen   a   sense   of   community   inside   the   building   (SWERHUN,   2013).   Interestingly,   75.7%   of   survey   respondents   from  the  same  consultation  indicated  that  there  were  sufficient  social  amenities  like   patios,  rooftop  spaces  and  common  areas  in  their  buildings  (Ibid).

Based  on  these  consultation  results,  amenities  are  important  both  as  an  additional   space  and  as  a  place  for  socializing.  Most  importantly,  most  residents  consider  them   to  be  currently  meeting  their  needs.  This  indicated  satisfaction  with  amenities  may   be   complicated   by   motivations   of   cost   savings   rather   than   use   value   and   quality.     This   was   clearly   indicated   in   the   Condo   Consultation   survey   cited   above,   as   residents   saw   amenities   as   important,   but   had   serious   reservations   around   their   impacts  on  condo  fees  (Ibid).        Under   the   condo   tenure   model   in   Ontario,   monthly   condo   fees   are   charged   per   square   foot   of   the   unit   purchased   by   the   individual,   and   then   divided   between   reserve   funds   for   capital   expenses   and   operating   costs   (which   would   include   maintenance   costs   for   amenities).   Simply   put,   the   more   extensive   the   amenity   package,   the   higher   the   operating   costs   and   therefore   the   higher   the   condo   fee   charged   to   the   resident(s).   As   amenity   spaces   age,   they   tend   to   become   more   expensive  to  maintain,  thus  driving  condo  fees  up.    A  Globe  and  Mail  article  points   out   that   condo   fees   in   aging   buildings   on   Queens   Quay   can   run   $700-800   per   month   for  a  unit  of  1,000  sq  ft  (Chada,  2013).    If,  for  instance,  a  major  maintenance  issue   occurs,  as  was  the  case  with  the  tar  leak  and  subsequent  pool  closure  of  the  TCHC   owned   St.   James   town   pool   in   2010   (Dempsey,   2010)   condo   owners   will   be   faced   with  the  choice  between  `mothballing'  amenities  or  to  shoulder  large  scale  increases   in  condo  fees.      Given   that   residents   want   to   keep   costs   down,   but   also   value   amenity   spaces   as   important,  we  need  to  consider  how  they  are  being  used.

"I have lived in a condo for over 20 years and never use the amenities. The fitness equipment in the building is very popular with many residents. Eliminating amenity space would help to keep maintenance cost down."   "I like the convenience of having amenities directly in my building"   "Developers should be guided by the actual use of in-house amenities. Swimming pools, for example, do not seem to be sufficiently used to justify the added maintenance costs. Party rooms and gyms are always busy." "I usually see that the condo amenities aren't enough to support the residents of the condo"

In   terms   of   quality,   a   sample   of   resident   comments   laid   out   in   Table   5   echo   the   Condominium  Consultation  summary  feedback  and  media  coverage  to  suggest  that   while  specific  amenities  are  over-used  (party  rooms,  rooftop  patios,  gyms)  others  go   unused   and   should   be   eliminated   to   reduce   costs   (SWERHUN;   Chada;   Fleming   2012).   This   challenge   is   partly   due   condo   buildings   with   high   proportions   of   non- resident  owners,  who  sign  agreements  that  include  amenity  packages  that  will  not   affect  them  directly,  and  therefore  less  consideration  is  given  to  their  practical  use   (Consultant_  1).      The   question   facing   planners   and   developers   then   becomes   ­   how   to   provide   a   better  quality  of  life  through  indoor  amenity  spaces  that  are  desirable  by  residents   while  keeping  costs  down?   Section  1.A:  Innovative  approaches  to  indoor  common  spaces      In  this  section  we  set  out  to  explore  whether  indoor  common  spaces  could  be  used   as   part   of   a   solution   to   address   residents'   concerns   of   small   living   spaces   in   high- density   residential   units   in   Downtown   Toronto.   Through   the   discussion   so   far,   together   with   recently   released   from   the   City   of   Toronto's   Condominium   Consultation,  we  have  established  the  following:      · · · · Condominium  indoor  amenity  spaces  are  important  to  residents.   While   seen   as   important,   there   is   a   high   concern   over   operating   and   maintenance  costs  in  the  form  of  condo  fees.   Popular   amenities   are   over-used,   while   others   are   not   well   used   and   are   seen  as  a  financial  burden.   While   common   spaces   have   been   linked   to   social   and   community   benefits,   it   is  unclear  whether  they  are  a  sufficient  solution  to  small  living  spaces.      

   Taking   these   points   into   account,   the   following   section   explores   innovative   ways   forward  and  explores  examples,  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  each.   Potential  Solution:  Pooled  Indoor  Amenity  Spaces

Indoor  amenity  spaces  are  considered  club  goods  in  economic  terms,  meaning  they   are   excludable   services   provided   to   those   who   buy   in,   and   are   non-rivalrous   (Warner,   2011).   However,   considering   that   the   well-used   amenities   are   overburdened   (e.g.   relatively   small   gyms   are   busy   and   crowded;   party   rooms   booked   well   in   advance)   the   element   of   rivalry   is   most   certainly   an   issue.   Warner   presents   an   interesting   approach   by   suggesting   we   think   beyond   the   club:      "The   challenge   for   planners   is   to   think   of   what   other   roles   government   might   play   to   promote   a   more   sustainable   and   equitable   role   of   clubs   in   an   urban   system"   (Ibid.   p.164).   This   certainly   makes   sense   in   terms   of   efficient   resource   provision.   Given   that  the  City  is  financially  constrained  to  provide  resources,  it  does  not  make  sense   for   seven   swimming   pools   to   be   provided   privately   within   two   city   blocks   (Consultant_1).      If   Warner   and   the   key   informant   are   saying   that   there   might   be   a   role   for   government  in  resolving  some  of  the  challenges  around  private  amenity  provision,  it   is  a  useful  lens  in  which  to  consider  the  findings  of  the  City  of  Toronto  Condominium   Consultation.  In  designing  the  survey  and  shaping  talking  points  for  public  meetings   around  this  work,  the  City  of  Toronto  Planning  Division  attempted  an  approach  that   looked   beyond   on-site   amenity   micro-issues   and   instead   tested   ideas   to   address   the   amenity  provision  problem  on  a  broader  scale.          A   talking   asked   point/survey   participants   question   if   they   designed  with  this  broader  approach  in   mind   supported   the   idea   that   developers   could   reduce   the   amount   of   amenity   space   they   provide   (as   currently   required   by   the   ZBL)   in   individual   buildings   if   they   instead   contributed   toward  the  creation  of  a  neighbourhood

p.31).   Consultation   participants   generally   supported   this   idea,   suggesting   that   this   `neighbourhood  community  facility'  should  be  provided  in  lieu  of  the  less  frequently   used  amenities.  While  still  in  the  exploratory  phase,  the  concept  is  to  provide  indoor   amenity   space   that   is   flexible   in   design   and   programming,   allowing   for   social,   community  and  recreational  programming.      The  form  this  neighbourhood  community  facility  would  take  could  be  modelled  on   the   proposed   community   recreation   hub   detailed   in   the   Alexandra   Park   Revitalization   Plan   (as   suggested   by   Planner_1   and   UrbanDesigner_1).   The   plan   outlines   a   centrally   located   stand   alone   building   containing   both   private   and   publically   accessible   indoor   amenity   space   intended   to   serve   a   cluster   of   high   and   low  rise  residential  buildings  as  well  as  the  surrounding  community.  The  hub  will  be   owned,   programmed   and   maintained   by   TCHC   and   the   Atkinson   Housing   Co- operative  members  (Urban  Strategies,  2013).      Although  the  management  structure  for  a  condo  development  would  look  different   and   would   undoubtedly   present   logistical   complications 2 ,   the   Alexandra   Park   Revitalization   model   meets   the   expressed   need   of   residents   to   retain   some   amenities  as  private,  while  also  offering  a  host  of  other  benefits.    These  include:  a)   Increasing   the   publicly   accessible   stock   of   amenities   for   the   benefit   of   the   all   members   of   the   public;   and   b)   Potentially   improving   quality   due   to   economies   of   scale;   and   c)   Lowering   condo   fees   by   imposing   user   fees   where   appropriate   on   non- residents  for  the  public  component  of  the  indoor  amenities.  However,  the  logistics  of   providing  such  a  facility  on  private  land  would  require  financial  incentives  of  some   form   to   be   provided   to   the   developer   by   the   City,   and   would   be   administratively   difficult  if  the  space  were  shared  by  multiple  landowner  organizations.                                                                                                                         2  The  biggest  barrier  to  this  idea  is  that  in  a  TCHC  situation,  land  would  be  publically  owned,  whereas  
this  would  not  be  the  case  in  a  facility  shared  by  any  more  than  one  developer.  The  notion  that  the   public  would  have  access  such  a  facility  worried  some  survey  respondents,  who  raised  issues  with   security.  A  key  informant  suggested  that  this  latter  issue  might  be  overcome  by  using  separate   entrances  for  the  public  portion  and  the  `residents  only'  portion  of  the  space  (UrbanDesigner_1).

Logistical  stumbling  blocks  aside,  this  model  could  also  hold  additional  benefits  for   building  community,  as  these  `third  spaces'  would  reach  beyond  individual  buildings   to   a   neighbourhood   level.   As   current   building-by-building   indoor   amenity   spaces   only   offer   space   for   interaction   within   a   given   building,   a   community   recreation   hub   or  neighbourhood  community  facility  holds  potential  for  increasing  social  cohesion   across   buildings   in   a   vertical   communities.      This   also   has   the   potential   to   open   up   amenities  and  social  interactions  across  a  more  diverse  income  range,  as  it  features   a  publicly  accessible  component.        On  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  an  alternate,  less  ambitious  Downtown  Toronto   example   exists   that   has   taken   up   the   idea   of   pooled   amenity   spaces.   The   Harbour   View   Estates   luxury   condo   development   complex   incorporates   4   tall   buildings   (5   and  10  Navy  Wharf  and  5  and  35  Mariner  Terrace).  Residents  of  all  buildings  share   access   to   "Superclub"   facilities   and   private   courtyard   with   water   features.      The   Superclub   is   a   massive   30,000   sq   ft   indoor   amenity   space   featuring   the   most   luxurious   facilities   in   the   City   (Dash   Property   Management,   2012).   However,   the   Superclub  takes  advantage  of  economies  of  scale  as  it  is  shared  by  so  many  units  ­   even   as   the   amenities   offered   are   more   extensive   and   of   ostensibly   higher   quality,   the  condo  fees  are  on  the  lower  end  of  the  spectrum  for  Downtown  Toronto  at  58   cents  per  sq.  ft  based  on  a  sample  unit  listing  in  35  Mariner  Terrace.3  Although  this   approach  does  not  contribute  to  publicly  accessible  amenities  and  is  more  limited  in   its   potential   for   achieving   social   goals   when   compared   to   the   Alexandra   Park   example,   it   provides   a   more   practical   solution   and   keeps   condo   fees   down   while   providing  a  higher  quality  third  space  that  extends  beyond  a  single  building.      A   third   example   takes   this   idea   further.   In   response   to   neighbourhood   pressure,   Lanterra   Developments,   along   with   councillor   Wong-Tam   proposed   that   parkland   dedications  owed  by  the  developer  from  multiple  developments  spread  throughout   the   Downtown   be   `pooled'   to   create   a   higher   quality   greenspace   on   one   site   (11

Wellesley)  in  a  parks-deficient  area  (LaRusic,  2013).  Although  this  section  does  not   look  at  outdoor  amenity  space  (and  recognizing  that  parkland  dedication  is  outside   the   scope   of   this   discussion),   it   is   interesting   to   speculate   how   this   `pooling'   could   work  to  increase  the  quality  of  indoor  amenities.  If  zoning  requirements  or  Section   37   agreements   for   the   provision   of   indoor   amenity   space   could   be   pooled   in   a   similar   way   (which   would   require   an   OPA),   perhaps   we   could   see   amenities   that   serve  residents  living  in  small  units  better.    This  would  present  challenges4,  but  also   could   provide   services   that   focus   more   on   quality   versus   quantity,   a   guiding   principle  supported  by  many  practitioners  (UrbanDesigner_1).     

Challenges:  Pooled  Amenity  Spaces  
   As  most  of  this  section  has  considered  solutions  to  small  living  spaces  in  the  context   of   condos,   it   is   useful   to   step   back   and   consider   the  larger   picture.   It   is   important   to   recognize  that  condos  are  not  simply  a  relatively  new  form  of  tenure  and  ownership.   They   also   carry   dramatic   implications   for   physical   design   (see   Toronto's   Downtown   skyline),  social  governance,  security  and  social  status.  Rosen  and  Walks  (2013)  are   helpful  for  the  purposes  of  our  discussion,  as  they  attest  that  condos  are  "redefining   traditional  boundaries  of  public  and  private  spaces"(p.161).        In  their  investigation  of  how  condo-led  growth  is  transforming  Downtown  Toronto,   Rosen  and  Walks  found  empirical  evidence  (albeit  with  a  small  sample  size)  that  the   single  biggest  predictor  for  supporting  `privatization  of  public  services'  (no  further   explanation   was   given   in   the   survey)   was   being   a   condo   resident   in   Downtown   Toronto  (2013,  p.168).  This  supports  the  idea  that  this  form  of  tenure  is  `remaking'   downtowns  on  a  social  level,  and  may  suggest  that  condo  dwellers  are  more  apt  to   support  privatization  of  public  life  than  other  residents.                                                                                                                       4  Issues  include  some  residents  gaining  more  benefit  by  being  closer,  and  others  having  to  travel  to  
use  said  amenities.  A  definition  of  reasonable  distance  and  access  would  likely  be  contentious.  It   must  be  noted  that  the  developments  in  the  Lanterra  proposal  are  described  as  being  very  close  to   each  other.

The   Condominium   Consultation   draws   out   this   theme   the   talking   point/survey   question   mentioned   earlier   that   asked   participants   if   they   supported   the   idea   that   developers   could   reduce   the   amount   of   amenity   space   they   provide   (as   currently   required  by  the  ZBL)  in  individual  buildings  if  they  instead  contributed  toward  the   creation  of  a  neighbourhood  community  facility5  for  public  and  condo  resident  use.   While   public   meeting   response   seemed   supportive,   this   idea   was   one   of   the   least   popular   of   all   on   the   Condominium   Consultation   online   survey,   with   only   35%   of   respondents   indicating   any   level   of   support   (SWERHUN).   Issues   raised   included   costs   of   management   and   maintenance,   liability,   safety   and   the   perceived   `taking   away'  of  the  few  amenities  available  to  residents.  Most  of  all,  online  comments  were   concerned   that   homeowners   would   be   making   double   the   contribution   for   community  facilities  by  paying  taxes  as  well  as  funding  a  community  centre.      The   survey   results   clearly   demonstrate   that   Downtown   condominium   residents   currently   exhibit   very   low   support   for   publically   accessible   amenity   components,   confirming   to   some   degree   Walks   and   Rosen's   assertion   that   this   group   is   more   supportive  of  the  privatization  of  urban  life.        The  model  of  shared  yet  exclusive  (non-public)  access  to  amenity  sites  outlined  in   the   Harbour   View   Estates   `Superclub'   example   may   still   be   an   attractive   option   to   residents,  however.  If  more  developments  occurring  in  close  proximities  could  pool   their  resources  to  create  pooled  amenities  of  better  quality  and  somewhat  broader   potential   for   social   interaction,   it   may   have   potential   to   improve   quality   of   life   outcomes  regarding  small  living  spaces.   Common  Spaces  as  a  Solution  to  Small  Living  Spaces  -  Summary      This   section   looked   at   the   potential   for   indoor   common   spaces   as   a   solution   to   address   the   problem   of   small   living   spaces.   Resident   feedback   from   the   King-                                                                                                                 

5  This  neighbourhood  community  facility  is  also  referred  to  as  a  `pooled  amenity  space'.    Generally,  

this  is  understood  to  be  a  standalone  or  adjoined  structure  that  provides  indoor  amenities  for  more   than  one  building.

Spadina  Built  Form  Study  and  the  Condominium  Consultation  Rounds  1  &  2  outlined   several  key  priorities.  First,  indoor  common  spaces  are  important  to  quality  of  life   for  residents,  but  they  were  also  viewed  cautiously.    Second,  well-liked  spaces  like   gyms   and   party   rooms   were   frequently   over-burdened   and   over   used,   while   less   used   amenities   were   seen   as   increasing   condo   fees   over   time   with   ongoing   maintenance  and  operating  costs.        Suggestions   around   innovative   approaches   to   a   more   collective   approach   to   amenities   generated   a   divisive   response.      While   respondents   were   eager   to   access   better   quality   amenities   at   lower   cost,   a   majority   opposed   any   solutions   to   pooled   amenities  that  offered  a  public  access  component,  citing  concerns  over  management   and   the   idea   that   they   would   be   `paying   double'   through   condo   fees   and   property   taxes.        Based   on   these   findings,   the   connection   between   amenities   and   quality   of   life   appears   to   be   tied   more   closely   with   social   and   recreational   aspects   rather   than   being  a  part  of  the  solution  for  living  space.  However,  this  increasing  social  cohesion   does  have  the  potential  to  increase  place  attachment  and  quality  of  life  aspects,  as   several  empirical  studies  show  that  friendliness  of  neighbours  and  interactions  with   familiar  faces  rate  very  highly  in  terms  of  neighbourhood  satisfaction  (in  Chapman   and  Lombard,  2002,  p.774).  Summary  evidence  from  the  Condominium  Consultation   also  supports  this  claim,  citing  the  importance  of  amenities  to  community  building   (SWERHUN).      Aside   from   the   social   potential   of   amenity   spaces,   it   is   not   clear   whether  they  play  a  significant  role  in  addressing  concerns  over  small  unit  sizes.   Small  living  spaces:  Stakeholder  Responses      Stakeholders   confirm   these   suspicions   that   innovative   approaches   to   indoor   amenities  will  not  be  enough  to  address  concerns  over  small  living  spaces.        In   terms   of   publically   accessible   pooled   spaces,   it   was   emphasized   that   while   they   would  represent  a  more  integrated  approach  to  planning,  they  require  a  proactive      25  

design.   In   built   out   areas,   it   would   be   very   onerous   to   coordinate   shared   spaces   among   different   buildings   through   retrofits   (Consultant_1,   UrbanDesigner_1).   Further,   the  management   structure  could  become  extremely  complicated,  which   is   likely  to  be  seen  by  residents  as  a  threat  to  quality  of  life  outcomes  (Consultant_1).        As  for  solutions  to  small  living  spaces,  a  key  informant  suggested  that  simple,  finer   grain   solutions   would   be   more   effective.   Providing   for   more   adequate   storage   space   that   compensates   for   small   unit   sizes   has   a   big   impact   on   improving   living   space.   Information   sharing   sessions   on   strategies   and   design   tools   for   maximizing   space   may   also   have   tangible   impacts   for   better   adjusting   to   life   in   limited   spaces   (Consultant_1).   It   was   emphasized   that   a   better   understanding   of   the   micro-level   details  of  the  challenges  in  living  in  small  spaces  (e.g.  small  closets,  lack  of  storage   spaces  for  cleaning  supplies)  could  help  to  identify  a  number  of  smaller,  quick  fixes   that   could   have   a   demonstrable   cumulative   impact   on   quality   of   life   without   involving   undue   cost   and   management   complexity   (Consultant_1).   Based   on   considerable   experience   with   condo   related   planning   issues,   informants   felt   that   a   discussion   around   what   constitutes   a   minimum   livable   unit   size   is   long   overdue   (Consultant_1,  UrbanDesigner_1,  Planner_1).        Perhaps   the   most   instructive   insight   was   that   while   usable   common   spaces   inside   the   building   together   with   a   suite   of   amenities   in   the   surrounding   neighbourhood   were   instrumental   for   a   high   quality   of   life,   they   would   not   be   enough   to   mitigate   people  wanting  to  move  to  a  larger  living  space.  If  unit  spaces  are  perceived  as  small   -  as  they  are  in  the  Living  in  the  Downtown  and  the  Centres  survey  (2012)  -  a  large   segment   of   residents   in   high-density   vertical   neighbourhoods   will   want   to   move   (Consultant_1;  UrbanDesigner_1;  Planner_1).        While  small  units  do  have  their  place,  informants  to  this  discussion  stress  that  this   high-rise   condo   typology   is   being   produced   disproportionately.   As   these   units   are   geared   to   young   professionals   and   empty-nesters,   they   are   not   necessarily   compatible   through   age   and   family   life-cycle   continuums,   as   many   contemporary   26  

  

designs   are   `aspirational'   lifestyle   choices   that   often   exclude   many   segments   of   society,   such   as   urban   households   with   children   (Martel,   2014,   p.30).      This   is   in   line   with  perspectives  from  Councillor  Adam  Vaughn  and  architect  Andreas  Duany,  who   lament   that   the   lack   of   diversity   in   housing   typologies   threatens   the   longevity   of   Downtown  neighbourhoods  (Keenan,  2014).        Based   on   data   and   on   the   perspectives   of   key   stakeholders,   this   investigation   concedes  that  common  spaces  are  not  sufficient  to  provide  enough  additional  living   space   to   convince   residents   with   concerns   over   physical   housing   size   to   stay.      The   bigger   picture   perspective   suggests   that   a   better   mix   of   shapes,   sizes   and   designs   of   high-density   housing   would   provide   a   greater   range   of   housing   options   that   could   better  address  spatial  concerns  and  lead  to  a  higher  quality  of  life  for  residents.  

Section  1B:  A  range  of  housing  as  a  solution  to  small  living  spaces    
   Section   2.2.1,   Policy   1   of   the   Official   Plan   (2006)   states   that   it   will   accommodate   development  that  supports  a  full  range  of  housing  options.  Urbanist  Andres  Duany   suggests  the  City  is  far  from  meeting  this  aspiration,  claiming  that  one  of  Toronto's   main   issues   was   that   its   residential   buildings   are   concentrated   at   extremes:   They   are   either   very   large   towers   or   they   are   house-sized.      This   opinion   is   shared   by   Willcocks   (2011,   p.   81)   in   her   assessment   of   Official   Plan   policies   encouraging   a   diversity  of  housing:  
Chapter   3,   Section   3.3,   Building   New   Neighbourhoods,   describes   the   general   guidelines   for   planning  new  neighbourhoods,  with  policy  stating  that  they  will  be  "viable  as  communities"   and   have   "a   housing   mix   that   contributes   to   the   full   range   of   housing"   (p.   3-23).   This   last   policy  does  not  clearly  specify  that   each  neighbourhood  should  have  a  full  range  of  housing,   only   that   the   city   as   a   whole   should;   however,   this   goes   against   the   general   concept   of   a   complete  community   ­   one   where   people   of   all   ages   and   at   all   stages   of   life   have   access   to   jobs,  services,  and  housing  within  the  familiar  neighbourhood.    

  

While   the   City   has   been   making   strides   and   earning   accolades   in   studying   and   promoting   mid-rise   development   along   avenues   (City   of   Toronto,   2014),   this   approach   is   not   being   applied   to   the   Downtown.   While   a   better   mix   of   housing   typologies   might   be   preferable,   it   is   not   always   practical,   given   that   land   values   preclude   certain   typologies   from   being   practical   or   desirable.   Further   to   this   the      27  

intent  of  the  OP  can  be  interpreted  to  promote  a  range  of  housing  in  terms  of  unit   sizes   and   price   ranges   more   so   than   morphologies.   As   prices   and   unit   sizes   are   affected   by   density   in   built   out   areas   like   the   Downtown,   it   would   seem   that   stronger  policies  are  needed  to  ensure  that  the  range  of  housing  set  out  in  the  vision   of  the  OP  comes  into  being.6      The   Official   Plan   (2006)   specifies   in   2.2.1   Downtown   Policy   1.b   that   the   city   will   accommodate   development   that   provides   a   full   range   of   housing,   but   does   not   further   elaborate.   Toronto's   Tall   Buildings   Design   Guidelines   (2013)   suggest   a   specific   approach   to   tall   residential   buildings   that   holds   potential   to   broaden   the   range  of  housing  types.  The  Street  Animation  chapter  3.1.2  suggests  the  following:  
b.   On   streets   with   an   exclusively   residential   character,   line   the   base   building   with   grade- related   residential   units   with   usable   front   entrances   and   windows   to   living   spaces   facing   the   street.  

The   supporting   text   goes   on   to   say   that   "townhouse"   style   podiums   add   to   street-level   animation   in   a   number   of   ways   (interaction,   natural   surveillance)  and  broaden  the  range  of   housing   choices   (p.40).      These   "townhouse   podiums"   (image   1)   fit   under   the   broader   tower-base   form   typology   outlined   in   the   Downtown

Younger   respondents   living   in   high-density   dwellings   are   more   likely   to   move   within   five   years   than   any   other   age   group   because   of   their   position   in   the   family   life   cycle.   Howley   (2009)   suggests   that   urban   planners   and   designers   need   to   create   residential   areas   that   accommodate   all   stages   of   the   family   life   cycle   and   provide   a   high   level   of   stability   and   quality  of  life  for  residents  of  all  ages

This  directly  addresses  challenges  around  the  potential  for  mobility  of  residents  in   high-density  dwellings.  In  order  to  address  this,  more  family-friendly  units  must  be   added   to   the   housing   stock.8  A   proposed   Official   Plan   Amendment   was   raised   in   2010   at   the   behest   of   councillor   Adam   Vaughn,   recommending   that   any   new   developments   in   the   Downtown   of   100   or   more   units   include   at   least   10%   three   bedroom   units   or   a   combination   three   bedrooms   and   units   that   can   be   combined   to   make   a   larger   unit   through   `knock   out'   panels.   While   commentators   like   Willcocks   (2011)   take   the   position   that   that   this   is   the   way   forward   to   expand   the   range   of   housing  options,  this  could  be  made  more  meaningful/functional  by  combining  this   approach   with   children's   need   for   easy   access   to   ground-oriented   outdoor   play   areas,   as   raised   in   Vancouver's   High   Density   Housing   for   Families   with   Children   Guidelines.   As   ground-oriented   units   comprise   a   relatively   small   subsection   of   the   housing   stock,   promoting   family   units   in   the   townhouse   podiums   together   with   larger   units   on   the   upper   floors   (catering   to   groups   of   students,   persons   working   from  home,  etc.)  would  contribute  to  a  range  of  units  in  the  most  meaningful  way.        The   townhouse-podium   form   has   several   noteworthy   precedents   in   Downtown   Toronto.   The   Local   at   Ft.York   features   a   7-storey   townhouse-style   podium   with   active   frontages   and   a   13-storey   tower.   The   townhouse   offers   a   number   of   larger,   family  friendly  units  that  are  billed  as  2.5  bedroom  units  in  the  900-1400  sq  ft  range   (ONNI,   2014).   Stand-alone   stacked   townhouse   options   without   towers   in   lower- scale   neighbourhoods   are   another   way   to   broaden   options   while   increasing   density,   as  many  provide  larger  two  bedroom  plus  den  configurations  and  unique  floorplan   layouts   (Hanes,   2013).   Stacked   townhouses,   whether   as   a   part   of   a   podium   with   a   tower,   or   stand-alone,   are   part   of   a   solution   to   address   the   gap   between   the   extremes  of  Toronto's  `very  tall  or  very  small'  built-form.

Section  1:  Recommendations  
The   first   part   of   this   section   sought   to   explore   the   potential   of   indoor   amenity   spaces  as  a  solution  to  small  living  spaces  in  the  Downtown.  Investigation  into  the   issue   has   identified   that   innovative   approaches   to   amenities   are   not   likely   to   be   enough   to   lower   residential   mobility   rates   in   vertical   communities   with   high   proportions  of  small  units.  New  approaches  to  amenities  do,  however,  hold  potential   for   increasing   quality   of   life   in   other   areas   such   from   social   (community   building)   and   economic   (lower   condo   fees   and   better   quality   amenities)   perspectives.   Going   forward,  recommendations  include:   1. To  support  and  explore  pooled  amenities  where  appropriate,  looking  to  the   `Superclub'   example   at   Mariner   Terrace.   These   solutions   would   likely   be   exclusive   to   condo   residents,   due   to   low   levels   of   support   and   high   complexity  of  publically  accessible  pooled  amenity  spaces.      2. Combine   community   contributions   from   development,   as   seen   at   11Wellesley   with   opportunities   to   combine   parkland   dedications   should   be   further   explored   to   provide   higher   quality,   more   efficiently   produced   amenities.      3. Support   short   term   `quick   wins'.   These   could   include   identifying   specific   concerns  around  small  living  spaces  and  formulating  smaller  scale  solutions   through  space  saving  design  workshops  and  promoting  better  storage.      Based   on   feedback   form   key   informants,   the   second   section   found   that   a   key   part   of   a  strategy  to  address  concerns  with  small  unit  sizes  was  to  promote  a  broader  range   of   housing   options   in   keeping   with   the   intent   of   the   OP.   Recommendations   for   high- density,  tall  building  residential  development  in  the  Downtown  include:   1. Use   site   and   area-specific   plans   with   a   stronger   policy   framework   to   provide  a  broader  range  of  housing.  Build  on  existing  approaches  such  as  the   Mimico-by-the   Lake   Secondary   Plan,   which   requires   5%   units   to   be   three   bedrooms   (Planner_1).   A  more  fulsome  approach   would   require   that   5-7%   of   three   bedroom   family   friendly   units   be   provided   in   ground-related   townhouse  podiums;  together  with  an  additional  5-7%  of  larger  units  ­  not   necessarily   three   bedroom   ­   required   elsewhere   in   the   building.   This   recognizes   that   demand   for   larger   units   comes   from   a   variety   of   demographics.      2. Implement   stronger   planning   criteria   around   the   design,   orientation   and   layout   of   housing  ­  such  as  those  in  the  Development  Permits  System

   Taken  together,  the  provision  of  a  range  of  housing  options  is  the  key  challenge  in  

(addressed  in  Section  3)  ­  would  force  architects,  designers  and  developers   to   be   more   innovative   in   providing   larger   units   and   family-friendly   housing   in  cost-effective  ways.        3. Implement   frameworks   promoting   a   range   of   housing   in   a   timely   way.   As   Willcocks   (2011)   points   out,   development   along   the   waterfront   and   other   key   brownfield   sites   is   occurring   at   a   rapid   pace.   If   the   City   is   not   quick   enough   in   its   implementation   of   stronger   policies,   the   costs   of   this   missed   opportunity   will   be   dire   in   terms   of   social   diversity   and   high   residential   mobility  rates.  

addressing   quality   of   life   issues   around   smaller   living   spaces.   However,   urban   life   is   about   a   full   suite   of   elements   that   must   be   in   place   for   people   to   feel   that   their   neighbourhood  works  (UrbanDesigner_1).  The  next  section  considers  a  key  element   this   suite   of   elements   -   the   public   realm   around   the   building   and   how   it   relates   to   quality  of  life  for  Downtown  residents.

Section   2:   Life   Around   the   Building   ­   The   Public   Realm   and   Quality  of  Life  
   Given   the   urgency   around   challenges   of   small   living   spaces   that   accompany   recent   development   patterns   in   high-density   living   discussed   in   the   previous   section,   this   section   will   consider   how   outdoor   spaces   relate   to   quality   of   life   in   Downtown   Toronto.   Discussion   here   refers   to   the   public   realm,   where   `life   between   buildings   unfolds'.  This  domain  is  loosely  understood  as  streets,  alleys,  entryways,  parks,  open   spaces   and   bollards   (Gehl   &   Svarre,   2013).   As   studying   the   public   realm   entails   many  complex  components,  this  section  brief  discussion  focuses  on  an  assessment   tool   that   is   specifically   designed   to   give   a   data-rich   rationale   for   improving   the   public  realm  and  by  extension,  the  quality  of  Downtown  residents.

The   Living   in   the   Downtown   and   the   Centres   Survey   (2012)   finds   that   the   top   three   reasons  for  living  downtown  are  directly  related  to  walkability.

    Source:  Living  in  the  Downtown  and  the  Centres  Survey,  City  of  Toronto  (2012)      Taken   together,   walkability   is   a   key   component   of   42.1%   of   respondents'   choice   preferences  for  living  Downtown.  Mode  choice  for  work  trips  for  single  occupancy   vehicles  or  carpools  accounts  for  just  16%  of  trips  according  to  survey  respondents.   As   all   three   of   the   reasons   given   in   Table   6   therefore   rely   on   walking,   it   could   be   argued  that  walkability  is  a  vital  component  of  quality  of  life.  

Section  2A:  Where  we  walk  and  quality  of  life  
Barbie   Greenbie's   insights   into   how   we   see   our   streets   and   sidewalks   are   a   good   starting   point   to   thinking   about   these   aspects   of   the   street.   Greenbie's   analysis   concluded  that  streets  and  sidewalks  are  often  seen  strictly  as  conduits  ­  although   they  are  public  spaces  because  they  are  built  and  funded  by  public  agencies,  they  are      33  

considered  as  such  only  in  a  categorical  sense  (1981).  As  a  key  informant  and  expert   in   the   area   suggested,   the   public   is   slowly   coming   around   to   consciously   recognizing   the  importance  of  streets  and  sidewalks  to  the  public  realm  (UrbanDesigner_1).      Unfortunately,   this   awareness   is   less   about   an   appreciation   for   sense   of   place   and   more   about   a   tangible   sense   that   sidewalks   are   overburdened.   The   discussion   around  the  amount  of  density  Downtown  has  extended  beyond  transit  concerns  in   the   media   recently,   with   academics,   public   consultation   messaging   and   soundbites   from   the   Chief   Planner   acknowledging   that   people   are   "falling   off   of   sidewalks"   (Keenan,   2014).   However,   as   a   key   informant   points   out,   this   attention   to   sidewalks   also   presents   opportunities   to   leverage   public   concern   to   create   innovative   solutions  for  sidewalks  that  are  places  as  well  as  conduits  (UrbanDesigner_1).        Sidewalks  and  streets  are  especially  important  in  the  context  of  constraints  around   the  provision  of  greenspace.  As  parkland  per  capita  is  lowest  in  older,  built  up  areas,   and  the  availability  and  price  of  Downtown  land  is  recognized  as  a  major  barrier,  the   City   recommends   "rethinking"   existing   conceptions   of   how   green   and   open   spaces   are   provided   (City   of   Toronto   Parks   Plan   2013-2017).   Part   of   this   approach   considers   how   streets   could   play   a   similar   role   that   parks   do   in   targeted   areas.   Proposals   like   the   Entertainment   District   BIA's   John   Street   Corridor   envisions   sidewalk   widening,   streetscape   improvements   and   a   more   programmed   sidewalk   experience   where   one   can   linger   and   enjoy   the   public   realm   (see   Image   2,   p.34).   Examples  such  as  this  are  what  my  key  informant  refers  to  in  terms  of  opportunities   for   leveraging   public   attention   to   provide   a   case   for   new   approaches   for   the   sidewalks  and  streets  of  the  public  realm.

      However,   the   intent   of   this   discussion   is   not   to   focus   primarily   on   design   considerations,  but  rather  to  assess   how   the   public   realm   can   provide   a   high   quality   of   life   from   the   broader   perspective   of   walkability.   A   better   understanding   of   the   public   realm   is   required   to   make   informed   decisions   about   what   type   of   streetscape   improvements   make   the   most   sense   and   where   they   should   occur.   What   is   most   interesting   about   this   topic   is   that   while   so   many   area   plans,   studies   and   reports   focus  on  the  elements  of  the  physical  environment,  relatively  little  is  known  about   how  people  actually  use  the  public  realm  (Gehl  and  Svarre,  2013).  We  have  design   solutions,  as  in  the  John  Street  example,  and  we  have  a  sense  that  sidewalks  cannot   handle   pedestrian   flow,   but   what   is   missing   is   a   cohesive   understanding   of   the   qualitative  and  quantitative  story  of  how  people  interact  with  the  public  realm.      Research   by   Gilliard   (2012)   looking   at   Downtown   Toronto   is   instructive   on   this   point:  
The   City   of   Toronto   should   initiate   a   public   life   survey   of   the   downtown   to   establish   a   baseline  of  data  about  how  people  use  downtown  public  spaces.  This  data  can  provide  part   of   the   foundation   for   identifying   Toronto's   strengths   and   opportunities.   It   will   also   give   public   space   advocates   in   the   community   and   the   civic   bureaucracy   the   `language'   to   make   convincing  arguments  with  numeracy-minded  critics  (43).

Work  that  is  currently  underway  as  a  part  of  a  studio  team  project  9  responds  to  this   call.   Based   primarily   on   the   approaches   to   studying   public   life   set   out   by   Jan   Gehl,   the  next  section  discusses  how  to  fit  the  missing  piece  of  people  into  making  a  case   for  public  realm  improvement.   Putting  People  First  ­  A  Public  Realm  Assessment  Tool        At   the   heart   of   this   discussion   is   Jan   Gehl's   early   critique   of   modernist   planning.   Claiming   that   the   comprehensive,   large-scale   plans   of   the   mid   20th   century   had   indulged  the  artistic  visions  of  physical  design  at  the  expense  of  ignoring  people.  A   sense  of  how  and  why  people  behaved  the  way  they  did  in  public  space  was  lost  or   ignored.   Gehl's   antidote   to   this   problem   was   to   develop   new   tools   to   investigate   the   underlying   reasons   of   what   works   and   what   doesn't   (Gehl   &   Svarre,   p.60).   His   method  of  using  direct  observation  to  discern  how  people  use  a  space  tells  a  story   about   how   it   can   be   improved   by   a   building   a   rationale   and   a   direction   for   future   planning   interventions   (p.3-4).10  A   major   advantage   to   this   methodology   is   that   it   uses  a  quantitative  base  of  data  to  match  qualitative  observations.              The  tool  our  studio  team  has  developed  and  piloted  for  the  City  of  Toronto  attempts   to   tie   Gehl's   methodology   of   a   people-focussed   approach   together   with   an   assessment   of   the   existing   conditions   of   the   built   form.11  The   intent   is   to   draw   out   a   dialogue  around  the  quality  of  the  public  realm.  For  a  better  understanding  of  how   to  interpret  this  tool  in  detail,  please  refer  to  Appendix  1.  

The  Public  Realm  Assessment  Tool  and  Quality  of  Life  
The  public  realm  assessment  tool  (Public  Realm  Studio  Group,  2014)  gives  users  a   simple  and  easily  executed  method  of  collecting  data.  This  can  be  easily  applied  to   open   spaces,   corridors   and   transit   nodes.   The   following   is   an   example   of   how   the                                                                                                                    9  This  project  is  to  be  delivered  to  clients  at  the  City  of  Toronto,  and  was  undertaken  as  a  part  of  a   group.  Please  see  References  section  for  the  list  of  co-authors.   10  Direct  observation  (in  the  field)  uses  simple  and  accessible  means  of  data  collection  to  count,  map,   trace,  and  keep  detailed  journals  of  how  people  interact  with  public  space  (Gehl  &  Svarre).   11  The  assessment  tool  is  divided  into  3  focus  areas:  People  (observing  movement,  activities  and  
patterns),  Place  (an  inventory  of  existing  conditions)  and  Context  (a  larger  scale  look  at   connectivity,  destinations  and  landmarks).

data   might   be   used   to   identify   where   planning   interventions   can   improve   the   experience  of  walking  -  and  therefore  quality  of  life  for  Downtown  residents:  
1. Volume  of  Use  ­  Counting  pedestrians  over  a  given  time  period  and  measuring  this  against   environmental  factors  such  as  sidewalk  width,  pedestrian  scale  building  enclosure,  sun  and   shadow.  This  will  give  a  sense  of  the  existing  capacity  to  support  pedestrians  in  study  areas.   2. Transit   Stop   Performance  ­  Mapping  size  of  crowds  waiting  at  TTC  stops  and  comparing   against  accessibility  features  (gripping,  curb  cuts),  sidewalk  widths,  TTC  shelter  conditions   will  give  insight  as  to  how  to  better  direct  clustering  of  people  in  order  to  avoid  right-of-way   blockages  and  increase  safety.   3.   Measuring   Illegal   Crossings   ­   Mapping   locations   and   frequency   of   J-walking   compared   with  block  size,  building  widths  and  crossing  infrastructure.  This  will  give  a  sense  of  areas  in   need  of  improved  pedestrian  prioritization  to  improve  safety  and  ease  of  movement.   4. Role   of   Privately   Owned   Public   Spaces  ­  Mapping  and  assessing  how  pedestrians  might   use  these  spaces  -  as  thoroughfares  (mid-block  connections),  as  places  to  stay  and  linger,  or   not   using   them   at   all­   will   give   a   better   understanding   as   to   their   role   and   performance   in   the  public  realm  and  how  they  might  be  designed  and  treated  in  future  development.  

These  are  only  a  few  examples  of  the  potential  of  the  public  realm  assessment  tool   (Appendix  1)  to  better  understand  walkability  and  public  realm  performance.  This   tool  is  a  powerful  resource  for  planners  seeking  to  understand  the  human  element   of  Downtown  public  life,  while  attaching  a  numbers-based  rationale  that  increases   its  potential  to  leverage  investment  in  the  public  realm.        Given  the  concerns  raised  in  Section  1  around  small  living  spaces,  the  importance  of   the  public  realm  as  a  third  space  amplifies  its  importance  for  quality  of  life  outcomes   in  the  Downtown  ­  for  better  or  for  worse.  As  Gehl  and  Svarre  attest,  this  represents   an  accessible  way  to  understand  the  connection  between  space,  its  uses,  and  quality   of   life   for   people   (p.70).   As   the   top   three   reasons   for   living   Downtown   depend   so   heavily  on  the  public  realm  and  walkability  in  particular,  resources  of  this  kind  are   timely.  

Section  2  ­  Recommendation  
   The  sole  recommendation  of  this  section  is  to  prioritize  a  people-centred  approach   to  making  a  case  for  public  realm  improvements,  to  be  integrated  into  background   37  

  

studies   and   neighbourhood   profiles   undertaken   by   the   City   Planning   Division.   The   public  realm  assessment  tool  is  a  superior  option  and  methodology  for  doing  this,  as   it  is  cheaply  conducted  and  makes  for  a  compelling  `story'  as  it  combines  qualitative   impressions  with  quantitative  data

"We  have  reached  this  exciting  and  terrifying  tipping  point  where  we  are  starting  to  question   whether  it  could  be  there  is  something  called  too  much  density...There  are  some  areas  of  the   city   where   we   are   seeing   too   much   density  ­   hyperdensity   ­   and   there   are   other   areas   of   the   city  where  we  are  seeing  no  growth  at  all."     (Toronto  Chief  Planner  Jennifer  Keesmaat  in  Gee,  2013)  

   The   pace   of   growth   that   Downtown   Toronto   is   currently   experiencing   is   a   contentious   and   divisive   issue.   Since   the   OP   took   effect   in   2006,   82%   of   development  has  been  directed  to  Downtown  and  the  centres,  with  the  Downtown   absorbing   41%   residential   proposals   and   39%   of   non-residential   GFA   in   the   city   (City  of  Toronto,  2013).  Such  concentrated  development  at  such  a  massive  scale  has   seen   a   splintering   among   urbanists   and   residents.   While   many   stakeholders   agree   that  controlling  growth  and  investment  is  a  `good  problem  to  have',  tensions  arise  as   to  what  this  surge  in  population  and  development  will  mean  for  the  Downtown.     This   section   therefore   considers   the   planning   policy   framework,   its   ability   to   manage  growth  and  change,  and  the  implications  for  the  quality  of  life  of  residents.   Height  and  Density:  Too  much  of  a  good  thing?   As   illustrated   in   the   quote   at   the   beginning   of   the   chapter,   Toronto's   Chief   Planner   is   one   of   many   that   believe  the  Downtown  is  hitting  a  `tipping  point'  of  the   amount  of  density  that  an  area  is  able  to  sustain.  The   Growth   Plan   for   the   Golden   Horseshoe   sets   the   density   target   for   Downtown   at   400   people   and   jobs   per   hectare.   According   to   the   Minister   of   Transportation's   office,   in   2012,   Downtown   Toronto

process  to  infrastructure  carrying  capacity,  as  projects  are  approved  first  on  a  site- by-site   basis   without   being   tied   to   the   comprehensive   suite   of   required   infrastructure  investments  needed  to  serve  new  investments  (2013).        Some  commentators  call  for  planners  to  recognize  that  density  in  itself  is  not  a  goal   ­   it   is   a   metric.   Richard   Florida   and   Edward   McMahon   contend   that   while   density   is   essential  for  the  viability  of  cities,  it  has  tendencies  to  build  up  and  over  the  human   scale  (driven  by  height  precedents)  and  instead  breeds  isolating  environments  and   "vertical  sprawl"  (Florida,  2012).  In  Downtown  Toronto,  there  is  some  concern  with   large-scale   developments   encroaching   on   traditionally   low   or   mid-rise   neighbourhoods  (Lorinc,  2012).  Marohn  warns  that  planners  (and  developers)  treat   high-density   zoning   as   a   "blunt   instrument"   that   oversimplifies   the   relationship   between   density   and   good   quality,   context-based   planning   outcomes   (2013).   As   a   key   informant   attests,   density   is   only   a   component   of   a   suite   of   elements   (mix   of   housing,   public   realm,   community   services   and   facilities,   parks   and   open   spaces)   that  contribute  to  a  high  quality  of  life  (UrbanDesigner_1).      Others   argue   that   very   high   densities   part   of   the   solution,   not   the   problem.   Unlike   Chief   Planner   Jennifer   Keesmaat,   Chakrabarti   sees   hyper-density   (defined   as   30   housing  units  per  acre  ­  modest  by  Toronto  standards)  as  a  desirable  and  integral   ingredient   for   successful   cities.   He   dismisses   the   claim   that   high-rise,   hyper-dense   neighbourhoods  in  Toronto  will  turn  out  to  be  `urban  ghettos'  and  instead  counters   that   tall,   dense   development   facilitates   successful   mixed-use   modern   office   development   in   ways   that   low-rise   development   cannot   (2013,   p.132).   Further   to   this  point,  the  Globe  and  Mail  cites  that  92%  of  office  development  in  the  GTA  in  the   second   quarter   of   2013   occurred   in   Downtown   Toronto.   The   article   goes   on   to   suggest  that  in  light  of  job  market  gains  and  better  proximity  to  work,  infrastructure   needs  to  keep  up  with  the  growth,  as  opposed  to  pursuing  actions  that  stunt  future   growth  in  order  for  infrastructure  to  catch  up  (Gee).

As   divisive   as   height   and   density   can   be,   both   sides   of   the   debate   seem   to   agree   that   the  planning  tools  and  framework  in  Downtown  Toronto  are  inadequate  to  manage   growth   in   a   concerted   way.   Summarizing   his   reflections   on   the   unresponsive   and   out-dated  nature  of  zoning,  Chakrabarti  identifies  common  ground  in  his  suggestion   that  "good  planning  should  be  guided  by  desired  objectives  rather  than  prescribed   physical   outcomes"   and   advocates   for   a   more   flexible   and   performance   based   approach  (p.145).  How  can  this  be  done?  As  Michael  Short  (2012)     asked   ­   Is   there   a   way   to   incorporate   tall   buildings   and   a   range   of   other   high- density  forms  in  such  a  way  that  improves  the  communities  around  them?     Infrastructure  ­  The  Current  Context      Before   we   consider   how   the   current   planning   framework   speaks   to   height   and   density,  it  is  helpful  to  establish  a  baseline  of  where  Downtown  stands  in  terms  of  its   ability   to   support   future   growth.   The   following   table   is   not   intended   to   be   definitive   or  exhaustive,  but  rather  to  give  a  sense  of  where  Downtown  stands  currently.

Although   programming   capacity   exists,   there   is   a   pressing   need   for   more   physical   programming   space   (especially   in   aging   facilities  with  less  flexible  spaces)   58%   of   agencies   do   not   have   existing   capacity   to   take   on   new   users  or  clients.   80%   of   programs   will   not   have   the   space   or   resources   to   accommodate  new  users  over  the  next  5  years.

The   above   information   should   be   taken   together   with   the   idea   that   the   GTA   is   expected   to   grow   by   50%   its   population   by   2031(Toronto   Board   of   Trade,   2012).   Much   of   this   growth   will   be   targeted   to   growth   areas   such   as   the   Downtown.   As   infrastructure   capacity   stands   at   what   it   does   in   a   financially   constrained   environment,  this  raises  questions  of  what  growth  will  mean  for  the  quality  of  life  of   residents.   The   next   section   considers   how   the   current   policy   framework   manages   this  challenge.  

Section  3A:  The  Toronto  Policy  Framework  Context  
   In  theory,  planning  frameworks  guide  and  direct  the  scale  of  growth  in  such  a  way   that   it   is   ostensibly   tied   to   the   capacity   of   infrastructure,   taking   into   account   environmental   and   design   considerations.   The   following   is   an   overview   of   policies   pertaining   to   the   scale   of   growth   in   terms   of   height   and   density.      It   also   traces   an   evolution   of   policy   thinking   as   the   City   attempts   to   keep   pace   with   growth   and   change.     Official  Plan  (2006)      The   Official   Plan,   last   consolidated   in   2010,   is   a   document   intended   to   provide   guidance   to   how   the   City   grows,   but   takes   careful   steps   to   avoid   being   overly   prescriptive  in  its  policy  framework.  This  open,  normative  approach  to  crafting  the   OP   was   likely   a   reaction   to   the   rigid,   technocratic   practice   of   past   generations   of   planning   that   resisted   the   transitory   nature   of   cities.   As   a   CMHC   report   implies,   overly  prescriptive  approaches  to  master  planning  and  zoning  can  hold  back  natural   processes   of   growth   and   change   as   neighbourhoods   and   uses   must   be   allowed   to   continually   responding   to   complex   local   and   global   conditions   (1997).   The   King-    42  

Spadina   area   in   Downtown   Toronto   is   a   key   example   ­   until   its   land   use   was   updated  through  a  series  of  secondary  plans,  the  planning  framework  did  not  allow   the   area   to   move   beyond   its   historical   industrial-only   function,   thus   severely   constraining   its   ability   to   react   to   dynamic   new   opportunities   (Ibid.).   Bearing   in   mind  that  the  intent  of  the  OP  is  to  allow  for  flexibility  and  change  over  time,  we  will   examine  key  policies  related  to  height  and  density  contained  within.      Section   2.2.1,   Policy   4a   relates   to   the   scale   of   development,   by   specifying   that   intensification  should  occur  in  the  mixed-use  areas  (outlined  in  red  in  Fig.  1)  and  the   regeneration   areas   of   the   Downtown,   with   "sensitive   infill"   to   occur   in   the   Downtown   Neighbourhoods   and   Downtown   Apartment   Neighbourhoods   designations.

   The   red   mixed-use   and   brown   regeneration   areas   are   where   the   majority   of   growth   will   be   directed   in   the   Downtown,   which   will   be   made   to   support   residential,   commercial,   institutional   and   open   space.   Chapter   4.5   Mixed   Use   Areas   Policy   2      43  

raises   the   importance   of   transitioning   building   heights   from   areas   of   differing   character   and   intensity   in   qualitative   terms.   It   is   important   to   note   that   this   chapter   refers   to   the   Downtown   in   a   relatively   homogenous   way,   outlining   only   that   the   Downtown  will  accommodate  the  highest  buildings  at  the  greatest  intensity.      Direction  in  regards  to  height  and  density  is  set  out  Chapter  3  in  the  descriptive  text   (meaning   non-policy   items)   in   the   OP.      These   items   in   Section   3.1.2   under   Built   Form,  specify  that  height  and  density  should  follow  limits  set  out  in  Secondary  Plans   and  Site  Specific  Plans  (to  be  discussed)  and  where  none  exist,  developments  should   look  to  the  zoning  bylaw  for  a  benchmark  to  assess  height  and  density.    Under  the   same  section,  a  descriptive  section  (again,  non-policy)  sets  out  in  very  general  terms   the  need  for  adjacent  areas  of  differing  height  to  `transition'   into  each  other,  using   loosely  defined  angular  planes,  massing  orientation,  and  stepped  heights.      Interestingly,  Section  3.1.3  Built  Form-Tall  Buildings,  does  not  suggest  a  finer  grain   of   guidance   in   terms   of   height   and   density.   Descriptive   text   recognizes   that   tall   buildings  are  not  appropriate  in  all  areas,  and  are  most  suited  to  Downtown  and  the   Centres   within   the   mixed-use   and   regeneration   areas,   which,   as   we   have   seen   comprises   most   of   the   Downtown.   Further   urban   design   guidelines   are   suggested   pertaining   to   wind,   shadow,   pedestrian   scale   and   street   enclosure,   but   none   are   bound  by  quantitative  measures.        Section   3.2.2.   Community   Services   and   Facilities   provides   a   process   for   `soft   infrastructure',   recommending   in   Policy   5   that   "areas   experiencing   major   growth   and   change   will   be   informed   through   the   preparation   of   a   community   services   strategy".  In  this  case,  major  change  in  an  area  ­  of  which  tall  buildings  are  a  driving   force  in  the  context  of  the  Downtown  ­  triggers  a  process.  Table  5  is  a  part  of  this   process,  which  requires  the  city  to  initiate:

Policy  6  goes  on  to  require  this  process  be  undertaken  in  any  residential  or  mixed- use   development   over   5   hectares.   Taken   together,   we   have   a   planning   policy   mechanism   that   is   triggered   by   the   scale   of   development,   with   the   intention   that   services   must   be   assessed   and   a   plan   developed   in   order   to   accommodate   new   development.   This   triggering   mechanism   is   similar   to   the   parkland   dedication   outlined  in  Parks  and  Open  Spaces  3.2.3  Policy  5,  which  specifies  that  developments   over   a   scale   threshold   (dedications   required   per   300   units,   dependent   on   the   size   of   the  site)  must  contribute  land  or  cash-in-lieu.     Legislative  tools  raised  in  the  Official  Plan  ­  Managing  Growth  and  Change   Given   that   developments   of   significant   scale   trigger   processes   for   community   services   and   facilities   as   well   as   formula-based   processes   for   parkland   dedication,   we  look  to  what  triggers  the  OP  lays  out  for  hard  infrastructure  capacity  provision.   On  the  surface,  it  would  seem  that  no  trigger  exists  for  hard  infrastructure.  Chapter   5  ­  Managing  Growth  and  Change,  can  partially  explain  this.      While   not   triggered   by   developments   of   significant   scale   exclusively,   the   Development   Charges   By-law   (laid   out   by   the   Development  Charges  Act)   requires   all   new   developments   to   pay   one-time   charges   to   meet   growth-related   capital   infrastructure  requirements  (transit,  water,  roads  and  upgrades).  The  intent  is  that   growth  should  pay  for  growth  (Slack,  2002).  However,  a  consultants'  report  to  the   City   found   that   development   charges   are   covering   well   under   70%   of   the   infrastructure  costs  required  to  keep  pace  with  growth  in  the  Downtown  (Moloney,   2012).  Ideally,  development  charges  in  Toronto  are  designed  to  respond  to  growth   via   a   city-wide   bylaw   review   that   occurs   every   5   years   or   sooner.   But,   in   order   to   respond   to   growth   related   infrastructure   pressure   in   high-growth   areas,   development   charges   would   have   to   be   changed   on   a   city-wide   basis.   This   proves   to   be   a   politically   challenging   situation,   as   it   would   be   difficult   to   make   the   case   for   across   the   board   increases   to   meet   the   needs   of   geographical   minority   of   high-

growth  areas.  The  use  of  development  charge  by-law  reviews  to  respond  to  growth   related   need   is   also   frustrated   by   the   fact   that   any   development   charge   increase   tends   to   pass   a   portion   of   the   burden   to   the   public   via   increased   housing   prices   (Amborski,   2011).   Although   it   is   important   to   keep   development   charges   up   to   date   to  reflect  rising  costs,  their  agency  to  keep  up  with  growth  is  constrained.      Another  way  that  the  OP  Chapter  5  recommends  to  manage  growth  is  through  use  of   Section  37  of  the  Planning  Act,  which  allows  for  a  range  of  community  benefits  to  be   provided  by  the  developer  in  exchange  for  additional  height  and  density  above  that   permitted   in   the   Zoning   By-law.   While   this   approach   of   going   beyond   as-of-right   zoning   regulations   does   trigger   a   process,   it   is   important   to   note   that   community   benefits  can  comprise  a  broad  range  of  potential  contributions,  including,  but  in  no   way   limited   to   capital   infrastructure   (Section   5.1.1.   Policy   6).   These   benefits   are   currently   negotiated   by   councillors,   city   staff   and   developers,   adding   further   complexity   to   the   process   and   reducing   the   likelihood   that   contributions   flow   to   where   they   are   most   needed   as   opposed   to   what   is   politically   opportunistic.   Although  S.37  does  trigger  a  process,  it  is  not  shaped  in  the  comprehensive  way  that   a  community  services  and  facilities  study  is,  which  lessens  its  potential  from  a  policy   standpoint.

Further,  as  a  recent  critique  of  Section  37  aptly  points  out  (see  Fig.2),  most  of  these   increases   in   density   are   occurring   in   wards   experiencing   the   most   growth-related   pressure   ­   Downtown   wards   20,   27   and   28.   The   report   goes   on   to   say   that   the   benefits  provided  are  scattershot,  as  no  one  type  of  benefit  accounts  for  more  than   50%   of   the   benefits   in   any   ward   (IMFG,   2013,   p.5).   From   this,   it   is   evident   that   Section  37  does  not  function  as  a  trigger  to  keep  up  with  or  manage  growth,  as  it  is   applied  to  a  broad  range  of  politically  determined  benefits  ­  many  with  a  preference   for   "desirable   visual   amenities"   ­   that   are   not   bound   to   core   growth   related   need   (ibid).      Overall,  the  OP  provides  sparse  guidance  in  quantitative  terms  for  developments  of   significant   height   and   density.   Although   it   specifies   where   growth   is   to   occur   (in   the   mixed   use   and   regeneration   areas),   there   are   no   metrics   given   or   specific   conversation  around  how  much  density  is  too  much.  Specific  benchmarks  are  only   suggested   in   the   context   of   the   Zoning   By-law,   which   is   frequently   overridden   in   favour  of  Section  37  agreements.  Furthermore,  areas  designated  for  growth  (again,   the   mixed   use   and   regeneration   areas)   cover   most   of   the   Downtown   are   as   such,

incredibly  broad.  This  does  not  represent  a  fine  enough  grain  of  policy  guidance  to   reflect   the   incredible   variation   of   building   typologies   and   magnitudes   of   density   within   the   mixed-use   areas. 12   As   scrutiny   builds   on   this   point,   the   City   has   responded   by   commissioning   a   consultants'   report   intended   to   address   the   need   for   greater  specificity  in  the  mixed-use  land  designations,  which  is  discussed  in  the  next   section.   Downtown  Tall  Buildings:  Vision  and  Supplementary  Design  Guidelines  (2012)      In  the  introduction  to  this  set  of  guidelines,  the  City  of  Toronto  recognizes  that  rapid   growth  is  testing  the  limits  of  the  planning  framework.    
While   the   City's   Official   Plan   has   provided   direction   on   the   intensity   and   nature   of   this   growth   outside   the   Downtown   and   in   areas   of   the   Downtown   subject   to   Secondary   Plans,   Official  Plan  policies  have  not  provided  a  vision  and  a  framework  within  which  to    address   the  specific  issue  of  appropriate  locations  for  the  redeployment  of  height  within  these  other   areas  of  the  Downtown  (p.  1-2).     

The   guidelines   set   out   an   evaluation   tool   that   suggests   the   conditions   for   compatibility   with   the   surrounding   context.   Its   main   features   are   to   suggest   sub- categories   for   the   Downtown   mixed-use   areas,   which   are   called   High   Streets   and   Secondary   High   Streets.      Within   these   areas,   the   guidelines   then   go   on   to   suggest   `height  ranges'  appropriate  to  each  area,  which  include:  
· · · · · A  137m  (45  storey)  to  unlimited  height,  outlined  in  the  Financial  District;   107-182M  (35-60  storeys)  in  King-Spadina  and  other  small  parcels;   92-152M  (30-50  storeys)  on  a  section  west  of  Yonge  and  North  of  Haggerman  St.   77-137M  (25-45  storeys)  along  most  of  University  ave;  and   Several  other  lower  ranges  for  parcels  of  Church,  Dundas  and  other  streets.  

The  height  ranges  represent  a  significant  addition  on  the  policies  of  the  OP,  as  they   set  out   quantifiable   measures   for  what  is  appropriate  in  terms  of  height  and   built- form  typology.  The  document  also  uses  stronger  language  than  the  OP  for  heritage   and   impacts   to   parks   and   open   space.   Notably,   emphasis   is   on   design   and                                                                                                                    12  Although  the  OP  does  have  a  5-year  review  process  (earlier  if  necessary)  to  assess  how  its  

implementation  tools  are  functioning,  this  review  process  must  be  comprehensive,  making  the   review  costly.  Given  the  pace  of  growth  and  change  in  the  Downtown,  it  can  be  argued  that  the  OP   review  process  is  not  agile  enough  to  respond  to  emerging  issues  in  a  timely  and  cost-effective  way.

environmental   impacts   and   includes   no   discussion   around   the   capacity   to   accommodate  growth.      It  is  equally  important  to  note  that  this  policy  tool  is  intended  as  a  guideline,  and  is   careful  not  to  stifle  architectural  or  design  innovation.  As  it  is  a  set  of  guidelines,  this   document   does   not   statutory   weight   behind   it.   While   the   height   ranges   are   not   binding,  they  attempt  to  provide  "a  finer  grain  of  detail  to  more  effectively  guide  the   review  and  approval  of  Downtown  tall  building  applications"  (p.5).   Secondary  Plans  and  Site  and  Area  Specific  Policies  ­  North  Downtown  Yonge  Site  and   Area  Specific  Policy  (2013)  example      While  Downtown  is  host  to  seven  secondary  plans  and  many  site  and  area  specific

plans,   the   recent   North   Downtown   Yonge   Site   and   Area   Specific   Policy   (2013)   exemplifies   the   evolving   approach   of   the   City   of   Toronto   to   regulating   height   and   density.   This   plan   pertains   to   a   "special   character   area"   meaning   one   of   architectural   and   historical   significance.   In   this   case,   Yonge   St.   is   considered   historically   to   be   Toronto's   iconic   main  street.        As   the   policy   relates   to   a   special   character   area   (and   several   sub- areas),   it   is   much   more   prescriptive  

in  its  scope  than  other  general  policies,  recognizing  the  particular  challenges  posed   by   growth   to   existing   lower-scale   built   form.   Very   large   scale   residential   development  occurring  along  key  transit  nodes  (as  directed  in  the  OP)  is  beginning

to  move  further  into  the  fabric  of  the  neighbourhood,  prompting  a  more  rigid  set  of   policies  than  seen  elsewhere  in  the  Downtown,  including:  
· Core   Height   Area:   In   the   range   of   8M   or   4   storeys   (with   a   consistent   4   storey   wall   along   Yonge)  (Policy  5.3.1).  Additional  height  will  only  be  considered  if  no  part  of  the  proposal  falls   into  a  45  degree  angular  plane  and  meets  detailed  heritage-sensitive  criteria  (Policy  5.3.9)   The  Height  Transition  Area:  In  the  range  of  170M  or  45  storeys  (Policy  5.3.8)   · · The  Height  Peak  Area:  in  the  range  of  190M  or  55  storeys  (Policy  5.8)   Tall   buildings   are   "generally   not   appropriate"   but   will   be   given   consideration   in   context   so   long  as  the  tower  portion  of  the  proposal  adheres  to  a  minimum  setback  of  10  or  20  metres   from  the  street  ­  depending  on  the  heritage  aspects  in  the  area  (Policy  5.3.6)   · Includes  detailed  aspects  of  shadow  impacts,  height  transition  into  surrounding  lower-scale   neighbourhoods  and  sensitivity  to  heritage.  

It   is   interesting   to   note   that   the   height   transition   area   stipulates   height   in   the   maximum  range  brackets  set  out  by  the  Downtown  Tall  Buildings  guidelines.    This   follows   good   planning   principles   in   terms   of   encouraging   the   greatest   intensity   around   transit   nodes   (e.g.   College   Subway   station),   but   `transition'   is   quite   dramatic   from   recommended   4   storeys   in   the   core   height   area   to   45   storeys   in   the   peak   area.     It   must   be   noted   that   the   surrounding   area   is   very   much   built   out,   which   likely   informed  this  transition  recommendation.     Overall,   this   approach   gives   planners,   developers   and   the   public   a   much   more   specific   sense   of   a   finer   grain   of   what   built   form   to   expect   in   the   area.      Even   for   a   special   character   area,   it   leaves   room   for   design   innovation   for   taller   buildings,   so   long  as  they  adhere  to  more  strict  design  guidelines  around  transition,  angular  plane   and  respect  to  heritage  buildings  and  landscapes.  In  terms  of  height,  this  plan  does   increase  the  planning  guidance  from  guidelines  (such  as  Downtown  Tall  Buildings)   up   being   enshrined   in   policy.   Still,   there   is   no   policy   `trigger'   that   sets   off   infrastructure   assessments.   Tellingly,   density   is   not   mentioned   in   the   policy   in   the   pointing   to   the   intent   of   the   policy   as   having   a   focus   on   character,   heritage   and   environmental   impacts.   Why   then,   not   include   density   and   its   relationship   to   capacity  in  these  guiding  documents?

Toronto's  Planning  Framework  ­  A  Site-by-Site  Approach     In   the   absence   of   a   deliberately   prescriptive   planning   framework,   planning   in   the   Downtown   must   therefore   rely   heavily   on   subjective   interpretations   of   general   guidance  laid  out  in  the  OP.    At  a  Downtown  public  meeting,  stakeholders  suggested   that   general   qualitative   guidance   from   the   OP   does   not   give   planners,   citizens   and   neighbourhood   organizations   enough   `ammo'   to   provide   a   solid   rationale   at   the   OMB   (King-Spadina   Built-form   Study,   2013).   The   only   quantitative   bounds   on   planning  in  Toronto  are  laid  out  in  a  zoning  by-law  that  is  routinely  dismissed  as  out   of   date   at   the   OMB   (Blackett,   2010)   and   secondary   plans   that   also   do   not   reflect   the   reality  of  current  development.        From  a  theoretical  standpoint,  Toronto's  Site-by-Site  approach  is  reactionary.  Staff   have   come   to   expect   that   applications   will   seek   to   build   above   as-of-right,   which   places  the  City  on  the  defensive  (Planner_1).  To  many  residents,  this  makes  planning   seem   arbitrary,   with   the   results   of   development   approvals   bearing   little   resemblance  to  the  perceived  rules  laid  in  the  ZBL  (Reid,  2014).  Most  importantly,   this  approach  represents  an  incrementalist  view  of  planning,  working  through  each   individual   application   in   hopes   of   doing   the   best   that   can   be   done   given   development   pressures   and   the   planning   tools   available   (Forrester,   1984).   This   lack   of   policy   guidance   to   put   the   intentions   of   the   OP   into   practice   have   resulted   in   a   `spot  zoning'  approach,  where  city  building  is  considered  on  the  basis  of  individual   applications   as   opposed   to   a   vision,   a   local   context   and   an   informed   idea   of   cumulative  impacts  on  quality  of  life.      

Section  3B:  Alternatives  to  Site-by-Site  Planning  ­  Development  Permits  System  
   In   January,   2007   The   government   of   Ontario   set   out   a   regulation   in   the   Planning  Act   that   allowed   municipalities   to   make   use   of   the   Development   Permit   System   (DPS),   an   alternative   planning   regulatory   mechanism   that   Chief   Planner   Jennifer   Keesmaat   would   later   call   a   "fundamental   shift"   (Pill,   2014).   Interestingly,   in   the   first   four   years  of  its  introduction,  only  three  municipalities  in  the  province  took  up  the  DPS.   Then,   in   early   December,   2013,   the   City   of   Toronto   introduced   a   Official   Plan      51  

Amendment   with   the   intention   of   implementing   the   system.      The   timing   of   this   in   December,  coupled  with  a  lack  of  public  consultation  before  the  OPA  was  proposed   to   the   Planning   and   Growth   Management   Committee,   raised   the   ire   of   resident   groups  (Ibid).      The  DPS  is  a  proposed  as  a  vision-based,  neighbourhood  approach  to  planning  that   will   streamline   the   development   process   by   front-ending   flexible   planning   requirements  on  an  area-by-area  basis  (Ibid).  In  other  words,  neighbourhoods  will   be  consulted  to  shape  a  comprehensive  plan  under  a   single  By-law  for  their  area  if   they   so   choose   (DPS   is   optional   ­   in   absence   of   an   DPS   area   plan,   current   in-force   planning  rules  apply  as  they  do  now),  and  any  development  applications  afterward   must   adhere   to   the   DPS   area   plan.      In   exchange   for   this   more   prescriptive   approach,   a  streamlined  approvals  process  will  be  offered,  combining  minor  variance,  zoning   site   plan   and   Section   37-style   agreements   into   a   single   application,   thus   reducing   the  approvals  process  from  the  current  120-180  days  to  a  proposed  45  days  (City  of   Toronto,  Nov.6,  2013).      The   logic   behind   the   DPS   is   that   it   outlines   an   area-based   planning   approach   that   considers  planning  on  the  scale  of  neighbourhoods,  while  it  provides  more  certainty   of  outcome  and  considers  planning  in  a  broader,  more  cumulative  way.  In  sum,  the   DPS  is  designed  to  address  the  shortcomings  of  site-by-site  `spot  zoning'  discussed   earlier,  as  applications  are  considered  in  the  context  of  an  area,  not  as  a  stand-alone   application.      Central   to   this   approach   is   the   ideas   that   it   allows   for   a   more   predictable  and  comprehensive  way  to  plan  for  infrastructure,  as  the  full  build  out   for   the   area   is   established   (flexibly)   when   the   DPS   area   plan   comes   into   force.         A   City  Staff  Report  describes  it  as  a  cross  between  a  secondary  plan  and  a  zoning  By- law  (Ibid).      Branded  Reset  TO,  by  the  City  Planning  Division,  the  process  works  like  this:  
1. Stakeholders   (councillors,   City   staff,   members   of   the   public,   development   community)   front- end   the   consultation   through   meetings   where   an   area-based   plan   is   shaped.   The   process

begins  with  a  background  study,  which  could  include  an  assessment  of  existing  and  needed   facilities   and   infrastructure.   Next,   a   detailed   land-use   vision   is   formed,   which   would   also   measure   the   capacity   for   growth   against   hard   and   soft   infrastructure   capacity.      Design   details,   heritage   and   character   stipulations   may   also   be   included   as   they   are   in   any   area- specific  plans.   2. Once  approved,  the  area-based  plan  would  translate  into  a  set  of   development   standards   and   criteria   that   would   work   similar   to   a   zoning   bylaw   (which   would   be   repealed   in   any   DPS   area   plan).      A   key   difference   is   that   height   limits   and   other   standards   would   be   expressed  in  ranges.    All  zoning,  minor  variance  and  site  plan  would  be   consolidated   into   single   area   based   by-law,   which   in   turn   would   require   a   single   development   application   (and  faster  approvals)   3. Development  applications  must  meet  the  standards  and  criteria  set  out  in  the  DPS  area  by- law  to  receive  a  permit.  While  Reset  TO  materials  indicate  a  45-day   review   period,  staff  and   community   feedback   suggest   this   timeframe   is   overly   optimistic   given   the   complexity   of   proposals  of  significant  height  and  density.     4. Only  the  applicant  (developer)  has  appeal  rights   on   approval   to   the   OMB.      The   rationale   here  is  that  community  priorities  are  expressed  up-front  in  the  development  of  the  DPS  area   plan,  and  therefore  do  not  require  an  appeal  mechanism.    Third  parties  (councillors,  resident   groups,  civil  society)  would  not  have  rights  to  appeal.  However,  A  key  feature  of  the  DPS  is   that   appeals   would   apply   to   the   entire   area   by-law  (not  the  site),  while  would  trigger  a   review   process   of   the   area   by-law   including   new   background   studies,   revised   standards   and  criteria,  and  community  consultations  processes.   5. 6. Under   the   DPS   by-law,   OMB   decisions   are   limited   to   the   same   powers   that   council   holds,   meaning  that  the  OMB  cannot  approve  developments  above  by-law  height  regulations.   Community  benefits  similar  to  Section  37  would  be  built  in  to  height  ranges,  requiring   their   provision   within   the   existing   as-of-right   height   standards   set   out   in   the   by-law.   Applications   for   the   higher   allowable   height   range   would   provide   benefits,   whereas   for   lower   allowable   ranges   they   may   not   be   required.   These   benefits   would   be   required   to   achieve   a   "proportional   relationship   between   the   quantity   or   monetary   value   of   the   facilities   and   the   height   or   density   that   may   be   approved",   using   a   formula-based   approach   that   does   not   exist   in   current   S.37   agreements.   Benefits   would   also   be   prioritized   up-front   in   background  studies  described  in  step  1.   7. The  DPS  would  be  reviewed  over  an  unspecified  timeframe  ­  originally  set  as  5  years,  but  is   currently  being  reconsidered  by  staff.   (City  of  Toronto,  Staff  Report,  November  6,  2013,  p.  4-10;  Reset  TO  Community  Meeting,  March   22,  2014;  inserted  commentary  author's  own.)

The   overarching   idea   here   is   to   create   a   system   with   a   more   consistent   and   coordinated   approach   to   planning   that   considers   development   applications   in   the   context  of  an  area  and  its  needs  and  existing  capacity.     Development  Permits  System:  Reset  TO  Community  Meeting  Highlights.   The  March  22,  2014  Reset  TO  meeting  saw  city  staff  lead  an  information  session  and   field   questions.   Community   feedback   and   discussion   with   planners   raised   the   following  general  issues  around  DPS  implementation:  
·    ·    ·    ·    ·    Community  members  had  enduring  questions  around  removal  of  appeal  rights  and  concerns   around  the  additional  powers  given  to  planners  under  the  DPS   Debate  around  cost  issues  of  the  DPS  process  were  raised  ­  although  it  was  argued  that  more   up   front   costs   required   by   the   DPS   would   cut   costs   overall   as   compared   to   the   current   system  of  meetings  on  every  application   The   question   of   whether   height   limits   in   the   development   standards   would   be   decided   by   precedent  or  by  neighbourhood  priority  was  a  common  concern  that  planners  did  not  have   an  answer  for.   Given  the  significant  resources  needed  for  the  process,  staff  estimated  that  only  2-3  DPS  area   by-laws  per  year  could  be  implemented.   How   DPS   areas   will   be   defined   and   what   types   of   areas   they   are   best   suited   for   has   yet   to   be   decided.  Some  personal  suggestions  from  staff  included  employing  DPS  in  high  growth  areas,   but  there  is  currently  no  consensus  on  this.  

Overall,   the   response   at   the   meeting   changed   as   more   information   came   to   light.   Many   representatives   of   residents'   associations   seemed   to   shift   from   confrontational   tones   to   cautious   optimism.   Initially   concerned   around   issues   of   removal  of  appeal  rights,  many  participants  seemed  to  express  support  for  the  DPS   by   the   end   of   the   meeting   as   it   became   clear   that   the   OMB   could   not   approve   anything   above   height   limits.   On   this   point,   reception   from   unofficial   representatives   of   the   development   community   were   mixed.   Although   there   was   clear   support   for   the   expedited   and   simplified   approvals   process   laid   out   in   the   DPS13,  it  was  suggested  the  idea  would  be  unpopular  with  the  general  public  due  to

the   removal   of   appeal   rights.   Again,   there   was   a   tangible   lack   of   trust   in   the   expanded  powers  of  planning  staff  laid  out  in  a  DPS.      Architects   and   design   professionals   present   also   indicated   support.   This   positive   feedback   flowed   from   the   assurance   that   design   review   panels   and   building   performance   standards   could   be   included   as   requirements   in   the   development   criteria  for  DPS  by-laws.        An   overarching   challenge   seemed   to   revolve   around   logistics.   As   questions   from   the   public   rightly   pointed   out   the   slow   process   of   initiating   and   updating   secondary   plans,   they   feared   DPS   implementation   would   not   be   fast   enough   to   address   growth   challenges  in  the  present.  City  staff  suggested  that  it  was  feasible  to  implement  2-3   DPS  area  by-laws  on  an  annual  basis,  which  was  a  source  of  frustration  for  many.   Development  Permits  System  ­  Advantages   The  potential  advantages  to  this  are  multitude  for  quality  of  life  of  residents.  First,  in   an   ideal   playing   out   of   a   DPS,   stakeholders   have   the   advantage   of   taking   the   long   view   of   building   design,   environmental   impacts,   area   massing,   and   land-use,   allowing  people  to  effectively  shape  their  neighbourhood  in  a  proactive  as  opposed   to   reactive   way.   As   the   staff   report   points   out,   this   helps   eliminate   the   `surprise'   element   of   growth,   as   an   DPS   area   plan   would   allow   stakeholders   to   visualize,   prioritize   and   express   priorities   for   the   neighbourhood   as   a   whole,   thus   eliminating   fatigue   (and   reducing   cost)   of   holding   consultations   for   every   new   development   (p.4).        Second,  this  process  eliminates  the  need  to  deal  with  outdated  zoning  by-laws  and   improves  on  the  existing  processes  to  provide  community  benefits.  Any  applications   seeking  to  build  beyond  as-of-right  would  require  a  comprehensive  review  process   including   consultations   (see   step   4   above),   which   to   City   staff   represents   a   much   more   onerous   and   rigorous   test   than   the   current   Section   37   does   (Reset   TO   Community   Meeting).   In   this,   the   DPS   sets   out   a   `hard   cap'   on   height   and   density,

representing   shifts   toward   more   stringent   and   clear   expectations   of   what   constitutes  appropriate  development.      Further   to   this,   the   current   system   provides   community   benefits   on   an   ad-hoc   basis   (via  Section  37  negotiations)  on  approved  projects  that  exceed  a  zoning  framework   that   does   not   reflect   realistic   expectations   of   development   in   the   Downtown.   Evidence   suggests   that   negotiated   Section   37   benefits   rarely   provide   hard   infrastructure  needed  to  support  density  (IMFG,  p.6).  In  contrast,  the  DPS  identifies   and   prioritizes   appropriate   benefits   beforehand,   based   on   needs   identified   in   a   background   study.   This   has   potential   for   infrastructure   to   be   clearly   coordinated   with  growth  in  facilities  of  core  need  in  a  more  targeted  and  predictable  way.          In   addition,   each   DPS   area   would   set   out   a   proportional   relationship   of   additional   height   and   density   to   community   benefits   received.14     Ideally,   this   would   set   into   policy   the   idea   that   every   neighbourhood   has   a   different   capacity   for   taking   on   additional   height   and   density.   At   the   very   least,   the   language   describing   the   OPA   explicitly  mentions  density  and  the  issue  of  legislating  mechanisms  to  keep  up  with   growth,   which   is   a   progressive   and   long   overdue   step   according   to   many   (Gee;   Lorinc;  Chakrabarti).        Development  Permits  System  ­  A  Shift  in  Instrumental  Power   Finally,   any   the   DPS   works   to   limit   the   short-sightedness   of   ward   politics   in   the   development   process.   While   the   current   system   of   ward   councillor   negotiated   development   approvals   can   have   advantages   in   its   flexibility   and   ability   to   leverage,   political   interests   and   lack   of   legislative   guidance   dilute   its   ability   to   respond   to   needs   in   coordinated   way   that   flows   from   the   interests   of   community   members   (Costello  &  Longo,  2013).  In  this  way,  it  can  be  argued  that  the  DPS  is  progressive  in   that  it  ideally  gives  more  weight  to  ideas  of  what  the  area  should  look  like  in  the  long                                                                                                                    14  The  Section  37-like  process  in  the  DPS  is  a  move  toward  a  formula-based  calculation  of  benefits   (as  seen  in  Vancouver),  as  opposed  to  the  current  negotiation-based  system.      56  

term  by  taking  steps  limit  the  unpredictable  and  volatile  nature  of  political  priorities   and  election  cycles.      In  urban  planning,  the  weakening  of  executive  power  of  politicians  means  gains  in   power   elsewhere,   and   the   DPS   is   no   exception.15  Though   elected   officials   will   be   heavily   involved   in   the   shaping   of   the   DPS   area   plan,   once   it   is   in   force,   all   third   parties   will   not   have   appeal   rights.   This   means   that   any   contentious   applications   will   be   dealt   with   by   planning   staff,   representing   a   significant   shift   in   planning   power.   Further,   under   the   DPS,   council   now   has   the   option   to   delegate   approval   authority  to  a  committee  or  city  employee  ­  which  the  OPA  recommends  to  be  the   Chief   Planner   (City   of   Toronto,   Nov.6,   2013).   As   planners   gain   more   discretionary   power  while  councillor  and  OMB  influence  on  individual  applications  is  much  more   limited,  there  is  a  fear  that  staff  may  make  overly  technical  and  `rational'  decisions   that  are  not  representative  of  plans  set  out  by  the  community,  or  make  become  too   enmeshed   with   developer   interests   (Sewell,   1995).   This   concern   is   somewhat   assuaged   by   the   need   for   council   approval,   yet   under   the   DPS   council   can   also   delegate  approval  to  city  staff.  This  shift  of  power  towards  staff  and  away  from  third   parties   only   begins   with   councillors   and   the   OMB   ­   the   main   challenge   that   this   fundamental   systemic   change   in   planning   will   need   to   address   is   the   role   of   the   public.   Development  Permits  System  -  Major  Critiques   Reviewing   initial   messaging   rolled   out   City   of   Toronto   (OPA,   slide   deck   and   consultation   handouts)   the   material   fails   to   squarely   address   the   elephant   in   the   room   ­   the   removal   of   appeal   rights   for   third   parties.   The   slide   presentation   gives   scant   attention   to   the   issue   ­   it   is   mentioned   once,   and   does   not   have   its   own   explanatory  slide  ­  and  the  OPA  commits  a  surprisingly  small  amount  of  discussion   to  it.  However,  at  the  Reset  TO  public  meeting  it  was  made  clear  during  a  question                                                                                                                    15  Forester  (1989)  argues  that  the  natural  source  of  planning  power  comes  from  control  of  

information.  As  city  staff  would  control  information  on  proposals  and  have  increased  discretionary   power,  critics  could  make  the  case  that  under  the  DPS,  planners  gain  power  for  themselves  as   opposed  to  empowering  citizens.

period   that   the   OMB   would   not   be   able   to   approve   above   height   limits   ­   a   key   feature  that  has  not  been  clearly  communicated  so  far.        Regardless   of   the   stronger   height   caps,   lack   of   third   part   appeals   presents   problems   on   several   levels.   On   a   general   level,   the   public   has   the   expectation   that   it   should   have  a  voice  on  significant  developments,  and  appreciates  an  appeal  mechanism  if  it   feels   that   good   planning   principles   have   not   be   adhered   to   (Nethery,   2011,   p.   13).   Next,   there   is   the   fear   that   once  implemented,   the   DPS   by-laws   will   not   be   flexible   enough   to   respond   to   changing   community   interests.   Although   City   staff   can   initiate   a  by-law  review  process  if  they  feel  that  goals  and  objectives  have  changed,  critics   could  warn  against  the  increased  discretionary  power  in  the  hands  of  planners  and   experts.      Another   point   of   contention   looks   to   the   structure   and   breadth   of   consultation.     Initially,   only   two   meetings   were   proposed   to   deliberate   over   the   complexities   of   massing,   public   realm,   height-ranges,   design,   character,   heritage,   and   begin   discussions   around   community   benefits,   services   and   infrastructure   requirements   (City   of   Toronto,   November   6,   2013).   The   City   has   since   clarified   that   the   process   would  involve  more  than  two  meetings.  However  to  expect  these  complex  issues  to   be   given   adequate   information   and   deliberation   in   a   series   of   public   meetings   is   a   concerning  logistical  challenge.  Further,  as  theorists  like  Fainstein  and  Healy  remind   us,  people  do  not  have  fixed  interests  ­  they  change  their  minds  according  complex   motivations  (Fainstein,  2000,  p.457).  The  removal  of  an  ongoing  appeal  right  could   incite   discontent   over   a   perceived   lack   of   ongoing   input.   Also,   given   the   threat   of   extremely  high  mobility  among  Downtown  demographics,  there  is  no  guarantee  that   the   communities   who   shape   DPS   priorities   will   be   around   to   feel   their   impacts   at   work.        Another   potential   concern   is   related   to   NIMBY,   in   that   citizens   may   seek   to   deliberately   "down   zone"   the   height   ranges   on   local   DPS   area   plans   in   order   to

discourage  development,  no  matter  how  appropriate.16  Demonstrated  in  a  study  of   massive  rezoning  initiatives  in  New  York  City,  areas  that  were  successful  in  exerting   public  pressure  to  down-zone  were  predominantly  white,  with  higher  incomes  and   higher  rates  of  homeownership  as  compared  with  up-zoned  areas  (Laskow,  2014).     How  areas  are  selected  for  DPS  by-laws  and  on  what  basis  is  not  yet  known,  but  will   surely  have  implications  for  NIMBY  and  gentrification.     The  Development  Permits  System  and  Quality  of  Life      As   an   alternative   planning   tool,   the   Development   Permits   System   represents   a   significant   opportunity   to   improve   quality   of   life   for   people   living   in   high-density   communities  in  the  Downtown.  It  does  so  through  the  following:   1. Places   greater   importance   on   vision   for   neighbourhoods   as   a   whole   and   ideally  enables  citizens  to  play  a  central  role  shaping  this  vision.   2. Better   potential   to   safeguard   community   interests   through   more   stringent   processes  to  build  above  as-of-right.  Represents  a  stronger  policy  mechanism   to  protect  local  character  and  distinctiveness.   3. Ties   data   on   existing   conditions   and   community   priorities   to   the   ability   to   accommodate  growth  and  change  from  an  infrastructure  perspective.   4. Development  criteria  must  be  met  in  order  for  a  permit  to  be  issued,  allowing   DPS  to  orchestrate  identified  quality  of  life  objectives  in  future  development.      On  the  first  point,  the  DPS  represents  a  classic  shift  in  the  theoretical  underpinnings   of  urban  planning.  The  current  site-by-site  zoning  system  is  aligned  with  Lindblom's   idea  of  the  planner  as  incrementalist.  Currently,  the  system  of  approvals  exhibits  a   limited  and  tenuous  understanding  of  capacity  and  broader  contextual  impacts  ­  so   we  `make  do'  with  the  information  we  have.  Given  that  the  information  available  is   limited,  planners  must  work  within  a  `bounded  rationality'  to  negotiate  the  best  we                                                                                                                    16  It  could  be  argued  that  the  overall  intent  of  a  DPS  is  to  set  new  rules  on  development  that  must  be  
respected.  Part  of  this  would  be  to  presumably  to  `up-zone'  many  areas  to  reflect  current  conditions   and  to  simultaneously  set  limits  on  it.  However,  neighbourhoods  may  attempt  to  `freeze'  their  areas   at  the  lowest  densities  possible  in  order  to  limit  any  perceived  impacts  on  them.  This  would  go   against  the  intention  of  the  DPS  to  modernize,  update  and  reset  the  planning  framework.

can   to   serve   and   support   new   growth   through   processes   like   Section   37   (see   Forrester,  1984,  p.24).    The  DPS  enables  the  Downtown  to  move  forward  from  this   by  shaping  our  longer-term  outcomes  in  a  more  proactive  way  through  area  studies.   This  information  and  consultation  based  approach  will  enable  communities  to  rely   less  on  `satisficing'  and  more  on  planning  approaches  that  are  more  expressly  linked   to   data   and   infrastructure   priorities.   Clearly   articulated   neighbourhood   visions   allow   for   people   to   better   understand   the   big   picture   of   development   and   how   it   should  satisfy  the  priorities  and  challenges  of  their  communities,  and  the  DPS  makes   clear  strides  toward  this.        On  the  second  point,  the  fact  that  OMB  cannot  approve  height  and  density  above  the   height   ranges   set   out   in   the   conditions   of   a   DPS   by-law   has   the   potential   to   better   link  community  priorities  with  longer-term  built  form  outcomes.  This  goes  back  to   Brooks'   idea   of   local   communities   standing   for   a   `third   system'   of   power,   along   with   government   and   the   market   (Brooks,   2002).   Under   the   DPS,   this   third   system's   (the   community)   claim   to   power   is   strengthened   in   that   the   OMB   and   council   must   adhere  to  the  criteria  and  conditions  around  built-form.  In  an  ideal  scenario,  DPS  by- laws   allow   urban   growth   to   conform   to   the   articulated   needs   of   the   community   first   and  foremost,  as  the  amendment  process  for  additional  height  and  density  would  be   a  much  more  rigorous  process  under  this  system.      On   the   third   and   final   point,   DPS   background   studies   are   designed   to   link   development  impacts  proportionally  to  a  prioritized  list  of  community  benefits.  This   process   has   the   potential   to   better   coordinate   community   benefits   to   mitigate   the   effects  of  growth  in  the  long  term.    It  is  worth  noting  that  very  little  has  been  done   on   the   economics   of   this   approach   so   far   (City   of   Toronto,   2014   Reset   TO   consultation),   so   we   cannot   assume   that   benefits   will   be   an   adequate   source   of   revenue   for   doing   so.   We   can   say   that   benefits   are   better   targeted   and   more   transparent  under  this  system.  To  urban  theorists  like  Armour  (1995)  background   studies   like   those   in   the   DPS   represent   safeguards   the   quality   of   life   of   the

community   by   ensuring   that   compensation   from   development   pressure   is   directly   linked  its  impacts  on  people.      The   final   point   speaks   to   the   idea   that   development   criteria   (a   suite   of   design   and   landscape  criteria)  for  the  entire  site  must  me  adhered  to.  This  holds  potential  for   promoting   a   greater   range   of   housing   options   discussed   in   Section   1.   It   could   also   require   targeted   and   specific   improvements   to   the   public   realm   based   on   findings   from   the   public   realm   assessment   tool   discussed   in   Section   2.   A   DPS   framework   could   better   ensure   that   specific   quality   of   life   objectives   such   as   these   are   addressed.      Overall  the  DPS  as  proposed  so  far  adheres  to  Short's  comprehensive  international   review  of  planning  strategies  to  address  height  and  density:  
The   adoption   of   specific   policies   and   guidance   documents   in   support   of   the   development   plans   should   allow   locally-based   tall   building   solutions   to   evolve   which   reflect   local   concerns,   and   offer   greater   scope   for   them   to   be   both   appropriately   cited   and   reflective   of   community  and  stakeholders  opinions.  (2012,  p.192)  

  

It   must   be   recognized   that   success   of   the   DPS   is   hinged   on   the   process   of   creating   area  by-laws.    Currently,  the  proposed  policy  is  not  at  the  stage  where  it  identified   how  the  process  would  work,  but  suffice  to  say,  a  meaningful  process  will  be  very   difficult   to   implement.      Achieving   the   right   balance   of   interests   that   live   up   to   the   expectations  of  this  approach  will  be  a  daunting  undertaking.  In  particular,  it  will  be   a   hard   balance   to   achieve   a   consensus   between   height-averse   residents   and   a   development  community  that  has  enjoyed  a  system  based  on  exceptions.  However,   as   DPS   plans   are   essentially   a   policy-strong   relative   of   secondary   or   site   specific   plans,  the  City  can  draw  on  the  lessons  learned  from  more  successful  examples  (e.g   Lawrence-Allen  Secondary  Plan)  and  tailor  them  to  an  approach  that  works  for  the   intentions  of  the  DPS.  

Section3  -  Recommendations:

Although  many  features  of  the  DPS  draw  criticism,  it  represents  a  progression  from   the  current  system  of  reactionary,  site-by-site  planning.  This  is  not  to  say  that  it  is   appropriate  everywhere.  The  entirely  voluntary  nature  of  this  system  as  a  planning   tool   is   all   the   more   reason   to   promote   it   as   another   possible   strategy   for   communities   to   better   manage   growth   and   increase   quality   of   life   for   residents.   The   following   refinements   to   the   DPS   moving   forward   would   serve   to   strengthen   its   potential,  while  mitigating  its  shortcomings  where  possible:   1. Improve   clarity   around   how   the   DPS   works,   as   it   is   a   complex   idea   that   requires   a   baseline   of   understanding   for   buy-in.   A   study   of   uptake   of   the   DPS   throughout   Ontario   found   the   main   reason   for   its   relative   lack   of   uptake   is   was  lack  of  knowledge  of  the  system  on  the  part  of  planners,  politicians  and   the   private   sector   (Nethery,   2011,   p.47).   This   means   outlining   the   contentious   aspects   of   the   DPS   ­   mainly   removal   of   appeal   rights   ­   in   a   straightforward   manner,   specifying   that   OMB   cannot   approve   anything   outside  its  standards.      2. Slow   down   the   implementation   of   the   DPS   especially   around   the   fast   tracking   of   permit   approvals.   Emphasis   should   shift   away   from   expediting   the  development  process  and  concentrate  instead  on  a  fulsome  strategy  for   the   front-ended   consultations   to   shape   the   by-law   priorities.   This   could   include  a  predictable  series  of  meetings  based  on  specific  issues  (at  least  4  or   5   sessions).   By   taking   a   measured   approach   to   community   input   and   backing   off   on   unreasonable   45-day   review   periods,   the   DPS   would   increase   buy-in   prioritizing  resident  input  ahead  of  development  interests.      3. Make   the   DPS   more   responsive   to   dynamic   demographic   change.   A   mechanism  should  be  built  into  a  by-law  that  is  linked  to  mobility  trends.  If   an   area   is   seeing   very   high   mobility   above   a   certain   threshold,   the   policy   should   trigger   a   By-law   review   process   to   ensure   that   the   DPS   is   still   representative  of  new  neighbourhood  resident  priorities.      4. To   chose   Pilot   areas   for   DPS   by-laws   strategically.   DPS   by-laws   should   first   be   tested   in   areas   where   large-scale   development   is   putting   pressure   on   the  scale  of  existing  conditions,  such  as  the  areas  where  the   neighbourhoods   and   apartment  neighbourhoods  abut   mixed  use  areas  in  the  OP.17  DPS  is  also   applicable  to  lower  scale  neighbourhoods  that  may  be  able  to  accommodate   very   specific   types   of   higher-density,   yet   lower   scale   development   consistent   with   neighbourhood   character.   At   this   stage   in   its   development,   the   DPS   may  

                                                                                                                 17  Examples  include  the  Church  Wellesley  neighbourhood  and  areas  near  College  and  Spadina,  where  
large-scale  residential  developments  are  beginning  to  `creep'  into  lower  scale  neighbourhoods  or   special  character  areas.

not   be   flexible   enough   respond   to   fully   built-out   and   extremely   dynamic   high   growth   Downtown   areas   like   King-Spadina,   and   may   be   better   suited   to   contexts  looking  to  up-zone  rather  than  down-zone.      5. Ensure   community   benefits   are   selected   realistically,   as   the   mature   urban   fabric   of   the   Downtown   is   constrained   in   the   types   of   benefits  that   can   be  provided.  This  could  include  more  cash-in-lieu  benefits.   6. To  clearly  link  DPS  development  criteria  to  quality  of  life  outcomes.  The   background   studies   need   identify   development   criteria   that   promotes   a   greater  range  of  housing  options,  invests  in  the  surrounding  public  realm  and   responds  to  the  priorities  expressed  by  residents.

Conclusion  
   This   discussion   broadly   considered   quality   of   life   in   the   context   of   development   trends  in  Downtown  Toronto.  Early  on,  we  considered  Michael  Short's  question:  Is   surrounding   communities?   Taking   all   three   sections   together   and   the   recommendations   therein,   we   can   tenuously   answer   this   question.   As   one   of   the   fastest   growing   urban   areas   in   the   world,   the   Downtown   is   facing   incredible   pressure   that   represents   a   threat   to   current   and   future   residents   and   its   own   sustainability.  The  City  has  since  been  moving  to  strengthen  its  policy  framework  to   manage   this   growth   effectively.   This   has   meant   a   shift   toward   a   more   prescriptive   approach  to  planning.      The   Development   Permits   System   shows   significant   potential   to   better   manage   growth  and  tie  new  development  to  targeted  infrastructure  contributions.  DPS  also   affords   communities   with   the   appropriate   tools   to   require   that   the   type   of   growth   we   see   meets   the   priorities   of   residents   and   maintains   a   high   quality   of   life   for   residents.   We   discussed   two   examples   ­   promoting   a   full   range   of   housing   (Section1)   and   a   tool   to   identify   key   investments   to   the   public   realm   in   order   to   support  growth  (Section  2).      While   it   holds   potential,   it   should   be   recognized   that   the   DPS   is   not   appropriate   everywhere.  As  the  DPS  many  not  be  suited  to  the  most  dynamic,  high  growth  areas,   a   suite   of   other   approaches   to   regulating   growth   is   needed.   Alternatives   could   include   updated   Secondary   Plans   or   a   broader   Downtown   Secondary   plan   with   stronger,   more   specific   policy   tools   to   regulate   development.      This   would   likely   include   a   finer   grain   of   guidance   for   the   mixed-use   areas,   vulnerable   lower-scale   neighbourhoods  and  identified  special  character  areas.        As  the  City  moves  forward  with  ever-larger  scales  of  development,  we  need  to  pay   heed   to   how   residents   perceive   their   own   quality   of   life.   Whether   we   recognize   it   or   not,   there   are   limits   to   development   and   the   capacity   to   sustain   growth.   The   further      64  

we  go  with  the  status  quo,  the  less  case  planners  and  communities  will  have  to  set   out  a  vision  for  the  Downtown.
