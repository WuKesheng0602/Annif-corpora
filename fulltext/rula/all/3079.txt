Introduction: Thesis Goals and Methodology This thesis acts as a resource to the photographic works of Marion Faller (1941-2014). The goal of this research is to make Faller's holdings at George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film (Eastman House) accessible to future researchers and to stimulate a discussion on Faller's oeuvre. The holdings include work made exclusively by Faller as well as materials Faller and Hollis Frampton (1936-1984) conceived and produced together. With these holdings, Eastman House expands upon both of the artists' narratives. The collection addressed in the thesis is largely the result of a donation made by Faller in 2012. The proposed objectives of this thesis were met through several steps. First, detailed catalogue records were created of all of the work relating to Faller. While engaged in cataloguing, I carried out research in order to verify dates, mediums, official series titles, photograph titles, and so on. The study was expanded to include Faller's biography in order to form a chronology of her life once the records were complete. I conducted interviews to document Faller's oral history as constructed by her peers and the institutional workers who formed this body. Finally, the findings were fashioned to construct this thesis, as a means of sharing the gathered data. The collection formation is explored in the first chapter of the thesis. This information is important to understand the strengths and constraints of the holdings. The chapter also stipulates the reasons behind Faller's desire to donate her body of work to the Eastman House. The data gathered through interviews with the then director of Eastman House, Anthony Bannon, as well as the Associate Curator Jamie Allen provide insight into the institution's collecting mandate. The second chapter provides an overview of the current literature available on Faller and Frampton. It then discusses briefly the current gaps in data, some of which are addressed in this thesis. The third chapter offers a chronology of Faller's life as an artist, teacher, and mother. The next chapter is broken into seven sections, each of which addresses a single series represented in Faller's donation. This chapter includes a brief introduction to each series and detailed catalogue records accompanied by illustrations of the work. The final chapter concludes the thesis by summarizing the findings and suggesting future areas of study. In addition to these chapters, the thesis contains several appendices that aid in forming a larger understanding of Faller. The appendices are: Faller's complied resume; a brief listing of ! 1

Faller's complete 2012 donation; a list of Eastman House's holdings of Frampton's work; and a list of holdings of Faller's work in other public institutions.

Chapter 1. Introduction to the Faller Collection

Several factors might have influenced Faller's choice of Eastman House as the new home for her body of work. Allen believed that Faller might have thought Eastman House would be the best home for her collection because it afforded the possibility of donating a variety of materials (books, photographs, films, equipment) that could be kept in a single location. Her donation in 2003 of a large selection of Frampton's works! might have also impacted Faller's decision. The addition of the proposed material to the collection would make it possible for scholars to study their work in dialogue.1 Finally, a personal connection with Anthony Bannon, the Director of Eastman House at the time of the donation, may have contributed to the deposit of the gift at Eastman House. Bannon was a student of Frampton's and had known Faller for many years.2 Eastman House's Justification for Accepting Faller's Gift According to now Associate Curator Jamie M. Allen, Eastman House's decision to consider the gift from Faller was impacted by several factors. First, curators established that Faller's work matched the goals of the collection. Faller's connection with Frampton was an important factor. Eastman House already held a substantial representation of his work." The three collaborative series offered would expand upon the understanding of his practice. Faller also had significant ties with artist communities throughout New York State. Having received an MFA from Visual Studies Workshop, Faller had direct ties to the Rochester community. The wide array of photographic media she used and the diversity of her practice made her body of work desirable as an example of trends in contemporary photography production. Finally, Faller's work formed an interesting dialogue when viewed in relation to other artists collected by Eastman: Betty Hahn, Robert Heinecken, Linda Connor, and Frederick Sommer.3

Once Faller's photographs were established as suiting the Eastman House collection, a curation of the gift was made. The July 12, 2012 acquisition report from the Department of Photographs argued that the gift "encompasses the full scope of their [Faller and Frampton's] work together and her work as an independent photographer."4 This stresses how important it was for Eastman House to collect as much of Faller's work as possible. Allen underscored this notion in an interview, stating that once the curatorial team agreed to collect Time Capsule, a sampling of the Contemporary Work had to be part of the collection in order to produce a more complete linage of Faller's work. As the photographs were largely produced in contained portfolios, there wasn't a significant impact on vault storage space; therefore, the constrictions on the accepted material were not based on physical space, rather they were formed based on curatorial choices.5 Because it was Faller's practice to produce work in series, Eastman House curators felt it was important to collect Faller's full series rather than individual prints. With the exception of thirty-four photographs from Contemporary Work, the entire gift Faller offered was accepted into the Eastman House collection. Many of Faller's projects had specific beginning and end points. Time Capsule, for example, was produced when her son was between the ages of twelve and fourteen. While the series contains one hundred and ten photographs, Faller viewed the series as a single piece; thus in order to understand the series according to her artistic intent, the whole series had to be acquired. Similarly, Vegetable Locomotion, produced with Frampton, had sixteen photographs in the series. These factors were carefully weighed during the acquisition process.6 Incorporating Vegetable Locomotion into its holdings allowed the museum to provide insight into Faller and Frampton's creative process. The negatives offered by Faller to the Department of Photographs in 2012 would complement the set of prints previously purchased by Eastman House. This gift also included a donation of films to the Motion Picture department produced by Faller and Frampton while working on Vegetable Locomotion. Knowing that the museum would gain a significant asset through the complete holdings of this project impacted the decision to accept the negatives. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Faller's use of specific photographic materials and processes to produce her work had a role in swaying the curators to accept certain prints offered in the gift. Second Flora, for example, combined many different media in a single series, including toned gelatin silver prints, cyanotypes, chomogenic prints, silver dye bleach prints, and so on. While there were prints made with the same negative in the offered gift, they did not use the same medium, and contained slight alterations in added details between the variant prints, which made each photograph unique. Neither Nor: A Primer, another of Faller's series, was considered desirable for the collection as an example of dot-matrix prints. As Eastman House collects the history of the photographic medium, these objects were seen as desirable to demonstrate the different uses of photographic media. Rarity was another consideration that had a role in the selection process. Faller offered Hey Baby, Take My Picture, a series comprised of fifty-one gelatin silver prints (many of which were mounted) as the only complete set of the series. The fact that there are few complete sets of Time Capsule, and Neither Nor: A Primer, played a role in Eastman House's determination to incorporate these series into their holdings. Despite the edition number of four on the Neither Nor: A Primer portfolio, Faller didn't produce any other sets from the edition, thus making the one owned by Eastman House a unique set of objects.# On the other hand, the group of works encompassed in Contemporary Work could be found in various collections throughout New York State, such as the Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York. Because Faller didn't suggest the group formed an integral totality, Eastman House decided to make a selection from the images Faller offered. Of the fortysix photographs on offer, twelve were selected. In this case, the selection was curated to work in dialogue with Eastman House's current holdings, (for example the work of Roger Mertin). Moreover, the choice of accepting several prints from a series is consistent with contemporary collecting trends. Allen explained that this is typical; when a contemporary artist produced a body of work, museums often purchase a selection to represent that body of work rather than the whole portfolio. As the work was contemporary, it was decided that a selection of the most representative work could be made.7

Traditionally in print media such as lithography and etchings, edition numbers indicate the number of prints produced at the same period. In photography, edition numbers represent the number of times the work will be printed. The prints are therefore rarely produced at the same time. 7 Allen, Jamie M. Interview by author.

Faller's images reflected the period in which she was active. When artists were reclaiming the plastic arts through the use of hand-made processes such as collage and cyanotypes, Faller made work of that sort. She quickly picked up on trends that would later be popularized, like colour photography. While her work relates to these trends, she was unique in her ability to produce work that resonated with her past and broke new ground. Each of her series builds upon the last. Frampton stressed these notions in his 1981 essay "Notes on Marion Faller's Photographs:" "That same decade encloses Marion Faller's artistic maturation, and the public emergence of her work. Ms. Faller is one of a sparse generation whose practice has forced a radical transvaluation within photography and elevated its level of discourse... and whose shared predicament has consisted most of all in the luxury from the normative art world and its valorizing apparatus. The body of work presents her as typical of this generation, and as a considerable master within it."8 When Faller offered Eastman House her photographs, the museum had already assembled a strong collection of nineteenth and early twentieth century photographs; they saw this acquisition as a means of building a stronger collection of postmodern work.9 Ultimately, Faller's 2012 gift was highly regarded by the curators at Eastman House, and the proposed material was maintained almost in its entirety. This collection's addition to the holdings of Eastman House ensures that Faller's and Frampton's work may be studied by scholars and seen by the many visitors who access the collection each year. !

Chapter 2. Literature Review

This literature review constitutes a survey of the current information available on Marion Faller. It begins by addressing biographical sources on Faller, and then offers summaries of reviews of Faller's work. Finally, it examines biographical texts on Frampton and literature addressing his collaborations with Faller. a. Marion Faller Biography ! Gretchen Garner's 1995 survey of North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century A Biographical Dictionary (ed. Jules Heller and Nancy Heller), places Faller in the tradition of documentary photography. This biographical note also stresses the importance of series to the photographer. The short text includes a summary of Faller's education, her teaching position at State University of New York in Buffalo, a few series of art work, exhibition listings, and various collection holdings.10 Gina Murtagh's brief essay for the "Marion Faller: Detail-Repetition-Variation" exhibition presented at the Robert B. Menschel Media Center in Syracuse, New York in 1988 comments only on Faller's serial works. This text offers a chronology of works, but only in relation to the art presented in the exhibition. This includes: Flora (1977-1979), Local Conventions (1979-1983), Nativity (1982), Swienconka and Alters, and concludes with Neither Nor: A Primer. The exhibition flyer makes no mention of Frampton's involvement in Neither Nor: A Primer, and does not include any collaborations by Faller and Frampton.11 A different understanding of Faller may be gained from Buffalo Heads: Media Study, Media Practice, Media Pioneers, 1973-1990, edited by Woody Vasulka and Peter Weibel. While the book does not address Faller, it provides a deep understanding of the faculty and mandate of the State University of New York at Buffalo, the university where Faller taught from 1982 to

2002. The introductory essays explain the atmosphere of SUNY Buffalo, where Faller worked, produced, and exhibited work. A key biographical source on Faller are the résumés she gave to George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film and Visual Studies Workshop.! This source has been expanded upon in the chronology in chapter three of this thesis. b. References to Faller's Work In 1981, Hollis Frampton wrote "Notes on Marion Faller's Photographs" for a small publication produced to accompany Marion Faller / Photographs, an exhibition mounted at Utica College in Utica, New York. In the introduction, Frampton provides a description of postmodernist photography as a recent state in which the photographs becomes a known language separate from art. Next, he argues that Faller's work is an example of the mastering of themes typically dealt with by this emerging generation of artists. Frampton praises Faller's abilities to engulf low culture into art, stating: "Ms. Faller is one of a sparse generation whose practice has forced a radical transvaluation within photography and elevated its level of discourse... the claims of paintings and its allies, and of paraliteray languages, are confronted and abruptly engulfed, in a gesture that invites and expands definitions of the art and its role in the economy of the intellect." 12 The essay concludes by celebrating Faller as a female artist. Paul Richard also writes on Faller's work as it relates to feminism. He comments on Time Capsule, one of Faller's series, in the context of an exhibition review of The State of Upstate: New York Women Artists, published in The Washington Post and titled "`Upstate': Strident Feminism" (Jun. 7, 1990). Here, Richard reflects on Faller through her relationship to other feminist artists. While he believes "a kind word should be said as well for artist Marion Faller..." he concludes by snubbing the work, mocking the feminist agenda.13 Richard's brief article demonstrates the backlash against artists committed to feminist discourse. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Similar brief remarks addressing Faller's work presented in the context of group shows were made in The Atlantic Journal,14 The Buffalo News,15 Artvoice,16 the New York Times,17 and Afterimage.18 These articles typify the sources currently available on Faller. In contrast to these writings, Catherine Lord published a compelling essay on the process of gathering women's artwork for an exhibition at the Visual Studies Workshop. In the paper published in Afterimage, Lord sheds light on issues faced by women in the art world and defines characteristics of women's art. In the text, Faller's series Second Flora is used as an example of the complexities of decorative art.19 c. Hollis Frampton Biography In 2009, Bruce Jenkins produced a collection of writings by Hollis Frampton titled On the Camera Arts and Consecutive Matters: The Writings of Hollis Frampton. The book republished twelve of Frampton's essays from Circles of Confusion as well as texts from public lectures, grant applications, proposals, and production notes. Taken together, these texts offer a valuable overview of Frampton's approach and understanding of camera arts. It also furnishes insight into Frampton's creative process, opinions and relationships. Hollisframpton.org.uk/bio.htm provides an extensive biography of Frampton. The page includes a timeline with key dates as well as samples of biographies written by Frampton himself and by Stan Brakhage, an experimental filmmaker.20 This biography republishes Jenkins' established chronology from Recollections/Recreations, a catalogue published to accompany a traveling exhibition organized by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York.21 In 2008, Woody Vasulka and Peter Weibel compiled an extensive collection of writings by and about faculty members at the Department of Media Studies, SUNY Buffalo. That compendium is titled Buffalo Heads: Media Study, Media Practice, Media Pioneers, 1973-1990. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This publication is useful when contextualizing Frampton's work experience and suggests a great deal about his relationship with other media artists and media theory. There is an entire chapter dedicated to addressing Hollis Frampton's teaching methods and artistic practice. This chapter includes a detailed vitae and a number of texts by Frampton, including working notes on films. In addition, short interviews and essays from other faculty members about Frampton are provided in this section. Four sets of images from Vegetable Locomotion, a collaborative series produced by Faller and Frampton, are published in the book, but are not accompanied by an essay.22 d. References to Faller & Frampton's Collaborations ! Texts addressing Faller and Frampton's collaborative practice typically focus on the final artwork rather than their creative process and intellectual collaboration. Vivien Raynor, for example, commented on Faller and Frampton's Vegetable Locomotion series in her 1988 article "Art; Photographers Take Aim at the Images from Earlier Works" for the New York Times. The piece, acting as a sort of exhibition review for Photographs Beget Photographs as exhibited at the Neuberger Museum, begins by tracing back to Marcel Duchamp use of appropriation, claiming that the exhibition has proven that photography has achieved "intellectual parity" with painting. Next, Raynor touches upon the multiple series exhibited, including Vegetable Locomotion.23 Christian Peterson's 1987 essay for the Photographs Beget Photographs exhibition catalogue discusses Vegetable Locomotion within the context of other work in the exhibition, such as that of Pierre Cordier. Peterson views this work as a continuation of Faller's and Frampton's cataloguing of the world around them through serial imagery and the documentation of non-events.24 Similarly, Paul Berger's 1983 production catalogue Radical, Rational, Space, Time: Idea Networks in Photography, published to coincide with the opening of an exhibition of the same name, comments on Vegetable Locomotion. He states that Faller and Frampton's collaborations contain exemplary qualities that typify the new art. These include: reversal of !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To date, no one has published a comprehensive monograph on Faller's work. Typically her life is discussed within the context of the work analyzed in exhibition texts. The chronology produced for this thesis provides an overview of Faller's life as teacher, curator, artist, and mother. Frampton's incorporation in this chronology has allowed me to highlight his relationship with Faller and the work they produced collaboratively. This will provide a new perspective on Frampton's life, one which was previously not addressed. Seven chapters in this thesis have been dedicated to the discussion of the series Faller donated to Eastman House. These chapters provide a detailed record of the works that were previously unavailable. The chapters addressing the collaborative series produced by Faller and Frampton will provide a wider range of information than is currently available on their bodies of work.

Chapter 4. Series Review and Collection Holdings

a. Hey Baby, Take My Picture In 1972, a year after graduating from Hunter College, Faller embarked on Hey Baby, Take My Picture. She continued to make this work until 1975. While walking in New York City with her camera, Faller found that men would call out to her to take their picture. To Faller, these images were a means of capturing these fleeting moments of connection. After making a photograph of the strangers, Faller would offer to make a print for them. Out of the fifty-one men photographed, only one took Faller up on her offer. She stated that she would photograph any person who asked to be photographed; however, she was only approached by men. Hey Baby, Take My Picture explores themes that are seen throughout Faller's work, such as the importance of series, the formation of connections, and an attempt to grapple with the medium of photography. Faller's donation to Eastman House includes fifty-one gelatin silver prints from this series. Most of the prints are mounted on mat-board, typically stamped with Faller's name and address. None of the images in Hey Baby, Take My Picture are titled; all are given the title of the series. This artist statement was included in Faller's donated material: "All these images are from a series of street portraits. They are pictures of men who asked to be photographed. All of the photographs were made in New York City, though I carry my camera with me where ever else I go. The situation only seems to occur there. Only men and boys have asked -- never women. I'm told, though, that young women often asked men to photograph them. I never say "no" or ignore the request. Being photographed is important, and if you don't get it at home, you're likely to look elsewhere. I've found that many men changed their minds when seriously confronted -only about one half would really let me photograph. Each image is the result of one exposure and they have all been printed. Only one man asked me for a print of his picture.

I suppose the request is directed in part at me as a woman and in part at my camera -- a desire to make contact and a need to be photographed."76 In 1981, Faller had a short article about the series published in Exposure, a magazine associated with the Society for Photographic Education; the article included an artist statement and a selection of four prints.77 Prints from Hey Baby, Take My Picture may also be found in the holdings of Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, New York.

b. Second Flora

Second Flora was produced as part of a final project for the Visual Studies Workshop between 1977 and 1979. This series demonstrates Faller's interest in found images, the materials of the photographic medium, portraits captured through mechanical representation, and collage. She understood that each medium had its limitations and therefore didn't see a problem with utilizing several different photographic mediums to investigate the idea underlying a series. Concerning Second Flora, she stated, "While women can be named after honored saints and beloved relatives -- just like men -- they can also be named after jewels, virtues, the spring months... the women in these photographic fictions happen to have plant names."78 By the time this series was completed, Faller had produced over sixty variant photographs. This series stressed Faller's understanding of the photographic medium. The series speaks to the fundamentals of the auto-mechanical representation formed by photography by utilizing both a photographic negative and a photogram in the construction of the final image's form. By doing this, Faller makes the viewer aware of the construction of the photographic image, breaking from photography's inherent illusion of a mirrored reality. The portraits of the women were produced in the way photographs commonly are, with a photographic negative; while the floral and collage elements were created by putting objects on top of the light sensitive paper (to produce a photogram). Faller used found images for the portraits in the series. Her collage structure provided a context for and a means of approaching the interpretation of the portraits. The collection at Eastman House holds seventeen prints from Second Flora, in a variety of media, including silver dye bleach, chromogenic, cyanotype, toned gelatin silver, and gelatin silver. Before being given to Eastman House, the photographs were mounted (presumably by the artist) in a window mat with labels giving detailed information on their titles, medium, and date of production. While this is a small selection of the series, these prints reflect the diversity found in Faller's series. There are several examples of her usage of the same depiction and representing it as a variant, for example she printed the same collage on silver dye bleach and chromogenic papers. These emphasize the non-realist attributes of photographic representations. The selection !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

c. Vegetable Locomotion Produced in collaboration with Hollis Frampton in 1975, Vegetable Locomotion is Faller's most well-known series. The work addresses Eadweard Muybridge's Animal Locomotion publication by echoing the famous format in the publication of a grid with an object frozen in time in various states of motion. These grid-based images were then placed into strips to demonstrate the way the photographed object looks in motion. At the most basic level, this series explores the illustration of time by the plastic arts and the means in which they deceive the viewer. By repetitively repositioning inanimate objects against a grid background layout, Faller and Frampton raise our awareness of the ease with which reality can be distorted. This comic reexamination alludes to classic photographic series that were produced to apply photography in scientific study. Frampton was extremely interested in Muybridge's representations and addressed his aesthetics in several essays, such as, "Inclusions in History / Segments of Eternity,"79 "For A Metahistory of Film: Common place Notes and Hypotheses,"80 and "Eadweard Muybridge: Fragments of a Tesseract."81 In a lecture Faller gave at Princeton University, she highlighted the importance of the titles of the photographs to the meaning of the work. First she clarified that "var." found in the work titles stands for varietal or varieties, and not variations. The numbers in the titles, though unconventional, are important because they speak to Muybridge's plate numbers.82 The final image in the series, for example, is titled, "782. Apple Advancing [var. `Northern Spy']," one plate more than Muybridge had produced. This series was produced as a series of sixteen, the numbers in the titles ascend but they do not do so in a pattern. Eastman House holds several components of Vegetable Locomotion that collectively display the range of Faller and Frampton's creative process. In 1976, Eastman House purchased a complete series of gelatin silver prints from Visual Studies Workshop, Rochester, New York. Faller's 2012 gift included the constructed negative layouts that Faller and Frampton created to produce the prints; these constructions are formed by fixing the negative enlargements onto a black backing with red tape. In relation to these objects, Faller also donated four snapshots that !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

d. False Impressions In 1971, Faller and Frampton produced False Impressions. The work critiques the blind acceptance of photography's uses found in our daily lives. Through these collages, the two artists project their dilemmas and concerns, constructing and deconstructing the commercial uses of photography. Their choice of electrostatic prints as the series medium was likely made to allow them to suggest the proliferation of reproduced images. It also allowed them to stress certain questionable elements in propagated visual data, such as the exaggerated size and colour. As with their other collaborative work, this series requires knowledge of the accepted historical narrative of photography, and popular culture of the sixties and seventies. The titles often make puns to draw attention to specific items within the frame, subtly guiding the viewer to unpacking these loaded constructions. False Impressions is a series of twenty-one colour electrostatic prints. This series is an example of the adoption of a photocopier, a commercial device utilized in the 1970s to produce artistic images. It allowed them to make multiple copies of their work quickly and inexpensively. The process of generating art with this machine also allowed artists to disseminate their work to a wider audience while at the same time breaking from the traditional use of photocopiers. Editions of artworks produced on these industrial devices grounded them in the world of commodities, reversing the established notions of a photocopy as an object with no aura. False Impressions was produced in an edition of fourteen. Faller's gift to Eastman House was composed of a complete edition of False Impressions. The twenty-one prints on legal sized paper are all indicated as `8/14' on the print verso. All works were donated unmounted. Prints from False Impressions can also be found in the holdings of Light Work, Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York, and Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

e. Time Capsule

In Time Capsule, Faller produced a new way of considering discarded objects. In this series, she offered a reflection on the intimate experience of motherhood. Faller photographed the contents of her son's Will's pockets between 1979 and 1981, creating a document of his life between the ages of 12 and 14. While all these images produce an interesting perspective on Will and Marion, they are successful because of their quantity and groupings. By isolating the objects on a grey background, Faller highlights their affinities, similarities, and contrasts. The staging of these objects makes her artistic choices clear. The scope of the project would suggest a linear timeline, or a regular temporal fragment; however, the series actually contains large gaps of several months and has no pattern. At times, several photographs in the series were produced on the same day. In a CEPA gallery exhibition announcement Faller wrote the following: "These photographs are color still lives of the contents of my son's pockets as they were emptied on laundry day. The first picture was made in 1979 when he was nearly 12; the photographing continued for over two years. Due to a combination of circumstance and intention, I waited until this year to print the negatives and re-examine this TIME CAPSULE."83 Faller printed each photograph as a five by seven image on chromogenic paper and then mounted them in panels, grouped in fives. She wrote the date each photograph was captured on the window mat panels. The 2012 gift to Eastman House includes a total of one-hundred and ten prints photo-cornered in sets of five in twenty-two window mats. Each of the sets has at least one print embossed with Faller's name. Upon Faller's donation of this work to the museum, she stated that this was the only complete set she had printed.

f. Neither Nor: A Primer

Around 1980, Faller and Frampton began working out ideas for Neither Nor: A Primer. The work was completed in 1988 by Faller, four years after Frampton's death. In the portfolio, Faller paired compound words with simple graphic illustrations from a computer. The series forces the viewer to consider the way composite phrases are formed; they rarely mean the sum of the two words. In a statement about the series, Faller explained "This portfolio of prints celebrates that class of compound words whose meaning is given in neither the former word nor the latter. Around 1980, Hollis Frampton and I collected a handful of these neither-nor words with the idea of doing a collaborative photographic series based on them. Perhaps photographic images would have been too cumbersome, but the project did not materialize at the time. Early in 1987 I began to work with an Amiga computer. The simplicity and charm of clip-art and simple graphics programs reminded me of the 19thcentury primer and chapbook illustrations -- so I decided to collect more neithernor words to see if I could find enough for a primer full of them. The portfolio was generated on an Amiga 1000 computer, with Unison World's PrintMaster Plus and Printmaster Art gallery I and II software. The prints were made on Rives Lightweight paper with a Panasonic KX-P1091 printer. I adapted the definitions from these and other sources: American Heritage Dictionary, 24th printing. Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, 1971 edition. Pocket Dictionary of American Slang, 7th printing. Webster's Elementary Dictionary, 1971 edition. Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, 1961 edition."84 This series was exhibited in Robert B. Menschel Photography Gallery in Syracuse, New York between November 11 and December 31, 1988 as part of Faller's solo exhibition DetailRepetition-Variation. The exhibition was organized by Light Work, a photography center !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Gina Murtagh, the assistant director of Light Work, wrote a short essay reviewing the works on exhibit, including Neither Nor: A Primer.85 The series was conceived as being an edition of four, however, only one set was printed. The 2012 acquisition of the work makes Eastman House the only collector of Neither Nor: A Primer. The complete portfolio originally consisted of twenty-four prints; however, one was lost before the donation was made. The misplaced work was titled "Showboat." A reproduction of the object was donated with the series by Faller. The works were all printed using a Panasonic KX-P1091 printer on Rives Lightweight paper. This is a form of dot-matrix printing and is not commonly used in the production of art.

g. Contemporary Work

From 1982 until her passing in 2014, Faller produced a number of bodies of work, including Local Conventions; Nativity; Swienconka; and Altars. Unlike her previous work, these series didn't have a strict number of images in them, nor did they have a beginning and end point; rather they were produced over a long period of time and contemplation. As a result, while each series explores a different topic, they are all interrelated and often work in dialogue with each other. The photographs investigate aspects of social demonstrations of culture. These include the following: altars, both secular and religious; the ornamentation of the home; expressions of traditions; and documentation of material used in the practice of folk art. In 1986, Faller reflected on Nativity: "These photographs are from a larger ongoing series, Nativity, begun in 1982. Like much of my other work, Nativity is a `theme and variations' set of pictures. The photographs examine the annual rituals of setting out these family figures, attempt to humorously test an art historical genre in a contemporary settings, and question the flurry of "creche crisis" news that occurs each Christmas season."86 When Faller donated her Contemporary Work, she did not differentiate between the series. She donated the large prints as a collection of work. Perhaps this choice may be explained by her statement: "My work is about how individuals and communities visually express their values, their interests, and their sense of what is important and beautiful. The subject matter is usually close to home -- homes, yards, small businesses and community buildings such as schools or churches."87 Of the forty-six photographs offered to Eastman House, curators selected twelve that represented this era of her work. The other works were returned to Faller. The twelve chromogenic prints range in size and subject matter but all reflect her interest in documenting fleeting monuments. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Chapter 5. Conclusion Hollis Frampton said, "Marion Faller's enterprise is, in the most welcome sense, ambitious: aesthetically, philosophically, politically... Best of all, the wit and grace with which it is joined make her work entirely unique."88 These words could be said of the collection of Faller's work at the Eastman House. The collection spans a thirty-year work period, demonstrating her strength in conceptualizing and producing work that continues to resonate years after its creation. Overall, this thesis may be used as a guide to begin the research process on Faller's art practice. The thesis opens with an introduction to the thesis goal and the collection, allowing the reader to understand the data that can be found in each chapter. Next, an introduction is provided to the Faller collection at Eastman House. By understanding Eastman House's motivations behind accepting Faller's gift, the acquisition can shed light on the institution's collecting strategy. The following chapter described the current writings available on Faller's work. This gathered data highlights the series that have been well researched and demonstrates the current gaps in scholarly material. The third chapter establishes a broad chronology of Faller's life as an artist, teacher, and mother. This, accompanied by the various appendices! can be utilized to form a longer biography. The detailed catalogue records accompanied by images in the fourth chapter provide a key document in analyzing Faller and Frampton's work. As language played a major role in both artists' work, a proper record of official titles is important when approaching the works. Utilizing the chronology and series review chapter in unison allows for a basic understanding of Faller's and Frampton's practice and what may have influenced their work. Stephen C. Pinson, the Robert B. Menschel Curator of Photography in the Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs at the New York Public Library stated, "the history of alternative spaces, and particularly the history of such spaces for photography, is still being written. This renewed attention will expand our perception of the photographers whose

work was seen during the period in which photography became a mainstay of the art world."89 The boom in photographic practices during the sixties and seventies caused by the establishment of the history of photography has created a large gap in the scholarly research on key figures such as Faller. Her commitment to photography is seen in her art, her career choice as an educator in the medium, and in her active membership in various art institutions and artist-run centres. Faller was awarded many grants and exhibitions throughout her career. This thesis produces an introduction to her complex and multifaceted body of work. Further research should be conducted on Faller through the fields of linguistics, art history, photographic technology, women's studies, academic folklorists, and cultural anthropologists. More research should be done to contextualize Faller's practice within postmodern art and culture. This research would add not only to the understanding of Faller's work, but also address the gap in historical attention to this kind of work that Pinson identified. Faller's work would also support fruitful research on artistic collaborations, especially those of life partners. In addition, the following themes are vital components of her work: photographic series; the ontology of photography; photography as self-reflection; the relationship between high and low art; the relationship between art and reality; photography as document; and photography as 'found art.'
